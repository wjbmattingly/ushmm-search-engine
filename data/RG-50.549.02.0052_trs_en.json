        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection,\nthis is an interview with Norman Salsitz, conducted by Regina Baier, on July fifth, 1999,\nconducted by -- with Norman Salsitz on May 12\", 1990. The United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this\ninterview possible. This is tape number one, side A. So -- any my first question would be\nwhen were you born, and where?",
        "Answer: I was born May the sixth, 1920, in a small town in Poland, southern Poland,\nnamed Kolbushova. And this -- people think that this -- well, this was known as\nGaleetsia, because before 1918, this belonged to Austria, and now as a section of Poland\nwas called Galeetsia, so there where I was born. Then it became Poland, and it -- the\nsection was called minor Poland. So, it was a very small town. It -- the town had 4,000\npeople, and from the 4,000 people, 2,000 were Jews, and 2,000 were Poles -- Catholics.\nWe only had Catholics in our section. Protestants, we didn\u2019t have any Protestants there,\nso all Jews, or Catholics.",
        "Q: And Norman, you have different names. One name you were born with, a name --\ncertain -- several names that you used during the war, and a name now. Could you give\nus first, all of these names?",
        "A: Yes. I can give you the names, because sometimes when I -- on the street, or when I\nam in New York, and there are people who call me when they see me, and they call me\ndifferent names, and I know from th -- where they know me. Well now -- will tell you the\n-- the names. So for -- I was born as Naftali Salishitz. Salishitz was like -- is pronounced\nas a ger -- German name, because we were in Austria, with a u -- umlaut, and this how I\nwas born. In the war, I became the first one that it was changed. It was Tadosh Yadduch.\nTadosh Yadduch is when I joined the Polish underground, the AK, which is the home\narmy, and in Polish it\u2019s armia kryova. They didn\u2019t accept Jews, so I had to get some\npapers, and I masqueraded as a Polish Catholic, and with my papers, my birth certificate,\nwhich we will talk about it later, was Tadosh Yadduch, so my name was -- this was the\nname, and also, my friends called me Taddek. This is from Tadosh, is Taddek. So for\nthis, if I hear somebody calls me Taddek, so I know they know me from this town. Then\nmy name was, when I was there, so my name was -- became, in one part, it became\nLazerosh Spillman. I had to do a certain job, and I had to be a German, so I had a friend,\nhis name was Lazerosh Spillman, I took his name, and -- and this was for a short time,\nbecause Spillman is German, Lazerosh [indecipherable]. Then I wer -- I -- my name\nbecame Anatoli Sherberkof. Anatoli Sherberkof is when I joined the r -- Russian group,\nand there were Russians, and again I had to masquerade as a -- as a -- as a Russian, so my\nname was Anatoli Sherberkof. Then when I -- after the war, after I was liberated, I joined\nthe Polish army. I volunteered for the Polish army, and my name became Tadosh\nSzaleski, because Tadosh, I liked the name, and Szaleski is because it\u2019s a very -- it\u2019s a\nnice, Polish name, with the s-k-i in the end. And this -- I used this name during my time\nin the Polish army, which I had a very, very important position, until I escaped. Also -- so\nnow, when I see a person calls me Taddek, and so I know from where. And calls me\nNaftali, so I know he knows me from home. And then, my name was -- I was called\nLotchik. Lotchik in Russian means a pilot, because when I joined the army, I was\naccepted to the air force, and everybody envied me, because very few people were\naccepted to the air force. So 1n po -- Russian is called Lotchik, so people called me\nLotchik. Now even today, when I see some friends from this time, they say, \u201cOh, Lotchik\nis calling.\u201d Yeah. And then when I came to America -- so I changed my name from\nNaftali, because I came to America on my real name Naftali Salishitz. So I changed my\nname to Norman Salsitz, because my family thought that this is a -- all my family\nchanged their names, and I picked out Salsitz, and nor -- and there is a whole story about\n-- about how I would change, but this is not for now. I have the story in my ne -- coming\nbook how my name was changed. So I remained with na -- with Norman Salsitz, and this\nhow I am today.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll talk about that story a little bit later actually, on the tape, too, but let me ask you\nthis, who was Naftali?",
        "A: Now --",
        "Q: Who wa -- who was the man that the -- that they would remember, and who was the\nboy, or the young man that you remember?",
        "A: Well, you want to know why I\u2019m named Naftal1?",
        "Q: No, I wanted -- I wanted to know what your dr -- what you\u2019re dreams were, that wa --",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: -- who were you at that time, as a young person?",
        "A: Well, Naftali -- I was the youngest in my family, which means all my sis -- I had five\nsisters. My fif -- sisters were older, and I was very, very spoiled, because all of them, as a\nmatter of fact, til I was three, four years, one sister, which I liked very much -- I liked all\nof them -- I called her mama til I was four years old. They actually raised me, because my\nmother had nine children, so it was very hard for her. We lived in one room in this time,\nand there was -- I was born after the war. So I was very spoiled. And then later, nothing\nwas impossible for me, because the family allowed me for a lot of things. And later,\nwhen I was older, I was not an angel. I did certain things that my father didn\u2019t like.\nNaturally, I didn\u2019t do bad things, but I was -- I was a re -- always I was a rebel. And I\nalways, if I -- I always reached higher, that my -- my kind of people, or my family\nexpected, especial later, when I started to go out with the girl of my dreams,\n[indecipherable]. I always wanted something higher, and I -- in school, I was a very -- I\nwas, in my class in the public school, I was always the best student. And I have all my\nreport cards. I have the report cards from the first grade to the last grade, I saved them,\ntogether with my photos. And I ver -- it was very unusual for a Jewish boy, who had\nsidelocks, and was reli -- and was dressed as a -- as a Hassidic boy, to have good report\ncards, because the teachers all were Poles -- Catholics, there was not a Jewish teacher,\nand they all hated Jews. Because I would say -- oh, maybe it\u2019s not the right expression,\nbut I would say 95 percent they hated Jews, and especial they hated a Jew who was a\nreligious Jew. We were different. So -- to -- for a Jew like this, to get a report card with --\nfrom top to bottom excellent, it was very unusual, but I have the report cards. Now, I\nwent also to a Jewish school, we called it Yeshiva -- Chadda -- or Yeshiva, where we\nlearn Jewish subjects. Now, I was not so good there, and my father always -- always ask\nquestions. \u201cHow comes in the Polish school you are the best, and here you are not such a\ngood student?\u201d Well, I didn\u2019t have so much interest in it. I had interest in geography, in\nhistory. Even today, so many years later, if you will ask me -- there was the river Vistula\nin Poland, which was the main river. And the main river had so many small rivers\nrunning into the main river, to make it a bigger river. And it started in the Carpathian\nmountains, and it ended in the Baltic Sea, in Danzig. So I can today mention all the rivers\nwho fell in from the Carpathian mountains to the Vistula, the left and the right side. I\nremember it, because I was very interested 1n it. Poland had 40 kings, and if you will ask\nme, I will mention all the 40 kings, when they became kings, when they died. I remember\nthose things, because I had an interest in this. And --",
        "Q: Tell me two.",
        "A: Two?",
        "Q: Just as a test.",
        "A: Well, I would -- I would tell you, just as a test, I will tell you the first and the last one.\nMaybe this will be the [indecipherable]. The first one was Meershko Peervsha. It means\nme -- his name was Meershko, and he was the originator of the Polish kingdom, before\nPoland didn\u2019t have a kingdom, didn\u2019t have a country, there were tribes. And Meershko\nPeervsha was the first king, and he was also important, because in 966, he accepted\nChristianity for the Polish people. So 966 was very important. And the last one was\nZigmund August Porniatofsky. He was the last king, the 40\" king. So, h-he -- the --\nZigmund August Porniatofsky, there are rumors about him, that he was a lover of the\nRussian, and -- the czarina, and then -- and Poland didn\u2019t like it so much. Well, so those\nthings were very important for me. Like, for instance, the mountains in Poland, the rivers\nin Poland, I remember it, because I loved it. So for this reason, I was a very good student.",
        "Q: Wh-Why did you love it so much? What was so important to you?",
        "A: I loved it for -- for a few reasons. The first thing it was to me -- when I lived in\nPoland, I considered myself a Pole, a patriot. I say, we live in this country -- Jews lived in\nPoland for a thousand years. My town existed since 1773. So 1t means oma -- over two\nhun -- 200 years. So I always said, if I live in a country, I -- this is my country. Naturally,\nin this time -- and so I loved it, and I loved everything, and also literature. If you will ask\nme about Polish writers, and Polish literature -- literature, I remember important poems.\nAnd -- and I -- I liked it. Where the Jewish learning, I did it because my father wanted me\nto do it. I was proud to be a Jew, but I wanted to show, because I lived in Poland, and\nbecause the peep -- Polish people didn\u2019t like us, so I wanted to show that I am a good\nPole. And so was my father. My father was, I would say, the biggest Polish patriot in our\ntown. He was a Jew with the long beard, and -- and very religious, very learned, but he\nwas one of the few who spoke Polish beautiful. He spoke Polish without a Jewish accent,\ncorrect grammar, ever -- he spoke -- now, as a matter of fact, 1f sometimes they had to\nsend a delegation to the Polish peep -- to the government or something, my father went as\na spokesman, because on account of his language. And when there were some national\nholidays or something, my sp -- father spoke about -- spoke, because it was unusual to\nsee a Jew with a long, gray beard speak Polish. Now, there was a reason why he spoke\ngood Polish, and if later -- if you will have time, I will tell you the reasons. So I li -- now,\nfor instance, there was a peasant movement in Poland, which 90 -- I would say 75 percent\nof the population were peasants. And they were not very well off before the war. They --\nthe government didn\u2019t treat them very right, because where -- because the government\nwas run by the nobility, and by people who were educated, and the peasants didn\u2019t have a\nchance. Now, my father was the only Jew in our town that he belonged to this movement.\nAnd when the peasants used to make gatherings in our town, which the government was\nagainst it, and the thousands of thousands of peasants came to the marketplace to speak\nabout the unjustice, what the government is doing against the Poles, against the peasants,\nall the meetings, everything was done in our house. Now, he did it because he believed in\nit, and also he did business with the peasants. Our business -- he had the wholesale\ngrocery store, and the wholesale -- the grocery store was not a grocery, it was like in\nAmerica you have a general store; we sold everything. We sold in a -- grease for wagons,\nand we sold kerosene, and we sold flour -- wi -- everything was in our store. So the small\nstores in the villages came to buy by us, because we were the wholesaler. And so this\nway he had the contact with the people. Also, he had the contact because he was born in\nthat village. He was born in that village in 1882, in a village called Dubass, which is\nabout five kilometer from Kolbushova. His father was the manager of the village. Now, I\nwant you should know that a village isna -- wasn\u2019t like it\u2019s now, which is everybody land\n-- owned land. A village belonged to one person. In old -- it was a serfdom, it was a -- so\nthen the -- all the people worked for this person, and my grandfather was the manager.\nWhen to cut, when to gather, when to sell, he was the manager. And in Poland he had --\nin Polish he had a special name, they called him Veeairnick. Veeairnick in Poland means\na man -- a trust -- a trustee. It means that you believed him. So the man who owned the\nvillage trusted him, and he was managing, and naturally the profit went to the owner. So\nmaybe this is the reason my father had a little connection to the land, to the people, and\nnaturally, they didn\u2019t reciprocate, they didn\u2019t pay him back that they loved him, because -\n- maybe they liked him, but they didn\u2019t love him because he was a Jew.",
        "Q: So you gave us a little bit of an understanding of where you came from, and who you\nwere when you were called Naftali. Who were you as a person when you were Taddek,\nand -- was it Lotchik?",
        "A: No, no. Taddek Yadduch.",
        "Q: Not [indecipherable]",
        "A: Taddek Yadduch.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Taddek. This was --",
        "Q: Or Tadosh when you had the other --",
        "A: -- Tadosh, right.",
        "Q: -- the other identity.",
        "A: Tadosh I became, is after I went through -- the Germans came in -- after I went\nthrough the ghetto. I went through three camps, from which I escaped, and I went in to\nthe underground, to the woods. We had a Jewish group. In our Jewish group, we had 120\n-- this is a long story -- we -- I describe it in my books. We had 125 members in our\ngroup, Jews. We started to get arms, guns, and then later, I was shot by my -- one of my\nbest friends, he shot me four times, three bullets entered my neck. And this was a man\nwho was the head of this Polish underground, AK, armia kryova, the home army. And he\nwas a friend, we went to school together. But nevertheless, I was a Jew, and the armia\nkryova, the home army didn\u2019t accept Jews, and when I came to him that he should\nincorporate my group -- because later I became the commandant of my Jewish group.\nNow, we had -- the highest number of our group was 125, but in this time we had about\n69, because we started to be killed, killed, killed. Not by Germans, we were mostly killed\nby Poles. So when I saw that we are being killed, and I find out that he is the leader, so I,\nthrough messengers I sent him, I want to have a meeting with him, and when I had the\nmeeting, I offered that we have al-almost 70 people, young people, and we want to join\nhis group, and I even told him that he can use us to the most dangerous -- [clock chiming]",
        "Q: That\u2019s the clock here in the room, but --",
        "A: So -- so he can use us to the most dangerous actions, because we didn\u2019t have for to\nlose. But we would be pro-protected from this Polish underground. So I figured because\nhe was my schoolmate, and he\u2019s the leader, so I will have a chance that he will accept us.\nAnd we -- this is also a long story, I have it in the book, and we had the first meeting.\nWhen we had the meeting, he shot me from behind, he shot me fo -- his brother, actually,\nwith him together. They shot me four times. Three bullet entered my neck, one in my\nhand, I fell down, that I\u2019m -- and I was sure that I would be dead, that I am dead, I felt\ndizzy. And -- and -- so then, when I came -- when I -- the --",
        "Q: Bird is singing [indecipherable]",
        "A: So -- so, okay?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So -- so when I came -- and so when I came to him, I had already a false document\nwhich I got from a monsignor, and my name became -- a-a-again -- after -- now, people\nask, \u201cYou were shot, so what happened?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I was not dead, otherwise I\nwouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d So, but I killed him. Laying on the floor, I shot him, and his brother,\nand then later I knew I cannot be any more with my group, because they started to look\nfor my group, and they -- and I thought my group would suffer on account of me, because\nthey knew I did it. So I went to a different section, and I became a member of this\norganization with my name as Tadosh Yadduch.",
        "Q: You were a changed man at that time?",
        "A: Changed in what? In what -- in what way?",
        "Q: In the way you felt about things. Revenge seems to have become an important theme\nat this point.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Revenge was very important for me, and the revenge was important for a\nfew reasons, but the main reason was, when my father was shot in the ghetto, the 28\" of\nApril, 1942, I witnessed it. And when he was shot by the Gestapo, before he died, he said\nwhat a Jew usually says before he dies, God is [indecipherable], we call it the shema\nIsrael. And then he said -- the last words were, \u201cNakuma, nakuma, nem nakuma.\u201d\u2019 It\nmeans, revenge, revenge, take revenge. Now, he said it in such a voice, that it was not a\nnatural voice, it was something that 1t came from heaven, an unnatural voice, which I --\ntil today, it is already almost 70 years, I can still hear his voice yelling to take revenge.\nAnd this gave me strength to survive. I said, \u201cI must survive to take revenge.\u201d For this\nreason, revenge was so important for me. Some people say so what is revenge? Revenge\nis nothing. Not for me, ben when you started to think, everyone who has a family, and if\nhe would started to think that all his family were killed by certain people, and they were\nnot only killed, before they were killed, they were tortured. Hunger, beating, starvation,\nand then finally killed, and you will say, \u201cWell, if I can get these men, I am going to kill\nthem.\u201d Sure now, in 1999, you don\u2019t think about it, because we are normal people, la --\nwe live in America. But in this time, the only dream I had is to take revenge. And for this\nreason, revenge was so important. Only -- also, this was my father\u2019s -- the legacy what I\ngot from my father. Also, revenge was important, I had five sisters. My five sisters were\nmarried. They had little children. I was very close to the children, we lived together. And\nwhen I started to think, there\u2019s a little girl, her name was Blimcha, she was three and a\nhalf years. She was like an angel, with gold curled hairs. And if I start to think that this\ngirl had to be killed, and the others, I had 21 people. Why were they killed? For no -- not\nbecause they were bad, they were killed just because they were Jews. And if I survived,\nand if I wouldn\u2019t take -- I was the only survivor, and maybe if they are in heaven, I don\u2019t\nknow, they would s -- or -- or before they were killed, they knew, because I always was\nthe one who went down from the ghetto, brought food, and brought them candy. And if\nthey would be killed, they would say, \u201cWell, Naftali will take care on it.\u201d And they\nprobably thought about it, that I would take care on it. If they are in heaven, which I\ndon\u2019t know if they are, this is a different story, if they are, and if they look down, and\nthey said -- and they looked at me and said, I was the survivor, the survivor to take\nrevenge, and if wouldn\u2019t take revenge, I will be a traitor, I would be a disappointment for\nthem, because I was the only one. So I had to take revenge. Now, after the war, after I\ncame to America, I still take revenge. But I cannot go out, take bodily revenge, physical\nrevenge. So my revenge is that I survived the war to tell the story, to tell the cruelties, to\ntell the murdering things. This is my revenge, and maybe this is the reason I survived.\nOtherwise, why did I survive, why not the other people? But this is the reason that I\nsurvived. In the war it was a physical revenge. Now the revenge is, like I\u2019m speaking to\nyou, I give other testimonies, I go to schools. I go -- people ask me -- if somebody asked\nme to speak about the Holocaust, I am always ready. I never took a penny, people want to\npay me, I said, \u201cNo, this is not a thing that I want to get paid.\u201d Y -- I have to do it, so long\nas I am alive, because in a few years there will not be survivors. And who knows? If now\nwe have deniers, where we are still alive, what will be a few years later? So my duty is to\ntell and retell the cruelties. To tell the stories, because I was a witness. I was there.",
        "Q: We will talk about that more, about your work, your legacy, a little later. Let me just\nask you this, in your videotaped interview, you also gave another reason that might have\nhelped you to -- to get through this.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: A letter from your -- from your mother.",
        "A: See, well people ask me -- everybody had a reason why he survived, had a legacy. I\nhad two legacies, and I said I must survive. The first legacy was that my father said\nrevenge, revenge, reven -- this I said, I must live to take revenge, because if -- if my\nfather is in heaven, as we believe, how would I be able to face him, he ask me, \u201cDid you\ndo something, did you take revenge because they shot me?\u201d I did. Maybe I didn\u2019t take\nenough revenge, looking back, I didn\u2019t take enough, but I did. The second legacy was\nwhen my mother was taken from the town of Jheshuf, from the ghetto, cause we were\ntaken from Kolbushova, from a small town to a larger town, to Jheshuf, where they\ngathered more Jews, to be able to send them to a death camp. And when she was taken to\nBelzyce, to the death camp, with all her five sis -- daughters, with the son-in-laws, with\nher grandchildren, somehow she gave somebody a letter. She could give a letter, and I\nwas on this time in a camp, and they brought the letter to me. And I remember -- I don\u2019t\nhave the letter, I would give everything to have the letter, but I don\u2019t have it. But I\nremember the words. And she wrote to me, \u201cYou are the youngest of my nine children,\nand you know always the youngest is the smartest,\u201d in their eyes. \u201cYou are young, you\nare strong, you are smart. You go and survive the war, because after the war, you go to\nAmerica, and tell to El,\u201d I had a brother already in America. \u201cTell to El,\u201d his name was\nEl, \u201cwhat the murderers did to us. Go to Palestine.\u201d I had a brother in Palestine, David.\n\u201cGo to David, and tell him what the murderers did to us. Go to the world, and tell the\nworld what the murderers did to us.\u201d She se -- she also wrote, \u201cLet your being an orphan\nnot break you. Go out, fight, be strong, and survive.\u201d This gave me a o-other s -- reason\nto survive, and for this reason, from the first minute when I was liberated, when people\ndidn\u2019t want to tell stories about the Holocaust, from the first minute, I spoke. People, in\nthe beginning, didn\u2019t like it. They looked at me and they saw this is an obsession, that I\nspeak about the Holocaust, but I spoke. People who survived, they didn\u2019t want to speak.\nIt took a long time til they started to speak in the 60\u2019s and the 70\u2019s. I spoke about the\nHolocaust in \u201945, and \u201946, but people didn\u2019t want to listen. When I came to America,\nwhen I told the people, they thought I\u2019m crazy. They didn\u2019t want to listen. This was the\nlegacy from my mother. So those two legacies were the most important thing. It wasn\u2019t\nimportant that if I am alive, and not alive. So other men will s -- survive. I never -- I\nnever thought that being alive was such an important thing as a personal thing, that I am\nalive. But a pers -- the important thing were those two legacies that I could fulfill.",
        "Q: Maybe we should flip the tape over at this point. So this is the end of the first tape of\nan interview with Norman Salsitz, and the end of side A.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Norman Salsitz. This is tape number one, side B. I would like you to -- to go back to\nthe time just before liberation. When -- when was that, where were you, and what kinds\nof state of mind, and physical health were you in at that time? J-Just before liberation,\nwherever you want to go.",
        "A: Well, before liberation -- this was in July, 1944. Now, we were left from 125 Jews --\nI\u2019m not talking about the town, the town was gone. The town was liquidated July the\nseventh, 1942, they were taken to Jheshuf, and Jheshuf to Belzyce, they were killed. But\nthen later on we get some people together, and finally we were 125, and from the 125\nthey started to kill us, and mostly Polish people killed us. And in the book I describe\nthere some raids they made on us. And in -- in July \u201944, we were left only six people\nfrom the whole group.",
        "Q: Who were they\u201d?",
        "A: The six people -- this was -- I was there with my brother, my older brother Lyebish.\nHe was 16 years older. Then were two brothers, Lybovitch. One was Lyba, and one was\nHerschel. And the Lyba actually, if not Lyba, we wouldn\u2019t survive, because he was a\nvillage Jew, and his profession was he was a trapper before the war, and he knew the\nwoods. And I described what things -- he lived I-like a woodsman, and to me he -- his --\nhis -- he was like a -- a deer. He was -- he was like -- like a animal. Not an animal in a\nbad sense, but he knew all those things, h-he could [indecipherable]. So, on account of\nhim, we could survive. And his older brother was with him, so there were Lyba and his\nbrother, I and my bro -- and there were two from my town. One was Lyebish Nestel, one\nwas Connor. And the -- and the two were cousins, and they survived with us all the war.\nSo happens that they were -- the -- the other one was Naftali Connor. And they were\nreligious Jews. During all the time when we were -- they were with me in the ghetto, they\nwere with me in the camp, they were with me in the woods. And during all the time, they\ndidn\u2019t eat anything that it was not kosher -- it means it was not for Jews. So they only ate\na piece of bread, some fruit, vegetables if they had. If we had meat, they wouldn\u2019t eat it.\nIf we killed a deer, or we killed a rabbit, they wouldn\u2019t eat it. But anyway, they survived.\nAnd after, when they -- the -- when -- when we were liberated in -- in the end of July, so\nthey said, \u201cWe -- we are liberated. No more Germans. We are going home.\u201d And they\nthought they would come home, they will be looked on like on heroes. They survived\nfrom the whole war -- Jewish community. And they came home to my town three days\nafter they were liberated, this Polish AK, the Polish underground, took them, they wer --\nthey saw them. And they took them, and they shot them. After going through hell, losing\ntheir family, starving, everything, they were killed. And they were killed by very\nprominent people, not peasants. By two people -- and I know the people who killed them.\nOne, his name was Vladiswav Kishel. He was before the war, dir -- director of the\ninternal revenue in -- in Kolbushova, for te -- the text director. Intelligent person. The\nsecond one was Jellinsky. Jellinsky had a bus company in our town. He lived all his life\nwith Jews, because the Jews were traveling in the bus. They belonged to this\norganization. This organization took over the leadership for the first few days, before the\nRussians organized their own leadership. And they saw the two Jews, and they killed\nthem. From the whole group, so we were left only six. Now, I -- I ga --",
        "Q: How -- how did you hear about that?",
        "A: Well, I heard it right away, because when they went -- came to our town, they -- I told\nthem not to go, because I knew that nothing good -- because they killed so many during\nthe war, and when they went there -- then later, the Polish people between themselves,\neverybody knew about it, because this was not done in secret. They took them openly,\nand they took them to the river by the cemetery, and they shot them. And -- and the\npeople who were in my -- in our town, they told me this [indecipherable] not only one, a\nfew of them. There were some people who were very sympathetic, and they told me.\nNow, the reason, later -- and I wrote this in my book, and naturally the people are very\nangry in -- in my town why I wrote it about it, and they said to me, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have\nwrite it, because 1n case this book will be -- will be translated into Polish, this Kishel\nhas,\u201d -- he\u2019s now 85 years, he lives in the town, he had grandchildren. So the\ngrandchildren will find out that their grandfather was a murderer. So I shouldn\u2019t -- I\nshould retract it, I should write a article that is not true. They said he killed doesn\u2019t mean\nanything, but the children shouldn\u2019t know that he was a murderer. This what they wrote\nto me when the book came out. Now, I found out -- the reason why, which I understand,\nthe reason why -- why in this Kishel, who was the director of the internal revenue, he\nvolunteered he should kill them, because there were the group of the ar -- of the AK\nmembers, and when they caught the two Jews, he volunteered to kill them. Now, why\nshould he volunteer to kill them? The -- the -- the -- the reason was that this one of them,\nLyebish Nestel, he was such a nice person, a scholar. You see, both of them were\nrabbinical students, they were very intelligent people. So before the war, when the war\nblew out, he was in the active Polish army, and his unit, his regiment was sent over to the\nGerman border, because they had to protect Poland. And he was, and he was a very good\nsoldier. Now, also Kishel, the director of the internal revenue was in the reserve, he was\nan officer. And he was also in the same unit. And when the Germans attacked Poland,\nnaturally the units started to pull back. And they came to a small town in -- near the\nGerman border, near Katovitz. And this was -- mostly there were Jews, so the Kishel\nknew this Lyebish Nestel, so he said to him, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you go to the Jews, where\nyou are a Jew, and get two Hassidic coats [indecipherable], and we will change our\nuniform, and we will go home.\u201d To change as being Jews. This what he told to Lyebish\nNestel. So Lyebish Nestel said to him -- and this was his officer -- and a Polish guy, a\npatriot. So Lyebish Nestel told him, \u201cI will not do it. Iam in the army. I came here to\nprotect my country, to fight for my country. I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Kishel looked at him, and\nthat\u2019s -- this was it. Two days later, Kishel disappeared. He didn\u2019t know what a --\nprobably he did it on his own, he run away. Lyebish Nestel was fighting, fighting, til they\ncame near Lublin. This was deep into the Polish countryside, and he was taken as a\nprisoner by the Germans, as a soldier. Somehow, usually if Jews were taken as prisoners,\nthey didn\u2019t survive, because the Germans killed them. Somehow he run away. He run\naway, he came to our town, and he told everybody the story. He told the story how is it\npossible that Kishel -- and Kishel disappeared, nobody knew where he is -- where he was.\nNaturally, Lyebish was with me in the ghetto, he was with me in the camp, he was with\nme two years in the woods, and he got killed. Kishel disappeared. After the war, Kishel\nbecame very important because he was a leader in the AK, in the underground, and he\nwas not any more inter -- internal revenue, he was older, he had got married. He -- he had\nchildren. He lives now in a town in Poland. And I wrote his stories. They are now angry\nwhy I told his story. I told his story because this 1s the truth. So those two were killed. So\nfrom the six, only four survived. Now, from the four, from the four, six months later,\nLyba, who was our savior, who was the trapper, was poisoned in our -- in the village,\nthere he was -- there he was poisoned, he died. His brother Herschel was older, he went\nto Palestine before it -- Israel, and he died in Israel. Lyebish, my brother, came to\nAmerica, and he died in 1965, as a -- got the heart attack, he died. So I am the only one\nalive from our group, and there were very, very seldom places that Jews organized. So\nhappens we organized in the woods, nobody survives that. I have to tell those stories.\nNow, I know every one who got killed. I even wanted to write a book that everybody\u2019s\ndead. How it was, how he was killed, how he was betrayed -- mostly they were betrayed\nby Poles. Maybe I will do it yet. Why? Because I\u2019m the only one who wa -- I\u2019m alive.\nAnd if I would not be alive, nobody would know the stories. I tell to the families. If they\nhave somebody [indecipherable] how they were with me in the woods, and how they\ndied. So from the 125, I am only one alive.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back then, and talk a little bit about your personal liberation. How did it\nhappen, and what -- what did you do afterwards?",
        "A: Well, when my bi -- liberation is, that when it was -- this was after -- after I had to\nescape from the AK, because like I said to you, I was a member in the AK, and there\nwere a few things, I don\u2019t know if you want me to tell you why I left the AK and came\nback to my brother. So the -- this -- this was -- okay, so -- so I came back, an -- I was\nabout a week or two weeks, but we already saw that it is the end. Why\u2019? Because we saw\nEricthsook. We saw that the Germans soldiers are coming, and they -- the army, and th-\nthey occupied the villages with their equipment. Every day more and more and more\nGerman soldiers. And we were in this time in hiding, because we didn\u2019t have a group any\nmore. So we knew -- and then we started to hear cannons. In every -- the night, the\ncannons were louder and louder, so we knew that this is the end, but how can we survive\ntil the end, because in the last minute -- we suffered for six years, in the last minute we\nwill be killed. So my brother, with one of those Lybovitch went to a friendly Pole, that\nwe used to go once in awhile to hide there, and they were with them, and I went with\nLyba to look, to see, to different peasants. Because we didn\u2019t know exactly, we knew it\u2019s\ncoming, but we didn\u2019t know exactly. So I went with Lyba to a peasant, his name was\nYanhodor. I had described him, he was very good, he was very friendly, he and his\nchildren. So we went to his house, and then we went -- we s -- we heard a unit of\nCalvary, German Calvary is going t -- he was -- the road was right next to his house, near\nthe woods. And the Calvary is going, you could hear the chains, and the horses. So we\nrun in -- in the -- in the barn, or where they was -- the hay, and we buried ourselves under\nthe hay, and then we -- so we heard that the soldiers coming in, opened the door, and they\ntaking out hay for their -- for the horses. So we were afraid that they would take away\neverything, we will be discovered. But we were not discovered, and after the -- the calva\n-- the units went, so we came out. We s -- we di -- we wanted to ask how the war is going\non, but he wasn\u2019t home, because when he saw that it is already so bad. So he, with his\nfamily, he took the few cows, and they were run into the forests to hide. So they were not\nhome. So, when we went out -- so we said, \u201cWell, we have to go to see what our brothers\nare doing,\u201d because my brother was with his brother, but the woman, her name was Mary\npren -- Prenetta. So we went -- we went to go out to see. As we came out from the woods\nwhere we were, and there was a big clearing, and we had to go over to the other side,\nwhere my brother, with his brother were. As we came out on the clearing, people started\nto shoot at us from both sides. Here in this side for where we lived, were the Germans,\nand the other side of the clearings were already the Russians. And when they saw two\npeople, they didn\u2019t know who we are. And both started to shoot millions of bullets. And\nthis was at night, and I just see bullets like -- like slow bugs, red, light [indecipherable].\nAnd so, we were afraid, so st -- luckily there was a small -- not a river, 1t was some water,\nwe jumped in in the water. And the -- the -- the -- the shooting stopped, and there were\nhaystacks, because this was in the time when they cut the hay, this was -- so we went in\nin the haystacks to cover ourselves. The shooting stopped, and then we didn\u2019t know\nwhere, what, when. We knew that there is a shooting between us. So when -- suddenly\nthere were two horses -- two riders on one horse, from a distance, and it was at night. So\nLyba, my friend, says, \u201cOh, I know those peasants.\u201d And he even said to me their name is\n-- one name is Poslooshnid. And he remembers even the horse, because he sold them the\nhorse before the war. Now, \u201cGo,\u201d he said, \u201cask them. Because if I\u2019m going to ask them,\nthey know I am a Jew, they could kill me. But you go, they don\u2019t know who you are.\u201d\nAnd I was dressed like a peasant, no shoes, with a jacket, and -- and I run up to them, and\nthey were on a -- two on a horse, and I -- I couldn\u2019t see who they are. And I started to y --\nto yell, Parnyi Poslooshnid, Poslooshnid. They heard me, they stopped. And when I run\nto them, and I come to them, and I saw on the horse, there are two SS men on the horse.\nAnd they -- and naturally they were dr-dressed, with the helmet, but in the distance I saw\na silhouette. So when they saw me, I s -- I didn\u2019t know what to do. To run away it was\ntoo late, ba -- so they jumped down from the horse, right away took out their guns, and\nthey start asking who I am. Now, I didn\u2019t want to say that I speak German, because\nusually Jews spoke German, not peasants. And I started to tell them with a crying voice,\nyou know, what will I do, my wife is in the woods, my children in the woods. They say\nthe Russians are raping the women, and I start -- so I could see that one of them\nunderstands Polish. Probably he was from Salazzi or something, and I could hear that\nhe\u2019s translating to the other soldier what I am saying. And when I saw that he\u2019s\ntranslating, so I started to cry more, and I said, \u201cHelp me, help me. We were with the\nGermans, nothing happened to us, an -- and now the Russians will come in a,\u201d -- well, so\nhe said -- the [indecipherable] he listened to me. So then he said to his -- so the other man\nsaid to him in German, which I understood, he said, \u201cNow, we don\u2019t have to go.\u201d\nBecause they were a patrol to see wa -- from where the Russian. We don\u2019t have to go --\nbecause they were afraid for themselves, too. Let\u2019s take him to our headquarters, and he\nwill tell us everything what we have to know. And they said to me, the guy, in Polish, to\ngo in front of them into -- they will take me. So -- and they went back on the horse, put\nback their revolvers in their holster, they had rifles, they were back in the\n[indecipherable] and I had to go in front. Now, I knew that if I would go there, I would be\nkilled. Why? Because I had a jacket, and underneath the jacket I had a belt, and on the\nbelt I had the revol -- I had the revolver, I had hand grenades, I had a hatchet, I had a\nbayonet, I have a flashlight. I have everything I had on me. Now when -- they didn\u2019t see\nit, because it was the -- the jacket covered it. But I always had a revolver, and the\nrevolver with the long barrel, remember, parabellum, I had. No, it wasn\u2019t a parabellum, it\nwas a -- a revolver. [indecipherable], and I always had it not in my holster, but I have it --\nhad it in front of me in my belt, stuck in my belt. And as they went back on the horse, I\nfigure -- I said, \u201cThis 1s my chance.\u201d I turned around, pulled out the revolver, and I\nemptied right away, all seven bullets to them, they fell down dead. And as I started to\nshoot, then you could see millions of bullets came from both sides. They didn\u2019t know\nwho is shooting, they saw shooting. So, you could see it. But luckily, they didn\u2019t hit me. I\nw -- I bend down, I had an even -- I [indecipherable] took away their revolvers, and --\nand -- and I took the horse, and I kept the horse from the side where the bullets are\ncoming in case a bullet will hit, it will kill the horse, and I moved over to the side, not\nfrom where I came, but I moved over to the opposite side. And I went over because I\nfigured why should I go here, here are the Germans, and there who know, maybe the\nRussians. I went over there, and as I came closer to the woods, and I saw a few came out,\nis a -- Russians, said to me to lift -- to raise my hand, and they looked at me, and they ask\nme who I am, so I said, \u201cI am a Polish partisan.\u201d I spoke Russian. And they took away\nthe revolvers, and they said, \u201cWe have to take you to our comman -- commander.\u201d And\nwe went to the commander, and I told him the whole story, and he was very -- see, I\ndidn\u2019t know if they would believe me, so I said, \u201cI have a friend here, I have to go, and\nwe have more people. I have to tell them what\u2019s going on, that the Russians are here.\u201d\nAnd I still didn\u2019t know if they believed me. I remember even I asked them -- I ask them\nto give me a star, what they have on their hearts a star, to give me a star to show it to my\nfriends that I met the Russians, because they [indecipherable]. They gave me back my\nrevolver, and they -- and I said I will go back with them. And when I went away from\nthis [indecipherable], I was sure that they would shoot me. I was sure they don\u2019t believe\nme. And in ma -- I remember when I walked, it\u2019s like I would walk on air, so that I knew\nthat I -- any second a bullet will come in. But they didn\u2019t shoot me, and I went back to\nmy friend, he was laying there in the haystack. When he saw me, he started to kiss me,\nbecause he heard the shots, and he thought that I was shot. He didn\u2019t know that I shot\nthem. And -- so we already knew that on this side are the Russians, on this side are\nGermans, so he took me -- he had the old friend, a woman -- a old woman, and he said,\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to her.\u201d And we went over to her, and we went up on the attic, nobody saw us.\nAnd in -- before -- before, in the morning, he -- we hear the door opens, and a Russian\nsoldier comes in with a -- with a pat. And he comes in, and -- and -- when we saw -- I\nsaw a Russian soldier, I jumped down. He said, \u201cI came here, there\u2019s a cow I want to\nmilk for some -- I want to milk the cow.\u201d And I grabbed him, and I dance with him. I said\n[indecipherable]. He said, \u201cYes, during the night, my unit came into this village, and we\noccupy this village, my unit is here.\u201d And he -- -- an-and we have the -- so this was the\nmoment that I knew that I am liberated, the Russians are there. Now, I went right away\nwith him. I said, \u201cAnd you take me to your commander.\u201d And I told him I\u2019m from a\nJewish group. Him, I was not afraid any more to say [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t say I was a\nJew. But Lyba, he didn\u2019t go with me. He still was afraid, he was very, very careful. He\nsaid, \u201cI will not go with you,\u201d and he was still on the attic hiding. He was hiding I don\u2019t\nknow how long, and I went out, then later I called him, and then we went to see -- this\nwas already the territory liberated, and I went to see my brother. And I came, and I saw\nmy brother sitting with his brother, but they were not any more on the attic hiding. They\nwere sitting in the kitchen with their [indecipherable], and there in the kitchen were also\nabout four or five girls, uniforms, Russian officers, because they had a field hospital\nthere, and with the fee -- and they were doctors in the field hospital, and we started to talk\nin between the -- the four or five girls, two of them were Jewish. And we told them that\nwe were li -- we were in this, and we -- we were and this was how we were liberated.\nBut, I didn\u2019t go back to my town, because I knew that if I will go back to my town, I\nwould be killed, because they knew that I killed those two Augustin brothers. That I\nkilled them in my self defense, this didn\u2019t mean anything. So, I didn\u2019t go back to my\ntown. The other two went, and they were killed, and we went on, my brother and I, we\nwent to Jheshuf, to a larger town, where Jews who were liberated, came from different\nvillages, from different towns, and they came with a guard up there. Now, Lyba and\nHerschel, the two, they didn\u2019t go with us, because they were village Jews. So they still\nremained in the village to be there living with the peasants. This was the day, the night I\nwas liberated.",
        "Q: Before we go on to talk a little bit more what -- what happened then, what did\nliberation feel like to you? There was the moment of joy when you saw --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- the Russian soldier, but it was not that simple, was it?",
        "A: Well, when it was -- when I saw the Russian soldiers, it was a moment of joy that I\nwas liberated. But a moment later, it was a very sad moment. And the sad moment was --\nI actually started to cry, the sad moment was, I am liberated, but what happened to my\npeople? Where are my sisters? Where are my whole family? So I am liberated, so I will\nbe fr -- see, my personal life was not so important. Important was that they were not\nalive, and specially the children. So my brother was with me. Now, I couldn\u2019t -- [ -- I -- I\nthought about the people who were killed, but I also thought how my brother feels,\nbecause he lost the same family, but he also lost a wife and three children. So he was\nmuch more in pain, because his wife and three children, which he loved very much. And\nthere were a child from 12 years, child from 10 years, and a girl from seven years. So he -\n- but he didn\u2019t talk too much about it. The pain he kept inside. And this was a very bad --\nto me, I had to go through it more. Th-the pain was when I was libera -- 1t was not a\nglorious time, because I couldn\u2019t believe that I am alive, this is the first thing. I -- it -- it\nwas like -- like my mind was someplace else. I was glad when I came to Jheshuf, if I --\nsome people survived. It was not a happy time, because everybody started to speak what\nwe lost. Now we are here, what now? What do we do now? We are single people, without\nthe family, and naturally we moved in. One of our friends was from this town, we took\nover his apartment, and we all moved in with him. We lived together because nobody had\na family. And there were two Polish women who helped them survive. So they became\nthe -- the -- the persons who cooked for us, and we lived together for a short time.",
        "Q: What -- what kind of -- were you in halfway decent physical shape, what -- how --",
        "A: In physical shape, I was in physical shape. The reason why I was in physical shape\nwas -- the others were not in physical shape. I was in physical shape for two reasons. The\nfirst thing is that I just came back from the AK. In the AK we had everything. When I\nwas in the woods with my gun, as a Jew, I had to -- I only could go out when it was a\nheavy rain, and blizzard, snow. I never walked out when the moon was shining. The\nmoon was our biggest enemy. So -- but then later, when I came to the AK, I was a hero.\nWhen we came to the villages, the girls kissed us, the girls brought us the most best food,\nand the people. We were heroes, we were the -- we were the same people. We wanted to\nfight the Germans the same way. So there I had a lot of food, and not -- and -- and -- and\nI was not in bad physical -- I had to dress -- I had in this time, a -- a jacket, pants. I -- I --\nI -- it was not so bad. Well, before I left for the AK, we were infested with lice\n[indecipherable]. But then I could go out, and I could wash. My brother was by this\n[indecipherable], but he was a very strong man. He was exceptional. By us, 1n our town,\nbefore the war, if somebody wanted to give an example of strength, they always\nmentioned him. He was very strong boy. Not that he was a fighter, but he was known\n[indecipherable]. So his physical was not bad. What others who survived, they came out,\nthey\u2019re like skeletons. They were laying underground for -- for a year, two years, like in a\n-- like in a -- ina grave. And th-they had a little food what somebody gave them, if they\ndidn\u2019t kill them. So mostly people came, and some couldn\u2019t even walk. They walked --\nwhen they walked, they walked like -- like on all four. They were -- because they were\nnot used to work, because they were laying in a grave for two years. And when they\nsuddenly had to go up, and to stand up on their feet, they couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: When you say in the grave, do you mean from concentration camps?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no. I\u2019m not talking now concentration camps, I\u2019m talking now by\npeople who survived in hiding. I\u2019m not talking concentration camps. So where they were\nin hiding, la -- the people came out, from the first few days, where -- who were the\npeople? They were the people who were -- had some friendly -- or for money, who were\nhidden. So they came out. So we gathered in this town. Then, we didn\u2019t have yet people\nfrom concentration, because the concentrations were not liberated yet. We didn\u2019t have the\npeople who were -- survived in -- in Siberia. They didn\u2019t come yet. We had some people\nwho survived like my wife, on illegal papers, and now the Russians came out, so they\ncame, they saw Jews that they came. They still were on illegal papers. They didn\u2019t want\nto come out, because they didn\u2019t know what will go on. But they came to 1-indentify\nthemselves, but most the people the first few days, most the people were people who\ncame out from hiding.",
        "Q: This is a good place to stop. Tape number one, side B, the end.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a conintua -- this is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum interview with Norman Salsitz. This is tape number two, side A. So, how -- how\nlong, approximately, did you remain in that town or village, and what happened -- what\nhappened then?",
        "A: Well, this was not a village, it was a town. As a matter of fact, now it\u2019s a very big\ntown, and it\u2019s the head of -- the capital of a state, Jneshuf. Now, I was there --",
        "Q: Just one second, I have to rearrange the microphone just a little bit, so -- just one\nsecond. Okay, yes, that\u2019s good.",
        "A: We lived there a few weeks. We didn\u2019t have money after we came out, so my brother\nstarted to do business, he started to make some money. And -- but ma -- with me, I\nalways wanted to fight, to be involved in the war, so I -- I went, and I volunteered. I\nvolunteered t -- it was very unusual for a Jewish survivor to volunteer, because Poland in\nthis time, nem -- organized -- the army was organized Russia, but Poland\n[indecipherable]. They took in my years -- where they -- they were born in 1920, to the\narmy, but they didn\u2019t take Jews. Not because they didn\u2019t want to take Jews, but they\ndidn\u2019t have no evidence about the Jews, they didn\u2019t know who survived, and very few\nsurvived. So actually, they didn\u2019t mobilize, they didn\u2019t draft the Jewish boys. But I\nwanted, definitely to be part of it. So -- and also, 1t happened once, it a -- it was a -- a-- a\nepisode that I went in to a barber. I have this story in the book. I went into a barber, and I\n-- I suspected everybody was a killer. Like naturally, if I would be the ge -- in Germany,\nwhen I was in Germany, I looked on everybody, and everybody I thought, \u201cWas he the\nkiller of my mother, of my sisters?\u201d But in Poland, even, they were so against our groups,\nthat they -- I suspected that the majority, they didn\u2019t like Jews. So when I went over once,\nto a barber, and there were -- there were people -- there were people sitting there and\nwaiting in line for the barber, and I looked at them, and I looked at the faces, I didn\u2019t\nknow them. So I looked at the faces, and I thought they all looked at me that they\nrecognize I am a Jew. Maybe they recognize, maybe I was not dressed the same way as\nthey. And -- and this was after I came out from -- from the woods. And -- and I -- Is -- I\nstart to think maybe I made a bad mistakes, that I came over here to this barber, and who\nknows what they will do to me? And little by little, the fear built up, in -- in -- in me, and\nwhen I t -- came my m-mind that I should go to the chair to be shaved and cut the hair. So\n-- but I went over there, and then later -- he cut my hair, and then later we star -- he\nwanted to shave, and he put in some cream, or some soap on my face, and when -- when\nhe took the -- the -- to -- to cut -- to shave me, the blade -- the razor blade -- I thought that\nI see that all the people who are sitting around the chairs, that all are winking to him, and\nthey said, \u201cNow, now.\u201d It was so the fear, this was when I came out, and -- and I was sure\nthat this what they are doing, which later I find out they didn\u2019t. But I thought so. An as --\nas he -- he was finish with the -- with the cream on my face, and he took the razor blade,\nand he wanted to shave me, he started to shave my neck, I grabbed his hand, and -- and I\nstood up, and I run out. Even my face was -- was filled with -- was -- now I run out, and -\n- and -- and -- and when I -- when I came out, and I ran a -- where we lived, and I said to\nmy brother, who was -- like I said, I am going to the army, I want to be one more day,\nbecause this gave me so much fear. Now later, I was -- when I was in this town, later I\nwas ashamed to go to pass his store, because I was ashamed what I did, because I knew\nthat this was not -- but they were sitting there, they couldn\u2019t understand why I had run\naway in the middle. But to da -- we will -- I lived with so much fear, because everybody\nwas killed.",
        "Q: Did your brother want to join you with the army, too?",
        "A: No, no, my brother never thought -- and don\u2019t forget, he was 16 years older, and he\nwas not a man like to join, he was not like a -- a -- advent -- to like adventuristic, what I\nam -- he -- he had a wife, with three children, they were killed. He was not -- so he was --\nhe started to do business. And then I went -- I went and I volunteered, and because I\nvolunteered, I had a choice to pick out the -- the part, which unit I want to be, and I\nwanted to be a pilot, because I thought being a pilot, I would be able to bomb German\ntowns, and to take more revenge. So because I was a volunteer, they gave me some\ncertain test, in front the whole group, a few of them were accepted to them -- to -- to the\nair force school, which was in this time in Quibishevo, in Siberia, they didn\u2019t have in\nPoland, they had this air force military school. So when -- when they picked me out, I m -\n- asked the doctor -- there was a young, Russian doctor, and I asked him how come that I\nwas -- I pass all the tests, when they were such strong Polish boys who never had hunger,\nand this and that, and they were not accepted, and I was accepted. He said, \u201cWell, this is\nthe reason, because you went through so much, and nothing bothers you.\u201d And I was\naccepted, and I was sent over a few days later, where I got orders to go -- to go to q --\nQuibishevo, which first we had to go to Lublin, where in this time was the temporary --\nthe temporary capital of Poland, and there we gathered together the whole group, I think\nit was about 400 from the whole to -- country. And then we waited for a transport to go to\nQuibishevo, to go to join this officer\u2019s school, which, there is a -- [clock chiming]. But\nthat is a other story why I didn\u2019t go, and I\u2019m writing this story that I didn\u2019t go, but I was\nin the army, and I was transferred to a different, special unit, and -- because they wanted\nthat -- I told them from where I am, so they wanted I should be in the -- in the\nintelligence, in this section, because I knew the territory, I knew the people. And I was\nsent back to Jheshuf, he ripped up the paper, this man who was in -- who was a colonel.\nHe said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t go,\u201d I was afraid that I will go to jail, that I don\u2019t go where I\nwas sent. So he said to me not to be afraid, and [clock chiming].",
        "Q: The clock is really getting us here.",
        "A: It\u2019s alright. So -- so -- and then I was sent back to this town, and this is how I became\na member of this intelligent group.",
        "Q: T-T-Two questions. You were there with a Polish identity?",
        "A: Well, when I -- no, when I joined the army -- when I went, and I volunteered, I alre --\nI took back my own identity, and I took my own identity as Naftali Salishitz, where I\nfigured the war is ended, that\u2019s it. But, when -- when I changed -- I waited for this\ntransport to this air force group, and there 1s -- it\u2019s a long story, if you inter -- I\u2019m] -- I\njust wrote an article about it. And a girl saw me there, she recognized I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a Jew,\nwhate -- and she took me to her boss, who was a colonel, and he was the head personnel\nofficer, from -- from the army. And she introduced me to him, and he said, \u201cWell, don\u2019t\ngo there.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhy you going to the air force school?\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, I want\nto learn to be a pilot, to be able to -- to bomb Germany.\u201d He said, \u201cLook, this is already\nAugust in -- in \u201944, how long do you think we\u2019re -- the war will last? Maybe it\u2019Il last a\nother two or three months, maybe a half a year. As -- the school, 1-1t would take two\nyears. After two years, there wouldn\u2019t no -- be no war. So who would you bomb? So you\nwill -- you will waste two years.\u201d He said, \u201cI will give you a better job. You want to take\nrevenge? I will put you in a unit is -- that it is that Polish inf,\u201d -- it was called information\nunit, it was like then the military CIC, and intelligence, and he said, \u201cIf you want to take\nrevenge on the Germans, then you will be -- you will have a possibility.\u201d So I said to him,\n\u201cBut I already have a order to go to -- to Quibishevo.\u201d He said, \u201cWhere 1s the order?\u201d I\nshowed it him, and he took and ripped it up. I said, \u201cWhat are you doing, I will go to\njail.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry, I know what I am doing.\u201d He was then chief\npersonnel. So he called the sixth secretary, and she said, \u201cMake him out a new\ndocument.\u201d And he said -- what -- \u201cBut he cannot be on his name in this unit. So what\nname should it,\u201d -- so I told him my name was Tadosh Yadduch in the Polish\nunderground. He said, \u201cNo, 1f you were in the Polish underground, which they are\nenemies of our government, [indecipherable], you cannot have the same name. Tadosh is\nokay, it\u2019s a first name, but let\u2019s see about the second name.\u201d So we started to think about\nthe second name, my name 1s Salishitz, so I wanted to have Salishitz spelled like in\nPolish, so then I said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s about Szaleski [indecipherable]?\u201d She said, \u201cThis is a fine\nname. You will be Tadosh Szaleski right away on the spot.\u201d They made me out a new\nmilitary book, a new document, and he called the secretary, he said to the -- to her to\nwrite a letter to the head of the Polish [indecipherable] of the Polish army in Jheshuf, and\nhe wrote a letter which it was not true, he wrote, \u201cI know this man for a long time, he\u2019s a\nvery reliable man, and I want you should give him the best opportunity. Put him in a na --\nin -- in a leader\u2019s -- in a leadership position, in a [indecipherable].\u201d And -- and this 1s how\n-- I took this paper, and I went back, and this how I remained in Jheshuf, being in this --\nin this unit. And --",
        "Q: Do you remember his name, by any chance?",
        "A: Whose name?",
        "Q: The -- th-the commander?",
        "A: Sure. His name was Gorosh. Gorosh. I know the first name also, but his name was a --\nhe was -- he was the head of personnel from the [indecipherable].",
        "Q: And what did you do?",
        "A: Then --",
        "Q: In your position?",
        "A: In my pos -- in my position, I was -- when I came back to Jheshuf, I -- I was s -- they\nprepared -- they prepared a unit -- see, this was -- this was already about, I would say in\nend of October, beginning of November. So they prepared because -- for the last\noffensive, if you know -- the last offensive, because the front was stopped about 20\nkilometer past Jheshuf, and there was the front staying there for six months. They\nprepared the new offensive, which started January the 12\", 1945, and this was the last\nputsch so -- for Berlin. And we -- I was included 1n the -- in the group -- in the group, to\ntake over towns when we -- when the offensive will go, we will liberate towns from our\ngroup, they -- our people will take over the towns, because it was not a civil\nadministration. So the army would take it over, an then later the civil administration will\nbega -- and I was assigned to take over -- one to take -- to go to Krakow, was -- Krakow\nwas the second largest town, and the most historical town in Poland, and also the -- that\ndoctor -- th-the head of the government in -- in Poland was -- was in Krakow, so I was\nassigned to remain the Krakow, and -- and to be part of the Polish intelligence in Krakow.\nAnd then the w -- in the book I describe how I met my wife, and so th --",
        "Q: Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s do that -- let\u2019s do that over -- did you have a special mission when you\nwent to Krakow?",
        "A: Yes, well, the special mission is we should take over th-the -- the running, because\nthere was not administration -- civil administration. So the army would take it over. So I -\n- my -- the special mission was, when we came closer th -- because we went with the\nRussian front, and we were attached, hundred of us were attached to the first lines of the\nRussian front, because the front started offensive like I said, January the 12\", and we\nwere attached, and we were like -- like -- not like zion officers, but we were part of the --\nthe -- the front f-fighters, but we didn\u2019t do the fighting, but we went with them, they had\nto be straightened out with the local people, with the administration, yeah. So we went\nwith them, and I am describing this in details in the book, and then when we came before\nKrakow, and Krakow was a very, very important town, because the first thing it was the\nmost historical Polish town, because the capital, it was the capital, and it was the -- the\nplace of the kings. They lived in Krakow, and also it was the barbel. Barbel is the castle\nwhere all the kings lived, and they\u2019re buried. So we find out about three days before -- we\nwere before Krakow, s -- and this was the front was going, we went with the front, and\nthey -- did the Russian army went forwards, and the German went back. So, about three\ndays before we came before Krakow, and also Krakow was not ok -- was not taken -- like\nusually in a war, you go from the -- and this time we went from the east to the west, like\nthe army didn\u2019t go from east to the west. What they did, they wanted to surround, and to\ndestroy the rush -- the German garmi zone in Krakow. So what the Russian, was a very\nsmart thing what they did, they went -- before Krakow they went to the north, and then\nthey surrounded, and they came into Krakow from the west. Because, actually, they had\nto enter Krakow from the east, but they came 1n thr -- from the west, and we went with\nthem, and we went part of it, and in about three days before we were before Krakow, we\nfind out that Krakow is mined, that they put in mines in Krakow, with columns, with\nexplosives, and the -- and in any minute, the mi -- and -- and -- and their aim is to\nexplode the town, and to destroy the whole town. We knew about it, because we had the\nfifth c-columns that they are doing it. Now -- so they wanted to -- yes, and as we came to\nthe -- closer to Krakow from the west, so the Russian engineers, if -- f-find out that they\nalready found some installations with [indecipherable], where there were important\nbuildings, but they couldn\u2019t destroy the whole thing, because it\u2019s like -- like this was the\nend. So they could dismantle all -- detach the electricity from the end of houses, but this\nwas like -- like a snake. If you cut off a piece of tail of a snake, the whole snake 1s still\nalive. We had to know that central installation from where the whole town, the electricity\nis connected. So they picked out -- they picked out three officers to go to Krakow and to\nfind out. And this was before Krakow was even liberated, and th-the Russians picked out.\nNow I -- th -- I had very good recommendations, because like I told you that this man\nwrote to the leaders that he knows me, said I am special in this, I did so much during the\nunderground, you know. And then we picked out one -- a native Krakowian, who\nsurvived the war in -- in th -- in the Russia, and later he joined the Polish army, and he\ncame back with the Polish army, and so he -- wi -- and because he was a native\nKrakowian, and so he was very important, and then we -- they invi -- they picked out the\nother men with us, so three of us, we got the order to go in to see how we can find out\nwhere the people who -- who built those things are, maybe we can prevent from the\ndestruction. And we came into Krakow, this was winter, it was very cold. Remember, we\ncame into Krakow January the 17\". The Russians took over part, but the ar -- a big part\nwas still in the German hands, because officially, the town was liberated January the 19\",\nand we were there already the 17\", through channels, and je -- and also we had people in\nKrakow who were a fifth column for us. So we contacted some, and we find out that it\u2019s\ntrue, that the Germans want to destroy, and they built, in Krakow, they built columns on\nthe main thoroughfares -- the main streets, they built columns s -- f -- a story high, with\nfour feet in diameter, filled with dynamite. Everything was connected, and everything\nhad to be blown up with one push of a button. And -- and they had also mines, the main\npost office, and the railroad station, the [indecipherable] was -- was the king\u2019s castle. All\nthe most important building, everything was mined. Were 287 mines all together in\nKrakow, and this had to be destroyed with one push of a button, and we knew that the --\nif we will come closer th -- the -- this will happen. So, we were wor -- we worried very\nmuch. And we started to have leads where finally we find out -- and again, in the book I\nwrite a little more about it, you cannot have the whole book here. We find out that the --\nthat the company who made those columns, and those mines was done by an Austrian\ncompany, Meyerader and Krauss. And the Meyerader and Krauss isn\u2019t -- the headquarters\nwas on the street Yuloushalaya, and we find out, and this was a winter night, a blizzard,\ncold, and we went -- we sent over the three to find out if -- if they -- they -- we can find\nout something. They came back they couldn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t let in nobody, because every\nplace where there was a German company, they -- and this was in the most exclusive\nplace in Krakow, where the German took over, and then the next [indecipherable] was the\nGestapo, and -- and so he ba -- by -- those places there was a iron gate, and around the\niron gate there was a concrete bunker, with openings, with machine guns, they always did\nit there, and we sent over those, and th-they couldn\u2019t go in, the three guys, so we three\nwent, said, well we will go ourselves. And before we went there, as I cross the street I\nfind out that there is a -- a-apartments, that there was the Zunderdienst. Zunderdienst was\nauxiliary to the SS, which was from ethnic Germans. And we came in, the Zunderdienst\nleft, and there were about eight girls, and the girls were cooks, and not cooks, and\npartners to sleep and all those things, well -- so we came in, and we -- we had vodka, we\ncigarettes, and a -- w -- and we became very friendly with them, and they told us about\nthis building across the street from the Meyerade and Krauss. And they told us that the\nGermans left already, about two days ago, but they left over the secretary, and she\u2019s still\nthere. So a -- I couldn\u2019t understand how comes they left and they left the secretary, a\nGerman girl. She said, \u201cYeah, she\u2019s there, because they saw her after the Germans left.\u201d\nAnd I asked them how do you know that she was German? Oh she, they know because\nshe used to come after the curfew, and she used to be -- they brought her with the cars. So\nwe did -- the two -- the three who we sent didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t go in, so we went there, and\nwe knocked on the door, and nobody let us in, and so we were ready -- this was already\nstart to be dark, so we -- I wanted to -- to open th -- the door, to shut the door, then I saw\nthat somebody\u2019s looking through the window, a young girl. So I said, \u201cLet\u2019s wait.\u201d And\nthe janitor came, he said, \u201cNobody\u2019s here, they all left.\u201d So I told him, \u201cWell, I saw there\na young girl in the window.\u201d So he saw that we know, so he said, \u201cWait, I'll bring the\nkeys.\u201d He went up, he got the keys, and we came in. So in the apartment we came, it was\nthe most beautiful apartment with oil paintings, carpets, beautiful. And there were -- and\nthere were four women, one was the daughter-in-law of the owner of the house, then\nwere two peasant girls, they were the maids, and then I s -- I saw a beautiful girl, dressed\nvery nice, she wa -- she was standing there. So I start to ask who they are, then they told\nus [indecipherable] and when I came to her, she said, \u201cWell, my name 1s Felicia\nMuirashefska.\u201d And I ask her whose apartment it 1s, she said, \u201cWell, this 1s the apartment\nthat we live, but it belong to Meyerader and Krauss,\u201d and I start to ask her more\nquestions, she got annoyed, I got annoyed, and -- and she -- I said, \u201cHow could you have\na job | -- wh-what -- do you work here?\u201d She said, \u201cI work, but thank God I don\u2019t work\nany more, because the Germans left already.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, what do you mean the\nGermans left already? You are German, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I am Polish,\u201d and\nshe showed me a kanekarta. So I said, \u201cYeah, we find out different, we find out that you\nwere German.\u201d But we questioned and questions, and -- and I got very nasty, she got --\nshe didn\u2019t cooperate. She looked at this guy, the guy who was a Krakowian, he had a very\nSemitic face, he looked like he was a Polish officer, but he looked like -- he didn\u2019t have a\nSlavic face. So she asks if -- if she can speak to him. So I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d And then -- and\nthen -- and she went with him to the other room, and she said to him, \u201cWhat are you\nbothering me, I am the same as you.\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you mean, I am the same as\nyou? I am a Polish officer, and you are a German.\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a German, I\u2019m\nPolish, and -- and besides, I\u2019m the same as you. You are a Jew, and I am a Jew.\u201d He said,\n\u201cHow do you know that I am a Jew?\u201d \u201cWell, look on your face, it\u2019s -- you can -- I can see\nyou are Jewish.\u201d And then he ask from where are you, from where are you, so he said, \u201cI\nam from Krakow.\u201d She says, \u201cFrom Krakow where are you?\u201d My wife said, and -- and\nshe\u2019s from Shtanuslabu. She said, \u201cYou know, I was in the Jewish -- in the Hebrew\ngymnasium, and there was a Jewish boy from Krakow, whose name was Oscar\nMargoulis, he went with me to the Hebrew gymnasium.\u201d And when he heard Oscar\nMargoulis, he -- he almost fainted. So 1 -- Oscar Margoulis is my first cousin. So he --\nand he asked her what happened to him, so he had the best proof that she\u2019s telling the\ntruth, and he came in, and he said to me -- he calls me in the corner, and he said, \u201cYou\nknow, this -- this pretty girl,\u201d and she was very pretty, \u201cthis pretty girl, she is not a\nGerman. She\u2019s not even Polish, she\u2019s Jewish.\u201d I said, \u201cYou are crazy. How can she be\nJewish here?\u201d So he -- and he was a womanizer, every girl he wanted to have. So I said,\n\u201cYou know,\u201d -- and Januk was his name, \u201cyou know, Januk, you are so -- if you had\nfound Eva Braun,\u201d -- you know who Eva Braun was, yeah? \u201cYou would make from her a\nJews just to have to go to sleep with her.\u201d So she said no -- he said, \u201cNo, you go and f --\nprove yourself -- you cannot -- she proved it to me, she wen,\u201d -- so I said, \u201cYeah, she\nproved it, you are even -- told them that she showed you that she\u2019s circumcised.\u201d So -- so\nthen later I started to interrogate her. And in the beginning she didn\u2019t want to cooperate,\nthen later -- I didn\u2019t want to ask her if she is Jewish, because the people -- there was the\njanitor, were there three other, and this was very dangerous, because Krakow was not\ncompletely liberated. The Germans sometimes made a [indecipherable] and they found\nthe Jews came out, and they killed them. So -- so I ask her, \u201cDo you speak other\nlanguages?\u201d She said, \u201cYes, I speak German, I speak,\u201d -- of course she spoke in Polish --\n\u201cT speak Russian, and I speak Hebrew, and I speak English.\u201d So I said, \u201cEnglish?\u201d And I\nspoke a little English. See I -- I learned English. The only time I find out I don\u2019t speak\nEnglish is when I came to the United States. So -- so I -- I remember I ask her from\nwhich nation are you, and she said, \u201cJewish.\u201d I said, \u201cHow can you prove it?\u201d She said, \u201cI\ncan speak Hebrew.\u201d So I said, \u201cSpeak to me Hebrew.\u201d She said, \u201c\u201cWa -- how can I speak -\n- I speak to you Hebrew? You don\u2019t understand what I am saying, because look in your\nface, y-you -- you -- you don\u2019t -- you look like a Polish anti-Semite.\u201d And she started to\ntell me that I shouldn\u2019t bother her. Well, [indecipherable] when she spoke Hebrew, I\nthought oh, she is Jewish, or maybe the Germans -- she\u2019s not, maybe the Germans taught\nher to speak Hebrew, and she would go out and s-spy on Jews, and -- so I asked her this\ntime, I asked her, \u201cTell me, when do Jews pray Koniterra?\u201d Koniterra, this is a prayer that\nwe pray in Yom Kippur. And without thinking, she answered Yom Kippur. Then when --\nwhen she said Yom Kippur, she started -- she stopped, and she said, \u201c\u201cWait a second, wait\na second. How do you know about Yom Kippur?\u201d She said, \u201cYou wa -- don\u2019t tell me,\u201d\nshe said, \u201cyou -- you -- you -- you -- you, too, you too?\u201d So -- and she started -- and she\nhad tears in her eyes. So I said, \u201cYes, I too, I too.\u201d And then later, so I knew that she 1s\nJewish, and she knew that I am Jewish, then I told her what I need, said I need the plans.\nShe said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me right away, I would gi -- I have the plans.\u201d And she\nwent with me to the other room, and she opened the safe, she had the safe, and she gave\nme the plans. Now also, before we went in there, now -- so we, between us, we spoke --\nwe said, \u201cWell, if we will get the plans,\u201d -- we didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s a woman, if it\u2019s a man,\nnow somebody has to kill the person, because if we got some information like this, the\nperson had to be liquidated, because in case let\u2019s say she would give me the plans, she\ncould notify her superiors that we already have the plans, and she would spoil the whole\nthing. So -- and then when we f -- when we find out there is a woman, so they s -- 1t came\n-- it fell on me, why? Because a day before we did a job, something similar like this, this\nso -- they did it, so they said, \u201cNow, it\u2019s your part.\u201d It means that I had to do it. And --\nbut when she gave me the plans, so we had the -- if she wouldn\u2019t give us -- if she\nwouldn\u2019t -- I wouldn\u2019t find out she is Jewish, I definitely would shoot her. Not -- she\nshouldn\u2019t call up her -- and -- to the -- so -- so then later she gave me the plans, and the\nplans were exactly how then -- the columns, everything. So I brought it over to the -- to\nthe Russian intelligence, which we -- we worked together, and they had the plans, so they\nsend out engineers and they -- and they did everything that it shouldn\u2019t be -- yeah,\nbecause when she gave me the plans, so she said to me -- she said to me -- so I said, \u201cI\nhave to run,\u201d took the plan, because any minute the columns will blow up. She said, \u201cNo,\ndon\u2019t worry, they wouldn\u2019t blow up, because,\u201d -- I asked her why. \u201cCause,\u201d she said,\n\u201ctwo days before, I got a phone call for the camp\u2019s commandant from Krakow, from that\ncommander in Krakow, and he ask if this 1s the company Meyerader and Krauss, I said\nyes, and -- and so he said -- he didn\u2019t ask questions, he only said, Springen zie dez oilen.\u201d\nSo detonate the columns, because before her boss left, he told her that she will get a\nphone call, that in -- they would tell her that the columns have to be destroyed. Se -- I\nmean, dek -- will be detonated. So she got this phone call, springen zie dez oilen. Now,\nhe didn\u2019t ask who she is, but she didn\u2019t -- she -- he didn\u2019t ask, s-she was not afraid in case\nshe wouldn\u2019t do it, which they will come to her. So meanwhile when she got this\ntelephone -- so she notified the Akar, the Polish underground, because she wa -- was a\nmember of the Polish underground, and she told them that -- what the telephone was, and\nshe was -- she was sure that they will come, and they will do something, but they didn\u2019t\ndo anything. And then when -- and then -- okay.",
        "Q: -- interrupt here, because --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Norman Salsitz. This is tape number two, side B. So the AK told your --",
        "A: The AK didn\u2019t do anything, they didn\u2019t tell us, and then later when we did it,\n[indecipherable], she thought it's done by the AK, but they didn\u2019t do anything. So -- so it\nwas -- it was that the columns were taking away the electricity, but the columns were\nstaying there for about four weeks til they destroyed it. And this is how Krakow was\nsaved. Actually, she was the one who saved Krakow. And then after, when I came to\nAmerica, there were films, reports, and there were about 20 different versions how this\nhappened, because everybody knew that it was prepared for detonation, and there was\ndifferent versions. There was even a book came out r -- r -- out in Russian, it\u2019s called,\n\u201cMiore Vihar.\u201d There\u2019s a Miore Vihar, a Major Vihar -- Vihar, it was [indecipherable],\nthat he did it, and that was made a film, the film was so important that it was serialized on\ntelevision. All right, a Miore Vihar was there, but he describes that he was the hero as if\nhe got the -- then was a other film, and they -- they portrayed the pope when he was a\nyoung fellow, and that the pope was the one who find out about it, and he came, he cut\nthe wires. I saw the film, the pope wasn\u2019t there. He was in Krakow, but he didn\u2019t have\nanything to do. And there were other -- other versions how it 1s, because nobody knew\nabout it, she didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t know til our book came out. When our book, \u201cAgainst\nAll\u201d sa -- \u201cAll Odds\u201d came out, so we wrowt -- write about it, so they then -- University\nAgaloinski, Agaloinion in Krakow find out about this, so they invited us we should come\nto Krakow, that I should come with my wife, but we didn\u2019t go. I didn\u2019t want to go to\nPoland. I wrote them a letter, and -- and this -- and this was the end of this episode, that\nshe actually saved -- saved the town, the most historical town from Krakow. I don\u2019t know\nif she saved it hundred percent, or she had a part in it, that 1t was not if she -- 1f she would\nsay to the camp\u2019s commandant that nobody\u2019s there to detonate, they will send over some\npeople. And you also must know one thing. Now, you would ask a question, why did the\nGerman high command call up, and that\u2019s it, and they let it go. You see, when a ger --\nwhen the army goes forwards, like the German army went forwards, there was never a\nbetter army in the world. Everything was so accurate, poom. And this was also the -- the\nproblem with the Holocaust, because they were so accurate sa -- during the Holocaust,\nthey made everything so perfect, that everything was in order. The same thing with the\nGerman army. When they went forwards towards Russia, everything was so perfect, it\nwas the best army. But, when the German army retreated, it -- it was no different than --\nit was same as the Egyptian army retreated in the Negev, you remember in the Six Day\nWar? When the Egyptian army retreated without shoes, without pants, without\nunderwear. Yeah, this is how the German army was, because when the army goes\nforwards, and specially when it\u2019s well organized like the Germans, everything --\neverything is in order. But when the army retreats, nothing is in order, no command, no --\nnobody knows what the other is doing. And for the same thing, when they left Krakow,\neverything was disorganized, there was no command, so for this reason, they didn\u2019t\nfollow up with the destruction of Krakow.",
        "Q: So what happened then? You stayed -- you stayed in Poland for awhile?",
        "A: Well, I stayed in Poland, and I became -- I became a -- a commandant of -- 0-0-over --\nfor a certain units for the county of -- of Poland -- of Krakow. Well, the -- the county,\nwhich was the town, and the county. And I stayed there from -- this where -- I came in\nactually January the 17\", and I was -- there were so many things happened during the\ntime in the beginning to organize, and the -- the community\u2019s organized a civil\nadministration and everything. And then -- so now in the new book I\u2019m writing episodes\nabout it, and I was there til -- til -- I would say til August \u201945. August \u201945, I was\ntransferred to Breslau, which became Brauslav.",
        "Q: Give us -- give us just a brief idea, maybe just one or two episodes to see what it was\nlike in Krakow at that time, and what -- what your duties -- what you did.",
        "A: Well, in Krakow in that time, it was chaos. Everything was falling apart, and -- and we\nhad to put together that Krakow it should -- it should function. Now, we were the first\nPolish unit who came into Krakow, cause it was occupied by the Russians. And the\nPolish unit was not a big unit, and then later more came in, and we took over the\nadministration, til about two, three months later, where there was a civil administration.\nAnd -- and -- and first we had to clean out Krakow from all collaborators, because there\nwere a lot of Polish collaborators who worked with the Germans, who worked --\nespecially the Polish police, the Polish police who were in-incorporated into the German\npolice. We used to call it in Polish granna toppa policia. It means the navy blue granna --\nthe navy blue police, because they had navy blue uniforms, but this was the police from\nbefore the war, and they didn\u2019t behave so hundred percent like the Polish people desired.\nWell, there were some who belonged to the underground illegally, but the majority, they\nworked with the German -- they were collaborators. So now we had to clean out the\nPolish police which were collaborators. There were a lot of volksdeutshen. The\nvolksdeutshen lived there, and the volksdeutshen had full rights under the Germans. And\nwhen the volksdeutshen, when they were di -- discovered, naturally some of them were\narrested, some -- some were collaborators openly, and their apartments were confiscated.\nAnd this was -- this was mostly -- this was mostly the work for us. Also, the Polish\ngovernment had a big problem, because as you know, in Warsaw, in August 1944, was\nthe uprise in Warsaw. And the uprise -- the Polish people wanted to have the uprise in\nWarsaw, and to declare a free Poland wi -- go -- government. But the Russians did -- it\nwas a trick what they did, as their [indecipherable] went forwards, they were quite --\nquite successful, and when they came to the Vistula, to the east r -- side of the Vistula,\nwhich is the river, this -- the Russians stopped. They -- their excuse was that the -- the --\ntheir supply line ended, but this was not true. They stopped because the Polish people\nwanted to be very smart, and they wanted, when -- as the Russians approached Krakow,\nso they wanted to make the uprise, and the Germans were -- had involve with the Russian\nfront 10 divisions, so they figured they were busy -- busy with the Russian front, and they\nwill make the uprise, and they will establish an -- a free Poland government. But the\nRussians said well, they thought we are fighting, and they didn\u2019t want the Polish to\nestablish a free Poland, which the government was in exile in London. Se -- they wanted\nto have a Communist regime. So they stopped, and naturally then they withdrew, the\nGermans withdrew the 10 divisions, they brought them to Warsaw, and they suppressed\nthem -- their uprise, and -- and they killed 200 fighters, they killed 200 civilians. They\ndidn\u2019t kill them just like Jews, you take them to extermination camp, but they were killed\nfighting. And then they took 400 civilians, and they took them as prisoners. They put --\nput to a town there, and -- and then -- then th -- about a few months later, the Russians\nmade the last offensive, and they occupied Warsaw. So -- so -- so 1n con -- so tha -- all th-\nthe -- the -- the b -- the manage -- the big shots from the uprise, who were not killed, who\nwere not taken as prisoners, they moved the whole headquarters from the uprise to\nKrakow. And then Krakow had to be the same uprise as in Warsaw. When the Germans\nwill leave, they want to make the uprise. So they were in Krakow. So this was one also of\nthe reasons that -- about the destruction, they wanted to make destruction we -- there\nwere three reasons actually. The first reason was that they wanted to make this destroy\nbecause they were afraid for a other uprise like in Warsaw. The second reason in -- in --\nwas because they wanted to slow down the Russian approach. If the town will be\ndestroyed, so they will slow down. The third reason was because the Germans considered\nKrakow as a German town, and they cou -- like they always -- like all the scientists from\nbefore, and they always said that they were Germans, not Polish. So they considered that\nthis a Polish tow -- as a German town. And then when they -- they had to leave it, so they\n-- they didn\u2019t want to leave it [indecipherable]. They said well if we cannot have it, we\nwill destroy it. So those were the three reasons, but actually the biggest reason was that\nthey wanted to destroy the town, because they couldn\u2019t live with it that Poland should get\nthe town untouched. Because in Krakow there was never bomb, in Krakow was never the\nhouse destroyed, so they wanted to destroy the whole town. Now, would this work, the\n287 mines, Krakow would -- not one house would be left, because they -- the way they\nmined, and they put in the columns, it was the whole town would be blown up. Naturally\nwith the pe -- and people, there were hundred maybe -- hu -- hu -- thousands, and\nthousands of people would be killed. So -- so this was the reason, because the uprise had\nto be in Krakow the same way.",
        "Q: So how did your relationship with your now wife progress? What did she in the\nmeantime, while you were busy doing this other thing, and how did you come together\nthen?",
        "A: Well, when -- when in this time, when I got the plans, naturally she -- sh --\n[indecipherable] our group, she was admired, and -- and then the -- I -- I was busy with\nmy -- with my things. Then one day -- yeah, the ne -- but in Krakow there was no food,\nbecause there was war, there was no food, and then she didn\u2019t have food. So the next day,\nor two days later, I took my adjutant, and -- and I -- and we had everything, so I\nremember I made the package salami, and -- and -- and -- and butter, and everything, I\nmade the package and I send it to her. And she was there with her fr -- friend, the -- the --\nthis daughter-in-law from -- from the house. And when I send it to her, she wrote an -- a\nnote, she answered she got it, and -- and -- and -- and -- and people who started to come\nout from hiding. And there were cases there I remember, there was one man, he was a\nlawyer, when he came out so that he walked like an animal, because he was two years he\nwas laying like in a grave. Somebody kept him, and he was under the floor, he was\nlaying, he only came -- they fed him, gave him something, but he never came out. And\npeople started to come out, they didn\u2019t have what to eat, because even the Polish people\ndidn\u2019t have what to eat. So she wrote me that she needs more food, she needs more food,\nso every day I raised -- see, I didn\u2019t see her -- every day I raised instead -- yesterday I\nsend her two loaves of bread, the next day I send her four loaves of bread, one salami I\nsend before, and each time I send it because I had those things. And she wrote that she is\ngiving this to people who came out. And the people who came out find out that there is\nsomebody who has food. So they came to us, and she gave them. So this went on for -- I\nwould say about -- about two weeks in the -- I didn\u2019t see her. So then one day -- one day\ni-in this building, where she was there, 1t was the most beautiful and best section, Yu-\nYushalaya, that\u2019s the -- the street, Yushalaya, 98. It was on corner Ujaneetya street. And\nthe German took over the best houses for their administration. So -- so the Polish\ngovernment started to take over th-those apartments, and one day somebody came in, and\nthey saw this apartment, was a beautiful apartment, and they took it over, and they said,\n\u201cWe confiscated apartment, you have to look for another apartment.\u201d So she notified me\nthat they taking away the -- the apart -- the apartment. So I -- I send over -- oh, I think I\ncame over in this time, and I made out an -- an -- I typed out an -- a paper that I lived\nthere, that I took over the apartment, I put it on the door. Once I put in door, nobody\ntouched it, and she could stay there. I was not staying there, but this -- so then I didn\u2019t see\nher again for a -- for a few weeks, and yeah -- and then she -- and -- and we started also,\nto arrest a lot of German volksdeutshen, and we took away their apartments and they left\na lot of stuff, the apartment, so -- so I -- I gave her a lot of clothing what I got from the\npeople, so every -- so I gave her that. About a few weeks later she came to my office and\nshe said she had to register to the army, because in her year, she -- sh -- sh -- they had to\nregister. They took women to the army, too. So -- and she didn\u2019t want to go, naturally, to\nthe army. So I gave her papers that she works in my office -- she didn\u2019t work in my office\n-- that she\u2019s occupied. So she didn\u2019t go to army, and then later I started to go out with her,\nand then each time a little more, and -- and this is how we started, and -- to go out til -- til\nwe were ready to -- to be married, but we didn\u2019t get married in Krakow, we -- I was\ntransferred to Breslau, and then she came after me to Breslau. So this was Krakow, but --",
        "Q: Was it -- was it difficult to slowly relax in times that were not quite normal yet, but to\nsomething sort of normal, like romance, to just to begin to feel like a human person?",
        "A: Well -- well, I will tell you this time was very -- I -- I welcomed the time, and to be\ninvolved in it, because after going through so much, and losing everybody, and here,\nlater, life gave me a purpose. It gave me a purpose that this was Poland renewed, and like\nI told you, I always liked Poland, and -- and -- and I was important in this renewal, I was\nimportant in the rebuilding. So it gave me a very -- and I think this was one of my -- of\nthe best times, and also -- also, it ga -- instead -- instead I -- like I had to work, let\u2019s say,\neight hours. I wanted to work 16 hours. Why? Because it gave me opportunity to -- to\nlook for the people, for the collaborators, and to put them behind bars, and to do things\nthat -- that this was my dream. So I was very 1-interested. Now, my superiors liked it. My\nsuperiors liked it because I was -- I did more that they asked from me, see? An-And I\nthink I was capable in doing it, and -- and I -- each time I was praised more and more,\nand -- and -- in-in -- because I could produce more than they -- that they asked from --\nfrom me.",
        "Q: So you had established -- you began to establish, or you had established a Polish\nidentity [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you, both of you then, later, intend to stay in Poland, or how\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Well, no. In this time, to stay in Poland, I don\u2019t think so we intend. But we had a\nconversation between us, later, when we were in Breslau, we -- we -- we spoke between\nus, and maybe -- you see very -- you see once I -- I had this position, I always notified the\nleadership. There was a Jewish committee. There were not too many Jews c-came back,\nbut how many came back, they organized a committee. I went to the Jewish committee,\nto the president, and I told him, \u201cListen, I am a Jew. And anything you have a problem,\ncome to me.\u201d Because officially they couldn\u2019t do anything. Because officially the\ngovernment, and officially all the people who worked, in the -- even in our office, oh,\neverybody hated Jews. So I said, \u201cIf you had something to do, and if there is something I\ncan do unofficially, I will gladly do it.\u201d And they knew that I\u2019m -- a few people knew.\nAnd every time something happened like this -- specially there was one rabbi, his name\nwas -- well, anyway, I have it written down.",
        "Q: Maybe it will come back to you.",
        "A: Yeah, it always ca -- so -- Steinberg, Moja, he was a son of a very famous rabbi. Now\nhe -- I told him I was a Jew, and he became the rabbi in Krakow, he was not from\nKrakow, he became the rabbi, and every time something happened, he came to me, he\ntold me this. Unofficially I did it, not as a Jew, but I did it from my pos -- my -- my\nposition. And I was very happy that I could help. So -- and I was officially as a non-Jew.\nAnd -- and once I am -- we had a discussion with my wife, and we said, \u201cWell, listen.\nMaybe it is time that we should remain,\u201d we were already established. Now, she was\naccepted to the medical school, to the University of Yaggalonian. And this what she\nalways wanted to be, a doctor. Now, you are already accepted, and I have a -- well,\nimportant position. So maybe it\u2019s time that we should cut off, but not being Jewish, and\nmay -- who knows, maybe in 200 years will be another Holocaust then, and the -- and my\n-- our grandchildren wouldn\u2019t have to be killed. So we had a discussion about it, and she\nsaid no, she cannot do it, because she had a sister, and a grandmother, and uncles in\nPalestine in this time, and she wouldn\u2019t like -- she would like eventually to go to them.\nNow, with me was a different story. I -- I had family in America, but it wou -- didn\u2019t\nmean so much to me. So, to me the different story I told her, I wouldn\u2019t like to cut off\nbecause -- see, by Jews, there is a sect, we call 1t Cohamin, the priestly tribe. Now, the\npriestly tribe -- now I am -- the priestly tribe started with Aaron, the brother of Moses.\nAnd this goes on for 4,000 years. The son becomes a priest after the father, priest after\nthe fa -- and it never changes. Now I -- my father was from this tribe, and I am from this\ntribe. So I told her, said, \u201cIf this lasted 4,000 years, and I don\u2019t know how many from my\nforefathers were killed because they were Jews. My father was killed because he was a\nJew. Who knows, maybe his grandfather, his great-grandfather was killed because he was\na Jew. So who am I that I should say by me I should cut the chain, and by me to say it\nstopped.\u201d So I said, \u201cI cannot do it, because if this lasted for so many thousands of years,\nthere is something, and I wouldn\u2019t like it should be destroyed.\u201d And for this reason we\ndecided not to remain in Poland as Poles, that we have to go out, and we have to continue\nto be Jews. And naturally, our dream was to go to Palestine, we never dreamt about\nAmerica. We ne -- we wanted -- specially me, I wanted to go to Palestine because if\nsomebody would tell me that see, I was in the underground, in the Polish army, if\nsomebody will tell me that I would be in Palestine, and I would be able to fight for a\nJewish state one day, one day to have a rifle in my hand, and they will say the next day\nyou will be killed, I will always agree .That if I could fight one day for my homeland, not\nfor strangers, and then I could be killed, I would be very happy. So, we wanted to go to\nPalestine. So then there were the things -- reasons why we didn\u2019t go to Palestine, because\nyou couldn\u2019t go that j -- if you was a -- were illegal. So they took the people, they send\nthem to Cyprus, so we said we\u2019ll go to America, and -- and we will go to -- which one\nwill come first, Palestine or America, and then from America we can always go to\nPalestine. So we came to America, it\u2019s a -- and a -- and a -- but -- but --",
        "Q: But it wasn\u2019t that simple, right, because Brauslav or Breslau was in the Russian zone,\nwas it a [indecipherable]",

        "Q: Yeah, but it still wasn\u2019t easy to get -- to get just out of there.",
        "A: No, we -- I escaped, no we -- I could -- special I couldn\u2019t go out because on account of\nmy position. I remember I wanted -- see, I had a very good name in my -- in our outfit,\nand -- because I did more than they -- they ask. So then later, when -- when -- when they\nstarted to organize groups to -- to go to Palestine, to fight, I wanted to -- they -- I just\nwanted to get out legally, because I didn\u2019t want to escape, because I didn\u2019t want to spoil\nmy name. So I remember there was a -- I had a friend, he was a major in the Russian\nKGB, and I went to him, and I told him, \u201cListen, I want to get out, and -- and how should\nI arrange it?\u201d And now I didn\u2019t know that he would betray me. He went to my superiors,\nand he told them that I want to get out. The next day they called me in, and there was a\nwhole -- about 10 high officers, and one said, \u201cWell, I heard you will -- you want to get\nout,\u201d [indecipherable]. So he said, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll give you three choices that you can go\nout. The first choice 1s you take a revolver, and you shoot yourself. The second choice 1s,\nif you don\u2019t like to kill yourself, we\u2019ll send you to Siberia for 10 years. And the third\nchoice is you go back, [indecipherable] march as you did today, you have to do 10 times\na march, because til now we didn\u2019t check you because we have confidence in you. But\nfrom now on, every step will be checked, every way we\u2019ll check.\u201d So I knew that -- that\nthey will have an eye on me. And then, well, we decided that we have to get out, so we\narranged to run away, So --",
        "Q: How did you -- how did you manage?",

        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- it was [indecipherable], it\u2019s a long story. So I managed that. I run away through\nGearlies, but it\u2019s a long story, so I run away, and -- and after I run away, my wife was\narrested. They arrested her because they thought by -- by her being arrested, I will find\nout, I will come back to try to save her, so this way they did. But, they arrested her, and\nshe claimed that I was not her husband, because we were never officially married there.\nSaid [indecipherable] he -- I was a boyfriend, we were lovers, and now we -- I run away,\nand that\u2019s it. So she was two weeks in jail, and after two weeks of jail, there was -- the\nman who was in charge, he was the head of the whole --- the army of the whole state,\nsaid -- said that he will let you -- yeah, there was a [indecipherable] of my wife, he was\nworking in the ministry, and then he went to the head from the army, he said, well he\nwants to take her out. So he said, \u201cWell, I will let her out if she will become my\nsecretary.\u201d So they let her out, and then later she escaped. But the -- those are a lot of\ndetails, details, details, but this 1s how -- how it went.",
        "Q: Okay, so where did you -- where did you meet again, where did you go first then?",
        "A: I -- [run away to Munich. First I went out to Berlin, and I was in Berlin, and from\nBerlin, I -- see, I went -- I run through Gearlies, and then from Gearlies I went to Berlin.\nAnd in Berlin I started to work, we -- we call it here -- we called it Bricha. This was a\norganization that 1t means escape. W -- I started to work in Poland in the Bricha, so we --\nwe took Jews who wanted to escape, and we smuggled them through the border. And\nthen my job was, from Berlin, I took the groups of Jews to Munich, because I -- we\ncouldn\u2019t take them to the American zone, first I had to go from Munich. I -- I took them\nto the -- to the English zone. I remember I made th-there some acquaintances in\nAshfaiger, you know where that is? And through Ashfaiger we took them, and -- and then\nto Munich, and in Munich somebody else took over, and they took the Jews to Italy, and\nfrom Italy they smuggled them on ships, and they were caught in Cyprus. So I worked in\n-- in this Bricha a few months, then later I find out my wife came [indecipherable] my\nwife came, so -- SO we got an apartment in -- in Munich. And see, she wanted to go to\nschool, but then later we figured we have to -- we have to get out. So we registered -- we\nregistered to -- to Palestine, what I just said, to America. We said, which will be first, and\nthere we\u2019ll go. So America came first, and also, it was a very, very big problem, because\nall the DPs who wanted to come to America, hardly they could make it, because in the\nconsulate -- in American consulate in Munich, there was one woman, she was one of the\nsecretaries, and she had some friend, and they had a business. And then -- and then they -\n- an-and there was a vice-consul, and he was also a partner, and everybody who wanted\nto come in front of the consul to have the application asking questions, we had to pay her\n500 dollars. And people didn\u2019t have 500 dollars, and if you didn\u2019t pay 500 dollars, so\nthey didn\u2019t forward the -- the -- the papers. And -- and also, when they came to the\nconsul, the consul asked for birth certificates, and passports. Nobody had their birth\ncertificate, I mean they were all survivors from the camp. So nobody could -- could go.\nSo one -- and see my wife spoke quite good English, she had six years English. So in this\n-- nobody could go and do something, so one day there was the -- the then chief consul,\nhis name was Clark, in Munich, so we waited -- we waited when he came back from\nlunch, so my wife and I, we stopped him, and she started to tell him the story, that Jews\ncannot go because first they had to pay money. And the second thing, who will have an --\na passport, a birth certificate? We came from concentration camps. And she -- he\nlistened, and when he listened, I remember she explained to him everything, then later,\nafter, when we stopped talking, so he went to us, and he put the hand on our head, he was\na tall guy, yeah. So he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We need people like you in America.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cI will,\u201d -- and he gave out new orders. First thing, he fired the secretary, and he\ngave out new orders that we don\u2019t need from the concentration camps -- people in\nconcentration, those documents, only what we need is two witnesses, that they know the\nperson is from here and there, and this is sufficient. So the people started to come. Now,\nfor instance, all the German people who made applications to go to g -- to America, they\nall got visas, because they had their papers, they could come in. And mostly people, their\nhusbands were in -- in the army, in the SS, and then -- they all were welcome, so we told\nthem all those things, that they -- why should they have the priority, and after this, all the\n[indecipherable], 1t ended, then the people from the camps, they thanked us, that we made\nout that she is it -- they changed the whole law, and then we came to America.",

        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nNorman Salsitz. This is tape number three, tape A. So, I thought we are going to\nAmerica, but we are not quite going to America.",
        "A: No, so then later when we got the visas, so we had to go with groups with -- with\nsurvivors, and we were sent to Bremenhaven. And in Bremen -- when we came to\nBremenhaven in this time was a strike, a coal strike in America, and we supposed to\nleave Bremenhaven in June, 1946, and we were in Bremenhaven six months, til the strike\nfinished, because they didn\u2019t have coal. And we -- the -- we -- the strike was finished, and\nwe started in Bremenhaven in January, 1947. So it was winter, and it was a very, very big\nstorm, and -- and it was -- the voyage was terrible, it took over two weeks, and during\nthat trip, the boiler broke in -- in the ship, it was a old liberty ship, and it took us over 12 -\n- 14 days, and it was the -- everybody was very sick, especially I was very sick that I was\n-- and also, the DPs, the -- the Jewish people didn\u2019t get the choice locations. Like, for\ninstance, the German people, who got the visas because they knew everybody, they had\nthe documents, all of them had cabins, and then they -- they had the -- the -- the ch -- the\n-- the best accommodations, but the DPs, we didn\u2019t pay for it, the Joint paid for it. So\nthey put us in, and I was in the basement, in the basement there were about 150 people\nlaying like -- like -- like rats. And my wife -- they gave them other cabins, there were 40\nwomen in one room. And I was so sick that I prayed that the ship should sink, and -- and\nI didn\u2019t eat anything, and it was -- I was terrible sick. And I figured -- and I really wanted\nthem -- we should finish [indecipherable]. Well, anyways, my -- s -- because I was laying\nin the basement, and -- so my wife, and -- she made up with the -- with the people who\nwere in her room, that she came, she put in a kerchief of my -- my head. [clock chiming].\nShe put in a kerchief, she put in a housecoat, and she practically carried me to her room,\nand I was sleeping with the -- in this room, which was much better than in the -- on the\nfloor on the basement, and we came to, after 14 days we -- the captain announced that\ntomorrow we are entering New York. And I remember the whole night, because we\ndidn\u2019t know when, all the people were so excited, we coming to America, everybody\npulled out his best suit, and the suits were made in Europe, and with big lapels, with big\nwhite hair, you know, it was the best in Europe, but it was not like America. And\neverybody got dressed to kill. And we were standing on the deck, waiting for the -- the\nStatue of Liberty. Finally [clock chiming] Fi --",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s the bird, right on cue here.",
        "A: Okay, yeah. Finally, we -- we saw the Statue of Liberty, and this feeling, I don\u2019t think\nthat somebody can -- can describe this -- this feeling when we saw it. Everybody was\nstanding there and crying, cause this was all, they were all survivors, and finally we saw\nher. And everybody was nice dressed, and -- and th-this was the minutes that we waited\nfor. And we pulled into the harbor in New York, and then later we had to go down, and --\nand then in a very, very, very big hole, and all the people from -- from the whole ship,\nthere were signs like all A, B, C, and everybody went to -- to their initial, and they\nbrought in the suitcases what we had. And then as we are staying there, a man came in, a\nhusky guy with a -- with the lumber jacket. And he goes around, and then -- and he\nlooked around where the initials are, and came to S, and he goes into my wife, and he\nsaid, \u201cMaybe you know where the -- some people name of Salishitz is.\u201d She got very\nscared, and she pulled my leg, she said, \u201cWell, they\u2019re looking for us.\u201d We didn\u2019t know\nwho this is. So we were so afraid that maybe something is wrong, maybe they will send\nus back, or something. So she didn't know what to say. Then later, she said to him -- he as\n-- he ask her, \u201cDo you speak English?\u201d She said yes. So he said, \u201cSo, do you know wh-\nwhere the Salishitz is?\u201d\u2019 So she said, \u201cI am the Salishitz, and this is my husband. So\nwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong,\u201d and he grabbed her and kissed her,\nand kissed me. He said, \u201cI am Yarkey. I am Yarkey, I am the son of Risel.\u201d And Risel\nwas my father\u2019s sister, and this was her son Yarkey, who -- he became Jake in America.\nAnd he find out that -- that we are coming, so he came to -- to wait for us. And all the\npeople looked at us, they didn\u2019t know in beginning, they were afraid something happened\nbeca -- then later when they see sa -- he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to wait for a -\n- for a -- for a -- the inspectors.\u201d He called two longshoremen, they took the suitcase,\ncalled sa -- called the inspector, gave a stamp with the -- others had to open the -- the --\nthe luggage, we didn\u2019t. And he right away took us out in -- 1n the -- in the -- he took us\nout, and there was a car waiting in a place where it\u2019s -- was not allowed to park, and there\nwas my brother waiting, and they took us away. Now, what happened, I didn\u2019t know why\nhe\u2019s such a big shot, this -- this y -- uncle, he came in a -- in \u201999, said he had a\nluncheonette right near the piers, and -- and everybody who worked there, all the\nlongshoremen, all the inspectors, they all -- they all ate there. And -- and when he find\nout we have to come, so he went, and he waited for us. So it happens that I just wrote the\nstory about it, because I want to send it to his daughter. So, and then we came to\nAmerica, and -- and -- and we went to my brother, my brother took us to his house. He\nhad a house in Bensonhurst in Brooklyn. And we lived with him about -- I would say\nabout two, three we -- two weeks.",
        "Q: Now I do have some questions.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: You hadn\u2019t -- you hadn\u2019t seen your brother for a long time?",
        "A: I -- my brother left our home before I was born -- before I was born, I never saw him,\nbut in 1934 he came for a visit, and this was the only visit he came, so I saw him in 1934.",
        "Q: How -- how well were they aware of what had happened in -- in Europe? Did you talk\nabout that? [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, yeah, well, naturally we talked about it, but then later, little by little it came out,\nthey -- they say well they didn\u2019t know how m -- how -- how the whole situation naturally\n[indecipherable], but 1 -- so I -- I remember there was once a lecture in a temple, and\nrabbi and all of them, they said that they didn\u2019t know how terrible -- because I ask\nquestions, like why didn\u2019t you do more, when they ask me what could we do. So I told\nthem what they could do more. So they said they didn\u2019t know about it. So I went -- the\nnext day I went to the -- th-the Jewish pi -- to the forwas that is a Jewish forwas, and I\npicked out -- they had microfilms, and I picked out microfilms from the time where we\nwere destroyed, for the time of July \u201942, August \u201942. And every day, in the re -- paper\nevery day were articles about what was going on, which came porskal -- maybe it was not\nin the New York Times, the New York Times maybe there was something on the -- on\npage 18, a piece of this, but in the forwas, there was every day in ice -- I had my -- and\nthen later, when we came to a next meeting, and when the rabbi again said so, I said to\nhim, \u201cIt\u2019s not true, because I just looked over them, and that was mentioned every single\nday.\u201d And we were very bitter, because in the beginning -- in the beginning the people in\nAmerica didn\u2019t want -- we started to tell stories, nobody wanted to listen. And if\nsomebody listened, they thought that we are -- we got nervous breakdowns, that the -- we\ntold them stories that it is not true, because how can somebody listen and imagine that\nsomebody deliberately takes six million people and kill. It\u2019s not -- and you talk about six\nmillion people like -- like a -- once I saw in the New York Times, an article on one page,\nsix million Jews were killed. In the next pages, six million stocks were sold today on the\nstock market, in the same breath. So, w-w-w-we couldn\u2019t understand how -- people\ncouldn\u2019t believe it. Not only -- you see, when the Germans killed six million Jews, if they\nwill kill the six million Jews the first day when they came in, it will be a terrible thing,\nthey killed six million people, but it will not be so terrible. The terrible thing is for six\nyears they tortured the people. They starved them, they beat them, they died from\nsickness, and all those things. Then, on the top, then finally, they killed them. Take for\ninstance the Jews who survive concentration camps. Jews were in Auschwitz, some for\nthree, four years. And then later, when the Russians were already next to the\nconcentration camp, they had to be liberated, they took them on dead marches that all of\nthem died. Being three, four years in the camp, without food, and they had to walk\nwithout clothing, in this cotton dress, without underwear, without shoes, without food.\nAnd if somebody fell down because it was slippery, even no f -- s-- strong people they\nwould fell down. The minute they fell down, he was shot. Now, the German soldiers,\nthey were all dressed in fur jackets, 1n fur coats, with heavy boots and everything, and\nthey went with them. Here they had to be liberated. So this is the cruelty. They had to --\nthey had to take them on marches to be killed. So this killing was not so terrible if they\nwould do it the first day, but after six days -- six years, to be destroyed. Take, for\ninstance, Demyjanjuk. You know the story about Demjanjuk, that he was a guard in tr -- in\nBelzyce, he was the man who operated -- and in Treblinka, who operated the gas\nchambers th-there. Now, Demjanjuk, his biggest pleasure was when they brought in the\nJews, and they were naked, and they walked through the maze, to go 1n in the dead ca --\nt-to the gas chamber, to the -- to the room. Demjanyuk and others like him, were standing\nthere laughing, and everyone -- every time when they saw a young girl, with the firm\nbreast, yeah, they went and cut off the breast, or stabbed there. Al -- it\u2019s a -- 1t was a joke.\nThey knew that in 15 minutes this person will be killed, but before the person was killed,\nthey had to stab her, they had to cut off her breast. Those are the terrible things, the\ncruelty. The cruelty was -- now I\u2019m ri -- reading a book, Treblinka, and the cruelty in\nTreblinka is that every day they brought in transports, thousands and thousands of people.\nThe people who worked there, they couldn\u2019t lift up their head, they had to run with their\nhead down. Why? Because there were special people, special Germans and Ukrainian\nhelpers, that they hit them with -- with -- with some sticks, or with some rubber hoses,\nand the minute -- and at night, when there was the appelle, when they was the roll call,\nand when they saw somebody had a sign on his face, he was taken, they called it to the\nhospital, to be liquidated. So they had to run around with their head down they shouldn\u2019t\nbe marked. So the cruelty was so terrible. It\u2019s not the killing, but now how can people be\nso cruel that you take a guard, let\u2019s say, in Auschwitz. A whole day he goes and he kills\nthe children, but he had there his wife with his children. At night he went over and he\nplayed with his children, with his dog, with his cat. Like -- like nothing happened. And\nthe next day again he went out, and he killed. There were people who went over to\nVienna for the weekends. A whole week they were staying in a concentration camp,\nkilling, killing, killing. And then for the weekend he goes home, he goes to the opera with\nhis wife. He goes to parties with his wife, he goes to dances with his wife. He enjoys his\nchildren during that weekend, and Monday morning he goes back and he kills again. So\nhow can you imagine that there are people on this world that they are not -- they are not\nhuman beings, and they are not even animals, because animals wouldn\u2019t do a thing like\nthis. But they did it day after day, year after year, kill -- they killed six million innocent\npeople. And they played around with their children, they were beautiful children. Their\nchildren were beautiful, but the Jewish children had to be killed. This is the tragedy. The\ntragedy is that how people can do things like this, and what made them do? After all, the\nGerman people didn\u2019t come out from tha -- from jungles. They didn\u2019t come out from\nunderground, this was not 5,000 years ago. Even 5,000 years ago people wouldn\u2019t do it.\nNow this was the 20\" century. The 20\" century, a nation who created a Getta, who\ncreated a Schiller, who created a Mozart, who created such -- such geniuses? How could\na nation j -- sink so low, and then later you speak to them, you sp -- I -- I feel bad I\u2019m\ntalking this to you, because --",
        "Q: That\u2019s -- that\u2019s all right.",
        "A: How could pe-people sink so low that later they don\u2019t want even to talk about it. It\u2019s a\nlittle like nothing happened. There 1s even jokes. Jews make jokes, and they live with\ntheir jokes. When Eichmann was called -- and he caught, you know, he was brought to\nJerusalem, and naturally you know what happened to Eichmann. So he said to the Jews,\n\u201cJews, what\u2019s wrong with you, can\u2019t you take a joke?\u201d For him it was a joke. Six million\nJews, this was a joke. The Hungarian Jews, 400,000, it was almost after the war, they\nknew that they will be defeated, they still had to take the Hungarian Jews, 400,000 to\nAuschwitz, and to destroy them. They knew their war is lost, why did they do it? When\nthey come to a camp, that the Russians were already shelling the camp, they had to take\nthem out, and put them in in a barn, close the doors, and put the barn on -- on -- on fire,\nand to kill them. The Russians were already there, why did you do it? Why did you have\nto kill them? People say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s only the leaders.\u201d It\u2019s not the leaders. I don\u2019t know if\nyou read Goldhagen\u2019s book. Goldhagen wrote a book, and he say -- he called it that the\nwilling -- \u201cHitler\u2019s Willing Executioners.\u201d And he described, those were ordinary people.\nThere is a other book, \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d written by -- by Bronig, and he describes it --\ndid you read the \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d no?",
        "Q: Yes, I did.",
        "A: Yeah, so ordinary people. Home he was a -- a -- a barber, he was a mason, then they\ntook him over to Poland, and what did they do? They were not forced to kill. If he had an\nexcuse not to be killed, they didn\u2019t do anything to him. But they wanted to show to kill\nmore, to show off for his friends. And those were ordinary people, those were not people\nwho were trained to be murderers. They\u2019re not people who were -- it\u2019s special to schools,\nlike for instance who -- in -- in Ukrainian people, there was a school in Travniki, in\nPoland, there was a camp in Travniki, and this school was a special school to teach\nguards how to be cruel in a concentration camp. And if somebody graduated from\nTravniki, he was a bigshot. What did they teach him? Teach him how to be cruel, how to\nkill. Demjanjuk was a graduate from Travniki. Now he said he doesn\u2019t know anything\nabout it, he was a victim, he was in the Russian as a prisoner. So this what we cannot\nunderstand, how people, normal people in the 20\" century, intelligent people -- now, take\nfor instance the Einsatzgruppen, you know what the Einsatzgruppen are. The\nEinsatzgruppen are, when they took over the Russian territory, they didn\u2019t send the\npeople to concentration camps. When they took over a town, the Einsatzgruppen came in,\nand they killed all the Jews. They made ditches, they killed them, women, children, old\nmen, everybody. Now the Einsatzgruppen were volunteers. This was not soldiers that\nthey said well, you have to go to the Einsatzgruppen, all volunteers. And which\nvolunteers? Mostly were graduate -- people who graduate high school, who graduate\nmusi -- in universities, who had professions; lawyers, doctors, they were 1n the\nEinsatzgruppen. Now, how can people who were educated become such murderers?\nPeople ask me now questions. What do you think about the second generation, what do\nyou think about the new generation? I said, \u201cIf the new generation knows what their\nparents did, what their grandparents did, maybe they would understand something.\u201d But\nthey don\u2019t know, because the grandparents and the parents don\u2019t want to speak about it.\nThey are quiet. Nobody was in the Einsatzgruppen, nobody was in the Gestapo, nobody\nwas in the SS. The SS was only volunteers, the volunteers in the SS. Now, people say --\neverybody say -- now I have a speech now -- everybody -- everybody says, well, this\nwhat the Nazis did, this what the Nazis did. I am very angry. I never use the word Nazi.\nAnd if you see my book, in my book you don\u2019t have once a Nazi. And I always ask that\nquestion, why do you say Nazi? There were 90 million Germans, eight million belonged\nto the party, which you can tell them, they were members of the Nazi party? What\nhappened to 82 million? So 82 million were staying home and saving Jews? What\nhappened to the 82 million? So I said, you don\u2019t have to say Nazis did it, the Germans\ndid it, with their collaborators. Nazis were in the party. Okay, some had bigger jobs, some\nhad smaller jobs, but the Germans did it. And I am very much -- every time when I go\nand somebody has a speech, and he talks borgas about Nazis, I always get up, and I\nalways say please, don\u2019t use Nazis. And I tell them why. I tell, because the Germans did\nit. In the beginning maybe there were some Germans who were against Hitler. They were\nCommunists, they were Socialists, but then later, everybody was pro-Hitler, why not?\nHitler went to ge -- to France. They didn\u2019t have cognac so much. They brought over all\nthe cognac to fran -- from France. They didn\u2019t have enough butter, they went to\nDenmark, to Holland, brought over all the butter and the cheese, and they gave it to the\npeople. They went -- they didn\u2019t have wheat, they didn\u2019t have corn, rye. They went to the\nUkraine, brought over everything from the Ukraine. They didn\u2019t have coal, they went to\nPoland, they brought over everything from Poland. So naturally the one who were against\nhim, later they became -- they were in love with him. Why? Because they had br -- butter,\nthey have cognac, they had bread, they had everything. Why? Because they took it away\nfrom the people. Money? They had plenty of money. They had special people, they called\nthem the dentists. In every concen -- d-death camp, after they killed the people, there\nwere special people, they knocked out the gold teeth, and they got tons of gold, which\nthey send it to Switzerland, and they exchange it for money. Whenever you start to think\nabout all those things, I mean, they fit, but a human being, can a human being think about\nit, that a thing like this happened in the 20\" century?",
        "Q: Going back to your early time in America --",
        "A: Okay, okay.",
        "Q: -- when people did not want to hear much about it --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- and couldn\u2019t quite believe it either, or chose not to know the whole picture, did you\ns -- did you find that in -- true for the Jewish American community, as well as for --",
        "A: Yes, yes, I accuse the Jewish community also, because -- and I give you exan -- again\nexample. Now, I accuse that from all the American president, the worst president in\nUnited State was Roosevelt, because Roosevelt could do so much, he could save so many\nJews, he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t. He said -- there was a interview with Jan Karski, a Polish\nrunner from Poland what came to him, and he even describes the way Roosevelt was\nsitting. So Roosevelt was sitting smoking the cigar, and he said, \u201cAfter the war, we will\npunish the guilty, after the war.\u201d But during the war he didn\u2019t do anything. You know\nhow many Jews could be saved? The Jews were one -- th-they -- from friends, when --\nwhen it was the Vichy government that wanted to send all the Jews to north Africa, the\nAmerican government didn\u2019t let them do it. There was a cordy -- Hill, he was the\nSecretary of State. He didn\u2019t allow it, for two reasons. The first reason, he didn\u2019t want to\nannoy the Arabs, so let the Jews be killed. And then he said we could not afford -- we\ndidn\u2019t have enough trucks. They let the Jews be killed. Now, Pll give you an example. I\nhad a brother in America, my brother was here from 1920. When we were in the ghetto in\nour small town, once we received a package from Turkey, in the ghetto, and we didn\u2019t\nknow who sent the package, and di -- they delivered the package, and this was a package\nthat there were things that we never dreamt that this exist in the world. There was a can\nof coffee, there was a package of cheese, two packages of chocolate, two sar -- packages\nof sardines. So I -- sugar, everything was in this package. My mother rece -- two salamis.\nMy mother rec -- when we received it, she took the salami, she\u2019s -- put in slices, and\neverybody tried got a slice. We got this package, every -- the whole town envied us. We\ngot the -- we didn\u2019t know from where the package cames, came from Turkey. When I\ncame to America, I ask my brother, \u201cDid you ever send a package to us?\u201d He said, \u201cYes,\nthere was once in the paper, that for 15 dollars, you can buy a package in Turkey, and it\nwill be sent anyplace in Europe.\u201d So he went and he paid 15 dollars, and they sent the\npackage. I ask him, \u201cHow many packages did you send?\u201d He said one. Why one? He\nsaid, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t receive an answer that you received it.\u201d I said, \u201cWe were in the\nghetto.\u201d I ask him, \u201cCould you afford every day to send 50 dolla -- 15 dollars?\u201d He said,\n\u201cYes, business was wonderful, we did a lot of business during the war.\u201d I ask him, \u201cDid\nyou go to the theater?\u201d Yes. \u201cDid you go to the movies?\u201d Yes. \u201cDid you go during the\nwar to restaurants? How much cost a dinner in the restaurant? Couldn\u2019t you take every\nday 15 dollars and throw it out? Maybe, maybe somebody would received it. But you\ndidn\u2019t do it. You sent one package, and we received it.\u201d Imagine if we would receive\nevery day a package. Not only we, the whole family would have everything, we could\nsell it. Nobody did it. Then he, when I came over here, he cried. He had five sisters, all\nthe sisters are dead. I said, \u201c\u201cWhat did you do to save the sisters?\u201d \u201cI -- what could I do?\u201d I\ngave him 20 things that he could do. He didn\u2019t do it.",
        "Q: Tell me -- tell me a few.",
        "A: All right, tell me a few. The first thing, before the war, when we knew already what\u2019s\ngoing on in Germany, we wrote letters, we begged him, send us an affidavit. Nobody\nsend it back. You know how much it would cost him to send affidavit? 25 cents. Why 25\ncents? He had to notarize the affidavit. If he would do work with the bank, the bank will\nnotarize it for free. If he wouldn\u2019t do work with the bank, he would go to the drugstore,\nthe [indecipherable] was a notary, and he will ask him to sign, he pay 25 cents. So for 25\ncents, he could send affidavit. He didn\u2019t send affidavit, we asked him. And the same\nthing the other family members, too. This is the first thing. They knew what\u2019s going on in\nGermany, nobody thought about bringing over somebody. They lived in freedom 1-1n\nAmerica. Af -- during the war, packages. They could pay in packages. Then the other\nthing I ask them, \u201cDid you ever think about it, you did business a lot, to go to Turkey, to\ngo to Switzerland, to go to any neutral country, and to be there, and maybe for money, to\nbribe, to give some German official money, and he could do something somebody should\ncome out.\u201d There were Jews who did it. I know rabbis who were taken out during the\ntime from ghettos, because they had followers here. They had followers in America, and\nthey went out and they bribed. Germans liked money. Fo-For -- for money you could do a\n-- the Gestapo could be bribed. I said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go, you -- you were here making\n-- making money, why didn\u2019t you go there to Turkey? In Turkey there were special\nGermans that they made arrangements. You paid them off, you could bring over the famil\n-- or some from the family. You didn\u2019t do it.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t think about it.\u201d \u201cNow you are\ncrying they are dead? Now when I survived already the war, I wrote to you -- I wrote to\nyou to send me affidavit, did you send me an affidavit? No. This was already after the\nwar. So the Joint Distribution Committee had to send me affidavit, and they paid for the\naffidavit. I had a brother here. You didn\u2019t do it.\u201d A other thing. My -- I had a -- I had a\nbrother-in-law, and he came from a ver -- from a rabbinical family. And once, in 1937,\none of the rabbis came for a visit to us. And he was his cousin. When he went back, so\nmy brother-in-law said to him, \u201cYou know, my wife has uncles, one is a doctor, one is a\ndentist, one is a manufacturer. See if they could send us the affidavits.\u201d He went to\nAmerica, and we didn\u2019t hear anything. So we -- he wrote a letter to this rabbi, he said,\n\u201cWell, we asked th -- we asked you to see the family.\u201d He said, \u201cI saw the family. I called\nthem, they didn\u2019t answer. I went to their home, and I told them the whole story, that you\nwant to come, you want to go, you are a nephew with your wife, with the children.\u201d But\nnobody did anything. They didn\u2019t say anything, and they didn\u2019t send you affidav -- only\nwhat they needed 1s affida -- and they were rich, they could do it. So you see, you ask\nabout the Jewish community, the Jewish community didn\u2019t do anything. There was only\none s -- group of the Jewish community, it\u2019s called -- oh, I -- I -- you see, I forgot the\nnames, I -- I know [indecipherable] all right. There was a religious group, they were very\nreligious Jews, and they got together -- Vadatsalla, this was the name. The Vadatsalla got\ntogether money, and they sent over a delegation, and pulled few people to the countries\nwhat I told you. And if they had outstanding Jews, outs -- Jews, I mean rabbis, they\nbrought them out from there. And they are survived, they send money. Now how come\nthe Vadatsalla, a group of religious Jews could do it, and other Jews couldn\u2019t do it? Then\nwe had here a rabbi who was in charge of Zionist organizations. Now when they find out\nfrom Switzerland that Hitler is killing all the Jews -- and they find it out, by the way,\nfrom a German industrialist in Switzerland. He came -- he couldn\u2019t take it, and he went to\nthe representative from the Joint in swi -- in Switzerland, and he told them the whole\nstory. He sent telegrams to England, telegrams to America, telegrams to Roosevelt.\nRoosevelt called Rabbi Weiss, who was in charge, and he said to Rabbi Weiss, \u201cLet\u2019s not\nrock the boats.\u201d And everything was quiet. This man told him everything what happened\nin the concentration camps, in the death camps. They said, \u201cLet\u2019s not rock the boats,\u201d and\nnothing was done. So you blame, naturally, the Germans, they did it. You blame the\ncollaborators, the Ukrainians, the Croatians, the Slovaks, the Lithuanians, the -- the\nLatvians. They all did it. But the American Jews didn\u2019t do what they supposed to do.",

        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Norman Salisitz. This is tape number three, side B. I wanted -- I wanted to ask you,\nNorman, what became of the relationship with your brother?",
        "A: The relationship of my brother was -- well, it was never a relationship like brothers,\nbecause he didn\u2019t know me, I didn\u2019t know him. But when I came, I wanted to know him,\nafter losing my whole family. But it was never -- for instance, I needed a job. I came over\nhere without money, without knowing the language, without having a trade, so I needed -\n- and also, I wanted -- my pride 1 -- was that I wanted to show that I can do something.\nNow, he had a big business, he had a tr -- a trucking business, and I asked him, after I\ncouldn\u2019t get a job, I ask him he should employ me. So his excu -- his answer was -- he\nhad a foreman, and the foreman told him -- now, he was the boss, but the foreman told\nhim well, he shouldn\u2019t give me a job, because when they will have to deliver packages to\nstores, and my English 1s not so well, so how will I deliver the packages? So this was his\nexcuse. In Poland, after the war, being 25 years, I could rose to a rank of a lieutenant\ncolonel. But here, to deliver packages, I was not good, because I wouldn\u2019t read the\naddresses. So, it was not like -- like it should have been done, but according to the other\nfamily members, he was good, because the other family members were worse. I mean\nuncles, cousins, who were Americans. I give you a -- examples. I had -- my father had a\nfirst cousin here, his name was Showel Salishitz, he became one of the largest silk lining\nmanufacturers. If somebody had a fur coat, the silk, the lining, came from his fa -- he had\nseven factories. He retired when I came, the children took over the -- the business. I went\nover to him with one uncle, I had one uncle was very nice, he was the poor uncle, he\nnever made a living. He didn\u2019t have time to make a living because everything was on his\nhead. So he went over with me, and we went over, and so it was a Sunday morning, so he\nsaid, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t own the business, my son Saul has the business. But if you will\ngo to him, he probably would give you a job, because we have 300 people working by\nus.\u201d I went over to him, was on a Sunday morning, I put in my best suit, a European suit.\nIt was not so fashionable in America, but for me it was good. I came in, and there was the\nreceptionist, a beautiful, blonde girl. And she ask me what I want. So I said to her as\nmuch as I spoke English, that I want to see Mr. Salishitz. \u201cWho should I say 1s calling?\u201d\nSo I said, \u201cTell him it\u2019s his cousin from Europe.\u201d After a few minutes she took me in. He\nwas sitting by a bis -- big desk, and I came in, I never saw him before. He ne -- he didn\u2019t\nget up, he didn\u2019t give me a cent. And he was lick -- he looked at me, he said, \u201cWhat can I\ndo for you?\u201d I says, \u201cWell, I saw you father yesterday, and I\u2019m looking for a job, and he\nis my father\u2019s first cousin, so that means we are second cousins, we have the same\nname.\u201d This was before I changed the name. \u201cSo, he said you probably could give me a\njob.\u201d He looked at me, didn\u2019t say anything, he took out his wallet. He took out from the\nwallet a hundred dollar bill. He put it on the desk, and he said, \u201cTake it and get off my\nback.\u201d When he said it to me, I couldn\u2019t answer anything. I wanted to cry, but nothing\ncame out. My eyes filled up with tears, and I looked at him, and the minute I looked with\nhim -- at him, so I imagined w -- how would we be if he would come to Poland for a visit\nwhen I was in the military? And I imagined that I would make a special review, I will\nstay on the -- on the -- on the reviewing stand with him, the army will go through, the\nmusic will play, I will salute, and I will introduce this is my cousin from America. He\nsaid -- the money was laying on the floor -- on the table. Then he said, \u201cWell, on the\nsecond thought, I will give it to the United Jewish Appeal, let them do what they want.\u201d\nAnd he took it and put it back in his wallet. I run out, and as I came in, where this\nreceptionist was sitting, I burst out, not with a cry, I burst out like with a sob, like some\n[gasps]. I couldn\u2019t cry, I couldn\u2019t [inaudible]. She said, \u201cWhat happened, what happened?\nShould I call a doctor?\u201d I said no, and I went out to the hallway, and when I staying in the\nhallway, and I was crying. I was 27 years old. A man goes through, he sees I\u2019m staying\nthere and crying, he said, \u201cHey mister, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d And I said to him, \u201cAre you\nJewish?\u201d He said yes. I said, \u201cI wish you would be in Auschwitz.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy are you\nsending me to Auschwitz?\u201d I said, \u201cWhy should my father be killed because he\u2019s a Jew,\nand you are sitting here, you have everything, and you are not being killed.\u201d And I tol -- I\ndon\u2019t know why I told him this. I was -- when I came out, I was so bitter. So he said,\n\u201cHey mister, wa -- I want to know why you\u2019re telling me this.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to\ntalk to you.\u201d Well, all those stories I have in this new book. He said to me, \u201cDo you eat\nlunch?\u201d I said no. I said, \u201cCome with me to eat lunch.\u201d I went with him, we went down to\na -- to a cafeteria, he ask me what I want, I said, \u201cNo, I will have the same thing as you\nhave.\u201d He ordered, I remember, and I will never forget, he ordered topcheese, sour cream,\nand chopped vegetable, radishes, and onions, and everything mixed up. He had it, I had\nit, it was wonderful. I a -- ate it, he said to me, \u201cDo you want a other one?\u201d I said no. He\nsaid, \u201cNow, tell me the story.\u201d So I told him the story about this. So happens that this\nman was a buyer in their company. He knew him. He says, \u201cWhat I want is you should\ngo with me up there, and you should punch this son of a bitch in his mouth, and I want to\nsee blood. Don\u2019t worry, nothing will happen to you, I will be with you.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\ndon\u2019t want to go, but the one thing I can promise you is that so long as I will live, I will\nnever speak to him again.\u201d He said -- we finished, he said, \u201cHere is my card. Come and\nsee me.\u201d But a few days later I came and saw him -- I remember his name was Louie\nSegal. See, things like this you don\u2019t forget. I came to him, and he was a converter. You\nknow what a converter, they -- they send over raw material to be dyed, and everything,\nbut anyway -- and he sold remnants. In this time I say remnants\u2019s, because there was a\nlot, 1t\u2019s remnants\u2019s. One is a remnant. I didn\u2019t know that you say [indecipherable]. So he\nsaid to me, \u201cI will give you every week a case of remnant, and will charge you what I pay\nfor it, 45 cents a pound.\u201d He gave me a address where to go and sell it. He said, \u201cYou go\nand sell it, and they will pay you three dollars 50 a pound.\u201d He could sell it, he sold his.\nHe gave me a case of remnant, I picked it up, and I went to those people. I made -- every\nweek I made a few hundred dollars. He did 1t every week. He was a stranger. Every time\nI came to him, he said, \u201cI still want you should go with me to this son of a bitch.\u201d Always\nhe said this. Then later something happened that he did something, it was not hundred\npercent, he lost all his connections, and I was out of it. Do -- yeah, so I\u2019m telling you an -\n- a episode from my family. Tell you other episodes when I came over. So my family\nstarted in what should we do -- they called me the boyjik. You know, in Yiddish you say,\na boy, a boyyik, yeah. They got together to think how they should do -- I should make a\nliving. And they brought me to a uncle whose son had the big factory from bluebell\ndungarees. You heard about blue baga -- bell -- well, a big factory. So they were sitting\nthere from the family, started to talk, then, what should we do with him. So, the first thing\nis, we have to change his name, because he cannot have a name like Salishitz, a long\nname. So the family had different names, the family -- some had Sales, some had Sallis,\nsome had Sanders, some had Saleeshi. All different names. They didn\u2019t get along with\nthem, they didn\u2019t want to have the same name. My brother\u2019s name was Salsitz, I said\nSalsitz. Now the first name. What should be -- my name was Naftali, Naftali\u2019s not for\nAmerica. Well, the name -- maybe we should make it from Nathan, for short is Nat. I\ndidn\u2019t like the word Nat, because Russia, nyet means no, everything is no. So I said, \u201cNo,\nI don\u2019t like it.\u201d Norbert, there was alread -- there was already a Norbert, because every\nbro -- see, my father had seven sisters and brothers, all of them had children the same\nage, and when my grandfather died, Naftali, everybody had his son Naftali. So one was\nNorbert, no good, one was Nolan, so Nolan. And so on, and so on. So one said, \u201cWell,\nwhat\u2019s about Norman?\u201d So I ask him, \u201cNorman?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d Nathan, Nat, what I didn\u2019t\nlike, so one said, \u201cWell, how much can he make by a name, Nathan? The most he can\nmake 35 dollars a week.\u201d So I ask him Norman, how can Norman -- oh, Norman\u2019s a\nbetter -- nice name, you can go up to 65 dollars. So I started to think in my head, I will\nlive til 80 years, and I will make 30 dollars a week more by having the name Norman,\njust for the name I\u2019m going to die a millionaire. So I said, \u201cI want to have Norman.\u201d They\ngave me Norman. So my name was Norman Salsitz. Then they said, \u201cYou have to have a\ncemetery plot. In America everybody has to have a cemetery plot.\u201d So I said, \u201cI\u2019m 27\nyears old.\u201d \u201cNo, there is a saying in America, the saying 1s, it\u2019s better to have and not to\nneed it, than to need it and not to have.\u201d They had a family cemetery plot, they sold me\nfour plots. I didn\u2019t have children. Four plots for 300 dollars, you can pay it up. I still have\nit. Four -- solda -- cemetery plot. Then later a job. The most important thing, how\u2019s about\na job? So one uncle said, \u201cWell, you know, it would be nice if he could be a salesman for\nthe company.\u201d So the others said, \u201cA salesman? He doesn\u2019t speak English, how can he go\nand [indecipherable]?\u201d Then one said, \u201cHe can be a cutter.\u201d So the other one said, \u201cA\ncutter? In the union? He will never get in the union.\u201d Then one said, \u201cA designer.\u201d Well,\nanyway, everything was the union, the union. So one uncle was smart, and a cousin, he\nsaid, \u201cWell, if he can be a machine -- a ma -- to fix mach -- yeah, a machinist.\u201d No good.\nTo fix machines he can be a independent contractor, he doesn\u2019t need the union, and he\ncan fix the machines from your factory. Wonderful. So one said, \u201cDo you know\nsomething about machines?\u201d I said, \u201cThere is one machine that I can take the machine\napart blindfolded, I can put it together blindfolded, I know this machine through and\nthrough.\u201d \u201cGood, good, is it a Singer machine?\u201d I said no. \u201cSo what kind of machine 1s\nit?\u201d I said, \u201cA machine gun.\u201d When I said a machine gun, they all got quiet, and they\nknew -- because I knew I wouldn\u2019t get the job from them. So I walked out with a new\nname, with four pem -- pr -- family plots, no job.",
        "Q: Where did -- where did you stay at all -- all this time? With your brother?",
        "A: Oh, with my brother.",
        "Q: Still with your brother.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it was my brother, yeah.",
        "Q: And your wife was there?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did your brother ca -- Lyebish, did he come to America?",
        "A: No, he came about a half a year later, yeah. So -- so wait. So -- so I no job, but I had a\nproblem with my name, with my second name, with Salsitz, I have a big problem. Later, I\nwent in, I be -- I got jobs. I got, during the first year, I got about 10 jobs. Most of the jobs\nI was fired, cause I have a big mouth. S -- I wanted to tell the boss something to improve\nsomething, he said, \u201cWho the hell are you to tell me to improve something?\u201d I was fired.\nThen later I became a peddler, you know what a peddler is? I used to sell from house to\nhouse things. There\u2019s a stories about the peddler, I think. So then later I -- from peddler I\nadvanced, I sold first socks, then later dresses, t-til I became -- I sold furniture, only\nfurniture, I had a warehouse. So there was one man, he was a manufacturer of -- of\nfurniture, I remember his name was Horowitz. He had his office on Canal Street in New\nYork. So I went in, I wanted to buy some furniture. So the girl ask me down -- said,\n\u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d So I said, \u201cI -- I\u2019m Mr. Salsitz.\u201d\u2019 So the way she heard it, she\nthought I said that I am Mr. Saul Shit, because they wen -- so she calls up the man\nupstairs, and I could hear it, she said, \u201cThere is a man, but his name 1s Saul Shit.\u201d I went -\n- SO -- So I -- so she said to me, \u201cGo up,\u201d and I went up. So the man had to me -- to say --\nand I heard what she said, so she said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you, mister -- it\u2019s nice to see you\nmister,\u201d -- So I said to him, \u201cYou can call me by first name.\u201d \u201cSaul, it\u2019s a pleasure.\u201d And\neverything I wanted from this man, he did it because I told him he should call me my first\nname, so he didn\u2019t have to call me my last name, Mr. Shit. So this was -- those are the --\nthe -- the -- the -- the s -- in the beginning, what I -- I told you there are some comical\nstories, but there -- there are -- it\u2019s true stories. And -- and -- and -- and this is how -- and\nthen later, after I was a peddler, about -- about 10 years, then later I became a devel -- a\nbuilder. I got -- I got a customer, he was a Italian guy, his name was Joe Rulore, and he\nwas -- he made a small stuff, like a sidewalk. I said, \u201cJoe, everybody\u2019s a builder, why\ncan\u2019t we become builders?\u201d He never was a builder. So I said, \u201cYou know what, I will\nbuy a lot, and you put up the house.\u201d So I bought a lot to put in the first house\n[indecipherable], and we made out all right. And then later he was afraid to buy more, so\nthen later I bought land, I subdivided the land, and I had the construction company, and I\nmade all all right, yeah.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s the profession you stayed in?",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: In -- in Poland you had wund -- I na -- you remember that you said your -- your\ndreams was to become either a --",
        "A: A doctor or an actor.",
        "Q: A doctor or an actor.",
        "A: Yeah, but here I couldn\u2019t be a doctor, and I couldn\u2019t be an actor. An actor maybe I am,\nbut in my own way. So now -- so -- so I -- I did all right, and -- and I developed, and --\nand I built, and then later I took in partners. Then later, my family was proud of me. I\nmade a living, so I remember we had the family circle organization, and when I started to\nmake money, I bought my wife a mink stole. And this time a mink\u2019s -- it was the first\nmink stole in the family. So when we came to a meeting, so -- they elected me for the\npresident of the si -- family circle. You know, they took me, and they -- they went with\nme to the front. So when they said, \u201cYou are the president from the family circles,\u201d I took\noff my wife\u2019s mink stole, and I said, \u201cPlease meet the president of the family circle.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d So I said, \u201cIf I wouldn\u2019t be able to buy a mink stole, I would\nnever be a president of my family circle.\u201d They didn\u2019t like it. Okay. So -- so -- so they --\nthen later they started to say -- I started to make a good living, they said, \u201cWell, he is all\nright. He is all right. We put him on his feet.\u201d Nobody did anything, they put me on his\nfeet. So --",
        "Q: I -- I -- I wanted to ask you one --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- one question. Your life has been very much impacted by betrayals.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: A lot of betrayals --",
        "A: A lot of them.",
        "Q: -- by very close people, by -- by friends of yours.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: And in a sense now in America, even by family [indecipherable]",
        "A: Mm, yeah.",
        "Q: How does one -- and it\u2019s so -- for so many years, how did you learn to adjust to\nnormal life, and to trust people again?",
        "A: Well, because I had people who I -- who were good to me. I had people wel -- those\nwere -- you see like, for instance, my wife had an uncle here. She never knew him, in the\nend she never me -- this was a sister of her grandmother. When we came over, they\nbecame very cl -- they -- they -- they wanted to do anything for us. And they were\npractically strangers. I remember when I was a peddler, and it was before Christmas that I\nused to give out merchandise, and they paid me out two dollars a week, three dollars a\nweek. I didn\u2019t have money in the beginning. So this man came, and he brought me a\nblank check, a signed check. He said, \u201cYou need the money, make it out as much as you\nwant.\u201d I never used the check because it was not -- it was blank. I never use it. But he\ngave it to me. I mean, he gave it to me, I gave him back the check. So there were people\nwho were very -- strangers, who were very good to me, and to my wife. But the people\nthat I expect them to be good, they were not. The same thing in Poland. There were\npeople, peasants I didn\u2019t know, and they were very -- they saved my life. But the people\nwho I knew, they were not. Maybe the people who I knew, they thought that they had,\nbecause they know me, they have a right to do it. And the people who didn\u2019t know me\ndid it because from the goodness of their heart. It was me or somebody else, that they\nwould do it for everybody. But here in America, I was very, very disappointed. There\nwere some who were very nice, who couldn\u2019t do -- like for instance, I remember I had\nhere a first cousin. She\u2019s still alive. And the first cousin, I wanted to see her. I never saw\nher, because she was born in America. I know my father got gray on account of her,\nbecause she was already 32 years and she wasn\u2019t married. So here in Europe he was\nworrying -- he always -- my father, he had a habit, if he was worrying, he used to bite his\nbeard, he had a long beard. So you -- so when he start to bite his beard, so my mother\nsaid, \u201cWhat are you worried again because Frances is not married?\u201d She already knew.\nSo when I came over here, she was -- she was already married, and I was here about six\nmonths, once I called her up, and I said to her, \u201cFrances, I\u2019m here already six months, I\nwould like to see you.\u201d So she said, \u201cYeah, yeah, come over sometimes.\u201d I said,\n\u201cSometimes is no good. Today is Sunday, I don\u2019t work, how\u2019s about if I will come over\ntoday?\u201d She said, \u201cOh, today is no good, because I invited already some guests.\u201d She\ninvited guests, which she was afraid to this animal should come and introduce me? We\nwanted to meet people, we wanted to get somebody, we wanted to have friends. So she\nsaid -- when she told me -- she told me as I was in the telephone booth, because we didn\u2019t\nhave a telephone. No, well -- she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go -- let\u2019s see us sometimes.\u201d So I said,\n\u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong today?\u201d So she said, \u201cI already invited some guests.\u201d So those were the\nthings that they were -- but, like when instance my wife has a aunt from her -- the aunt di-\ndidn\u2019t stay with -- with -- with her husband, but the husband was her father\u2019s brother. But\nwhen we came, she took us in like the ga -- we would be their children. But with the\nchildren, til today we are very close. There is a son who was our age, he didn\u2019t go out on\na date if he wouldn\u2019t invite us to go on the same date. He took us the first time to Radio\nCity, to show. And all those -- every place he went. There were people, but the people\nthat you expected the most. And I have an a -- an answer for what. You see, my family,\nmy father, from the seven sisters and brother, he was the only who remained home. All of\nthem came over here in the ninet -- in the 1880\u2019s. One came -- and they were very poor.\nThey come from a village. They never saw -- they never were educated. And they told\ntheir children -- well, they children went already to college, you know, they were\n[indecipherable] they got professions. They told their children their life, how they lived in\nthis village, in the 1880\u2019s. When we came, they looked at us with the same eyes. Why?\nBecause they forgot, or they didn\u2019t know that America had a progress from 1880 to 1947.\nWe had a progress 1n our house -- in our home. Maybe not so fast as here. They couldn\u2019t\nunderstand, they ask my wife what she will do. She said, \u201cWell, I studied medicine home,\nI would like to continue.\u201d But this was out of question. She said, \u201cI can be a teacher. I can\nbe a Hebrew teacher.\u201d They showed us, \u201cYou see here hair? Like hair will grow here, so\ncan you be a teacher.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cTo be a teacher here you have to go to college.\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cI went to college.\u201d They couldn\u2019t understand this. Why? Because they knew the\nstories from their parents, and they looked at us like we would come out from this village\nin 1880. And for this reason they had a different feel. Now, for instance, I told my wife,\n\u201cWe go to America, and we\u2019ll have a lot of friends, because all my cousins are my age.\nSo we will have something in common.\u201d They never invited us to -- to go out with them,\nthey never invited us to go to a theater together.",
        "Q: When you -- when you did make friends, finally, were they mostly other survivors, or",
        "A: Yes. Mostly other -- there were some exceptions. Mostly other survivors, because we\nhad a common language, we had a common past, and everybody tells a -- mostly others --\neven til today. There are some exceptions, that they are Americans. Again, the same\nthing. We are strangers, we are outsiders. There are some that -- and some, if we started\nto make good. So some were jealous. I have a cousin, so when I had the first apartment in\nBensonhurst, I bought beautiful, new furniture, 1t was under water. And the cousin went\nto college here, and he hardly had the job. So the mother and father came to visit me, so I\nheard -- she said to with th -- to the husband. \u201cLook, look, Albert went to college. Look,\nhe\u2019s a greener, he just came. Look at his beautiful apartment.\u201d Instead to be happy that\nwe did it, and nobody gave us a penny, and they -- a lot of American people who didn\u2019t\nmake it, they look at us, and they are jealous. Why? Because we did better than they. But\nwe are mostly comfortable with survivors. We know their stories, they know my stories.\nWe know their pain, they -- in this. So mostly where we have [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you continue at that time, even after those first upsetting experiences, to -- to\nspeak, to talk about your experience, or was it [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, I always spoke.",
        "Q: You always --",
        "A: I always spoke, I never -- I never stopped, even in the beginning, people didn\u2019t want to\nlisten, I always -- I -- see, my wife didn\u2019t. I always -- some other survivors didn\u2019t. I\nalways wrote about it, and I -- I never stopped telling. Other people, even today, they say,\n\u201cWell, you know, you are obsessed with the Holocaust.\u201d I tell you a other thing what\nhappened two weeks ago. And this 1s a thing that I spoke a week later in Queens, and I\ntold the story, they couldn\u2019t believe it. I am an -- on the board of the B\u2019nai Brith. You\nknow the B\u2019nai Brith yeah? So, I am on the executive board, and we have meetings once\na week. So when we had the meeting two weeks ago -- so we started to make plans for\nthe next year for our meetings, what will be our meetings, what will be [indecipherable].\nSo one came out, and he said, \u201cWell, last year we had a meeting, we had the movie. And\nwe had a lot of people, and the people appreciated the movie. So let\u2019s have a movie next\nweek t -- next year, too. So -- so one said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll have a movie, I know a nice\nmovie by Woody Allen, from 1934, a comedy.\u201d Well, I personally don\u2019t like Woody\nAllen, he\u2019s not my type, and his comedies are not -- so there -- they started that. So I said,\n\u201cWell, instead to have a Woody Allen comedy, there is a new tape came out, I just -- I\nhave it here, about two ladies who saved Jews during the war. One is from Poland, and\none is from France. Beautiful film. It is about the Holocaust, but it is not so bloody, it 1s\nnot so depressing. But it\u2019s a beautiful -- to see what the two ladies did -- they saved. I\nhave it here. So let\u2019s have this movie.\u201d When I said this, one man gets up, he said, \u201cYou\nstop with this crap about the Holocaust. I had this crap enough. I don\u2019t want to listen to\nthis crap.\u201d First I thought crap, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s with a P, with a B, so I figured maybe\nhe doesn\u2019t like to eat crabmeat, I don\u2019t know. Later I find out it\u2019s with a P. And he started\non the crap, and crap, and crap, yeah. In the beginning, w -- I looked at him, I couldn\u2019t\nsay anything, because I was so -- I couldn\u2019t believe it. So I said to him, \u201cDo you know\nthat the Holocaust, it happened to me fif,\u201d -- [clock chiming] Okay. I\u2019m waiting for the\nbird.",
        "Q: Well, maybe we should just wait for the birds --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- because I\u2019m sort of at the end of the tape again, too. Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s --",
        "A: Okay, now. No, no, notay. No, le -- Pll finish it. So I said, \u201cDo you know, six million\nJews were killed. It only happened 50 years ago. Survivors are still alive. What do we\ndemand from people who are not Jews, if there are deniers? 250 books were written by\nnon-Jews that the Holocaust never happened. Here, on a Jewish organization, you started\nthe story with the crap business?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat -- we suffer.\u201d I said, \u201cYou? What did you\nsuffer? You suffered? You have your parents, you have your children, you have your\ngrandchildren, they are here. Surely, you suffer, because I know you couldn\u2019t get enough\nsteaks, because steaks you couldn\u2019t buy enough, you had to eat chicken. Every day you\nhad to eat chicken. You couldn\u2019t have enough sugar, it was rationed. You didn\u2019t have\nenough toilet paper, it was rationed, so you suffered.\u201d I said, \u201cI am still alive. People are\nstill alive. It was 50 years ago, a million and a half children. And when I say Holocaust,\nyou say this is crap?\u201d I had a ver -- I almost dropped dead. Now, what gets me more -- I\nwalked out. Now, I will never go to a other meeting there. What gets me more is that\nfrom all -- there were 18 people. From all the 18 people, nobody stood up and said a\nword. Nobody. If it will be another occasion if I will be there, I wouldn\u2019t sit quiet. I mix\nin. Nobody said a word. I walked home. A man born in America, went to college in\nAmerica, and he said, \u201cStop with this crap. I heard this crap enough.\u201d",
        "Q: This is the end of tape three, side B, interview with Norman Salsitz.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nNorman Salsitz. This is tape number four, side A. Before we get back to America, I\nwanted to ask you, have you ever gone to Palestine? I know that your family was always\nZionist oriented, and Maya\u2019s family is also very str -- was very strongly Zionist. Did you\never go?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And whe -- and when?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t go to Palestine, because when we came from Germany, we came to\nAmerica, and in this time, I wanted -- I started to work here in -- there are -- there were --\nwhen I came to America in 1947, I started to work in our organization, it was the -- not\nthe Hagannah, it started -- 1t worked in the organization, it was more to the right. It was\nthe ha -- the -- it\u2019s like from the hirute, more with Begin\u2019s organization. And I wanted to\ngo to fight, because this was my dream, to go to fight, I told you earlier.",
        "Q: Actually, I meant as a visit, because I understand that your [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well -- well, we come --",
        "Q: But did you ever visit?",
        "A: -- so I -- f -- 31 times [indecipherable]. So -- so I wanted to go to fight. Then I got in\ncontact -- they contact me. There was a Major Wiser, he was a major of the English army,\nand he was actually from South America, but he was in the English army. He came over\nhere, he organized a group, and he called it the George Washington Legion. And he\nwanted to have a group here to be equipped in America, like there was once a Irish army\nthat they went there. And he wanted to go with this group to Palestine, in this time before\nIsrael was a state, in to fight. And I was involved with this group, and we had me -- had\nmeetings every single week, and he, because on my background from Poland, I became\nthe head of the military police in this group, because we had to have a military police.\nWell, anyway, we had to go, and we had quite a bit volunteers, and we also had, between\n-- we had mostly Jews, veterans, but y -- we also had a few Black who joined us, who\nwent -- came up in the ran -- but we also had a few Irish. Now, the Irish veterans, they\nsaid they didn\u2019t care where they go to fight, so long it\u2019s against England. And this was\nagainst England. So it was funny. So we -- we organized it, and we had to be equipped,\nand then later the American government didn\u2019t allow it. They said we will not allow the\nequipped army to go, and it fell apart, so I started to work in the other organizations, and\nto go to Israel. And I was ready to go to Palestine in this time, and we send out in this\ntime, people individual to ru -- to go to Marseille, and from Marseille, they dropped us to\nPalestine to fight. And one, it was on a Friday I remember, and it came -- my wife knew\nthat I belonged there, but she didn\u2019t know exactly what. Friday I came, and I said,\n\u201cSunday morning, I am going. It\u2019s my turn to go,\u201d which I was very happy. So she was\nnot angry, she said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s your choice if you want to go. But one thing you should\nknow, if you go, you have no way to come back. I will not wait for you, because I lost\nenough people my family, and I don\u2019t want to have somebody else to lose. And I know if\nyou will go, you will be killed, or you will be wounded, and I don\u2019t want -- so, it\u2019s your --\nyour choice to go.\u201d Well, we had the whole day to think about it. Sunday morning the\ngroup left, and I didn\u2019t go. And I was -- now, if people will ask me -- if people will ask\nme what is my biggest regret in life, there are a lot of things that I regret, but my biggest\nregret in life is that I didn\u2019t go to Palestine to fight. If I survived the war, and I didn\u2019t go\nto Palestine, this makes me somebody -- I don\u2019t want to say a traitor, but some -- this is\nmy biggest regret. Because if somebody will tell me that I will have a choice, and a\nchance to be in Palestine for one day -- I think I told you this yesterday, if I will be --\nhave a choice to be in Palestine to fight for pa -- for a Jewish state one day, and the next\nday to be killed, I will always say that this would be my choice. Because if I could do it\nfor Poland, which I was not a first class citizen, I should have done it for Palestine, and I\ndidn\u2019t go. In 1939 -- in 1949, after we started to make a few dollars, my wife was a\nHebrew teacher, and this time they send over a group of Hebrew teachers for courses to\nJerusalem, which she didn\u2019t need it, but she went anyway. This was the first plane that\nwent with visitors to Palestine. So we went, and we went to stay there. We went to settle\nthere. The family [indecipherable] had a family, and they said, \u201cYou are in America, and\nIsrael is very bad now.\u201d People didn\u2019t have work, didn\u2019t have what to eat. \u201cSo, if you\ncome over, you -- you missed your chance, because there is no work. During the war we\ncould use you. Now, you missed your chance, there is no war, so you better go to\nAmerica, make money, send us the money.\u201d So we didn\u2019t stay there, but, I have to tell\nyou one -- this was the first trip, we were in 1949. Since then, my wife and I, we were\nthere 31 times, but I was more than 31 times, but I\u2019m say -- staying for the 31 times. The\n-- th-the time in 20 -- in 1949, when I was a -- I met then a young fellow, his name is\nLonna Guerrera. And he was in my unit, he was a captain in my unit, and then later he\nwent to Palestine, and he was -- he fought there in the war. When am -- I met him in\nJerusalem, he was a major, and he was very glad to see me, so he said, \u201cI have to show\nyou something.\u201d And he took me to a place in Jerusalem, you know, in this time\nJerusalem was divided, and he took me to a place where there was a wall, and in the wall\nyou could see new cinder blocks put in in a hole -- in the -- replaced. So he told me that --\nthat his group, they wanted to break through, and to go and to liberate the old part of\nJerusalem, but they were not enough, and more than half were killed, and the rest came\nback, and he was one who was saved, and he showed me this. When he showed me this, I\nstarted to cry. And he ask me, \u201cWhat are you crying?\u201d He said, \u201cDo you know why you\ndidn\u2019t take it in this time? Because I wasn\u2019t here. Because I wasn\u2019t here, and for this\nreason [indecipherable].\u201d So he said, \u201cWhat do you mean? We were about 80 people, and\nwhat would me -- make a difference if you would be here? You probably would be killed,\ntoo.\u201d Cause I always was the first one. I said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not only me. Because if I would be\nhere, and thousands like me, or two thousands like me, we would be able to take it. I\nwasn\u2019t here, 2,000 like me who survived were not here, and for this reason you couldn\u2019t\ntake it.\u201d So I will never forget this -- this minute, when he showed me this. And I felt\nvery -- I had very -- a big regret. Even America 1s very good for me, I have everything in\nAmerica, there is not a thing that I cannot have. But this was my place. If I survived the\nwar, from the whole family, and if I -- in Israel, had a war of independence, and I wasn\u2019t\nthere, this was wrong.",
        "Q: Did you feel Jewish in a different way in Israel than in America? Your identity as a\nJewish person?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t feel Jewish -- you see, you -- the different how you feel Jewish. Now, you\nsee, I was very religious home. I am not religious now. I am not religious, I don\u2019t know\nhow far I believe, or disbelieve, I don\u2019t want to think about it, but I am not religious,\nwhy\u201d? Because, when I needed God, He wasn\u2019t there. Now, you ask a question why. See, I\ndidn\u2019t make peace yet with God. When my n-nieces needed God, He wasn\u2019t there. But\nbeing a Jew, to me, is something else. Being a Jew -- I am proud of being a Jew, because\nwe survived 4,000 years. People who were stronger than the Jews, more than the Jews,\nthey vanished. Who were on their own ground, on the [indecipherable] place, they\nvanished. Jews were not on their places, they somehow survived. Jews were sa -- were\ntortured and killed for so many places, started with the Crusaders, with the Inquisition,\nwith the Chminiski, with the pogroms, with all those things, finally with the Holocaust,\nthey survived. So for me, being a Jew is something else; that we survived. And also, what\nwe gave the world. We gave the world so much, more than any other people. The\nGermans gave the world a lot of things. They get artists, and players, and this and that.\nBut they gave also a lot of misery. We Jews didn\u2019t give misery, we Jews contributed, and\neven til today, ta -- in every field, doctors, scientists, everything you -- singers, actors,\nJews contribute, starting with the ancient times. The Jews contribute the 10\ncommandments. No other people contributed the 10 commandments. Now, if the God --\nlet\u2019s say you belo -- you believe in God. If God wanted to choose a family, and to bring\nlike the Catholics say, to bring the son for the world, who did He pick out? He didn\u2019t pick\nout the Mexican family. He didn\u2019t pick out the Irish family, or a German family. He\npicked out a Jewish family, who were very religious. And they He picked out, and there\nwas created a Jesus. I don\u2019t believe in it. I believe Jesus was a great man, but he was a\nman, that\u2019s all. He never dreamt about being a God. Because if you will tell Jesus when\nhe was alive that he would be a God, he would probably commit suicide, cause he was a\nvery good Jew. But God, let\u2019s say I\u2019m n-now saying from the sight of the non-Jews, if he\ncreate -- he w -- he picked out -- he picked out a Jew. Why? So the Jews gave the world a\nGod. 2,000 years later, look, a billion people believed in him. Did they get a thanks for it?\nNo. They didn\u2019t get a thanks, well you gave us a God. They killed the Jews for the God.\nNow, they say that Jews are Christ killers. Now, this is not true. I was interviewed two\nyears ago, and there was a question about the Holocaust, then wha -- was a t-time that\npeople ask questions, and one man asked the question, he said, \u201cIsn\u2019t there -- isn\u2019t this a\ntime to forget and forgive?\u201d So the man -- the moderator said he\u2019s going to answer it, I\nsaid no, this -- I answer this. So when I ask this man, I said, \u201cTell me, what nationality\nare you?\u201d He said, \u201cPolish.\u201d \u201cWhat is your profession?\u201d He said, \u201cA priest.\u201d So I said to\nhim, \u201cYou asked, isn\u2019t it time to forget and forgive?\u201d I said, \u201cThis happened 50 years\nago.\u201d I said to him, \u201cDo you know there was a nice Jewish young man 2,000 years ago,\nand he was killed, not by the Jews, he was killed. Did you forgot and forgive 2,000 years\nlater? Here, a million and a half childrens were killed, and you ask to forget and forgive?\u201d\nHe hung up, he didn\u2019t answer. So, this what gives me, the Jews, in every respect, in\neverything, they contributed. They contributed in Germany. You had famous writers in\nGermany. Later, they were forbidden. You have famous composers in Germany. You\nhave famous composers in Vienna. You have famous psychiatrists in Vienna, the first\ncasa -- psychi -- Freud was in Vienna, and so on. Did the Jews get a thanks for it? No.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with Mendelsohn, what is wr-wrong with Lessing? What is -- one -- and\nnow we start to -- to -- to -- to give all those a -- so this is -- and also, they were always\nheld back, they never had a place to go ahead. Thank God in America they don\u2019t --\nnobody holds them back. But they doing all the generations, they always were held back.\nBut still somebody said, \u201cJews are like quicksilver.\u201d\u201d You know what quicksilver is?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: When you try to press it down, it always runs away, it always -- the quicksilver run.\nSo the other said no. Jews is like a bamboo stick. Take a bamboo stick, you bend it down,\nit straightens out, always. And this how Jews are. For this reason I am proud to be a Jew.\nMy heritage gave to the world a lot. We\u2019re not appreciated for it. We are capable. We\ncome to a country, maybe we establish ourself better than others. Maybe we are better\nbusinessmen, maybe we think a little more. Well, there is a -- a -- a joke, and I don\u2019t\nknow if you will like this joke.",
        "Q: Well, tell it anyway.",
        "A: There wa -- there was an auction, and they sold brains from different nationality, you\nknow the story?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. So they sold a brain -- there was a brain for fives dollars, a brain for 10, and there\nwas -- to transplant brains. A brain for 50 dollars, a brain for a hundred dollars, and a\nbrain for thousand dollars. They took a Russian brain, the Russian brain was -- no, the\nPolish brain, the Polish brain was the cheapest, five dollars. Then they took a Russian\nbrain, was 20 dollars. Then they took a English brain, 50 dollars. A German brain,\nhundred dollars, a Jewish brain, thousand dollars. No, I said the story wrong. I said the\nstory wrong. It was --",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s -- let\u2019s do again.",
        "A: It was the opposite, it was the opposite. The -- the -- the -- the Polish brain was -- was\nthousand dollars, the -- the -- the what\u2019s I said? Russians --",
        "Q: Russians.",
        "A: -- was hundred dollars. The German was -- the Jewish brain was the cheapest, five\ndollars. They ask, why is the Jewish brain the cheapest? He said, because this is a used\nbrain, so this is the cheapest. The Polish brain was not used, so you had to pay thousand\ndollars for it. Now, I don\u2019t think so this -- so, I -- I don\u2019t know why I made the mistake,\nbut it --",
        "Q: Well, I would like to ask you for another joke --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: But let me -- let me go back just [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, but this is -- but this is -- but this 1s -- this is what I think, yeah.",
        "Q: Let me ask you just one more question about Palestine. H-How did you feel that\nsurvivors were perceived there? Was it different, the image that -- or the way people\nresponded to you as a survivor than in America, or was it --",
        "A: No, because there were -- the majority of -- don\u2019t forget, when Israel -- when the\nPalestine was -- before Palestine there was 400,000 Jews, 450,000 Jews, and then later,\nwhen the people start to come in, come in, come in, there are four million Jews. So\nmajority, people who survived went to Palestine, later to Israel. And there are the\nchildren of the survivors, so there are the majority of the people who survived. So you\ndidn\u2019t have the feeling that you are an outsider. And also, when I came to Israel -- when I\nalready came to Israel, I came home. This was my home. When I came over here, and tha\n-- and we had an organization, and I gave a report, how I experienced, how I liked Israel\nin this time. So I remember I told them, I said -- they -- they say -- I had a brother in 1s --\nin Israel. Did you have a lot of friends, and how did they peer -- so I said, when I came to\nIsrael, I had friends all over, all over ma -- I went over to the massada, I had a friends, the\npeople who committed suicide, the massad -- I lived with them. I -- when I went over to\nTeberius, I had friends. In Teberius, there is the rumbum. There 1 -- there 1s old sages that\nI lived with them, I was brought up rabmaya bel harnis, I don\u2019t know if you know there is\na man that they called him the miracle man, he is buried in Teberius. I said, \u201cI came to\nthem, and those were my friends, because I was brought up with them.\u201d I was started\nsince I was three years about them. So you see, all those people were with me. I went to\nMarron, I saw the people who created the caballah, the mystic. Those were my friends.\nSo I came home to Israel, because they were there. It\u2019s the same thing like naturally, a\nChristian goes to Israel, and he walk, and he said, \u201cI am walking the same road that Jesus\nwalked.\u201d I went, and I walked the same day with -- the same road with Jesus, but not with\nthe Jesus who mi -- was made a God hundred fifty years after his death. I walk with Jesus\nwhen he was a Jewish boy, a very religious Jewish boy. So I knew all those things. I\nwalked with Mary, with the mother, that she was a Jewish mother, who lived in Nazareth.\nSo for me, Israel was home. I came home, because I knew the people. The people, I knew\nthem for thousands of years.",
        "Q: But then you could not stay --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- because you were advised to --",
        "A: No, I -- not that I couldn\u2019t stay, because my family told me, and this time was that\ncenter -- I don\u2019t know if you know, there was a question with food, a question with war,\nand the same. If I would bring over money in this time, I didn\u2019t have money. I didn\u2019t\nhave a profession. If I would be a doctor, a carpenter, or anything. I -- I was here, I\nstarted to be a peddler. I couldn\u2019t be a peddler 1wa -- in -- in Israel. I didn\u2019t have one\nJewish customer in America being a peddler. If I -- I couldn\u2019t make a living from a Jew,\nbecause he was smarter than I was. So I had Polish customers. So what will I do in j -- in\na -- what will I do in Israel? Well, somebody who listen to this tape, they will laugh a lot.\nSo -- so -- so what would I do in Israel? I had there a family. My wife had three uncles,\nbut they couldn\u2019t do anything for me. So for this reason they said, \u201cGo back, you are a,\u201d -\n- they said, \u201cwe needed you two years ago, we needed you to fight.\u201d Which I would be\nhappy. \u201cNow, we will have two more mouths to feed. We don\u2019t have the food. Go to\nAmerica, make money.\u201d And this what I did. We went to America, my sister-in-law\nneeded help, somebody else needed help, we were always there to help. Charity we\nneeded -- needed help. So this 1s a difference of but toos -- to live. See, we -- I came -- I\nmissed the boat with Israel.",
        "Q: Yeah. [inaudible]",
        "A: Well [indecipherable]",
        "Q: In -- in the -- in the 1950\u2019s, the Cold War, during that period, did you agree with the\nsentiments there, with the strong feel of -- of Communism, and everything, or did you\nhave --",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t feel commits -- you see, I lived under Communism. You see, in\nCommunism, 1t depends on which side of the fence you are. I was on the right side of the\nfence. Not that I was a Communist. I never belonged to the Communist party. As a matter\nof fact, when I had a big position, the people who were above me always came, and they\ngave out ankettas, to write down to become a member of the Communist party. And they\nalways gave me anketta, and each time the anketta had 25 questions more, always they\nadd more. And every time I g -- I -- I reg -- received a -- you know the anketta is. When I\nreceived the anketta, and they said to fill 1t out to become a Communist party member.\nThe reas -- the answer I s -- gave, I said, \u201cI am not grown enough to be worthy to be a\nmember of the Communist party.\u201d This was my a-answer, and this what they liked. I said,\n\u201cT have to learn a little more about the Communist party, I want to give an answer.\u201d But I\nnever believed, because to me, you see, I come from a very Orthodox family. I come\nfrom a rich family. Now, those two items were alien to Communism. And this was I had\nfrom my home. I give you another example -- you see, I always give you examples.\nWhen I was in Poland, I had dealings with Sappearha. Sappearha was the head of the co -\n- of the Catholic church. He was the cardinal. As a matter of fact, the pope who is now\npope, he was a prodigy of Sappearha. So I had some dealings with Sappearha. I looked\non Sappearha, he was the head of the Catholic church, I looked with him, and I feel\nterrible. Why? The Communism regime -- Communist regime was against him. What did\nhe want? He wanted to have his religion. When I looked on Sappearha, I didn\u2019t see\nSappearha there, pol -- the Catholic cardinal. I saw my rabbi by which I studied. With --\ntil 17 years I studied in the Yeshiva, you know what a Yeshiva is? I saw my rabbi, the\nvery Orthodox Hassidic Jew. I didn\u2019t see Sappearha, I saw my rabbi. Why? Because\nwould he be alive in 1945, he would be treated the same as Sappearha 1s treated, because\nhe will be -- he will represent a religion what the Communism was against, the same\nthing as the Catholic religion. So I saw my rabbi sitting there instead Sappearha. So for\nthis reason, my feelings, when it came to Communism, was different, that mostly young\npeople who embraced -- I never -- and also, my wife was always against this belief, why?\nBecause she comes from a home, and if -- her home suffered very much. Her father lost\nhis job, they threw her out in the apartment, why? Because they were considered the\nbourgeoisie. They were afraid they will send them to Siberia. So you see, the difference\nis, from where -- would I come from a very, very poor home, that we suffered, or from a\nhome that we never believed in religion, I would embrace Communism, because this\nwould be my dream. I came from a different world. So even in this time, this was the\nregime, but my aim in this regime was one -- my purpose was only one thing, to take\nrevenge. This was the only thing that I was happy with. But I wasn\u2019t happy with -- with --\nwith all the other doctrines from -- from this regime. You understand?",
        "Q: Yeah. So your feelings were quite -- more complicated then, when McCarthy started\nreally --",
        "A: Well, no, McCarthy, what I thought of him, I felt that this is a betrayal of America, he\n-- because the people were not guilty, and I think he was a traitor. And to me, if you will\nask me if I like mctar -- McCarthy more or less than Goebbels, I will say the same way.\nThe same, because would McCarthy be on Goebbels place, he wouldn\u2019t be better than\nGoebbels. I\u2019m not talking about Hitler, because he was -- nobody is above him, but\nGoebbels, I -- I would sing -- I would say that McCarthy and Goebbels were the same,\nbecause he was a man that he accused innocent people. I was very, very, very much hurt\nin this time.",
        "Q: Were you ever contacted, since you had a position in the Polish Intelligence, were you\never contacted in America, here, by officials, about [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, no, I -- no, no, I was only contacted when I escaped to Germany. When I escaped\n-- | worked for a cert time for the CIC, you know, they had the CIC in this time, not the\nCIA. And the CIC was a military Intelligence. The reason why I -- I could be of help,\nbecause I could find out from camps, when people were ga -- got their visas to come to\nAmerica, to find out from Poland, not from Jews, from pole -- because I masqueraded as\n-- well, then I didn\u2019t masquerade, but I could, to find out who was a collaborator, and\nwho was not worthy to enter America. So this I worked, I had a man from the CIC, that\nhe gave me directions, and I worked there.",

        "A: Well [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- different question, when was your daughter born? Do you [indecipherable]",
        "A: My daughter was born el -- 11 years after my marriage. 11 year -- my daughter was\nborn in 1956. In the beginning we didn\u2019t want to have children. But of course, we spoke,\nand we said no, we don\u2019t want to bring children to such a cruel world, because this was\n[indecipherable]. But later we figured, well, without children -- we wanted to defeat, to\nbe a victor over Hitler. Now, when we survived, so we were the victors. Even he killed\nsix million Jews, but I am alive. But then later, we decided, if we will not have children,\nHitler will win the war. So this way, we will have children, like we have now three\ngrandchildren. This means that we succeeded, and we defeated Hitler. So this was when\nwe wanted to have them, it took 11 years til we got our daughter.",
        "Q: Do you f -- h-how was your -- your parenting? Do you think that was affected by your\nexperience before, or -- and let me combine this with another question, what kind of\nvalues did you want to hand to your child?",
        "A: Well, our -- well, we wanted to have the highest values. My parenting was -- we did\nsomething very wrong, because we started to talk about the Holocaust too early. And this\npushed away my daughter, because we didn\u2019t have to start to speak about the Holocaust\nwhen she was three, four years old. Now, she always said, \u201cLook, all my friends have\ngrandfathers, I don\u2019t have grandfathers. All my friends has aunts,\u201d she doesn\u2019t have. But\nwe started to tell her stories about the Holocaust, and this was very bad, because we --\nthis was true, we -- we pushed her away from it. And the same thing with her grandchild -\n- with her children, when we started to tell stories about the Holocaust, my daughter says\nnot to tell her, they are too young. They cannot understand, and we shouldn\u2019t always --\nnow today, when I speak in schools, and I speak sometimes to first and second grade. As\na matter of fact, not long ago, I spoke of it to a kindergarten. Now, I don\u2019t tell them\ncruelties. I tell them there were bad people, and there were good people. Now, for\ninstance, the children -- I collected six million pennies, it was on television, and I tell\nthem -- and they collected pennies for -- for this Jewish Foundation for the Righteous.\nWe send money to non-Jews who help Jews. So I tell them we have to collect pennies,\nbecause there were bad people, who wanted to kill children. Those people saved the\nchildren. So I said, \u201cImagine if somebody would try to kill you, and there came some --\ncame a man, and they saved you. We have to remember that there were good people.\u201d\nBut I don\u2019t tell them stories, cruel stories. When chi -- when children are 14 - 15 - 16,\nthen I start to tell them. But long ago I spoke in a Catholic church --",
        "Q: Before we get in to that story, we should change the cassette.",

        "A: Now --",
        "Q: Yeah, we talked about --",
        "A: | -- I start to say, I was invited to a Catholic, Polish church, and the Polish church, it\nwas in Hackensack. And this name of the Polish is Koschumat Kobosscachins Tahoffsky.\nIt means the church of the mother -- Black Madonna of Chancetahoff. So when I came in,\nand the mother superior, they were Polish, and I thanked her, and I said I\u2019m glad to be --\nin Polish, I said, \u201cKoschulen mas -- matkabosska chanstahofsky.\u201d She said to me, \u201cYou\nknow, since the church is a church, nobody said it correct, you are the first one who said\nit correct.\u201d So then I asked her, \u201cWhat should I tell the people, should I tell them stories,\nthe real stories, or should I make it a little nicer?\u201d She said, \u201c\u2018No, tell them how it was.\u201d\nBecause I spoke -- I speak about Polish people worse than I speak about Germans, and I\nwill tell you the reason why. So when I spoke, and I told them stories about the Polish\npeople, so I thought, that\u2019s it, she will never invite me. About a month later, she calls me\nup, she said, \u201cYou know, we have a sister church in Jersey City. Would you come out\nthere to speak?\u201d So I thought it\u2019s not so bad. So -- now, the reason why I tell you what I s\n-- speak about Polish people more -- more against Polish people than the Germans.\nNobody did so much harm as the Germans, because after all, they created the Holocaust,\nthey did all the killings, they had all the ideas about extermination, about all those things.\nThe Polish people collaborated in a different way. Now, when a German went into the\nSS, or to Einsatzgruppen, or became a Gestapo man, or killed just for pleasure, he was\nraised with the idea since he was in Hitler yugen, and he knew that Jew was worse than\ngarbage, worse than a cockroach, that the Jew had to be eliminated. He was prepared for\nit. Even his parents sometimes didn\u2019t teach him, which the parents later taught him, too.\nBut he was taught in school. The Polish student was not taught to kill the Jews. The\ngovernment didn\u2019t give out directives to kill the Jews. It came from within. When it came\nto a Jew, they knew they had to hate them. So, for this reason, I have more -- not blame, I\nfeel worse when I speak about Polish anti-Semitism as hit -- as Germans. Because\nnothing is worse than the Germans, because they did that, the worst thing, but each\nindividual in Poland -- why did the Polish people have to collaborate with the Germans\nwhere he was under German occupation. The Germans killed see -- three million Poles.\nThe Poles were se -- garbage, second class citizen, undesirable, so -- so instead to have\ntwo people -- somebody said to me, your enemy\u2019s enemy is my best friend. Some -- if the\n-- 1-1f the -- if the Germans were Poles enemies, they should have -- have compassion\nwith the Jews, who had the same problem, but they didn\u2019t. So for this reason I feel --\nthere were Poles who helped, very few, small percentage. People ask me -- I go and\nspeak, they ask me, what percentage of Poles would kill a Jew -- I\u2019m not talking about\nGermans, I\u2019m talking about Poles, what percentage of Poles would kill a Jew, what\npercentage wouldn\u2019t kill, but wouldn\u2019t help, and what percentage would help? And I was\nthinking about it a long time. I came to the conclusion 75 percent of the Poles would kill\na Jew for no reason at all; giving out to the Germans, or kill them themselves. And don\u2019t\nforget, if a Pole gave out a Jew during the war, he got a kilo of sugar, or he -- he got a\nquart of kerosene. If he gave out five Jews, he got five kilo of sugar, imagine what a\nsweet life he had. 75 percent. 40 percent -- not 40 percent, 20 -- I said 23 percent -- 75\npercent would give out, 23 percent wouldn\u2019t give out, they wouldn\u2019t help. They would\nsay go away, I don\u2019t want to be involved, but they didn\u2019t give them out. We have nothing\nagainst those people; they didn\u2019t help us, but they didn\u2019t kill us. See, the pope was within\nthe 23 percent. See, I know the pope very well. I was with the pope together eight\nmonths. It\u2019s a different story. We were very, very good friends. He called me Taddek, I\ncalled him Lolek, cause Karol is the nickname Lolek. And I used to meet him two times a\nweek, and it\u2019s a different story, well. He, til today, he doesn\u2019t know that I am Jewish. He\nstill knows that I am a Pole, but this a story besides this. So 24 -- 23 percent wouldn\u2019t\ngive out: like the pope, he\u2019s not a murderer, but he didn\u2019t help. Two percent helped Jews.\nSo I read Ringenblume -- you know who Ringenblume --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right. He wrote, and he wrote about the same question, and he came out with the\nsame answer. He came out that 75 percent Poles will give out a Jew, or kill a Jew, but he\nsaid 24 percent wouldn\u2019t help, and wouldn\u2019t give out. Only one percent helped.",
        "Q: How did you figure that, though?",
        "A: Well, so let me answer you. One percent will give out -- will help. So I said, who is\nsmarter, I or Ringenblume? Naturally Ringenblume. A historian, a well known historian,\nand who am I? I am from a small town in Kolbushova. So I took my town as an example.\nWe were 2,000 Jews, 2,000 Poles. If I would be right, that two percent Poles saved Jews,\nso it means my townspeople had to save 40 Jews. Two percent from 2,000, right? They\ndidn\u2019t save 40 Jews. Now, Ringenblume will be right, one percent. So it means my town\nhad to save 20 Jews. Did they save 20 Jews? No. Did they save 10 Jews? No, not even a\nhalf a percent. But to give them -- to -- to how you say benefit of the doubt, I say\nRingenblume was right, one percent saved Jews. So this is why I say from where I came\nto this conclusion. I came with my town, and every town was the same. In a -- now, you\nwill ask -- you asked me this before, before it\u2019s finished I want to -- to -- now I will tell\nyou why I want to do it, and I'll do it fast. My mother, as a hobby, used to make sweaters,\nfor as -- she liked it. When there was not too much wool left, she made it very fast. And\nthey ask her, why you rushing? She said, \u201cI want to finish the sweater before I\u2019m out of\nwool.\u201d So the same thing, I want to finish it before we are out of time, we out of\n[indecipherable]. You ask me before about -- I told you that I sing a song, when I was\ninterviewed -- when I was a moderator for this history. And the person, Ray Farr, ask me,\n\u201cWhy is there anti-Semitism in Poland so strong, stronger than the other countries?\u201d So I\nsaid, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t answer you, but I will sing you a song, what I learned in school, a\nCatholic song, a church song.\u201d I re -- I remember this song, and the song has 12 stanzas. I\nwouldn\u2019t sing you -- for her I sing all the 12, for you I will only sing one. It\u2019s a beautiful\nsong, a beautiful melody, I learned it in school. And this song 1s that Jesus talks to his\npeople, to the Jews. And the song 1s -- [sings] Lo do may lo do. Sool zamchi woochi nue,\nchemyap secrotchill, Eacham zaveenue, yachem visbolue zmotza farra oana, atish\nsheshoenju, shish namare ramyoana. And this is the song. People, my people, what did I\ndo to you? With what did I trangress -- transgress against you? I took you out from the\nbondage of p -- pharaoh, from Egypt. And what did you do to me? You put me ona\ncross. The second is people, my people, what did I do to you? I brought you in in a land\nwith milk and honey. What did you do to me? You crucified me. The third one: people\nmy people, what did I do to you? I elevated you among all other nations, and you\nelevated me on a cross. And so on and so on. Now, when we learned this song in school,\nand if a Polish boy learned this song, and he goes out, and he see a Jew with a beard, he\ngoes to him, and he pulls his beard, kicks him, beats him, beats him, why? Cause they\ntaught him -- what did they tell him\u2019? The Jews killed Jesus, which is not true. And this is\nwhat I told her, from there is the anti-Semitism. And I tell you a other story. Catholics --\nthis is a story about the Puerto Rican. I had a house in Hoboken, and there were Puerto\nRicans living there. The -- the janitor was a Puerto Rican. And once I came in, he had a\nboy about 10 years. He wa -- started to speak. So he ask me, \u201cHey, Mr. Norman, you\nPolacko, you Polacko?\u201d Because they called me Polacko. I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a Polacko,\nI\u2019m a Hoodeo.\u201d I\u2019m a Jew. So the boy asked the father, and I understood what I\nunderstand, \u201cWhat is a Jew?\u201d And the father gives him a whole lesson. And I could hear\nhe gives him a lesson, Jesus, and Jesus, and Jesus, and Jesus. He told him a story about\nJesus. And after he finished the stories -- the story, the boy goes and pulls my sleeve, and\nhe says, \u201cHey, Mr. Norman, why did you kill Jesus?\u201d Because the father told him a story.\nSo he asked me why did I kill -- why I killed Jesus. So those are the stories about anti-\nSemitism. When I was a peddler, I came in, and always my customers lived on the fifth\nfloor, they never lived on the second -- on the first floor, because I had to go up, no\nelevator. So I ask him why somebody should live on the first floor. And I dragged my\nsuitcases on the fifth floor. So I come in once, and the door was open, there was a young\nwoman, she was born in America, she must be about 26 years. And the door was open,\nand I hear that she yells -- the child was crying, and she yells to the child, \u201cBe quiet,\nbecause the Jew will come with the sack, and he will take you away.\u201d This happened in\nJersey City. And then she turns around, she sees me. She was a little embarrassed. I asked\nher, \u201cTell me, why did you tell the stig -- th-the girl that the Jew will come with the sack\nand take you away\u201d? Did you ever see a Jew comes with a sack and takes away a child?\u201d\nShe says, \u201cWhy, I don\u2019t know, but my mother always used to tell it to me, and I was\nalways so afraid I stopped crying.\u201d The mother told it to her, she telled it to the child, and\nthe child will probably tell 1t to her child. And this is from where the hate, the anti-\nSemitism comes. Cause children are not born bad.",

So the children learn.\nIndell and I go out and speak, and they have it a -- but in general, I don\u2019t think so. In\ngeneral, I think that the people say -- well, what do I have to go to strangers, when you\nhave a man on my board meeting for B\u2019nai Brith, and he started to yell, \u201cStop with this\ncrap about the Holocaust. Stop, don\u2019t bother me with this Holocaust.\u201d He\u2019s a Jew. His\nparents came from Europe, they were saved His children are, and his grandchildren -- I\nsaid, I don\u2019t think so. I think maybe -- maybe, if somebody has a interest, there are more\nbooks. But also they -- they -- you know that in the Holocaust museum last year, 80\npercent of visitors were non-Jews. Because the Jew probably figures, well, I know it\nalready. The -- the young people, I know it already. For the non-Jews, it\u2019s a novelty.\nThey want to go in to see it. But the Jew knows it already. So every time I think it will\nget weaker, and weaker. We are farther, farther away. Take for instance the Inquisition.\nYou know the story about the Inquisition., huh? How many people speak about the\nInquisition? And the Inquisition was a terrible thing. How many people speak about the\nCrusaders? Do you know that in Crusaders, 400 Jewish towns were destroyed? 400. And\nthis time in Poland, in Poland were 400,000 Jews. During the time of the Crusaders, from\nthe 400,000, 200,000 Jews were killed. Nobody knows. 50 percent. Nobody knows about\nit.",
        "Q: D-Do you think though that sort of movies, like the cam -- the NBC movie\n\u201cHolocaust,\u201d that came out in \u201978, and other films are shaping a certain understanding, or\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes. Take, for instance, \u201c\u201cSchindler\u2019s List.\u2019\u2019 So because this was last one.

For me, it didn\u2019t even scratch the surface. It\nshowed a lot of things, but what we went through, it didn\u2019t show you w -- that -- th-the\nreal misery. But for the American, it showed enough. One thing I liked about\n\u201c\u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d and the Polish people don\u2019t like it, is there is one scene when the Jews\nwere taken to the Krakow ghetto, and when they were chased away, and they were killed,\nand isn\u2019t it -- there was a Polish girl staying there, a blond girl, and she said, \u201cGoodbye\nJews, goodbye Jews.\u201d It is typical, but the Polish people didn\u2019t like it. Then a other thing\nthey didn\u2019t like that in Auschwitz, a lot of kapos spoke Polish; they were Polish girl.\nBecause if a Polish girl was taken to Auschwitz, she got a good job. For instance, from\nmy town, there is a girl Zoshka Vinyarska Esertanay. She was in Auschwitz, and she was\nin Auschwitz not for being a Jew, she was in au -- because she was caught with black\nmarket -- black market stuff. And she was taken to Auschwitz, she became a kapo. And\nshe became such a --a -- at -- a -- a true -- for the Germans, that when she used to take\nchildren when there was an extermination job, a selection of the children, she had to take\nthe children to the gas chambers. But there were always open pits with fire, because the\ngas chamber -- the -- the crematoritums couldn\u2019t burn enough. So she used to take the\nchildren, and throw them in in the fire, alive. Now this girl came from a town from where\nI was born. After the war, so long I was in Poland, she was hiding, because she -- I find\nout about it -- she knew that if I will get her, I will kill her. She didn\u2019t know nuf -- now\nshe lives in -- in our town, openly, people know about it. Nothing happened to her. She\nused to take live children and throw them in -- in the fire.

        "Q: Did you meet any survivors from -- that you knew from -- from -- from the war, or\nfrom even before in -- in America?",
        "A: Oh sure, we have organization. I am very active in the organization. We have\norganization of the Holocaust federation. I am a national executive board member, and\nwe have -- and I am very, very much involved. As a matter of fact, that every year, we\nmake, at Yom HaShoah the year, and we -- and we -- and I am doing this for 30 years.\nAnd before we used to have it in Madison Square Garden, and for the last five years we\nhave it in Temple Emmanuel. And I am in charge of the arrangement and security. Before\nthis it takes about six months to arrange it. I am with the police, with the fire department,\nwith tran -- trans -- the transit, and ever -- and a -- we have meetings, and I -- and during\nthe day I am there with the police, I arrange the security, because with the parking and\neverything. I am very much involved. We had in our organization, we had 85,000\nmembers. Now, we -- th-three years ago, we lost about seven percent, two years ago we\nlost 10 percent, and this year so far, we lost already 15 percent, because people are dying\nout, you know. But I am very much involved in it.",
        "Q: I was -- I was thinking about maybe you could name one person from your earlier life,\nthat you met again here. I think you mentioned you brought a gir -- a girl runner, who\nwas arunner in Poland, did you bring her to New York? In the videotape? I thought you\nmentioned that.",
        "A: No, I bought not a runner, I bought -- I bought a Polish girl.",
        "Q: A Polish girl.",
        "A: But she was a runner between two --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- two Polish organizations, and she saved my life a few times. But here, I-I could give\nyou a list of 200 people, so -- so that -- that I knew, that I met them here, and they live\nhere, but now a lot of them dying out. A -- from -- from my group, unfortunately, they are\nnot alive, but -- but from other camps, and -- we always -- in -- in -- in -- like for instance\nnow, we had, for a week we had the lectures in Rutgers, I think I told you this. Now, I -- I\nwas lecturing there, and all of them who wu -- came to listen, were mostly a lot of\nSUIVIVOTS.",
        "Q: And what -- in your opinion, what are the lessons of the Holocaust, and has the world\nlearned them?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so the world learned anything, cause if the world will learn the\nHolocaust, you wouldn\u2019t have Rwanda, you wouldn\u2019t have an -- you wouldn\u2019t have -- not\nKosovo, and oh, what is the other place?",
        "Q: Bosnia?",
        "A: No, no, no, we\u2019ll talk about Bosnia, and -- near Cambodia. [clock chiming] You see,\nyou wouldn\u2019t -- you wouldn\u2019t have those things, because there are -- see, Bosnia, and ka -\n- and -- and -- and -- and -- and Kosovo, it\u2019s a different subject. It\u2019s all [indecipherable] I\ndon\u2019t think so that Bosnia and Kosovo, that -- that -- that Clinton in America is hundred\npercent right, because I think they did a very, very bad thing, because of Milosevich is\nnot an angel. He 1s a strong man, but -- but he\u2019s -- what he is doing doesn\u2019t mean that\nAmerica has a right to go and bomb, and kill Kosovian civilians, Serb civilians, he\ndoesn\u2019t help the situation, and what does he do? He wants to show that this big America,\nthe rich America is stronger than the poor Serb? So what\u2019s a Serbian, nothing. A very\npoor country. So they want to show that whole European countries, they going to be\nstronger. They da -- sh -- they should be made pe -- but there were o-other ways, but not\nto go and kill, and destroy bridges, destroy their economy, destroy every -- because\nMilosevich, supposedly, is not a nice fellow. There are other people, there were ways to\ndo it. You had -- but not to go and bomb innocent people and to kill them. So what did\nthey do? They killed them. They destroyed everything. So ame -- why? Because Clinton\nwanted to get out as a hero, from being his presidency to cover up Monica\u2019s sins? This is\nnot the right thing to do.",
        "Q: So how do you feel about American involvement then, in those kind of --",
        "A: They s -- no, the American involvement is -- in Kosovo was very bad, because why\ndidn\u2019t America get involved in Rwanda? Now, in Kosovo, it was not the Serb\u2019s guilt. The\nKosovian, they wanted to start a rebellion, and to unite with Albania. They wanted to\nhave a large Albania, a large Muslim nation. Then later they would take care on -- on\nSerbia. One thing I can tell you, that the Serbs were the nicest people in the Holocaust.\nThe only one who saved Jews, the only one who took in and there -- Keeto took in in his\nga -- in his underground Jew -- any Jew who wanted to go in. The next in -- in command\nwas a Jewish general, Pattie, I think was his name. He was a Jew. In the Polish\nunderground you didn\u2019t accept a Jew. So the Serbs were ver -- and they were very good\nsoldiers. Germany had 10 divisions SS. In Serbia they couldn\u2019t do anything, because they\nare very patriotic. So now, America wants to show they are stronger than Serbia. Well,\nhow -- to take the American army, the air force, and to destroy Serbia? For what?\nBecause the alb -- the -- the -- the Albanese, they had in their constitution, they had, not\nin constitu -- in their rules, they had that every mon -- every week, they have to kill three\nSerbian policemen. Every week they kill a -- so they started it, they wanted to have a\nindependence. They ha -- had the underground against Serbia. So what should Serbia\nsay? Wait -- I will sit and wait til they kill us? So howa -- Serbia an-answered. And I\ndon\u2019t say that Milosevich was an angel, but the Serbian people didn\u2019t deserve it. And\nwhat did they do? Not only the Serbian, they killed the Kosovian, too, because they\nbombed kos -- Kosovo. They bombed -- they destroyed everything what they had, the\npeople with the electricity, and bridges, and everything. So I think that you cannot\ncompare it with -- with any other. Ha -- why don\u2019t America go to Tibet, and help them?\nWhy do they -- don\u2019t they go to the Kurds? There are 22 million Kurds, and they -- wh-\nwhat they are doing? America doesn\u2019t go to help them. And they have a right to do\nsomething, because they are on their land. Kosovo was never a nation. For 800 years it\nwas under Serbia. Besides, Serbia, all their religious and national things are in Kosovo.\nThe same thing as Jerusalem is for the Jews, Kosovo is for the Serbs. Now, they will go -\n- Clinton will s -- next week he will go the Jews and will say, give away Jerusalem and\neverything, if not, we going to bomb you. This is very wrong. I wrote to them, I didn\u2019t\nget an answer. So we -- so we finished already the Kosovian business.",
        "Q: Almost. I want to get somehow back to your daughter, actually, but I think we\u2019ll make\nthat another tape.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: This is the end of tape four, side B, interview with Norman Salsitz.",

        "A: Oh, you have -- so far you have somebody talk so much, five?",
        "Q: Well, if somebody is interesting enough, we\u2019ll do that. So this was not the end, this is\nthe end now of tape four, side B.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nNorman Salsitz. This is tape number five, side A. I would like to know whether you can\npinpoint, at least to some degree, the time when you felt comfortable with your identity\nas an American. And what did that mean to you?",
        "A: Well, I think that I felt right away very glad that I\u2019m in America, the minute I came.\nNaturally, in the beginning, I was very unhappy. I was glad that I\u2019m in America, but I\nwas very unhappy, and as a matter of fact, the first year, probably, I went around with ma\n-- in my mind to commit suicide, for a few reasons. The first thing, I looked around, and I\ndidn\u2019t have my family. And I expected to have a family here, a new family, but I didn\u2019t\nhave it. And then, it is very -- I know people who had this experience, maybe they will\nunderstand; you know, it is like you are on a very, big, beautiful horse, and you fall down\nfrom the horse. I was already in Poland, after the war, I have a high position, I had -- I\nwas established, I -- I ruled -- not ruled, but I -- I could do a lot of things, and people\nrespected me, and here I came over, and I was nothing. In America, later I find out, you\ncould be smart, you could be intelligent, you could do -- be a lot of things, but if you\ndidn\u2019t have money, you have -- you are nothing. And I didn\u2019t have money, and these\nthings that -- what I did in Poland, and what I was in Poland, meant nothing There were a\nlot of people who, they were thankful, I did a lot of things for them in Poland, but when I\ncame here, everything disappeared. So, of course it was such a vacuum. I came down\nfrom -- from a high position, to nothing, and I was very disappointed. And I didn\u2019t know\nwhat will be the future, what I will do. Like I mentioned before, I didn\u2019t have a trade, I\ndidn\u2019t have money, and I didn\u2019t know what to do. So I was very -- then -- then the -- the -\n- the story with Israel this appears, that I didn\u2019t go to Israel, which I wanted. And -- so I\nask my -- question myself, I said, so what\u2019s now? So a lot of times I went around with\nideas that I probably -- the best thing 1s that I should commit suicide, and the thing 1s a lot\nof times when I went in the car, and I start to think it will better when I wouldn\u2019t come\nhome alive. It\u2019s very sad that I was thinking about it then, but this -- this was the reality.",
        "Q: But what did it mean to you to be an American at one point? Or was it not very sp-\nspectacular [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, in the beginning, it was nothing -- like I said, I was glad that I\u2019m here, because\nthis was a dream that we have. But I was not so happy, because I was not in Israel. So\nthis was -- see if you a dream only to be in America, and you are in America, so it\u2019s\ndifferent. But I was here, and -- and I have plans to go with this group, I have plans to go\nwith this group, and I couldn\u2019t go, one didn\u2019t realize, and the -- with the group I couldn\u2019t\ngo, then my wife was against me going in this time when it wa -- so, it -- 1t was not this\nwhat -- what I planned. So I was in America. See, if 1n America in this time, if I would\nhave somebody from the family, and they would take me in, it was not so much as the --\nthe -- the material things that they would -- I didn\u2019t ask for them, but to be in America,\nand to have a large family, to have cousins, and to be far away from them, I didn\u2019t feel\nthe warmth, and -- and this was more important, like I thought we will have -- we will\nhave friends. And who were the friends? The friends will be my cousins who were my\nage. And -- and I was a stranger to them. So this meant a very -- it was very painful.",
        "Q: Which -- which events in this country had a particular impact on you? Give me just\nsort of like one or two examples.",
        "A: Well, events that -- I would say the first events was very important, they impact when\nthey -- when I was in -- outside of the United Nation when they voted for accepting the\npetition of Palestine in this time. W -- I was there, an -- and after they voted, and it was f\n-- by very small vote that they won, and naturally outside the people started to sing, and\nto dance. So I think this was one of the most -- well, the first -- the first thing was with\nthe -- which -- arriving in -- and to wait to see the Statue of -- of Liberty. This was the --\nthe -- the very -- very emotional. And the second thing was when Israel became a nation.\nThis -- when I saw that the abba eben pulls up the Israel [indecipherable]. And I was\nthere, so this meant a awful lot, because this was a dream which lasted 2,000 years. I only\nfelt sorry that my father and my sisters are not alive to -- to live, and to see it. But this\nwas one of the -- of the most important things in -- in America. Well, then later there\nwere other things, naturally when my daughter was born. So this was one of the -- the mo\n-- because we waited a long time, and when she was born, so this was a very, very\nemotional thing.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit more about your daughter then, because we never quite continued\ntalking about her. You said earlier that you pushed her away a little bit, unintentionally,\nby talking too early, but tell me a little bit more. What did that mean? How did she react,\nand how did you come together again?",
        "A: I-I didn\u2019t push her away, but I talked too much about the Holocaust, and she was too\nyoung, and a -- she was not ready for it. So then later, when --",
        "Q: But how did she respond to it? What was the response?",
        "A: She was not interested. She was not interested when I spoke, it\u2019s like I saw some\nchildren where they are a little older, that everything th -- they -- they talk about the\nmisery, and the bad times the parents went through, and -- and she -- she didn\u2019t react like\nthis. Later she explained it\u2019s because I started to talk about the Holocaust too much, too\nearly, and she didn\u2019t care for it. But then later, as she got older, so she started -- she\nrealized now -- she\u2019s still not very what -- what I would say very involved. Like for\ninstance, I have a lot of friends, and their children -- there is a movement of second\ngeneration, and she doesn\u2019t belong to second generation. I ask her a few times. And -- by\nthe way, her husband, who is a fifth generation American, he\u2019s more -- more involved --\nnot involved, but he\u2019s more for the remembrance of the Holocaust than -- than she 1s.",
        "Q: Does that hurt you?",
        "A: No -- not that it hur -- yes, it hurts me one thing, because she doesn\u2019t remember so\nmuch -- my sisters -- an-and it hurts me because we depend on the second generation, on\nthe future generation, that the Holocaust shouldn\u2019t be forgotten. And if she is not very\nmuch involved, so it means that it will not be remembered so much. And after all, she\nfeels very bad that she didn\u2019t -- that she always cried, she didn\u2019t have a grandfather, a\ngrandmother. Like for instance, she had here a friend, she had two sets of grandmothers,\nso she always has questioned them, when they knew about it, so one set of grandfather\n[indecipherable] they adopted her. So I would like she should be more involved, because\nwe are so -- Iam so much involved, not so much my wife. I involved because I belong to\nevery organization -- Holocaust organization, and everything what has to be done, I\u2019m\nvery much involved. I\u2019m involved with the -- with the -- the money part, I\u2019m involved\nwith speaking, to go -- meetings, and all those things, I am involved.",
        "Q: I -- I -- I would like -- I would follow up in just a -- to another question about your\nwork, and we\u2019ll talk more about this, but let me just stick with your daughter. What is her\n-- give me h-her name, and what did -- was her education? She is a law -- she\u2019s a lawyer?",
        "A: She -- her name is Esther, her -- Esther Sylvia. Esther she is made -- named after my\nmother, and Sylvia after my wife\u2019s sister, who was killed when she was 17 years. And\nher maiden name is -- I mean marriage name is Dezube, D-e-z-u-b-e. Some people don\u2019t\nrealize, they think it\u2019s not a Jewish name, that it is a Italian name, but I mentioned that\nher -- her husband\u2019s is the fifth generation American, and -- and it used to be Dezubinsky,\nwhich is a Russian name for a dentist, something. But then later this was changed. And\nshe\u2019s a lawyer. She has her own office, and she employs a other lawyer, with a secretary,\nand she -- she\u2019s satisfied with her -- we wanted she should be a doctor, b-because my wa\n-- my wife was it, but she didn\u2019t like it, she didn\u2019t want, she wanted to be a lawyer. And\nshe always was very good with the debating, and talking. And as a matter of fact, when\nshe was in college, sh -- the lawyer, or the -- the -- the professor [indecipherable] said,\n\u201cYou should be a lawyer.\u201d Well she -- she -- maybe this -- she has a little bit from me, I\ndon\u2019t know. And [indecipherable] she married the husband, he 1s a medical doctor. He is\nnow assistant professor in Harvard, and he is in Beth Israel Hospital, and he is the head --\nhe is oncologist hematologist, and now he\u2019s the head -- he started to work with AIDS\nresearch, and he goes around all over the world, and they send him to have lectures. As a\nmatter of fact, he just came back from -- he was in Japan, he was in Hungary, he was --\nhe goes over -- and they have to go now, in about a month, they have to go to Portugal.\nAnd he\u2019s also now a member of the Food and Drug industry; he goes once a month to\nWashington, because when they have a new drug, that has to be approved. So he is very\ndedicated to it, and in the beginning we were a little worried that he picked out the AIDS,\nbut he wants it because h-he\u2019s a idealist. He\u2019s -- he\u2019s very much involved in it. And we --\nthe beginning we were wor -- worried a little because we thought that doctors, contagious\nthis, but now it\u2019s -- it changed a lot. An-And -- and he -- he\u2019s happy, and he likes it, and -\n- and now -- we want he should be for -- he shouldn\u2019t be in that hospital, because if he\nwill be a private doctor, he could make much more money. But he doesn\u2019t care about the\nmoney. So --",
        "Q: You also have grandchildren. When --",
        "A: Yeah, I have three -- three grandchildren. And this was also one of the highlights of\nour life. When the first one was born, he was born in -- about three years after she was\nmarried. She was married -- my daughter was married in -- in -- it was just 22\"\nanniversary for her. So her d -- Dustin is now 16 and a half years old. He 1s the oldest\none. Then she has one, he is Arlen. Arlen is 11 years old. And then she has one, he is\nMichael. And Michael is -- is nine years old, yeah.",
        "Q: Is -- is their observant house, or 1s it --",
        "A: Well, you see, we -- our -- for instance by us, everything what is tradition, I keep up.\nIt\u2019s not observant. We don\u2019t have kosher, and we don\u2019t do serf shab -- the Shema\nShabbas as we call it. But w -- it\u2019s more like -- like everything traditional, every national\nholiday, and -- so -- well a -- so -- but se -- m-my wife, she doesn\u2019t come from such a\nhome. She comes from a home that -- see, in Europe, everybody was -- was religious.",
        "Q: Shall we [indecipherable] for a second?",
        "A: N -- Ino --",
        "Q: All right, is 1t [indecipherable]",
        "A: So, w -- everything what is traditional, I w -- as you can see upstairs -- you didn\u2019t see\nit, Ihave like an Jewish museum. Everything what has a Jewish character I buy, and I like\nto collect. And I have certain things that they are so unique, that it\u2019s probably the one in\nthe world. And if you are interested, I can explain to you, I can show it to you. And so, if\nI have guests, like for instance Saturdays we don\u2019t make the observance like it should be,\nbut if I have guests for this, I do it. See, I know how to do it, [indecipherable] because\nlike I said, til 17 years I started, and I don\u2019t know if you'll say to be a rabbi, or to what,\nbut I -- we were very, very in-involved in it. So -- but now, after the war, n -- everything\nwhat has to do with the connection, with -- with the -- with the God, we let it go a little\nbit, because we each were asking a question, and we don\u2019t have answers. My daughter for\ninstance -- and my daughter is more observant than we are. And -- like for instance, every\nFriday night, and -- she lights the candles, and her children come, and everyone has to\nwear a kippah, and then they say the blessings, and they sing what they have to do. Also\nbecause they go to Solomon Shechter, which is a religious Jew telly school, and they go\npartly to Solomon Shechter, because I pay for it. And I said to them if they will go to\nSolomon Shechter, I would pay, and this is quite expensive, because -- because it cost\nalmost 10,000 dollars a year for each one. Now, her husband, for instance, comes from a\nhouse that they didn\u2019t know too much about Judaism. Now, her husband\u2019s parents, like\nfor instance his father\u2019s siblings, they all married por -- Protestants. His mother\u2019s ma --\nfamily married Catholics. So -- but none of them married Jews -- well, one maybe\nmarried Jews. So her husband, because he was afraid that with them the Jewish tradition,\neverything would get lost, so he became more Jewish. And he did it himself, he asked for\nit, and as a matter of fact, in his sophomore year he went to Israel, and he went for a year\nto Israel, but he didn\u2019t go on the English faculty -- English part, but the Hebrew. And he\nspeaks perfect Hebrew. He ri -- and he gets all the Hebrew newspapers, and he\u2019s very\nmuch involved with Israel. The oldest son, til he was three years, he spoke to him only\nHebrew, because he -- he thought English he would learn anyway. So they are very much\n-- they belong to a temple, and with the children they go to temple. Now, for instance, the\nIsraeli government sends over certain people, and -- for a year to be on Harvard, or in\nMIT. So there are certain families that they adopt a family for a year, so they adopt every\nyear a family. And they stay with them Saturdays, holidays, because it\u2019s ver -- and they\nwere a few times, like for instance the oldest boy went yesterday to Israel, and he\u2019s 16\nand a half, and there is a group. It\u2019s called gesh -- Geshert. So they -- it\u2019s -- it 1s like they\nare part with the milit -- military part. They go there for six weeks, and then they travel.\nSo he went with the group, they went about 150 American -- 50 were boys, hundred were\ngirls, and their age, and they went there, which we agree to what they should go. And it 1s\nvery important.",
        "Q: Just a few minutes ago, you mentioned your -- one -- one part of your many\ncollections, so I would like to talk a little bit more about your recent activities. There are\na -- a lot of them, but maybe you can give us a sort of a sampling, a brief --",
        "A: Well, I --",
        "Q: -- you have written books, you give talks.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I -- the activities, like for instance, I organized, 30 years ago, a chapter here\nfrom Mogandube tadome, Mogandube tadome, as they say the Red Cross, and fo-for 30\nyears I\u2019m the president. I\u2019m trying to give it to somebody, there is nobody who will --\ntakes it. And we are a member from the national, and we went a few times with them to\nIsrael, and now it starts to go down, like all Jewish organizations, and the new people\ndon\u2019t go in, and old people dying out, and I say that my members -- I used to have a few\nhundred members in this chapter, now I have very little, so I said all the members, or they\ngo up, or they go down. So they said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said, \u201cOh, they go down to\nFlorida, or they go up to heaven.\u201d And this is mostly what -- what happened, the new\npeople doesn\u2019t come in. Also, I organized Gimmilis hassoudim organization, it m -- 1s a\nfree loan society. This was after I came to America, so I started to organize with the --\nwith the people here, and we took a -- collected money, we send it to Israel. And in this\ntime the people were very poor, and everybody had a chance to loan -- to take a loan,\nthen they paid it out in a year, and two years, and they got back. So this 1s still there -- al -\n- existing. My -- this was the [indecipherable] that mis -- the people from my town have\nit. So then I belong to a lot of organization, like I organized in our temple a Israel bond\ndrive, and the -- the UGA drive. I was, for about seven years, the chairman of Israel\nbonds for Essex county religious council, and -- and I -- I always was involved in -- in --\nin -- in all kind of -- of charitable organizations.",
        "Q: Wh-When did you start giving talks in schools, or public talks, and what -- what --\nwhere have you been? Just to schools, and -- or other areas?",
        "A: No, no. I -- I -- well, people started to know about me, so one from the others, and I\nwill say in the last 10 years. So I go public schools, high schools, and sometimes not\nJewish high schools. And I also spoke right in Princeton. They invited me, I spoke in\nHarvard. And I spoke in -- in -- in Connecticut they have Notre Dame University. And\nthis was very important for me, because they were not Jews there. And -- and there is\neven it\u2019s not a anecdote, 1s when I came to Notre Dame, they invited me there for a day,\nbut they kept me there for three days, because when the -- this is a Jesuit school, and they\nare dressed like priests. So when they introduced me to the headmaster, and he had a\nbook under his arm, that he had the book, so he had the book, the \u201cJewish Boyhood in\nPoland,\u201d my book. So I was very pleased, I said, \u201cOh, you got the book because I came to\nspeak here?\u201d He said, \u201cNo.\u201d So I said, \u201cDo you know whose book this is?\u201d He said,\n\u201cNo.\u201d \u201cSo how comes you have the book?\u201d He said to me, \u201cI just came from\nWashington, from the museum, and I saw this book, and I saw that the book is, \u201cA\nJewish Boyhood in Poland, Remembering Kolbushova,\u201d my town. So happens that my\ngrandfather came from Kolbushova.\u201d So he brought the book. So he told me his name, I\nremem -- so I remember his grandfather, and he -- his father came to America, he was\nborn here, and he is the head of the Notre Dame University. So instead one day, he kept\nme there three days. And -- and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Y-You ju -- you just mentioned one book, you -- earlier, throughout the -- this\ninterview, you had mentioned -- you di -- never said the title, but you always referred\nback to a book. What is the other book called?",
        "A: Well, the first book -- the first book, 1t was printed in 1961, and this was printed in\nIsrael, and this book in -- in the English, it is a memorial book for my town. And 1n the --\nin -- all it\u2019s -- in Yiddish it\u2019s called, \u201cKolbushova Pinkus.\u201d Pinkus is memor -- a\nmemorial book. And it\u2019s a very good book, it\u2019s one of the -- because every town gave out\n-- called the yeeska book, a memorial book. And this is one of the best, because it has\n1400 pages, and it has about a few hundred ph-photos. So it\u2019s a very good book, specially\nfor the people from my town, they didn\u2019t have the pictures. So this was in the -- in 61.\nAnd then now, people a lot, children, they want to have the book, but it\u2019s not available.\nThe only time I got the book is when somebody dies, and the children don\u2019t know\nYiddish, so I buy back from them, and I could give it to them. This 1s the first one, then I\nhad a lot of articles and papers, that two, three, four times a year 1n the -- in the \u201cJewish\nNews,\u201d and there are some good articles. Like, for instance, last year I had an article, and\nit was reprint -- reprinted in 25 different papers, because it goes from one, they take it.\nAnd then later I -- I got copies from the other papers. It was from California, from\nFlorida. Now I even got a copy from a paper from London, that they got a -- a -- reprinted\nthis article from -- in London, and somebody send it to me. And then came out a book,\n\u201cAgainst All Odds,\u201d which 1s -- was very successful, and then after against all is, \u201cA\nJewish Boyhood in Poland, Remembering Kolbushova.\u201d This is my youth in Kolbushova.\nAnd now, two other books will come out this year, which I told you one is being written\nby Amy Hill Hart. This is the author of, \u201cHaving Our Say,\u201d which became very popular,\nand it was a show on television, and it selled over two million copies, and --",
        "Q: That book 1s about your life?",
        "A: This -- no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: The book from Amy Hill Hart? No. This is -- because she\u2019s the daughter of German\nimmigrants, and this -- because she wrote this book aga -- \u201cHaving Our Say.\u201d This 1s\nabout a minority, about Negroes, children of slaves. So she wanted to write aga-again a\nbook about minorities, and because it was such a successful. And she wrote in -- 1n -- 1n\npapers, and in -- in Associated Press, about me, about when I collected the six million\npennies. And she wrote it, so she got in touch with us, and she said she would like to\nwrite a book about us, about our life during the Holocaust, from the -- so we told her we\nhave already two books. She said no, she wants to write it from the viewpoint of a\nGerman. So this was -- for this we were interested, because we wanted to see how she\nwill -- she will handle, how she will approach. So she had interviews, and we sent -- she\nwas even to Israel, and she went to Yad Vashem, she went to the museum to see all those\nthings, because she didn\u2019t know too much about the Holocaust, and we arranged\ninterviews with the director, and with the director from ADL, from -- with Mr. Foxman,\nwith Elie Wiesel, with others, and so she -- she just finished the book, we don\u2019t agree\nwith everything. Not that we don\u2019t agree, she let out and she had -- but she said this is the\nfirst draft, probably there will be a few drafts. And she wants to have -- because she can\nhave publishers where she\u2019s now known, because her book was such a success. It was a\nshow on -- in -- in Broadway, and then it was on television, on channel two, and it was\nsold over two million pa -- copies. It was for six months the best seller on New York\nTime list. So -- so we are preparing this book, and then I prepare this book what I told\nyou, with the vignettes, which I\u2019m very much interested in the vignettes, because this 1s\nstories that didn\u2019t go in in the first book, in the second book, in the third book. Those are\nstories that I don\u2019t want to let them out. Stories from before the war, stories from the war,\nfrom cruelties, from -- so I have this, and I have the title, so we worked this. And then\nlater, when I wa -- finished those two books, which I think it will be this year, so then\nlater we'll think about something else.",
        "Q: Well, two -- two -- two follow up questions. One is, what -- how do you evaluate the\nimpact that survivor testimonies and recollections like yours have had on the collective\nHolocaust memory in this country, 1f you will?",
        "A: I think this is very important, because the survivors co -- testimonies is more\nimportant than even reading a book. Because, you see like for instance, I was not long\nago I was in the -- to speak in a -- in -- in a school, and there was -- it wasn\u2019t -- there were\nnot Jewish students, there were mostly Christians. So the -- who -- with they -- the\nteacher, when they introduce, they said, \u201cYou -- we -- I want we should see this man,\nbecause in a few years, you'll be able to say, I saw a survivor, because then there will not\nbe survivors. So you saw the survivor, and you heard it from a survivor.\u201d So this is very\nimportant when you go to schools, and then -- when you did -- it\u2019s also depends how you\ntell the story. Now, when I go -- so I ask always how old the children are, if they are --\nwhat nationality they are, wh-what a -- what ethnic background. It\u2019s very important\nbecause you have to tell them stor -- different stories. Now in -- how old, and how many -\n- and I never prepare a speech. When I prepare a speech, it\u2019s a fiasco. I have to come and\nlook at the faces, and then I speak. As you can see, I cannot -- I cannot read a speech.\nNow, not long ago I was in Elizabeth, and this was three high schools put together, and\nthere were about -- I would say about 250 students, not one White, all of them Black.\nAnd it was a different experience. And I told them, and naturally I compared the\nHolocaust with -- with the life of the Black people in America. Se -- so you have to cater\nto each one different. So for this reason I ask what nationality, what -- not so much\nnationality, what religion and -- and age, and it\u2019s so you --",
        "Q: D-Do you -- do you find the students in schools very open and interested?",
        "A: Yes, they are very interested. It\u2019s also depends how you tell the story, because I went\nto some -- to some -- somebody spoke, and because we were two, and when the other\nperson spoke, so the teach -- the students were talking to each other, they didn\u2019t have no\ninterest, because -- I didn\u2019t blame them, because the way the person talked, it was very\nmonotonous, and -- and then later when I spoke, they had a different interest. I was in a\nschool, and they had about 400 children, so then the principal came to me, he said, \u201cI can\ntell you only one thing. This is the first time that they were sitting for two hours, and they\nlistened. And they -- I could never keep them for so long, and they should have a\ninterest.\u201d Again, I see what the children -- what interest it is. Now, if you go, and you see\nla -- when I speak to a Jewish group, and when the Jewish group is let\u2019s say between 16\nand seven -- 15 and 17 years, I don\u2019t tell them stories about the death camps. They have\nno interest about the death camps. They want to know what did the Jews do. How did\nthey protect themselves. So then I tell them stories about my activity in the underground,\nin the woods. This what they want to know. They want to know if I did something, if I\nkilled somebody, if I -- this -- this what they into, they\u2019re not interested in Auschwitz.\nThey are not interested se -- in the -- 1n the ovens, and the cruelty, what the Germans did.\nThis is ha -- no. They -- the same thing in Israel, and I spoke in Israel, the children are\ninterested what did the Jew do. And if you tell them a story from a underground, from a\nresistance, from this, this what they associate, and this what they like to hear. So for this\nreason you have to fa -- you have to face the people, and to see what they have -- what\ninterest they have.",
        "Q: Do you think that in -- in general, even when you came to -- to America, was there a\nlittle bit more appreciation of -- of the resistance fighters? Of people who had done\nsomething because just -- you just bring -- bring that up as something that\u2019s of\nimportance.",
        "A: Yes, yes, there was, but nobody knew about it. There was, like for instance, they were\nvery -- with everybody, like now you -- when you speak about the resistance, you speak\nabout the Warsaw ghetto. Now, there were a lot of resistance story, but the Warsaw\nghetto, this is the emblem, this is the -- the -- the main thing that -- that you talk about\nresistance. It was important, because this was the first resistance in Europe against the\nGermans. And also, the resistance was in Warsaw -- the resistance was in Warsaw, where\nthey didn\u2019t have no help. It --",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, I have to interrupt. We have to -- to change the cassette.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: This is the end of side A, tape five, interview with Norman Salsitz.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nNorman Salsitz. This is tape number five, side B.",
        "A: So we spoke about -- about [indecipherable] didn\u2019t know too much. And then -- now\nthe Warsaw uprise, this is the main thing, which was a very important thing, because they\ndidn\u2019t fight to win a war, because this wasn\u2019t how -- because they knew that they would\nbe killed. This was only for a fight to pay back a little bit, to take revenge. Not to go and\nbe killed without killing somebody else, and also to show that there are -- there is some\nresistance. This is for the honor of the Jews, for the honor of the Jewish flag. And there\nwere other camps that they were resistance, but people don\u2019t know about it, it -- very few.\nLike for instance, there 1s a film, I -- probably you saw it, is the, \u201cEscape from Sobibor.\u201d\nDid you see this? It\u2019s a very powerful video, and -- and how they tried to save m --\nunfortunately from the people who escaped, they all practically were killed by the Poles,\nvery few survived. As a matter of fact, the man who was the leader, his name was\nFriedlander, he was the leader and the organizer of this revolt, he -- after he escaped, he\nsomehow survived, and he went back to his small town, he opened a small store, and six\nmonths later he was killed by the natives, by his friends, after he went out from Sobibor.\nSo this 1s a very -- it\u2019s a big tragedy that even the people who did something, they were s\n-- they were killed later. Now, I have friends who were in the resistance in different\nplaces, but after the war, they were killed. Now -- now, take for instance, Treblinka, it\nwas the most horrible camp, because Treblinka was not con -- con -- was not converted\nfrom a labor camp. This was built as a death camp, and they -- everything was done there\nfor the death camp. It was very terrible. 700,000 people were killed there. And when you\nsay 700,000 dollars, I say it so fast, like -- like -- like we will count 700 dollars. So the --\nan -- and from Treblinka they had also revolt and escape. From the escape on -- 600\nescape, and how they escaped. Not from the people who had to be killed, from the people\nwho were the permanent prisoners, who did the undressing, taking out the gold from the\nteeth, and from the 600, 40 survived from the -- from the 600, cause on the -- fr --\nthrough the time they were killed. There is even a story that a Polish group, two Polish\npeople found 12 people from Treblinka hiding in the woods, and they killed them. And\nwhen after -- after the war, somebody denounced them, and they were taken to court, and\nthey got -- those two got three years jail for killing the 12 people. And after three years,\nthey were -- came out, and imagine, for killing 12 people who escaped from Treblinka,\nthey got three years. After they escaped, and they -- they were living in Poland, and later\nwhen the government changed, it wasn\u2019t any more a Communist government, in 1989,\nwhen -- after Lech Walesa, when they had the solidarity. So the people sued the\ngovernment that they were arrested in -- and they -- and they were in jail three years. And\nthe reason why they sued the government, they said they killed Jewish Bolshevik bandits.\nThe people were Jewish Bolshevik bandits. Now, the people escaped from Sobibor,\nthey\u2019re hide -- they were hidden -- them -- they hid themselves in the woods. So they\nsaid that they were Jewish Bolshevik bandits, and the reason they killed them 1s because\nthey were good Polish patriots, and they wanted to kill the Bolshevik bandits. And this\nwhat they -- when they ki -- they say -- they sued the government. So th -- so one got in --\nfrom the government, they gave him something, 400 million zlotas, which it was not\nmillions, 1t came out to about 40,000 dollars compensation because they were three years\nin jail. Because they say tha -- this what -- they killed the Jews doesn\u2019t mean anything,\nbut they say they killed Jewish Bolshevik bandits. And -- so th -- after this, when they got\nthis in court, so about 300 Poles who were arrested for killing Jews, all of them started to\nsue the government, that they say that we killed Jewish Bolshevik bandits. And it\u2019s a very\nunfair. Now, I got -- when -- when I\u2019m prepare -- I\u2019m preparing now the new book, so I\ngot a order from Bukonroffsky. Bukonroffsky was the head of the Polish underground in\nPoland, from the AK, General Bukonroffsky. So I got a order from Bukonroffsky, from\nSeptember 1943, that he gave a order to all Polish AK members, that they should go out\nin the woods, and to find the Jewish Bolshevik bandits, and to kill them. And this is\nwhen, about three months later, when I approached my friend, he should take in my\ngroup, into his group, and then when they shot me, probably this was on account of the\norder that they have to kill all -- and also the order said, first you have to kill the\ncommandant, and once the commandant will be killed, it will be easy to kill the rest of\nthe group. So for this reason, probably, they got -- wanted to get rid of me, and then later\nthey would kill the rest of us. So I got from England, I got the original order, the date, the\nnumber, because tho -- this is in the archives of this Polish underground, which 1s still in\nLondon.",
        "Q: And I'd like to come back for the last two questions to America, and you mentioned\nbefore the Holocaust museum in Washington, D.C., and also Yad Vashem in -- in Israel.\nHow do you see the role of the Holocaust museum here, and do you keep up with some\nof the politics that are swirling around? And let\u2019s -- the first question first, how do you\nsee the role of the museum here?",
        "A: Well, the role of the museum, I am very disappointed, is because the museum actually\n-- this is -- it is a government institution, it is a government museum. Now, for this reason\nI was very much for Dr. Royach, because Dr. Royach was very dedicated, and he wanted\n-- he did not need this job, because he had a very good practice, he\u2019s a psychiatrist. But\nhe wan -- because I know, I had discussions with him before he took the job, because he\ndidn\u2019t want to take the job in fir-first place. Then later -- and I talked him in -- well, in --",
        "Q: He was the previous director?",
        "A: He was the previous director, and he spoke to me, naturally he didn\u2019t take on my\nwork, but he ask me what I think about it, we are very good friends. So he wanted -- he\nwa -- took this job, because he wanted it should be a Jewish museum. It should be -- it --\nthe Holocaust shouldn\u2019t be watered down. Because there was a case that the -- some other\nnationalities or other ethnic groups came 1n, and they said well, we had a Holocaust.\nHolocaust was for the Jews. The Polish people say Polish Holocaust. Poland didn\u2019t have\na Holocaust, because by Jews, every Jew had to be killed. No -- in -- in Poland, if you did\nsomething wrong, they arrested you. If you were in the underground, they caught you\nwith weapons, they caught you with black mart -- mark -- market, so they arrested you.\nAnd wi -- and if they arrested you, it doesn\u2019t mean that the whole family had to be killed.\nBy Jews is -- they\u2019re like Elie Wiesel said, not all victims were Jews, but all Jews were\nvictims. So -- so he wanted to keep it as a Jewish museum, and -- and -- and now, when\nhe is on -- now that he received the best proof, he was pushed out because he didn\u2019t want\nArafat should come as a Head of State. First thing, Arafat was not a Head of State, and th\n-- he said if Arafat was not such a Jew lover, and if he wanted to s -- that they said to\nlearn about the Holocaust, he had Yad Vashem right under his nose. And he knew very\nwell what the Holocaust is, because if Arafat will come as a Head of State, they had to\nclose the museum, and give him the VIP treatment, and he was against it. And for this\nreason he was fired. So he -- I am afraid that this will be watered down, that the\nHolocaust, the Jewish Holocaust will be watered down, because other people will came --\ncome in. Like there was once in -- in a -- what was it, not a -- no, Croatia wanted to make\na -- make something about the Holocaust, and Croatia was -- they were the worst\nmurderers in -- in the world. They had the Oestasha, the Oestasha killed thousands and\nthousands of Serbs, thousand and thousands of -- of Jews, and now they are the victims,\nthe victims of the Holocaust. Now, they were collaborators with Germany. They were not\noccupied by Germany, they were collaborators, it was never occupied by Germany. So\nthis -- so I think that the Holocaust museum will be watered down, because it will not be\nstrict that it\u2019s a Jewish Holocaust, where Yad Vashem is only a Jewish Holocaust,\nbecause they don\u2019t have other ethnic groups to be Yad Vashem, and to do -- to say, well,\nthis was my Holocaust. And -- so it\u2019s a big difference. Now you have a other -- a -- a\nmemorial museum in -- in New York. Now this is a new story, because this is a\nHolocaust museum, but it has three tiers. The first one when you go in, this -- they show\nyou the book -- the -- the life of Jews from before the war. And if you go in, you will see\nthere\u2019s some of my pictures there. Then you have -- you have the -- the second floor is\nthe Holocaust, and the third floor is how the Jews picked up their life after the Holocaust.\nIt\u2019s a whole different -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a all different story. But in Washington, I am afraid\nthat the -- that the people who are now in charge, they will water down the Jewish\nHolocaust, and they -- they are artifacts, I gave them a lot of artifacts there what they\nhave. But they arti -- and this was the reason that Dr. Royach was pushed out, because he\nwanted it should be a Jewish Holocaust museum, wa -- that the Holocaust was only\nJewish.",
        "Q: I have only one question left for you. Is there anything that I didn\u2019t ask you, or that\nyou haven\u2019t mentioned yet that you think is very important? And you can think about it\nfor a second. One or two things. One or two things.",
        "A: Well, to be -- which is important that -- look, we can talk and talk, there is a lot of\nthings important, but, about the Holocaust I think the most important thing is, is not to\nforget that there was a Holocaust. Because we cannot have the six million people die in\nvain. And in vain I mean they die, and there will be no remembrance, and there will not\nbe no -- ho-how should I say it? That the people should not cry after them, because they\ndied for no reason at all. That we should talk about them. So this is very important. And -\n- and the boo -- all the books, every book which 1s written, from every Holocaust, if the\nbook 1s good, if the book is bad. Some are better, some are not so good, but everybody\nhas to tell a story, and it\u2019s -- I encourage always when people say well, I want to write a\nbook, I encourage them, and if I can help them in any way, I do. Because everybody has a\ndifferent story. So naturally some book are not so important, they are not -- but still, it\u2019s\nan important thing, because this is written by a survivor, and if he survived, it is\nimportant. [clock chiming]. Well, so this is -- this is mostly what, you know, so the\nchildren should be -- they should be taught -- they should be rem-reminded, and they\nshould be told about the Holocaust. Because, if the children of my sisters, who were three\nand a half, four, five years old, if they will know that 50 years later, somebody will speak\nabout them, maybe their life, their death wouldn\u2019t be so horrible. There will say\nsomebody will remember me 50 years later. But if -- and also, I want -- now I have my --\nI have my pictures that I saved, 500 photos. I remember the names, I remember the\norganizations they belong, and I want now to have an album. I don\u2019t know if you ever\nsaw Vishniak\u2019s album. There was a man tha -- he wrote -- he had pictures from life\n[indecipherable] in Jews. I want to have this album. The reason why -- and I want to\nmention everybody who is in the pictures, everybody\u2019s name, because I want that\nsomeday -- not someday, this -- everybody\u2019s name should be mentioned. It shouldn\u2019t be\nlike he lived like -- like comes in autumn, the leaves dry out, the wind comes, blows\naway the leave, and the leave disappears, like this was never -- it was never a leave. It\u2019s\nthe same thing, I don\u2019t want that the person who lived, and the Holocaust killed them, the\npeople were killed, and they disappeared, and the name was never mentioned. Because he\nwas a human being, he was alive, he had dreams. He wanted to live, and to have a future,\nto have children, have grandchildren. But he was wiped out. So I want this person, should\nbe written down that there was a man who lived. I have his picture. And then the pictures\nshould see this is how he looked. This what I want, and this what my dream is, to have an\nalbum with everybody\u2019s picture, it should be recorded that there was once a man like this,\nand he was destroyed. So there are certain things that I still would like to do. And if I will\ndo it, I don\u2019t know. I try.",
        "Q: My last question has sort of two parts. One 1s, you mentioned in the videotaped\ninterview that you didn\u2019t want to come to America, but you -- you went, and you never\nthought you could as -- achieve as much as you have. My question -- my first question\nthen is, what did you achieve?",
        "A: Well, yeah, I didn\u2019t want to come America, because -- I think I explained to you, my\naim was -- my dream was a --",
        "Q: Yes, but what did -- but what did --",
        "A: -- and then when I came America, like I said to you that when I -- in the beginning, I\ncouldn\u2019t make a living, I didn\u2019t have a job, and I was nobody, because here in America is\n-- even if you are nobody, but when you have money, you give charity, you become\nsomebody. So then, what I achieved, I established a business, I established certain things\nthat -- donations. I helped my family in -- in Israel 1f I could. I -- and -- and -- and -- I -- I\nam involved in -- in a lot of organizations, and -- and people know me. Like, for instance,\nif we go someplace, and my wife is always, see this is Norman Salsitz, he wrote this\narticle, nor -- so this is an achievement, that I am somebody, and it doesn\u2019t mean that I\nhave to make money out of it, but I want to be involved, and I am involved. Some people\nthey -- they didn\u2019t want to be involved. And ever -- if I belonged to organization, I cannot\njust belong to organization, and to say, well I -- I belong to organization, I pay dues and\nthat\u2019s it. If I belong to org -- organization, I have to be active. Otherwise I don\u2019t belong to\nthe organization. And achievement is like three years ago, I -- I was the man of the year\nhere in -- in Springfield. [indecipherable] made a nice -- and a f -- and a few years before,\nfrom Israel, once, I was honored. This was a -- this 1s an achievement that I am doing\nsomething, and then the people try to -- to pay back something. Not in money, but some\nacknowledgement. And everybody wants to have some acknowledgement. So this what I\nmeant, that in America, I started to make a living, maybe a little better than -- more than a\nliving, and -- and we live like -- like American people. Live a nice house. My daughter\ngot married, I bought her a house. She opened her office in Boston, I bought her a -- I\nbought her a -- a office in Boston. Two weeks ago I went, and I bought her a house in\nNew Hampshire. She wanted a house on the -- on the -- on the lake, it to -- should be\nclose to where the ski -- because they going skiing every weekend 1n the winter, so this\nwill be close. So this is an achievement, that I could do it for my daughter. Now, I don\u2019t\nknow if she could do it on her own, but if I did it, and for my grandchildren, this is an\nachievement.",
        "Q: Well, maybe that was already the answer to my very last question, but let me say this.\nIn the very beginning of this interview, I asked you who was Naftali Salishitz, and then I\nasked you who was Taddek. Now I ask you who then is Norman Salsitz at this point?",
        "A: Well, Norman Salsitz is all of those things, all of those things. Now, if I speak about\nsomething, and if I want to say something from my hometown, Kolbushova, I alway -- I\ncall it home. I am -- I was there 22 years, but I am in the United States 50 years, more\nthan double, but still this -- even America is dear to me, and I think -- I think the best --\nbiggest patriots America had -- has, are people -- newcomers, because we appreciate\nAmerica. Some people who are born in America, they don\u2019t appreciate America. We\nappreciate. And then, if -- if -- so I love America, but still, when I say home, I have my\nlittle town, this is my home. Taddek was when I survived, and to be -- why did I survive?\nI fought back. I didn\u2019t survive because I was standing there with my hands down when I\nwas laying on the floor, shot four times. And if I wouldn\u2019t be able to grab my revolver,\nand to kill them, I wouldn\u2019t be alive, because they were -- today I got a letter from one of\nthe people from my town in -- a very nasty letter, a very anti-Semitic letter. She is the\nhead of the culture and history department. She was a professor in university. A very\nanti-Semitic letter. And I answered her also a very strong letter. And then later she wrote\nto me, which I never answered, she said, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t,\u201d -- I accused her of being anti-\nSemitic, she said, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t kill nobody, but you are a murderer.\u201d Why am I\nmurderer? Because I killed those two guys. So when I was laying on the floor, wounded\nfour times, I should have | -- be there, and beg them give me one more bullet, and finish\nme off. But because I protected myself, and my brother, and I shot them, so n-naturally I\nam a murderer. So -- so when it comes Taddek, Taddek 1s somebody who refused to die.\nWhen it comes to Norman Salsitz, Norman Salsitz is all of those things. Now, I am\nliving, I am in a free country, I can do anything I want. I never had anything bad from the\ngovernment in the United States. They never did anything wrong to me, and I can speak\nup. If something is wrong, I open my mouth. I have -- I have stories here is that\nsomething happens in -- in -- in Hoboken, something happens there, but I always spoke\nup, and I always could yell, and I always could say what I want. Nobody said be -- be\nquiet because you are a Jew. Nobody yet. There were some people who have anti-Semitic\nremarks, but nobody yet told me [indecipherable], nobody kicked me because I am a Jew.\nAnd this is what America is. I can be what I am, and I am not afraid that somebody will\nsay you cannot be this, you cannot be this because you somebody different. And this\nwhat I tell the children when I spoke to them. You should be on the watch, if some\nskinhead, or somebody comes to you, and will -- he will tell you a story that this Black 1s\nnot good, that this Oriental is not good, this Jew is not good. You should always answer,\nand you should always stay on guard, and then, we will not have a Holocaust in America.\nBut if nobody will say it, who knows? There will be enou -- enough people, they will get\nbigger and bigger, and we could have problems. So this the people -- the children\nunderstand. But being in America I think is a privilege, and the privilege is because I can\nbe anything I want. I can be -- so long as I\u2019m not against the law. The only thing I cannot\nbe is a president, because I was not born here. But otherwise, I can be anything\n[indecipherable] capable, I can do it. Nobody can stop me. My daughter, she is a daughter\nof survivors, she is a lawyer. My son-in-law, he\u2019s a third generation, he\u2019s my son-in-law,\nhe\u2019s a assistant professor at Harvard. He\u2019s acknowledged, he goes around all the world.\nMy grandchildren, I hope they will be something. They can do it here. Where we, being\nin Poland for thousand years -- see, I always -- I always was a Polish Jew. And this what\nI was hurt. I wanted to be a Jewish Pole. Being a Jewish Pole it means I could be a Jew\nProtestant, I could be a Jew Christian, a Jew cat -- a -- a-- a Jew Catholic, but I wanted to\nbe a Jewish Pole, but no, I was a Polish Jew. And this is a big difference between a Polish\nJew, and a Jewish Pole. And this what I could never achieve in Poland. Like take for\ninstance, in Italy. In Italy the Jews were treated very well, and 80 percent of Jews in ta --\nin Italy survived. There were not too many Jews in Italy, but as many there were, 80\npercent survived. Now you will ask, Mussolini was a partner with Hitler. Why? Because\nthe Italian people said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have Jews. We have Italians with a different religion.\u201d\nThis what they approved the Jew, a different religion. And th -- and again, later, when\nthey had undergrounds, so they asked th-the Italians from the underground, they said,\n\u201cWhy do you go and help the Jews?\u201d They said, \u201cWhen we on the underground, we fight\nagainst Hitler. Everything what Hitler says, we are opposite. He says to kill the Jew, so\nwe save them.\u201d But in Poland, was different. In Poland, when he said to kill the Jews,\nthey said -- my wife had a boyfriend, he loved her, and he was everything. He said, \u201cI\nhate the Germans, what they do with Poland, but one thing I have to admire and thank\nthem, that they got rid of the Jews for us.\u201d And he was a Polish patriot. But this was very\nimportant, he got rid of the Jews. So this is the different America -- I say America is my\ncountry. See, when it comes the Fourth of July, I hang out a flag. I am the only one on the\nstreet to hang out the flag. And the reason why I hang out the flag, because in Poland, if I\ndidn\u2019t hang out the flag, the police came, gave me a fine. Here, nobody gets fined by the\npolice, and because they don\u2019t force me, I want to hang out a flag, because I think this is\nvery important for me.",

        "Answer: I was born May the sixth, 1920, in a small town in Poland, southern Poland,\nnamed Kolbushova. And this -- people think that this -- well, this was known as\nGaleetsia, because before 1918, this belonged to Austria, and now as a section of Poland\nwas called Galeetsia, so there where I was born. Then it became Poland, and it -- the\nsection was called minor Poland. So, it was a very small town. It -- the town had 4,000\npeople, and from the 4,000 people, 2,000 were Jews, and 2,000 were Poles -- Catholics.\nWe only had Catholics in our section. Protestants, we didn\u2019t have any Protestants there,\nso all Jews, or Catholics.",
        "A: Yes. I can give you the names, because sometimes when I -- on the street, or when I\nam in New York, and there are people who call me when they see me, and they call me\ndifferent names, and I know from th -- where they know me. Well now -- will tell you the\n-- the names. So for -- I was born as Naftali Salishitz. Salishitz was like -- is pronounced\nas a ger -- German name, because we were in Austria, with a u -- umlaut, and this how I\nwas born. In the war, I became the first one that it was changed. It was Tadosh Yadduch.\nTadosh Yadduch is when I joined the Polish underground, the AK, which is the home\narmy, and in Polish it\u2019s armia kryova. They didn\u2019t accept Jews, so I had to get some\npapers, and I masqueraded as a Polish Catholic, and with my papers, my birth certificate,\nwhich we will talk about it later, was Tadosh Yadduch, so my name was -- this was the\nname, and also, my friends called me Taddek. This is from Tadosh, is Taddek. So for\nthis, if I hear somebody calls me Taddek, so I know they know me from this town. Then\nmy name was, when I was there, so my name was -- became, in one part, it became\nLazerosh Spillman. I had to do a certain job, and I had to be a German, so I had a friend,\nhis name was Lazerosh Spillman, I took his name, and -- and this was for a short time,\nbecause Spillman is German, Lazerosh [indecipherable]. Then I wer -- I -- my name\nbecame Anatoli Sherberkof. Anatoli Sherberkof is when I joined the r -- Russian group,\nand there were Russians, and again I had to masquerade as a -- as a -- as a Russian, so my\nname was Anatoli Sherberkof. Then when I -- after the war, after I was liberated, I joined\nthe Polish army. I volunteered for the Polish army, and my name became Tadosh\nSzaleski, because Tadosh, I liked the name, and Szaleski is because it\u2019s a very -- it\u2019s a\nnice, Polish name, with the s-k-i in the end. And this -- I used this name during my time\nin the Polish army, which I had a very, very important position, until I escaped. Also -- so\nnow, when I see a person calls me Taddek, and so I know from where. And calls me\nNaftali, so I know he knows me from home. And then, my name was -- I was called\nLotchik. Lotchik in Russian means a pilot, because when I joined the army, I was\naccepted to the air force, and everybody envied me, because very few people were\naccepted to the air force. So 1n po -- Russian is called Lotchik, so people called me\nLotchik. Now even today, when I see some friends from this time, they say, \u201cOh, Lotchik\nis calling.\u201d Yeah. And then when I came to America -- so I changed my name from\nNaftali, because I came to America on my real name Naftali Salishitz. So I changed my\nname to Norman Salsitz, because my family thought that this is a -- all my family\nchanged their names, and I picked out Salsitz, and nor -- and there is a whole story about\n-- about how I would change, but this is not for now. I have the story in my ne -- coming\nbook how my name was changed. So I remained with na -- with Norman Salsitz, and this\nhow I am today.",
        "A: Now --",
        "A: Well, you want to know why I\u2019m named Naftal1?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Well, Naftali -- I was the youngest in my family, which means all my sis -- I had five\nsisters. My fif -- sisters were older, and I was very, very spoiled, because all of them, as a\nmatter of fact, til I was three, four years, one sister, which I liked very much -- I liked all\nof them -- I called her mama til I was four years old. They actually raised me, because my\nmother had nine children, so it was very hard for her. We lived in one room in this time,\nand there was -- I was born after the war. So I was very spoiled. And then later, nothing\nwas impossible for me, because the family allowed me for a lot of things. And later,\nwhen I was older, I was not an angel. I did certain things that my father didn\u2019t like.\nNaturally, I didn\u2019t do bad things, but I was -- I was a re -- always I was a rebel. And I\nalways, if I -- I always reached higher, that my -- my kind of people, or my family\nexpected, especial later, when I started to go out with the girl of my dreams,\n[indecipherable]. I always wanted something higher, and I -- in school, I was a very -- I\nwas, in my class in the public school, I was always the best student. And I have all my\nreport cards. I have the report cards from the first grade to the last grade, I saved them,\ntogether with my photos. And I ver -- it was very unusual for a Jewish boy, who had\nsidelocks, and was reli -- and was dressed as a -- as a Hassidic boy, to have good report\ncards, because the teachers all were Poles -- Catholics, there was not a Jewish teacher,\nand they all hated Jews. Because I would say -- oh, maybe it\u2019s not the right expression,\nbut I would say 95 percent they hated Jews, and especial they hated a Jew who was a\nreligious Jew. We were different. So -- to -- for a Jew like this, to get a report card with --\nfrom top to bottom excellent, it was very unusual, but I have the report cards. Now, I\nwent also to a Jewish school, we called it Yeshiva -- Chadda -- or Yeshiva, where we\nlearn Jewish subjects. Now, I was not so good there, and my father always -- always ask\nquestions. \u201cHow comes in the Polish school you are the best, and here you are not such a\ngood student?\u201d Well, I didn\u2019t have so much interest in it. I had interest in geography, in\nhistory. Even today, so many years later, if you will ask me -- there was the river Vistula\nin Poland, which was the main river. And the main river had so many small rivers\nrunning into the main river, to make it a bigger river. And it started in the Carpathian\nmountains, and it ended in the Baltic Sea, in Danzig. So I can today mention all the rivers\nwho fell in from the Carpathian mountains to the Vistula, the left and the right side. I\nremember it, because I was very interested 1n it. Poland had 40 kings, and if you will ask\nme, I will mention all the 40 kings, when they became kings, when they died. I remember\nthose things, because I had an interest in this. And --",
        "A: Two?",
        "A: Well, I would -- I would tell you, just as a test, I will tell you the first and the last one.\nMaybe this will be the [indecipherable]. The first one was Meershko Peervsha. It means\nme -- his name was Meershko, and he was the originator of the Polish kingdom, before\nPoland didn\u2019t have a kingdom, didn\u2019t have a country, there were tribes. And Meershko\nPeervsha was the first king, and he was also important, because in 966, he accepted\nChristianity for the Polish people. So 966 was very important. And the last one was\nZigmund August Porniatofsky. He was the last king, the 40\" king. So, h-he -- the --\nZigmund August Porniatofsky, there are rumors about him, that he was a lover of the\nRussian, and -- the czarina, and then -- and Poland didn\u2019t like it so much. Well, so those\nthings were very important for me. Like, for instance, the mountains in Poland, the rivers\nin Poland, I remember it, because I loved it. So for this reason, I was a very good student.",
        "A: I loved it for -- for a few reasons. The first thing it was to me -- when I lived in\nPoland, I considered myself a Pole, a patriot. I say, we live in this country -- Jews lived in\nPoland for a thousand years. My town existed since 1773. So 1t means oma -- over two\nhun -- 200 years. So I always said, if I live in a country, I -- this is my country. Naturally,\nin this time -- and so I loved it, and I loved everything, and also literature. If you will ask\nme about Polish writers, and Polish literature -- literature, I remember important poems.\nAnd -- and I -- I liked it. Where the Jewish learning, I did it because my father wanted me\nto do it. I was proud to be a Jew, but I wanted to show, because I lived in Poland, and\nbecause the peep -- Polish people didn\u2019t like us, so I wanted to show that I am a good\nPole. And so was my father. My father was, I would say, the biggest Polish patriot in our\ntown. He was a Jew with the long beard, and -- and very religious, very learned, but he\nwas one of the few who spoke Polish beautiful. He spoke Polish without a Jewish accent,\ncorrect grammar, ever -- he spoke -- now, as a matter of fact, 1f sometimes they had to\nsend a delegation to the Polish peep -- to the government or something, my father went as\na spokesman, because on account of his language. And when there were some national\nholidays or something, my sp -- father spoke about -- spoke, because it was unusual to\nsee a Jew with a long, gray beard speak Polish. Now, there was a reason why he spoke\ngood Polish, and if later -- if you will have time, I will tell you the reasons. So I li -- now,\nfor instance, there was a peasant movement in Poland, which 90 -- I would say 75 percent\nof the population were peasants. And they were not very well off before the war. They --\nthe government didn\u2019t treat them very right, because where -- because the government\nwas run by the nobility, and by people who were educated, and the peasants didn\u2019t have a\nchance. Now, my father was the only Jew in our town that he belonged to this movement.\nAnd when the peasants used to make gatherings in our town, which the government was\nagainst it, and the thousands of thousands of peasants came to the marketplace to speak\nabout the unjustice, what the government is doing against the Poles, against the peasants,\nall the meetings, everything was done in our house. Now, he did it because he believed in\nit, and also he did business with the peasants. Our business -- he had the wholesale\ngrocery store, and the wholesale -- the grocery store was not a grocery, it was like in\nAmerica you have a general store; we sold everything. We sold in a -- grease for wagons,\nand we sold kerosene, and we sold flour -- wi -- everything was in our store. So the small\nstores in the villages came to buy by us, because we were the wholesaler. And so this\nway he had the contact with the people. Also, he had the contact because he was born in\nthat village. He was born in that village in 1882, in a village called Dubass, which is\nabout five kilometer from Kolbushova. His father was the manager of the village. Now, I\nwant you should know that a village isna -- wasn\u2019t like it\u2019s now, which is everybody land\n-- owned land. A village belonged to one person. In old -- it was a serfdom, it was a -- so\nthen the -- all the people worked for this person, and my grandfather was the manager.\nWhen to cut, when to gather, when to sell, he was the manager. And in Poland he had --\nin Polish he had a special name, they called him Veeairnick. Veeairnick in Poland means\na man -- a trust -- a trustee. It means that you believed him. So the man who owned the\nvillage trusted him, and he was managing, and naturally the profit went to the owner. So\nmaybe this is the reason my father had a little connection to the land, to the people, and\nnaturally, they didn\u2019t reciprocate, they didn\u2019t pay him back that they loved him, because -\n- maybe they liked him, but they didn\u2019t love him because he was a Jew.",
        "A: No, no. Taddek Yadduch.",
        "A: Taddek Yadduch.",
        "A: Taddek. This was --",
        "A: -- Tadosh, right.",
        "A: Tadosh I became, is after I went through -- the Germans came in -- after I went\nthrough the ghetto. I went through three camps, from which I escaped, and I went in to\nthe underground, to the woods. We had a Jewish group. In our Jewish group, we had 120\n-- this is a long story -- we -- I describe it in my books. We had 125 members in our\ngroup, Jews. We started to get arms, guns, and then later, I was shot by my -- one of my\nbest friends, he shot me four times, three bullets entered my neck. And this was a man\nwho was the head of this Polish underground, AK, armia kryova, the home army. And he\nwas a friend, we went to school together. But nevertheless, I was a Jew, and the armia\nkryova, the home army didn\u2019t accept Jews, and when I came to him that he should\nincorporate my group -- because later I became the commandant of my Jewish group.\nNow, we had -- the highest number of our group was 125, but in this time we had about\n69, because we started to be killed, killed, killed. Not by Germans, we were mostly killed\nby Poles. So when I saw that we are being killed, and I find out that he is the leader, so I,\nthrough messengers I sent him, I want to have a meeting with him, and when I had the\nmeeting, I offered that we have al-almost 70 people, young people, and we want to join\nhis group, and I even told him that he can use us to the most dangerous -- [clock chiming]",
        "A: So -- so he can use us to the most dangerous actions, because we didn\u2019t have for to\nlose. But we would be pro-protected from this Polish underground. So I figured because\nhe was my schoolmate, and he\u2019s the leader, so I will have a chance that he will accept us.\nAnd we -- this is also a long story, I have it in the book, and we had the first meeting.\nWhen we had the meeting, he shot me from behind, he shot me fo -- his brother, actually,\nwith him together. They shot me four times. Three bullet entered my neck, one in my\nhand, I fell down, that I\u2019m -- and I was sure that I would be dead, that I am dead, I felt\ndizzy. And -- and -- so then, when I came -- when I -- the --",
        "A: So -- so, okay?",
        "A: So -- so when I came -- and so when I came to him, I had already a false document\nwhich I got from a monsignor, and my name became -- a-a-again -- after -- now, people\nask, \u201cYou were shot, so what happened?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I was not dead, otherwise I\nwouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d So, but I killed him. Laying on the floor, I shot him, and his brother,\nand then later I knew I cannot be any more with my group, because they started to look\nfor my group, and they -- and I thought my group would suffer on account of me, because\nthey knew I did it. So I went to a different section, and I became a member of this\norganization with my name as Tadosh Yadduch.",
        "A: Changed in what? In what -- in what way?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Revenge was very important for me, and the revenge was important for a\nfew reasons, but the main reason was, when my father was shot in the ghetto, the 28\" of\nApril, 1942, I witnessed it. And when he was shot by the Gestapo, before he died, he said\nwhat a Jew usually says before he dies, God is [indecipherable], we call it the shema\nIsrael. And then he said -- the last words were, \u201cNakuma, nakuma, nem nakuma.\u201d\u2019 It\nmeans, revenge, revenge, take revenge. Now, he said it in such a voice, that it was not a\nnatural voice, it was something that 1t came from heaven, an unnatural voice, which I --\ntil today, it is already almost 70 years, I can still hear his voice yelling to take revenge.\nAnd this gave me strength to survive. I said, \u201cI must survive to take revenge.\u201d For this\nreason, revenge was so important for me. Some people say so what is revenge? Revenge\nis nothing. Not for me, ben when you started to think, everyone who has a family, and if\nhe would started to think that all his family were killed by certain people, and they were\nnot only killed, before they were killed, they were tortured. Hunger, beating, starvation,\nand then finally killed, and you will say, \u201cWell, if I can get these men, I am going to kill\nthem.\u201d Sure now, in 1999, you don\u2019t think about it, because we are normal people, la --\nwe live in America. But in this time, the only dream I had is to take revenge. And for this\nreason, revenge was so important. Only -- also, this was my father\u2019s -- the legacy what I\ngot from my father. Also, revenge was important, I had five sisters. My five sisters were\nmarried. They had little children. I was very close to the children, we lived together. And\nwhen I started to think, there\u2019s a little girl, her name was Blimcha, she was three and a\nhalf years. She was like an angel, with gold curled hairs. And if I start to think that this\ngirl had to be killed, and the others, I had 21 people. Why were they killed? For no -- not\nbecause they were bad, they were killed just because they were Jews. And if I survived,\nand if I wouldn\u2019t take -- I was the only survivor, and maybe if they are in heaven, I don\u2019t\nknow, they would s -- or -- or before they were killed, they knew, because I always was\nthe one who went down from the ghetto, brought food, and brought them candy. And if\nthey would be killed, they would say, \u201cWell, Naftali will take care on it.\u201d And they\nprobably thought about it, that I would take care on it. If they are in heaven, which I\ndon\u2019t know if they are, this is a different story, if they are, and if they look down, and\nthey said -- and they looked at me and said, I was the survivor, the survivor to take\nrevenge, and if wouldn\u2019t take revenge, I will be a traitor, I would be a disappointment for\nthem, because I was the only one. So I had to take revenge. Now, after the war, after I\ncame to America, I still take revenge. But I cannot go out, take bodily revenge, physical\nrevenge. So my revenge is that I survived the war to tell the story, to tell the cruelties, to\ntell the murdering things. This is my revenge, and maybe this is the reason I survived.\nOtherwise, why did I survive, why not the other people? But this is the reason that I\nsurvived. In the war it was a physical revenge. Now the revenge is, like I\u2019m speaking to\nyou, I give other testimonies, I go to schools. I go -- people ask me -- if somebody asked\nme to speak about the Holocaust, I am always ready. I never took a penny, people want to\npay me, I said, \u201cNo, this is not a thing that I want to get paid.\u201d Y -- I have to do it, so long\nas I am alive, because in a few years there will not be survivors. And who knows? If now\nwe have deniers, where we are still alive, what will be a few years later? So my duty is to\ntell and retell the cruelties. To tell the stories, because I was a witness. I was there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: See, well people ask me -- everybody had a reason why he survived, had a legacy. I\nhad two legacies, and I said I must survive. The first legacy was that my father said\nrevenge, revenge, reven -- this I said, I must live to take revenge, because if -- if my\nfather is in heaven, as we believe, how would I be able to face him, he ask me, \u201cDid you\ndo something, did you take revenge because they shot me?\u201d I did. Maybe I didn\u2019t take\nenough revenge, looking back, I didn\u2019t take enough, but I did. The second legacy was\nwhen my mother was taken from the town of Jheshuf, from the ghetto, cause we were\ntaken from Kolbushova, from a small town to a larger town, to Jheshuf, where they\ngathered more Jews, to be able to send them to a death camp. And when she was taken to\nBelzyce, to the death camp, with all her five sis -- daughters, with the son-in-laws, with\nher grandchildren, somehow she gave somebody a letter. She could give a letter, and I\nwas on this time in a camp, and they brought the letter to me. And I remember -- I don\u2019t\nhave the letter, I would give everything to have the letter, but I don\u2019t have it. But I\nremember the words. And she wrote to me, \u201cYou are the youngest of my nine children,\nand you know always the youngest is the smartest,\u201d in their eyes. \u201cYou are young, you\nare strong, you are smart. You go and survive the war, because after the war, you go to\nAmerica, and tell to El,\u201d I had a brother already in America. \u201cTell to El,\u201d his name was\nEl, \u201cwhat the murderers did to us. Go to Palestine.\u201d I had a brother in Palestine, David.\n\u201cGo to David, and tell him what the murderers did to us. Go to the world, and tell the\nworld what the murderers did to us.\u201d She se -- she also wrote, \u201cLet your being an orphan\nnot break you. Go out, fight, be strong, and survive.\u201d This gave me a o-other s -- reason\nto survive, and for this reason, from the first minute when I was liberated, when people\ndidn\u2019t want to tell stories about the Holocaust, from the first minute, I spoke. People, in\nthe beginning, didn\u2019t like it. They looked at me and they saw this is an obsession, that I\nspeak about the Holocaust, but I spoke. People who survived, they didn\u2019t want to speak.\nIt took a long time til they started to speak in the 60\u2019s and the 70\u2019s. I spoke about the\nHolocaust in \u201945, and \u201946, but people didn\u2019t want to listen. When I came to America,\nwhen I told the people, they thought I\u2019m crazy. They didn\u2019t want to listen. This was the\nlegacy from my mother. So those two legacies were the most important thing. It wasn\u2019t\nimportant that if I am alive, and not alive. So other men will s -- survive. I never -- I\nnever thought that being alive was such an important thing as a personal thing, that I am\nalive. But a pers -- the important thing were those two legacies that I could fulfill.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Well, before liberation -- this was in July, 1944. Now, we were left from 125 Jews --\nI\u2019m not talking about the town, the town was gone. The town was liquidated July the\nseventh, 1942, they were taken to Jheshuf, and Jheshuf to Belzyce, they were killed. But\nthen later on we get some people together, and finally we were 125, and from the 125\nthey started to kill us, and mostly Polish people killed us. And in the book I describe\nthere some raids they made on us. And in -- in July \u201944, we were left only six people\nfrom the whole group.",
        "A: The six people -- this was -- I was there with my brother, my older brother Lyebish.\nHe was 16 years older. Then were two brothers, Lybovitch. One was Lyba, and one was\nHerschel. And the Lyba actually, if not Lyba, we wouldn\u2019t survive, because he was a\nvillage Jew, and his profession was he was a trapper before the war, and he knew the\nwoods. And I described what things -- he lived I-like a woodsman, and to me he -- his --\nhis -- he was like a -- a deer. He was -- he was like -- like a animal. Not an animal in a\nbad sense, but he knew all those things, h-he could [indecipherable]. So, on account of\nhim, we could survive. And his older brother was with him, so there were Lyba and his\nbrother, I and my bro -- and there were two from my town. One was Lyebish Nestel, one\nwas Connor. And the -- and the two were cousins, and they survived with us all the war.\nSo happens that they were -- the -- the other one was Naftali Connor. And they were\nreligious Jews. During all the time when we were -- they were with me in the ghetto, they\nwere with me in the camp, they were with me in the woods. And during all the time, they\ndidn\u2019t eat anything that it was not kosher -- it means it was not for Jews. So they only ate\na piece of bread, some fruit, vegetables if they had. If we had meat, they wouldn\u2019t eat it.\nIf we killed a deer, or we killed a rabbit, they wouldn\u2019t eat it. But anyway, they survived.\nAnd after, when they -- the -- when -- when we were liberated in -- in the end of July, so\nthey said, \u201cWe -- we are liberated. No more Germans. We are going home.\u201d And they\nthought they would come home, they will be looked on like on heroes. They survived\nfrom the whole war -- Jewish community. And they came home to my town three days\nafter they were liberated, this Polish AK, the Polish underground, took them, they wer --\nthey saw them. And they took them, and they shot them. After going through hell, losing\ntheir family, starving, everything, they were killed. And they were killed by very\nprominent people, not peasants. By two people -- and I know the people who killed them.\nOne, his name was Vladiswav Kishel. He was before the war, dir -- director of the\ninternal revenue in -- in Kolbushova, for te -- the text director. Intelligent person. The\nsecond one was Jellinsky. Jellinsky had a bus company in our town. He lived all his life\nwith Jews, because the Jews were traveling in the bus. They belonged to this\norganization. This organization took over the leadership for the first few days, before the\nRussians organized their own leadership. And they saw the two Jews, and they killed\nthem. From the whole group, so we were left only six. Now, I -- I ga --",
        "A: Well, I heard it right away, because when they went -- came to our town, they -- I told\nthem not to go, because I knew that nothing good -- because they killed so many during\nthe war, and when they went there -- then later, the Polish people between themselves,\neverybody knew about it, because this was not done in secret. They took them openly,\nand they took them to the river by the cemetery, and they shot them. And -- and the\npeople who were in my -- in our town, they told me this [indecipherable] not only one, a\nfew of them. There were some people who were very sympathetic, and they told me.\nNow, the reason, later -- and I wrote this in my book, and naturally the people are very\nangry in -- in my town why I wrote it about it, and they said to me, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have\nwrite it, because 1n case this book will be -- will be translated into Polish, this Kishel\nhas,\u201d -- he\u2019s now 85 years, he lives in the town, he had grandchildren. So the\ngrandchildren will find out that their grandfather was a murderer. So I shouldn\u2019t -- I\nshould retract it, I should write a article that is not true. They said he killed doesn\u2019t mean\nanything, but the children shouldn\u2019t know that he was a murderer. This what they wrote\nto me when the book came out. Now, I found out -- the reason why, which I understand,\nthe reason why -- why in this Kishel, who was the director of the internal revenue, he\nvolunteered he should kill them, because there were the group of the ar -- of the AK\nmembers, and when they caught the two Jews, he volunteered to kill them. Now, why\nshould he volunteer to kill them? The -- the -- the -- the reason was that this one of them,\nLyebish Nestel, he was such a nice person, a scholar. You see, both of them were\nrabbinical students, they were very intelligent people. So before the war, when the war\nblew out, he was in the active Polish army, and his unit, his regiment was sent over to the\nGerman border, because they had to protect Poland. And he was, and he was a very good\nsoldier. Now, also Kishel, the director of the internal revenue was in the reserve, he was\nan officer. And he was also in the same unit. And when the Germans attacked Poland,\nnaturally the units started to pull back. And they came to a small town in -- near the\nGerman border, near Katovitz. And this was -- mostly there were Jews, so the Kishel\nknew this Lyebish Nestel, so he said to him, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you go to the Jews, where\nyou are a Jew, and get two Hassidic coats [indecipherable], and we will change our\nuniform, and we will go home.\u201d To change as being Jews. This what he told to Lyebish\nNestel. So Lyebish Nestel said to him -- and this was his officer -- and a Polish guy, a\npatriot. So Lyebish Nestel told him, \u201cI will not do it. Iam in the army. I came here to\nprotect my country, to fight for my country. I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Kishel looked at him, and\nthat\u2019s -- this was it. Two days later, Kishel disappeared. He didn\u2019t know what a --\nprobably he did it on his own, he run away. Lyebish Nestel was fighting, fighting, til they\ncame near Lublin. This was deep into the Polish countryside, and he was taken as a\nprisoner by the Germans, as a soldier. Somehow, usually if Jews were taken as prisoners,\nthey didn\u2019t survive, because the Germans killed them. Somehow he run away. He run\naway, he came to our town, and he told everybody the story. He told the story how is it\npossible that Kishel -- and Kishel disappeared, nobody knew where he is -- where he was.\nNaturally, Lyebish was with me in the ghetto, he was with me in the camp, he was with\nme two years in the woods, and he got killed. Kishel disappeared. After the war, Kishel\nbecame very important because he was a leader in the AK, in the underground, and he\nwas not any more inter -- internal revenue, he was older, he had got married. He -- he had\nchildren. He lives now in a town in Poland. And I wrote his stories. They are now angry\nwhy I told his story. I told his story because this 1s the truth. So those two were killed. So\nfrom the six, only four survived. Now, from the four, from the four, six months later,\nLyba, who was our savior, who was the trapper, was poisoned in our -- in the village,\nthere he was -- there he was poisoned, he died. His brother Herschel was older, he went\nto Palestine before it -- Israel, and he died in Israel. Lyebish, my brother, came to\nAmerica, and he died in 1965, as a -- got the heart attack, he died. So I am the only one\nalive from our group, and there were very, very seldom places that Jews organized. So\nhappens we organized in the woods, nobody survives that. I have to tell those stories.\nNow, I know every one who got killed. I even wanted to write a book that everybody\u2019s\ndead. How it was, how he was killed, how he was betrayed -- mostly they were betrayed\nby Poles. Maybe I will do it yet. Why? Because I\u2019m the only one who wa -- I\u2019m alive.\nAnd if I would not be alive, nobody would know the stories. I tell to the families. If they\nhave somebody [indecipherable] how they were with me in the woods, and how they\ndied. So from the 125, I am only one alive.",
        "A: Well, when my bi -- liberation is, that when it was -- this was after -- after I had to\nescape from the AK, because like I said to you, I was a member in the AK, and there\nwere a few things, I don\u2019t know if you want me to tell you why I left the AK and came\nback to my brother. So the -- this -- this was -- okay, so -- so I came back, an -- I was\nabout a week or two weeks, but we already saw that it is the end. Why\u2019? Because we saw\nEricthsook. We saw that the Germans soldiers are coming, and they -- the army, and th-\nthey occupied the villages with their equipment. Every day more and more and more\nGerman soldiers. And we were in this time in hiding, because we didn\u2019t have a group any\nmore. So we knew -- and then we started to hear cannons. In every -- the night, the\ncannons were louder and louder, so we knew that this is the end, but how can we survive\ntil the end, because in the last minute -- we suffered for six years, in the last minute we\nwill be killed. So my brother, with one of those Lybovitch went to a friendly Pole, that\nwe used to go once in awhile to hide there, and they were with them, and I went with\nLyba to look, to see, to different peasants. Because we didn\u2019t know exactly, we knew it\u2019s\ncoming, but we didn\u2019t know exactly. So I went with Lyba to a peasant, his name was\nYanhodor. I had described him, he was very good, he was very friendly, he and his\nchildren. So we went to his house, and then we went -- we s -- we heard a unit of\nCalvary, German Calvary is going t -- he was -- the road was right next to his house, near\nthe woods. And the Calvary is going, you could hear the chains, and the horses. So we\nrun in -- in the -- in the barn, or where they was -- the hay, and we buried ourselves under\nthe hay, and then we -- so we heard that the soldiers coming in, opened the door, and they\ntaking out hay for their -- for the horses. So we were afraid that they would take away\neverything, we will be discovered. But we were not discovered, and after the -- the calva\n-- the units went, so we came out. We s -- we di -- we wanted to ask how the war is going\non, but he wasn\u2019t home, because when he saw that it is already so bad. So he, with his\nfamily, he took the few cows, and they were run into the forests to hide. So they were not\nhome. So, when we went out -- so we said, \u201cWell, we have to go to see what our brothers\nare doing,\u201d because my brother was with his brother, but the woman, her name was Mary\npren -- Prenetta. So we went -- we went to go out to see. As we came out from the woods\nwhere we were, and there was a big clearing, and we had to go over to the other side,\nwhere my brother, with his brother were. As we came out on the clearing, people started\nto shoot at us from both sides. Here in this side for where we lived, were the Germans,\nand the other side of the clearings were already the Russians. And when they saw two\npeople, they didn\u2019t know who we are. And both started to shoot millions of bullets. And\nthis was at night, and I just see bullets like -- like slow bugs, red, light [indecipherable].\nAnd so, we were afraid, so st -- luckily there was a small -- not a river, 1t was some water,\nwe jumped in in the water. And the -- the -- the -- the shooting stopped, and there were\nhaystacks, because this was in the time when they cut the hay, this was -- so we went in\nin the haystacks to cover ourselves. The shooting stopped, and then we didn\u2019t know\nwhere, what, when. We knew that there is a shooting between us. So when -- suddenly\nthere were two horses -- two riders on one horse, from a distance, and it was at night. So\nLyba, my friend, says, \u201cOh, I know those peasants.\u201d And he even said to me their name is\n-- one name is Poslooshnid. And he remembers even the horse, because he sold them the\nhorse before the war. Now, \u201cGo,\u201d he said, \u201cask them. Because if I\u2019m going to ask them,\nthey know I am a Jew, they could kill me. But you go, they don\u2019t know who you are.\u201d\nAnd I was dressed like a peasant, no shoes, with a jacket, and -- and I run up to them, and\nthey were on a -- two on a horse, and I -- I couldn\u2019t see who they are. And I started to y --\nto yell, Parnyi Poslooshnid, Poslooshnid. They heard me, they stopped. And when I run\nto them, and I come to them, and I saw on the horse, there are two SS men on the horse.\nAnd they -- and naturally they were dr-dressed, with the helmet, but in the distance I saw\na silhouette. So when they saw me, I s -- I didn\u2019t know what to do. To run away it was\ntoo late, ba -- so they jumped down from the horse, right away took out their guns, and\nthey start asking who I am. Now, I didn\u2019t want to say that I speak German, because\nusually Jews spoke German, not peasants. And I started to tell them with a crying voice,\nyou know, what will I do, my wife is in the woods, my children in the woods. They say\nthe Russians are raping the women, and I start -- so I could see that one of them\nunderstands Polish. Probably he was from Salazzi or something, and I could hear that\nhe\u2019s translating to the other soldier what I am saying. And when I saw that he\u2019s\ntranslating, so I started to cry more, and I said, \u201cHelp me, help me. We were with the\nGermans, nothing happened to us, an -- and now the Russians will come in a,\u201d -- well, so\nhe said -- the [indecipherable] he listened to me. So then he said to his -- so the other man\nsaid to him in German, which I understood, he said, \u201cNow, we don\u2019t have to go.\u201d\nBecause they were a patrol to see wa -- from where the Russian. We don\u2019t have to go --\nbecause they were afraid for themselves, too. Let\u2019s take him to our headquarters, and he\nwill tell us everything what we have to know. And they said to me, the guy, in Polish, to\ngo in front of them into -- they will take me. So -- and they went back on the horse, put\nback their revolvers in their holster, they had rifles, they were back in the\n[indecipherable] and I had to go in front. Now, I knew that if I would go there, I would be\nkilled. Why? Because I had a jacket, and underneath the jacket I had a belt, and on the\nbelt I had the revol -- I had the revolver, I had hand grenades, I had a hatchet, I had a\nbayonet, I have a flashlight. I have everything I had on me. Now when -- they didn\u2019t see\nit, because it was the -- the jacket covered it. But I always had a revolver, and the\nrevolver with the long barrel, remember, parabellum, I had. No, it wasn\u2019t a parabellum, it\nwas a -- a revolver. [indecipherable], and I always had it not in my holster, but I have it --\nhad it in front of me in my belt, stuck in my belt. And as they went back on the horse, I\nfigure -- I said, \u201cThis 1s my chance.\u201d I turned around, pulled out the revolver, and I\nemptied right away, all seven bullets to them, they fell down dead. And as I started to\nshoot, then you could see millions of bullets came from both sides. They didn\u2019t know\nwho is shooting, they saw shooting. So, you could see it. But luckily, they didn\u2019t hit me. I\nw -- I bend down, I had an even -- I [indecipherable] took away their revolvers, and --\nand -- and I took the horse, and I kept the horse from the side where the bullets are\ncoming in case a bullet will hit, it will kill the horse, and I moved over to the side, not\nfrom where I came, but I moved over to the opposite side. And I went over because I\nfigured why should I go here, here are the Germans, and there who know, maybe the\nRussians. I went over there, and as I came closer to the woods, and I saw a few came out,\nis a -- Russians, said to me to lift -- to raise my hand, and they looked at me, and they ask\nme who I am, so I said, \u201cI am a Polish partisan.\u201d I spoke Russian. And they took away\nthe revolvers, and they said, \u201cWe have to take you to our comman -- commander.\u201d And\nwe went to the commander, and I told him the whole story, and he was very -- see, I\ndidn\u2019t know if they would believe me, so I said, \u201cI have a friend here, I have to go, and\nwe have more people. I have to tell them what\u2019s going on, that the Russians are here.\u201d\nAnd I still didn\u2019t know if they believed me. I remember even I asked them -- I ask them\nto give me a star, what they have on their hearts a star, to give me a star to show it to my\nfriends that I met the Russians, because they [indecipherable]. They gave me back my\nrevolver, and they -- and I said I will go back with them. And when I went away from\nthis [indecipherable], I was sure that they would shoot me. I was sure they don\u2019t believe\nme. And in ma -- I remember when I walked, it\u2019s like I would walk on air, so that I knew\nthat I -- any second a bullet will come in. But they didn\u2019t shoot me, and I went back to\nmy friend, he was laying there in the haystack. When he saw me, he started to kiss me,\nbecause he heard the shots, and he thought that I was shot. He didn\u2019t know that I shot\nthem. And -- so we already knew that on this side are the Russians, on this side are\nGermans, so he took me -- he had the old friend, a woman -- a old woman, and he said,\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to her.\u201d And we went over to her, and we went up on the attic, nobody saw us.\nAnd in -- before -- before, in the morning, he -- we hear the door opens, and a Russian\nsoldier comes in with a -- with a pat. And he comes in, and -- and -- when we saw -- I\nsaw a Russian soldier, I jumped down. He said, \u201cI came here, there\u2019s a cow I want to\nmilk for some -- I want to milk the cow.\u201d And I grabbed him, and I dance with him. I said\n[indecipherable]. He said, \u201cYes, during the night, my unit came into this village, and we\noccupy this village, my unit is here.\u201d And he -- -- an-and we have the -- so this was the\nmoment that I knew that I am liberated, the Russians are there. Now, I went right away\nwith him. I said, \u201cAnd you take me to your commander.\u201d And I told him I\u2019m from a\nJewish group. Him, I was not afraid any more to say [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t say I was a\nJew. But Lyba, he didn\u2019t go with me. He still was afraid, he was very, very careful. He\nsaid, \u201cI will not go with you,\u201d and he was still on the attic hiding. He was hiding I don\u2019t\nknow how long, and I went out, then later I called him, and then we went to see -- this\nwas already the territory liberated, and I went to see my brother. And I came, and I saw\nmy brother sitting with his brother, but they were not any more on the attic hiding. They\nwere sitting in the kitchen with their [indecipherable], and there in the kitchen were also\nabout four or five girls, uniforms, Russian officers, because they had a field hospital\nthere, and with the fee -- and they were doctors in the field hospital, and we started to talk\nin between the -- the four or five girls, two of them were Jewish. And we told them that\nwe were li -- we were in this, and we -- we were and this was how we were liberated.\nBut, I didn\u2019t go back to my town, because I knew that if I will go back to my town, I\nwould be killed, because they knew that I killed those two Augustin brothers. That I\nkilled them in my self defense, this didn\u2019t mean anything. So, I didn\u2019t go back to my\ntown. The other two went, and they were killed, and we went on, my brother and I, we\nwent to Jheshuf, to a larger town, where Jews who were liberated, came from different\nvillages, from different towns, and they came with a guard up there. Now, Lyba and\nHerschel, the two, they didn\u2019t go with us, because they were village Jews. So they still\nremained in the village to be there living with the peasants. This was the day, the night I\nwas liberated.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, when it was -- when I saw the Russian soldiers, it was a moment of joy that I\nwas liberated. But a moment later, it was a very sad moment. And the sad moment was --\nI actually started to cry, the sad moment was, I am liberated, but what happened to my\npeople? Where are my sisters? Where are my whole family? So I am liberated, so I will\nbe fr -- see, my personal life was not so important. Important was that they were not\nalive, and specially the children. So my brother was with me. Now, I couldn\u2019t -- [ -- I -- I\nthought about the people who were killed, but I also thought how my brother feels,\nbecause he lost the same family, but he also lost a wife and three children. So he was\nmuch more in pain, because his wife and three children, which he loved very much. And\nthere were a child from 12 years, child from 10 years, and a girl from seven years. So he -\n- but he didn\u2019t talk too much about it. The pain he kept inside. And this was a very bad --\nto me, I had to go through it more. Th-the pain was when I was libera -- 1t was not a\nglorious time, because I couldn\u2019t believe that I am alive, this is the first thing. I -- it -- it\nwas like -- like my mind was someplace else. I was glad when I came to Jheshuf, if I --\nsome people survived. It was not a happy time, because everybody started to speak what\nwe lost. Now we are here, what now? What do we do now? We are single people, without\nthe family, and naturally we moved in. One of our friends was from this town, we took\nover his apartment, and we all moved in with him. We lived together because nobody had\na family. And there were two Polish women who helped them survive. So they became\nthe -- the -- the persons who cooked for us, and we lived together for a short time.",
        "A: In physical shape, I was in physical shape. The reason why I was in physical shape\nwas -- the others were not in physical shape. I was in physical shape for two reasons. The\nfirst thing is that I just came back from the AK. In the AK we had everything. When I\nwas in the woods with my gun, as a Jew, I had to -- I only could go out when it was a\nheavy rain, and blizzard, snow. I never walked out when the moon was shining. The\nmoon was our biggest enemy. So -- but then later, when I came to the AK, I was a hero.\nWhen we came to the villages, the girls kissed us, the girls brought us the most best food,\nand the people. We were heroes, we were the -- we were the same people. We wanted to\nfight the Germans the same way. So there I had a lot of food, and not -- and -- and -- and\nI was not in bad physical -- I had to dress -- I had in this time, a -- a jacket, pants. I -- I --\nI -- it was not so bad. Well, before I left for the AK, we were infested with lice\n[indecipherable]. But then I could go out, and I could wash. My brother was by this\n[indecipherable], but he was a very strong man. He was exceptional. By us, 1n our town,\nbefore the war, if somebody wanted to give an example of strength, they always\nmentioned him. He was very strong boy. Not that he was a fighter, but he was known\n[indecipherable]. So his physical was not bad. What others who survived, they came out,\nthey\u2019re like skeletons. They were laying underground for -- for a year, two years, like in a\n-- like in a -- ina grave. And th-they had a little food what somebody gave them, if they\ndidn\u2019t kill them. So mostly people came, and some couldn\u2019t even walk. They walked --\nwhen they walked, they walked like -- like on all four. They were -- because they were\nnot used to work, because they were laying in a grave for two years. And when they\nsuddenly had to go up, and to stand up on their feet, they couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no. I\u2019m not talking now concentration camps, I\u2019m talking now by\npeople who survived in hiding. I\u2019m not talking concentration camps. So where they were\nin hiding, la -- the people came out, from the first few days, where -- who were the\npeople? They were the people who were -- had some friendly -- or for money, who were\nhidden. So they came out. So we gathered in this town. Then, we didn\u2019t have yet people\nfrom concentration, because the concentrations were not liberated yet. We didn\u2019t have the\npeople who were -- survived in -- in Siberia. They didn\u2019t come yet. We had some people\nwho survived like my wife, on illegal papers, and now the Russians came out, so they\ncame, they saw Jews that they came. They still were on illegal papers. They didn\u2019t want\nto come out, because they didn\u2019t know what will go on. But they came to 1-indentify\nthemselves, but most the people the first few days, most the people were people who\ncame out from hiding.\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Well, this was not a village, it was a town. As a matter of fact, now it\u2019s a very big\ntown, and it\u2019s the head of -- the capital of a state, Jneshuf. Now, I was there --",
        "A: We lived there a few weeks. We didn\u2019t have money after we came out, so my brother\nstarted to do business, he started to make some money. And -- but ma -- with me, I\nalways wanted to fight, to be involved in the war, so I -- I went, and I volunteered. I\nvolunteered t -- it was very unusual for a Jewish survivor to volunteer, because Poland in\nthis time, nem -- organized -- the army was organized Russia, but Poland\n[indecipherable]. They took in my years -- where they -- they were born in 1920, to the\narmy, but they didn\u2019t take Jews. Not because they didn\u2019t want to take Jews, but they\ndidn\u2019t have no evidence about the Jews, they didn\u2019t know who survived, and very few\nsurvived. So actually, they didn\u2019t mobilize, they didn\u2019t draft the Jewish boys. But I\nwanted, definitely to be part of it. So -- and also, 1t happened once, it a -- it was a -- a-- a\nepisode that I went in to a barber. I have this story in the book. I went into a barber, and I\n-- I suspected everybody was a killer. Like naturally, if I would be the ge -- in Germany,\nwhen I was in Germany, I looked on everybody, and everybody I thought, \u201cWas he the\nkiller of my mother, of my sisters?\u201d But in Poland, even, they were so against our groups,\nthat they -- I suspected that the majority, they didn\u2019t like Jews. So when I went over once,\nto a barber, and there were -- there were people -- there were people sitting there and\nwaiting in line for the barber, and I looked at them, and I looked at the faces, I didn\u2019t\nknow them. So I looked at the faces, and I thought they all looked at me that they\nrecognize I am a Jew. Maybe they recognize, maybe I was not dressed the same way as\nthey. And -- and this was after I came out from -- from the woods. And -- and I -- Is -- I\nstart to think maybe I made a bad mistakes, that I came over here to this barber, and who\nknows what they will do to me? And little by little, the fear built up, in -- in -- in me, and\nwhen I t -- came my m-mind that I should go to the chair to be shaved and cut the hair. So\n-- but I went over there, and then later -- he cut my hair, and then later we star -- he\nwanted to shave, and he put in some cream, or some soap on my face, and when -- when\nhe took the -- the -- to -- to cut -- to shave me, the blade -- the razor blade -- I thought that\nI see that all the people who are sitting around the chairs, that all are winking to him, and\nthey said, \u201cNow, now.\u201d It was so the fear, this was when I came out, and -- and I was sure\nthat this what they are doing, which later I find out they didn\u2019t. But I thought so. An as --\nas he -- he was finish with the -- with the cream on my face, and he took the razor blade,\nand he wanted to shave me, he started to shave my neck, I grabbed his hand, and -- and I\nstood up, and I run out. Even my face was -- was filled with -- was -- now I run out, and -\n- and -- and -- and when I -- when I came out, and I ran a -- where we lived, and I said to\nmy brother, who was -- like I said, I am going to the army, I want to be one more day,\nbecause this gave me so much fear. Now later, I was -- when I was in this town, later I\nwas ashamed to go to pass his store, because I was ashamed what I did, because I knew\nthat this was not -- but they were sitting there, they couldn\u2019t understand why I had run\naway in the middle. But to da -- we will -- I lived with so much fear, because everybody\nwas killed.",
        "A: No, no, my brother never thought -- and don\u2019t forget, he was 16 years older, and he\nwas not a man like to join, he was not like a -- a -- advent -- to like adventuristic, what I\nam -- he -- he had a wife, with three children, they were killed. He was not -- so he was --\nhe started to do business. And then I went -- I went and I volunteered, and because I\nvolunteered, I had a choice to pick out the -- the part, which unit I want to be, and I\nwanted to be a pilot, because I thought being a pilot, I would be able to bomb German\ntowns, and to take more revenge. So because I was a volunteer, they gave me some\ncertain test, in front the whole group, a few of them were accepted to them -- to -- to the\nair force school, which was in this time in Quibishevo, in Siberia, they didn\u2019t have in\nPoland, they had this air force military school. So when -- when they picked me out, I m -\n- asked the doctor -- there was a young, Russian doctor, and I asked him how come that I\nwas -- I pass all the tests, when they were such strong Polish boys who never had hunger,\nand this and that, and they were not accepted, and I was accepted. He said, \u201cWell, this is\nthe reason, because you went through so much, and nothing bothers you.\u201d And I was\naccepted, and I was sent over a few days later, where I got orders to go -- to go to q --\nQuibishevo, which first we had to go to Lublin, where in this time was the temporary --\nthe temporary capital of Poland, and there we gathered together the whole group, I think\nit was about 400 from the whole to -- country. And then we waited for a transport to go to\nQuibishevo, to go to join this officer\u2019s school, which, there is a -- [clock chiming]. But\nthat is a other story why I didn\u2019t go, and I\u2019m writing this story that I didn\u2019t go, but I was\nin the army, and I was transferred to a different, special unit, and -- because they wanted\nthat -- I told them from where I am, so they wanted I should be in the -- in the\nintelligence, in this section, because I knew the territory, I knew the people. And I was\nsent back to Jheshuf, he ripped up the paper, this man who was in -- who was a colonel.\nHe said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t go,\u201d I was afraid that I will go to jail, that I don\u2019t go where I\nwas sent. So he said to me not to be afraid, and [clock chiming].",
        "A: It\u2019s alright. So -- so -- and then I was sent back to this town, and this is how I became\na member of this intelligent group.",
        "A: Well, when I -- no, when I joined the army -- when I went, and I volunteered, I alre --\nI took back my own identity, and I took my own identity as Naftali Salishitz, where I\nfigured the war is ended, that\u2019s it. But, when -- when I changed -- I waited for this\ntransport to this air force group, and there 1s -- it\u2019s a long story, if you inter -- I\u2019m] -- I\njust wrote an article about it. And a girl saw me there, she recognized I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a Jew,\nwhate -- and she took me to her boss, who was a colonel, and he was the head personnel\nofficer, from -- from the army. And she introduced me to him, and he said, \u201cWell, don\u2019t\ngo there.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhy you going to the air force school?\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, I want\nto learn to be a pilot, to be able to -- to bomb Germany.\u201d He said, \u201cLook, this is already\nAugust in -- in \u201944, how long do you think we\u2019re -- the war will last? Maybe it\u2019Il last a\nother two or three months, maybe a half a year. As -- the school, 1-1t would take two\nyears. After two years, there wouldn\u2019t no -- be no war. So who would you bomb? So you\nwill -- you will waste two years.\u201d He said, \u201cI will give you a better job. You want to take\nrevenge? I will put you in a unit is -- that it is that Polish inf,\u201d -- it was called information\nunit, it was like then the military CIC, and intelligence, and he said, \u201cIf you want to take\nrevenge on the Germans, then you will be -- you will have a possibility.\u201d So I said to him,\n\u201cBut I already have a order to go to -- to Quibishevo.\u201d He said, \u201cWhere 1s the order?\u201d I\nshowed it him, and he took and ripped it up. I said, \u201cWhat are you doing, I will go to\njail.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry, I know what I am doing.\u201d He was then chief\npersonnel. So he called the sixth secretary, and she said, \u201cMake him out a new\ndocument.\u201d And he said -- what -- \u201cBut he cannot be on his name in this unit. So what\nname should it,\u201d -- so I told him my name was Tadosh Yadduch in the Polish\nunderground. He said, \u201cNo, 1f you were in the Polish underground, which they are\nenemies of our government, [indecipherable], you cannot have the same name. Tadosh is\nokay, it\u2019s a first name, but let\u2019s see about the second name.\u201d So we started to think about\nthe second name, my name 1s Salishitz, so I wanted to have Salishitz spelled like in\nPolish, so then I said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s about Szaleski [indecipherable]?\u201d She said, \u201cThis is a fine\nname. You will be Tadosh Szaleski right away on the spot.\u201d They made me out a new\nmilitary book, a new document, and he called the secretary, he said to the -- to her to\nwrite a letter to the head of the Polish [indecipherable] of the Polish army in Jheshuf, and\nhe wrote a letter which it was not true, he wrote, \u201cI know this man for a long time, he\u2019s a\nvery reliable man, and I want you should give him the best opportunity. Put him in a na --\nin -- in a leader\u2019s -- in a leadership position, in a [indecipherable].\u201d And -- and this 1s how\n-- I took this paper, and I went back, and this how I remained in Jheshuf, being in this --\nin this unit. And --",
        "A: Whose name?",
        "A: Sure. His name was Gorosh. Gorosh. I know the first name also, but his name was a --\nhe was -- he was the head of personnel from the [indecipherable].",
        "A: Then --",
        "A: In my pos -- in my position, I was -- when I came back to Jheshuf, I -- I was s -- they\nprepared -- they prepared a unit -- see, this was -- this was already about, I would say in\nend of October, beginning of November. So they prepared because -- for the last\noffensive, if you know -- the last offensive, because the front was stopped about 20\nkilometer past Jheshuf, and there was the front staying there for six months. They\nprepared the new offensive, which started January the 12\", 1945, and this was the last\nputsch so -- for Berlin. And we -- I was included 1n the -- in the group -- in the group, to\ntake over towns when we -- when the offensive will go, we will liberate towns from our\ngroup, they -- our people will take over the towns, because it was not a civil\nadministration. So the army would take it over, an then later the civil administration will\nbega -- and I was assigned to take over -- one to take -- to go to Krakow, was -- Krakow\nwas the second largest town, and the most historical town in Poland, and also the -- that\ndoctor -- th-the head of the government in -- in Poland was -- was in Krakow, so I was\nassigned to remain the Krakow, and -- and to be part of the Polish intelligence in Krakow.\nAnd then the w -- in the book I describe how I met my wife, and so th --",
        "A: Yes, well, the special mission is we should take over th-the -- the running, because\nthere was not administration -- civil administration. So the army would take it over. So I -\n- my -- the special mission was, when we came closer th -- because we went with the\nRussian front, and we were attached, hundred of us were attached to the first lines of the\nRussian front, because the front started offensive like I said, January the 12\", and we\nwere attached, and we were like -- like -- not like zion officers, but we were part of the --\nthe -- the front f-fighters, but we didn\u2019t do the fighting, but we went with them, they had\nto be straightened out with the local people, with the administration, yeah. So we went\nwith them, and I am describing this in details in the book, and then when we came before\nKrakow, and Krakow was a very, very important town, because the first thing it was the\nmost historical Polish town, because the capital, it was the capital, and it was the -- the\nplace of the kings. They lived in Krakow, and also it was the barbel. Barbel is the castle\nwhere all the kings lived, and they\u2019re buried. So we find out about three days before -- we\nwere before Krakow, s -- and this was the front was going, we went with the front, and\nthey -- did the Russian army went forwards, and the German went back. So, about three\ndays before we came before Krakow, and also Krakow was not ok -- was not taken -- like\nusually in a war, you go from the -- and this time we went from the east to the west, like\nthe army didn\u2019t go from east to the west. What they did, they wanted to surround, and to\ndestroy the rush -- the German garmi zone in Krakow. So what the Russian, was a very\nsmart thing what they did, they went -- before Krakow they went to the north, and then\nthey surrounded, and they came into Krakow from the west. Because, actually, they had\nto enter Krakow from the east, but they came 1n thr -- from the west, and we went with\nthem, and we went part of it, and in about three days before we were before Krakow, we\nfind out that Krakow is mined, that they put in mines in Krakow, with columns, with\nexplosives, and the -- and in any minute, the mi -- and -- and -- and their aim is to\nexplode the town, and to destroy the whole town. We knew about it, because we had the\nfifth c-columns that they are doing it. Now -- so they wanted to -- yes, and as we came to\nthe -- closer to Krakow from the west, so the Russian engineers, if -- f-find out that they\nalready found some installations with [indecipherable], where there were important\nbuildings, but they couldn\u2019t destroy the whole thing, because it\u2019s like -- like this was the\nend. So they could dismantle all -- detach the electricity from the end of houses, but this\nwas like -- like a snake. If you cut off a piece of tail of a snake, the whole snake 1s still\nalive. We had to know that central installation from where the whole town, the electricity\nis connected. So they picked out -- they picked out three officers to go to Krakow and to\nfind out. And this was before Krakow was even liberated, and th-the Russians picked out.\nNow I -- th -- I had very good recommendations, because like I told you that this man\nwrote to the leaders that he knows me, said I am special in this, I did so much during the\nunderground, you know. And then we picked out one -- a native Krakowian, who\nsurvived the war in -- in th -- in the Russia, and later he joined the Polish army, and he\ncame back with the Polish army, and so he -- wi -- and because he was a native\nKrakowian, and so he was very important, and then we -- they invi -- they picked out the\nother men with us, so three of us, we got the order to go in to see how we can find out\nwhere the people who -- who built those things are, maybe we can prevent from the\ndestruction. And we came into Krakow, this was winter, it was very cold. Remember, we\ncame into Krakow January the 17\". The Russians took over part, but the ar -- a big part\nwas still in the German hands, because officially, the town was liberated January the 19\",\nand we were there already the 17\", through channels, and je -- and also we had people in\nKrakow who were a fifth column for us. So we contacted some, and we find out that it\u2019s\ntrue, that the Germans want to destroy, and they built, in Krakow, they built columns on\nthe main thoroughfares -- the main streets, they built columns s -- f -- a story high, with\nfour feet in diameter, filled with dynamite. Everything was connected, and everything\nhad to be blown up with one push of a button. And -- and they had also mines, the main\npost office, and the railroad station, the [indecipherable] was -- was the king\u2019s castle. All\nthe most important building, everything was mined. Were 287 mines all together in\nKrakow, and this had to be destroyed with one push of a button, and we knew that the --\nif we will come closer th -- the -- this will happen. So, we were wor -- we worried very\nmuch. And we started to have leads where finally we find out -- and again, in the book I\nwrite a little more about it, you cannot have the whole book here. We find out that the --\nthat the company who made those columns, and those mines was done by an Austrian\ncompany, Meyerader and Krauss. And the Meyerader and Krauss isn\u2019t -- the headquarters\nwas on the street Yuloushalaya, and we find out, and this was a winter night, a blizzard,\ncold, and we went -- we sent over the three to find out if -- if they -- they -- we can find\nout something. They came back they couldn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t let in nobody, because every\nplace where there was a German company, they -- and this was in the most exclusive\nplace in Krakow, where the German took over, and then the next [indecipherable] was the\nGestapo, and -- and so he ba -- by -- those places there was a iron gate, and around the\niron gate there was a concrete bunker, with openings, with machine guns, they always did\nit there, and we sent over those, and th-they couldn\u2019t go in, the three guys, so we three\nwent, said, well we will go ourselves. And before we went there, as I cross the street I\nfind out that there is a -- a-apartments, that there was the Zunderdienst. Zunderdienst was\nauxiliary to the SS, which was from ethnic Germans. And we came in, the Zunderdienst\nleft, and there were about eight girls, and the girls were cooks, and not cooks, and\npartners to sleep and all those things, well -- so we came in, and we -- we had vodka, we\ncigarettes, and a -- w -- and we became very friendly with them, and they told us about\nthis building across the street from the Meyerade and Krauss. And they told us that the\nGermans left already, about two days ago, but they left over the secretary, and she\u2019s still\nthere. So a -- I couldn\u2019t understand how comes they left and they left the secretary, a\nGerman girl. She said, \u201cYeah, she\u2019s there, because they saw her after the Germans left.\u201d\nAnd I asked them how do you know that she was German? Oh she, they know because\nshe used to come after the curfew, and she used to be -- they brought her with the cars. So\nwe did -- the two -- the three who we sent didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t go in, so we went there, and\nwe knocked on the door, and nobody let us in, and so we were ready -- this was already\nstart to be dark, so we -- I wanted to -- to open th -- the door, to shut the door, then I saw\nthat somebody\u2019s looking through the window, a young girl. So I said, \u201cLet\u2019s wait.\u201d And\nthe janitor came, he said, \u201cNobody\u2019s here, they all left.\u201d So I told him, \u201cWell, I saw there\na young girl in the window.\u201d So he saw that we know, so he said, \u201cWait, I'll bring the\nkeys.\u201d He went up, he got the keys, and we came in. So in the apartment we came, it was\nthe most beautiful apartment with oil paintings, carpets, beautiful. And there were -- and\nthere were four women, one was the daughter-in-law of the owner of the house, then\nwere two peasant girls, they were the maids, and then I s -- I saw a beautiful girl, dressed\nvery nice, she wa -- she was standing there. So I start to ask who they are, then they told\nus [indecipherable] and when I came to her, she said, \u201cWell, my name 1s Felicia\nMuirashefska.\u201d And I ask her whose apartment it 1s, she said, \u201cWell, this 1s the apartment\nthat we live, but it belong to Meyerader and Krauss,\u201d and I start to ask her more\nquestions, she got annoyed, I got annoyed, and -- and she -- I said, \u201cHow could you have\na job | -- wh-what -- do you work here?\u201d She said, \u201cI work, but thank God I don\u2019t work\nany more, because the Germans left already.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, what do you mean the\nGermans left already? You are German, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I am Polish,\u201d and\nshe showed me a kanekarta. So I said, \u201cYeah, we find out different, we find out that you\nwere German.\u201d But we questioned and questions, and -- and I got very nasty, she got --\nshe didn\u2019t cooperate. She looked at this guy, the guy who was a Krakowian, he had a very\nSemitic face, he looked like he was a Polish officer, but he looked like -- he didn\u2019t have a\nSlavic face. So she asks if -- if she can speak to him. So I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d And then -- and\nthen -- and she went with him to the other room, and she said to him, \u201cWhat are you\nbothering me, I am the same as you.\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you mean, I am the same as\nyou? I am a Polish officer, and you are a German.\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a German, I\u2019m\nPolish, and -- and besides, I\u2019m the same as you. You are a Jew, and I am a Jew.\u201d He said,\n\u201cHow do you know that I am a Jew?\u201d \u201cWell, look on your face, it\u2019s -- you can -- I can see\nyou are Jewish.\u201d And then he ask from where are you, from where are you, so he said, \u201cI\nam from Krakow.\u201d She says, \u201cFrom Krakow where are you?\u201d My wife said, and -- and\nshe\u2019s from Shtanuslabu. She said, \u201cYou know, I was in the Jewish -- in the Hebrew\ngymnasium, and there was a Jewish boy from Krakow, whose name was Oscar\nMargoulis, he went with me to the Hebrew gymnasium.\u201d And when he heard Oscar\nMargoulis, he -- he almost fainted. So 1 -- Oscar Margoulis is my first cousin. So he --\nand he asked her what happened to him, so he had the best proof that she\u2019s telling the\ntruth, and he came in, and he said to me -- he calls me in the corner, and he said, \u201cYou\nknow, this -- this pretty girl,\u201d and she was very pretty, \u201cthis pretty girl, she is not a\nGerman. She\u2019s not even Polish, she\u2019s Jewish.\u201d I said, \u201cYou are crazy. How can she be\nJewish here?\u201d So he -- and he was a womanizer, every girl he wanted to have. So I said,\n\u201cYou know,\u201d -- and Januk was his name, \u201cyou know, Januk, you are so -- if you had\nfound Eva Braun,\u201d -- you know who Eva Braun was, yeah? \u201cYou would make from her a\nJews just to have to go to sleep with her.\u201d So she said no -- he said, \u201cNo, you go and f --\nprove yourself -- you cannot -- she proved it to me, she wen,\u201d -- so I said, \u201cYeah, she\nproved it, you are even -- told them that she showed you that she\u2019s circumcised.\u201d So -- so\nthen later I started to interrogate her. And in the beginning she didn\u2019t want to cooperate,\nthen later -- I didn\u2019t want to ask her if she is Jewish, because the people -- there was the\njanitor, were there three other, and this was very dangerous, because Krakow was not\ncompletely liberated. The Germans sometimes made a [indecipherable] and they found\nthe Jews came out, and they killed them. So -- so I ask her, \u201cDo you speak other\nlanguages?\u201d She said, \u201cYes, I speak German, I speak,\u201d -- of course she spoke in Polish --\n\u201cT speak Russian, and I speak Hebrew, and I speak English.\u201d So I said, \u201cEnglish?\u201d And I\nspoke a little English. See I -- I learned English. The only time I find out I don\u2019t speak\nEnglish is when I came to the United States. So -- so I -- I remember I ask her from\nwhich nation are you, and she said, \u201cJewish.\u201d I said, \u201cHow can you prove it?\u201d She said, \u201cI\ncan speak Hebrew.\u201d So I said, \u201cSpeak to me Hebrew.\u201d She said, \u201c\u201cWa -- how can I speak -\n- I speak to you Hebrew? You don\u2019t understand what I am saying, because look in your\nface, y-you -- you -- you don\u2019t -- you look like a Polish anti-Semite.\u201d And she started to\ntell me that I shouldn\u2019t bother her. Well, [indecipherable] when she spoke Hebrew, I\nthought oh, she is Jewish, or maybe the Germans -- she\u2019s not, maybe the Germans taught\nher to speak Hebrew, and she would go out and s-spy on Jews, and -- so I asked her this\ntime, I asked her, \u201cTell me, when do Jews pray Koniterra?\u201d Koniterra, this is a prayer that\nwe pray in Yom Kippur. And without thinking, she answered Yom Kippur. Then when --\nwhen she said Yom Kippur, she started -- she stopped, and she said, \u201c\u201cWait a second, wait\na second. How do you know about Yom Kippur?\u201d She said, \u201cYou wa -- don\u2019t tell me,\u201d\nshe said, \u201cyou -- you -- you -- you -- you, too, you too?\u201d So -- and she started -- and she\nhad tears in her eyes. So I said, \u201cYes, I too, I too.\u201d And then later, so I knew that she 1s\nJewish, and she knew that I am Jewish, then I told her what I need, said I need the plans.\nShe said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me right away, I would gi -- I have the plans.\u201d And she\nwent with me to the other room, and she opened the safe, she had the safe, and she gave\nme the plans. Now also, before we went in there, now -- so we, between us, we spoke --\nwe said, \u201cWell, if we will get the plans,\u201d -- we didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s a woman, if it\u2019s a man,\nnow somebody has to kill the person, because if we got some information like this, the\nperson had to be liquidated, because in case let\u2019s say she would give me the plans, she\ncould notify her superiors that we already have the plans, and she would spoil the whole\nthing. So -- and then when we f -- when we find out there is a woman, so they s -- 1t came\n-- it fell on me, why? Because a day before we did a job, something similar like this, this\nso -- they did it, so they said, \u201cNow, it\u2019s your part.\u201d It means that I had to do it. And --\nbut when she gave me the plans, so we had the -- if she wouldn\u2019t give us -- if she\nwouldn\u2019t -- I wouldn\u2019t find out she is Jewish, I definitely would shoot her. Not -- she\nshouldn\u2019t call up her -- and -- to the -- so -- so then later she gave me the plans, and the\nplans were exactly how then -- the columns, everything. So I brought it over to the -- to\nthe Russian intelligence, which we -- we worked together, and they had the plans, so they\nsend out engineers and they -- and they did everything that it shouldn\u2019t be -- yeah,\nbecause when she gave me the plans, so she said to me -- she said to me -- so I said, \u201cI\nhave to run,\u201d took the plan, because any minute the columns will blow up. She said, \u201cNo,\ndon\u2019t worry, they wouldn\u2019t blow up, because,\u201d -- I asked her why. \u201cCause,\u201d she said,\n\u201ctwo days before, I got a phone call for the camp\u2019s commandant from Krakow, from that\ncommander in Krakow, and he ask if this 1s the company Meyerader and Krauss, I said\nyes, and -- and so he said -- he didn\u2019t ask questions, he only said, Springen zie dez oilen.\u201d\nSo detonate the columns, because before her boss left, he told her that she will get a\nphone call, that in -- they would tell her that the columns have to be destroyed. Se -- I\nmean, dek -- will be detonated. So she got this phone call, springen zie dez oilen. Now,\nhe didn\u2019t ask who she is, but she didn\u2019t -- she -- he didn\u2019t ask, s-she was not afraid in case\nshe wouldn\u2019t do it, which they will come to her. So meanwhile when she got this\ntelephone -- so she notified the Akar, the Polish underground, because she wa -- was a\nmember of the Polish underground, and she told them that -- what the telephone was, and\nshe was -- she was sure that they will come, and they will do something, but they didn\u2019t\ndo anything. And then when -- and then -- okay.",
        "A: The AK didn\u2019t do anything, they didn\u2019t tell us, and then later when we did it,\n[indecipherable], she thought it's done by the AK, but they didn\u2019t do anything. So -- so it\nwas -- it was that the columns were taking away the electricity, but the columns were\nstaying there for about four weeks til they destroyed it. And this is how Krakow was\nsaved. Actually, she was the one who saved Krakow. And then after, when I came to\nAmerica, there were films, reports, and there were about 20 different versions how this\nhappened, because everybody knew that it was prepared for detonation, and there was\ndifferent versions. There was even a book came out r -- r -- out in Russian, it\u2019s called,\n\u201cMiore Vihar.\u201d There\u2019s a Miore Vihar, a Major Vihar -- Vihar, it was [indecipherable],\nthat he did it, and that was made a film, the film was so important that it was serialized on\ntelevision. All right, a Miore Vihar was there, but he describes that he was the hero as if\nhe got the -- then was a other film, and they -- they portrayed the pope when he was a\nyoung fellow, and that the pope was the one who find out about it, and he came, he cut\nthe wires. I saw the film, the pope wasn\u2019t there. He was in Krakow, but he didn\u2019t have\nanything to do. And there were other -- other versions how it 1s, because nobody knew\nabout it, she didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t know til our book came out. When our book, \u201cAgainst\nAll\u201d sa -- \u201cAll Odds\u201d came out, so we wrowt -- write about it, so they then -- University\nAgaloinski, Agaloinion in Krakow find out about this, so they invited us we should come\nto Krakow, that I should come with my wife, but we didn\u2019t go. I didn\u2019t want to go to\nPoland. I wrote them a letter, and -- and this -- and this was the end of this episode, that\nshe actually saved -- saved the town, the most historical town from Krakow. I don\u2019t know\nif she saved it hundred percent, or she had a part in it, that 1t was not if she -- 1f she would\nsay to the camp\u2019s commandant that nobody\u2019s there to detonate, they will send over some\npeople. And you also must know one thing. Now, you would ask a question, why did the\nGerman high command call up, and that\u2019s it, and they let it go. You see, when a ger --\nwhen the army goes forwards, like the German army went forwards, there was never a\nbetter army in the world. Everything was so accurate, poom. And this was also the -- the\nproblem with the Holocaust, because they were so accurate sa -- during the Holocaust,\nthey made everything so perfect, that everything was in order. The same thing with the\nGerman army. When they went forwards towards Russia, everything was so perfect, it\nwas the best army. But, when the German army retreated, it -- it was no different than --\nit was same as the Egyptian army retreated in the Negev, you remember in the Six Day\nWar? When the Egyptian army retreated without shoes, without pants, without\nunderwear. Yeah, this is how the German army was, because when the army goes\nforwards, and specially when it\u2019s well organized like the Germans, everything --\neverything is in order. But when the army retreats, nothing is in order, no command, no --\nnobody knows what the other is doing. And for the same thing, when they left Krakow,\neverything was disorganized, there was no command, so for this reason, they didn\u2019t\nfollow up with the destruction of Krakow.",
        "A: Well, I stayed in Poland, and I became -- I became a -- a commandant of -- 0-0-over --\nfor a certain units for the county of -- of Poland -- of Krakow. Well, the -- the county,\nwhich was the town, and the county. And I stayed there from -- this where -- I came in\nactually January the 17\", and I was -- there were so many things happened during the\ntime in the beginning to organize, and the -- the community\u2019s organized a civil\nadministration and everything. And then -- so now in the new book I\u2019m writing episodes\nabout it, and I was there til -- til -- I would say til August \u201945. August \u201945, I was\ntransferred to Breslau, which became Brauslav.",
        "A: Well, in Krakow in that time, it was chaos. Everything was falling apart, and -- and we\nhad to put together that Krakow it should -- it should function. Now, we were the first\nPolish unit who came into Krakow, cause it was occupied by the Russians. And the\nPolish unit was not a big unit, and then later more came in, and we took over the\nadministration, til about two, three months later, where there was a civil administration.\nAnd -- and -- and first we had to clean out Krakow from all collaborators, because there\nwere a lot of Polish collaborators who worked with the Germans, who worked --\nespecially the Polish police, the Polish police who were in-incorporated into the German\npolice. We used to call it in Polish granna toppa policia. It means the navy blue granna --\nthe navy blue police, because they had navy blue uniforms, but this was the police from\nbefore the war, and they didn\u2019t behave so hundred percent like the Polish people desired.\nWell, there were some who belonged to the underground illegally, but the majority, they\nworked with the German -- they were collaborators. So now we had to clean out the\nPolish police which were collaborators. There were a lot of volksdeutshen. The\nvolksdeutshen lived there, and the volksdeutshen had full rights under the Germans. And\nwhen the volksdeutshen, when they were di -- discovered, naturally some of them were\narrested, some -- some were collaborators openly, and their apartments were confiscated.\nAnd this was -- this was mostly -- this was mostly the work for us. Also, the Polish\ngovernment had a big problem, because as you know, in Warsaw, in August 1944, was\nthe uprise in Warsaw. And the uprise -- the Polish people wanted to have the uprise in\nWarsaw, and to declare a free Poland wi -- go -- government. But the Russians did -- it\nwas a trick what they did, as their [indecipherable] went forwards, they were quite --\nquite successful, and when they came to the Vistula, to the east r -- side of the Vistula,\nwhich is the river, this -- the Russians stopped. They -- their excuse was that the -- the --\ntheir supply line ended, but this was not true. They stopped because the Polish people\nwanted to be very smart, and they wanted, when -- as the Russians approached Krakow,\nso they wanted to make the uprise, and the Germans were -- had involve with the Russian\nfront 10 divisions, so they figured they were busy -- busy with the Russian front, and they\nwill make the uprise, and they will establish an -- a free Poland government. But the\nRussians said well, they thought we are fighting, and they didn\u2019t want the Polish to\nestablish a free Poland, which the government was in exile in London. Se -- they wanted\nto have a Communist regime. So they stopped, and naturally then they withdrew, the\nGermans withdrew the 10 divisions, they brought them to Warsaw, and they suppressed\nthem -- their uprise, and -- and they killed 200 fighters, they killed 200 civilians. They\ndidn\u2019t kill them just like Jews, you take them to extermination camp, but they were killed\nfighting. And then they took 400 civilians, and they took them as prisoners. They put --\nput to a town there, and -- and then -- then th -- about a few months later, the Russians\nmade the last offensive, and they occupied Warsaw. So -- so -- so 1n con -- so tha -- all th-\nthe -- the -- the b -- the manage -- the big shots from the uprise, who were not killed, who\nwere not taken as prisoners, they moved the whole headquarters from the uprise to\nKrakow. And then Krakow had to be the same uprise as in Warsaw. When the Germans\nwill leave, they want to make the uprise. So they were in Krakow. So this was one also of\nthe reasons that -- about the destruction, they wanted to make destruction we -- there\nwere three reasons actually. The first reason was that they wanted to make this destroy\nbecause they were afraid for a other uprise like in Warsaw. The second reason in -- in --\nwas because they wanted to slow down the Russian approach. If the town will be\ndestroyed, so they will slow down. The third reason was because the Germans considered\nKrakow as a German town, and they cou -- like they always -- like all the scientists from\nbefore, and they always said that they were Germans, not Polish. So they considered that\nthis a Polish tow -- as a German town. And then when they -- they had to leave it, so they\n-- they didn\u2019t want to leave it [indecipherable]. They said well if we cannot have it, we\nwill destroy it. So those were the three reasons, but actually the biggest reason was that\nthey wanted to destroy the town, because they couldn\u2019t live with it that Poland should get\nthe town untouched. Because in Krakow there was never bomb, in Krakow was never the\nhouse destroyed, so they wanted to destroy the whole town. Now, would this work, the\n287 mines, Krakow would -- not one house would be left, because they -- the way they\nmined, and they put in the columns, it was the whole town would be blown up. Naturally\nwith the pe -- and people, there were hundred maybe -- hu -- hu -- thousands, and\nthousands of people would be killed. So -- so this was the reason, because the uprise had\nto be in Krakow the same way.",
        "A: Well, when -- when in this time, when I got the plans, naturally she -- sh --\n[indecipherable] our group, she was admired, and -- and then the -- I -- I was busy with\nmy -- with my things. Then one day -- yeah, the ne -- but in Krakow there was no food,\nbecause there was war, there was no food, and then she didn\u2019t have food. So the next day,\nor two days later, I took my adjutant, and -- and I -- and we had everything, so I\nremember I made the package salami, and -- and -- and -- and butter, and everything, I\nmade the package and I send it to her. And she was there with her fr -- friend, the -- the --\nthis daughter-in-law from -- from the house. And when I send it to her, she wrote an -- a\nnote, she answered she got it, and -- and -- and -- and -- and people who started to come\nout from hiding. And there were cases there I remember, there was one man, he was a\nlawyer, when he came out so that he walked like an animal, because he was two years he\nwas laying like in a grave. Somebody kept him, and he was under the floor, he was\nlaying, he only came -- they fed him, gave him something, but he never came out. And\npeople started to come out, they didn\u2019t have what to eat, because even the Polish people\ndidn\u2019t have what to eat. So she wrote me that she needs more food, she needs more food,\nso every day I raised -- see, I didn\u2019t see her -- every day I raised instead -- yesterday I\nsend her two loaves of bread, the next day I send her four loaves of bread, one salami I\nsend before, and each time I send it because I had those things. And she wrote that she is\ngiving this to people who came out. And the people who came out find out that there is\nsomebody who has food. So they came to us, and she gave them. So this went on for -- I\nwould say about -- about two weeks in the -- I didn\u2019t see her. So then one day -- one day\ni-in this building, where she was there, 1t was the most beautiful and best section, Yu-\nYushalaya, that\u2019s the -- the street, Yushalaya, 98. It was on corner Ujaneetya street. And\nthe German took over the best houses for their administration. So -- so the Polish\ngovernment started to take over th-those apartments, and one day somebody came in, and\nthey saw this apartment, was a beautiful apartment, and they took it over, and they said,\n\u201cWe confiscated apartment, you have to look for another apartment.\u201d So she notified me\nthat they taking away the -- the apart -- the apartment. So I -- I send over -- oh, I think I\ncame over in this time, and I made out an -- an -- I typed out an -- a paper that I lived\nthere, that I took over the apartment, I put it on the door. Once I put in door, nobody\ntouched it, and she could stay there. I was not staying there, but this -- so then I didn\u2019t see\nher again for a -- for a few weeks, and yeah -- and then she -- and -- and we started also,\nto arrest a lot of German volksdeutshen, and we took away their apartments and they left\na lot of stuff, the apartment, so -- so I -- I gave her a lot of clothing what I got from the\npeople, so every -- so I gave her that. About a few weeks later she came to my office and\nshe said she had to register to the army, because in her year, she -- sh -- sh -- they had to\nregister. They took women to the army, too. So -- and she didn\u2019t want to go, naturally, to\nthe army. So I gave her papers that she works in my office -- she didn\u2019t work in my office\n-- that she\u2019s occupied. So she didn\u2019t go to army, and then later I started to go out with her,\nand then each time a little more, and -- and this is how we started, and -- to go out til -- til\nwe were ready to -- to be married, but we didn\u2019t get married in Krakow, we -- I was\ntransferred to Breslau, and then she came after me to Breslau. So this was Krakow, but --",
        "A: Well -- well, I will tell you this time was very -- I -- I welcomed the time, and to be\ninvolved in it, because after going through so much, and losing everybody, and here,\nlater, life gave me a purpose. It gave me a purpose that this was Poland renewed, and like\nI told you, I always liked Poland, and -- and -- and I was important in this renewal, I was\nimportant in the rebuilding. So it gave me a very -- and I think this was one of my -- of\nthe best times, and also -- also, it ga -- instead -- instead I -- like I had to work, let\u2019s say,\neight hours. I wanted to work 16 hours. Why? Because it gave me opportunity to -- to\nlook for the people, for the collaborators, and to put them behind bars, and to do things\nthat -- that this was my dream. So I was very 1-interested. Now, my superiors liked it. My\nsuperiors liked it because I was -- I did more that they asked from me, see? An-And I\nthink I was capable in doing it, and -- and I -- each time I was praised more and more,\nand -- and -- in-in -- because I could produce more than they -- that they asked from --\nfrom me.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, no. In this time, to stay in Poland, I don\u2019t think so we intend. But we had a\nconversation between us, later, when we were in Breslau, we -- we -- we spoke between\nus, and maybe -- you see very -- you see once I -- I had this position, I always notified the\nleadership. There was a Jewish committee. There were not too many Jews c-came back,\nbut how many came back, they organized a committee. I went to the Jewish committee,\nto the president, and I told him, \u201cListen, I am a Jew. And anything you have a problem,\ncome to me.\u201d Because officially they couldn\u2019t do anything. Because officially the\ngovernment, and officially all the people who worked, in the -- even in our office, oh,\neverybody hated Jews. So I said, \u201cIf you had something to do, and if there is something I\ncan do unofficially, I will gladly do it.\u201d And they knew that I\u2019m -- a few people knew.\nAnd every time something happened like this -- specially there was one rabbi, his name\nwas -- well, anyway, I have it written down.",
        "A: Yeah, it always ca -- so -- Steinberg, Moja, he was a son of a very famous rabbi. Now\nhe -- I told him I was a Jew, and he became the rabbi in Krakow, he was not from\nKrakow, he became the rabbi, and every time something happened, he came to me, he\ntold me this. Unofficially I did it, not as a Jew, but I did it from my pos -- my -- my\nposition. And I was very happy that I could help. So -- and I was officially as a non-Jew.\nAnd -- and once I am -- we had a discussion with my wife, and we said, \u201cWell, listen.\nMaybe it is time that we should remain,\u201d we were already established. Now, she was\naccepted to the medical school, to the University of Yaggalonian. And this what she\nalways wanted to be, a doctor. Now, you are already accepted, and I have a -- well,\nimportant position. So maybe it\u2019s time that we should cut off, but not being Jewish, and\nmay -- who knows, maybe in 200 years will be another Holocaust then, and the -- and my\n-- our grandchildren wouldn\u2019t have to be killed. So we had a discussion about it, and she\nsaid no, she cannot do it, because she had a sister, and a grandmother, and uncles in\nPalestine in this time, and she wouldn\u2019t like -- she would like eventually to go to them.\nNow, with me was a different story. I -- I had family in America, but it wou -- didn\u2019t\nmean so much to me. So, to me the different story I told her, I wouldn\u2019t like to cut off\nbecause -- see, by Jews, there is a sect, we call 1t Cohamin, the priestly tribe. Now, the\npriestly tribe -- now I am -- the priestly tribe started with Aaron, the brother of Moses.\nAnd this goes on for 4,000 years. The son becomes a priest after the father, priest after\nthe fa -- and it never changes. Now I -- my father was from this tribe, and I am from this\ntribe. So I told her, said, \u201cIf this lasted 4,000 years, and I don\u2019t know how many from my\nforefathers were killed because they were Jews. My father was killed because he was a\nJew. Who knows, maybe his grandfather, his great-grandfather was killed because he was\na Jew. So who am I that I should say by me I should cut the chain, and by me to say it\nstopped.\u201d So I said, \u201cI cannot do it, because if this lasted for so many thousands of years,\nthere is something, and I wouldn\u2019t like it should be destroyed.\u201d And for this reason we\ndecided not to remain in Poland as Poles, that we have to go out, and we have to continue\nto be Jews. And naturally, our dream was to go to Palestine, we never dreamt about\nAmerica. We ne -- we wanted -- specially me, I wanted to go to Palestine because if\nsomebody would tell me that see, I was in the underground, in the Polish army, if\nsomebody will tell me that I would be in Palestine, and I would be able to fight for a\nJewish state one day, one day to have a rifle in my hand, and they will say the next day\nyou will be killed, I will always agree .That if I could fight one day for my homeland, not\nfor strangers, and then I could be killed, I would be very happy. So, we wanted to go to\nPalestine. So then there were the things -- reasons why we didn\u2019t go to Palestine, because\nyou couldn\u2019t go that j -- if you was a -- were illegal. So they took the people, they send\nthem to Cyprus, so we said we\u2019ll go to America, and -- and we will go to -- which one\nwill come first, Palestine or America, and then from America we can always go to\nPalestine. So we came to America, it\u2019s a -- and a -- and a -- but -- but --",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t Russian --",
        "A: It was Polish, Poland occupied -- Brauslov was -- Breslau was taken over Szalasia,\nthen Neederslazin, and Obershlazin, this was part of Poland. It was not -- 1-1t was not the\nRussian zone of Germany, this was Poland.",
        "A: No, we -- I escaped, no we -- I could -- special I couldn\u2019t go out because on account of\nmy position. I remember I wanted -- see, I had a very good name in my -- in our outfit,\nand -- because I did more than they -- they ask. So then later, when -- when -- when they\nstarted to organize groups to -- to go to Palestine, to fight, I wanted to -- they -- I just\nwanted to get out legally, because I didn\u2019t want to escape, because I didn\u2019t want to spoil\nmy name. So I remember there was a -- I had a friend, he was a major in the Russian\nKGB, and I went to him, and I told him, \u201cListen, I want to get out, and -- and how should\nI arrange it?\u201d And now I didn\u2019t know that he would betray me. He went to my superiors,\nand he told them that I want to get out. The next day they called me in, and there was a\nwhole -- about 10 high officers, and one said, \u201cWell, I heard you will -- you want to get\nout,\u201d [indecipherable]. So he said, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll give you three choices that you can go\nout. The first choice 1s you take a revolver, and you shoot yourself. The second choice 1s,\nif you don\u2019t like to kill yourself, we\u2019ll send you to Siberia for 10 years. And the third\nchoice is you go back, [indecipherable] march as you did today, you have to do 10 times\na march, because til now we didn\u2019t check you because we have confidence in you. But\nfrom now on, every step will be checked, every way we\u2019ll check.\u201d So I knew that -- that\nthey will have an eye on me. And then, well, we decided that we have to get out, so we\narranged to run away, So --",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s a --",
        "A: -- it was [indecipherable], it\u2019s a long story. So I managed that. I run away through\nGearlies, but it\u2019s a long story, so I run away, and -- and after I run away, my wife was\narrested. They arrested her because they thought by -- by her being arrested, I will find\nout, I will come back to try to save her, so this way they did. But, they arrested her, and\nshe claimed that I was not her husband, because we were never officially married there.\nSaid [indecipherable] he -- I was a boyfriend, we were lovers, and now we -- I run away,\nand that\u2019s it. So she was two weeks in jail, and after two weeks of jail, there was -- the\nman who was in charge, he was the head of the whole --- the army of the whole state,\nsaid -- said that he will let you -- yeah, there was a [indecipherable] of my wife, he was\nworking in the ministry, and then he went to the head from the army, he said, well he\nwants to take her out. So he said, \u201cWell, I will let her out if she will become my\nsecretary.\u201d So they let her out, and then later she escaped. But the -- those are a lot of\ndetails, details, details, but this 1s how -- how it went.",
        "A: I -- [run away to Munich. First I went out to Berlin, and I was in Berlin, and from\nBerlin, I -- see, I went -- I run through Gearlies, and then from Gearlies I went to Berlin.\nAnd in Berlin I started to work, we -- we call it here -- we called it Bricha. This was a\norganization that 1t means escape. W -- I started to work in Poland in the Bricha, so we --\nwe took Jews who wanted to escape, and we smuggled them through the border. And\nthen my job was, from Berlin, I took the groups of Jews to Munich, because I -- we\ncouldn\u2019t take them to the American zone, first I had to go from Munich. I -- I took them\nto the -- to the English zone. I remember I made th-there some acquaintances in\nAshfaiger, you know where that is? And through Ashfaiger we took them, and -- and then\nto Munich, and in Munich somebody else took over, and they took the Jews to Italy, and\nfrom Italy they smuggled them on ships, and they were caught in Cyprus. So I worked in\n-- in this Bricha a few months, then later I find out my wife came [indecipherable] my\nwife came, so -- SO we got an apartment in -- in Munich. And see, she wanted to go to\nschool, but then later we figured we have to -- we have to get out. So we registered -- we\nregistered to -- to Palestine, what I just said, to America. We said, which will be first, and\nthere we\u2019ll go. So America came first, and also, it was a very, very big problem, because\nall the DPs who wanted to come to America, hardly they could make it, because in the\nconsulate -- in American consulate in Munich, there was one woman, she was one of the\nsecretaries, and she had some friend, and they had a business. And then -- and then they -\n- an-and there was a vice-consul, and he was also a partner, and everybody who wanted\nto come in front of the consul to have the application asking questions, we had to pay her\n500 dollars. And people didn\u2019t have 500 dollars, and if you didn\u2019t pay 500 dollars, so\nthey didn\u2019t forward the -- the -- the papers. And -- and also, when they came to the\nconsul, the consul asked for birth certificates, and passports. Nobody had their birth\ncertificate, I mean they were all survivors from the camp. So nobody could -- could go.\nSo one -- and see my wife spoke quite good English, she had six years English. So in this\n-- nobody could go and do something, so one day there was the -- the then chief consul,\nhis name was Clark, in Munich, so we waited -- we waited when he came back from\nlunch, so my wife and I, we stopped him, and she started to tell him the story, that Jews\ncannot go because first they had to pay money. And the second thing, who will have an --\na passport, a birth certificate? We came from concentration camps. And she -- he\nlistened, and when he listened, I remember she explained to him everything, then later,\nafter, when we stopped talking, so he went to us, and he put the hand on our head, he was\na tall guy, yeah. So he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We need people like you in America.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cI will,\u201d -- and he gave out new orders. First thing, he fired the secretary, and he\ngave out new orders that we don\u2019t need from the concentration camps -- people in\nconcentration, those documents, only what we need is two witnesses, that they know the\nperson is from here and there, and this is sufficient. So the people started to come. Now,\nfor instance, all the German people who made applications to go to g -- to America, they\nall got visas, because they had their papers, they could come in. And mostly people, their\nhusbands were in -- in the army, in the SS, and then -- they all were welcome, so we told\nthem all those things, that they -- why should they have the priority, and after this, all the\n[indecipherable], 1t ended, then the people from the camps, they thanked us, that we made\nout that she is it -- they changed the whole law, and then we came to America.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: No, so then later when we got the visas, so we had to go with groups with -- with\nsurvivors, and we were sent to Bremenhaven. And in Bremen -- when we came to\nBremenhaven in this time was a strike, a coal strike in America, and we supposed to\nleave Bremenhaven in June, 1946, and we were in Bremenhaven six months, til the strike\nfinished, because they didn\u2019t have coal. And we -- the -- we -- the strike was finished, and\nwe started in Bremenhaven in January, 1947. So it was winter, and it was a very, very big\nstorm, and -- and it was -- the voyage was terrible, it took over two weeks, and during\nthat trip, the boiler broke in -- in the ship, it was a old liberty ship, and it took us over 12 -\n- 14 days, and it was the -- everybody was very sick, especially I was very sick that I was\n-- and also, the DPs, the -- the Jewish people didn\u2019t get the choice locations. Like, for\ninstance, the German people, who got the visas because they knew everybody, they had\nthe documents, all of them had cabins, and then they -- they had the -- the -- the ch -- the\n-- the best accommodations, but the DPs, we didn\u2019t pay for it, the Joint paid for it. So\nthey put us in, and I was in the basement, in the basement there were about 150 people\nlaying like -- like -- like rats. And my wife -- they gave them other cabins, there were 40\nwomen in one room. And I was so sick that I prayed that the ship should sink, and -- and\nI didn\u2019t eat anything, and it was -- I was terrible sick. And I figured -- and I really wanted\nthem -- we should finish [indecipherable]. Well, anyways, my -- s -- because I was laying\nin the basement, and -- so my wife, and -- she made up with the -- with the people who\nwere in her room, that she came, she put in a kerchief of my -- my head. [clock chiming].\nShe put in a kerchief, she put in a housecoat, and she practically carried me to her room,\nand I was sleeping with the -- in this room, which was much better than in the -- on the\nfloor on the basement, and we came to, after 14 days we -- the captain announced that\ntomorrow we are entering New York. And I remember the whole night, because we\ndidn\u2019t know when, all the people were so excited, we coming to America, everybody\npulled out his best suit, and the suits were made in Europe, and with big lapels, with big\nwhite hair, you know, it was the best in Europe, but it was not like America. And\neverybody got dressed to kill. And we were standing on the deck, waiting for the -- the\nStatue of Liberty. Finally [clock chiming] Fi --",
        "A: Okay, yeah. Finally, we -- we saw the Statue of Liberty, and this feeling, I don\u2019t think\nthat somebody can -- can describe this -- this feeling when we saw it. Everybody was\nstanding there and crying, cause this was all, they were all survivors, and finally we saw\nher. And everybody was nice dressed, and -- and th-this was the minutes that we waited\nfor. And we pulled into the harbor in New York, and then later we had to go down, and --\nand then in a very, very, very big hole, and all the people from -- from the whole ship,\nthere were signs like all A, B, C, and everybody went to -- to their initial, and they\nbrought in the suitcases what we had. And then as we are staying there, a man came in, a\nhusky guy with a -- with the lumber jacket. And he goes around, and then -- and he\nlooked around where the initials are, and came to S, and he goes into my wife, and he\nsaid, \u201cMaybe you know where the -- some people name of Salishitz is.\u201d She got very\nscared, and she pulled my leg, she said, \u201cWell, they\u2019re looking for us.\u201d We didn\u2019t know\nwho this is. So we were so afraid that maybe something is wrong, maybe they will send\nus back, or something. So she didn't know what to say. Then later, she said to him -- he as\n-- he ask her, \u201cDo you speak English?\u201d She said yes. So he said, \u201cSo, do you know wh-\nwhere the Salishitz is?\u201d\u2019 So she said, \u201cI am the Salishitz, and this is my husband. So\nwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong,\u201d and he grabbed her and kissed her,\nand kissed me. He said, \u201cI am Yarkey. I am Yarkey, I am the son of Risel.\u201d And Risel\nwas my father\u2019s sister, and this was her son Yarkey, who -- he became Jake in America.\nAnd he find out that -- that we are coming, so he came to -- to wait for us. And all the\npeople looked at us, they didn\u2019t know in beginning, they were afraid something happened\nbeca -- then later when they see sa -- he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to wait for a -\n- for a -- for a -- the inspectors.\u201d He called two longshoremen, they took the suitcase,\ncalled sa -- called the inspector, gave a stamp with the -- others had to open the -- the --\nthe luggage, we didn\u2019t. And he right away took us out in -- 1n the -- in the -- he took us\nout, and there was a car waiting in a place where it\u2019s -- was not allowed to park, and there\nwas my brother waiting, and they took us away. Now, what happened, I didn\u2019t know why\nhe\u2019s such a big shot, this -- this y -- uncle, he came in a -- in \u201999, said he had a\nluncheonette right near the piers, and -- and everybody who worked there, all the\nlongshoremen, all the inspectors, they all -- they all ate there. And -- and when he find\nout we have to come, so he went, and he waited for us. So it happens that I just wrote the\nstory about it, because I want to send it to his daughter. So, and then we came to\nAmerica, and -- and -- and we went to my brother, my brother took us to his house. He\nhad a house in Bensonhurst in Brooklyn. And we lived with him about -- I would say\nabout two, three we -- two weeks.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: I -- my brother left our home before I was born -- before I was born, I never saw him,\nbut in 1934 he came for a visit, and this was the only visit he came, so I saw him in 1934.",
        "A: Yes, yeah, well, naturally we talked about it, but then later, little by little it came out,\nthey -- they say well they didn\u2019t know how m -- how -- how the whole situation naturally\n[indecipherable], but 1 -- so I -- I remember there was once a lecture in a temple, and\nrabbi and all of them, they said that they didn\u2019t know how terrible -- because I ask\nquestions, like why didn\u2019t you do more, when they ask me what could we do. So I told\nthem what they could do more. So they said they didn\u2019t know about it. So I went -- the\nnext day I went to the -- th-the Jewish pi -- to the forwas that is a Jewish forwas, and I\npicked out -- they had microfilms, and I picked out microfilms from the time where we\nwere destroyed, for the time of July \u201942, August \u201942. And every day, in the re -- paper\nevery day were articles about what was going on, which came porskal -- maybe it was not\nin the New York Times, the New York Times maybe there was something on the -- on\npage 18, a piece of this, but in the forwas, there was every day in ice -- I had my -- and\nthen later, when we came to a next meeting, and when the rabbi again said so, I said to\nhim, \u201cIt\u2019s not true, because I just looked over them, and that was mentioned every single\nday.\u201d And we were very bitter, because in the beginning -- in the beginning the people in\nAmerica didn\u2019t want -- we started to tell stories, nobody wanted to listen. And if\nsomebody listened, they thought that we are -- we got nervous breakdowns, that the -- we\ntold them stories that it is not true, because how can somebody listen and imagine that\nsomebody deliberately takes six million people and kill. It\u2019s not -- and you talk about six\nmillion people like -- like a -- once I saw in the New York Times, an article on one page,\nsix million Jews were killed. In the next pages, six million stocks were sold today on the\nstock market, in the same breath. So, w-w-w-we couldn\u2019t understand how -- people\ncouldn\u2019t believe it. Not only -- you see, when the Germans killed six million Jews, if they\nwill kill the six million Jews the first day when they came in, it will be a terrible thing,\nthey killed six million people, but it will not be so terrible. The terrible thing is for six\nyears they tortured the people. They starved them, they beat them, they died from\nsickness, and all those things. Then, on the top, then finally, they killed them. Take for\ninstance the Jews who survive concentration camps. Jews were in Auschwitz, some for\nthree, four years. And then later, when the Russians were already next to the\nconcentration camp, they had to be liberated, they took them on dead marches that all of\nthem died. Being three, four years in the camp, without food, and they had to walk\nwithout clothing, in this cotton dress, without underwear, without shoes, without food.\nAnd if somebody fell down because it was slippery, even no f -- s-- strong people they\nwould fell down. The minute they fell down, he was shot. Now, the German soldiers,\nthey were all dressed in fur jackets, 1n fur coats, with heavy boots and everything, and\nthey went with them. Here they had to be liberated. So this is the cruelty. They had to --\nthey had to take them on marches to be killed. So this killing was not so terrible if they\nwould do it the first day, but after six days -- six years, to be destroyed. Take, for\ninstance, Demyjanjuk. You know the story about Demjanjuk, that he was a guard in tr -- in\nBelzyce, he was the man who operated -- and in Treblinka, who operated the gas\nchambers th-there. Now, Demjanjuk, his biggest pleasure was when they brought in the\nJews, and they were naked, and they walked through the maze, to go 1n in the dead ca --\nt-to the gas chamber, to the -- to the room. Demjanyuk and others like him, were standing\nthere laughing, and everyone -- every time when they saw a young girl, with the firm\nbreast, yeah, they went and cut off the breast, or stabbed there. Al -- it\u2019s a -- 1t was a joke.\nThey knew that in 15 minutes this person will be killed, but before the person was killed,\nthey had to stab her, they had to cut off her breast. Those are the terrible things, the\ncruelty. The cruelty was -- now I\u2019m ri -- reading a book, Treblinka, and the cruelty in\nTreblinka is that every day they brought in transports, thousands and thousands of people.\nThe people who worked there, they couldn\u2019t lift up their head, they had to run with their\nhead down. Why? Because there were special people, special Germans and Ukrainian\nhelpers, that they hit them with -- with -- with some sticks, or with some rubber hoses,\nand the minute -- and at night, when there was the appelle, when they was the roll call,\nand when they saw somebody had a sign on his face, he was taken, they called it to the\nhospital, to be liquidated. So they had to run around with their head down they shouldn\u2019t\nbe marked. So the cruelty was so terrible. It\u2019s not the killing, but now how can people be\nso cruel that you take a guard, let\u2019s say, in Auschwitz. A whole day he goes and he kills\nthe children, but he had there his wife with his children. At night he went over and he\nplayed with his children, with his dog, with his cat. Like -- like nothing happened. And\nthe next day again he went out, and he killed. There were people who went over to\nVienna for the weekends. A whole week they were staying in a concentration camp,\nkilling, killing, killing. And then for the weekend he goes home, he goes to the opera with\nhis wife. He goes to parties with his wife, he goes to dances with his wife. He enjoys his\nchildren during that weekend, and Monday morning he goes back and he kills again. So\nhow can you imagine that there are people on this world that they are not -- they are not\nhuman beings, and they are not even animals, because animals wouldn\u2019t do a thing like\nthis. But they did it day after day, year after year, kill -- they killed six million innocent\npeople. And they played around with their children, they were beautiful children. Their\nchildren were beautiful, but the Jewish children had to be killed. This is the tragedy. The\ntragedy is that how people can do things like this, and what made them do? After all, the\nGerman people didn\u2019t come out from tha -- from jungles. They didn\u2019t come out from\nunderground, this was not 5,000 years ago. Even 5,000 years ago people wouldn\u2019t do it.\nNow this was the 20\" century. The 20\" century, a nation who created a Getta, who\ncreated a Schiller, who created a Mozart, who created such -- such geniuses? How could\na nation j -- sink so low, and then later you speak to them, you sp -- I -- I feel bad I\u2019m\ntalking this to you, because --",
        "A: How could pe-people sink so low that later they don\u2019t want even to talk about it. It\u2019s a\nlittle like nothing happened. There 1s even jokes. Jews make jokes, and they live with\ntheir jokes. When Eichmann was called -- and he caught, you know, he was brought to\nJerusalem, and naturally you know what happened to Eichmann. So he said to the Jews,\n\u201cJews, what\u2019s wrong with you, can\u2019t you take a joke?\u201d For him it was a joke. Six million\nJews, this was a joke. The Hungarian Jews, 400,000, it was almost after the war, they\nknew that they will be defeated, they still had to take the Hungarian Jews, 400,000 to\nAuschwitz, and to destroy them. They knew their war is lost, why did they do it? When\nthey come to a camp, that the Russians were already shelling the camp, they had to take\nthem out, and put them in in a barn, close the doors, and put the barn on -- on -- on fire,\nand to kill them. The Russians were already there, why did you do it? Why did you have\nto kill them? People say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s only the leaders.\u201d It\u2019s not the leaders. I don\u2019t know if\nyou read Goldhagen\u2019s book. Goldhagen wrote a book, and he say -- he called it that the\nwilling -- \u201cHitler\u2019s Willing Executioners.\u201d And he described, those were ordinary people.\nThere is a other book, \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d written by -- by Bronig, and he describes it --\ndid you read the \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d no?",
        "A: Yeah, so ordinary people. Home he was a -- a -- a barber, he was a mason, then they\ntook him over to Poland, and what did they do? They were not forced to kill. If he had an\nexcuse not to be killed, they didn\u2019t do anything to him. But they wanted to show to kill\nmore, to show off for his friends. And those were ordinary people, those were not people\nwho were trained to be murderers. They\u2019re not people who were -- it\u2019s special to schools,\nlike for instance who -- in -- in Ukrainian people, there was a school in Travniki, in\nPoland, there was a camp in Travniki, and this school was a special school to teach\nguards how to be cruel in a concentration camp. And if somebody graduated from\nTravniki, he was a bigshot. What did they teach him? Teach him how to be cruel, how to\nkill. Demjanjuk was a graduate from Travniki. Now he said he doesn\u2019t know anything\nabout it, he was a victim, he was in the Russian as a prisoner. So this what we cannot\nunderstand, how people, normal people in the 20\" century, intelligent people -- now, take\nfor instance the Einsatzgruppen, you know what the Einsatzgruppen are. The\nEinsatzgruppen are, when they took over the Russian territory, they didn\u2019t send the\npeople to concentration camps. When they took over a town, the Einsatzgruppen came in,\nand they killed all the Jews. They made ditches, they killed them, women, children, old\nmen, everybody. Now the Einsatzgruppen were volunteers. This was not soldiers that\nthey said well, you have to go to the Einsatzgruppen, all volunteers. And which\nvolunteers? Mostly were graduate -- people who graduate high school, who graduate\nmusi -- in universities, who had professions; lawyers, doctors, they were 1n the\nEinsatzgruppen. Now, how can people who were educated become such murderers?\nPeople ask me now questions. What do you think about the second generation, what do\nyou think about the new generation? I said, \u201cIf the new generation knows what their\nparents did, what their grandparents did, maybe they would understand something.\u201d But\nthey don\u2019t know, because the grandparents and the parents don\u2019t want to speak about it.\nThey are quiet. Nobody was in the Einsatzgruppen, nobody was in the Gestapo, nobody\nwas in the SS. The SS was only volunteers, the volunteers in the SS. Now, people say --\neverybody say -- now I have a speech now -- everybody -- everybody says, well, this\nwhat the Nazis did, this what the Nazis did. I am very angry. I never use the word Nazi.\nAnd if you see my book, in my book you don\u2019t have once a Nazi. And I always ask that\nquestion, why do you say Nazi? There were 90 million Germans, eight million belonged\nto the party, which you can tell them, they were members of the Nazi party? What\nhappened to 82 million? So 82 million were staying home and saving Jews? What\nhappened to the 82 million? So I said, you don\u2019t have to say Nazis did it, the Germans\ndid it, with their collaborators. Nazis were in the party. Okay, some had bigger jobs, some\nhad smaller jobs, but the Germans did it. And I am very much -- every time when I go\nand somebody has a speech, and he talks borgas about Nazis, I always get up, and I\nalways say please, don\u2019t use Nazis. And I tell them why. I tell, because the Germans did\nit. In the beginning maybe there were some Germans who were against Hitler. They were\nCommunists, they were Socialists, but then later, everybody was pro-Hitler, why not?\nHitler went to ge -- to France. They didn\u2019t have cognac so much. They brought over all\nthe cognac to fran -- from France. They didn\u2019t have enough butter, they went to\nDenmark, to Holland, brought over all the butter and the cheese, and they gave it to the\npeople. They went -- they didn\u2019t have wheat, they didn\u2019t have corn, rye. They went to the\nUkraine, brought over everything from the Ukraine. They didn\u2019t have coal, they went to\nPoland, they brought over everything from Poland. So naturally the one who were against\nhim, later they became -- they were in love with him. Why? Because they had br -- butter,\nthey have cognac, they had bread, they had everything. Why? Because they took it away\nfrom the people. Money? They had plenty of money. They had special people, they called\nthem the dentists. In every concen -- d-death camp, after they killed the people, there\nwere special people, they knocked out the gold teeth, and they got tons of gold, which\nthey send it to Switzerland, and they exchange it for money. Whenever you start to think\nabout all those things, I mean, they fit, but a human being, can a human being think about\nit, that a thing like this happened in the 20\" century?",
        "A: Okay, okay.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I accuse the Jewish community also, because -- and I give you exan -- again\nexample. Now, I accuse that from all the American president, the worst president in\nUnited State was Roosevelt, because Roosevelt could do so much, he could save so many\nJews, he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t. He said -- there was a interview with Jan Karski, a Polish\nrunner from Poland what came to him, and he even describes the way Roosevelt was\nsitting. So Roosevelt was sitting smoking the cigar, and he said, \u201cAfter the war, we will\npunish the guilty, after the war.\u201d But during the war he didn\u2019t do anything. You know\nhow many Jews could be saved? The Jews were one -- th-they -- from friends, when --\nwhen it was the Vichy government that wanted to send all the Jews to north Africa, the\nAmerican government didn\u2019t let them do it. There was a cordy -- Hill, he was the\nSecretary of State. He didn\u2019t allow it, for two reasons. The first reason, he didn\u2019t want to\nannoy the Arabs, so let the Jews be killed. And then he said we could not afford -- we\ndidn\u2019t have enough trucks. They let the Jews be killed. Now, Pll give you an example. I\nhad a brother in America, my brother was here from 1920. When we were in the ghetto in\nour small town, once we received a package from Turkey, in the ghetto, and we didn\u2019t\nknow who sent the package, and di -- they delivered the package, and this was a package\nthat there were things that we never dreamt that this exist in the world. There was a can\nof coffee, there was a package of cheese, two packages of chocolate, two sar -- packages\nof sardines. So I -- sugar, everything was in this package. My mother rece -- two salamis.\nMy mother rec -- when we received it, she took the salami, she\u2019s -- put in slices, and\neverybody tried got a slice. We got this package, every -- the whole town envied us. We\ngot the -- we didn\u2019t know from where the package cames, came from Turkey. When I\ncame to America, I ask my brother, \u201cDid you ever send a package to us?\u201d He said, \u201cYes,\nthere was once in the paper, that for 15 dollars, you can buy a package in Turkey, and it\nwill be sent anyplace in Europe.\u201d So he went and he paid 15 dollars, and they sent the\npackage. I ask him, \u201cHow many packages did you send?\u201d He said one. Why one? He\nsaid, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t receive an answer that you received it.\u201d I said, \u201cWe were in the\nghetto.\u201d I ask him, \u201cCould you afford every day to send 50 dolla -- 15 dollars?\u201d He said,\n\u201cYes, business was wonderful, we did a lot of business during the war.\u201d I ask him, \u201cDid\nyou go to the theater?\u201d Yes. \u201cDid you go to the movies?\u201d Yes. \u201cDid you go during the\nwar to restaurants? How much cost a dinner in the restaurant? Couldn\u2019t you take every\nday 15 dollars and throw it out? Maybe, maybe somebody would received it. But you\ndidn\u2019t do it. You sent one package, and we received it.\u201d Imagine if we would receive\nevery day a package. Not only we, the whole family would have everything, we could\nsell it. Nobody did it. Then he, when I came over here, he cried. He had five sisters, all\nthe sisters are dead. I said, \u201c\u201cWhat did you do to save the sisters?\u201d \u201cI -- what could I do?\u201d I\ngave him 20 things that he could do. He didn\u2019t do it.",
        "A: All right, tell me a few. The first thing, before the war, when we knew already what\u2019s\ngoing on in Germany, we wrote letters, we begged him, send us an affidavit. Nobody\nsend it back. You know how much it would cost him to send affidavit? 25 cents. Why 25\ncents? He had to notarize the affidavit. If he would do work with the bank, the bank will\nnotarize it for free. If he wouldn\u2019t do work with the bank, he would go to the drugstore,\nthe [indecipherable] was a notary, and he will ask him to sign, he pay 25 cents. So for 25\ncents, he could send affidavit. He didn\u2019t send affidavit, we asked him. And the same\nthing the other family members, too. This is the first thing. They knew what\u2019s going on in\nGermany, nobody thought about bringing over somebody. They lived in freedom 1-1n\nAmerica. Af -- during the war, packages. They could pay in packages. Then the other\nthing I ask them, \u201cDid you ever think about it, you did business a lot, to go to Turkey, to\ngo to Switzerland, to go to any neutral country, and to be there, and maybe for money, to\nbribe, to give some German official money, and he could do something somebody should\ncome out.\u201d There were Jews who did it. I know rabbis who were taken out during the\ntime from ghettos, because they had followers here. They had followers in America, and\nthey went out and they bribed. Germans liked money. Fo-For -- for money you could do a\n-- the Gestapo could be bribed. I said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go, you -- you were here making\n-- making money, why didn\u2019t you go there to Turkey? In Turkey there were special\nGermans that they made arrangements. You paid them off, you could bring over the famil\n-- or some from the family. You didn\u2019t do it.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t think about it.\u201d \u201cNow you are\ncrying they are dead? Now when I survived already the war, I wrote to you -- I wrote to\nyou to send me affidavit, did you send me an affidavit? No. This was already after the\nwar. So the Joint Distribution Committee had to send me affidavit, and they paid for the\naffidavit. I had a brother here. You didn\u2019t do it.\u201d A other thing. My -- I had a -- I had a\nbrother-in-law, and he came from a ver -- from a rabbinical family. And once, in 1937,\none of the rabbis came for a visit to us. And he was his cousin. When he went back, so\nmy brother-in-law said to him, \u201cYou know, my wife has uncles, one is a doctor, one is a\ndentist, one is a manufacturer. See if they could send us the affidavits.\u201d He went to\nAmerica, and we didn\u2019t hear anything. So we -- he wrote a letter to this rabbi, he said,\n\u201cWell, we asked th -- we asked you to see the family.\u201d He said, \u201cI saw the family. I called\nthem, they didn\u2019t answer. I went to their home, and I told them the whole story, that you\nwant to come, you want to go, you are a nephew with your wife, with the children.\u201d But\nnobody did anything. They didn\u2019t say anything, and they didn\u2019t send you affidav -- only\nwhat they needed 1s affida -- and they were rich, they could do it. So you see, you ask\nabout the Jewish community, the Jewish community didn\u2019t do anything. There was only\none s -- group of the Jewish community, it\u2019s called -- oh, I -- I -- you see, I forgot the\nnames, I -- I know [indecipherable] all right. There was a religious group, they were very\nreligious Jews, and they got together -- Vadatsalla, this was the name. The Vadatsalla got\ntogether money, and they sent over a delegation, and pulled few people to the countries\nwhat I told you. And if they had outstanding Jews, outs -- Jews, I mean rabbis, they\nbrought them out from there. And they are survived, they send money. Now how come\nthe Vadatsalla, a group of religious Jews could do it, and other Jews couldn\u2019t do it? Then\nwe had here a rabbi who was in charge of Zionist organizations. Now when they find out\nfrom Switzerland that Hitler is killing all the Jews -- and they find it out, by the way,\nfrom a German industrialist in Switzerland. He came -- he couldn\u2019t take it, and he went to\nthe representative from the Joint in swi -- in Switzerland, and he told them the whole\nstory. He sent telegrams to England, telegrams to America, telegrams to Roosevelt.\nRoosevelt called Rabbi Weiss, who was in charge, and he said to Rabbi Weiss, \u201cLet\u2019s not\nrock the boats.\u201d And everything was quiet. This man told him everything what happened\nin the concentration camps, in the death camps. They said, \u201cLet\u2019s not rock the boats,\u201d and\nnothing was done. So you blame, naturally, the Germans, they did it. You blame the\ncollaborators, the Ukrainians, the Croatians, the Slovaks, the Lithuanians, the -- the\nLatvians. They all did it. But the American Jews didn\u2019t do what they supposed to do.",
        "A: The relationship of my brother was -- well, it was never a relationship like brothers,\nbecause he didn\u2019t know me, I didn\u2019t know him. But when I came, I wanted to know him,\nafter losing my whole family. But it was never -- for instance, I needed a job. I came over\nhere without money, without knowing the language, without having a trade, so I needed -\n- and also, I wanted -- my pride 1 -- was that I wanted to show that I can do something.\nNow, he had a big business, he had a tr -- a trucking business, and I asked him, after I\ncouldn\u2019t get a job, I ask him he should employ me. So his excu -- his answer was -- he\nhad a foreman, and the foreman told him -- now, he was the boss, but the foreman told\nhim well, he shouldn\u2019t give me a job, because when they will have to deliver packages to\nstores, and my English 1s not so well, so how will I deliver the packages? So this was his\nexcuse. In Poland, after the war, being 25 years, I could rose to a rank of a lieutenant\ncolonel. But here, to deliver packages, I was not good, because I wouldn\u2019t read the\naddresses. So, it was not like -- like it should have been done, but according to the other\nfamily members, he was good, because the other family members were worse. I mean\nuncles, cousins, who were Americans. I give you a -- examples. I had -- my father had a\nfirst cousin here, his name was Showel Salishitz, he became one of the largest silk lining\nmanufacturers. If somebody had a fur coat, the silk, the lining, came from his fa -- he had\nseven factories. He retired when I came, the children took over the -- the business. I went\nover to him with one uncle, I had one uncle was very nice, he was the poor uncle, he\nnever made a living. He didn\u2019t have time to make a living because everything was on his\nhead. So he went over with me, and we went over, and so it was a Sunday morning, so he\nsaid, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t own the business, my son Saul has the business. But if you will\ngo to him, he probably would give you a job, because we have 300 people working by\nus.\u201d I went over to him, was on a Sunday morning, I put in my best suit, a European suit.\nIt was not so fashionable in America, but for me it was good. I came in, and there was the\nreceptionist, a beautiful, blonde girl. And she ask me what I want. So I said to her as\nmuch as I spoke English, that I want to see Mr. Salishitz. \u201cWho should I say 1s calling?\u201d\nSo I said, \u201cTell him it\u2019s his cousin from Europe.\u201d After a few minutes she took me in. He\nwas sitting by a bis -- big desk, and I came in, I never saw him before. He ne -- he didn\u2019t\nget up, he didn\u2019t give me a cent. And he was lick -- he looked at me, he said, \u201cWhat can I\ndo for you?\u201d I says, \u201cWell, I saw you father yesterday, and I\u2019m looking for a job, and he\nis my father\u2019s first cousin, so that means we are second cousins, we have the same\nname.\u201d This was before I changed the name. \u201cSo, he said you probably could give me a\njob.\u201d He looked at me, didn\u2019t say anything, he took out his wallet. He took out from the\nwallet a hundred dollar bill. He put it on the desk, and he said, \u201cTake it and get off my\nback.\u201d When he said it to me, I couldn\u2019t answer anything. I wanted to cry, but nothing\ncame out. My eyes filled up with tears, and I looked at him, and the minute I looked with\nhim -- at him, so I imagined w -- how would we be if he would come to Poland for a visit\nwhen I was in the military? And I imagined that I would make a special review, I will\nstay on the -- on the -- on the reviewing stand with him, the army will go through, the\nmusic will play, I will salute, and I will introduce this is my cousin from America. He\nsaid -- the money was laying on the floor -- on the table. Then he said, \u201cWell, on the\nsecond thought, I will give it to the United Jewish Appeal, let them do what they want.\u201d\nAnd he took it and put it back in his wallet. I run out, and as I came in, where this\nreceptionist was sitting, I burst out, not with a cry, I burst out like with a sob, like some\n[gasps]. I couldn\u2019t cry, I couldn\u2019t [inaudible]. She said, \u201cWhat happened, what happened?\nShould I call a doctor?\u201d I said no, and I went out to the hallway, and when I staying in the\nhallway, and I was crying. I was 27 years old. A man goes through, he sees I\u2019m staying\nthere and crying, he said, \u201cHey mister, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d And I said to him, \u201cAre you\nJewish?\u201d He said yes. I said, \u201cI wish you would be in Auschwitz.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy are you\nsending me to Auschwitz?\u201d I said, \u201cWhy should my father be killed because he\u2019s a Jew,\nand you are sitting here, you have everything, and you are not being killed.\u201d And I tol -- I\ndon\u2019t know why I told him this. I was -- when I came out, I was so bitter. So he said,\n\u201cHey mister, wa -- I want to know why you\u2019re telling me this.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to\ntalk to you.\u201d Well, all those stories I have in this new book. He said to me, \u201cDo you eat\nlunch?\u201d I said no. I said, \u201cCome with me to eat lunch.\u201d I went with him, we went down to\na -- to a cafeteria, he ask me what I want, I said, \u201cNo, I will have the same thing as you\nhave.\u201d He ordered, I remember, and I will never forget, he ordered topcheese, sour cream,\nand chopped vegetable, radishes, and onions, and everything mixed up. He had it, I had\nit, it was wonderful. I a -- ate it, he said to me, \u201cDo you want a other one?\u201d I said no. He\nsaid, \u201cNow, tell me the story.\u201d So I told him the story about this. So happens that this\nman was a buyer in their company. He knew him. He says, \u201cWhat I want is you should\ngo with me up there, and you should punch this son of a bitch in his mouth, and I want to\nsee blood. Don\u2019t worry, nothing will happen to you, I will be with you.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\ndon\u2019t want to go, but the one thing I can promise you is that so long as I will live, I will\nnever speak to him again.\u201d He said -- we finished, he said, \u201cHere is my card. Come and\nsee me.\u201d But a few days later I came and saw him -- I remember his name was Louie\nSegal. See, things like this you don\u2019t forget. I came to him, and he was a converter. You\nknow what a converter, they -- they send over raw material to be dyed, and everything,\nbut anyway -- and he sold remnants. In this time I say remnants\u2019s, because there was a\nlot, 1t\u2019s remnants\u2019s. One is a remnant. I didn\u2019t know that you say [indecipherable]. So he\nsaid to me, \u201cI will give you every week a case of remnant, and will charge you what I pay\nfor it, 45 cents a pound.\u201d He gave me a address where to go and sell it. He said, \u201cYou go\nand sell it, and they will pay you three dollars 50 a pound.\u201d He could sell it, he sold his.\nHe gave me a case of remnant, I picked it up, and I went to those people. I made -- every\nweek I made a few hundred dollars. He did 1t every week. He was a stranger. Every time\nI came to him, he said, \u201cI still want you should go with me to this son of a bitch.\u201d Always\nhe said this. Then later something happened that he did something, it was not hundred\npercent, he lost all his connections, and I was out of it. Do -- yeah, so I\u2019m telling you an -\n- a episode from my family. Tell you other episodes when I came over. So my family\nstarted in what should we do -- they called me the boyjik. You know, in Yiddish you say,\na boy, a boyyik, yeah. They got together to think how they should do -- I should make a\nliving. And they brought me to a uncle whose son had the big factory from bluebell\ndungarees. You heard about blue baga -- bell -- well, a big factory. So they were sitting\nthere from the family, started to talk, then, what should we do with him. So, the first thing\nis, we have to change his name, because he cannot have a name like Salishitz, a long\nname. So the family had different names, the family -- some had Sales, some had Sallis,\nsome had Sanders, some had Saleeshi. All different names. They didn\u2019t get along with\nthem, they didn\u2019t want to have the same name. My brother\u2019s name was Salsitz, I said\nSalsitz. Now the first name. What should be -- my name was Naftali, Naftali\u2019s not for\nAmerica. Well, the name -- maybe we should make it from Nathan, for short is Nat. I\ndidn\u2019t like the word Nat, because Russia, nyet means no, everything is no. So I said, \u201cNo,\nI don\u2019t like it.\u201d Norbert, there was alread -- there was already a Norbert, because every\nbro -- see, my father had seven sisters and brothers, all of them had children the same\nage, and when my grandfather died, Naftali, everybody had his son Naftali. So one was\nNorbert, no good, one was Nolan, so Nolan. And so on, and so on. So one said, \u201cWell,\nwhat\u2019s about Norman?\u201d So I ask him, \u201cNorman?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d Nathan, Nat, what I didn\u2019t\nlike, so one said, \u201cWell, how much can he make by a name, Nathan? The most he can\nmake 35 dollars a week.\u201d So I ask him Norman, how can Norman -- oh, Norman\u2019s a\nbetter -- nice name, you can go up to 65 dollars. So I started to think in my head, I will\nlive til 80 years, and I will make 30 dollars a week more by having the name Norman,\njust for the name I\u2019m going to die a millionaire. So I said, \u201cI want to have Norman.\u201d They\ngave me Norman. So my name was Norman Salsitz. Then they said, \u201cYou have to have a\ncemetery plot. In America everybody has to have a cemetery plot.\u201d So I said, \u201cI\u2019m 27\nyears old.\u201d \u201cNo, there is a saying in America, the saying 1s, it\u2019s better to have and not to\nneed it, than to need it and not to have.\u201d They had a family cemetery plot, they sold me\nfour plots. I didn\u2019t have children. Four plots for 300 dollars, you can pay it up. I still have\nit. Four -- solda -- cemetery plot. Then later a job. The most important thing, how\u2019s about\na job? So one uncle said, \u201cWell, you know, it would be nice if he could be a salesman for\nthe company.\u201d So the others said, \u201cA salesman? He doesn\u2019t speak English, how can he go\nand [indecipherable]?\u201d Then one said, \u201cHe can be a cutter.\u201d So the other one said, \u201cA\ncutter? In the union? He will never get in the union.\u201d Then one said, \u201cA designer.\u201d Well,\nanyway, everything was the union, the union. So one uncle was smart, and a cousin, he\nsaid, \u201cWell, if he can be a machine -- a ma -- to fix mach -- yeah, a machinist.\u201d No good.\nTo fix machines he can be a independent contractor, he doesn\u2019t need the union, and he\ncan fix the machines from your factory. Wonderful. So one said, \u201cDo you know\nsomething about machines?\u201d I said, \u201cThere is one machine that I can take the machine\napart blindfolded, I can put it together blindfolded, I know this machine through and\nthrough.\u201d \u201cGood, good, is it a Singer machine?\u201d I said no. \u201cSo what kind of machine 1s\nit?\u201d I said, \u201cA machine gun.\u201d When I said a machine gun, they all got quiet, and they\nknew -- because I knew I wouldn\u2019t get the job from them. So I walked out with a new\nname, with four pem -- pr -- family plots, no job.",
        "A: Oh, with my brother.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it was my brother, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, he came about a half a year later, yeah. So -- so wait. So -- so I no job, but I had a\nproblem with my name, with my second name, with Salsitz, I have a big problem. Later, I\nwent in, I be -- I got jobs. I got, during the first year, I got about 10 jobs. Most of the jobs\nI was fired, cause I have a big mouth. S -- I wanted to tell the boss something to improve\nsomething, he said, \u201cWho the hell are you to tell me to improve something?\u201d I was fired.\nThen later I became a peddler, you know what a peddler is? I used to sell from house to\nhouse things. There\u2019s a stories about the peddler, I think. So then later I -- from peddler I\nadvanced, I sold first socks, then later dresses, t-til I became -- I sold furniture, only\nfurniture, I had a warehouse. So there was one man, he was a manufacturer of -- of\nfurniture, I remember his name was Horowitz. He had his office on Canal Street in New\nYork. So I went in, I wanted to buy some furniture. So the girl ask me down -- said,\n\u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d So I said, \u201cI -- I\u2019m Mr. Salsitz.\u201d\u2019 So the way she heard it, she\nthought I said that I am Mr. Saul Shit, because they wen -- so she calls up the man\nupstairs, and I could hear it, she said, \u201cThere is a man, but his name 1s Saul Shit.\u201d I went -\n- SO -- So I -- so she said to me, \u201cGo up,\u201d and I went up. So the man had to me -- to say --\nand I heard what she said, so she said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you, mister -- it\u2019s nice to see you\nmister,\u201d -- So I said to him, \u201cYou can call me by first name.\u201d \u201cSaul, it\u2019s a pleasure.\u201d And\neverything I wanted from this man, he did it because I told him he should call me my first\nname, so he didn\u2019t have to call me my last name, Mr. Shit. So this was -- those are the --\nthe -- the -- the -- the s -- in the beginning, what I -- I told you there are some comical\nstories, but there -- there are -- it\u2019s true stories. And -- and -- and -- and this is how -- and\nthen later, after I was a peddler, about -- about 10 years, then later I became a devel -- a\nbuilder. I got -- I got a customer, he was a Italian guy, his name was Joe Rulore, and he\nwas -- he made a small stuff, like a sidewalk. I said, \u201cJoe, everybody\u2019s a builder, why\ncan\u2019t we become builders?\u201d He never was a builder. So I said, \u201cYou know what, I will\nbuy a lot, and you put up the house.\u201d So I bought a lot to put in the first house\n[indecipherable], and we made out all right. And then later he was afraid to buy more, so\nthen later I bought land, I subdivided the land, and I had the construction company, and I\nmade all all right, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: A doctor or an actor.",
        "A: Yeah, but here I couldn\u2019t be a doctor, and I couldn\u2019t be an actor. An actor maybe I am,\nbut in my own way. So now -- so -- so I -- I did all right, and -- and I developed, and --\nand I built, and then later I took in partners. Then later, my family was proud of me. I\nmade a living, so I remember we had the family circle organization, and when I started to\nmake money, I bought my wife a mink stole. And this time a mink\u2019s -- it was the first\nmink stole in the family. So when we came to a meeting, so -- they elected me for the\npresident of the si -- family circle. You know, they took me, and they -- they went with\nme to the front. So when they said, \u201cYou are the president from the family circles,\u201d I took\noff my wife\u2019s mink stole, and I said, \u201cPlease meet the president of the family circle.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d So I said, \u201cIf I wouldn\u2019t be able to buy a mink stole, I would\nnever be a president of my family circle.\u201d They didn\u2019t like it. Okay. So -- so -- so they --\nthen later they started to say -- I started to make a good living, they said, \u201cWell, he is all\nright. He is all right. We put him on his feet.\u201d Nobody did anything, they put me on his\nfeet. So --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: A lot of them.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Mm, yeah.",
        "A: Well, because I had people who I -- who were good to me. I had people wel -- those\nwere -- you see like, for instance, my wife had an uncle here. She never knew him, in the\nend she never me -- this was a sister of her grandmother. When we came over, they\nbecame very cl -- they -- they -- they wanted to do anything for us. And they were\npractically strangers. I remember when I was a peddler, and it was before Christmas that I\nused to give out merchandise, and they paid me out two dollars a week, three dollars a\nweek. I didn\u2019t have money in the beginning. So this man came, and he brought me a\nblank check, a signed check. He said, \u201cYou need the money, make it out as much as you\nwant.\u201d I never used the check because it was not -- it was blank. I never use it. But he\ngave it to me. I mean, he gave it to me, I gave him back the check. So there were people\nwho were very -- strangers, who were very good to me, and to my wife. But the people\nthat I expect them to be good, they were not. The same thing in Poland. There were\npeople, peasants I didn\u2019t know, and they were very -- they saved my life. But the people\nwho I knew, they were not. Maybe the people who I knew, they thought that they had,\nbecause they know me, they have a right to do it. And the people who didn\u2019t know me\ndid it because from the goodness of their heart. It was me or somebody else, that they\nwould do it for everybody. But here in America, I was very, very disappointed. There\nwere some who were very nice, who couldn\u2019t do -- like for instance, I remember I had\nhere a first cousin. She\u2019s still alive. And the first cousin, I wanted to see her. I never saw\nher, because she was born in America. I know my father got gray on account of her,\nbecause she was already 32 years and she wasn\u2019t married. So here in Europe he was\nworrying -- he always -- my father, he had a habit, if he was worrying, he used to bite his\nbeard, he had a long beard. So you -- so when he start to bite his beard, so my mother\nsaid, \u201cWhat are you worried again because Frances is not married?\u201d She already knew.\nSo when I came over here, she was -- she was already married, and I was here about six\nmonths, once I called her up, and I said to her, \u201cFrances, I\u2019m here already six months, I\nwould like to see you.\u201d So she said, \u201cYeah, yeah, come over sometimes.\u201d I said,\n\u201cSometimes is no good. Today is Sunday, I don\u2019t work, how\u2019s about if I will come over\ntoday?\u201d She said, \u201cOh, today is no good, because I invited already some guests.\u201d She\ninvited guests, which she was afraid to this animal should come and introduce me? We\nwanted to meet people, we wanted to get somebody, we wanted to have friends. So she\nsaid -- when she told me -- she told me as I was in the telephone booth, because we didn\u2019t\nhave a telephone. No, well -- she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go -- let\u2019s see us sometimes.\u201d So I said,\n\u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong today?\u201d So she said, \u201cI already invited some guests.\u201d So those were the\nthings that they were -- but, like when instance my wife has a aunt from her -- the aunt di-\ndidn\u2019t stay with -- with -- with her husband, but the husband was her father\u2019s brother. But\nwhen we came, she took us in like the ga -- we would be their children. But with the\nchildren, til today we are very close. There is a son who was our age, he didn\u2019t go out on\na date if he wouldn\u2019t invite us to go on the same date. He took us the first time to Radio\nCity, to show. And all those -- every place he went. There were people, but the people\nthat you expected the most. And I have an a -- an answer for what. You see, my family,\nmy father, from the seven sisters and brother, he was the only who remained home. All of\nthem came over here in the ninet -- in the 1880\u2019s. One came -- and they were very poor.\nThey come from a village. They never saw -- they never were educated. And they told\ntheir children -- well, they children went already to college, you know, they were\n[indecipherable] they got professions. They told their children their life, how they lived in\nthis village, in the 1880\u2019s. When we came, they looked at us with the same eyes. Why?\nBecause they forgot, or they didn\u2019t know that America had a progress from 1880 to 1947.\nWe had a progress 1n our house -- in our home. Maybe not so fast as here. They couldn\u2019t\nunderstand, they ask my wife what she will do. She said, \u201cWell, I studied medicine home,\nI would like to continue.\u201d But this was out of question. She said, \u201cI can be a teacher. I can\nbe a Hebrew teacher.\u201d They showed us, \u201cYou see here hair? Like hair will grow here, so\ncan you be a teacher.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cTo be a teacher here you have to go to college.\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cI went to college.\u201d They couldn\u2019t understand this. Why? Because they knew the\nstories from their parents, and they looked at us like we would come out from this village\nin 1880. And for this reason they had a different feel. Now, for instance, I told my wife,\n\u201cWe go to America, and we\u2019ll have a lot of friends, because all my cousins are my age.\nSo we will have something in common.\u201d They never invited us to -- to go out with them,\nthey never invited us to go to a theater together.",
        "A: Yes. Mostly other -- there were some exceptions. Mostly other survivors, because we\nhad a common language, we had a common past, and everybody tells a -- mostly others --\neven til today. There are some exceptions, that they are Americans. Again, the same\nthing. We are strangers, we are outsiders. There are some that -- and some, if we started\nto make good. So some were jealous. I have a cousin, so when I had the first apartment in\nBensonhurst, I bought beautiful, new furniture, 1t was under water. And the cousin went\nto college here, and he hardly had the job. So the mother and father came to visit me, so I\nheard -- she said to with th -- to the husband. \u201cLook, look, Albert went to college. Look,\nhe\u2019s a greener, he just came. Look at his beautiful apartment.\u201d Instead to be happy that\nwe did it, and nobody gave us a penny, and they -- a lot of American people who didn\u2019t\nmake it, they look at us, and they are jealous. Why? Because we did better than they. But\nwe are mostly comfortable with survivors. We know their stories, they know my stories.\nWe know their pain, they -- in this. So mostly where we have [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, I always spoke.",
        "A: I always spoke, I never -- I never stopped, even in the beginning, people didn\u2019t want to\nlisten, I always -- I -- see, my wife didn\u2019t. I always -- some other survivors didn\u2019t. I\nalways wrote about it, and I -- I never stopped telling. Other people, even today, they say,\n\u201cWell, you know, you are obsessed with the Holocaust.\u201d I tell you a other thing what\nhappened two weeks ago. And this 1s a thing that I spoke a week later in Queens, and I\ntold the story, they couldn\u2019t believe it. I am an -- on the board of the B\u2019nai Brith. You\nknow the B\u2019nai Brith yeah? So, I am on the executive board, and we have meetings once\na week. So when we had the meeting two weeks ago -- so we started to make plans for\nthe next year for our meetings, what will be our meetings, what will be [indecipherable].\nSo one came out, and he said, \u201cWell, last year we had a meeting, we had the movie. And\nwe had a lot of people, and the people appreciated the movie. So let\u2019s have a movie next\nweek t -- next year, too. So -- so one said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll have a movie, I know a nice\nmovie by Woody Allen, from 1934, a comedy.\u201d Well, I personally don\u2019t like Woody\nAllen, he\u2019s not my type, and his comedies are not -- so there -- they started that. So I said,\n\u201cWell, instead to have a Woody Allen comedy, there is a new tape came out, I just -- I\nhave it here, about two ladies who saved Jews during the war. One is from Poland, and\none is from France. Beautiful film. It is about the Holocaust, but it is not so bloody, it 1s\nnot so depressing. But it\u2019s a beautiful -- to see what the two ladies did -- they saved. I\nhave it here. So let\u2019s have this movie.\u201d When I said this, one man gets up, he said, \u201cYou\nstop with this crap about the Holocaust. I had this crap enough. I don\u2019t want to listen to\nthis crap.\u201d First I thought crap, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s with a P, with a B, so I figured maybe\nhe doesn\u2019t like to eat crabmeat, I don\u2019t know. Later I find out it\u2019s with a P. And he started\non the crap, and crap, and crap, yeah. In the beginning, w -- I looked at him, I couldn\u2019t\nsay anything, because I was so -- I couldn\u2019t believe it. So I said to him, \u201cDo you know\nthat the Holocaust, it happened to me fif,\u201d -- [clock chiming] Okay. I\u2019m waiting for the\nbird.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Okay, now. No, no, notay. No, le -- Pll finish it. So I said, \u201cDo you know, six million\nJews were killed. It only happened 50 years ago. Survivors are still alive. What do we\ndemand from people who are not Jews, if there are deniers? 250 books were written by\nnon-Jews that the Holocaust never happened. Here, on a Jewish organization, you started\nthe story with the crap business?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat -- we suffer.\u201d I said, \u201cYou? What did you\nsuffer? You suffered? You have your parents, you have your children, you have your\ngrandchildren, they are here. Surely, you suffer, because I know you couldn\u2019t get enough\nsteaks, because steaks you couldn\u2019t buy enough, you had to eat chicken. Every day you\nhad to eat chicken. You couldn\u2019t have enough sugar, it was rationed. You didn\u2019t have\nenough toilet paper, it was rationed, so you suffered.\u201d I said, \u201cI am still alive. People are\nstill alive. It was 50 years ago, a million and a half children. And when I say Holocaust,\nyou say this is crap?\u201d I had a ver -- I almost dropped dead. Now, what gets me more -- I\nwalked out. Now, I will never go to a other meeting there. What gets me more is that\nfrom all -- there were 18 people. From all the 18 people, nobody stood up and said a\nword. Nobody. If it will be another occasion if I will be there, I wouldn\u2019t sit quiet. I mix\nin. Nobody said a word. I walked home.

        "A: Well -- well, we come --",
        "A: -- so I -- f -- 31 times [indecipherable]. So -- so I wanted to go to fight. Then I got in\ncontact -- they contact me. There was a Major Wiser, he was a major of the English army,\nand he was actually from South America, but he was in the English army. He came over\nhere, he organized a group, and he called it the George Washington Legion. And he\nwanted to have a group here to be equipped in America, like there was once a Irish army\nthat they went there. And he wanted to go with this group to Palestine, in this time before\nIsrael was a state, in to fight. And I was involved with this group, and we had me -- had\nmeetings every single week, and he, because on my background from Poland, I became\nthe head of the military police in this group, because we had to have a military police.\nWell, anyway, we had to go, and we had quite a bit volunteers, and we also had, between\n-- we had mostly Jews, veterans, but y -- we also had a few Black who joined us, who\nwent -- came up in the ran -- but we also had a few Irish. Now, the Irish veterans, they\nsaid they didn\u2019t care where they go to fight, so long it\u2019s against England. And this was\nagainst England. So it was funny. So we -- we organized it, and we had to be equipped,\nand then later the American government didn\u2019t allow it. They said we will not allow the\nequipped army to go, and it fell apart, so I started to work in the other organizations, and\nto go to Israel. And I was ready to go to Palestine in this time, and we send out in this\ntime, people individual to ru -- to go to Marseille, and from Marseille, they dropped us to\nPalestine to fight. And one, it was on a Friday I remember, and it came -- my wife knew\nthat I belonged there, but she didn\u2019t know exactly what. Friday I came, and I said,\n\u201cSunday morning, I am going. It\u2019s my turn to go,\u201d which I was very happy. So she was\nnot angry, she said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s your choice if you want to go. But one thing you should\nknow, if you go, you have no way to come back. I will not wait for you, because I lost\nenough people my family, and I don\u2019t want to have somebody else to lose. And I know if\nyou will go, you will be killed, or you will be wounded, and I don\u2019t want -- so, it\u2019s your --\nyour choice to go.\u201d Well, we had the whole day to think about it. Sunday morning the\ngroup left, and I didn\u2019t go. And I was -- now, if people will ask me -- if people will ask\nme what is my biggest regret in life, there are a lot of things that I regret, but my biggest\nregret in life is that I didn\u2019t go to Palestine to fight. If I survived the war, and I didn\u2019t go\nto Palestine, this makes me somebody -- I don\u2019t want to say a traitor, but some -- this is\nmy biggest regret. Because if somebody will tell me that I will have a choice, and a\nchance to be in Palestine for one day -- I think I told you this yesterday, if I will be --\nhave a choice to be in Palestine to fight for pa -- for a Jewish state one day, and the next\nday to be killed, I will always say that this would be my choice. Because if I could do it\nfor Poland, which I was not a first class citizen, I should have done it for Palestine, and I\ndidn\u2019t go. In 1939 -- in 1949, after we started to make a few dollars, my wife was a\nHebrew teacher, and this time they send over a group of Hebrew teachers for courses to\nJerusalem, which she didn\u2019t need it, but she went anyway. This was the first plane that\nwent with visitors to Palestine. So we went, and we went to stay there. We went to settle\nthere. The family [indecipherable] had a family, and they said, \u201cYou are in America, and\nIsrael is very bad now.\u201d People didn\u2019t have work, didn\u2019t have what to eat. \u201cSo, if you\ncome over, you -- you missed your chance, because there is no work. During the war we\ncould use you. Now, you missed your chance, there is no war, so you better go to\nAmerica, make money, send us the money.\u201d So we didn\u2019t stay there, but, I have to tell\nyou one -- this was the first trip, we were in 1949. Since then, my wife and I, we were\nthere 31 times, but I was more than 31 times, but I\u2019m say -- staying for the 31 times. The\n-- th-the time in 20 -- in 1949, when I was a -- I met then a young fellow, his name is\nLonna Guerrera. And he was in my unit, he was a captain in my unit, and then later he\nwent to Palestine, and he was -- he fought there in the war. When am -- I met him in\nJerusalem, he was a major, and he was very glad to see me, so he said, \u201cI have to show\nyou something.\u201d And he took me to a place in Jerusalem, you know, in this time\nJerusalem was divided, and he took me to a place where there was a wall, and in the wall\nyou could see new cinder blocks put in in a hole -- in the -- replaced. So he told me that --\nthat his group, they wanted to break through, and to go and to liberate the old part of\nJerusalem, but they were not enough, and more than half were killed, and the rest came\nback, and he was one who was saved, and he showed me this. When he showed me this, I\nstarted to cry. And he ask me, \u201cWhat are you crying?\u201d He said, \u201cDo you know why you\ndidn\u2019t take it in this time? Because I wasn\u2019t here. Because I wasn\u2019t here, and for this\nreason [indecipherable].\u201d So he said, \u201cWhat do you mean? We were about 80 people, and\nwhat would me -- make a difference if you would be here? You probably would be killed,\ntoo.\u201d Cause I always was the first one. I said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not only me. Because if I would be\nhere, and thousands like me, or two thousands like me, we would be able to take it. I\nwasn\u2019t here, 2,000 like me who survived were not here, and for this reason you couldn\u2019t\ntake it.\u201d So I will never forget this -- this minute, when he showed me this. And I felt\nvery -- I had very -- a big regret. Even America 1s very good for me, I have everything in\nAmerica, there is not a thing that I cannot have. But this was my place. If I survived the\nwar, from the whole family, and if I -- in Israel, had a war of independence, and I wasn\u2019t\nthere, this was wrong.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t feel Jewish -- you see, you -- the different how you feel Jewish. Now, you\nsee, I was very religious home. I am not religious now. I am not religious, I don\u2019t know\nhow far I believe, or disbelieve, I don\u2019t want to think about it, but I am not religious,\nwhy\u201d? Because, when I needed God, He wasn\u2019t there. Now, you ask a question why. See, I\ndidn\u2019t make peace yet with God. When my n-nieces needed God, He wasn\u2019t there. But\nbeing a Jew, to me, is something else. Being a Jew -- I am proud of being a Jew, because\nwe survived 4,000 years. People who were stronger than the Jews, more than the Jews,\nthey vanished. Who were on their own ground, on the [indecipherable] place, they\nvanished. Jews were not on their places, they somehow survived. Jews were sa -- were\ntortured and killed for so many places, started with the Crusaders, with the Inquisition,\nwith the Chminiski, with the pogroms, with all those things, finally with the Holocaust,\nthey survived. So for me, being a Jew is something else; that we survived. And also, what\nwe gave the world. We gave the world so much, more than any other people. The\nGermans gave the world a lot of things. They get artists, and players, and this and that.\nBut they gave also a lot of misery. We Jews didn\u2019t give misery, we Jews contributed, and\neven til today, ta -- in every field, doctors, scientists, everything you -- singers, actors,\nJews contribute, starting with the ancient times. The Jews contribute the 10\ncommandments. No other people contributed the 10 commandments. Now, if the God --\nlet\u2019s say you belo -- you believe in God. If God wanted to choose a family, and to bring\nlike the Catholics say, to bring the son for the world, who did He pick out? He didn\u2019t pick\nout the Mexican family. He didn\u2019t pick out the Irish family, or a German family. He\npicked out a Jewish family, who were very religious. And they He picked out, and there\nwas created a Jesus. I don\u2019t believe in it. I believe Jesus was a great man, but he was a\nman, that\u2019s all. He never dreamt about being a God. Because if you will tell Jesus when\nhe was alive that he would be a God, he would probably commit suicide, cause he was a\nvery good Jew. But God, let\u2019s say I\u2019m n-now saying from the sight of the non-Jews, if he\ncreate -- he w -- he picked out -- he picked out a Jew. Why? So the Jews gave the world a\nGod. 2,000 years later, look, a billion people believed in him. Did they get a thanks for it?\nNo. They didn\u2019t get a thanks, well you gave us a God. They killed the Jews for the God.\nNow, they say that Jews are Christ killers. Now, this is not true. I was interviewed two\nyears ago, and there was a question about the Holocaust, then wha -- was a t-time that\npeople ask questions, and one man asked the question, he said, \u201cIsn\u2019t there -- isn\u2019t this a\ntime to forget and forgive?\u201d So the man -- the moderator said he\u2019s going to answer it, I\nsaid no, this -- I answer this. So when I ask this man, I said, \u201cTell me, what nationality\nare you?\u201d He said, \u201cPolish.\u201d \u201cWhat is your profession?\u201d He said, \u201cA priest.\u201d So I said to\nhim, \u201cYou asked, isn\u2019t it time to forget and forgive?\u201d I said, \u201cThis happened 50 years\nago.\u201d I said to him, \u201cDo you know there was a nice Jewish young man 2,000 years ago,\nand he was killed, not by the Jews, he was killed. Did you forgot and forgive 2,000 years\nlater? Here, a million and a half childrens were killed, and you ask to forget and forgive?\u201d\nHe hung up, he didn\u2019t answer. So, this what gives me, the Jews, in every respect, in\neverything, they contributed. They contributed in Germany. You had famous writers in\nGermany. Later, they were forbidden. You have famous composers in Germany. You\nhave famous composers in Vienna. You have famous psychiatrists in Vienna, the first\ncasa -- psychi -- Freud was in Vienna, and so on. Did the Jews get a thanks for it? No.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with Mendelsohn, what is wr-wrong with Lessing? What is -- one -- and\nnow we start to -- to -- to -- to give all those a -- so this is -- and also, they were always\nheld back, they never had a place to go ahead. Thank God in America they don\u2019t --\nnobody holds them back. But they doing all the generations, they always were held back.\nBut still somebody said, \u201cJews are like quicksilver.\u201d\u201d You know what quicksilver is?",
        "A: When you try to press it down, it always runs away, it always -- the quicksilver run.\nSo the other said no. Jews is like a bamboo stick. Take a bamboo stick, you bend it down,\nit straightens out, always. And this how Jews are. For this reason I am proud to be a Jew.\nMy heritage gave to the world a lot. We\u2019re not appreciated for it. We are capable. We\ncome to a country, maybe we establish ourself better than others. Maybe we are better\nbusinessmen, maybe we think a little more. Well, there is a -- a -- a joke, and I don\u2019t\nknow if you will like this joke.",

A brain for 50 dollars, a brain for a hundred dollars, and a\nbrain for thousand dollars. They took a Russian brain, the Russian brain was -- no, the\nPolish brain, the Polish brain was the cheapest, five dollars. Then they took a Russian\nbrain, was 20 dollars. Then they took a English brain, 50 dollars. A German brain,\nhundred dollars, a Jewish brain, thousand dollars. No, I said the story wrong. I said the\nstory wrong. It was --",

        "A: -- was hundred dollars. The German was -- the Jewish brain was the cheapest, five\ndollars. They ask, why is the Jewish brain the cheapest? He said, because this is a used\nbrain, so this is the cheapest. The Polish brain was not used, so you had to pay thousand\ndollars for it. Now, I don\u2019t think so this -- so, I -- I don\u2019t know why I made the mistake,\nbut it --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, but this is -- but this is -- but this 1s -- this is what I think, yeah.",
        "A: No, because there were -- the majority of -- don\u2019t forget, when Israel -- when the\nPalestine was -- before Palestine there was 400,000 Jews, 450,000 Jews, and then later,\nwhen the people start to come in, come in, come in, there are four million Jews. So\nmajority, people who survived went to Palestine, later to Israel. And there are the\nchildren of the survivors, so there are the majority of the people who survived. So you\ndidn\u2019t have the feeling that you are an outsider. And also, when I came to Israel -- when I\nalready came to Israel, I came home. This was my home. When I came over here, and tha\n-- and we had an organization, and I gave a report, how I experienced, how I liked Israel\nin this time. So I remember I told them, I said -- they -- they say -- I had a brother in 1s --\nin Israel. Did you have a lot of friends, and how did they peer -- so I said, when I came to\nIsrael, I had friends all over, all over ma -- I went over to the massada, I had a friends, the\npeople who committed suicide, the massad -- I lived with them. I -- when I went over to\nTeberius, I had friends. In Teberius, there is the rumbum. There 1 -- there 1s old sages that\nI lived with them, I was brought up rabmaya bel harnis, I don\u2019t know if you know there is\na man that they called him the miracle man, he is buried in Teberius. I said, \u201cI came to\nthem, and those were my friends, because I was brought up with them.\u201d I was started\nsince I was three years about them. So you see, all those people were with me. I went to\nMarron, I saw the people who created the caballah, the mystic. Those were my friends.\nSo I came home to Israel, because they were there. It\u2019s the same thing like naturally, a\nChristian goes to Israel, and he walk, and he said, \u201cI am walking the same road that Jesus\nwalked.\u201d I went, and I walked the same day with -- the same road with Jesus, but not with\nthe Jesus who mi -- was made a God hundred fifty years after his death. I walk with Jesus\nwhen he was a Jewish boy, a very religious Jewish boy. So I knew all those things. I\nwalked with Mary, with the mother, that she was a Jewish mother, who lived in Nazareth.\nSo for me, Israel was home. I came home, because I knew the people. The people, I knew\nthem for thousands of years.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I -- not that I couldn\u2019t stay, because my family told me, and this time was that\ncenter -- I don\u2019t know if you know, there was a question with food, a question with war,\nand the same. If I would bring over money in this time, I didn\u2019t have money. I didn\u2019t\nhave a profession. If I would be a doctor, a carpenter, or anything. I -- I was here, I\nstarted to be a peddler. I couldn\u2019t be a peddler 1wa -- in -- in Israel. I didn\u2019t have one\nJewish customer in America being a peddler. If I -- I couldn\u2019t make a living from a Jew,\nbecause he was smarter than I was. So I had Polish customers. So what will I do in j -- in\na -- what will I do in Israel? Well, somebody who listen to this tape, they will laugh a lot.\nSo -- so -- so what would I do in Israel? I had there a family. My wife had three uncles,\nbut they couldn\u2019t do anything for me. So for this reason they said, \u201cGo back, you are a,\u201d -\n- they said, \u201cwe needed you two years ago, we needed you to fight.\u201d Which I would be\nhappy. \u201cNow, we will have two more mouths to feed. We don\u2019t have the food. Go to\nAmerica, make money.\u201d And this what I did. We went to America, my sister-in-law\nneeded help, somebody else needed help, we were always there to help.

        "A: No, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t feel commits -- you see, I lived under Communism. You see, in\nCommunism, 1t depends on which side of the fence you are. I was on the right side of the\nfence. Not that I was a Communist. I never belonged to the Communist party. As a matter\nof fact, when I had a big position, the people who were above me always came, and they\ngave out ankettas, to write down to become a member of the Communist party. And they\nalways gave me anketta, and each time the anketta had 25 questions more, always they\nadd more. And every time I g -- I -- I reg -- received a -- you know the anketta is. When I\nreceived the anketta, and they said to fill 1t out to become a Communist party member.\nThe reas -- the answer I s -- gave, I said, \u201cI am not grown enough to be worthy to be a\nmember of the Communist party.\u201d This was my a-answer, and this what they liked. I said,\n\u201cT have to learn a little more about the Communist party, I want to give an answer.\u201d But I\nnever believed, because to me, you see, I come from a very Orthodox family. I come\nfrom a rich family. Now, those two items were alien to Communism. And this was I had\nfrom my home. I give you another example -- you see, I always give you examples.\nWhen I was in Poland, I had dealings with Sappearha. Sappearha was the head of the co -\n- of the Catholic church. He was the cardinal. As a matter of fact, the pope who is now\npope, he was a prodigy of Sappearha. So I had some dealings with Sappearha. I looked\non Sappearha, he was the head of the Catholic church, I looked with him, and I feel\nterrible. Why? The Communism regime -- Communist regime was against him. What did\nhe want? He wanted to have his religion. When I looked on Sappearha, I didn\u2019t see\nSappearha there, pol -- the Catholic cardinal. I saw my rabbi by which I studied. With --\ntil 17 years I studied in the Yeshiva, you know what a Yeshiva is? I saw my rabbi, the\nvery Orthodox Hassidic Jew. I didn\u2019t see Sappearha, I saw my rabbi. Why? Because\nwould he be alive in 1945, he would be treated the same as Sappearha 1s treated, because\nhe will be -- he will represent a religion what the Communism was against, the same\nthing as the Catholic religion. So I saw my rabbi sitting there instead Sappearha. So for\nthis reason, my feelings, when it came to Communism, was different, that mostly young\npeople who embraced -- I never -- and also, my wife was always against this belief, why?\nBecause she comes from a home, and if -- her home suffered very much. Her father lost\nhis job, they threw her out in the apartment, why? Because they were considered the\nbourgeoisie. They were afraid they will send them to Siberia. So you see, the difference\nis, from where -- would I come from a very, very poor home, that we suffered, or from a\nhome that we never believed in religion, I would embrace Communism, because this\nwould be my dream. I came from a different world. So even in this time, this was the\nregime, but my aim in this regime was one -- my purpose was only one thing, to take\nrevenge. This was the only thing that I was happy with. But I wasn\u2019t happy with -- with --\nwith all the other doctrines from -- from this regime. You understand?",

I\u2019m not talking about Hitler, because he was -- nobody is above him, but\nGoebbels, I -- I would sing -- I would say that McCarthy and Goebbels were the same,\nbecause he was a man that he accused innocent people.

        "A: Well, our -- well, we wanted to have the highest values. My parenting was -- we did\nsomething very wrong, because we started to talk about the Holocaust too early. And this\npushed away my daughter, because we didn\u2019t have to start to speak about the Holocaust\nwhen she was three, four years old. Now, she always said, \u201cLook, all my friends have\ngrandfathers, I don\u2019t have grandfathers. All my friends has aunts,\u201d she doesn\u2019t have. But\nwe started to tell her stories about the Holocaust, and this was very bad, because we --\nthis was true, we -- we pushed her away from it.

        "A: Now --",
        "A: | -- I start to say, I was invited to a Catholic, Polish church, and the Polish church, it\nwas in Hackensack. And this name of the Polish is Koschumat Kobosscachins Tahoffsky.\nIt means the church of the mother -- Black Madonna of Chancetahoff. So when I came in,\nand the mother superior, they were Polish, and I thanked her, and I said I\u2019m glad to be --\nin Polish, I said, \u201cKoschulen mas -- matkabosska chanstahofsky.\u201d She said to me, \u201cYou\nknow, since the church is a church, nobody said it correct, you are the first one who said\nit correct.\u201d So then I asked her, \u201cWhat should I tell the people, should I tell them stories,\nthe real stories, or should I make it a little nicer?\u201d She said, \u201c\u2018No, tell them how it was.\u201d\nBecause I spoke -- I speak about Polish people worse than I speak about Germans, and I\nwill tell you the reason why. So when I spoke, and I told them stories about the Polish\npeople, so I thought, that\u2019s it, she will never invite me. About a month later, she calls me\nup, she said, \u201cYou know, we have a sister church in Jersey City. Would you come out\nthere to speak?\u201d So I thought it\u2019s not so bad. So -- now, the reason why I tell you what I s\n-- speak about Polish people more -- more against Polish people than the Germans.\nNobody did so much harm as the Germans, because after all, they created the Holocaust,\nthey did all the killings, they had all the ideas about extermination, about all those things.\nThe Polish people collaborated in a different way. Now, when a German went into the\nSS, or to Einsatzgruppen, or became a Gestapo man, or killed just for pleasure, he was\nraised with the idea since he was in Hitler yugen, and he knew that Jew was worse than\ngarbage, worse than a cockroach, that the Jew had to be eliminated. He was prepared for\nit. Even his parents sometimes didn\u2019t teach him, which the parents later taught him, too.\nBut he was taught in school. The Polish student was not taught to kill the Jews. The\ngovernment didn\u2019t give out directives to kill the Jews. It came from within. When it came\nto a Jew, they knew they had to hate them. So, for this reason, I have more -- not blame, I\nfeel worse when I speak about Polish anti-Semitism as hit -- as Germans. Because\nnothing is worse than the Germans, because they did that, the worst thing, but each\nindividual in Poland -- why did the Polish people have to collaborate with the Germans\nwhere he was under German occupation. The Germans killed see -- three million Poles.\nThe Poles were se -- garbage, second class citizen, undesirable, so -- so instead to have\ntwo people -- somebody said to me, your enemy\u2019s enemy is my best friend. Some -- if the\n-- 1-1f the -- if the Germans were Poles enemies, they should have -- have compassion\nwith the Jews, who had the same problem, but they didn\u2019t. So for this reason I feel --\nthere were Poles who helped, very few, small percentage. People ask me -- I go and\nspeak, they ask me, what percentage of Poles would kill a Jew -- I\u2019m not talking about\nGermans, I\u2019m talking about Poles, what percentage of Poles would kill a Jew, what\npercentage wouldn\u2019t kill, but wouldn\u2019t help, and what percentage would help? And I was\nthinking about it a long time. I came to the conclusion 75 percent of the Poles would kill\na Jew for no reason at all; giving out to the Germans, or kill them themselves. And don\u2019t\nforget, if a Pole gave out a Jew during the war, he got a kilo of sugar, or he -- he got a\nquart of kerosene. If he gave out five Jews, he got five kilo of sugar, imagine what a\nsweet life he had. 75 percent. 40 percent -- not 40 percent, 20 -- I said 23 percent -- 75\npercent would give out, 23 percent wouldn\u2019t give out, they wouldn\u2019t help. They would\nsay go away, I don\u2019t want to be involved, but they didn\u2019t give them out. We have nothing\nagainst those people; they didn\u2019t help us, but they didn\u2019t kill us. See, the pope was within\nthe 23 percent. See, I know the pope very well. I was with the pope together eight\nmonths. It\u2019s a different story. We were very, very good friends. He called me Taddek, I\ncalled him Lolek, cause Karol is the nickname Lolek. And I used to meet him two times a\nweek, and it\u2019s a different story, well. He, til today, he doesn\u2019t know that I am Jewish. He\nstill knows that I am a Pole, but this a story besides this. So 24 -- 23 percent wouldn\u2019t\ngive out: like the pope, he\u2019s not a murderer, but he didn\u2019t help. Two percent helped Jews.\nSo I read Ringenblume -- you know who Ringenblume --",
        "A: Right. He wrote, and he wrote about the same question, and he came out with the\nsame answer. He came out that 75 percent Poles will give out a Jew, or kill a Jew, but he\nsaid 24 percent wouldn\u2019t help, and wouldn\u2019t give out. Only one percent helped.",
        "A: Well, so let me answer you. One percent will give out -- will help. So I said, who is\nsmarter, I or Ringenblume? Naturally Ringenblume. A historian, a well known historian,\nand who am I? I am from a small town in Kolbushova. So I took my town as an example.\nWe were 2,000 Jews, 2,000 Poles. If I would be right, that two percent Poles saved Jews,\nso it means my townspeople had to save 40 Jews. Two percent from 2,000, right? They\ndidn\u2019t save 40 Jews. Now, Ringenblume will be right, one percent. So it means my town\nhad to save 20 Jews. Did they save 20 Jews? No. Did they save 10 Jews? No, not even a\nhalf a percent. But to give them -- to -- to how you say benefit of the doubt, I say\nRingenblume was right, one percent saved Jews. So this is why I say from where I came\nto this conclusion. I came with my town, and every town was the same. In a -- now, you\nwill ask -- you asked me this before, before it\u2019s finished I want to -- to -- now I will tell\nyou why I want to do it, and I'll do it fast. My mother, as a hobby, used to make sweaters,\nfor as -- she liked it. When there was not too much wool left, she made it very fast. And\nthey ask her, why you rushing? She said, \u201cI want to finish the sweater before I\u2019m out of\nwool.\u201d So the same thing, I want to finish it before we are out of time, we out of\n[indecipherable]. You ask me before about -- I told you that I sing a song, when I was\ninterviewed -- when I was a moderator for this history. And the person, Ray Farr, ask me,\n\u201cWhy is there anti-Semitism in Poland so strong, stronger than the other countries?\u201d So I\nsaid, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t answer you, but I will sing you a song, what I learned in school, a\nCatholic song, a church song.\u201d I re -- I remember this song, and the song has 12 stanzas. I\nwouldn\u2019t sing you -- for her I sing all the 12, for you I will only sing one. It\u2019s a beautiful\nsong, a beautiful melody, I learned it in school. And this song 1s that Jesus talks to his\npeople, to the Jews. And the song 1s -- [sings] Lo do may lo do. Sool zamchi woochi nue,\nchemyap secrotchill, Eacham zaveenue, yachem visbolue zmotza farra oana, atish\nsheshoenju, shish namare ramyoana. And this is the song. People, my people, what did I\ndo to you? With what did I trangress -- transgress against you? I took you out from the\nbondage of p -- pharaoh, from Egypt. And what did you do to me? You put me ona\ncross. The second is people, my people, what did I do to you? I brought you in in a land\nwith milk and honey. What did you do to me? You crucified me. The third one: people\nmy people, what did I do to you? I elevated you among all other nations, and you\nelevated me on a cross. And so on and so on. Now, when we learned this song in school,\nand if a Polish boy learned this song, and he goes out, and he see a Jew with a beard, he\ngoes to him, and he pulls his beard, kicks him, beats him, beats him, why? Cause they\ntaught him -- what did they tell him\u2019? The Jews killed Jesus, which is not true. And this is\nwhat I told her, from there is the anti-Semitism. And I tell you a other story. Catholics --\nthis is a story about the Puerto Rican. I had a house in Hoboken, and there were Puerto\nRicans living there. The -- the janitor was a Puerto Rican. And once I came in, he had a\nboy about 10 years. He wa -- started to speak. So he ask me, \u201cHey, Mr. Norman, you\nPolacko, you Polacko?\u201d Because they called me Polacko. I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a Polacko,\nI\u2019m a Hoodeo.\u201d I\u2019m a Jew. So the boy asked the father, and I understood what I\nunderstand, \u201cWhat is a Jew?\u201d And the father gives him a whole lesson. And I could hear\nhe gives him a lesson, Jesus, and Jesus, and Jesus, and Jesus. He told him a story about\nJesus. And after he finished the stories -- the story, the boy goes and pulls my sleeve, and\nhe says, \u201cHey, Mr. Norman, why did you kill Jesus?\u201d Because the father told him a story.\nSo he asked me why did I kill -- why I killed Jesus. So those are the stories about anti-\nSemitism. When I was a peddler, I came in, and always my customers lived on the fifth\nfloor, they never lived on the second -- on the first floor, because I had to go up, no\nelevator. So I ask him why somebody should live on the first floor. And I dragged my\nsuitcases on the fifth floor. So I come in once, and the door was open, there was a young\nwoman, she was born in America, she must be about 26 years. And the door was open,\nand I hear that she yells -- the child was crying, and she yells to the child, \u201cBe quiet,\nbecause the Jew will come with the sack, and he will take you away.\u201d This happened in\nJersey City. And then she turns around, she sees me. She was a little embarrassed. I asked\nher, \u201cTell me, why did you tell the stig -- th-the girl that the Jew will come with the sack\nand take you away\u201d? Did you ever see a Jew comes with a sack and takes away a child?\u201d\nShe says, \u201cWhy, I don\u2019t know, but my mother always used to tell it to me, and I was\nalways so afraid I stopped crying.\u201d The mother told it to her, she telled it to the child, and\nthe child will probably tell 1t to her child. And this is from where the hate, the anti-\nSemitism comes. Cause children are not born bad.",
        "A: Where, in Poland?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I -- I --",
        "A: Now some people in schools pu -- especially in New Jersey, because this is a law in\nNew Jersey that\u2019s pe -- they have to learn about the Holocaust. So the children learn.\nIndell and I go out and speak, and they have it a -- but in general, I don\u2019t think so. In\ngeneral, I think that the people say -- well, what do I have to go to strangers, when you\nhave a man on my board meeting for B\u2019nai Brith, and he started to yell, \u201cStop with this\ncrap about the Holocaust. Stop, don\u2019t bother me with this Holocaust.\u201d He\u2019s a Jew. His\nparents came from Europe, they were saved His children are, and his grandchildren -- I\nsaid, I don\u2019t think so. I think maybe -- maybe, if somebody has a interest, there are more\nbooks. But also they -- they -- you know that in the Holocaust museum last year, 80\npercent of visitors were non-Jews. Because the Jew probably figures, well, I know it\nalready. The -- the young people, I know it already. For the non-Jews, it\u2019s a novelty.\nThey want to go in to see it. But the Jew knows it already. So every time I think it will\nget weaker, and weaker. We are farther, farther away. Take for instance the Inquisition.\nYou know the story about the Inquisition., huh? How many people speak about the\nInquisition? And the Inquisition was a terrible thing. How many people speak about the\nCrusaders? Do you know that in Crusaders, 400 Jewish towns were destroyed? 400. And\nthis time in Poland, in Poland were 400,000 Jews. During the time of the Crusaders, from\nthe 400,000, 200,000 Jews were killed. Nobody knows. 50 percent. Nobody knows about\nit.",
        "A: Yes. Take, for instance, \u201c\u201cSchindler\u2019s List.\u2019\u2019 So because this was last one. Now, to me,\n\u201c\u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d so happened personally that I knew Schindler. \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d was\na very good movie for the American people. For me, it didn\u2019t even scratch the surface. It\nshowed a lot of things, but what we went through, it didn\u2019t show you w -- that -- th-the\nreal misery. But for the American, it showed enough. One thing I liked about\n\u201c\u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d and the Polish people don\u2019t like it, is there is one scene when the Jews\nwere taken to the Krakow ghetto, and when they were chased away, and they were killed,\nand isn\u2019t it -- there was a Polish girl staying there, a blond girl, and she said, \u201cGoodbye\nJews, goodbye Jews.\u201d It is typical, but the Polish people didn\u2019t like it. Then a other thing\nthey didn\u2019t like that in Auschwitz, a lot of kapos spoke Polish; they were Polish girl.\nBecause if a Polish girl was taken to Auschwitz, she got a good job. For instance, from\nmy town, there is a girl Zoshka Vinyarska Esertanay. She was in Auschwitz, and she was\nin Auschwitz not for being a Jew, she was in au -- because she was caught with black\nmarket -- black market stuff. And she was taken to Auschwitz, she became a kapo. And\nshe became such a --a -- at -- a -- a true -- for the Germans, that when she used to take\nchildren when there was an extermination job, a selection of the children, she had to take\nthe children to the gas chambers. But there were always open pits with fire, because the\ngas chamber -- the -- the crematoritums couldn\u2019t burn enough. So she used to take the\nchildren, and throw them in in the fire, alive. Now this girl came from a town from where\nI was born. After the war, so long I was in Poland, she was hiding, because she -- I find\nout about it -- she knew that if I will get her, I will kill her. She didn\u2019t know nuf -- now\nshe lives in -- in our town, openly, people know about it. Nothing happened to her. She\nused to take live children and throw them in -- in the fire. Why did she do it? She wasn\u2019t\nasked to do it.",
        "A: No. I didn\u2019t testify because the people who I would testify, they were not caught. My\nwife went to testify two or three times, because Krieger, who was the chief of the\nGestapo there ma -- I -- the people who I saw them kill, like Tvardo, I wish -- and the\nothers, Aihause, they were not caught, and I didn\u2019t testify. I was te -- I was -- I la -- I was\n-- | wrote a letter, there was one Mac, a Gestapo chief in Jheshuf, he was arrested, and\nthere was a trial, and I wa -- I -- I wrote to them and said I want to tell -- because I saw\nhim killing, but they never called me.",
        "A: Oh sure, we have organization. I am very active in the organization. We have\norganization of the Holocaust federation. I am a national executive board member, and\nwe have -- and I am very, very much involved. As a matter of fact, that every year, we\nmake, at Yom HaShoah the year, and we -- and we -- and I am doing this for 30 years.\nAnd before we used to have it in Madison Square Garden, and for the last five years we\nhave it in Temple Emmanuel. And I am in charge of the arrangement and security. Before\nthis it takes about six months to arrange it. I am with the police, with the fire department,\nwith tran -- trans -- the transit, and ever -- and a -- we have meetings, and I -- and during\nthe day I am there with the police, I arrange the security, because with the parking and\neverything. I am very much involved. We had in our organization, we had 85,000\nmembers. Now, we -- th-three years ago, we lost about seven percent, two years ago we\nlost 10 percent, and this year so far, we lost already 15 percent, because people are dying\nout, you know.

        "A: I don\u2019t think so the world learned anything, cause if the world will learn the\nHolocaust, you wouldn\u2019t have Rwanda, you wouldn\u2019t have an -- you wouldn\u2019t have -- not\nKosovo, and oh, what is the other place?",
        "A: No, no, no, we\u2019ll talk about Bosnia, and -- near Cambodia. [clock chiming] You see,\nyou wouldn\u2019t -- you wouldn\u2019t have those things, because there are -- see, Bosnia, and ka -\n- and -- and -- and -- and -- and Kosovo, it\u2019s a different subject. It\u2019s all [indecipherable] I\ndon\u2019t think so that Bosnia and Kosovo, that -- that -- that Clinton in America is hundred\npercent right, because I think they did a very, very bad thing, because of Milosevich is\nnot an angel. He 1s a strong man, but -- but he\u2019s -- what he is doing doesn\u2019t mean that\nAmerica has a right to go and bomb, and kill Kosovian civilians, Serb civilians, he\ndoesn\u2019t help the situation, and what does he do? He wants to show that this big America,\nthe rich America is stronger than the poor Serb? So what\u2019s a Serbian, nothing. A very\npoor country. So they want to show that whole European countries, they going to be\nstronger. They da -- sh -- they should be made pe -- but there were o-other ways, but not\nto go and kill, and destroy bridges, destroy their economy, destroy every -- because\nMilosevich, supposedly, is not a nice fellow. There are other people, there were ways to\ndo it. You had -- but not to go and bomb innocent people and to kill them. So what did\nthey do? They killed them. They destroyed everything. So ame -- why? Because Clinton\nwanted to get out as a hero, from being his presidency to cover up Monica\u2019s sins? This is\nnot the right thing to do.",
        "A: They s -- no, the American involvement is -- in Kosovo was very bad, because why\ndidn\u2019t America get involved in Rwanda? Now, in Kosovo, it was not the Serb\u2019s guilt. The\nKosovian, they wanted to start a rebellion, and to unite with Albania. They wanted to\nhave a large Albania, a large Muslim nation. Then later they would take care on -- on\nSerbia. One thing I can tell you, that the Serbs were the nicest people in the Holocaust.\nThe only one who saved Jews, the only one who took in and there -- Keeto took in in his\nga -- in his underground Jew -- any Jew who wanted to go in. The next in -- in command\nwas a Jewish general, Pattie, I think was his name. He was a Jew. In the Polish\nunderground you didn\u2019t accept a Jew. So the Serbs were ver -- and they were very good\nsoldiers. Germany had 10 divisions SS. In Serbia they couldn\u2019t do anything, because they\nare very patriotic. So now, America wants to show they are stronger than Serbia. Well,\nhow -- to take the American army, the air force, and to destroy Serbia? For what?\nBecause the alb -- the -- the -- the Albanese, they had in their constitution, they had, not\nin constitu -- in their rules, they had that every mon -- every week, they have to kill three\nSerbian policemen. Every week they kill a -- so they started it, they wanted to have a\nindependence. They ha -- had the underground against Serbia. So what should Serbia\nsay? Wait -- I will sit and wait til they kill us? So howa -- Serbia an-answered. And I\ndon\u2019t say that Milosevich was an angel, but the Serbian people didn\u2019t deserve it. And\nwhat did they do? Not only the Serbian, they killed the Kosovian, too, because they\nbombed kos -- Kosovo. They bombed -- they destroyed everything what they had, the\npeople with the electricity, and bridges, and everything. So I think that you cannot\ncompare it with -- with any other. Ha -- why don\u2019t America go to Tibet, and help them?\nWhy do they -- don\u2019t they go to the Kurds? There are 22 million Kurds, and they -- wh-\nwhat they are doing? America doesn\u2019t go to help them. And they have a right to do\nsomething, because they are on their land. Kosovo was never a nation. For 800 years it\nwas under Serbia. Besides, Serbia, all their religious and national things are in Kosovo.\nThe same thing as Jerusalem is for the Jews, Kosovo is for the Serbs. Now, they will go -\n- Clinton will s -- next week he will go the Jews and will say, give away Jerusalem and\neverything, if not, we going to bomb you. This is very wrong. I wrote to them, I didn\u2019t\nget an answer. So we -- so we finished already the Kosovian business.",

        "A: Well, I think that I felt right away very glad that I\u2019m in America, the minute I came.\nNaturally, in the beginning, I was very unhappy. I was glad that I\u2019m in America, but I\nwas very unhappy, and as a matter of fact, the first year, probably, I went around with ma\n-- in my mind to commit suicide, for a few reasons. The first thing, I looked around, and I\ndidn\u2019t have my family. And I expected to have a family here, a new family, but I didn\u2019t\nhave it. And then, it is very -- I know people who had this experience, maybe they will\nunderstand; you know, it is like you are on a very, big, beautiful horse, and you fall down\nfrom the horse. I was already in Poland, after the war, I have a high position, I had -- I\nwas established, I -- I ruled -- not ruled, but I -- I could do a lot of things, and people\nrespected me, and here I came over, and I was nothing. In America, later I find out, you\ncould be smart, you could be intelligent, you could do -- be a lot of things, but if you\ndidn\u2019t have money, you have -- you are nothing. And I didn\u2019t have money, and these\nthings that -- what I did in Poland, and what I was in Poland, meant nothing There were a\nlot of people who, they were thankful, I did a lot of things for them in Poland, but when I\ncame here, everything disappeared. So, of course it was such a vacuum. I came down\nfrom -- from a high position, to nothing, and I was very disappointed. And I didn\u2019t know\nwhat will be the future, what I will do. Like I mentioned before, I didn\u2019t have a trade, I\ndidn\u2019t have money, and I didn\u2019t know what to do. So I was very -- then -- then the -- the -\n- the story with Israel this appears, that I didn\u2019t go to Israel, which I wanted. And -- so I\nask my -- question myself, I said, so what\u2019s now? So a lot of times I went around with\nideas that I probably -- the best thing 1s that I should commit suicide, and the thing 1s a lot\nof times when I went in the car, and I start to think it will better when I wouldn\u2019t come\nhome alive. It\u2019s very sad that I was thinking about it then, but this -- this was the reality.",
        "A: Well, in the beginning, it was nothing -- like I said, I was glad that I\u2019m here, because\nthis was a dream that we have. But I was not so happy, because I was not in Israel. So\nthis was -- see if you a dream only to be in America, and you are in America, so it\u2019s\ndifferent. But I was here, and -- and I have plans to go with this group, I have plans to go\nwith this group, and I couldn\u2019t go, one didn\u2019t realize, and the -- with the group I couldn\u2019t\ngo, then my wife was against me going in this time when it wa -- so, it -- 1t was not this\nwhat -- what I planned. So I was in America. See, if 1n America in this time, if I would\nhave somebody from the family, and they would take me in, it was not so much as the --\nthe -- the material things that they would -- I didn\u2019t ask for them, but to be in America,\nand to have a large family, to have cousins, and to be far away from them, I didn\u2019t feel\nthe warmth, and -- and this was more important, like I thought we will have -- we will\nhave friends. And who were the friends? The friends will be my cousins who were my\nage. And -- and I was a stranger to them. So this meant a very -- it was very painful.",
        "A: Well, events that -- I would say the first events was very important, they impact when\nthey -- when I was in -- outside of the United Nation when they voted for accepting the\npetition of Palestine in this time. W -- I was there, an -- and after they voted, and it was f\n-- by very small vote that they won, and naturally outside the people started to sing, and\nto dance. So I think this was one of the most -- well, the first -- the first thing was with\nthe -- which -- arriving in -- and to wait to see the Statue of -- of Liberty. This was the --\nthe -- the very -- very emotional. And the second thing was when Israel became a nation.\nThis -- when I saw that the abba eben pulls up the Israel [indecipherable]. And I was\nthere, so this meant a awful lot, because this was a dream which lasted 2,000 years. I only\nfelt sorry that my father and my sisters are not alive to -- to live, and to see it. But this\nwas one of the -- of the most important things in -- in America. Well, then later there\nwere other things, naturally when my daughter was born. So this was one of the -- the mo\n-- because we waited a long time, and when she was born, so this was a very, very\nemotional thing.\nby talking too early, but tell me a little bit more.

        "A: She was not interested. She was not interested when I spoke, it\u2019s like I saw some\nchildren where they are a little older, that everything th -- they -- they talk about the\nmisery, and the bad times the parents went through, and -- and she -- she didn\u2019t react like\nthis. Later she explained it\u2019s because I started to talk about the Holocaust too much, too\nearly, and she didn\u2019t care for it. But then later, as she got older, so she started -- she\nrealized now -- she\u2019s still not very what -- what I would say very involved. Like for\ninstance, I have a lot of friends, and their children -- there is a movement of second\ngeneration, and she doesn\u2019t belong to second generation. I ask her a few times. And -- by\nthe way, her husband, who is a fifth generation American, he\u2019s more -- more involved --\nnot involved, but he\u2019s more for the remembrance of the Holocaust than -- than she 1s.",
        "A: No -- not that it hur -- yes, it hurts me one thing, because she doesn\u2019t remember so\nmuch -- my sisters -- an-and it hurts me because we depend on the second generation, on\nthe future generation, that the Holocaust shouldn\u2019t be forgotten. And if she is not very\nmuch involved, so it means that it will not be remembered so much. And after all, she\nfeels very bad that she didn\u2019t -- that she always cried, she didn\u2019t have a grandfather, a\ngrandmother. Like for instance, she had here a friend, she had two sets of grandmothers,\nso she always has questioned them, when they knew about it, so one set of grandfather\n[indecipherable] they adopted her. So I would like she should be more involved, because\nwe are so -- Iam so much involved, not so much my wife. I involved because I belong to\nevery organization -- Holocaust organization, and everything what has to be done, I\u2019m\nvery much involved. I\u2019m involved with the -- with the -- the money part, I\u2019m involved\nwith speaking, to go -- meetings, and all those things, I am involved.",

And as a matter of fact, when\nshe was in college, sh -- the lawyer, or the -- the -- the professor [indecipherable] said,\n\u201cYou should be a lawyer.\u201d Well she -- she -- maybe this -- she has a little bit from me, I\ndon\u2019t know. And [indecipherable] she married the husband, he 1s a medical doctor. He is\nnow assistant professor in Harvard, and he is in Beth Israel Hospital, and he is the head --\nhe is oncologist hematologist, and now he\u2019s the head -- he started to work with AIDS\nresearch, and he goes around all over the world, and they send him to have lectures. As a\nmatter of fact, he just came back from -- he was in Japan, he was in Hungary, he was --\nhe goes over -- and they have to go now, in about a month, they have to go to Portugal.\nAnd he\u2019s also now a member of the Food and Drug industry; he goes once a month to\nWashington, because when they have a new drug, that has to be approved. So he is very\ndedicated to it, and in the beginning we were a little worried that he picked out the AIDS,\nbut he wants it because h-he\u2019s a idealist. He\u2019s -- he\u2019s very much involved in it. And we --\nthe beginning we were wor -- worried a little because we thought that doctors, contagious\nthis, but now it\u2019s -- it changed a lot. An-And -- and he -- he\u2019s happy, and he likes it, and -\n- and now -- we want he should be for -- he shouldn\u2019t be in that hospital, because if he\nwill be a private doctor, he could make much more money. But he doesn\u2019t care about the\nmoney. So --",
        "A: Yeah, I have three -- three grandchildren. And this was also one of the highlights of\nour life. When the first one was born, he was born in -- about three years after she was\nmarried. She was married -- my daughter was married in -- in -- it was just 22\"\nanniversary for her. So her d -- Dustin is now 16 and a half years old. He 1s the oldest\none. Then she has one, he is Arlen. Arlen is 11 years old. And then she has one, he is\nMichael. And Michael is -- is nine years old, yeah.",
        "A: Well, you see, we -- our -- for instance by us, everything what is tradition, I keep up.\nIt\u2019s not observant. We don\u2019t have kosher, and we don\u2019t do serf shab -- the Shema\nShabbas as we call it. But w -- it\u2019s more like -- like everything traditional, every national\nholiday, and -- so -- well a -- so -- but se -- m-my wife, she doesn\u2019t come from such a\nhome. She comes from a home that -- see, in Europe, everybody was -- was religious.",
        "A: N -- Ino --",
        "A: So, w -- everything what is traditional, I w -- as you can see upstairs -- you didn\u2019t see\nit, Ihave like an Jewish museum. Everything what has a Jewish character I buy, and I like\nto collect. And I have certain things that they are so unique, that it\u2019s probably the one in\nthe world. And if you are interested, I can explain to you, I can show it to you. And so, if\nI have guests, like for instance Saturdays we don\u2019t make the observance like it should be,\nbut if I have guests for this, I do it. See, I know how to do it, [indecipherable] because\nlike I said, til 17 years I started, and I don\u2019t know if you'll say to be a rabbi, or to what,\nbut I -- we were very, very in-involved in it. So -- but now, after the war, n -- everything\nwhat has to do with the connection, with -- with the -- with the God, we let it go a little\nbit, because we each were asking a question, and we don\u2019t have answers. My daughter for\ninstance -- and my daughter is more observant than we are. And -- like for instance, every\nFriday night, and -- she lights the candles, and her children come, and everyone has to\nwear a kippah, and then they say the blessings, and they sing what they have to do. Also\nbecause they go to Solomon Shechter, which is a religious Jew telly school, and they go\npartly to Solomon Shechter, because I pay for it. And I said to them if they will go to\nSolomon Shechter, I would pay, and this is quite expensive, because -- because it cost\nalmost 10,000 dollars a year for each one. Now, her husband, for instance, comes from a\nhouse that they didn\u2019t know too much about Judaism. Now, her husband\u2019s parents, like\nfor instance his father\u2019s siblings, they all married por -- Protestants. His mother\u2019s ma --\nfamily married Catholics. So -- but none of them married Jews -- well, one maybe\nmarried Jews. So her husband, because he was afraid that with them the Jewish tradition,\neverything would get lost, so he became more Jewish. And he did it himself, he asked for\nit, and as a matter of fact, in his sophomore year he went to Israel, and he went for a year\nto Israel, but he didn\u2019t go on the English faculty -- English part, but the Hebrew. And he\nspeaks perfect Hebrew. He ri -- and he gets all the Hebrew newspapers, and he\u2019s very\nmuch involved with Israel. The oldest son, til he was three years, he spoke to him only\nHebrew, because he -- he thought English he would learn anyway. So they are very much\n-- they belong to a temple, and with the children they go to temple. Now, for instance, the\nIsraeli government sends over certain people, and -- for a year to be on Harvard, or in\nMIT. So there are certain families that they adopt a family for a year, so they adopt every\nyear a family. And they stay with them Saturdays, holidays, because it\u2019s ver -- and they\nwere a few times, like for instance the oldest boy went yesterday to Israel, and he\u2019s 16\nand a half, and there is a group. It\u2019s called gesh -- Geshert. So they -- it\u2019s -- it 1s like they\nare part with the milit -- military part. They go there for six weeks, and then they travel.\nSo he went with the group, they went about 150 American -- 50 were boys, hundred were\ngirls, and their age, and they went there, which we agree to what they should go. And it 1s\nvery important.",
        "A: Well, I --",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I -- the activities, like for instance, I organized, 30 years ago, a chapter here\nfrom Mogandube tadome, Mogandube tadome, as they say the Red Cross, and fo-for 30\nyears I\u2019m the president. I\u2019m trying to give it to somebody, there is nobody who will --\ntakes it. And we are a member from the national, and we went a few times with them to\nIsrael, and now it starts to go down, like all Jewish organizations, and the new people\ndon\u2019t go in, and old people dying out, and I say that my members -- I used to have a few\nhundred members in this chapter, now I have very little, so I said all the members, or they\ngo up, or they go down. So they said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said, \u201cOh, they go down to\nFlorida, or they go up to heaven.\u201d And this is mostly what -- what happened, the new\npeople doesn\u2019t come in. Also, I organized Gimmilis hassoudim organization, it m -- 1s a\nfree loan society. This was after I came to America, so I started to organize with the --\nwith the people here, and we took a -- collected money, we send it to Israel. And in this\ntime the people were very poor, and everybody had a chance to loan -- to take a loan,\nthen they paid it out in a year, and two years, and they got back. So this 1s still there -- al -\n- existing. My -- this was the [indecipherable] that mis -- the people from my town have\nit. So then I belong to a lot of organization, like I organized in our temple a Israel bond\ndrive, and the -- the UGA drive. I was, for about seven years, the chairman of Israel\nbonds for Essex county religious council, and -- and I -- I always was involved in -- in --\nin -- in all kind of -- of charitable organizations.",
        "A: No, no. I -- I -- well, people started to know about me, so one from the others, and I\nwill say in the last 10 years. So I go public schools, high schools, and sometimes not\nJewish high schools. And I also spoke right in Princeton. They invited me, I spoke in\nHarvard. And I spoke in -- in -- in Connecticut they have Notre Dame University. And\nthis was very important for me, because they were not Jews there. And -- and there is\neven it\u2019s not a anecdote, 1s when I came to Notre Dame, they invited me there for a day,\nbut they kept me there for three days, because when the -- this is a Jesuit school, and they\nare dressed like priests. So when they introduced me to the headmaster, and he had a\nbook under his arm, that he had the book, so he had the book, the \u201cJewish Boyhood in\nPoland,\u201d my book. So I was very pleased, I said, \u201cOh, you got the book because I came to\nspeak here?\u201d He said, \u201cNo.\u201d So I said, \u201cDo you know whose book this is?\u201d He said,\n\u201cNo.\u201d \u201cSo how comes you have the book?\u201d He said to me, \u201cI just came from\nWashington, from the museum, and I saw this book, and I saw that the book is, \u201cA\nJewish Boyhood in Poland, Remembering Kolbushova,\u201d my town. So happens that my\ngrandfather came from Kolbushova.\u201d So he brought the book. So he told me his name, I\nremem -- so I remember his grandfather, and he -- his father came to America, he was\nborn here, and he is the head of the Notre Dame University. So instead one day, he kept\nme there three days. And -- and [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, the first book -- the first book, 1t was printed in 1961, and this was printed in\nIsrael, and this book in -- in the English, it is a memorial book for my town. And 1n the --\nin -- all it\u2019s -- in Yiddish it\u2019s called, \u201cKolbushova Pinkus.\u201d Pinkus is memor -- a\nmemorial book. And it\u2019s a very good book, it\u2019s one of the -- because every town gave out\n-- called the yeeska book, a memorial book. And this is one of the best, because it has\n1400 pages, and it has about a few hundred ph-photos. So it\u2019s a very good book, specially\nfor the people from my town, they didn\u2019t have the pictures. So this was in the -- in 61.\nAnd then now, people a lot, children, they want to have the book, but it\u2019s not available.\nThe only time I got the book is when somebody dies, and the children don\u2019t know\nYiddish, so I buy back from them, and I could give it to them. This 1s the first one, then I\nhad a lot of articles and papers, that two, three, four times a year 1n the -- in the \u201cJewish\nNews,\u201d and there are some good articles. Like, for instance, last year I had an article, and\nit was reprint -- reprinted in 25 different papers, because it goes from one, they take it.\nAnd then later I -- I got copies from the other papers. It was from California, from\nFlorida. Now I even got a copy from a paper from London, that they got a -- a -- reprinted\nthis article from -- in London, and somebody send it to me. And then came out a book,\n\u201cAgainst All Odds,\u201d which 1s -- was very successful, and then after against all is, \u201cA\nJewish Boyhood in Poland, Remembering Kolbushova.\u201d This is my youth in Kolbushova.\nAnd now, two other books will come out this year, which I told you one is being written\nby Amy Hill Hart. This is the author of, \u201cHaving Our Say,\u201d which became very popular,\nand it was a show on television, and it selled over two million copies, and --",
        "A: This -- no.",
        "A: The book from Amy Hill Hart? No. This is -- because she\u2019s the daughter of German\nimmigrants, and this -- because she wrote this book aga -- \u201cHaving Our Say.\u201d This 1s\nabout a minority, about Negroes, children of slaves. So she wanted to write aga-again a\nbook about minorities, and because it was such a successful. And she wrote in -- 1n -- 1n\npapers, and in -- in Associated Press, about me, about when I collected the six million\npennies. And she wrote it, so she got in touch with us, and she said she would like to\nwrite a book about us, about our life during the Holocaust, from the -- so we told her we\nhave already two books. She said no, she wants to write it from the viewpoint of a\nGerman. So this was -- for this we were interested, because we wanted to see how she\nwill -- she will handle, how she will approach. So she had interviews, and we sent -- she\nwas even to Israel, and she went to Yad Vashem, she went to the museum to see all those\nthings, because she didn\u2019t know too much about the Holocaust, and we arranged\ninterviews with the director, and with the director from ADL, from -- with Mr. Foxman,\nwith Elie Wiesel, with others, and so she -- she just finished the book, we don\u2019t agree\nwith everything. Not that we don\u2019t agree, she let out and she had -- but she said this is the\nfirst draft, probably there will be a few drafts. And she wants to have -- because she can\nhave publishers where she\u2019s now known, because her book was such a success. It was a\nshow on -- in -- in Broadway, and then it was on television, on channel two, and it was\nsold over two million pa -- copies. It was for six months the best seller on New York\nTime list. So -- so we are preparing this book, and then I prepare this book what I told\nyou, with the vignettes, which I\u2019m very much interested in the vignettes, because this 1s\nstories that didn\u2019t go in in the first book, in the second book, in the third book. Those are\nstories that I don\u2019t want to let them out. Stories from before the war, stories from the war,\nfrom cruelties, from -- so I have this, and I have the title, so we worked this. And then\nlater, when I wa -- finished those two books, which I think it will be this year, so then\nlater we'll think about something else.",
        "A: I think this is very important, because the survivors co -- testimonies is more\nimportant than even reading a book. Because, you see like for instance, I was not long\nago I was in the -- to speak in a -- in -- in a school, and there was -- it wasn\u2019t -- there were\nnot Jewish students, there were mostly Christians. So the -- who -- with they -- the\nteacher, when they introduce, they said, \u201cYou -- we -- I want we should see this man,\nbecause in a few years, you'll be able to say, I saw a survivor, because then there will not\nbe survivors. So you saw the survivor, and you heard it from a survivor.\u201d So this is very\nimportant when you go to schools, and then -- when you did -- it\u2019s also depends how you\ntell the story. Now, when I go -- so I ask always how old the children are, if they are --\nwhat nationality they are, wh-what a -- what ethnic background. It\u2019s very important\nbecause you have to tell them stor -- different stories. Now in -- how old, and how many -\n- and I never prepare a speech. When I prepare a speech, it\u2019s a fiasco. I have to come and\nlook at the faces, and then I speak. As you can see, I cannot -- I cannot read a speech.\nNow, not long ago I was in Elizabeth, and this was three high schools put together, and\nthere were about -- I would say about 250 students, not one White, all of them Black.\nAnd it was a different experience. And I told them, and naturally I compared the\nHolocaust with -- with the life of the Black people in America. Se -- so you have to cater\nto each one different. So for this reason I ask what nationality, what -- not so much\nnationality, what religion and -- and age, and it\u2019s so you --",
        "A: Yes, they are very interested. It\u2019s also depends how you tell the story, because I went\nto some -- to some -- somebody spoke, and because we were two, and when the other\nperson spoke, so the teach -- the students were talking to each other, they didn\u2019t have no\ninterest, because -- I didn\u2019t blame them, because the way the person talked, it was very\nmonotonous, and -- and then later when I spoke, they had a different interest. I was in a\nschool, and they had about 400 children, so then the principal came to me, he said, \u201cI can\ntell you only one thing. This is the first time that they were sitting for two hours, and they\nlistened. And they -- I could never keep them for so long, and they should have a\ninterest.\u201d Again, I see what the children -- what interest it is. Now, if you go, and you see\nla -- when I speak to a Jewish group, and when the Jewish group is let\u2019s say between 16\nand seven -- 15 and 17 years, I don\u2019t tell them stories about the death camps. They have\nno interest about the death camps. They want to know what did the Jews do. How did\nthey protect themselves. So then I tell them stories about my activity in the underground,\nin the woods. This what they want to know. They want to know if I did something, if I\nkilled somebody, if I -- this -- this what they into, they\u2019re not interested in Auschwitz.\nThey are not interested se -- in the -- 1n the ovens, and the cruelty, what the Germans did.\nThis is ha -- no. They -- the same thing in Israel, and I spoke in Israel, the children are\ninterested what did the Jew do. And if you tell them a story from a underground, from a\nresistance, from this, this what they associate, and this what they like to hear. So for this\nreason you have to fa -- you have to face the people, and to see what they have -- what\ninterest they have.",
        "A: Yes, yes, there was, but nobody knew about it. There was, like for instance, they were\nvery -- with everybody, like now you -- when you speak about the resistance, you speak\nabout the Warsaw ghetto. Now, there were a lot of resistance story, but the Warsaw\nghetto, this is the emblem, this is the -- the -- the main thing that -- that you talk about\nresistance. It was important, because this was the first resistance in Europe against the\nGermans. And also, the resistance was in Warsaw -- the resistance was in Warsaw, where\nthey didn\u2019t have no help. It --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "A: So we spoke about -- about [indecipherable] didn\u2019t know too much. And then -- now\nthe Warsaw uprise, this is the main thing, which was a very important thing, because they\ndidn\u2019t fight to win a war, because this wasn\u2019t how -- because they knew that they would\nbe killed. This was only for a fight to pay back a little bit, to take revenge. Not to go and\nbe killed without killing somebody else, and also to show that there are -- there is some\nresistance. This is for the honor of the Jews, for the honor of the Jewish flag. And there\nwere other camps that they were resistance, but people don\u2019t know about it, it -- very few.\nLike for instance, there 1s a film, I -- probably you saw it, is the, \u201cEscape from Sobibor.\u201d\nDid you see this? It\u2019s a very powerful video, and -- and how they tried to save m --\nunfortunately from the people who escaped, they all practically were killed by the Poles,\nvery few survived. As a matter of fact, the man who was the leader, his name was\nFriedlander, he was the leader and the organizer of this revolt, he -- after he escaped, he\nsomehow survived, and he went back to his small town, he opened a small store, and six\nmonths later he was killed by the natives, by his friends, after he went out from Sobibor.\nSo this 1s a very -- it\u2019s a big tragedy that even the people who did something, they were s\n-- they were killed later. Now, I have friends who were in the resistance in different\nplaces, but after the war, they were killed. Now -- now, take for instance, Treblinka, it\nwas the most horrible camp, because Treblinka was not con -- con -- was not converted\nfrom a labor camp. This was built as a death camp, and they -- everything was done there\nfor the death camp. It was very terrible. 700,000 people were killed there. And when you\nsay 700,000 dollars, I say it so fast, like -- like -- like we will count 700 dollars. So the --\nan -- and from Treblinka they had also revolt and escape. From the escape on -- 600\nescape, and how they escaped. Not from the people who had to be killed, from the people\nwho were the permanent prisoners, who did the undressing, taking out the gold from the\nteeth, and from the 600, 40 survived from the -- from the 600, cause on the -- fr --\nthrough the time they were killed. There is even a story that a Polish group, two Polish\npeople found 12 people from Treblinka hiding in the woods, and they killed them. And\nwhen after -- after the war, somebody denounced them, and they were taken to court, and\nthey got -- those two got three years jail for killing the 12 people. And after three years,\nthey were -- came out, and imagine, for killing 12 people who escaped from Treblinka,\nthey got three years. After they escaped, and they -- they were living in Poland, and later\nwhen the government changed, it wasn\u2019t any more a Communist government, in 1989,\nwhen -- after Lech Walesa, when they had the solidarity. So the people sued the\ngovernment that they were arrested in -- and they -- and they were in jail three years. And\nthe reason why they sued the government, they said they killed Jewish Bolshevik bandits.\nThe people were Jewish Bolshevik bandits. Now, the people escaped from Sobibor,\nthey\u2019re hide -- they were hidden -- them -- they hid themselves in the woods. So they\nsaid that they were Jewish Bolshevik bandits, and the reason they killed them 1s because\nthey were good Polish patriots, and they wanted to kill the Bolshevik bandits. And this\nwhat they -- when they ki -- they say -- they sued the government. So th -- so one got in --\nfrom the government, they gave him something, 400 million zlotas, which it was not\nmillions, 1t came out to about 40,000 dollars compensation because they were three years\nin jail. Because they say tha -- this what -- they killed the Jews doesn\u2019t mean anything,\nbut they say they killed Jewish Bolshevik bandits. And -- so th -- after this, when they got\nthis in court, so about 300 Poles who were arrested for killing Jews, all of them started to\nsue the government, that they say that we killed Jewish Bolshevik bandits. And it\u2019s a very\nunfair. Now, I got -- when -- when I\u2019m prepare -- I\u2019m preparing now the new book, so I\ngot a order from Bukonroffsky. Bukonroffsky was the head of the Polish underground in\nPoland, from the AK, General Bukonroffsky. So I got a order from Bukonroffsky, from\nSeptember 1943, that he gave a order to all Polish AK members, that they should go out\nin the woods, and to find the Jewish Bolshevik bandits, and to kill them. And this is\nwhen, about three months later, when I approached my friend, he should take in my\ngroup, into his group, and then when they shot me, probably this was on account of the\norder that they have to kill all -- and also the order said, first you have to kill the\ncommandant, and once the commandant will be killed, it will be easy to kill the rest of\nthe group. So for this reason, probably, they got -- wanted to get rid of me, and then later\nthey would kill the rest of us. So I got from England, I got the original order, the date, the\nnumber, because tho -- this is in the archives of this Polish underground, which 1s still in\nLondon.\nHow do you see the role of the Holocaust museum here, and do you keep up with some\nof the politics that are swirling around? And let\u2019s -- the first question first, how do you\nsee the role of the museum here?",
        "A: Well, the role of the museum, I am very disappointed, is because the museum actually\n-- this is -- it is a government institution, it is a government museum. Now, for this reason\nI was very much for Dr. Royach, because Dr. Royach was very dedicated, and he wanted\n-- he did not need this job, because he had a very good practice, he\u2019s a psychiatrist. But\nhe wan -- because I know, I had discussions with him before he took the job, because he\ndidn\u2019t want to take the job in fir-first place. Then later -- and I talked him in -- well, in --",
        "A: He was the previous director, and he spoke to me, naturally he didn\u2019t take on my\nwork, but he ask me what I think about it, we are very good friends. So he wanted -- he\nwa -- took this job, because he wanted it should be a Jewish museum. It should be -- it --\nthe Holocaust shouldn\u2019t be watered down. Because there was a case that the -- some other\nnationalities or other ethnic groups came 1n, and they said well, we had a Holocaust.\nHolocaust was for the Jews. The Polish people say Polish Holocaust. Poland didn\u2019t have\na Holocaust, because by Jews, every Jew had to be killed. No -- in -- in Poland, if you did\nsomething wrong, they arrested you. If you were in the underground, they caught you\nwith weapons, they caught you with black mart -- mark -- market, so they arrested you.\nAnd wi -- and if they arrested you, it doesn\u2019t mean that the whole family had to be killed.\nBy Jews is -- they\u2019re like Elie Wiesel said, not all victims were Jews, but all Jews were\nvictims. So -- so he wanted to keep it as a Jewish museum, and -- and -- and now, when\nhe is on -- now that he received the best proof, he was pushed out because he didn\u2019t want\nArafat should come as a Head of State. First thing, Arafat was not a Head of State, and th\n-- he said if Arafat was not such a Jew lover, and if he wanted to s -- that they said to\nlearn about the Holocaust, he had Yad Vashem right under his nose. And he knew very\nwell what the Holocaust is, because if Arafat will come as a Head of State, they had to\nclose the museum, and give him the VIP treatment, and he was against it. And for this\nreason he was fired. So he -- I am afraid that this will be watered down, that the\nHolocaust, the Jewish Holocaust will be watered down, because other people will came --\ncome in. Like there was once in -- in a -- what was it, not a -- no, Croatia wanted to make\na -- make something about the Holocaust, and Croatia was -- they were the worst\nmurderers in -- in the world. They had the Oestasha, the Oestasha killed thousands and\nthousands of Serbs, thousand and thousands of -- of Jews, and now they are the victims,\nthe victims of the Holocaust. Now, they were collaborators with Germany. They were not\noccupied by Germany, they were collaborators, it was never occupied by Germany. So\nthis -- so I think that the Holocaust museum will be watered down, because it will not be\nstrict that it\u2019s a Jewish Holocaust, where Yad Vashem is only a Jewish Holocaust,\nbecause they don\u2019t have other ethnic groups to be Yad Vashem, and to do -- to say, well,\nthis was my Holocaust. And -- so it\u2019s a big difference. Now you have a other -- a -- a\nmemorial museum in -- in New York. Now this is a new story, because this is a\nHolocaust museum, but it has three tiers. The first one when you go in, this -- they show\nyou the book -- the -- the life of Jews from before the war. And if you go in, you will see\nthere\u2019s some of my pictures there. Then you have -- you have the -- the second floor is\nthe Holocaust, and the third floor is how the Jews picked up their life after the Holocaust.\nIt\u2019s a whole different -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a all different story. But in Washington, I am afraid\nthat the -- that the people who are now in charge, they will water down the Jewish\nHolocaust, and they -- they are artifacts, I gave them a lot of artifacts there what they\nhave. But they arti -- and this was the reason that Dr. Royach was pushed out, because he\nwanted it should be a Jewish Holocaust museum, wa -- that the Holocaust was only\nJewish.",
        "A: Well, to be -- which is important that -- look, we can talk and talk, there is a lot of\nthings important, but, about the Holocaust I think the most important thing is, is not to\nforget that there was a Holocaust. Because we cannot have the six million people die in\nvain. And in vain I mean they die, and there will be no remembrance, and there will not\nbe no -- ho-how should I say it? That the people should not cry after them, because they\ndied for no reason at all. That we should talk about them. So this is very important. And -\n- and the boo -- all the books, every book which 1s written, from every Holocaust, if the\nbook 1s good, if the book is bad. Some are better, some are not so good, but everybody\nhas to tell a story, and it\u2019s -- I encourage always when people say well, I want to write a\nbook, I encourage them, and if I can help them in any way, I do. Because everybody has a\ndifferent story. So naturally some book are not so important, they are not -- but still, it\u2019s\nan important thing, because this is written by a survivor, and if he survived, it is\nimportant. [clock chiming]. Well, so this is -- this is mostly what, you know, so the\nchildren should be -- they should be taught -- they should be rem-reminded, and they\nshould be told about the Holocaust. Because, if the children of my sisters, who were three\nand a half, four, five years old, if they will know that 50 years later, somebody will speak\nabout them, maybe their life, their death wouldn\u2019t be so horrible. There will say\nsomebody will remember me 50 years later. But if -- and also, I want -- now I have my --\nI have my pictures that I saved, 500 photos. I remember the names, I remember the\norganizations they belong, and I want now to have an album. I don\u2019t know if you ever\nsaw Vishniak\u2019s album. There was a man tha -- he wrote -- he had pictures from life\n[indecipherable] in Jews. I want to have this album. The reason why -- and I want to\nmention everybody who is in the pictures, everybody\u2019s name, because I want that\nsomeday -- not someday, this -- everybody\u2019s name should be mentioned. It shouldn\u2019t be\nlike he lived like -- like comes in autumn, the leaves dry out, the wind comes, blows\naway the leave, and the leave disappears, like this was never -- it was never a leave. It\u2019s\nthe same thing, I don\u2019t want that the person who lived, and the Holocaust killed them, the\npeople were killed, and they disappeared, and the name was never mentioned. Because he\nwas a human being, he was alive, he had dreams. He wanted to live, and to have a future,\nto have children, have grandchildren. But he was wiped out. So I want this person, should\nbe written down that there was a man who lived. I have his picture. And then the pictures\nshould see this is how he looked. This what I want, and this what my dream is, to have an\nalbum with everybody\u2019s picture, it should be recorded that there was once a man like this,\nand he was destroyed. So there are certain things that I still would like to do. And if I will\ndo it, I don\u2019t know. I try.",
        "A: Well, yeah, I didn\u2019t want to come America, because -- I think I explained to you, my\naim was -- my dream was a --",
        "A: -- and then when I came America, like I said to you that when I -- in the beginning, I\ncouldn\u2019t make a living, I didn\u2019t have a job, and I was nobody, because here in America is\n-- even if you are nobody, but when you have money, you give charity, you become\nsomebody. So then, what I achieved, I established a business, I established certain things\nthat -- donations. I helped my family in -- in Israel 1f I could. I -- and -- and -- and -- I -- I\nam involved in -- in a lot of organizations, and -- and people know me. Like, for instance,\nif we go someplace, and my wife is always, see this is Norman Salsitz, he wrote this\narticle, nor -- so this is an achievement, that I am somebody, and it doesn\u2019t mean that I\nhave to make money out of it, but I want to be involved, and I am involved. Some people\nthey -- they didn\u2019t want to be involved. And ever -- if I belonged to organization, I cannot\njust belong to organization, and to say, well I -- I belong to organization, I pay dues and\nthat\u2019s it. If I belong to org -- organization, I have to be active. Otherwise I don\u2019t belong to\nthe organization. And achievement is like three years ago, I -- I was the man of the year\nhere in -- in Springfield. [indecipherable] made a nice -- and a f -- and a few years before,\nfrom Israel, once, I was honored. This was a -- this 1s an achievement that I am doing\nsomething, and then the people try to -- to pay back something. Not in money, but some\nacknowledgement. And everybody wants to have some acknowledgement. So this what I\nmeant, that in America, I started to make a living, maybe a little better than -- more than a\nliving, and -- and we live like -- like American people. Live a nice house. My daughter\ngot married, I bought her a house. She opened her office in Boston, I bought her a -- I\nbought her a -- a office in Boston. Two weeks ago I went, and I bought her a house in\nNew Hampshire. She wanted a house on the -- on the -- on the lake, it to -- should be\nclose to where the ski -- because they going skiing every weekend 1n the winter, so this\nwill be close. So this is an achievement, that I could do it for my daughter. Now, I don\u2019t\nknow if she could do it on her own, but if I did it, and for my grandchildren, this is an\nachievement.",
        "A: Well, Norman Salsitz is all of those things, all of those things. Now, if I speak about\nsomething, and if I want to say something from my hometown, Kolbushova, I alway -- I\ncall it home. I am -- I was there 22 years, but I am in the United States 50 years, more\nthan double, but still this -- even America is dear to me, and I think -- I think the best --\nbiggest patriots America had -- has, are people -- newcomers, because we appreciate\nAmerica. Some people who are born in America, they don\u2019t appreciate America. We\nappreciate. And then, if -- if -- so I love America, but still, when I say home, I have my\nlittle town, this is my home. Taddek was when I survived, and to be -- why did I survive?\nI fought back. I didn\u2019t survive because I was standing there with my hands down when I\nwas laying on the floor, shot four times. And if I wouldn\u2019t be able to grab my revolver,\nand to kill them, I wouldn\u2019t be alive, because they were -- today I got a letter from one of\nthe people from my town in -- a very nasty letter, a very anti-Semitic letter. She is the\nhead of the culture and history department. She was a professor in university. A very\nanti-Semitic letter. And I answered her also a very strong letter. And then later she wrote\nto me, which I never answered, she said, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t,\u201d -- I accused her of being anti-\nSemitic, she said, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t kill nobody, but you are a murderer.\u201d Why am I\nmurderer? Because I killed those two guys. So when I was laying on the floor, wounded\nfour times, I should have | -- be there, and beg them give me one more bullet, and finish\nme off. But because I protected myself, and my brother, and I shot them, so n-naturally I\nam a murderer. So -- so when it comes Taddek, Taddek 1s somebody who refused to die.\nWhen it comes to Norman Salsitz, Norman Salsitz is all of those things. Now, I am\nliving, I am in a free country, I can do anything I want. I never had anything bad from the\ngovernment in the United States. They never did anything wrong to me, and I can speak\nup. If something is wrong, I open my mouth. I have -- I have stories here is that\nsomething happens in -- in -- in Hoboken, something happens there, but I always spoke\nup, and I always could yell, and I always could say what I want. Nobody said be -- be\nquiet because you are a Jew. Nobody yet. There were some people who have anti-Semitic\nremarks, but nobody yet told me [indecipherable], nobody kicked me because I am a Jew.\nAnd this is what America is. I can be what I am, and I am not afraid that somebody will\nsay you cannot be this, you cannot be this because you somebody different. And this\nwhat I tell the children when I spoke to them. You should be on the watch, if some\nskinhead, or somebody comes to you, and will -- he will tell you a story that this Black 1s\nnot good, that this Oriental is not good, this Jew is not good. You should always answer,\nand you should always stay on guard, and then, we will not have a Holocaust in America.\nBut if nobody will say it, who knows? There will be enou -- enough people, they will get\nbigger and bigger, and we could have problems. So this the people -- the children\nunderstand. But being in America I think is a privilege, and the privilege is because I can\nbe anything I want. I can be -- so long as I\u2019m not against the law. The only thing I cannot\nbe is a president, because I was not born here. But otherwise, I can be anything\n[indecipherable] capable, I can do it. Nobody can stop me. My daughter, she is a daughter\nof survivors, she is a lawyer. My son-in-law, he\u2019s a third generation, he\u2019s my son-in-law,\nhe\u2019s a assistant professor at Harvard. He\u2019s acknowledged, he goes around all the world.\nMy grandchildren, I hope they will be something. They can do it here. Where we, being\nin Poland for thousand years -- see, I always -- I always was a Polish Jew. And this what\nI was hurt. I wanted to be a Jewish Pole. Being a Jewish Pole it means I could be a Jew\nProtestant, I could be a Jew Christian, a Jew cat -- a -- a-- a Jew Catholic, but I wanted to\nbe a Jewish Pole, but no, I was a Polish Jew. And this is a big difference between a Polish\nJew, and a Jewish Pole. And this what I could never achieve in Poland. Like take for\ninstance, in Italy. In Italy the Jews were treated very well, and 80 percent of Jews in ta --\nin Italy survived. There were not too many Jews in Italy, but as many there were, 80\npercent survived. Now you will ask, Mussolini was a partner with Hitler. Why? Because\nthe Italian people said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have Jews. We have Italians with a different religion.\u201d\nThis what they approved the Jew, a different religion. And th -- and again, later, when\nthey had undergrounds, so they asked th-the Italians from the underground, they said,\n\u201cWhy do you go and help the Jews?\u201d They said, \u201cWhen we on the underground, we fight\nagainst Hitler. Everything what Hitler says, we are opposite. He says to kill the Jew, so\nwe save them.\u201d But in Poland, was different. In Poland, when he said to kill the Jews,\nthey said -- my wife had a boyfriend, he loved her, and he was everything. He said, \u201cI\nhate the Germans, what they do with Poland, but one thing I have to admire and thank\nthem, that they got rid of the Jews for us.\u201d And he was a Polish patriot. But this was very\nimportant, he got rid of the Jews. So this is the different America -- I say America is my\ncountry. See, when it comes the Fourth of July, I hang out a flag. I am the only one on the\nstreet to hang out the flag. And the reason why I hang out the flag, because in Poland, if I\ndidn\u2019t hang out the flag, the police came, gave me a fine. Here, nobody gets fined by the\npolice, and because they don\u2019t force me, I want to hang out a flag, because I think this is\nvery important for me.",
