        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU\nPage l\nFela Warschau interview 2/9/95\nSWB: Okay, Fela, why don't you tell me how it is that you\ncame to Bergen Belsen.\nFELA WARSCHAU: Our camp was labor camp, was, the outs-, on\nthe outskirts of Hamburg. Every day we were coming into the\ncity by train, and working on the streets, cleaning [clears\nthroat] the rubble from the bombs that fell. It was the end\nof 19, almost the end of March 1945 when the fliers came\nalmost constantly, there was very little respite from _ the\nbombing, and we knew that liberation is at the door but if\nwe would be alive to see that, no one knew. And sure\nenough, Germ- the Germany Hitler was so determined to\ndestroy the Jewish people that every time the allies came\ncloser, they evacuated us deeper into Germany. This is what\nhappened to us. We were taken on a train again, and after\nseveral hours of travel, we found ourselves in Bergen\nBelsen. Bergen Belsen, it was something I have never\u2019 seen\nin all the years that I have been a prisoner in the ghettos,\nat home, and in the camps. At the time when we arrived,\neverything was in disarray. They did not burn the _ bodies\nanymore. They were stapled up like cord wood on the side.\nIt was unusual warm for this time of year. And the smell\nfrom the bodies was terrible. We were assigned into a\nbarrack just a bare floor. Nothing anymore. There was a",
        "skeleton crew only of SS people, and the camps were guarded\nby volunteers mostly, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Hungarians,\nand they were wearing white arm bands of surrender. But\nthat did not stop them from shooting at us if we came close\nto the barbed wire and tried a hold of that piece of color\nabbey, all these big piles that were laying outside of the\nbarbed wire, and supposed to have been the food, but they\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU\nPage 2\ndid not feed us for days. And that was decomposed already.\nBut we were so hungry that this would have been even good\nenough for us. The water was turned off. It was chaos. We\ndid not work anymore. You just walked around and _ people\njust dropped dead in front of you. And you were so-_ dehu\nmanized you just walked over these people and kept on going\nnot knowing what are we doing here, what is going to happen\nto us. Typhoid fever doesn't carry, and lice. I always\ntell everybody that if you sit on the ground, they could\nalmost carry you away, So many and so huge they were. My\nSister and I and two more friends, we always kept together,\nSupporting ourselves. Whatever we could find to eat or even\nwith moral support, giving each other courage. So we hada",
        "little piece of bread that we got for the journey. This was\ngone. By some miracle, my sister found a potato and we were\nsharing this one potato, a slice every day. You try to find\nsomeone you knew, very seldom, but one day we found a woman\nfrom my hometown. She looked exceptionally good, and_ she\nsaid to us, I hope I live long enough to survive and _ see\nthat I'm a free person. Looking at her, I thought oh, sure,\nyou will. Next day she was dead. She was swollen from all\nthe hunger. We just walked around like zombies, every day.\nGoing back into the barrack, laying down, coming out, water,\nlike I said was turned off. People that were so thirsty\nwent to the place where the latrine supposedly was and\nlicked the sweat from the walls there. I don't remember\ndoing that, I just remember sharing this potato like uh,\nsee-through slice each one of us got. Four of us~ sharing\nthat. But we got weaker every day because there was nothing\nto eat. Finally, the last day when we had nothing, I could\nbarely drag myself. I said to my sister I'm going into the\nbarrack and I'm going to lie down and just die in there. I\ndo not want to die and people should just step over me like\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU\nPage 3",
        "others do. They followed me. We all lied down there and\njust almost said goodbye to life. One of our friends, = she\nwas even younger than I was, the youngest. She was always\nsearching, trying to find a way. So she said she has to\ntake the last look outside and see what's going\u2019 on. When\nshe came back she said to me, there's something funny going\nout there. People are running all over the place and, it's\nunusual. It's not what usually happen. And I told her to\njust lay down and die in peace. She must be hallucinating.\nShe insisted, so my sister walked out with her. When my\nSister came back, I don't know with what strength she came\nback, grabbed me by my arm, and she says, get up, get up,\nguess what, everybody's running, and the gates are open,\nthere's a man sitting, is it a tank or whatever, we couldn't\ndistinguish at that time one thing from the other. He is\nspeaking through a loudspeaker, his words are being\ntranslated, I think we were liberated. When I got up and\nwalked outside, my eyes couldn't comprehend, it just didn't\nregister. It's unbelievable. I couldn't believe this was\nreally true, so I said to my sister that she has to grab me\nby my arm and do something physical so I realize that I am\nreally alive and we were liberated. It was the English army\nthat liberated us. And the way I understand is that they\nreally didn't come to liberate this camp, they were just\ngoing, passing by, somewhere else, and they were attracted\nby the stench and wanted to investigate and see what's going\non there. This is what they found. People, all over,\nlaying, strewn, live corpses, dead corpses, because they did",
        "not even bury before we came, they were just laying around.\nThey didn't bury them in the pits, they didn't burn then,\njust dead bodies all over the place. It was, for them,\nunbelievable. They distributed food, pieces of bread, and\nthey radioed ahead for more help because they did not\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU\nPage 4\nrealize what they have found. It was heartbreaking to see\nthe sum of these living corpses being handed a piece of\nbread and at the same time, dying, on the day of their\nliberation because they were so starved, so far gone, that\neven this piece of bread didn't help them anymore. I got\nsome food with my sister, we just stood there hugging each\nother and just crying and, it was a moment that I think I'll\nnever forget in my life. Just walking around and trying to\nmake the best of it. They, the English tried to instill\nsome normalcy in that camp. They um, naturally, weeded out\nthe sick people right away because there was a lot of people\nwith typhoid fever. And they did not have any hospitals,\nnot enough medication, so they had makeshift hospitals.\nWhat was make- just a plain barrack. After Belsen were the\nwooden camps, where we were. Bergen was farther, the brick",
        "buildings, and this is where they took the sick people.\nThere, people were laying on plain mattresses on the floor.\nThe only one they did attend to was the ones they thought\nthey would survive. The severe cases, they didn't even\nbother much because they didn't have enough medication. My\nSister got very ill, and she was taken to one of these\nplaces. After I found her, I didn't even know where she\nwas, She told me that the doctor made the rounds and he\nSald, we won't bother with her because she will not survive.\nIf she survives this night, which is the crisis, then we'll\ngive her some medication. She said, I did not sleep all\nnight. If I die, I wanted to die with my eyes open. But in\nthe morning, I was still alive, and when the doctor came, he\nsaid to her, oh you're still alive, now we are going to\ntreat you. I had a slight case of typhoid fever, with me\nthey didn't bother at all. Also, they tried to bring some\nnormalcy into our lives. They did disinfect us, gave us\ndifferent clothes, they burned down the barracks, the wooden\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU\nPage 5\nbarracks, we were- which were full of disease and we were\ntransferred to the brick barracks. There were like bunk",
        "beds and so many people to a room, and they gave us food and\ntried to treat us. This was it. Every day, there were\nposted lists from different liberated camps, telling of the\nSurvivors. We always run eagerly to see if anyone from our\nfamily had survived. We never found anyone. My friend, the\nyoungest one, waS So inguisitive, she got a message from two\nbrothers that were...\nSWB: We have to reload\n[CAMERA RELOAD |\n[CR#2 ]\nSWB: Let's start again with your sister bringing you out\nand you hearing the sound, and what sounds everybody made.\nFELA WARSCHAU: It was noisy. It was loud. It's like\njoyous shouts from people that could still raise their\nvoices, but most of them, the sick, were silent. Some of\nthem had tears, you know, looking back, you remember more\nbeing asked, you remember more, people with tears in their\neyes, just like we did, cry, from happiness, that it was\nsuch a long dream, all we dreamed about and what kept us\ngoing in the camps was if maybe, if maybe by some miracle we\nwould survive, how happy we would be, um, that it shouldn't\nbe a dream, it should be a reality and we lived to see this\nmoment. What kept us also going is, was the thought of\nafter liberation, that we also would be able to meet our",
        "relatives, our family, which we were parted from. The\npeople, what they fed us, 1S soup and bread, to begin with.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU\nPage 6\nThey started slow. I Know my husband told me that he was\nliberated by the Russians and they gave them a lot of food\nand people ate too fast and some of them died because their\nstomachs couldn't digest the food, it was to the point that\nyour system didn't work right after being so starved. So I\nsuppose maybe they were more cautious. There wasn't a lot\nof food. It was a moderation which was just right. Um, the\nchanges with burning the barracks and disinfecting us, first\nof all we had the clothes, which we were wore there, which\nwas full of disease and lice, we had to go through showers,\nthen some powder. I- I couldn't tell you what it was, but I\nknow, disinfected with a powder. They gave us different\nclothes, also. And then we were transported to the other\nbrick buildings. We were assigned so many people to a room,\nand there were bunk beds there. We shared the room with\nother people. We were weak enough to get along with\neverybody, we were all happy just to be alive, and ~>be\nliberated. But you see, um, reading the lists from other",
        "camps, from the survivors, that lived through this, we did\nnot find anybody which, at this point, what kept me going\nwas all this, and I was fine but when I didn't find anybody\nthis is the time we almost, I caved in. I only lived with\nthat hope that I will meet my _ family. I had such a\nwonderful home life, such loving parents, and I had _ two\nbrothers, and besides that, I don't count the rest of the\nfamily like uncles and aunts and cousins, I think it was\nalmost close to sixty people our rel- we had such ae big\nrelation. And none of us survived to the end, it was my\nSister and I, and two cousins that survived all this. So\nyou see, I was desperate after being liberated, knowing that\nno one had survived, he met a man that he knew from large\nghetto. He was in the line behind my father and my _ two\nbrothers. And when we met him after liberation, he told us\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU\nPage 7\nthat they went the wrong way in Auschwitz. But you_ know,\nyou st- really don't believe it until you really hit it\nyourself. You have to be so convinced that no one is alive\nthat even he told us, we still hoped, maybe it isn't so,\nmaybe by some miracle they did survive. But it didn't",
        "happen that way. So you see we were ina displaced camp,\nyou just didn't know what to do. Like I said my friend got\na message two brothers of hers survived and they were on the\nAmerican zone. They wanted her to come there. They would\ncome and pick her up. Well she persuaded us to travel with\nthem, since we had nothing here, what did we have to lose.\nTheir main argument was, maybe by chance you will find\nsomeone there. Maybe they weren't on the list and you will\nfind someone. So we traveled with them. Not having any\nmoney, we traveled on freight trains, on coal wagons. There\nwas only one time when we got in into a passenger train.\nThe conductor didn't even come over and ask us for any money\nbecause he could see who we were and he just made ae wide\nturn around us. We didn't have any money to give him\nanyway. So we arrived on the American zone in Feldafing.\nIt was a camp about, I would say by train an hour away from\nMunich. And it was, um, the Americans were administering\nthis camp, and of course they um, asked the survivors to\nform their own administration, like offices that if you have\ngrievances even an infirmary was there, and ae doctor,\n[clears throat] that was, excuse me, a Survivor. He was the\nhead of this infirmary. They also opened up kitchens and\nwho didn't want to eat in the kitchen got supplies and = you\ncould, if you could manage in the rooms that you got, it was\nalso brick buildings which supposedly housed before a Hitler\nunit[?] there. So this is where we were housed in. Also,\nseveral people in one room, all the four of uS were in a\nbasement room, and another girl which we didn't know at that",
        "Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU\nPage 8\ntime, we were assigned to this room. But we got along very\nwell. There were bunk beds and there were just like one\ncounter, and to keep a couple dishes if you could organize\nthis, and whatever you possessed was shoved underneath the\nbunk beds. And in the middle of the room we had like a pot-\nbelly stove, if you could manage to get food and _ cook,\nthat's what we did on that pot-belly stove. The same thing\nthere, no one was there, um, people in Feldafing were from\nall over Europe. It wasn't only from Poland. We had\nHungarian Jews, Rumanian Jews, Czech Jews, and also Greek\nJews in this camp. Every one just walking around and trying\nto mingle and find someone. Like I said, we never did. But\nwhat the Americans also did, is organize art schools, they\nbrought in films, they brought in um, organized our people\nthe survivors that were muSicians and also traveling from\nother camps they were giving concerts and believe it or not\neven dances, for those that were well enough to attend all\nthis. And also a Jewish, our own police force, to police\nthat it would be safe, you know, from other intruders. They\nkept us busy. But the problem was, there was no future in\nbeing there. Where do we go from there? You see, to",
        "Poland, we didn't want to go back. It was Communist, first\nof all. I knew I had nothing to look for there and to tell\nyou the truth maybe, I know the Polish people resent that\nvery much, but I remember slurs and them being very anti\nSemitic, so I just had no, I didn't feel that I wanted to\nlive there again. That wasn't what I wanted. Of course, we\ndidn't want to stay in Germany, too much Jewish blood\nspilled there, so where do we go from there, you know? I,\nand meanwhile, I, en-, I signed up for [clears throat] art\ncourses, it was um, like a technical, um, training place\nwhere you could learn a trade. And believe it or not, um,\nwe were so alone that we need moral support [clears throat]\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU\nPage 9\nin meeting young people there. Young man and young women,\nwe paired off and we got married. Hu- You needed someone,\nand who else would understand you better than another\nSurvivor. It's like a soul-mate, you know, and you just\nsomebody to support you. I don't think there were really\ngreat romances, it was something, someone that we needed to\nGive, to comfort one another. And this is why we did_ get\nmarried. I got married in 1946. I met this man that was",
        "Originally from Lotch. I spent two years in the ghetto\nthere, and we did get married. My sister also got married,\nI think the same year. We lived in one of the buildings\nafterwards ina different. Another couple, the same room,\nwe divided the room with some wooden boards to be separated\nand have our own privacy, okay. And my husband worked as a\npoliceman, and I went to the art school. This is how. we\nspend our time, trying to figure out where do we go from\nhere? To tell you the truth, I wasn't very strong. I did\nnot regain my strength after the war. Some people did, and\nI felt that the rough journey to illegal Palestine, I could-\nn't take that. I wanted to go somewhere where I could\nrecuperate, but where. You see, the problem was the world\nfinally found out what happened in these camps. No one\nwanted to take the people in in the beginning. We just sat\nthere. So what...\n[CAMERA RELOAD]\n[CR#3]\nSWB: Back in Bergen-Belsen, when you were liberated, did\nthey bring in German nurses to help take care of you?\nFELA WARSCHAU: Yes they tried.

I don't\nthink any one of us thought of doing that. First of all, we\nwere too weak. And then, if I would do that, I would stoop\nto their level. TI don't think I could do that. This is not\nthe way to do it. Uh, I know our rage was inside of us, for\nwhat happened. But it wasn't me that should judge.

And\nsometimes you could see, still, being conquered and like a\nrevulsion on their faces that they had to attend these\npeople.

Like when he marched in, in the,\nmiddle road in Hamburg to work, lined up in five, being\nguarded by these SS men, some of these people really didn't\nknow who we were. One time I remember a wo- a woman walking\nup to this SS man, and saying who are these women? Why are\nthey dressed like that? And you know what their answer was?\nThat we were young prostitutes. And we are, we were being\npunished, put in our camp, because we're not supposed to do\nthat. Can you imagine [laughs] something like that all\nfive-hundred of us Jewish women being prostitutes so we were\nput in camps for punishment. You, this is. And I donot\nknow why the German population did not question some of\nthem, did not question. Is it really true what they are\ntelling me? It seems they did whatever told, like a\nmechanical man or a mechanical woman. This is what\u2019 the\nNazis say, this is what Hitler says and it has to be true.\nIt has to be, because he says it. He was almost like a god-\nlike creature to them. So you see, maybe there were some\npeople, maybe there was a underground, but not enough of\nthem. Not enough of them to make a difference, because if\nthere would be enough, it would have made a difference.\nThey would not abide by a regime like that almost for twelve\nyears I think.\nSWB: Now, let's go to the beginning, how long before you\nwent to Feldafing, did you stay in Bergen Belsen as a_ DP",

Were you locked in...?\nFELA WARSCHAU: No, we were free to move around. We were\nfree to visit other prisoners in, in Bergen Belsen. The\ndoors were open. You could come and go as you please. Even\nventure out to different cities if you felt like it. That's\nwhy people traveled, and some people did venture into the\ncity. I don't know what they were looking for, but\u2019 they\ndid. Those that stayed there, after a while, what they told\nus, they got more food and they just did like every camp try\nemploy the people by some kind of a trade or whatever, make\nit close to normal, and believe it or not, even in\nFeldafing, they developed like a trade thing with the German",
        "population. It was like a in- unwilling partner. Because\nthere were certain things you did get in the displaced\ncamps. But it wasn't enough what you needed. Again, we did\nnot have any money to go and buy anything. Let's say every\nmonth we got a care package. But every month and this care\npackage was always the same thing. I mean, it was wonderful\nfood, but you got a big bag like powdered milk, a huge bag\ndried eggs, and how much can you eat it through the month.\nSo you see, you took this stuff and sort of trade it in,\nwith the German population for something that you wanted.\nWe had no money to deal any other way. And they just loved\nwhat we did. It was like I said, a very unwilling\npartnership doing this. We could not stay all our =4Llives\nisolated there since we were there, from the German popula\ntion.\nSWB: Now in Feldafing, let's go to the early days in\nFeldafing.

        "move around. They even had a hospital which was about I\nwould say, close to mile and a half from the camp, and they\nconverted a hotel into a hospital, it was called a, _ the\nhotel the Kaiser and Elizabeth. And was a golf course\nthere, very big golf, golf course around there. People came\nfrom all over. And Feldafing was sort of in-between you\ntraveled by train, you could go the other way to Garmusch,\nwhich was a famous ski resort in Germany, so there was a lot\nof traffic going, uh, I would say the second or the third\nstation going towards Munich was Starnberg. ... Starnberg\nyou see is very famous, people come there to stay in summer\nand to go skiing and boating. All around there, the places\nwere very familiar to, in Germany, people knew about these\nplaces. But very few people remember Feldafing. It's an\nodd name. So we left, in Feldafing, and my husband worked.\nThey were guarding, like there was a gate in the front, like\na little house for them to be in there, you know like a\npoliceman's guard house.

Like sometimes you feel the people sympathize with\nyou, maybe single ones, but in, all-in-all it didn't come\nacross to me like that. But once I was in the American zone\nin Feldafing, you know the Military Police, they came in a\nlot to the camp because they had connections with this local\npolice, the survivors. They always came in to this, their\noffice there. For what reason I don't know, I never asked,\nbut they were, there was a big camaraderie, it was, they\ndidn't make any difference, to them, like you were an equal\nwith them and there was great warmth that come, that came\nthrough. Even if we didn't understand the English. One day\none of them came in, I remember this, because my husband\ntold me that. He came in on a jeep, and he parked it. He",

Naturally, coming\nfrom here, and thinking he is a policeman, he knows how to\ndrive this car, this jeep, or drive at all. Well he said I\ntook this key and I kept on fiddling back and forth, and I\nbrought him the jeep and he said this is how I learned how\nto drive [laughs], see they were so, you know, it's\nsomething that you felt close to a person when they do\nthings like that. But I think the English were more\ndistant. They meant it good but we didn't understand at\nthat time.\nSWB: Did you witness reunions of survivors, people who\nfound each other who had survived and didn't know...\nFELA WARSCHAU: Like my friend, when she met her brothers,\nand there was my other friend, she was looking for her\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU\nPage 16\nbrother but she found a cousin. It was very hard on _ us\nbecause my sister and I didn't find anybody, and our _ two\nother friends had found someone. We were overjoyed for",
        "them, but at the same time sad for ourselves, knowing that\nthere was nothing to hope for anymore.\nSWB: What about visits to the camp by Eisenhower, do you\nremember?\nFELA WARSCHAU: He was there. He was in Feldafing one time,\nI couldn't tell you exactly when, I know he was there.\nSWB: And what about Ben-Gurion, did he come?\nFELA WARSCHAU: I don't remember that.\nSWB: Tell me about how the Jewish population in Feldafing\norganized itself and what kind of culture they did and did\nthey make a newspaper?\nFELA WARSCHAU: There really was no newspaper but there were\nmeetings. Like I said, there were socials. There were\ndances, the organized dances, there were survivors\u2019 that\nplayed the instruments before the war. Where they got the\ninstruments I will never know. But they organized dances,\nthe Americans also brought in films. It was like a great\nbig building and they run films for us for free there. And\nalso amateur theater. Also survivors that traveled from\ncamp to camp in our own, from our camp, that performed\nlittle skits to entertain us, and like I said, I don't know\nif I told you that, one time they had a skit with that organ\ngrinder, two people, one of them, uh, portrayed Hitler, and",
        "the other one, I don't if it was Goebbels or Goehring or\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU\nPage 1/7\nWeber, and they were going around and begging people, they\nwere all gone and they need a few, I, you probably don't\nunderstand Yiddish or do you. No. Well anyway, there was a\nlittle, I remember a few words in Yiddish, how they were\nSinging this. And to the end they say, we are so poor now\nand broke, give us a few pennies. And we all roared, and\neverybody threw their pennies on the stage, you know.\nSWB: Tell me that story again as if you hadn't told it to\nme. Say the lines in Yiddish and then translate them.\nFELA WARSCHAU: There were amateur theaters. They\nperforming all kind of skits. One of them was, well there\nwas another one about people needing to go to Palestine, you\nknow it was like little propaganda, and this one was two\norgan grinders, going around and begging for money. And\nthey were singing, the song was like [Yiddish words], that\nmeans our luck has run out, and we all we do is grind this\norgan and they beg people for some money to support",
        "ourselves. I will never forget that skit because it was\nlike throwing these pennies in face of these two performers,\nit gave us satisfaction, you know, you don't understand, you\nprobably don't understand the feeling we had at that time.\nThinking that we could sit here, free, and make fun out of\nthem, that's what it was.\nSWB: Do you remember ever having an election in the camp?\nFELA WARSCHAU: I don't remember. I honestly don't. I know\nthey had some kind of organization, um, I think the bunt\nthey were called, and they marched at certain holidays, with\nflags through the camp, in the camp, you know, observing\nthis holiday. I wasn't personally involved. I was not into\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU\nPage 18\npolitics at that time. There were other problems I had _ to\ndeal with, how to get out of this camp, and this wasn't my\ntop priority at that time.\nSWB: What about children, do you remember?",
        "FELA WARSCHAU: We had no children in the beginning. Only\nthe people that got married there in the camp after a while\nhad children. I also had a daughter there, and she was born\nin the year of 1949. So, uh...\nSWB: I need you to tell me the skit story once more,\nbecause the second time you didn't tell me it was Hitler and\nGoehring who were the characters.\nFELA WARSCHAU: So you had this skit, two organ grinders.\nOne in the image of Hitler, and one, I don't remember if it\nwas Goehring or Goebbels. And they came out on the stage,\ngrinding this organ, and singing that song [Yiddish words],\nand we just roared, you know, it was uplifting that we could\nmake fun out of them, on the other side of the coin we were.\nIt was unbelievable at that time. Being for so long, shut\nup. And the smallest child which was a Hitler youth[?], he\nhad the power over you. If he came over and told you, you\nhave to do this, you have to obey them. You have no idea\nthe feelings, what restrictions we had, we felt like\ncornered animals, nowhere to turn. So being free was, it\nwas intoxicating.\nSWB: Tell me a little about how you and your sister\nsupported each other, emotionally.\nFELA WARSCHAU: She did support me, because I was the one",

And she kept on talking me out\nof it. She was the stronger one. I was more like a momma\nand daddy's baby, you Know, we were always, all of us, we\nwere four children but our parents were, to that point, like\nwe were the most precious gems of the million dollars to\nthem. It was unbelievable, the love we had at home and\neverything and this is what I missed so much. You only live\nfor it that they will be here to, to comfort you after all\nwhat happened. And there's nothing, nowhere to turn, so it\nwas very hard for me to take, I got real emotional. Somehow\nshe thought she has to pull together because someone has to\ndo something. So it was a comfort to know that she was so\nstrong at that time. But after a while it came out that I\nwas the stronger one than she was, later on [laughs] So you\nsee sometimes the roles reverse.\nSWB: Okay, thank you...\nEND",
