At that time I have ant-anti-Semitism in the service,\nspecifically in \u2014 in the area that I was training as a tanker. And I had some anti-\nSemitinism(ph) involved, and because of that, I had an opportunity to go to\nheadquarters of 42\" tank battalion, and so that\u2019s what I did. And I became assistant\nto the adjutant there. And then, of course, we went overseas, and I went on \u2014 and as\nI was \u2014 I was \u2014 I was transferred to the \u2014 the headquarters as a clerk typist, and so\nthat was my title, although I didn\u2019t \u2014 when we went overseas, I didn\u2019t do any typing\nor anything.

People were transferring in\nand out, and there was a \u2014 a Jewish soldier, Weinberg(ph), that transferred out, and\nthe \u2014 several of \u2014 of the soldiers said good, we got rid of another Jew. At that point I\nsaid, I\u2019m Jewish. They couldn\u2019t understand. I didn\u2019t look Jewish, my name wasn\u2019t\nJewish. And I says, well, you didn\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t see the horns coming out? At any\nrate, I\u2014 I had a different feeling with \u2014 with these soldiers, who were part of my\ntank \u2014 tank company. And so I didn\u2019t feel comfortable going to officer training,\ncoming back, and dealing with \u2014 with anti-Semites in my outfit, fighting the\nGermans. So, that was \u2014 that was why I transferred to the company. And course we\ndidn\u2019t have any \u2014 I didn\u2019t have to deal with any anti-Semitism while in the battalion\nheadquarters. So that was \u2014 that was the experience I had.",

And \u2014 and that ended that conversation. But I \u2014 I didn\u2019t really\nhave any direct contact, as such, with \u2014 with \u2014 with the German soldiers, other than,\nJanuary 13, 2015\nas I said, at one time I was there. O-Other times I would \u2014 I would go into a burnt\nout tank, and scrape the carcass from the inside, put it in a bag, cause we didn\u2019t\nwant to leave any s-soldiers behind, so \u2014",
        "Q: So these were Americans that you had to extract?",
        "A: These are \u2014 th-these are American, yeah. One of the tanks of \u2014 of one of our\ncompanies. So \u2014",
        "Q: That had to have been extraordinarily traumatic.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah. Everything there was \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014 but we took things in stride. Soldiers\ndid their job. We \u2014 we \u2014 we did well, and after \u2014 after we left bast \u2014 Bastogne, we \u2014\nwe traveled south, and went through Luxembourg, and then Germany.",
        "Q: Were you engaging the enemy as you\u2019re going along?",
        "A: Oh yes, of course. We\u2019re all fighting, as 1\u2014 as 1\u2014 as \u2014 as I remember, the main\nforce of Germans were defeated in the Bastogne area, and of course there\u2019s still\nplenty of fighting going on, and we ge \u2014 our \u2014 our division fought and engaged the\nenemies as we went down. And then when we got down to \u2014 near Austria, as a \u2014 as\nI told you, General Patton was the Third Army commander, and \u2014 and instructions\nwere that we weren\u2019t supposed to go into Austria. But Patton didn\u2019t like \u2014 didn\u2019t \u2014\ndidn\u2019t like that, and so we went into austr \u2014 Austria also. And that\u2019s where \u2014 okay,\nand as I said, the Russians were supposed to take over the \u2014 Austria, and \u2014 and\nJanuary 13, 2015\nPatton didn\u2019t like the \u2014 the Russians either. And so li \u2014 going down, one of our\ncompanies, one of the companies was making \u2014 was doing reconnaissance, and on\nthe road \u2014 on a certain road, a German Jeep with the German pa \u2014 the commander\nof \u2014 of \u2014 of the \u2014 of \u2014 of the camp, was coming towards them, a \u2014 with a white flag,\nand they surrendered. And it turns out he was telling them of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of\nMauthausen, that 1-it was \u2014 it was five miles back. And the reason they \u2014 they\nwanted \u2014 they \u2014 they gave up to us, is they didn\u2019t want the Russians, because the\nRussians would \u2014 would \u2014 would just kill them. And so that was how we learned of\n\u2014 of the concentration camp. The next morning, I went with the battalion\ncommander and the adjutant into the camp. That was my first seeing it. And of\ncourse, what I observed was piles of shoes, piles of other things. And course, lot of\ndead bodies. And then I went into the \u2014 into the camp, and I went into a particular \u2014\nwait a minute, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m losing words. But I went in and I spoke with some of the\nsurvivors. And I asked, is there anything that \u2014",
        "Q: Now, hang on just for a moment \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: You spoke with some of the survivors because you spoke Yiddish \u2014",
        "A: Yes",
        "Q: \u2014 you were speaking in Yiddish \u2014\nJanuary 13, 2015",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 not \u2014 not \u2014 not English, correct?",
        "A: Yeah, English, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, so tell me about your conversations with them.",
        "A: And so, I said, is there anything I can do. And I recall several coming to me and\nsaying, could you write a letter to my relative in Chicago, if I remember that \u2014 that\nwas \u2014 that particular situation. And so I took the information, and I did write a letter\nto I\u2014I don\u2019t recall having an-any copies, so I \u2014 I don\u2019t know, bu-but this is my\nmemory, that I wrote a letter and told of that \u2014 that this person was safe. And so that\nstood out in my mind.",
        "Q: What did you think as you were approaching the camp? Before you entered the\ncamp proper, did you know what its purpose was?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So as you\u2019re approaching it, what do you see?",
        "A: Well, I saw \u2014 what \u2014 what happened was, the German \u2014 there was a big quarry,\nand the Germans got cement out of there. And what they \u2014 they used, they set up\nthis \u2014 th-this camp, with all the captured Jews that \u2014 that had to work in \u2014 in the\nJanuary 13, 2015\nquarries. And that is \u2014 that is how the camp came about. And the \u2014 the prisoners\nworked in the quarries, getting the cement or wha \u2014 wi \u2014 wi \u2014 the \u2014 w-with \u2014 wi \u2014\nwhich would be the cement that they would be making. So what was my first \u2014 I-I \u2014\nthis has been a long time, so I \u2014 I really \u2014 I really can\u2019t remember how I felt in \u2014 in\nseeing it.",
        "Q: Were there still Germans \u2014 and then ba \u2014 by that I mean soldiers, inside the\ncamp, or not?",
        "A: Well, what we did, wa \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 tho \u2014 our \u2014 our line companies went in, and\nof course, yes, there were Germans in there, and they all surrendered, of course.\nAnd of course our \u2014 our company \u2014 companies took them out, and we eventually\ntook them back to headquarters. But as I said, I was in the headquarters of the\nbattalion, and I didn\u2019t physically get involved with \u2014 with the soldiers there. We \u2014\nwe had our other \u2014 you know, others that were doing it.",
        "Q: Once you and the battalion were inside the camp proper, what did you have to\ndo? Did you have to start giving medical attention, did you start distributing food?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, of course, of course. We have a \u2014 a medical battalion with us,\nand so they went in and did what they had to do, yes.",
        "Q: And did you feed the prisoners, or was that not in your \u2014 did you \u2014 did you give\nthem food, did you give the prisoners food, or \u2014\nJanuary 13, 2015",
        "A: I-I\u2014I can\u2019t tell you, but the \u2014 th-the company \u2014 the soldiers in the \u2014 in the\nvarious companies did what you had to do. So I didn\u2019t \u2014 I personally wasn\u2019t\ninvolved with that.",
        "Q: Okay. But you understood, if no \u2014 if for no other reason than language, that a\nvery large number of them were Jewish? The prisoners.",
        "A: Y-Yes.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 do you recall how you felt about that?",
        "A: Well, I was angry learning of what\u2019s happened, but I \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you\nmy feelings at the time. It\u2019s \u2014",

        "Q: Now, this is the one that you saw.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And as I said, when my father had this bread route, and \u2014 and \u2014 and breads and\nchallahs and so forth, I used to go to the bakery and they had ovens. That\u2019s where\nJanuary 13, 2015\nthey made the challahs and so forth. And when I saw this, it 1t \u2014 it made it \u2014 it\nbrought me back to mind of the ovens in \u2014 in the bakery. And so \u2014",
        "Q: Did you understand when you saw that, what it was used for, and why it was\nbeing used?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: Was it physical obvious?",

        "Q: Mm. But you were still in pursuit of the enemy, so had to move out.\nJanuary 13, 2015",

Of course, I didn\u2019t know at the end of the year \u2014 at the end of the\n\u2014 how many Jews were killed, and I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t happy with \u2014 with what I\u2019d\nlearned.",
        "Q: Of course not. As you\u2019re pursing the enemy deeper into Austria, at some point,\nrelatively soon, you get word that the war is over. How and when did that happen?",

        "A: Well, let\u2019s \u2014 first of all, I was drafted into elev \u2014 a \u2014 a new organization called\n11\" armored division. And we originated in Louisiana. I was in the 42\u2122 tank\nbattalion of the 11\" armored division, and I trained as a tanker. And because of my\nwritten tests that I took, plus the \u2014 the training I got, I was \u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I cou \u2014I could\nhave become a \u2014 an officer. At that time I have ant-anti-Semitism in the service,\nspecifically in \u2014 in the area that I was training as a tanker. And I had some anti-\nSemitinism(ph) involved, and because of that, I had an opportunity to go to\nheadquarters of 42\" tank battalion, and so that\u2019s what I did. And I became assistant\nto the adjutant there. And then, of course, we went overseas, and I went on \u2014 and as\nI was \u2014 I was \u2014 I was transferred to the \u2014 the headquarters as a clerk typist, and so\nthat was my title, although I didn\u2019t \u2014 when we went overseas, I didn\u2019t do any typing\nor anything. I w \u2014I was the assistant to the adjutant and of course the battalion\ncommander gave instructions \u2014 wanted instructions to the \u2014 the adjutant. And of\ncourse, my being the noncom, I did the \u2014 whatever had to be done.\nJanuary 13, 2015",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, what happened was, a \u2014 a incident, for example, during the growing of th \u2014\nof the \u2014 of the division, of the company, the battalions. People were transferring in\nand out, and there was a \u2014 a Jewish soldier, Weinberg(ph), that transferred out, and\nthe \u2014 several of \u2014 of the soldiers said good, we got rid of another Jew. At that point I\nsaid, I\u2019m Jewish. They couldn\u2019t understand. I didn\u2019t look Jewish, my name wasn\u2019t\nJewish. And I says, well, you didn\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t see the horns coming out? At any\nrate, I\u2014 I had a different feeling with \u2014 with these soldiers, who were part of my\ntank \u2014 tank company. And so I didn\u2019t feel comfortable going to officer training,\ncoming back, and dealing with \u2014 with anti-Semites in my outfit, fighting the\nGermans. So, that was \u2014 that was why I transferred to the company. And course we\ndidn\u2019t have any \u2014 I didn\u2019t have to deal with any anti-Semitism while in the battalion\nheadquarters. So that was \u2014 that was the experience I had.",

And I also trained, or learned the .45\npistol. And I learned my \u2014 I learned the armaments very well.",

And then,\nof course, we went over to France. Let\u2019s see. On December 16, 1944, the Germans\nlonc \u2014 lanced a \u2014 a counterattack 50 mile radius in the Ardennes. And let\u2019s see \u2014\nokay, and then when \u2014 wh-when we went into France, our first assignment was to\nguard the \u2014 hold the section of the Moose River, where the German attack was\nexpected, but on the t \u2014 the ti December 26, the fourth armored broke through the\nGerman lines, and we leave Bastogne, where the 101\u201c airborne had been \u2014 had\nsurrendered, and \u2014 and so the evening of December 31\u201c, ar \u2014 our division went to \u2014\nhad a 250 mile, or 150 mile march to \u2014 to Bastogne, where we were involved with\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the ban \u2014 Bastogne \u2014 what was it called?

That was our first area,\nand it snowed very heavy. And a patrol discovered over 101 infantry bodies dead.\nJanuary 13, 2015\nThey brought back an SS officer to our headquarters, and \u2014 and understanding\nYiddish, I attempted to interrogate him, but I wasn\u2019t too successful with the\nGerman, so they brought over interpreters from headquarters that took over, and \u2014\nand \u2014 and interviewed \u2014 inter \u2014 interrogated him. I noticed the captain of D\ncompany was angered with the discovery of the American dead bodies, and he took\nsome prisoners, lined them a \u2014 on the wall, and killed them.

So, I\u2014 I\u2014I can\u2019t tell you how I felt at the time. I think things lead\nup to what happens, and you take it as a matter of stride, I \u2014 I ge \u2014 I think.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I recall the various things I did when we ha \u2014 we set up a camp. I recall\nthat we had some German soldiers that we made KP, and I-I-I was guarding \u2014 at\none point I was \u2014 I was guarding \u2014 I \u2014I did a various \u2014 various things. But one \u2014 at\none time I \u2014I was guarding prisoners, I recall telling this German that he wasn\u2019t\ndoing a good job of cleaning the large soup vats, and he tried to \u2014 he says, I\u2019m\ndoing the best I can. And \u2014 and that ended that conversation. But I \u2014 I didn\u2019t really\nhave any direct contact, as such, with \u2014 with \u2014 with the German soldiers, other than,\nJanuary 13, 2015\nas I said, at one time I was there. O-Other times I would \u2014 I would go into a burnt\nout tank, and scrape the carcass from the inside, put it in a bag, cause we didn\u2019t\nwant to leave any s-soldiers behind, so \u2014",
        "A: These are \u2014 th-these are American, yeah. One of the tanks of \u2014 of one of our\ncompanies. So \u2014",
        "A: Yes. Yeah. Everything there was \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014 but we took things in stride. Soldiers\ndid their job. We \u2014 we \u2014 we did well, and after \u2014 after we left bast \u2014 Bastogne, we \u2014\nwe traveled south, and went through Luxembourg, and then Germany.",
        "A: Oh yes, of course. We\u2019re all fighting, as 1\u2014 as 1\u2014 as \u2014 as I remember, the main\nforce of Germans were defeated in the Bastogne area, and of course there\u2019s still\nplenty of fighting going on, and we ge \u2014 our \u2014 our division fought and engaged the\nenemies as we went down. And then when we got down to \u2014 near Austria, as a \u2014 as\nI told you, General Patton was the Third Army commander, and \u2014 and instructions\nwere that we weren\u2019t supposed to go into Austria. But Patton didn\u2019t like \u2014 didn\u2019t \u2014\ndidn\u2019t like that, and so we went into austr \u2014 Austria also. And that\u2019s where \u2014 okay,\nand as I said, the Russians were supposed to take over the \u2014 Austria, and \u2014 and\nJanuary 13, 2015\nPatton didn\u2019t like the \u2014 the Russians either. And so li \u2014 going down, one of our\ncompanies, one of the companies was making \u2014 was doing reconnaissance, and on\nthe road \u2014 on a certain road, a German Jeep with the German pa \u2014 the commander\nof \u2014 of \u2014 of the \u2014 of \u2014 of the camp, was coming towards them, a \u2014 with a white flag,\nand they surrendered. And it turns out he was telling them of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of\nMauthausen, that 1-it was \u2014 it was five miles back. And the reason they \u2014 they\nwanted \u2014 they \u2014 they gave up to us, is they didn\u2019t want the Russians, because the\nRussians would \u2014 would \u2014 would just kill them. And so that was how we learned of\n\u2014 of the concentration camp. The next morning, I went with the battalion\ncommander and the adjutant into the camp. That was my first seeing it. And of\ncourse, what I observed was piles of shoes, piles of other things. And course, lot of\ndead bodies. And then I went into the \u2014 into the camp, and I went into a particular \u2014\nwait a minute, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m losing words. But I went in and I spoke with some of the\nsurvivors. And I asked, is there anything that \u2014",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, English, yeah.",
        "A: And so, I said, is there anything I can do. And I recall several coming to me and\nsaying, could you write a letter to my relative in Chicago, if I remember that \u2014 that\nwas \u2014 that particular situation. And so I took the information, and I did write a letter\nto I\u2014I don\u2019t recall having an-any copies, so I \u2014 I don\u2019t know, bu-but this is my\nmemory, that I wrote a letter and told of that \u2014 that this person was safe.

        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, I saw \u2014 what \u2014 what happened was, the German \u2014 there was a big quarry,\nand the Germans got cement out of there. And what they \u2014 they used, they set up\nthis \u2014 th-this camp, with all the captured Jews that \u2014 that had to work in \u2014 in the\nJanuary 13, 2015\nquarries. And that is \u2014 that is how the camp came about. And the \u2014 the prisoners\nworked in the quarries, getting the cement or wha \u2014 wi \u2014 wi \u2014 the \u2014 w-with \u2014 wi \u2014\nwhich would be the cement that they would be making. So what was my first \u2014 I-I \u2014\nthis has been a long time, so I \u2014 I really \u2014 I really can\u2019t remember how I felt in \u2014 in\nseeing it.",
        "A: Well, what we did, wa \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 tho \u2014 our \u2014 our line companies went in, and\nof course, yes, there were Germans in there, and they all surrendered, of course.\nAnd of course our \u2014 our company \u2014 companies took them out, and we eventually\ntook them back to headquarters. But as I said, I was in the headquarters of the\nbattalion, and I didn\u2019t physically get involved with \u2014 with the soldiers there. We \u2014\nwe had our other \u2014 you know, others that were doing it.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, of course, of course. We have a \u2014 a medical battalion with us,\nand so they went in and did what they had to do, yes.\nJanuary 13, 2015",
