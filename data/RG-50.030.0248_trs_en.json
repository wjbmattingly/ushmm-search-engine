        "Q: So we'll start the interview by you telling us your name. Tell us about your family, and tell us\nabout your background.",
        "A: You mean from way back?",
        "Q: From way back. This is a long reach.",
        "A: Well, my name is Ernst Weiths, and I was born in Vienna in 1908. I am coming from a\ncompletely full Jewish background because my father was Jewish, my mother was Jewish,\nboth grandparents were Jewish. So, I was born in 1908. And, uh, I had a sister; she was born\nin 1914. And we lived in Vienna. My father was...actually my grandfather had a store in\nVienna; and my father was working with him. And he didn't like it. And, uh, he had, uh, two\nbrothers, one was engineer; and the younger was...uh a doctor. And he hated the store and he\nhated office work; but he became then an accountant later on, you know. And, uh, we were\ntogether-- the whole family was together 'til the war broke out in 1914. And then my father\nhad to go to war. And when he came back in 1918, he met somebody else. They met in\nSalzburg--that 1s close to Vienna. And when he came finally home, he was asking for a\ndivorce. So, we had these four years of war, we had hardly anything to eat. My mother had\nto go out in the country, exchange her rings and everything for food, what it was like at this\ntime. Everything was rationed. You had to get card or marks, cards for your food. You got\nfrozen potatoes and all that stuff. Anyway, then finally when he got his...uh his divorce, we\nstill--my sister and myself were still with my mother. Up until 19... until the time when I was\nll. And he didn't give her any child support or anything. She had to raise the two of us. And it\ncame the time when she just couldn't do it anymore, and told me that I have to go and live\nwith my father. So...and she kept my sister. So my father was in another state of Austria with\nhis new wife. They worked, uh both as accountants, for a company. And one day I packed a\nlittle suitcase and went on a train and went to see them, you know. And it was real...not very\ncomfortable for them, because nobody knew that he had a 11 year-old son. So he actually\ndidn't, uh, look forward to that very much. But he had no other choice. And, uh, so that I\nstayed with them and I went to school there. I mean, I finished elementary school in Vienna,\nand my mother let me go to--by the way, here you call it college, [but] it was gymnasium in\nVienna--in Vienna for one year. But I didn't do so good in Latin and Greek. So when I came\nto my father, first of all he didn't want to spend the money to go to a college or something.\nSo he said, \"I just...you just try to finish high school here, you know, and then we see.\" So in\nthe meantime uh they uh asked me to be baptized, because my stepmother was Lutheran.\nAnd when they married, my father became Lutheran too. So I got baptized over there when I\nwas 11 or 12, and I had my documents. Actually, I didn't have anything to do with being\nJewish from that age on, you know. From 11 on. I went to church; and we had religion\noutside with the Pastor and so on. So I stayed with them...uh 11, 12, 13, 14...when I was 14--\n'til I was 14. So, my father... I, myself, at that uh age, I didn't really know...know what I\nwanted to be later on, you know. I thought maybe I'd follow him and go in a school and learn\naccounting, or whatever. No he didn't...he didn't want that at all. He was...he hated his job.\nHe was more for nature. He loved flowers and animals--I mean, not animals, but fish. He\nloved fish and flowers. Cactus, actually. And he was...when we lived together with him, we\nhad the whole--even before, when he was still married to my real mother, he had the whole\nliving room full with aquariums, you know. With fish and everything. And every time he\nbought a new fish, he hid it behind him and sneaked it in; because my mother didn't want\nhim to spend the money. They were very expensive, and we didn't hardly have enough\nmoney to live on. So when he was with his other wife, he did the same thing. He had these\naquariums all over the house; and he had the windows covered with flower pots and\neverything. And he wanted me not to go in a office...work in an office. Go out and be in the\noutside, in nature. So one day they went on vacation to Germany and they went to all\nthis...the biggest nurseries that there are in Germany. And finally he found me a place to\nlearn, to begun, in a nursery, in...1n Kempten there. Close to Munich. You know, in Bavaria.\nSo but I thought maybe it's alright. I was real skinny, not strong as anything. And they came\nback, picked me up and took me there to that nursery. Was only the boss, his wife, and they\nhad a daughter which was a little younger than I was.",
        "Q: How old were you at that time?",
        "A: I was 14. When you have to learn this job, you have to learn 3 years; and in these 3 years,\nthey gave me a room and board, you know, and no money. You didn't...you don't get paid for\nit. You're learning. So...but I had to get up at 6:00 in the morning; I was already out there,\nworking. And I was...I wasn't strong or anything, but I made it, you know. Carried this big\nstuff around and worked in the greenhouse, worked outside. And my boss was...he was an\nexcellent nursery man, a gardener. He was the best in the city. But at home, he was the\nworst. He beat his wife up every other day. (Laughing) So this girl and myself, we grew up\nin that milieu, you know. And she was, I think, only 2 years younger than I was. And I had to\nwork 6:00 in the morning, and even some...most of the time until 9:00 in the evening. And\nuh when it was dark outside, come in the shed and I had to cut the wood, you know. And so\non. And then when he came home from drinking, he said, \"You can go now.\" To sleep, you\nknow. And then he was full of hard going, he came back at 11:00 back from the...from\nthe...back from the gardens, from the greenhouse. And he then he went up and hear beating\nup again and again. Oh, well, it was terrible. But I... And then, of course, when I came there,\nthe first few months I was crying every night. I was homesick. And my parents in the\nmeantime got transferred back to Vienna from that place where they used to work out in\nanother state. So they stayed in Vienna. And uh well, after 3 years he wanted me to stay on\nand he would pay me. And I said, \"No, I don't want to stay any longer.\" In that job, you go\nfrom nursery to nursery to learn more and more and more. So he got me a job in another one\nabout Augsburg. Augsburg is about three hours by train. And I stayed there. That uh was\nnice, you know. The people that worked in the nurseries, most of them, they stayed in; they\ngot their bed and their food and everything there. So I stayed there. Another couple of years,\nI moved on to Stuttgart--which is Germany, too. And I stayed there another couple of years.\nAnd then--I think 1t was 1928--I came back to Vienna. And, uh, my father and my\nstepmother had a nice apartment off in the suburbs, and I had a room there. But my work\nwas on the other side of the city. It was one of the biggest nurseries in Vienna at that time. So\nI worked there, but I had to go back and forth. And after awhile, it was too much; so I got my\nown room close by about 5 minutes from the nursery. And I had my own room and\neverything. And I made my money there. And some days, holidays when I was off, I went\nhome. They did my laundry at home and everything; and over the weekend I stayed home.\nAnd then I went back to work. So, that went on from 1928 to 1938. I was there 10 years.",
        "Q: Working in gardens?",
        "A: In the nursery.",
        "Q: Had you seen your mother during that time?",
        "A: Yah. My mother was...my mother, my sister were living about...very close by to where I was\nworking. I saw her off and on, and went out with them sometimes, you know. I saw her up\n'til 1939. So I worked in the nursery 'til 1938; and then Hitler came and, uh, everything\nchanged. But I was working. Nobody knew that I had a Jewish background, because I had\nmy, I went to church and everything. They all didn't know about it. And, uh.... Not the\npeople where I used to...where I had my room, and not the people where I worked. They\ncouldn't believe this. Then in 1939, the officials out there where I worked came and told the\nman that I was living with that \"You have a Jew up there in the room, you know, living with\nyou.\" And the guy--he was an engineer--he was already part of the party there, you know.\nAnd he said, \"What, what are you talking about? You must be crazy. Mr. Weihs? No. No\nway!\" So he said, \"Well, let's go up and find out.\" So they came up there and asked me my\nbackground; and I had to say \"Yah.\" I mean, I myself was already Lutheran for uh so many\nyears; but that didn't help, that doesn't help, you know. As long as you were Jewish and your\nparents were Jewish, that's it, you know.",
        "Q: In '38, did you begin to fear that this might happen to you?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: In '38, when Hitler came to power, did you fear that was going to happen to you?",
        "A: Well, first we all thought it will be okay, they will leave us alone you know. And people\nwere screaming already; my mother--my real mother--said, \"If he only let us scream with\nthem!\" (Laughing) But he didn't, you know. I mean, the people of Vienna, they uh were, of\ncourse, on his side. And they hated the Jews for centuries, you know. They were glad they\nhad a chance to get rid of them. So these people came up, and said he had to let me go. I can't\nstay in his house. And in the nursery, the guy...they couldn't believe it, you know. I just, I\nsaid, \"Well, I am sorry, but I have to quit. I have to quit.\"",
        "Q: How had they found out? They had gone and searched your records?",
        "A: I guess, yah. In Austria, your driver's license is not enough. You know, you got to fill\nout...and the police wherever, what you leave, every time you move, you have to register.\nThey know exactly what was going on, you know. And uh so I had to quit, and...uh the job\nand the room. But--I forgot to tell you--in '37 before Hitler came, my father passed away. He\nhad a gall bladder operation and didn't make it. So my stepmother was living alone out in the\nsuburbs; and I moved...I lived on with her up to, oh, in '39. And uh...so I didn't have a job; I\ndidn't have... I mean, the people out there, they didn't like the idea either, that some Jewish\npeople lived there, you know.",
        "Q: You said in '38 everything changed when Hitler came to power. Could you tell us some of\nthe things that changed?",
        "A: Well, first of all, everybody had to wear the star, you know. Whoever was Jewish had to\nwear the star.",
        "Q: You, too?",
        "A: Yah, sure! And uh...I mean, most of the time we just covered it up when we could get away\nwith it, you know. But if they catched you, that was...that would of be terrible, but... Then\nfinally, you know, they closed Jewish stores, they started deporting Jewish... And uh I...I was\nhome, and for a little... Yah, the thing was that I was registered Jewish in the Viennese\nKultursgemeinde there. At the same time, I had my paper that said I am Lutheran, you know.\nSo I actually two chances to get out of Vienna, either with ...on the Jewish side or on the\nLutheran side. But uh my mother wanted me...tried to get me to Palestine, but it never came\nto it. You know, at that time they were smuggling the people out. My real mother. And uh on\nthe other side--the Lutheran side--I was registered 1n...there was a Swedish mission for\nJewish people, and I registered there. So the Jewish uh side wants send me outside Vienna.\nThere was a farm where they trained youngsters for farming and then send...maybe they\ncould get to Palestine. So I worked there, I think, one summer. Milking the cows and cutting\nthe hay; and all that stuff, you know. (Laughing)",
        "Q: A Jewish Agency, HeChalutz? Which group did this? Do you know?",
        "A: That was...they called it...was the Kultursgemeinde in Vienna.",
        "Q: So the Kultursgemeinde sent you to the farm.",
        "A: Yah, right. And then I got a card from the Lutheran people, from the Swedish mission, I\nshould come to an interview. And they were sending people to Sweden, you know. They had\ntransports to Sweden. So I came back from the camp; and I went to this...it was a Pastor that\nwas running the whole thing.",
        "A: Do you know where he was from?",
        "A: From the Lutheran church, under the Swedish mission. And he said, \"Well, we'll take all\nyour dates and maybe we can get you uh on a transport. But right now, there is nothing\ngoing. We have to wait. In meantime, if you want to, we have a heim [Ger: home] for the\nelderly--old Jewish people--and maybe 3 houses in Vienna.\" They bought a big estate and\nwith little rooms, and they had the people staying there. \"If you want to, you could go out\nthere and work for us.\" They had a huge garden to take care of, you know. \"And you could\nwork there 'til we have a chance to get you on a train, you know, out.\"",
        "Q: And who ran this? Who ran this place?",
        "A: It was a Swedish Deaconess, she was connected with that Swedish mission from Stockholm,\nand she was running that home for the elderly. So I went there, and I got my room. And there\nwas a girl there that also worked to clean the rooms, and have everything help in the kitchen;\nand she became my wife, you know. We were the only young ones there. So we worked and\nworked, and went out together. And finally, we got engaged. She came from Vienna, too.\nHer parents had a different story. Her mother was Catholic. Her father was Jewish. The\nSwedish mission people baptized her Lutheran...(laughing) in 1938, I think it was. So she\nwas what they then...they called \"Mischlinge.\" Half this and half that. So they promised her,\ntoo, she could get a chance to go to Sweden. And in the meantime, she took that job out\nthere. So we worked together. She made up all the beds in the morning and this, and helped\nwith the water; every morning have to carry up in the morning. And then I worked in the\ngarden there. They had fruit trees, and they were huge. And they had all these nice old\npeople there, and we always entertained them. And then I was the one that had to go down in\nthe village and always get the food. And we had cards, you know, take up for so much\nbutter, so much meat, for so much this.",
        "Q: Ration cards?",
        "A: Yes. And I had a backpack and a bicycle. So I was going into the city, buying everything,\ncome back and bring the food. Up to the time where the villagers said, \"No, he can't come\nanymore. He is Jewish. He can't come anymore. We don't want him here.\" I mean, the people\nthat run the stores, they wanted me, you know. They were good with us. But Mayor and all\nthese people, they...they were strong Nazi and they didn't want that. So the Swedish sister,\nthe Deaconess, had to go and do the job, with the shopping and all that stuff. So that went on.\nSo in the meantime, we got engaged. It was uh '39. I came...I met her--my wife--in August\n'39, when I came working there. And we stayed there...'40,'41. Two years. And her father\nwas with us. He had to leave his wife; otherwise, she would lose the apartment in Vienna,\nyou know. My wife's father.",
        "Q: He was Jewish and the mother was Catholic?",
        "A: He was Jewish, and the mother was Catholic. So the mother could keep the apartment; and\neven my future wife, she could have stayed with her mother. But she went with her father.\nAnd uh...so finally we got engaged. And in 1941, they...uh people said it has to be closed.\nThe whole thing, all the people had to go out in the village. They closed down the home.\nAnd the Swedish mission had a huge building in Vienna itself, you know, where they had\napartments and offices and stuff like that. All of the empty spaces, they made something like\na hospital on the ground floor where we all had to move to Vienna. The old people, they\nwere all in the 80s--70s, 80s. They had women, most of them there. And someone of them\nhad to be in bed; and some of them got apartments in the house. And uh we still were taking\ncare of them; and there was...uh each apartment had its own uh stove. I had carry the coal up\nthere and take care of these people. And we fed them there too. We had a kitchen where they\nhad cooked; and they was all supplied from Sweden, the food, you know. Okay, so then\ncame 1940, then came spring of '42. In Spring of '42, there was another organization from\nHolland. And this...they were helping people that got evacuated to pack and go to. There was\none school that was just for people to get ready there and for the train to go. So in order to\nstay a little longer...and they said if I help them I could probably be protected a little more.\nSo we had to go out with the German soldiers to Jewish homes in the night, you know, make\nthe people pack--they at least who is going to go--and get ready and help them 'til the truck\ncame and then loaded them up. And, of course, there were terrible situations, you know. The\nchildren started crying. And the children were not home one night. We were sitting through\nthe morning one night, and they insisted the kid has go with them; and we waited with the\nGestapo there. And I did this for another year while my wife was still in that house with the\nmission. And then...",
        "Q: Before you go to \"and then...,\" back up a little, please. Tell us about...tell us the name of this\norganization. Tell us how it worked within...you said the Germans really controlled it. Tell\nus about that.",
        "A: The Germans what?",
        "Q: You said the Germans really controlled this, but it was a Dutch organization. What was the\nname of this?",
        "A: The Germans just let them do it, you know. One was a Swedish organization, a Swedish\nmission; and the other one was Dutch.",
        "Q: What was it called?",
        "A: And they were called Guildemester. They brought food and they fed the people and helped\nthem with clothes, and so. But they all had to be closed uh in 19...1n the spring of 1942. And\nfinally, we all had to go.",
        "Q: Where?",
        "A: From Vienna. So they took us in this school, where everybody gets ready for transporting.\nThere was uh...but my wife and her father were still in Vienna; but myself and our friends,\nmostly men, we had to leave Vienna. And...with a suitcase. And they took us to\nCzechoslovakia.",
        "Q: What did they tell you? How did they tell you that you had to leave and why?",
        "A: Well, they came...they came one day and said, \"You have to be on this and this date there\nand there.\" And that's it, you know. There was not an invitation. It was just, \"Do it, or else!\"\nSo we were all put on a train, and went to a city was called Theresienstadt [NB: Terezin].\nYou probably heared about that. That was old military city, with kasernes [Ger: \"barracks\" ].\nThere were no more soldiers; and it was made up like a ghetto, you know. People came from\nall over the places. And the men were living in one of these big houses. The women, the\nothers. And during the day, they worked...we worked on the railroad; unloading the coal,\nwhatever came for the ghetto. And some of them they had their own locker, lumber shops,\nand everything. It was like a...like a city by itself, you know.",
        "Q: Had you heard of it before? Did you know when you were going there what it was like?",
        "A: Yah. No, we didn't know what it was like. We hear about it, that there 1s a ghetto in\nCzechoslovakia, but we didn't know what it was about. We had our own money, you know,\nown stores and everything like a...like Columbia here, you know. Everything was wants.",
        "Q: How did you live? Tell us about, you talked about having money and going to a store. What\nkind of stores were you in?",
        "A: Well, I mean the money didn't mean nothing because everything was, you could only get\nbread or this or that, in rationed. Everything was rationed, you know. And uh...then later on,\nwe were allowed to get packages from home, which was something. We had big kitchens\nwhere cooking and where we could eat for dinner, for lunch and dinner, you know. But uh it\nwas like a black market afterwards, you know. The Czechoslovakian people, the people that\nworked on the railroad, they sold you uh cigarettes and they smuggled out our letters home.\nAnd uh a lot of them were really with us, instead of against us. So we struggled through; and\nuh it was not too bad actually. The old people, after a few weeks, they were all gone. They\ndied.",
        "Q: Of illness or degradation?",
        "A: Of malnutrition and diarrhea, and stuff like that. They just, they just...you know, they were\nlaying on the floors, and they just couldn't make it. And the food, they didn't get, they didn't\nget too much. But we were still young and we got, later on we got help from home, you\nknow, with bread and stuff like that.",
        "Q: Was your wife with you?",
        "A: No. My wife was still in Vienna. I was there in early '42. And then they told them in Vienna,\nthey told, \"You can join your people. And this is like a working place where you can be. And\nuh you can be with your fianc\u00e9, with your husband, with your father, whatever.\" So what did\nshe do? Instead of staying with her mother, her father had to go. So she went with her father,\nand came a half a year later. And I am standing there shovelling the coal off the...on the\nrailroad, and where they coming out. They coming out from the train. And I said that and I\nsee them close there; and I said, \"Why didn't you stay with your mother?\" \"No, I want to be\nwith you and with my father.\" So we stayed together for another, I think, another half year or\nalmost a year. And we were living separate, but we could see each during the...just normally.\nWe even got married there.",
        "Q: Describe that for us.",
        "A: We had our own Mayor and everything.",
        "Q: Did you elect him?",
        "A: Yah, the people elect him. And then uh I mean there were a lot of people come up from the\nKultursgemeinde that came with us. So they took over right away. And so they had uh ...and\nI don't know how it was, we...they had the nicest dresses you could buy there; you know, on\nthe black market, or something. I can't even remember how it worked. We were really good\ndressed, and we had our friends. And we went...she went from her house and I from my\nhouse to get married there. And I went down the street to that house and there was a alarm,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Watch tower?",
        "A: A air alarm. So we both, I had to duck in the house somewhere, and she had to duck. When\nthe alarm was over, we made. It was like a real ceremony there, you know. And then we\nhad...there was a caf\u00e9 in the ghetto, and we and our friends went there and celebrated. And\neverything seemed to look like normal. I mean, everything that we brought in our luggage uh\nwas confiscated, you know. They had big uh buildings where they stored all the clothes and\nall the shoes and all this...the jewelry. It all was gone. But we had ...we could--I don't know\nhow it was--we still could buy things to... There were seamstresses, and we made...made\ndresses and so.",
        "A: It wasn't like a country club. I mean, there were guards...?",
        "Q: Yah, there were guards. Sure. We were all...when we went off to the railroad to get the stuff,\nthere was always soldiers with us. And in the streets. And there was a SS commander there,\nyou know. So anyway, it was, uh, fall of '42. And they came and said, \"So and so many men\nhave to go to Germany.\" And they had places where they should work, and they need them.\nAnd then they just called our names. And whoever they wanted. And gathered us up; and we\nhad to say goodbye to everybody. My wife was still there. Her father was still there. I had to\nleave them. And we went on a train. And the funny thing was, when we went on the train, he\nsaid we go to Germany but we went through Vienna. We looking out the...this windows, and\nhere we are in Vienna. If we just could jump out, we would be home again, you know. But\nwe couldn't. So from...from Austria, they went back and went up to Poland, and ended up in\nAuschwitz.",
        "Q: Just a second. Tell me...take a little longer to describe the train trip to Auschwitz. What kind\nof a train were you 1n?",
        "A: Well, it was what you call the box cars, you know. Where you usually transport cows or\nwhatever, you know. We had a little straw in there, and they locked them up from the\noutside. And uh all of us, we got a piece of bread when we got in the train.",
        "Q: What was it like?",
        "A: It was terrible. Because it was a lot of people in there, hot; some of them started crying, some\nof them screaming, some of them fainting. But, anyway, we made it to Auschwitz. We came\nthere in middle in the night.",
        "Q: Did you know what that meant?",
        "A: No, we didn't have no idea at the time, you know. Anyway, we...was a whole train full of\ncars...uh, railroad cars. And the soldiers and the lights and the captain--or whatever was the\nofficer standing there--like they say, left, right, left, right. That's how we had all to jump\ndown, in rows of six, and march in front of him. And uh we were a group of people that\nknew each other from Vienna for so long, we...we always stick together. I had my friend and\nhis wife and her two brothers. One was I think 12 and one was 16. So we came in, to that\nright for him; and that little brother was already...we never saw him again, you know. And\nthe rest of us went in the camp. And the ones that were actually the worst were the Polish\nJews that the SS put in charge of this barracks, you know. They were hitting us and\nscreaming. They were worse than the Germans for a while, you know. So we, first of all, we\nhad to go in these barracks, and the next thing was: \"Take everything off. Take a shower.\"\nAnd then they gave us this striped shirt and pants coming out. You had to go to the barber,\ncut all your hair off, and then you came out. And when we came out I said to my friend,\n\"Where is uh this guy?\" And he said, \"He is right here behind you.\" We didn't recognize\neach other anymore, you know. All the hair was gone. And the uniform. So they put us\ntogether in these barracks and that was the first couple of days. When it was time to get out\nof the barrack, we made a...there were about 50 and they stood one close to the other one in a\ncircle and we were going just like this just to keep ourselves warm, you know, all together.\nAnd we saw the chimneys and everything; but we didn't really, the first time, know what was\ngoing on. Until we found out, we didn't get this little boy with us any more, and so, and then\nthe other ones told us all these people go into the gas chamber. So a couple of days later,\nwhat happened? All the women came. They told them in Theresienstadt, \"You can join your\nhusbands or fathers. They working there in Germany. You can join them and it will be just\nlike here.\" My wife was among the first to go. Again, and her girlfriend, you know. So one\nday, everything was fenced. We saw them a little bit across from us. No hair. Just like us.\nThat was the last time we saw each other, you know. And we...a little group of us, were...I\ndon't know, we were just lucky. They were looking for men to work in another labor camp.\nThey didn't give us...even give us any numbers. I think it was only a week that we stayed\nthere.\u2019 And then they, uh, packed us up again in the trains and took us to...I remember now\nwhat the city was, next to Dachau. It was Kaufering.\u201d Kaufering was the city, you know.\nAnd there was a uh labor camp, and that 1s where they took us. So we didn't know where our\nwives were anymore. We just got out of Auchwitz in between a week or two weeks,\nsomething like that.",
        "Q: What was the basis for selection, do you know?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: What was the basis for the selection? Why did they choose you for that?",
        "A: Well, they choose us, I guess, by the strength of the bodies, you know. That people they\ncould work, but I can't even remember what they put us to work. I know where I worked.\nLuck again: I worked out in the fields to bring in the potatoes and the cabbage and all that\nstuff. Some of them worked in the camp. Some of them worked in close-by factories, I think.\nAnd there were all men only, in that camp.",
        "Q: Old men? Oh, all men.",
        "A: All men. No...no woman. So we--our group of friends--we stick together again. My friend\nwas assigned to the kitchen, and so he could once awhile putting something to eat. We had\nthis little barracks. You know this was, was a roof of grass, covered with grass; then you go a\nfew steps down, the door, and there is the wood, and you lay on it... on a blanket, on this\nwooden...",
        "Q: Platforms?",
        "A: ...platforms, yah.",
        "Q: How many people in a barrack?",
        "A: Oh, I guess we must have been 40 in a barrack, at least. One of them...we were not long\nthere, and one of them hanged himself. In the morning we waked up, and the guy was\nE.g., in Auschwitz.\n; Subcamp of Dachau.\nhanging next to me. He couldn't stand it any more.",
        "Q: Did that happen a lot?",
        "A: Well, I guess. Now what happened a lot was--what I never could understand--that friends of\nmine--6 feet tall, 200 pounds, really strong guys--they died away like flies. And we were just\nmedium, not...not really strong. We just made it. My friend was in the hospital, I think, 2 or 3\ndays; then he came out and never again. But some other ones from our group, they just...you\nknow, diarrhea came and...",
        "Q: Were you starved? The diet?",
        "A: No, we didn't have much to eat. We had cabbage soup, you know, and the bread... Almost\nnothing. But like me, I was out in the fields and we had these big coats. It was...it was fall. It\nwas cold. We had a big coat, and the coat had big pockets inside. I put the potatoes in there,\nyou know. And we came home--the soldiers already knew what we were doing, I think. And\neach barracks had a little stove where we could make a fire. And put the potatoes in the\nashes. And when everything was quiet, around 11 or 12 at night, we started eating the\npotatoes. I guess, and somehow... And cabbage. Somehow, that kept us going I think. And\nthe other guys, if... As soon as you got sick, you were done. Got very diarhea, or whatever it\nwas. There were only skeletons anymore. And it was in the winter then, in November. And\nthey made us, we were...we had to go out with a 2 wheeler you know. We had to pack all\nthese dead bodies on the 2 wheeler. And we see my friend here, my friend here. I mean, up\nhere, they were there. Just skeletons. Frozen stiff, you know. It was cold at that time. No\nclothes, nothing on. So we had to put them on the 2 wheeler, go out in the fields with the\nsoldier, dig the holes, and just put them in there. Cover them up. And then later on, we didn't\neven have anymore uh...uh room. We had to carry them to another camp to be buried there\nor burned, I don't know. Anyway, we had one guy that was, on his own free will, went to\nanother camp to work. And then he came with a troop of people back; and he was...we had to\nempty these cars, and they were on this straw in there. And some of the guys were laying\ndead and the other ones hardly could get up off the car. And when they came to the camp, I'll\nnever forget that. They came like ghosts, you know, swaying like this, only a little littler\nthen. A whole group of people looking at us. And fall. Then they came 1n, and I had to give\nthem cups of water. They went on their knees crawling to us, that cup of water. And then\nthey fed them. Most of them, I think, didn't make it. And then we had uh people come in.\nAnd we had people come in from all over, from France and everywhere. And then the Red\nCross was sending uh packages. And uh they came the packages and some broke open; and\nthey had dried beans and peas in there. And these guys were storming against this stuff,\neating this dried...dried beans. A lot of them ate grass, you know. From the barracks, they ate\nthe grass. I actually never got in that bad a situation. I always had my potatoes and soup; and\nthen we made it that way. Anyway. And next to our camp, was a railway going from\nKaufering to Dachau, where the Germans transported their troops and material and\neverything else.",
        "Q: Before you tell us about that, we are going to have to change tape.",
        "A: Oh! I am going too long already.",
        "Q: It will only take a moment.",
        "A: Oh.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTAPE #2",
        "A: We were not allowed to cook. There were some other...there were bread and stuff in there. I\ndon't what happened, what actually was in there, all of 1t. But I know it spilled, and these\nguys were grabbing and putting that stuff in their mouths.",
        "Q: We are rolling again.",
        "A: Oh, okay. So, then it was...that went on 'til, oh, spring of '45. I was there 'til spring of '45.",
        "Q: Kaufering?",
        "A: In Kaufering. After...then one day, they said we have to evacuate. The camp is going to be\nclosed, and they going to take us to Dachau. So we got our clothes, we didn't have anything\nelse, and we got our piece of bread, and we started marching. It was, I think, it was two days,\nwe should have marched. We...we marched about 2 hours. And it was hill up; and you could\nsee from the hill down to the camp, and all was uh...the whole thing went up in flames. You\nknow, the American bombers bombed the camp plus the railroad. They were waiting to cut\noff the railroad bridge from there to Munich, so the Germans couldn't transport their stuff.\nAnd they must have known all the time that there was a camp, a labor camp there.\nOtherwise, they never touched it. They flew over us a lot of times. And that moment we\nwent out, two hours later, everything went up in flames. So we started marching through the\nwoods towards Dachau. In the meantime, the soldiers that were supposed to watch us...half\nof them disappeared. It was almost May, it was April '45. And the other ones took everything\noff, their medals and signs. And nobody paid any attention to us. So we were marching in a\nlong line. And we were a group of my friends and a couple of other ones. His cousin and a\ncouple of other ones. He said, \"I don't know. Maybe we better don't go to Dachau. I don't\nknow. They might kill us in the last minute there, you know, before they...before they give\nup.\" So one time in the afternoon, we went along in the line and got a curb where no soldier\ncould actually see us. And the five of us, I think it was, jumped on the side in the pit and\nhide...were hiding. 'Til they were out of sight. Nobody cared how many in the group any\nmore. So then we got out. We started marching and uh we didn't know where we were going,\nhow far we are from Dachau. And we go on that street; here comes a German woman on a\nbicycle and we said, \"What is going on?\" She said, \"The Armies are coming. The Army. The\nArmy are here.\" We said, \"Well, that's good.\" And we hear shooting. In the...in the next\nvillage we hear still shooting going on. So we went there towards that village, and we\nducked out when the...when they started shooting, and then we come, we came to the middle\nof the city, of the, of that village. And here were all the American tanks, the soldiers sitting\non the tanks smoking their cigarettes and having a good time. And then all of the sudden,\nthere came some airplanes and so everybody ducked. But it was American airplanes, you\nknow. So what we going to do? My friend was able to speak a little English. So they took us\nto the commandant; and they took us in a hospital. They thought we have to recover. We\ndidn't look too bad, but still. We were laying in that hospital a few hours. Wounded German\nsoldiers; and we were laying if front of them, and they didn't actually know who we are. And\nhere comes the nurses. \"Oh,\" they started crying, \"the American soldiers... The end... Too\nmany died already...\" And this and this. And we are in the middle of this German hospital.\nThat was a terrible situation, you know? But the nurses were nice to us. I don't know whether\nthey knew who we are or not. But anyway, they took care of us. And we were actually not\nsafe. We were just resting from the...from the trip from Kaufering to there.",
        "Q: Can you talk about being in a German hospital. The Americans put you in a German\nhospital?",
        "A: Yah, they occupied everything then, you know. But they had 3 German nurses and\neverything and German wounded soldiers were there, you know. So we were there, I think, a\nweek or longer. While we were there, the Americans completely took over the city. And all\nthe guys that got free from the labor camps, they went down in the basements, opened the\nwine barrels. There were that fine wine. Took all of anything they could eat, you know. And,\nactually, we missed the whole thing, you know. When we came out, everything was\norganized. And they were...I think you can say they were looting, as I remember. The\nGermans were really scared then. The people that lived there. And there was a whole\nAmerican outfit there, a battalion or whatever it was, you know. And when we came out,\n[they] gave us...they put us in a school. And there was one...you can call it a restaurant--not a\nrestaurant, but a inn or something--where we could go and eat...eat lunch and dinner. They\neven had dance in the evening. And they made it as nice as possible for us, you know. 'Til\nend of May or June. And then they had transportation to Munich for us. And there you could\nstay again; and where were you supposed to...want to go home, and you could go with the\ntrain home. There was no need for money or anything. I don't know, I was hanging around\nthere a long time. I had a friend...I met a guy there. Uh, he was from Spain. Another\n\"inmate,\" so to speak. And we...I didn't know what to do. Should I go back to Vienna or...?\nHe said he is going to go to Spain, and I should go with him and live. And I didn't know\nwhat...what happened to my wife. I had no idea. But then my friends, they all went back to\nVienna. So I took a...went on a train, went back too. And I came to my stepmother's\napartment; and the owner of the house wanted her to move out. Because one part of the...of\nthe floor was his, and the other part was hers; and he wanted the whole thing together again.\nSo she wanted me to stay with her as long as I...as a captive, from... As I was living with her,\nhe couldn't do anything about evacuating her or telling her to get out. But in the meantime, I\nfound out that my wife was with her mother in a little city close by of Vienna. It's about 2\nhour drive back by train to Vienna, uh from Vienna to Baden. It's called Baden-by-Vienna.\nSo I said, \"Well, I can't just stay here. I have to see where my wife is.\" At that time, my\nstepmother and my wife didn't get along too good. In the first place, my stepmother didn't\nwant me to marry her. And when this was all done...I mean, it was in Theresienstadt when\nwe got married, but that was nothing official. It was not...the state didn't recognize that\nmarriage, you know. But anyway, I said to her I had to look her [NB: his wife] up. So I went\nto Baden. That there was a small city close to Vienna. Actually, it is not so small. The people\ncome there from all over the world. They have this thermal baths. And she was there 1n her\nmother's sister's house, they were living. And her mother's sister was living in another city.\nThey had their own house there. So she was living there. And I had a uh piece of paper from\nthe Russians, that I was released from Dachau and so, in Russian. I think I gave it to the...;\nlast time, I sent it. So the Russians were actually in that sector of Austria,patrolling the city\nof Baden, you know. It was in four parts. It was Aus...Russians, English, French and, uh...",
        "Q: Americans.",
        "A: Yah, Americans. So I showed him this on the street. He let me go. So I went up there. And\nmy mother-in-law...my wife wasn't there. And she was scared. She didn't even want to let me\nin, because I was looking different. She said. \"Is it really you?\" She looked up from the\nwindow outside, \"Is it really you?\" \"Yes, [Eva (ph)], let me in.\" Finally, she got convinced\nthat it's me. She let me in. And then my wife came in the evening. And she looked, of\ncourse... Her hair was only that long. And so we were together again. But food! There was\nno food. We had beans and bread everyday. There was no food to get. Hard to get. And she\nlooked...she was very skinny. I mean, while I was getting out of that--the city where I was\nstaying next to Dachau was Furstenfeldbruck, I told you that. That was an air base, a former\nGerman air base. And she was...when she left Auschwitz...they took her away from\nAuchwitz, they took her to Czechoslovakia in a camp. Belsen, I think.\u201d So with her girl\nfriend, she was there. And she was miserable there. She almost died. She...they lost her\nshoes. And it was cold, they had to march in the snow. They had a factory where these girls\nhad to work. They had for hardly to eat. She had only 2 holes here, a big hole here. But she\nhad one good thing. Her cheeks were always red, whether she was sick or well, or what. So\nwhen the doctor was patrolling the barracks and she was laying there, her friends said, \"No,\nshe is alright. She is feeling okay. She's just a little tired or something.\" So they let her go.\nOtherwise, if you were a little sick there, they took you away. So she made it. And when it\ncame to May '45, and when the camp was open, she came to Vienna on a train was full of\nRussian soldiers. But she said they were real nice, didn't do anything to them. Probably they\nlooked too ugly, didn't want to do anything to them. (Laughing) And she went home and\nstayed with her mother. So when I came, we were together again. But in Vienna--it was '45--\nit was not pleasant. It was demolished very much from the bombs, you know. So everything\nwas...half of Vienna was in ruins except the steeple, churches and some museums, stuff they\ndidn't touch. The [Vienna State] Opera even got a little bombed. And the apartment where\nher mother was living in Vienna--when we got back, one wall of the house was gone. It was\nopen. And the living room had a piano there standing, and her mother saw this. And this\npiano was just right on the wall ready to fall down. But, you know, they repaired everything,\nof course. It looks beautiful now. But uh we couldn't stay there so that's why she was in that\nuh city of Baden. That's why she was staying there. But the two of us...1n '46, the Swedish\nMission came back. They got their house back and uh...uh they opened up kitchens for the\nschool children all over Vienna for lunch. They feed the children. And the simplest part of\nthe whole thing were all the people were living was that house that the mission owned. And\nthey took over one...one big...used to be uh... Not a castle; was a big thing--Luxemburg,\nSchloss Luxemburg it was called. They used it as magazines [NB: warehouse] for storing the\n* Bertgen-Belsen is in Germany.\nfood and everything. And so they took us. We went back to them. We got an apartment\nupstairs. I was taking care of the whole house as far as the cellar where the food was. I had to\nbring the food to the kitchen; they had a huge kitchen there and everything. Taking care of\nthe...I had to...they had...like they had this little, they had this stoves. But not, you know, the\nbig ones made out of uh, of uh...",
        "Q: Tiles?",
        "A: Tiles. Yah. So I had to serve all these people with this coal from down the . They had the big\nthing out behind, going up and down there, didn't have an elevator there. And so we were\nliving with them. We had our food, every night we invited somebody else of our friends to\ncome for dinner; because in Vienna there was...was so terrible then. Nobody had something\nto eat. We had the food of... they had plenty of everything, like in peace time, yah. So we\nstayed with them for quite a while. Then my wife got a job working in the...in the bank\nwhere she used to work before she was evacuated. And she worked there, and our girl went\nto nursery school there. And I was working in the house still with them.",
        "Q: In a couple of minutes: you mentioned your girl went to nursery school. Talk about when the\nbaby was born.",
        "A: When she was born. In '47. Yah, '47; when we was still there. And my wife never forgave\nme this: I look at the baby, and I said, \"My God, we got a little monkey here.\" Oh, she was\nso upset! (Laughing) She never...she always mentions that. But now she 1s a pretty girl. But\num then... She was born in '47, and we stayed with them 4 more years 'til she was 4. And\nthen my mother and my sister left Vienna in '39. They got out to New York. They got to\nNew York. They send us what they call a \"affidavit,\" you know, to come. They wanted us to\ncome. And friends of ours went a year before us, and they were writing us letters: \"How\nbeautiful...! How beautiful...! Sunday, we go with our car. Our radio is playing. And it is just\nout of this world!\" And when we came here, they had a Pontiac! (Laughing) But they were\nhappy; they were living in a basement. But anyway, the story...yah...",
        "Q: What happened to your father?",
        "A: He died in '37. He died before the camp, my father. And my stepmother...my stepmother\nbought her own apartment; and later on she had to leave where she was living. She had her\nown apartment. And I didn't have really a job, a profession, and didn't pick up my profession\nanymore, so my wife said, \"Why don't we go? Your mother is writing so much about\nAmerica. Why don't we try?\" And we figured out: well, our girl was 4...we come over here,\nshe has a brand new future and it might be a lot better for her to be here than in Vienna. [In\nVienna,| we never knew what's was going on. At that time, it was bad...was bad time in\nVienna, you know.",
        "Q: How bad?",
        "A: Well, food-wise. You know?",
        "Q: You're still talking food.",
        "A: Well, food-wise. And jobs, you know, there was... Everything was ruined, most everything it\nwas. I probably could have gotten back my job where I used to work in that nursery.\n[Vent(ph]), his father died and he took over. A whole year: \"Come back, come back. We\nneed you. We need you.\" But he wouldn't give me...he said, \"I got only a small room for you,\nbut it wouldn't be enough for you and your wife.\" So we would have been separated again.\nShe didn't want that.",
        "Q: Was there...was there...? How did it feel to be a Jew in Vienna, then?",
        "A: Oh, afterwards? Well, nobody paid any attention anymore. I mean, the two of us...we figured\nwe are Lutheran again, you know. And, yah, we got married in Vienna. That deaconess from\nthe mission, she knew the Pastor from the Lutheran congregation in Vienna. And we got a\nreal official marriage again, you know, in church. And we had to register with the...you\nknow, in the...where you get the license and everything. So everything was done the right\nway then, you know. Because that marriage in Theresienstadt was actually a ghetto marriage\nthat nobody would accept really, you know. So she said, \"Why don't we go?\" And we\npacked up. Yah, we had to go register with the consular; the American consular, you know,\nin Vienna. And they took us, we could have our luggage with us, you know, crates. We took\na couple of crates with us with dishes and all kind of stuff. And they took us to a camp in\nHamburg, Germany, to stay until a ship was available for us. And then we went to the United\nStates with uh a former military ship, you know. So we were separated again, the men and\nthe women. And my wife...it's not like today; I think it took 12 days to come over. And she\nwas sick...sea sick, from the first day to the last day. She just...she just can't do it, you know.\nAnd my daughter and myself, we were in good shape. My daughter was sick once. I was...I\nwasn't sick at all. We got this tickets for meals; I had mine and my wife's. Because she\ncouldn't eat, you know. And funny thing...on the last day before we came to New York, she\ngot well. She got up and played cards with the ladies there. So we finally came to New York.\nAnd my mother, my sister was waiting for us there, you know. And they took us home; and\nthey had uh apartment rented for us where we could stay until we find something. Uh, that\nwas terrible. This apartment was terrible. It had only a curtain, and behind the curtain was a\nlittle thing where you could cook something there. A little room... We couldn't do nothing.\nWe just... Yah, there was from the mission, from the Swedish Mission, was a office in New\nYork too. They are all over. And they made sure that we get our crates and everything. And\nso we stayed; I think, we stayed with my mother 2 months. And I made an application in the\nBotanic Garden in New York to get a job. I never got an answer. I was...I don't know what to\ndo. And my wife had an aunt in Long Island, in East Hampton, that she knew from Vienna.\nWay back. They were here, her aunt and her uncle were here in the '30's already, you know.\nThey had a little restaurant, pizza restaurant, in Long Island. So New York ...we didn't like\nNew York too much. So my wife said, \"Why don't we...?\" And they were calling us on the\nphone, \"Why don't you come over here for a while?\" So we packed up again and went to\nLong Island, and stayed with her aunt. She had that restaurant, and we helped her. Uh, she\nhad... the aunt was staying up til 12:00 or 1:00 in the morning waiting for customers. She\ndidn't want to close early, because maybe another customer come. So my wife stayed with\nher every night 'til late in the morning. We got our daughter in a kindergarten there. And I\ngot a job in a place where they homogenized the milk and packed the milk and have it ready\nfor... Where the farmers bring the milk to, and you put it in the cartons like. And I worked...I\nhad to get up everyday at 3:00 in the morning; and the guy picked me up at 3:30. I didn't\nhave a car or anything. Couldn't even drive. And he took me with him, that he worked there,\ntoo. But we were off at 3:00 in the afternoon or 3:30; and he brought me home again. So I\ndid this over the winter. And then our friends, the ones that were living in Washington\nalready for a year, the ones that were writing us, we should come, come, come. They said,\n\"Come over and maybe we will find something here.\" So that was in the spring of '51--no,\n'52.'51 became '52. I went alone. I said, \"Let me just look.\" And I went alone. I slept in their\napartment, and this friend of mine was a plate maker. He worked for a big lithographic\ncompany, the printing, and he got me a job in that plant, in the press room. He was making\nplates somewhere, and I was in the press where they had these huge presses. And really, I\nmean, I got in that union and it paid good, and I worked for them 13 years, 13 years. In the\nmeantime, in that house where my friend was living, he was living in the basement and the\nowner of the house had the upstairs. He was the Maitre d' of the Mayflower Hotel in\nWashington. And one day he came and he said, \"Why don't you come down and help us out\nwhen you are not too busy?\" You know. I worked only 8:00 to 4:00, or something or 6:00 to\n2:00, or something like that, in the printing plant. So, that 1s where it started. So many nights\na week I went down there and I took my friend, Bornsmith (ph). He didn't...he didn't like it.\nHe never went again. But I stick... stuck to 1t. I was working with the waiter in the bank with\nthe department of the Mayflower another, the same 13 years. And so I had actually two jobs;\nbecause when we came we didn't have no money, no nothing. We got...when we came in 'S1,\nwe got a room in a single home with a widow and two kids. She had a boy and girl. And we\nrented the bedroom, the bedroom for us. We could share the living room, kitchen, and the..\nAnd so that was working out good. The two girls went together to school; the other girl was\na little bit bored. First my daughter went to kindergarten. In a half year, she spoke\nEnglish...like no accent, no nothing.",
        "Q: Were you raising her as a Lutheran?",
        "A: Yah, sure. Yah. Yah. We were Lutherans. I couldn't change that. And so, my daughter was in\nthe nursing home, we picked her up, my wife. And then the lady that we lived with, she\nworked for Safeway; and she got...after the 5 and 10 cent store, she got my wife a job at\nSafeway. And she stayed at Safeway 25 years. Yah. And then she retired in '78. And I started\nworking in that printing press in the morning; and in the afternoon...late afternoon, I went to\nthe hotel and was helping there. So I had actually two jobs, so we saved a little money. And\nwe stayed with that lady 5 years, here on Forest Glen Road in Maryland. And after 5 years,\nwe had enough money and we were looking for a house in Wheaton, out in Wheaton. At that\ntime, I think the house was $12,000 and the down payment was $500. So we got a house.\nAnd it was uh...uh 2 bricks, you know. Two houses together; but 1t had upstairs with 3 rooms\nand a nice living room, dining room, kitchen, beautiful yard. So the cost was $12,000, but I\nthink I paid down $500 and that wasn't enough. I had to have another second mortgage with\nthe owner, and paid the owner...I don't know, 5 years, $35 a month, or something, you know.\nSo I was...we had a house, we had no furniture. So we started buying the furniture, little bit\nhere, little bit there. And my salary, her salary together, and when the first of the month\ncame, everything was on charge. They had to be divided so much then and there, so much\nmoney here. So we pay off this stuff in a little while. And we did it. We paid off the second\nmortgage in 5 years. We stayed there 12 years, in that house; and in the meantime, we put\nour daughter through college in that house. When she came back, she didn't want to stay with\nus anymore. She got her own apartment with her girl friend. So we had that big house with\nthe bedrooms, upstairs and everything, and said, \"It's too big for us, two of us. Let's find a\nsmall one.\" So we find a small one where we are now. And that was only $19,500 at that\ntime. I think today it's $80,000, though. And uh so we sold that house. We got out $12,000\nfrom that house clear, put it right away there. And I was always afraid of mortgages, owing\nhere and owing there. So whatever I could scrap together from savings and so, we paid the\nhouse off right away. And from then on out, it got a lot easier. And there were only the two\nof us. Our daughter was by then...got a job--a social worker--which she still has it.",
        "Q: Do you talk to her a lot about your experience?",
        "A: Uh, not too much. She knows where we were. But you know more, I think, than she does.\nNow. But she told me all the time, \"Write a book. Write a book. We want to know what\nhappened.\" It's better she don't know, you know. But anyway, we are out of the woods, you\nknow. We are both retired. We get our pension. We get our social security. She got her...she\ngot 3 kids: 3 boys. And she...her husband got a good job with the government; and they have\nhuge house in Silver Spring. So everything right now seems to be okay.",
        "Q: Congratulations!",
        "A: It was a rough time. But they say if you want to, you can make it, and we made it.",
        "Q:",
        "A: And can't complain anymore.",
        "Q: Do you ever keep in touch with your mother's family?",
        "A: My mother's...real mother's family?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: There is no more anymore. My mother died. My mother died in Newburg, actually, in the\n'70s. Her parents came from the Czechoslovakia. They died. Actually, my real grandmother\nwas with us in Theresienstadt. And she was...she was in the 70s, and she got out. She used to\nlive in Paris for a long time after that, after '45. But I was...",
        "Q: How did she get out?",
        "A: I mean, she...when it was liquidated and the Americans freed them--or the Russians,\nwhoever was there. She was still alive, and her daughter died. She made it, you know. She\nhad a lot of kids. And they met in France; and I lost track of them, you know. But otherwise,\neverybody else is in America. My father's side...my father's side, uh, my grandmother, of\ncourse, 1s long dead. And my grandfather died already earlier. And his two brothers, my\nfather's two brothers--one was engineer, he worked in Italy, got malaria, he died young. And\nthe other one was uh...was a doctor; and after the war was over, he divorced his wife in\nVienna, he came over here. He got all his exams made over, and he married a nurse. And\nthey were...they settled down in Cleveland, and we visited them a couple of times. But uh\nthey both dead now. So what we have left in Vienna 1s only a cousin and her children, and\nanother one. And so...and friends. One of my best friends. The best friend I had at that time,\nhe died a couple of weeks ago. He went with me through all this, so to the end. And his wife,\ntoo. But she's still alive. But he had...he was diabetic from way back; and then lately he\ngot...he got 2 heart attacks, and he couldn't make it, he was sick. It was just a couple of\nweeks ago, I found out that he... And he just retired. That's the terrible thing about the retire.\nHe used to...we worked for...he was a director in the bank. He had a good life and\neverything, you know. Now when he finally retired, 1t was 65 when he died, two years later\nhe's gone. That's real sad. And a few months the insurance stop. You enjoy your life. Save all\nyour life, and then you go. The same thing happened, too. I used to work in the Mayflower;\nand my head waiter, uh, came from Europe too. He was Jewish too. He worked his way up\nfrom bus boy to Maitre d'. He worked over 30, 35 years there. He retired that spring, and he\nwas dead in September. He had a brain tumor. This is true. And I was wonder how we come\nout...we came out alive, you know. We went through so much. My wife was always...was\nreally with one foot already in the grave, waiting.",
        "Q: What do you think is the answer? How come you did survive?",
        "A: I don't know. I really couldn't say. Maybe believing that we, if we try enough we can get out\nof it, but I couldn't really answer that. When I saw these guys passing away like flies, why\nnot me? I could have the same thing, you know. There was very few that really got out of it,\nand so it's hard to say. I'm not too religious, but I still believe somebody up there must like\nme, you know. I came through, and the same with her.",

    "answers": [
        "A: You mean from way back?",
        "A: Well, my name is Ernst Weiths, and I was born in Vienna in 1908. I am coming from a\ncompletely full Jewish background because my father was Jewish, my mother was Jewish,\nboth grandparents were Jewish. So, I was born in 1908. And, uh, I had a sister; she was born\nin 1914. And we lived in Vienna. My father was...actually my grandfather had a store in\nVienna; and my father was working with him. And he didn't like it. And, uh, he had, uh, two\nbrothers, one was engineer; and the younger was...uh a doctor. And he hated the store and he\nhated office work; but he became then an accountant later on, you know. And, uh, we were\ntogether-- the whole family was together 'til the war broke out in 1914. And then my father\nhad to go to war. And when he came back in 1918, he met somebody else. They met in\nSalzburg--that 1s close to Vienna. And when he came finally home, he was asking for a\ndivorce. So, we had these four years of war, we had hardly anything to eat. My mother had\nto go out in the country, exchange her rings and everything for food, what it was like at this\ntime. Everything was rationed. You had to get card or marks, cards for your food. You got\nfrozen potatoes and all that stuff. Anyway, then finally when he got his...uh his divorce, we\nstill--my sister and myself were still with my mother. Up until 19... until the time when I was\nll. And he didn't give her any child support or anything. She had to raise the two of us. And it\ncame the time when she just couldn't do it anymore, and told me that I have to go and live\nwith my father. So...and she kept my sister. So my father was in another state of Austria with\nhis new wife. They worked, uh both as accountants, for a company. And one day I packed a\nlittle suitcase and went on a train and went to see them, you know. And it was real...not very\ncomfortable for them, because nobody knew that he had a 11 year-old son. So he actually\ndidn't, uh, look forward to that very much. But he had no other choice. And, uh, so that I\nstayed with them and I went to school there. I mean, I finished elementary school in Vienna,\nand my mother let me go to--by the way, here you call it college, [but] it was gymnasium in\nVienna--in Vienna for one year. But I didn't do so good in Latin and Greek. So when I came\nto my father, first of all he didn't want to spend the money to go to a college or something.\nSo he said, \"I just...you just try to finish high school here, you know, and then we see.\" So in\nthe meantime uh they uh asked me to be baptized, because my stepmother was Lutheran.\nAnd when they married, my father became Lutheran too. So I got baptized over there when I\nwas 11 or 12, and I had my documents. Actually, I didn't have anything to do with being\nJewish from that age on, you know. From 11 on. I went to church; and we had religion\noutside with the Pastor and so on. So I stayed with them...uh 11, 12, 13, 14...when I was 14--\n'til I was 14. So, my father... I, myself, at that uh age, I didn't really know...know what I\nwanted to be later on, you know. I thought maybe I'd follow him and go in a school and learn\naccounting, or whatever. No he didn't...he didn't want that at all. He was...he hated his job.\nHe was more for nature. He loved flowers and animals--I mean, not animals, but fish. He\nloved fish and flowers. Cactus, actually. And he was...when we lived together with him, we\nhad the whole--even before, when he was still married to my real mother, he had the whole\nliving room full with aquariums, you know. With fish and everything. And every time he\nbought a new fish, he hid it behind him and sneaked it in; because my mother didn't want\nhim to spend the money. They were very expensive, and we didn't hardly have enough\nmoney to live on. So when he was with his other wife, he did the same thing. He had these\naquariums all over the house; and he had the windows covered with flower pots and\neverything. And he wanted me not to go in a office...work in an office. Go out and be in the\noutside, in nature. So one day they went on vacation to Germany and they went to all\nthis...the biggest nurseries that there are in Germany. And finally he found me a place to\nlearn, to begun, in a nursery, in...1n Kempten there. Close to Munich. You know, in Bavaria.\nSo but I thought maybe it's alright. I was real skinny, not strong as anything. And they came\nback, picked me up and took me there to that nursery. Was only the boss, his wife, and they\nhad a daughter which was a little younger than I was.",
        "A: I was 14. When you have to learn this job, you have to learn 3 years; and in these 3 years,\nthey gave me a room and board, you know, and no money. You didn't...you don't get paid for\nit. You're learning. So...but I had to get up at 6:00 in the morning; I was already out there,\nworking. And I was...I wasn't strong or anything, but I made it, you know. Carried this big\nstuff around and worked in the greenhouse, worked outside. And my boss was...he was an\nexcellent nursery man, a gardener. He was the best in the city. But at home, he was the\nworst. He beat his wife up every other day. (Laughing) So this girl and myself, we grew up\nin that milieu, you know. And she was, I think, only 2 years younger than I was. And I had to\nwork 6:00 in the morning, and even some...most of the time until 9:00 in the evening. And\nuh when it was dark outside, come in the shed and I had to cut the wood, you know. And so\non. And then when he came home from drinking, he said, \"You can go now.\" To sleep, you\nknow. And then he was full of hard going, he came back at 11:00 back from the...from\nthe...back from the gardens, from the greenhouse. And he then he went up and hear beating\nup again and again. Oh, well, it was terrible. But I... And then, of course, when I came there,\nthe first few months I was crying every night. I was homesick. And my parents in the\nmeantime got transferred back to Vienna from that place where they used to work out in\nanother state. So they stayed in Vienna. And uh well, after 3 years he wanted me to stay on\nand he would pay me. And I said, \"No, I don't want to stay any longer.\" In that job, you go\nfrom nursery to nursery to learn more and more and more. So he got me a job in another one\nabout Augsburg. Augsburg is about three hours by train. And I stayed there. That uh was\nnice, you know. The people that worked in the nurseries, most of them, they stayed in; they\ngot their bed and their food and everything there. So I stayed there. Another couple of years,\nI moved on to Stuttgart--which is Germany, too. And I stayed there another couple of years.\nAnd then--I think 1t was 1928--I came back to Vienna. And, uh, my father and my\nstepmother had a nice apartment off in the suburbs, and I had a room there. But my work\nwas on the other side of the city. It was one of the biggest nurseries in Vienna at that time. So\nI worked there, but I had to go back and forth. And after awhile, it was too much; so I got my\nown room close by about 5 minutes from the nursery. And I had my own room and\neverything. And I made my money there. And some days, holidays when I was off, I went\nhome. They did my laundry at home and everything; and over the weekend I stayed home.\nAnd then I went back to work. So, that went on from 1928 to 1938. I was there 10 years.",
        "A: In the nursery.",
        "A: Yah. My mother was...my mother, my sister were living about...very close by to where I was\nworking. I saw her off and on, and went out with them sometimes, you know. I saw her up\n'til 1939. So I worked in the nursery 'til 1938; and then Hitler came and, uh, everything\nchanged. But I was working. Nobody knew that I had a Jewish background, because I had\nmy, I went to church and everything. They all didn't know about it. And, uh.... Not the\npeople where I used to...where I had my room, and not the people where I worked. They\ncouldn't believe this. Then in 1939, the officials out there where I worked came and told the\nman that I was living with that \"You have a Jew up there in the room, you know, living with\nyou.\" And the guy--he was an engineer--he was already part of the party there, you know.\nAnd he said, \"What, what are you talking about? You must be crazy. Mr. Weihs? No. No\nway!\" So he said, \"Well, let's go up and find out.\" So they came up there and asked me my\nbackground; and I had to say \"Yah.\" I mean, I myself was already Lutheran for uh so many\nyears; but that didn't help, that doesn't help, you know. As long as you were Jewish and your\nparents were Jewish, that's it, you know.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: In '38, when Hitler came to power, did you fear that was going to happen to you?",
        "A: Well, first we all thought it will be okay, they will leave us alone you know. And people\nwere screaming already; my mother--my real mother--said, \"If he only let us scream with\nthem!\" (Laughing) But he didn't, you know. I mean, the people of Vienna, they uh were, of\ncourse, on his side. And they hated the Jews for centuries, you know. They were glad they\nhad a chance to get rid of them. So these people came up, and said he had to let me go. I can't\nstay in his house. And in the nursery, the guy...they couldn't believe it, you know. I just, I\nsaid, \"Well, I am sorry, but I have to quit. I have to quit.\"",
        "A: I guess, yah. In Austria, your driver's license is not enough. You know, you got to fill\nout...and the police wherever, what you leave, every time you move, you have to register.\nThey know exactly what was going on, you know. And uh so I had to quit, and...uh the job\nand the room. But--I forgot to tell you--in '37 before Hitler came, my father passed away. He\nhad a gall bladder operation and didn't make it. So my stepmother was living alone out in the\nsuburbs; and I moved...I lived on with her up to, oh, in '39. And uh...so I didn't have a job; I\ndidn't have... I mean, the people out there, they didn't like the idea either, that some Jewish\npeople lived there, you know.",
        "A: Well, first of all, everybody had to wear the star, you know. Whoever was Jewish had to\nwear the star.",
        "A: Yah, sure! And uh...I mean, most of the time we just covered it up when we could get away\nwith it, you know. But if they catched you, that was...that would of be terrible, but... Then\nfinally, you know, they closed Jewish stores, they started deporting Jewish... And uh I...I was\nhome, and for a little... Yah, the thing was that I was registered Jewish in the Viennese\nKultursgemeinde there. At the same time, I had my paper that said I am Lutheran, you know.\nSo I actually two chances to get out of Vienna, either with ...on the Jewish side or on the\nLutheran side. But uh my mother wanted me...tried to get me to Palestine, but it never came\nto it. You know, at that time they were smuggling the people out. My real mother. And uh on\nthe other side--the Lutheran side--I was registered 1n...there was a Swedish mission for\nJewish people, and I registered there. So the Jewish uh side wants send me outside Vienna.\nThere was a farm where they trained youngsters for farming and then send...maybe they\ncould get to Palestine. So I worked there, I think, one summer. Milking the cows and cutting\nthe hay; and all that stuff, you know. (Laughing)",
        "A: That was...they called it...was the Kultursgemeinde in Vienna.",
        "A: Yah, right. And then I got a card from the Lutheran people, from the Swedish mission, I\nshould come to an interview. And they were sending people to Sweden, you know. They had\ntransports to Sweden. So I came back from the camp; and I went to this...it was a Pastor that\nwas running the whole thing.",
        "A: Do you know where he was from?",
        "A: From the Lutheran church, under the Swedish mission. And he said, \"Well, we'll take all\nyour dates and maybe we can get you uh on a transport. But right now, there is nothing\ngoing. We have to wait. In meantime, if you want to, we have a heim [Ger: home] for the\nelderly--old Jewish people--and maybe 3 houses in Vienna.\" They bought a big estate and\nwith little rooms, and they had the people staying there. \"If you want to, you could go out\nthere and work for us.\" They had a huge garden to take care of, you know. \"And you could\nwork there 'til we have a chance to get you on a train, you know, out.\"",
        "A: It was a Swedish Deaconess, she was connected with that Swedish mission from Stockholm,\nand she was running that home for the elderly. So I went there, and I got my room. And there\nwas a girl there that also worked to clean the rooms, and have everything help in the kitchen;\nand she became my wife, you know. We were the only young ones there. So we worked and\nworked, and went out together. And finally, we got engaged. She came from Vienna, too.\nHer parents had a different story. Her mother was Catholic. Her father was Jewish. The\nSwedish mission people baptized her Lutheran...(laughing) in 1938, I think it was. So she\nwas what they then...they called \"Mischlinge.\" Half this and half that. So they promised her,\ntoo, she could get a chance to go to Sweden. And in the meantime, she took that job out\nthere. So we worked together. She made up all the beds in the morning and this, and helped\nwith the water; every morning have to carry up in the morning. And then I worked in the\ngarden there. They had fruit trees, and they were huge. And they had all these nice old\npeople there, and we always entertained them. And then I was the one that had to go down in\nthe village and always get the food. And we had cards, you know, take up for so much\nbutter, so much meat, for so much this.",
        "A: Yes. And I had a backpack and a bicycle. So I was going into the city, buying everything,\ncome back and bring the food. Up to the time where the villagers said, \"No, he can't come\nanymore. He is Jewish. He can't come anymore. We don't want him here.\" I mean, the people\nthat run the stores, they wanted me, you know. They were good with us. But Mayor and all\nthese people, they...they were strong Nazi and they didn't want that. So the Swedish sister,\nthe Deaconess, had to go and do the job, with the shopping and all that stuff. So that went on.\nSo in the meantime, we got engaged. It was uh '39. I came...I met her--my wife--in August\n'39, when I came working there. And we stayed there...'40,'41. Two years. And her father\nwas with us. He had to leave his wife; otherwise, she would lose the apartment in Vienna,\nyou know. My wife's father.",
        "A: He was Jewish, and the mother was Catholic. So the mother could keep the apartment; and\neven my future wife, she could have stayed with her mother. But she went with her father.\nAnd uh...so finally we got engaged. And in 1941, they...uh people said it has to be closed.\nThe whole thing, all the people had to go out in the village. They closed down the home.\nAnd the Swedish mission had a huge building in Vienna itself, you know, where they had\napartments and offices and stuff like that. All of the empty spaces, they made something like\na hospital on the ground floor where we all had to move to Vienna. The old people, they\nwere all in the 80s--70s, 80s. They had women, most of them there. And someone of them\nhad to be in bed; and some of them got apartments in the house. And uh we still were taking\ncare of them; and there was...uh each apartment had its own uh stove. I had carry the coal up\nthere and take care of these people. And we fed them there too. We had a kitchen where they\nhad cooked; and they was all supplied from Sweden, the food, you know. Okay, so then\ncame 1940, then came spring of '42. In Spring of '42, there was another organization from\nHolland. And this...they were helping people that got evacuated to pack and go to. There was\none school that was just for people to get ready there and for the train to go. So in order to\nstay a little longer...and they said if I help them I could probably be protected a little more.\nSo we had to go out with the German soldiers to Jewish homes in the night, you know, make\nthe people pack--they at least who is going to go--and get ready and help them 'til the truck\ncame and then loaded them up. And, of course, there were terrible situations, you know. The\nchildren started crying. And the children were not home one night. We were sitting through\nthe morning one night, and they insisted the kid has go with them; and we waited with the\nGestapo there. And I did this for another year while my wife was still in that house with the\nmission. And then...",
        "A: The Germans what?",
        "A: The Germans just let them do it, you know. One was a Swedish organization, a Swedish\nmission; and the other one was Dutch.",
        "A: And they were called Guildemester. They brought food and they fed the people and helped\nthem with clothes, and so. But they all had to be closed uh in 19...1n the spring of 1942. And\nfinally, we all had to go.",
        "A: From Vienna. So they took us in this school, where everybody gets ready for transporting.\nThere was uh...but my wife and her father were still in Vienna; but myself and our friends,\nmostly men, we had to leave Vienna. And...with a suitcase. And they took us to\nCzechoslovakia.",
        "A: Well, they came...they came one day and said, \"You have to be on this and this date there\nand there.\" And that's it, you know. There was not an invitation. It was just, \"Do it, or else!\"\nSo we were all put on a train, and went to a city was called Theresienstadt [NB: Terezin].\nYou probably heared about that. That was old military city, with kasernes [Ger: \"barracks\" ].\nThere were no more soldiers; and it was made up like a ghetto, you know. People came from\nall over the places. And the men were living in one of these big houses. The women, the\nothers. And during the day, they worked...we worked on the railroad; unloading the coal,\nwhatever came for the ghetto. And some of them they had their own locker, lumber shops,\nand everything. It was like a...like a city by itself, you know.",
        "A: Yah. No, we didn't know what it was like. We hear about it, that there 1s a ghetto in\nCzechoslovakia, but we didn't know what it was about. We had our own money, you know,\nown stores and everything like a...like Columbia here, you know. Everything was wants.",
        "A: Well, I mean the money didn't mean nothing because everything was, you could only get\nbread or this or that, in rationed. Everything was rationed, you know. And uh...then later on,\nwe were allowed to get packages from home, which was something. We had big kitchens\nwhere cooking and where we could eat for dinner, for lunch and dinner, you know. But uh it\nwas like a black market afterwards, you know. The Czechoslovakian people, the people that\nworked on the railroad, they sold you uh cigarettes and they smuggled out our letters home.\nAnd uh a lot of them were really with us, instead of against us. So we struggled through; and\nuh it was not too bad actually. The old people, after a few weeks, they were all gone. They\ndied.",
        "A: Of malnutrition and diarrhea, and stuff like that. They just, they just...you know, they were\nlaying on the floors, and they just couldn't make it. And the food, they didn't get, they didn't\nget too much. But we were still young and we got, later on we got help from home, you\nknow, with bread and stuff like that.",
        "A: No. My wife was still in Vienna. I was there in early '42. And then they told them in Vienna,\nthey told, \"You can join your people. And this is like a working place where you can be. And\nuh you can be with your fianc\u00e9, with your husband, with your father, whatever.\" So what did\nshe do? Instead of staying with her mother, her father had to go. So she went with her father,\nand came a half a year later. And I am standing there shovelling the coal off the...on the\nrailroad, and where they coming out. They coming out from the train. And I said that and I\nsee them close there; and I said, \"Why didn't you stay with your mother?\" \"No, I want to be\nwith you and with my father.\" So we stayed together for another, I think, another half year or\nalmost a year. And we were living separate, but we could see each during the...just normally.\nWe even got married there.",
        "A: We had our own Mayor and everything.",
        "A: Yah, the people elect him. And then uh I mean there were a lot of people come up from the\nKultursgemeinde that came with us. So they took over right away. And so they had uh ...and\nI don't know how it was, we...they had the nicest dresses you could buy there; you know, on\nthe black market, or something. I can't even remember how it worked. We were really good\ndressed, and we had our friends. And we went...she went from her house and I from my\nhouse to get married there. And I went down the street to that house and there was a alarm,\nyou know.",
        "A: A air alarm. So we both, I had to duck in the house somewhere, and she had to duck. When\nthe alarm was over, we made. It was like a real ceremony there, you know. And then we\nhad...there was a caf\u00e9 in the ghetto, and we and our friends went there and celebrated. And\neverything seemed to look like normal. I mean, everything that we brought in our luggage uh\nwas confiscated, you know. They had big uh buildings where they stored all the clothes and\nall the shoes and all this...the jewelry. It all was gone. But we had ...we could--I don't know\nhow it was--we still could buy things to... There were seamstresses, and we made...made\ndresses and so.",
        "A: It wasn't like a country club. I mean, there were guards...?",
        "A: Well, it was what you call the box cars, you know. Where you usually transport cows or\nwhatever, you know. We had a little straw in there, and they locked them up from the\noutside. And uh all of us, we got a piece of bread when we got in the train.",
        "A: It was terrible. Because it was a lot of people in there, hot; some of them started crying, some\nof them screaming, some of them fainting. But, anyway, we made it to Auschwitz. We came\nthere in middle in the night.",
        "A: No, we didn't have no idea at the time, you know. Anyway, we...was a whole train full of\ncars...uh, railroad cars. And the soldiers and the lights and the captain--or whatever was the\nofficer standing there--like they say, left, right, left, right. That's how we had all to jump\ndown, in rows of six, and march in front of him. And uh we were a group of people that\nknew each other from Vienna for so long, we...we always stick together. I had my friend and\nhis wife and her two brothers. One was I think 12 and one was 16. So we came in, to that\nright for him; and that little brother was already...we never saw him again, you know. And\nthe rest of us went in the camp. And the ones that were actually the worst were the Polish\nJews that the SS put in charge of this barracks, you know. They were hitting us and\nscreaming. They were worse than the Germans for a while, you know. So we, first of all, we\nhad to go in these barracks, and the next thing was: \"Take everything off. Take a shower.\"\nAnd then they gave us this striped shirt and pants coming out. You had to go to the barber,\ncut all your hair off, and then you came out. And when we came out I said to my friend,\n\"Where is uh this guy?\" And he said, \"He is right here behind you.\" We didn't recognize\neach other anymore, you know. All the hair was gone. And the uniform. So they put us\ntogether in these barracks and that was the first couple of days. When it was time to get out\nof the barrack, we made a...there were about 50 and they stood one close to the other one in a\ncircle and we were going just like this just to keep ourselves warm, you know, all together.\nAnd we saw the chimneys and everything; but we didn't really, the first time, know what was\ngoing on. Until we found out, we didn't get this little boy with us any more, and so, and then\nthe other ones told us all these people go into the gas chamber. So a couple of days later,\nwhat happened? All the women came. They told them in Theresienstadt, \"You can join your\nhusbands or fathers. They working there in Germany. You can join them and it will be just\nlike here.\" My wife was among the first to go. Again, and her girlfriend, you know. So one\nday, everything was fenced. We saw them a little bit across from us. No hair. Just like us.\nThat was the last time we saw each other, you know. And we...a little group of us, were...I\ndon't know, we were just lucky. They were looking for men to work in another labor camp.\nThey didn't give us...even give us any numbers. I think it was only a week that we stayed\nthere.\u2019 And then they, uh, packed us up again in the trains and took us to...I remember now\nwhat the city was, next to Dachau. It was Kaufering.\u201d Kaufering was the city, you know.\nAnd there was a uh labor camp, and that 1s where they took us. So we didn't know where our\nwives were anymore. We just got out of Auchwitz in between a week or two weeks,\nsomething like that.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Well, they choose us, I guess, by the strength of the bodies, you know. That people they\ncould work, but I can't even remember what they put us to work. I know where I worked.\nLuck again: I worked out in the fields to bring in the potatoes and the cabbage and all that\nstuff. Some of them worked in the camp. Some of them worked in close-by factories, I think.\nAnd there were all men only, in that camp.",
        "A: All men. No...no woman. So we--our group of friends--we stick together again. My friend\nwas assigned to the kitchen, and so he could once awhile putting something to eat. We had\nthis little barracks. You know this was, was a roof of grass, covered with grass; then you go a\nfew steps down, the door, and there is the wood, and you lay on it... on a blanket, on this\nwooden...",
        "A: ...platforms, yah.",
        "A: Oh, I guess we must have been 40 in a barrack, at least. One of them...we were not long\nthere, and one of them hanged himself. In the morning we waked up, and the guy was\nE.g., in Auschwitz.\n; Subcamp of Dachau.\nhanging next to me. He couldn't stand it any more.",
        "A: Well, I guess. Now what happened a lot was--what I never could understand--that friends of\nmine--6 feet tall, 200 pounds, really strong guys--they died away like flies. And we were just\nmedium, not...not really strong. We just made it. My friend was in the hospital, I think, 2 or 3\ndays; then he came out and never again. But some other ones from our group, they just...you\nknow, diarrhea came and...",
        "A: No, we didn't have much to eat. We had cabbage soup, you know, and the bread... Almost\nnothing. But like me, I was out in the fields and we had these big coats. It was...it was fall. It\nwas cold. We had a big coat, and the coat had big pockets inside. I put the potatoes in there,\nyou know. And we came home--the soldiers already knew what we were doing, I think. And\neach barracks had a little stove where we could make a fire. And put the potatoes in the\nashes. And when everything was quiet, around 11 or 12 at night, we started eating the\npotatoes. I guess, and somehow... And cabbage. Somehow, that kept us going I think. And\nthe other guys, if... As soon as you got sick, you were done. Got very diarhea, or whatever it\nwas. There were only skeletons anymore. And it was in the winter then, in November. And\nthey made us, we were...we had to go out with a 2 wheeler you know. We had to pack all\nthese dead bodies on the 2 wheeler. And we see my friend here, my friend here. I mean, up\nhere, they were there. Just skeletons. Frozen stiff, you know. It was cold at that time. No\nclothes, nothing on. So we had to put them on the 2 wheeler, go out in the fields with the\nsoldier, dig the holes, and just put them in there. Cover them up. And then later on, we didn't\neven have anymore uh...uh room. We had to carry them to another camp to be buried there\nor burned, I don't know. Anyway, we had one guy that was, on his own free will, went to\nanother camp to work. And then he came with a troop of people back; and he was...we had to\nempty these cars, and they were on this straw in there. And some of the guys were laying\ndead and the other ones hardly could get up off the car. And when they came to the camp, I'll\nnever forget that. They came like ghosts, you know, swaying like this, only a little littler\nthen. A whole group of people looking at us. And fall. Then they came 1n, and I had to give\nthem cups of water. They went on their knees crawling to us, that cup of water. And then\nthey fed them. Most of them, I think, didn't make it. And then we had uh people come in.\nAnd we had people come in from all over, from France and everywhere. And then the Red\nCross was sending uh packages. And uh they came the packages and some broke open; and\nthey had dried beans and peas in there. And these guys were storming against this stuff,\neating this dried...dried beans. A lot of them ate grass, you know. From the barracks, they ate\nthe grass. I actually never got in that bad a situation. I always had my potatoes and soup; and\nthen we made it that way. Anyway. And next to our camp, was a railway going from\nKaufering to Dachau, where the Germans transported their troops and material and\neverything else.",
        "A: Oh! I am going too long already.",
        "A: Oh.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTAPE #2",
        "A: We were not allowed to cook. There were some other...there were bread and stuff in there. I\ndon't what happened, what actually was in there, all of 1t. But I know it spilled, and these\nguys were grabbing and putting that stuff in their mouths.",
        "A: Oh, okay. So, then it was...that went on 'til, oh, spring of '45. I was there 'til spring of '45.",
        "A: In Kaufering. After...then one day, they said we have to evacuate. The camp is going to be\nclosed, and they going to take us to Dachau. So we got our clothes, we didn't have anything\nelse, and we got our piece of bread, and we started marching. It was, I think, it was two days,\nwe should have marched. We...we marched about 2 hours. And it was hill up; and you could\nsee from the hill down to the camp, and all was uh...the whole thing went up in flames. You\nknow, the American bombers bombed the camp plus the railroad. They were waiting to cut\noff the railroad bridge from there to Munich, so the Germans couldn't transport their stuff.\nAnd they must have known all the time that there was a camp, a labor camp there.\nOtherwise, they never touched it. They flew over us a lot of times. And that moment we\nwent out, two hours later, everything went up in flames. So we started marching through the\nwoods towards Dachau. In the meantime, the soldiers that were supposed to watch us...half\nof them disappeared. It was almost May, it was April '45. And the other ones took everything\noff, their medals and signs. And nobody paid any attention to us. So we were marching in a\nlong line. And we were a group of my friends and a couple of other ones. His cousin and a\ncouple of other ones. He said, \"I don't know. Maybe we better don't go to Dachau. I don't\nknow. They might kill us in the last minute there, you know, before they...before they give\nup.\" So one time in the afternoon, we went along in the line and got a curb where no soldier\ncould actually see us. And the five of us, I think it was, jumped on the side in the pit and\nhide...were hiding. 'Til they were out of sight. Nobody cared how many in the group any\nmore. So then we got out. We started marching and uh we didn't know where we were going,\nhow far we are from Dachau. And we go on that street; here comes a German woman on a\nbicycle and we said, \"What is going on?\" She said, \"The Armies are coming. The Army. The\nArmy are here.\" We said, \"Well, that's good.\" And we hear shooting. In the...in the next\nvillage we hear still shooting going on. So we went there towards that village, and we\nducked out when the...when they started shooting, and then we come, we came to the middle\nof the city, of the, of that village. And here were all the American tanks, the soldiers sitting\non the tanks smoking their cigarettes and having a good time. And then all of the sudden,\nthere came some airplanes and so everybody ducked. But it was American airplanes, you\nknow. So what we going to do? My friend was able to speak a little English. So they took us\nto the commandant; and they took us in a hospital. They thought we have to recover. We\ndidn't look too bad, but still. We were laying in that hospital a few hours. Wounded German\nsoldiers; and we were laying if front of them, and they didn't actually know who we are. And\nhere comes the nurses. \"Oh,\" they started crying, \"the American soldiers... The end... Too\nmany died already...\" And this and this. And we are in the middle of this German hospital.\nThat was a terrible situation, you know? But the nurses were nice to us. I don't know whether\nthey knew who we are or not. But anyway, they took care of us. And we were actually not\nsafe. We were just resting from the...from the trip from Kaufering to there.",
        "A: Yah, they occupied everything then, you know. But they had 3 German nurses and\neverything and German wounded soldiers were there, you know. So we were there, I think, a\nweek or longer. While we were there, the Americans completely took over the city. And all\nthe guys that got free from the labor camps, they went down in the basements, opened the\nwine barrels. There were that fine wine. Took all of anything they could eat, you know. And,\nactually, we missed the whole thing, you know. When we came out, everything was\norganized. And they were...I think you can say they were looting, as I remember. The\nGermans were really scared then. The people that lived there. And there was a whole\nAmerican outfit there, a battalion or whatever it was, you know. And when we came out,\n[they] gave us...they put us in a school. And there was one...you can call it a restaurant--not a\nrestaurant, but a inn or something--where we could go and eat...eat lunch and dinner. They\neven had dance in the evening. And they made it as nice as possible for us, you know. 'Til\nend of May or June. And then they had transportation to Munich for us. And there you could\nstay again; and where were you supposed to...want to go home, and you could go with the\ntrain home. There was no need for money or anything. I don't know, I was hanging around\nthere a long time. I had a friend...I met a guy there. Uh, he was from Spain. Another\n\"inmate,\" so to speak. And we...I didn't know what to do. Should I go back to Vienna or...?\nHe said he is going to go to Spain, and I should go with him and live. And I didn't know\nwhat...what happened to my wife. I had no idea. But then my friends, they all went back to\nVienna. So I took a...went on a train, went back too. And I came to my stepmother's\napartment; and the owner of the house wanted her to move out. Because one part of the...of\nthe floor was his, and the other part was hers; and he wanted the whole thing together again.\nSo she wanted me to stay with her as long as I...as a captive, from... As I was living with her,\nhe couldn't do anything about evacuating her or telling her to get out. But in the meantime, I\nfound out that my wife was with her mother in a little city close by of Vienna. It's about 2\nhour drive back by train to Vienna, uh from Vienna to Baden. It's called Baden-by-Vienna.\nSo I said, \"Well, I can't just stay here. I have to see where my wife is.\" At that time, my\nstepmother and my wife didn't get along too good. In the first place, my stepmother didn't\nwant me to marry her. And when this was all done...I mean, it was in Theresienstadt when\nwe got married, but that was nothing official. It was not...the state didn't recognize that\nmarriage, you know. But anyway, I said to her I had to look her [NB: his wife] up. So I went\nto Baden. That there was a small city close to Vienna. Actually, it is not so small. The people\ncome there from all over the world. They have this thermal baths. And she was there 1n her\nmother's sister's house, they were living. And her mother's sister was living in another city.\nThey had their own house there. So she was living there. And I had a uh piece of paper from\nthe Russians, that I was released from Dachau and so, in Russian. I think I gave it to the...;\nlast time, I sent it. So the Russians were actually in that sector of Austria,patrolling the city\nof Baden, you know. It was in four parts. It was Aus...Russians, English, French and, uh...",
        "A: Yah, Americans. So I showed him this on the street. He let me go. So I went up there. And\nmy mother-in-law...my wife wasn't there. And she was scared. She didn't even want to let me\nin, because I was looking different. She said. \"Is it really you?\" She looked up from the\nwindow outside, \"Is it really you?\" \"Yes, [Eva (ph)], let me in.\" Finally, she got convinced\nthat it's me. She let me in. And then my wife came in the evening. And she looked, of\ncourse... Her hair was only that long. And so we were together again. But food! There was\nno food. We had beans and bread everyday. There was no food to get. Hard to get. And she\nlooked...she was very skinny. I mean, while I was getting out of that--the city where I was\nstaying next to Dachau was Furstenfeldbruck, I told you that. That was an air base, a former\nGerman air base. And she was...when she left Auschwitz...they took her away from\nAuchwitz, they took her to Czechoslovakia in a camp. Belsen, I think.\u201d So with her girl\nfriend, she was there. And she was miserable there. She almost died. She...they lost her\nshoes. And it was cold, they had to march in the snow. They had a factory where these girls\nhad to work. They had for hardly to eat. She had only 2 holes here, a big hole here. But she\nhad one good thing. Her cheeks were always red, whether she was sick or well, or what. So\nwhen the doctor was patrolling the barracks and she was laying there, her friends said, \"No,\nshe is alright. She is feeling okay. She's just a little tired or something.\" So they let her go.\nOtherwise, if you were a little sick there, they took you away. So she made it. And when it\ncame to May '45, and when the camp was open, she came to Vienna on a train was full of\nRussian soldiers. But she said they were real nice, didn't do anything to them. Probably they\nlooked too ugly, didn't want to do anything to them. (Laughing) And she went home and\nstayed with her mother. So when I came, we were together again. But in Vienna--it was '45--\nit was not pleasant. It was demolished very much from the bombs, you know. So everything\nwas...half of Vienna was in ruins except the steeple, churches and some museums, stuff they\ndidn't touch. The [Vienna State] Opera even got a little bombed. And the apartment where\nher mother was living in Vienna--when we got back, one wall of the house was gone. It was\nopen. And the living room had a piano there standing, and her mother saw this. And this\npiano was just right on the wall ready to fall down. But, you know, they repaired everything,\nof course. It looks beautiful now. But uh we couldn't stay there so that's why she was in that\nuh city of Baden. That's why she was staying there. But the two of us...1n '46, the Swedish\nMission came back. They got their house back and uh...uh they opened up kitchens for the\nschool children all over Vienna for lunch. They feed the children. And the simplest part of\nthe whole thing were all the people were living was that house that the mission owned. And\nthey took over one...one big...used to be uh... Not a castle; was a big thing--Luxemburg,\nSchloss Luxemburg it was called. They used it as magazines [NB: warehouse] for storing the\n* Bertgen-Belsen is in Germany.\nfood and everything. And so they took us. We went back to them. We got an apartment\nupstairs. I was taking care of the whole house as far as the cellar where the food was. I had to\nbring the food to the kitchen; they had a huge kitchen there and everything. Taking care of\nthe...I had to...they had...like they had this little, they had this stoves. But not, you know, the\nbig ones made out of uh, of uh...",
        "A: Tiles. Yah. So I had to serve all these people with this coal from down the . They had the big\nthing out behind, going up and down there, didn't have an elevator there. And so we were\nliving with them. We had our food, every night we invited somebody else of our friends to\ncome for dinner; because in Vienna there was...was so terrible then. Nobody had something\nto eat. We had the food of... they had plenty of everything, like in peace time, yah. So we\nstayed with them for quite a while. Then my wife got a job working in the...in the bank\nwhere she used to work before she was evacuated. And she worked there, and our girl went\nto nursery school there. And I was working in the house still with them.",
        "A: When she was born. In '47. Yah, '47; when we was still there. And my wife never forgave\nme this: I look at the baby, and I said, \"My God, we got a little monkey here.\" Oh, she was\nso upset! (Laughing) She never...she always mentions that. But now she 1s a pretty girl. But\num then... She was born in '47, and we stayed with them 4 more years 'til she was 4. And\nthen my mother and my sister left Vienna in '39. They got out to New York. They got to\nNew York. They send us what they call a \"affidavit,\" you know, to come. They wanted us to\ncome. And friends of ours went a year before us, and they were writing us letters: \"How\nbeautiful...! How beautiful...! Sunday, we go with our car. Our radio is playing. And it is just\nout of this world!\" And when we came here, they had a Pontiac! (Laughing) But they were\nhappy; they were living in a basement. But anyway, the story...yah...",
        "A: He died in '37. He died before the camp, my father. And my stepmother...my stepmother\nbought her own apartment; and later on she had to leave where she was living. She had her\nown apartment. And I didn't have really a job, a profession, and didn't pick up my profession\nanymore, so my wife said, \"Why don't we go? Your mother is writing so much about\nAmerica. Why don't we try?\" And we figured out: well, our girl was 4...we come over here,\nshe has a brand new future and it might be a lot better for her to be here than in Vienna. [In\nVienna,| we never knew what's was going on. At that time, it was bad...was bad time in\nVienna, you know.",
        "A: Well, food-wise. You know?",
        "A: Well, food-wise. And jobs, you know, there was... Everything was ruined, most everything it\nwas. I probably could have gotten back my job where I used to work in that nursery.\n[Vent(ph]), his father died and he took over. A whole year: \"Come back, come back. We\nneed you. We need you.\" But he wouldn't give me...he said, \"I got only a small room for you,\nbut it wouldn't be enough for you and your wife.\" So we would have been separated again.\nShe didn't want that.",
        "A: Oh, afterwards? Well, nobody paid any attention anymore. I mean, the two of us...we figured\nwe are Lutheran again, you know. And, yah, we got married in Vienna. That deaconess from\nthe mission, she knew the Pastor from the Lutheran congregation in Vienna. And we got a\nreal official marriage again, you know, in church. And we had to register with the...you\nknow, in the...where you get the license and everything. So everything was done the right\nway then, you know. Because that marriage in Theresienstadt was actually a ghetto marriage\nthat nobody would accept really, you know. So she said, \"Why don't we go?\" And we\npacked up. Yah, we had to go register with the consular; the American consular, you know,\nin Vienna. And they took us, we could have our luggage with us, you know, crates. We took\na couple of crates with us with dishes and all kind of stuff. And they took us to a camp in\nHamburg, Germany, to stay until a ship was available for us. And then we went to the United\nStates with uh a former military ship, you know. So we were separated again, the men and\nthe women. And my wife...it's not like today; I think it took 12 days to come over. And she\nwas sick...sea sick, from the first day to the last day. She just...she just can't do it, you know.\nAnd my daughter and myself, we were in good shape. My daughter was sick once. I was...I\nwasn't sick at all. We got this tickets for meals; I had mine and my wife's. Because she\ncouldn't eat, you know. And funny thing...on the last day before we came to New York, she\ngot well. She got up and played cards with the ladies there. So we finally came to New York.\nAnd my mother, my sister was waiting for us there, you know. And they took us home; and\nthey had uh apartment rented for us where we could stay until we find something. Uh, that\nwas terrible. This apartment was terrible. It had only a curtain, and behind the curtain was a\nlittle thing where you could cook something there. A little room... We couldn't do nothing.\nWe just... Yah, there was from the mission, from the Swedish Mission, was a office in New\nYork too. They are all over. And they made sure that we get our crates and everything. And\nso we stayed; I think, we stayed with my mother 2 months. And I made an application in the\nBotanic Garden in New York to get a job. I never got an answer. I was...I don't know what to\ndo. And my wife had an aunt in Long Island, in East Hampton, that she knew from Vienna.\nWay back. They were here, her aunt and her uncle were here in the '30's already, you know.\nThey had a little restaurant, pizza restaurant, in Long Island. So New York ...we didn't like\nNew York too much. So my wife said, \"Why don't we...?\" And they were calling us on the\nphone, \"Why don't you come over here for a while?\" So we packed up again and went to\nLong Island, and stayed with her aunt. She had that restaurant, and we helped her. Uh, she\nhad... the aunt was staying up til 12:00 or 1:00 in the morning waiting for customers. She\ndidn't want to close early, because maybe another customer come. So my wife stayed with\nher every night 'til late in the morning. We got our daughter in a kindergarten there. And I\ngot a job in a place where they homogenized the milk and packed the milk and have it ready\nfor... Where the farmers bring the milk to, and you put it in the cartons like. And I worked...I\nhad to get up everyday at 3:00 in the morning; and the guy picked me up at 3:30. I didn't\nhave a car or anything. Couldn't even drive. And he took me with him, that he worked there,\ntoo. But we were off at 3:00 in the afternoon or 3:30; and he brought me home again. So I\ndid this over the winter. And then our friends, the ones that were living in Washington\nalready for a year, the ones that were writing us, we should come, come, come. They said,\n\"Come over and maybe we will find something here.\" So that was in the spring of '51--no,\n'52.'51 became '52. I went alone. I said, \"Let me just look.\" And I went alone. I slept in their\napartment, and this friend of mine was a plate maker. He worked for a big lithographic\ncompany, the printing, and he got me a job in that plant, in the press room. He was making\nplates somewhere, and I was in the press where they had these huge presses. And really, I\nmean, I got in that union and it paid good, and I worked for them 13 years, 13 years. In the\nmeantime, in that house where my friend was living, he was living in the basement and the\nowner of the house had the upstairs. He was the Maitre d' of the Mayflower Hotel in\nWashington. And one day he came and he said, \"Why don't you come down and help us out\nwhen you are not too busy?\" You know. I worked only 8:00 to 4:00, or something or 6:00 to\n2:00, or something like that, in the printing plant. So, that 1s where it started. So many nights\na week I went down there and I took my friend, Bornsmith (ph). He didn't...he didn't like it.\nHe never went again. But I stick... stuck to 1t. I was working with the waiter in the bank with\nthe department of the Mayflower another, the same 13 years. And so I had actually two jobs;\nbecause when we came we didn't have no money, no nothing. We got...when we came in 'S1,\nwe got a room in a single home with a widow and two kids. She had a boy and girl. And we\nrented the bedroom, the bedroom for us. We could share the living room, kitchen, and the..\nAnd so that was working out good. The two girls went together to school; the other girl was\na little bit bored. First my daughter went to kindergarten. In a half year, she spoke\nEnglish...like no accent, no nothing.",
        "A: Yah, sure. Yah. Yah. We were Lutherans. I couldn't change that. And so, my daughter was in\nthe nursing home, we picked her up, my wife. And then the lady that we lived with, she\nworked for Safeway; and she got...after the 5 and 10 cent store, she got my wife a job at\nSafeway. And she stayed at Safeway 25 years. Yah. And then she retired in '78. And I started\nworking in that printing press in the morning; and in the afternoon...late afternoon, I went to\nthe hotel and was helping there. So I had actually two jobs, so we saved a little money. And\nwe stayed with that lady 5 years, here on Forest Glen Road in Maryland. And after 5 years,\nwe had enough money and we were looking for a house in Wheaton, out in Wheaton. At that\ntime, I think the house was $12,000 and the down payment was $500. So we got a house.\nAnd it was uh...uh 2 bricks, you know. Two houses together; but 1t had upstairs with 3 rooms\nand a nice living room, dining room, kitchen, beautiful yard. So the cost was $12,000, but I\nthink I paid down $500 and that wasn't enough. I had to have another second mortgage with\nthe owner, and paid the owner...I don't know, 5 years, $35 a month, or something, you know.\nSo I was...we had a house, we had no furniture. So we started buying the furniture, little bit\nhere, little bit there. And my salary, her salary together, and when the first of the month\ncame, everything was on charge. They had to be divided so much then and there, so much\nmoney here. So we pay off this stuff in a little while. And we did it. We paid off the second\nmortgage in 5 years. We stayed there 12 years, in that house; and in the meantime, we put\nour daughter through college in that house. When she came back, she didn't want to stay with\nus anymore. She got her own apartment with her girl friend. So we had that big house with\nthe bedrooms, upstairs and everything, and said, \"It's too big for us, two of us. Let's find a\nsmall one.\" So we find a small one where we are now. And that was only $19,500 at that\ntime. I think today it's $80,000, though. And uh so we sold that house. We got out $12,000\nfrom that house clear, put it right away there. And I was always afraid of mortgages, owing\nhere and owing there. So whatever I could scrap together from savings and so, we paid the\nhouse off right away. And from then on out, it got a lot easier. And there were only the two\nof us. Our daughter was by then...got a job--a social worker--which she still has it.",
        "A: Uh, not too much. She knows where we were. But you know more, I think, than she does.\nNow. But she told me all the time, \"Write a book. Write a book. We want to know what\nhappened.\" It's better she don't know, you know. But anyway, we are out of the woods, you\nknow. We are both retired. We get our pension. We get our social security. She got her...she\ngot 3 kids: 3 boys. And she...her husband got a good job with the government; and they have\nhuge house in Silver Spring. So everything right now seems to be okay.",
        "A: It was a rough time. But they say if you want to, you can make it, and we made it.",
        "A: And can't complain anymore.",
        "A: My mother's...real mother's family?",
        "A: There is no more anymore. My mother died. My mother died in Newburg, actually, in the\n'70s. Her parents came from the Czechoslovakia. They died. Actually, my real grandmother\nwas with us in Theresienstadt. And she was...she was in the 70s, and she got out. She used to\nlive in Paris for a long time after that, after '45. But I was...",
        "A: I mean, she...when it was liquidated and the Americans freed them--or the Russians,\nwhoever was there. She was still alive, and her daughter died. She made it, you know. She\nhad a lot of kids. And they met in France; and I lost track of them, you know. But otherwise,\neverybody else is in America. My father's side...my father's side, uh, my grandmother, of\ncourse, 1s long dead. And my grandfather died already earlier. And his two brothers, my\nfather's two brothers--one was engineer, he worked in Italy, got malaria, he died young. And\nthe other one was uh...was a doctor; and after the war was over, he divorced his wife in\nVienna, he came over here. He got all his exams made over, and he married a nurse. And\nthey were...they settled down in Cleveland, and we visited them a couple of times. But uh\nthey both dead now. So what we have left in Vienna 1s only a cousin and her children, and\nanother one. And so...and friends. One of my best friends. The best friend I had at that time,\nhe died a couple of weeks ago. He went with me through all this, so to the end. And his wife,\ntoo. But she's still alive. But he had...he was diabetic from way back; and then lately he\ngot...he got 2 heart attacks, and he couldn't make it, he was sick. It was just a couple of\nweeks ago, I found out that he... And he just retired. That's the terrible thing about the retire.\nHe used to...we worked for...he was a director in the bank. He had a good life and\neverything, you know. Now when he finally retired, 1t was 65 when he died, two years later\nhe's gone. That's real sad. And a few months the insurance stop. You enjoy your life. Save all\nyour life, and then you go. The same thing happened, too. I used to work in the Mayflower;\nand my head waiter, uh, came from Europe too. He was Jewish too. He worked his way up\nfrom bus boy to Maitre d'. He worked over 30, 35 years there. He retired that spring, and he\nwas dead in September. He had a brain tumor. This is true. And I was wonder how we come\nout...we came out alive, you know. We went through so much. My wife was always...was\nreally with one foot already in the grave, waiting.",
        "A: I don't know. I really couldn't say. Maybe believing that we, if we try enough we can get out\nof it, but I couldn't really answer that. When I saw these guys passing away like flies, why\nnot me? I could have the same thing, you know. There was very few that really got out of it,\nand so it's hard to say. I'm not too religious, but I still believe somebody up there must like\nme, you know. I came through, and the same with her.",
        "A: No. Oh, My God, you got to hurry. Yah, I gonna make the...1t takes me under a half hour to\nget home.",
