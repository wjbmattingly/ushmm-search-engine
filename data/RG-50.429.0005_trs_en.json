        "Q: ... name, date of birth.",
        "A: My name is Margaret Lambert. I was born, a name that I hate, Gretl, it\u2019s too\nTeutonic. I hate that name and Gretl Bergman and I was born April 12, 1914 ina\nvery small town in the south of Germany and it was a great life.",
        "Q: And what was the town called?",
        "A: Laupheim.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about that great life.",
        "A: Well we had all the freedom that we needed, could roam around every place, once\nI had a bicycle at the age of 7, I could go into the countryside and hunt for frogs\nand snakes and stuff like this and lots of friends, mostly non Jewish friends. We,\nthere was a large Jewish community in the town but due to my love for sports,\nmost of my friends were non Jewish and that was never, never, never a problem\nuntil a certain time of my life.",
        "Q: Tell me about your family.",
        "A: My father had a terrific sense of humor and I think I inherited it from him and he\nhad a large factory making hair goods, hair nets, wigs, one of the, some of them\nfound their way even into the metropolitan opera and my mother was, I don\u2019t\nknow she was a little bit of a, a kvetch if you know what that means. She was\nalways trying to get our attention by saying oh I have this terrible headache and so\non and so, and I don\u2019t think she was a, she was not a very warm person because\nboth I and my, my two brothers we felt she was inapproachable but we had a\ngood, good time together. I had a brother who was two years older. Then I gota\nlittle baby brother when I, he was 12 years younger which embarrassed the heck\nout of me because I didn\u2019t think parents should engage in this sort of stuff. And\nbut we were all very good friends. My brother died unfortunately very suddenly\nabout 20 years ago on a pleasure trip and my younger brother I\u2019m in touch with\nand we have a good, very good relationship.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your religious background.",
        "A: There was no organized religion in my house. We ate everything, we did\neverything, we never went to the temple except on the high holidays and I hated it\nbecause I had to wear a hat. And my father, he used to say to us, be a decent\n1\n2\nhuman being, that should be your religion and I think we, he followed that and we\nfollowed it too. And religion never meant anything to me and especially after all\nthe things that happened later on. If I ever had any religious feelings I think I\nwould have lost it pretty fast after all the things that happened to the Jewish\npeople.\nQ; ...did you identify with being a Jew as a girl?",
        "A: Well only in the fact that I was Jewish and I had to go to temple twice a year but\nit, it didn\u2019t, it didn\u2019t make any difference because nobody cared. I was the only\ngirl in my class and I was the only Jew in my class and there was never, never an\nunpleasant and you didn\u2019t think of yourself as a Jew. You thought of yourself as\na German I think.",
        "Q: So you never experienced anti \u2014 Semitic feelings before Hitler arrived on the\nscene?",
        "A: No, I only once I said some neighbor boy called me a dirty Jew and I beat him up\nand I was never bothered again so that was it.",
        "Q: So the events of 1933 and onward must have come as a shock to you.",
        "A: It most certainly did. It was, it was terrible. I mean from one day to other, to the\nother there was like a wall you know one day you were a respected citizen. The\nnext day you were a, a tenth rate citizen. You were banned from all public places,\nno theatres , no restaurants, no swimming pools, you couldn\u2019t go any place and\nyou could not associate with non- Jewish people.",
        "Q: ... your athletic life before 1933.",
        "A: When I was about 6 years old there was this little club in the town and you could\ngo as often as you wanted in the afternoon or in the evening whoever was ready\nthere, the older people helped the younger people how to do certain things and it\nwas great, you just went there. I could go there un, unescorted because it was\nclose to my house and I spent some time there and I was happy as a lark.",
        "Q: What did you do there?",
        "A: Well we did gymnastics, we did running, we did whatever, whatever you know\nthere was a lot of gymnastics involved and they worked on the parallel bars which\nI hated. I hated that stuff because I wasn\u2019t good at it because my legs were too\nlong I guess. And but they instructed us the older people, and there was a terrific\nrelationship. They would take us out Sundays to go swimming and it was really\nvery nice.",
        "Q: What did you like about sports?\n2\n3",
        "A: I just loved it.",
        "Q: You just loved what?",
        "A: I loved everything that had to do with physical activity. I loved to climb. I loved\nto run. I, I just loved, loved to be outdoors, it, it was, I skied, I skated, I swam.\nNobody ever told me anything. I played tennis, I played ping-pong. Nobody ever\ntold me anything. It was just, I was a natural athlete and whatever I started to do,\nI did well without being instructed in anything so, it was the, I liked it better than\nmathematics let me tell you.",
        "Q: And you were good at it.",
        "A: And I was good at it, without working very hard at it.",
        "Q: Did sports start playing a very significant role in your life?",
        "A: Well once I got to be in the age where I got to be noticing boys it became a very\nimportant thing in my life because that was the social life then, you know you\nwent to the gym and uh the boy you had your eye on walked you home and that\nwas a big deal and that was very good.",
        "Q: Was sports important in Germany growing up?",
        "A: Yes, I think there was hardly the smallest little village that didn\u2019t have some kind\nof sports going. If it was just a soccer club, club. You know they play soccer\nand, and team sports more but there were very few places where there was\nnothing going on and that was a very important thing and once I got a little older,\nmaybe 14 or so, we used to go to other little towns and compete there and that\nwas really like a lot of fun and you met a lot of new people and, and it was, it was\ngreat.",
        "Q: Were there a lot of sporting clubs and...",
        "Q: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. Has nothing to do with the school as a matter of fact. I\nthink that\u2019s why I hated school so much because whenever I came into school on\nMonday the teachers would make fun of me and say oh you must have had a\ntough weekend again. Maybe you were playing field hand ball or something and\nwhy don\u2019t you pay more attention to your, your lessons and I think that turned me\noff more than anything else and I turned more to sports then instead of less, the\nway I thought I would.\n(Technical interruption)",
        "Q: ...a future in athletics, in terms of Olympic competition.\n3\n4",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe so at that time. That came much later really. But when I was quite\nsmall, maybe 10, 12 years old, I had made up my mind, I will be a physical\neducation teacher or a coach. And I knew exactly where to go in Berlin and study\nthere and it didn\u2019t work out that way because by the time I was ready for it, I\nwasn\u2019t accepted anymore but uh I always wanted to be in sports.",
        "Q: Not necessarily competitively but...",
        "A: No, just teaching and coaching and you know later on once I got too old to do it\nmyself.",
        "Q: So you weren\u2019t thinking about competitions and Olympics...",
        "A: Well, I, I don\u2019t think that I really thought about the Olympics. I don\u2019t even think I\nknew much about the Olympics. You know we lived in this small hick town that\ndid have a newspaper but I think it was more important to see that the chickens\nlaid the eggs or whatever than you know all they would report the sports results of\nwhat happened in that town. But nothing really you didn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t get much\ninformation. There wasn\u2019t any television of course and the radio came much later\nso I don\u2019t think that I knew much about the Olympics until I got a lot later.",
        "Q: ...and the radio came later.",
        "A: There was no, was no television, of course, no television whatsoever. And radio\nalso came you know it wasn\u2019t there when I was very small.",
        "Q: There was nothing different at that stage about being a Jewish athlete?",
        "A: None whatsoever. I\u2019ve said this so many times that there was absolutely no\ndifference between the Jewish people and the gentile people. There were not that\nmany Jewish people doing sports, let\u2019s face it and especially not girls. But I\nnever, never felt any, any different. I mean we would go Sundays go to a nice\nswimming hole and go swimming and very often was the only Jewish person\ngoing so there was nothing. I felt perfectly comfortable.",
        "Q: Were your parents or your brothers athletic also?",
        "A: No. No, nobody, nobody I don\u2019t know where I got it from, I really don\u2019t. But my\nbrothers liked to watch it but they, they didn\u2019t do much by themselves, I mean my\nbrother, my oldest brother skied a little bit but nothing very, not like I. I mean I\nwas possessed I think by sports.",
        "Q: You started to talk about when things began changing for you as a young athlete\nand I\u2019d like you to talk about that a little bit more...\n4\n5",
        "A: In the spring of 1933, it was just around my birthday and it was not a very nice\nbirthday present, I got a letter from my sports club, you are no longer welcome\nhere because you\u2019re Jewish. Heil Hitler and that was the end of that. So they just\nthrew me out of the club and that was the end of my sports career as far as that\nwas concerned. There was no Jewish sports per se in the town because everything\nwas always mixed up you know. There was everybody did things together. But\nwe, we were just locked out of everything. All the Jews were thrown out of the\nsports club. All the Jews, you couldn\u2019t go to, to a restaurant. I mean Jews were\nexcluded from all German life. That started in 1933 and it was a horrible time.\nThere was one Jewish restaurant in, in, in that town and everybody congregated\nthere and everybody commiserated you know. What are we going to do, what\u2019s\ngoing to happen here. And it was a horrible life.",
        "Q: Was any of this anticipated, did you know much about Hitler?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it was anticipated in the realm the way it happened. Um once he\nstarted, you know became chancellor...",
        "Q: ...say once Hitler...",
        "A: Once Hitler became chancellor you started to worry a little bit you know but\neverybody thought this is, this is going to blow over, he\u2019s not going to last. As a\nmatter of fact, I had been accepted at the University for physical education in\nBerlin. For the spring semester and I wrote them a letter saying that I was Jewish\nand would it be advisable for me to come just then. And they wrote me a letter\nback literally saying wait until this thing blows over so everybody thought this is\nnot going to last. But once Hitler had you know taken hold you were just afraid\nfor your life if you, if you disobeyed or whether it was a Jew or whether it was a\ngentile, you did exactly as you were told, like in a real dictatorship.",
        "Q: ...how your life changed...life for a teenaged girl...",
        "A: It was a terrible, terrible time. It was, it was almost, you couldn\u2019t understand,\nwhy did this happen, why aren\u2019t those people associating with us any more. I\nmean some of the friends stayed with us you know. But only in a. a very in a way\nthey couldn\u2019t be caught to come to our house for instance. They had to come in\nthe middle of the night and sneak in the back door if they wanted to visit with us.\nBut a lot of them did change that, you know they went the other way and they\nfigured well maybe Hitler is out god from now on and we will stay with him but it\nwas, it was very bad. We didn\u2019t know what to do with ourselves, you couldn\u2019t go\nanywheres. You couldn\u2019t go into a restaurant, you couldn\u2019t go into a movie and\nespecially in a small town. In a large town I guess you could bear to go to a\nmovie every once in a while or a restaurant but not in a small town. Everybody\nknew everybody else and, and you just didn\u2019t do it and if you did it, \u2019'm sure, you\nwould be punished according to Hitler\u2019s credo, whatever.\n5\n6",
        "Q: Did you feel betrayed by friends...",
        "A: Yes, some of them. There was a girl next door to me, we grew up together as\nbabies. We were together every single day. She ate in our house more times than\nshe ate in her own house and soon as Hitler came in she didn\u2019t know me any more\nand that was it. She had the chance to sneak into the house just like anybody else,\nyou know other friends did. But she never made that attempt and maybe 2 years\nago she wrote me a letter, the first trme I ever heard from her. My dear, darling\nyou know stuff like this and I\u2019m so happy to finally find your address and the\ngood times we had together and stuff like this. And I wrote her back. I said yes it\nwas a good time but you didn\u2019t think so then because you didn\u2019t know me any\nmore. That was the end of that friendship.\n(technical adjustment)",
        "Q: ...how life changed in *33, give me a picture of what that was like...",
        "A: It is absolutely impossible for anybody who hasn\u2019t gone through this what it was\nlike to be among friends one day and the next day you would pass that same\nfriend in the street and you wouldn\u2019t even say hello to each other because you\nwere not, some you were not allowed to do it. Or some were afraid to do it but\nyou just passed your friends up, friend or walk right on. And for instance, my\nyounger brother is 12 years younger than I and he had all the kids from the\nneighborhood were his friends. They played together all non Jewish children and\nthey all played together and all of a sudden after 1933 they started to beat him up\nand on his way to school, he had to go to a Jewish school because the other\nschools would not take him and on the way to school they beat him up. And I\nwould walk him to school as often as I could. And they wouldn\u2019t beat him up\nwhen I was there but they would call him and me all kinds of horrible names and\nthey would spit at us. And I wouldn\u2019t dare to touch those children because if I\nhad touched a non Jewish child I would have been in a concentration camp the\nnext day. So we really vegetated, there was nothing to do except worrying that,\nwhat\u2019s going to happen. My brother was working for a universal pictures and\nthey had a, a studio in Berlin.",
        "Q: Your older brother?",
        "A: My older brother and they closed up because they saw what was coming, and they\nclosed up and he came home because there was nothing for him to do. So he\nstarted to work in, in my father\u2019s factory. You know try to do make himself\nuseful there because there was, he couldn\u2019t find a job of course, nobody would\nemploy you. Gentile people were not allowed to, to but in Jewish stores for\ninstance. If somebody got caught doing that they would take their pictures and\nhang them up at the city hall. I mean they really meant business. You know they\nwere absolutely excluded from everything.\n6\n7",
        "Q: As a family did you talk about this, did you try to make sense of it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that really. I think we were just into ourselves more or less, you\nknow everybody was worrying on their own but I don\u2019t think 1t was discussed all\nthat much until I finally decided that this was no life, you know so, in from the\nspring of 1933 then finally in the, in the fall, I said I have to get out of here, I\ncan\u2019t live like this. And I, I decided to go to England then and my parents agreed\nto it that I would go to England because it was a life of just vegetating. And\ntalking about the same thing over, what is going to happen to us. Talking the\nsame thing over and over again and not to come to any result. I mean nobody\nwould know, knew what, what was going to happen.",
        "Q: In this period then did you essentially have to give up your athletics?",
        "A: Oh yes we did try to straighten out an old potato acre, that somebody had given\nus, one of our Jewish families there. And we, we ran there and I started a field\nhand ball, which is the same as football except it\u2019s like a combination of\nbasketball and, and football. And I coached them and it takes in 11 people I\nthink. I was the only girl on the team and I shot the only goal the first time we,\nwe lost 7 to 1 and I shot the only goal. But after a while everybody got tired of\nthis, you know the same people every day. It, it was horrible, that was they had\nan orchestra there, I mean there were many Jewish people who played the violin\nand, we, we played a little music but there really wasn\u2019t anything to do, so.",
        "Q: And your father was able to remain in business?",
        "A: For a time being, yes. Because he did a lot of business with the United States and\nEngland.",
        "Q: Can you say my father...",
        "A: My father did a lot of business with England and the United States and the\nGermans desperately the foreign currency to come in so they were already\npreparing for the war effort I suppose and that\u2019s why the, they left him on for a\nwhile but then after several years, he was just like a figurehead on there. And the\nNazis took over and but he couldn\u2019t leave because they took passport away so he\nwas stuck until a certain time came when he was able to, to get out.",
        "Q: You said that you had decided that you wanted to go to England, this was just you\nalone?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about that please.\n7\n8",
        "A: Um, I couldn\u2019t stand the life that we had and my brother was working in my\nfather\u2019s business but I had nothing to do you know. And my mother tried to teach\nme how to be a housewife, you know cooking and washing and ironing. That\nwasn\u2019t my deal so I decided or my parents decided I would go to England and\nfind a school comparable to the one in Berlin that didn\u2019t take me and that\u2019s where\nI went in, I think it was in October of 1933.",
        "Q: How did that pan out?",
        "A: I, it was OK, it was, it was a very weird time too. I mean I was very friendly with\nthe girls in school. I couldn\u2019t find a school that I wanted to go to, a physical\neducation so I went to school to learn English. I figured you know better than\nnothing and it was OK. They had a, a track program that they immediately took\nme into it and I competed for them and won everything in sight, whatever I did.\nYou know whether it was running or jumping or discus or whatever it was. And in\nthe school I was a big shot. However um what was very odd. I was very friendly\nwith the girls in you know some of the girls. I was never once invited to\nanybody\u2019s house. Now why I do not know. Maybe I was considered German.\nMaybe they, I was somehow discriminated against even though I tried to get away\nfrom discrimination when I went to England but somehow I was discriminated\nagainst. I mean when foreigners came to, to Laupheim, we made these people\ncomfortable and they were our friends, that they came to our house. Not in\nEngland, not once in 9 months, 10 months, 11 months was I allowed to, was I\ninvited into anybody\u2019s house. That really hurt.",
        "Q: Were there other Jews in the school?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure there were but then again I didn\u2019t pay much attention to it you know. I\ndid not seek out other Jews to be my friends. I was just friendly with all the kids.",
        "Q: So you competed you kept up our athletics?",
        "A: Yes and it was heaven, it was heaven. It wasn\u2019t much of a program they had in\nschool but it was nice to be back to you know they only did it, no they did it\noutdoors too. And then in, in June of 1934, I competed in the British\nchampionships and I won and that was a really big deal because then already I felt\nlike it was so satisfying to me to win this, you know and I was sure this would be\nknown in Germany and it was like a revenge kind of thing you know. There you\nsee, Iam a Jew but I have won the British championship so I was really very, very\nhappy about that.",
        "Q: In what events were you...",
        "A: High jumping, that was my, my big event, high jumping, thanks to my long legs\nand my big feet, I suppose. I had great success in it and it was very interesting.\nMy English was atrocious of course, yeah. And the other girls didn\u2019t bother much\n8\n9\nwith me because I was an outsider so it was kind of lonely but it didn\u2019t matter. I\nwon and that was my father came over.\n(End tape)",
        "Q: ...to backtrack...alternative outlets...",
        "A: We made our own alternative outlets. We tried of course I was being in the torn in\nthe direction of sports, as I said before, we played music and we tried to entertain\nourselves as well as we could. But sports for me of course was the, the thing I\nwanted the most. So a farmer let us have an old potato field and we tried to make\nit smooth, you know it\u2019s very rough, you know big clumps on there and we tried\nto, to smooth it out and we started our own Jewish hand ball team on there, hand\nball is a game like soccer except that you don\u2019t kick the ball. You dribble it like a\nbasketball and you pass it you know throwing it and it\u2019s a great game. And I\ncoached all the fellows on the team and I was the only girl on the team and I shot\nthe only goal in the first time when we lost 7 to 1. And we also tried to straighten\nout, next to the Jewish school there was a, a yard and we tried to straighten that\nout to do calisthenics on it. Because the soccer field was a, the handball field was\na little bit out of the way so we tried to straighten that out but we had to fight the\nteachers\u2019 chickens and they used that same place for their activities and it was not\nvery appetizing so we gave up on that pretty fast.\n(Technical adjustment)",
        "Q: Were there Jewish sporting clubs?",
        "A: There were Jewish sporting clubs. Maccabee they called it, but it was a Zionistic\noutfit and it was like the National League and the American League in baseball.\nThey didn\u2019t get along with, with the other Jewish athletes so they, they called\nthem the RFJ was people who fought in the first world war, they, they were the\nveterans they started this club for athletics and they were able in some towns to\nrent or even buy I don\u2019t know stadiums where Jews could, could practice on but\nthe facilities were pretty poor, pretty terrible but as I said we tried to do as much\nas we could to entertain ourselves and there was no, no coach capable of, you\nknow anybody who was a little bit more of advanced like I was to tell me what,\nhow to do it and what to do and it was just a very, very bad time.",
        "Q: Jewish clubs, were they already in operation or were they formed in reaction?",
        "A: I think they were mostly formed after the, as I said the Maccabee, they were\nformed before already but the uh, veterans of foreign wars I think they called\nthemselves, that, that came afterwards. You know in all the towns almost\nespecially in the bigger towns, they, they start a movement so Jews would have a\nplace to go to and and, and do sports.\n9\n10",
        "Q: What kind of facilities were they?",
        "A: Poor, mostly pretty poor, you know I think they only let you, the Germans would\nnot give you anything very good. They let you have the, the garbage places, you\nknow that nobody else wanted most likely, that\u2019s what they gave the Jewish\npeople.",
        "Q: So this made it difficult for the Jewish athletes to really improve or be\ncompetitive?",
        "A: Oh yes. Oh yes. I mean it was, it was very bad to, to really achieve something\nspectacular because it was just, it\u2019s 1t was a poor condition and no coaching. That\nwas, that was, that was bad too.",
        "Q: ... Jump forward to England...British National Championships.",
        "A: Well the day I won the British championship, as I said that was a fabulous day for\nme.",
        "Q: ...don\u2019t say as I said.",
        "A: OK. The day I won the British Championship was a fabulous day for me because\nI felt such pride in myself that I was able to do that because the Germans had told\nme I\u2019m inferior, I\u2019m no good, you know. And all of a sudden here I am the\nBritish champion, champion. And I was hoping that somehow word would go\nback to Germany so they would find out that I did this. And my father had come\nover to watch me, I thought. I thought he, that was the reason for his trip, trip to\nwatch me compete but on the way back from the stadium, we found out\ndifferently. My, he didn\u2019t tell me right away. He waited until we got back to his\nhotel. But on the way back there, there were newspapers being hawked in the\nstreet and everything seemed like to be big excitement. We asked the taxi driver\nwhat\u2019s going on. And he said has something to do with the Nazis killing each\nother off. So we stopped the taxi and we got out, got the newspaper and it told the\nstory about Hitler having killed off his best friend, plus about a thousand of his\nNazi people because they, they complained about something and he wanted to\nshow you. You just didn\u2019t do that. You did as you were told and when we\nthought that this might have been the beginning of the end for Hitler we couldn\u2019t\nhave been more wrong because Hitler by killing off these people let everybody\nknow if you want to stay alive, don\u2019t be a hero. So we got to the hotel (clears\nthroat) excuse me. And there my father finally told me that I had to go back to\nGermany and the reason he could not write to me or tell me on the telephone was\nbecause there was this strict censorship of everything coming into Germany or\ngoing out of Germany. And he couldn\u2019t have dared to tell me that unless I came\nback the family was being threatened you know. Tell her to come back or else.\nSo of course I decided immediately to go home, especially in view of what\nhappened to Hitler\u2019s pals. If he can kill of his own people, what is he going to, to\n10\n11\na Jew who says no. And I went back, I think within a week I was back in\nGermany which was very, very hard to accept. I was supposed to be a member of\nthe German Olympic team and that was something I couldn\u2019t understand and\ndidn\u2019t understand for a very long time. I think I didn\u2019t understand it until I came\nover here and saw all the newspaper articles that had been written about my\ninvolvement with this time. The only reason I was supposed to be on that\nOlympic team was because the Americans, and the English and the French and a\nlot of the other nations threatened not to come to the 1936 Olympics due to the\ndiscrimination of the Jews. And Hitler wanted to make this the best Olympics\never. He used it as a propaganda vehicle, and he wanted of course the United\nStates and all the big nations to be there. And this was the, the ruse that they\nused. I was the pigeon to help him get the 1936 Olympics settled and in Berlin.\nThey were already making, building and change, you know making a stadium and\neverything but they were really afraid that the, that 1t would not be a good\nOlympics for them because the big nations weren\u2019t going to show up and that\nwould take away from the, from the, from the games of course. So that\u2019s how I\ngot on the German Olympic team and it was tough.",
        "Q: How did your father get this information that they wanted you to come back?",
        "A: Well that was, it was very peculiar. My father told me at the time, the way he had\nto come to England to tell me a person. Somebody showed up at our house in\nLaupheim to tell him that he also could not write to my father that the family\nwould be in, in danger if I didn\u2019t come back. So if this man traveled to Laupheim,\ntold my father, my father traveled to England, told me and that was alike a relay\nrace you know. Avoiding danger.",
        "Q: ...did you know that you were going to fill a symbolic role?",
        "A: No but I knew that I would be the only Jew because there were nobody else. I\nmean it sounds kind of conceited but there really wasn\u2019t another 100% Jewish\nathlete who could have competed in the Olympics. And you know having a\nchance to win a medal. They just weren\u2019t, weren\u2019t good enough. I mean that\u2019s,\nthat\u2019s, that\u2019s the way it was.",
        "Q: In Germany\u201d",
        "A: In Germany. And I didn\u2019t know that I was going, at first that I was going to be\nthe only one. And in Germany nobody knew anything about this. This was\nstrictly nothing was in the papers about this. That they were, that the Olympics\nweren\u2019t such good shape. No they only heard the Olympics is going to be the best\nthing you ever experienced in Germany and all this stuff and there was nothing in\nthe papers that there was a danger that it wouldn\u2019t be, that it would be a flop.",
        "Q: Do you remember the reaction of the German community to your coming back\u2019?\n11\n12",
        "A: Um I think that the Jewish community, they were very proud of me. I mean after\na while word spread around that this Jewish girl who might be competing in the\nOlympics and of course I was like the bright Jewish hope you know that the, the\ngreat white hope and this boxer whoever he was, I was the great Jewish hope and\nI mean people were proud of me and the they wished me the best and it was a\nterrible time for me because they would, I would be asked all these ridiculous\nquestions. Are you going to be competing in the Olympics, and aren\u2019t. What are\nyou going to do and how are you going to, to conduct yourself. I said I don\u2019t\nknow. I mean how do I know what\u2019s going to happen. I'll just have to play it by\near and that\u2019s exactly what I did.",
        "Q: Did you think that you would go forward and participate in the Olympics at this\nstage?",
        "A: Well maybe I was hoping for it in a way and maybe I was hoping for it.",
        "Q: I need you to say...",
        "A: Oh yes, Iam sorry. In a way I was hoping I would be in the Olympics because to\ncompete in the Olympics 1s the thrill of a lifetime. I mean it and it doesn\u2019t happen\nto everybody, you know you have to be good enough to do it. On the other hand I\nwas so afraid. Supposing I am allowed to compete, supposing I win and I was\nconvinced that I would win a medal and possibly the gold. Supposing I do this,\nwhat, what do I do. I\u2019m going to stand on that podium and, and say Heil Hitler\nlike all the others, I mean that, that was the accepted way to, to say well I won,\nyou know you had to stand up there and say Heil Hitler. I was scared stiff and\nthis was going around in my head day and night, day and night, day and night.\nHow I'll, what\u2019s going to happen, am I going to compete, am I not going to\ncompete? How do I (clears throat) conduct myself if I do compete. It was a\nterrible.",
        "Q: You were very conflicted about this.",
        "A: Oh yes. I was so, so torn up about it, I didn\u2019t know what to do and it was not only\nthat but I mean I met with the other girls, you know not Jewish competition or so.\nI was always afraid how are they going to react to me and at the Olympic training\ncourses that I was ordered to attend, they, they couldn\u2019t have been any nicer. All\nthe girls accepted me fully. No anti\u2014 Semitism. Nothing I mean I was just an\nathlete like all the other athletes and I wrote many, many years later, I mean after\n1980 I wrote to one of them. I said I can\u2019t understand why you were so nice to\nme. Did you really know I was Jewish. And she wrote back to me, sure we knew\nyou were Jewish but you were an, a good athlete like we were good athletes and\nthat was all that counted to us and politics didn\u2019t mean anything to us, she said in\nthe letter. But I\u2019m sure that she as well as many of the other girls were members\nof the Nazi party. I mean there is this conflict again. You know they\u2019re Nazis\n12\n13\nand still they, they accept me the Jewish girl, doesn\u2019t make any sense, it didn\u2019t\nmake any sense.\n(Water break)",
        "Q: So you came back to Germany...training and preparation...",
        "A: When I got back to Germany I was hoping I would at least have a place where I\ncould train. But the fact that I was a member of the German Olympic team did\nnot allow me to use any of the stadiums. I was still a Jew and was not allowed to\nuse any of this. So I had to use the poor facilities of the Jewish clubs and compete\nthere for them. And that was, was absolutely terrible because first of all there was\nno competition whatsoever. If you don\u2019t have any competition it\u2019s, you have to\nonly fight yourself and that\u2019s much harder than somebody you know if there\u2019s\nstiff competition you try to outdo each other. But when there\u2019s no competition\nit\u2019s very hard so I always had to fight myself and it was really very, very tough.\nAnd then of course all those stupid questions I have to answer. You know\neverybody asked me are you going to be in the Olympics. You know what are\nyou going to do. I was a nervous wreck I think and day and night, things were on\nmy mind. It was really horrible. And my parents and I we didn\u2019t discuss it\nbecause I knew they were worried about it and they knew I was worried about it\nso we didn\u2019t talk about it. Because we, we didn\u2019t want to hurt each other\u2019s\nfeelings I suppose so it, it was very, very hard.",
        "Q: How does one train for the Olympics if you\u2019re not on the same playing field...",
        "A: I was ordered three times, four times in those two years to go to an Olympic\ntraining course and that\u2019s the only solid training I had for the Olympics and as I\nsaid before, I think I said it before that I was a natural athlete and if I hadn\u2019t been\na, a natural athlete I don\u2019t think I would have achieved what I did because there\njust wasn\u2019t any, any opportunity for me, for me to, to get better or to advance or to\nknow what I was doing, it just happened naturally.",
        "Q: ...1f there had been good Jewish athletes...they wouldn\u2019t have had an opportunity\nto progress and be competitive with the German athletes. Is that true?",
        "A: There were very few Jewish athletes who really were capable to compete on a\nnational level. I mean there were, the best Jewish athletes let\u2019s say, but they\nweren\u2019t the best German athletes. And they really, really couldn\u2019t compare, they\nwere very, very few and there were some for instance in the Olympics, there was\na fencer Helena Myer, she was half Jewish, they let her compete, I guess half\nJewish was only half as offensive as being all Jewish. And there were some half\nJewish athletes that competed--one in, 1n ice hockey so he, he melted into the, you\nknow into the team so he wouldn\u2019t stick out like I would have stuck out. But I\ndon\u2019t think there were any Jewish athletes really that were capable of be,\ncompeting on, on a national level.\n13\n14",
        "Q: ...the backing to get better.",
        "A: No, the, the Germans did another number. They you know every time there were\nsome newspaper articles written that they\u2019re not holding up their end of our, that\nthey finally signed a commitment that they would not discriminate against Jewish\nathletes. They, they wrote it down and but there were all these newspaper articles\nthat they were not living up to their commitment, that they wouldn\u2019t let me\ncompete in the German national championship. And they said well she was not\nentitled to compete in that because she was not a member of the German track and\nfield association. And why wasn\u2019t I member, because I was Jewish. And so you\nknow it was like a dog chasing it\u2019s tail. And so it, they had, they had all kinds of,\nof, of ways to talk themselves out of it. They for instance, in 1935 for instance\nthey got a little scared again so they called all the best Jewish athletes for a\ntraining course, an Olympic training course. I said 1n an article once, I think\nSnow White and the seven dwarfs would have done just as well as those athletes\nbecause they weren\u2019t any good. I happened to meet my husband there, that was\nthe best part about this training course, really. But they really weren\u2019t good\nenough but it was just a sham by, by the Germans to show well we, we\u2019re trying\nto find new talent for the Olympics in the Jewish community but it, that was all\nbaloney.",
        "Q: Did you learn anything there...",
        "A: Well there was a very good coach there and but I think what he told me I knew\nalready, you know by then this is 1935 already and the Olympics were the\nfollowing year and I did very well all along and in the training courses I always\noutdid the, my the other you know 1n, in not the Jewish one but in the other one. I\nalways did better than, than the other, than the German girls and whenever I\ncompeted which only happened three times I think in the, in the 2 years, I always\nbeat them. Even though I only once did I have good competition, girls that were\nalso going into the Olympics. The other times I think I jumped about 15 inches\nhigher than the next best and you know there was no, I had no competition in that\nrespect and in the Jewish competitions also. But the, the Germans always kept an\neye out. Whenever I was competing someplace, there was always somebody\nwatching out, for the, for the Nazis to make sure if I did poorly, they would have\nkicked me off the team immediately I\u2019m sure.",
        "Q: ...equanimity from the officials and from the coaches.",
        "A: The coaches treated me very well, I mean they saw and listen not everybody was\na, was a Nazi you know. And that they treated me very well and they liked me it\nseems but the officials whenever I had to compete at the, at, they were, they were\nhostile, I think they were hostile towards me. At one time I saw this fellow who\nwas a member of my former club. I knew him as well as I know myself. He\nlooked through me like I didn\u2019t exist. He didn\u2019t say hello. He didn\u2019t, you know I\n14\n15\nwas just not, non \u2014 existent. And at that competition they tried, I mean the\nofficials are supposed to be neutral. They tried to teach the other girls how to you\nknow, how they could beat me. They didn\u2019t do that, of course, they couldn\u2019t\nbecause they weren\u2019t good enough.",
        "Q: That must have been hurtful.",
        "A: Yes, but it, it made me better because I was so full of rage, the madder I got, the\nbetter I jumped and the Germans didn\u2019t know that of course, otherwise they might\nhave treated me a little better. But I was so, so absolutely enraged about\neverything, you know, the whole, the whole thing these whole two years that I,\nthe madder I got, the better I did. And that was, that was wonderful.",
        "Q: So rage was your motivator.",
        "A: Rage was my fuel. You know fueled my energies. And my motivator. It was, it\nwas, it was, it was really weird.",
        "Q: Took you on to new heights.",
        "A: Unh hunh.",
        "Q: ...was there a qualifying process?",
        "A: Well for instance the um German track and field championships, they were\nsupposed to be one of the events that would show who was going to be taken into\nconsideration for the Olympics but they wouldn\u2019t let me compete because it\u2019s, I\nwas not a member of the German track and field association so I couldn\u2019t\ncompete, but they, they, they at one time I, I had to compete in Munich which was\nthe scariest thing because Munich was the hot bed of, of Nazism. That was where\nHitler lived there and I was scared stiff to go there and I didn\u2019t do that well and it\nwas noted, duly noted by the Nazis that I only jumped a, a meter 53 instead of\nbetter but I beat still, beat the competition by about 15 inches. But I didn\u2019t do as\nwell because I think I was mentally a wreck at the time.",
        "Q: Were there other qualifying matches?",
        "A: The gentile com, the gentile girls who were supposed to go into the Olympics\nthey had their own meets which I was not, not admitted and I think the whole deal\nwas just if I did fairly well they would not throw me out because they were still\nafraid that the boycott would happen so I think no matter what I did, I was pretty\nsafe at that point, even the, you know in Munich when I did not do too well, they\ncouldn\u2019t, they couldn\u2019t afford to throw me out at that point because they were still\nafraid the Americans wouldn\u2019t show up.",
        "Q: You just assumed you were going to be on the Olympic team.\n15\n16",
        "A: Yes, I think so. I think that I was going, be safe then until further notice and I\ndidn\u2019t know was I going to be, wasn\u2019t I going to be, what was I going to do. It\nwas a terrible time.\n(Tape change)",
        "Q: ...when you came back from England you were able to go to some school?",
        "A: When I came back from England I went to Stuttgart a couple of times during the\nmonth, because there the Jewish club had a stadium and they had invited me to\ncome and use that stadium so I happened to learn about a school, a not a Jewish\nschool it was a gentile owned school that for physical education, it was a private\nschool, not a university. And I thought Ill, I'll apply and see if they take me,\nfine. If they don\u2019t take me fine too and they did take me because they might have\ngot, they, they had to get permission from the government that they could accept a\nJew and I suppose that it was all in view of my being an Olympic candidate and\nhad they not let me go into that school, it might have come out into the other\ncountries and there might have been more, more problems for, for, for the\nOlympics for Germany. So they accepted me and it, I had a good time there, we\nwere all very friendly, the girls were all very friendly there and it was a big town\nand I could go in the afternoon after they were finished practicing we would go\ninto this caf\u00e9 and make pigs out of ourselves, eating whipped cream cake and\neverything and we had a terrific time there. And we were very friendly and it was\nnice. The only thing they would, they would prevent me, they, the curriculum had\nin it German gymnastics and they wouldn\u2019t let me take part in the German\ngymnastics, now why I don\u2019t know. Because the Jew and the German gymnastics\nthat was too, too much of a paradox I don\u2019t know. But the other girls, we just\nlaughed about it. We thought it was funny and by then I was so used to being\nexcluded that it wasn\u2019t such a big deal.",
        "Q: You were going to the caf\u00e9 and hanging out?",
        "A: Yes, it was good, it was good, it was, you know, the big time, in s big town you\ncould do more things, you could go to the movies and we did do a foolish thing\none time with these, with these girls. There were some, we were having a lot of\ngood times and laughing and carrying on and about six of us and there was a table\nfull of SS uni, uniformed SS men at the next table and they kept looking at us and\nlooking at us. Finally they came over and they tried to make dates with us. And\nthere\u2019s this big German blond guy trying to make a date with me and I said no and\nI said no. And the more he tried to make a date with me the more the other girls\nlaughed and we got hysterical. And it was, it was funny and it was stupid at the\nsame time cause had I been found out, I don\u2019t know what would ha, what would\nhave happened to me. But we were young and you didn\u2019t really you know think\nof any consequences that much.\n16\n17",
        "Q: ...Germans tried to sanitize anti \u2014 Semitism...apparent to you at all in Germany?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t really see these signs until, these anti \u2014 Semitic signs. I mean I knew I\nwas excluded from all public places but I don\u2019t think I saw ever any signs because\nI just didn\u2019t pay any attention to it, I suppose. I only noticed those in 1937 but I\nknow that Brundage the, the head of the American Olympic committee went over\nto Germany to see what was going on because here was so much resistance in\nAmerica against taking part in the Olympics so he went over there and I read later\non doing some research that Berlin was manicured terrifically, everything was\nclean, every, all the offending signs, dogs and Jews not allowed etcetera, etcetera,\nthey were all gone and Mr. Brundage was not a champion for Jewish causes as I\nhave heard, never spoke to any Jewish people, he just let himself be lulled into\nsome false sense of security by these Nazis saying everything is fine, we\u2019re doing\neverything we said we would do and he came back to the United States and said\neverything is fabulous over there and we\u2019ll be going.",
        "Q: You were aware of efforts in other countries to boycott the Olympics?",
        "A: Not at that time.",
        "Q: Say you heard it after.",
        "A: Yes, I was not, I was not aware of it at all.",
        "Q: Prior to the Olympics was there some qualifying meet in Stuttgart?",
        "A: Yes, after, after the...",
        "Q: ...School in Stuttgart...afford you opportunity to get ready for the Olympics?",
        "A: The school was very nice because I was able to do as much as I wanted to in\nsports. I, you know my, my body was reacting at the first, first few weeks I was a\ncomplete wreck because my body wasn\u2019t used to this kind of being used so much\nbut after a while I got you know my muscles got supple, supple again and it was,\nit was great to be back into every day, being into sports. We had, we had\ngymnastics, we had track and field. We played you know team sports. It was, it\nwas very nice and the first day I was scared stiff because I didn\u2019t know how the\ngirls would react to me and they greeted me, what\u2019s your name. My name 1s\nBergman. OK you\u2019re Bergie from now on and, and, and we were all the best of\nfriends, it was really very nice.",
        "Q: Were these facilities comparable to what the German athletes were practicing on?",
        "A: No. I, I mean the, the track and field was not bad but it wasn\u2019t in, in very good\nshape either and the, the male teacher there if he could beat me in high jumping\n17\n18\nwhich was really my specialty, he was so proud of himself and I mean as a man\nhe should have been doing much better than I did. But if he just beat me by an\ninch he was very happy.",
        "Q: ...the meet in Stuttgart.",
        "A: There must have been quite some protest again in the, in the Unites States. I\nknow that a Senator or Congressman Sellar that he was pleading in the congress\nnot to send a team over. There were, there were protest meets in Madison Square\nGarden, 20,000 people showed up. There was a lot of resistance and this must\nhave been the reason why they invited me to come to Stuttgart and, and that as in\n19, 1936 to, to compete at a meet there and it was really rough. You know when\nyou the only Jew you know people, if the spectators knew that I was Jewish they\ndidn\u2019t wish me well. I knew that much. And the, the officials were hostile. I\nthink I mentioned that before. And it was very hard to, to compete against\nmyself. So but I was so mad that I equaled the German record. The German\nrecord then was five foot three and I equaled that. I must have cleared it by, by 15\ninches at the time. I was so angry. And usually you have three tries for each\nheight you know you start at 4, 6 let\u2019s say. You have, if you do it the first time,\nfine. But you have to go over it by the third try otherwise you\u2019re eliminated.\nWell all the other girls were out by if they did about 4, 8 and they were all out and\nI kept going and going on and going. And every height I jumped over it on the\nfirst trme. So I did the 5, 3 and I think the, the officials most likely would have\nliked to poison but they didn\u2019t. And I was just so elated. I thought this is the first\nthing that ever happened to me, you know those lousy Nazis. And after that I\nwent home I think and I wanted to share this with my family and I think this was\nthe last time that I, I stayed in Stuttgart. I, I went home then and I said now this 1s\n4 weeks before the Olympics start. I better go home and see what happens. So I\nwent home and my parents were happy and my brothers were happy that I did this\nand I look for the mail everyday, what\u2019s going to happen, you know. What, what\nexcuses are they going to use, that as only one, one other German girl who, who\nwas capable of doing this right and how are they going to, if they don\u2019t want me\nin there how are they going to get rid of me. And I was really scared, aren\u2019t they\ngoing to break my leg or what are they going to do to, to eliminate me. But it was\nvery simple. One day a letter came and it said in view of the fact that you have\nbeen doing very poorly lately we did not select you for the Olympic team. Heil\nHitler and that was the end of it. And I said, I remember me sitting outside on the\nstoop and I got this letter and I must have used every profanity I knew and I knew\na lot of them and at the same time, I had such an incredible feeling of relief. It\u2019s\nall over now, now I know what\u2019s going to happen to me. It was just like, like the\nbiggest load was lifted off my shoulders and I know that was such a, a paradox.\nThat I was angry, very very angry at the same time so relieved. And I don\u2019t\nremember a thing about the Olympics.",
        "Q: Why were you so relieved?\n18\n19",
        "A: Well all this time I was worried how, first of all am I going to compete, am I not\ngoing to compete, how are they going to eliminate me or what am I going to do if\nI do compete and I do win a medal and I know the German way to, to\nacknowledge a victory you stand up on the, on the podium and Heil Hitler. And I\ndidn\u2019t see that happening for me too easily. That would, I mean how can you\nexpect a German girl to stand there and, and raise her arm in the Hitler salute.",
        "Q: You mean a Jewish girl?",
        "A: A Jewish girl and this was on my mind for 2 years. And all of a sudden I didn\u2019t\nhave to worry about it any more. And there was a, a terrific relief.",
        "Q: Did you also think about the crowd reaction or the government reaction to a win\non your part?",
        "A: Had I won the Olympics or had I been allowed to compete in the Olympics I\nwould have been a loser either way. Cause had I won there would have been such\na, an insult against the German psyche. How can the, a Jew be good enough to\nwin the Olympics. Then I would have had to be afraid for my life, \u2019m sure. And\nhad I lost I would have been made as a joke. See we knew that you couldn\u2019t have,\ncouldn\u2019t do this and that, that was on my mind all these years.",
        "Q: So you got this letter.\nA; (chuckles) excuse me.",
        "Q: ...letter that said you\u2019re not good enough...competed and tied German record.\nDidn\u2019t make much sense.",
        "A: I think that was the first time I really realized that my candidacy for an Olympic\nathlete was really all a sham, I wish, it was just something that the Germans did\nto, to fool the whole group. Maybe that\u2019s when I realized that I really don\u2019t even\nknow. I have, I think I have complete amnesia what happened to me after this. I\ncannot remember whether I watched the Olympics. I mean watch, you couldn\u2019t\nwatch there was not television but I listened to the Olympics. I followed the\nOlympics in the newspaper. I have no idea, I cannot, I have complete amnesia\nabout it.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know where you were?",
        "A: I knew where I was. Except I did not want to think about the Olympics. As a\nmatter of fact I, you know people all is for the best and my parents looked at me\nfeeling sorry for me and my brothers looked at me feeling sorry for me and 1s she\ngoing to freak out or what\u2019s going to happen to her. I said Ill have to get away\nfrom here. And I went to a spa under an assumed name of course, you couldn\u2019t\nyou know afford to nobody would take me if they knew I was Jewish. And I sat\n19\n20\nthere for two weeks. Not talking to anybody. I didn\u2019t want to be bothered with\nanybody. And I was just thinking about all this and what was going to happen\nand what did happen and that\u2019s when I realized I have to get out of Germany.\nThat\u2019s and I just made up my mind I\u2019m going to have to leave.",
        "Q: ...being very aware of the Olympics.",
        "A: I have completely, I to this day I can\u2019t remember what I did. Whether I knew\nwho did what or I notice this one person that I I knew that later on she came in\nthird a girl I was very friendly with. She came in third in the high jumping, a\nGerman girl and but whether I realized it at the time I do not know, I cannot\nremember.",
        "Q: At what point do you think you came to?",
        "A: I think that I only realized what was really going on once I came over to the\nStates. Friends of ours had saved all the newspaper articles where my name\u2019s up\nhere do you know with all the ups and downs and whether the Germans said and\nwhat the Americans said and what, what was going on and all their promises and\nall the, their excuses. The German excuses and I think that\u2019s the first time I really\nrealized how I was used as a political football.",
        "Q: Did the winners in your event, were the winners German?",
        "A: The high jump in the Olympics was won with the height of 5 foot, 3, the height I\nhad reached four weeks earlier and I had the best chance to win a medal. I could\nhave had the gold medal because (laughs) when I got mad, I did better, so I would\nhave been mighty mad seeing all those people out there with their uniforms on, all\nthe swastikas flying, I would have been really mad and I know I had a very good\nchance to win a medal.",
        "Q: Was it hard for you to come over to the United States, when did you come over\nhere?\nA; Well when I came back from that spa, I told my parents I\u2019m leaving. I cannot\nstay here anymore. This is no future for me. My brother had left already. He\ncame to the States in January I believe. No, no, no, no that was later. I said I\u2019m\nleaving and my father had a very good friend who came from this town. And who\nemigrated to the United States, became very rich here and when he visited our\ntown, I was the big shot you know the Olympic candidate. And he said to me oh\nany time you want to come to the United States, just let me know and I\u2019Il give you\nall the papers. So we wrote him a letter and said that we were now ready to\naccept his offer and pretty quick a letter came back saying well times are very bad\nin the United States and you might not be able to find a job and maybe things will\nget better in Germany and maybe you should rethink your future. Maybe you\nshould stay and see what happens. And my father wrote him a very strong letter\n20\n21\nback and he finally did give me the papers and I was able to come to the United\nStates.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: I came to the United States in May of 1937.",
        "Q: When you came over here, did you decide to pursue your athletic career or had\nyou been completely soured?",
        "A: When I came over here um the first thing I had to do was make some money\nbecause the Germans allowed each emigrant to take along 4 dollars and a camera\nwhich everybody sold and lived on until they found a job and I had the same\nthing. And the first thing I had to do 1s find a job. But somehow a letter, a, an\narticle appeared in the long defunct World Telegram newspaper, a New York\nnewspaper about me arriving. I don\u2019t know, I think my brother must have been\nmanaging to get this in there and talking about what had happened to me and one\nday a coach showed up at my home and said listen I have a track and field team\nand would you like to compete for me and I said you bet and that was it and he\nwasn\u2019t a very good coach, it was an undertaker. And I kept teasing him that I\nthought the bodies that he prepared for wherever these bodies were going, were in\nbetter shape than the bodies he prepared to compete at the track meets. But he\ntried hard and I competed here several events and did OK.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t turned off by sports...",
        "A: No, I, I really wanted to get back into it and I was right away very successful so\nthat, that kept me going I suppose. The first year I was here I won the American\nchampionship in high jumping. I won the American championship in shot put,\nweighing all of 112 pounds. Beating out my competition who weighed must have\nbeen twice my size and twice my weight and that really gave me a good feeling.",
        "Q: Did you feel somewhat vindicated...",
        "A: It felt very good because I knew that somehow word had to get back to Germany\nthat I did win and that made me feel very good but I knew it wouldn\u2019t be in any\nnewspapers. Would be like word of mouth you know. And I knew that people\nwho wished me well and there were some Germans. I mean not every German\nwas a Nazi, they would be happy for me.",
        "Q: What about your family, were they able to get out of Germany?",
        "A: We were very worried about my family. My brother came here a few months\nbefore I did. And we were very worried about my family. And finally my father\nwas able to get out even though it was a miracle. They took all the, all the people\nwho they wanted to the Germans who they wanted to keep in Germany, they just\n21\n22\ntook their passports away so there was no way of for them to get out. And my\nfather had a work permit for England which was pretty hard to get but he had\ndone business with England quite a bit and he got that work permit and that was\nabout to expire so he went to the authorities and said listen can I have the, my\npassport back I need to have my work permit renewed and somebody gave him\nthis passport and my father said we are leaving so they packed a little suitcase, a\nlittle clean underwear and they all took off, my brother my mother and left the\nhouse, left everything back and went to the next town, went to the next town,\nwent to the next town. Finally ended up in Cologne where they, they took a\nplane and flew to England.",
        "Q: Were you able to communicate with them once you left Germany?",
        "A: Oh yes, we, we wrote to each other all the time but you had to be extremely\ncareful what you wrote. For instance there was the Crystal night and they took all\nthe men from I think the age of 18 to maybe 60 and took them to concentration\ncamps and we had no idea was my father taken or was, wasn\u2019t he and my mother\nwrote a letter that that Dad was quite ill and had to go away so we knew he was\ngone. And we tried everything you know congressmen and tried to get him back\nand he finally did come back after 4 weeks weighing 80 pounds. And signing\nhimself into the hospital in, in Laupheim and the next day the nuns who ran the\nhospital came to him and said you have to leave. The authorities told me we\ndon\u2019t, we can\u2019t keep Jews here. So they threw him out weighing 80 pounds and\nhe had to recuperate another way. And I still blame them apart from his smoking\ncigarettes that he died at a very sudden death of a heart attack.",
        "Q: Where was he sent?",
        "A: Dachau. That\u2019s near Munich. And they took all their, their clothing away, they\ndressed them in these clothes, you know like you see in old movies with the\nstripes, the cotton, the cotton suits and they had to stand outside from 5:00 in the\nmorning un, it was November until 11:00 at night. No, no warm underwear, no\nwarm, nothing and I mean this is what they, what they did.",
        "Q: This is in 38, 39?",
        "A: I think it was in 39. I know the Crystal night. I can\u2019t remember was it I think it\nwas 38 yeah.",
        "Q: ... your father had to go away, what was going through your mind?",
        "A: Well we just, we just tried to get him out of there you know, we wrote to\neverybody that we could think of to try to get him out and whether, it was, that we\nwere successful or whether they were just saying well let\u2019s get those old guys out\nof here. You know after 4 weeks or 5 weeks he came home. And my husband\u2019s\nbrother and future brother \u2014 in \u2014 law, they were also in Dachau and the Germans\n22\n23\ntold them if you can go someplace, leave Germany today, you can leave. So they\nChina was the only place that would take you without any red tape so they bought\nsteamship tickets to, to China and they went to China.",
        "Q: ...did they give him a reason why they were taking him?",
        "A: No, that was just a you know it was a fun thing to do I suppose for the Nazis.\n(Change tape)\n(Tape 4 of 4)",
        "Q: What kind of team did Germany present in the high jump...",
        "A: In the high jump, usually there are always three competitors for each event, three\nin the dash, and three in the shot put and three in the long jump and they only had\ntwo girls in the high jump. And that was a little bit unusual and a long, a long\ntime later I found out that the team was told that Bergman is injured and cannot\ncompete. But I also had the suspicion that they were trying to maneuver this\nwhole thing because a letter was sent around that those who were in Olympic\ncandidates should not expect to be chosen in some of them and that they did not\nmeasure up and that only in some events there would only be 2 competitors and I\nthink that was really done for my sake already. Because they were already trying\nto get rid of me somehow, maybe, I\u2019m not sure but it, it seemed to be very\nunusual that there would only be two girls in the high jump.",
        "Q: When did you get this letter?",
        "A: I think they came, the letter came in the, in the winter before the Olympics, [Il\nhave to check the date.",
        "Q: What role if any do you think the 1936 played in bolstering the Nazis for what\nwas to come?\nA; Adolph Hitler tried to use these Olympics as his propaganda vehicle to show the\nworld how powerful he was, to show the world how unified a Germany was and I\nthink he tried to scare the world into not standing up against him somehow. I\nthink that\u2019s, that\u2019s the way I, I have to look at it. The Olympics were a great, a\ngreat success for Germany at the time. And they built this beautiful stadium. I\nmean people found work due, due to the Olympics, or help the Nazis to, to\nsucceed.",
        "Q: So you think he did gain from",
        "A: I he definitely did gain from it and I, I\u2019ve seen it written in a book someplace\nabout how the Olympics are supposed to bring the youth of the world together and\n23\n24\nthat somebody made the remark that in 1936, the youth of the world came\ntogether in these Olympics and four years later they were, they were coming\ntogether against each other in a battle field. You know then the war started in\n1940.",
        "Q: ...did you lose friends or family members?",
        "A: Unfortunately my husband\u2019s parents and many of his relatives were not able to\nget out and we really tried so hard and we had to battle people here to help and\nthere was so little help to be had. My husband has very rich relatives, they had a\njewelry store in, in New York and they\u2019re very rich and I approached them for\npapers for him and they refused and I made out his papers for him. I mean I got\nhim out like it was really not quite honest to get him here. But they, we didn\u2019t\neven think about approaching them for his parents because we knew they\nwouldn\u2019t do it. And we tried, we tried to get them into Cuba and you know the,\nthe people would buy visas for Cuba for $400 and we got 2 visas for them and\njust when their turn was about to come, these visas were found out to be phony\nand that avenue was shut off so and they were all so a little bit reluctant. My\nfather -in -law never could understand that this could happen to him. He said I\u2019ve\nbeen living in this town forever, we were friends with everybody. They can\u2019t do\nanything to us or nothing 1s going to happen to us. And then when he did realized\nthat he should have done something, it was too late. There were many, I, I don\u2019t\nremember how many relatives, I think it at least 15 or 30, I don\u2019t remember how\nmany and in my family too. Some and friends.",
        "Q: ... getting out?",
        "A: Right, it was, it was. The American people a lot of them did not kill themselves,\nyou know. They made all the big speeches how, how helpful they wanted to be,\nlike my sponsor when it came down to it, he wasn\u2019t too anxious so my brother\nwho there, the father of the motion picture industry by the name of Carl Laemlle,\nI mean he\u2019s a very famous man, he came into the United States from Laupheim.\nAnd he made out 300 affidavits. Anybody who approached him for papers, he\nmade them out. And he wasn\u2019t sure whether these people weren\u2019t going to sit on\nhis pocket eventually you know but he was wonderful but I think the American\npeople in general were not very generous in that respect.",
        "Q: ...think about 1936, what impact on your life, these experiences?",
        "A: I think it made me a lot tougher, you know to face what, what I had to face and\nlife here was very, very hard in the beginning, I worked as a housemaid for $10 a\nweek and even though life was a lot cheaper then, you couldn\u2019t get very far on\n$10 a week. And my husband worked as a house painter, being a physician he\nworked as a house painter when he, when he arrived over here. It made us, I think\ntougher you know but what we went through and it might have helped us even\nthough it was pretty tough school to go through.\n24\n25",
        "Q: Anything else you want to add?",
        "A: Well one thing I, I should mention maybe. I recently got a letter from the\nNational, German National Olympic committee and they invited me to be their\nguest of honor at the Atlanta Olympic games from July the 19\" until August the\n3\" And although I have never gone back to Germany and they invited me before\nfor some other occasion, I have accepted the invitation and I think it will be a very\nemotional thing for me but I, I think I said to my husband what goes around\ncomes around and I think P\u2019ve got to make my peace with this thing at least even\nthough it, it\u2019s it gnawed on me all these years you know and every time the\nOlympics come around, I I get mad as hell again, I say why, why did this happen\ntome. And but I\u2019ve got to make peace before I go wherever I\u2019m going to go, up\nor down, I don\u2019t know. So I\u2019m looking forward to that and I think it was a very\ngesture. They have tried to and the town where I come from also they have tried\nvery hard to make amends. They take care of the Jewish cemetery. Not a single\nJew went back to that town. But the, the citizens of the town take care of the\ncemetery and they have Jewish artists come. They have ,they have all kinds of\nactivities to not to let the Jewish life that once was there die. And I think that is\nthat helped me too because even though I would have, I never, never thought of\ngoing back. I was invited 3 times from the town to go and some people went and\nthey had a very good time. I said no, I will never set foot on German soil again.\nAnd I won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know how long [\u2019ll last but Pll never go back. But I did\naccept that invitation and I\u2019m looking forward to it.",
        "Q: One last question...boycott or whatever that it would have made any difference in\nterms of what followed the Olympics?",
        "A: Any boycott that would have happened would have influenced only the Olympic\ngames that it would not have been the huge success that Hitler expected from it\nbut Hitler and Nazis they would have gone on no matter what, even if only one\nother country would have shown up to, to participate in the Olympics. I don\u2019t\nthink it had anything to do with what he wanted to accomplish. He wanted to\nconquer the world and he, he, he would have gone forward no matter what. And I\ndon\u2019t think that the Olympics in that respect had anything to do with it.",
        "Q: ...feelings about Jewish athletes in other countries who did participate...",
        "A: Well there are two trends of thoughts. They could have stayed home or they\ncould have come and showed what a Jew could do. As a matter of fact, I think\nhigh jump was won by a Czech, a Jewish girl and I think that was like spitting in\nHitler\u2019s eye, see a Jews, they can do it. And I think there were some that didn\u2019t\ncome and that was their, whatever they wanted to decide about their lives. But I\nthink they only hurt themselves and they, it didn\u2019t make any, it didn\u2019t make an\nimpact. You know I think it had more, more impact for the Jews to go there and,\nand beat the Germans than, than to stay home and say I\u2019m not going. I have that\n25\n26\nmuch respect for myself that I won\u2019t go. I don\u2019t think that that, was, the ones that\ndid it I respect them for it but the ones who didn\u2019t they have my respect too\nbecause they did what I would have done, beat the Nazis.\n(End)\n26\n"

My brother died unfortunately very suddenly\nabout 20 years ago on a pleasure trip and my younger brother I\u2019m in touch with\nand we have a good, very good relationship.",
        "A: There was no organized religion in my house. We ate everything, we did\neverything, we never went to the temple except on the high holidays and I hated it\nbecause I had to wear a hat. And my father, he used to say to us, be a decent\n1\n2\nhuman being, that should be your religion and I think we, he followed that and we\nfollowed it too. And religion never meant anything to me and especially after all\nthe things that happened later on. If I ever had any religious feelings I think I\nwould have lost it pretty fast after all the things that happened to the Jewish\npeople.\nQ; ...did you identify with being a Jew as a girl?",
        "A: Well only in the fact that I was Jewish and I had to go to temple twice a year but\nit, it didn\u2019t, it didn\u2019t make any difference because nobody cared. I was the only\ngirl in my class and I was the only Jew in my class and there was never, never an\nunpleasant and you didn\u2019t think of yourself as a Jew. You thought of yourself as\na German I think.",
        "A: No, I only once I said some neighbor boy called me a dirty Jew and I beat him up\nand I was never bothered again so that was it.",
        "A: It most certainly did. It was, it was terrible. I mean from one day to other, to the\nother there was like a wall you know one day you were a respected citizen. The\nnext day you were a, a tenth rate citizen. You were banned from all public places,\nno theatres , no restaurants, no swimming pools, you couldn\u2019t go any place and\nyou could not associate with non- Jewish people.",
        "A: When I was about 6 years old there was this little club in the town and you could\ngo as often as you wanted in the afternoon or in the evening whoever was ready\nthere, the older people helped the younger people how to do certain things and it\nwas great, you just went there. I could go there un, unescorted because it was\nclose to my house and I spent some time there and I was happy as a lark.",
        "A: Well we did gymnastics, we did running, we did whatever, whatever you know\nthere was a lot of gymnastics involved and they worked on the parallel bars which\nI hated. I hated that stuff because I wasn\u2019t good at it because my legs were too\nlong I guess. And but they instructed us the older people, and there was a terrific\nrelationship. They would take us out Sundays to go swimming and it was really\nvery nice.\n2\n3",
        "A: I just loved it.",
        "A: I loved everything that had to do with physical activity. I loved to climb. I loved\nto run. I, I just loved, loved to be outdoors, it, it was, I skied, I skated, I swam.\nNobody ever told me anything. I played tennis, I played ping-pong. Nobody ever\ntold me anything. It was just, I was a natural athlete and whatever I started to do,\nI did well without being instructed in anything so, it was the, I liked it better than\nmathematics let me tell you.",
        "A: And I was good at it, without working very hard at it.",
        "A: Well once I got to be in the age where I got to be noticing boys it became a very\nimportant thing in my life because that was the social life then, you know you\nwent to the gym and uh the boy you had your eye on walked you home and that\nwas a big deal and that was very good.",
        "A: Yes, I think there was hardly the smallest little village that didn\u2019t have some kind\nof sports going. If it was just a soccer club, club. You know they play soccer\nand, and team sports more but there were very few places where there was\nnothing going on and that was a very important thing and once I got a little older,\nmaybe 14 or so, we used to go to other little towns and compete there and that\nwas really like a lot of fun and you met a lot of new people and, and it was, it was\ngreat.\n(Technical interruption)\n3\n4",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe so at that time. That came much later really. But when I was quite\nsmall, maybe 10, 12 years old, I had made up my mind, I will be a physical\neducation teacher or a coach. And I knew exactly where to go in Berlin and study\nthere and it didn\u2019t work out that way because by the time I was ready for it, I\nwasn\u2019t accepted anymore but uh I always wanted to be in sports.",
        "A: No, just teaching and coaching and you know later on once I got too old to do it\nmyself.",
        "A: Well, I, I don\u2019t think that I really thought about the Olympics. I don\u2019t even think I\nknew much about the Olympics. You know we lived in this small hick town that\ndid have a newspaper but I think it was more important to see that the chickens\nlaid the eggs or whatever than you know all they would report the sports results of\nwhat happened in that town. But nothing really you didn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t get much\ninformation. There wasn\u2019t any television of course and the radio came much later\nso I don\u2019t think that I knew much about the Olympics until I got a lot later.",
        "A: There was no, was no television, of course, no television whatsoever. And radio\nalso came you know it wasn\u2019t there when I was very small.",
        "A: None whatsoever. I\u2019ve said this so many times that there was absolutely no\ndifference between the Jewish people and the gentile people. There were not that\nmany Jewish people doing sports, let\u2019s face it and especially not girls. But I\nnever, never felt any, any different. I mean we would go Sundays go to a nice\nswimming hole and go swimming and very often was the only Jewish person\ngoing so there was nothing. I felt perfectly comfortable.",
        "A: No. No, nobody, nobody I don\u2019t know where I got it from, I really don\u2019t. But my\nbrothers liked to watch it but they, they didn\u2019t do much by themselves, I mean my\nbrother, my oldest brother skied a little bit but nothing very, not like I. I mean I\nwas possessed I think by sports.\n4\n5",
        "A: In the spring of 1933, it was just around my birthday and it was not a very nice\nbirthday present, I got a letter from my sports club, you are no longer welcome\nhere because you\u2019re Jewish. Heil Hitler and that was the end of that. So they just\nthrew me out of the club and that was the end of my sports career as far as that\nwas concerned. There was no Jewish sports per se in the town because everything\nwas always mixed up you know. There was everybody did things together. But\nwe, we were just locked out of everything. All the Jews were thrown out of the\nsports club. All the Jews, you couldn\u2019t go to, to a restaurant. I mean Jews were\nexcluded from all German life. That started in 1933 and it was a horrible time.\nThere was one Jewish restaurant in, in, in that town and everybody congregated\nthere and everybody commiserated you know. What are we going to do, what\u2019s\ngoing to happen here. And it was a horrible life.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it was anticipated in the realm the way it happened. Um once he\nstarted, you know became chancellor...",
        "A: Once Hitler became chancellor you started to worry a little bit you know but\neverybody thought this is, this is going to blow over, he\u2019s not going to last. As a\nmatter of fact, I had been accepted at the University for physical education in\nBerlin. For the spring semester and I wrote them a letter saying that I was Jewish\nand would it be advisable for me to come just then. And they wrote me a letter\nback literally saying wait until this thing blows over so everybody thought this is\nnot going to last. But once Hitler had you know taken hold you were just afraid\nfor your life if you, if you disobeyed or whether it was a Jew or whether it was a\ngentile, you did exactly as you were told, like in a real dictatorship.",
        "A: It was a terrible, terrible time. It was, it was almost, you couldn\u2019t understand,\nwhy did this happen, why aren\u2019t those people associating with us any more. I\nmean some of the friends stayed with us you know. But only in a. a very in a way\nthey couldn\u2019t be caught to come to our house for instance. They had to come in\nthe middle of the night and sneak in the back door if they wanted to visit with us.\nBut a lot of them did change that, you know they went the other way and they\nfigured well maybe Hitler is out god from now on and we will stay with him but it\nwas, it was very bad. We didn\u2019t know what to do with ourselves, you couldn\u2019t go\nanywheres. You couldn\u2019t go into a restaurant, you couldn\u2019t go into a movie and\nespecially in a small town. In a large town I guess you could bear to go to a\nmovie every once in a while or a restaurant but not in a small town. Everybody\nknew everybody else and, and you just didn\u2019t do it and if you did it, \u2019'm sure, you\nwould be punished according to Hitler\u2019s credo, whatever.\n5\n6",
        "A: Yes, some of them. There was a girl next door to me, we grew up together as\nbabies. We were together every single day. She ate in our house more times than\nshe ate in her own house and soon as Hitler came in she didn\u2019t know me any more\nand that was it. She had the chance to sneak into the house just like anybody else,\nyou know other friends did. But she never made that attempt and maybe 2 years\nago she wrote me a letter, the first trme I ever heard from her. My dear, darling\nyou know stuff like this and I\u2019m so happy to finally find your address and the\ngood times we had together and stuff like this. And I wrote her back. I said yes it\nwas a good time but you didn\u2019t think so then because you didn\u2019t know me any\nmore. That was the end of that friendship.\n(technical adjustment)",
        "A: It is absolutely impossible for anybody who hasn\u2019t gone through this what it was\nlike to be among friends one day and the next day you would pass that same\nfriend in the street and you wouldn\u2019t even say hello to each other because you\nwere not, some you were not allowed to do it. Or some were afraid to do it but\nyou just passed your friends up, friend or walk right on. And for instance, my\nyounger brother is 12 years younger than I and he had all the kids from the\nneighborhood were his friends. They played together all non Jewish children and\nthey all played together and all of a sudden after 1933 they started to beat him up\nand on his way to school, he had to go to a Jewish school because the other\nschools would not take him and on the way to school they beat him up. And I\nwould walk him to school as often as I could. And they wouldn\u2019t beat him up\nwhen I was there but they would call him and me all kinds of horrible names and\nthey would spit at us. And I wouldn\u2019t dare to touch those children because if I\nhad touched a non Jewish child I would have been in a concentration camp the\nnext day. So we really vegetated, there was nothing to do except worrying that,\nwhat\u2019s going to happen. My brother was working for a universal pictures and\nthey had a, a studio in Berlin.",
        "A: My older brother and they closed up because they saw what was coming, and they\nclosed up and he came home because there was nothing for him to do. So he\nstarted to work in, in my father\u2019s factory. You know try to do make himself\nuseful there because there was, he couldn\u2019t find a job of course, nobody would\nemploy you. Gentile people were not allowed to, to but in Jewish stores for\ninstance. If somebody got caught doing that they would take their pictures and\nhang them up at the city hall. I mean they really meant business. You know they\nwere absolutely excluded from everything.\n6\n7",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that really. I think we were just into ourselves more or less, you\nknow everybody was worrying on their own but I don\u2019t think 1t was discussed all\nthat much until I finally decided that this was no life, you know so, in from the\nspring of 1933 then finally in the, in the fall, I said I have to get out of here, I\ncan\u2019t live like this. And I, I decided to go to England then and my parents agreed\nto it that I would go to England because it was a life of just vegetating. And\ntalking about the same thing over, what is going to happen to us. Talking the\nsame thing over and over again and not to come to any result. I mean nobody\nwould know, knew what, what was going to happen.",
        "A: Oh yes we did try to straighten out an old potato acre, that somebody had given\nus, one of our Jewish families there. And we, we ran there and I started a field\nhand ball, which is the same as football except it\u2019s like a combination of\nbasketball and, and football. And I coached them and it takes in 11 people I\nthink. I was the only girl on the team and I shot the only goal the first time we,\nwe lost 7 to 1 and I shot the only goal. But after a while everybody got tired of\nthis, you know the same people every day. It, it was horrible, that was they had\nan orchestra there, I mean there were many Jewish people who played the violin\nand, we, we played a little music but there really wasn\u2019t anything to do, so.",
        "A: For a time being, yes. Because he did a lot of business with the United States and\nEngland.",
        "A: My father did a lot of business with England and the United States and the\nGermans desperately the foreign currency to come in so they were already\npreparing for the war effort I suppose and that\u2019s why the, they left him on for a\nwhile but then after several years, he was just like a figurehead on there. And the\nNazis took over and but he couldn\u2019t leave because they took passport away so he\nwas stuck until a certain time came when he was able to, to get out.",
        "A: Yes.\n7\n8",
        "A: Um, I couldn\u2019t stand the life that we had and my brother was working in my\nfather\u2019s business but I had nothing to do you know. And my mother tried to teach\nme how to be a housewife, you know cooking and washing and ironing. That\nwasn\u2019t my deal so I decided or my parents decided I would go to England and\nfind a school comparable to the one in Berlin that didn\u2019t take me and that\u2019s where\nI went in, I think it was in October of 1933.",
        "A: I, it was OK, it was, it was a very weird time too. I mean I was very friendly with\nthe girls in school. I couldn\u2019t find a school that I wanted to go to, a physical\neducation so I went to school to learn English. I figured you know better than\nnothing and it was OK. They had a, a track program that they immediately took\nme into it and I competed for them and won everything in sight, whatever I did.\nYou know whether it was running or jumping or discus or whatever it was. And in\nthe school I was a big shot. However um what was very odd. I was very friendly\nwith the girls in you know some of the girls. I was never once invited to\nanybody\u2019s house. Now why I do not know. Maybe I was considered German.\nMaybe they, I was somehow discriminated against even though I tried to get away\nfrom discrimination when I went to England but somehow I was discriminated\nagainst. I mean when foreigners came to, to Laupheim, we made these people\ncomfortable and they were our friends, that they came to our house. Not in\nEngland, not once in 9 months, 10 months, 11 months was I allowed to, was I\ninvited into anybody\u2019s house. That really hurt.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure there were but then again I didn\u2019t pay much attention to it you know. I\ndid not seek out other Jews to be my friends. I was just friendly with all the kids.",
        "A: Yes and it was heaven, it was heaven. It wasn\u2019t much of a program they had in\nschool but it was nice to be back to you know they only did it, no they did it\noutdoors too. And then in, in June of 1934, I competed in the British\nchampionships and I won and that was a really big deal because then already I felt\nlike it was so satisfying to me to win this, you know and I was sure this would be\nknown in Germany and it was like a revenge kind of thing you know. There you\nsee, Iam a Jew but I have won the British championship so I was really very, very\nhappy about that.",
        "A: High jumping, that was my, my big event, high jumping, thanks to my long legs\nand my big feet, I suppose. I had great success in it and it was very interesting.\nMy English was atrocious of course, yeah. And the other girls didn\u2019t bother much\n8\n9\nwith me because I was an outsider so it was kind of lonely but it didn\u2019t matter. I\nwon and that was my father came over.\n(End tape)",
        "A: We made our own alternative outlets. We tried of course I was being in the torn in\nthe direction of sports, as I said before, we played music and we tried to entertain\nourselves as well as we could. But sports for me of course was the, the thing I\nwanted the most. So a farmer let us have an old potato field and we tried to make\nit smooth, you know it\u2019s very rough, you know big clumps on there and we tried\nto, to smooth it out and we started our own Jewish hand ball team on there, hand\nball is a game like soccer except that you don\u2019t kick the ball. You dribble it like a\nbasketball and you pass it you know throwing it and it\u2019s a great game. And I\ncoached all the fellows on the team and I was the only girl on the team and I shot\nthe only goal in the first time when we lost 7 to 1. And we also tried to straighten\nout, next to the Jewish school there was a, a yard and we tried to straighten that\nout to do calisthenics on it. Because the soccer field was a, the handball field was\na little bit out of the way so we tried to straighten that out but we had to fight the\nteachers\u2019 chickens and they used that same place for their activities and it was not\nvery appetizing so we gave up on that pretty fast.\n(Technical adjustment)",
        "A: There were Jewish sporting clubs. Maccabee they called it, but it was a Zionistic\noutfit and it was like the National League and the American League in baseball.\nThey didn\u2019t get along with, with the other Jewish athletes so they, they called\nthem the RFJ was people who fought in the first world war, they, they were the\nveterans they started this club for athletics and they were able in some towns to\nrent or even buy I don\u2019t know stadiums where Jews could, could practice on but\nthe facilities were pretty poor, pretty terrible but as I said we tried to do as much\nas we could to entertain ourselves and there was no, no coach capable of, you\nknow anybody who was a little bit more of advanced like I was to tell me what,\nhow to do it and what to do and it was just a very, very bad time.",
        "A: I think they were mostly formed after the, as I said the Maccabee, they were\nformed before already but the uh, veterans of foreign wars I think they called\nthemselves, that, that came afterwards. You know in all the towns almost\nespecially in the bigger towns, they, they start a movement so Jews would have a\nplace to go to and and, and do sports.\n9\n10",
        "A: Poor, mostly pretty poor, you know I think they only let you, the Germans would\nnot give you anything very good. They let you have the, the garbage places, you\nknow that nobody else wanted most likely, that\u2019s what they gave the Jewish\npeople.",
        "A: Oh yes. Oh yes. I mean it was, it was very bad to, to really achieve something\nspectacular because it was just, it\u2019s 1t was a poor condition and no coaching. That\nwas, that was, that was bad too.",
        "A: Well the day I won the British championship, as I said that was a fabulous day for\nme.",
        "A: OK. The day I won the British Championship was a fabulous day for me because\nI felt such pride in myself that I was able to do that because the Germans had told\nme I\u2019m inferior, I\u2019m no good, you know. And all of a sudden here I am the\nBritish champion, champion. And I was hoping that somehow word would go\nback to Germany so they would find out that I did this. And my father had come\nover to watch me, I thought. I thought he, that was the reason for his trip, trip to\nwatch me compete but on the way back from the stadium, we found out\ndifferently. My, he didn\u2019t tell me right away. He waited until we got back to his\nhotel. But on the way back there, there were newspapers being hawked in the\nstreet and everything seemed like to be big excitement. We asked the taxi driver\nwhat\u2019s going on. And he said has something to do with the Nazis killing each\nother off. So we stopped the taxi and we got out, got the newspaper and it told the\nstory about Hitler having killed off his best friend, plus about a thousand of his\nNazi people because they, they complained about something and he wanted to\nshow you. You just didn\u2019t do that. You did as you were told and when we\nthought that this might have been the beginning of the end for Hitler we couldn\u2019t\nhave been more wrong because Hitler by killing off these people let everybody\nknow if you want to stay alive, don\u2019t be a hero. So we got to the hotel (clears\nthroat) excuse me. And there my father finally told me that I had to go back to\nGermany and the reason he could not write to me or tell me on the telephone was\nbecause there was this strict censorship of everything coming into Germany or\ngoing out of Germany. And he couldn\u2019t have dared to tell me that unless I came\nback the family was being threatened you know. Tell her to come back or else.\nSo of course I decided immediately to go home, especially in view of what\nhappened to Hitler\u2019s pals. If he can kill of his own people, what is he going to, to\n10\n11\na Jew who says no. And I went back, I think within a week I was back in\nGermany which was very, very hard to accept. I was supposed to be a member of\nthe German Olympic team and that was something I couldn\u2019t understand and\ndidn\u2019t understand for a very long time. I think I didn\u2019t understand it until I came\nover here and saw all the newspaper articles that had been written about my\ninvolvement with this time. The only reason I was supposed to be on that\nOlympic team was because the Americans, and the English and the French and a\nlot of the other nations threatened not to come to the 1936 Olympics due to the\ndiscrimination of the Jews. And Hitler wanted to make this the best Olympics\never. He used it as a propaganda vehicle, and he wanted of course the United\nStates and all the big nations to be there. And this was the, the ruse that they\nused. I was the pigeon to help him get the 1936 Olympics settled and in Berlin.\nThey were already making, building and change, you know making a stadium and\neverything but they were really afraid that the, that 1t would not be a good\nOlympics for them because the big nations weren\u2019t going to show up and that\nwould take away from the, from the, from the games of course. So that\u2019s how I\ngot on the German Olympic team and it was tough.",
        "A: Well that was, it was very peculiar. My father told me at the time, the way he had\nto come to England to tell me a person. Somebody showed up at our house in\nLaupheim to tell him that he also could not write to my father that the family\nwould be in, in danger if I didn\u2019t come back. So if this man traveled to Laupheim,\ntold my father, my father traveled to England, told me and that was alike a relay\nrace you know. Avoiding danger.",
        "A: No but I knew that I would be the only Jew because there were nobody else. I\nmean it sounds kind of conceited but there really wasn\u2019t another 100% Jewish\nathlete who could have competed in the Olympics. And you know having a\nchance to win a medal. They just weren\u2019t, weren\u2019t good enough. I mean that\u2019s,\nthat\u2019s, that\u2019s the way it was.",
        "A: In Germany. And I didn\u2019t know that I was going, at first that I was going to be\nthe only one. And in Germany nobody knew anything about this. This was\nstrictly nothing was in the papers about this. That they were, that the Olympics\nweren\u2019t such good shape. No they only heard the Olympics is going to be the best\nthing you ever experienced in Germany and all this stuff and there was nothing in\nthe papers that there was a danger that it wouldn\u2019t be, that it would be a flop.\n11\n12",
        "A: Um I think that the Jewish community, they were very proud of me. I mean after\na while word spread around that this Jewish girl who might be competing in the\nOlympics and of course I was like the bright Jewish hope you know that the, the\ngreat white hope and this boxer whoever he was, I was the great Jewish hope and\nI mean people were proud of me and the they wished me the best and it was a\nterrible time for me because they would, I would be asked all these ridiculous\nquestions. Are you going to be competing in the Olympics, and aren\u2019t. What are\nyou going to do and how are you going to, to conduct yourself. I said I don\u2019t\nknow. I mean how do I know what\u2019s going to happen. I'll just have to play it by\near and that\u2019s exactly what I did.",
        "A: Well maybe I was hoping for it in a way and maybe I was hoping for it.",
        "A: Oh yes, Iam sorry. In a way I was hoping I would be in the Olympics because to\ncompete in the Olympics 1s the thrill of a lifetime. I mean it and it doesn\u2019t happen\nto everybody, you know you have to be good enough to do it. On the other hand I\nwas so afraid. Supposing I am allowed to compete, supposing I win and I was\nconvinced that I would win a medal and possibly the gold. Supposing I do this,\nwhat, what do I do. I\u2019m going to stand on that podium and, and say Heil Hitler\nlike all the others, I mean that, that was the accepted way to, to say well I won,\nyou know you had to stand up there and say Heil Hitler. I was scared stiff and\nthis was going around in my head day and night, day and night, day and night.\nHow I'll, what\u2019s going to happen, am I going to compete, am I not going to\ncompete? How do I (clears throat) conduct myself if I do compete. It was a\nterrible.",
        "A: Oh yes. I was so, so torn up about it, I didn\u2019t know what to do and it was not only\nthat but I mean I met with the other girls, you know not Jewish competition or so.\nI was always afraid how are they going to react to me and at the Olympic training\ncourses that I was ordered to attend, they, they couldn\u2019t have been any nicer. All\nthe girls accepted me fully. No anti\u2014 Semitism. Nothing I mean I was just an\nathlete like all the other athletes and I wrote many, many years later, I mean after\n1980 I wrote to one of them. I said I can\u2019t understand why you were so nice to\nme. Did you really know I was Jewish. And she wrote back to me, sure we knew\nyou were Jewish but you were an, a good athlete like we were good athletes and\nthat was all that counted to us and politics didn\u2019t mean anything to us, she said in\nthe letter. But I\u2019m sure that she as well as many of the other girls were members\nof the Nazi party. I mean there is this conflict again. You know they\u2019re Nazis\n12\n13\nand still they, they accept me the Jewish girl, doesn\u2019t make any sense, it didn\u2019t\nmake any sense.\n(Water break)",
        "A: When I got back to Germany I was hoping I would at least have a place where I\ncould train. But the fact that I was a member of the German Olympic team did\nnot allow me to use any of the stadiums. I was still a Jew and was not allowed to\nuse any of this. So I had to use the poor facilities of the Jewish clubs and compete\nthere for them. And that was, was absolutely terrible because first of all there was\nno competition whatsoever. If you don\u2019t have any competition it\u2019s, you have to\nonly fight yourself and that\u2019s much harder than somebody you know if there\u2019s\nstiff competition you try to outdo each other. But when there\u2019s no competition\nit\u2019s very hard so I always had to fight myself and it was really very, very tough.\nAnd then of course all those stupid questions I have to answer. You know\neverybody asked me are you going to be in the Olympics. You know what are\nyou going to do. I was a nervous wreck I think and day and night, things were on\nmy mind. It was really horrible. And my parents and I we didn\u2019t discuss it\nbecause I knew they were worried about it and they knew I was worried about it\nso we didn\u2019t talk about it. Because we, we didn\u2019t want to hurt each other\u2019s\nfeelings I suppose so it, it was very, very hard.",
        "A: I was ordered three times, four times in those two years to go to an Olympic\ntraining course and that\u2019s the only solid training I had for the Olympics and as I\nsaid before, I think I said it before that I was a natural athlete and if I hadn\u2019t been\na, a natural athlete I don\u2019t think I would have achieved what I did because there\njust wasn\u2019t any, any opportunity for me, for me to, to get better or to advance or to\nknow what I was doing, it just happened naturally.",
        "A: There were very few Jewish athletes who really were capable to compete on a\nnational level. I mean there were, the best Jewish athletes let\u2019s say, but they\nweren\u2019t the best German athletes. And they really, really couldn\u2019t compare, they\nwere very, very few and there were some for instance in the Olympics, there was\na fencer Helena Myer, she was half Jewish, they let her compete, I guess half\nJewish was only half as offensive as being all Jewish. And there were some half\nJewish athletes that competed--one in, 1n ice hockey so he, he melted into the, you\nknow into the team so he wouldn\u2019t stick out like I would have stuck out. But I\ndon\u2019t think there were any Jewish athletes really that were capable of be,\ncompeting on, on a national level.\n13\n14",
        "A: No, the, the Germans did another number. They you know every time there were\nsome newspaper articles written that they\u2019re not holding up their end of our, that\nthey finally signed a commitment that they would not discriminate against Jewish\nathletes. They, they wrote it down and but there were all these newspaper articles\nthat they were not living up to their commitment, that they wouldn\u2019t let me\ncompete in the German national championship. And they said well she was not\nentitled to compete in that because she was not a member of the German track and\nfield association. And why wasn\u2019t I member, because I was Jewish. And so you\nknow it was like a dog chasing it\u2019s tail. And so it, they had, they had all kinds of,\nof, of ways to talk themselves out of it. They for instance, in 1935 for instance\nthey got a little scared again so they called all the best Jewish athletes for a\ntraining course, an Olympic training course. I said 1n an article once, I think\nSnow White and the seven dwarfs would have done just as well as those athletes\nbecause they weren\u2019t any good. I happened to meet my husband there, that was\nthe best part about this training course, really. But they really weren\u2019t good\nenough but it was just a sham by, by the Germans to show well we, we\u2019re trying\nto find new talent for the Olympics in the Jewish community but it, that was all\nbaloney.",
        "A: Well there was a very good coach there and but I think what he told me I knew\nalready, you know by then this is 1935 already and the Olympics were the\nfollowing year and I did very well all along and in the training courses I always\noutdid the, my the other you know 1n, in not the Jewish one but in the other one. I\nalways did better than, than the other, than the German girls and whenever I\ncompeted which only happened three times I think in the, in the 2 years, I always\nbeat them. Even though I only once did I have good competition, girls that were\nalso going into the Olympics. The other times I think I jumped about 15 inches\nhigher than the next best and you know there was no, I had no competition in that\nrespect and in the Jewish competitions also. But the, the Germans always kept an\neye out. Whenever I was competing someplace, there was always somebody\nwatching out, for the, for the Nazis to make sure if I did poorly, they would have\nkicked me off the team immediately I\u2019m sure.",
        "A: The coaches treated me very well, I mean they saw and listen not everybody was\na, was a Nazi you know. And that they treated me very well and they liked me it\nseems but the officials whenever I had to compete at the, at, they were, they were\nhostile, I think they were hostile towards me. At one time I saw this fellow who\nwas a member of my former club. I knew him as well as I know myself. He\nlooked through me like I didn\u2019t exist. He didn\u2019t say hello. He didn\u2019t, you know I\n14\n15\nwas just not, non \u2014 existent. And at that competition they tried, I mean the\nofficials are supposed to be neutral. They tried to teach the other girls how to you\nknow, how they could beat me. They didn\u2019t do that, of course, they couldn\u2019t\nbecause they weren\u2019t good enough.",
        "A: Yes, but it, it made me better because I was so full of rage, the madder I got, the\nbetter I jumped and the Germans didn\u2019t know that of course, otherwise they might\nhave treated me a little better. But I was so, so absolutely enraged about\neverything, you know, the whole, the whole thing these whole two years that I,\nthe madder I got, the better I did. And that was, that was wonderful.",
        "A: Rage was my fuel. You know fueled my energies. And my motivator. It was, it\nwas, it was, it was really weird.",
        "A: Unh hunh.",
        "A: Well for instance the um German track and field championships, they were\nsupposed to be one of the events that would show who was going to be taken into\nconsideration for the Olympics but they wouldn\u2019t let me compete because it\u2019s, I\nwas not a member of the German track and field association so I couldn\u2019t\ncompete, but they, they, they at one time I, I had to compete in Munich which was\nthe scariest thing because Munich was the hot bed of, of Nazism. That was where\nHitler lived there and I was scared stiff to go there and I didn\u2019t do that well and it\nwas noted, duly noted by the Nazis that I only jumped a, a meter 53 instead of\nbetter but I beat still, beat the competition by about 15 inches. But I didn\u2019t do as\nwell because I think I was mentally a wreck at the time.",
        "A: The gentile com, the gentile girls who were supposed to go into the Olympics\nthey had their own meets which I was not, not admitted and I think the whole deal\nwas just if I did fairly well they would not throw me out because they were still\nafraid that the boycott would happen so I think no matter what I did, I was pretty\nsafe at that point, even the, you know in Munich when I did not do too well, they\ncouldn\u2019t, they couldn\u2019t afford to throw me out at that point because they were still\nafraid the Americans wouldn\u2019t show up.\n15\n16",
        "A: Yes, I think so. I think that I was going, be safe then until further notice and I\ndidn\u2019t know was I going to be, wasn\u2019t I going to be, what was I going to do. It\nwas a terrible time.\n(Tape change)",
        "A: When I came back from England I went to Stuttgart a couple of times during the\nmonth, because there the Jewish club had a stadium and they had invited me to\ncome and use that stadium so I happened to learn about a school, a not a Jewish\nschool it was a gentile owned school that for physical education, it was a private\nschool, not a university. And I thought Ill, I'll apply and see if they take me,\nfine. If they don\u2019t take me fine too and they did take me because they might have\ngot, they, they had to get permission from the government that they could accept a\nJew and I suppose that it was all in view of my being an Olympic candidate and\nhad they not let me go into that school, it might have come out into the other\ncountries and there might have been more, more problems for, for, for the\nOlympics for Germany. So they accepted me and it, I had a good time there, we\nwere all very friendly, the girls were all very friendly there and it was a big town\nand I could go in the afternoon after they were finished practicing we would go\ninto this caf\u00e9 and make pigs out of ourselves, eating whipped cream cake and\neverything and we had a terrific time there. And we were very friendly and it was\nnice. The only thing they would, they would prevent me, they, the curriculum had\nin it German gymnastics and they wouldn\u2019t let me take part in the German\ngymnastics, now why I don\u2019t know. Because the Jew and the German gymnastics\nthat was too, too much of a paradox I don\u2019t know. But the other girls, we just\nlaughed about it. We thought it was funny and by then I was so used to being\nexcluded that it wasn\u2019t such a big deal.",
        "A: Yes, it was good, it was good, it was, you know, the big time, in s big town you\ncould do more things, you could go to the movies and we did do a foolish thing\none time with these, with these girls. There were some, we were having a lot of\ngood times and laughing and carrying on and about six of us and there was a table\nfull of SS uni, uniformed SS men at the next table and they kept looking at us and\nlooking at us. Finally they came over and they tried to make dates with us. And\nthere\u2019s this big German blond guy trying to make a date with me and I said no and\nI said no. And the more he tried to make a date with me the more the other girls\nlaughed and we got hysterical. And it was, it was funny and it was stupid at the\nsame time cause had I been found out, I don\u2019t know what would ha, what would\nhave happened to me. But we were young and you didn\u2019t really you know think\nof any consequences that much.\n16\n17",
        "A: I didn\u2019t really see these signs until, these anti \u2014 Semitic signs. I mean I knew I\nwas excluded from all public places but I don\u2019t think I saw ever any signs because\nI just didn\u2019t pay any attention to it, I suppose. I only noticed those in 1937 but I\nknow that Brundage the, the head of the American Olympic committee went over\nto Germany to see what was going on because here was so much resistance in\nAmerica against taking part in the Olympics so he went over there and I read later\non doing some research that Berlin was manicured terrifically, everything was\nclean, every, all the offending signs, dogs and Jews not allowed etcetera, etcetera,\nthey were all gone and Mr. Brundage was not a champion for Jewish causes as I\nhave heard, never spoke to any Jewish people, he just let himself be lulled into\nsome false sense of security by these Nazis saying everything is fine, we\u2019re doing\neverything we said we would do and he came back to the United States and said\neverything is fabulous over there and we\u2019ll be going.",
        "A: Not at that time.",
        "A: Yes, I was not, I was not aware of it at all.",
        "A: Yes, after, after the...",
        "A: The school was very nice because I was able to do as much as I wanted to in\nsports. I, you know my, my body was reacting at the first, first few weeks I was a\ncomplete wreck because my body wasn\u2019t used to this kind of being used so much\nbut after a while I got you know my muscles got supple, supple again and it was,\nit was great to be back into every day, being into sports. We had, we had\ngymnastics, we had track and field. We played you know team sports. It was, it\nwas very nice and the first day I was scared stiff because I didn\u2019t know how the\ngirls would react to me and they greeted me, what\u2019s your name. My name 1s\nBergman. OK you\u2019re Bergie from now on and, and, and we were all the best of\nfriends, it was really very nice.",
        "A: No. I, I mean the, the track and field was not bad but it wasn\u2019t in, in very good\nshape either and the, the male teacher there if he could beat me in high jumping\n17\n18\nwhich was really my specialty, he was so proud of himself and I mean as a man\nhe should have been doing much better than I did. But if he just beat me by an\ninch he was very happy.",
        "A: There must have been quite some protest again in the, in the Unites States. I\nknow that a Senator or Congressman Sellar that he was pleading in the congress\nnot to send a team over. There were, there were protest meets in Madison Square\nGarden, 20,000 people showed up. There was a lot of resistance and this must\nhave been the reason why they invited me to come to Stuttgart and, and that as in\n19, 1936 to, to compete at a meet there and it was really rough. You know when\nyou the only Jew you know people, if the spectators knew that I was Jewish they\ndidn\u2019t wish me well. I knew that much. And the, the officials were hostile. I\nthink I mentioned that before. And it was very hard to, to compete against\nmyself. So but I was so mad that I equaled the German record. The German\nrecord then was five foot three and I equaled that. I must have cleared it by, by 15\ninches at the time. I was so angry. And usually you have three tries for each\nheight you know you start at 4, 6 let\u2019s say. You have, if you do it the first time,\nfine. But you have to go over it by the third try otherwise you\u2019re eliminated.\nWell all the other girls were out by if they did about 4, 8 and they were all out and\nI kept going and going on and going. And every height I jumped over it on the\nfirst trme. So I did the 5, 3 and I think the, the officials most likely would have\nliked to poison but they didn\u2019t. And I was just so elated. I thought this is the first\nthing that ever happened to me, you know those lousy Nazis. And after that I\nwent home I think and I wanted to share this with my family and I think this was\nthe last time that I, I stayed in Stuttgart. I, I went home then and I said now this 1s\n4 weeks before the Olympics start. I better go home and see what happens. So I\nwent home and my parents were happy and my brothers were happy that I did this\nand I look for the mail everyday, what\u2019s going to happen, you know. What, what\nexcuses are they going to use, that as only one, one other German girl who, who\nwas capable of doing this right and how are they going to, if they don\u2019t want me\nin there how are they going to get rid of me. And I was really scared, aren\u2019t they\ngoing to break my leg or what are they going to do to, to eliminate me. But it was\nvery simple. One day a letter came and it said in view of the fact that you have\nbeen doing very poorly lately we did not select you for the Olympic team. Heil\nHitler and that was the end of it. And I said, I remember me sitting outside on the\nstoop and I got this letter and I must have used every profanity I knew and I knew\na lot of them and at the same time, I had such an incredible feeling of relief. It\u2019s\nall over now, now I know what\u2019s going to happen to me. It was just like, like the\nbiggest load was lifted off my shoulders and I know that was such a, a paradox.\nThat I was angry, very very angry at the same time so relieved. And I don\u2019t\nremember a thing about the Olympics.\n18\n19",
        "A: Well all this time I was worried how, first of all am I going to compete, am I not\ngoing to compete, how are they going to eliminate me or what am I going to do if\nI do compete and I do win a medal and I know the German way to, to\nacknowledge a victory you stand up on the, on the podium and Heil Hitler. And I\ndidn\u2019t see that happening for me too easily. That would, I mean how can you\nexpect a German girl to stand there and, and raise her arm in the Hitler salute.",
        "A: A Jewish girl and this was on my mind for 2 years. And all of a sudden I didn\u2019t\nhave to worry about it any more. And there was a, a terrific relief.",
        "A: Had I won the Olympics or had I been allowed to compete in the Olympics I\nwould have been a loser either way. Cause had I won there would have been such\na, an insult against the German psyche. How can the, a Jew be good enough to\nwin the Olympics. Then I would have had to be afraid for my life, \u2019m sure. And\nhad I lost I would have been made as a joke. See we knew that you couldn\u2019t have,\ncouldn\u2019t do this and that, that was on my mind all these years.\nA; (chuckles) excuse me.",
        "A: I think that was the first time I really realized that my candidacy for an Olympic\nathlete was really all a sham, I wish, it was just something that the Germans did\nto, to fool the whole group. Maybe that\u2019s when I realized that I really don\u2019t even\nknow. I have, I think I have complete amnesia what happened to me after this. I\ncannot remember whether I watched the Olympics. I mean watch, you couldn\u2019t\nwatch there was not television but I listened to the Olympics. I followed the\nOlympics in the newspaper. I have no idea, I cannot, I have complete amnesia\nabout it.",
        "A: I knew where I was. Except I did not want to think about the Olympics. As a\nmatter of fact I, you know people all is for the best and my parents looked at me\nfeeling sorry for me and my brothers looked at me feeling sorry for me and 1s she\ngoing to freak out or what\u2019s going to happen to her. I said Ill have to get away\nfrom here. And I went to a spa under an assumed name of course, you couldn\u2019t\nyou know afford to nobody would take me if they knew I was Jewish. And I sat\n19\n20\nthere for two weeks. Not talking to anybody. I didn\u2019t want to be bothered with\nanybody. And I was just thinking about all this and what was going to happen\nand what did happen and that\u2019s when I realized I have to get out of Germany.\nThat\u2019s and I just made up my mind I\u2019m going to have to leave.",
        "A: I have completely, I to this day I can\u2019t remember what I did. Whether I knew\nwho did what or I notice this one person that I I knew that later on she came in\nthird a girl I was very friendly with. She came in third in the high jumping, a\nGerman girl and but whether I realized it at the time I do not know, I cannot\nremember.",
        "A: I think that I only realized what was really going on once I came over to the\nStates. Friends of ours had saved all the newspaper articles where my name\u2019s up\nhere do you know with all the ups and downs and whether the Germans said and\nwhat the Americans said and what, what was going on and all their promises and\nall the, their excuses. The German excuses and I think that\u2019s the first time I really\nrealized how I was used as a political football.",
        "A: The high jump in the Olympics was won with the height of 5 foot, 3, the height I\nhad reached four weeks earlier and I had the best chance to win a medal. I could\nhave had the gold medal because (laughs) when I got mad, I did better, so I would\nhave been mighty mad seeing all those people out there with their uniforms on, all\nthe swastikas flying, I would have been really mad and I know I had a very good\nchance to win a medal.\nA; Well when I came back from that spa, I told my parents I\u2019m leaving. I cannot\nstay here anymore. This is no future for me. My brother had left already. He\ncame to the States in January I believe. No, no, no, no that was later. I said I\u2019m\nleaving and my father had a very good friend who came from this town. And who\nemigrated to the United States, became very rich here and when he visited our\ntown, I was the big shot you know the Olympic candidate. And he said to me oh\nany time you want to come to the United States, just let me know and I\u2019Il give you\nall the papers. So we wrote him a letter and said that we were now ready to\naccept his offer and pretty quick a letter came back saying well times are very bad\nin the United States and you might not be able to find a job and maybe things will\nget better in Germany and maybe you should rethink your future. Maybe you\nshould stay and see what happens. And my father wrote him a very strong letter\n20\n21\nback and he finally did give me the papers and I was able to come to the United\nStates.",
        "A: I came to the United States in May of 1937.",
        "A: When I came over here um the first thing I had to do was make some money\nbecause the Germans allowed each emigrant to take along 4 dollars and a camera\nwhich everybody sold and lived on until they found a job and I had the same\nthing. And the first thing I had to do 1s find a job. But somehow a letter, a, an\narticle appeared in the long defunct World Telegram newspaper, a New York\nnewspaper about me arriving. I don\u2019t know, I think my brother must have been\nmanaging to get this in there and talking about what had happened to me and one\nday a coach showed up at my home and said listen I have a track and field team\nand would you like to compete for me and I said you bet and that was it and he\nwasn\u2019t a very good coach, it was an undertaker. And I kept teasing him that I\nthought the bodies that he prepared for wherever these bodies were going, were in\nbetter shape than the bodies he prepared to compete at the track meets. But he\ntried hard and I competed here several events and did OK.",
        "A: No, I, I really wanted to get back into it and I was right away very successful so\nthat, that kept me going I suppose. The first year I was here I won the American\nchampionship in high jumping. I won the American championship in shot put,\nweighing all of 112 pounds. Beating out my competition who weighed must have\nbeen twice my size and twice my weight and that really gave me a good feeling.",
        "A: It felt very good because I knew that somehow word had to get back to Germany\nthat I did win and that made me feel very good but I knew it wouldn\u2019t be in any\nnewspapers. Would be like word of mouth you know. And I knew that people\nwho wished me well and there were some Germans. I mean not every German\nwas a Nazi, they would be happy for me.",
        "A: We were very worried about my family. My brother came here a few months\nbefore I did. And we were very worried about my family. And finally my father\nwas able to get out even though it was a miracle. They took all the, all the people\nwho they wanted to the Germans who they wanted to keep in Germany, they just\n21\n22\ntook their passports away so there was no way of for them to get out. And my\nfather had a work permit for England which was pretty hard to get but he had\ndone business with England quite a bit and he got that work permit and that was\nabout to expire so he went to the authorities and said listen can I have the, my\npassport back I need to have my work permit renewed and somebody gave him\nthis passport and my father said we are leaving so they packed a little suitcase, a\nlittle clean underwear and they all took off, my brother my mother and left the\nhouse, left everything back and went to the next town, went to the next town,\nwent to the next town. Finally ended up in Cologne where they, they took a\nplane and flew to England.",
        "A: Oh yes, we, we wrote to each other all the time but you had to be extremely\ncareful what you wrote. For instance there was the Crystal night and they took all\nthe men from I think the age of 18 to maybe 60 and took them to concentration\ncamps and we had no idea was my father taken or was, wasn\u2019t he and my mother\nwrote a letter that that Dad was quite ill and had to go away so we knew he was\ngone. And we tried everything you know congressmen and tried to get him back\nand he finally did come back after 4 weeks weighing 80 pounds. And signing\nhimself into the hospital in, in Laupheim and the next day the nuns who ran the\nhospital came to him and said you have to leave. The authorities told me we\ndon\u2019t, we can\u2019t keep Jews here. So they threw him out weighing 80 pounds and\nhe had to recuperate another way. And I still blame them apart from his smoking\ncigarettes that he died at a very sudden death of a heart attack.",
        "A: Dachau. That\u2019s near Munich. And they took all their, their clothing away, they\ndressed them in these clothes, you know like you see in old movies with the\nstripes, the cotton, the cotton suits and they had to stand outside from 5:00 in the\nmorning un, it was November until 11:00 at night. No, no warm underwear, no\nwarm, nothing and I mean this is what they, what they did.",
        "A: I think it was in 39. I know the Crystal night. I can\u2019t remember was it I think it\nwas 38 yeah.",
        "A: Well we just, we just tried to get him out of there you know, we wrote to\neverybody that we could think of to try to get him out and whether, it was, that we\nwere successful or whether they were just saying well let\u2019s get those old guys out\nof here. You know after 4 weeks or 5 weeks he came home. And my husband\u2019s\nbrother and future brother \u2014 in \u2014 law, they were also in Dachau and the Germans\n22\n23\ntold them if you can go someplace, leave Germany today, you can leave. So they\nChina was the only place that would take you without any red tape so they bought\nsteamship tickets to, to China and they went to China.",
        "A: No, that was just a you know it was a fun thing to do I suppose for the Nazis.\n(Change tape)\n(Tape 4 of 4)",
        "A: In the high jump, usually there are always three competitors for each event, three\nin the dash, and three in the shot put and three in the long jump and they only had\ntwo girls in the high jump. And that was a little bit unusual and a long, a long\ntime later I found out that the team was told that Bergman is injured and cannot\ncompete. But I also had the suspicion that they were trying to maneuver this\nwhole thing because a letter was sent around that those who were in Olympic\ncandidates should not expect to be chosen in some of them and that they did not\nmeasure up and that only in some events there would only be 2 competitors and I\nthink that was really done for my sake already. Because they were already trying\nto get rid of me somehow, maybe, I\u2019m not sure but it, it seemed to be very\nunusual that there would only be two girls in the high jump.",
        "A: I think they came, the letter came in the, in the winter before the Olympics, [Il\nhave to check the date.\nA; Adolph Hitler tried to use these Olympics as his propaganda vehicle to show the\nworld how powerful he was, to show the world how unified a Germany was and I\nthink he tried to scare the world into not standing up against him somehow. I\nthink that\u2019s, that\u2019s the way I, I have to look at it. The Olympics were a great, a\ngreat success for Germany at the time. And they built this beautiful stadium. I\nmean people found work due, due to the Olympics, or help the Nazis to, to\nsucceed.",
        "A: I he definitely did gain from it and I, I\u2019ve seen it written in a book someplace\nabout how the Olympics are supposed to bring the youth of the world together and\n23\n24\nthat somebody made the remark that in 1936, the youth of the world came\ntogether in these Olympics and four years later they were, they were coming\ntogether against each other in a battle field. You know then the war started in\n1940.",
        "A: Unfortunately my husband\u2019s parents and many of his relatives were not able to\nget out and we really tried so hard and we had to battle people here to help and\nthere was so little help to be had. My husband has very rich relatives, they had a\njewelry store in, in New York and they\u2019re very rich and I approached them for\npapers for him and they refused and I made out his papers for him. I mean I got\nhim out like it was really not quite honest to get him here. But they, we didn\u2019t\neven think about approaching them for his parents because we knew they\nwouldn\u2019t do it. And we tried, we tried to get them into Cuba and you know the,\nthe people would buy visas for Cuba for $400 and we got 2 visas for them and\njust when their turn was about to come, these visas were found out to be phony\nand that avenue was shut off so and they were all so a little bit reluctant. My\nfather -in -law never could understand that this could happen to him. He said I\u2019ve\nbeen living in this town forever, we were friends with everybody. They can\u2019t do\nanything to us or nothing 1s going to happen to us. And then when he did realized\nthat he should have done something, it was too late. There were many, I, I don\u2019t\nremember how many relatives, I think it at least 15 or 30, I don\u2019t remember how\nmany and in my family too. Some and friends.",
        "A: Right, it was, it was. The American people a lot of them did not kill themselves,\nyou know. They made all the big speeches how, how helpful they wanted to be,\nlike my sponsor when it came down to it, he wasn\u2019t too anxious so my brother\nwho there, the father of the motion picture industry by the name of Carl Laemlle,\nI mean he\u2019s a very famous man, he came into the United States from Laupheim.\nAnd he made out 300 affidavits. Anybody who approached him for papers, he\nmade them out. And he wasn\u2019t sure whether these people weren\u2019t going to sit on\nhis pocket eventually you know but he was wonderful but I think the American\npeople in general were not very generous in that respect.",
        "A: I think it made me a lot tougher, you know to face what, what I had to face and\nlife here was very, very hard in the beginning, I worked as a housemaid for $10 a\nweek and even though life was a lot cheaper then, you couldn\u2019t get very far on\n$10 a week. And my husband worked as a house painter, being a physician he\nworked as a house painter when he, when he arrived over here. It made us, I think\ntougher you know but what we went through and it might have helped us even\nthough it was pretty tough school to go through.\n24\n25",
        "A: Well one thing I, I should mention maybe. I recently got a letter from the\nNational, German National Olympic committee and they invited me to be their\nguest of honor at the Atlanta Olympic games from July the 19\" until August the\n3\" And although I have never gone back to Germany and they invited me before\nfor some other occasion, I have accepted the invitation and I think it will be a very\nemotional thing for me but I, I think I said to my husband what goes around\ncomes around and I think P\u2019ve got to make my peace with this thing at least even\nthough it, it\u2019s it gnawed on me all these years you know and every time the\nOlympics come around, I I get mad as hell again, I say why, why did this happen\ntome. And but I\u2019ve got to make peace before I go wherever I\u2019m going to go, up\nor down, I don\u2019t know. So I\u2019m looking forward to that and I think it was a very\ngesture. They have tried to and the town where I come from also they have tried\nvery hard to make amends. They take care of the Jewish cemetery. Not a single\nJew went back to that town. But the, the citizens of the town take care of the\ncemetery and they have Jewish artists come. They have ,they have all kinds of\nactivities to not to let the Jewish life that once was there die. And I think that is\nthat helped me too because even though I would have, I never, never thought of\ngoing back. I was invited 3 times from the town to go and some people went and\nthey had a very good time. I said no, I will never set foot on German soil again.\nAnd I won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know how long [\u2019ll last but Pll never go back. But I did\naccept that invitation and I\u2019m looking forward to it.",
        "A: Any boycott that would have happened would have influenced only the Olympic\ngames that it would not have been the huge success that Hitler expected from it\nbut Hitler and Nazis they would have gone on no matter what, even if only one\nother country would have shown up to, to participate in the Olympics. I don\u2019t\nthink it had anything to do with what he wanted to accomplish. He wanted to\nconquer the world and he, he, he would have gone forward no matter what. And I\ndon\u2019t think that the Olympics in that respect had anything to do with it.",
        "A: Well there are two trends of thoughts. They could have stayed home or they\ncould have come and showed what a Jew could do. As a matter of fact, I think\nhigh jump was won by a Czech, a Jewish girl and I think that was like spitting in\nHitler\u2019s eye, see a Jews, they can do it. And I think there were some that didn\u2019t\ncome and that was their, whatever they wanted to decide about their lives. But I\nthink they only hurt themselves and they, it didn\u2019t make any, it didn\u2019t make an\nimpact. You know I think it had more, more impact for the Jews to go there and,\nand beat the Germans than, than to stay home and say I\u2019m not going. I have that\n25\n26\nmuch respect for myself that I won\u2019t go. I don\u2019t think that that, was, the ones that\ndid it I respect them for it but the ones who didn\u2019t they have my respect too\nbecause they did what I would have done, beat the Nazis.\n(End)\n26\n"
