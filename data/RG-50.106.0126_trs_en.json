        "Answer: My name is Samuel Spiegal. I was born in\n, Poland on August the 23rd, 1922. I had three\nmore sisters and a brother. I was the oldest one. We hada\nshoe factory at home, and my mother passed away in childbirth\nand I was four years old. Then my father remarried a year\nlater. We had a pretty normal living until the war broke out.\nI wouldn't say we were rich, but we were middle class. We lived\npretty nicely. Then when the war broke out in 1939 it was\nSeptember lst a bomb fell into the house. It was about 7:00 in\nthe morning and we were lucky to get out about five minutes\nbefore, and nobody got hurt. But, this was only the beginning\nbecause the minute the Germans came in, things started to get\nvery bad for us. It was September when school starts again, and\nJewish kids were not allowed to go to school anymore. But, the\nJewish community opened up some little Jewish schools that the\nkids went to so they can learn a little bit. In 1940, the\nmiddle of 1940, the Germans gave an order that we have to give\naway all the jewelry and all the furs that all the people had,\nand we gave everything away, but we thought it's a war, maybe\nthey need it and things are going to get a little bit better.\nThings started getting worse and by the end of 1941 they made\nthe Ghetto in our town.",
        "Question: Actually, I just want to go back a little bit before\nyou describe the Ghetto. A little more background, was your\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfamily religious and also before the war did you mingle with\nPolish kids or did you feel any anti semitism?\nA. Before the war, I went to school, which was a public\nschool, but there were very few Jewish kids in our class of 55\nkids, there were about six Jewish kids. They must sit on one\nside, the left side of the class. Mostly it was a catholic\nschool and prayers were said every morning and every night\nbefore we went home from school. We just stood there, but the\nJewish kids didn't have to say the prayer. We mixed with the\nfriends that I had in school, but socially we hadn't mixed.\nSometimes when they needed some help, some school help, they\nused to come to my house, and I used to help them out a little\nbit, but otherwise, they had different friends and we had\ndifferent friends. Because I went to school from early in the\nmorning until about 2:00 in the afternoon. 2:00 we used to come\nhome and have our main meal. Then I used to go to a Jewish\nschool to learn religion. I usually didn't come home until\nabout 6:00 in the evening. Then, at night my father was very\nactive and designed this movement in those days, so I used to go\nto a Hebrew School which was called a Tabut, and that's usually\nhow my schooling was, because when the war broke out, I was\nabout 16 1/2 close to 17 years old.\nQ. So your family was religious and involved in Jewish\nactivity?\nA. Very involved, but I wouldn't say very religious, more like\nconservative.\nQ. He was involved in political organizations?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 3\nMay 3, 1995\nA. A little bit. I was younger. I don't remember exactly,\nbut I know he was involved in organizations quite a lot.\nQ. Did you ever experience any attacks or any --?\nA. Usually around Easter or Christmas time, the Jewish people\nused to be a little bit afraid and they used to lock their doors\nbecause what they preached mostly in the churches. When they\ncome home and they have a couple drinks or so, things were\npretty rough, but otherwise we didn't have any problems.\nQ. Were you aware of what was going on in Germany at this\npoint?\nA. No, we were aware very little of what was going on in\nGermany. Even when the Germans came in, we figured it's a war\nmaybe things are going to change a little bit, but they closed\nin every time, there came some new rules out and it got to be\nvery bad for the Jewish people.\nQ. How large was your town?\nA. Our town had about close to 10,000 population. 4,500 of it\nwere Jews, close to 50 percent.\nQ. Business and that was fairly integrated?\nA. Right.\nQ. Now, you told me when the Germans came into in your town\nand bomb fell on your house, what was going on?\nA. September the 1st?\nQ. Yes, what was happening?\nA. We ran out from the house, then we had to get another place\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 4\nMay 3, 1995\nto live. I think we moved in with our grandmother for a little\nwhile in a room just to stay until things straightened a little\nbit out. Then when they moved us in and we stayed there for a\nwhile, and I got sick in 1940, I had the typhus, and I was lucky\nthey put me away in a separate room and nobody found out about\nit, and I survived somehow the typhus. Then I worked for the\nJewish Community Center at home, because the Germans, when they\nmade the Ghetto, made like the Judenaut which was a self -- you\nknow the Jews governed themselves and I worked in the office\nover there for them, until I sent away to , to the\nSlave labor camp. Things got very bad in the Ghetto. There was\na lot of sickness, a lot of poverty. We didn't get enough food\nto eat to feed the people, but we helped each other as much as\nwe could as a community. Because we still lived in our own\nhomes, and we had some little things we could trade for food\nwith the farmers from the outside and I even had a paper that I\ncould go outside of the Ghetto, because I worked in the office\nand I worked in the labor department, in that section. I could\nsee what started going on and I was very, very upset with all\nthose things, and I figured that I couldn't stay over there too\nlong, and I decided to get out and when I went to to\nthe camp, this was before they took all the Jewish people out\nfrom our town. The fellow that took me out from there was an SS\nman by the name of . He said we have to go to\n, because there's a big ammunition factory and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 5\nMay 3, 1995\nwe'll have to send a lot of people over there to work. We have\nto go over and see how things are set up over there. When I\ncame over there, we went over there on a Thursday and he said\nMonday maybe we'll come back and he said Sam there's nothing to\ngo back anymore because all the Jewish people from your town\nwere taken away. That's how I stayed over there. All the time\nI was in for about two years.\nQ. Can you tell me a little bit more about the Ghetto, what\nyou all did? Was it closed in?\nA. It was closed in barbed wires. You couldn't go in, you\ncouldn't get out unless you had a special paper from the German\ngovernment. The SS used to come in every day to the Ghetto,\ntake people out to work, kill a lot of them while they were\ndoing it, and we even had a little hospital over there. A lot\nof people that got sick and had typhus, they took them out and\nthey shoot them, they killed them. Also, I remember when they\ncame in one day and this was in 1942 in the beginning, and they\nsaid they need about 25 men and 25 women because they had to\ntake them away to a factory somewhere to work. They took them\ninto a public bath house. They gave them a bath and they shaved\ntheir hair and everything else and they send them away. We\nfound out later that they took them away to a concentration camp\nthat they tried out the crematoriums on them. This was a try\nout. We couldn't believe that those things are happening, but\nlater on we found out that they were true. There was gas put\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 6\nMay 3, 1995\ninto the crematoriums. Life was very difficult in the Ghetto.\nYou couldn't do anything. There was no work. Nobody was\nworking except when the Germans took you out to work somewhere\non the outside, but you still used to come home at night and be\nwith your family. That was one good thing about it. You always\nhad hope. You figured it's a war, maybe the war 1S going to\nfinish tomorrow. Maybe things are going to change. We also\nfelt that we have to stick together in order to keep each other\nalive and maybe things are going to change a little bit.\nQO. What about activities in the Ghetto, cultural activities,\nreligion, your father's political --\nA. All cultural activities and everything stopped because the\nGermans were watching out that you couldn't do, you couldn't do\nthings, you know, you were lucky. You were afraid even to go\nout into the street during the day because they would catch you\nall the time and send you out to work and sometimes you didn't\neven know if you were going to come home, so usually you were\nhidden all the time as much as you could. They used to come in\nevery day to the Ghetto and do what they want to, anda lot of\npeople got killed. If they didn't like somebody, they just\nkilled them in the middle of the street. It didn't make any\ndifference.\nQO. Did you see that?\nA. Oh, sure, absolutely. I remember the name. He was a\nUkrainian, not really an SS, by the name of Schmitky, they used\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 7\nMay 3, 1995\nto call him. He was a very, very cruel man. He just came out.\nI remember right near our house there was a fellow, his name was\nLittman, Phil Littman was his name, and I remember he shot him\nright in front of our house. We were sitting inside. We were\nafraid even to go out. So those things were going on daily. It\nwas a daily occurrence. It wasn't new.\nQ. Did your father keep up any this organizing underground,\nthe Zionism?\nA. I couldn't say because I don't remember and I don't think\nso. It's true that they got together and they talked about\ncertain things, but very little could be done, because there was\nno help from the outside. In the Ghetto without help from the\noutside, it was very hard to organize anything, especially ina\nsmall town like ours.\nQ. Did you observe shobot, holidays, anything?\nA. We used to observe it in the way we could. I remember my\nmother used to light candles every Friday, but as far as the\nfood was concerned, we didn't have the food that we had before\nthe war. If you had a little piece of bread and some potatoes\nit was enough just to survive. I used to help a little bit\nbecause I worked in the Judenaut and I had maybe my portion a\nlittle bit more so I usually used to bring it home instead of\neating so I can help out the family a little bit.\nQ. Tell me a little about the Judenaut, how you got that job?\nA. The way I got the job was the fellow who was running the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 8\nMay 3, 1995\nJudenaut, was a very good friend of my father's, and that's how\nI got the job. It wasn't easy to get a job like this, because\nusually when you work for the Judenaut and you're over there and\nall the food and everything came in, you always had a little bit\nmore that you can have a little piece of bread more to eat, but\nIT usually didn't eat it myself. I brought it home, because I\nknew the rest of the family needed it more than I did, because\nthey didn't have any other means to get their food from.\nQ. What other privileges did you get from working there?\nA. The privileges that I had was that I wasn't called to work\nevery day, that I was at home, and I worked in the office, and I\nhad special papers that even I could walk outside of the Ghetto,\nif I had to go out for something. If you get out from the\nGhetto, because you mix with the Gentile people outside, you\ncould help yourself a little bit more.\nQ. Were you able to help your family by virtue of your\nposition other than the food?\nA. No, not much. I had a younger brother, which I send him\nout to work one time, which they worked at , and\nit was named , the firm. But what happened,\nthe day before they took all the Jews from our town, he came\nhome, the night before. He was caught in the transport and he\nwas taken away.\nQ. Was your Judenaut appointed by the local community or by\nthe Germans?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 9\nMay 3, 1995\nA. Mostly by the Germans. They picked one man, and then he\npicked everybody that he wanted to. Some people that he knew or\nwere close friends of his.\nQO. You hear stories about Judenauts and various communities.\nSome of them were very helpful to the community, some of them\nwere trying to save their own lives. How do you kind of assess\nhow your Judenaut operated?\nA. We knew it was a very difficult time. You have to\nunderstand what was going on in those days. You had to do what\nthe Germans wanted you to do. If they came in and saw the\nPresident of the Judenaut, I want 200 people tomorrow to work,\nyou had to be the one to supply those 200 people. So, you hada\nlot of people that didn't like you because, they said why take\nme? Why not take somebody else? You're put in the position\nthat if you do right or you do wrong, you're not right. I'm\nsure that you heard that , which was the President,\ncommitted suicide because he knew what was going on. Some\npeople were a little bit stronger and they didn't commit\nSuicide. They did what they had to do and they made a lot of\nenemies. In my opinion they really helped a lot of people, too.\nBut you don't remember the good things that people do, a lot of\npeople you remember the bad things what a lot of people do. I\ncouldn't say that I think most of them didn't want to do what\nthey did, but they had to do because they were forced to do,\nbecause if not, somebody else would do the thing, and they would\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 10\nMay 3, 1995\nlose their life.\nQ. Now, you worked in the labor department?\nA. Right. The labor department, for instance, the Germans\ncame in. They said we want 200 people tomorrow to go to work\ntomorrow morning, and we had to get out the names from the\nregister that we had, which people are going to go tomorrow and\nwhich people are going the next day. I worked in the office,\nyou know to go alphabetically, but I wasn't really the one who\nwent out and took the people out, who put them to work. I\nworked in the office.\nQO. But how were those choices made, which 200?\nA. They usually were made according the list that we had. The\nway the President of the Judenaut decided or the people on top\nof them. I was young. I was 17 years old. I didn't make the\nbig decisions. They said, listen, those people we don't want to\ngo, and those people we want to go, because you know there is\nalways somebody who is a little better off or have other people,\nand we were watching out that the people in the position to help\nother people they should stay in place to help them, instead of\nsending them out of town.\nQ. Can you give me any more ideas how they choose these 200\npeople versus another 200?\nA. Usually we try to take them according to alphabetical\norder, so we really, I don't think we made choices you know this\nperson 1S going to go and this person is not going to go. I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 11\nMay 3, 1995\nmentioned that there were certain people who were privileged.\nIf he had some in his family, you know, he didn't send them out\nto a certain job that was very hard. He picked them out to go\nto a job that was a little easier. I imagine everybody did the\nsame thing. If I could help some of my friends, I helped them.\nIf I could help somebody else.\nQO. Were there women in the Judenaut?\nA. No, not too many that I can remember.\nQ. Were you aware of any sort of manipulation of the Judenaut\ntoward other people because of their special power?\nA. I don't remember. There might have been in the higher\nechelon, but I wasn't in the higher echelon to be able to tell\nyou.\nQ. The Judenaut also took care of food and everything else?\nA. That's right. They used to dispense the food. They used\nto get it, and then divide it. The people used to have little\ncarts that you used to come to collect your food, once a week or\ntwice a week. We also had soup kitchens that we set up in order\nto help the people that didn't have a place to cook or couldn't\nhelp themselves.\nQ. Anything else about the Ghetto that you can think of?\nA. The Ghetto was very, very bad, and lot of people when they\nhad people who hardly had anything, if they heard about a good\njob that was outside, that the Germans took you away, they\nwanted to go because the Germans never told you that they were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 12\nMay 3, 1995\ngoing to take you to a concentration camp or somewhere else.\nThey said we have here, we need some people to send out the job.\nWe're going to take you and you're going to be living over there\nand you're going to be all right. So, a lot of people even went\nby themselves because they figured they would be better off than\nbeing in the Ghetto because the Ghetto was very bad. You didn't\nhave enough to eat and there was a lot of starvation and\nSickness going on. We didn't know really until later on what\nwas going on in the concentration camps, because even I, myself,\ndidn't believe until I got to Auschwitz that they're really\ngassing and burning people until I saw it myself.\nQ. So, you were already in 2\nA. Yes, in 1942 I was in , and I worked over\nthere in the building section. It was a very, very big place.\nWe lived right in the factory. It was like a whole city. It\nwas one of the largest ammunition factories in Poland. That's\nwhere I got to know my wife over there in 1942 because women and\nmen were in the same camp. We lived in separate barracks, but\nwe were in the same camp. The camp was really watched by a\nUkrainian. The Germans were in charge, but Ukrainians were\nwatching our camp. It was pretty tough over there, but we had a\nlittle bit more to eat. We worked but we mixed with other\nnationalities. The Polish people worked in the same factory.\nAt night time we used to come home and still see our friends and\neverybody else. We tried to help each other as much as we can.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 13\nMay 3, 1995\nLet's say, if somebody could bring a little piece out from the\noutside and he could share it somebody else, he usually shared\nit with somebody else. We found out after the war that the\nfellow that was in charge of our camp over there, he was a\nGerman by the name of Brant, that thanks to him, that labor camp\nwas a little bit better, that we didn't suffer as much as in\nother camps. He was caught after the war in the and\nhe was telling the things that he was doing for us. I know when\nthey took us away to Auschwitz, he went to Auschwitz and told\nthem that , we were very good workers and we know\nthe ammunition, that we worked in the ammunition factory, and\nthey should send us to work in the factories. They did. Very\nfew of our people, except the older ones were taken away to the\ncrematorium. The rest of us we got numbers and we were sent\naway to work. I wasn't in Auschwitz really too long. I was\nover there maybe three or four days. When we came to Auschwitz,\nby the old conductor trains, the wagon, the cattle trains, a lot\nof our people were dead, because we traveled -- I don't remember\nexactly if it took two days, or three days, or maybe four days,\nbut we didn't have any food. We didn't have any water. They\ndidn't give us anything. We didn't have any facilities even in\nthe wagons. When they opened up, a lot of people were dead, and\nbecause we were people that already came from another labor\ncamp, we didn't have any luggage with us, or any valuables.\nThey chased us out from there and we went through the showers,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 14\nMay 3, 1995\nand luckily it was showers and not gas. We came out from there\nand they numbered us and they put us in barracks. Then, people\ncame in from factories because the Germans, this was in 1944, a\nlot of the Germans went up on the front lines and they needed\npeople to replace them at their factories, so they needed\nworkers. So they came in from the factory, this is\nfrom the train factory and they said they need sheet metal men.\nI didn't have a trade, but I had a friend by the name of\nCoopersmith. He passed away, he survived and lived in\nCalifornia and they said Sam, when they ask for sheet metal men,\nwhy don't you pick up your hand and tell them you're sheet metal\nman. You're very handy, you'll go with me. We'll see that you\ndo something, but God's will they picked him and sent him to a\ncoal mine and they sent me into Germany to work in the train\nfactory. I came in over there, I didn't know the trade, I\ndidn't know what to do, but then I tried to take the broom and\nkeep the shop very clean, which it was a very big factory.\nThere was about 6,000 people working over there, but our section\nhad maybe 30 people working, 35, in the sheet metal section, and\nthere were three Germans that were running it, so because I kept\nthe place clean, so they figured everything is fine. They took\na liking to me. I learned a little bit of trade over there. By\nthe end of 1944 I think it was in November, when the United\nStates and the RusSians started progressing more on Germany, and\nthe Germans used to have their shops on the front lines in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 15\nMay 3, 1995\ntrains, and they bunked a lot of those trains, they brought a\nlot of our men to the train factory to be fixed. The soldiers\nthat were in those trains, came with them. They usually waited\nuntil the trains were fixed, so they put on another shift.\nBefore they put on another shift, the SS man came in. His name\nwas Fox. He said, each one he assigned us a train, a pullman to\ngo out and check on those pullman. I went out to mine because I\ndidn't know the train, but I knew how to write and read and I\nmade a plan of the train and I showed him where the damage was\nand what we're going to fix. When he came on and asked\neverybody what to do, he came to me and after I showed him\nthose, he says you're going to run the second shift. I couldn't\ntell the men. I took the bull by the horn. I figured listen I\nhad to take a chance because I had different nationals working\nunder me in the second shift. We went out to work, and we did\nthe job so fast that we got a little bit tobacco extra and I\nnever smoked. Usually everything I got, I shared it with the\npeople. They Knew that I didn't know the trade, but they\ncouldn't tell the men that I don't know it either as long as I\nwas put in charge, I was put in charge over the train. That's\nwhere I learned my trade. When I came to the United States,\nthat's the trade I went into, and I built up a shop in\nWashington DC and thank God I was very successful, and that's\nhow I made a living in the United States when I came over here.\nQO. I want to learn a little bit more detail about some of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 16\nMay 3, 1995\nthese camps, these labor camps. Your interaction with the other\npeople, with the guards, what your daily life was like?\nA. In concentration camp we didn't have any interaction with\nthe guards. You're very, very scared of them. I'm going to\ntell you an incident which happened to me. I worked in the\nsheet metal shop, and I used to make things out of little pieces\nof copper that I used to find, other things, some rings. I used\nto exchange them for little pieces of bread. I was called one\nday, and this was about the end of November 1944, and the men\ntook my number and usually every Sunday the persecutions were\ngoing on, because we didn't work. Anybody did something that\nthey didn't like, they used to hang them and then send them away\nto the crematoriums.\nQ. This 1S which camp?\nA. Auschwitz. And I already knew what was going to happen. I\nfigured my gosh how can I get out of it. I knew what was going\nto happen to me on Sunday because I was caught with materials\nthat , which means they are materials they use\nduring the war for war materials, because I used copper. So, I\nmade the decision that when the main commandment came out, we\nhad appeals every morning that we stayed out. I had to come\nbecause the Germans were very how do you say it -- they counted\nus almost all the time. I went out and I went down to the main\nman behind him and I told him that I was making something for\nhim for Christmas and it was taken away from me in the shop. I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 17\nMay 3, 1995\nsaid I don't mind that they took it away from me, but I said I\nworked for it for almost two weeks in order to have it for you\nas a present and I would like you to have it. It went away, I\nnever heard any thing more about it. They never called me. The\ncommander got to know me very well because we went out through\nthe gate a lot of times. He used to knock me on the shoulders\nwhen we went out. That's how I survived from going to the\ncrematoriums one time. We had to think sometimes. When the\nGhetto was liguidated, my whole family went to Treblinka, and\nthey all perished in the crematorium in Treblinka. That's what\nI found out at , a couple weeks later after I\nwas there. So, I was the only one from the whole family left,\nfrom the immediate family, but I had some friends that they\nbrought in from my town to , too, and they worked\nover there. So, we used to meet every day. I think in\nthere must have been about 2,000 or a little bit\nover 2,000 people over there working. Things were tough. We\ndidn't have enough to eat. There was sicknesses. I had two\nfriends by the name, one of them, that he was sick one of them\nwas and the other one was , and they\ntook them all out one day and they shot them all. They\nliguidated the whole hospital in . They took\neverything out. So, you can imagine how we felt. Things were\nvery bad. I had to get in to tell other monstrosities that were\ngoing on over there, but that's what they did. They took them\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 18\nMay 3, 1995\nall out and shot them at one day. Plus the other things that\nwere going on. We got beatings every day, coming in or going\nout. The food was very bad. We used to get a little piece of\nbread in the morning and we used to get little bit of soup at\nnight. But, like I told you, we tried to help each other in\norder to keep our things a little bit up. When we came to\nAuschwitz, it was altogether different. It was hard to believe\nwhat was going on over there. We could see the chimneys. We\ncould smell the smoke. We knew the people that were taken over\nthere. We were ones of the lucky ones. The minute we got out of\nthe wagons and they started chasing us and they gave us the\nnumbers on our arms, and they shaved us all together and then\nthey put us through a solution that we walked through. We\ndidn't even know. We were just like animals. You were chased\nand you didn't know what was going on to you at that time. Then\nthey put us in line and they came out and the doctors mingle and\nthe other ones were in white coats, and they look through and\none of them goes to this side, and one of them goes to this\nSide, and one to this side, and one to the other side. Now, I\nwas lucky that it was Birkenau, not really Auschwitz. This was\npart -- they called it Auschwitz II. Then them came to make the\nselections. When they made the selections and I was sent away\nin those first three days, that I was in Auschwitz three or four\ndays. I don't even remember. It's very hard for me to\nremember. We didn't do any work. We were sitting outside. It\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 19\nMay 3, 1995\nwas cold, it was wet and they wouldn't even let us get into\nbarracks until they came at night. Then we used to sleep with\n15 people on one , with a little bit of snow. I was\nglad to get out from there. When they brought us into\n, which was part of Auschwitz, it was the factory\nthat we went to, over there, because we worked with different\nnationalities and we worked in the factory with a lot of\nGermans, everybody had a different . We hada\nstraw sack with a little blanket. That's all we had. We slept\nwith about 200 people in one room. But they kept us a little\nbit cleaner. We had the laundry and the clothes that we were\nwearing the striped clothes. We had to change because in the\nfactory it was grease working around trains. We had to change.\nWe used to come home, and used to change the clothes and they\ngave us other clothes. But, we had selections every Sunday.\nThey looked us through, and if somebody didn't look so good,\nthey took them out and they send them away to the crematoriums.\nThey brought in other people to replace them. The food we got\nin the morning, you had to get up about 4:00 in the morning and\nwe stayed outside. They called it Appeal, that they counted us,\nevery morning, and if somebody was missing, we had to stay\noutside, cold or rain didn't make any difference until the men\nwere found. Because sometimes somebody died during the night\nand never even came out, or something happened, but we had to\nwait. And if they didn't count us, we didn't couldn't go to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 20\nMay 3, 1995\nwork until everything was counted. Then we had about five\nmiles, maybe four miles that we would have to walk from the camp\nto the factory. The music was playing near the gate where we\nwent out, and the music was playing at night when we came home.\nWe got a little piece of bread, about six of us got one pound of\nbread. The bread was made out, you could feel the straw inside\nthat you could hardly eat it, but we had to eat it because you\nhad to survive on something. We got a little bit, it was like\ntea. They said it was a special tea that was made that we drank\na little bit. Then in the middle of the day you got a little\nbit of soup which was mostly water. Then at night, when we came\nhome, either we got another little piece of soup or we got\nanother little piece of bread. This was our food for a whole\nday. Things were very, very bad, because a lot of people, we\ndidn't have enough food, they used to get diarrhea and they used\nto get sick. The minute you got sick a little bit, you were\ntaken out, and we alot of times when we went out to work and\nmaybe 2,000 people, and the men says I only want 1,800 back and\nby the time we got back, we had trucks behind us that they\nkilled off the rest of them. We just loaded on the truck the\nones that couldn't keep up with --you know, because we walked\nfrom the factory to the thing. The ones that couldn't keep up\nwith it, they killed them on the road, and they put them on the\ntrucks and then they took them away to the crematoriums. But we\ncouldn't help ourselves. We couldn't even escape because on the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 21\nMay 3, 1995\noutside there was nobody to help us. I had a friend that\nescaped from the trains when they took us on the trains and got\ninto the woods, and when he came back, he was taken to Treblinka\nat that time. His name was . %L'll never forget.\nHe came back, he said listen don't go on those trains because\nthey burn you over there and we thought that the man was crazy.\nWe didn't believe him. We said how can they tell living people\nand burn them especially you know in our days? And another\nthing that we couldn't understand it's as if the world would\nknow that those things would go on, we are taught that somebody\noutside must know because if they would know what was going on\nin here, they couldn't sit outside and not do anything about it.\nBut, we never got any help from the outside. When he was on the\noutside and was in the woods, he said he couldn't stay over\nthere because they wanted to kill him because\n, so he tried to get back and came back to our\ncamp in . This was in before they\ntook us on the trains. That man didn't live through. They took\nus on the trains to go to Auschwitz, because he was already on\nthose trains going to Treblinka one time, from ,\nfrom our town. He jumped the train from Auschwitz, and he was\nshot before he got -- no, before we got on the train, he ran\naway, and he was shot. But, when we came to Auschwitz, we\nrealized what the man told us was true, but we couldn't help\nourselves. Auschwitz, we had a lot of hope. We could see that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 22\nMay 3, 1995\nthis thing couldn't last on forever. But, it was very easy to\ncommit suicide. All you had to do was through yourself on the\nwires, because the wires were electric. They had 600 volts in\nthem. And a lot of people did it. But, if we found out that\nsomebody was very despondent and we felt that he was going to do\nsomething, we tried to talk to him and tell him listen, the\noutside world cannot sit like t his and watch what's going on\nhere and not do anything. It looks like the war is already\ncoming to an end. We knew little things what were going on\nbecause we didn't have any radios. We didn't have any papers,\nand nobody was telling us anything because even the Germans that\nworked with us in the factory were afraid to talk to us, because\nif they noticed that they talk to us too much, they took him\naway. They took them away, too. So, we tried to help each\nother as much as we could in order to survive. And thank God\nsome of us survived. When they took us out on the Death March -\nQ. Wait a minute, we haven't talked about the Death March yet\nSo we need to set that up.\nA. All right. One day, when we were , they came\nin and they said that they have to take us all out. They didn't\ntake us where we were going. We found out later that this was\nthe death march. We were only about 60 kilometers away from\nAuschwitz and all the people that were going met the same way.\nSo, they took us out one morning. It was snowing in January,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 23\nMay 3, 1995\nJanuary the 22nd. It was snowing and it was very cold outside\nbecause over there the temperature goes about 30 degrees below\nzero. We didn't have any clothes. We didn't have anything with\nus, and we marched because they didn't have any trains to put us\non, and anybody that couldn't keep up with the marchers were\nshot on the way. One night it was in January, I think it was\nthe 25th of January, they brought us to a camp in\n, which was a big factory. They brought us in all\nover there because the SS that were going with us, they had to\nrest a little bit too. So, we stayed over and in the middle of\nthe night they started shelling the factory. They woke us up\nabout 12:00, 1:00 in the morning. There might have been about\n60,000 of us over there because they brought them from all over.\nThey chased us out and I had a dream that night when I was\nsleeping, my mother came to me and said Sam, don't leave this\nplace and I had an argument with her. I told her listen, how\ncan I not leave. You know we're almost liberated. You see\nwhat's going on, but when they started chasing us, I forgot the\ndream. When I was near the gate to go out, I had two friends\nwith me, one was from my town, Weinberg was his name, and the\nother one was from . When we came to the gate, my\ndream came back to me and I figured, no I'm not going to go.\nI'm not going. So, the other one from my town, he didn't want\nto go with me. He said, Sam we're almost liberated I'm going\nout. I'm going where they chasing us to go. I said no, but the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 24\nMay 3, 1995\nother one, I took care of him. He was a little bit younger and\nI took care of him a lot in camp when I was there. So, I\nsmacked him in his face and I took him with me and I ran back\ninto the camp to the other side and there was a big hole. It\nwas a brick wall over there about three foot thick, and there\nwas a big hole in it that was made from one of the shells or\nsomething. I crawled out and there was a ravine and I rolled\ndown into the snow with them and we ran into the woods and we\nstayed over there for about eight days until the Russians came\nin. The Russians liberated us. If you asked me how I survived\nin those woods for eight days in that cold weather and\neverything else, I can hardly remember. I know we had frozen\ntoes and at night time we used to go out from the woods. In\nEurope they used to have to put away potatoes in the winter time\noutside and they used to cover them with sawdust and then have a\ndoor on the southside that they used to take the potatoes out.\nThe sun used to come out during the day, so we stole some of\nthose potatoes and we ate those raw potatoes and we had snow as\nwater. That's how we lived through until we survived from those\neight days. If you ask me to tell you anything about those\nthings, I couldn't. But there were some other people in the\nwoods too, when I was over there. I met a friend of mine, from\nmy town, that escaped too, at the same time, by the name of\nDavid Bay, and he lives now in Washington, D.C., and we're still\nvery close. We used to crawl one into the other one in order to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 25\nMay 3, 1995\nkeep us warm during the night until we got up the next morning.\nThen we used to run a little bit, you know, in order just to\nSurvive. Then from that time after, I walked home. It took me\nalmost about two weeks to get home because there was no\ntransportation. We could catch any transportation we could, and\nwhen I came home, -- so I was one of the ones who was liberated\nearly. Even when I came back to my town--the reason I went back\nwas because I thought maybe somebody from my family was alive\nstill. I couldn't believe that everybody was gone that was\nthere. There was no work, and no way to make a living, and I\ntold you before that one of my father's friend's daughter was\nalive. She was on the Gentile side. She was not ina\nconcentration camp. She was home already. I even got together\nwith her I told her I said Tasha, we are only about seven Jewish\npeople in the whole town that came back in those days when I was\nover there. Some of them even came from the Russian side\nalready or there were Gentile papers. I said we have to do\nsomething in order to make a living. I said I'm going to put\nthat flour mill back in operation. I did. I got the Gentile\nfellow, the machine shop, and we put it back in operation. We\nstarted -- the farmers used to bring in their corn, and we used\nto keep 50 percent for the making the flour and they used to\nkeep the other 50 percent. That's how me made a living in those\ndays. We have a little house over there. We remodeled a little\nbit and we moved in. I didn't know that Regina was alive still\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 26\nMay 3, 1995\nQ. We need to stop here a moment. First of all, I want you to\ntell me what it was like when you went back to your home town\nafter you were liberated. I mean you didn't go there and five\nminutes later you were a business man. What did you do? What\ndid you find?\nA. When I came back to town, the first thing, we left a lot of\nthings with a lot of people, with our neighbors. I couldn't get\nanything back, and I was afraid to get back because I figure\nwhen asking to give back they might do something to me. So, all\nthe Jewish people that came back, we moved into one of our\nhouses that my uncle used to have. And we stayed over there all\ntogether, and one of my cousin's survived too. She lives now in\nBelgium. So, we all lived over there for quite a while, maybe\nfor a couple, two or three months, but we had to go and get\nsomething to eat, because nobody gave us. We used to go to the\ngovernment, but they themselves didn't have too much, but at\nleast we had a little piece of bread to eat because we didn't\nneed the things like you know like we live over here now. If we\nhad a piece of bread and a couple potatoes, this was enough for\nus to eat. But we started to build up ourselves a little bit.\nBut, I got sick. I had to go to the hospital. I had the\ninfection. I was in the hospital for a little while, but when I\ncame out and I got together with my father's friend's daughter,\nwe decided that we had to do something. I didn't want to put it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 27\nMay 3, 1995\nup aS a business. I wanted to put it up so that we can make a\nliving and the farmers needed us too. The farmers were after us\nto put the flour mill back in operation because that was the\nonly flour mill around, maybe 50 miles around our community.\nThe only one.\nQ. How did your Polish neighbors treat you? Did they welcome\nyou back?\nA. Not really. I hate to say it, but even with the friends\nthat I went to school and everything else, I lived over there.\nI was born over there. My family lived over there for\ngenerations. I don't know how many generations, but the first\nguestion when they saw me \"You're still alive?\" But, things are\ndifferent now. I always tell them that I wish you would ask me\nif I lived in Holland, not in Poland. From the whole town, from\nthe 4,500 that we lived in, I think maybe close to a 100 are\nalive and not all went to concentration camps. A lot of them\nran away to Russia and they came back from Russia after the war.\nWe still get together even during the summer, we have sometimes\na gathering from our town that we get together, all of them\ntogether, to see how everything goes.\nQ. So, they weren't very kind to you when you got back?\nA. No, not too kind. And we had --I had to escape from there,\nbecause they started pogroms again. The pogroms started in\nand the day Regina came back she went to her town,\nand she went up to her apartment and knocked at the door to find\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 28\nMay 3, 1995\nout if some of her family may have come back. There was a\nfellow behind that said Regina run away because they just\nkilled . was a fellow that came\nback too from concentration camp, and they just killed him. So,\nshe went down from that apartment and she didn't have time to\nget into her apartment house, then she came back to my town.\nQ. Now, we haven't even discussed Regina, so people watching\nthe tape won't know who Regina is. You need to back track a\nlittle bit.\nA. In the beginning, I think I said that I met Regina in\nin 1942, and then when they took us on the\ntrain to Auschwitz before they took us off the trains we could\nsee what was going on. We made up that if we live through we're\ngoing to meet in , my little town, and get together\nover there. She was liberated in May, and when she came back to\nour town, was sometime June, but it's miraculous that she was\nliberated on the third day, she already knew that I was alive,\nbecause things were going on, the communication. She knew, she\nmet some people that says I already heard that Sam is alive and\nI was glad to hear too, and I was waiting for her to come back\nbecause I was the only one left from the whole family. She was\nthe only one left from the hole family.\nQ. I was wondering when you were talking about your fiance\ncoming to your town, did you think you'd see her again?\nA. I was hoping that I would because I knew I lost everybody\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 29\nMay 3, 1995\nelse, but I was very happy to hear that she was still alive\nbecause I found out. News traveled, and maybe I should get back\nfor someplace for her to come to, but we couldn't get married.\nWhat happens in the Jewish religion to get married you need ten\npeople to have a witness to have a . There weren't\nten Jews even there to get married, but we got together the ones\nthat were over there and we told them, that because she doesn't\nhave a place where to live and I don't, we're going to move in\ntogether and we're going to get married the minute we can get\nmarried.\nO. So, describe to me when she came, when you saw her?\nA. Oh, it's very I was one of the happiest people because I\nfigured she was the closest one to me, because I was with her\nfor almost two years in together, and in\nShe lived ina different barrack, and I lived ina\ndifferent barrack and one time I went over to visit her and one\nUkrainian took me out from a room and I got 25 lashes and I'll\nnever forget it, but it was worth it to see her.\nQ. You went to her barrack?\nA. Yes.\nQO. You went inside?\nA. Oh, sure. You could go in. We didn't live together in the\nsame barracks, but we lived in the same camp and the same camp\nyou could go and visit them. But if the Ukrainian, if he wasn't\na very nice fellow, he took you out and most of them were not\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 30\nMay 3, 1995\nnice and they just gave me a beating one of those times. He\nsaid it's too late, you should already be in your barrack not\nover here. Because I didn't have time to go when I got home\nfrom work anyhow. So, we knew in Poland that we couldn't stay\nover there no more. We'll have to leave this country. There's\nno place for Jews to live any more after what happened over\nthere. So, one day, when I found out what was going on and I\nhad a threat that they're trying to kill me so I went to the\nmayor of the town and I found out that he was one of the\nteachers that I used to go to school in my last years. His name\nwas Peshko. He was in the underground. He was in the\nunderground during the war. I went over to him and I told him\nMr. Peshko, I have to leave. I lived through Hitler and I don't\nneed this and I have to get a paper from you to get on the train\nbecause Russia was at that time in Poland and you couldn't just\ngo on a train any time you wanted to. So, he said, Sam I'm\ngoing to give you a paper because we're trying to have a\nout on and maybe you can get over\nthere. But when I got the paper I was afraid to take the train\nin my town because people knew me. So, Regina and I packed,\njust two sets of underwear ina little suitcase and I went out\nof town to another town to and took the train from\nover there. At that night we ended up on the Czechoslovakian\nborder. They went through and they checked your passports on\nthe Polish side. We went out from the train. We crawled under\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 31\nMay 3, 1995\nthe train on both sides. Went out to the Czechoslovakian train\nand so when the Asians went out from their trains we went\nupstairs and wind up in Czechoslovakia. When we came to\nCzechoslovakia we came to I think and then we went\nto Prague. We got off the -- we took a street car to get into\nthe town from the train and Regina thought that I had the little\nSuitcase and I thought she had the little suitcase and we left\nit on the streetcar. So, we came to town to the main it was a\nstation over there, a street car station, and I asked Regina do\nyou have the suitcase? No, do you have it? No. So, I asked\nthe fellow, we spoke a little bit Czechoslovakian because it's\nthe same language a little bit similar to Polish, he said you\nwait here. It takes about three quarters of an hour for the\nstreet car to come back and I'm sure the little suitcase is\ngoing to be on it. We waited over there for three quarters and\nwe had a little suitcase and we got it back, so we're lucky to\nget the two sets of underwear because we didn't have anything\nelse. But then they had the Jewish community over there\nalready. We stayed over there, we stayed in Czechoslovakia for\nmaybe a month, and then I decided we can't stay here either and\nI went back with Regina to the American zone in Germany and I\ncame to the D.P. camp in which was established at\nthis time. We were one of almost the first ones over there and\nI worked in that office too. I worked for the United Nations\nRelief Organization. I worked for the Joint Distribution\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 32\nMay 3, 1995\nCommittee. And the Joint Distribution made our wedding over\nthere. We got married over there. The wedding was in Munich,\ntook us to Munich. Then Regina got sick. Something was wrong\nand they took her to the hospital and they gave her some\nmedicine which didn't agree with her and she developed some kind\nof a blood -- something was wrong with her blood and a fellow\ncame in from the C.I.A, and American, by the name of Doctor\nAaron Mayer, asked what can I do for you. She said I don't need\nanything, the only thing she says I know I have an uncle in the\nUnited States that lived in New York, but I don't know where he\nlives but I know his name was . So, what he did,\nDoctor Aaron Mayer, he put an ad in the Jewish papers but the\nuncle didn't read the Jewish newspapers. He read the New York\nTimes. A lady from Washington D.C. by the name o Mrs. Freedman,\nused to work with her mother. Her mother used to have a dress\nshop in Poland, and she read the and she knew him\nfrom home and she called him up in New York and told him that\nthe niece of his is alive and was looking for him. The first\nthing we got from him was papers to come to the United States\nand they were signed by J. Edgar Hoover, because J. Edgar Hoover\nwas a friend of her uncle's. But we still couldn't come to the\nUnited States. It took us almost a year because in those days\nit was guarters and you just couldn't leave. So, we waited over\nthere but her uncle also at that time send us some money but we\nnever got it because he said it's not allowed for you to have\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 33\nMay 3, 1995\nany American money in those days, so they sent it back to the\nuncle. We found this out after the war. I was very friendly\nwith that Doctor Aaron Mayer and the C.I.A. and we used to come\ntogether and meet each other while we were in Germany.\nEnd of Tape 1\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 34\nMay 3, 1995\nTape 2\nA. We got those papers from her uncle, and it took us almost a\nyear before we could come over here, even with the papers being\nin order and everything else, but we moved from to\nbecause we found out one of the brothers was alive\nand he was in the American Army. He escaped during the war. He\nwent to England, then he got on a ship and came to the United\nStates and jumped ship. Then he joined the American Army and\nbecame a citizen and that's how he came back to Europe. Then\nwhen we found out he was in Regina says we might as\nwell move to so we can be closer to her brother.\nWe stayed over there until we came over to the United States.\nLet me tell you something about . When we came to\n, we were one of the first ones to come to the\nD.P. camp. There were a lot of other nationalities over there,\nbut they all had a home to go back to. They had relatives, but\nthe Jews didn't have any place to go back especially in Poland.\nThere homes were destroyed. No family left, and there was no\nplace for them to go back and live. Even at the border, the\nones that came back and started, they found out\nthere's no place for them to live. They had to come back. They\nhave to go back and it was a lucky thing that we have to thank\nPresident Eisenhower for opening up the borders and letting the\nJews from Poland come back in to West Germany. Also, a lot of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 35\nMay 3, 1995\nthe people that were in Russia somewhere else that they escaped\ndidn't have any place to go and they came to the D.P. camps in\nGermany. We stayed over there. In the beginning the place was\nalmost like a Ghetto too. We were closed in the camps. They\nhad soldiers outside watching us. We couldn't go out. We\ndidn't have freedom to move. So, finally, President Eisenhower\ngave an order to take the guards off that we can go free around\nand move to the towns that we want to so we could walk a little\nbit more out and everybody started to find out. Most of us\nwanted to go to Palestine in those days, but Palestine was not a\nstate and they couldn't take us. So, they had the ax of the\nship that they got, they took some of them in, but the rest of\nthem we had to stay over there, especially if you were married\nand you already have somebody those were the worst ones that\nthey wanted to take out in those days. They took out only the\nsmall children that were left. They figured that's the most\nimportant to get them out from Europe. The food in the camps\nwas not too bad, but they gave us rations but you know they said\nwe'll give you 1,300 calories but it depends what kind of food\nthey give us, the calories. It wasn't food that the people were\nused to it. So, President Eisenhower changed those things too.\nThen we started helping ourselves a little bit, and started\nworking a little bit and people started to find out where there\nfamilies are so they can leave because none of us wanted to stay\nin the D.P. camps, but we didn't have a place where to go. The\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 36\nMay 3, 1995\nUnited States wouldn't let us in in those days. Canada wouldn't\nlet us in. Australia wouldn't let us in. Go back to Poland,\nthe Polish Jewish couldn't go back to Poland any more. I was\nover there already back one time and I had to escape. So, we\nhad problems for quite a while. It's hard to understand what\nwas going on over there. With all those things, unless you're\nover there yourself you witness it, because it's impossible to\ntell what was going on in the concentration camps or even the\nSlave labor camps or even the D.P. camps. We still didn't have\nenough freedom in the D.P. camps until the end because we were\nstill controlled by the Americans what we can do and what we\ncannot do. President Eisenhower was a big help, and he really\ndid a lot for the D.P. camps, quite a lot.\nQ. Was it your sense that was well organized\nand well run and that people's needs were basically taken care\nof?\nA. Not in the beginning when I got in over the first time, but\nlater on it improved, because I worked in the office. I worked\nfor the and I was taking care of the registration.\nPeople that came in over there and then the was\ngetting some food out already for the people and they found out\nexactly what they need and what they want. We had a kitchen.\nAt least we had enough to fill our stomachs. We didn't have to\nwait until -- you still had to have cards to go and get your\nfood, like coupons. But we already had enough. They set up a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 37\nMay 3, 1995\nschool. If there were any children that came in, they could go\nto school, and we organized our own theaters and clubs so we can\ncome together and we can talk about. If a family was left, they\nfound out if you were in one camp, they could transfer from one\ncamp to another camp so they can be with the family together.\nIt was a big improvement. We were free at least. We knew what\nwas freedom. I'm going to tell you about the food incident so\nyou'll know what the difference was when we finally got our\npapers to go to and come to the United States.\nWhen we came on the ship, the first thing we asked the fellows,\nthe Americans, Says when we get our coupons to get food, because\nwe always used all those years to get coupons to get food. He\nsays, don't worry, you're going to get enough to eat, but we\ncouldn't believe it. I remember the first dinner we had when\nthe ship went out. We were all sitting around the tables, and\nwe saw all the bread and all the stuff on the table, everybody\nfilled their packets up because we couldn't believe that there's\nso much, that there's food enough, that you can eat as much as\nyour heart desires. We had even a couple, an elder couple that\npassed away on the ship because they ate too much of the food\nthat they shouldn't have eaten. Even I remember myself after\nthe first meal I couldn't eat for maybe three days. I got sick,\nbecause we couldn't understand that there's so much food and\nhere we were going around hungry. Even the D.P. camps, we had\nenough food but we didn't have the food just satisfy yourself\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 38\nMay 3, 1995\nwhat you wanted to eat. You eat what they give you. They gave\nyou some soup. You had to go to the kitchen. You didn't cook\nyourself. You didn't have any facilities to cook. But things\nwere much better in the D.P. camps than in the camps -- I'm not\ntalking about Auschwitz. Auschwitz was just unbelievable. It's\nhard to describe. I remember when I lived through and I came\nhome and I told some people what I went through. At first I\ncouldn't talk about it. It took a long time until I could tell\nanybody what I went through, but the people couldn't believe\nthis. They couldn't believe that something like this happened,\nwhich I and Regina were just invited to the British Embassy to\nwatch a film and also to the Canadian Embassy to watch a film\nabout the survivors, the American and the Canadian, that were\nshot down over Germany. A lot of them instead of putting them\nin P.O.W. camps, they put them in Buchenwald and other camps.\nThere were a couple of Survivors, one American, one Canadian and\none British and I talked to them and they told me they came home\nand they told their parents what they went through in Buchenwald\nand their parents told them you're just telling stories. That\n1s impossible. This could not happen. Finally now, they tape\nthem in order to have their stories what they went through and\nlot of them are already very old. One of them told me that\nWalsh was his name he said his father couldn't even come because\nhe had a stroke. He wanted to come to the gathering that they\nhad about the film, but he couldn't come to it any more. So,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 39\nMay 3, 1995\nhis son was over there representing him. Those other things\nthat happened, not only the Jews, even the other nationals, the\nGentile people that were over there, the Americans and the\nEnglish, even when they told their stories nobody would believe\nthem when they told them what was going on in those camps.\nQ. In the beginning when you were in and people\nfrom a lot of other countries, did you mix with them or did the\nJews kind of stick with themselves?\nA. A lot of Ukrainians over there and we didn't feel very\ncomfortable with them because they were in charge with our\ncamps, of our labor camps and they all had to leave in order for\nus to get over there. We couldn't stay with them together.\nBecause people don't realize but they were our enemies not our\nfriends. They used to say they were in camps in Germany, but we\nknow what kind of camps they went into.\nQO. So, how did all of that work out?\nA. It worked that they had to ship them somewhere else. They\nhad a home to go back to but they didn't want to go home. They\nwere afraid to go home because they were collaborators with the\nGermans.\nQ. But initially at , they put you all together?\nA. That's right.\nQ. What else can you tell me about . Did\npeople work there? Did you live in barracks? Did you live in\napartments?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 40\nMay 3, 1995\nA. In we had little houses like semi detached\nhomes and usually you lived so many people ina home. In one\nhouse, for instance we had a little house and most of our\nrelatives from out of town that came to our town lived with us\nin the same house, but we already had for instance we had\nseparate rooms. Two people slept in a room, or three people\nslept in a room, because when we were in the Ghetto, we were a\nfamily of I had three sisters, a brother, myself and my parents,\nwe all had only one room, and the room wasn't too big. I don't\nknow if the room was ten feet by fifteen feet. We all slept in\none room. Some people had it even worse. It was more crowded\neven. We already, we figured we're lucky. The whole family\nstays together in one room. Some of them they put different\nfamilies together because it was very crowded. They didn't have\nany place for them. The Germans didn't care. They brought them\nin, you find a place for them where to go.\nQ. Did people work at the D.P camps? I know you did.\nA. Yes, a lot of them worked too. They worked for the\nJoint Distribution Committee but as far as other jobs\nlike working in trades or something, but the came in\nand the put up some schools to teach the people\ntrades. That was a very, very big help because a lot of them\ndon't like -- fix typewriters and other stuff and they came over\nhere to the United States and somewhere else and that's the\nbusiness that they went into. That's what they started doing\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal Al\nMay 3, 1995\nhere.\nQ. What about religion? Did that start coming back to people?\nTo you?\nA. To me it took a long time to come back, but to a lot of\npeople that were very religious and they had religion going on.\nThey didn't have those big temples like they have here, but they\nhad little rooms that they got together, but they celebrated\neither Passover or Rosh Hoshana, Yom Kippur. We celebrated\nthose holidays. There were some that didn't want to celebrate\nand you had some that were very religious and some were not so\nreligious.\nQ. What about you and religion?\nA. Myself? When I came back to Poland and I saw what was left\nfrom the whole family, for a while I thought why be Jewish. If\nGod could have been around to watch over us the things that were\ngoing on and not say anything, maybe there's nobody around here.\nFinally you know I'll get away from it. I don't look so Jewish.\nI was born here. I'll get away from it. There's not too many\nJews, but after the pogroms started again, I figured I cannot do\nthose things, because if I'm going to marry somebody and my kids\nare grown up, they might do the same thing what the people are\ndoing right now here. My religion is still better. I don't\nhave to be very, very religious but it's still better than any\nother religion that sided against it.\nQ. What do you think sustained you through all of these years?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 42\nMay 3, 1995\nWhy do you think you got through it?\nA. Not that I was smarter than anybody else. A lot had to do\nwith luck where you were, and what you were doing at a certain\ntime. A lot of times, even now, I think why me why nobody else\nfrom my family except me. I can't answer that question. What\nkept us together was because we were young, very, very young.\nThe older people that had more experiences and more knowledge\nabout life, a lot of them committed suicide or they couldn't put\nup with it. But we young ones, we kept each other going. Life\nwas just starting for us, and we figured that this has to come\nto an end. We knew that a war does not go on forever. And we\nalso promised each other that somebody has to stay alive to tell\nwhat was going on in that hell, what was really going on in\nthose camps and every where else. Who else is going to tell\nthem, because now the youngest one already is my age and in\nanother short time, there's very few of us going to be left,\nespecially witnesses that were over there. It's going to be\nhistory and history doesn't change around. They already deny\nit. You have a lot of revisionists that say that the Holocaust\ndid not happen. So, we feel, because we never talked about\nthose things, but we feel that now that we have to talk about\nthem in order to make people and especially the kids that those\nare the things that really happened. For instance last year I\nand Regina went with a group of kids, Jewish kids from all over\nthe world. We went on the March of . We went to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 43\nMay 3, 1995\nPoland. We took them to the concentration camps. Then we went\nto Israel. It's amazing what that did to the kids. At least\nthey know they talked to some of them that were really there and\nshowed them the places and what was going on in those\nconcentration camps. Because just talking to somebody about it,\nit doesn't bring out as much as you can really go to the place\nand witness and see what has been going on over there. A lot of\nthose kids, that knew very little about Judaism have changed\nquite a lot.\nQ. Over the last 50 years, I'm sure there are certain images\nthat come back to you a lot. Can you talk about any of them?\nA. Those images come back to me all the time. There's plenty\nof nights that I talk to people about them. I usually don't\ntalk about those things during the day, and I told I have to be\nbusy in order to forget those things, but I wake up in the\nmiddle of the night still seeing all those monstrosities and\neverything else. I can't talk about them a lot of times, but I\ncan see them and I feel them. I wake up ina sweat and it's\nvery hard for me to get back to sleep. If we get together with\nour friends that went through, that's all we talk about. We\ncan't talk about anything else. Thank God we have three\nchildren. We have seven grandchildren and I ask my kids, I said\nwhen you were younger when they were very little and they saw my\nnumber when they were two years, two and half, they asked me\nwhat is that number I used to tell them some bad people did it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 44\nMay 3, 1995\nto me. But later on they never asked us any questions because\nthey realized they heard us talk to our friends all the time,\nand they knew that something very bad happened to us during that\ntime. Even now, they tell us that's why we didn't want to ask\nyou about it. We knew what you went through but we didn't want\nto ask you about it. Even now, after 50 years, it's very, very\nhard to talk about it. But then we figured we have to establish\na new life when we came over here. We worked very hard. I\nworked seven days a week, 20 hours, as many hours as it took in\norder to build up what I did, and thank God it's a wonderful\ncountry. I wouldn't like to live anywhere else, and I\nappreciate everything that the United States did for me. And\nI'm paying taxes every year too, and I don't mind. They've been\nvery good to me here and since I came to the United States, I've\nworked mostly for the government. I did a lot of work -- I have\nclearance with the F.B.I., with the C.1.A., and I never forget\nwhen I came over to this country and I worked at\nand I worked at the and in the middle of the day,\none of the soldiers came over and took me up to and\nI got very scared. I thought I was in Germany again. They were\ngoing to send me away somewhere else, and I found out the reason\nI was taken off of the job was because I didn't have my\ncitizenship papers. I was not a citizen and it was a job in\nthose days was very secret and that I can't\nwork over there because I wasn't a citizen, but the minute I got\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 45\nMay 3, 1995\nmy citizen papers, I established back my credentials and I did\nnot have a problem. Work mostly on the ladder. I even did the\nin the White House when Nixon was making the\ntapes. We worked around the clock for 24 hours in order to get\nthe air conditioning and ventilation in the basement. I'm\nthankful for everything. I have a very nice family and I hope\nthat we stay well that I can do more what I want to do to help\nother people which is very, very important.\nQ. Is there anything else you want to add about those years?\nA. I don't want to go through the monstrosities to tell you\nwhat's going on too much. I get very, you know, I'm but if you\nhave any special questions you want to ask me that you want me\nto say about I'll be glad to answer.\nQ. You have to appreciate that someone, sometime might look at\nthis tape and say monstrosities, maybe they're going to want to\nknow more what that means?\nA. The only thing I can say that not all people are bad. They\nare some good people with the bad ones too. Even there were in\nconcentration camps, and I worked with a German that was running\nthe factory. It's true that he lost three sons in the war and\nhe didn't like Hitler too much either, but he always every day,\nhe knew what was going on, brought something in, like an apple\nsometime, a little piece of bread, but he told me don't take it\nuntil I go out from here, because if they catch me I'll be in\ntrouble, and he put it away at a certain place and then I left,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 46\nMay 3, 1995\nbefore I left I used to go out and get it and I used to come\nhome, you know, back to the barracks, I used to share it with my\nfriends. The fellow when were in the fellow that\nwas in charge of our barrack was a German by the name of Walter,\nand I found out that he killed his parents and they put him in\njail and then they put him in charge of us. I also found out\nlater that it was a homosexual which I didn't even know what a\nhomosexual really was when I was in camp in those days, but he\nalso had a girlfriend in the factory and he spoke German and she\nspoke only Polish and when he found out he took me to carry the\nletters from the factory back to camp from him to her because he\ncouldn't go out from camp. We went to work, but he stayed over\nthe whole day and took care of it, so usually when I came home\nat night he had this special soup for me which I shared with my\nfriends and this means almost difference between life and death,\nthis soup. And also, in the winter time it was very cold over\nthere, but because we worked in the train factory an the trains\nwere running on coal, so we made up that each man that came back\ntook a little piece of coal and put it in his pocket, very\nlittle piece, maybe a centimeter and half by centimeter and\nhalf, and when we came back to the barracks, we had a little\nbellie stove, a little iron stove and the fellow that was\nrunning, that Walter, the German that was running the camp\ndidn't mind and everybody threw the little piece of coal in that\nlittle stove and we had it a little bit warmer at night. We\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 47\nMay 3, 1995\nwere one of the lucky ones maybe. You had to help yourself a\nlittle. You couldn't take too much of that coal back, but a\nlittle piece, nobody noticed when you went through the gate and\ncoming in with it and that's how we kept warm at night in the\ncamp. I imagine that we're also lucky that they took us\ninstead of being in Auschwitz, because in\nAuschwitz you couldn't survive. The people that maybe survived\nthere because usually they came in they picked them to do\ncertain jobs, to take the clothes away when we came off they\ntook the clothes away from the people then they sorted the\nclothes, then they took the people, you know. If you were\npicked to do a job you couldn't help it. You took the people\nfrom the gas chambers and put them in the crematoriums and it\nwas people like us. You know, they picked them out and that's\nwhat you did. So, they use you as long as you could do it and\nif you got tired of doing it, they put you in the crematorium\nand picked somebody else to do it. So, it wasn't something like\njust -- in the camp that I was in they used to\nhang people every Sunday and everybody that did something bad,\nthey used to hang them on Sunday. They used to pick up people\nfrom the rolls after they stayed on that appeal in the morning\nand we used to hang them. They didn't do it themselves. Used\nto go out and put the thing on their neck, but you couldn't help\nit. Luckily I wasn't picked, but maybe if I would be picked I\nwould have to do the same thing. It was one of those things.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 48\nMay 3, 1995\nAnother thing in those camps, in Auschwitz Sunday when we didn't\ngo to work even if it was cold, we had to stay outside the hole\nday. They wouldn't let us go into the barracks and sit inside\nbecause we were going to make it dirty. The floors are going to\nbe dirty. We had to make our bed as much as we could every\nmorning and then you were sick you were afraid to go to the\ninfirmary because you knew what was going to happen to you.\nI'll never forget I cut myself once in my arm here, right here,\nand I was afraid to go, and I don't know what I did but I puta\npiece of rope on one side and on the other side and it just\nhealed up and I used to go to work, and I used to be sick. I\nused to get a sore throat and a fever. I used to go to work. I\nnever stayed in the barracks. I figured if I stay I know what's\ngoing to happen to me, so this way I just went through and when\nwe went home, walking, we used to hold tight, used to hold each\nother in to the ends and my friends if I couldn't go my friends\nwere dragging me in until we got in there. I used to take my\nfriends until we got back to camp, and that's how I survived.\nWe helped each other. If not we wouldn't be here. Even when I\nescaped, I'll never forget I can't even remember they said I was\nin the woods it was so bad, but we survived somehow. It's\namazing what a human being can stand when it happens. There was\nno place for us to escape because there was no body that helped\na Jew on the outside. Maybe in another country. Maybe in\nHolland or Belgium or France but not in Poland because most of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 49\nMay 3, 1995\nthe crematoriums were built in Poland. Even from the countries,\nthey brought them into Poland, like Birkenau, Auschwitz,\nMaidonek. Maidonek, iS a camp that still the Germans didn't\nhave time to destroy it and it's still, they can start up a\nration over there in two days if they had to. The crematoriums\nand everything is over there. That's why I took the march of\nthe living kids who went to Maidonek. It's not only the Jews\nthat got killed during the war. A lot of the RuSSian prisoners.\nWhen I was in there was a camp of Russian\nprisoners that they brought in. There was an American prison\ncamp too. They put them on the outside with a fence around it,\ndidn't feed them. They used to eat the grass from the ground.\nThey never put them to work, and they all died out, then they\ntook them to the crematoriums. So with us with\nthe Jews, he just wanted to get rid of all the Jews. You know\nin a war that you're going to have people that are going to get\nkilled, but the Jews were all together different. He just\nwanted to get rid of all of them. Take a whole nation and get\nrid of them. From what I understand ina lot of those camps, I\nhave an American that was in the camp and I\nworked with him after the war and he remembered me always used\nto have a lot of talks with me. He used to come over to me and\ntell me what was going on. He said, Sam, there are a lot of\npeople that may not believe you, but I know what you went\nthrough, because he was there himself.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 50\nMay 3, 1995\nQ.

        "Answer: My name is Samuel Spiegal. I was born in\n, Poland on August the 23rd, 1922. I had three\nmore sisters and a brother. I was the oldest one. We hada\nshoe factory at home, and my mother passed away in childbirth\nand I was four years old. Then my father remarried a year\nlater. We had a pretty normal living until the war broke out.\nI wouldn't say we were rich, but we were middle class. We lived\npretty nicely. Then when the war broke out in 1939 it was\nSeptember lst a bomb fell into the house. It was about 7:00 in\nthe morning and we were lucky to get out about five minutes\nbefore, and nobody got hurt. But, this was only the beginning\nbecause the minute the Germans came in, things started to get\nvery bad for us. It was September when school starts again, and\nJewish kids were not allowed to go to school anymore. But, the\nJewish community opened up some little Jewish schools that the\nkids went to so they can learn a little bit. In 1940, the\nmiddle of 1940, the Germans gave an order that we have to give\naway all the jewelry and all the furs that all the people had,\nand we gave everything away, but we thought it's a war, maybe\nthey need it and things are going to get a little bit better.\nThings started getting worse and by the end of 1941 they made\nthe Ghetto in our town.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfamily religious and also before the war did you mingle with\nPolish kids or did you feel any anti semitism?\nA. Before the war, I went to school, which was a public\nschool, but there were very few Jewish kids in our class of 55\nkids, there were about six Jewish kids. They must sit on one\nside, the left side of the class. Mostly it was a catholic\nschool and prayers were said every morning and every night\nbefore we went home from school. We just stood there, but the\nJewish kids didn't have to say the prayer. We mixed with the\nfriends that I had in school, but socially we hadn't mixed.\nSometimes when they needed some help, some school help, they\nused to come to my house, and I used to help them out a little\nbit, but otherwise, they had different friends and we had\ndifferent friends. Because I went to school from early in the\nmorning until about 2:00 in the afternoon. 2:00 we used to come\nhome and have our main meal. Then I used to go to a Jewish\nschool to learn religion. I usually didn't come home until\nabout 6:00 in the evening. Then, at night my father was very\nactive and designed this movement in those days, so I used to go\nto a Hebrew School which was called a Tabut, and that's usually\nhow my schooling was, because when the war broke out, I was\nabout 16 1/2 close to 17 years old.\nQ. So your family was religious and involved in Jewish\nactivity?\nA. Very involved, but I wouldn't say very religious, more like\nconservative.\nQ. He was involved in political organizations?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 3\nMay 3, 1995\nA. A little bit. I was younger. I don't remember exactly,\nbut I know he was involved in organizations quite a lot.\nQ. Did you ever experience any attacks or any --?\nA. Usually around Easter or Christmas time, the Jewish people\nused to be a little bit afraid and they used to lock their doors\nbecause what they preached mostly in the churches. When they\ncome home and they have a couple drinks or so, things were\npretty rough, but otherwise we didn't have any problems.\nQ. Were you aware of what was going on in Germany at this\npoint?\nA. No, we were aware very little of what was going on in\nGermany. Even when the Germans came in, we figured it's a war\nmaybe things are going to change a little bit, but they closed\nin every time, there came some new rules out and it got to be\nvery bad for the Jewish people.\nQ. How large was your town?\nA. Our town had about close to 10,000 population. 4,500 of it\nwere Jews, close to 50 percent.\nQ. Business and that was fairly integrated?\nA. Right.\nQ. Now, you told me when the Germans came into in your town\nand bomb fell on your house, what was going on?\nA. September the 1st?\nQ. Yes, what was happening?\nA. We ran out from the house, then we had to get another place\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 4\nMay 3, 1995\nto live. I think we moved in with our grandmother for a little\nwhile in a room just to stay until things straightened a little\nbit out. Then when they moved us in and we stayed there for a\nwhile, and I got sick in 1940, I had the typhus, and I was lucky\nthey put me away in a separate room and nobody found out about\nit, and I survived somehow the typhus. Then I worked for the\nJewish Community Center at home, because the Germans, when they\nmade the Ghetto, made like the Judenaut which was a self -- you\nknow the Jews governed themselves and I worked in the office\nover there for them, until I sent away to , to the\nSlave labor camp. Things got very bad in the Ghetto. There was\na lot of sickness, a lot of poverty. We didn't get enough food\nto eat to feed the people, but we helped each other as much as\nwe could as a community. Because we still lived in our own\nhomes, and we had some little things we could trade for food\nwith the farmers from the outside and I even had a paper that I\ncould go outside of the Ghetto, because I worked in the office\nand I worked in the labor department, in that section. I could\nsee what started going on and I was very, very upset with all\nthose things, and I figured that I couldn't stay over there too\nlong, and I decided to get out and when I went to to\nthe camp, this was before they took all the Jewish people out\nfrom our town. The fellow that took me out from there was an SS\nman by the name of . He said we have to go to\n, because there's a big ammunition factory and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 5\nMay 3, 1995\nwe'll have to send a lot of people over there to work. We have\nto go over and see how things are set up over there. When I\ncame over there, we went over there on a Thursday and he said\nMonday maybe we'll come back and he said Sam there's nothing to\ngo back anymore because all the Jewish people from your town\nwere taken away. That's how I stayed over there. All the time\nI was in for about two years.\nQ. Can you tell me a little bit more about the Ghetto, what\nyou all did? Was it closed in?\nA. It was closed in barbed wires. You couldn't go in, you\ncouldn't get out unless you had a special paper from the German\ngovernment. The SS used to come in every day to the Ghetto,\ntake people out to work, kill a lot of them while they were\ndoing it, and we even had a little hospital over there. A lot\nof people that got sick and had typhus, they took them out and\nthey shoot them, they killed them. Also, I remember when they\ncame in one day and this was in 1942 in the beginning, and they\nsaid they need about 25 men and 25 women because they had to\ntake them away to a factory somewhere to work. They took them\ninto a public bath house. They gave them a bath and they shaved\ntheir hair and everything else and they send them away. We\nfound out later that they took them away to a concentration camp\nthat they tried out the crematoriums on them. This was a try\nout. We couldn't believe that those things are happening, but\nlater on we found out that they were true. There was gas put\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 6\nMay 3, 1995\ninto the crematoriums. Life was very difficult in the Ghetto.\nYou couldn't do anything. There was no work. Nobody was\nworking except when the Germans took you out to work somewhere\non the outside, but you still used to come home at night and be\nwith your family. That was one good thing about it. You always\nhad hope. You figured it's a war, maybe the war 1S going to\nfinish tomorrow. Maybe things are going to change. We also\nfelt that we have to stick together in order to keep each other\nalive and maybe things are going to change a little bit.\nQO. What about activities in the Ghetto, cultural activities,\nreligion, your father's political --\nA. All cultural activities and everything stopped because the\nGermans were watching out that you couldn't do, you couldn't do\nthings, you know, you were lucky. You were afraid even to go\nout into the street during the day because they would catch you\nall the time and send you out to work and sometimes you didn't\neven know if you were going to come home, so usually you were\nhidden all the time as much as you could. They used to come in\nevery day to the Ghetto and do what they want to, anda lot of\npeople got killed. If they didn't like somebody, they just\nkilled them in the middle of the street. It didn't make any\ndifference.\nQO. Did you see that?\nA. Oh, sure, absolutely. I remember the name. He was a\nUkrainian, not really an SS, by the name of Schmitky, they used\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 7\nMay 3, 1995\nto call him. He was a very, very cruel man. He just came out.\nI remember right near our house there was a fellow, his name was\nLittman, Phil Littman was his name, and I remember he shot him\nright in front of our house. We were sitting inside. We were\nafraid even to go out. So those things were going on daily. It\nwas a daily occurrence. It wasn't new.\nQ. Did your father keep up any this organizing underground,\nthe Zionism?\nA. I couldn't say because I don't remember and I don't think\nso. It's true that they got together and they talked about\ncertain things, but very little could be done, because there was\nno help from the outside. In the Ghetto without help from the\noutside, it was very hard to organize anything, especially ina\nsmall town like ours.\nQ. Did you observe shobot, holidays, anything?\nA. We used to observe it in the way we could. I remember my\nmother used to light candles every Friday, but as far as the\nfood was concerned, we didn't have the food that we had before\nthe war. If you had a little piece of bread and some potatoes\nit was enough just to survive. I used to help a little bit\nbecause I worked in the Judenaut and I had maybe my portion a\nlittle bit more so I usually used to bring it home instead of\neating so I can help out the family a little bit.\nQ. Tell me a little about the Judenaut, how you got that job?\nA. The way I got the job was the fellow who was running the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 8\nMay 3, 1995\nJudenaut, was a very good friend of my father's, and that's how\nI got the job. It wasn't easy to get a job like this, because\nusually when you work for the Judenaut and you're over there and\nall the food and everything came in, you always had a little bit\nmore that you can have a little piece of bread more to eat, but\nIT usually didn't eat it myself. I brought it home, because I\nknew the rest of the family needed it more than I did, because\nthey didn't have any other means to get their food from.\nQ. What other privileges did you get from working there?\nA. The privileges that I had was that I wasn't called to work\nevery day, that I was at home, and I worked in the office, and I\nhad special papers that even I could walk outside of the Ghetto,\nif I had to go out for something. If you get out from the\nGhetto, because you mix with the Gentile people outside, you\ncould help yourself a little bit more.\nQ. Were you able to help your family by virtue of your\nposition other than the food?\nA. No, not much. I had a younger brother, which I send him\nout to work one time, which they worked at , and\nit was named , the firm. But what happened,\nthe day before they took all the Jews from our town, he came\nhome, the night before. He was caught in the transport and he\nwas taken away.\nQ. Was your Judenaut appointed by the local community or by\nthe Germans?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 9\nMay 3, 1995\nA. Mostly by the Germans. They picked one man, and then he\npicked everybody that he wanted to. Some people that he knew or\nwere close friends of his.\nQO. You hear stories about Judenauts and various communities.\nSome of them were very helpful to the community, some of them\nwere trying to save their own lives. How do you kind of assess\nhow your Judenaut operated?\nA. We knew it was a very difficult time. You have to\nunderstand what was going on in those days. You had to do what\nthe Germans wanted you to do. If they came in and saw the\nPresident of the Judenaut, I want 200 people tomorrow to work,\nyou had to be the one to supply those 200 people. So, you hada\nlot of people that didn't like you because, they said why take\nme? Why not take somebody else? You're put in the position\nthat if you do right or you do wrong, you're not right. I'm\nsure that you heard that , which was the President,\ncommitted suicide because he knew what was going on. Some\npeople were a little bit stronger and they didn't commit\nSuicide. They did what they had to do and they made a lot of\nenemies. In my opinion they really helped a lot of people, too.\nBut you don't remember the good things that people do, a lot of\npeople you remember the bad things what a lot of people do. I\ncouldn't say that I think most of them didn't want to do what\nthey did, but they had to do because they were forced to do,\nbecause if not, somebody else would do the thing, and they would\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 10\nMay 3, 1995\nlose their life.\nQ. Now, you worked in the labor department?\nA. Right. The labor department, for instance, the Germans\ncame in. They said we want 200 people tomorrow to go to work\ntomorrow morning, and we had to get out the names from the\nregister that we had, which people are going to go tomorrow and\nwhich people are going the next day. I worked in the office,\nyou know to go alphabetically, but I wasn't really the one who\nwent out and took the people out, who put them to work. I\nworked in the office.\nQO. But how were those choices made, which 200?\nA. They usually were made according the list that we had. The\nway the President of the Judenaut decided or the people on top\nof them. I was young. I was 17 years old. I didn't make the\nbig decisions. They said, listen, those people we don't want to\ngo, and those people we want to go, because you know there is\nalways somebody who is a little better off or have other people,\nand we were watching out that the people in the position to help\nother people they should stay in place to help them, instead of\nsending them out of town.\nQ. Can you give me any more ideas how they choose these 200\npeople versus another 200?\nA. Usually we try to take them according to alphabetical\norder, so we really, I don't think we made choices you know this\nperson 1S going to go and this person is not going to go. I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 11\nMay 3, 1995\nmentioned that there were certain people who were privileged.\nIf he had some in his family, you know, he didn't send them out\nto a certain job that was very hard. He picked them out to go\nto a job that was a little easier. I imagine everybody did the\nsame thing. If I could help some of my friends, I helped them.\nIf I could help somebody else.\nQO. Were there women in the Judenaut?\nA. No, not too many that I can remember.\nQ. Were you aware of any sort of manipulation of the Judenaut\ntoward other people because of their special power?\nA. I don't remember. There might have been in the higher\nechelon, but I wasn't in the higher echelon to be able to tell\nyou.\nQ. The Judenaut also took care of food and everything else?\nA. That's right. They used to dispense the food. They used\nto get it, and then divide it. The people used to have little\ncarts that you used to come to collect your food, once a week or\ntwice a week. We also had soup kitchens that we set up in order\nto help the people that didn't have a place to cook or couldn't\nhelp themselves.\nQ. Anything else about the Ghetto that you can think of?\nA. The Ghetto was very, very bad, and lot of people when they\nhad people who hardly had anything, if they heard about a good\njob that was outside, that the Germans took you away, they\nwanted to go because the Germans never told you that they were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 12\nMay 3, 1995\ngoing to take you to a concentration camp or somewhere else.\nThey said we have here, we need some people to send out the job.\nWe're going to take you and you're going to be living over there\nand you're going to be all right. So, a lot of people even went\nby themselves because they figured they would be better off than\nbeing in the Ghetto because the Ghetto was very bad. You didn't\nhave enough to eat and there was a lot of starvation and\nSickness going on. We didn't know really until later on what\nwas going on in the concentration camps, because even I, myself,\ndidn't believe until I got to Auschwitz that they're really\ngassing and burning people until I saw it myself.\nQ. So, you were already in 2\nA. Yes, in 1942 I was in , and I worked over\nthere in the building section. It was a very, very big place.\nWe lived right in the factory. It was like a whole city. It\nwas one of the largest ammunition factories in Poland. That's\nwhere I got to know my wife over there in 1942 because women and\nmen were in the same camp. We lived in separate barracks, but\nwe were in the same camp. The camp was really watched by a\nUkrainian. The Germans were in charge, but Ukrainians were\nwatching our camp. It was pretty tough over there, but we had a\nlittle bit more to eat. We worked but we mixed with other\nnationalities. The Polish people worked in the same factory.\nAt night time we used to come home and still see our friends and\neverybody else. We tried to help each other as much as we can.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 13\nMay 3, 1995\nLet's say, if somebody could bring a little piece out from the\noutside and he could share it somebody else, he usually shared\nit with somebody else. We found out after the war that the\nfellow that was in charge of our camp over there, he was a\nGerman by the name of Brant, that thanks to him, that labor camp\nwas a little bit better, that we didn't suffer as much as in\nother camps. He was caught after the war in the and\nhe was telling the things that he was doing for us. I know when\nthey took us away to Auschwitz, he went to Auschwitz and told\nthem that , we were very good workers and we know\nthe ammunition, that we worked in the ammunition factory, and\nthey should send us to work in the factories. They did. Very\nfew of our people, except the older ones were taken away to the\ncrematorium. The rest of us we got numbers and we were sent\naway to work. I wasn't in Auschwitz really too long. I was\nover there maybe three or four days. When we came to Auschwitz,\nby the old conductor trains, the wagon, the cattle trains, a lot\nof our people were dead, because we traveled -- I don't remember\nexactly if it took two days, or three days, or maybe four days,\nbut we didn't have any food. We didn't have any water. They\ndidn't give us anything. We didn't have any facilities even in\nthe wagons. When they opened up, a lot of people were dead, and\nbecause we were people that already came from another labor\ncamp, we didn't have any luggage with us, or any valuables.\nThey chased us out from there and we went through the showers,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 14\nMay 3, 1995\nand luckily it was showers and not gas. We came out from there\nand they numbered us and they put us in barracks. Then, people\ncame in from factories because the Germans, this was in 1944, a\nlot of the Germans went up on the front lines and they needed\npeople to replace them at their factories, so they needed\nworkers. So they came in from the factory, this is\nfrom the train factory and they said they need sheet metal men.\nI didn't have a trade, but I had a friend by the name of\nCoopersmith. He passed away, he survived and lived in\nCalifornia and they said Sam, when they ask for sheet metal men,\nwhy don't you pick up your hand and tell them you're sheet metal\nman. You're very handy, you'll go with me. We'll see that you\ndo something, but God's will they picked him and sent him to a\ncoal mine and they sent me into Germany to work in the train\nfactory. I came in over there, I didn't know the trade, I\ndidn't know what to do, but then I tried to take the broom and\nkeep the shop very clean, which it was a very big factory.\nThere was about 6,000 people working over there, but our section\nhad maybe 30 people working, 35, in the sheet metal section, and\nthere were three Germans that were running it, so because I kept\nthe place clean, so they figured everything is fine. They took\na liking to me. I learned a little bit of trade over there. By\nthe end of 1944 I think it was in November, when the United\nStates and the RusSians started progressing more on Germany, and\nthe Germans used to have their shops on the front lines in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 15\nMay 3, 1995\ntrains, and they bunked a lot of those trains, they brought a\nlot of our men to the train factory to be fixed. The soldiers\nthat were in those trains, came with them. They usually waited\nuntil the trains were fixed, so they put on another shift.\nBefore they put on another shift, the SS man came in. His name\nwas Fox. He said, each one he assigned us a train, a pullman to\ngo out and check on those pullman. I went out to mine because I\ndidn't know the train, but I knew how to write and read and I\nmade a plan of the train and I showed him where the damage was\nand what we're going to fix. When he came on and asked\neverybody what to do, he came to me and after I showed him\nthose, he says you're going to run the second shift. I couldn't\ntell the men. I took the bull by the horn. I figured listen I\nhad to take a chance because I had different nationals working\nunder me in the second shift. We went out to work, and we did\nthe job so fast that we got a little bit tobacco extra and I\nnever smoked. Usually everything I got, I shared it with the\npeople. They Knew that I didn't know the trade, but they\ncouldn't tell the men that I don't know it either as long as I\nwas put in charge, I was put in charge over the train. That's\nwhere I learned my trade. When I came to the United States,\nthat's the trade I went into, and I built up a shop in\nWashington DC and thank God I was very successful, and that's\nhow I made a living in the United States when I came over here.\nQO. I want to learn a little bit more detail about some of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 16\nMay 3, 1995\nthese camps, these labor camps. Your interaction with the other\npeople, with the guards, what your daily life was like?\nA. In concentration camp we didn't have any interaction with\nthe guards. You're very, very scared of them. I'm going to\ntell you an incident which happened to me. I worked in the\nsheet metal shop, and I used to make things out of little pieces\nof copper that I used to find, other things, some rings. I used\nto exchange them for little pieces of bread. I was called one\nday, and this was about the end of November 1944, and the men\ntook my number and usually every Sunday the persecutions were\ngoing on, because we didn't work. Anybody did something that\nthey didn't like, they used to hang them and then send them away\nto the crematoriums.\nQ. This 1S which camp?\nA. Auschwitz. And I already knew what was going to happen. I\nfigured my gosh how can I get out of it. I knew what was going\nto happen to me on Sunday because I was caught with materials\nthat , which means they are materials they use\nduring the war for war materials, because I used copper. So, I\nmade the decision that when the main commandment came out, we\nhad appeals every morning that we stayed out. I had to come\nbecause the Germans were very how do you say it -- they counted\nus almost all the time. I went out and I went down to the main\nman behind him and I told him that I was making something for\nhim for Christmas and it was taken away from me in the shop. I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 17\nMay 3, 1995\nsaid I don't mind that they took it away from me, but I said I\nworked for it for almost two weeks in order to have it for you\nas a present and I would like you to have it. It went away, I\nnever heard any thing more about it. They never called me. The\ncommander got to know me very well because we went out through\nthe gate a lot of times. He used to knock me on the shoulders\nwhen we went out. That's how I survived from going to the\ncrematoriums one time. We had to think sometimes. When the\nGhetto was liguidated, my whole family went to Treblinka, and\nthey all perished in the crematorium in Treblinka. That's what\nI found out at , a couple weeks later after I\nwas there. So, I was the only one from the whole family left,\nfrom the immediate family, but I had some friends that they\nbrought in from my town to , too, and they worked\nover there. So, we used to meet every day. I think in\nthere must have been about 2,000 or a little bit\nover 2,000 people over there working. Things were tough. We\ndidn't have enough to eat. There was sicknesses. I had two\nfriends by the name, one of them, that he was sick one of them\nwas and the other one was , and they\ntook them all out one day and they shot them all. They\nliguidated the whole hospital in . They took\neverything out. So, you can imagine how we felt. Things were\nvery bad. I had to get in to tell other monstrosities that were\ngoing on over there, but that's what they did. They took them\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 18\nMay 3, 1995\nall out and shot them at one day. Plus the other things that\nwere going on. We got beatings every day, coming in or going\nout. The food was very bad. We used to get a little piece of\nbread in the morning and we used to get little bit of soup at\nnight. But, like I told you, we tried to help each other in\norder to keep our things a little bit up. When we came to\nAuschwitz, it was altogether different. It was hard to believe\nwhat was going on over there. We could see the chimneys. We\ncould smell the smoke. We knew the people that were taken over\nthere. We were ones of the lucky ones. The minute we got out of\nthe wagons and they started chasing us and they gave us the\nnumbers on our arms, and they shaved us all together and then\nthey put us through a solution that we walked through. We\ndidn't even know. We were just like animals. You were chased\nand you didn't know what was going on to you at that time. Then\nthey put us in line and they came out and the doctors mingle and\nthe other ones were in white coats, and they look through and\none of them goes to this side, and one of them goes to this\nSide, and one to this side, and one to the other side. Now, I\nwas lucky that it was Birkenau, not really Auschwitz. This was\npart -- they called it Auschwitz II. Then them came to make the\nselections. When they made the selections and I was sent away\nin those first three days, that I was in Auschwitz three or four\ndays. I don't even remember. It's very hard for me to\nremember. We didn't do any work. We were sitting outside. It\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 19\nMay 3, 1995\nwas cold, it was wet and they wouldn't even let us get into\nbarracks until they came at night. Then we used to sleep with\n15 people on one , with a little bit of snow. I was\nglad to get out from there. When they brought us into\n, which was part of Auschwitz, it was the factory\nthat we went to, over there, because we worked with different\nnationalities and we worked in the factory with a lot of\nGermans, everybody had a different . We hada\nstraw sack with a little blanket. That's all we had. We slept\nwith about 200 people in one room. But they kept us a little\nbit cleaner. We had the laundry and the clothes that we were\nwearing the striped clothes. We had to change because in the\nfactory it was grease working around trains. We had to change.\nWe used to come home, and used to change the clothes and they\ngave us other clothes. But, we had selections every Sunday.\nThey looked us through, and if somebody didn't look so good,\nthey took them out and they send them away to the crematoriums.\nThey brought in other people to replace them. The food we got\nin the morning, you had to get up about 4:00 in the morning and\nwe stayed outside. They called it Appeal, that they counted us,\nevery morning, and if somebody was missing, we had to stay\noutside, cold or rain didn't make any difference until the men\nwere found. Because sometimes somebody died during the night\nand never even came out, or something happened, but we had to\nwait. And if they didn't count us, we didn't couldn't go to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 20\nMay 3, 1995\nwork until everything was counted. Then we had about five\nmiles, maybe four miles that we would have to walk from the camp\nto the factory. The music was playing near the gate where we\nwent out, and the music was playing at night when we came home.\nWe got a little piece of bread, about six of us got one pound of\nbread. The bread was made out, you could feel the straw inside\nthat you could hardly eat it, but we had to eat it because you\nhad to survive on something. We got a little bit, it was like\ntea. They said it was a special tea that was made that we drank\na little bit. Then in the middle of the day you got a little\nbit of soup which was mostly water. Then at night, when we came\nhome, either we got another little piece of soup or we got\nanother little piece of bread. This was our food for a whole\nday. Things were very, very bad, because a lot of people, we\ndidn't have enough food, they used to get diarrhea and they used\nto get sick. The minute you got sick a little bit, you were\ntaken out, and we alot of times when we went out to work and\nmaybe 2,000 people, and the men says I only want 1,800 back and\nby the time we got back, we had trucks behind us that they\nkilled off the rest of them. We just loaded on the truck the\nones that couldn't keep up with --you know, because we walked\nfrom the factory to the thing. The ones that couldn't keep up\nwith it, they killed them on the road, and they put them on the\ntrucks and then they took them away to the crematoriums. But we\ncouldn't help ourselves. We couldn't even escape because on the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 21\nMay 3, 1995\noutside there was nobody to help us. I had a friend that\nescaped from the trains when they took us on the trains and got\ninto the woods, and when he came back, he was taken to Treblinka\nat that time. His name was . %L'll never forget.\nHe came back, he said listen don't go on those trains because\nthey burn you over there and we thought that the man was crazy.\nWe didn't believe him. We said how can they tell living people\nand burn them especially you know in our days? And another\nthing that we couldn't understand it's as if the world would\nknow that those things would go on, we are taught that somebody\noutside must know because if they would know what was going on\nin here, they couldn't sit outside and not do anything about it.\nBut, we never got any help from the outside. When he was on the\noutside and was in the woods, he said he couldn't stay over\nthere because they wanted to kill him because\n, so he tried to get back and came back to our\ncamp in . This was in before they\ntook us on the trains. That man didn't live through. They took\nus on the trains to go to Auschwitz, because he was already on\nthose trains going to Treblinka one time, from ,\nfrom our town. He jumped the train from Auschwitz, and he was\nshot before he got -- no, before we got on the train, he ran\naway, and he was shot. But, when we came to Auschwitz, we\nrealized what the man told us was true, but we couldn't help\nourselves. Auschwitz, we had a lot of hope. We could see that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 22\nMay 3, 1995\nthis thing couldn't last on forever. But, it was very easy to\ncommit suicide. All you had to do was through yourself on the\nwires, because the wires were electric. They had 600 volts in\nthem. And a lot of people did it. But, if we found out that\nsomebody was very despondent and we felt that he was going to do\nsomething, we tried to talk to him and tell him listen, the\noutside world cannot sit like t his and watch what's going on\nhere and not do anything. It looks like the war is already\ncoming to an end. We knew little things what were going on\nbecause we didn't have any radios. We didn't have any papers,\nand nobody was telling us anything because even the Germans that\nworked with us in the factory were afraid to talk to us, because\nif they noticed that they talk to us too much, they took him\naway. They took them away, too. So, we tried to help each\nother as much as we could in order to survive. And thank God\nsome of us survived. When they took us out on the Death March -\nQ. Wait a minute, we haven't talked about the Death March yet\nSo we need to set that up.\nA. All right. One day, when we were , they came\nin and they said that they have to take us all out. They didn't\ntake us where we were going. We found out later that this was\nthe death march. We were only about 60 kilometers away from\nAuschwitz and all the people that were going met the same way.\nSo, they took us out one morning. It was snowing in January,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 23\nMay 3, 1995\nJanuary the 22nd. It was snowing and it was very cold outside\nbecause over there the temperature goes about 30 degrees below\nzero. We didn't have any clothes. We didn't have anything with\nus, and we marched because they didn't have any trains to put us\non, and anybody that couldn't keep up with the marchers were\nshot on the way. One night it was in January, I think it was\nthe 25th of January, they brought us to a camp in\n, which was a big factory. They brought us in all\nover there because the SS that were going with us, they had to\nrest a little bit too. So, we stayed over and in the middle of\nthe night they started shelling the factory. They woke us up\nabout 12:00, 1:00 in the morning. There might have been about\n60,000 of us over there because they brought them from all over.\nThey chased us out and I had a dream that night when I was\nsleeping, my mother came to me and said Sam, don't leave this\nplace and I had an argument with her. I told her listen, how\ncan I not leave. You know we're almost liberated. You see\nwhat's going on, but when they started chasing us, I forgot the\ndream. When I was near the gate to go out, I had two friends\nwith me, one was from my town, Weinberg was his name, and the\nother one was from . When we came to the gate, my\ndream came back to me and I figured, no I'm not going to go.\nI'm not going. So, the other one from my town, he didn't want\nto go with me. He said, Sam we're almost liberated I'm going\nout. I'm going where they chasing us to go. I said no, but the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 24\nMay 3, 1995\nother one, I took care of him. He was a little bit younger and\nI took care of him a lot in camp when I was there. So, I\nsmacked him in his face and I took him with me and I ran back\ninto the camp to the other side and there was a big hole. It\nwas a brick wall over there about three foot thick, and there\nwas a big hole in it that was made from one of the shells or\nsomething. I crawled out and there was a ravine and I rolled\ndown into the snow with them and we ran into the woods and we\nstayed over there for about eight days until the Russians came\nin. The Russians liberated us. If you asked me how I survived\nin those woods for eight days in that cold weather and\neverything else, I can hardly remember. I know we had frozen\ntoes and at night time we used to go out from the woods. In\nEurope they used to have to put away potatoes in the winter time\noutside and they used to cover them with sawdust and then have a\ndoor on the southside that they used to take the potatoes out.\nThe sun used to come out during the day, so we stole some of\nthose potatoes and we ate those raw potatoes and we had snow as\nwater. That's how we lived through until we survived from those\neight days. If you ask me to tell you anything about those\nthings, I couldn't. But there were some other people in the\nwoods too, when I was over there. I met a friend of mine, from\nmy town, that escaped too, at the same time, by the name of\nDavid Bay, and he lives now in Washington, D.C., and we're still\nvery close. We used to crawl one into the other one in order to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 25\nMay 3, 1995\nkeep us warm during the night until we got up the next morning.\nThen we used to run a little bit, you know, in order just to\nSurvive. Then from that time after, I walked home. It took me\nalmost about two weeks to get home because there was no\ntransportation. We could catch any transportation we could, and\nwhen I came home, -- so I was one of the ones who was liberated\nearly. Even when I came back to my town--the reason I went back\nwas because I thought maybe somebody from my family was alive\nstill. I couldn't believe that everybody was gone that was\nthere. There was no work, and no way to make a living, and I\ntold you before that one of my father's friend's daughter was\nalive. She was on the Gentile side. She was not ina\nconcentration camp. She was home already. I even got together\nwith her I told her I said Tasha, we are only about seven Jewish\npeople in the whole town that came back in those days when I was\nover there. Some of them even came from the Russian side\nalready or there were Gentile papers. I said we have to do\nsomething in order to make a living. I said I'm going to put\nthat flour mill back in operation. I did. I got the Gentile\nfellow, the machine shop, and we put it back in operation. We\nstarted -- the farmers used to bring in their corn, and we used\nto keep 50 percent for the making the flour and they used to\nkeep the other 50 percent. That's how me made a living in those\ndays. We have a little house over there. We remodeled a little\nbit and we moved in. I didn't know that Regina was alive still\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 26\nMay 3, 1995\nQ. We need to stop here a moment. First of all, I want you to\ntell me what it was like when you went back to your home town\nafter you were liberated. I mean you didn't go there and five\nminutes later you were a business man. What did you do? What\ndid you find?\nA. When I came back to town, the first thing, we left a lot of\nthings with a lot of people, with our neighbors. I couldn't get\nanything back, and I was afraid to get back because I figure\nwhen asking to give back they might do something to me. So, all\nthe Jewish people that came back, we moved into one of our\nhouses that my uncle used to have. And we stayed over there all\ntogether, and one of my cousin's survived too. She lives now in\nBelgium. So, we all lived over there for quite a while, maybe\nfor a couple, two or three months, but we had to go and get\nsomething to eat, because nobody gave us. We used to go to the\ngovernment, but they themselves didn't have too much, but at\nleast we had a little piece of bread to eat because we didn't\nneed the things like you know like we live over here now. If we\nhad a piece of bread and a couple potatoes, this was enough for\nus to eat. But we started to build up ourselves a little bit.\nBut, I got sick. I had to go to the hospital. I had the\ninfection. I was in the hospital for a little while, but when I\ncame out and I got together with my father's friend's daughter,\nwe decided that we had to do something. I didn't want to put it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 27\nMay 3, 1995\nup aS a business. I wanted to put it up so that we can make a\nliving and the farmers needed us too. The farmers were after us\nto put the flour mill back in operation because that was the\nonly flour mill around, maybe 50 miles around our community.\nThe only one.\nQ. How did your Polish neighbors treat you? Did they welcome\nyou back?\nA. Not really. I hate to say it, but even with the friends\nthat I went to school and everything else, I lived over there.\nI was born over there. My family lived over there for\ngenerations. I don't know how many generations, but the first\nguestion when they saw me \"You're still alive?\" But, things are\ndifferent now. I always tell them that I wish you would ask me\nif I lived in Holland, not in Poland. From the whole town, from\nthe 4,500 that we lived in, I think maybe close to a 100 are\nalive and not all went to concentration camps. A lot of them\nran away to Russia and they came back from Russia after the war.\nWe still get together even during the summer, we have sometimes\na gathering from our town that we get together, all of them\ntogether, to see how everything goes.\nQ. So, they weren't very kind to you when you got back?\nA. No, not too kind. And we had --I had to escape from there,\nbecause they started pogroms again. The pogroms started in\nand the day Regina came back she went to her town,\nand she went up to her apartment and knocked at the door to find\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 28\nMay 3, 1995\nout if some of her family may have come back. There was a\nfellow behind that said Regina run away because they just\nkilled . was a fellow that came\nback too from concentration camp, and they just killed him. So,\nshe went down from that apartment and she didn't have time to\nget into her apartment house, then she came back to my town.\nQ. Now, we haven't even discussed Regina, so people watching\nthe tape won't know who Regina is. You need to back track a\nlittle bit.\nA. In the beginning, I think I said that I met Regina in\nin 1942, and then when they took us on the\ntrain to Auschwitz before they took us off the trains we could\nsee what was going on. We made up that if we live through we're\ngoing to meet in , my little town, and get together\nover there. She was liberated in May, and when she came back to\nour town, was sometime June, but it's miraculous that she was\nliberated on the third day, she already knew that I was alive,\nbecause things were going on, the communication. She knew, she\nmet some people that says I already heard that Sam is alive and\nI was glad to hear too, and I was waiting for her to come back\nbecause I was the only one left from the whole family. She was\nthe only one left from the hole family.\nQ. I was wondering when you were talking about your fiance\ncoming to your town, did you think you'd see her again?\nA. I was hoping that I would because I knew I lost everybody\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 29\nMay 3, 1995\nelse, but I was very happy to hear that she was still alive\nbecause I found out. News traveled, and maybe I should get back\nfor someplace for her to come to, but we couldn't get married.\nWhat happens in the Jewish religion to get married you need ten\npeople to have a witness to have a . There weren't\nten Jews even there to get married, but we got together the ones\nthat were over there and we told them, that because she doesn't\nhave a place where to live and I don't, we're going to move in\ntogether and we're going to get married the minute we can get\nmarried.\nO. So, describe to me when she came, when you saw her?\nA. Oh, it's very I was one of the happiest people because I\nfigured she was the closest one to me, because I was with her\nfor almost two years in together, and in\nShe lived ina different barrack, and I lived ina\ndifferent barrack and one time I went over to visit her and one\nUkrainian took me out from a room and I got 25 lashes and I'll\nnever forget it, but it was worth it to see her.\nQ. You went to her barrack?\nA. Yes.\nQO. You went inside?\nA. Oh, sure. You could go in. We didn't live together in the\nsame barracks, but we lived in the same camp and the same camp\nyou could go and visit them. But if the Ukrainian, if he wasn't\na very nice fellow, he took you out and most of them were not\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 30\nMay 3, 1995\nnice and they just gave me a beating one of those times. He\nsaid it's too late, you should already be in your barrack not\nover here. Because I didn't have time to go when I got home\nfrom work anyhow. So, we knew in Poland that we couldn't stay\nover there no more. We'll have to leave this country. There's\nno place for Jews to live any more after what happened over\nthere. So, one day, when I found out what was going on and I\nhad a threat that they're trying to kill me so I went to the\nmayor of the town and I found out that he was one of the\nteachers that I used to go to school in my last years. His name\nwas Peshko. He was in the underground. He was in the\nunderground during the war. I went over to him and I told him\nMr. Peshko, I have to leave. I lived through Hitler and I don't\nneed this and I have to get a paper from you to get on the train\nbecause Russia was at that time in Poland and you couldn't just\ngo on a train any time you wanted to. So, he said, Sam I'm\ngoing to give you a paper because we're trying to have a\nout on and maybe you can get over\nthere. But when I got the paper I was afraid to take the train\nin my town because people knew me. So, Regina and I packed,\njust two sets of underwear ina little suitcase and I went out\nof town to another town to and took the train from\nover there. At that night we ended up on the Czechoslovakian\nborder. They went through and they checked your passports on\nthe Polish side. We went out from the train. We crawled under\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 31\nMay 3, 1995\nthe train on both sides. Went out to the Czechoslovakian train\nand so when the Asians went out from their trains we went\nupstairs and wind up in Czechoslovakia. When we came to\nCzechoslovakia we came to I think and then we went\nto Prague. We got off the -- we took a street car to get into\nthe town from the train and Regina thought that I had the little\nSuitcase and I thought she had the little suitcase and we left\nit on the streetcar. So, we came to town to the main it was a\nstation over there, a street car station, and I asked Regina do\nyou have the suitcase? No, do you have it? No. So, I asked\nthe fellow, we spoke a little bit Czechoslovakian because it's\nthe same language a little bit similar to Polish, he said you\nwait here. It takes about three quarters of an hour for the\nstreet car to come back and I'm sure the little suitcase is\ngoing to be on it. We waited over there for three quarters and\nwe had a little suitcase and we got it back, so we're lucky to\nget the two sets of underwear because we didn't have anything\nelse. But then they had the Jewish community over there\nalready. We stayed over there, we stayed in Czechoslovakia for\nmaybe a month, and then I decided we can't stay here either and\nI went back with Regina to the American zone in Germany and I\ncame to the D.P. camp in which was established at\nthis time. We were one of almost the first ones over there and\nI worked in that office too. I worked for the United Nations\nRelief Organization. I worked for the Joint Distribution\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 32\nMay 3, 1995\nCommittee. And the Joint Distribution made our wedding over\nthere. We got married over there. The wedding was in Munich,\ntook us to Munich. Then Regina got sick. Something was wrong\nand they took her to the hospital and they gave her some\nmedicine which didn't agree with her and she developed some kind\nof a blood -- something was wrong with her blood and a fellow\ncame in from the C.I.A, and American, by the name of Doctor\nAaron Mayer, asked what can I do for you. She said I don't need\nanything, the only thing she says I know I have an uncle in the\nUnited States that lived in New York, but I don't know where he\nlives but I know his name was . So, what he did,\nDoctor Aaron Mayer, he put an ad in the Jewish papers but the\nuncle didn't read the Jewish newspapers. He read the New York\nTimes. A lady from Washington D.C. by the name o Mrs. Freedman,\nused to work with her mother. Her mother used to have a dress\nshop in Poland, and she read the and she knew him\nfrom home and she called him up in New York and told him that\nthe niece of his is alive and was looking for him. The first\nthing we got from him was papers to come to the United States\nand they were signed by J. Edgar Hoover, because J. Edgar Hoover\nwas a friend of her uncle's. But we still couldn't come to the\nUnited States. It took us almost a year because in those days\nit was guarters and you just couldn't leave. So, we waited over\nthere but her uncle also at that time send us some money but we\nnever got it because he said it's not allowed for you to have\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 33\nMay 3, 1995\nany American money in those days, so they sent it back to the\nuncle. We found this out after the war. I was very friendly\nwith that Doctor Aaron Mayer and the C.I.A. and we used to come\ntogether and meet each other while we were in Germany.\nEnd of Tape 1\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 34\nMay 3, 1995\nTape 2\nA. We got those papers from her uncle, and it took us almost a\nyear before we could come over here, even with the papers being\nin order and everything else, but we moved from to\nbecause we found out one of the brothers was alive\nand he was in the American Army. He escaped during the war. He\nwent to England, then he got on a ship and came to the United\nStates and jumped ship. Then he joined the American Army and\nbecame a citizen and that's how he came back to Europe. Then\nwhen we found out he was in Regina says we might as\nwell move to so we can be closer to her brother.\nWe stayed over there until we came over to the United States.\nLet me tell you something about . When we came to\n, we were one of the first ones to come to the\nD.P. camp. There were a lot of other nationalities over there,\nbut they all had a home to go back to. They had relatives, but\nthe Jews didn't have any place to go back especially in Poland.\nThere homes were destroyed. No family left, and there was no\nplace for them to go back and live. Even at the border, the\nones that came back and started, they found out\nthere's no place for them to live. They had to come back. They\nhave to go back and it was a lucky thing that we have to thank\nPresident Eisenhower for opening up the borders and letting the\nJews from Poland come back in to West Germany. Also, a lot of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 35\nMay 3, 1995\nthe people that were in Russia somewhere else that they escaped\ndidn't have any place to go and they came to the D.P. camps in\nGermany. We stayed over there. In the beginning the place was\nalmost like a Ghetto too. We were closed in the camps. They\nhad soldiers outside watching us. We couldn't go out. We\ndidn't have freedom to move. So, finally, President Eisenhower\ngave an order to take the guards off that we can go free around\nand move to the towns that we want to so we could walk a little\nbit more out and everybody started to find out. Most of us\nwanted to go to Palestine in those days, but Palestine was not a\nstate and they couldn't take us. So, they had the ax of the\nship that they got, they took some of them in, but the rest of\nthem we had to stay over there, especially if you were married\nand you already have somebody those were the worst ones that\nthey wanted to take out in those days. They took out only the\nsmall children that were left. They figured that's the most\nimportant to get them out from Europe. The food in the camps\nwas not too bad, but they gave us rations but you know they said\nwe'll give you 1,300 calories but it depends what kind of food\nthey give us, the calories. It wasn't food that the people were\nused to it. So, President Eisenhower changed those things too.\nThen we started helping ourselves a little bit, and started\nworking a little bit and people started to find out where there\nfamilies are so they can leave because none of us wanted to stay\nin the D.P. camps, but we didn't have a place where to go. The\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 36\nMay 3, 1995\nUnited States wouldn't let us in in those days. Canada wouldn't\nlet us in. Australia wouldn't let us in. Go back to Poland,\nthe Polish Jewish couldn't go back to Poland any more. I was\nover there already back one time and I had to escape. So, we\nhad problems for quite a while. It's hard to understand what\nwas going on over there. With all those things, unless you're\nover there yourself you witness it, because it's impossible to\ntell what was going on in the concentration camps or even the\nSlave labor camps or even the D.P. camps. We still didn't have\nenough freedom in the D.P. camps until the end because we were\nstill controlled by the Americans what we can do and what we\ncannot do. President Eisenhower was a big help, and he really\ndid a lot for the D.P. camps, quite a lot.\nQ. Was it your sense that was well organized\nand well run and that people's needs were basically taken care\nof?\nA. Not in the beginning when I got in over the first time, but\nlater on it improved, because I worked in the office. I worked\nfor the and I was taking care of the registration.\nPeople that came in over there and then the was\ngetting some food out already for the people and they found out\nexactly what they need and what they want. We had a kitchen.\nAt least we had enough to fill our stomachs. We didn't have to\nwait until -- you still had to have cards to go and get your\nfood, like coupons. But we already had enough. They set up a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 37\nMay 3, 1995\nschool. If there were any children that came in, they could go\nto school, and we organized our own theaters and clubs so we can\ncome together and we can talk about. If a family was left, they\nfound out if you were in one camp, they could transfer from one\ncamp to another camp so they can be with the family together.\nIt was a big improvement. We were free at least. We knew what\nwas freedom. I'm going to tell you about the food incident so\nyou'll know what the difference was when we finally got our\npapers to go to and come to the United States.\nWhen we came on the ship, the first thing we asked the fellows,\nthe Americans, Says when we get our coupons to get food, because\nwe always used all those years to get coupons to get food. He\nsays, don't worry, you're going to get enough to eat, but we\ncouldn't believe it. I remember the first dinner we had when\nthe ship went out. We were all sitting around the tables, and\nwe saw all the bread and all the stuff on the table, everybody\nfilled their packets up because we couldn't believe that there's\nso much, that there's food enough, that you can eat as much as\nyour heart desires. We had even a couple, an elder couple that\npassed away on the ship because they ate too much of the food\nthat they shouldn't have eaten. Even I remember myself after\nthe first meal I couldn't eat for maybe three days. I got sick,\nbecause we couldn't understand that there's so much food and\nhere we were going around hungry. Even the D.P. camps, we had\nenough food but we didn't have the food just satisfy yourself\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 38\nMay 3, 1995\nwhat you wanted to eat. You eat what they give you. They gave\nyou some soup. You had to go to the kitchen. You didn't cook\nyourself. You didn't have any facilities to cook. But things\nwere much better in the D.P. camps than in the camps -- I'm not\ntalking about Auschwitz. Auschwitz was just unbelievable. It's\nhard to describe. I remember when I lived through and I came\nhome and I told some people what I went through. At first I\ncouldn't talk about it. It took a long time until I could tell\nanybody what I went through, but the people couldn't believe\nthis. They couldn't believe that something like this happened,\nwhich I and Regina were just invited to the British Embassy to\nwatch a film and also to the Canadian Embassy to watch a film\nabout the survivors, the American and the Canadian, that were\nshot down over Germany. A lot of them instead of putting them\nin P.O.W. camps, they put them in Buchenwald and other camps.\nThere were a couple of Survivors, one American, one Canadian and\none British and I talked to them and they told me they came home\nand they told their parents what they went through in Buchenwald\nand their parents told them you're just telling stories. That\n1s impossible. This could not happen. Finally now, they tape\nthem in order to have their stories what they went through and\nlot of them are already very old. One of them told me that\nWalsh was his name he said his father couldn't even come because\nhe had a stroke. He wanted to come to the gathering that they\nhad about the film, but he couldn't come to it any more. So,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 39\nMay 3, 1995\nhis son was over there representing him. Those other things\nthat happened, not only the Jews, even the other nationals, the\nGentile people that were over there, the Americans and the\nEnglish, even when they told their stories nobody would believe\nthem when they told them what was going on in those camps.\nQ. In the beginning when you were in and people\nfrom a lot of other countries, did you mix with them or did the\nJews kind of stick with themselves?\nA. A lot of Ukrainians over there and we didn't feel very\ncomfortable with them because they were in charge with our\ncamps, of our labor camps and they all had to leave in order for\nus to get over there. We couldn't stay with them together.\nBecause people don't realize but they were our enemies not our\nfriends. They used to say they were in camps in Germany, but we\nknow what kind of camps they went into.\nQO. So, how did all of that work out?\nA. It worked that they had to ship them somewhere else. They\nhad a home to go back to but they didn't want to go home. They\nwere afraid to go home because they were collaborators with the\nGermans.\nQ. But initially at , they put you all together?\nA. That's right.\nQ. What else can you tell me about . Did\npeople work there? Did you live in barracks? Did you live in\napartments?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 40\nMay 3, 1995\nA. In we had little houses like semi detached\nhomes and usually you lived so many people ina home. In one\nhouse, for instance we had a little house and most of our\nrelatives from out of town that came to our town lived with us\nin the same house, but we already had for instance we had\nseparate rooms. Two people slept in a room, or three people\nslept in a room, because when we were in the Ghetto, we were a\nfamily of I had three sisters, a brother, myself and my parents,\nwe all had only one room, and the room wasn't too big. I don't\nknow if the room was ten feet by fifteen feet. We all slept in\none room. Some people had it even worse. It was more crowded\neven. We already, we figured we're lucky. The whole family\nstays together in one room. Some of them they put different\nfamilies together because it was very crowded. They didn't have\nany place for them. The Germans didn't care. They brought them\nin, you find a place for them where to go.\nQ. Did people work at the D.P camps? I know you did.\nA. Yes, a lot of them worked too. They worked for the\nJoint Distribution Committee but as far as other jobs\nlike working in trades or something, but the came in\nand the put up some schools to teach the people\ntrades. That was a very, very big help because a lot of them\ndon't like -- fix typewriters and other stuff and they came over\nhere to the United States and somewhere else and that's the\nbusiness that they went into. That's what they started doing\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal Al\nMay 3, 1995\nhere.\nQ. What about religion? Did that start coming back to people?\nTo you?\nA. To me it took a long time to come back, but to a lot of\npeople that were very religious and they had religion going on.\nThey didn't have those big temples like they have here, but they\nhad little rooms that they got together, but they celebrated\neither Passover or Rosh Hoshana, Yom Kippur. We celebrated\nthose holidays. There were some that didn't want to celebrate\nand you had some that were very religious and some were not so\nreligious.\nQ. What about you and religion?\nA. Myself? When I came back to Poland and I saw what was left\nfrom the whole family, for a while I thought why be Jewish. If\nGod could have been around to watch over us the things that were\ngoing on and not say anything, maybe there's nobody around here.\nFinally you know I'll get away from it. I don't look so Jewish.\nI was born here. I'll get away from it. There's not too many\nJews, but after the pogroms started again, I figured I cannot do\nthose things, because if I'm going to marry somebody and my kids\nare grown up, they might do the same thing what the people are\ndoing right now here. My religion is still better. I don't\nhave to be very, very religious but it's still better than any\nother religion that sided against it.\nQ. What do you think sustained you through all of these years?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 42\nMay 3, 1995\nWhy do you think you got through it?\nA. Not that I was smarter than anybody else. A lot had to do\nwith luck where you were, and what you were doing at a certain\ntime. A lot of times, even now, I think why me why nobody else\nfrom my family except me. I can't answer that question. What\nkept us together was because we were young, very, very young.\nThe older people that had more experiences and more knowledge\nabout life, a lot of them committed suicide or they couldn't put\nup with it. But we young ones, we kept each other going. Life\nwas just starting for us, and we figured that this has to come\nto an end. We knew that a war does not go on forever. And we\nalso promised each other that somebody has to stay alive to tell\nwhat was going on in that hell, what was really going on in\nthose camps and every where else. Who else is going to tell\nthem, because now the youngest one already is my age and in\nanother short time, there's very few of us going to be left,\nespecially witnesses that were over there. It's going to be\nhistory and history doesn't change around. They already deny\nit. You have a lot of revisionists that say that the Holocaust\ndid not happen. So, we feel, because we never talked about\nthose things, but we feel that now that we have to talk about\nthem in order to make people and especially the kids that those\nare the things that really happened. For instance last year I\nand Regina went with a group of kids, Jewish kids from all over\nthe world. We went on the March of . We went to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 43\nMay 3, 1995\nPoland. We took them to the concentration camps. Then we went\nto Israel. It's amazing what that did to the kids. At least\nthey know they talked to some of them that were really there and\nshowed them the places and what was going on in those\nconcentration camps. Because just talking to somebody about it,\nit doesn't bring out as much as you can really go to the place\nand witness and see what has been going on over there. A lot of\nthose kids, that knew very little about Judaism have changed\nquite a lot.\nQ. Over the last 50 years, I'm sure there are certain images\nthat come back to you a lot. Can you talk about any of them?\nA. Those images come back to me all the time. There's plenty\nof nights that I talk to people about them. I usually don't\ntalk about those things during the day, and I told I have to be\nbusy in order to forget those things, but I wake up in the\nmiddle of the night still seeing all those monstrosities and\neverything else. I can't talk about them a lot of times, but I\ncan see them and I feel them. I wake up ina sweat and it's\nvery hard for me to get back to sleep. If we get together with\nour friends that went through, that's all we talk about. We\ncan't talk about anything else. Thank God we have three\nchildren. We have seven grandchildren and I ask my kids, I said\nwhen you were younger when they were very little and they saw my\nnumber when they were two years, two and half, they asked me\nwhat is that number I used to tell them some bad people did it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 44\nMay 3, 1995\nto me. But later on they never asked us any questions because\nthey realized they heard us talk to our friends all the time,\nand they knew that something very bad happened to us during that\ntime. Even now, they tell us that's why we didn't want to ask\nyou about it. We knew what you went through but we didn't want\nto ask you about it. Even now, after 50 years, it's very, very\nhard to talk about it. But then we figured we have to establish\na new life when we came over here. We worked very hard. I\nworked seven days a week, 20 hours, as many hours as it took in\norder to build up what I did, and thank God it's a wonderful\ncountry. I wouldn't like to live anywhere else, and I\nappreciate everything that the United States did for me. And\nI'm paying taxes every year too, and I don't mind. They've been\nvery good to me here and since I came to the United States, I've\nworked mostly for the government. I did a lot of work -- I have\nclearance with the F.B.I., with the C.1.A., and I never forget\nwhen I came over to this country and I worked at\nand I worked at the and in the middle of the day,\none of the soldiers came over and took me up to and\nI got very scared. I thought I was in Germany again. They were\ngoing to send me away somewhere else, and I found out the reason\nI was taken off of the job was because I didn't have my\ncitizenship papers. I was not a citizen and it was a job in\nthose days was very secret and that I can't\nwork over there because I wasn't a citizen, but the minute I got\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 45\nMay 3, 1995\nmy citizen papers, I established back my credentials and I did\nnot have a problem. Work mostly on the ladder. I even did the\nin the White House when Nixon was making the\ntapes. We worked around the clock for 24 hours in order to get\nthe air conditioning and ventilation in the basement. I'm\nthankful for everything. I have a very nice family and I hope\nthat we stay well that I can do more what I want to do to help\nother people which is very, very important.\nQ. Is there anything else you want to add about those years?\nA. I don't want to go through the monstrosities to tell you\nwhat's going on too much. I get very, you know, I'm but if you\nhave any special questions you want to ask me that you want me\nto say about I'll be glad to answer.\nQ. You have to appreciate that someone, sometime might look at\nthis tape and say monstrosities, maybe they're going to want to\nknow more what that means?\nA. The only thing I can say that not all people are bad. They\nare some good people with the bad ones too. Even there were in\nconcentration camps, and I worked with a German that was running\nthe factory. It's true that he lost three sons in the war and\nhe didn't like Hitler too much either, but he always every day,\nhe knew what was going on, brought something in, like an apple\nsometime, a little piece of bread, but he told me don't take it\nuntil I go out from here, because if they catch me I'll be in\ntrouble, and he put it away at a certain place and then I left,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 46\nMay 3, 1995\nbefore I left I used to go out and get it and I used to come\nhome, you know, back to the barracks, I used to share it with my\nfriends. The fellow when were in the fellow that\nwas in charge of our barrack was a German by the name of Walter,\nand I found out that he killed his parents and they put him in\njail and then they put him in charge of us. I also found out\nlater that it was a homosexual which I didn't even know what a\nhomosexual really was when I was in camp in those days, but he\nalso had a girlfriend in the factory and he spoke German and she\nspoke only Polish and when he found out he took me to carry the\nletters from the factory back to camp from him to her because he\ncouldn't go out from camp. We went to work, but he stayed over\nthe whole day and took care of it, so usually when I came home\nat night he had this special soup for me which I shared with my\nfriends and this means almost difference between life and death,\nthis soup. And also, in the winter time it was very cold over\nthere, but because we worked in the train factory an the trains\nwere running on coal, so we made up that each man that came back\ntook a little piece of coal and put it in his pocket, very\nlittle piece, maybe a centimeter and half by centimeter and\nhalf, and when we came back to the barracks, we had a little\nbellie stove, a little iron stove and the fellow that was\nrunning, that Walter, the German that was running the camp\ndidn't mind and everybody threw the little piece of coal in that\nlittle stove and we had it a little bit warmer at night. We\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 47\nMay 3, 1995\nwere one of the lucky ones maybe. You had to help yourself a\nlittle. You couldn't take too much of that coal back, but a\nlittle piece, nobody noticed when you went through the gate and\ncoming in with it and that's how we kept warm at night in the\ncamp. I imagine that we're also lucky that they took us\ninstead of being in Auschwitz, because in\nAuschwitz you couldn't survive. The people that maybe survived\nthere because usually they came in they picked them to do\ncertain jobs, to take the clothes away when we came off they\ntook the clothes away from the people then they sorted the\nclothes, then they took the people, you know. If you were\npicked to do a job you couldn't help it. You took the people\nfrom the gas chambers and put them in the crematoriums and it\nwas people like us. You know, they picked them out and that's\nwhat you did. So, they use you as long as you could do it and\nif you got tired of doing it, they put you in the crematorium\nand picked somebody else to do it. So, it wasn't something like\njust -- in the camp that I was in they used to\nhang people every Sunday and everybody that did something bad,\nthey used to hang them on Sunday. They used to pick up people\nfrom the rolls after they stayed on that appeal in the morning\nand we used to hang them. They didn't do it themselves. Used\nto go out and put the thing on their neck, but you couldn't help\nit. Luckily I wasn't picked, but maybe if I would be picked I\nwould have to do the same thing. It was one of those things.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 48\nMay 3, 1995\nAnother thing in those camps, in Auschwitz Sunday when we didn't\ngo to work even if it was cold, we had to stay outside the hole\nday. They wouldn't let us go into the barracks and sit inside\nbecause we were going to make it dirty. The floors are going to\nbe dirty. We had to make our bed as much as we could every\nmorning and then you were sick you were afraid to go to the\ninfirmary because you knew what was going to happen to you.\nI'll never forget I cut myself once in my arm here, right here,\nand I was afraid to go, and I don't know what I did but I puta\npiece of rope on one side and on the other side and it just\nhealed up and I used to go to work, and I used to be sick. I\nused to get a sore throat and a fever. I used to go to work. I\nnever stayed in the barracks. I figured if I stay I know what's\ngoing to happen to me, so this way I just went through and when\nwe went home, walking, we used to hold tight, used to hold each\nother in to the ends and my friends if I couldn't go my friends\nwere dragging me in until we got in there. I used to take my\nfriends until we got back to camp, and that's how I survived.\nWe helped each other. If not we wouldn't be here. Even when I\nescaped, I'll never forget I can't even remember they said I was\nin the woods it was so bad, but we survived somehow. It's\namazing what a human being can stand when it happens. There was\nno place for us to escape because there was no body that helped\na Jew on the outside. Maybe in another country. Maybe in\nHolland or Belgium or France but not in Poland because most of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 49\nMay 3, 1995\nthe crematoriums were built in Poland. Even from the countries,\nthey brought them into Poland, like Birkenau, Auschwitz,\nMaidonek. Maidonek, iS a camp that still the Germans didn't\nhave time to destroy it and it's still, they can start up a\nration over there in two days if they had to. The crematoriums\nand everything is over there. That's why I took the march of\nthe living kids who went to Maidonek. It's not only the Jews\nthat got killed during the war. A lot of the RuSSian prisoners.\nWhen I was in there was a camp of Russian\nprisoners that they brought in. There was an American prison\ncamp too. They put them on the outside with a fence around it,\ndidn't feed them. They used to eat the grass from the ground.\nThey never put them to work, and they all died out, then they\ntook them to the crematoriums. So with us with\nthe Jews, he just wanted to get rid of all the Jews. You know\nin a war that you're going to have people that are going to get\nkilled, but the Jews were all together different. He just\nwanted to get rid of all of them. Take a whole nation and get\nrid of them. From what I understand ina lot of those camps, I\nhave an American that was in the camp and I\nworked with him after the war and he remembered me always used\nto have a lot of talks with me. He used to come over to me and\ntell me what was going on. He said, Sam, there are a lot of\npeople that may not believe you, but I know what you went\nthrough, because he was there himself.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSam Spiegal 50\nMay 3, 1995\nQ.
