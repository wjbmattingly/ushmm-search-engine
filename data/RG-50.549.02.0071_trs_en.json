Even when I was in concentration camp, some people were nice to\nme. They even -- I tr -- you know, that I was step dancing. When I was in Landsberg in\nthe kid\u2019s concentration camp, I wa -- I couldn\u2019t eat, I couldn\u2019t sleep, I want to go ho -- to\nmine parents. I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t. And two girl -- my mother has two girlfriends who\nwere in concentration camp with me, too. So you can imagine I always run to them for\nthem to tell me something about my mother. And whenever they were talking about it,\nthey light up. They were -- because I -- she was -- she was wonderful. And -- and -- so I\nsaid to myself, what can I do? My -- my -- my mother always said to me, \u201cYou have to\nlive. You have to live. You have to do everything to live.\u201d So I remember I said, I don\u2019t\nhave any profession, I don\u2019t know anything, no skill, but I know how to dance and sing.\nAnd I was singing, and s-singing to me -- and -- and nobody saw me, you know. And\neverybody was think that I lost my mind, because if they would catch me, I would get\nsome beating. And that\u2019s how it start, and you know, it -- 1t went -- when you sing, when\nyou happy, it -- forgot the word -- it reflects on other people, yes? And everybody starts.\nWe had -- ha -- very bad time, it was horrible for us, although --",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- for people in the camp.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And other people are singing too, because they knew how to sing. And we\nsi -- we form a little group, so every -- when everyone had -- we had a little time, we\nwere singing and tap dancing for them. Even when I went to the holox -- Holocaust\nreunion, were people there who remembered those things.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And I was talking to a lady, and I look at her, and I talk to her, and she told me her\nname, and I didn\u2019t know who she was. And I told her my name, she kissed me and I\nkissed her back, but I didn\u2019t -- later when she said she was in the same concentration\ncamp I was -- you know, it\u2019s so many years, you don\u2019t want to -- you -- you -- you don\u2019t\nwant to remember all those bad things, but that -- it stays -- sticks with you.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: People said and -- it will go away. It doesn\u2019t go away. When it\u2019s good, we remember.\nWhen our baby\u2019s born, we remember. When I go to the cemetery sometimes, you know,\nbecause I sometimes do, put some flowers, I remember.",
        "Q: When you -- when you were in Landsberg, and then when you came to the United\nStates, were you looking for relatives during that time, and -- and --",
        "A: I knew that I don\u2019t have anybody. My husband didn\u2019t want to look for anybody,\nbecause he said -- people were telling us, they are going to think that you want money\nfrom them. But my husband had some relatives, I don\u2019t know where.",
        "Q: But you -- you knew that nobody had survived in your family?",
        "A: No, I knew. Because when I was in Poland, I was looking, too. I went to Krakow,\nthrough the rad -- on the rad -- I [indecipherable] through the radio, couldn\u2019t find\nanybody. Yeah.",
        "Q: What about -- you showed me the photograph --",

        "A: Not just, no, no, no. I didn\u2019t have his address, I didn\u2019t have anything. I don\u2019t -- I thinks\nmine husband wrote to Israel, to some -- to some place, and he got the address. Or -- no.\nNo, no, no. We had friends in Israel, and he called to mine -- to our friend, and mine\nfriend went to mine uncle. And I think this how it started.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I think so, but I -- we -- yeah, we have friends in Tel Aviv, yeah. And mine uncle was\nliving Banai breck, I think. So I had a uncle, and a aunt, but they are deceased. But I have\na cousin, I\u2019m very lucky to say.",
