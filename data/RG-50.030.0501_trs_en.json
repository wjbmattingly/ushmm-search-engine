        "A: On the road, on the road. So we go south, and there is a Protestant minister, he comes along\nwith a horse drawn carriage, and he seems to realize what goes on, and he invites my sister and\nmy mother on the cart, because he had room for two people. And he rides on a few miles, and --\nkilometers, and drops them off when he takes it off-road. We, in the meantime catch up with my\nmom and sister, and quickly walking, I\u2019m not sure how lo -- how far we walking, we must have\nwalked between eight and 10 miles.

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So the truck drove us for some distance, and had dropped us off. Along comes this so --\nyoung recruit, actually it was a civilian in a car, and he has orders to report to a certain area. So\nhe takes us on. We are driving down to Dole... Dijon, that area, and things got very hot. There\nwas a big tank -- gas tank, burning. I\u2019m not sure if the army had done it to destroy it, or if the\nGermans had machine-gunned it, but it was burning at night. That gave us a chance to drive at\nnight with, you know -- but at that point we run into traffic.",
        "Q: Mm\u2019?",
        "A: And got really hectic. If somebody run out of gas, or had a pa -- had a problem with his car,\nthe cars behind him stopped, pushed him off the road, with the people inside.",

And we got to [indecipherable], we got to Rouen, we got into a train, and oh, the\nd\u00e9mission gave us permission to go on any train, 1n any -- get any assistance from the military or\ncivilians.

And we say, oh gosh, they were\nmachine gunners.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They -- it was in front of our compartment, it was a flatbed with a machine gun, right, a\nFrench machine gun, and about three or four French soldiers. That was a bad situation because\ncivilians and military -- if you see troops there, you have a right to shoot at them.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: If you believe in the Geneva Convention that civilians are protected.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Then came the order, all civilians off the train. We are expecting an attack by Italian planes.\nSo we get out of the station. I think it was just a trick. The French authorities want to have the\ntrain to themselves to put more troops on there. We go outside of the station and there my father\nmeets a couple from Frankfurt -- he never knew -- I mean, he knew who they were, and they\ndidn\u2019t speak French. And they were -- then we -- we gave them, we talked to them. They owned\na movie -- a -- a movie 1-in Frankfurt, and my parents knew about that. So they said, what are\nyou doing here? They said, well, they\u2019re here from Belgium, they had escaped from Belgium,\nand they were completely lost. So my father decides, we are going back on the train now. And he\nsays, \u201cYou come with us, and don\u2019t say a word.\u201d There is a soldier there with a fixed bayonet to\nprevent people from going on. My father says, \u201cYou follow me.\u201d And we go by, he presents the\norder, and we walk right through. The soldier did not even have time to read it. He let us go by. I\nmean, my father bluffed him.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Get back on the train -- excuse me -- and then the train takes off.",
        "Q: When you saw this, were you surprised at how your father was acting, or was this --",

        "A: We got some coats later on, in Montpellier. But -- so we were there for about four or five days\nI believe, and [indecipherable] in the morning, get your breakfast -- breakfast. My brother and I\nwere designated to go in the kitchen to work peeling potatoes. So the guys already give us a little\nfood they throw on the side, you know. But that just lasted one time, one day.",
        "Q: You -- you were only in the kitchen for one day?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: It wa -- a few hours one day.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: But the -- the guys [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you take some stuff?",
        "A: Well, the guy gave us a few things, but --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- th-then [indecipherable] so then what happened is the camp commander let people go out\nsometimes if they had to go to see a dentist or a doctor or so.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: He gave them a permit for a few hours. While they were out in the city, in the village, that is\nto say, they sometimes were able to buy stuff for themselves or for other people, too.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they brought in food. That helped. If those -- if you had money, you could buy some\nstuff, you know. Well, when we realized that you could go out of certain -- on certain conditions,\nwe decided -- my father decided, let\u2019s see if we can go out completely, permanently. So he --\nthere was a -- a young lady in the cap -- captain\u2019s office, a st-stenographer. And my sister was\nwith her [indecipherable] in the same camp with the -- barrack with the woman, and she says,\nyou know, they need another s -- not stenographer, dactylo, a --a typist.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And w-why don\u2019t you apply for a job? So my s -- my sister said okay. So she applies for the\njob, and she was there a few days, my father says, you know, ask if I can go to a od -- to a -- the\nprefecture in Montpellier, to see the governor. Just like that.",
        "Q: Now let me ask you something. How did your father make contact with your sister, if you\nwere in different barracks?",
        "A: Wel -- we had -- we had visiting times.",
        "Q: There were visiting times?",
        "A: Yes. Ev -- every --",
        "Q: Every day, or no?",
        "A: No, every so often.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Within a few days, or maybe a few times 1n a week.",
        "Q: So your father is immediately thinking, how can I --",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2019m not going to be here, I\u2019m not going to stay here.",
        "Q: I\u2019m not going to stay here.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: I\u2019ve got to figure out a way to get out.",
        "A: Right. And -- at that time we did not know the 36 -- 1936 law.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So my father -- my -- my sister is performing very satisfactorily for her --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- captain, and my father says, \u201cAsk for permit to go to Montpellier,\u201d for her and him, because\nsh -- he didn\u2019t speak French. Captain says fine, but he had hostages there, my mom, and my\nbrother and me --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- so he was not afraid he was -- escape.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Fine, so they go to Montpellier, find out where the prefecture is, where the prefect\u2019s office is,\nand in the hallway, they\u2019re already down there and this man comes towards them, and they look\nat each other. The man says, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d That was Camille Ernst.",
        "Q: The man with whom your -- your father was the -- yeah.",
        "A: Partner before. Father says, \u201c\u201cWe\u2019re at camp in Agde.\u201d So he says, \u201cWhat? You are free.\u201d And\nhe releases us either way, and he says to my father, are there more people that you know -- and\nhe explained to my father what the story was with the 1936 law, but you were here before. So he\nsays, \u201cDo you know more people in the same situation that came before 1936 in the camp?\u201d Off\nthe top of his head my father had met people already in the camp, in the barrack, and he\nremembered -- thought of 36 people including us five.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And Ernst puts all the names down on the same list, he says they are all free. Then he says, \u201cI\nwant you to stay in the camp of Agde, and in the village of Agde.\u201d My father says \u201cWhy?\u201d He\nsays, \u201cI want you to help free all the people that can be freed from the camp.\u201d He was -- a hand\nto the heart. So my father says, \u201cWell, how can they po -- ho-how can they be freed? What does\nit need to be [indecipherable].\u201d He says, \u201cIf they have the means, they came -- first of all, they\nhave to be in France since before 1936. They have to have the resources to exist in France\nwithout falling in the charge of the French government.\u201d That was important.",
        "Q: And that was for a period of about a year, right?",
        "A: About a year, if I remember correctly.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And my father says, \u201cThat\u2019s nice. How about people who have no money?\u201d He says, \u201cWe\nwill find a way.\u201d And -- okay, so my father and my sister come back, my father sees -- become --\nright away I see him, he says, \u201cKeep your mouth shut, but we are free.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to cause\na panic in the -- in the barrack, you know, people getting all excited. And then he explains --",
        "Q: And did -- did Mr. Ernst give your father --",
        "A: A pass.",
        "Q: A pass. So if you would --",
        "A: What happened -- he gave them the list, the whole list actually, and -- had to be turned in o\nthe captain of the camp.",
        "Q: And how does Ernst have this power to do that? Do you understand that?",
        "A: He was in charge of the police. He was under the prefect, the second in charge. He wa -- his\ntitle was secretaire generale, and he looked at the -- looked from Dr. Zuco -- Zu --",
        "Q: Zuccotti?",
        "A: Yes, Zuccottt.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And [indecipherable] secretaire generale. Him, and then the other gentleman who was\nworking for him. Actually, everybody w-working for him. You know he reported to --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- governor -- excuse me -- Mr. Verdi -- Berdetti.",
        "Q: This was very emotional for you when your father came back and told you the story, yes?",
        "A: Yes, he says, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to cause a panic. H-He da -- spoke to the\nindividuals from the barrack who were going to be freed. There wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] they had\ntheir wives too, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Just fo --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But he called them up one at a time, and told them, keep your mouth shut, but you are free\ntomorrow, you'll get out. So the list was in the hands of the captain, an he issued individuals --\nindividual releases. That\u2019s why our release has a number of blanks, about four or five lines, but it\nwas actually a whole list of people. So he issued that for [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And the captain, Tass -- Tassart is his name?",
        "A: Tassart.",
        "Q: Tassart?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: N-N-No question?",
        "A: No question. Orders are orders.",
        "Q: Well, this is -- this is the orders and this is what he\u2019s going to do.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: So were peop -- were other people upset that you folks were leaving, or did they --",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: We did not tell, and the next morning we were -- we ready to go. That\u2019s where they found out\nthat the -- a few people ba -- not just us, but a few other ones --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- were released. And then they asked, how come they\u2019re released? Well, we came before\n1936.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That camp was a whole bunch of Spanish internees, because they came after \u201936. They had\nbeen interned because they -- lots of them were Communists --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And that the French didn\u2019t care for them [indecipherable]. Even though Germany became an\nally of the German -- of the Russians -- the Communists --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- the French did not -- didn\u2019t say [indecipherable].",
        "Q: The French didn\u2019t like the Communists?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: For Germans it was just an expedient to occupy part of fro -- Poland, you know. And so we\ntook the train and we -- somehow I guess we wound up in the Jewish organization, and we asked\nthem to help us find a place. And we ran out of funds at that time, because we could not go back\nto -- Alsace was occupied. The banks, everything had been seized.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we were running out of money. They helped us out there.",
        "Q: And where -- where did you go from Agde?",
        "A: In Montpellier.",
        "Q: You went back to Mo --",
        "A: Montpellier",
        "Q: Montpellier.",
        "A: Yes. To that Jewish organization. And they were helping all the refugees --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that was the funds from the Jewish organizations, from the United States. Then, we met\nsomebody over there, and we ask him if he knew where they had places for rent. And he says,\n\u201cYes, come with us. I live in Celleneuve,\u201d which is small village outside of Montpellier, we rode\nup a trolley car. Went over there, we found this home. It was not the fanciest place, it has a stable\nunderneath there, but hey, we lived there, that\u2019s it. So we stayed there for the first time, in ce --\nin Celleneuve, let\u2019s see. These people are from Belgium, and they lived in the same village.\nUnfortunately, they are on the -- okay, then, later on came ins-instructions to arrest the people, I\nthink it was in the s-summer of 1942. They had what they call razzias, r-a-z-z -- double z - 1-a-s,\nor rafles, r-a - one f - I-e-s. And they just came, gendarmes a-arrested -- no, they arrested at\ncertain cell blocks, homes. And they searched anybody in the street. If they see you walk into a\nhallway, they would hassle you, because they knew that you were trying to hide. So they check\nidentity [indecipherable]. Then the -- if they had the ideas that you came to France after \u00b036, they\ntook you in right away, arrested you. At that time, my father had connections with the boy\nscouts, the leader. He [indecipherable] in one of the books by Ann Latour, which was\n[indecipherable] here, was sold in the museum, and [indecipherable] name. Anyway, we found\nplaces for some of the people, hiding places.",
        "Q: Let me stop you for a moment. Aren\u2019t you forgetting the f -- your father and sister going back\nand forth into Agde?",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah. I --",
        "Q: This i -- this is a very big, important story, yes?",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. So, when he stayed in Agde, then he went to the camp commander,\nTassart, who helped him out, sort out who was there before 1936 --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- this was [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And my father approached him, he says, \u201cYou can be free if you meet certain requirements.\u201d\n1936, and means of -- of existing on the outside. \u201cBut,\u201d he says, \u201cyou must also help people who\nhave no funds. You must lend it to them, and they give back to you when they get out.\u201d Because\nthis was another of -- transaction outside the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So the -- okay, and my father was able to get about 1500 people out this way.",
        "Q: It\u2019s extraordinary story, you know. In how long a period of time was this go on? Months?",
        "A: It was -- oh yes, oh yes. It was from November to February or March, just before we went to\nMontpellier. This was --",
        "Q: So it\u2019s in --",
        "A: -- in Agde.",
        "Q: -- November of 1940.",

        "Q: To 41.",
        "A: About.",
        "Q: To February \u00b041.",
        "A: I believe so. Now what happened at that time -- so these people were free. The other thing\nhappened. Ernst told my father, you know, I suspect anybody -- somebody over here 1s writing\ndown the serial numbers of the bills.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So we became money launderers, we trade the bills so there was always constant new supply.",
        "Q: So who was doing the money laundering?",
        "A: My brother, my sister and me.",
        "Q: Your brother and your si -- the three of you.",
        "A: The three of us. Went to grocery stores, we went to banks. We -- or so -- we brought food into\nthe camp, too. So people gave us the money to buy food for them, and so we had a-an exchange\nalso.",
        "Q: Now, all of you had passes to go in and out.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "A: I have one here from my mom and my father. And the passport is for every day, seven days a\nweek. From eight o\u2019clock in the morning til seven o\u2019clock at night, that\u2019s 11 hours. That wa --",
        "Q: It\u2019s really rather extraordinary, but this happened in a number of places in France, I gather,\nthat people were able to get passes to go in and out [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t know about the other camps. I don\u2019t know, I --",
        "Q: But at least there.",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But this camp, because of Ernst, was very important.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I have the original pass with me.",
        "Q: Did your father see Ernst on a fairly regular basis, or not?",
        "A: Well, every time people were freed, they had to get to Montpellier. And so they were\naccompa -- accompanied by either my father, or my si -- [indecipherable] my father, my sister or\nmy sister [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. Because they had to go through [indecipherable] over there. They didn\u2019t had -- excuse\nme -- they couldn\u2019t send somebody to the camp.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then show the money [indecipherable], no, had to be [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right. But now, let me ask you something. When people didn\u2019t have money --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and the people who did have money would lend them the money --",
        "A: So they gave it to my sister --",
        "Q: -- then they leave, and then they gave it back.",
        "A: -- to take back.",
        "Q: Take it back so it can be used again.",
        "A: To [indecipherable] the list, and then --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- return the money to people.",
        "Q: But now these people leave, and they really don\u2019t have money. So now, how do they survive?",
        "A: Well, they went to Jewish Committee to help them out.",
        "Q: In Montpellier.",
        "A: Montpellier.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: That\u2019s where they were hiding, in Montpellier, at that point. So --",
        "Q: And then they were helped.",
        "A: They were helped, yes. Some had the visa to go to other countries, they had visa to go to\nPortugal. We have a very important pa -- place to go through it, to go to the United States.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Because if you had a visa from the United States, you had to go through port -- Spain or\nPortugal, and many people waited in Portugal for their American visas to come through.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So the Joint Distribution or other organizations helped them out monetarily to go to --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- these places.",
        "Q: Right. Were you folks frightened during this period or did you all feel very safe once you had\nthe pass?",
        "A: Well, as long as we knew Ernst, we felt very safe.",
        "Q: Then you -- then you felt safe.",
        "A: I forgot to say also, in those days they have also soup kitchen for all the refugees. Food, the --\neither the Red Cross or other organizations had food, they sit -- they u -- went to those places. So\nthe people who came out of the camp, and us too for awhile, ate in those places because we had\nno resources, you know?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: SO --",
        "Q: So your situation was not so terrible?",

        "Q: They couldn\u2019t bring it into the camp?",
        "A: No. By the way, it was where the camp [indecipherable] in there, there was someone, and we\nsuspect 1t was an American journalist that was there, and it was behind the barrier that\n[indecipherable] and the gendarmes were with him, so a few of us made a sign, \u201cNous avons\nfaim.\u201d We are hungry. We moved that towards him. The gendarmes [indecipherable] too close,\nand I hope he saw the sign.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t force us to go back.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Huh. All right, so 1500 people get -- how many people were in this camp to begin with, do\nyou have any idea?",
        "A: Thousands.",
        "Q: Thousands?",
        "A: Yes. I don\u2019t [indecipherable] thousands -- I\u2019d say probably between three and 4000, probably.\nThat means just the women --",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But then they got stuck, there with no ships to take them to Africa, so they put them in the\ncamp.",
        "Q: Now, how did people prove that they came to France before 1936? Did they -- or did --",
        "A: You -- you --",
        "Q: You have a -- you have an entrance pa --",

        "Q: So the people who came in after 1936 were stuck in the camp?",

        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so the camp commander, Tassart, said, \u201cWell, I'd like to send a delegation of the people\nto Rivesaltes to see how the conditions are, so they can convince the people in the camp that\nthings are not that bad over there the way [indecipherable].\u201d It was one of those, what do you call\nit? There was a Russian general who made fake visitors [indecipherable]",

        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: -- that they closed Agde and sent them to Rivesaltes, yes?",
        "A: Correct. I know of one of the people that went to -- like, it was part of the [indecipherable] it\nwas called Rubenstein. He was from Frankfurt and my parents knew him, and he had a son of\nour age, too. And he was wa -- allowed somehow to come to Montpellier [indecipherable] camp\nand he went to our house even, but he had to go back to the camp.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But he was one of the guys that was blindsided, I -- you know, just told him hey, it\u2019s so\nbeautiful over here, and they showed him the -- how many things that were favorable to show to\n-- to the French -- to the internees.",
        "Q: Right. Now, bef -- before we get to talking about you father, and y -- because of these razzias\nand their -- razzias and their picking up people.",

        "Q: Yes. And there you learned things that became important for you later, yes?",
        "A: Yes. First of all, I started as a mechanic\u2019s training. Forging -- iron forging -- forge is a French\nword, it\u2019s a -- what do you call it -- you know, where you process hot irons.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And where the [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then the -- and then I took the class in chemistry, my brother also. And that was very\ninteresting, it took a few months [indecipherable]. Exam was very strict.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "A: Because you might think it was from the Sorbonne [indecipherable] Paris [indecipherable]",

        "Q: I was going to say it\u2019s very practical chemistry",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: It\u2019s not theoretical.",
        "A: Yes, it -- the instructor was from Poland, and he was -- he trained us. He was a -- also a\nrefugee [indecipherable]. He -- I saw him in pa -- in -- in New York when I came back, when I\ncame over here. I looked him up in the phone book, and tried to get a job, and he took me to his\nchemistry factory in Bayonne, and they were -- offered me a job. They did not tell me what it\nwas, but when [indecipherable] and I says I wouldn\u2019t accept this job, they wouldn\u2019t pay\nanything, because the expenses would be higher traveling --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- than they would want to pay you.",
        "Q: Now why did you take this course in particular?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want to be idle --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- you know, and then the -- I also had the training in mechanical applications, they had the\nother course being taught the same time a -- the same time, later on, so 1t was good to continue.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I like it a lot, you know.",
        "Q: And when you\u2019re in Celleneuve, you -- you were Jew -- I mean, people knew that you were\nJewish, you weren't hiding the fact.",

        "Q: Once a day you went.",
        "A: We had -- you know, it was difficult. First of all we had to do the shopping, you had to carry\nas much as you could and besides, there was the matter of -- these people have money to buy\nanything, yo -- I mean, we were limited ourselves, so we could not actually -- that was not the\ncase though. The primary thing was, it was quite a distance to walk in the village, too, you know.",
        "Q: It was a big distance, yeah.",
        "A: And do the shopping, and carry it back, you know, it was a --",
        "Q: But the people inside the camp would give you money?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And would they ask you to get certain things, or --",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: They d -- they did.",

        "Q: And how did you decide who you would w-work --",
        "A: They asked us, you know?",
        "Q: They just asked you.",
        "A: Because this happened before. People went to -- had the authority to go to see a dentist or a\ndoctor, or so, and people asked them, would you please buy me this or that [indecipherable]",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So th-that already started before.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So for us it was just a matter of stepping in there and help them out too. We had been through\nthese horrible few days, and we were lucky, it was just a few days.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We felt very badly for those people. I mean, when you\u2019re hungry, it\u2019s a terrible feeling.",
        "Q: Right. So you felt responsible to do something.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: So how much -- how long a walk was it from the camp to the village?",
        "A: A few kilometers.",
        "Q: A few kilometers.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: And then when you go to the village you have to go to the -- the grocery stores, and you had\nto get from th-this end, that [indecipherable] different places, you know, so it took time.",
        "Q: Right. And you didn\u2019t have gloves, so it was very cold.",
        "A: Our hands were frozen. But we did not worry about that because we felt we had to do this.",
        "Q: Right. So it must have been exhausting both psychologically and physically for you folks.",
        "A: No, psychologically we felt we had to do it.",
        "Q: So this was --",
        "A: This was a must.",
        "Q: -- this was good. And this went on for a number of months?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Til about -- well, til about February or so, when they decide to close the camp.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s December, January, February, so it is a few months.",
        "A: Right, yes, it was a few months, yeah.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a lot.",
        "A: Oh we, you know, I have to -- yeah, we were staying in the [indecipherable] when they\ndecided to move the people to Rivesaltes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yes. And then they had to send a delegation to --",
        "Q: To -- to look at the fake part of the camp, yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But after they leave, do they -- do they close the camp in June of --",
        "A: I believe so.",
        "Q: In June of 1941 or \u201942?",
        "A: Oh, before.",

        "Q: February \u00b041.",
        "A: I believe in early -- yes, \u00b041, yes, uh-huh. It wasn\u2019t too many months after we left. I think this\nwas February, or something like [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So when you\u2019re at school, the ORT school --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- was that in \u201941 or \u201942, do you -- do you have a -- do you remember at all?",
        "A: Not exactly, but I have the certificate so I can --",
        "Q: Well, we can check.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But maybe it\u2019s \u00b042 that you\u2019re in this school.",
        "A: Well, because I went to different classes, I went to the mechanics.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I went to the other one. So the other one was about four or five months prior to the applied\nchemistry class.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: What a class that was, it was -- it was great.",
        "Q: It was great?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I learned an awful lot.",
        "Q: But you hadn\u2019t been to school for a few years now, right?",
        "A: Oh no.",
        "Q: So this was just --",
        "A: That wa -- that was th -- that was the end of it there.",
        "Q: Did you carry around your dictionary with you? Is that one of the things you took?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No, no. No.",
        "Q: No, huh? So it\u2019s good that you had all this dictionary training beforehand, yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So in July and August of 1942, they start these raids, the Germans --",
        "A: Ah, yes.",
        "Q: -- because they\u2019re occupying Vichy, no?",
        "A: No, this [indecipherable]",
        "Q: This is before?",
        "A: -- before that. Because I remember that they had some raids, or rafles [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and before that -- and we located places to hide.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: People to hide with, food. My father had this one friend of his who had a restaurant,\nTellenbaum, and he provided food. The boy scouts went to different donors or so, they collected\nthe food. They distributed it to the homes, not on a daily basis, because that would have attracted\nattention. So that every two days or three days, they will bring a supply for a few days, so as not\nto arouse the people there to see wha -- what goes on there, you know? They found abandoned\nhouses like that -- things like that. The best place to hide was hospitals.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: The food was available. You did not have to bring anything in. Doctors and nurses\ncooperated.",
        "Q: They did?",
        "A: They put people in beds, and we -- we were [indecipherable]. That was very -- these were --\nthese were doctors and Red Cross people and -- and nurses, these are not Jewish. Everybody\ncooperated. Not just -- not just --",
        "Q: But your father arranged all of this?",
        "A: Well, he got people -- connections, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But --",
        "Q: But he started it.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So he just keeps going with these ideas?",
        "A: Because we knew that people were going to be getting arrested, we had to hide them, you\nknow?",
        "Q: But weren\u2019t you vulnerable also? Or people just didn\u2019t know who you were?",
        "A: We weren\u2019t vulnerable because we knew Ernst. He was in charge of police.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: At that point. Now, the people that lived in the same village as we did, Celleneuve, the\ndaughter was arrested. And we tried to get her freed out, couldn\u2019t --",
        "Q: But you couldn\u2019t do it.",
        "A: -- couldn\u2019t [indecipherable] no. Then the pers -- the family hid us later on, too. This was\nbefore --",
        "Q: So s --",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: No, no, go ahead.",
        "A: This was before the Germans occupied southern France.",
        "Q: Okay. But in Celleneuve there seems to be a lot of help, the people are -- are willing to be\nvery helpful to the people who are vulnerable.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m talking about people who are French citizens basically, because they were not\nsubject to any persecution.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Because they were French citizens.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Th-They fall under \u201936 law -- 1936 law.",
        "Q: And because it\u2019s unoccupied at that point, they\u2019re not vulnerable.",
        "A: Correct, correct.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And so this goes on now for a few months?",
        "A: Yes, and then the razzias ended the end of -- by August or suppose -- early September, I\nbelieve, they stopped. Then the allies landed in North Africa on August -- on November eighth,\n1942. On November 11\" [indecipherable] Armistice day for World War I, the Germans invaded\nFrance, and then it was time to leave. So we go to prefecture, my father and my sister, and they\nas -- ask for false identification. He sends them to a place where a Catholic religious -- religious\nman -- I\u2019m not sure what they call that, it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s an order of the Catholic religion. And then they\nhad a period of time where the man -- the [indecipherable] had no contact with the outside. He\nsends my sister and me over there to ask for the false identification. We have about four pictures,\nI didn\u2019t have any of my mom at the time. We go there, and the abbey in Chanione d\u2019 Aussac,\nd\u2019Aussac, d\u2018A-u-s-s-a-c. He sees us, he opens the door, he says, for that purpose I am not going\nto go according [indecipherable] religion. This is important, he has to help us. Then he sends us\nto a mail drop, a Catholic library, to pick up the documents over there. The document -- the\nCatholic library was --",
        "Q: So he didn\u2019t know you were Jewish?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: He did?",
        "A: Oh yes, we -- we told him.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Because Ernst sent us to him.",
        "Q: Right, okay.",
        "A: I guess he must have called -- talk -- telephoned [indecipherable] first, because otherwise he\nwould never [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t take you, yeah.",
        "A: Right. And then they sent us to librarie Catholic, which is a mail drop for the social security\noffice service of the resistance. I didn\u2019t know that at the time. And di -- the people working\nalready against the Vichy government and against the Germans.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we go back and pick up the visa -- the cards over there, on the 11\" I believe, was the same\nday or the next day -- next day, probably. And then we take a train, and go to Nende, which is in\nthe Lozere mountains. [indecipherable] my father had met a gentleman from St-Germain-de-\nCalbert. And we had to go through Nende to go there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So, he says, well let\u2019s go to St-Germain-de-Calbert. We took a train to Nende, and we stayed\nin the refugee camp overnight, they have them all over the place, and at five o\u2019clock in the\nmorning, we walk out of camp, and go to the mils -- to the city, and there is a German soldier\nwith fixed bayonet, standing guard in front of a hotel, where the German officers was s-staying.\nWe got scared, I mean, you know.",
        "Q: And there were all of you, it\u2019s the five you walking.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Is he going to ask for our papers or what, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well, he was just watching the hotel, it was al -- his job, so we walk by, we go to the railroad\nstation, and from the railroad station we go to the Col de Jalcreste, J-a-l-c-r-e-s-t-e. Acor -- 1t was\nactually a -- a valley, like a valley.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And there was a chauffeur, a fellow who did transportation for people, like a taxi, but actually\nis a [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Right. And he takes us to St-Germain-de-Calbert. We meet the friend of my father, and he\nfinds a place for us to stay, we rent th-the place.",
        "Q: And the German, you\u2019re bypassing the German altogether.",
        "A: Yes, they are not in [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they are just on main highway, in Nende, and [indecipherable]. And well, you know,\nnext day, gendarmes come to the door.",
        "Q: The next day?",
        "A: Are be -- juif? Are you Jewish? Said no. He said, Catholic? Are you Catholic? I said yes.\n[indecipherable], you know, but [indecipherable] as long as they had orders to record the\nentrance of any non-resident and see if they are Jewish. It was the 1936 laws there, misapplied. I\nmean, they -- they went on further than -- than [indecipherable] for anybody. So I didn\u2019t walk\naway --",
        "Q: Did your papers say that you were Jewish?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: I mean not Jewish, Catholic?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t say anything?",
        "A: No. The papers we had, and I think I sent you copies with those cards. No, there\u2019s just a -- the\nbirthdate, birthplace, and --",
        "Q: And your name then was --",
        "A: Heberg\u00e9.",
        "Q: Heberg\u00e9e.",
        "A: Heberg\u00e9. Iberger, depending on the -- who asks, you know.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: My parents say Iberger, we say Heberg\u00e9. But --",
        "Q: Okay, so now you\u2019re Catholic.",
        "A: Yes. And we, you know [indecipherable] in the village. We stay -- first of all we stayed in the\nhotel, Hotel Martin, that\u2019s in Poland, because that hotel had an annex, we stayed in the annex.\nThe hotel itself was already occupied. And he was hiding, we didn't know at the time, 24 Jewish\npeople, plus about six or seven other ones who were foreigners, Armenians and other\nnationalities. They were not hiding from the Germans at the time, but were just hiding from the\nFrench [indecipherable] I guess.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: But -- so anyway, then we [indecipherable] the sequence. I -- I guess we get to meet people\nover there. There was a shoemaker who had the sewing machine -- no, no, the -- the -- we were\nlooking for food, to buy food. Well, we had some money and [indecipherable] and some\nsilverware and a -- a tablecloth. And they told me that I could probably get food on those items if\nI go to a farm on the other side of the hill, on the mountain. Chateau de Cremat, C-r-e-m-a-t. I go\nover there and the lady is very nice, and I says, \u201cI came to get some food from you. I do not have\nmuch money, but I can give you some merchandise in trade.\u201d And she said, \u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d And I\nshowed her our silverware. Yes, she\u2019s interested. I show her the tablecloth, she\u2019s interested. You\nknow, before, they were poor, the farms, had not much money to buy those things, and now they\nhave food when people need it, they can get more money, so now they have money to buy things",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- or for trade. It was great. So I brought home some pate\u00e9 de fois gras. They had pigs, they\nslaughtered since war, a-and geese, so it was great. And my parents were really surprised that I\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: I would imagine.",
        "A: -- so well. I don\u2019t know how -- how I became the -- the shopper for my fa -- family.",
        "Q: Right, right. And besides pat\u00e9, what did you bring?",
        "A: Let\u2019s see, pat\u00e9, potatoes and vegetables, and --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- like th-that.",
        "Q: So the pat\u00e9 was a -- a big luxury.",
        "A: Was the main thing, yes. But -- it certainly was.",

        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: A shower? You have toilet?",
        "A: Yes. They had about 20 some rooms, and the main hotel was all occupied, and so we had the\noverfill.",
        "Q: So you --",

        "A: In -- in -- in --",
        "Q: -- in the main hotel?",
        "A: -- in -- in the main hotel, yes. They are the ones that occupied most of the rooms\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So we -- we met all the people, because the one that we knew had already met most of them,\nbut we never admitted who we were. It was obvious we knew each other --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- we knew who we were --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and we had common sense not to mention anything or discuss anything. So I -- I --",
        "Q: So it\u2019s clearly very dangerous at this point, because the Germans can go anywhere, they ha --\nthey\u2019re occupying --",
        "A: We thought too busy occupy --",
        "Q: Other places?",
        "A: -- other places, yes, the -- the coast -- coastline because the allies had landed in southern\nFrance --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- the coastline. So Montpellier, Nieme, those places were more vulnerable, you know, for --\nfor people.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because they ordered certain areas evacuated, no civilians could live there, too. So it was --\nbut we were quite a ways from the coast. This was our luck.",
        "Q: So do you sort of settle down and you now have to get work in order to be able to eat, yes?",
        "A: Yes. I-I am not sure exactly when it started, but I found a job with my father to cut down\ntrees, which were used for the coal mines as support, you know, they have a --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- so the miners can work in -- under there.",
        "Q: So these are big logs that you\u2019re working with, yes.",
        "A: Pi -- big pine trees. And we had to cut down 12, our quota. 12 pine trees a two -- for two of\nus.",
        "Q: 12 a day for each of you?",
        "A: No, two of them, for both of us. Remove the branches, remove the bark.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: We had a big, long stick with a -- a knife, to remove the bark. And, you know, it was a -- a --\ntrying to saw the tree down with -- we use an ax to make a cut in the tree, a vee shaped ax.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then take the hacksaw -- the -- the -- a big, two man saw, cut the other side and make\nsure the tree falls o-on the right s -- o-on the side not [indecipherable |",
        "Q: So you ha -- you have to do it on the right side, otherwise you\u2019re in big trouble, right?",
        "A: Right. And that was quite heavy work.",
        "Q: Now, where was your brother? You were --",
        "A: He was working in the farm where I had the -- made the exchange for the food.",
        "Q: I see. So you and your father got the heavy work.",
        "A: We were lucky, because there we got paid. On the other side he -- he just got so-some food,\nyou know.",
        "Q: He got some food, but he didn\u2019t get paid?",
        "A: He got the food for the work for himself and very little to -- to take home.",
        "Q: And where is your sister and your mother at this point?",
        "A: My sister went to work in a -- in the Catholic lady who had the garden. Now, this could have\nbeen a problem. What happened, she was very religious and she asked my sister for a baptism\npaper. My sister says, well, we are in Alsace, we don\u2019t have anything here [indecipherable].\nThere is no way for us to get it now.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That was [indecipherable] likely.",
        "Q: And that was okay?",
        "A: Boy, but she was really strict on -- on -- on that, because she would have a -- a Catholic\nperson working there.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: The -- my mom was home most of the time. And we used to go someplace out, my father and\nI, to harvest mushrooms after rain.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know much about the mushrooms, but we [indecipherable] people, and the tourists\ntake only one type, it\u2019s an orange type. And if you go take this only, you won\u2019t go wrong.\n[indecipherable] get poisoned. So we did that.",
        "Q: And did you do that in order to sell these mushrooms?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: To -- just to eat them?",
        "A: I had -- I had food, you know, on the table.",
        "Q: And your mother wa -- your mother was doing the cooking, I gather.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And you know what? She was terrific. She always knew we did not have enough food, she\nsays, here is little more, here, this. I said, \u201cBut it\u2019s your food, don\u2019t.\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not\nhungry.\u201d You know how mothers are. You will say no?",
        "Q: So she -- she didn\u2019t eat as much as she could have, yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you see her lose weight?",
        "A: We all lost weight [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You di -- you all lost weight.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But you know, it was terrible, because we didn't want to take her food.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We were hungry and we knew that she was hungry too, so we tried to refuse as much as\npossible.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But she always said, no, take this one, spoonful of this one.",
        "Q: Hm. Fred, tell me something. What were you hearing about what was happening outside of\nFrance? Were you hearing about killing centers, were you hearing about shooting -- you",
        "A: No -- oh. That was ki -- we didn\u2019t know until after the war.",
        "Q: -- you didn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t know until after. Nothing",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You just knew that the Germans were after the Jews, but you didn\u2019t know why, what they\nwere doing?",
        "A: No, [indecipherable] not, no. We knew only they were arresting them, they were putting them\nin camps, resettling them in the towns, the whatnot.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: [indecipherable] be able to do anything.",
        "Q: So no rumors came to you, nothing?",
        "A: No, nothing at all. Not even I guess in the rest of France. We were [indecipherable] we never\nheard about it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the rest of France didn\u2019t hear about it, either. Because they said that we are going to\nrepay them for country -- for [indecipherable] land.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, for food [indecipherable] different jobs and whatnot.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s all. So I suppose in some way it was fortunate that you didn\u2019t know anything.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Because your spirits would not -- so de -- as depressed as it might have been.",
        "A: Oh no, right. I mean, we -- we knew we could -- we had to avoid them because of what they\ndid to -- to my uncles, they killed them, yeah. Although we did not know about the second one,\nhe -- we -- we -- he wasn\u2019t at camp when we left.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we didn\u2019t know about what happened to him. But there was shoemaker in town, and he\nhad the sewing machine, so it broke down, so my father offered to fix it for him. Then he said,\nyou know, I got some blankets, I would like to make some pants on it. And the guy\n[indecipherable] sew pants -- pants. And then they traded it for food for the farmer.",
        "Q: So how did your father have all these skills? All of a sudden he\u2019s making pants? He\u2019d never\ndone that be --",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t have to be fancy, it was for a farmer who was working the fields.",
        "Q: Well still, but I have to tell you that if you gave me a sewing machine and material, I don\u2019t\nthink I could sew a pair of pants. Could you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Do you know what I mean?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So your father --",
        "A: Yeah, he did.",
        "Q: He did.",
        "A: He did. And he traded it for food. And I told you about the tobacco exchange.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That lady was so grateful because soap was also rationed, it was hard to get.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And now she could wash the floors and -- and all that. She was so happy.",
        "Q: Were you able to make soap for people?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I for -- just for her I did.",
        "Q: Just for this --",
        "A: Because you need other stuff, you need [indecipherable] you needed sodium, you needed\nsodium, potassium, all kinds of minerals, you need also an indicator of the -- if it\u2019s a si -- acidic\nor -- or [indecipherable] whatever, you know, it\u2019s -- the paper.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I forgot what it\u2019s called now.",
        "Q: And so who -- to -- for whom were you making this soap?",
        "A: Just for that one lady.",
        "Q: And who was that?",
        "A: She owned the tobacco shop.",
        "Q: Ah, she owned the toba -- and she would exchange it for tobacco, and then you would go and\nexchange the tobacco --",
        "A: For food.",
        "Q: For food.",
        "A: Because tobacco was rationed too.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But she somehow had connections where she had more than just rations. And she had plenty\nin reserve too, because they were all appo -- supposedly si -- report, it said the instruction on\nhand. I\u2019m sure she had enough, so had more than she needed.",
        "Q: Did other people find out that you were making soap?",
        "A: She mentioned something about I\u2019m making soap, and she [indecipherable] that was an\nexchange of tobacco.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want the police to find out either.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The gendarmes.",
        "Q: But -- but your class was very helpful then?",
        "A: Absolutely. It saved our necks. I mean, we had food for whatever time that we had food, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Right. So how hungry were you, Fred?",
        "A: Very, very, very much.",
        "Q: You were very hungry.",
        "A: Very much. Absolutely. The rations that you get officially, were very small.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We had maybe a half a pound of bread a day, I think it was half pound or a quarter of a pound\nof bread a day. And you had a half of pound of sugar for the whole month.",
        "Q: Per person?",
        "A: Per person. It wasn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think it was even a half a pound. Or maybe a quarter of a\npound. It was a very little, it -- it was o -- small cubes [indecipherable]. Oil was very rare. You\nwere entitled to it but you wouldn\u2019t get it, because it was not available. Milk was only for\nchildren and babies, you know. Coffee was ersatz coffee, not very tasty.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Re -- well, now the main thing we did especially, we went to farms and bought vegetables,\ncarrots, rutabaga.",
        "Q: Rutabaga.",
        "A: [indecipherable] I never see one, too soon. [indecipherable] like Jerusalem artichokes.",
        "Q: Artichokes?",
        "A: But th-they call them something else over there. And it was a different sh -- shape, it was a --\nthis is -- looks almost like over here, but 1t was not the same thing. But the rutabaga -- the\nrutabaga, that was terrible.",
        "Q: So when you say they were -- they were rationing, that means that everybody in the area was\npresumably going to get the same food, am I right?",
        "A: Yes, except those who grew their own, farmers.",
        "Q: Had more.",
        "A: Had more.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Those -- the trade they did with the -- the same thing, trading, you know. I had the --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- the cousins -- their cousins and [indecipherable] and what that they -- they [indecipherable |\nfor them, you know.",
        "Q: So if you were good at trading, you had more.",
        "A: If you had more to trade with.",
        "Q: If -- and if you had more to trade with, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But most people -- would you say that most people were really suffering during this period?",
        "A: Not those people there, no. The refugees, yes. The local people had the chicken, they had the\neggs.",
        "Q: So they had enough.",
        "A: They have surely enough, they had a small garden --",
        "Q: So it was the refugees.",
        "A: Yeah, and then next thing is -- is that you had big black market going on too. So the people\ncame from the towns, bought things at high prices, raised the prices for us too.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we couldn\u2019t afford it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Now there\u2019s one interesting thing happened, it was one of the underground movements, that\nwas later on a different group was looking for food. They went to see this farmer and he sold\nthem food at exorbitant prices. Then the commanding officer [indecipherable] took out his pistol,\nand says okay, let\u2019s have the money back. He said, we paid you, you charge exorbitant prices.\nThen he took a box of matches, stuck the match -- the money into the fire. He says, that\u2019s for\nyou, you get nothing. But you got paid, right?",
        "Q: It\u2019s very clever.",
        "A: There was a lesson.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t overcharge any more, and he got [indecipherable] his business too. They learned.",
        "Q: I think we have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: Fred, you were mentioning to me about checks that you were receiving that you still don\u2019t\nknow --",
        "A: Who sent them, right.",
        "Q: Who sent them.",
        "A: We were in the small village of St-Germain-de-Calbert, and from time to time, for a period of\ntime they came every month, and then they stopped. The only people I remember in France that\ncould have possibly send me one is a cousin of my parents who had been in service, got married,\nand lived, I believe, in Lyon. But I was never able to identify this because the sending station\nwas different. The -- the -- the place from where they s-send the checks. And the other\n[indecipherable] was, if possible, I understood that maybe some Jewish organization may have\nbeen aware of our existence, and they did not put their name on it. I understand they had some\nresources in Switzerland, the -- I forgot what the name of the organization was -- and they could\nhave possibly done that for a period of time, but I do not know.",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No. It was welcome, because we were --",
        "Q: I bet it was.",
        "A: -- exhausted [indecipherable]",
        "Q: How did it come to you? It wouldn\u2019t come to your place, would it? How did you --",
        "A: Well, they picked them up -- I guess we had to pick them up at the post office --",
        "Q: At the post office.",
        "A: -- which was about half a block away.",
        "Q: I see. Huh.",
        "A: Speaking about post office --",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Did I tell you that they censored some letters that were sent out from St-Germain-de-Calbert?\nI found out afterwards. If those letters were sent to a German authority, or a French police\nauthority, they just tore them up.",
        "Q: They tore them up?",
        "A: They [indecipherable] tore up.",
        "Q: And this was because the resistance was working in various places in that small town, but you\ndidn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t know this at the time.",
        "A: No, I found out afterwards through the --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- somes of -- books that I read.",
        "Q: There\u2019s an incident where police come, or SS come, I don\u2019t know who it is, comes to your\nhouse and they look through the house?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: And -- but they miss what would have been very revealing, am I right?",
        "A: Right. And this was an incident that occurred on April seventh, 1942, in the village -- or north\nof the village of san -- St-Etienne Vallee Francaise. And what happened 1s, this one\n[indecipherable] was a hard to get along fellow, apparently, who wouldn\u2019t take orders from\nnobody, and he had a car parked in the street. And some of the local people saw that there was a\nsubmachine gun on the back seat. So they told him to take it away, and he refused, just for spite.\nAnd what happened, shortly thereafter, a car with four -- I -- I was told -- Gestapo or\nWehrmacht, [indecipherable] taken by. I\u2019m not sure which it is. Anyway, they saw that\nsubmachine gun on the back seat, and wanted to find out whose it was. Then this\n[indecipherable] from the resistance came out, and with this man, and they killed three of them\non the spot. I hear from other sources they were killed two on the spot, one tried to escape, and\nwas shot under a bridge where he had hidden, and the fourth one was captured and they hanged\nhim on the gate of a chateau 1n the same division. A few days later a -- two companies of the Ost\nLeon, these are the Russians [indecipherable] the Polish troops in the German army, the legion of\nthe east, came by from Marda, and came through our village. And [indecipherable] police came\nFeldgendarmie, with big metal [indecipherable]. And they knocked on the door at about one, two\no\u2019clock in the morning with the rifle butts. I opened up the door and they come in, and the\nleaders says terrorishn. Are there any terrorists here? My father says, \u201cIl n\u2019ya pas terrorists.\u201d\nThen they say, raffen. We understand every single word they\u2019re saying because they\u2019re speaking\nGerman and we understand it. My father ignores it, \u201cQu\u2019est ce que c\u2019est raffen?\u201d So the guy does\nthis with his rifle. My father says, \u201cNo, Il na pas.\u201d Then they searched the house. On top of\nclosets, all the doors, the kitchen, every room. And there\u2019s a big overseas trunk in one of the\nrooms, bedroom. They open it up -- one of the -- one of the guys open up. They went different\ndirections, every one had a different assignment. He opens it up, and there\u2019s a drawer of like,\nshirts, under which we had our talleissim and Tefillin. Luckily for us, he never lifted that tray.\nHad he lifted it, we would have been dead. So he says, \u201cNicht viel.\u201d Not much. He closes the\ncover and goes on looking for more weapons or other things, 1-in the whole house. Another one\nof them --",
        "Q: May I ask you something? Isn\u2019t it odd that he didn\u2019t lift up -- everybody knows that there\u2019s a -\n- a tray.",
        "A: [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "Q: Right? You just lift it up.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t lift it up.",
        "Q: Do you think he did that on purpose? You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Maybe he was tired already from, you know --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- because they had probably a long day [indecipherable] those -- reason, because they had to\ntravel quite a bit --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to come to the house, too.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So this very strange, I mean, it saved our lives.",
        "Q: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: And a-another one had came into the kitchen, and the radio was there on the table, so he says,\n\u201cRadio?\u201d I says, \u201cCe marche pas.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work. Well, he doesn\u2019t listen, he turns it on. Maybe\nhe didn\u2019t understand French anyway. So he turns it on and there\u2019s a crackling noise because it\nwasn\u2019t functioning. He shuts 1t down. Then he sees two dictionaries on the table, one French-\nGerman, and one French-English. So he points to the English one, he says, \u201cThis good, das\nyeah.\u201d So I nod my head. He walks away. Meantime I have a dog barking in the backyard, and I\nhad to quiet him down because he was waking up the neighborhood, too. Then --",
        "Q: Was that your dog?",
        "A: What\u2019s that?",
        "Q: Did you have a dog?",
        "A: Yeah, a small one.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, uh-huh. That dog was important because he helped us bring a lady from Martin a few\nmiles away, she was expecting. And we had to take her to the house to bring her to -- to the\nProtestant minister who took care of her to go to the hospital, a Jewish woman.",
        "Q: And how did the dog help?",
        "A: When the dogs came -- when we pass in the night [indecipherable] there, dogs are barking all\nover the place, and he never answered back, as if he knew, you know. Otherwise he would have\ngive us -- gived us away.",
        "Q: Right. So when did you get the dog?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: When did you get the dog?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t recall the exact time, but he was with us for 0-over a year or so.",
        "Q: He was\u2019?",
        "A: Oh yes. Now, the other German checked under the stairway, and there was a spot there where\nthey stored normally vegetables, you know, potatoes or whatnot. And he looks in there with his\nflashlight, doesn\u2019t see anything. Behind a sheerai -- a wax cloth, we had hidden our false identity\n-- ar -- our true identity cards. And he does not see nothing, it matches the color of the rest of the\n[indecipherable] and he walks out. So two chance --",
        "Q: That\u2019s pretty scary.",
        "A: Oh yes. And then they walk out, we were very calm, and then we collapse. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Once they walked out you collapsed?",
        "A: Oh God, yes. That was hel -- horrible. We were very close to getting killed there. Turned out\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Do you think they would have just killed you on the spot?",
        "A: Probably not, but they would bring us to the Gestapo.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The same thing.",
        "Q: And that would have been -- yeah.",
        "A: Because they would have probably tortured you to try to find out what else you know, who\nelse you know, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you think of, after this incident, putting all of these things that could reveal who you are\nsomeplace else? Bury them or something?",
        "A: Well, what happened is, in the building there was a workshop with a dirt floor. And I had\nburied those papers in there months before. But we were on the side of a hill, and when it rained,\nthe water accumulated, the sand was washed out, and the papers were shown.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I took them from there and hid them.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. So did you leave them in the house after this, still?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall for sure, but we had not much of a choice [indecipherable] you know. But we\nhad tried to escape from there, the back wall had the stones -- a stone wall actually, with spaces\nin between, and we tried to put in cap -- a couple hooks so we could walk out there. Luckily we\ndidn\u2019t try, because there were soldiers out there, too. And if we had, we\u2019d be dead.",
        "Q: So a -- I see, it wouldn\u2019t have worked. Did you know that there was a lot -- there were a lot of\npeople in the resistance in this area, or --",
        "A: Nobody talked very much.",
        "Q: Nobody talked that much.",
        "A: The less we knew, the better off we were.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, my brother almost got shot. You know, the Germans were taking people\nfrom a certain age [indecipherable] 20 - 21 and 22 for forced labor to Germany.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And it -- you have young people came up from the vi -- cities to hide up there. I found out\nafter my brother was killed in combat that there was a group of the resistance that was lying in\nambush for him one time, they wanted to kill him. Why? He came to work from the one farm\nwhere he worked, and they thought that the only reason he was in the open and not being\nbothered by the police or so is because he must have been collaborating with the Germans. But\nthe reason was that we were passing for Alsatians, and there was an agreement between France\nand -- and als -- and the Germans, Alsatians who were -- some of them were Ger-Germans, some\nof them were French, should not be forced to work f -- in Germany. So this one guy from 0 --\nwell, this is [indecipherable] later on told me that we stopped them from killing your brother.",
        "Q: So tell me something, how does it happen that you and Max go into the resistance? What --\nwhat circumstances s-so that you could get in there in the first place?",
        "A: Well, the resistance rep -- s-single people that were hiding in different places, farms\n[indecipherable], after awhile they got organized, and then they got uniforms. They broke into a\nuniform factory in Saint Jean Lugar, with the complicity of the owner. He says they broke in and\nthey took so many uniforms. Once they got a uniform, they figure it\u2019s about time we should join\nthem guys, too. This is not -- think of us as a -- a -- either against them, or not going to do\nanything for -- for France. So --",
        "Q: But how did you know that that was the resistance?",
        "A: How did I know the resistance?",
        "Q: Yeah, how did you know?",
        "A: Because they stayed in a building just south of the village, maybe a few hundred feet south\nfrom there, which was supposed to be a camp for Chantiers de jeunesse. This was Marshall\nPittens idea of taking young people and organizing them for future Frenchmen, you know, o-of --\nof his kibo and thing. [indecipherable] too. So we said that -- and they came up and they had\nroadblocks on the main highway, so we decided let\u2019s -- let\u2019s join them.",
        "Q: Now, did you talk -- talk about this with your parents?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You just did it?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were you living with your parents at the time?",
        "A: Yes, oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: And did they know that you were involved, or didn\u2019t they know?",
        "A: No, well they -- they found out, because as soon as we applied there, the guys -- we were g --\non guard duty, y-you know, so many hours of the day --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- hours of the night. And then we got uniforms too, like they were wearing.",
        "Q: So then they found out.",
        "A: It\u2019s a khaki unif -- jacket and --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- brown pants, yeah.",
        "Q: And were they unhappy that you were doing this, or what?",
        "A: Oh, they were very happy.",
        "Q: They were happy?",
        "A: Because of just -- they -- who, my parents, or -- or --",
        "Q: Your -- your parents.",
        "A: Oh, my parents. They had the doubts about that.",
        "Q: They had doubts.",
        "A: But you know, we had made a decision. We could not be in [indecipherable] and people not\nknowing if they are on one side or the other side, and that could have been very costly for us\nsometimes.",
        "Q: So w -- did this mean that your parents were not safe? Or were they safer because you were in\nthe resistance? Or didn\u2019t it matter?",
        "A: Well, the people in the village treat us like somebody apart to some extent, you know --",
        "Q: So that you were strangers --",
        "A: -- the parents, they were like strangers to -- to some extent.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Until we joined them, the resistance, everything 1s fine.",
        "Q: So they knew which side you were on, and then --",
        "A: Yes, exactly.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: There was one villager there who had the son in the French milice, which was the most cruel\nterrorists of the French government that took the resistance people and killed them and tortured\nthem and do everything to them. And the neighbors warned by an anonymous letter, hand carried\nto them at night -- not to them, to the house, that they better shape up and get their son out of the\narea. So you know, we do take [indecipherable] the situation, too. It -- not knowing who we\nwere, what we were doing, did not help in that case.",
        "Q: But let me ask you something. How do you actually -- why did they even trust you? You just\nwent up to them and say we want to join you? I mean, what did -- wh-what did you actually do to\njoin?",
        "A: Well, some of these were actually local inhabitants.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Some were from the other cities.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So the local ones were, like I said, the one guy told these -- the other commander not to shoot\nmy son, so, you know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- they realized he --",
        "Q: They -- they knew.",
        "A: -- they did not know, but they were not out to do something unfortunate that could not be\ncorrected. So, I mean when we said we -- okay, we\u2019d like to join you and help you, stay on duty,\nand guard duty, whatnot, they [indecipherable]",
        "Q: That was okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did they know you were Jewish? No.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did they ask?",
        "A: That\u2019s just -- that -- no, that\u2019s the whole point. Because we were not Jewish officially to them,\nthen who are we? We are Alsatians. What are you doing in the mountains? How come you don\u2019t\n[indecipherable] as us, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: There was a lot of questions that could be asked.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I guess they accepted what we [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So, when you weren't doing guard duty at night or doing something at night, did you go back\nhome to your parents?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And your father at this point is doing what? He\u2019s -- he\u2019s working?",
        "A: He was not working at that time.",
        "Q: He wasn\u2019t?",
        "A: No. And we had the case where I mentioned to you about the sheepherder who had 300 sheep.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And rather than the ge -- the Germans take it all, he took them to the -- our resistance group,\nand we ate sheep for quite a long time. Mutton. But he -- also -- they also decided to give the\nparents of the resistance there food, for the sheep.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So that helped too, you know, so th --",
        "Q: And who slaughtered the sheep, the resistance and gave them food -- I mean ho -- how did it\nwork?",
        "A: Well, they had the sheep in some farm, and [indecipherable] he had 300 sheep --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But anyway, every so often they took a sheep on, and took it -- you know, killed it, and -- and\n-- and divide it --",
        "Q: The food out.",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] among parents of the -- the guys in the resistance.",
        "Q: Right. So, did your parents then have more food than they had before?",
        "A: Well they had no -- no -- no meat.",
        "Q: But they ha -- now they had meat?",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: And is your sister working?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. So --",
        "A: Ah -- we -- she works working for that one lady that wanted to have the certificate of baptism,\nyeah.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: She was still there.",
        "Q: But was she getting some money, or not?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: She was just getting some food while she was there.",
        "A: I don\u2019t even if that -- it\u2019s just the idea of, you know, keeping busy, and then people know\nwhat\u2019s going on.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Really.",
        "Q: So your -- your parents and your sister are not in a great position at this point?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: So did you and Max think that being in the resistance would be helpful, then? I mean, is that\none of the reasons why --",
        "A: No, we -- the Germans, more than the people that were in the resistance in a -- in St-Germain-\nde-Calbert, they had nothing to lose. They could disappear and even if they caught, well, they\nwould ship them to Germany to do hard work, labor, you know. Us they would kill, so we had --",
        "Q: So you felt you had nothing to lose by doing it?",
        "A: Exactly right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And -- and we also -- to take vengeance for the killing of our relatives. I mean, this very\n[indecipherable] knew of.",
        "Q: Right. Did you feel in the resistance group that you were French or you were Jewish? Was\nthere --",
        "A: French. French.",
        "Q: French.",
        "A: Because I had to play the game for all of them.",
        "Q: And you -- and you really felt that?",
        "A: Why --",
        "Q: Or was this your -- your mask?",
        "A: No, because I still knew why we were there under false names, that we were going to get\nkilled as [indecipherable] so certainly the fact that I consider myself Jewish was definitely\npresent. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right. That was -- that was present, yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So were you immediately when you got into the resistance, were you trained right away, or\ndid that take awhile?",
        "A: No, because we had no weapons at that time.",
        "Q: And this is -- is this \u00b042 or \u201943? This \u201943?",
        "A: \u00b043 -- \u00b044 almost. Because the resistance include everybody who was hiding from the\nGermans.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Whether they were active or not, it included those who were put in the reserve to get\norganized eventually, to be f -- in formations, and be supplied with weapons, too.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And what happens 1s Germans had issued orders to the city halls to create all weapons from\nthe civilians. They want you to turn in the weapons. And so it either may have mentioned what\u2019s\nthe -- they need weapons, so where do you get them? City hall. That\u2019s where they were hidden.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you went and stole them?",
        "A: Broke in, with the complicity of the mayor --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and his assistant.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The knew about it. They just complained about it, but the only problem was that the weapons\nwere of all types, ammunition was all mixture. It was difficult to have the right ammunition for\nthe right rifle.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And if you had wrong bullet, you jammed the rifle.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And it\u2019s useless.",
        "Q: So what\u2019d you do? You kept trying to find the right one for the right --",
        "A: Yes, we -- we managed to free up the jammed rifles, too, but this was dangerous too because\nit can explode in your --",
        "Q: Right. So was there someone there to train -- you had never had a gun in your hand before.",
        "A: I had been at the College Bartholdi in Colmar --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And on Thursdays we had training for [indecipherable] preparation. We didn\u2019t do very much\nthere, but we learned how to shoot a rifle.",
        "Q: Oh, you did?",
        "A: The first time I shot rifle, they told me, this is the target there --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and they said aim in such and such a way, just below, and I did. And there was a guy next\nto me who hated me, I don\u2019t know for what reason. He says, \u201cHa, ha, ha, you couldn\u2019t touch the\nside of a barn.\u201d And the inspect -- the instructor says, \u201cWait a second.\u201d He goes over. \u201cHe hit\nright in the center.\u201d And was he embarrassed.",
        "Q: Yeah, I bet he was.",
        "A: That was an accident, I mean, I may not have hit the center again, but that time I did.",
        "Q: Did you feel comfortable around weapons?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: And was that mainly because you -- y-you knew who the enemy was, or does --",
        "A: Yes, exactly, because it gave me a chance to use them to fight back. Not necessarily to attack\nthem, because we were outnumbered, but at least to defend ourselves.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that was very important for us.",
        "Q: Right. Huh. So when was it that Aaron Bank came into your life?",
        "A: About end of July, he was parachuted as a part of a Jedburgh team. That\u2019s J-e-d-b-u-r-g-h.",
        "Q: And what does that mean, Jedburgh?",
        "A: It\u2019s a -- Jedburgh is a name of a castle out in Scotland. And they were trained over there in\ngroups of three, usually in the [indecipherable] an officer or non-com, who spoke the language of\nthe country in which they were parachuted into, because it landed in Belgium, Holland, France,\nYugoslavia, different places, so they had to have somebody who spoke the local language. And\nthe third one was a radio operator. And the -- the point was for them, first of all, to recognize --\nto reconnoiter, to find out where the German troops were, their strength, what were good\nobjectives to destroy in case of an invasion to block roads and whatnot. We were started on the\nuse of a plastic explosives, which was a new thing at the time. We were trained in using gammon\nhand grenades, there was a special type of hand grenades that they brought to us. That\u2019s just\ntraining, we did not get any of the weapons right away, though, because it --",
        "Q: You got no other weapons?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: You -- you got no weapons?",
        "A: Not right away.",
        "Q: Not right away, uh-huh.",
        "A: There was just the training. And th-then the Jedburgh team drove around to get acquainted\nwith the various maquis, where they were located, to look for positions, what was important to\ndestroy to prevent Germans from il -- attacking, or reinforcing troops.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And then, after that they had time in August, to train us. So Bank came back and trained us in\nthe use of the plastic explosives and they gave us rifles, German, Italian and Russian rifles. Why\nthese rifles? Those are the ones that -- the Italian rifles were captured in Africa, North Africa, in\nLibya, I believe. The German rifles were captured over there too, possibly or in Italy, and the\nRussian rifles were captured in Russia. Since the Germans used -- and other Russian troops, and\nthe German army, I guess they were forced into the service. They had Ru-Russian drivers there,\ntoo. So the problem was that the ammunition was all different in each of the rifles.",
        "Q: The ammunition was different?",
        "A: Yeah. You could not use one with -- in the other rifles, and that was a big problem. The\nreason for giving us those weapons too, was the fact that in case of bad weather, they cannot\nparachute or re-supply us, so they have to have a source of constant re-supply, and the best thing\n[indecipherable] to the Germans and take their weapons --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and ammunition.",
        "Q: So were these parachuted in, the weapons?",
        "A: The weapons were -- some were parachuted in, the heavy weapons like the French, the heavy\nmachine guns --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The Hotchkiss machines gu -- machine guns. Some American Browning machine guns, and\nbasically the -- the heavy stuff was parachuted in there, yes.",
        "Q: And Aaron Bank also parachuted in to this area?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. Well, he parachuted before the equipment, way before.",
        "Q: Right, right. Now why would he parachute into that area? Was it known that there were a lot\nof maquis in the area?",
        "A: Well, there were many of those teams parachuted in all over France, and even in Germany.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So it was just a matter of seeing -- they were prepared for the landing in North Africa.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: This happened in August. The landing happened on August 16\", if I remember correctly, in\n1940 -- si -- \u00b044. So, he had to be in place to find out how the Germans were reacting to the\nlanding, if they were sending troops from different areas, and [indecipherable], especially they\nhad two SS Panzer divisions, plank regiments in the area. One was the ninth German Panzer\ndivision, the other one was the 11\u201c Hohenstauffen Panzer division. And they wanted to make\nsure that they cannot attack the allied -- allied troops landing in southern France.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So we should be able to block them.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Block them how? Mainly by putting [indecipherable] down and blowing them up. See, it\nwould not block the Germans, but it would slow them down. They have to remove the trees and\nwhatnot.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And it was just a matter of getting in time, while the allies were landing their troops in --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Okay, we -- we need to change the tape.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "Q: So, y-you are with Aaron Bank being trained during the spring of 1944, the early summer of\n19 --",
        "A: In August. In August, actually.",
        "Q: In August.",
        "A: Yes [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So how long are you in the resistance before you get this training, do you think? Six months,\nthree months?",
        "A: No, no, no, no. He -- when he parachuted --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- in August, on the 16\" he came down. A few days later he trained us, and we went into c-\ncombat on the 21\".",
        "Q: No, I understand that --",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: -- but you joined the resistance before Aaron Bank came into the picture.",
        "A: Yes, yes, 1-in June.",
        "Q: In June?",
        "A: Yes, but because we were hidden also, this is all part of the resistance.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Those who were hiding were actually being organized because people in town send them to\nthe mountains to hide in farms and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But that was in preparation of regrouping them and arming them afterwards.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So the resistance was actually considered in the [indecipherable] region [indecipherable] as\nthe fifth of -- I guess in the fifth of May, 1943.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a different sort of a concept of resistance, that actually something\u2019s happening that in a\nway you don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Right, the fer --",
        "Q: Right, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re putting you all together to try and get you to --",
        "A: Yes, and yi -- I -- it was never to exceed a certain number of people at any spot.",
        "Q: I see, right.",
        "A: You -- the maximum they want us to be is maybe 30 at one place, in one location. If you had\ntoo many people in one area, then the Germans would become interested.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they would try to have big forces surrounding you.",
        "Q: So how many people were in your group, about 20, or was there more?",
        "A: We were in the -- our group, 20. The first was retrained by bake -- by Banker -- Bank,\nColonel Bank.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And we were then as-assigned a hundred more from a different company that -- from those\nwho were [indecipherable] were joining us, and they never received the tr-training from him,\nthey were thrown in the battle without training, with us. So we were the ones who attacked first,\nand [indecipherable] to pull back with, and be there to get [indecipherable] for the whole\nregiment.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I mean for the whole company. And then we divide ourselves to be mixed with the other ones,\nSO We were supporting them and showing them, you know, not to run, a-a-and -- and they had\nconfidence just because we had the training [indecipherable] that way. And we are not as a single\nunit then together, we were divided in combat. We mixed together.",
        "Q: With -- with these other people.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But you\u2019re trained by Colonel Banks for a few days, that\u2019s all?",
        "A: That\u2019s all. That\u2019s all.",
        "Q: And then you were supposed to be organized well enough to go in to battle of some kind?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: So a few days after you get trained, you\u2019re actually in your first battle?",
        "A: Our very first in August, we were in battle. That\u2019s when I led the one group there.",
        "Q: Right. You want to explain what happened?",
        "A: Yes, okay. About 16\" or 17\" of August, oh I -- I [indecipherable] there, we went down from\nthe mountains towards Ales, the city of Al\u00e9s. We stopped at a place called genearagues, g-e-n-e-\na-r-a-g-u-e-s, and we\u2019re in the best position to report any activities, Germans and so forth. And\nthis was the Saturday, on Sunday morning the people from th -- from Al\u00e9s came by, they want to\ngo swimming in the river not too far from there, and they see we are resistance in uniform, and\nsay, you know, a group 1s coming in behind us, and those people -- there 1s one young lady, she\u2019s\n17 years old, her boyfriend is a militia, a traitor that is -- was working for [indecipherable], and\nthose are the people that killed the si -- the resistance people. So I am on guard duty there, and I\nstop her, ask for her name [indecipherable] and I arrest her right away, and I turned her over to\nthe gendarmes. They were in Al\u00e9s [indecipherable] too. They [indecipherable] her -- then\nquestioned her, and then they searched her, and she has a pistol.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, and it was in her chest.",
        "Q: In her -- in her -- in her bra?",
        "A: Mm-hm, a small pistol in her bra. And they kept her overnight because we did not want to\nhave reports back that the resistance over here. They release her the next day. Her boyfriend was\ncaptured by a Communist group two -- three days later. He admitted that he belonged to the\nmilitia and he was being paid 3000 francs a month, but he claimed to have resigned two, three\nmonths ago. And I had to report this to my captain in my report, and I understand that they killed\nhim, but I have no proof of that. I was told that they shot him.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: A-Anyway, then they had -- on the 21\", we were told that the civilians -- civilian population\nin Al\u00e9s had risen up against the Germans, and the Germans had killed eight or nine of them in\nthe city streets. Well, they send us [indecipherable] to -- to reinforce. We were about 30 in that\nposition. So now we [indecipherable] our groups. We were going up tr -- on a truck first, on th --\none machine gun, and we were at Al\u00e9s, the Germans had left, because I guess they may have\nreceived orders to retreat and combine with some other units. So my captain -- my lieutenant --\nthere was a -- there was a re -- assigned different positions to some of the guys. And me he puts\non a pors -- on a [indecipherable] road, he says, report to me if there\u2019s anything abnormal\nhappening over here, and he goes into reconnaissance. Well, I didn\u2019t know where the\n[indecipherable]. Anyway --",
        "Q: No cell phones, huh?",
        "A: No, no cell phones. So civilians come back. The French flag 1s all over the city. And they said\nyou -- the Germans are coming back there, and the [indecipherable] Al\u00e9s about 10 kilometers sou\n-- south of Al\u00e9s. I said, oh my God, with the French flag all over the place. We can\u2019t inform\neverybody at one time to remove them all at once. We are not strong enough to have a street\nfight with them, with the Germans that are come in. What\u2019s the alternative? So we decided we\nhave to attack them. And I made the decision, there was nobody in charge, and I so -- took the\nguys, and because I just took that action, they did not question it, and they base -- my fa --\nfather\u2019s trait.",
        "Q: I was going to say, you\u2019re just like your father, right, but you were no -- you were what, 19?",
        "A: 19, yes, in \u201840 --",
        "Q: 1944.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, mm-hm. So then I take th --",
        "Q: And this is your first --",
        "A: Combat.",
        "Q: First combat.",
        "A: Combat.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: There were 10 guys over there, and I had to take them with me. They did not question. And\nthen five civilians come over too, to say they want to go with me. I says fine. We had stationed --\nwe had been stationed 1n a school that the Germans had abandoned, but they had left a whole\nbunch of hand grenades and other equipment there. So I gave the five civilians a hand grenade\neach, a potato masher, it\u2019s called. And I took my men in the car -- no, in the truck. There were\nsome Communists that decided to join us too. I said, okay, come along. So they pile in too, we\ngo to [indecipherable] Ales, to find that on the [indecipherable] there, the one, the pyramid, did\nyou ever hear it?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see a pyramid on the -- on your pictures today.",
        "Q: No, but that came after the war.",
        "A: No, no, I mean, I didn\u2019t see it today, you have -- you don\u2019t have it with you?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Oh, I [indecipherable] make sure, okay. Anyway, this is where they have the machine gun\nthat was nine by two, the Communists, that their leader had left to go on a reconnaissance. So I\nasked them, what are you -- and he said, oh, our leader 1s coming back soon. Fine. So I divide\nmy men in three groups. I took four or five men with me, and the civilians, the five. I sent five\nthe other way, and the other ones remained with the Communists with the machine gun there.\nThe Germans were having lunch, they got lunch break, in a farm just south of the village. We\ncame out from two sides. And we didn\u2019t know how many there were. We were told by civilians\nthat seen them before there were about 150 in the trucks, 20 trucks lined up.",
        "Q: They had 20 trucks?",
        "A: They were lined up -- there was a farm and the access road through the main highway. The\nother side of the farm was land, so they couldn\u2019t even go through there, and I came from that\nside. So [indecipherable] somebody fires at the Germans, and they are aware that something is\ngoing on here, and then the one -- one of my civilians to whom I had given a pistol, had three b-\nbullets in the pistol, he aims at a German, closes his eyes and fires. I said, my God, you didn\u2019t do\nany -- y-y-you think you\u2019re going to aim at anybody that way? I was furious because he give our\nposition away too soon.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: So the Germans were alert now that there are new -- two groups at least, around here. So they\ndecided they were forced to go south anyway, so they pulled out. As they were on the highway, I\nhave come around and I counted trucks, that\u2019s how I knew -- I -- I wouldn\u2019t say 20, 1t may be 19\nplus one or minus one. It was about that number. So they go on and we shoot into the trucks.\nWhether we hit anybody or not we didn\u2019t know, because they had the covers o-on the trucks\nthere. But they go on fine. Then, a short while later -- by the way, the ci -- the Communists were\nin ci -- in -- in civilian clothes, so they could disappear in case things got too hot, so the Germans\nwouldn\u2019t know them from civilians. The problem was though, if the Germans couldn\u2019t tell who\nshot at them, they would take civilian hostages no matter where, and kill them, innocent people.\nAnyway, it was [indecipherable] truck came back [indecipherable]. We -- the two groups had\njoined them over here that point. And the truck stops with the white flag, and the -- one of my\nmen gets up and the -- the Germans shoot him in the leg. Th-The -- the time [indecipherable]\ntiming is [indecipherable]. And we were in the vineyards, it was about that high. We could not\nraise our heads because we\u2019d be dead. So I decide to crawl in the -- in the vines between the\nvineyard, and go to a farm, which is on the -- one of the pictures I show you. And I go behind,\nthey have a stairway going up into the attic. I go up there, the door is locked, I take my rifle and\ntry to shoot the door and lock off. The farmer runs up from nowheres, he says, \u201cAttendez, j\u2019ai la\ncle.\u201d Wait, I have the key. I says, fine, open up. And I told him to -- I order him, I didn\u2019t ask him\n-- ask him, I told him, remove one tile edge end of the roof so I can see the road, and use the\nopening for shooting at the Germans.",
        "Q: Wait a minute, excuse me. Is there something -- there a problem? [inaudible]. All right, so\nyou're --",
        "A: So I\u2019m through to the openings that were [indecipherable] the Germans and my -- one guy\nhad been wounded already.",
        "Q: Right",
        "A: And the three maga -- the three Communists are still walking towards the west lake, and I had\nto stop shooting because of the bunch of th -- they were in the -- 1n the way.",
        "Q: Because you could have hit them.",
        "A: Could have killed them.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I go back down and we are taking my buddy, put in a -- well, we -- a ligature, we took a\nbelt and tied that on. He -- he had been hit in the femoral artery, he was bleeding very badly. Wi",
        "Q: So you tried to stop the bleeding?",
        "A: I-I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: You tried to stop the bleeding.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Absolutely. So one of the guys says -- had his -- taken his belt off and did that, but we had not\neven a Band-Aid, no bandages whatsoever. So then the four of us, we picked up a ladder from\nthe farmer, it was laid on, and we took my buddy on it, and we had to carry him very low\nbecause the vineyard\u2019s very low to start with, and we could not afford to raise any dust by\ndragging him on the soil.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So that was a -- some mess there. Anyway, we got him to the village again. Meantime Bank\nhad been alerted, and he was there with the Commandant -- well, th-the leader of the whole\ndistrict. And so I -- I made my report of everything was -- was happening, and the meantime I\nfind out that the Germans has gone back, they fled.",
        "Q: And what happened to the Communists who went up to the --",
        "A: Oh they were -- they were taking prisoners.",
        "Q: They were take --",
        "A: The Germans took them with them. We found them later on tied to trees with the eyes\npunched out and the ears cut off. They didn\u2019t die. Didn\u2019t kill them.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t kill them?",
        "A: They just let them suffer, and they died anyway, yes.",
        "Q: Oh. So that was your first experience. Did it make you want to not do it again?",
        "A: Well, [indecipherable] says, anybody who is stupid enough to do what you did should be an\nofficer. So he promoted me and gave me a Croix de Guerre Silver Star.",
        "Q: I see. Were you frightened? At the end, I mean, did it -- did you think, oh my God, what\u2019s --",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know why, I felt that I was responsible for the -- for my guys.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So [had enough strength there to see to it --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that we --",
        "Q: Now is Max with you also?",
        "A: Yes, he was in -- on one group there, yes. The -- the group that was on the other side.",
        "Q: And what did he think of the fact that you took this over? Was he shocked?",
        "A: He was with --",
        "Q: He was with you.",
        "A: You know you -- there\u2019s a French saying, \u201cLa valeur n\u2019attends pas les nombres des ann\u00e9es.\u201d\nValor does not wait for the number of years.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: So you can be young and done --",
        "Q: Or you can be old and done, right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Now, would there -- were there other skirmishes, were --",
        "A: Yes, the na -- the next day, we were -- the s -- forgot the name -- the monter des silhols, s-1-l-\nh-o-l-s, la monter is m-o-n-t-e-r, des, d-e-s, silhols, that\u2019s a rise in the road. And we -- I should\nsay, what happened that night, I was put on duty over there, we had moved position, we had\nwalked a few kilometers, one after the o -- behind each other, to get new position, and then I was\nmid -- charged in middle of the night, on guard duty. At about six o\u2019clock in the morning, my\ncaptain comes along -- not so higher -- n-nothing than the captain. And he says I will have an\narms inspection. Okay. All of a sudden I realized that my bolt had been removed from my rifle.\nHe had been there during the night and saw me asleep and then he\u2019d removed it. He says, if it\nhappens again, anybody who 1s falling asleep on guard duty is going to be shot. I got the\nmessage. So anyway, in the afternoon, I -- he gives me permission to go to Al\u00e9s, which is a few\nkilometers down, for the afternoon. I went to a friend of -- one of the maquisards, who lend me\nhis bicycle, from his father. So I go to Al\u00e9s, and guess what, they tell me the Germans are\nfighting over there in the [indecipherable]. So I go back on the bicycle, I had only 100 in my\n[indecipherable] there and what happened, the tru -- German truck had a trailer with gasoline\nbehind it. It came from the airport of Nimes. And there were about 13 Germans in the truck, in\nthe trailer, and -- 1t was a truck, this was a big truck. Three in the front, one on the side with this\nmachine gun, and the rest was inside the truck. So they hit the -- our machine gunner who was on\nduty at the [indecipherable] over there, and he hit the German who was on the side of the car,\nand hit him right in the chest, and he was badly hit there. And then he killed the three in the front\nseat. And by that time I had arrived. They had some that jumped off the truck, Germans, some\nhad escaped. And some were afraid because they did not know which way to move. So then I\nlooked, and there was a [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a ditch --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- and there was a pistol in there. I grabbed the pistol, it\u2019s a German pistol, I put my rifle on\nmy shoulder. And then I go on the side of the truck, and all of a sudden two Germans jump out.\nAnd I was right behind them, so I said, [speaks German here]. Hands up. They do that\nimmediately, and I [indecipherable] and I bring back to rest of the group. This was so stupid on\nma -- on my part, you have no idea. I did not realize that there was no charger in the pa -- gun,\nthat the gun was empty, and this pistol has a small lever that goes up if there is a bullet in the to -\n- in -- in the chamber, and the lever goes up and -- and the German says geladen, loaded. And it\nwas down. So if the Germans had faced me, I would have been dead. They would have realized\nthere was no bullet there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I would have been gone. You know, how -- how often can you be lucky?",
        "Q: But did -- did you know this?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know that.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know about it, I found out afterwards that --",
        "Q: Afterwards.",
        "A: -- yeah, I found out the thing was empty. I didn\u2019t know about the lever.",
        "Q: So it was good you never --",
        "A: The lever.",
        "Q: -- you never asked these guys to turn around.",
        "A: I know, I -- I -- I was -- they turned sideways, and then I told them to line up, and let them\ntalk to each other for awhile to see if they were communicating anything that was important,\nbecause I wanted to find out how many had escaped. So this point then told them\n[indecipherable] you know? They realize I spoke German also, and they -- they stopped talking.\nThen we took them in to a -- no, there was one more guy that had escaped and was captured, and\nth -- they had dropped the machine -- the guy that was on the side of that, you know, truck had a\nmachine gun, but somehow or other that pulled off the -- what they were -- the mechanism 1s to\nfire. So my captain told me, ask him where the piece 1s, and tell that you\u2019re going to kill him if\nhe doesn\u2019t tell you, or how it functions, so forth. So I told him in German, and I tried to be a\nserious as possible and hey, you know, threatening. And he says, I\u2019m sorry, I -- I was a fireman\nat the base in ni -- Nimes, I was not in the infantry. [indecipherable] know that\u2019s a lie, because\neverybody gets trained for weapons. But anyway, we couldn\u2019t find the -- the missing piece, and\nthen we took him to Al\u00e9s with the truck that was damaged, the se -- the windshield was shot out.\nWe took the wounded German with us, we brought them to lyc\u00e9e, a school in Ales that served a -\n- as a hospital, and I think he couldn\u2019t make it though, because he had been really badly shot\nright in the chest.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And the German prisoner, I took him then to the city hall, where they had an officer that was\ninterrogating prisoners. So we passed a truck that had been brought there already, and he asked\nme to go to find his -- I don\u2019t recall that there -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a gamere, it\u2019s where you eat, you\nknow, it\u2019s like a metal dish or some [indecipherable] that you can fold, and so -- and said what 1s\nthat, because that were --",
        "Q: Is it a mess kit?",
        "A: -- mess kit, yeah.",
        "Q: Is it a mess kit, yeah.",
        "A: And then that word I didn\u2019t understand, it was a -- I\u2019m not [indecipherable] and then he\nexplained that to me, and I -- and I said, okay. Look, Ill let you go up in the truck and find it, but\nI\u2019m going to shoot you if you have anything else. And he went up -- up -- klamotte, that was the\nname, k-l-a-m-o-t-t-e, klamotte. I had to translate -- I have to spell German, too.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Anyway, he come back out and I turn him in to the -- interrogating officer, which was a G2\nmit -- milit -- military intelligence, and they took over from there. They put all the prisoners in a\n-- in jail, actually, cause they had no other place for them, except in the jail.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So that was then th -- oh no, before that, we knew some had escaped in the -- in the fields, so I\ntook him along and some of my guys and the friends there came along. We went to a farm, and\nthe farmer offered us anisette. It\u2019s a French drink, it\u2019s a very strong, good thing, and I feel sorry\nfor the guy. Are you thirsty? Is he thirsty? Yeah. So I says, okay, give him bottle.\n[indecipherable] anisette. He was so happy, he was -- it was August, it was very hot, too. And I\ntook him to town.",
        "Q: Right. Now the end of August, something really terrible happened when you were --",
        "A: Yes. There was one more incident in between --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- but I was not involved that one because I was not selected to that team. But that was a\nparty, a very small thing, there was no -- nobody killed. [indecipherable] like that. Germans\n[indecipherable] escaped then.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And on the 27\" of August, early in the morning, it\u2019s a Sunday, our captain gives the order to\ntake his troops to a certain crossroad to prevent the Germans from coming back towards Ales.\nAnd he\u2019s told it\u2019s a very strong column. Civilians had been informed by a German medic who\nhad been well [indecipherable] by them [indecipherable] that they should get away from their\nhomes because a big column come by and they are fierce guys, they are Russians -- they were\nTatars, Mongols, about 2000 of them, Russians, and a thousand Germans or so. So somehow she\ngot the message through to the resistance that we should be careful, the troop will be coming by.\nSo my captain was ordered to intercept them. We got there, it\u2019s too bad -- I had the pistol, the --\nthe mats we were in, the hills. And he located us on a certain perim-perimeter. There were three\nhills there, and then the horde was going right between them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So he was a good tactician. He was a captain in the artillery, in reserve, and he found us\nexcellent positions there. There were two machine guns that were in a rocky area, and they had\nthe -- a domineery -- domineering positions and we -- our group, the commander, the 20, were\nset up at front, right as the road turns and the Germans came from that direction. So we were\nhard in position, it was hot as can be. And thirsty, you know, nothing to drink. Anyway, we hear\nhorses galloping around there, and then we see motorcycles coming, and there\u2019s a patrol,\nGerman, reconnoitering the area. And one fellow on the machine gun fired too soon. The\nGermans were not supposed to be attacked until they were in certain position where we had a -- a\nlarger group under fire. And I guess he may have t -- hit some motorcyclists there, and then the\nGermans spread all over the place. We fought them for about seven hours. It was terrible. I\nmean, we were in good positions, we were on the hills, they were in the plain, and --",
        "Q: Fred?",
        "A: -- my [indecipherable] wounded -- I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to stop you now, because I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t want to stop you in the middle of the\nstory, so let\u2019s stop the tape now.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: We have to change the tape.",
        "A: I see, okay.",
        "Q: So | --",
        "A: No problem.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "Q: Okay. I\u2019m sorry for the interruption.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, it\u2019s okay.",
        "Q: So you were in battle for seven hours --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and you were in the stronger position, and nevertheless you still weren\u2019t able to stop them.",
        "A: Well, they couldn\u2019t advance, actually. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah, they couldn\u2019t -- I see.",
        "A: But then they came around on the right flank, they went around the hill, and we found out\nabout that, so we -- the [indecipherable] and we -- a machine gun that was moved over to stop\nthem, too. We found out certain things afterwards. For instance the commander asked -- he was a\nmajor, asked civilians if the resistance had been in the village. And he says, yes, they came by\nfor some water, but we didn\u2019t know who they are, we did not cooperate with them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s fine. And then he asked how many were they. So this young kid apparently told them,\noh, probably a th -- a thousand or so, exaggerating. But the major laughed and told him yeah,\nprobably a hundred, 200, which is actually quite -- we were 120 [indecipherable]. Anyway, they\ntook a hostage in the village, a poor guy that had come back from work and had gone to see his\nparents. And they thought he was a terrorist also, and they tied him up, I fo -- found out later on,\non the back of a horse drawn carriage, and dragged him to his death. He was dead. There was\none captain that was apparently a -- a -- a [indecipherable] one, and he\u2019s the one that got all of\nthis. There was one lieutenant apparently, in the German outfit that when they tried to shoot\nsome -- one of the civilians that were there, called Commandant, Commandant. Our\nCommandant was over there, he asked what was going on, so he said, don\u2019t shoot the civilians.\nSo you know, this is -- we found out afterwards. Anyway, we had to have more help. So our\ncaptain sent a motorcycle -- m-motorcycle -- motorcyclist to the headquarter of Bank and said\nwe need some support. And Bank immediately called up by radio -- there was a carrier -- aircraft\ncarrier in the Mediterranean, and he asked for a-assistance. And they said they will send two\nplanes. And th-the message came back to us, they will be there in half an hour, and it took about\nan hour, but anyway the two planes came in, machine gunned the Germans. They came in very\nlow, just [indecipherable] circled, and they machine-gunned them. And that slowed the Germans\ndown, and we had time to pull back, because we had to -- we could not hold the positions any\nmore. At that time the Germans -- when the planes left -- we were stupid, too. When the planes\nwere over, we got very excited and we took out hankies and we waved at them, you know? That\nwas a bad move because Germans saw where we were, our positions. As soon as the planes left\nwe got hit by artillery you wouldn\u2019t believe. I mean, 1t came down raining like anything. And\napparently my brother was killed there, but I did not know that at the time. The captain ordered\nus to pull back, and on the way down the lieutenant said, \u201cFred, we need you down by the car.\u201d\nThere -- there was a -- a [indecipherable] parked [indecipherable] and when we got on there he\nsays, \u201cMax is dead.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat? What happened?\u201d We -- we were close by, but there was a\nhill and he was on one side, at a [indecipherable], and I didn\u2019t see it. The bi -- shells -- the shells\nwere falling all over the place. And he says yes -- and he say -- and I -- when I moved to go\nback, he -- he -- he stopped me. And he put me in the car and drove me home -- to the next\nvillage. Next morning we go back, there was one of our men had been left behind. He apparently\ncould not follow us, and he had 29 Russian prisoners with him. And how do you do that? He\nsays, well, I saw them over there, and they were trying to hide, and there I was, so I point to them\n[indecipherable] and they surrendered. So we got close to them -- because they wanted to\nsurrender, they didn\u2019t want to fight with the Germans any more. So when we got close, then\nlined up and my lieutenant -- there\u2019s a difference between lieutenant and the captain, they always\ninterchange you know, whoever was in charge at the time. So my lieutenant tries to speak to\nthem, he doesn\u2019t speak Russian, and I don\u2019t speak Russian either. And then this Russian soldier\ngoes, heil Hitler. And I take my rifle [indecipherable] and kill him. So my lieutenant puts my\nrifle down, and the Russian\u2019s leader tells him, no, this is -- salute this way, not this way. He was\nlucky, he nearly got killed over there. But I understand, I mean, he did not know, you know,\nthere was -- there were -- leaders, many of them didn\u2019t know what the heil Hitler meant to a -- to\nthe French. And then we went -- during the night, more had surrendered, and we had captured a\ntotal of about 300 [indecipherable] citation from the German, 300 prisoners. And some\nsurrendered in the morning, some had gone to the next village and surrendered over there. So we\ncaptured all of them. Couldn\u2019t believe it. N-Not many Germans, all Russians, yeah.",
        "Q: Not many Germans in that group?",
        "A: They were -- no. They were pretty fanatics. They wouldn't surrender, those guys.",
        "Q: When was your brother buried? Soon after?",
        "A: Yes. So the same afternoon, they brought -- put him on a truck and they told me to go on, and\nthey had an honor guard in the truck, too. Went back up to the village, in Saint -- St-Etienne\nvalais Francaise, which is the city before St-Germain-de-Calbert, they had already no-notified\nthe people that we are coming. The honor guard were there. [indecipherable]. Then I got home\nand my father co-comes down the street there. He said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s my son, shot.\u201d We brang him\nin, my mom and my sister are there. It was terrible.",
        "Q: So you were the one who told them?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: You were the one who told them that -- that Max was dead, or --",
        "A: No, because the -- they had oper -- the news -- they fied -- the telephone operator at the post\noffice.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And they had notified my parents we were coming in. Then we s-stayed at the house the o-\novernight, and then the lady whose son had passed away the week before said that we should\nbury him next to her son. And they put him in a double coffin, because we told them that we are\ngoing to move him from there. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: It must have been awful.",
        "A: Yes. And then the eulogy from the pastor -- the protestant minister [indecipherable]\ntranslation?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes. There\u2019s about 800 people showing up his funeral.",
        "Q: 800.",
        "A: Almost the whole village. And o-other villages, too, you know. Well, after that I stayed a few\ndays in the village, then I was sent back to my unit, and at -- was transferred to -- my parents\nwent back to Montpellier, because this was all free at that point.",
        "Q: At that point -- it was a kind of liberation at that point?",
        "A: Yes. Y --",
        "Q: In August of \u00b044?",
        "A: Yes. You know, Bank -- not Bank, the Polish captain that had the Polish troops there?",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Well, he was part of the liberators from Montpellier. So things had settled down. The same\nthing is with the resistance. They had organized, but they were not in office yet, but they have\npre -- they had made preparations to take over as soon as possible. So it didn\u2019t take much time to\nget in -- take over the -- the officer there.",
        "Q: So you have very little mourning period for your brother. I mean, you\u2019re home for a couple of\ndays and then you have to go back.",
        "A: [had to go back, yes.",
        "Q: Was that be -- was that better for you, that you could go back and work?",
        "A: I wanted to go back.",
        "Q: You wanted to go back?",
        "A: I want the Germans.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: My parents did not object to me going back.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t want you to go back.",
        "A: They did not object.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t object.",
        "A: They knew why I wanted to go back.",
        "Q: Do you think they were afraid that something would happen to you?",
        "A: If they were they wouldn\u2019t let me know.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t say",
        "A: And maybe they were also more or less -- they saw down that they had the anxiety, you\nknow, they will not see things. Then, I went back to -- with the major, to whom I wrote about --\nthe lieutenant had lied, you know, about my combat. And he took me back to our unit. And then\nlater on I was -- my parents were in Montpellier, I was transferred there, and I was transferred to\nthe headquarter of the division as the interpreter for de Chambrun, who [indecipherable] and they\ngave me my rank, and my -- my rank at that time [indecipherable] it was on the 14\" of July. And\nthen I was in G2, Deuxi\u00e9me Bureau.",
        "Q: And is that because your brother was killed so that you could not be in the armed resistance\nany more, or was this because there was liberation at that --",
        "A: Well, the Germans [indecipherable] by that time, there was nothing to --",
        "Q: There was nothing to do.",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Then they took the other guys that were in my outfit and they put them in\nthe regular army, those who volunteered.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And then they got the French uniforms on the [indecipherable] so the one will have all\n[indecipherable] on --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- as well as afterwards. They were organized at the 81*' regiment. It was [indecipherable].\nThere is a rule in the French army, if you are sole surviving son, you don\u2019t go back in combat,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because they want the family tree to continue. As long as you are in combat, and one has\nbeen killed in combat --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- then the other one doesn\u2019t go back in.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But that was not reason there yet.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They trust me.",
        "Q: So it was different for you. So now you are in the intelligence.",
        "A: G2.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And the first thing that happens, they had me first day, German manuals.",
        "Q: German manuals?",
        "A: Yes, they had the weapon man -- manuals about the certain glass jars [indecipherable] it was,\nthere was a manual with it, I found out that these were firebombs. You break them and\neverything, it goes up in fire, you know. And machine guns were different [indecipherable |\nbecame busy and then later on my -- the Commandant de Chambrun, was replaced because he\nwasn\u2019t wer -- found to be untrustworthy because I think somehow or other he had the affiliation\nwith the Communists. And that goes way back, and he was [indecipherable] let him completely\nfrom the res -- from the army. In comes General -- Colonel Zeller, at the time, and he puts\ntogether all the officers of his headquarter, shakes their hands, looks at me. And next thing I\nknow, he gives me first rate, a -- a book in German. He spoke German perfectly, but he did not\nwant to let on. And what does he give me? A book on a house of ill repute that the Germans have\nrecorded the names of the girl [indecipherable]. He says, what is this about? He just wanted to\npull my leg, you know? What a character. But he --",
        "Q: So did you translate that?",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- I just said that -- that\u2019s what it is, you know.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what it is, that\u2019s the end of that.",
        "A: Yeah. He knew that. But I knew what he was up to, just to try to give me a hard time because\nI -- a young guy. And then I was very much involved with interrogating prisoners of war. There\nwas one that -- a few of them volunteered information so they could [indecipherable] before.\nAnd one was -- said that he had a gir -- a ger -- a French girlfriend, and she was expecting. And\nshe got in touch with her office, she would like to have [indecipherable] father. And he said that\nhe was an Alsatian, not a German, so they sent me out to investigate. And sure enough, he says,\nwell, my father was working in Alsace-Lorraine at one time, as a waiter. I says to --",
        "Q: A waiter?",
        "A: Waiter in a hotel -- in a restaurant, yeah. I says, and are you Alsatian? H says, no, my father\nwas working there. Okay. I wrote back a [indecipherable] report, and I se -- send them to the --\nthey moved o -- the mines 1n the -- on the beaches. I was so furious that they tried to take\nadvantage, I say, you know, these French [indecipherable] but I told them --",
        "Q: Where\u2019d they put him?",
        "A: I tol -- I told them to send him to the mine field.",
        "Q: To the mine fields.",
        "A: Yeah, because the Germans were set to remove the mines on the beaches there.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: In southern France, and because he had done that, I figured he should be punished.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I -- I was a bad guy.",
        "Q: You were -- you were a -- you were a mean guy, yeah?",
        "A: Yeah. And then the other one --",
        "Q: The-They did what you asked?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Oh yes. The -- you know, the -- he speaks German, th -- my officers, I accepted the job\n[indecipherable] involved in this case. And then there was a case where I mentioned before, this\none was employed by [indecipherable] and he was to -- he has impor-important information for\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So I drove past Nimes to the farm, and then he told me that the -- this was much later, though,\nwhen Germany had surrendered in -- in May, I believe, \u201945. And he told me that the 19 German\narmy who had come from that 1 -- from our area, had broke up some dirt in a school yard, and\nburied all the radio equipment in there, which is valuable stuff to have, you know. And had\ndumped all the electrical wiring over the side of a cliff. So I made a report to G2 and they sent it\nto general -- General [indecipherable] group -- well he is -- he was the [indecipherable] marshal\nlater on, but he sent his G2 officer there, and they checked into it. I haven\u2019t heard from him since\nthen.",
        "Q: Right. Were you also in charge of military mapping?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was that -- what does that mean?",
        "A: Okay. Each headquarter has a mapping department.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: It\u2019s a -- a -- a division has the maps for combat if they have to go so and so [indecipherable]\nsuch a place, they have to have maps of all the areas, copies of them at least. They can always\nmake copies later on, they have a special p-process. So they figured hey, you can do that. Well,\nwhat happened first, he says, they had a map of the combats in Russia, and they had this\nlieutenant who kept it up to date. They had the string with a [indecipherable] attached on the\nbottom, and they had pins there, and they had the string going with pins and show the progress\nfrom one day to the next. So he got a different assignment so they put me in there, because they\nhad the BBC every day, they were listening on the radio, and [indecipherable] information as to\nthe progress m-made by the Russians on -- on their front. [indecipherable] in Europe, but also I\nguess they didn\u2019t trust the Russians either at that time. Anyway, so they put me there, and then\n[indecipherable] that\u2019s not enough work for you, so they give me the mapping department. So I -\n- | found out that fish market in Montpellier was selling fish and wrapping them in that excellent\npaper which is used for maps. So I sent somebody to investigate and he said they have a whole\nbunch maps 1n a certain place in Ales. So I found out about that. I took two German POW\u2019s, and\none guard to go with me, and the chauffeur. And we went over there and took back about 20,000\nmaps. That was a gold trove. Those maps are expensive to -- to make. And they -- some were\noverwritten in German, but they were actually French, French maps that they had captured\nbefore. So the general was very pleased, and he had me make some shelves for all of those, it\nwas quite a job.",
        "Q: 20,000?",
        "A: 20,000 maps. You know, it was [indecipherable] to the French army.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Because they\u2019re the ones [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Maps, you know.",
        "Q: When -- when your parents go back to Montpellier --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you then go back with them and live with them and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and still work in the armed -- and -- and are you based in Montpellier now?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You are.",
        "A: The headquarter division 1s in Montpellier.",
        "Q: In Montpellier.",
        "A: Then my father meet some people there, and he said, you know, we have a lot of people\ncoming back from the camps. We got to do something for them. And he got in touch with Jewish\norganizations, I guess in Paris [indecipherable]. And they were assigned the responsibility for\nhelping those people. And they had about eight or 10 different organizations in that federation.\nMy father was director of the one federation, and five locations in the States, in those days were\non there [indecipherable] the cities. So they obtained money to give out to the refugees, a -- a\nmonthly sum. My father says, no, that is not what you should do. We don\u2019t have to give charity\nto those people, they need something more substantial so they can get back on their feet, like\nhuman beings. Those were profession -- excuse me -- we should try to get them the equipment\nthat they need to go back in their professions. I remember of two specific instances, I guess. One\nwas the shoemaker who needed shoe -- the equipment to repair shoes, and they were able to se --\nhe said okay, we should try to give them a lump sum, equivalent to maybe one or three years of a\ncharity. If they have the money later on, they can repay it and if not -- either they can give more\nto other people, but if not, there you go. And they agreed to that. So he was able to get enough\nmoney for the people to buy equipment that they had needed, and that was an excellent idea,\nbecause the people had self respect again. They came from the camps and had lost all the --",
        "Q: Now, was this money given to men, or to both men and women?",
        "A: Whoever applied. The women got the money to live on, but the -- there was actually to go\nback in business, if they had some business of sorts, yes. But otherwise they -- they didn\u2019t have\nto get that much money, but if they were a family, so that helped, you know.",
        "Q: Right. Now, there\u2019s this period --",
        "A: Very few -- Iam sorry -- very few women come back from that -- from there to Montpellier.",
        "Q: More men came back. Many more men.",
        "A: Not ma -- not many. Not many.",
        "Q: Not many men either.",
        "A: Compared to the women there were more men, but not that many, no, no.",
        "Q: But not that many anyway.",
        "A: There were few hundreds probably, at the time. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: The period that you\u2019re in the resistance --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- there\u2019s a kind of silence about what your father is doing. Did -- do you not know what he\u2019s\ndoing during that period of time, because the war is over, and then he starts up immediately to --\nto -- to do something, do you know what I mean? There\u2019s this period of great activity of your\nfather.",
        "A: Oh yes, I know [indecipherable] because they had the different groups. One helped the people\nfrom the camps, and then that o-organization to provide them food, and the other organizations\nto try to find family members, housing and so forth. And then I was called in once by one of the\nattorneys, yeah, to go with him. One -- or big department store had been taken over by Jewish\norganization -- the -- the Vichy organization for confiscating Jewish property.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So he says, look, we have to reclaim this property. The people there had been -- had\ndisappeared, we don\u2019t know where they are, but we want to get this back into our control in case\nthe people come back. So some local women had bought the property of -- at a auction.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So I said fine. He told them they should be at h -- at the office -- at the -- at the store at one\no\u2019clock in the afternoon. I took one soldier with me -- I was an officer at that time, and he went\nwith me. We got there and I -- he says, turn over your keys. They turned over the keys, good-\nbye, and he assumed responsibility for his clients. I hope so.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: You know [indecipherable] can happen.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But that was a -- an activity at least it was justified, take property back first and worry about\nrestitution --",
        "Q: So how soon after the war do you -- or after your liberation, do you discover what had gone\non in eastern Europe, and the murder of the Jews? Do you -- was it months, was it later than that?",
        "A: Probably three months, because when they rescued people in the camps --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- they came out.",
        "Q: And then they told you.",
        "A: Yeah. Newspapers, or --",
        "Q: So this must have been a huge shock to you.",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. We did not know the extent. We knew some camps, because the first\none was like maybe Mauthausen in Austria, where some of the first was liberated by the western\npowers. Russians liberated Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, you know, a different time frame.",
        "Q: It\u2019s -- right. Did that -- was that extremely depressing to you? I mean, what were --",
        "A: Yeah, very shocking, infinitely so, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t dream that people could do that to other people.",
        "Q: Now your parents lose close relatives.",
        "A: Oh yes. My father lost that --",
        "Q: So that [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- he had his mother and had at least five -- four -- four brothers and a sister, plus their\nfamilies. They were all married and children.",
        "Q: So in some ways, as difficult as your life was during this time, you\u2019re in a -- a kind of bubble.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Of not really knowing what else is happening.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And then we found out, when Jackie, the young boy came back out of\nFlossenberg, and the colonel left him with us, then we found a lot more of what happened over\nthere.",
        "Q: So tell that story a little bit, this is a -- a -- somebody --",
        "A: Okay, there was American troops in -- went in Germany, they liberated the camp of\nFlossenberg, F-l-o-s-s-e-n-b-e-r-g, and they find this little boy, he\u2019s about 14 - 15 years old, and\nthis American Major Leland, he was American officer, decides that he has no parents any more,\nwell the boy told him he had no more parents, and he wants to adopt him, eventually. So he goes\nwith him -- takes him with him in the unit for awhile. He gets an americ -- an American uniform,\nyou know [indecipherable] troops, and then when he was transferred out to Avignon. There was\na big [indecipherable] Aix [indecipherable] Aix - Aix -- Aix-en-Provence. And the troops are\nthere, the major has a brother over there who\u2019s also a doctor and they come to visit Montpellier.\nAnd somehow or other they come to a Jewish committee of the organizations and they meet my\nfather, and they mention about the little boy -- the boy comes with him too. After awhile the\nmajor 1s supposed to go to the Pacific, and he has met my father, so he asks him what -- will you\ntake care of the boy? He was more welcome because my parents were still missing my brother\nand now he would fill in --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- a-- a void. So said, sure. And he asked when Leland send a letter to [indecipherable] you\nbefore, asking him to help out. Then a -- a few weeks later he makes -- he asked my father make\narrangements with the American consulate in Marseilles. So when the papers are ready, the\ntickets are ready for shipping and all that, my sister and my father are in Marseilles, see the\nconsul there, and everything is finished and Jackie is with them over there, so the amba -- the\namb -- the consul asked my sister, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to go to America, too?\u201d She says, \u201cYes, but\nwe can\u2019t.\u201d Why not? \u201cIt will take years for us to get papers.\u201d He says, \u201cSend me your papers.\u201d It\nwas the beginning of -- it\u2019s the end of May. I [indecipherable] the beginning of March 46. We\nsend the papers in and within a month time we have papers to come to the United States. Now,\nthis was tricky, because you had to have the ships cards, too. Now it\u2019s just a Peter or Paul, which\ncomes first. They would not give us actually the visa. Yes, you ha -- they\u2019re coming to you, but\nyou must show us the visa -- the -- the ship cards, and vice versa. Anyway, I found out that the\nFrench government had some places available on a boat repatriating French citizens back to\nUnited States who had come back to France to fight. So they were -- had priorities to go back to -\n- see. And that included also people in the resistance. When I found out that, I said okay, let\u2019s get\nthe ship cards. We got those, and then we went back and we got the visa, in about one month\u2019s\ntime.",

        "Q: Right, that\u2019s right, 1t\u2019s quite nice.",
        "A: On Amsterdam Avenue, I think, was there a bakery or -- not quite a bakery, a Swiss cake\nshop where they sold cakes and pastry and whatnot? Or wouldn\u2019t you know?",
        "Q: I lived, you know, much later --",
        "A: I was young [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- so I don\u2019t know if this was the same .",

        "A: Well, we arrived in norfo -- no, norfo -- Virginia, yes.",
        "Q: Norfolk, Virginia?",
        "A: No, no, no, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s north -- it\u2019s a port -- no. It\u2019s a Navy port there.",
        "Q: Is it in Virginia?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: In Virginia?",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2019m quite sure it was, because we had two storms in the Atlantic. We had a small boat,\na -- a liberty ship, 10,000 ton, which was [indecipherable] more than the sea. Newport -- no. Oh\nGod, Norfolk? No, it was Norfolk, Virginia, I guess.",
        "Q: Norfolk?",
        "A: Uh-huh. And then we -- somebody called the news organization over there to receive us, and\nthen get us to the train station.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So they sent a lady over there, and --",
        "Q: And then you went to New York?",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: So that must have been disappointing to him.",
        "A: I suppose. What happened is, my father raised the roof when he -- when we came over here,\nhe went to the Jewish organizations in -- in New York, and Jackie was being taken care of by\nsomebody over there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And he asked them, do you give him any money -- pocket money, anything to go to the\nmovies or stuff like that? No, no. He raised the roof, he says, this child has the right to li -- live\nlike a child. You have a nerve not to -- you know, to treat him as one. And he -- he was really\nmad. He helped him out. They put -- put him up with somebody and he wa -- got very friendly\nwith the people to the point that he changed his name to their name.",
        "Q: So they had -- did they adopt him?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No. I guess they had children of their own already.",
        "Q: So he never had a f -- a family growing up when he was a teenager.",
        "A: No, well except when he -- except when he got married.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Had his own two -- two children, yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Three children.",
        "Q: Hm. Now, I understand that you -- you all moved in August of 1948 to Arizona because your\nfather was diagnosed with a heart condition, is that right?",
        "A: Well, he had a heart condition in -- in St-Germain-de-Calbert already.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And he had seen the doctor over there, and they couldn't do too much over there. We came\nover here, and he was here in the winter of \u201946, and we came here in *48 -- yeah, \u201947 was bad\nalso, doctor says get out of New York, go to wa-warm climate. So what he did, we wrote to\nchambers of commerce in Arizona, New Mexico, California and Colorado. And we asked what\nis situation for jobs and housing. Now remember that this was a time when many soldiers were\nbeing discharged, and they were looking for housing too.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So it was a competition and for jobs. And they were all discouraging except Arizona. The\nrespondent said, there\u2019s always an opportunity. Come and see for yourself. And so his relatives\nin New York said, you go to Arizona? Aren\u2019t you afraid of the Indians?",
        "Q: Out of the what?",
        "A: Of the Indians?",
        "Q: Indians.",
        "A: Yeah, Arizona? So my father says look, I crossed the ocean to see the Statue of Liberty, and\n[indecipherable] Indians. And he came back [indecipherable] he didn\u2019t speak the language. He\nwent to a Jewish organization and they send him to a -- [indecipherable] presidents who told him\nto check [indecipherable] to a real estate agent who will find a place for us. And they -- he made\na lot of connections over here. He was the kind of a person to -- you know --",
        "Q: To do that, yeah.",
        "A: -- he gets along, yes.",
        "Q: Did he speak English?",
        "A: Not much, not much. But to some of the people he could speak [indecipherable] too, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So you know, no problem. And then after a few weeks he had rented a store and then we\ncame over here too. And the first thing we did is buy some radio equipment -- equipment to\nrepair radios. [indecipherable] check tubes, radio tubes and -- and al-all that. And since I\u2019d been\n[indecipherable] I knew all about that. So we opened up the --",
        "Q: So you s -- so you started open -- repairing radios?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: You started repairing radios?",
        "A: Yes, uh-huh, yeah. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And are you all -- you\u2019re all living together now? Your sister and your si --",
        "A: Oh no, well we -- she\u2019s in Phoenix. And she has two children who live separate each one\nbecause they are unmarried.",

        "A: -- yes, yes.",
        "Q: And when did you -- your sister got married --",
        "A: We came here probably in August sometimes, I think. In \u201940 --",
        "Q: \u201948.",
        "A: 48. And she got married in February of \u201949.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, so it was pretty soon?",
        "A: Yes. We went to a synagogue over there on services, and she met this young man, and just --",
        "Q: And that was it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So she -- but she remained in Arizona?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Yes",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So you all remained close.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you met someone -- I gather you were almost a confirmed bachelor by your own\ndescription, yes?",
        "A: You got that right.",
        "Q: Yes. But in 1962 you met a woman named Marilyn?",
        "A: No.",

        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: What happened is she came with her parents from New York.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And lived in our neighborhood, and we knew a person across the street from there and he said\n-- he came over to me, \u201cFred, this young lady came from New York, she doesn\u2019t know anybody,\ncan you take her to the Jewish center to introduce her to young people, her age?\u201d",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Said sure. You know, I -- I wouldn\u2019t pay attention to me, after all, she is 16, I\u2019m 26, you\nknow, it\u2019s just like, when you\u2019re 90 and a hundred it doesn\u2019t make a difference --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- between 16 and 26? So --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] it makes a big difference, right?",
        "A: Okay, so I took her down there, she met people there, and then she met -- she finally married\nsomeone that she knew in New York but had come out here. And when he passed away about a\nfew years later, I --",
        "Q: So they weren't married for very long?",
        "A: No. Maybe five, six years, I suppose.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Uh-huh. Then she came by the store, I had the radio store downtown, and she had a baby\ncarriage and the wheel broke off right in front of the store. So I happened to see it, so I said okay\n[indecipherable] I take you home. Put the cart --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and the baby -- and then after that I met her once at a dance somewhere, she was with her\nbrother and I was with my sister and my brother.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then her brother says, let\u2019s go for a pizza, you know? And from then on, we start talking\nand I had a day off on Wednesday afternoon from work. I said, hey, how about taking the kids\nfor a wal -- you know, mountain climbing or an -- she said sure. And we got acquainted, and she\n[indecipherable], I got married.",
        "Q: And you got -- so you got married in 1962.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes. And unfortunately she died a few years ago, yes?",
        "A: Yes, eight years ago.",
        "Q: Was it eight years ago?",
        "A: Eight? No, six year -- six years ago.",
        "Q: Six years ago.",
        "A: Six years ago, yeah.",
        "Q: And did you stay in the radio business all that time?",
        "A: Yes, and I opened up the first TV store in Phoenix.",
        "Q: The first TV store, really?",
        "A: They had -- did not have much -- at that time they had the pattern, you know the test pattern\nthey used to have?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, sure.",
        "A: And that\u2019s all the people saw all the time. And they came in, when are they going to show the\npicture, when are they going to show the picture, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And when they finally came in a few months later, the TV station was built on top of the\nbiggest hotel in Phoenix at that time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so that was that. I went almost out of radio business to get the TV business. Then after a\nfew years, this -- no, I -- what happened is when I got married to Marilyn, I married her in July\nof \u201962.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But I said, you know, and I had been taking her and the kids out for weeks, for -- I said, you\nknow what? I have to leave more time free. I\u2019m not going to have somebody call me at 10 -- 11\no\u2019clock at night that they missed their football or boxing or whatever it is, and I want to have my\nweekends also. And that\u2019s the only way I can marry someone, we\u2019|l have some free time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then I worked for Motorola.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And we got married after that.",
        "Q: And what were you doing for Motorola?",
        "A: I was a reliability engineer.",

        "A: And you know, we had the [indecipherable] two and [indecipherable] three rockets?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I was in charge of the controls, the quality of the semiconductors that went into the\ncomputers. If that failed, it could be a real problem, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: So and then those [indecipherable] one, two and three were obsolete and then I got -- I lost the\narea of responsibilities.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Ho-How do you think the war -- I don\u2019t even know if this is a question anybody can answer.\nHo-How do you think the war changed your life or affected your life afterwards, or did -- do you\nnot think about it that much?",
        "A: I think about it every time I see a war going on someplace else. Oh, only I forgot to tell you, I\nlived in a big apartment of 11 rooms, across the street from the general\u2019s headquarter in\nMontpellier.",
        "Q: This in -- this 1s in Montpellier?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And there was two sides to it, one had four rooms -- five rooms, the other one six rooms. The\nlieutenant and his wife had one side, and I was on the other side with my parents. The lieutenant\nwas transferred out, he was a military justice officer, and I had a whole 11 rooms there. One day\na colonel from the headquarter says, \u201cLoewy, I want to talk to you. Your apartment, I want it. Il\ngive you one month to find another apartment.\u201d I said, he had collaborated with the Germans and\nhe wants me to give him the apartment? No way. A month goes by, \u201cLoewy, have you found\nsomething?\u201d I said no. He said, \u201cI'll find something for you.\u201d So he finds something and he says,\n\u201cLoewy, I want you to move out.\u201d I said, \u201cI refuse.\u201d \u201cYou what?\u201d He\u2019s -- what happened then?\nHad me called before the commander of the garrison, colonel. And they -- they say -- the two of\n-- I-I took an attorney with me. I was cautious there. You\u2019re sure [indecipherable] give up the\napartment? I said, it\u2019s not a military matter, it\u2019s a civil matter. Had nothing to do with\n[indecipherable] o-or anything else. You are refusing? Yes, I refuse. And then the other colonel\nbawls me out. Then I said to him, \u201cColonel, do you know your army regulations?\u201d Yes, I do.\n\u201cAnd you Colonel, you know your army regulations?\u201d Yes I do. \u201cWhat right do you have to talk\nto me that way in front of a non-com?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, no, you cannot insult somebody in front of a\nlower rank military.\u201d He turned all colors. And they send him out, and then that didn\u2019t happen\nagain. At two o\u2019clock in the afternoon I\u2019m called to see the general, and the general says, \u201cYou\ngot to get out of there. You have to go out, period.\u201d I tell my parents [indecipherable]\napartments, they said, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, forget about it. Let him have it.\u201d I move out of\nthere. Before I move out, I have a friend of mine in G1, which is military personnel, the French\narmy. And he says, \u201cFred, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you mean what\u2019s going on?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cThey are talking about sending you to Africa, to repatriate Senegalese troops.\u201d I said,\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said -- he says, \u201c\u201cWe know when the ships go there, we don\u2019t know when they come\nback.\u201d Oh-oh, I figured that the -- the colonel was behind it. The next day he says -- he calls me\nup in secret because clearly I wasn\u2019t supposed to know what\u2019s going on there. He says, \u201cNow\nthey are trying to send you to Vietnam -- Indo-China.\u201d Not Vietnam, Indo-China. I says, time for\nme to get out of the army. So I had signed up for the army for the duration of the war, and why I\ndid this, I put down in ink, in Europe. So the war is over in Europe. So nothing happens, nu -- so\nI figure they are going to send me out before I have a chance to get out of the army. So I send a\nletter to the general, \u201c\u201cGeneral, I demand my discharge.\u201d Nothing happens. So I just had to go one\nstep higher. I write to the war department, care of the general -- the general command. The same\nafternoon I got dischar -- discharged. They knew I wasn\u2019t going to play around then.",

        "Q: Uh-huh. Then they close the doors again, and we continue to Agde. Everybody out, it\u2019s\nmiddle of the night. We had to march to the village of Agde, you know, with luggage and\nwhatnot. Was quite a march, and then went into the camp, and they say well, go to -- guys over\nhere.

        "Q: It was good.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: I was going to say it\u2019s very practical chemistry",
        "Q: It\u2019s not theoretical.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Now why did you take this course in particular?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And when you\u2019re in Celleneuve, you -- you were Jew -- I mean, people knew that you were\nJewish, you weren't hiding the fact.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t have false papers, but you were still not you -- but people didn\u2019t know who you\nwere?",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right. Okay, we have to stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape Three",
        "Q: Fred, let\u2019s -- let me just ask you again about Agde, because you and your brother brought in\nfood --",

        "Q: Once a day you went.",
        "Q: It was a big distance, yeah.",
        "Q: But the people inside the camp would give you money?",
        "Q: And would they ask you to get certain things, or --",
        "Q: They d -- they did.",
        "Q: And how did you decide who you would w-work --",
        "Q: They just asked you.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right. So you felt responsible to do something.",
        "Q: So how much -- how long a walk was it from the camp to the village?",
        "Q: A few kilometers.",
        "Q: And --",
        "Q: Right. And you didn\u2019t have gloves, so it was very cold.",
        "Q: Right. So it must have been exhausting both psychologically and physically for you folks.",
        "Q: So this was --",
        "Q: -- this was good. And this went on for a number of months?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s December, January, February, so it is a few months.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a lot.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: To -- to look at the fake part of the camp, yes.",
        "Q: But after they leave, do they -- do they close the camp in June of --",

        "Q: Before?",
        "Q: February \u00b041.",
        "Q: So when you\u2019re at school, the ORT school --",
        "Q: -- was that in \u201941 or \u201942, do you -- do you have a -- do you remember at all?",
        "Q: Well, we can check.",
        "Q: But maybe it\u2019s \u00b042 that you\u2019re in this school.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: It was great?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: But you hadn\u2019t been to school for a few years now, right?",
        "Q: So this was just --",
        "Q: Did you carry around your dictionary with you? Is that one of the things you took?",
        "Q: No?",
        "Q: No, huh? So it\u2019s good that you had all this dictionary training beforehand, yes?",
        "Q: So in July and August of 1942, they start these raids, the Germans --",
        "Q: -- because they\u2019re occupying Vichy, no?",
        "Q: This is before?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "Q: They did?",
        "Q: But your father arranged all of this?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: But he started it.",
        "Q: So he just keeps going with these ideas?",
        "Q: But weren\u2019t you vulnerable also? Or people just didn\u2019t know who you were?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: But you couldn\u2019t do it.",
        "Q: So s --",
        "Q: No, no, go ahead.",
        "Q: Okay. But in Celleneuve there seems to be a lot of help, the people are -- are willing to be\nvery helpful to the people who are vulnerable.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And because it\u2019s unoccupied at that point, they\u2019re not vulnerable.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And so this goes on now for a few months?",
        "Q: So he didn\u2019t know you were Jewish?",
        "Q: He did?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Right, okay.",
        "Q: Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t take you, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And the German, you\u2019re bypassing the German altogether.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: The next day?",
        "Q: Did your papers say that you were Jewish?",
        "Q: I mean not Jewish, Catholic?",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t say anything?",
        "Q: And your name then was --",
        "Q: Heberg\u00e9e.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: Okay, so now you\u2019re Catholic.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: I would imagine.",
        "Q: Right, right. And besides pat\u00e9, what did you bring?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So the pat\u00e9 was a -- a big luxury.",
        "Q: So when you\u2019re staying in the annex of the hotel, did you have --",
        "Q: So, do you have a washroom, a shower --",
        "Q: A shower? You have toilet?",
        "Q: So you --",
        "Q: And where were these other Jews that you didn\u2019t know about, in the annex also --",
        "Q: -- in the main hotel?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s clearly very dangerous at this point, because the Germans can go anywhere, they ha --\nthey\u2019re occupying --",
        "Q: Other places?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So do you sort of settle down and you now have to get work in order to be able to eat, yes?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So these are big logs that you\u2019re working with, yes.",
        "Q: 12 a day for each of you?",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So you ha -- you have to do it on the right side, otherwise you\u2019re in big trouble, right?",
        "Q: Now, where was your brother? You were --",
        "Q: I see. So you and your father got the heavy work.",
        "Q: He got some food, but he didn\u2019t get paid?",
        "Q: And where is your sister and your mother at this point?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And that was okay?",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: And did you do that in order to sell these mushrooms?",
        "Q: To -- just to eat them?",
        "Q: And your mother wa -- your mother was doing the cooking, I gather.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: So she -- she didn\u2019t eat as much as she could have, yes.",
        "Q: Did you see her lose weight?",
        "Q: You di -- you all lost weight.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Hm. Fred, tell me something. What were you hearing about what was happening outside of\nFrance? Were you hearing about killing centers, were you hearing about shooting -- you",
        "Q: -- you didn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t know until after. Nothing",
        "Q: You just knew that the Germans were after the Jews, but you didn\u2019t know why, what they\nwere doing?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So no rumors came to you, nothing?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s all. So I suppose in some way it was fortunate that you didn\u2019t know anything.",
        "Q: Because your spirits would not -- so de -- as depressed as it might have been.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So how did your father have all these skills? All of a sudden he\u2019s making pants? He\u2019d never\ndone that be --",
        "Q: Well still, but I have to tell you that if you gave me a sewing machine and material, I don\u2019t\nthink I could sew a pair of pants. Could you?",
        "Q: Do you know what I mean?",
        "Q: So your father --",
        "Q: He did.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Were you able to make soap for people?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Just for this --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And so who -- to -- for whom were you making this soap?",
        "Q: And who was that?",
        "Q: Ah, she owned the toba -- and she would exchange it for tobacco, and then you would go and\nexchange the tobacco --",
        "Q: For food.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Did other people find out that you were making soap?",
        "Q: So you\u2019re --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: But -- but your class was very helpful then?",
        "Q: Right. So how hungry were you, Fred?",
        "Q: You were very hungry.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Per person?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Rutabaga.",
        "Q: Artichokes?",
        "Q: So when you say they were -- they were rationing, that means that everybody in the area was\npresumably going to get the same food, am I right?",
        "Q: Had more.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So if you were good at trading, you had more.",
        "Q: If -- and if you had more to trade with, yes.",
        "Q: But most people -- would you say that most people were really suffering during this period?",
        "Q: So they had enough.",
        "Q: So it was the refugees.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: It\u2019s very clever.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: I think we have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Four",
        "Q: Fred, you were mentioning to me about checks that you were receiving that you still don\u2019t\nknow --",
        "Q: Who sent them.",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: I bet it was.",
        "Q: How did it come to you? It wouldn\u2019t come to your place, would it? How did you --",
        "Q: At the post office.",
        "Q: I see. Huh.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "Q: They tore them up?",
        "Q: And this was because the resistance was working in various places in that small town, but you\ndidn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t know this at the time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: There\u2019s an incident where police come, or SS come, I don\u2019t know who it is, comes to your\nhouse and they look through the house?",
        "Q: And -- but they miss what would have been very revealing, am I right?",
        "Q: May I ask you something? Isn\u2019t it odd that he didn\u2019t lift up -- everybody knows that there\u2019s a -\n- a tray.",
        "Q: Right? You just lift it up.",
        "Q: Do you think he did that on purpose? You don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: Was that your dog?",
        "Q: Did you have a dog?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: And how did the dog help?",
        "Q: Right. So when did you get the dog?",
        "Q: When did you get the dog?",
        "Q: He was\u2019?",
        "Q: That\u2019s pretty scary.",
        "Q: Once they walked out you collapsed?",
        "Q: Do you think they would have just killed you on the spot?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: And that would have been -- yeah.",
        "Q: Did you think of, after this incident, putting all of these things that could reveal who you are\nsomeplace else? Bury them or something?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. So did you leave them in the house after this, still?",
        "Q: So a -- I see, it wouldn\u2019t have worked. Did you know that there was a lot -- there were a lot of\npeople in the resistance in this area, or --",
        "Q: Nobody talked that much.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So tell me something, how does it happen that you and Max go into the resistance? What --\nwhat circumstances s-so that you could get in there in the first place?",
        "Q: But how did you know that that was the resistance?",
        "Q: Yeah, how did you know?",
        "Q: Now, did you talk -- talk about this with your parents?",
        "Q: You just did it?",
        "Q: Were you living with your parents at the time?",
        "Q: And did they know that you were involved, or didn\u2019t they know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So then they found out.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And were they unhappy that you were doing this, or what?",
        "Q: They were happy?",
        "Q: Your -- your parents.",
        "Q: They had doubts.",
        "Q: So w -- did this mean that your parents were not safe? Or were they safer because you were in\nthe resistance? Or didn\u2019t it matter?",
        "Q: So that you were strangers --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So they knew which side you were on, and then --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: But let me ask you something. How do you actually -- why did they even trust you? You just\nwent up to them and say we want to join you? I mean, what did -- wh-what did you actually do to\njoin?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: They -- they knew.",
        "Q: That was okay.",
        "Q: Did they know you were Jewish? No.",
        "Q: Did they ask?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So, when you weren't doing guard duty at night or doing something at night, did you go back\nhome to your parents?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: And your father at this point is doing what? He\u2019s -- he\u2019s working?",
        "Q: He wasn\u2019t?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: And who slaughtered the sheep, the resistance and gave them food -- I mean ho -- how did it\nwork?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: The food out.",
        "Q: Right. So, did your parents then have more food than they had before?",
        "Q: But they ha -- now they had meat?",
        "Q: And is your sister working?",
        "Q: No. So --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: But was she getting some money, or not?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: She was just getting some food while she was there.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: So your -- your parents and your sister are not in a great position at this point?",
        "Q: So did you and Max think that being in the resistance would be helpful, then? I mean, is that\none of the reasons why --",
        "Q: So you felt you had nothing to lose by doing it?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right. Did you feel in the resistance group that you were French or you were Jewish? Was\nthere --",
        "Q: French.",
        "Q: And you -- and you really felt that?",
        "Q: Or was this your -- your mask?",
        "Q: Right. That was -- that was present, yes.",
        "Q: So were you immediately when you got into the resistance, were you trained right away, or\ndid that take awhile?",
        "Q: And this is -- is this \u00b042 or \u201943? This \u201943?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you went and stole them?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So what\u2019d you do? You kept trying to find the right one for the right --",
        "Q: Right. So was there someone there to train -- you had never had a gun in your hand before.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Oh, you did?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, I bet he was.",
        "Q: Did you feel comfortable around weapons?",
        "Q: You did?",
        "Q: And was that mainly because you -- y-you knew who the enemy was, or does --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right. Huh. So when was it that Aaron Bank came into your life?",
        "Q: And what does that mean, Jedburgh?",
        "Q: You got no other weapons?",
        "Q: You -- you got no weapons?",
        "Q: Not right away, uh-huh.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: The ammunition was different?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So were these parachuted in, the weapons?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And Aaron Bank also parachuted in to this area?",
        "Q: Right, right. Now why would he parachute into that area? Was it known that there were a lot\nof maquis in the area?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Okay, we -- we need to change the tape.",
        "Q: So, y-you are with Aaron Bank being trained during the spring of 1944, the early summer of\n19 --",
        "Q: In August.",
        "Q: So how long are you in the resistance before you get this training, do you think? Six months,\nthree months?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: No, I understand that --",
        "Q: -- but you joined the resistance before Aaron Bank came into the picture.",
        "Q: In June?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a different sort of a concept of resistance, that actually something\u2019s happening that in a\nway you don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Right, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re putting you all together to try and get you to --",
        "Q: I see, right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So how many people were in your group, about 20, or was there more?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: With -- with these other people.",
        "Q: But you\u2019re trained by Colonel Banks for a few days, that\u2019s all?",
        "Q: And then you were supposed to be organized well enough to go in to battle of some kind?",
        "Q: So a few days after you get trained, you\u2019re actually in your first battle?",
        "Q: Right. You want to explain what happened?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: In her -- in her -- in her bra?",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "Q: No cell phones, huh?",
        "Q: I was going to say, you\u2019re just like your father, right, but you were no -- you were what, 19?",
        "Q: 1944.",
        "Q: And this is your first --",
        "Q: First combat.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: No, but that came after the war.",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: They had 20 trucks?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "Q: Wait a minute, excuse me. Is there something -- there a problem? [inaudible]. All right, so\nyou're --",
        "Q: Right",
        "Q: Because you could have hit them.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So you tried to stop the bleeding?",
        "Q: You tried to stop the bleeding.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And what happened to the Communists who went up to the --",
        "Q: They were take --",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t kill them?",
        "Q: Oh. So that was your first experience. Did it make you want to not do it again?",
        "Q: I see. Were you frightened? At the end, I mean, did it -- did you think, oh my God, what\u2019s --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Now is Max with you also?",
        "Q: And what did he think of the fact that you took this over? Was he shocked?",
        "Q: He was with you.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "Q: Or you can be old and done, right.",
        "Q: Now, would there -- were there other skirmishes, were --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: But did -- did you know this?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know that.",
        "Q: Afterwards.",
        "Q: So it was good you never --",
        "Q: -- you never asked these guys to turn around.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: Is it a mess kit?",
        "Q: Is it a mess kit, yeah.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right. Now the end of August, something really terrible happened when you were --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Fred?",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to stop you now, because I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t want to stop you in the middle of the\nstory, so let\u2019s stop the tape now.",
        "Q: We have to change the tape.",
        "Q: So | --",
        "Q: Okay. I\u2019m sorry for the interruption.",
        "Q: So you were in battle for seven hours --",
        "Q: -- and you were in the stronger position, and nevertheless you still weren\u2019t able to stop them.",
        "Q: Yeah, they couldn\u2019t -- I see.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Not many Germans in that group?",
        "Q: When was your brother buried? Soon after?",
        "Q: So you were the one who told them?",
        "Q: You were the one who told them that -- that Max was dead, or --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: It must have been awful.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: 800.",
        "Q: At that point -- it was a kind of liberation at that point?",
        "Q: In August of \u00b044?",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "Q: So you have very little mourning period for your brother. I mean, you\u2019re home for a couple of\ndays and then you have to go back.",
        "Q: Was that be -- was that better for you, that you could go back and work?",
        "Q: You wanted to go back?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t want you to go back.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t object.",
        "Q: Do you think they were afraid that something would happen to you?",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t say",
        "Q: And is that because your brother was killed so that you could not be in the armed resistance\nany more, or was this because there was liberation at that --",
        "Q: There was nothing to do.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So it was different for you. So now you are in the intelligence.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: German manuals?",
        "Q: So did you translate that?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what it is, that\u2019s the end of that.",
        "Q: A waiter?",
        "Q: Where\u2019d they put him?",
        "Q: To the mine fields.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: You were -- you were a -- you were a mean guy, yeah?",
        "Q: The-They did what you asked?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Right. Were you also in charge of military mapping?",
        "Q: What was that -- what does that mean?",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: 20,000?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: When -- when your parents go back to Montpellier --",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "Q: Do you then go back with them and live with them and --",
        "Q: -- and still work in the armed -- and -- and are you based in Montpellier now?",
        "Q: You are.",
        "Q: In Montpellier.",
        "Q: Now, was this money given to men, or to both men and women?",
        "Q: Right. Now, there\u2019s this period --",
        "Q: More men came back. Many more men.",
        "Q: Not many men either.",
        "Q: But not that many anyway.",
        "Q: The period that you\u2019re in the resistance --",
        "Q: -- there\u2019s a kind of silence about what your father is doing. Did -- do you not know what he\u2019s\ndoing during that period of time, because the war is over, and then he starts up immediately to --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So how soon after the war do you -- or after your liberation, do you discover what had gone\non in eastern Europe, and the murder of the Jews? Do you -- was it months, was it later than that?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: And then they told you.",
        "Q: So this must have been a huge shock to you.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: It\u2019s -- right. Did that -- was that extremely depressing to you? I mean, what were --",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I guess they were realizing the situation was worse than they thought, and they had to\nleave earlier.",
        "A: So we had actually left the house with a few things on our back, and a bicycle. We figured,\noh, we are going to be gone for a short time, and be back soon, so we didn\u2019t take too much,\nexcept what we could take with us. Silverware, and food, and that\u2019s about it, you know. So my\nfather decides we are going to walk.",
        "A: On the road, on the road. So we go south, and there is a Protestant minister, he comes along\nwith a horse drawn carriage, and he seems to realize what goes on, and he invites my sister and\nmy mother on the cart, because he had room for two people. And he rides on a few miles, and --\nkilometers, and drops them off when he takes it off-road. We, in the meantime catch up with my\nmom and sister, and quickly walking, I\u2019m not sure how lo -- how far we walking, we must have\nwalked between eight and 10 miles. Along comes this army truck that 1s going back -- was\nretreating, and they pick us up. With the bicycle, too. That was wonderful. There was nobody\nelse on the road except us.",
        "A: When the minister left us, he says, \u201cGod be wi -- wi -- will be with you.\u201d He realized what\nwas going on. And so we --",

        "A: Other ones may not have the means, or no -- no car, or so --",
        "A: Remember that the French army had the authority to requisition cars for their needs.",
        "A: Because there are only so many army trucks or whatnot, and they had all -- also requisitioned\nour car.",
        "A: The military. So we didn\u2019t have transportation.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Well, we were very concerned, of course. We were not pleased to -- to leave, you know, on\nfoot or so. But we thought it was an emergency, and my parents know what\u2019s best for us.",
        "A: So the truck drove us for some distance, and had dropped us off. Along comes this so --\nyoung recruit, actually it was a civilian in a car, and he has orders to report to a certain area. So\nhe takes us on. We are driving down to Dole... Dijon, that area, and things got very hot. There\nwas a big tank -- gas tank, burning. I\u2019m not sure if the army had done it to destroy it, or if the\nGermans had machine-gunned it, but it was burning at night. That gave us a chance to drive at\nnight with, you know -- but at that point we run into traffic.",
        "A: And got really hectic. If somebody run out of gas, or had a pa -- had a problem with his car,\nthe cars behind him stopped, pushed him off the road, with the people inside.",
        "A: Nothing get in the way. They had to go on. It was terrible. There 1s no es -- it\u2019s me, me, me\nand I don\u2019t care about anybody else.",
        "A: It was very scary, especially when they don\u2019t let the people get out of the car.",
        "A: Yes. And we got to [indecipherable], we got to Rouen, we got into a train, and oh, the\nd\u00e9mission gave us permission to go on any train, 1n any -- get any assistance from the military or\ncivilians. So the train stops a few miles down, and they tell us to get out. No, the -- at -- the train\nstops in the station, and there\u2019s a Italian plane flying over. And we say, oh gosh, they were\nmachine gunners.",
        "A: They -- it was in front of our compartment, it was a flatbed with a machine gun, right, a\nFrench machine gun, and about three or four French soldiers. That was a bad situation because\ncivilians and military -- if you see troops there, you have a right to shoot at them.",
        "A: If you believe in the Geneva Convention that civilians are protected.",
        "A: Then came the order, all civilians off the train. We are expecting an attack by Italian planes.\nSo we get out of the station. I think it was just a trick. The French authorities want to have the\ntrain to themselves to put more troops on there. We go outside of the station and there my father\nmeets a couple from Frankfurt -- he never knew -- I mean, he knew who they were, and they\ndidn\u2019t speak French. And they were -- then we -- we gave them, we talked to them. They owned\na movie -- a -- a movie 1-in Frankfurt, and my parents knew about that. So they said, what are\nyou doing here? They said, well, they\u2019re here from Belgium, they had escaped from Belgium,\nand they were completely lost. So my father decides, we are going back on the train now. And he\nsays, \u201cYou come with us, and don\u2019t say a word.\u201d There is a soldier there with a fixed bayonet to\nprevent people from going on. My father says, \u201cYou follow me.\u201d And we go by, he presents the\norder, and we walk right through. The soldier did not even have time to read it. He let us go by. I\nmean, my father bluffed him.",
        "A: Get back on the train -- excuse me -- and then the train takes off.",
        "A: I guess h-he -- he surprised me, but I know I -- I just follow orders. He says, you know -",
        "A: Oh, it surprised me very, yes. Especially because the people there --",
        "A: -- come with us, and -- and have their luggage, too, you know? So --",
        "A: It\u2019s a decision -- they have -- time to make a decision.",
        "A: Then we go on the train, and now in the com-compartment there are some ci-civilians coming\non, and there is a guy from the -- a civilian, he has a French army pack with him.",
        "A: Pack.",
        "A: A --a--a-- for a -- outfit.",
        "A: Right. He was in c -- 1-in civilian clothes. And the -- the gendarmes are coming now, and\nchecking for deserters. My father says to the guy, \u201cYou better throw that pack out or they\u2019re\ngoing to arrest you.\u201d Because he was a desert-serter. So he threw the pack out.

        "A: Yeah, bread.",
        "A: We had -- that\u2019s all we had is bread at the time. We -- we shared it with them. And then we\nstopped in the station, and th-there was a wine -- there was another tr-train on the other side of\nthe rail, and we looked out there, there\u2019s a -- a soldier laying on the floor. The train had been\nmachine gunned, and this was a tank truck of wine, full of holes, and the soldiers were just\nlaying down letting the wine go into his mouth. He was so amusing, you know.",
        "A: He was [indecipherable] doing it for free, you know?",
        "A: I mean -- and then we go back on the train. We didn\u2019t get -- we didn\u2019t get off the train\nbecause we didn\u2019t want to t-take a chance on train leaving and leave us behind.",
        "A: Yes. Different station, we run out of water, so farmers come over and sell us water, at a franc,\none franc per glass.",

        "A: Knock on the door, and then they had these inspectors -- inspector, and come with us, they\nasked us. They put us in what they call a black Mar -- Maria, this is a police wagon, and I said,\n\u201cWhy you are arrestings us?\u201d Don\u2019t ask questions.",
        "A: No, the French police.",
        "A: And they pick up -- and they go from house to house, where they have foreigners, and they\npick them up. And they were all Jewish except two -- some Russians. The cart is full now, and\nthen I found out later what th -- the course was. The French government in Lotrower issued an\norder that all those who came to France after 1936 should be sent to concentration camp.",
        "A: But the authorities had also the latitude to arrest anybody that came before 1936.",
        "A: And prefect did not like Jews particularly, so he said it doesn\u2019t make a difference what the --\ntime they came in here.",
        "A: As long as -- yes, take them. The reason originally of that was that France, Vichy government\nwas against Communists, came from Spain, from the 1936 revolution. So, they had those in mind\nfirst, and then anybody that came from Belgium, Holland and Germany, and [indecipherable]\nafter \u00b036.",
        "A: In 1940, in November. 1940.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Then we were put in small camp, I forgot the name of it, Recebedou, or an --",
        "A: Yes, this was in the area of Toulouse.",
        "A: So, my father knew somebody in the prefecture, in the governor\u2019s office, who had just -- you\nsigned in -- as foreigner you had to register.",
        "A: So he said, maybe this guy can help us out. So he asked the camp commander, captain -- the\ncamp was actually surrounded by boy scouts, that\u2019s what I had -- in charge of the camp.\n[indecipherable] captain --",
        "A: No, no, this is to --",
        "A: -- near Toulouse, near -- near Toulouse, yes.",
        "A: I -- Iremember it was --",
        "A: Boy scouts. They -- th-they not -- they didn\u2019t arrest the people, they let them go in and out if\nthey had some justification. It wasn\u2019t a camp to hold them.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: So my father asked the captain to be authorized to go to Toulouse to meet this man from\nprefecture. Okay, fine. So him and my fa -- and my sister hitchhiked to Toulouse, there was the\nprefecture -- to see this man, and thi -- they ask him, why didn\u2019t you tell us that the workers who\nare [indecipherable] you know, you could have given us a warning. The guy sh-shook his sh-\nshoulders. You know. Sorry about that, you know. I cannot do anything for you. They go back to\nthe camp because we are still there [indecipherable] us, my mom, my brother and me.",
        "A: And then they say okay, everybody let\u2019s march railroad station. They pug u -- put us ina\ncattle car. French have a fancy name for it, eight horses or 40 men, huit hommes -- quarante\nhommes ou huit chevaux, eight men -- o-or eight horses.",
        "A: And put us in there. No windows. So it had maybe a small opening for air. And the cabin had\na few other people in it. And the train goes on the way, for hours and hours and hours. At night\nwe arrive, I believe is Montpellier. And in Montpellier they open up the door, and they let Red\nCross nurses give us some water.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. We were sleeping, at --",
        "A: -- five o\u2019clock in the morning.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was, it was.",
        "A: Fi -- 40 -- 40 -- yeah, right, right.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We never expected.",
        "A: No. I mean, after all, you live in France, so you don\u2019t expect have a-anybody, whether they\nwere foreigners, or -- or -- or -- or French, or --",
        "A: -- or came before or after [indecipherable]. There was no -- we did not know of the law, of the\n\u201836 law.",
        "A: No, found out afterwards.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It was only through the authorities, so they could go ahead --",
        "A: -- and people [indecipherable] themselves and -- and disappear.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Just get dressed --",
        "A: -- go. Yeah.",
        "A: Well, we had -- well, I should say there was a -- a few things, possibly, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: We lib -- we did not have time to pack, nothing. Just --",
        "A: -- what you -- what you can carry, you know [indecipherable]",
        "A: I -- I guess [indecipherable] because yes, we had some things we could carry, like clothing or\nwhatever.",
        "A: But [indecipherable] you know.",
        "A: That is right.",
        "A: That is correct.",
        "A: We are just -- we are leaving this behind there.",
        "A: Yes.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Excuse me, it is fa -- term, atelier, is a -- that was a concentration [indecipherable]",
        "A: Atelier, it\u2019s atel -- yeah, atelier.",
        "A: Yes, exactly.",
        "A: Yes, and we were tired, we slept. About six o\u2019clock in the morning, everybody has to get out,\nwash. They had a big -- a big pipe for water in the -- from faucets --",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] put a trough there, and we wash up, and then they serve us black coffee,\nno sugar, nothing, and I guess they gave us a -- a bread for four people. We cut it up in pieces,\nand took turns. Every time they serve bread, the f -- they were changed as a priority, one guy had\nthe -- the choice first, and the next one next time. So he could get the largest piece.",
        "A: It was -- you know, we were hungry, and it was very important to get as much food as you\ncould.",
        "A: One of the four.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, we were not -- my -- my wife -- my mother and my sister were in a different camp.",
        "A: But we -- yes, but we -- we took from the whole barrack, they just took four people, any four.",
        "A: And -- and here\u2019s the bread, divide it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I stay with them.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We were like two people on one bunk.",
        "A: And usually -- and -- and then there were about over 40 people in the whole barrack, I think.",
        "A: 40.",
        "A: No, [indecipherable] barracks, but not huge, no.",
        "A: What happened later on is -- I\u2019Il tell you about this one. [indecipherable] was very cold, and\nhe took an old bench -- they had the stove there --",
        "A: -- it was op -- operating. And he took a bench, broke it up somehow, and he started a fire.\nWell, somehow or other somebody reported him, the guy who was in charge of the barrack, I\nbelieve, and then they put him in jail, in the brig for a few days.",
        "A: Yeah. They [indecipherable]",
        "A: Not very well.",
        "A: No. Orders are orders, you cannot -- you are going to freeze, you\u2019re going to freeze, you\nknow?",
        "A: Oh no.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: At that time, no.",
        "A: Because we had left in the summertime, in June, think -- no, I take that back. No, that was it.\nWe did not have any coats then.",
        "A: We got some coats later on, in Montpellier. But -- so we were there for about four or five days\nI believe, and [indecipherable] in the morning, get your breakfast -- breakfast. My brother and I\nwere designated to go in the kitchen to work peeling potatoes. So the guys already give us a little\nfood they throw on the side, you know. But that just lasted one time, one day.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It wa -- a few hours one day.",
        "A: But the -- the guys [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, the guy gave us a few things, but --",
        "A: -- th-then [indecipherable] so then what happened is the camp commander let people go out\nsometimes if they had to go to see a dentist or a doctor or so.",
        "A: He gave them a permit for a few hours. While they were out in the city, in the village, that is\nto say, they sometimes were able to buy stuff for themselves or for other people, too.",
        "A: And they brought in food. That helped. If those -- if you had money, you could buy some\nstuff, you know. Well, when we realized that you could go out of certain -- on certain conditions,\nwe decided -- my father decided, let\u2019s see if we can go out completely, permanently. So he --\nthere was a -- a young lady in the cap -- captain\u2019s office, a st-stenographer. And my sister was\nwith her [indecipherable] in the same camp with the -- barrack with the woman, and she says,\nyou know, they need another s -- not stenographer, dactylo, a --a typist.",
        "A: And w-why don\u2019t you apply for a job? So my s -- my sister said okay. So she applies for the\njob, and she was there a few days, my father says, you know, ask if I can go to a od -- to a -- the\nprefecture in Montpellier, to see the governor. Just like that.",
        "A: Wel -- we had -- we had visiting times.",
        "A: Yes. Ev -- every --",
        "A: No, every so often.",
        "A: Within a few days, or maybe a few times 1n a week.",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2019m not going to be here, I\u2019m not going to stay here.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Right. And -- at that time we did not know the 36 -- 1936 law.",
        "A: So my father -- my -- my sister is performing very satisfactorily for her --",
        "A: -- captain, and my father says, \u201cAsk for permit to go to Montpellier,\u201d for her and him, because\nsh -- he didn\u2019t speak French. Captain says fine, but he had hostages there, my mom, and my\nbrother and me --",
        "A: -- so he was not afraid he was -- escape.",
        "A: Fine, so they go to Montpellier, find out where the prefecture is, where the prefect\u2019s office is,\nand in the hallway, they\u2019re already down there and this man comes towards them, and they look\nat each other. The man says, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d That was Camille Ernst.",
        "A: Partner before. Father says, \u201c\u201cWe\u2019re at camp in Agde.\u201d So he says, \u201cWhat? You are free.\u201d And\nhe releases us either way, and he says to my father, are there more people that you know -- and\nhe explained to my father what the story was with the 1936 law, but you were here before. So he\nsays, \u201cDo you know more people in the same situation that came before 1936 in the camp?\u201d Off\nthe top of his head my father had met people already in the camp, in the barrack, and he\nremembered -- thought of 36 people including us five.",
        "A: And Ernst puts all the names down on the same list, he says they are all free. Then he says, \u201cI\nwant you to stay in the camp of Agde, and in the village of Agde.\u201d My father says \u201cWhy?\u201d He\nsays, \u201cI want you to help free all the people that can be freed from the camp.\u201d He was -- a hand\nto the heart. So my father says, \u201cWell, how can they po -- ho-how can they be freed? What does\nit need to be [indecipherable].\u201d He says, \u201cIf they have the means, they came -- first of all, they\nhave to be in France since before 1936. They have to have the resources to exist in France\nwithout falling in the charge of the French government.\u201d That was important.",
        "A: About a year, if I remember correctly.",
        "A: And my father says, \u201cThat\u2019s nice. How about people who have no money?\u201d He says, \u201cWe\nwill find a way.\u201d And -- okay, so my father and my sister come back, my father sees -- become --\nright away I see him, he says, \u201cKeep your mouth shut, but we are free.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to cause\na panic in the -- in the barrack, you know, people getting all excited. And then he explains --",
        "A: A pass.",
        "A: What happened -- he gave them the list, the whole list actually, and -- had to be turned in o\nthe captain of the camp.",
        "A: He was in charge of the police. He was under the prefect, the second in charge. He wa -- his\ntitle was secretaire generale, and he looked at the -- looked from Dr. Zuco -- Zu --",
        "A: Yes, Zuccottt.",
        "A: And [indecipherable] secretaire generale. Him, and then the other gentleman who was\nworking for him. Actually, everybody w-working for him. You know he reported to --",
        "A: -- governor -- excuse me -- Mr. Verdi -- Berdetti.",
        "A: Yes, he says, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to cause a panic. H-He da -- spoke to the\nindividuals from the barrack who were going to be freed. There wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] they had\ntheir wives too, you know.",
        "A: Just fo --",
        "A: But he called them up one at a time, and told them, keep your mouth shut, but you are free\ntomorrow, you'll get out. So the list was in the hands of the captain, an he issued individuals --\nindividual releases. That\u2019s why our release has a number of blanks, about four or five lines, but it\nwas actually a whole list of people. So he issued that for [indecipherable]",
        "A: Tassart.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No question. Orders are orders.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: We did not tell, and the next morning we were -- we ready to go. That\u2019s where they found out\nthat the -- a few people ba -- not just us, but a few other ones --",
        "A: -- were released. And then they asked, how come they\u2019re released? Well, we came before\n1936.",
        "A: That camp was a whole bunch of Spanish internees, because they came after \u201936. They had\nbeen interned because they -- lots of them were Communists --",
        "A: And that the French didn\u2019t care for them [indecipherable]. Even though Germany became an\nally of the German -- of the Russians -- the Communists --",
        "A: -- the French did not -- didn\u2019t say [indecipherable].",
        "A: No.",
        "A: For Germans it was just an expedient to occupy part of fro -- Poland, you know. And so we\ntook the train and we -- somehow I guess we wound up in the Jewish organization, and we asked\nthem to help us find a place. And we ran out of funds at that time, because we could not go back\nto -- Alsace was occupied. The banks, everything had been seized.",
        "A: So we were running out of money. They helped us out there.",
        "A: In Montpellier.",
        "A: Montpellier",
        "A: Yes. To that Jewish organization. And they were helping all the refugees --",
        "A: -- that was the funds from the Jewish organizations, from the United States. Then, we met\nsomebody over there, and we ask him if he knew where they had places for rent. And he says,\n\u201cYes, come with us. I live in Celleneuve,\u201d which is small village outside of Montpellier, we rode\nup a trolley car. Went over there, we found this home. It was not the fanciest place, it has a stable\nunderneath there, but hey, we lived there, that\u2019s it. So we stayed there for the first time, in ce --\nin Celleneuve, let\u2019s see. These people are from Belgium, and they lived in the same village.\nUnfortunately, they are on the -- okay, then, later on came ins-instructions to arrest the people, I\nthink it was in the s-summer of 1942. They had what they call razzias, r-a-z-z -- double z - 1-a-s,\nor rafles, r-a - one f - I-e-s. And they just came, gendarmes a-arrested -- no, they arrested at\ncertain cell blocks, homes. And they searched anybody in the street. If they see you walk into a\nhallway, they would hassle you, because they knew that you were trying to hide. So they check\nidentity [indecipherable]. Then the -- if they had the ideas that you came to France after \u00b036, they\ntook you in right away, arrested you. At that time, my father had connections with the boy\nscouts, the leader. He [indecipherable] in one of the books by Ann Latour, which was\n[indecipherable] here, was sold in the museum, and [indecipherable] name. Anyway, we found\nplaces for some of the people, hiding places.",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah. I --",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. So, when he stayed in Agde, then he went to the camp commander,\nTassart, who helped him out, sort out who was there before 1936 --",
        "A: -- this was [indecipherable]",
        "A: And my father approached him, he says, \u201cYou can be free if you meet certain requirements.\u201d\n1936, and means of -- of existing on the outside. \u201cBut,\u201d he says, \u201cyou must also help people who\nhave no funds. You must lend it to them, and they give back to you when they get out.\u201d Because\nthis was another of -- transaction outside the [indecipherable]",
        "A: So the -- okay, and my father was able to get about 1500 people out this way.",
        "A: It was -- oh yes, oh yes. It was from November to February or March, just before we went to\nMontpellier. This was --",
        "A: -- in Agde.",
        "A: \u00b040 to \u00b041.",
        "A: About.",
        "A: I believe so. Now what happened at that time -- so these people were free. The other thing\nhappened. Ernst told my father, you know, I suspect anybody -- somebody over here 1s writing\ndown the serial numbers of the bills.",
        "A: So we became money launderers, we trade the bills so there was always constant new supply.",
        "A: My brother, my sister and me.",
        "A: The three of us. Went to grocery stores, we went to banks. We -- or so -- we brought food into\nthe camp, too. So people gave us the money to buy food for them, and so we had a-an exchange\nalso.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: I have one here from my mom and my father. And the passport is for every day, seven days a\nweek. From eight o\u2019clock in the morning til seven o\u2019clock at night, that\u2019s 11 hours. That wa --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know about the other camps. I don\u2019t know, I --",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "A: But this camp, because of Ernst, was very important.",
        "A: And I have the original pass with me.",
        "A: Well, every time people were freed, they had to get to Montpellier. And so they were\naccompa -- accompanied by either my father, or my si -- [indecipherable] my father, my sister or\nmy sister [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah. Because they had to go through [indecipherable] over there. They didn\u2019t had -- excuse\nme -- they couldn\u2019t send somebody to the camp.",
        "A: And then show the money [indecipherable], no, had to be [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: So they gave it to my sister --",
        "A: -- to take back.",
        "A: To [indecipherable] the list, and then --",
        "A: -- return the money to people.",
        "A: Well, they went to Jewish Committee to help them out.",
        "A: Montpellier.",
        "A: That\u2019s where they were hiding, in Montpellier, at that point. So --",
        "A: They were helped, yes. Some had the visa to go to other countries, they had visa to go to\nPortugal. We have a very important pa -- place to go through it, to go to the United States.",
        "A: Because if you had a visa from the United States, you had to go through port -- Spain or\nPortugal, and many people waited in Portugal for their American visas to come through.",
        "A: So the Joint Distribution or other organizations helped them out monetarily to go to --",
        "A: -- these places.",
        "A: Well, as long as we knew Ernst, we felt very safe.",
        "A: I forgot to say also, in those days they have also soup kitchen for all the refugees. Food, the --\neither the Red Cross or other organizations had food, they sit -- they u -- went to those places. So\nthe people who came out of the camp, and us too for awhile, ate in those places because we had\nno resources, you know?",
        "A: SO --",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: It -- it was not -- it was not that much food, either.",
        "A: Or choice, but they --",
        "A: -- better than nothing.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: SO --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: It were very idle, no.",
        "A: I -- and then also, Montpellier, you had the Red Cross distributed clothing, and also the --\nwhat was it called? Not the [indecipherable], the foundation army distributed clothing over there,\ntoo. A reg --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: For -- from the United States that they donated. So that\u2019s where we got our first clothes, my\nbrother and me. It was like a pillorin they call it, it -- it was a [indecipherable] without sleeves,\nexcept it had openings [indecipherable]",
        "A: Exactly, that\u2019s what it 1s.",
        "A: This was good for rain, you know.",
        "A: For you got your hands free. You didn't --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: You know, they had the -- plenty of supplies. They had a lot of supplies.",
        "A: But they could not bring them into the camp.",
        "A: No. By the way, it was where the camp [indecipherable] in there, there was someone, and we\nsuspect 1t was an American journalist that was there, and it was behind the barrier that\n[indecipherable] and the gendarmes were with him, so a few of us made a sign, \u201cNous avons\nfaim.\u201d We are hungry. We moved that towards him. The gendarmes [indecipherable] too close,\nand I hope he saw the sign.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t force us to go back.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Thousands.",
        "A: Yes. I don\u2019t [indecipherable] thousands -- I\u2019d say probably between three and 4000, probably.\nThat means just the women --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They were Spaniards, and also military, foreign troops like Czechs. And I -- I don\u2019t remember\n[indecipherable] of Polish troops, but they were supposed to go to Africa when Germany won the\nwar.",
        "A: But then they got stuck, there with no ships to take them to Africa, so they put them in the\ncamp.",
        "A: You -- you --",
        "A: A passport from a -- if you came from foreign countries, or even from France that you had a -\n- your foreigner card. And a foreigner carte \u00e9trang\u00e9re, has a pa -- passport when you came in --\nha-has a card showing when you came in.",
        "A: And then, the worst that happened [indecipherable]. Then they decided to enter the camp and\ntransfer everybody to the camp of Rivesaltes.",
        "A: Which is near the Pyrenees, and there are terrible conditions. It was near the sea, and they had\nthe, I guess water running close by a-and the rain and whatnot.",
        "A: And so the camp commander, Tassart, said, \u201cWell, I'd like to send a delegation of the people\nto Rivesaltes to see how the conditions are, so they can convince the people in the camp that\nthings are not that bad over there the way [indecipherable].\u201d It was one of those, what do you call\nit? There was a Russian general who made fake visitors [indecipherable]",

        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Correct. I know of one of the people that went to -- like, it was part of the [indecipherable] it\nwas called Rubenstein. He was from Frankfurt and my parents knew him, and he had a son of\nour age, too. And he was wa -- allowed somehow to come to Montpellier [indecipherable] camp\nand he went to our house even, but he had to go back to the camp.",
        "A: But he was one of the guys that was blindsided, I -- you know, just told him hey, it\u2019s so\nbeautiful over here, and they showed him the -- how many things that were favorable to show to\n-- to the French -- to the internees.",

        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, it -- the instructor was from Poland, and he was -- he trained us. He was a -- also a\nrefugee [indecipherable]. He -- I saw him in pa -- in -- in New York when I came back, when I\ncame over here. I looked him up in the phone book, and tried to get a job, and he took me to his\nchemistry factory in Bayonne, and they were -- offered me a job.

        "A: They asked us, you know?",

        "A: So th-that already started before.",
        "A: So for us it was just a matter of stepping in there and help them out too. We had been through\nthese horrible few days, and we were lucky, it was just a few days.",

        "A: Our hands were frozen. But we did not worry about that because we felt we had to do this.",

        "A: Yes.",

        "A: -- and before that -- and we located places to hide.",
        "A: People to hide with, food. My father had this one friend of his who had a restaurant,\nTellenbaum, and he provided food. The boy scouts went to different donors or so, they collected\nthe food. They distributed it to the homes, not on a daily basis, because that would have attracted\nattention. So that every two days or three days, they will bring a supply for a few days, so as not\nto arouse the people there to see wha -- what goes on there, you know? They found abandoned\nhouses like that -- things like that. The best place to hide was hospitals.",
        "A: The food was available. You did not have to bring anything in. Doctors and nurses\ncooperated.",
        "A: They put people in beds, and we -- we were [indecipherable]. That was very -- these were --\nthese were doctors and Red Cross people and -- and nurses, these are not Jewish. Everybody\ncooperated. Not just -- not just --",

        "A: But --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Because we knew that people were going to be getting arrested, we had to hide them, you\nknow?",
        "A: We weren\u2019t vulnerable because we knew Ernst. He was in charge of police.",
        "A: At that point. Now, the people that lived in the same village as we did, Celleneuve, the\ndaughter was arrested. And we tried to get her freed out, couldn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- couldn\u2019t [indecipherable] no. Then the pers -- the family hid us later on, too. This was\nbefore --",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: This was before the Germans occupied southern France.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m talking about people who are French citizens basically, because they were not\nsubject to any persecution.",
        "A: Because they were French citizens.",
        "A: Th-They fall under \u201936 law -- 1936 law.",
        "A: Correct, correct.",
        "A: Yes, and then the razzias ended the end of -- by August or suppose -- early September, I\nbelieve, they stopped. Then the allies landed in North Africa on August -- on November eighth,\n1942. On November 11\" [indecipherable] Armistice day for World War I, the Germans invaded\nFrance, and then it was time to leave. So we go to prefecture, my father and my sister, and they\nas -- ask for false identification. He sends them to a place where a Catholic religious -- religious\nman -- I\u2019m not sure what they call that, it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s an order of the Catholic religion. And then they\nhad a period of time where the man -- the [indecipherable] had no contact with the outside. He\nsends my sister and me over there to ask for the false identification. We have about four pictures,\nI didn\u2019t have any of my mom at the time. We go there, and the abbey in Chanione d\u2019 Aussac,\nd\u2019Aussac, d\u2018A-u-s-s-a-c. He sees us, he opens the door, he says, for that purpose I am not going\nto go according [indecipherable] religion. This is important, he has to help us. Then he sends us\nto a mail drop, a Catholic library, to pick up the documents over there. The document -- the\nCatholic library was --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, we -- we told him.",
        "A: Because Ernst sent us to him.",
        "A: I guess he must have called -- talk -- telephoned [indecipherable] first, because otherwise he\nwould never [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right. And then they sent us to librarie Catholic, which is a mail drop for the social security\noffice service of the resistance. I didn\u2019t know that at the time. And di -- the people working\nalready against the Vichy government and against the Germans.",
        "A: So we go back and pick up the visa -- the cards over there, on the 11\" I believe, was the same\nday or the next day -- next day, probably. And then we take a train, and go to Nende, which is in\nthe Lozere mountains. [indecipherable] my father had met a gentleman from St-Germain-de-\nCalbert. And we had to go through Nende to go there.",
        "A: So, he says, well let\u2019s go to St-Germain-de-Calbert. We took a train to Nende, and we stayed\nin the refugee camp overnight, they have them all over the place, and at five o\u2019clock in the\nmorning, we walk out of camp, and go to the mils -- to the city, and there is a German soldier\nwith fixed bayonet, standing guard in front of a hotel, where the German officers was s-staying.\nWe got scared, I mean, you know.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Is he going to ask for our papers or what, you know?",
        "A: Well, he was just watching the hotel, it was al -- his job, so we walk by, we go to the railroad\nstation, and from the railroad station we go to the Col de Jalcreste, J-a-l-c-r-e-s-t-e. Acor -- 1t was\nactually a -- a valley, like a valley.",
        "A: And there was a chauffeur, a fellow who did transportation for people, like a taxi, but actually\nis a [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right. And he takes us to St-Germain-de-Calbert. We meet the friend of my father, and he\nfinds a place for us to stay, we rent th-the place.",
        "A: Yes, they are not in [indecipherable]",
        "A: And they are just on main highway, in Nende, and [indecipherable]. And well, you know,\nnext day, gendarmes come to the door.",
        "A: Are be -- juif? Are you Jewish? Said no. He said, Catholic? Are you Catholic?

It was the 1936 laws there, misapplied. I\nmean, they -- they went on further than -- than [indecipherable] for anybody. So I didn\u2019t walk\naway --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. The papers we had, and I think I sent you copies with those cards. No, there\u2019s just a -- the\nbirthdate, birthplace, and --",

        "A: Yes. And we, you know [indecipherable] in the village. We stay -- first of all we stayed in the\nhotel, Hotel Martin, that\u2019s in Poland, because that hotel had an annex, we stayed in the annex.\nThe hotel itself was already occupied. And he was hiding, we didn't know at the time, 24 Jewish\npeople, plus about six or seven other ones who were foreigners, Armenians and other\nnationalities. They were not hiding from the Germans at the time, but were just hiding from the\nFrench [indecipherable] I guess.",
        "A: But -- so anyway, then we [indecipherable] the sequence. I -- I guess we get to meet people\nover there. There was a shoemaker who had the sewing machine -- no, no, the -- the -- we were\nlooking for food, to buy food. Well, we had some money and [indecipherable] and some\nsilverware and a -- a tablecloth. And they told me that I could probably get food on those items if\nI go to a farm on the other side of the hill, on the mountain. Chateau de Cremat, C-r-e-m-a-t. I go\nover there and the lady is very nice, and I says, \u201cI came to get some food from you. I do not have\nmuch money, but I can give you some merchandise in trade.\u201d And she said, \u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d And I\nshowed her our silverware. Yes, she\u2019s interested. I show her the tablecloth, she\u2019s interested. You\nknow, before, they were poor, the farms, had not much money to buy those things, and now they\nhave food when people need it, they can get more money, so now they have money to buy things",
        "A: -- or for trade. It was great. So I brought home some pate\u00e9 de fois gras. They had pigs, they\nslaughtered since war, a-and geese, so it was great. And my parents were really surprised that I\n[indecipherable]",

        "A: -- like th-that.",
        "A: Was the main thing, yes. But -- it certainly was.",
        "A: Yes, it was just two buildings down the road, with a different entrance and th -- and there\u2019s a\npassage under -- underneath it, to get into it like a -- a bridge.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes. They had about 20 some rooms, and the main hotel was all occupied, and so we had the\noverfill.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: In -- in -- in --",
        "A: -- in -- in the main hotel, yes. They are the ones that occupied most of the rooms\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: So we -- we met all the people, because the one that we knew had already met most of them,\nbut we never admitted who we were. It was obvious we knew each other --",
        "A: -- we knew who we were --",
        "A: -- and we had common sense not to mention anything or discuss anything. So I -- I --",

        "A: Because they ordered certain areas evacuated, no civilians could live there, too. So it was --\nbut we were quite a ways from the coast. This was our luck.",
        "A: Yes. I-I am not sure exactly when it started, but I found a job with my father to cut down\ntrees, which were used for the coal mines as support, you know, they have a --",

        "A: We were lucky, because there we got paid. On the other side he -- he just got so-some food,\nyou know.",
        "A: He got the food for the work for himself and very little to -- to take home.",
        "A: My sister went to work in a -- in the Catholic lady who had the garden. Now, this could have\nbeen a problem. What happened, she was very religious and she asked my sister for a baptism\npaper.

        "A: That was [indecipherable] likely.",

        "A: The -- my mom was home most of the time. And we used to go someplace out, my father and\nI, to harvest mushrooms after rain.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know much about the mushrooms, but we [indecipherable] people, and the tourists\ntake only one type, it\u2019s an orange type. And if you go take this only, you won\u2019t go wrong.\n[indecipherable] get poisoned. So we did that.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: I had -- I had food, you know, on the table.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: And you know what? She was terrific. She always knew we did not have enough food, she\nsays, here is little more, here, this. I said, \u201cBut it\u2019s your food, don\u2019t.\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not\nhungry.\u201d You know how mothers are. You will say no?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: We all lost weight [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: But you know, it was terrible, because we didn't want to take her food.",
        "A: We were hungry and we knew that she was hungry too, so we tried to refuse as much as\npossible.",
        "A: But she always said, no, take this one, spoonful of this one.",
        "A: No -- oh. That was ki -- we didn\u2019t know until after the war.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, [indecipherable] not, no. We knew only they were arresting them, they were putting them\nin camps, resettling them in the towns, the whatnot.",
        "A: [indecipherable] be able to do anything.",
        "A: No, nothing at all. Not even I guess in the rest of France. We were [indecipherable] we never\nheard about it.",
        "A: And the rest of France didn\u2019t hear about it, either. Because they said that we are going to\nrepay them for country -- for [indecipherable] land.",
        "A: You know, for food [indecipherable] different jobs and whatnot.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh no, right. I mean, we -- we knew we could -- we had to avoid them because of what they\ndid to -- to my uncles, they killed them, yeah. Although we did not know about the second one,\nhe -- we -- we -- he wasn\u2019t at camp when we left.",
        "A: So we didn\u2019t know about what happened to him. But there was shoemaker in town, and he\nhad the sewing machine, so it broke down, so my father offered to fix it for him. Then he said,\nyou know, I got some blankets, I would like to make some pants on it. And the guy\n[indecipherable] sew pants -- pants. And then they traded it for food for the farmer.",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t have to be fancy, it was for a farmer who was working the fields.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah, he did.",
        "A: He did. And he traded it for food. And I told you about the tobacco exchange.",
        "A: That lady was so grateful because soap was also rationed, it was hard to get.",
        "A: And now she could wash the floors and -- and all that. She was so happy.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I for -- just for her I did.",
        "A: Because you need other stuff, you need [indecipherable] you needed sodium, you needed\nsodium, potassium, all kinds of minerals, you need also an indicator of the -- if it\u2019s a si -- acidic\nor -- or [indecipherable] whatever, you know, it\u2019s -- the paper.",
        "A: I forgot what it\u2019s called now.",
        "A: Just for that one lady.",
        "A: She owned the tobacco shop.",
        "A: For food.",
        "A: Because tobacco was rationed too.",
        "A: But she somehow had connections where she had more than just rations. And she had plenty\nin reserve too, because they were all appo -- supposedly si -- report, it said the instruction on\nhand. I\u2019m sure she had enough, so had more than she needed.",
        "A: She mentioned something about I\u2019m making soap, and she [indecipherable] that was an\nexchange of tobacco.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want the police to find out either.",
        "A: The gendarmes.",
        "A: Absolutely. It saved our necks. I mean, we had food for whatever time that we had food, you\nknow.",
        "A: Very, very, very much.",
        "A: Very much. Absolutely. The rations that you get officially, were very small.",

        "A: Per person. It wasn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think it was even a half a pound. Or maybe a quarter of a\npound. It was a very little, it -- it was o -- small cubes [indecipherable]. Oil was very rare. You\nwere entitled to it but you wouldn\u2019t get it, because it was not available. Milk was only for\nchildren and babies, you know. Coffee was ersatz coffee, not very tasty.",
        "A: Re -- well, now the main thing we did especially, we went to farms and bought vegetables,\ncarrots, rutabaga.",
        "A: [indecipherable] I never see one, too soon. [indecipherable] like Jerusalem artichokes.",
        "A: But th-they call them something else over there. And it was a different sh -- shape, it was a --\nthis is -- looks almost like over here, but 1t was not the same thing. But the rutabaga -- the\nrutabaga, that was terrible.",
        "A: Yes, except those who grew their own, farmers.",
        "A: Had more.",
        "A: Those -- the trade they did with the -- the same thing, trading, you know. I had the --",

        "A: If you had more to trade with.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not those people there, no. The refugees, yes. The local people had the chicken, they had the\neggs.",
        "A: They have surely enough, they had a small garden --",
        "A: Yeah, and then next thing is -- is that you had big black market going on too. So the people\ncame from the towns, bought things at high prices, raised the prices for us too.",
        "A: And we couldn\u2019t afford it.",
        "A: Now there\u2019s one interesting thing happened, it was one of the underground movements, that\nwas later on a different group was looking for food. They went to see this farmer and he sold\nthem food at exorbitant prices. Then the commanding officer [indecipherable] took out his pistol,\nand says okay, let\u2019s have the money back. He said, we paid you, you charge exorbitant prices.\nThen he took a box of matches, stuck the match -- the money into the fire. He says, that\u2019s for\nyou, you get nothing. But you got paid, right?",
        "A: There was a lesson.",

        "A: We were in the small village of St-Germain-de-Calbert, and from time to time, for a period of\ntime they came every month, and then they stopped. The only people I remember in France that\ncould have possibly send me one is a cousin of my parents who had been in service, got married,\nand lived, I believe, in Lyon. But I was never able to identify this because the sending station\nwas different. The -- the -- the place from where they s-send the checks. And the other\n[indecipherable] was, if possible, I understood that maybe some Jewish organization may have\nbeen aware of our existence, and they did not put their name on it. I understand they had some\nresources in Switzerland, the -- I forgot what the name of the organization was -- and they could\nhave possibly done that for a period of time, but I do not know.",
        "A: No. It was welcome, because we were --",
        "A: -- exhausted [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, they picked them up -- I guess we had to pick them up at the post office --",

        "A: Speaking about post office --",
        "A: Did I tell you that they censored some letters that were sent out from St-Germain-de-Calbert?\nI found out afterwards. If those letters were sent to a German authority, or a French police\nauthority, they just tore them up.",

        "A: -- somes of -- books that I read.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Right. And this was an incident that occurred on April seventh, 1942, in the village -- or north\nof the village of san -- St-Etienne Vallee Francaise. And what happened 1s, this one\n[indecipherable] was a hard to get along fellow, apparently, who wouldn\u2019t take orders from\nnobody, and he had a car parked in the street. And some of the local people saw that there was a\nsubmachine gun on the back seat. So they told him to take it away, and he refused, just for spite.\nAnd what happened, shortly thereafter, a car with four -- I -- I was told -- Gestapo or\nWehrmacht, [indecipherable] taken by. I\u2019m not sure which it is. Anyway, they saw that\nsubmachine gun on the back seat, and wanted to find out whose it was. Then this\n[indecipherable] from the resistance came out, and with this man, and they killed three of them\non the spot. I hear from other sources they were killed two on the spot, one tried to escape, and\nwas shot under a bridge where he had hidden, and the fourth one was captured and they hanged\nhim on the gate of a chateau 1n the same division. A few days later a -- two companies of the Ost\nLeon, these are the Russians [indecipherable] the Polish troops in the German army, the legion of\nthe east, came by from Marda, and came through our village. And [indecipherable] police came\nFeldgendarmie, with big metal [indecipherable]. And they knocked on the door at about one, two\no\u2019clock in the morning with the rifle butts. I opened up the door and they come in, and the\nleaders says terrorishn. Are there any terrorists here? My father says, \u201cIl n\u2019ya pas terrorists.\u201d\nThen they say, raffen. We understand every single word they\u2019re saying because they\u2019re speaking\nGerman and we understand it. My father ignores it, \u201cQu\u2019est ce que c\u2019est raffen?\u201d So the guy does\nthis with his rifle. My father says, \u201cNo, Il na pas.\u201d Then they searched the house. On top of\nclosets, all the doors, the kitchen, every room. And there\u2019s a big overseas trunk in one of the\nrooms, bedroom. They open it up -- one of the -- one of the guys open up. They went different\ndirections, every one had a different assignment. He opens it up, and there\u2019s a drawer of like,\nshirts, under which we had our talleissim and Tefillin. Luckily for us, he never lifted that tray.\nHad he lifted it, we would have been dead. So he says, \u201cNicht viel.\u201d Not much. He closes the\ncover and goes on looking for more weapons or other things, 1-in the whole house. Another one\nof them --",
        "A: [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t lift it up.",
        "A: Maybe he was tired already from, you know --",
        "A: -- because they had probably a long day [indecipherable] those -- reason, because they had to\ntravel quite a bit --",
        "A: -- to come to the house, too.",
        "A: So this very strange, I mean, it saved our lives.",
        "A: And a-another one had came into the kitchen, and the radio was there on the table, so he says,\n\u201cRadio?\u201d I says, \u201cCe marche pas.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work. Well, he doesn\u2019t listen, he turns it on. Maybe\nhe didn\u2019t understand French anyway. So he turns it on and there\u2019s a crackling noise because it\nwasn\u2019t functioning. He shuts 1t down. Then he sees two dictionaries on the table, one French-\nGerman, and one French-English. So he points to the English one, he says, \u201cThis good, das\nyeah.\u201d So I nod my head. He walks away. Meantime I have a dog barking in the backyard, and I\nhad to quiet him down because he was waking up the neighborhood, too. Then --",
        "A: What\u2019s that?",
        "A: Yeah, a small one.",
        "A: Yeah, uh-huh. That dog was important because he helped us bring a lady from Martin a few\nmiles away, she was expecting. And we had to take her to the house to bring her to -- to the\nProtestant minister who took care of her to go to the hospital, a Jewish woman.",
        "A: When the dogs came -- when we pass in the night [indecipherable] there, dogs are barking all\nover the place, and he never answered back, as if he knew, you know. Otherwise he would have\ngive us -- gived us away.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t recall the exact time, but he was with us for 0-over a year or so.",
        "A: Oh yes. Now, the other German checked under the stairway, and there was a spot there where\nthey stored normally vegetables, you know, potatoes or whatnot. And he looks in there with his\nflashlight, doesn\u2019t see anything. Behind a sheerai -- a wax cloth, we had hidden our false identity\n-- ar -- our true identity cards. And he does not see nothing, it matches the color of the rest of the\n[indecipherable] and he walks out. So two chance --",
        "A: Oh yes. And then they walk out, we were very calm, and then we collapse. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh God, yes. That was hel -- horrible. We were very close to getting killed there. Turned out\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Probably not, but they would bring us to the Gestapo.",
        "A: The same thing.",
        "A: Because they would have probably tortured you to try to find out what else you know, who\nelse you know, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well, what happened is, in the building there was a workshop with a dirt floor. And I had\nburied those papers in there months before. But we were on the side of a hill, and when it rained,\nthe water accumulated, the sand was washed out, and the papers were shown.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I took them from there and hid them.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall for sure, but we had not much of a choice [indecipherable] you know. But we\nhad tried to escape from there, the back wall had the stones -- a stone wall actually, with spaces\nin between, and we tried to put in cap -- a couple hooks so we could walk out there. Luckily we\ndidn\u2019t try, because there were soldiers out there, too. And if we had, we\u2019d be dead.",
        "A: Nobody talked very much.",
        "A: The less we knew, the better off we were.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, my brother almost got shot. You know, the Germans were taking people\nfrom a certain age [indecipherable] 20 - 21 and 22 for forced labor to Germany.",
        "A: And it -- you have young people came up from the vi -- cities to hide up there. I found out\nafter my brother was killed in combat that there was a group of the resistance that was lying in\nambush for him one time, they wanted to kill him. Why? He came to work from the one farm\nwhere he worked, and they thought that the only reason he was in the open and not being\nbothered by the police or so is because he must have been collaborating with the Germans. But\nthe reason was that we were passing for Alsatians, and there was an agreement between France\nand -- and als -- and the Germans, Alsatians who were -- some of them were Ger-Germans, some\nof them were French, should not be forced to work f -- in Germany. So this one guy from 0 --\nwell, this is [indecipherable] later on told me that we stopped them from killing your brother.",
        "A: Well, the resistance rep -- s-single people that were hiding in different places, farms\n[indecipherable], after awhile they got organized, and then they got uniforms. They broke into a\nuniform factory in Saint Jean Lugar, with the complicity of the owner. He says they broke in and\nthey took so many uniforms. Once they got a uniform, they figure it\u2019s about time we should join\nthem guys, too. This is not -- think of us as a -- a -- either against them, or not going to do\nanything for -- for France. So --",
        "A: How did I know the resistance?",
        "A: Because they stayed in a building just south of the village, maybe a few hundred feet south\nfrom there, which was supposed to be a camp for Chantiers de jeunesse. This was Marshall\nPittens idea of taking young people and organizing them for future Frenchmen, you know, o-of --\nof his kibo and thing. [indecipherable] too. So we said that -- and they came up and they had\nroadblocks on the main highway, so we decided let\u2019s -- let\u2019s join them.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes, yes.",
        "A: No, well they -- they found out, because as soon as we applied there, the guys -- we were g --\non guard duty, y-you know, so many hours of the day --",
        "A: -- hours of the night. And then we got uniforms too, like they were wearing.",
        "A: It\u2019s a khaki unif -- jacket and --",
        "A: -- brown pants, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, they were very happy.",
        "A: Because of just -- they -- who, my parents, or -- or --",
        "A: Oh, my parents. They had the doubts about that.",
        "A: But you know, we had made a decision. We could not be in [indecipherable] and people not\nknowing if they are on one side or the other side, and that could have been very costly for us\nsometimes.",
        "A: Well, the people in the village treat us like somebody apart to some extent, you know --",

        "A: Yes, exactly.",
        "A: There was one villager there who had the son in the French milice, which was the most cruel\nterrorists of the French government that took the resistance people and killed them and tortured\nthem and do everything to them. And the neighbors warned by an anonymous letter, hand carried\nto them at night -- not to them, to the house, that they better shape up and get their son out of the\narea. So you know, we do take [indecipherable] the situation, too. It -- not knowing who we\nwere, what we were doing, did not help in that case.",
        "A: Well, some of these were actually local inhabitants.",
        "A: Some were from the other cities.",

        "A: -- they did not know, but they were not out to do something unfortunate that could not be\ncorrected. So, I mean when we said we -- okay, we\u2019d like to join you and help you, stay on duty,\nand guard duty, whatnot, they [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: That\u2019s just -- that -- no, that\u2019s the whole point. Because we were not Jewish officially to them,\nthen who are we? We are Alsatians. What are you doing in the mountains? How come you don\u2019t\n[indecipherable] as us, you know?",
        "A: There was a lot of questions that could be asked.",

        "A: No, because we had no weapons at that time.",

        "A: -- and his assistant.",
        "A: The knew about it. They just complained about it, but the only problem was that the weapons\nwere of all types, ammunition was all mixture. It was difficult to have the right ammunition for\nthe right rifle.",
        "A: And if you had wrong bullet, you jammed the rifle.",
        "A: And it\u2019s useless.",
        "A: Yes, we -- we managed to free up the jammed rifles, too, but this was dangerous too because\nit can explode in your --",
        "A: I had been at the College Bartholdi in Colmar --",
        "A: And on Thursdays we had training for [indecipherable] preparation. We didn\u2019t do very much\nthere, but we learned how to shoot a rifle.",
        "A: The first time I shot rifle, they told me, this is the target there --",
        "A: -- and they said aim in such and such a way, just below, and I did. And there was a guy next\nto me who hated me, I don\u2019t know for what reason. He says, \u201cHa, ha, ha, you couldn\u2019t touch the\nside of a barn.\u201d And the inspect -- the instructor says, \u201cWait a second.\u201d He goes over. \u201cHe hit\nright in the center.\u201d And was he embarrassed.",
        "A: That was an accident, I mean, I may not have hit the center again, but that time I did.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, exactly, because it gave me a chance to use them to fight back. Not necessarily to attack\nthem, because we were outnumbered, but at least to defend ourselves.",
        "A: And that was very important for us.",
        "A: About end of July, he was parachuted as a part of a Jedburgh team. That\u2019s J-e-d-b-u-r-g-h.",
        "A: It\u2019s a -- Jedburgh is a name of a castle out in Scotland. And they were trained over there in\ngroups of three, usually in the [indecipherable] an officer or non-com, who spoke the language of\nthe country in which they were parachuted into, because it landed in Belgium, Holland, France,\nYugoslavia, different places, so they had to have somebody who spoke the local language. And\nthe third one was a radio operator. And the -- the point was for them, first of all, to recognize --\nto reconnoiter, to find out where the German troops were, their strength, what were good\nobjectives to destroy in case of an invasion to block roads and whatnot. We were started on the\nuse of a plastic explosives, which was a new thing at the time. We were trained in using gammon\nhand grenades, there was a special type of hand grenades that they brought to us. That\u2019s just\ntraining, we did not get any of the weapons right away, though, because it --",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: Not right away.",
        "A: There was just the training. And th-then the Jedburgh team drove around to get acquainted\nwith the various maquis, where they were located, to look for positions, what was important to\ndestroy to prevent Germans from il -- attacking, or reinforcing troops.",
        "A: And then, after that they had time in August, to train us. So Bank came back and trained us in\nthe use of the plastic explosives and they gave us rifles, German, Italian and Russian rifles. Why\nthese rifles? Those are the ones that -- the Italian rifles were captured in Africa, North Africa, in\nLibya, I believe. The German rifles were captured over there too, possibly or in Italy, and the\nRussian rifles were captured in Russia. Since the Germans used -- and other Russian troops, and\nthe German army, I guess they were forced into the service. They had Ru-Russian drivers there,\ntoo. So the problem was that the ammunition was all different in each of the rifles.",
        "A: Yeah. You could not use one with -- in the other rifles, and that was a big problem. The\nreason for giving us those weapons too, was the fact that in case of bad weather, they cannot\nparachute or re-supply us, so they have to have a source of constant re-supply, and the best thing\n[indecipherable] to the Germans and take their weapons --",
        "A: -- and ammunition.",
        "A: The weapons were -- some were parachuted in, the heavy weapons like the French, the heavy\nmachine guns --",
        "A: The Hotchkiss machines gu -- machine guns. Some American Browning machine guns, and\nbasically the -- the heavy stuff was parachuted in there, yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. Well, he parachuted before the equipment, way before.",
        "A: Well, there were many of those teams parachuted in all over France, and even in Germany.",
        "A: So it was just a matter of seeing -- they were prepared for the landing in North Africa.",
        "A: This happened in August. The landing happened on August 16\", if I remember correctly, in\n1940 -- si -- \u00b044. So, he had to be in place to find out how the Germans were reacting to the\nlanding, if they were sending troops from different areas, and [indecipherable], especially they\nhad two SS Panzer divisions, plank regiments in the area. One was the ninth German Panzer\ndivision, the other one was the 11\u201c Hohenstauffen Panzer division. And they wanted to make\nsure that they cannot attack the allied -- allied troops landing in southern France.",
        "A: So we should be able to block them.",
        "A: Block them how? Mainly by putting [indecipherable] down and blowing them up. See, it\nwould not block the Germans, but it would slow them down. They have to remove the trees and\nwhatnot.",

        "A: Yes [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, no, no, no. He -- when he parachuted --",
        "A: -- in August, on the 16\" he came down. A few days later he trained us, and we went into c-\ncombat on the 21\".",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Yes, yes, 1-in June.",
        "A: Yes, but because we were hidden also, this is all part of the resistance.",
        "A: Those who were hiding were actually being organized because people in town send them to\nthe mountains to hide in farms and [indecipherable]",
        "A: But that was in preparation of regrouping them and arming them afterwards.",
        "A: So the resistance was actually considered in the [indecipherable] region [indecipherable] as\nthe fifth of -- I guess in the fifth of May, 1943.",
        "A: Right, the fer --",
        "A: Yes, and yi -- I -- it was never to exceed a certain number of people at any spot.",
        "A: You -- the maximum they want us to be is maybe 30 at one place, in one location. If you had\ntoo many people in one area, then the Germans would become interested.",
        "A: And they would try to have big forces surrounding you.",
        "A: We were in the -- our group, 20. The first was retrained by bake -- by Banker -- Bank,\nColonel Bank.",
        "A: And we were then as-assigned a hundred more from a different company that -- from those\nwho were [indecipherable] were joining us, and they never received the tr-training from him,\nthey were thrown in the battle without training, with us. So we were the ones who attacked first,\nand [indecipherable] to pull back with, and be there to get [indecipherable] for the whole\nregiment.",
        "A: I mean for the whole company. And then we divide ourselves to be mixed with the other ones,\nSO We were supporting them and showing them, you know, not to run, a-a-and -- and they had\nconfidence just because we had the training [indecipherable] that way. And we are not as a single\nunit then together, we were divided in combat. We mixed together.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: That\u2019s all. That\u2019s all.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Our very first in August, we were in battle. That\u2019s when I led the one group there.",
        "A: Yes, okay. About 16\" or 17\" of August, oh I -- I [indecipherable] there, we went down from\nthe mountains towards Ales, the city of Al\u00e9s. We stopped at a place called genearagues, g-e-n-e-\na-r-a-g-u-e-s, and we\u2019re in the best position to report any activities, Germans and so forth. And\nthis was the Saturday, on Sunday morning the people from th -- from Al\u00e9s came by, they want to\ngo swimming in the river not too far from there, and they see we are resistance in uniform, and\nsay, you know, a group 1s coming in behind us, and those people -- there 1s one young lady, she\u2019s\n17 years old, her boyfriend is a militia, a traitor that is -- was working for [indecipherable], and\nthose are the people that killed the si -- the resistance people. So I am on guard duty there, and I\nstop her, ask for her name [indecipherable] and I arrest her right away, and I turned her over to\nthe gendarmes. They were in Al\u00e9s [indecipherable] too. They [indecipherable] her -- then\nquestioned her, and then they searched her, and she has a pistol.",
        "A: Yeah, and it was in her chest.",
        "A: Mm-hm, a small pistol in her bra. And they kept her overnight because we did not want to\nhave reports back that the resistance over here. They release her the next day. Her boyfriend was\ncaptured by a Communist group two -- three days later. He admitted that he belonged to the\nmilitia and he was being paid 3000 francs a month, but he claimed to have resigned two, three\nmonths ago. And I had to report this to my captain in my report, and I understand that they killed\nhim, but I have no proof of that. I was told that they shot him.",
        "A: A-Anyway, then they had -- on the 21\", we were told that the civilians -- civilian population\nin Al\u00e9s had risen up against the Germans, and the Germans had killed eight or nine of them in\nthe city streets. Well, they send us [indecipherable] to -- to reinforce. We were about 30 in that\nposition. So now we [indecipherable] our groups. We were going up tr -- on a truck first, on th --\none machine gun, and we were at Al\u00e9s, the Germans had left, because I guess they may have\nreceived orders to retreat and combine with some other units. So my captain -- my lieutenant --\nthere was a -- there was a re -- assigned different positions to some of the guys. And me he puts\non a pors -- on a [indecipherable] road, he says, report to me if there\u2019s anything abnormal\nhappening over here, and he goes into reconnaissance. Well, I didn\u2019t know where the\n[indecipherable]. Anyway --",
        "A: No, no cell phones. So civilians come back. The French flag 1s all over the city. And they said\nyou -- the Germans are coming back there, and the [indecipherable] Al\u00e9s about 10 kilometers sou\n-- south of Al\u00e9s. I said, oh my God, with the French flag all over the place. We can\u2019t inform\neverybody at one time to remove them all at once. We are not strong enough to have a street\nfight with them, with the Germans that are come in. What\u2019s the alternative? So we decided we\nhave to attack them. And I made the decision, there was nobody in charge, and I so -- took the\nguys, and because I just took that action, they did not question it, and they base -- my fa --\nfather\u2019s trait.",
        "A: 19, yes, in \u201840 --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, mm-hm. So then I take th --",
        "A: Combat.",
        "A: Combat.",
        "A: There were 10 guys over there, and I had to take them with me. They did not question. And\nthen five civilians come over too, to say they want to go with me. I says fine. We had stationed --\nwe had been stationed 1n a school that the Germans had abandoned, but they had left a whole\nbunch of hand grenades and other equipment there. So I gave the five civilians a hand grenade\neach, a potato masher, it\u2019s called. And I took my men in the car -- no, in the truck. There were\nsome Communists that decided to join us too. I said, okay, come along. So they pile in too, we\ngo to [indecipherable] Ales, to find that on the [indecipherable] there, the one, the pyramid, did\nyou ever hear it?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see a pyramid on the -- on your pictures today.",
        "A: No, no, I mean, I didn\u2019t see it today, you have -- you don\u2019t have it with you?",
        "A: Oh, I [indecipherable] make sure, okay. Anyway, this is where they have the machine gun\nthat was nine by two, the Communists, that their leader had left to go on a reconnaissance. So I\nasked them, what are you -- and he said, oh, our leader 1s coming back soon. Fine. So I divide\nmy men in three groups. I took four or five men with me, and the civilians, the five. I sent five\nthe other way, and the other ones remained with the Communists with the machine gun there.\nThe Germans were having lunch, they got lunch break, in a farm just south of the village. We\ncame out from two sides. And we didn\u2019t know how many there were. We were told by civilians\nthat seen them before there were about 150 in the trucks, 20 trucks lined up.",
        "A: They were lined up -- there was a farm and the access road through the main highway. The\nother side of the farm was land, so they couldn\u2019t even go through there, and I came from that\nside. So [indecipherable] somebody fires at the Germans, and they are aware that something is\ngoing on here, and then the one -- one of my civilians to whom I had given a pistol, had three b-\nbullets in the pistol, he aims at a German, closes his eyes and fires. I said, my God, you didn\u2019t do\nany -- y-y-you think you\u2019re going to aim at anybody that way? I was furious because he give our\nposition away too soon.",
        "A: So the Germans were alert now that there are new -- two groups at least, around here. So they\ndecided they were forced to go south anyway, so they pulled out. As they were on the highway, I\nhave come around and I counted trucks, that\u2019s how I knew -- I -- I wouldn\u2019t say 20, 1t may be 19\nplus one or minus one. It was about that number. So they go on and we shoot into the trucks.\nWhether we hit anybody or not we didn\u2019t know, because they had the covers o-on the trucks\nthere. But they go on fine. Then, a short while later -- by the way, the ci -- the Communists were\nin ci -- in -- in civilian clothes, so they could disappear in case things got too hot, so the Germans\nwouldn\u2019t know them from civilians. The problem was though, if the Germans couldn\u2019t tell who\nshot at them, they would take civilian hostages no matter where, and kill them, innocent people.\nAnyway, it was [indecipherable] truck came back [indecipherable]. We -- the two groups had\njoined them over here that point. And the truck stops with the white flag, and the -- one of my\nmen gets up and the -- the Germans shoot him in the leg. Th-The -- the time [indecipherable]\ntiming is [indecipherable]. And we were in the vineyards, it was about that high. We could not\nraise our heads because we\u2019d be dead. So I decide to crawl in the -- in the vines between the\nvineyard, and go to a farm, which is on the -- one of the pictures I show you. And I go behind,\nthey have a stairway going up into the attic. I go up there, the door is locked, I take my rifle and\ntry to shoot the door and lock off. The farmer runs up from nowheres, he says, \u201cAttendez, j\u2019ai la\ncle.\u201d Wait, I have the key. I says, fine, open up. And I told him to -- I order him, I didn\u2019t ask him\n-- ask him, I told him, remove one tile edge end of the roof so I can see the road, and use the\nopening for shooting at the Germans.",
        "A: So I\u2019m through to the openings that were [indecipherable] the Germans and my -- one guy\nhad been wounded already.",
        "A: And the three maga -- the three Communists are still walking towards the west lake, and I had\nto stop shooting because of the bunch of th -- they were in the -- 1n the way.",
        "A: Could have killed them.",
        "A: So I go back down and we are taking my buddy, put in a -- well, we -- a ligature, we took a\nbelt and tied that on. He -- he had been hit in the femoral artery, he was bleeding very badly. Wi",
        "A: I-I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Absolutely. So one of the guys says -- had his -- taken his belt off and did that, but we had not\neven a Band-Aid, no bandages whatsoever. So then the four of us, we picked up a ladder from\nthe farmer, it was laid on, and we took my buddy on it, and we had to carry him very low\nbecause the vineyard\u2019s very low to start with, and we could not afford to raise any dust by\ndragging him on the soil.",
        "A: So that was a -- some mess there. Anyway, we got him to the village again. Meantime Bank\nhad been alerted, and he was there with the Commandant -- well, th-the leader of the whole\ndistrict. And so I -- I made my report of everything was -- was happening, and the meantime I\nfind out that the Germans has gone back, they fled.",
        "A: Oh they were -- they were taking prisoners.",
        "A: The Germans took them with them. We found them later on tied to trees with the eyes\npunched out and the ears cut off. They didn\u2019t die. Didn\u2019t kill them.",
        "A: They just let them suffer, and they died anyway, yes.",
        "A: Well, [indecipherable] says, anybody who is stupid enough to do what you did should be an\nofficer. So he promoted me and gave me a Croix de Guerre Silver Star.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know why, I felt that I was responsible for the -- for my guys.",
        "A: So [had enough strength there to see to it --",
        "A: -- that we --",
        "A: Yes, he was in -- on one group there, yes. The -- the group that was on the other side.",
        "A: He was with --",
        "A: You know you -- there\u2019s a French saying, \u201cLa valeur n\u2019attends pas les nombres des ann\u00e9es.\u201d\nValor does not wait for the number of years.",
        "A: So you can be young and done --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, the na -- the next day, we were -- the s -- forgot the name -- the monter des silhols, s-1-l-\nh-o-l-s, la monter is m-o-n-t-e-r, des, d-e-s, silhols, that\u2019s a rise in the road. And we -- I should\nsay, what happened that night, I was put on duty over there, we had moved position, we had\nwalked a few kilometers, one after the o -- behind each other, to get new position, and then I was\nmid -- charged in middle of the night, on guard duty. At about six o\u2019clock in the morning, my\ncaptain comes along -- not so higher -- n-nothing than the captain. And he says I will have an\narms inspection. Okay. All of a sudden I realized that my bolt had been removed from my rifle.\nHe had been there during the night and saw me asleep and then he\u2019d removed it. He says, if it\nhappens again, anybody who 1s falling asleep on guard duty is going to be shot. I got the\nmessage. So anyway, in the afternoon, I -- he gives me permission to go to Al\u00e9s, which is a few\nkilometers down, for the afternoon. I went to a friend of -- one of the maquisards, who lend me\nhis bicycle, from his father. So I go to Al\u00e9s, and guess what, they tell me the Germans are\nfighting over there in the [indecipherable]. So I go back on the bicycle, I had only 100 in my\n[indecipherable] there and what happened, the tru -- German truck had a trailer with gasoline\nbehind it. It came from the airport of Nimes. And there were about 13 Germans in the truck, in\nthe trailer, and -- 1t was a truck, this was a big truck. Three in the front, one on the side with this\nmachine gun, and the rest was inside the truck. So they hit the -- our machine gunner who was on\nduty at the [indecipherable] over there, and he hit the German who was on the side of the car,\nand hit him right in the chest, and he was badly hit there. And then he killed the three in the front\nseat. And by that time I had arrived. They had some that jumped off the truck, Germans, some\nhad escaped. And some were afraid because they did not know which way to move. So then I\nlooked, and there was a [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a ditch --",
        "A: -- and there was a pistol in there. I grabbed the pistol, it\u2019s a German pistol, I put my rifle on\nmy shoulder. And then I go on the side of the truck, and all of a sudden two Germans jump out.\nAnd I was right behind them, so I said, [speaks German here]. Hands up. They do that\nimmediately, and I [indecipherable] and I bring back to rest of the group. This was so stupid on\nma -- on my part, you have no idea. I did not realize that there was no charger in the pa -- gun,\nthat the gun was empty, and this pistol has a small lever that goes up if there is a bullet in the to -\n- in -- in the chamber, and the lever goes up and -- and the German says geladen, loaded. And it\nwas down. So if the Germans had faced me, I would have been dead. They would have realized\nthere was no bullet there.",
        "A: And I would have been gone. You know, how -- how often can you be lucky?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know about it, I found out afterwards that --",
        "A: -- yeah, I found out the thing was empty. I didn\u2019t know about the lever.",
        "A: The lever.",
        "A: I know, I -- I -- I was -- they turned sideways, and then I told them to line up, and let them\ntalk to each other for awhile to see if they were communicating anything that was important,\nbecause I wanted to find out how many had escaped. So this point then told them\n[indecipherable] you know? They realize I spoke German also, and they -- they stopped talking.\nThen we took them in to a -- no, there was one more guy that had escaped and was captured, and\nth -- they had dropped the machine -- the guy that was on the side of that, you know, truck had a\nmachine gun, but somehow or other that pulled off the -- what they were -- the mechanism 1s to\nfire. So my captain told me, ask him where the piece 1s, and tell that you\u2019re going to kill him if\nhe doesn\u2019t tell you, or how it functions, so forth. So I told him in German, and I tried to be a\nserious as possible and hey, you know, threatening. And he says, I\u2019m sorry, I -- I was a fireman\nat the base in ni -- Nimes, I was not in the infantry. [indecipherable] know that\u2019s a lie, because\neverybody gets trained for weapons. But anyway, we couldn\u2019t find the -- the missing piece, and\nthen we took him to Al\u00e9s with the truck that was damaged, the se -- the windshield was shot out.\nWe took the wounded German with us, we brought them to lyc\u00e9e, a school in Ales that served a -\n- as a hospital, and I think he couldn\u2019t make it though, because he had been really badly shot\nright in the chest.",
        "A: And the German prisoner, I took him then to the city hall, where they had an officer that was\ninterrogating prisoners. So we passed a truck that had been brought there already, and he asked\nme to go to find his -- I don\u2019t recall that there -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a gamere, it\u2019s where you eat, you\nknow, it\u2019s like a metal dish or some [indecipherable] that you can fold, and so -- and said what 1s\nthat, because that were --",
        "A: -- mess kit, yeah.",
        "A: And then that word I didn\u2019t understand, it was a -- I\u2019m not [indecipherable] and then he\nexplained that to me, and I -- and I said, okay. Look, Ill let you go up in the truck and find it, but\nI\u2019m going to shoot you if you have anything else. And he went up -- up -- klamotte, that was the\nname, k-l-a-m-o-t-t-e, klamotte. I had to translate -- I have to spell German, too.",
        "A: Anyway, he come back out and I turn him in to the -- interrogating officer, which was a G2\nmit -- milit -- military intelligence, and they took over from there. They put all the prisoners in a\n-- in jail, actually, cause they had no other place for them, except in the jail.",
        "A: So that was then th -- oh no, before that, we knew some had escaped in the -- in the fields, so I\ntook him along and some of my guys and the friends there came along. We went to a farm, and\nthe farmer offered us anisette. It\u2019s a French drink, it\u2019s a very strong, good thing, and I feel sorry\nfor the guy. Are you thirsty? Is he thirsty? Yeah. So I says, okay, give him bottle.\n[indecipherable] anisette. He was so happy, he was -- it was August, it was very hot, too. And I\ntook him to town.",
        "A: Yes. There was one more incident in between --",
        "A: -- but I was not involved that one because I was not selected to that team. But that was a\nparty, a very small thing, there was no -- nobody killed. [indecipherable] like that. Germans\n[indecipherable] escaped then.",
        "A: And on the 27\" of August, early in the morning, it\u2019s a Sunday, our captain gives the order to\ntake his troops to a certain crossroad to prevent the Germans from coming back towards Ales.\nAnd he\u2019s told it\u2019s a very strong column. Civilians had been informed by a German medic who\nhad been well [indecipherable] by them [indecipherable] that they should get away from their\nhomes because a big column come by and they are fierce guys, they are Russians -- they were\nTatars, Mongols, about 2000 of them, Russians, and a thousand Germans or so. So somehow she\ngot the message through to the resistance that we should be careful, the troop will be coming by.\nSo my captain was ordered to intercept them. We got there, it\u2019s too bad -- I had the pistol, the --\nthe mats we were in, the hills. And he located us on a certain perim-perimeter. There were three\nhills there, and then the horde was going right between them.",
        "A: So he was a good tactician. He was a captain in the artillery, in reserve, and he found us\nexcellent positions there. There were two machine guns that were in a rocky area, and they had\nthe -- a domineery -- domineering positions and we -- our group, the commander, the 20, were\nset up at front, right as the road turns and the Germans came from that direction. So we were\nhard in position, it was hot as can be. And thirsty, you know, nothing to drink. Anyway, we hear\nhorses galloping around there, and then we see motorcycles coming, and there\u2019s a patrol,\nGerman, reconnoitering the area. And one fellow on the machine gun fired too soon. The\nGermans were not supposed to be attacked until they were in certain position where we had a -- a\nlarger group under fire. And I guess he may have t -- hit some motorcyclists there, and then the\nGermans spread all over the place. We fought them for about seven hours. It was terrible. I\nmean, we were in good positions, we were on the hills, they were in the plain, and --",
        "A: -- my [indecipherable] wounded -- I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: I see, okay.",
        "A: No problem.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: No, no, no, no, it\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, they couldn\u2019t advance, actually. [indecipherable]",
        "A: But then they came around on the right flank, they went around the hill, and we found out\nabout that, so we -- the [indecipherable] and we -- a machine gun that was moved over to stop\nthem, too. We found out certain things afterwards. For instance the commander asked -- he was a\nmajor, asked civilians if the resistance had been in the village. And he says, yes, they came by\nfor some water, but we didn\u2019t know who they are, we did not cooperate with them.",
        "A: That\u2019s fine. And then he asked how many were they. So this young kid apparently told them,\noh, probably a th -- a thousand or so, exaggerating. But the major laughed and told him yeah,\nprobably a hundred, 200, which is actually quite -- we were 120 [indecipherable]. Anyway, they\ntook a hostage in the village, a poor guy that had come back from work and had gone to see his\nparents. And they thought he was a terrorist also, and they tied him up, I fo -- found out later on,\non the back of a horse drawn carriage, and dragged him to his death. He was dead. There was\none captain that was apparently a -- a -- a [indecipherable] one, and he\u2019s the one that got all of\nthis. There was one lieutenant apparently, in the German outfit that when they tried to shoot\nsome -- one of the civilians that were there, called Commandant, Commandant. Our\nCommandant was over there, he asked what was going on, so he said, don\u2019t shoot the civilians.\nSo you know, this is -- we found out afterwards. Anyway, we had to have more help. So our\ncaptain sent a motorcycle -- m-motorcycle -- motorcyclist to the headquarter of Bank and said\nwe need some support. And Bank immediately called up by radio -- there was a carrier -- aircraft\ncarrier in the Mediterranean, and he asked for a-assistance. And they said they will send two\nplanes. And th-the message came back to us, they will be there in half an hour, and it took about\nan hour, but anyway the two planes came in, machine gunned the Germans. They came in very\nlow, just [indecipherable] circled, and they machine-gunned them. And that slowed the Germans\ndown, and we had time to pull back, because we had to -- we could not hold the positions any\nmore. At that time the Germans -- when the planes left -- we were stupid, too. When the planes\nwere over, we got very excited and we took out hankies and we waved at them, you know? That\nwas a bad move because Germans saw where we were, our positions. As soon as the planes left\nwe got hit by artillery you wouldn\u2019t believe. I mean, 1t came down raining like anything. And\napparently my brother was killed there, but I did not know that at the time. The captain ordered\nus to pull back, and on the way down the lieutenant said, \u201cFred, we need you down by the car.\u201d\nThere -- there was a -- a [indecipherable] parked [indecipherable] and when we got on there he\nsays, \u201cMax is dead.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat? What happened?\u201d We -- we were close by, but there was a\nhill and he was on one side, at a [indecipherable], and I didn\u2019t see it. The bi -- shells -- the shells\nwere falling all over the place. And he says yes -- and he say -- and I -- when I moved to go\nback, he -- he -- he stopped me. And he put me in the car and drove me home -- to the next\nvillage. Next morning we go back, there was one of our men had been left behind. He apparently\ncould not follow us, and he had 29 Russian prisoners with him. And how do you do that? He\nsays, well, I saw them over there, and they were trying to hide, and there I was, so I point to them\n[indecipherable] and they surrendered. So we got close to them -- because they wanted to\nsurrender, they didn\u2019t want to fight with the Germans any more. So when we got close, then\nlined up and my lieutenant -- there\u2019s a difference between lieutenant and the captain, they always\ninterchange you know, whoever was in charge at the time. So my lieutenant tries to speak to\nthem, he doesn\u2019t speak Russian, and I don\u2019t speak Russian either. And then this Russian soldier\ngoes, heil Hitler. And I take my rifle [indecipherable] and kill him. So my lieutenant puts my\nrifle down, and the Russian\u2019s leader tells him, no, this is -- salute this way, not this way. He was\nlucky, he nearly got killed over there. But I understand, I mean, he did not know, you know,\nthere was -- there were -- leaders, many of them didn\u2019t know what the heil Hitler meant to a -- to\nthe French. And then we went -- during the night, more had surrendered, and we had captured a\ntotal of about 300 [indecipherable] citation from the German, 300 prisoners. And some\nsurrendered in the morning, some had gone to the next village and surrendered over there. So we\ncaptured all of them. Couldn\u2019t believe it. N-Not many Germans, all Russians, yeah.",
        "A: They were -- no. They were pretty fanatics. They wouldn't surrender, those guys.",
        "A: Yes. So the same afternoon, they brought -- put him on a truck and they told me to go on, and\nthey had an honor guard in the truck, too. Went back up to the village, in Saint -- St-Etienne\nvalais Francaise, which is the city before St-Germain-de-Calbert, they had already no-notified\nthe people that we are coming. The honor guard were there. [indecipherable]. Then I got home\nand my father co-comes down the street there. He said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s my son, shot.\u201d We brang him\nin, my mom and my sister are there. It was terrible.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: No, because the -- they had oper -- the news -- they fied -- the telephone operator at the post\noffice.",
        "A: And they had notified my parents we were coming in. Then we s-stayed at the house the o-\novernight, and then the lady whose son had passed away the week before said that we should\nbury him next to her son. And they put him in a double coffin, because we told them that we are\ngoing to move him from there. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes. And then the eulogy from the pastor -- the protestant minister [indecipherable]\ntranslation?",
        "A: Yes. There\u2019s about 800 people showing up his funeral.",
        "A: Almost the whole village. And o-other villages, too, you know. Well, after that I stayed a few\ndays in the village, then I was sent back to my unit, and at -- was transferred to -- my parents\nwent back to Montpellier, because this was all free at that point.",
        "A: Yes. Y --",
        "A: Yes. You know, Bank -- not Bank, the Polish captain that had the Polish troops there?",
        "A: Well, he was part of the liberators from Montpellier. So things had settled down. The same\nthing is with the resistance. They had organized, but they were not in office yet, but they have\npre -- they had made preparations to take over as soon as possible. So it didn\u2019t take much time to\nget in -- take over the -- the officer there.",
        "A: [had to go back, yes.",
        "A: I wanted to go back.",
        "A: I want the Germans.",
        "A: My parents did not object to me going back.",
        "A: They did not object.",
        "A: They knew why I wanted to go back.",
        "A: If they were they wouldn\u2019t let me know.",
        "A: And maybe they were also more or less -- they saw down that they had the anxiety, you\nknow, they will not see things. Then, I went back to -- with the major, to whom I wrote about --\nthe lieutenant had lied, you know, about my combat. And he took me back to our unit. And then\nlater on I was -- my parents were in Montpellier, I was transferred there, and I was transferred to\nthe headquarter of the division as the interpreter for de Chambrun, who [indecipherable] and they\ngave me my rank, and my -- my rank at that time [indecipherable] it was on the 14\" of July. And\nthen I was in G2, Deuxi\u00e9me Bureau.",
        "A: Well, the Germans [indecipherable] by that time, there was nothing to --",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Then they took the other guys that were in my outfit and they put them in\nthe regular army, those who volunteered.",
        "A: And then they got the French uniforms on the [indecipherable] so the one will have all\n[indecipherable] on --",
        "A: -- as well as afterwards. They were organized at the 81*' regiment. It was [indecipherable].\nThere is a rule in the French army, if you are sole surviving son, you don\u2019t go back in combat,\nyou know.",
        "A: Because they want the family tree to continue. As long as you are in combat, and one has\nbeen killed in combat --",
        "A: -- then the other one doesn\u2019t go back in.",
        "A: But that was not reason there yet.",
        "A: They trust me.",
        "A: G2.",
        "A: And the first thing that happens, they had me first day, German manuals.",
        "A: Yes, they had the weapon man -- manuals about the certain glass jars [indecipherable] it was,\nthere was a manual with it, I found out that these were firebombs. You break them and\neverything, it goes up in fire, you know. And machine guns were different [indecipherable |\nbecame busy and then later on my -- the Commandant de Chambrun, was replaced because he\nwasn\u2019t wer -- found to be untrustworthy because I think somehow or other he had the affiliation\nwith the Communists. And that goes way back, and he was [indecipherable] let him completely\nfrom the res -- from the army. In comes General -- Colonel Zeller, at the time, and he puts\ntogether all the officers of his headquarter, shakes their hands, looks at me. And next thing I\nknow, he gives me first rate, a -- a book in German. He spoke German perfectly, but he did not\nwant to let on. And what does he give me? A book on a house of ill repute that the Germans have\nrecorded the names of the girl [indecipherable]. He says, what is this about? He just wanted to\npull my leg, you know? What a character. But he --",
        "A: No --",
        "A: -- I just said that -- that\u2019s what it is, you know.",
        "A: Yeah. He knew that. But I knew what he was up to, just to try to give me a hard time because\nI -- a young guy. And then I was very much involved with interrogating prisoners of war. There\nwas one that -- a few of them volunteered information so they could [indecipherable] before.\nAnd one was -- said that he had a gir -- a ger -- a French girlfriend, and she was expecting. And\nshe got in touch with her office, she would like to have [indecipherable] father. And he said that\nhe was an Alsatian, not a German, so they sent me out to investigate. And sure enough, he says,\nwell, my father was working in Alsace-Lorraine at one time, as a waiter. I says to --",
        "A: Waiter in a hotel -- in a restaurant, yeah. I says, and are you Alsatian? H says, no, my father\nwas working there. Okay. I wrote back a [indecipherable] report, and I se -- send them to the --\nthey moved o -- the mines 1n the -- on the beaches. I was so furious that they tried to take\nadvantage, I say, you know, these French [indecipherable] but I told them --",
        "A: I tol -- I told them to send him to the mine field.",
        "A: Yeah, because the Germans were set to remove the mines on the beaches there.",
        "A: In southern France, and because he had done that, I figured he should be punished.",
        "A: I -- I was a bad guy.",
        "A: Yeah. And then the other one --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Oh yes. The -- you know, the -- he speaks German, th -- my officers, I accepted the job\n[indecipherable] involved in this case. And then there was a case where I mentioned before, this\none was employed by [indecipherable] and he was to -- he has impor-important information for\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: So I drove past Nimes to the farm, and then he told me that the -- this was much later, though,\nwhen Germany had surrendered in -- in May, I believe, \u201945. And he told me that the 19 German\narmy who had come from that 1 -- from our area, had broke up some dirt in a school yard, and\nburied all the radio equipment in there, which is valuable stuff to have, you know. And had\ndumped all the electrical wiring over the side of a cliff. So I made a report to G2 and they sent it\nto general -- General [indecipherable] group -- well he is -- he was the [indecipherable] marshal\nlater on, but he sent his G2 officer there, and they checked into it. I haven\u2019t heard from him since\nthen.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Okay. Each headquarter has a mapping department.",
        "A: It\u2019s a -- a -- a division has the maps for combat if they have to go so and so [indecipherable]\nsuch a place, they have to have maps of all the areas, copies of them at least. They can always\nmake copies later on, they have a special p-process. So they figured hey, you can do that. Well,\nwhat happened first, he says, they had a map of the combats in Russia, and they had this\nlieutenant who kept it up to date. They had the string with a [indecipherable] attached on the\nbottom, and they had pins there, and they had the string going with pins and show the progress\nfrom one day to the next. So he got a different assignment so they put me in there, because they\nhad the BBC every day, they were listening on the radio, and [indecipherable] information as to\nthe progress m-made by the Russians on -- on their front. [indecipherable] in Europe, but also I\nguess they didn\u2019t trust the Russians either at that time. Anyway, so they put me there, and then\n[indecipherable] that\u2019s not enough work for you, so they give me the mapping department. So I -\n- | found out that fish market in Montpellier was selling fish and wrapping them in that excellent\npaper which is used for maps. So I sent somebody to investigate and he said they have a whole\nbunch maps 1n a certain place in Ales. So I found out about that. I took two German POW\u2019s, and\none guard to go with me, and the chauffeur. And we went over there and took back about 20,000\nmaps. That was a gold trove. Those maps are expensive to -- to make. And they -- some were\noverwritten in German, but they were actually French, French maps that they had captured\nbefore. So the general was very pleased, and he had me make some shelves for all of those, it\nwas quite a job.",
        "A: 20,000 maps. You know, it was [indecipherable] to the French army.",
        "A: Because they\u2019re the ones [indecipherable]",
        "A: Maps, you know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The headquarter division 1s in Montpellier.",
        "A: Then my father meet some people there, and he said, you know, we have a lot of people\ncoming back from the camps. We got to do something for them. And he got in touch with Jewish\norganizations, I guess in Paris [indecipherable]. And they were assigned the responsibility for\nhelping those people. And they had about eight or 10 different organizations in that federation.\nMy father was director of the one federation, and five locations in the States, in those days were\non there [indecipherable] the cities. So they obtained money to give out to the refugees, a -- a\nmonthly sum. My father says, no, that is not what you should do. We don\u2019t have to give charity\nto those people, they need something more substantial so they can get back on their feet, like\nhuman beings. Those were profession -- excuse me -- we should try to get them the equipment\nthat they need to go back in their professions. I remember of two specific instances, I guess. One\nwas the shoemaker who needed shoe -- the equipment to repair shoes, and they were able to se --\nhe said okay, we should try to give them a lump sum, equivalent to maybe one or three years of a\ncharity. If they have the money later on, they can repay it and if not -- either they can give more\nto other people, but if not, there you go. And they agreed to that. So he was able to get enough\nmoney for the people to buy equipment that they had needed, and that was an excellent idea,\nbecause the people had self respect again. They came from the camps and had lost all the --",
        "A: Whoever applied. The women got the money to live on, but the -- there was actually to go\nback in business, if they had some business of sorts, yes. But otherwise they -- they didn\u2019t have\nto get that much money, but if they were a family, so that helped, you know.",
        "A: Very few -- Iam sorry -- very few women come back from that -- from there to Montpellier.",
        "A: Not ma -- not many. Not many.",
        "A: Compared to the women there were more men, but not that many, no, no.",
        "A: There were few hundreds probably, at the time. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes.\nto -- to do something, do you know what I mean? There\u2019s this period of great activity of your\nfather.",
        "A: Oh yes, I know [indecipherable] because they had the different groups. One helped the people\nfrom the camps, and then that o-organization to provide them food, and the other organizations\nto try to find family members, housing and so forth. And then I was called in once by one of the\nattorneys, yeah, to go with him. One -- or big department store had been taken over by Jewish\norganization -- the -- the Vichy organization for confiscating Jewish property.",
        "A: So he says, look, we have to reclaim this property. The people there had been -- had\ndisappeared, we don\u2019t know where they are, but we want to get this back into our control in case\nthe people come back. So some local women had bought the property of -- at a auction.",
        "A: So I said fine. He told them they should be at h -- at the office -- at the -- at the store at one\no\u2019clock in the afternoon. I took one soldier with me -- I was an officer at that time, and he went\nwith me. We got there and I -- he says, turn over your keys. They turned over the keys, good-\nbye, and he assumed responsibility for his clients. I hope so.",
        "A: You know [indecipherable] can happen.",
        "A: But that was a -- an activity at least it was justified, take property back first and worry about\nrestitution --",
        "A: Probably three months, because when they rescued people in the camps --",
        "A: -- they came out.",
        "A: Yeah. Newspapers, or --",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. We did not know the extent. We knew some camps, because the first\none was like maybe Mauthausen in Austria, where some of the first was liberated by the western\npowers. Russians liberated Auschwitz.",
        "A: So, you know, a different time frame.",
        "A: Yeah, very shocking, infinitely so, yes.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t dream that people could do that to other people.",
        "A: Oh yes. My father lost that --",
        "A: -- he had his mother and had at least five -- four -- four brothers and a sister, plus their\nfamilies. They were all married and children.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And then we found out, when Jackie, the young boy came back out of\nFlossenberg, and the colonel left him with us, then we found a lot more of what happened over\nthere.",
        "A: Okay, there was American troops in -- went in Germany, they liberated the camp of\nFlossenberg, F-l-o-s-s-e-n-b-e-r-g, and they find this little boy, he\u2019s about 14 - 15 years old, and\nthis American Major Leland, he was American officer, decides that he has no parents any more,\nwell the boy told him he had no more parents, and he wants to adopt him, eventually. So he goes\nwith him -- takes him with him in the unit for awhile. He gets an americ -- an American uniform,\nyou know [indecipherable] troops, and then when he was transferred out to Avignon. There was\na big [indecipherable] Aix [indecipherable] Aix - Aix -- Aix-en-Provence. And the troops are\nthere, the major has a brother over there who\u2019s also a doctor and they come to visit Montpellier.\nAnd somehow or other they come to a Jewish committee of the organizations and they meet my\nfather, and they mention about the little boy -- the boy comes with him too. After awhile the\nmajor 1s supposed to go to the Pacific, and he has met my father, so he asks him what -- will you\ntake care of the boy? He was more welcome because my parents were still missing my brother\nand now he would fill in --",
        "A: -- a-- a void. So said, sure. And he asked when Leland send a letter to [indecipherable] you\nbefore, asking him to help out. Then a -- a few weeks later he makes -- he asked my father make\narrangements with the American consulate in Marseilles. So when the papers are ready, the\ntickets are ready for shipping and all that, my sister and my father are in Marseilles, see the\nconsul there, and everything is finished and Jackie is with them over there, so the amba -- the\namb -- the consul asked my sister, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to go to America, too?\u201d She says, \u201cYes, but\nwe can\u2019t.\u201d Why not? \u201cIt will take years for us to get papers.\u201d He says, \u201cSend me your papers.\u201d It\nwas the beginning of -- it\u2019s the end of May. I [indecipherable] the beginning of March 46. We\nsend the papers in and within a month time we have papers to come to the United States. Now,\nthis was tricky, because you had to have the ships cards, too. Now it\u2019s just a Peter or Paul, which\ncomes first. They would not give us actually the visa. Yes, you ha -- they\u2019re coming to you, but\nyou must show us the visa -- the -- the ship cards, and vice versa. Anyway, I found out that the\nFrench government had some places available on a boat repatriating French citizens back to\nUnited States who had come back to France to fight. So they were -- had priorities to go back to -\n- see. And that included also people in the resistance. When I found out that, I said okay, let\u2019s get\nthe ship cards. We got those, and then we went back and we got the visa, in about one month\u2019s\ntime.",
        "A: It was extraordinary.\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely.",

        "A: I was young [indecipherable]",

        "A: Uh-huh. And then we -- somebody called the news organization over there to receive us, and\nthen get us to the train station.",
        "A: So they sent a lady over there, and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, Jack was already here for -- he go-got here --",
        "A: Oh yes. He came here probably in March, or February.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I suppose. What happened is, my father raised the roof when he -- when we came over here,\nhe went to the Jewish organizations in -- in New York, and Jackie was being taken care of by\nsomebody over there.",
        "A: And he asked them, do you give him any money -- pocket money, anything to go to the\nmovies or stuff like that? No, no. He raised the roof, he says, this child has the right to li -- live\nlike a child. You have a nerve not to -- you know, to treat him as one. And he -- he was really\nmad. He helped him out.

        "A: And he had seen the doctor over there, and they couldn't do too much over there. We came\nover here, and he was here in the winter of \u201946, and we came here in *48 -- yeah, \u201947 was bad\nalso, doctor says get out of New York, go to wa-warm climate. So what he did, we wrote to\nchambers of commerce in Arizona, New Mexico, California and Colorado. And we asked what\nis situation for jobs and housing. Now remember that this was a time when many soldiers were\nbeing discharged, and they were looking for housing too.",
        "A: So it was a competition and for jobs. And they were all discouraging except Arizona. The\nrespondent said, there\u2019s always an opportunity. Come and see for yourself. And so his relatives\nin New York said, you go to Arizona? Aren\u2019t you afraid of the Indians?",
        "A: Of the Indians?",

        "A: So you know, no problem. And then after a few weeks he had rented a store and then we\ncame over here too. And the first thing we did is buy some radio equipment -- equipment to\nrepair radios. [indecipherable] check tubes, radio tubes and -- and al-all that.

I\u2019m not going to have somebody call me at 10 -- 11\no\u2019clock at night that they missed their football or boxing or whatever it is, and I want to have my\nweekends also.

        "A: And there was two sides to it, one had four rooms -- five rooms, the other one six rooms. The\nlieutenant and his wife had one side, and I was on the other side with my parents. The lieutenant\nwas transferred out, he was a military justice officer, and I had a whole 11 rooms there. One day\na colonel from the headquarter says, \u201cLoewy, I want to talk to you. Your apartment, I want it. Il\ngive you one month to find another apartment.\u201d I said, he had collaborated with the Germans and\nhe wants me to give him the apartment? No way. A month goes by, \u201cLoewy, have you found\nsomething?\u201d I said no. He said, \u201cI'll find something for you.\u201d So he finds something and he says,\n\u201cLoewy, I want you to move out.\u201d I said, \u201cI refuse.\u201d \u201cYou what?\u201d He\u2019s -- what happened then?\nHad me called before the commander of the garrison, colonel. And they -- they say -- the two of\n-- I-I took an attorney with me. I was cautious there. You\u2019re sure [indecipherable] give up the\napartment? I said, it\u2019s not a military matter, it\u2019s a civil matter. Had nothing to do with\n[indecipherable] o-or anything else. You are refusing? Yes, I refuse. And then the other colonel\nbawls me out. Then I said to him, \u201cColonel, do you know your army regulations?\u201d Yes, I do.\n\u201cAnd you Colonel, you know your army regulations?\u201d Yes I do. \u201cWhat right do you have to talk\nto me that way in front of a non-com?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, no, you cannot insult somebody in front of a\nlower rank military.\u201d He turned all colors. And they send him out, and then that didn\u2019t happen\nagain. At two o\u2019clock in the afternoon I\u2019m called to see the general, and the general says, \u201cYou\ngot to get out of there. You have to go out, period.\u201d I tell my parents [indecipherable]\napartments, they said, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, forget about it. Let him have it.\u201d I move out of\nthere. Before I move out, I have a friend of mine in G1, which is military personnel, the French\narmy. And he says, \u201cFred, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you mean what\u2019s going on?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cThey are talking about sending you to Africa, to repatriate Senegalese troops.\u201d I said,\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said -- he says, \u201c\u201cWe know when the ships go there, we don\u2019t know when they come\nback.\u201d Oh-oh, I figured that the -- the colonel was behind it. The next day he says -- he calls me\nup in secret because clearly I wasn\u2019t supposed to know what\u2019s going on there. He says, \u201cNow\nthey are trying to send you to Vietnam -- Indo-China.\u201d Not Vietnam, Indo-China. I says, time for\nme to get out of the army. So I had signed up for the army for the duration of the war, and why I\ndid this, I put down in ink, in Europe. So the war is over in Europe. So nothing happens, nu -- so\nI figure they are going to send me out before I have a chance to get out of the army. So I send a\nletter to the general, \u201c\u201cGeneral, I demand my discharge.\u201d Nothing happens. So I just had to go one\nstep higher. I write to the war department, care of the general -- the general command. The same\nafternoon I got dischar -- discharged. They knew I wasn\u2019t going to play around then.",
