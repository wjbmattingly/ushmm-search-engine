This is tape number one, side A. Now, I would like to have you\npronounce your last name and spell it for us.",
        "Answer: Bucur, B-u-c-u-r.",
        "Q: And what is the origin of your last name?",
        "A: It\u2019s Romanian in ancestry.",
        "Q: What does it mean?",
        "A: Oh, it means happy, it means glad. Mostly happy.",
        "Q: Where were you born?",
        "A: I was born here in the United States, in Youngstown, Ohio.",
        "Q: When were you born?",
        "A: March 5\", 1925.",
        "Q: And where did you grow up?",
        "A: I grew up actually in Youngstown, Ohio and went to college from -- graduating\nfrom high school and then actually never really went back again.",
        "Q: What language or languages were spoken in your home when you were growing\nup?\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: \u2019'm of Romanian ancestry and consequently both my parents had emigrated from\nRomania and as a result spoke Romanian in th -- in the house and when I went to\nschool, the elementary school, I used to answer the teacher sometimes in Romanian\nwhen I didn\u2019t know how to speak it in English. But nevertheless, mostly Romanian as\na youngster, and then -- excuse me -- as I grew up it just completely changed to\nEnglish and didn\u2019t use it again.",
        "Q: Can you tell me please about your hometown from your childhood? What kinds of\nchildhood memories do you have of your hometown?",
        "A: Well, Youngstown at that time was a very thriving me-metropolis because it was\non the theater circuit. My father was a very avid theater-goer, so I recall going to the\nHippodrome and the Palace theaters and seeing the old magician shows with\nThurston and Blackstone and those, and seeing Al Jolson u-up on the stage in\nperson while in my father\u2019s lap, and then later on as his a-accompanying\n[indecipherable].",
        "Q: What else do you remember about your hometown?",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- of course I remember going to high school, perhaps more so than\nanything else. I was a pretty good student actually, I was val-valedictorian of my\nclass. And it was during the early wartime, in -- in 1943 when I graduated, and --",
        "Q: I-I\u2019m going to not get the war years just yet.",
        "A: Okay.\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "Q: Were there many Jews in your town when you were growing up?",
        "A: Certainly in the area that I grew up in because it was a -- what we call a mixed\narea. There were Jews, there were French, there were Italians, and -- in fact, it was\nalmost a -- a conglomeration of just every -- every language there was spoken. And\nas a result, actually when I was younger, I spoke some of the other languages, too. I\nlearned how to speak a little Hungarian and a little bit of Italian, which makes it\neasier because Romanian and Italian are pretty much aligned. And under those\ncircumstances even as a youngster, we went to each other\u2019s homes and so forth and\nheard it spoken because that\u2019s what most people spoke at that time. And, oh, we were\nat that time, foreigners. My father had ra -- come here, as I said, working in the steel\nmills and when the war broke out and -- first World War, he volunteered to go and he\nwas in the American expeditionary force, and when the war was over he\nautomatically became a citizen. And he was still a young man, he was only in his\n20\u2019s and decided to go back to Romania and find somebody to marry. And he met\nmy mother and they had a -- a courtship that lasted a short period of time, and he got\nmarried there in Romania and came here, and brought her with him. And s -- at the\ntime that she came to this country, she was pregnant and I was born -- she got here in\nFebruary and I was born in March, in 1925. I can always say I was conceived there\nand dedicated here.\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "Q: You said you came from a community with a lot of different people\n[indecipherable] different --",
        "A: Ethnic groups, yeah.",
        "Q: -- ethnic groups. How did they all get along, and how -- specifically how did\npeople get along?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: How did the Jewish community get along with the Christian community?",
        "A: We had a ver -- marvelously -- that\u2019s -- we had friends that were Romanian Jews\nthat spoke Romanian and actually they didn\u2019t call themselves Jewish. I don\u2019t think\nthere was any distinction back in those days a-about being a Hebrew or a Jew or\nwhatever it was. And you were Greek or you were Italian, that\u2019s fine. And we all\nplayed together and we all commiserated with each other when things went wrong,\nand it was -- the relationship was exceptional, I think.",
        "Q: You told me about your father\u2019s livelihood, but you didn\u2019t tell me his name. What\nwas his name?",
        "A: His -- his name was John also. So I\u2019m really, to all intents and purposes, junior,\nbut he never used his middle name, so I -- but I have, so I -- that distinguishes me\nfrom him, cause I\u2019m a Charles.",
        "Q: And what was your mother\u2019s name?\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Victoria, and she was -- her maiden name was\nMorjiniana, which just means marginal in nature, coming from the mountain area,\nand her father\u2019s and -- and her -- her parents were from the mountains, the munchan,\nin Transylvania, that part of Romania that is western part of the Carpathian\nmountains.",
        "Q: What work did your mother do?",
        "A: My mother had finished school and -- at mo -- moment that my father brought her\nhere. She went to school here to speak English, and she was a seamstress for a period\nof time and during the war working in a -- a -- as a supervisor in a factory making\nuniforms and raincoats and so forth for the military.",
        "Q: Do you have any siblings?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m an only child.",
        "Q: You mentioned high school, do you remember anything about elementary school,\nand do you know the name of your elementary school?",
        "A: Oh, I have some nice, fond thoughts of my elementary school because in the\nfourth grade I had the teacher named McLaughlin who was very fond of me and I\nwas a good student and she challenged me in more ways than one, in the work that I\nwas doing because I got special work over and above what she taught the general\nclass, because it was such a mixed group. And it was at that time that my mother and\nI went to visit Europe and this teacher encouraged it, even though I was going to be\nAugust 18, 2003\nabsent for a period of time, and encouraged it very strongly and wa -- I wrote to her\nand we communicated during the time I was gone. As a result though, I was gone\nabout a year and a half and went to school there, 1-in Romania, so going back to the -\n- my parent\u2019s homes. And -- but decided at that time -- the decision, that is, was left\nto me by my parents as to whether I wanted to stay there or whether I wanted to come\nback here and I chose to come back here, wanting to be back in -- in America, and\nfrom then on it was just here.",
        "Q: When you were a child, what were your plans for your future, or your ambitions?",
        "A: As -- as a child my own ambitions were always -- they were led by my parents\nbecause the thing that they wanted most of all was for me to go to school. And\nwhatever it was that I did, it didn\u2019t make any big difference. I always leaned toward\nbeing a doctor, and my father said, if that\u2019s what you want to be, that\u2019s fine, go\nahead, let\u2019s -- but you\u2019ve got to excel in school and -- and this was the time. And of\ncourse the depression held things back considerably during that time. And we always\nfared very well, though, because my father had a good -- good job and worked se-\nseveral days a week and so that we always didn\u2019t have to worry about whether we\nhad enough food on the table or anything.",
        "Q: What did you do for fun when you were a kid?",
        "A: Well, abs -- I was pretty athletic so I wa -- we played baseball and football. I\nplayed a little baseball. We had baseball group that collected in the neighborhood and\nAugust 18, 2003\nwe played other neighborhoods, so we had -- th-that was a real big, going thing. And\nfootball, I tried football in high school for a short period of time, but I was wiser than\nmost kids and I quit it. They didn\u2019t pay very much in those days.",
        "Q: Did you come from a religiously observant family?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. My father came from a minister\u2019s family. Actually, a second family.\nHis father was married and had five children and th-the diphtheria epidemic hit them\nand all of them died, including his wife, and he was left single and still a young man\nand a minister. And he remarried and then he had the five other children and my\nfather was the youngest of those five. A-Actually a favorite of my -- of my\ngrandfather. But they -- he was a minister there and my father kept all the -- the\n[indecipherable] and all holidays and -- and -- and I -- I grew up that way cause we\nwere Orthodox and un -- under those circumstances, we went to church. When he\ncame here as a young man, he built the church that was the Orthodox church. They\ndug it with their own hands and shovels and so forth to put the foundations in and so\non, it was just something. The church still stands, too.",
        "Q: The name of the church?",
        "A: It\u2019s Saint Mary\u2019s in Youngstown. And then Holy Cross is what it\u2019s called now\ncause they moved into a big section of town now, near the Butler\u2019s Art Museum and\nthe -- and the Youngstown colleges in a very, very special section in Wick Avenue.",
        "Q: Did you have any favorite traditions or holidays when you were a child?\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: Yes, Easter is our biggest tradition and most favorite. Not only my parents, but I\nguess it\u2019s because I was a youngster it always 1s, and it was always a -- one of our\nbiggest holidays.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Oh, I guess it was because of the -- the -- the birth of Christ and all and the story\nthat goes along with it and -- and how it all happened and what it meant to begin\nwith.",
        "Q: Did you ever witness any anti-Semitism in your childhood before the war?",
        "A: There -- there was no such thing in no -- not in our neighborhood, no. This was a\nmixed neighborhood as I mentioned before. None. No.",
        "Q: What do you remember hearing about Hitler before the war started? Did you hear\nanything at all?",
        "A: Yes, from my father particularly because he was in World War I and the stories\nthat he told about that war were easily translated into what was going on there now.\nAnd he was quite happy that I had decided not to stay there because that\u2019s when\nHitler was rising in his power and he said, this man is evil. And some of the things\nthat he was perpetrating against his own -- own people there, even though he wasn\u2019t a\nreal German, were pretty atrocious.\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "Q: It sounds like your father was quite aware of what was happening in Germany,\nbut we-were you also aware of things like, let\u2019s say the Berlin Olympics, do you\nremember that?",
        "A: Yes, I do. And Kristallnacht, yes, yes, yeah. The reason for that is because my\nfather was a very avid follower of what was going on and s -- and not only by paper\nbut radio had just come in during this particular time and we had a good radio that we\nkept up with what was going on, and as a result it rubbed off on me because when we\ntalked about it and -- even at church or anyplace else, and the men spoke, the children\nwere there and we listened and we heard an-and participated actually, in -- in many\nof the discussions that were had.",
        "Q: Do you remember any of the things that were said in church about Hitler and\nwhat was going on in Germany?",
        "A: Oh yes, that -- that he was an evil man that had deposed the -- most of the\nhierarchy that was there in Germany and was taking control at that particular time,\nand that he had started blo -- marking the Jews and putting a-armbands on them. And\nhe was taking the books that were written by them at that time and everybody was\nsaying that this was an evil action.",
        "Q: Do you remember your friends from your multi-ethnic neighborhood ever talking\nabout events in Europe before the war?\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: Yes, I had one that was pretty close. He was Polish. He had his family and his\nsister, So -- were older than I was -- or he wasn\u2019t, but th-thi -- he had older sisters,\nand they taught us how to dance, and -- and they were the -- the hoi polloi of the\narea, actually, for that matter. The girls were, they were just beautiful. And they were\nvery, very strongly against anything th -- and they were strong Catholics. There they\nwere, strong Catholics with an Orthodox boy in their midst, and that was me, and --\nbut we loved each other an-and got along quite well. And they -- they also were\naware of what was going on, very, very, very much so.",
        "Q: Did you ever see any newsreels or anything before the war that showed what was\nhappening over there?",
        "A: Yes, I remember the eye and ears of the world that we used to see at -- as -- as a\nyoungster. In between features at the movies there would always be some news thing\nand we would see what was happening and see the crowds and the way that people\nwere responding and all the Germans were responding to Hitler. They were -- it\nseemed now that I look back over it, as 1f they were mesmerized by this man and that\nhe was a hypnotist that had them under control, because it was all seeming so put on,\nbut it wasn\u2019t just put on.",
        "Q: Do you have any other memories that stand out in your mind from the time before\nthe war?\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: I guess there -- there -- there would be good times and bad times. I remember that\nduring the depression my -- I wanted to get a typewriter and just to get a typewriter\nwas an expensive thing at that time, 1t was maybe 50 or 75 dollars, well my\ngoodness. And my father said, well, we will get you the typewriter, but you got to\nteach yourself how to type. And I says okay. So he bought a typewriter for me and I\ngot the books with it and taught myself how to type. And then went to take it in\nschool, in high school and the teacher said, after I sat down there, she said, you\nalready know how. I\u2019ll give you credit for the class. In the meantime, go do\nsomething else. So I was -- that was something that really stood me in good stead. I\nrecall that specifically because of -- of how it came about. And most of the things\nthat I -- that I wanted as a youngster, being an only child, I got on the basis that I\ncould earn them and -- and use them. They were not something that was not\nutilitarian, they were always something that could add to my benefit, or our benefit,\nor our total benefit, or everybody\u2019s benefit.",
        "Q: Do you have any recollections of when Hitler moved into Austria or\nCzechoslovakia? Do you have [indecipherable]",
        "A: Mm-hm, the Sudetenland, yes, very much so. My father was just upset, I mean\nupset. I remember him personally being upset, saying how could this -- how could\nthis happen, and what is Chamberlain doing over there in England, mollifying these\npeople, you know, and -- and saying that this is not right. And the people that we, in\nAugust 18, 2003\nour neighborhood were concerned. And th-they were worried about our being -- go-\ngoing to war. My father didn\u2019t want me to go in the service either, and he says, you\nknow, I already did, I spent all my time in the service. Why should you have to go,\nagain? So --",
        "Q: Do you remember any of your Jewish friends saying anything about all these\nevents at the time?",
        "A: Yes, yes. The Jewish friends that I had, in fact one of -- one of mine was very\nclose, taught me how to play chess. He was a very intelligent youngster, he was a\ncouple of years older than I, lived up the street. And he said -- I was playing checkers\nwith one of the other neighbors, and he said, did you ever play chess? And I s --\nnever even paid any attention to it, I knew what it was, but we didn\u2019t have it in school\nback in those days. And he says, well Ill bring my chessboard down and I\u2019 Il teach\nyou how, but you\u2019re never going to beat me. And I says, oh, come on. Four or five\nyears went by and I finally did beat him. But then that was about the last time I\u2019d\nseen him of -- really, because I left when I was 17, I went to college and I was in\ncollege when I went into the service. So I never really came back to Youngstown,\nOhio after that. All my memories are from 17 down instead of up. Just going back to\nvisit my folks is about the only thing that --",
        "Q: What did this fr -- you didn\u2019t tell me the name of this friend who taught you chess,\nbut wha-what did he say about what was happening in Europe?\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: Oh, they -- they -- they said that this -- this was awful. Why are they picking on\nthe Jewish people and why are wa -- bu-but it wasn\u2019t only that, my father was\npointing out to them that they -- th-that they were incarcerating people in camps and\nthings like that that weren\u2019t Jewish, they were just politically against what he was for,\nand that -- and that was what they were saying. And -- and so many of them, of\ncourse, had relatives that were there, and they had relatives in Romania, but most of\nthe ones that we knew were of Romanian ancestry, and so that the ones that were\nRomanian would eat Romanian food and the ethnic mixture, and they spoke\nRomanian. They didn\u2019t -- the ones that I knew did not speak the Jewish -- the\nHebraic language at all, they spoke Romanian. And many of them, when somebody\nwould say, well what are you, said I\u2019m a Romanian. Well, so I\u2019m a Romanian Jew,\nwhat difference does it make?",
        "Q: How did you learn that Hitler had invaded Poland and the war started? Do you\nremember the moment that you first heard about it?",
        "A: Yes, it was in a newspaper, headlines in a newspaper. Was Hitler invades Poland,\nand if I remember the Sudetenland, that -- going into Czechoslovakia, the same way\nagain, newspaper. And of course the radio subsequently, but 1t was newspaper.",
        "Q: You mentioned Chamberlain, let me ask you, what was the reaction in this\ncountry when Hitler made his deal with Stalin?",
        "A: At that time they thought that Stalin was a great guy, because they felt that maybe\nAugust 18, 2003\nRussia would be our stalwart person and that would be against Hitler and -- and the\nGerman Reich, except that they had signed the pact themselves at that time. And my\nfather had said, was very wary, he said it-1t\u2019s not worth the paper it\u2019s written on. And\nhe said, it\u2019s just not going to be of any consequence. And that\u2019s as far as I think I\ncould go on that at this particular time.",
        "Q: What was happening in your life in 1939 and 1940, where were you?",
        "A: I was in high school. 1939, four years of high school to 1943 1s when I graduated.\nNow, I graduated in January of \u201943 because of the -- the war, they accelerated certain\n[indecipherable] so we had two graduations, one in January and one in June. I\ngraduated in January and I think two weeks after graduation I was down\n[indecipherable] off the bus in Athens, Ohio going to Ohio University. I had picked\nthat as the place to go to school.",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s stay in high school for just a little while.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember discussions about the war and what was happening in Europe\nand also in Japan while you were in school? Did you have any discussions in the\nclassroom?",
        "A: Yes, we did. I was a debater to begin with and we had considerable discussion of\nthe political situation at that particular time, a-aside from the ra -- who shall own the\nrailroads, or other topics that we used in debating. But there were other groups, like\nAugust 18, 2003\nthe Greek groups that were -- to put that in context, like the Greek groups that are in\ncollege, these were small little splinters like the National Honor Society and other\ngroups like that. YMCA and the [indecipherable] and so forth, and that were very\nmuch concerned as to what was going on because we were approaching the age of\nwhich we would probably be serving in -- in the army or navy or otherwise if we\nwent to war. And some of my -- my confreres, including myself, were leery about the\nfact that we would be going to war. And we were young, but I suppose that we got\nthat from our parents, mostly and I don\u2019t think that was an individualistic thing that --\nI don\u2019t think that I was that -- that intelligent to be able to fear that at the time.\nYoungsters at -- in those ages are -- you can\u2019t beat them. They\u2019re -- they can\u2019t --\nnothing is ever going to happen to them. It always happens to somebody else. So as a\nresult, we didn\u2019t fear much other than the fact that we might have to be going to war.",
        "Q: One last question -- I hope it\u2019s a last question about your high school and -- and\neverything else. You mentioned that your community was very multi-ethnic. Was\nthere a -- a group of students who were, you know, more -- no -- traditionally\nAmerican in the sense that their parents were born in this country, perhaps even their\ngrandparents. And my question is, did they see things differently than you, in your\ncommunity? Your friends who were, you know, first generation Americans in some\ncases. Did the people whose ancestry -- no, th-the people who were more American\nin terms of generations, did they see things differently than you and your friends did?\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "Q: No, I don\u2019t think so. I think they were all pretty -- pretty much -- that\u2019s why I\nmentioned the [indecipherable] and the YMCA groups and things like th-there --\nthey were comprised of the very same ethnic groups that I came from so that we all\nwent to school together and we all learned things together and we were all exposed to\nthe same thing. Perhaps differently intellectually as to the levels, but nevertheless, it\nwas pretty much the same. We\u2019ve had a 50 year reunion a number of years ago, and\nmany of them showed up and -- that had survived and we lost -- lost some of them in\nthe war, but it was interesting to see that -- the changes that had occurred in these\nindividuals only physically, but mentally they\u2019re still in the same area they were in\nthen, at the time.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re saying that --",
        "A: In other words, they didn\u2019t really move out of their milieu as far a-as that was\nconcerned. Many of them improved upon what they were, but many of them did not.",
        "Q: In retrospect, would you say that you and your friends were pretty politically\nsavvy for your age, considering the situation --",
        "A: I think my friends, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Pearl Harbor, how did you hear about it?",
        "A: December seventh. Actually I heard about it by my father telling me that when I\ncame home from school that we had been attacked by the Japanese [indecipherable]\nAugust 18, 2003\nin the newspapers and the radio and the else -- everybody was talking about it, you\nknow, but that\u2019s the only way I heard about it.",
        "Q: What was your reaction?",
        "A: Well, my -- ab-absolute horror, because it was unexpected, as far as we knew at\nthat time. And the horror of the matter was that there was no retaliation. I mean, we --\nwe were sitting ducks, and they just came and -- just tried to destroy us.",
        "Q: How old were you on that day?",
        "A: In 1941, \u201925, I was 16.",
        "Q: Did you wish that you could enlist right away?",
        "A: [laughs]. Oh, not quite at that time, I -- I was too inculcated by my father to sa --\nwant to go to war right away. It was only after I got into college that that happened.",
        "Q: In 1941, in -- before Pearl Harbor and immediately right after Pearl Harbor, did\nyou have any idea what was happening to the Jews in Europe?",
        "A: No. We just knew that Hitler was being very strongly opposed to their function\nand he was selecting them out, as I mentioned earlier. And that\u2019s about all that we\nknew about tt.",
        "Q: Had you been carefully following the -- the war news?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What languages did you learn in school, if any?\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: Oh, I took Latin all the way through, as much as you can possibly get it, cause it\nwas easy for me, being of Romanian ancestry, and that wasn\u2019t a real -- and I -- I -- I\ntook Greek and Romanian, of course, 1s what I spoke at home, and that was it.",
        "Q: You said that you were a student until 1943?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. I\u2019m going to pause to change tape and we\u2019 ll pick up in 1943.",
        "A: All right.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: -- Bucur. This is tape number one, side B. And we were now up to June 1943. I'd\nlike you to tell me how your life changed, and walk me through the changes.",
        "A: Well, as I mentioned to you earlier, in January I graduated in 43, cause it was\nearly graduation and I went to college. I had applied to a number of colleges and we\nfelt that going within the state would be a ma -- more [indecipherable] you save a\nlittle more, but th -- and state tuition would be less. However, I didn\u2019t have to have\ntuition, I was val-valedictorian of my class and as a result I had a scholarship. So I\nhad a scholarship for actually four years, but wa -- during the first year at Ohio\nUniversity, a number of us decided that may-maybe we ought to go in the service and\n-- instead of just sitting around and waiting, that as it so happened, I-I was called up\nfor the draft anyway, so it didn\u2019t make any -- much difference. The thing that\u2019s sur-\nAugust 18, 2003\nsurprising is -- 1s that when I was called, we had volunteered, and I was called to go\nto a railroad station and -- and from there to go to Columbus, Ohio where there\n[indecipherable] four days, and where they were gonna decide what to do with us.\nThe thing that really troubled us a lot was the fact that when d -- I was -- went to the\nstation, my father and mother came with me and we went to the same station that my\nfather went to in the first World War and I si -- was leaning against a poster and he\njust broke down and cried. He says, I was right there, right there, I saw myself, he\nsaid, just going. And I was an only son, I wasn\u2019t supposed to go in the service, an\nonly son. Also had a perforated eardrum, which kept just about everybody out, but it\ndidn\u2019t make any difference, they needed to fill their quotas back in the old days, and I\nwouldn\u2019t have told -- told them anyhow, so I want -- wanted to go in the service. And\nthe -- the thing that I remember so clearly was saying goodbye at the -- at that time,\nand -- and hope -- hoping that I would be back again at some time later. And\nfortunately I did.",
        "Q: Can you give me some historical context? What was happening in the war at the\ntime that you went into the service? It -- you know, give me some background in\nEurope and -- and also the war of Japan.",
        "A: Well, a-at that time England was having a tough time because they were being\nbombarded and the -- Germany had just developed the -- the -- the V1 rocket and\nthey were shooting these rockets over and I remember that very well. I was a physics\nAugust 18, 2003\nmajor in high school and I was quite interested in the -- that type of development. So\nI followed that pretty closely from that standpoint and then they developed a V2\nrocket as well later, while I was still in the service. But the -- the context of the war at\nthat time was that, you know, we -- we have to get into that European war because\nthe ja -- the Japanese have already attacked us and we\u2019re already at war, and that we\nhave to go ahead and then do something just as my father did before. And I think that\nwas the attitude that many of us had.",
        "Q: How far had Hitler expanded in Europe when you went in?",
        "A: Oh, he had taken the Sudetenland and Poland and -- and there was -- at that --\nwell, he was in France and that Paris had fallen and -- and was in control of most of\n-- most of -- actually, most of Europe because he o-obviously, yo-you know, he was\n-- he had taken Sweden -- I mean, not Sweden, Denmark. That was a Scandinavian\ncountry and yes, that\u2019s about it and yeah, he was in control of just about everything\nand he was now starting his Russian front.",
        "Q: Now you\u2019re in the service. Tell me about the -- the training. Where were you\nassigned, and -- and walk me through the t --",
        "A: Well, we went to -- we were taken to Fort Hayes in Columbus, Ohio and we left\nth -- th -- in -- in the evening, and naturally nobody is going to be sleeping and all\nnight we were up singing and playing cards and just about everything else. And we\ngot there and they fed us breakfast and then they put us in a room and examined us.\nAugust 18, 2003\nTh -- I mean, you had a -- an examination of -- of written tests, that were -- one part\nof it was written and another part was oral and then they had a test for sound, code,\nMorse code, the dot dashes and so forth, whether you\u2019re capable. And we were all\nexamined and all that and then you were sent to the places that they thought that you\nwould do well in. I had a pretty high score, they sent me to Fort Sill, Oklahoma to\nschool. And the school there was an observation sound and flash school, and we had\nit quite nice as a matter of fact. And some of my confreres that went with me went to\nthe cavalry and some of them went to the tank outfit and to the -- the mule teams and\n-- and also, depending upon what their capabilities were, or what they felt their\ncapabilities were and whether they were intelligent enough to handle it. And actually\nwhile I was at Fort Sill and th -- learned that that school there, I actually got a minor\nin engineering because it was in engineering that we had to learn how to use a -- a --\nsurveying equipment, Theodolites and -- and the various other methods of -- of\nmarking out areas o-of importance against the enemy, that is. I\u2019ll describe that a little\nlater, if you want.",
        "Q: So you went through this training program, and then what happened to you?",
        "A: Oh, the one -- then we were da -- moved overseas.",
        "Q: When you were sent overseas, what was your rank and what was your\nassignment?\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: I was a private. We were all privates, nobody had any rank in our school, of any\nkind. And we went -- well, actually we were -- in part we were one of the largest\nconvoys that every crossed the -- th-the Atlantic Ocean, it was thousands of ships.\nOur ship and our equipment that was given us, was as if we were going to be going to\nAfrica because the African theater was still in full force at that time, and we had\nsome equipment that was all -- and we -- we -- we knew that\u2019s where we were going.\nWe ended up in Reykjavik, Iceland. And from there we watched the skyline and\nthen dropped down into England from there. And in England we got new equipment\nand new things at a new camp. Actually, we went -- we were stationed at Cardiff in\nWales. And from Cardiff in Wales, then we were sent to the unit that would need\nyou. And our unit was sent to an area called [indecipherable] in -- in Devonshire.\nAnd it was a -- we commandeered a big castle that was there and had nice quarters\nand -- and so -- and trained and trained our people there on the wartime basis instead\nof the Fort Sill basis, where I had the initial training. War 1s a little different than the\nbooks tell you all the time. So we trained there and then from there we moved on a\nnumber of occasions, as if we were going to go on invasion, but we didn\u2019t. And then\nthey moved the whole unit to Bournemouth, which is a resort on the channel, a\nbeautiful place. And about every other day we would go out as if we were going to\ninvade and we didn\u2019t, and months went by and -- until June sixth, and June sixth the\ninvasion occurred and we were still on the ship. And we only landed D plus two, but\nAugust 18, 2003\nwe Started out on the -- the fifth and went out and -- and went in and pulled back,\nwent in and pulled back. We were artillery people, actually, and the work that we did,\nthere was no place to work, as yet. So as a result, until they had taken land, there was\nnothing much that we could do. So they held us back a-as much as they could. Plus\nthe fact that the bombardments of the Germans was pushing our ships back.",
        "Q: Tell me about those two days between --",
        "A: This was Omaha Beach.",
        "Q: Right. But the two days you said you -- you didn\u2019t get there til D plus two.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: What was the experience of those two days?",
        "A: It was -- actually, 1t was rather jocular. Everybody wanted to get in there and get\nin there and fight, and go -- and -- and get this thing over with. And after the f -- the\nfirst few hours in that you didn\u2019t land, and waited to go in, you knew that you were\ngoing to be going in soon enough, it was, as I said jocular, right, everybody was\npretty happy about going in.",
        "Q: Did you have any idea what was happening to the people who were on the beach\nat -- you know, the first ones?",
        "A: Yes, we saw it.",
        "Q: You could see it?",
        "A: Yes, we could see it. We could see from -- from our ship just exactly what was\nAugust 18, 2003\nhappening, and th-th-the jocularity I\u2019m talking about only was an in -- an internal\nfeeling of wanting to get out there and do something. We were not happy about what\nwas happening to our people because they were -- it was pretty bad because the tide\ncame in and they -- they had dug in and the tide, some of them drowned in there, in\nthe tide. And they were -- th-the -- Omaha Beach, if-if you\u2019ve seen some of the\nnewspaper articles and so forth, show there\u2019s -- there\u2019s are -- there\u2019s a large cliff that\ncomes down there, that we had to scale that particular cliff before we could go ahead\nand occupy any territory. And they were having a tough time because there were\npillboxes all along the line and they were pretty well en -- they were pretty well\nentrenched. But as you know we -- we did do it. And D plus two, we went in.",
        "Q: Where were the members of your unit from?",
        "A: Most of the members of my unit were all from the east of the Mississippi River.\nBut we were all pretty much, you know, cause we were picked out by our grades\nfrom the exams that we did as to whether you were going to go to -- and there was a -\n- there was a time there that they wanted to put us in the ASTP, which was army\nspecialized training program, in which th -- you know, if you got into that program\nyou didn\u2019t have to go to war, which of course was a foolish thing because that -- that\nwasn\u2019t so. What Roosevelt had done was he created this large army specialized\ntraining program and took the flower of the youth [indecipherable] the kids that\nwere intelligent and knew everything that was going on, and under those\nAugust 18, 2003\ncircumstances he suddenly says, well I\u2019m going to close that up and then send them\noverseas. Then he sent the best and the flower out there because they\u2019re the ones that\ncould -- could make decisions quickly and rapidly, rather than having a -- other\ngroups do-doing it. But we didn\u2019t ga -- we didn\u2019t get into the ASTP.",
        "Q: Were there any Jews serving with you at the time?",
        "A: Yes, one of my group -- closest friends in the various unit that I was with, the 17\"\nField Artillery Observation Battalion was Theodore Singer. And he was also a chess\nplayer and I told him that he would never beat me. And we played and we pretty\nmuch evened out all the time when -- he\u2019s a very, very brilliant man. He has since\ndied.",
        "Q: Who was your commanding officer?",
        "A: Brown, Captain Brown.",
        "Q: Did you witness any anti-Semitism at any time in the military?",
        "A: Never.",
        "Q: Did you witness any anti-foreign sentiment any time in the military?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you have a chance to read \u201cStars and Stripes\u201d in those days?",
        "A: Oh yes, absolutely, very -- we enjoyed that very much, with Bill Maudlin and his\ncartoons.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to ask you about \u201cStars and Stripes\u201d again later --\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- I just wanted to make sure. Tell me what action you saw. Now we\u2019re at -- at D-\nDay plus two.",
        "A: Well, we, actually we got stymied at Saint-Lo. We had gone inland that far and\nthe action that we saw was getting our units in t -- into function. Now, an observation\nbattalion is a flash and sound unit. And by flash meaning that there are outposts that\nare put out into no man\u2019s land and you can have two of those outposts, generally and\nthey look at the enemy territory and they see the flash of a gun, and they have an\n[indecipherable] to take they can adjust on their instrument where that flash\noccurred and then they triangulate on the flash and they send it back to a central point\nbehind, and then that\u2019s pinpointed and those coordinates then are s-sent to our\nartillery and our artillery fires on them. That\u2019s flash. Now, the s -- the sound unit is a\nlittle more complicated is because they -- we sunk microphones down a -- a distance\nof about a foot and a half or two, in a semi-circular fashion in no man\u2019s land so that\nthe sound that traveled from the gun that fired there in the enemy territory would hit\nmicrophone number one, before it hit number two or three, and in succession you\nwould draw a line to the microphone that was hit and then pinpoint where it came\nfrom, within about a foot and a half, actually. So we\u2019d call those coordinates and of\ncourse the artillery loved us. They said, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re our boys because they\u2019re\nthe ones that tell us where to fire. We can\u2019t see a thing, yet -- un-un-until we have a\nAugust 18, 2003\ncoordinate that\u2019s set on. And th-those microphone, sound travels 1100 feet per\nsecond. As a result, as that hit the microphone, it triangulated in on that\n[indecipherable]. We\u2019d call it back and they would fire.",
        "Q: How long were you at Saint-Lo?",
        "A: Oh, we were at Saint-Lo quite awhile. We lost our captain, Captain Brown went\nout reconnoitering, he wanted to see whether one of the towns over there was taken\nor not, and there was a little pocket of Germans that th -- supposedly it was taken, but\nwasn\u2019t. But we were stymied at Saint-Lo for a long period of time, and nevertheless,\nas he traveled with his driver the Germans came up and they shot him. The driver\nescaped and was captured, and we -- we captured him back later on, but nevertheless,\nwe lost the captain. That didn\u2019t -- we were battery B of the 17\" observation battalion.",
        "Q: Then what ha -- you were there for awhile, and then when you finally were able to\nmove, what happened next?",
        "A: Oh, one -- once we were able to move, we moved rather rapidly. In fact,\nsometimes they moved so rapidly we didn't have a chance to set up and the -- our\nartillery would argue with them, hey, wait a minute, once you set up, what are we\ngoing to fire at, you know, until we get somebody out there. And we were the only\nunit in -- in -- in the V-corps, th-that area, so as a result it was a little difficult for\nthem to really have a target, otherwise they\u2019d have to just time fire everything.\nNevertheless, the thing about it was that our -- our -- our feeling was that they were\nAugust 18, 2003\nmoving too rapidly. But we moved ver -- very, very rapidly and once we got up to\nthe Argentan Falaise area, that -- that -- that was the -- that -- they called that the\nArgentan Falaise gap in which we encircled about six or seven companies of\nGermans completely. And un-under those -- while there, we were a -- stopped\nbecause we had -- had circled them and the continued to fight down to the last. So we\n-- we went back into functioning again. And right about this -- this particular time we\nhad heard that there was a -- another sound and flash observation battalion being sent\nfrom Fort Sill, th-the 285\". And that\u2019s the one that had the massacre occur at\nMalmedy in Belgium. And that\u2019s at the time of the big push that the Germans -- the -\n- the -- pushing us into the ocean is what they were trying to do. The Battle of the\nBulge, as they\u2019ve called it. And we had conferred with the eight -- 285\" when it came\nthere that they can\u2019t function the way they did at Fort Sill, that this 1s war, and that --\nthat it\u2019s a different thing. But they were young, with young officers and young --\nyoung companies and they just went the wrong way. Actually, what really happened\nwas that the leader, one of their lieutenants was going down the road, and there was -\n- the road signs were made out of wood in those days and they pointed the direction\nof where they -- you were going and -- and he said, now this 1s the route we\u2019re\nsupposed to take, instead of looking at his map and being sure. Well, the Germans\nhad turned the -- turned the sign around, and they went directly into the Germans.\nAnd they got caught by the SS troops and about a hundred and some -- 20 of them or\nAugust 18, 2003\nso, were massacred right on the spot. And several of them did survive that we finally\ngot to, but it was a pretty bad situation.",
        "Q: You mentioned the term time fire. I don\u2019t know what that means.",
        "A: Oh. Oh, time fire is when artillery fires a shell and the shell will hover, essentially,\nover an area and -- and discharge. In other words, it doesn\u2019t hit into the ground, it hits\nup above the ground and it\u2019s timed so that it\u2019ll go off before it hits the ground and\nthat\u2019s why they call it time fire. It\u2019s rather frightening because it covers a greater area\nof destruction than -- than the one that hits the ground.",
        "Q: Did you take any prisoners?",
        "A: Yes, we did. We -- well, we caught th-the numbers of them in -- in small pockets,\nmaybe five and 10 at a time. But the -- we were quite good with our prisoners\nbecause most of the ones that we took were old -- old -- old German army. They were\nnot the young SS troops. If it were the young SS troops, they would not survive, they\nwould have been killed.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Because they were the ones, they were the killers, and we all knew. And we -- I --\nwe could identify them. They had tattoos on them and usually what happened was\nsomebody would come along and say that we just got so many prisoners, but we\ncouldn\u2019t afford to have men take them back and -- and take care of them, because we\nneeded tha -- our own help and our own men with -- our units functions coordinately\nAugust 18, 2003\nthat you couldn\u2019t spare the men. And if they were SS men they would go back with\nthem and -- and if they tried to -- to break away to -- to escape, they shot them.",
        "Q: What did you know at the time about the difference between the general\nWehrmacht and the SS as you [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well the -- the old army, they -- they understood a lot better about what it was to\nbe a soldier. They were not the killer that we foresaw in the young people that we\nmet there. The SS troops were just unbelievable, just as bad as Hitler was\nunbelievable.",
        "Q: This judgment that you have of them, was this from firsthand experience or had\nyou been told about the difference in the s --",
        "A: No, fir -- it was firsthand as well as told. I mean, it was the -- it was handed down\nfrom soldier to soldier and from ev -- and we really di -- we spared the -- the old\nGerman army, the Wehrmacht, the old army, the Germans, th-they knew they were\ncaptured, they were a prisoner and that was it.",
        "Q: Did you have much contact with the civilians as you went through?",
        "A: Not very much cause we were always pretty active, but we did meet some -- some\nhere and there, particularly when we were moving through some area that had been\ncleaned out completely a | -- a lot earlier, like when we went to Paris, for instance,\nand we -- we were in Paris and we were -- actually we were -- stayed at Le Bourget\nAirdrome, th-the old name, and we had leave to go out into Paris, if you wanted to,\nAugust 18, 2003\nbut you -- you had to go in -- in pairs or threes or fours because there were German\nsnipers in -- living 1n houses and living with the French that were killing off our\nsoldiers when they were gone. So you couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t go unless you went in in\ntwos or threes or more. And so as a result you didn\u2019t get to see much of Paris\nbecause nobody wanted to go out into something like that.",
        "Q: Can you give me an idea of the route that you took from D-Day plus two to Saint-\nLo and then take me through some of the progression that --",
        "A: Wow.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, Paris is a -- the -- we started in Paris. Then we had the Argentan Falaise\ngap. We had th-the Battle of the Bulge. And then we -- that was at Malmedy. And\nthen from there we went up and -- and crossed the Rhine and of course I remember\ncrossing the Rhine very well because we captured the -- the Piper Heidsieck\nchampagne factory and put guards on it so that other units couldn\u2019t come and -- and\nget the wine and the spirits. That -- that was -- that\u2019s quite something. That was quite\nsomething to see. They left it intact, they did not destroy it, because they could have.\nWhy they did, I don\u2019t know. They even left the caretakers there with them. They had\nwines and -- and -- and cognacs and so forth that were aging in -- in these\nsubterranean tunnels. Casks as big as a house, you know, th-the -- unfortunately\nsometimes our soldiers would go down there and -- and get a bottle and then forget to\nAugust 18, 2003\nturn the tap off, you know, and the -- course the caretaker would blow his mind. He\ndoesn\u2019t mind if you\u2019re going to drink the stuff, but for God\u2019s sake don\u2019t let it run on\nthe ground. So that\u2019s why we se -- we sent guards there and we\u2019d have our trucks go\nback every week or so and -- and come back with a -- a couple of loads of -- of\nchampagne and wines and so forth. And then it was distributed to everybody else.\nBut up until that time [indecipherable]. And then we crossed the Rhine at Rebagen\nand from there on we moved into Belgium and I remember being in Liege very well.\nAnd I remember that -- hiding in the sewers of Liege during the Battle of the -- of the\nBulge, and so forth. And during Christmas of 1940 -- \u201945. Couldn\u2019t have been, 44.\nChristmas of 1944.",
        "Q: While you were in England and also when you crossed the channel, did you hear\nany of the Nazi propaganda?",
        "A: Yes, Axis Sally was very, very -- she was -- she was something. In fact\n[indecipherable] we liked to tune into her because we all knew what a doggone\nhorrible person she actually was. She survived, I understand, the whole -- the whole\nbit, and anyway died as an old lady, from what I understand, in prison somewhere.\nBut anyway, yes, there was quite a bit of German propaganda, and they used to drop\nleaflets on us, and even out in the field the -- they would drop, you know, your --\nyour girlfriend is now doing around with somebody else, you\u2019d better go home.\nThings like that. The -- the why are you here because you\u2019re not doing any good.\nAugust 18, 2003\nYou\u2019re just killing people, you know.

Actually, we got most of that from our \u201cStars and Stripes\u201d if we\nwere ever able to get one and see th -- we knew what was happening and -- and what\nthey were doing and that\u2019s how I knew about Kristallnacht and that -- when they --\nthey burned th-the -- they burned all the books and all that. That\u2019s -- you know, all\nthat was earlier but this is what all recapitulated and told to us a number of times, was\nin our -- our \u201cStars and Stripes\u201d. And we of course heard it from our own\ncommanders and everybody else that were there who were well informed on what\nwas going on, pretty much.

        "A: Well, we knew that there were camps. We did not know what was happening\ninside the camps, because even the people around those camps, and I can tell you that\nAugust 18, 2003\nnow because I talked to many of them, claimed they did not know, but that\u2019s not true.\nI think they all knew. I think all the Germans knew what was going on. They were\nbringing in -- oh, excuse me -- they were bringing in people into these camps at a\ncertain number and the camps could only hold a certain amount, and they had to go\nahead and get rid of that amounts that\u2019s going to be displaced. So even if they\nweren\u2019t close to dying, they would go ahead and kill them in order to make room for\nthe new groups that are coming up.",

        "A: Well, we -- actually were going in -- into Germany itself at this particular point\nand we were approaching a -- Weimar and -- and that particular area. And the third\narmy had come in to the fight for about several weeks or almost a month or so before,\nand they were pushing out farther even ahead of us. And we were moving quite\nrapidly, at a -- as a matter of fact. And we were just taking the towns as they came,\nand as we came to Weimar, that\u2019s where we came close to Buchenwald and\nBuchenwald was very close to the -- to this large city and we were told that when we\nwere on bivouac there that there was a camp here, and that it -- it was a camp of -- of\npolitical as well as Jewish prisoners. And we said -- not we said, they said they would\ntake us through the camp. And there was a select number of us that went through and\nI had a camera and took some of the pictures that we have here. And I -- I have to tell\nyou this, that there was probably one of the worst things that I\u2019ve seen in my whole\nlifetime. And I became a surgeon after all this, and I\u2019ve seen some pretty awful\nthings in the operating room, and everything tha -- injuries from cars and\n[indecipherable] but it was nothing like this. This -- this was a -- a horrible situation\nAugust 18, 2003\nthat should never have been allowed to occur. And as I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, I -- the\npeople claimed that they didn\u2019t know what was going on, but you could smell the\ncamp from miles away, because they had crematoriums and they would incinerate\nsome of the people that they had, once they died, and some of them that hadn\u2019t even\ndied yet, for that matter. I understand that they were functioning at full blast when the\ncamp was captured, and that they were trying to clear their -- their rooms in the\ncrematorium, and there were some of -- of them that were still alive, and they were\njust pushing them into the -- into the furnaces while they were still alive. So we knew\na little bit about what was going on there. Then when we walked in to see it, to see\nthat there was a -- a basement underneath the crematorium in which they had big\nhooks, like sky hooks on the wall, and they had bodies that were hung on these sky\nhooks and they would hang them there until they either died or what happened to\nthem, and then put them on an elevator and send them up to the crematorium, and\nthere dispose of them by burning them. And the stench, as I said, was -- why these\npeople didn\u2019t know something was happening there was beyond me. But they had\nquotas that they a-apparently had that said that they had to have at least 80 people die\nper day because they had to replace them with 80 new ones that were coming in. At\nleast that\u2019s the smallest number [indecipherable] there would be more than 80 that\ndied during the day. How some of these people survived as long as they did, we\ncould not understand. When we came in, there were some of them that were still\nAugust 18, 2003\nwalking around, but we were warned not to try to feed them or try to do anything.\nThey were under medical con -- surveillance and so forth. But it was just atrocious\nand that\u2019s wa -- that\u2019s how I got these pictures that I -- that I ha -- that I took. Th-This\nwas still there cause it was still fresh. This hadn\u2019t been -- hadn\u2019t been cleaned up or\nmoved or anything, and that\u2019s why they wanted us to see it.",
        "Q: What was the passage of time between when the camp was first entered by the\nAmerican soldiers and you got to go in?",
        "A: Oh, I think there was -- it must have been a week or so -- oh, perhaps -- it might\nhave been two or three days, or a week. I really don\u2019t know, because th-there was\ntalk about it earlier and we -- and -- and one of the visits was scrubbed and I do -- I\ndon\u2019t know what the reason was, but then we eventually did go. So it had to be -- it\nhad to be s-several days, but these bodies, they wouldn\u2019t let them just sit there all the\ntime, so it had to be pretty fast. It had to be.",
        "Q: Why did they tell you not to feed the prisoners that were walking around?",
        "A: Oh, because if they got food, their stomachs were contracted to an extent that food\nwould kill them. And so the -- and -- and they, of course, didn\u2019t know, and so th --\nbut the soldiers, who -- we were very good about that. Everybody wanted to help\nthem, to give them something, candy bars, anything that we had, but that -- that\nwasn\u2019t doing them any good. So that was the fear.\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "Q: Id like you to -- to walk with me through the camp. For -- a-approach the camp\nwith me as in your -- no -- as you remember approaching the camp, and take me\nthrough the entire experience. First, what did you see as you approached and what\ndid you hear, and you know. You told me that there was a stench, but what else?",
        "A: Oh, th-the stench, of course, was overpowering as you -- as you walked in, but\nthere was a large gate as we walked into that, and there was a compound where there\nwere posts that were stuck in the ground, and I understand that those were whipping\nposts, and a [indecipherable] somebody was chastised and whipped and -- and so\nforth on these posts and tied to them, and left there sometimes overnight and\notherwise. And then there were a series of barracks that were -- were approximately\n15 or 20 feet apart and they were maybe 150 - 200 feet long, and maybe 25 or 30 feet\nwide. And there was an aisle in the middle of each barrack and as -- as we entered on\nthe first barrack that we entered, there were still people in th-their area, these were\nsome that had survived, obviously. And they were in their niche, as they were -- as --\nas they called them, this is my spot. Surprisingly enough, we also saw some that --\nsome women that were kept as prostitutes for the camp people. And they were, of\ncourse, favored by the Germans because they wanted them to still continue to\nfunction. But anybody in the camp that had anything to do with them was\nimmediately ostracized amongst the people, from the way I understand from -- I\ntalked to several of them for that matter, I talked to some of them that spoke\nAugust 18, 2003\nRomanian and -- and they were Romanian Jews, and not political prisoners and they\nop -- from what they told me, you know, these people that were ostracized that way\nwere shunned completely and actually, eventually they would die out. Th-The\nGermans would -- would have them killed or -- or something would happen to them,\nor something would happen to them amongst them, for that matter.",
        "Q: When you spoke to some of the prisoners, can you remember exactly what they\nsaid to you?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t believe that they were re -- that they were free, that they could\npossibly be free. That this couldn\u2019t possibly be happening to them. Their -- that\nfreedom was the next step that they were going to see. They all anticipated dying.",
        "Q: And the women that you said that were the prostitutes at the camp, do you know\nwhat their ethnic background -- were they Jewish?",
        "A: N-No, they were just all -- I -- no, they were not only Jewish, no. They were all --\nall ethnic groups. I\u2019m sure there were Greeks and Italians and --",
        "Q: What else did you see inside the camp besides the prisoners? Did you see\nanything of the way the guards that were --",
        "A: Well, we went to the crematorium and as -- I saw that, th-the ovens. There were\nS1X Or -- SIX Or Seven Ovens in there that I can remember. And they were just like\nwhat you see, you know, in -- on television today when you see the mortuaries, with -\n- with the slots that go in it, the fire underneath it and the -- and th-they were -- there\nAugust 18, 2003\nwere still bodies that -- they turned off the fire, but there were still some bodies that\nwere still there, that we were able to see. So the -- and we saw d-downstairs where\nthey -- the hooks were. They -- they said that they reserved this for -- for fliers, for --\nfor our air force people. Why that would be as -- I don\u2019t understand, but interrogation\nor something like that, I don\u2019t have any idea why they would want to interrogate once\nthey got to this particular camp is beyond me. I should think that by the time they got\nthere, they were pretty well interrogated.",
        "Q: Had their been any Americans liberated from that camp, to your knowledge?",
        "A: Oh, there were some, but I didn\u2019t see any.",
        "Q: Did you see any part of the camp where the Germans had lived, or the guards had\nworked or anything?",
        "A: Yes. I\u2019m glad you mentioned that because I almost forgot about it completely. The\ncommandants wife had quarters there, and I believe they called her the bitch of\nBuchenwald. And she had lamps in her -- ooh, that still runs up and down my spine\nnow just to say, lamps made of the skin of the prisoners. Lampshades, that is. And\nshe had lamps that had bones that was the supporting [indecipherable]. And\nfurniture and furnishings apparently that was woven and -- and -- out of skins.",
        "Q: What kinds of skins? What skins did she --",
        "A: Skins of the -- of the actual camp inmates, the human skin. Yes, dermal, this type\nof skin.\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "Q: When she would select a skin, for whatever purpose, was there -- could you tell if\nthere was any reason why she selected this particular skin?",
        "A: I was given to understand that she was quite particular about what type of skin she\nwas going to use, whether it was clear or whether it had blemishes on it, or what. But\nI don\u2019t know anything else, other than that.",
        "Q: Did you see any skins with tattoos?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. They tattooed their own, too. The SS men were tattooed. They had a\ntattoo over their arm as you -- you know, that\u2019s the way we identified them many\ntimes.",
        "Q: Besides her quarters or her office, whatever area of -- of her --",
        "A: I saw her living room, that\u2019s the only one tha-that we were escorted through. I\ndidn\u2019t see any other part of -- she had an office, I understand there, and everything.\nShe -- she pretty much almost ran the camp, from what I understood, rather than her\nhusband, if -- if she had a husband.",
        "Q: Is there anything else about the camp that comes to your mind right now?",
        "A: Nothing other than the fact that it was a relief to leave it. And then -- and then\nupon leaving it, you got a feeling of -- of real loss, of -- you know, when we went in\nthere, you go -- you went through Weimar and the -- the German people were there\nlaughing and scratching and having fun and en-enjoying themselves. And then when\nwe came back out again, they were still there, but it didn\u2019t mean anything. And it felt\nAugust 18, 2003\nto us that they were not sincere, that they had to know what was going on wi -- up\nuntil then there was a doubt, but we knew that they knew. There was no question\nabout it. We didn\u2019t feel there was.",
        "Q: How long did you spend in the camp?",
        "A: Oh, Is -- guess we were there a couple of hours.",
        "Q: After your visit to the camp, did you have any conversations with any of the\ncivilians in the town?",
        "A: No. No, we went back to our units.",
        "Q: Where did you go next, after Buchenwald?",
        "A: I can\u2019t recall actually what our next thi -- but -- but we ended up in Liege, and\nthen through Liege into Germany itself, but we were close to what we call Cologne,\nand that was just about pretty close to where the war was gonna end.",
        "Q: Do you remember the date that you walked into Buchenwald?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: I also just wanted to ask you about the time of day that 1t was when you went into\nBuchenwald. Was it the morning or the afternoon?",
        "A: It was morning, mid-morning, sunshine-y day.",
        "Q: Did you see any children in the camp?\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: Yes, little ones? Yes, they were in there, their bodies were piled up there just like\neverybody else\u2019s. And the only way we knew they were children was their -- their\nSIZe.",
        "Q: You said you spoke to a couple of the prisoners there in Romanian.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did any of the prisoners, either the ones that spoke to you or the ones that you just\nobserved, did any of them stand out in your mind?",
        "A: Not really.",
        "Q: Were you aware of any acts of revenge or retaliation against the guards in this\ncamp? Had you heard of anything?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And when you got there, had there been any burial of bodies yet?",
        "A: No. Na -- that\u2019s why I got the pictures of -- they had none of that.",
        "Q: And do you know if any of the civilians were brought into the camp to see it?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry, what?",
        "Q: Were you aware if any of the civilians had been brought into the camp to see it?",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Who went with you into the camp?\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "Q: There was about nine of us altogether and it was -- mostly we were the -- the part\nof the 17\" Observation Battalion that was the headquarters [indecipherable] and we\nwere the officers. The officers and ourselves. I was a sergeant and our master\nsergeant, myself and two lieutenants and a major were a-all together.",
        "Q: How did the other people that were with you react?",
        "A: Well, we all got back home and we still -- we had to have -- we all sat and talked\nabout it and then some of them actually got drunk, but I was a teetotaler ab -- by\nabout that time. And there was a -- it was pretty sad. They just -- they can see -- they\nfelt that th-this was the reason we were fighting, that we were there to stop this and\nwe all felt very strongly at this particular --",
        "Q: When you got back to your comrades, did you tell them what you had seen?",
        "A: Absolutely, yes. And they believed us. Not everybody had the opportunity to see\nit, but they did, they -- they believed us.",
        "Q: And by the time you had visited the camp you had already read about --",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- the things in -- in \u201cStars and Stripes\u201d? Okay. In correspondence with your\nfamily and friends at home, did you tell them about what you had seen?",
        "A: Yes. I wrote and -- and I had saved them, many of them, but when we moved\nsomehow they got lost. I don\u2019t know what happened. My mother had saved all my\nletters and everything, and all my correspondence. She gave everything else away\nAugust 18, 2003\nthat I had, all my memorab -- she -- she gave it all to the Salvation Army. But no, I --\nI -- I can\u2019t say that there was any special thing.",
        "Q: Tell me a minute -- for a minute, about the photos that you have and -- and how\nyou came to be in possession of these photos.",
        "A: Well, these were photos that I took with my camera and at the time it was a small,\nlittle camera and there are photos of bodies that have been stacked outside the\nbarracks itself, and you can see the emaciated legs and arms and so forth, of the\npeople and several show the ashes after the crematorium, the burnt ashes and there\nwas a -- as you can see, this was several days after because see, they have two little\nwreaths over here. Had to be -- but they left them there for us to see cause I guess\nnobody would believe them.",
        "Q: In the picture you have here of the ashes, what else is in the picture besides ashes?",
        "A: Well there\u2019s a rake that shows the -- the -- they\u2019re trying to keep them together in\na pile.",
        "Q: And in this photo the ashes are dark, what are these white things?",
        "A: That\u2019s bones. Residual bones.",
        "Q: So we --",
        "A: You can have these, if you like. A-And just promise to get them back to me.",
        "Q: Is there anything else about your -- your visit to the camp that you wanted to add\nbefore we move on?\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe so, I think that covers.",
        "Q: What did you do during the next couple of days or weeks or whatever, before --\nyou know, after that, until the end of the war.",
        "A: Actually, they took our unit out because we were relieved by the 285\" and we\nwere sent to Czechoslovakia, and we ended up on a -- a beautiful resort in Kadyne,\nK-a-d-y-n-e. And this was supposed to be [indecipherable] of rest and relaxation,\nbut 1-1n anticipation of the end of the war, and indeed we really had it very nice there.\nAnd the war did end, V-E day, it\u2019s -- the European war only. And of course we, the\nunit we\u2019ve been such old tried and true soldiers who\u2019d been there so long, we didn\u2019t\nhave to worry about being sent to the South Pacific. But that 285\" that I mentioned\nearlier, they were the youngsters and they were -- mobilized them and they were on\ntheir way immediately. And I wanted to -- I had enough points, because you got\npoints for the number of months that you were there, to be discharged, and I said\nfine, I want to go home. And they said, well it\u2019ll take quite a bit of time because\nthere\u2019s -- it\u2019s going to take preference to get these troops moved into the South\nPacific, so we need all that transportation. I said, well, I\u2019ve missed so much school,\nI'd like to apply to go to school here. I had heard about an American school in\nBiarritz, France, and they says, okay. And I applied and within 24 hours I was on a\ntrain on the way to Biarritz. And as I was on the way to Biarritz, we were -- we had\nstopped in -- in Nancy, France, Nantaise as they call it and the newspapermen were\nAugust 18, 2003\nhowling and yowling that we dropped an atom bomb on the Japanese. That was\nNagasaki, or -- or Hiroshima, which one of them was first. And that this was\nanticipation of the end of the war. And on -- on the next station that we stopped at,\nthey said that probably the war would end. And then I understand we dropped\nanother bomb subsequently and then the war did end. But in the meantime I went to\nBiarritz, and this is on the Bay of Biscay, on the Atlantic, it\u2019s a big, beautiful resort\nthat the Germans used for their officers. So we went into a city -- I w-went into a city\nthat was pro-German. They didn\u2019t want us in there at all, cause they had it nice. The\nGerman officers treated them well, and you know, gave them food and you know,\nthey -- they -- they lived very well. So th-th -- it took us a long time, that is months to\ngo ahead and -- and si -- and make inroads into the fact that we were the ones that\nfreed them, and that freedom was a heck of a lot better than just being subservient to\nGermans. But I just continued my college courses there, and -- and I got full credit\nfor them, and on the second or third -- second of December, 1945, my semester had\nended and they said, y -- okay, you can go home now. And I got on a ship and in five\ndays I was back here and on December 7\", 1945, I was discharged from the service.\nPearl Harbor day.",
        "Q: What courses did you take when you were studying?",
        "A: Oh, I took Abnormal Psychology, which was very, very great, because the French\nhad th -- all these abnormal people, they were allowed to have their own enclaves and\nAugust 18, 2003\neverything. So I -- I had a -- a -- a field tha -- to work in easily. Homosexuality was a\n-- an-not very well known at that time, at least in this country it wasn't, or if 1t was it\nwas behind bars somewhere. But there they were -- they -- they lived an open life.\nAnd we studied 1 -- Abnormal Psych. I took, surprisingly, enough German. I needed a\nlanguage, so I took German and I had English and one other subject, chemistry.",
        "Q: During your time in the service, did you meet anybody famous or infamous?",
        "A: In the service itself, no, but I met him after the service. And I can\u2019t think of his\nname, it\u2019s the -- the German that defected here that worked on the atom bomb. He\nlived not too far away from us in -- I can\u2019t think of his name and I know it just as\nwell as I know my own.",
        "Q: Well, maybe it\u2019Il come to you later.",
        "A: Maybe so. He\u2019s the one who worked on the atom bomb. D1-Did all -- di-did -- and\nhad -- had worked on the V2 and V -- V1 initially there, and came here and -- oh gee.",
        "Q: Maybe it\u2019ll come to you.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: We can get back to that. When you were discharged, what was your rank?",
        "A: I was a sergeant.",
        "Q: And did you have any military honors?",
        "A: Well, I had five bronze stars and a Medal of Honor and all those others, and I was\ninjured once, but a whole bunch of us were injured when one of those V2 hit -- hit\nAugust 18, 2003\nour unit, but it didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t walk down to get our Purple Heart, so we didn\u2019t --\nthere was no in -- no Serious injury.",
        "Q: When you came back, what did you tell people about your experiences overseas?",
        "A: Well, I think ma -- th-the -- the most outstanding thing that they wanted to know\nabout was -- was the -- the camp. And then that, of course, was something that was\ningrained. That\u2019s why I remember as much as I\u2019ve do -- have al -- although I\u2019ve tried\nto put it out of my mind. It was -- they wanted to know if it was real or not. There --\nth-there are some people that say tha-that it was all a put-up job. Tha-That 1s, of\ncourse is not -- not true. And this is only one camp. I mean, there were Polish camps\nand there were -- they were all over.",
        "Q: Was it difficult for you to return to civilian life at all?",
        "A: Not at all, because I was home, as I said, December seventh and one week after\nthat I was back at college, where the dean had said when I left that there will be a\nplace for me no matter when I got back. And I called him, he was still there, and he\nsays, come on back, John. And I went back and s -- went back into pre-med, you\nknow, a pre-medical course and continued. Went through summer, trying to catch up\nto the years that I\u2019d lost, and caught it all up and graduated 1940 -- \u201948, actually\nwhen I went to medical school in 1947, because my grades were so good that they\nwil -- they were going to give me credit for a year of medical school towards\ngraduation, so that I could b -- be in medical school for a year and graduate the\nAugust 18, 2003\nfollowing year. So I got my degrees the following year, I\u2019d already had one year of\nmedical school at the time. So it was kind of nice. Actually, I had almost caught up to\nmyself. So then four years of medical school, graduated 1951 and was an intern at\nWestern Pennsylvania Hospital in Pittsburgh. I went to Pitt, and subsequent to that,\nwhile I was at Pitt and I had the -- been an intern and an extern as well. My grades\nwere good and when you were a good student you could live outside, and I lived in\nthe hospital. And the-they challenged me quite a bit as to what I was going to be and\nI was going to be a surgeon. And they said, well, wen -- we\u2019re going to send you to\nschool. So here comes school again and I says, fine. And they sent me to University\nof Pennsylvania, the graduate school of surgery. And I spent a year there doing\nnothing but surgery. And while there is when I met the great Bailey, the heart\nsurgeon and -- and I was challenged there by being an assistant --",
        "Q: I-I\u2019m running out of tape.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Just one moment.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with\nJohn Bucur. This is tape two, side B. And you had been telling me about your\nmedical training and you were up to being in --\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: They sent me to the University of Pennsylvania and while there I spent a year\ndoing nothing but graduate surgery, and surgeons from all over the world who were\ngathered there and I was the baby, by the way, I was the youngest one in the class.\nAnd while there is when Bailey did his first heart surgery, at Harmon Hospital there.\nAnd we as students there were allowed to go out and ob-observe all the types of\nsurgeries that were done within the university\u2019s per view, and at the University of\nPennsylvania, Dr. Grof, G-r-o-f was the neurosurgeon there and he asked if I would\nhelp him on one of his craniotomies, operating on the head. I said, I\u2019ll be glad to,\nbecause I had a lot of experience in surgery from where I had come from. And I did.\nAnd I was so taken by him while we were operating that he challenged me to the\npoint whereby he said, I will get you a residency, if not right here, I know where y --\nI want you to go. And I said, are you -- he said, you\u2019d make a great neurosurgeon. I\nsaid, well I -- I just wanted to be a surgeon at that time and he se -- I says, but that\nmeans another five or six years. And up until that particular point, you know, I\n[indecipherable] I wondered whether that was a wise decision to make, but I\u2019m -- I\ndil -- I was delighted with what we were doing, so I said yes. Anyway, then he was\none of my champions as far as referral was concerned and I applied to several places\nthat he had w-wanted me to go, and ended up under Jack French in Long Beach,\nCalifornia, the V.A. hospital, and spent five years there. And in that fifth year I was\nchief of neurosurgery at the hospital because Jack French got married, and he wa --\nAugust 18, 2003\nmarried the diva Dorothy Kirsten. In -- in her day -- she\u2019s the one that was thrown\nout of Russia, by the way, because of her attitude. They said -- of her American\nattitude, that is. Persona non grata, they called her. This was back in Stalin\u2019s days.\nAnyway, the thing about it was that he -- and he wanted to take a year off as a\nsabbatical and he says, you\u2019re going to be chief. And I went from, I think it was\n9,000 dollars a year to 30,000 dollars a year as chief. Wow, talk about living it up. I\nstill remember that very well. I was married at that time and we had our first child\nthere in -- in Long Beach. And things were pretty tough on 9,000 dollar a year and\nwe lived just a -- where Disneyland was built. And the kids in my youngster\u2019s age\ngroup were asked to come to try out Disneyland before they even opened it. And so\nhe got to know pretty well what the rides were going to be and everything else. But\nwe didn\u2019t stay there, I wanted to come back east again. The California type of life\nwas not my type of life. [indecipherable] as I always say, the -- there was always\nsomebody running around with somebody else\u2019s wife. And it was just different. A\nbar on every corner, school three sessions a day. Some of them were four hours\napiece and they\u2019d have the three sessions, three different groups. Th-They were\ncrowded. So anyhow, I-I wanted to come back here, and I came. When I finished I\ncame back here. And the reason I did come to this particular area is because before I\nwent overseas I was stationed at Fort Mead. And when I had got leave while I was\nstationed at Fort Mead, I came into this area and came into Arlington, and I loved\nAugust 18, 2003\nArlington. Arlington was just gorgeous. Still is, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t was just\ngorgeous. I said, one of these days I\u2019m going to live there. And that\u2019s what I did, I\ncame here. There was one other neurosurgeon here and we went into partnership\ntogether and everybody in the District of Columbia kept saying, what are you --\nwhat are you going over there, that\u2019s on the other side of the river. Nothing is every\ngoing to happen there. So the thing that happened 1s we built all these hospitals and I\nwas the founder of Fairfax Hospital, the founder of Northern Virginia Doctor\u2019s\nHospital. The founder of National Orthopedic Hospital. So we built our own\nhospitals and we -- w -- and it -- 1t -- 1t was quite nice and had a nice practice, and I\npractice in what -- what I refer to as the golden age of medicine, where there was no\nMedicare or Medicaid and not everybody was entitled to everything under God\u2019s\ncreation. They got treated free in most of my practice. Back early on, 40 percent of it\nwas gratis, it -- it was free patients, so -- but I made my first dollar when I was about\n36 years old. And everybody says, boy, it takes a long time to be a neurosurgeon. It\ndoes. And I think it\u2019s going to be even longer, they\u2019re going to make it longer.",

And all -- all of\nthem are out of school, graduated, they\u2019re all in their 40\u2019s. They\u2019re attorneys, no\ndoctors. Lot of attorneys. One\u2019s a judge. So we\u2019re -- we\u2019re doing very well.\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "Q: What did you tell them about your experiences during the war?",
        "A: Oh my, as -- as they were growing up, they -- they know most of these stories,\ncause they would ask me, and I -- I -- I -- we would sit sometimes after dinner and\njust -- just talk about things in general, and th-th -- these subjects would come up.\nAnd they\u2019d ask -- they ask particularly about the atrocities and the camps and so\nforth, knowing -- and they know, of course that I have th -- had these pictures and\nthey all saw these, so they knew that this -- this was something that did really happen.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: In what ways do you think that this experience has changed you in your life?",
        "A: I can\u2019t say maturity because once you got into the service you became mature no\nmatter whether you wanted to or not. I wasn\u2019t -- when I came back from the service -\n- | -- I went into the service as a young college boy that probably had a beanie on his\nhead. I came back from the service as a mature man that never belonged to a -- a\nfraternity or anything like that, because that was a lot of bunk, as we felt coming\nback. So we set up our own organizations. But I think that my entire wartime\nexperience gave me a sense of understanding of what man can do to man. What --\nwhat had happened in Germany should never happen again, and I understand that\nit\u2019s been happening in some of these other countries, in Africa and otherwise. And\nthat just recently Idi Amin just died and he was one of these Hitlers. He was -- and\nAugust 18, 2003\nhe was responsible for millions of deaths as well, and he -- he doesn\u2019t have the\nnotoriety that Hitler had obviously, but I think he -- the -- the people\n[indecipherable] know that he\u2019s done this.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you\u2019d like to add before we conclude? Is there anything\nthat we haven\u2019t discussed that you want to talk about?",
        "A: No, but it\u2019s just been wonderful to have you ask me the questions, because it woke\nup memories that I\u2019m going to be talking about for the next couple of weeks, I think,\na-again. And I want the children to know and remember some of those things and I\nthink that\u2019s a good thing. And so I want to thank you for asking.",

        "A: \u2019'm of Romanian ancestry and consequently both my parents had emigrated from\nRomania and as a result spoke Romanian in th -- in the house and when I went to\nschool, the elementary school, I used to answer the teacher sometimes in Romanian\nwhen I didn\u2019t know how to speak it in English. But nevertheless, mostly Romanian as\na youngster, and then -- excuse me -- as I grew up it just completely changed to\nEnglish and didn\u2019t use it again.",
        "A: Well, Youngstown at that time was a very thriving me-metropolis because it was\non the theater circuit. My father was a very avid theater-goer, so I recall going to the\nHippodrome and the Palace theaters and seeing the old magician shows with\nThurston and Blackstone and those, and seeing Al Jolson u-up on the stage in\nperson while in my father\u2019s lap, and then later on as his a-accompanying\n[indecipherable].",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- of course I remember going to high school, perhaps more so than\nanything else. I was a pretty good student actually, I was val-valedictorian of my\nclass. And it was during the early wartime, in -- in 1943 when I graduated, and --",
        "A: Okay.\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: Certainly in the area that I grew up in because it was a -- what we call a mixed\narea. There were Jews, there were French, there were Italians, and -- in fact, it was\nalmost a -- a conglomeration of just every -- every language there was spoken. And\nas a result, actually when I was younger, I spoke some of the other languages, too. I\nlearned how to speak a little Hungarian and a little bit of Italian, which makes it\neasier because Romanian and Italian are pretty much aligned. And under those\ncircumstances even as a youngster, we went to each other\u2019s homes and so forth and\nheard it spoken because that\u2019s what most people spoke at that time. And, oh, we were\nat that time, foreigners. My father had ra -- come here, as I said, working in the steel\nmills and when the war broke out and -- first World War, he volunteered to go and he\nwas in the American expeditionary force, and when the war was over he\nautomatically became a citizen. And he was still a young man, he was only in his\n20\u2019s and decided to go back to Romania and find somebody to marry. And he met\nmy mother and they had a -- a courtship that lasted a short period of time, and he got\nmarried there in Romania and came here, and brought her with him. And s -- at the\ntime that she came to this country, she was pregnant and I was born -- she got here in\nFebruary and I was born in March, in 1925.

        "A: We had a ver -- marvelously -- that\u2019s -- we had friends that were Romanian Jews\nthat spoke Romanian and actually they didn\u2019t call themselves Jewish. I don\u2019t think\nthere was any distinction back in those days a-about being a Hebrew or a Jew or\nwhatever it was. And you were Greek or you were Italian, that\u2019s fine. And we all\nplayed together and we all commiserated with each other when things went wrong,\nand it was -- the relationship was exceptional, I think.",

        "A: No, I\u2019m an only child.",
        "A: Oh, I have some nice, fond thoughts of my elementary school because in the\nfourth grade I had the teacher named McLaughlin who was very fond of me and I\nwas a good student and she challenged me in more ways than one, in the work that I\nwas doing because I got special work over and above what she taught the general\nclass, because it was such a mixed group. And it was at that time that my mother and\nI went to visit Europe and this teacher encouraged it, even though I was going to be\nAugust 18, 2003\nabsent for a period of time, and encouraged it very strongly and wa -- I wrote to her\nand we communicated during the time I was gone. As a result though, I was gone\nabout a year and a half and went to school there, 1-in Romania, so going back to the -\n- my parent\u2019s homes. And -- but decided at that time -- the decision, that is, was left\nto me by my parents as to whether I wanted to stay there or whether I wanted to come\nback here and I chose to come back here, wanting to be back in -- in America, and\nfrom then on it was just here.",

I always leaned toward\nbeing a doctor, and my father said, if that\u2019s what you want to be, that\u2019s fine, go\nahead, let\u2019s -- but you\u2019ve got to excel in school and -- and this was the time. And of\ncourse the depression held things back considerably during that time.

And my father said, well, we will get you the typewriter, but you got to\nteach yourself how to type. And I says okay. So he bought a typewriter for me and I\ngot the books with it and taught myself how to type. And then went to take it in\nschool, in high school and the teacher said, after I sat down there, she said, you\nalready know how. I\u2019ll give you credit for the class. In the meantime, go do\nsomething else. So I was -- that was something that really stood me in good stead. I\nrecall that specifically because of -- of how it came about. And most of the things\nthat I -- that I wanted as a youngster, being an only child, I got on the basis that I\ncould earn them and -- and use them.

War 1s a little different than the\nbooks tell you all the time. So we trained there and then from there we moved on a\nnumber of occasions, as if we were going to go on invasion, but we didn\u2019t. And then\nthey moved the whole unit to Bournemouth, which is a resort on the channel, a\nbeautiful place. And about every other day we would go out as if we were going to\ninvade and we didn\u2019t, and months went by and -- until June sixth, and June sixth the\ninvasion occurred and we were still on the ship.

        "A: Well, we, actually we got stymied at Saint-Lo. We had gone inland that far and\nthe action that we saw was getting our units in t -- into function. Now, an observation\nbattalion is a flash and sound unit. And by flash meaning that there are outposts that\nare put out into no man\u2019s land and you can have two of those outposts, generally and\nthey look at the enemy territory and they see the flash of a gun, and they have an\n[indecipherable] to take they can adjust on their instrument where that flash\noccurred and then they triangulate on the flash and they send it back to a central point\nbehind, and then that\u2019s pinpointed and those coordinates then are s-sent to our\nartillery and our artillery fires on them. That\u2019s flash. Now, the s -- the sound unit is a\nlittle more complicated is because they -- we sunk microphones down a -- a distance\nof about a foot and a half or two, in a semi-circular fashion in no man\u2019s land so that\nthe sound that traveled from the gun that fired there in the enemy territory would hit\nmicrophone number one, before it hit number two or three, and in succession you\nwould draw a line to the microphone that was hit and then pinpoint where it came\nfrom, within about a foot and a half, actually. So we\u2019d call those coordinates and of\ncourse the artillery loved us. They said, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re our boys because they\u2019re\nthe ones that tell us where to fire. We can\u2019t see a thing, yet -- un-un-until we have a\nAugust 18, 2003\ncoordinate that\u2019s set on. And th-those microphone, sound travels 1100 feet per\nsecond.

But we were stymied at Saint-Lo for a long period of time, and nevertheless,\nas he traveled with his driver the Germans came up and they shot him.

        "A: Oh, one -- once we were able to move, we moved rather rapidly. In fact,\nsometimes they moved so rapidly we didn't have a chance to set up and the -- our\nartillery would argue with them, hey, wait a minute, once you set up, what are we\ngoing to fire at, you know, until we get somebody out there. And we were the only\nunit in -- in -- in the V-corps, th-that area, so as a result it was a little difficult for\nthem to really have a target, otherwise they\u2019d have to just time fire everything.\nNevertheless, the thing about it was that our -- our -- our feeling was that they were\nAugust 18, 2003\nmoving too rapidly. But we moved ver -- very, very rapidly and once we got up to\nthe Argentan Falaise area, that -- that -- that was the -- that -- they called that the\nArgentan Falaise gap in which we encircled about six or seven companies of\nGermans completely. And un-under those -- while there, we were a -- stopped\nbecause we had -- had circled them and the continued to fight down to the last. So we\n-- we went back into functioning again.

And that\u2019s the one that had the massacre occur at\nMalmedy in Belgium.

And we had conferred with the eight -- 285\" when it came\nthere that they can\u2019t function the way they did at Fort Sill, that this 1s war, and that --\nthat it\u2019s a different thing. But they were young, with young officers and young --\nyoung companies and they just went the wrong way. Actually, what really happened\nwas that the leader, one of their lieutenants was going down the road, and there was -\n- the road signs were made out of wood in those days and they pointed the direction\nof where they -- you were going and -- and he said, now this 1s the route we\u2019re\nsupposed to take, instead of looking at his map and being sure. Well, the Germans\nhad turned the -- turned the sign around, and they went directly into the Germans.\nAnd they got caught by the SS troops and about a hundred and some -- 20 of them or\nAugust 18, 2003\nso, were massacred right on the spot. And several of them did survive that we finally\ngot to, but it was a pretty bad situation.",
        "A: Oh. Oh, time fire is when artillery fires a shell and the shell will hover, essentially,\nover an area and -- and discharge. In other words, it doesn\u2019t hit into the ground, it hits\nup above the ground and it\u2019s timed so that it\u2019ll go off before it hits the ground and\nthat\u2019s why they call it time fire. It\u2019s rather frightening because it covers a greater area\nof destruction than -- than the one that hits the ground.",
        "A: Yes, we did. We -- well, we caught th-the numbers of them in -- in small pockets,\nmaybe five and 10 at a time. But the -- we were quite good with our prisoners\nbecause most of the ones that we took were old -- old -- old German army. They were\nnot the young SS troops. If it were the young SS troops, they would not survive, they\nwould have been killed.",
        "A: Because they were the ones, they were the killers, and we all knew. And we -- I --\nwe could identify them. They had tattoos on them and usually what happened was\nsomebody would come along and say that we just got so many prisoners, but we\ncouldn\u2019t afford to have men take them back and -- and take care of them, because we\nneeded tha -- our own help and our own men with -- our units functions coordinately\nAugust 18, 2003\nthat you couldn\u2019t spare the men. And if they were SS men they would go back with\nthem and -- and if they tried to -- to break away to -- to escape, they shot them.",
        "A: Well the -- the old army, they -- they understood a lot better about what it was to\nbe a soldier. They were not the killer that we foresaw in the young people that we\nmet there. The SS troops were just unbelievable, just as bad as Hitler was\nunbelievable.",
        "A: No, fir -- it was firsthand as well as told. I mean, it was the -- it was handed down\nfrom soldier to soldier and from ev -- and we really di -- we spared the -- the old\nGerman army, the Wehrmacht, the old army, the Germans, th-they knew they were\ncaptured, they were a prisoner and that was it.",
        "A: Not very much cause we were always pretty active, but we did meet some -- some\nhere and there, particularly when we were moving through some area that had been\ncleaned out completely a | -- a lot earlier, like when we went to Paris, for instance,\nand we -- we were in Paris and we were -- actually we were -- stayed at Le Bourget\nAirdrome, th-the old name, and we had leave to go out into Paris, if you wanted to,\nAugust 18, 2003\nbut you -- you had to go in -- in pairs or threes or fours because there were German\nsnipers in -- living 1n houses and living with the French that were killing off our\nsoldiers when they were gone. So you couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t go unless you went in in\ntwos or threes or more. And so as a result you didn\u2019t get to see much of Paris\nbecause nobody wanted to go out into something like that.",
        "A: Wow.",
        "A: Well, Paris is a -- the -- we started in Paris. Then we had the Argentan Falaise\ngap. We had th-the Battle of the Bulge. And then we -- that was at Malmedy. And\nthen from there we went up and -- and crossed the Rhine and of course I remember\ncrossing the Rhine very well because we captured the -- the Piper Heidsieck\nchampagne factory and put guards on it so that other units couldn\u2019t come and -- and\nget the wine and the spirits. That -- that was -- that\u2019s quite something. That was quite\nsomething to see. They left it intact, they did not destroy it, because they could have.\nWhy they did, I don\u2019t know. They even left the caretakers there with them. They had\nwines and -- and -- and cognacs and so forth that were aging in -- in these\nsubterranean tunnels. Casks as big as a house, you know, th-the -- unfortunately\nsometimes our soldiers would go down there and -- and get a bottle and then forget to\nAugust 18, 2003\nturn the tap off, you know, and the -- course the caretaker would blow his mind. He\ndoesn\u2019t mind if you\u2019re going to drink the stuff, but for God\u2019s sake don\u2019t let it run on\nthe ground. So that\u2019s why we se -- we sent guards there and we\u2019d have our trucks go\nback every week or so and -- and come back with a -- a couple of loads of -- of\nchampagne and wines and so forth. And then it was distributed to everybody else.\nBut up until that time [indecipherable]. And then we crossed the Rhine at Rebagen\nand from there on we moved into Belgium and I remember being in Liege very well.\nAnd I remember that -- hiding in the sewers of Liege during the Battle of the -- of the\nBulge, and so forth. And during Christmas of 1940 -- \u201945. Couldn\u2019t have been, 44.\nChristmas of 1944.",
        "A: Yes, Axis Sally was very, very -- she was -- she was something. In fact\n[indecipherable] we liked to tune into her because we all knew what a doggone\nhorrible person she actually was. She survived, I understand, the whole -- the whole\nbit, and anyway died as an old lady, from what I understand, in prison somewhere.\nBut anyway, yes, there was quite a bit of German propaganda, and they used to drop\nleaflets on us, and even out in the field the -- they would drop, you know, your --\nyour girlfriend is now doing around with somebody else, you\u2019d better go home.\nThings like that. The -- the why are you here because you\u2019re not doing any good.\nAugust 18, 2003\nYou\u2019re just killing people, you know. But there was th -- there was a lot of Nazi\npropaganda from that standpoint. Everything, of course, you know, from their side of\nthe -- the pond.",
        "A: Quite a bit.

We did know that there were camps, and we were -- my\nunit actually was one of the first ones to go into Buchenwald, and --",
        "A: Well, we knew that there were camps. We did not know what was happening\ninside the camps, because even the people around those camps, and I can tell you that\nAugust 18, 2003\nnow because I talked to many of them, claimed they did not know, but that\u2019s not true.\nI think they all knew. I think all the Germans knew what was going on. They were\nbringing in -- oh, excuse me -- they were bringing in people into these camps at a\ncertain number and the camps could only hold a certain amount, and they had to go\nahead and get rid of that amounts that\u2019s going to be displaced. So even if they\nweren\u2019t close to dying, they would go ahead and kill them in order to make room for\nthe new groups that are coming up.",

        "A: Well, we -- actually were going in -- into Germany itself at this particular point\nand we were approaching a -- Weimar and -- and that particular area. And the third\narmy had come in to the fight for about several weeks or almost a month or so before,\nand they were pushing out farther even ahead of us. And we were moving quite\nrapidly, at a -- as a matter of fact. And we were just taking the towns as they came,\nand as we came to Weimar, that\u2019s where we came close to Buchenwald and\nBuchenwald was very close to the -- to this large city and we were told that when we\nwere on bivouac there that there was a camp here, and that it -- it was a camp of -- of\npolitical as well as Jewish prisoners. And we said -- not we said, they said they would\ntake us through the camp. And there was a select number of us that went through and\nI had a camera and took some of the pictures that we have here. And I -- I have to tell\nyou this, that there was probably one of the worst things that I\u2019ve seen in my whole\nlifetime. And I became a surgeon after all this, and I\u2019ve seen some pretty awful\nthings in the operating room, and everything tha -- injuries from cars and\n[indecipherable] but it was nothing like this. This -- this was a -- a horrible situation\nAugust 18, 2003\nthat should never have been allowed to occur. And as I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, I -- the\npeople claimed that they didn\u2019t know what was going on, but you could smell the\ncamp from miles away, because they had crematoriums and they would incinerate\nsome of the people that they had, once they died, and some of them that hadn\u2019t even\ndied yet, for that matter. I understand that they were functioning at full blast when the\ncamp was captured, and that they were trying to clear their -- their rooms in the\ncrematorium, and there were some of -- of them that were still alive, and they were\njust pushing them into the -- into the furnaces while they were still alive. So we knew\na little bit about what was going on there. Then when we walked in to see it, to see\nthat there was a -- a basement underneath the crematorium in which they had big\nhooks, like sky hooks on the wall, and they had bodies that were hung on these sky\nhooks and they would hang them there until they either died or what happened to\nthem, and then put them on an elevator and send them up to the crematorium, and\nthere dispose of them by burning them. And the stench, as I said, was -- why these\npeople didn\u2019t know something was happening there was beyond me. But they had\nquotas that they a-apparently had that said that they had to have at least 80 people die\nper day because they had to replace them with 80 new ones that were coming in. At\nleast that\u2019s the smallest number [indecipherable] there would be more than 80 that\ndied during the day. How some of these people survived as long as they did, we\ncould not understand. When we came in, there were some of them that were still\nAugust 18, 2003\nwalking around, but we were warned not to try to feed them or try to do anything.\nThey were under medical con -- surveillance and so forth. But it was just atrocious\nand that\u2019s wa -- that\u2019s how I got these pictures that I -- that I ha -- that I took. Th-This\nwas still there cause it was still fresh. This hadn\u2019t been -- hadn\u2019t been cleaned up or\nmoved or anything, and that\u2019s why they wanted us to see it.",
        "A: Oh, I think there was -- it must have been a week or so -- oh, perhaps -- it might\nhave been two or three days, or a week. I really don\u2019t know, because th-there was\ntalk about it earlier and we -- and -- and one of the visits was scrubbed and I do -- I\ndon\u2019t know what the reason was, but then we eventually did go. So it had to be -- it\nhad to be s-several days, but these bodies, they wouldn\u2019t let them just sit there all the\ntime, so it had to be pretty fast. It had to be.",
        "A: Oh, because if they got food, their stomachs were contracted to an extent that food\nwould kill them. And so the -- and -- and they, of course, didn\u2019t know, and so th --\nbut the soldiers, who -- we were very good about that. Everybody wanted to help\nthem, to give them something, candy bars, anything that we had, but that -- that\nwasn\u2019t doing them any good. So that was the fear.\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: Oh, th-the stench, of course, was overpowering as you -- as you walked in, but\nthere was a large gate as we walked into that, and there was a compound where there\nwere posts that were stuck in the ground, and I understand that those were whipping\nposts, and a [indecipherable] somebody was chastised and whipped and -- and so\nforth on these posts and tied to them, and left there sometimes overnight and\notherwise. And then there were a series of barracks that were -- were approximately\n15 or 20 feet apart and they were maybe 150 - 200 feet long, and maybe 25 or 30 feet\nwide. And there was an aisle in the middle of each barrack and as -- as we entered on\nthe first barrack that we entered, there were still people in th-their area, these were\nsome that had survived, obviously. And they were in their niche, as they were -- as --\nas they called them, this is my spot. Surprisingly enough, we also saw some that --\nsome women that were kept as prostitutes for the camp people. And they were, of\ncourse, favored by the Germans because they wanted them to still continue to\nfunction. But anybody in the camp that had anything to do with them was\nimmediately ostracized amongst the people, from the way I understand from -- I\ntalked to several of them for that matter, I talked to some of them that spoke\nAugust 18, 2003\nRomanian and -- and they were Romanian Jews, and not political prisoners and they\nop -- from what they told me, you know, these people that were ostracized that way\nwere shunned completely and actually, eventually they would die out.

        "A: They didn\u2019t believe that they were re -- that they were free, that they could\npossibly be free. That this couldn\u2019t possibly be happening to them. Their -- that\nfreedom was the next step that they were going to see. They all anticipated dying.",
        "A: N-No, they were just all -- I -- no, they were not only Jewish, no. They were all --\nall ethnic groups. I\u2019m sure there were Greeks and Italians and --",
        "A: Well, we went to the crematorium and as -- I saw that, th-the ovens. There were\nS1X Or -- SIX Or Seven Ovens in there that I can remember.

So the -- and we saw d-downstairs where\nthey -- the hooks were. They -- they said that they reserved this for -- for fliers, for --\nfor our air force people. Why that would be as -- I don\u2019t understand, but interrogation\nor something like that, I don\u2019t have any idea why they would want to interrogate once\nthey got to this particular camp is beyond me. I should think that by the time they got\nthere, they were pretty well interrogated.",
        "A: Oh, there were some, but I didn\u2019t see any.",
        "A: Yes. I\u2019m glad you mentioned that because I almost forgot about it completely. The\ncommandants wife had quarters there, and I believe they called her the bitch of\nBuchenwald.

And then when\nwe came back out again, they were still there, but it didn\u2019t mean anything. And it felt\nAugust 18, 2003\nto us that they were not sincere, that they had to know what was going on wi -- up\nuntil then there was a doubt, but we knew that they knew.

And this was supposed to be [indecipherable] of rest and relaxation,\nbut 1-1n anticipation of the end of the war, and indeed we really had it very nice there.\nAnd the war did end, V-E day, it\u2019s -- the European war only. And of course we, the\nunit we\u2019ve been such old tried and true soldiers who\u2019d been there so long, we didn\u2019t\nhave to worry about being sent to the South Pacific. But that 285\" that I mentioned\nearlier, they were the youngsters and they were -- mobilized them and they were on\ntheir way immediately. And I wanted to -- I had enough points, because you got\npoints for the number of months that you were there, to be discharged, and I said\nfine, I want to go home. And they said, well it\u2019ll take quite a bit of time because\nthere\u2019s -- it\u2019s going to take preference to get these troops moved into the South\nPacific, so we need all that transportation. I said, well, I\u2019ve missed so much school,\nI'd like to apply to go to school here. I had heard about an American school in\nBiarritz, France, and they says, okay. And I applied and within 24 hours I was on a\ntrain on the way to Biarritz. And as I was on the way to Biarritz, we were -- we had\nstopped in -- in Nancy, France, Nantaise as they call it and the newspapermen were\nAugust 18, 2003\nhowling and yowling that we dropped an atom bomb on the Japanese. That was\nNagasaki, or -- or Hiroshima, which one of them was first. And that this was\nanticipation of the end of the war. And on -- on the next station that we stopped at,\nthey said that probably the war would end. And then I understand we dropped\nanother bomb subsequently and then the war did end. But in the meantime I went to\nBiarritz, and this is on the Bay of Biscay, on the Atlantic, it\u2019s a big, beautiful resort\nthat the Germans used for their officers. So we went into a city -- I w-went into a city\nthat was pro-German. They didn\u2019t want us in there at all, cause they had it nice. The\nGerman officers treated them well, and you know, gave them food and you know,\nthey -- they -- they lived very well. So th-th -- it took us a long time, that is months to\ngo ahead and -- and si -- and make inroads into the fact that we were the ones that\nfreed them, and that freedom was a heck of a lot better than just being subservient to\nGermans. But I just continued my college courses there, and -- and I got full credit\nfor them, and on the second or third -- second of December, 1945, my semester had\nended and they said, y -- okay, you can go home now.

So I got my degrees the following year, I\u2019d already had one year of\nmedical school at the time. So it was kind of nice. Actually, I had almost caught up to\nmyself. So then four years of medical school, graduated 1951 and was an intern at\nWestern Pennsylvania Hospital in Pittsburgh. I went to Pitt, and subsequent to that,\nwhile I was at Pitt and I had the -- been an intern and an extern as well. My grades\nwere good and when you were a good student you could live outside, and I lived in\nthe hospital. And the-they challenged me quite a bit as to what I was going to be and\nI was going to be a surgeon. And they said, well, wen -- we\u2019re going to send you to\nschool. So here comes school again and I says, fine. And they sent me to University\nof Pennsylvania, the graduate school of surgery. And I spent a year there doing\nnothing but surgery. And while there is when I met the great Bailey, the heart\nsurgeon and -- and I was challenged there by being an assistant --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: They sent me to the University of Pennsylvania and while there I spent a year\ndoing nothing but graduate surgery, and surgeons from all over the world who were\ngathered there and I was the baby, by the way, I was the youngest one in the class.\nAnd while there is when Bailey did his first heart surgery, at Harmon Hospital there.\nAnd we as students there were allowed to go out and ob-observe all the types of\nsurgeries that were done within the university\u2019s per view, and at the University of\nPennsylvania, Dr. Grof, G-r-o-f was the neurosurgeon there and he asked if I would\nhelp him on one of his craniotomies, operating on the head. I said, I\u2019ll be glad to,\nbecause I had a lot of experience in surgery from where I had come from. And I did.\nAnd I was so taken by him while we were operating that he challenged me to the\npoint whereby he said, I will get you a residency, if not right here, I know where y --\nI want you to go. And I said, are you -- he said, you\u2019d make a great neurosurgeon. I\nsaid, well I -- I just wanted to be a surgeon at that time and he se -- I says, but that\nmeans another five or six years. And up until that particular point, you know, I\n[indecipherable] I wondered whether that was a wise decision to make, but I\u2019m -- I\ndil -- I was delighted with what we were doing, so I said yes. Anyway, then he was\none of my champions as far as referral was concerned and I applied to several places\nthat he had w-wanted me to go, and ended up under Jack French in Long Beach,\nCalifornia, the V.A. hospital, and spent five years there. And in that fifth year I was\nchief of neurosurgery at the hospital because Jack French got married, and he wa --\nAugust 18, 2003\nmarried the diva Dorothy Kirsten. In -- in her day -- she\u2019s the one that was thrown\nout of Russia, by the way, because of her attitude. They said -- of her American\nattitude, that is. Persona non grata, they called her. This was back in Stalin\u2019s days.\nAnyway, the thing about it was that he -- and he wanted to take a year off as a\nsabbatical and he says, you\u2019re going to be chief. And I went from, I think it was\n9,000 dollars a year to 30,000 dollars a year as chief. Wow, talk about living it up. I\nstill remember that very well. I was married at that time and we had our first child\nthere in -- in Long Beach. And things were pretty tough on 9,000 dollar a year and\nwe lived just a -- where Disneyland was built. And the kids in my youngster\u2019s age\ngroup were asked to come to try out Disneyland before they even opened it. And so\nhe got to know pretty well what the rides were going to be and everything else. But\nwe didn\u2019t stay there, I wanted to come back east again. The California type of life\nwas not my type of life. [indecipherable] as I always say, the -- there was always\nsomebody running around with somebody else\u2019s wife. And it was just different. A\nbar on every corner, school three sessions a day. Some of them were four hours\napiece and they\u2019d have the three sessions, three different groups. Th-They were\ncrowded. So anyhow, I-I wanted to come back here, and I came. When I finished I\ncame back here. And the reason I did come to this particular area is because before I\nwent overseas I was stationed at Fort Mead. And when I had got leave while I was\nstationed at Fort Mead, I came into this area and came into Arlington, and I loved\nAugust 18, 2003\nArlington. Arlington was just gorgeous. Still is, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t was just\ngorgeous. I said, one of these days I\u2019m going to live there. And that\u2019s what I did, I\ncame here. There was one other neurosurgeon here and we went into partnership\ntogether and everybody in the District of Columbia kept saying, what are you --\nwhat are you going over there, that\u2019s on the other side of the river. Nothing is every\ngoing to happen there. So the thing that happened 1s we built all these hospitals and I\nwas the founder of Fairfax Hospital, the founder of Northern Virginia Doctor\u2019s\nHospital. The founder of National Orthopedic Hospital. So we built our own\nhospitals and we -- w -- and it -- 1t -- 1t was quite nice and had a nice practice, and I\npractice in what -- what I refer to as the golden age of medicine, where there was no\nMedicare or Medicaid and not everybody was entitled to everything under God\u2019s\ncreation. They got treated free in most of my practice. Back early on, 40 percent of it\nwas gratis, it -- it was free patients, so -- but I made my first dollar when I was about\n36 years old. And everybody says, boy, it takes a long time to be a neurosurgeon. It\ndoes. And I think it\u2019s going to be even longer, they\u2019re going to make it longer.",
        "A: Well, actually I have three and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m in my second marriage, we\u2019ve been\nmarried 22 years. And she had two, so we have five all together. And all -- all of\nthem are out of school, graduated, they\u2019re all in their 40\u2019s. They\u2019re attorneys, no\ndoctors. Lot of attorneys. One\u2019s a judge. So we\u2019re -- we\u2019re doing very well.\nAugust 18, 2003",
        "A: Oh my, as -- as they were growing up, they -- they know most of these stories,\ncause they would ask me, and I -- I -- I -- we would sit sometimes after dinner and\njust -- just talk about things in general, and th-th -- these subjects would come up.\nAnd they\u2019d ask -- they ask particularly about the atrocities and the camps and so\nforth, knowing -- and they know, of course that I have th -- had these pictures and\nthey all saw these, so they knew that this -- this was something that did really happen.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I can\u2019t say maturity because once you got into the service you became mature no\nmatter whether you wanted to or not. I wasn\u2019t -- when I came back from the service -\n- | -- I went into the service as a young college boy that probably had a beanie on his\nhead. I came back from the service as a mature man that never belonged to a -- a\nfraternity or anything like that, because that was a lot of bunk, as we felt coming\nback. So we set up our own organizations. But I think that my entire wartime\nexperience gave me a sense of understanding of what man can do to man. What --\nwhat had happened in Germany should never happen again, and I understand that\nit\u2019s been happening in some of these other countries, in Africa and otherwise. And\nthat just recently Idi Amin just died and he was one of these Hitlers. He was -- and\nAugust 18, 2003\nhe was responsible for millions of deaths as well, and he -- he doesn\u2019t have the\nnotoriety that Hitler had obviously, but I think he -- the -- the people\n[indecipherable] know that he\u2019s done this.",
        "A: No, but it\u2019s just been wonderful to have you ask me the questions, because it woke\nup memories that I\u2019m going to be talking about for the next couple of weeks, I think,\na-again. And I want the children to know and remember some of those things and I\nthink that\u2019s a good thing. And so I want to thank you for asking.",
        "A: Oh, my pleasure.\n"
