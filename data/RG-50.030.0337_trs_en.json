        "Question: I'd like you to start by stating your name, your date of birth, where you were born.",
        "Answer: My name is Herbert Katzki. I was born October 4, 1907 in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Most\npeople don't know where Elizabeth is, but there 1s such a place. I come from there.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and personal background in terms of -- a religious home, a\npolitically active home.",
        "A: Well, let's see. I moved from Elizabeth to New York, and it was in 1917. We -- it was a\ncombination of households. I lost my father at that time, and we were going to move in with my\ngrandfather, and he passed away. And so we were there along my -- my mother with two children\nand her mother. And so we had to get along. My education was in the New York school system. I\nwent to New York University, got a degree in finance, did graduate work in economics. Went to\nschool at night, worked during the daytime, various jobs. One job, though, that I took in 1929, I\nwas working in the credit department of a mercantile firm. Working in the credit department\ndecided me on becoming a credit man. And so in school, I studied credits and collections. That\nwas the subject of my major and accounting. In 1929, though, I switched over from this particular\nfirm and went into the banking business. As part of my banking training I was going to become a\nbanker and a businessman. Went into the Manufacturers Trust Company. I started working for the\nManufacturers Company a few days before Black Friday in 1929. And I guess that probably\ninfluenced my career. Anyhow, I was with the bank until 1936. They got looking around to see\nhow things were going. Somebody suggested that I see the JDC, Joint Distribution Committee, and\nthey asked me to come in to do a special job that needed doing. And in due course I was prevailed\nupon to give them one year out of my life to do this special job. The one year out of my life turned\nout to be about 60 years. That was a very long agreement. I worked in the New York headquarters\noffice of the Joint Distribution Committee. Then until 1939 -- I was there until November. How\ncome? The war began in September. It became apparent to me as it did to others that\ncircumstances will have changed in Europe, and JDC would need all the help it could over in\nEurope. I volunteered to go overseas. I was accepted, and I went overseas. And I arrived overseas\nin December 1939. My first permanent job, we thought would be in Paris, the headquarters 1n Paris,\nwhere I served as the secretary of the European Executive Council of the JDC and did my job there.\nThe head of the overseas operations at that time was a man by the name of Morris Troper,\nT-r-o-p-e-r, who was the director general of the overseas operation of the JDC. He was joined by a\nman by the name of Schwartz, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, who came over to Europe at that time to join\nMr. Troper. Joe Schwartz landed in Italy, joined Troper, who was going to Eastern Europe, who at\nthat time was making a visit around in Europe to make plans with the agencies with which the JDC\nwas cooperating for the event that war would ensue and we would be cut off. While they were\noverseas, war did ensue. While they were traveling around in Europe, war did come along. That\nwas in June 1940. They were traveling around. The Germans were practically knocking on the\ndoor in Paris. I was in charge of the office. It was the European headquarters, I was in charge of the\noffice at the time. After making diligent inquiry, I came to the conclusion that the JDC has to move\nits office. It couldn't remain there. Having arranged with other Jewish organizations working in\nParis at the time, like ORT-HIAS, the French-Jewish organizations and so on, none of us would\nmove without advising the others. I came to the conclusion on a Sunday that we were going to\nmove out, having consulted with the American Embassy, who at that time were following up the\nFrench, who were making up their minds as to whether they wanted to get out of Paris or not and so\non. Decided to close up the office and to move out. That was on Monday -- it's Monday -- that was\non Sunday. I guess that was on June the 8th or -- if that was a Sunday. Anyhow, that Sunday\naround June, decided to close the office. Closed the office, moved -- intended originally to move to\nTours. Couldn't go to Tours because the French government had decided that they were going to\nevacuate from Paris to Tours, and they occupied the city to such an extent that nobody else would\nbe permitted to come in. In that same Sunday, when we decided to close the office, I had to phone\nthe staff to ask them to come into Monday, prepare to travel out, we're leaving Paris. They came in\nMonday to leave the office with their baggage and so on, and they went over to the railroad station.\nI came there when I -- as I began to say, in that Sunday I phoned around to tell the other agencies\nwe decided to move to discover that they had already left without telling us. And the JDC was the\nonly Jewish organization, welfare organization, in Paris, all by ourselves. Well, Dr. Schwartz and\nMr. Troper came back to Paris on Monday. The rest of the staff had left. I had kept the office open.\nThere were just one -- two secretaries, myself and -- no, three secretaries, myself and then the two\ngentlemen who came back. We closed down the -- closed down the shop on Tuesday, and the\nGermans came in on Thursday. As I said, we've started out for Tours, we couldn't get in, had to\nchange directions. We ended up in Bordeaux. We moved the JDC headquarters over to Bordeaux",
        "Q: Can I interrupt you here. I have a question.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You were in Europe already when there had been quite a build up, and the war certainly had\nstarted --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- in Europe. What was the mood? What did you think was going to happen?",
        "A: The mood in Paris was very confusing at the time, because when you walked down the Champs\nElysees, you had the impression there was absolutely nothing going on, everything looked normal.\nAnd you couldn't tell by looking around the streets that anything was happening at all. And I think\nthat up to that point the French had the feeling that their army was invincible, and they were going\nto stop off the Germans. Well, it was misplaced, as you know. So that -- we ended up, then, in\nBordeaux. We moved the office down there. We sent out the cables to all the agencies in Europe\nwith which we had been operating to tell them where our new office was in Bordeaux, to discover\nlater on that the center had held up the cables, and none of them had gone out. They were held up\nby the center, by the military people in Bordeaux. We were in Bordeaux (ph) for about four or five\ndays. Government in the meantime had moved down to Bordeaux. The Germans knew that, and\nthreatened to bomb the city. As a matter of fact, they did drop a couple of bombs around the\nrailroad station to let the French know that they're still around. And the French, then, had sat down\nand said, \"Anybody who wants to leave Bordeaux, must leave by midnight of a certain day or you\ncan't get out.\" So we were there. Troper, the couple of secretaries and I, Schwartz (ph), we were in\nBordeaux. We decided to get out. We made the midnight deadline, slept out in the fields, just to get\nout of Bordeaux. As a matter of fact, the road were so crowded at that time with refugees -- who\nwere coming down from Belgium into France, and from Northern France going down to Southern\nFrance -- that the automobile trip that normally took seven hours from Paris to Bordeaux, it took us\nthree days to get down there. The roads were that crowded with refugees. And we had hardships\nalong the road too, ran out of gasoline and shelter and all that sort of thing. So we decided then to\nget out of Bordeaux. We did that and headed for Lisbon and decided that the Lisbon was the\nfurthest west one could go in Europe to still be in European territory, and that's the place to have the\noffice. That was all right because the United States was not yet in the war. This was in -- when we\nwent to Lisbon, that was in June, July 1940. So we didn't go to the war until December [1941], so it\nwas all right for us to stay in Lisbon, and that's where we were going to make our new headquarters.\nI went back to Marseille after the armistice to see whether there was any work that the JDC could do\nwith the French-Jewish population, especially -- particularly the refugees, who were coming down\nthere from the north and from Belgium. Decided that there was work that the JDC could do, and I\nopened up the office for the JDC in Marseille for unoccupied France.",
        "Q: I want to backtrack a minute.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Because I have a lot of questions. In 1939 and 1940 before Paris was occupied --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Where were your efforts directed? Where were the JDC -- were you sending money into\nGermany or --",
        "A: No. Starting with 1933 with the advent of Hitler, we did not send any money into Germany.\nWe had worked out an arrangement with the German Rifentrajung (ph) and the German\nHoopsverine (ph), which were the agencies in Germany with which we worked, whereby they\nwould collect to the extent that they could the cost of passage for people immigrating to the United\nStates. They would collect them in Marks, and we would buy their steamship tickets for the dollars.\nConsequently our dollars did not go into Germany, but the counter-value of local currency, which\nwas already in Germany, was made available to the agency with which we operated. So if you ask\nif we sent money in, we did not. We operated that kind of a transaction. And when Austria was\nover-- office was the anschluss, we did the same thing with Austria. And in due course we even\nworked out by financial ledgerdomain to get money into Poland. We didn't send money into Poland\neither.",
        "Q: You went over with this purpose?",
        "A: No, I went over for the -- I didn't go over as a financier. I went over as a -- as a generalist, who\nhappened to know something about finance, but that isn't why I went over. I went over, as I say, as\na generalist.",
        "Q: Is that what --",
        "A: You ask what did we do out of Lisbon. And Lisbon, since we were not in the war, and Lisbon\nwas neutral, we could still communicate with any of the agencies with which we had formally been\nin contact with, by phone or mail or whatever. But of course, by mail we would not have tried to\nget in touch -- or any other way -- with Germany, because anything that a name like Jewish, who\nwould have been -- tripped us___\u2014_\u2014sain Germany, and it wouldn't have gone through anyhow. And\nthe same thing with Austria. But with the other countries we could still work. There weren't many\ncountries left where the Germans -- of course they occupied everything. So that while we were at\nliberty to do it, we were rather restricted in what we could do.",
        "Q: Now, being that you were in Europe.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You, I assume, had a lot more information about what was already happening in Germany and\nAustria than the people back in the United States had.",
        "A: The curious thing is this: People thought that since I was in Lisbon -- back in Lisbon in 1943 --\nthat we knew all about what was going on with the stories that were coming out from the\nconcentration camps, which later became known. We did not -- I did not know that in Lisbon. We\ndidn't have that information. The information that was coming out on that was being sent out by\nRiegner from Geneva, and it got over to the State Department through the help of the American\nMission in Berne. And they suppressed it, because they said they wanted proof that the stories that\nwere coming out were accurate, and they were going to hold up the information until they got that\nproof. Well, as you know, it took months before the story finally was released what was going on.\nBut in Lisbon, we didn't know it, because the Portuguese papers certainly didn't carry it. They didn't\nknow it either. They had no reporters running around loose, going into the camps or something. So\nwe didn't know it. And only Riegner's reports brought the information out, and they were\nsuppressed. So the information wasn't generally known. So we worked then. We stayed in contact,\nwhich was all right until December 1941, when -- everything got stopped off when we entered the\nwar, and then we were fighting with Germany and with Austria, and the Italians came in in June\n1941. And so we couldn't communicate with them and so on. We had to find other ways then for\nremaining in contact and communicating with them. We got in touch with a man in Switzerland.\nYou may have heard his name, Soudymiah (ph). His name keeps coming up. He lived in up in St.\nGallen in North Switzerland, who was president of the central Swiss welfare, Jewish welfare\norganization. And he agreed temporarily to act for the JDC in Switzerland. He finally gave up that\nposition with the Swiss agency in order to devote all his time to JDC. So he became JDC's\nrepresentative in Switzerland. And it turned out that he was our delegate for all these countries\nwhich the JDC itself as an American organization could not come in contact, which meant that he\nwas in contact with Hungary, with Romania, and even with Shanghai, with France, occupied, and so\non. And he did the things for us. Communication with Soudymiah was easy enough by telephone.\nFrom Lisbon you could talk back and forth -- you could talk to Switzerland. That was all right.\nYou just had to be careful about routing the telephone calls, because if they crossed -- going to cross\nFrance, that was Germany. Do it by ____; they were more liberal. And you could make your\ntelephone calls that way, and even send mail that way in Lisbon. So that's how we kept in touch,\nthen, with the countries with which the JDC -- which the United States ultimately was in war with.",
        "Q: When you were in Southern France in, I guess, 1939, 1940?",
        "A: I went there --",
        "Q: Were the refugees there?",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: What was that operation about? What did you do there? Tell me more about it.",
        "A: Working out of France, that was strictly for France. The refugees who had been up in the\nnorthern part -- it turned out to be the German-occupied area -- to the extent that they could, they\ncame down to the southern part. Who were they? The ex-Germans and the ex-Austrians and the\nex- other countries with which the Germans -- the Germans were at war -- so they came down\nsouth. The Belgians came down south, so there were plenty of refugees in the unoccupied zone.\nAlso came to Marseille the agencies with which we had been working in Paris. They were\nevacuated the same as we were. They ended up in Marseille too. The office was in Marseille\nwith which we worked, they were there. The Ose -- you may have heard about them -- O-s-e.\nThat's . They were down there. The agencies with which the JDC had operated in Paris\nwere over in Marseille, so we just resumed contact with them. And we knew how they operated,\nthey knew how we operated. We were back in business again --",
        "Q: So what were you able to do down there?",
        "A: -- in Marseille. The assistance which was given in the unoccupied zone was mainly a cash relief\nassistance program, because it was still possible for people to buy things in the stores and so on.\nAnd their big problem was that they had no jobs, and what they needed was some money with\nwhich to live. And the JDC provided that. The OSE was a medical assistance organization, and\nthey cared for children. So they did their job. They had misunderatret (ph) -- installations where\nchildren, unaccompanied children were. And they had a medical program. The HIAS (Hebrew\nImmigration and Sheltering) -- what the HIAS -- you know what the HIAS -- you know that?",
        "Q: Yeah. What I know is that's sort of a few.",
        "A: We just had to provide -- we just had to -- we provided them with funds so that they could\ncontinue operating in these various fields which I have just described to you. And we worked with\nwelfare organizations too. There was a Jewish welfare organization in Lyons, which was pretty\nlarge. And the other thing that we did out of Marseille was to continue sending assistance up to\nParis. Of course we had left behind in Paris there some Jewish people who remained up in Paris\nand kept the organizations going and so on. And there was a woman who was active in the\nInternational Social Service, a non-Jewish lady who used to travel back and forth between the two\nzones. And we would give her a sum of money, and she would take it up with her back to Paris.\nAnd she would bring back the reports from Paris so that we knew what was going on up there at\nleast and could follow up on their household and financing arrangements and so on. And so that's\nhow we kept in touch with Paris. And so out of Marseille we were able to keep things on some kind\nof a fairly even keel in France. That went along reasonable all right until November 1942. In\nNovember 1942, the Germans came down and occupied the unoccupied zone and so on. And then\nthings became a little bit topsy-turvy, because the Jewish refugees, they had no particular resource\nto which they could turn back on. And our office in Marseille became peripatetic, because they\ncouldn't afford being around with the Germans and ___ looking for Jewish people and so on. So\nit became peripatetic and so on. But the work continued, and during the whole war period the JDC\nprograms continued. Of course there was problems connected with it. It didn't necessarily work\nsmoothly, but to the extent possible, continued in both zones.",
        "Q: Did you get at all involved with the French-Jewish resistance? Did you give them any kind of\nassistance?",
        "A: When I left Germany -- when I left France, I came on home leave -- I left Marseille in the end of\nSeptember, I think, or beginning of October of 1941 for some home leave. And I was on my way\nback to Lisbon when we entered the war. My assistant, who remained in Marseille, who was\nFrench, he took over then, when I couldn't go back. It subsequently developed that this assistant\nwas active in the Jewish Army of Resistance. We didn't know it at the time -- extracurricular\nactivity. And we didn't know that until he left France and came down to Barcelona. So that if you\nask were we in contact with the resistance, sure, we were. As a matter of fact one of the things that\nwe financed in France was the -- we helped the local organization -- we didn't do it ourselves. We\ndidn't work in our own name in France. We worked through local organizations, which as you\nknow is a matter of policy of the JDC. We worked through local organizations. And one of the\norganizations with which we worked had a business of providing false documents through Jewish\npeople. As a matter of fact, I'm told -- I didn't know this until later -- I'm told that these things were\nprinted at the office of the . But they worked with our money.",
        "Q: You worked with organizations, were they Jewish organizations?",
        "A: Jewish organizations, yes. They worked with our money. Most of the agencies, Jewish\nagencies, in France were working with our money. We might not have had our own personnel\nthere, but -- you see, one of the advantages that JDC has -- we have been in business for a long time.\nWe started in 1914 with this first shipment to Palestine. We learned something from the first war.\nAnd the first war was that we should do things in our own name, but to work through indigenous\norganizations. Because if we do things in our own name with our own personnel, the day we pull\nout -- and we thought we were temporary -- the day we pull out would be the day the agency would\ncollapse. The work would collapse. So we developed local organizations 1n all the countries in\nwhich we operate, and we always worked through them. And our advantages that we had that when\nthe JDC was not present, they knew enough about what the JDC -- how it operated and what its\ndesires were and so on that they were able to function __\u2014_\u2014r without our actually being there, but\nthey carried on. And that's what kept the JDC going. \"JDC\" quote, unquote had all of these\ncountries in Europe from which the JDC had no direct contact, but they knew enough about what\nthey had learned from us, which we had learned after the first World War to keep on going. And\nthere was always some embryonic JDC around in the countries of Europe that keep things going.\nAnd so that's how the work continued in France for the refugees and kept on that way, I guess, in\n1944, when our Paris office was reopened, when Paris was liberated. We went back to Paris again\non the same premises which we had, which we had closed up in June 1940, went right back into the\nsame premises.",
        "Q: Now, you took a little bit of a detour before going back to Paris?",
        "A: When did I go back to Paris?",
        "Q: Didn't you go for a while to the War Refugee Board?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, I went back --",
        "Q: Or that was afterwards?",
        "A: No, no. I'll tell you. So I went on home leave, as I told you, in 1941. I was on my way back to\nMarseille when we went into the war, and we were -- there was so -- little uncertainty that the\nGermans were coming down into Portugal that our New York office sent their message over to\nLisbon, all the Americans had come home. So I landed in Lisbon on Monday, and on Friday I was\non back to the States. And it took me a good couple of months before I could have permission to go\nback to Lisbon again. I was in Lisbon there until the end of 1943, when I entered the army. But my\nmilitary service was on Detached Service as a special attache (ph) to the American Embassy in\nAnkara, Turkey, which I did as an army man. And that was for the War Refugee Board, when I\nwent back to Turkey. Turkey was an area through which there could have been -- and to a certain\nextent there was -- movement of refugees to Palestine. The people who were coming out from\nHungary, from Poland would come out via Varna, which is in Bulgaria or via Constanta, which is in\nRomania. They would come out by boat down through the Black Sea as far as Istanbul and then\nover land to Palestine. I was attached to the embassy in Ankara, but I was stationed in Istanbul for\nthe War Refugee Board. And that was part of my job in connection with this movement going\nthrough. The work for the refugees in Istanbul was divided in three ways. There were three\nagencies involved. The Jewish agency was there to control -- to have something to say about people\ngoing to Palestine and issuing certificates for that purpose. There was another group of individuals\nfrom Palestine stationed in Istanbul representing the different political parties __\u2014_ that the Mossad\n-- you probably have heard. The Mossad spoken about, they were the Mossad. They were there.\nSo you had the Jewish agency doing the technical work. You had the Mossad organizing these\ntransports. The JDC was there. They did the financial work. The War Refugee Board did the\npolitical work. What was their political work? The Turks would not give transit visas to anybody.\nIn order to get through to Palestine, you had to go via Turkey. Turkey wouldn't let them through.\nWhy wouldn't they let them through? Because the British wouldn't let them into Palestine, no place\nto go. So there had to be discussions and negotiations and one thing or another with the British and\nwith the Turks. That was War Refugee Board business. And finally the Turks agreed to give a\ntransit visa to any refugee who could put his foot on Turkish soil. So the job was to get the people\nto Turkey. So they got them to Turkey. They came from Ubea (ph), which 1s an island off Greece.\nThey came across, and they landed in Ismea. They came by boat from Constanta and Varna\nthrough the Black Sea to Istanbul, and a couple of transports even came through by train to Istanbul.\nAnd since they got their foot on Turkey soil, they got transit visas -- the place agreed to let them in,\nand so they -- I don't know, about 9,000, 10,000, something like that -- got into Palestine that way\nthrough the -- it was an effort of the War Refugee Board and the political angle. When I finished\nwith the job in Turkey -- because you remember Bulgaria and Romania turned around in 1944 and\nentered the war on our side -- they didn't need the War Refugee Board anymore in Turkey. And I\nwas reassigned to the mission in Berne, Switzerland for the War Refugee Board. I was stationed in\nGeneva. What was my job there for the War Refugee Board? There was a group of Hungarians -- I\ndon't know, about three or four hundred Hungarians -- who were admitted under certain\ncircumstances, permitted to leave Budapest and ended up in Bergen-Belsen. And we tried to prevail\nupon the Swiss to let them come in to Switzerland instead of sitting up in Bergen-Belsen. And we\ngave the Swiss a guarantee that at the earliest moment, if they would let these people into\nSwitzerland, we will evacuate them. So we worked that one out, and they had these three or four\nhundred people came down from Bergen-Belsen, and they landed in Switzerland. And then it was\nmy job to get them out of Switzerland, and I had to do that through the army and field telephones,\nall kinds of things. Anyhow, they got out of Switzerland, and they went to Palestine.",
        "Q: When you say \"got them out,\" can you tell me a little bit more about how you did that?",
        "A: Yes. For instance, when we got them out -- the army controlled the transportation. Anything\nthat moved -- that involved transportation had to do through the army. So I would go from Geneva\ninto France, where there was an army host on their field telephone, to get through via the field\ntelephone from Annacey through Lyons, from Lyons to Paris, to talk to the transport people in Paris.\nThe transport people from Paris moved. They moved from Paris to Rehon (ph). That's where the\ntreaty was signed, the peace was signed. So then another operation I had to go through to get\nthrough Lyons -- after the armistice, they moved to Germany, and they ended up in the Archifaven\n(ph) building in Frankfurt, had to get through to Frankfurt. All this by telephone, the field telephone\nand so on. Anyhow, that's how I got them out, by working it out with the army transport that they\nwould take them, because they had to go by boat through the Mediterranean -- by land you could\nget them to Italy. They went down by train -- Italy, but they didn't control the boats. The boats, you\nhad to do that through the army. So that's how they -- how this particular group was moved out.",
        "Q: What time period are talking about here?",
        "A: Swiss trains.",
        "Q: What time period?",
        "A: This was in 19 -- 1945. I would say about July or August 1945.",
        "Q: So I just want to ask you questions for my own clarity.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You started with the War Refugee Board --",
        "A: Yeah, then when the war was over, I got out of the army. When I got out of the army, that\nreleased me from the War Refugee Board. So that ended up the War Refugee Board job, which I\ntold you started in February 1944, and it landed until I got out of the army in October 1945. That\nfinished me with the War Refugee Board, that finished me with the army. I went back to the JDC. I\nwent back overseas again.",
        "Q: Okay. Back to the War Refugee Board. How large of an operation was this?",
        "A: What with the War Refugee Boards? We had -- there were exactly four people in this dembo\n(ph) in Turkey. It was Ira Hirschman (ph), who was the chief of mission. There was myself, two\nsecretaries. That was the whole War Refugee Board in Turkey. And we worked through everybody\nelse, through the Jewish agency, with the Joint (ph), everybody we worked through. But that was\nour job.",
        "Q: Did you work with other U.S. organizations like the State Department or the OSS or --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. The War Refugee Board consisted of three people with the secretaries, the treasury,\nwhich was Morgenthau. There was Secretary Stimson. I think he was war. And I think Hull was\nSecretary of State. Anyhow, there were three Secretaries of State with the War Refugee Board\nresponsible directly to the President. So we were in that channel with the War Refugee Board. That\nwas our contact, that was the backing that we had. And then in consequence of that, we were\npractically unique, because we had permission to deal with the enemy that was going to be of any\nway to help the refugees. So we were entitled -- normally American citizens could do that. We\nwere authorized to deal with the enemy in order to do what we had to do to rescue people. The War\nRefugee Board, they had a representative in Stockholm. That was Iva Olsen (ph), who had worked\nout the deal with Raul Wallenberg, who ended up in Budapest. You've heard of Raul Wallenberg.\nThe War Refugee Board had a representative in Lisbon, they had one in London. That was about it.",
        "Q: Did you --",
        "A: We did the work -- what?",
        "Q: Did you have the support you needed from the State Department in war --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You had what you needed?",
        "A: The War Ref-- well, as far as we were concerned, out in the field, our contact was the\nheadquarters of the War Refugee Board in Washington. Let them worry what they're going -- but\nthey were helpful, because we had the three Secretaries of State, and so they were helpful. We got\nhelp from the OWI and others. We had to have that kind of -- had to have that kind of help, because\nwe were only a facilitating group to get things done. We were dependent on other people. One of\nthe big problems of the War Refugee Board was that the government gave them no money. The\ngovernment gave them money, only enough to cover their administration expenses. And the other\nrequirements of the War Refugee Board was paid by the Joint. You find the Joint all over the place.\nWe were paid by JDC. For instance, example, Raul Wallenberg -- you know what he did in\nBudapest with our money. JDC was our money. JDC was helping me, War Refugee Board. I was\nwearing that hat at that ttme. But the JDC was all over the place. They were very helpful. In any\nevent, then I went back overseas, then, to JDC. And when I went back overseas, then, I went to the\nParis office, because the Arab -- the Paris office had in the meantime then retransferred to Lisbon\nback to Paris after it was possible for us to go back up there. I got back to Paris in December '45,\nwas there for a couple of weeks when I had to go into Germany to relieve Jake Trobe (ph). I think I\ntold you about that inside before. Jake Trobe (ph), who was in charge of our office -- our operation\n-- in Germany, he got mixed up with this -- the General Morgan incident -- and he was withdrawn.\nAnd I went in to take over the German operation from him. That's what got me up to Erolson (ph),\nand got me --",
        "Q: Okay. But you need to tell me about this, because people may not have seen the other parts of\nthese interviews. So I need you to tell me when we're talking about, when you ended up going back\nto Paris and how you got up to Erolson and when that was -- just very briefly.",
        "A: Well, I got back to Paris in December 1945. I would like to make a break to tell you something\nelse. In 1943 when I went back to Lisbon, after a great deal of effort the United States finally\nagreed to accept 5,000 -- 5,000, it was 10,000 -- Jewish refugee children in the United States for\nsafekeeping during the war, the same way as they had permitted the English to come over here.\nYou remember when the English came in. They agreed to take them into the United States. And\none of the things I was supposed to do when I went back to Lisbon was do some work with this\nproject. I went back with another JDC member, the name is Soeboe (ph). And there was an\nAmerican agency involved in that, German-Jewish Children Agency, I think it was. So then we\nwent up to -- the effort was made with the French to give exit permits to the people to leave France\nwho had come out from the unoccupied zone, leave France -- former unoccupied zone. Laval\nrefused it. And Laval wouldn't let them out, and so the thing fell through. So they couldn't get the\nkids out. And the kids that we did bring out were kids who were already out, either in Spain or in\nPortugal or those children who with their parents were smuggled over the border from France into\nSpain, so acquired a couple of kids. Instead of having the 5,000, we only got about 2-, 300. That's\nall, because Laval put his foot down on it. So that's one effort we made with the refugee -- to help\nrefugees, and discovered then it didn't pan out. So then I went back to Paris, then, and took over\nthere from Jake Trobe (ph) in Germany. And in order to get back into Germany -- they ran a very\ntight operation. The army, of course, was responsible; the American army for the American zone,\nthe British army for the British zone, et cetera. And they were responsible for everything that went\non in their particular zones. Responsibility for the American army in the American zone, keep\npeace and quiet and so on. And while technically they were responsible for the welfare of the\npeople in the zone which they occupied, they said in effect, \"We're soldiers, we're not welfare\nworkers.\" And they gave the job to the UNRRA as a subcontractor, so to speak, to provide care for\nthe refugees and the displaced persons who were in Germany.",
        "Q: I'm sorry to interrupt you, but you went back, then, to Paris in November '45?",
        "A: Yeah, I went in November -- December '45, yeah. I left in November, yeah. And then went\nback to Paris in 1945. I was in Paris for a couple of weeks, and then were sent up to Germany to\ntake over from Jake Trobe (ph), who was reassigned. How do you get into Germany? Army had\nsubcontracted to UNRRA to provide basic care and maintenance for the refugees. The JDC was --\nin order to get in, we had to come in under the umbrella, then, of UNRRA. And UNRRA\u2019s\nheadquarters at that time were in Herxt (ph), which is outside of Frankfurt in Germany. A couple of\nweeks after I arrived in Herxt (ph) then, UNRRA\u2019s entire headquarters operation was sent up to\nErolson (ph) and so on. Since I was at JDC headquarters -- and at JDC headquarters, I was attached\nto UNRRA\u2019s headquarters -- the office had to move up to Erolson (ph) too, so that the headquarters\nfor the operation in Germany was in Erolson (ph). Headquarters for the American zone was in\nMunich. Headquarters for the British zone was in Bergen-Belsen. Berlin was Berlin, and the\nFrench zone was in -- oh, shoot -- I forget the name -- around Constance someplace. I don't\nremember the name. Anyhow, and so the work that I did in Germany was to travel around the\noffices to try to things going along smoothly. The JDC -- I mentioned this before, I guess -- ran a\nrather decentralized operation. The JDC proceeded on the ferry to trust the men in the field, where\nthe men were sent out to the field and certainly given the responsibility for maintaining a\ncountry-wide operation. He was carefully selected, because he had to make decisions on the spot,\ncouldn't go to Paris every time. He had to make a decision. Times were changing too quickly, and\nParis couldn't know the local conditions as well as the men on the spot. He had to make the\narrangements. So I traveled around the various offices, try to keep in touch, if I could help them\nwith some kind of guidance, you know, how their programs were going and so on. And I did that\nfor about a year, when we decided to decentralize further. Hence, having a central office for\nGermany, we had the zones, Munich, Belsen; report directly to Paris. And we eliminated the\noverall office for Germany itself. Berlin, I think, at that time headed into Munich. And that was an\noperation which we did for the refugees, for the displaced persons. And did our work, whatever it\nwas, to feed the people, to clothe the people. Actually, the UNRRA, they had the responsibility,\nthen, for the basic feeding of these people, which the army had subcontracted to them. But that was\nthe limit of their responsibility, to keep the people alive, to give them some medical help, to give\nthem shelter, give them some clothing. But there was a plethora of assistance, which the people\nrequired, which UNRRA didn't give them. There were questions of education and entertainment --\ngood Lord, anything that you could think of, UNRRA didn't do it. In addition to that, the food\nrations, which the refugees got -- the displaced persons got -- was so very low, and the diets were so\nmonotonous and so on. So the JDC, to put it very crudely, put the fringe on the embroidery. We\nprovided all these extra amenities that were supposed to make life more bearable for these people,\nwhich were terms of educations and lectures. And we had traveling entertainers and legal aid and\neverything that was required __..._It wasn't a job, we had to do it. So that was the JDC's job for\nall these people. That included immigration assistance too. How did we get into the immigration\nbusiness? I was on the telephone up in Erolson (ph), and I got a telephone call from Dr. Schwartz,\nwho was the head of the whole overseas operation -- telephoned the -- from Paris to ask me to get in\ntouch with our representatives in Stuttgart, that she should help a certain woman to immigrate --\nsome problem and some papers or something. And so I said to Dr. Schwartz, \"Why come to us?\nWe're not in the immigration business.\" And Dr. Schwartz said to me yes, we are, beginning now.\nAnd that was of the immigration business.",
        "Q: Now, was that in '46?",
        "A: That was in '46. We had been in the immigration business before that. When we were in\nLisbon, there was these people who were coming down from Germany and Austria and other\ncountries. Now, the HIAS was operating in Lisbon too at that time. But the HIAS, they operated\nwith individual cases. If a relative in New York or Kenosha, Wisconsin came to them and said I\nhave a relative, so and so, can you help them get out. And the HIAS would say give us the money\nfor the transportation, et cetera, et cetera. And then they would work on the case. We couldn't\nafford that luxury. We were in the wholesale business, because as I explained to you before, the\nHoofsverine (ph) and the Rifeserine (ph) and so on in Germany sent all their cases down to us,\nbecause we were paying their transportation as I explained. So consequently, we would have to buy\nall the passages on a ship in order to make room for these people who were coming down. So while\nthe HIAS, they were in the retail business, we were in the wholesale business. But we were in the\nwholesale business because Lisbon was the only port in Europe for which people could sail. All the\nother ports were occupied by the Germans -- or I take that back. Spain had some ports too that\nwere open. But Lisbon was the main port.",
        "Q: You know what, we need to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2",
        "Q: You were talking about the fact that the Jewish --",
        "A: Yeah, we were in the wholesale business.",
        "Q: Wholesale immigration business.",
        "A: Yeah, so we -- when I said Dr. Schwartz said we are now in the immigration business, we were\nin it before, but on a different level.",
        "Q: What other -- how else do you see the scope of your operation? What other kinds of aid did you\ngive?",
        "A: Did JDC give?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: To characterize the work that we do, we do everything from prenatal care to care for the aged.\nWe don't quite bury them, but everything in between we do, with the prenatal care and postnatal\ncare, kindergartens, educations -- public level education. Ted mentioned to you about the\nscholarship for the university students. The work that we're doing now in addition to care for the\naged -- in Israel, for example, we have training programs for principals of the ministries and\nmunicipalities to try to give them some notions as to how they might improve the services that they\ngive.",
        "Q: But back -- actually, I really need to focus a little bit back on the postwar years in Europe.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Well, with the -- well, that was about the work that could be done in Germany from\nthe cradle to the grave, but you know, the people who survived what they had gone through, I think\nthat there was a principle of natural selection that was involved, and the people who came through,\nmanaged to come through. So that what we had to do did not have to be ground down so finely.\nThe broader, simpler things we didn't have to do. So many of the things that we would do in a\ncountry, as I say -- like Israel which is much further advanced. So that's what we did in Israel, was\nsupply -- we had this big supply program going --",
        "Q: In Israel or in Europe? You just said Israel. Do you mean in Israel or in Europe are you talking\nabout?",
        "A: I'm back in Europe again, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. Thank you.",
        "A: With the supply program, what we did. We had a representative up in Stockholm. We had a\nrepresentative up in Copenhagen and another one in Oslo. And at least one could buy food and\nother things in Sweden, which were not available on the = \u2014.~ And so we bought food up there.\nWe bought dairy products in Copenhagen and whatever, and we loaded trucks and sent them down\nthrough. Some stopped off in Belsen. Others went to Berlin. They went over as far as Bublee (ph)\nwith the food stuff. They went through Krogg (ph), and we left food, which we had acquired in\nStockholm and so on. When the supply line from the United States wasn't open, we had to be\ncontent with what we could get up in the Scandinavian countries. And that went along all right,\nexcepting that there wasn't enough of it, but we couldn't give anymore than we got in, than we could\nacquire and so on. What else did we do? For the education side we had to print our own books.\nWe had an education -- he was principal of a school up in, I think, in Newton, Massachusetts. He\nwas principal of the school. He to come over to the JDC to go overseas as our education\nguy. So he was traveling around in Germany, stopped at one of the camps, spoke to one of the\nladies who was trying to do some educational work, a teacher. And she told him what a problem\nshe was having. She didn't have a blackboard, she didn't have any chalk, nothing. What did he do\nabout it? Where was he going to find a blackboard? He remembered that down the road a piece, he\nhad passed a building, which had been evacuated. And all the shades were in the windows. He\ntook these green shades down, gave them to the woman, which she used for blackboards. And he\nwent around to a supply guy in the PX and got chalk, and she was back in business, and she was\nable to teach. Well, we had to have people who could use their ingenuity in that way to make things\nout of nothing. So it was that sort of educational work that had to be done. Oh, there were all sorts\nof things. There was the big election in Frankfurt and Ufumbah (ph), where the Germans had stored\nstuff, which had been looted from the private people, from Jewish libraries and things like that. It\nwas all in there. And the job was -- not doing any good there, whatever. So arrangements had to be\nmade for moving the stuff out and distributing --\nstuff which was in the Ufumbah (ph) __\u2014_\u2014 deposit. Those are things that came up. They were\nvery helpful to people whom we were trying to serve and what contributions which the JDC could\nmake to welfare in general.",
        "Q: What about helping to rebuild religious communities?",
        "A: Well, we did that in Germany too. Well, we did that all over. We did a couple of things. In\nseveral of the countries, there weren't many rabbis, for example. The rabbis had been killed off and\nimmigrated. Yugoslavia at that time had one rabbi who was in Sarajevo. Stockholm had one rabbi,\nand he was aged. We had to do something about that. We gave scholarships to train rabbis. The\nfellow from Sweden went over to the United States, a fellow from Yugoslavia went over to Israel, a\nfellow from -- who was working in Romania, he went to Israel, to help rebuild the communities.\nTwo things: First, we had to train rabbis. And secondly, we imported rabbis on contract basis, who\nwere willing to give a year -- or a year and a half or two years, whatever it is -- to go into a county\nand do a job.",
        "Q: What about in the camps?",
        "A: In the camps? There were rabbis in the camps, who were among the internees -- is that the right\nword to use? -- in the camps itself. And if there was no rabbi, there would be people -- men, who\nwere sufficiently educated in Hebrew that they could conduct the service. And you may know, in\nthe Jewish religion you don't have to be ordained to conduct a service. A lay person can do that too.\nAnd so that was done in many of the places where there -- in the camps, where they needed a\nquasi-religious functionary to run the services. But the JDC provided funds. You probably heard a\nstory from Tetfear (ph) about a mikvah. There was a question of a mikvah, which came up in\nVohrenwald, which was a camp. A very well known, world known, Jewish rabbi ended up in\nFohrenwald, and he insisted on having a mikvah in Vohrenwald itself. There was one, but it wasn't\nkosher enough. He wanted to make his own. All right. So finally a mikvah was built for him by\nthe JDC, but then there was the question of water. You know the water has to be rain water, pure --\nit's all described in the Talmud about the water. There was no such water. JDC staff member in\nVohrenwald, he went up to the hills with a truck, and brought back a truck full of snow and melted\nthe snow, and the snow was pure, that was fit for the mikvah. So the rabbi had his mikvah and the\nwater, because our guy went up into the mountains and brought snow back, but it was pure water.\nYou had to do that sort of thing. And then in the communities themselves there was a business --\nwe had to start Sunday school classes. We imported staff from Israel to do that sort of thing with\nSunday school classes and do things for adults, who might have forgotten about their Jewish\nbackgrounds and so on. We didn't get very much money for the rebuilding of the synagogues. We\nfelt that that was a responsibility of other people to do, and we weren't so anxious to put funds into\nbricks and mortar when people didn't have [enough] to eat. You couldn't feed them bricks and so\non. And so we didn't do too much of that. But where something was mobile, anything that a person\ncould carry with them, that, we were interested in doing. Health, they could carry with them;\neducation, they could carry with them; vocational training, he could carry with them -- good for the\nJDC. But we didn't involve ourselves particularly in the rehabilitating of the graveyards. You can't\ntake that with you. And while it may have a great deal of religious significance, other people could\ndo that. Family members or people from the same town or something could do that. We had other\nthings to do with our funds. And so then I was in Germany, then, for a year with our program there.\nThen I went back to Paris and undertook other functions there. For awhile I filled in a blank in the\nimmigration department of the JDC. The immigration, that was really a tough business, because --\nas you have heard -- everybody wanted to get out. And you had people in Eastern Europe; Poland,\nRomania and Hungary, Czechoslovakia. They were all to come to Paris to wait in Paris until they\ncould get their visas. And you know the difficulties which existed in getting visas. Nobody would\nlet people in. Even to come to the United States, visas were issued in the order of priority of your\nregistration. And according to priorities in Poland, you could have waited for eight years or ten\nyears before you had ____, because it was all done on a quota basis. So everybody wanted\nto come down to Paris. Paris got all clogged up with refugees who were sitting around. Of course,\nwe had to maintain them. What were they going to live on? We had to maintain them while there\nwere in Paris. And so we had to arrange for them to be held back in the countries from whence they\ncame and sent messages back to Poland, Czechoslovakia not to let people come into Paris until they\nare called forward by us. Called forward meant that there's transportation, there's a ship. At that\ntime the ships were all clogged up. There were no passenger boats going between Europe and the\nUnited States at that time. When I say \"no,\" sure, there were -- every once in a while there would be\na boat. And there was a great deal of competition to get on those boats. So there were so many\nplaces that we could get. So we had to tell people -- keep them back where they are, keep them out\nof Paris, because the authorities in Paris were after us, to keep the influx down. And so they had to\nstay back. On one occasion we had to take a whole boat, the Shohan Newbit (ph), to send that to\nAustralia. There were so many Australian visa holders that we had to put them all on one boat and\nsend the boat down to Australia to get them down there. And so we were in the immigration\nbusiness starting -- as I told you -- until 1954. And in 1954, a couple of the agencies that were\ninvolved with immigration merged, which included the JDC too. So that took us out of the\nimmigration business and this merged organization, of which the JDC was the principal anyhow --\nat least took it out of our office and took the responsibility away from us. Another operation that we\nhad was the American Joint Reconstruction Foundation. The foundation was established during the\nwars to help in the establishment of moon (ph) cooperatives for poor people -- or people who\ncouldn't go to the bank. Banks wouldn't necessarily lend to Jews or the interest rates were so\nexorbitant. So we provided capital, got the local people to provide capital, and these cooperative\nbanks were established by the American Joint Reconstruction Foundation, which were all over the\nplace, all over Eastern Europe, had these foundations. And then of course, there were people who\ncouldn't even pay the low interest rate that was being charged by these local banks. So we opened\nup free loan societies and provided the capital for that. As I said before, anything that you touched,\nthe JDC was in there somehow or other in trying to make life more livable, to bring people back to\nnormal as quickly as possible and so on.",
        "Q: Was the primary goal to bring people back to normal, to sustain them or to get them moved out?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Which was the primary focus if there is one?",
        "A: That's a difficult one. I think it was more important to move people out, because they could be\nbrought back to normal in the country to which they were going. And I would say if one had to\nmake a choice, whether you bring people back to normal or move them out, move them out.\nAlthough it was difficult to move them out if they weren't normal. So which comes first, the\nchicken or the egg? It's a difficult one to work on, but it was done.",
        "Q: When you arrived, when you were Erolson (ph) --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- overseeing that, did the situation you found yourself in, in terms of the numbers of refugees,\nnumbers of people with great needs, did the situation seem overwhelming?",
        "A: I don't think that's a good term to use. We knew that we had a big job. If you're overwhelmed,\nyou stay home. We had a big job, but maybe the job got bigger. And you had to do it, but you\ncouldn't be overwhelmed. Maybe you were underwhelmed. You certainly couldn't be\noverwhelmed. The job might have been considered overwhelming. I think there's a nuance\nbetween the job being overwhelming and being overwhelmed by it. You know? We weren't\noverwhelmed --",
        "Q: But the job was --",
        "A: But the job was overwhelming.",
        "Q: Can you describe that a bit?",
        "A: Look, the JDC had a job to do. And there wasn't any question of weighing things, can we do it\nor can't we do it, do we have staff or don't we have staff, do we need that or don't we need that,\nwhatever. You just dug in and did it. Now, that sounds very simple, but to use a vernacular, we\nsurrounded ourselves with a group of \"can do\" people, and they did. We had to do it. There was no\nchoice.",
        "Q: Was the situation something more than you had ever encountered before?",
        "A: Of course I'd never encountered it before. Nobody had encountered in before. This was the first\ntime in history that you had a problem like this. You certainly didn't learn how to handle it in\nschool. You certainly didn't learn it in the school of social work when the people were social\nworkers. You talk with a social worker and you say listen, did your social work help? They say it\ndid not. But again, we had people who were working for us who didn't come out of the social work\nfield at all; teachers, for example. We had -- the man who ran our camp in Cyprus -- you know\nabout the Cyprus business -- he was a school teacher. He wasn't a social worker. But he had social\ninstincts. So we knew what to do. We didn't have the formal training, but he knew what to do,\nsocial work. People were the way they were -- their characteristics.",
        "Q: Do --",
        "A: Well, I wonder whether I can take a time out to go to the men's room.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Where was this Joint successful? I would say this: I think you have to look at it a little bit in\nterms of the times. What had happened to the Jewish people in Europe was really so horrible. As\nyou think about it, it's incredible. You can't even talk about it. How do you kill billions of people\njust like that? And I think that stirred up a lot of the younger people and some of the older people\ntoo, who want to do something to try to -- not make amends, because we didn't do it -- but to try to\ndo something to relieve their plight of people involved a little bit. And they were willing to put in\ntheir time and their energies to do something about it. You had to have certain characteristics of the\nindividual, I think, to begin with. It had to be people who were interested in doing things for other\npeople. And when these stories got out as to what had happened, a decent feeling, decent thinking\nyoung guy\nwould really want to do something to try to help straighten the world out a little bit. And so they\nwere willing to devote part of their time at least to making a contribution to bettering the lot of some\npeople at least. And _\u2014_s concerns on trying that outlet in the JDC and going overseas and doing\nsomething about it. And I think that probably motivated many people who came overseas to work\nwith us, and I think that that accounts for the quality and level of work which they produced for\nJDC and contributed to our success. And I think that the JDC could feel some satisfaction that it\nreally did contribute something to Jewish life. Whether it's the fellow who landed back on his feet\nin Europe or immigrated overseas, I think we did a lot to help people. They were in far away\nplaces; South America or elsewhere. JDC followed them along and did what it could to give them\nsome kind of break. I think people are entitled to a break in life, and if you can do something to\nhelp them if they didn't have a break, I think you should. And I think that motivated a lot of people\nto do what they did. And I think that accounts for JDC's success. And then when you add to that\nthe personalities in the United States, the lay people, who were behind the JDC and the thought that\nthey give to it, they're entitled to a lot of credit. They helped create the atmosphere which makes\npeople happy to do it. And that's all one's asking, . I don't think I have to add anything to\nthat. I think in words of one syllable that would account for JDC's success that there isn't much that\ncan still be done, there's always more that can be done. Lots of people, they had this tendency,\nwhen they look at the brick wall, they don't look at the bricks, they only look at the hole in the wall.\nThey don't see the accomplishments. They only see what was undone. They see the hole, they don't\nsee the bricks. Every once in a while we sit back and we look at the bricks too, and you get a\ncertain feeling of satisfaction out of doing it, doing something for somebody else, whatever. You\ndon't get wealthy at it, but the satisfaction that you get remains with you. I think that the success\nthat the JDC has had accounts for it.\nCONLUSION OF INTERVIEW\n"

        "Answer: My name is Herbert Katzki. I was born October 4, 1907 in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Most\npeople don't know where Elizabeth is, but there 1s such a place. I come from there.",
        "A: Well, let's see. I moved from Elizabeth to New York, and it was in 1917. We -- it was a\ncombination of households. I lost my father at that time, and we were going to move in with my\ngrandfather, and he passed away. And so we were there along my -- my mother with two children\nand her mother. And so we had to get along. My education was in the New York school system. I\nwent to New York University, got a degree in finance, did graduate work in economics. Went to\nschool at night, worked during the daytime, various jobs. One job, though, that I took in 1929, I\nwas working in the credit department of a mercantile firm. Working in the credit department\ndecided me on becoming a credit man. And so in school, I studied credits and collections. That\nwas the subject of my major and accounting. In 1929, though, I switched over from this particular\nfirm and went into the banking business. As part of my banking training I was going to become a\nbanker and a businessman. Went into the Manufacturers Trust Company. I started working for the\nManufacturers Company a few days before Black Friday in 1929. And I guess that probably\ninfluenced my career. Anyhow, I was with the bank until 1936. They got looking around to see\nhow things were going. Somebody suggested that I see the JDC, Joint Distribution Committee, and\nthey asked me to come in to do a special job that needed doing. And in due course I was prevailed\nupon to give them one year out of my life to do this special job. The one year out of my life turned\nout to be about 60 years. That was a very long agreement. I worked in the New York headquarters\noffice of the Joint Distribution Committee. Then until 1939 -- I was there until November. How\ncome? The war began in September. It became apparent to me as it did to others that\ncircumstances will have changed in Europe, and JDC would need all the help it could over in\nEurope. I volunteered to go overseas. I was accepted, and I went overseas. And I arrived overseas\nin December 1939. My first permanent job, we thought would be in Paris, the headquarters 1n Paris,\nwhere I served as the secretary of the European Executive Council of the JDC and did my job there.\nThe head of the overseas operations at that time was a man by the name of Morris Troper,\nT-r-o-p-e-r, who was the director general of the overseas operation of the JDC. He was joined by a\nman by the name of Schwartz, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, who came over to Europe at that time to join\nMr. Troper. Joe Schwartz landed in Italy, joined Troper, who was going to Eastern Europe, who at\nthat time was making a visit around in Europe to make plans with the agencies with which the JDC\nwas cooperating for the event that war would ensue and we would be cut off. While they were\noverseas, war did ensue. While they were traveling around in Europe, war did come along. That\nwas in June 1940. They were traveling around. The Germans were practically knocking on the\ndoor in Paris. I was in charge of the office. It was the European headquarters, I was in charge of the\noffice at the time. After making diligent inquiry, I came to the conclusion that the JDC has to move\nits office. It couldn't remain there. Having arranged with other Jewish organizations working in\nParis at the time, like ORT-HIAS, the French-Jewish organizations and so on, none of us would\nmove without advising the others. I came to the conclusion on a Sunday that we were going to\nmove out, having consulted with the American Embassy, who at that time were following up the\nFrench, who were making up their minds as to whether they wanted to get out of Paris or not and so\non. Decided to close up the office and to move out. That was on Monday -- it's Monday -- that was\non Sunday. I guess that was on June the 8th or -- if that was a Sunday. Anyhow, that Sunday\naround June, decided to close the office. Closed the office, moved -- intended originally to move to\nTours. Couldn't go to Tours because the French government had decided that they were going to\nevacuate from Paris to Tours, and they occupied the city to such an extent that nobody else would\nbe permitted to come in. In that same Sunday, when we decided to close the office, I had to phone\nthe staff to ask them to come into Monday, prepare to travel out, we're leaving Paris. They came in\nMonday to leave the office with their baggage and so on, and they went over to the railroad station.\nI came there when I -- as I began to say, in that Sunday I phoned around to tell the other agencies\nwe decided to move to discover that they had already left without telling us. And the JDC was the\nonly Jewish organization, welfare organization, in Paris, all by ourselves. Well, Dr. Schwartz and\nMr. Troper came back to Paris on Monday. The rest of the staff had left. I had kept the office open.\nThere were just one -- two secretaries, myself and -- no, three secretaries, myself and then the two\ngentlemen who came back. We closed down the -- closed down the shop on Tuesday, and the\nGermans came in on Thursday. As I said, we've started out for Tours, we couldn't get in, had to\nchange directions. We ended up in Bordeaux. We moved the JDC headquarters over to Bordeaux",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The mood in Paris was very confusing at the time, because when you walked down the Champs\nElysees, you had the impression there was absolutely nothing going on, everything looked normal.\nAnd you couldn't tell by looking around the streets that anything was happening at all. And I think\nthat up to that point the French had the feeling that their army was invincible, and they were going\nto stop off the Germans. Well, it was misplaced, as you know. So that -- we ended up, then, in\nBordeaux. We moved the office down there. We sent out the cables to all the agencies in Europe\nwith which we had been operating to tell them where our new office was in Bordeaux, to discover\nlater on that the center had held up the cables, and none of them had gone out. They were held up\nby the center, by the military people in Bordeaux. We were in Bordeaux (ph) for about four or five\ndays. Government in the meantime had moved down to Bordeaux. The Germans knew that, and\nthreatened to bomb the city. As a matter of fact, they did drop a couple of bombs around the\nrailroad station to let the French know that they're still around. And the French, then, had sat down\nand said, \"Anybody who wants to leave Bordeaux, must leave by midnight of a certain day or you\ncan't get out.\" So we were there. Troper, the couple of secretaries and I, Schwartz (ph), we were in\nBordeaux. We decided to get out. We made the midnight deadline, slept out in the fields, just to get\nout of Bordeaux. As a matter of fact, the road were so crowded at that time with refugees -- who\nwere coming down from Belgium into France, and from Northern France going down to Southern\nFrance -- that the automobile trip that normally took seven hours from Paris to Bordeaux, it took us\nthree days to get down there. The roads were that crowded with refugees. And we had hardships\nalong the road too, ran out of gasoline and shelter and all that sort of thing. So we decided then to\nget out of Bordeaux. We did that and headed for Lisbon and decided that the Lisbon was the\nfurthest west one could go in Europe to still be in European territory, and that's the place to have the\noffice. That was all right because the United States was not yet in the war. This was in -- when we\nwent to Lisbon, that was in June, July 1940. So we didn't go to the war until December [1941], so it\nwas all right for us to stay in Lisbon, and that's where we were going to make our new headquarters.\nI went back to Marseille after the armistice to see whether there was any work that the JDC could do\nwith the French-Jewish population, especially -- particularly the refugees, who were coming down\nthere from the north and from Belgium. Decided that there was work that the JDC could do, and I\nopened up the office for the JDC in Marseille for unoccupied France.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No. Starting with 1933 with the advent of Hitler, we did not send any money into Germany.\nWe had worked out an arrangement with the German Rifentrajung (ph) and the German\nHoopsverine (ph), which were the agencies in Germany with which we worked, whereby they\nwould collect to the extent that they could the cost of passage for people immigrating to the United\nStates. They would collect them in Marks, and we would buy their steamship tickets for the dollars.\nConsequently our dollars did not go into Germany, but the counter-value of local currency, which\nwas already in Germany, was made available to the agency with which we operated. So if you ask\nif we sent money in, we did not. We operated that kind of a transaction. And when Austria was\nover-- office was the anschluss, we did the same thing with Austria. And in due course we even\nworked out by financial ledgerdomain to get money into Poland. We didn't send money into Poland\neither.",
        "A: No, I went over for the -- I didn't go over as a financier. I went over as a -- as a generalist, who\nhappened to know something about finance, but that isn't why I went over. I went over, as I say, as\na generalist.",
        "A: You ask what did we do out of Lisbon. And Lisbon, since we were not in the war, and Lisbon\nwas neutral, we could still communicate with any of the agencies with which we had formally been\nin contact with, by phone or mail or whatever. But of course, by mail we would not have tried to\nget in touch -- or any other way -- with Germany, because anything that a name like Jewish, who\nwould have been -- tripped us___\u2014_\u2014sain Germany, and it wouldn't have gone through anyhow. And\nthe same thing with Austria. But with the other countries we could still work. There weren't many\ncountries left where the Germans -- of course they occupied everything. So that while we were at\nliberty to do it, we were rather restricted in what we could do.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The curious thing is this: People thought that since I was in Lisbon -- back in Lisbon in 1943 --\nthat we knew all about what was going on with the stories that were coming out from the\nconcentration camps, which later became known. We did not -- I did not know that in Lisbon. We\ndidn't have that information. The information that was coming out on that was being sent out by\nRiegner from Geneva, and it got over to the State Department through the help of the American\nMission in Berne. And they suppressed it, because they said they wanted proof that the stories that\nwere coming out were accurate, and they were going to hold up the information until they got that\nproof. Well, as you know, it took months before the story finally was released what was going on.\nBut in Lisbon, we didn't know it, because the Portuguese papers certainly didn't carry it. They didn't\nknow it either. They had no reporters running around loose, going into the camps or something. So\nwe didn't know it. And only Riegner's reports brought the information out, and they were\nsuppressed. So the information wasn't generally known. So we worked then. We stayed in contact,\nwhich was all right until December 1941, when -- everything got stopped off when we entered the\nwar, and then we were fighting with Germany and with Austria, and the Italians came in in June\n1941. And so we couldn't communicate with them and so on. We had to find other ways then for\nremaining in contact and communicating with them. We got in touch with a man in Switzerland.\nYou may have heard his name, Soudymiah (ph). His name keeps coming up. He lived in up in St.\nGallen in North Switzerland, who was president of the central Swiss welfare, Jewish welfare\norganization. And he agreed temporarily to act for the JDC in Switzerland. He finally gave up that\nposition with the Swiss agency in order to devote all his time to JDC. So he became JDC's\nrepresentative in Switzerland. And it turned out that he was our delegate for all these countries\nwhich the JDC itself as an American organization could not come in contact, which meant that he\nwas in contact with Hungary, with Romania, and even with Shanghai, with France, occupied, and so\non. And he did the things for us. Communication with Soudymiah was easy enough by telephone.\nFrom Lisbon you could talk back and forth -- you could talk to Switzerland. That was all right.\nYou just had to be careful about routing the telephone calls, because if they crossed -- going to cross\nFrance, that was Germany. Do it by ____; they were more liberal. And you could make your\ntelephone calls that way, and even send mail that way in Lisbon. So that's how we kept in touch,\nthen, with the countries with which the JDC -- which the United States ultimately was in war with.",
        "A: I went there --",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: Working out of France, that was strictly for France. The refugees who had been up in the\nnorthern part -- it turned out to be the German-occupied area -- to the extent that they could, they\ncame down to the southern part. Who were they? The ex-Germans and the ex-Austrians and the\nex- other countries with which the Germans -- the Germans were at war -- so they came down\nsouth. The Belgians came down south, so there were plenty of refugees in the unoccupied zone.\nAlso came to Marseille the agencies with which we had been working in Paris. They were\nevacuated the same as we were. They ended up in Marseille too. The office was in Marseille\nwith which we worked, they were there. The Ose -- you may have heard about them -- O-s-e.\nThat's . They were down there. The agencies with which the JDC had operated in Paris\nwere over in Marseille, so we just resumed contact with them. And we knew how they operated,\nthey knew how we operated. We were back in business again --",
        "A: -- in Marseille. The assistance which was given in the unoccupied zone was mainly a cash relief\nassistance program, because it was still possible for people to buy things in the stores and so on.\nAnd their big problem was that they had no jobs, and what they needed was some money with\nwhich to live. And the JDC provided that. The OSE was a medical assistance organization, and\nthey cared for children. So they did their job. They had misunderatret (ph) -- installations where\nchildren, unaccompanied children were. And they had a medical program. The HIAS (Hebrew\nImmigration and Sheltering) -- what the HIAS -- you know what the HIAS -- you know that?",
        "A: We just had to provide -- we just had to -- we provided them with funds so that they could\ncontinue operating in these various fields which I have just described to you. And we worked with\nwelfare organizations too. There was a Jewish welfare organization in Lyons, which was pretty\nlarge. And the other thing that we did out of Marseille was to continue sending assistance up to\nParis. Of course we had left behind in Paris there some Jewish people who remained up in Paris\nand kept the organizations going and so on. And there was a woman who was active in the\nInternational Social Service, a non-Jewish lady who used to travel back and forth between the two\nzones. And we would give her a sum of money, and she would take it up with her back to Paris.\nAnd she would bring back the reports from Paris so that we knew what was going on up there at\nleast and could follow up on their household and financing arrangements and so on. And so that's\nhow we kept in touch with Paris. And so out of Marseille we were able to keep things on some kind\nof a fairly even keel in France. That went along reasonable all right until November 1942. In\nNovember 1942, the Germans came down and occupied the unoccupied zone and so on. And then\nthings became a little bit topsy-turvy, because the Jewish refugees, they had no particular resource\nto which they could turn back on. And our office in Marseille became peripatetic, because they\ncouldn't afford being around with the Germans and ___ looking for Jewish people and so on. So\nit became peripatetic and so on. But the work continued, and during the whole war period the JDC\nprograms continued. Of course there was problems connected with it. It didn't necessarily work\nsmoothly, but to the extent possible, continued in both zones.",
        "A: When I left Germany -- when I left France, I came on home leave -- I left Marseille in the end of\nSeptember, I think, or beginning of October of 1941 for some home leave. And I was on my way\nback to Lisbon when we entered the war. My assistant, who remained in Marseille, who was\nFrench, he took over then, when I couldn't go back. It subsequently developed that this assistant\nwas active in the Jewish Army of Resistance. We didn't know it at the time -- extracurricular\nactivity. And we didn't know that until he left France and came down to Barcelona. So that if you\nask were we in contact with the resistance, sure, we were. As a matter of fact one of the things that\nwe financed in France was the -- we helped the local organization -- we didn't do it ourselves. We\ndidn't work in our own name in France. We worked through local organizations, which as you\nknow is a matter of policy of the JDC. We worked through local organizations. And one of the\norganizations with which we worked had a business of providing false documents through Jewish\npeople. As a matter of fact, I'm told -- I didn't know this until later -- I'm told that these things were\nprinted at the office of the . But they worked with our money.",
        "A: Jewish organizations, yes. They worked with our money. Most of the agencies, Jewish\nagencies, in France were working with our money. We might not have had our own personnel\nthere, but -- you see, one of the advantages that JDC has -- we have been in business for a long time.\nWe started in 1914 with this first shipment to Palestine. We learned something from the first war.\nAnd the first war was that we should do things in our own name, but to work through indigenous\norganizations. Because if we do things in our own name with our own personnel, the day we pull\nout -- and we thought we were temporary -- the day we pull out would be the day the agency would\ncollapse. The work would collapse. So we developed local organizations 1n all the countries in\nwhich we operate, and we always worked through them. And our advantages that we had that when\nthe JDC was not present, they knew enough about what the JDC -- how it operated and what its\ndesires were and so on that they were able to function __\u2014_\u2014r without our actually being there, but\nthey carried on. And that's what kept the JDC going. \"JDC\" quote, unquote had all of these\ncountries in Europe from which the JDC had no direct contact, but they knew enough about what\nthey had learned from us, which we had learned after the first World War to keep on going. And\nthere was always some embryonic JDC around in the countries of Europe that keep things going.\nAnd so that's how the work continued in France for the refugees and kept on that way, I guess, in\n1944, when our Paris office was reopened, when Paris was liberated. We went back to Paris again\non the same premises which we had, which we had closed up in June 1940, went right back into the\nsame premises.",
        "A: When did I go back to Paris?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, I went back --",
        "A: No, no. I'll tell you. So I went on home leave, as I told you, in 1941. I was on my way back to\nMarseille when we went into the war, and we were -- there was so -- little uncertainty that the\nGermans were coming down into Portugal that our New York office sent their message over to\nLisbon, all the Americans had come home. So I landed in Lisbon on Monday, and on Friday I was\non back to the States. And it took me a good couple of months before I could have permission to go\nback to Lisbon again. I was in Lisbon there until the end of 1943, when I entered the army. But my\nmilitary service was on Detached Service as a special attache (ph) to the American Embassy in\nAnkara, Turkey, which I did as an army man. And that was for the War Refugee Board, when I\nwent back to Turkey. Turkey was an area through which there could have been -- and to a certain\nextent there was -- movement of refugees to Palestine. The people who were coming out from\nHungary, from Poland would come out via Varna, which is in Bulgaria or via Constanta, which is in\nRomania. They would come out by boat down through the Black Sea as far as Istanbul and then\nover land to Palestine. I was attached to the embassy in Ankara, but I was stationed in Istanbul for\nthe War Refugee Board. And that was part of my job in connection with this movement going\nthrough. The work for the refugees in Istanbul was divided in three ways. There were three\nagencies involved. The Jewish agency was there to control -- to have something to say about people\ngoing to Palestine and issuing certificates for that purpose. There was another group of individuals\nfrom Palestine stationed in Istanbul representing the different political parties __\u2014_ that the Mossad\n-- you probably have heard. The Mossad spoken about, they were the Mossad. They were there.\nSo you had the Jewish agency doing the technical work. You had the Mossad organizing these\ntransports. The JDC was there. They did the financial work. The War Refugee Board did the\npolitical work. What was their political work? The Turks would not give transit visas to anybody.\nIn order to get through to Palestine, you had to go via Turkey. Turkey wouldn't let them through.\nWhy wouldn't they let them through? Because the British wouldn't let them into Palestine, no place\nto go. So there had to be discussions and negotiations and one thing or another with the British and\nwith the Turks. That was War Refugee Board business. And finally the Turks agreed to give a\ntransit visa to any refugee who could put his foot on Turkish soil. So the job was to get the people\nto Turkey. So they got them to Turkey. They came from Ubea (ph), which 1s an island off Greece.\nThey came across, and they landed in Ismea. They came by boat from Constanta and Varna\nthrough the Black Sea to Istanbul, and a couple of transports even came through by train to Istanbul.\nAnd since they got their foot on Turkey soil, they got transit visas -- the place agreed to let them in,\nand so they -- I don't know, about 9,000, 10,000, something like that -- got into Palestine that way\nthrough the -- it was an effort of the War Refugee Board and the political angle. When I finished\nwith the job in Turkey -- because you remember Bulgaria and Romania turned around in 1944 and\nentered the war on our side -- they didn't need the War Refugee Board anymore in Turkey. And I\nwas reassigned to the mission in Berne, Switzerland for the War Refugee Board. I was stationed in\nGeneva. What was my job there for the War Refugee Board? There was a group of Hungarians -- I\ndon't know, about three or four hundred Hungarians -- who were admitted under certain\ncircumstances, permitted to leave Budapest and ended up in Bergen-Belsen. And we tried to prevail\nupon the Swiss to let them come in to Switzerland instead of sitting up in Bergen-Belsen. And we\ngave the Swiss a guarantee that at the earliest moment, if they would let these people into\nSwitzerland, we will evacuate them. So we worked that one out, and they had these three or four\nhundred people came down from Bergen-Belsen, and they landed in Switzerland. And then it was\nmy job to get them out of Switzerland, and I had to do that through the army and field telephones,\nall kinds of things. Anyhow, they got out of Switzerland, and they went to Palestine.",
        "A: Yes. For instance, when we got them out -- the army controlled the transportation. Anything\nthat moved -- that involved transportation had to do through the army. So I would go from Geneva\ninto France, where there was an army host on their field telephone, to get through via the field\ntelephone from Annacey through Lyons, from Lyons to Paris, to talk to the transport people in Paris.\nThe transport people from Paris moved. They moved from Paris to Rehon (ph). That's where the\ntreaty was signed, the peace was signed. So then another operation I had to go through to get\nthrough Lyons -- after the armistice, they moved to Germany, and they ended up in the Archifaven\n(ph) building in Frankfurt, had to get through to Frankfurt. All this by telephone, the field telephone\nand so on. Anyhow, that's how I got them out, by working it out with the army transport that they\nwould take them, because they had to go by boat through the Mediterranean -- by land you could\nget them to Italy. They went down by train -- Italy, but they didn't control the boats. The boats, you\nhad to do that through the army. So that's how they -- how this particular group was moved out.",
        "A: Swiss trains.",
        "A: This was in 19 -- 1945. I would say about July or August 1945.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, then when the war was over, I got out of the army. When I got out of the army, that\nreleased me from the War Refugee Board. So that ended up the War Refugee Board job, which I\ntold you started in February 1944, and it landed until I got out of the army in October 1945. That\nfinished me with the War Refugee Board, that finished me with the army. I went back to the JDC. I\nwent back overseas again.",
        "A: What with the War Refugee Boards? We had -- there were exactly four people in this dembo\n(ph) in Turkey. It was Ira Hirschman (ph), who was the chief of mission. There was myself, two\nsecretaries. That was the whole War Refugee Board in Turkey. And we worked through everybody\nelse, through the Jewish agency, with the Joint (ph), everybody we worked through. But that was\nour job.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. The War Refugee Board consisted of three people with the secretaries, the treasury,\nwhich was Morgenthau. There was Secretary Stimson. I think he was war. And I think Hull was\nSecretary of State. Anyhow, there were three Secretaries of State with the War Refugee Board\nresponsible directly to the President. So we were in that channel with the War Refugee Board. That\nwas our contact, that was the backing that we had. And then in consequence of that, we were\npractically unique, because we had permission to deal with the enemy that was going to be of any\nway to help the refugees. So we were entitled -- normally American citizens could do that. We\nwere authorized to deal with the enemy in order to do what we had to do to rescue people. The War\nRefugee Board, they had a representative in Stockholm. That was Iva Olsen (ph), who had worked\nout the deal with Raul Wallenberg, who ended up in Budapest. You've heard of Raul Wallenberg.\nThe War Refugee Board had a representative in Lisbon, they had one in London. That was about it.",
        "A: We did the work -- what?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The War Ref-- well, as far as we were concerned, out in the field, our contact was the\nheadquarters of the War Refugee Board in Washington. Let them worry what they're going -- but\nthey were helpful, because we had the three Secretaries of State, and so they were helpful. We got\nhelp from the OWI and others. We had to have that kind of -- had to have that kind of help, because\nwe were only a facilitating group to get things done. We were dependent on other people. One of\nthe big problems of the War Refugee Board was that the government gave them no money. The\ngovernment gave them money, only enough to cover their administration expenses. And the other\nrequirements of the War Refugee Board was paid by the Joint. You find the Joint all over the place.\nWe were paid by JDC. For instance, example, Raul Wallenberg -- you know what he did in\nBudapest with our money. JDC was our money. JDC was helping me, War Refugee Board. I was\nwearing that hat at that ttme. But the JDC was all over the place. They were very helpful. In any\nevent, then I went back overseas, then, to JDC. And when I went back overseas, then, I went to the\nParis office, because the Arab -- the Paris office had in the meantime then retransferred to Lisbon\nback to Paris after it was possible for us to go back up there. I got back to Paris in December '45,\nwas there for a couple of weeks when I had to go into Germany to relieve Jake Trobe (ph). I think I\ntold you about that inside before. Jake Trobe (ph), who was in charge of our office -- our operation\n-- in Germany, he got mixed up with this -- the General Morgan incident -- and he was withdrawn.\nAnd I went in to take over the German operation from him. That's what got me up to Erolson (ph),\nand got me --",
        "A: Well, I got back to Paris in December 1945. I would like to make a break to tell you something\nelse. In 1943 when I went back to Lisbon, after a great deal of effort the United States finally\nagreed to accept 5,000 -- 5,000, it was 10,000 -- Jewish refugee children in the United States for\nsafekeeping during the war, the same way as they had permitted the English to come over here.\nYou remember when the English came in. They agreed to take them into the United States. And\none of the things I was supposed to do when I went back to Lisbon was do some work with this\nproject. I went back with another JDC member, the name is Soeboe (ph). And there was an\nAmerican agency involved in that, German-Jewish Children Agency, I think it was. So then we\nwent up to -- the effort was made with the French to give exit permits to the people to leave France\nwho had come out from the unoccupied zone, leave France -- former unoccupied zone. Laval\nrefused it. And Laval wouldn't let them out, and so the thing fell through. So they couldn't get the\nkids out. And the kids that we did bring out were kids who were already out, either in Spain or in\nPortugal or those children who with their parents were smuggled over the border from France into\nSpain, so acquired a couple of kids. Instead of having the 5,000, we only got about 2-, 300. That's\nall, because Laval put his foot down on it. So that's one effort we made with the refugee -- to help\nrefugees, and discovered then it didn't pan out. So then I went back to Paris, then, and took over\nthere from Jake Trobe (ph) in Germany. And in order to get back into Germany -- they ran a very\ntight operation. The army, of course, was responsible; the American army for the American zone,\nthe British army for the British zone, et cetera. And they were responsible for everything that went\non in their particular zones. Responsibility for the American army in the American zone, keep\npeace and quiet and so on. And while technically they were responsible for the welfare of the\npeople in the zone which they occupied, they said in effect, \"We're soldiers, we're not welfare\nworkers.\" And they gave the job to the UNRRA as a subcontractor, so to speak, to provide care for\nthe refugees and the displaced persons who were in Germany.",
        "A: Yeah, I went in November -- December '45, yeah. I left in November, yeah. And then went\nback to Paris in 1945. I was in Paris for a couple of weeks, and then were sent up to Germany to\ntake over from Jake Trobe (ph), who was reassigned. How do you get into Germany? Army had\nsubcontracted to UNRRA to provide basic care and maintenance for the refugees. The JDC was --\nin order to get in, we had to come in under the umbrella, then, of UNRRA. And UNRRA\u2019s\nheadquarters at that time were in Herxt (ph), which is outside of Frankfurt in Germany. A couple of\nweeks after I arrived in Herxt (ph) then, UNRRA\u2019s entire headquarters operation was sent up to\nErolson (ph) and so on. Since I was at JDC headquarters -- and at JDC headquarters, I was attached\nto UNRRA\u2019s headquarters -- the office had to move up to Erolson (ph) too, so that the headquarters\nfor the operation in Germany was in Erolson (ph). Headquarters for the American zone was in\nMunich. Headquarters for the British zone was in Bergen-Belsen. Berlin was Berlin, and the\nFrench zone was in -- oh, shoot -- I forget the name -- around Constance someplace. I don't\nremember the name. Anyhow, and so the work that I did in Germany was to travel around the\noffices to try to things going along smoothly. The JDC -- I mentioned this before, I guess -- ran a\nrather decentralized operation. The JDC proceeded on the ferry to trust the men in the field, where\nthe men were sent out to the field and certainly given the responsibility for maintaining a\ncountry-wide operation. He was carefully selected, because he had to make decisions on the spot,\ncouldn't go to Paris every time. He had to make a decision. Times were changing too quickly, and\nParis couldn't know the local conditions as well as the men on the spot. He had to make the\narrangements. So I traveled around the various offices, try to keep in touch, if I could help them\nwith some kind of guidance, you know, how their programs were going and so on. And I did that\nfor about a year, when we decided to decentralize further. Hence, having a central office for\nGermany, we had the zones, Munich, Belsen; report directly to Paris. And we eliminated the\noverall office for Germany itself. Berlin, I think, at that time headed into Munich. And that was an\noperation which we did for the refugees, for the displaced persons. And did our work, whatever it\nwas, to feed the people, to clothe the people. Actually, the UNRRA, they had the responsibility,\nthen, for the basic feeding of these people, which the army had subcontracted to them. But that was\nthe limit of their responsibility, to keep the people alive, to give them some medical help, to give\nthem shelter, give them some clothing. But there was a plethora of assistance, which the people\nrequired, which UNRRA didn't give them. There were questions of education and entertainment --\ngood Lord, anything that you could think of, UNRRA didn't do it. In addition to that, the food\nrations, which the refugees got -- the displaced persons got -- was so very low, and the diets were so\nmonotonous and so on. So the JDC, to put it very crudely, put the fringe on the embroidery. We\nprovided all these extra amenities that were supposed to make life more bearable for these people,\nwhich were terms of educations and lectures. And we had traveling entertainers and legal aid and\neverything that was required __..._It wasn't a job, we had to do it. So that was the JDC's job for\nall these people. That included immigration assistance too. How did we get into the immigration\nbusiness? I was on the telephone up in Erolson (ph), and I got a telephone call from Dr. Schwartz,\nwho was the head of the whole overseas operation -- telephoned the -- from Paris to ask me to get in\ntouch with our representatives in Stuttgart, that she should help a certain woman to immigrate --\nsome problem and some papers or something. And so I said to Dr. Schwartz, \"Why come to us?\nWe're not in the immigration business.\" And Dr. Schwartz said to me yes, we are, beginning now.\nAnd that was of the immigration business.",
        "A: That was in '46. We had been in the immigration business before that. When we were in\nLisbon, there was these people who were coming down from Germany and Austria and other\ncountries. Now, the HIAS was operating in Lisbon too at that time. But the HIAS, they operated\nwith individual cases. If a relative in New York or Kenosha, Wisconsin came to them and said I\nhave a relative, so and so, can you help them get out. And the HIAS would say give us the money\nfor the transportation, et cetera, et cetera. And then they would work on the case. We couldn't\nafford that luxury. We were in the wholesale business, because as I explained to you before, the\nHoofsverine (ph) and the Rifeserine (ph) and so on in Germany sent all their cases down to us,\nbecause we were paying their transportation as I explained. So consequently, we would have to buy\nall the passages on a ship in order to make room for these people who were coming down. So while\nthe HIAS, they were in the retail business, we were in the wholesale business. But we were in the\nwholesale business because Lisbon was the only port in Europe for which people could sail. All the\nother ports were occupied by the Germans -- or I take that back. Spain had some ports too that\nwere open. But Lisbon was the main port.\nTape 2",
        "A: Yeah, we were in the wholesale business.",
        "A: Yeah, so we -- when I said Dr. Schwartz said we are now in the immigration business, we were\nin it before, but on a different level.",
        "A: Did JDC give?",
        "A: To characterize the work that we do, we do everything from prenatal care to care for the aged.\nWe don't quite bury them, but everything in between we do, with the prenatal care and postnatal\ncare, kindergartens, educations -- public level education. Ted mentioned to you about the\nscholarship for the university students. The work that we're doing now in addition to care for the\naged -- in Israel, for example, we have training programs for principals of the ministries and\nmunicipalities to try to give them some notions as to how they might improve the services that they\ngive.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Well, with the -- well, that was about the work that could be done in Germany from\nthe cradle to the grave, but you know, the people who survived what they had gone through, I think\nthat there was a principle of natural selection that was involved, and the people who came through,\nmanaged to come through. So that what we had to do did not have to be ground down so finely.\nThe broader, simpler things we didn't have to do. So many of the things that we would do in a\ncountry, as I say -- like Israel which is much further advanced. So that's what we did in Israel, was\nsupply -- we had this big supply program going --",
        "A: I'm back in Europe again, yeah.",
        "A: With the supply program, what we did. We had a representative up in Stockholm. We had a\nrepresentative up in Copenhagen and another one in Oslo. And at least one could buy food and\nother things in Sweden, which were not available on the = \u2014.~ And so we bought food up there.\nWe bought dairy products in Copenhagen and whatever, and we loaded trucks and sent them down\nthrough. Some stopped off in Belsen. Others went to Berlin. They went over as far as Bublee (ph)\nwith the food stuff. They went through Krogg (ph), and we left food, which we had acquired in\nStockholm and so on. When the supply line from the United States wasn't open, we had to be\ncontent with what we could get up in the Scandinavian countries. And that went along all right,\nexcepting that there wasn't enough of it, but we couldn't give anymore than we got in, than we could\nacquire and so on. What else did we do? For the education side we had to print our own books.\nWe had an education -- he was principal of a school up in, I think, in Newton, Massachusetts. He\nwas principal of the school. He to come over to the JDC to go overseas as our education\nguy. So he was traveling around in Germany, stopped at one of the camps, spoke to one of the\nladies who was trying to do some educational work, a teacher. And she told him what a problem\nshe was having. She didn't have a blackboard, she didn't have any chalk, nothing. What did he do\nabout it? Where was he going to find a blackboard? He remembered that down the road a piece, he\nhad passed a building, which had been evacuated. And all the shades were in the windows. He\ntook these green shades down, gave them to the woman, which she used for blackboards. And he\nwent around to a supply guy in the PX and got chalk, and she was back in business, and she was\nable to teach. Well, we had to have people who could use their ingenuity in that way to make things\nout of nothing. So it was that sort of educational work that had to be done. Oh, there were all sorts\nof things. There was the big election in Frankfurt and Ufumbah (ph), where the Germans had stored\nstuff, which had been looted from the private people, from Jewish libraries and things like that. It\nwas all in there. And the job was -- not doing any good there, whatever. So arrangements had to be\nmade for moving the stuff out and distributing --\nstuff which was in the Ufumbah (ph) __\u2014_\u2014 deposit. Those are things that came up. They were\nvery helpful to people whom we were trying to serve and what contributions which the JDC could\nmake to welfare in general.",
        "A: Well, we did that in Germany too. Well, we did that all over. We did a couple of things. In\nseveral of the countries, there weren't many rabbis, for example. The rabbis had been killed off and\nimmigrated. Yugoslavia at that time had one rabbi who was in Sarajevo. Stockholm had one rabbi,\nand he was aged. We had to do something about that. We gave scholarships to train rabbis. The\nfellow from Sweden went over to the United States, a fellow from Yugoslavia went over to Israel, a\nfellow from -- who was working in Romania, he went to Israel, to help rebuild the communities.\nTwo things: First, we had to train rabbis. And secondly, we imported rabbis on contract basis, who\nwere willing to give a year -- or a year and a half or two years, whatever it is -- to go into a county\nand do a job.",
        "A: In the camps? There were rabbis in the camps, who were among the internees -- is that the right\nword to use? -- in the camps itself. And if there was no rabbi, there would be people -- men, who\nwere sufficiently educated in Hebrew that they could conduct the service. And you may know, in\nthe Jewish religion you don't have to be ordained to conduct a service. A lay person can do that too.\nAnd so that was done in many of the places where there -- in the camps, where they needed a\nquasi-religious functionary to run the services. But the JDC provided funds. You probably heard a\nstory from Tetfear (ph) about a mikvah. There was a question of a mikvah, which came up in\nVohrenwald, which was a camp. A very well known, world known, Jewish rabbi ended up in\nFohrenwald, and he insisted on having a mikvah in Vohrenwald itself. There was one, but it wasn't\nkosher enough. He wanted to make his own. All right. So finally a mikvah was built for him by\nthe JDC, but then there was the question of water. You know the water has to be rain water, pure --\nit's all described in the Talmud about the water. There was no such water. JDC staff member in\nVohrenwald, he went up to the hills with a truck, and brought back a truck full of snow and melted\nthe snow, and the snow was pure, that was fit for the mikvah. So the rabbi had his mikvah and the\nwater, because our guy went up into the mountains and brought snow back, but it was pure water.\nYou had to do that sort of thing. And then in the communities themselves there was a business --\nwe had to start Sunday school classes. We imported staff from Israel to do that sort of thing with\nSunday school classes and do things for adults, who might have forgotten about their Jewish\nbackgrounds and so on. We didn't get very much money for the rebuilding of the synagogues. We\nfelt that that was a responsibility of other people to do, and we weren't so anxious to put funds into\nbricks and mortar when people didn't have [enough] to eat. You couldn't feed them bricks and so\non. And so we didn't do too much of that. But where something was mobile, anything that a person\ncould carry with them, that, we were interested in doing. Health, they could carry with them;\neducation, they could carry with them; vocational training, he could carry with them -- good for the\nJDC. But we didn't involve ourselves particularly in the rehabilitating of the graveyards. You can't\ntake that with you. And while it may have a great deal of religious significance, other people could\ndo that. Family members or people from the same town or something could do that. We had other\nthings to do with our funds. And so then I was in Germany, then, for a year with our program there.\nThen I went back to Paris and undertook other functions there. For awhile I filled in a blank in the\nimmigration department of the JDC. The immigration, that was really a tough business, because --\nas you have heard -- everybody wanted to get out. And you had people in Eastern Europe; Poland,\nRomania and Hungary, Czechoslovakia. They were all to come to Paris to wait in Paris until they\ncould get their visas. And you know the difficulties which existed in getting visas. Nobody would\nlet people in. Even to come to the United States, visas were issued in the order of priority of your\nregistration. And according to priorities in Poland, you could have waited for eight years or ten\nyears before you had ____, because it was all done on a quota basis. So everybody wanted\nto come down to Paris. Paris got all clogged up with refugees who were sitting around. Of course,\nwe had to maintain them. What were they going to live on? We had to maintain them while there\nwere in Paris. And so we had to arrange for them to be held back in the countries from whence they\ncame and sent messages back to Poland, Czechoslovakia not to let people come into Paris until they\nare called forward by us. Called forward meant that there's transportation, there's a ship. At that\ntime the ships were all clogged up. There were no passenger boats going between Europe and the\nUnited States at that time. When I say \"no,\" sure, there were -- every once in a while there would be\na boat. And there was a great deal of competition to get on those boats. So there were so many\nplaces that we could get. So we had to tell people -- keep them back where they are, keep them out\nof Paris, because the authorities in Paris were after us, to keep the influx down. And so they had to\nstay back. On one occasion we had to take a whole boat, the Shohan Newbit (ph), to send that to\nAustralia. There were so many Australian visa holders that we had to put them all on one boat and\nsend the boat down to Australia to get them down there. And so we were in the immigration\nbusiness starting -- as I told you -- until 1954. And in 1954, a couple of the agencies that were\ninvolved with immigration merged, which included the JDC too. So that took us out of the\nimmigration business and this merged organization, of which the JDC was the principal anyhow --\nat least took it out of our office and took the responsibility away from us. Another operation that we\nhad was the American Joint Reconstruction Foundation. The foundation was established during the\nwars to help in the establishment of moon (ph) cooperatives for poor people -- or people who\ncouldn't go to the bank. Banks wouldn't necessarily lend to Jews or the interest rates were so\nexorbitant. So we provided capital, got the local people to provide capital, and these cooperative\nbanks were established by the American Joint Reconstruction Foundation, which were all over the\nplace, all over Eastern Europe, had these foundations. And then of course, there were people who\ncouldn't even pay the low interest rate that was being charged by these local banks. So we opened\nup free loan societies and provided the capital for that. As I said before, anything that you touched,\nthe JDC was in there somehow or other in trying to make life more livable, to bring people back to\nnormal as quickly as possible and so on.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That's a difficult one. I think it was more important to move people out, because they could be\nbrought back to normal in the country to which they were going. And I would say if one had to\nmake a choice, whether you bring people back to normal or move them out, move them out.\nAlthough it was difficult to move them out if they weren't normal. So which comes first, the\nchicken or the egg? It's a difficult one to work on, but it was done.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don't think that's a good term to use. We knew that we had a big job. If you're overwhelmed,\nyou stay home. We had a big job, but maybe the job got bigger. And you had to do it, but you\ncouldn't be overwhelmed. Maybe you were underwhelmed. You certainly couldn't be\noverwhelmed. The job might have been considered overwhelming. I think there's a nuance\nbetween the job being overwhelming and being overwhelmed by it. You know? We weren't\noverwhelmed --",
        "A: But the job was overwhelming.",
        "A: Look, the JDC had a job to do. And there wasn't any question of weighing things, can we do it\nor can't we do it, do we have staff or don't we have staff, do we need that or don't we need that,\nwhatever. You just dug in and did it. Now, that sounds very simple, but to use a vernacular, we\nsurrounded ourselves with a group of \"can do\" people, and they did. We had to do it. There was no\nchoice.",
        "A: Of course I'd never encountered it before. Nobody had encountered in before. This was the first\ntime in history that you had a problem like this. You certainly didn't learn how to handle it in\nschool. You certainly didn't learn it in the school of social work when the people were social\nworkers. You talk with a social worker and you say listen, did your social work help? They say it\ndid not. But again, we had people who were working for us who didn't come out of the social work\nfield at all; teachers, for example. We had -- the man who ran our camp in Cyprus -- you know\nabout the Cyprus business -- he was a school teacher. He wasn't a social worker. But he had social\ninstincts. So we knew what to do. We didn't have the formal training, but he knew what to do,\nsocial work. People were the way they were -- their characteristics.",
        "A: Well, I wonder whether I can take a time out to go to the men's room.",
        "A: Where was this Joint successful? I would say this: I think you have to look at it a little bit in\nterms of the times. What had happened to the Jewish people in Europe was really so horrible. As\nyou think about it, it's incredible. You can't even talk about it. How do you kill billions of people\njust like that? And I think that stirred up a lot of the younger people and some of the older people\ntoo, who want to do something to try to -- not make amends, because we didn't do it -- but to try to\ndo something to relieve their plight of people involved a little bit. And they were willing to put in\ntheir time and their energies to do something about it. You had to have certain characteristics of the\nindividual, I think, to begin with. It had to be people who were interested in doing things for other\npeople. And when these stories got out as to what had happened, a decent feeling, decent thinking\nyoung guy\nwould really want to do something to try to help straighten the world out a little bit. And so they\nwere willing to devote part of their time at least to making a contribution to bettering the lot of some\npeople at least. And _\u2014_s concerns on trying that outlet in the JDC and going overseas and doing\nsomething about it. And I think that probably motivated many people who came overseas to work\nwith us, and I think that that accounts for the quality and level of work which they produced for\nJDC and contributed to our success. And I think that the JDC could feel some satisfaction that it\nreally did contribute something to Jewish life. Whether it's the fellow who landed back on his feet\nin Europe or immigrated overseas, I think we did a lot to help people. They were in far away\nplaces; South America or elsewhere. JDC followed them along and did what it could to give them\nsome kind of break. I think people are entitled to a break in life, and if you can do something to\nhelp them if they didn't have a break, I think you should. And I think that motivated a lot of people\nto do what they did. And I think that accounts for JDC's success. And then when you add to that\nthe personalities in the United States, the lay people, who were behind the JDC and the thought that\nthey give to it, they're entitled to a lot of credit. They helped create the atmosphere which makes\npeople happy to do it. And that's all one's asking, . I don't think I have to add anything to\nthat. I think in words of one syllable that would account for JDC's success that there isn't much that\ncan still be done, there's always more that can be done. Lots of people, they had this tendency,\nwhen they look at the brick wall, they don't look at the bricks, they only look at the hole in the wall.\nThey don't see the accomplishments. They only see what was undone. They see the hole, they don't\nsee the bricks. Every once in a while we sit back and we look at the bricks too, and you get a\ncertain feeling of satisfaction out of doing it, doing something for somebody else, whatever. You\ndon't get wealthy at it, but the satisfaction that you get remains with you. I think that the success\nthat the JDC has had accounts for it.\nCONLUSION OF INTERVIEW\n"
