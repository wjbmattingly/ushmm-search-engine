Did\nyou ever hear of Abraham and Sarah?Sarah, when she was young, she couldn't\nhave any children. She was crying and begging.

Because as a son\nyou gave him to me, so he's my son and to you he's just a boy.Do you\nunderstand? So what did God do? He gave him -- he gave him a animal, a kosher\nanimal. There -- this animal couldn't walk any farther because _ stopped it. And he\ntook Avram and killed the animal. He gave it to God instead Yitzchok, and\nYitzchok was already God's son.

The\ntrain took us to Poland and we were afraid already because they wanted to kill us.\nThey lost the war because the Germans took a part and this took apart, but they\nwanted to kill us, the Jews. Coming there we had some gold still left over. Yeah,\nI forgot to tell you how did we live in the woods. We had some golden\nvouchers, golden rings, diamonds.

        "A: We couldn't stay in Poland, no. We left our house and everything. We went\nto Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia, they send us to Austria. One thing what I\nwant to tell you. In Austria, the Germans -- and I could go where 20 or 50 Germans\nwere together and they just said hello to me, and the Pollocks wanted to kill us.\nGermans are people. Like soldiers, if you tell them to kill, they will kill. After\nthis, they are normal people. So we did live in Austria. In AustriaI went Graz.\nDid you ever hear of Graz? In Graz I went two years to university to learn\nmedicine.",

In the cohouse(ph), in\nthere, the head of the cohouse(ph) didn't know how to write. Whoever came\nthere, they came to me and [had to give him a thing. So there in the woods I was\nalso one of the bestcutters there and I was respected. So that what it was. Why?\nBecause He help me. I'll tell you something, when God_ -- I don't know, but always\nI did believe in God. Especially when they say it was one God, one God. So I do\nbelieve this God, He did create the world and He did create our world. He did\ncreate us. Now you will ask me, \"How did he create us?\" I'll tell you how. Did\nyou ever hear of Abraham and Sarah?Sarah, when she was young, she couldn't\nhave any children. She was crying and begging. But when she was 90-years\nold, when she could not have children, then God gave herthat she had one son,\nYitzchok. So Yitzchok was the creation. Because by 90 years she couldn't have\nit. He was a creation. Now, what happened to Yitzchok? After being 37 years old\nGod told Abraham to take Yitzchok and give to God as a qurban. You know what\nmeans a qurban?",

He lift up this knife and said to God, \"Now you have\nhim.\" God stopped him and said, \"No, I don't want him to be killed.\" He didn't\nsay, \"Don't touch your son,\" but \"Don't touch this boy.\" Why? Because as a son\nyou gave him to me, so he's my son and to you he's just a boy.Do you\nunderstand? So what did God do? He gave him -- he gave him a animal, a kosher\nanimal. There -- this animal couldn't walk any farther because _ stopped it. And he\ntook Avram and killed the animal. He gave it to God instead Yitzchok, and\nYitzchok was already God's son. This way we are children of Yitzchok, and this\nis our God. That'swhy I believe in God. You understand what I'm talking about?\nNow, we had Arvam, Yitzchok and Jacob. They are our forefathers. And we\nhave foremothers, and they did have their children and this way God did create\nour nation. Now, if you'll ask me why did God need us? You know how? Because\ndid you ever hear of Noah?

And that's what did happen.So seems to\nbe that the Jews did not behave right to God and that's why he did punish us\nwith that thing. It was a punishment. And then he says: After this punishment\nI'll remember you will (?lend?) Israel.\"'ll remember.\" Not \"I'll give you back\nthe whole of Israel,\" but a part of it. And that's what he did.
