And every morning the Catholics had to get up and we were\nstanding there. We had to stand up, bare headed and they had to say the prayer, the Polish prayer.\nBut we did not, could not participate because we were Jewish.

I was beaten up for doing nothing. You just beat me up for no\nreason. And you know what she answered me. He didn\u2019t kill you, did he? That was the answer of\nthe principal from a public school in Poland. So you ask me if I knew anti-Semitism. I was a\nyoungster, a baby yet.\nNow let me tell you another experience. My father went to the factory and I was with him sitting\nin the factory, on a horse and a wagon and the next thing is, as we, first we came out of the\nfactory, another farmer passed by with a horse and wagon with a whip.

But absolutely no, no what you call the\nlove they had for the Jews. As far as the Polack goes, they did not change and I tell you an\nexperience, what happened to me in the year 2000 when I went to Poland and I wanted my\nfamily, my sister and my niece and my nephew and my niece they wanted to see where their\nparents were born. Because they were not alive anymore. My sisters. So what happened? We\ntook a trip to Poland and I speak Polish, of course. And as we came to Poland, they wanted to\nsee the apartment that we lived in. So sure enough I come into the apartment. I brought a box of\ncandy. I figured I want to be nice and polite. And I knocked on the door. The place we lived in.\nand the next thing is, a woman opened up the door and it was a small room. And I said where 1s\nthe apartment? They said they divided the apartment in two. The other half is on the other side.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nOk so I wanted to show the bigger apartment because this was one big apartment. So sure\nenough, I knock on the door of the other apartment. The woman opens up the door. The husband\na big bull with a moustache stands in the back and he says, shows with the hand, no, no. You\ncan\u2019t come in here. And I says to the woman, look here. We came 3000 miles. All Ido. I don\u2019t\nwant your apartment. All I came here to show my niece, my nephew, where they live, what and\nmy sons, my sons were with me too. To show where I was born and where their mothers was\nborn. No way. He\u2019s not, not me into the apartment and I took that and I said look here. I didn\u2019t\ncome for the apartment. I didn\u2019t want to argument because I was afraid. He could take a knife\nand stab me and kill me so I walked away. So just wanted to show you how they did not change,\nno matter how publicity and how tried, still and all they\u2019re still the same Polacks they were. One\nvice -- one prime minister in Israel said they minute they were born, they soaked in anti-\nSemitism in their mother\u2019s milk.",

        "A: Where? After the war?",
        "Q: No, no, no. We\u2019re talking about before the war, while you were experiencing this \u2014",
        "A: Of course. I tell you. The thing is we had market days twice a week, Mondays and Thursdays.\nAnd a lot of farmers came in with their eggs and cheeses and chickens and goose and so on to\nsell. And of course the market was in the middle of the center of town, Mondays and Thursdays.\nThey all came and the Jewish mothers came in for the sabbath. They bought chickens, they\nbought the eggs and they bought everything else. Now the Jewish people had stores around town\nand I guess all kind of stores, like suits and clothes and materials and so on and so on. So the\nPolacks, the farmers, they had the money and they figured they had nothing in their farms. They\ngo into the Jewish stores and they buy what you call it, the clothes and they make themselves\nclothes and they buy shoes and so and so on. The anti-Semites were standing right and outside\nthe stores. They saw the Polacks coming out with packages from the store and says go back to\nthe store. Tell the Jew to give you the money back.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",

        "Q: Were your parents Zionists at that time?",
        "A: My father was a Zionist yes. My sister too. And let me tell you another -- you\u2019re talking about\nanti-Semitism. Every time there was Easter time, Christmas time, we used -- my father used to\ntake me to shul three times a day. Mornings and nights. So what happened was that they\nannounce in the synagogue before Easter and before Christmas, Jews don\u2019t go out in the streets.\nEaster is coming up. They have a special day; so is Christmas. They all come out from the\nchurches with the Madonnas, with the pictures and the Marys and they walk down the streets and\nthere will be riots. So the Jews had to stand out, stay out of the streets and stay home. Because\nthey were afraid they should not attack the Jews. So just shows you what Poland was like before\nthe war. And this is my experience as a child.",
        "Q: Did you go to Hebrew school?",

After every single day except Saturday. And on Saturday my\nfather used to send me to his uncle\u2019s and to his relatives to find out what I learned during the\nweek And they questioned me about different kind of subjects if I remember. And this I get a\nreward, a piece of cake, a piece of chocolate, some candy. This was the reward I got.",

        "Q: You were at school and now what happened when, in September 39. What do you remember\nabout that?",
        "A: September 39 was like this here. The anti-Semitism was so great that people expect and knew\na war 1s coming up because they were talking about it, they were talking about it and everybody,\nJews already were so depressed because the economy was so bad, they squeezed the Jew out.\nThey forbid already Jewish slaughter. They forbid already a Jewish students to go to school. To\ngymnasium and so on. Anti-Semitism in the army was terrible. My brother in law he was, there\nwas compulsory service in the armed forces in Poland. And you \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",

So what\u2019s happened is, my brother in law he was 21 years old and people\nat 18 or 20 they had to register with the authorities and they were what you call a drafted. He was\nAl, he was drafted. And they took him into the army. It just so happened that my brother in law\nwas a very bright young man, very smart and very in. And they\u2019re looking for officers to put\nthem up in the arms. So sure enough he came in before a board, and they asked him what is your\nreligion? And he said the religion of Moses. The minute they found out the religion of Moses\nthey rejected him. He could not become an officer in the Polish army. Ok I just want you to give\nthe details til what happened before the war.\nNow before the war, it was a terrible situation. People did not know what to expect. They wanted\nalready to have a war because in 1914 the war was on civilian people were safe. They sent them\naway, mothers and children and so on and so on. The people thought that this is going to be the\nsame thing like it was. We did not know what goes on in Germany. So \u2014",
        "Q: When did you first hear of a man named Hitler? Had you heard of him before September?",
        "A: We did, we did because we did hear about it but didn\u2019t know what goes on because there was\nno such thing as propaganda of any kind to hear what goes on. Poland kept on saying we are\nstrong. We don\u2019t get, even in the border we, he wouldn\u2019t give up. You are fight to the length\nand so on, so on. It didn\u2019t happen because they collapsed in no time at all. So what happened\nwas when the war broke out, I told you. My cousin, my first cousin, was bombed. By the way,\nmy father, I was sleeping at my grandmother\u2019s apartment because she had a bigger apartment\ntoo, and were four in the house, so I slept in my grandmother\u2019s apartment. She lived on the same\nbuilding the same floor. So what happened is, 4:00 in the morning, my father wakes me up.\nSeptember 1, 1939. He says you better get up because we have to go to the basement because the\nwar just broke out. Ok, got me up. And the next thing is we went down to the basement to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nshelter. And the next thing is after the alarm was off you know and so on, we went down the\nstreet. As we went down the street, I did meet my cousin. We were talking and so on, and so on.\nSo we all, after a while alarm came on again. I was running to my home and he was running to\nhis home. Sure enough a bomb dropped in front of his house, where the soldiers were stationed\nin the school. It was across the street from my cousin\u2019s house and they bomb hit it and he was\nwounded and he died on the spot and they took him away. It was my first experience what\nhappened.",

        "A: Then what happened. Then it was like this here. The city was in panic because we didn\u2019t\nknow when the Nazis are come, when the Germans are coming in. We didn\u2019t know what to do so\nwhat happened. Everybody was trying to run away. We didn\u2019t know where to run. We figured\nwe go to a bigger city which was Krakow, which was about two miles, about two hours away\nfrom us. So my sister was very energetic. She goes down to the street. She sees a big truck and\nshe asked the truck driver if he would like to take us to Krakow. And the truck driver agreed for\npayment.",

        "Q: Ok so she asked the driver.",
        "A: So she asked the Polish driver if he would take us to Krakow. He says by all means. So sure\nenough he came in the front of the house and we picked up whatever we could. And we went\nout to the truck. We took our neighbors with us. And our neighbor was also sitting there. And\nthe next thing is as we would go down, the Polack couldn\u2019t wait already for us to leave. So they\ncan come in and clean up and everything what was left over there. Even the nails shouldn\u2019t stay.\nAnd the next thing is, we looked around. There was absolutely no police. And no military Polish\npolice on, what do you call it, no police. No protection whatsoever. We were afraid even the\nPolacks themselves shouldn\u2019t kill us. So what happened. We took off by truck. We all were\nloaded up. And our neighbor and even people couldn\u2019t walk. They threw away the walking and\nthey are running. To, out of town because they knew that otherwise they will be in problems.\nAnd sure enough we kept on going. By the time we went, every time people piled up on the\ntruck. By the time we hit Krakow the truck would hardly move. It was loaded with people and\nfinally we did come to Krakow. We came to Krakow, we figure that in Krakow there will be no\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nGermans. Sure enough, the patrols were already walking in Krakow. And my father and my\nmother had what you call it relatives in Krakow. So we were staying in my grandmother, great\ngrandmother\u2019s house when we came into Krakow. As we came into Krakow, the patrols, the\nGerman patrols were walking the streets. So my sister, my sister Arusha, the one I talked about\nwanted to see what goes on. So she opens up the curtain and as she opened up the curtain, one of\nthe Germans a sharp shooter, shoot her through the window and missed her by millimeters. She\nwould have been dead on the spot, missed her by just by a second. And she, that\u2019s how she \u2014\nnow after we came into Krakow, my sister was standing there and she didn\u2019t want to go back to\nOswiecim because we were staying there for a while and after a while my mother said let\u2019s go\nback to OSwiecim so we went all back. As we went back, my sister was blond and blue eyed so\nshe was acting like a, she wanted to be like a Polish girl to survive. So what did she do? She\nchanged her name to Wanda, a Polish name. So sure enough we went back and she remained in\nPoland, in Krakow. And meantime we were in Oswiecim. As we came back to Oswiecim there\nwas a Jewish what you call it, a Jewish committee. The Germans formed a Jewish committee.",
        "Q: A council, you mean a council.",
        "A: A Jewish council. They were in charge. They dictate them what to do. So what\u2019s happened\nwas the Jewish, they came to the Jewish council. They need volunteers to come to Auschwitz, to\nthe concentration, there was not a concentration camp yet. The thing is breaking up at Birkenau\nused to be barracks before the first war. Used to be, belong to Austria and Hungary empire.\nThis was the empire of Austria, Germany, Austria, Hungary and a big empire. They called it\nKaiser Franz Josef was in charge. That was a big empire. And what happened is this used to be\nbarracks before the first war. All the soldiers were stationed there. The artillery and horses and\nso on, so on. So after the first war, this barracks were abandoned and they were standing still in\nBirkenau. Brzezinski [ph]. It was about a mile from our home town. From Oswiecim, outside\ntown. So what happened was that the Jewish committee was ordered to bring volunteers to bring\nin and to come in to the committee. So sure enough they wanted the volunteers to go and to clean\nup the barracks because they were filthy all the years. And sure enough they picked up\nvolunteers. And my father wanted to go. I said no, no dad. You stay. I go and I went instead to\nAuschwitz. And at that time I met what\u2019s his name, Himmler. I didn\u2019t know who he was but I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nmet him over there. And as I went there, over there we used to go there during the day and they\nused to bring us back at night. And we went there about a couple of weeks to clean up the place.",
        "Q: How did you know it was Himmler?",
        "A: Because later on I saw the pictures and I said to myself that was the man I did see. I didn\u2019t\nknow this is Himmler. I later on when I saw the pictures of him and I came back and I said oh\nmy god, I saw him with my own eyes. So sure enough every morning we used to go clean up.\nWeek, day after day after day. They didn\u2019t pay us. They didn\u2019t feed us anything and in the\nmeantime the Germans gave out the rations to Jewish people in OSwiecim so we had rations and\nlittle piece of bread and so on. And there was a curfew. After 9:00 nobody could go out.\nEverybody stay home and we had to have armbands with a Jude on it, yellow arm bands, the Star\nof David and the Jude in the middle.",

I never went through\nsomething like this in my life. I lived among Jewish people, among my friends. And all we\nknew. Fridays and Saturdays we used to go to the synagogue, used to celebrate all kind of\nholidays and so on, so on so to me everything was so strange. I could not believe what goes on\nhere. In the meantime the Germans, in the meantime they got what you call it beaters or killers.\nThey just sat like this here. All the radios be confiscated. No more radios. You have to bring the\nradios. If not, condemned to death. Every day new bulletins came out and so day after day after\nday it gets worse and worse and worse. Now \u2014",

        "A: I did not talk over. I didn\u2019t know what to talk about. It was something I \u2014 everything was so\nstrange. Everything was -- it was not normal. Everything was upside down. I wasn\u2019t used to this\nkind of stuff. Used to have a free time, and we\u2019d go out and we lived in a town with a, mostly\namong Jews and we didn\u2019t know nothing else.

        "A: Yeah that was beginning of, the end of 39, I think 1940. Now right away, my grandmother\nused to go for the summers, she used to go to my aunt, my father\u2019s sister. She lived near Krakow\nin Wieliczka which is a small town outside of Krakow. So she used to go there every summer\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nfor the summer time and she was staying with my aunt. And sure enough she was lucky that\nbefore and almost at the end of 39 she passed away. And my father still had a chance to go to\nbury her in Wieliczka. And as I came into Poland, I wanted to go to Wieliczka so the Jewish\ncommittee in Poland told me don\u2019t go there, because there\u2019s absolutely nothing. There is no\ncemetery, there is no nothing.",
        "Q: So you went into a ghetto in \u2014",

        "Q: A labor camp?",
        "A: Labor camp. Because the committee picked up all the people and they sent us away to a lager\ncamp and the labor camp was named, was Blechhammer. Blechhammer was an international\ncamp. They called it the Hermann Goering work camp. Hermann Goering, they called it like,\nhis institute, his work. And over there we had all kind of international people, prisoners from\ndifferent countries.",
        "Q: Were you the only person from your family that left?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: In the meantime, yes. No my sister \u2014 wait a minute. To begin with, now wait a minute. To\nbegin with, they needed volunteers to go to camp and they needed a bookkeeper. So what\u2019s\nhappened? My middle sister was what she called -- her name is Regina Schnitzer. She was a\nbookkeeper before the war. So they found out that she is a good bookkeeper and they told her we\nneed a bookkeeper and you have to go and we send you away to a camp. And is the first one to\nbe sent away to a camp. And she was in a camp by the name of Annaberg. And over there she\nhad to register people. I tell you about her, different, what happened to her. Anyway \u2014",

        "Q: Just you?",
        "A: Just me for the time being. Yes. My parents were still in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Can you tell me what life was like in Blechhammer?",
        "A: I tell you what it was. To begin with, it was like a death camp. But the minute we came in,\nthey stripped our clothes and they gave us what you called stripes, with wooden shoes. And the\nnext thing is they gave us what you call a, the beds were one, two, three bridges on straw with no\nbrav -- blanket to cover yourself up. They got us up 4:00 in the morning to walk for two hours to\nthe place where we supposed to be working. So it took us two hours to get there. People were\nbeating up and people collapsed on the way over. They couldn\u2019t take it. I was a youngster yet. I\ncould still, had a little bit energy in it. So what happened is our job was to cut out woods and\nthen carry it on our shoulders thousands of pounds of trees to carry on shoulders, all day from\nmorning to night. Lunchtime they give us what you call it soup which 1s like dishwater. That\u2019s\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nhow it tasted with a small piece of bread. And this, and then they took us back let\u2019s say 6, 7:00 or\nso and they took us back to camp under the guard of machine guns and SS goes behind us. And a\nlot of people collapsed. A lot of people were beaten. They couldn\u2019t make it up. Like I say it was\na death camp. People were dying right and left.",
        "Q: Was this all men? All men?",
        "A: All men, yes, yes. And then they brought us -- so took us what you call it, we only slept a\ncouple of hours every single day. And so on.",
        "Q: Yeah and so this was what 1940, the \u2014",
        "A: This was in 1942.",

        "A: I was in ghetto and after this, in 41 they send me and they send me to Blechhammer was 41,\n42.",
        "Q: So you were in the ghetto for a year.",
        "A: For a year, yes.",
        "Q: OK and then you were 41 to 42 you were in Blechhammer.",
        "A: I was in Blechhammer yes.",
        "Q: Did you have any contact with your parents? Any connection, any \u2014",
        "A: No, at all.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t know yeah.",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t correspond. There was no way you could write or do anything.",
        "Q: As a teenager \u2014",
        "A: Well I tell you a story about, you are talking about. My sister happened to be on Polish\npapers. We was, she acting like a Polish girl in Krakow. And she was a privileged. She could\nwrite letters because as a Polack she could still write and the censor, 1t went through it and was\nno problem. But what happened was in the back of her she saw a Polish girl. She says there goes\na Jewish girl. And she told two Gestapo men that this is a Jewish girl. And sure enough she had a\nletter written to us, to, to ghetto where she is and what goes on so she saw what\u2019s going on. So\nshe took the letters and swallowed the letters. And the next thing is they took her down to the\nGestapo headquarters in Krakow and nobody got out alive from the Gestapo headquarters. So\nsure enough they kept on squeezing her that she is not, she is Jewish, that she is not Polish. She\nwas what you call it blond and blue-eyed but they didn\u2019t believe her and they kept on squeezing\nher and telling her you\u2019re Jewish, you are Jewish, Jewish. And she kept on saying no.\nSo the Gestapo man says if you are really Polish let me see if you know the Polish prayers. You\nhear this. So she went, she sits in a school every morning, we have to say stay there when they\nsay the Jewish prayers. So she memorized it and she prayed and she made the Jewish prayers in\nfront of them.",
        "Q: The Polish prayers?",
        "A: The Polish prayers, of course. So they saw the Polish prayers and they realized that she is a\nPolack. Anyway, they send her away, not as a Jew, but they send her away as a Polack.",
        "Q: Where did they send her?",
        "A: They sent her to Auschwitz.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "Q: Oh. Why? Why did they send her to Auschwitz? She was Polish.",
        "A: They sent all the, a lot of Polacks they sent to Auschwitz to work. She was not the only one.\nAnd I tell you a story, what\u2019s happened in Auschwitz. In Auschwitz there was a lot of peasants,\nPolish peasants. They couldn\u2019t read or write. And they wanted to, they were allowed to write\nletters to their loved ones, their parents and so on and so on. So what\u2019s happened, since they\ncouldn\u2019t read or write and she was perfect in German. And she was perfect in Polish, so they\nasked her if she could write letters for them. And they gave her some kind of a reward, a piece of\nbread, a piece of this and this. So she wrote these letters. So what happened 1s that the\ncommander inside in the camp where she was, was in charge of that group and looked at her. He\nsaid listen, I know that you are Jewish. He told her. Because none of them could read or write\nand don\u2019t you ever write another letter because you\u2019re going to be sent right away to the oven.\nAnd she stopped writing.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re in Blechhammer for how long did you say?",
        "A: Blechhammer, I was there for quite a while. And then the next thing is they sent me from\nBlechhammer, they sent me what you call it to a, to Annaberg. Yeah, Annaberg was a camp\nwhich was international camp. What means international. They brought Jews from all over\nEurope, Jews from Belgium, from Holland, from France, from Italy, from Greece. All the Jews\ncame in from \u2014 they brought them in by rail from every \u2014 at night they came in and they brought\nthem in and they had to dis, or take off their clothes and so on. And they had big barrels that are\nstanding there with that had lines and they had to separate all the clothes and separate. So we had\na job while I was in Blechhammer, I mean in Annaberg, to pick up all the stuff they have and put\nit in the barrels. Like they had hidden diamonds and rings and watches and so on. And the barrels\nwere filled up and the next thing 1s were shipped to Germany and they bought weapons with it.",
        "Q: Annaberg is near what?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: Annaberg is in Niederschlesien. It\u2019s in Germany also. So we were in Annaberg. We worked\nwhat you call it making the autobahn at that time. On the autobahn means the highway like we\nhave the highways here. They built the autobahn in Germany. They have the highway go to all of\nGermany and this was our job, doing it the whole day and when they came at night, we had to do\nthis kind of selection to select all the things what they brought in from the different countries.\nNow the people over there, they weren\u2019t there too long. Because the Gestapo came every week\nand we had an appeal in the blocks. I mean they made appeals and the Gestapo men picked up\nthe people, one, two, this one, this one, this one and they were all sent out to Auschwitz. This\nwas all the Jews, different kind of nationalities. Like Holland, French Jews, Polish Jews, all these\nJews. And this went on for months and months and months.",
        "Q: What was your health like? What condition were you in?",
        "A: Bad. I mean the food was lousy. It was a piece, small piece of bread with a little bit water and\nwe had to survive. That\u2019s what we had to do.",
        "Q: Were there other young people like you?",
        "A: They were mostly older than Iam. I was a youngster among them. There were people in 40s,\nin 50s and 60s. And these people could not survive because they didn\u2019t have the energy. So what\nhappened was I was still a little bit energy because I was a little younger than they were and I\ncould do, at least I could hold on with my life. But one thing, I did not, I did not give up hope\nthat I will lose my life. I always had faith that one day I\u2019m going to be rescued and I\u2019m going to\nbe back with my family. I had my hope. And don\u2019t forget the wires were connected. Everything\nwas wired. Everything was electrified and so on and so on. And they guards were watching with\ntowers and so on.",
        "Q: Did you have a number on your arm?",
        "A: Not on my arm, no. They gave us no numbers. Only Auschwitz had numbers. I had a\nnumber but not on the arm.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "Q: On your uniform you mean?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And so did people help each other out? Did the other prisoners help each other out?",
        "A: There were, there were, everybody was stealing somebody else\u2019s bread. That was helping out.\nEverybody was hungry. Everybody was starved. People, we went out. We were eating grass\nbecause we had nothing to eat to fill out our stomach. That\u2019s how bad it was.",
        "Q: And you were wearing a striped uniform?",
        "A: Yeah, of course, same thing.",
        "Q: The same thing and the wooden shoes?",
        "A: Yeah same thing.",
        "Q: And so you stayed how long in Annaberg?",
        "A: Annaberg. I was there about two or three years til the camp was completely liquidated. And\nafter this I think less than three years. And the camp was liquidated because they send out most\nof the people, they sent to Auschwitz. And the people who remained, they had to close up the\ncamp and they sent us to a different camp. They sent us to a camp by the name of Graditz. I\ndon\u2019t know how far it was. Walking distance. So we had to walk to Graditz. And we came to\nGraditz. We had the same thing we did in Blechhammer. We were cutting woods and carrying\nwoods and carrying and so on and so on. The conditions were horrible and people were dying\nright and left. Cond \u2014 they what you call it. The health problem was so bad that people collected\nwhat you call it, became no water, no soap, no nothing so people could not wash or clean and we\nwere so filthy so everybody had lice. So lice developed typhus, so everybody was sick with\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\ntyphus. And the camp, nobody could do anything because they close up the camp because the\ncamp was full of typhus. We have 1200 people there. And we were living on the bridges one,\ntwo and three on straw and people were hallucinating because the temperature went down. No\nmedication, no water, no nothing. People were dying right and left. As I was laying, the next\nthing is that moved over to my right side and sure enough the man was dead. I pushed him over\nand the next thing is the man on my left side, the same thing happened. They pushed over his, to\nmy side and sure enough he was dead. I myself was sick with typhus. I had a high temperature. I\ndon\u2019t know how I made it out. So we had from 1200 people, 200 people survived. And from the\n200 people we could hardly walk. We could hardly do anything. So what happened is we had to\ntake out all the bodies who were laying there. We had to bring them to the yard and, and people\nwere digging a big pit and they threw it into the pits and they closed it up and they put what you\ncall it all kind of the infections on top of it, that the infections shouldn\u2019t go.\nThe Germans would never walk into it because they didn\u2019t want to get typhus. And after we\nsurvived, 200 people, we could hardly walk. And the next thing is they had to close the camp\nbecause the camp has nobody to be working. So they had to send us back to another camp. So\nwe walked about a whole day to another camp, the last camp was named Langenbielau.\nLangenbielau was a camp what the Germans where making air force parts, for the air, for the\nGerman air force. So what happened. The machineries were all by Germans and since they were\nlosing the war almost so they needed all the Germans to go to fight for the war. So they took\naway all the Germans, all these machineries, all the people who worked on the machines and\nthey took us and we should go and they teached us how to run the machines. So we had to take\nover their machinery and they sent them away to the front lines, to the Russian lines.\nSo we worked there for \u2014 I was there since beginning of January 1945. This 1s the time when we\ncame in. And we were of course surrounded by SS guards and the camp was surrounded by\nelectric wires and so on. And now that we worked there in camp and the rations were terrible.\nSame thing, but we survived somehow. Very few people going and coming. People dropped\ndead. So what happened was the Germans wanted to save bullets. They let them die in the street.\nNow in 1945 this was already May 1945. May 1945, the war was getting very bad. We hear\nsome kind of rumors that they\u2019re losing the war. We didn\u2019t know what was up.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "Q: Up to that point did you know what was happening in other countries? Did you know what\nwas happening to all the Jews?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: You had no information?",
        "A: No, not at all.",
        "Q: Ok.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You did not know.",
        "A: So what happened was that in January 1945 like I told you with the camp we worked. And\nsure enough every single day we had appeals. They were counting how many people are still\nthere. The Germans were counting. One day it was May the eighth 1945 I, I couldn\u2019t, I was sick\nlike a dog. I couldn\u2019t get out and I looked out and I see everybody is standing there for two, three\nhours and I don\u2019t see nobody, no guards, no nothing. What\u2019s going on. We didn\u2019t know what\nwas going on. The guards were running away. The whole thing was, the guard, the guard houses\nwere empty. But we always are afraid to go to the gate because the gates are what you call\nelectrified and we are afraid that they put what you call it dynamite all around the camp. If you\ncross it you were killed. Going across. So we didn\u2019t do anything. We\u2019re standing there and\nwaiting. Came about 12 noon in May the eighth 1945. All of a sudden we hear cannons\nbooming. And all of a sudden a tank break through the gate. A tank, a Russian tank and he\ncomes in and people standing there didn\u2019t know what to say. You are liberated. You are free\npeople.",
        "Q: And did you believe it?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was, I was, I couldn\u2019t believe anything anymore. Because after all the\nyears, I didn\u2019t know is right or wrong. The only thing they warned us. Don\u2019t go out to loot the\nGermans houses because we shot and kill you. So we are afraid to touch anything. They didn\u2019t\nfeed us. They didn\u2019t give us anything. They just told us you\u2019re free to do.",
        "Q: Did you understand Russian?",
        "A: A little bit.",
        "Q: And what did the other people say, the other prisoners say?",
        "A: They were happy that the war is over, that \u2014",
        "Q: Was there any kind of celebration?",
        "A: Well what kind of a celebration could it be? We were happy that we can be free people, go\nout and be a human being again. We are not in a camp any more, appeals any more, working\nconditions again and guards who are watching us all the time. This was the beauty part.",
        "Q: What did you do? How long did you stay there?",
        "A: Well in camp I couldn\u2019t stay too long. I was sick like a dog. I couldn\u2019t do anything. So sure\nenough my friend says to me you can\u2019t walk. I could barely walk. I take a little wagon. We put\nyou up and let\u2019s get out of the camp. We can\u2019t stay here.",
        "Q: Was this another young man your age?",
        "A: Yeah, a little bit older than Iam. So anyway he said I take you in a wagon and we take you\nout of here. So he went off. We came in. I tell you what he said. I, we going and find out if we\ncan get some transportation. To get out of here. So sure enough we come to an estate that was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nlike a governor\u2019s place, like the German governor. Lived in an estate, tremendous estate. Horses,\ncows, you name it and sure enough we come to the estate. We see the keeper of the estate. We\nask him a question, if we can borrow from him a horse and a wagon because we have some stuff\nin. We\u2019d like to take it out. He says sure. He was afraid because he knew what were done. He\nwas a German. So he gave us a horse and he gave us a wagon. So we took the horse and the\nwagon and we came back to the camp. We took up whatever we had left and we came back. We\nwanted to give him back the horse and the wagon. So as we came back to the estate, sure enough\nsilent, nothing. Just dogs barking all over the place. We couldn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.\nWe were afraid to go inside. Sure enough we go inside, we look in the barn where they have the\nhorses and things. Sure enough a whole rope hanging every, the governor and his wife and the\nkeeper and all the helps, they all hang themselves.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: So we were afraid to, we figure that the Russians would say that we did the one who hanged\nthem. So we went outside. We talk. I spoke to the Russian, one of the officers. I says officer we\ncame here to get the horse and wagon. We came into the barn. The next thing 1s I see all the\npeople hanging there. So he says to me where. So he comes in to me, he takes the machine gun.\nHe shoots down at them to make sure they are dead.\nAnd then he told us you can stay here and stay till you feel better and stronger and then you can\ngo your way. So let me tell you something. We were in the estate. They had, you name it, they\nhave it. Eggs, butter, cheese, clothes, shoes anything you can imagine. You could never believe\nwhat we saw, what happened over there. And we recuperated there because we were staying\nthere about six weeks to get ourselves back on our feet. But we were skeletons. I was 70 pounds.\nI could hardly walk so we were standing there for a couple of months to get \u2014",
        "Q: Was the town also called Langenbielau?",
        "A: The who?",
        "Q: Was the town that the estate was in \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: The town? It was, 1t was near Langenbielau.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the name of the town also?",
        "A: I can\u2019t recall. I don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s like a governor lives here in Albany, they have the estate over\nthere.",
        "Q: So you stayed there for six weeks?",
        "A: The who?",
        "Q: You stayed there for six weeks?",
        "A: I stayed there for a couple of weeks because we could not walk. We couldn\u2019t and he told us\nyou can stay as long as you want and you can leave any time you want. So what\u2019s happened. He\ndid not bother us that we should go, we should leave or anything else. There was nobody in\ncharge. Except the Russian soldiers, that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: Right. And so then what did you do?",
        "A: We came to our senses. I mean to our energy a little bit. We walked out looking for relatives,\nlooking if we have living ones. Maybe somebody\u2019s alive. If somebody\u2019s still here. So we went,\neverybody went different directions and sure enough somebody told me, oh I saw your sister. Oh\nyou saw my sister? She was in a woman\u2019s camp. And sure enough we were united. I saw my\nsister.",
        "Q: Which sister?",
        "A: It\u2019s the one, the bookkeeper and we were united with my sister.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",

        "Q: So you were together with her.",
        "A: I was together with her and she says let\u2019s look for other relatives. Let\u2019s see if we have the\nother sister, Leah was the younger one. Let\u2019s see if we can find her. So she went off. We walked,\nwe went all over. We asked people, back and forth.",
        "Q: Is this all in Germany?",
        "A: Everything in Germany.",
        "Q: Everything in Germany. Ok.",
        "A: Yeah so sure enough because everybody was in camps, different camps. So sure enough, we\nwalked, walked. This one, question here, question there. Sure enough somebody told us they\nsaw our sister, the youngest one. She survived. Ok. As we go along. Sure enough we found her.\nAnd we were united. All her teeth were knocked out. She was toothless. Beaten up. Hardly walk\nand sure enough after this we decided we can\u2019t stay here. We have to go. So we went what you\ncall it to the DP camp. The DP camp was not too far from Frankfurt in Germany. And so we\nwent there to the DP camp. They gave us a place where to stay. They gave us food. They gave us\nclothes. They gave us all kind of things. And I can\u2019t recall the name even of the camp. Anyway,\nwe were there quite a while and I was there quite a while. And the next thing is people came\ntelling me that the sister was in the Polish papers, that they had that she is in Poland. You hear.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nSo sure enough I said where in Poland. So she told me in a small town in Poland and she\u2019s\nsupposed to be a director of a camp, of a Jewish camp, what you call it, sponsored by the United\nNations Relief organization. UNRO. So I said how can I get from Germany back to Poland? So\nI hired a smuggler to smuggle me across the border to be able to get to the Polish, to the Poland.\nSo sure enough I told my sisters, look here you stay here. I\u2019m going back to Poland and I will see\nif I can find her. I went back to Poland, I went back, paid the smuggler and he went to the p, to\nthe bridge. The bridge was lit up and the smuggler says you wait til the lights will get off and\nyou cross the bridge. And sure enough when the lights get off we all crossed the bridge and we\nwere on the other side. This was already Polish territory. As we went there to Polish territory,\nwe had to go and we kept on walking, walking, walking and the Polish, and this was through\nGerman occupied territory at one time. So sure enough the Polacks they show us, they say listen,\ndon\u2019t go walk down but the Polish people will grab you to work because the bombs what they\nwere ruined, they want that you probably grab you to work to fix it up. But we were afraid.\nWe\u2019re not afraid. We were just out from a concentration camp. So sure enough I was there with\nanother friend and as we were walking the Polish comes up, and the military. Says come over\nhere, he says to me. What are you talking about, I just came in Poland. I just came out from a\nconcentration camp. Me and my friend. I\u2019m looking for family. You want me to work now after\nI was spent so many years slavery and so on. Oh. He said listen and you go back to the town,\nthe first thing you got to do register with the military. You hear this. That\u2019s all they\u2019re interested\nin. To have another military.\nSo sure enough we went back to our town, to the town where my sister was.",
        "Q: What town was that?",
        "A: The town was, what did the call it. I'll come back to that. Anyway this was a town which\nwas another Jewish kids, orphans. They was there and she was the director of that camp. And\nsure enough I come into the town. I meet a friend of mine which I knew before the war, yes and\nhe was a privileged person. Why? He had a motorcycle. And a motorcycle. How come he got a\nmotorcycle? His aunt was a communist before the war. And after the war they rewarded a\nmotorcycle. The Polish government. So since he had the motorcycle, I says to my friend, listen\ncan you take me to the camp. I hear my sister\u2019s supposed to be there. Sure enough he took me to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nthe camp. And I come to the camp. It\u2019s empty. Nobody is there except the cook. I said, I found\nout that she\u2019s supposed to be here. So the cook came over to me and he said listen, your sister 1s\nhere but the Russians wanted to have a show. So they have out of town another part of town, all\nthe kids went over to perform in the show. So she\u2019s on the other side of the town. So sure\nenough I talked to my friend to take me over to the other place of town. He found out that I am\nalready in the camp where she is supposed to be. He walked over and I came over there and we\ncriss crossed. First. So sure enough we were united. After all the years.",
        "Q: What happened to your parents?",
        "A: My parents were sent from the ghetto, from Srodula, they were sent to Auschwitz. My father\nwas what you call it sent to the crematorium in May. I have the papers because they sent me\nfrom the Holocaust museum the day where he was, what they tell him eshtomen, [ph] he died.\nYou know how they write. So I had the original paper from the Red Cross that he died particular\nday. My mother survived the war.",
        "Q: Your mother survived?",
        "A: In Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Now you\u2019ve reunited with your sister and then what do you do?",
        "A: Then I was united my sisters and my mother said before the war that we should all meet back\nin OSwiecim where we were born. Ok. So since we were already in the DP camp, and they went\nback to Poland so what\u2019s happened was that my sister says it\u2019s no use to go back to Poland. Anti-\nSemitism, the Russians told us don\u2019t go back because they will send you to Siberia. You never\nhave with them again. So we decided not to stay, not to go back and we decided to stay and wait\nuntil we bring them over to us. So we were staying what you call it in, in the DP camp and they\nwere in Poland. And they were in Poland. My sister and my mother and my sister got married in\nPoland to a Jewish man. And sure enough he, at that time, Poland allowed people to have a little\nbusiness. So he had a little business. And she went off. They did not allow the Jews to leave.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nAnd then it came an order and so my mother was elderly and she could leave. Well what\nhappened was so we arranged for somebody to sponsor my mother to America. But since my\nmother was crippled from the war. She could not walk so she wouldn\u2019t be able to get a visa to\ncome to America. So we decided maybe she cannot. They will allow her to come in. So we had\na woman, somebody who sponsored her as a maid to come back to Canada. So she went off. She\ngot the papers and meantime, as she go in for the papers. She was in Paris. She was in Paris at\ntransit and she was in Paris for over a year waiting to go in. And in Paris, in the meantime, she\nwas waiting. And finally she went in to Canada. She went to Canada. She was living there in\nvery harsh conditions. They were, the climate was bad and everything was bad. I couldn\u2019t go\nthere. Nobody could go there because we were not citizens. I mean I tell you how come we came\nto America later.\nSo what happened was that she was living in Montreal Canada. And Poland decided that Jews\ncan leave, not to America, no place else but to Palestine. At that time it wasn\u2019t Israel, was\nPalestine. So sure enough my brother in law and my sister picked their selves up and they went\nto Palestine. As they went to Palestine my mother had a chance to bring them over to Canada\nbecause mothers could bring in siblings back to their country. So mother arranged it and she\nbrought over my brother in law and my sister to Canada. And they remained in Canada and they\ndied in Canada.",

And she helped her a whole lot and she sent her\nfood over the border. Over the line and every time there was an appeal, a death appeal, she was\nnotified, the lager Fuhrer was notified. My sister that this 1s the appeal. So what happened was\nthey arranged it for her to put a uniform on her that she is what you call helping out cleaning out\nthe places and so on.

My mother could not even walk cause she was crippled\nthat time. So my sister arranged a little wagon and they pushed her and they pushed her and they\nwent along all the way. And people died on the way over but somehow, some way for day and\nnight, they went til they came in to Gross-Rosen. When they came into Gross-Rosen they were\nliberated by the British.

And sure enough President Truman made the decree that\n60,000 people who survived the war need no visa. They can come to the United States without a\nvisa. We did not need papers, we didn\u2019t have visas. We can go in. if you register, you go. So my\nsister went and registered me and my sister and my brother in law and we all registered. And\nsure enough we came on the first boat who left Bremenhaven in Germany. And we left what you\ncall it, for America. And the name of the ship was Marine Fleisher. It was advertised in the\npapers. If you look up the New York Times you see my name and my sister\u2019s name come on\nthat boat. We have, we are registered on that. The New York Times says has what you call it a\nprint out of it.\nSo we came into America. I told you. I had two uncles living there before the war. Didn\u2019t I tell\nyou this before?

        "A: Yeah. The thing is when we came we were living with my uncle for a couple of days when\nwe came off the boat.

And he was baking all\nkind of stuff. He was a baker by trade. So the apartment was empty because he took the family\nwith him. So my uncle arranged for us to stay in the apartment for the next two months because\nwhile he is away we can stay in his apartment. In Borough Park. So we stayed in the apartment\nat Borough Park. After two months we could not stay there any longer because we knew they\nare coming back so we had to look for an apartment. So we went all over the place looking.

But since the war\nended, they needed places for the soldiers, for people to come to it to live. So they opened them\nup again. It was a walk up, three flight walk up and no hot water. The bathtub was in the\nkitchen. The toilet, excuse me, was 1n the hall and there was no -- steps of course going up there.\nSo the apartment at that time we rented, we paid about $12 a week. It was a railroad apartment.\nYou go from one room to the next. And that\u2019s where we lived there for a while. And after a\nwhile, my sister was married already.

In my uncle\u2019s apartment. And she moved out. And since I couldn\u2019t stay there\ntoo long, I went to a furnished, I rented a furnished room in the Bronx and I lived there for a\nwhile. And after a while I lived there and the next thing is I figured I can\u2019t stay and work my life\nall the time, for $32. So I went to the owner and said listen, I\u2019ve been working here for a while.\nI'd like to have a raise. So he gave me a two dollar raise. I says if this is what I\u2019m going to wait\nfor, forget about it. I could never get married. I could never have a family. I could never do\nanything. So what\u2019s happened? I quit and I looking for something to do. And a good friend of\nmine came along. He said listen. There is a store to be bought on the Lower East Side on\nOrchard Street. Are you interested? I said of course I\u2019m interested. I want to get out. So sure\nenough he came with me and we, and the man was a very sick man.

        "A: A political view like what? To begin with I believe there is only one place which 1s Israel\nbecause this is the only place that anything what happened, anywhere any place where you can\nstay and you can live and you can survive because what I saw during the second war was all the\ndoors were close and nobody opened up the door. And nobody want to let you in, they chased\nyou out, they send you away and so on. So what else is there? There is only one place in this\nworld. America is a beautiful country. I love America. I was what you call very, very successful\nhere. I came penniless and thanks god, I am ok. I am not worried about it. But the thing is this\nyear sitting on the back of my mind. I always say to myself, god forbid if something like this\nshould ever happen, at least we have a place where to go. At least there is somebody to look after\nus. This is a kind of security which we didn\u2019t have. We didn\u2019t have guns, we didn\u2019t have planes,\nwe didn\u2019t have tanks, we didn\u2019t have anything. But thanks god that we have it.

It\u2019s something that he was the organizer,\nhe was the killer but you cannot take one man and say he did everything by himself.

You go into Iran, they deny it ever happened. You go into the\nArab countries, it\u2019s just a Jew propaganda. It never happened. I mean how can you talk to people\nif they don\u2019t even understand that things do, did happen because you don\u2019t deal to, 1n democratic\ncountries. You deal with animals all over. They only have one religion which is Moslem and\nthat\u2019s all they believe in. The Jews have no right to live. The Jews have no right to exist. They\ncome from pigs.

        "A: My father\u2019s is like this here. My grandfather, he owned a concrete factory before the first war\nyet. He had a partner and they made concrete pipes, sewer pipes and water pipes and all cement\nsavers, all kind, everything from cement and so on. So he had a factory in Breckinkau [ph], that\nwas in Birkenau about a mile away from the concentration camp and he produced this kind of\nthings. He also had a railroad track coming from the main station to the factory so they could\ndeliver sand and cement what you needed to set, to make the products. And at the same time to\nsend out the finished products at the same time.\nNow my grandfather went every year, he used to go to Carlsbad for vacation, like we go here to\nthe mountains. One year, in 1917 he went to Carlsbad. On the way he suffered a heart attack and\nwas, died on the way over. My father was at that time had to go and bury him in Oswiecim. The\nstone is still there in OSwiecim on the cemetery. As a matter of fact I did go there to visit it and I\nalso have a picture of my grandfather\u2019s stone and I sent a memorial over there and I put a candle\nover it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",

And my father was responsible to his eight siblings,\nincluding his brothers and sisters. They were the youngsters, to support them and keep them and\nmarrying them off after a while.\nAnd he kept the factory til 1939. Then the Nazis came. They confiscated the factory and they\ntook all the equipment back to Germany. I could never claim it because I had no proof that they\ntook it and where they took it to. And my mother survived. She also tried it. We were not\nsuccessful at all. Up to this date, I\u2019m fighting the Polish government to recover the property\nwhich 1s still in Poland in Birkenau to get my property, the owner. I should be, I am the only\nowner. And still to now the Polish government is not budging after 60 some odd years. Because\nthey are, they took it and they hold onto it.",

        "A: I went in the morning. We were forced to go in. It was compulsory, as all the people in\nPoland had to go to school. So I went in the mornings. I went about 8:00 in the morning, walking\nof course to school. There was no such thing as transportation, summer or winter. And I had to\nwalk to the school, about two miles out and we were there with the goyim in this school. And\nthis was a Catholic country. And every morning the Catholics had to get up and we were\nstanding there. We had to stand up, bare headed and they had to say the prayer, the Polish prayer.\nBut we did not, could not participate because we were Jewish. This was in every morning, they\nhad to say their prayer and we had to stand up and listening. And this was \u2014 and the cross was in\nthe middle of the school.",
        "A: I did, I did. I tell you what happened. We had this recess during the lunch hours. So we went\nto the yard and of course, the Polish hoodlums, they used to -- knew that we are Jewish. And\nthey used to come and beat us up sometimes. And I went to the principal and I complained to the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nprincipal. I said, look here. I was beaten up for doing nothing. You just beat me up for no\nreason. And you know what she answered me. He didn\u2019t kill you, did he? That was the answer of\nthe principal from a public school in Poland. So you ask me if I knew anti-Semitism. I was a\nyoungster, a baby yet.\nNow let me tell you another experience. My father went to the factory and I was with him sitting\nin the factory, on a horse and a wagon and the next thing is, as we, first we came out of the\nfactory, another farmer passed by with a horse and wagon with a whip. And he whipped my\nfather with the whip, for no reason whatsoever. I witnessed this as a child.",
        "A: What could he do? He\u2019s not going to fight somebody. He\u2019s going to have a knife and kill\nhim. He had no choice. We kept on going.",
        "A: The who?",
        "A: The teachers in school. The teachers in school of course they were all anti-Semites. And but\nwe did our homework and we did the best we could. But absolutely no, no what you call the\nlove they had for the Jews. As far as the Polack goes, they did not change and I tell you an\nexperience, what happened to me in the year 2000 when I went to Poland and I wanted my\nfamily, my sister and my niece and my nephew and my niece they wanted to see where their\nparents were born. Because they were not alive anymore. My sisters. So what happened? We\ntook a trip to Poland and I speak Polish, of course. And as we came to Poland, they wanted to\nsee the apartment that we lived in. So sure enough I come into the apartment. I brought a box of\ncandy. I figured I want to be nice and polite. And I knocked on the door. The place we lived in.\nand the next thing is, a woman opened up the door and it was a small room. And I said where 1s\nthe apartment? They said they divided the apartment in two. The other half is on the other side.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nOk so I wanted to show the bigger apartment because this was one big apartment. So sure\nenough, I knock on the door of the other apartment. The woman opens up the door. The husband\na big bull with a moustache stands in the back and he says, shows with the hand, no, no. You\ncan\u2019t come in here. And I says to the woman, look here. We came 3000 miles. All Ido. I don\u2019t\nwant your apartment. All I came here to show my niece, my nephew, where they live, what and\nmy sons, my sons were with me too. To show where I was born and where their mothers was\nborn. No way. He\u2019s not, not me into the apartment and I took that and I said look here. I didn\u2019t\ncome for the apartment. I didn\u2019t want to argument because I was afraid. He could take a knife\nand stab me and kill me so I walked away. So just wanted to show you how they did not change,\nno matter how publicity and how tried, still and all they\u2019re still the same Polacks they were. One\nvice -- one prime minister in Israel said they minute they were born, they soaked in anti-\nSemitism in their mother\u2019s milk.",
        "A: Where? After the war?",
        "A: Of course. I tell you. The thing is we had market days twice a week, Mondays and Thursdays.\nAnd a lot of farmers came in with their eggs and cheeses and chickens and goose and so on to\nsell. And of course the market was in the middle of the center of town, Mondays and Thursdays.\nThey all came and the Jewish mothers came in for the sabbath. They bought chickens, they\nbought the eggs and they bought everything else. Now the Jewish people had stores around town\nand I guess all kind of stores, like suits and clothes and materials and so on and so on. So the\nPolacks, the farmers, they had the money and they figured they had nothing in their farms. They\ngo into the Jewish stores and they buy what you call it, the clothes and they make themselves\nclothes and they buy shoes and so and so on. The anti-Semites were standing right and outside\nthe stores. They saw the Polacks coming out with packages from the store and says go back to\nthe store. Tell the Jew to give you the money back.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: So this is what I want you to know what the Polacks are. And this was all til 1939.",
        "A: My father was a Zionist yes. My sister too. And let me tell you another -- you\u2019re talking about\nanti-Semitism. Every time there was Easter time, Christmas time, we used -- my father used to\ntake me to shul three times a day. Mornings and nights. So what happened was that they\nannounce in the synagogue before Easter and before Christmas, Jews don\u2019t go out in the streets.\nEaster is coming up. They have a special day; so is Christmas. They all come out from the\nchurches with the Madonnas, with the pictures and the Marys and they walk down the streets and\nthere will be riots. So the Jews had to stand out, stay out of the streets and stay home. Because\nthey were afraid they should not attack the Jews. So just shows you what Poland was like before\nthe war. And this is my experience as a child.",
        "A: I did. Now let me tell you. So what happened was in the morning we used to go what you\ncall it til about 2:00, we had public school which was compulsory. After 2:00 we used to go\nHadar and then to yeshiva, so we spent about from 2:00 til about 6:00 at night we went to\nHebrew school and also we went to the yeshiva to learn Homesh [ph] and Mishnah [ph] and\nGemara and all kind of things. After every single day except Saturday. And on Saturday my\nfather used to send me to his uncle\u2019s and to his relatives to find out what I learned during the\nweek And they questioned me about different kind of subjects if I remember. And this I get a\nreward, a piece of cake, a piece of chocolate, some candy. This was the reward I got.",

        "A: September 39 was like this here. The anti-Semitism was so great that people expect and knew\na war 1s coming up because they were talking about it, they were talking about it and everybody,\nJews already were so depressed because the economy was so bad, they squeezed the Jew out.\nThey forbid already Jewish slaughter. They forbid already a Jewish students to go to school. To\ngymnasium and so on. Anti-Semitism in the army was terrible. My brother in law he was, there\nwas compulsory service in the armed forces in Poland. And you \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: Before September 39.",
        "A: Let me just tell you. So what\u2019s happened is, my brother in law he was 21 years old and people\nat 18 or 20 they had to register with the authorities and they were what you call a drafted. He was\nAl, he was drafted. And they took him into the army. It just so happened that my brother in law\nwas a very bright young man, very smart and very in. And they\u2019re looking for officers to put\nthem up in the arms. So sure enough he came in before a board, and they asked him what is your\nreligion? And he said the religion of Moses. The minute they found out the religion of Moses\nthey rejected him. He could not become an officer in the Polish army. Ok I just want you to give\nthe details til what happened before the war.\nNow before the war, it was a terrible situation. People did not know what to expect. They wanted\nalready to have a war because in 1914 the war was on civilian people were safe. They sent them\naway, mothers and children and so on and so on. The people thought that this is going to be the\nsame thing like it was. We did not know what goes on in Germany. So \u2014",
        "A: We did, we did because we did hear about it but didn\u2019t know what goes on because there was\nno such thing as propaganda of any kind to hear what goes on. Poland kept on saying we are\nstrong. We don\u2019t get, even in the border we, he wouldn\u2019t give up. You are fight to the length\nand so on, so on. It didn\u2019t happen because they collapsed in no time at all. So what happened\nwas when the war broke out, I told you. My cousin, my first cousin, was bombed. By the way,\nmy father, I was sleeping at my grandmother\u2019s apartment because she had a bigger apartment\ntoo, and were four in the house, so I slept in my grandmother\u2019s apartment. She lived on the same\nbuilding the same floor. So what happened is, 4:00 in the morning, my father wakes me up.\nSeptember 1, 1939. He says you better get up because we have to go to the basement because the\nwar just broke out. Ok, got me up. And the next thing is we went down to the basement to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nshelter. And the next thing is after the alarm was off you know and so on, we went down the\nstreet. As we went down the street, I did meet my cousin. We were talking and so on, and so on.\nSo we all, after a while alarm came on again. I was running to my home and he was running to\nhis home. Sure enough a bomb dropped in front of his house, where the soldiers were stationed\nin the school. It was across the street from my cousin\u2019s house and they bomb hit it and he was\nwounded and he died on the spot and they took him away. It was my first experience what\nhappened.",

        "A: Then what happened. Then it was like this here. The city was in panic because we didn\u2019t\nknow when the Nazis are come, when the Germans are coming in. We didn\u2019t know what to do so\nwhat happened. Everybody was trying to run away. We didn\u2019t know where to run. We figured\nwe go to a bigger city which was Krakow, which was about two miles, about two hours away\nfrom us. So my sister was very energetic. She goes down to the street. She sees a big truck and\nshe asked the truck driver if he would like to take us to Krakow. And the truck driver agreed for\npayment.",

        "A: So she asked the Polish driver if he would take us to Krakow. He says by all means. So sure\nenough he came in the front of the house and we picked up whatever we could. And we went\nout to the truck. We took our neighbors with us. And our neighbor was also sitting there. And\nthe next thing is as we would go down, the Polack couldn\u2019t wait already for us to leave. So they\ncan come in and clean up and everything what was left over there. Even the nails shouldn\u2019t stay.\nAnd the next thing is, we looked around. There was absolutely no police. And no military Polish\npolice on, what do you call it, no police. No protection whatsoever. We were afraid even the\nPolacks themselves shouldn\u2019t kill us. So what happened. We took off by truck. We all were\nloaded up. And our neighbor and even people couldn\u2019t walk. They threw away the walking and\nthey are running. To, out of town because they knew that otherwise they will be in problems.\nAnd sure enough we kept on going. By the time we went, every time people piled up on the\ntruck. By the time we hit Krakow the truck would hardly move. It was loaded with people and\nfinally we did come to Krakow. We came to Krakow, we figure that in Krakow there will be no\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nGermans. Sure enough, the patrols were already walking in Krakow. And my father and my\nmother had what you call it relatives in Krakow. So we were staying in my grandmother, great\ngrandmother\u2019s house when we came into Krakow. As we came into Krakow, the patrols, the\nGerman patrols were walking the streets. So my sister, my sister Arusha, the one I talked about\nwanted to see what goes on. So she opens up the curtain and as she opened up the curtain, one of\nthe Germans a sharp shooter, shoot her through the window and missed her by millimeters. She\nwould have been dead on the spot, missed her by just by a second. And she, that\u2019s how she \u2014\nnow after we came into Krakow, my sister was standing there and she didn\u2019t want to go back to\nOswiecim because we were staying there for a while and after a while my mother said let\u2019s go\nback to OSwiecim so we went all back. As we went back, my sister was blond and blue eyed so\nshe was acting like a, she wanted to be like a Polish girl to survive. So what did she do? She\nchanged her name to Wanda, a Polish name. So sure enough we went back and she remained in\nPoland, in Krakow. And meantime we were in Oswiecim. As we came back to Oswiecim there\nwas a Jewish what you call it, a Jewish committee. The Germans formed a Jewish committee.",
        "A: A Jewish council. They were in charge. They dictate them what to do. So what\u2019s happened\nwas the Jewish, they came to the Jewish council. They need volunteers to come to Auschwitz, to\nthe concentration, there was not a concentration camp yet. The thing is breaking up at Birkenau\nused to be barracks before the first war. Used to be, belong to Austria and Hungary empire.\nThis was the empire of Austria, Germany, Austria, Hungary and a big empire. They called it\nKaiser Franz Josef was in charge. That was a big empire. And what happened is this used to be\nbarracks before the first war. All the soldiers were stationed there. The artillery and horses and\nso on, so on. So after the first war, this barracks were abandoned and they were standing still in\nBirkenau. Brzezinski [ph]. It was about a mile from our home town. From Oswiecim, outside\ntown. So what happened was that the Jewish committee was ordered to bring volunteers to bring\nin and to come in to the committee. So sure enough they wanted the volunteers to go and to clean\nup the barracks because they were filthy all the years. And sure enough they picked up\nvolunteers. And my father wanted to go. I said no, no dad. You stay. I go and I went instead to\nAuschwitz. And at that time I met what\u2019s his name, Himmler. I didn\u2019t know who he was but I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nmet him over there. And as I went there, over there we used to go there during the day and they\nused to bring us back at night. And we went there about a couple of weeks to clean up the place.",
        "A: Because later on I saw the pictures and I said to myself that was the man I did see. I didn\u2019t\nknow this is Himmler. I later on when I saw the pictures of him and I came back and I said oh\nmy god, I saw him with my own eyes. So sure enough every morning we used to go clean up.\nWeek, day after day after day. They didn\u2019t pay us. They didn\u2019t feed us anything and in the\nmeantime the Germans gave out the rations to Jewish people in OSwiecim so we had rations and\nlittle piece of bread and so on. And there was a curfew. After 9:00 nobody could go out.\nEverybody stay home and we had to have armbands with a Jude on it, yellow arm bands, the Star\nof David and the Jude in the middle.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know what it\u2019s all about because it was still. Everything was so strange to me. I was\nnever used to something like this here. All of a sudden it all changes. I never went through\nsomething like this in my life. I lived among Jewish people, among my friends. And all we\nknew. Fridays and Saturdays we used to go to the synagogue, used to celebrate all kind of\nholidays and so on, so on so to me everything was so strange. I could not believe what goes on\nhere. In the meantime the Germans, in the meantime they got what you call it beaters or killers.\nThey just sat like this here. All the radios be confiscated. No more radios. You have to bring the\nradios. If not, condemned to death. Every day new bulletins came out and so day after day after\nday it gets worse and worse and worse. Now \u2014",
        "A: My father had two brother in laws in America. So he wrote them letters before the war yet\nbecause he knew something is coming. And he begged them to send him visas to come to\nAmerica. He never had an answer.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: Well, after the war.",
        "A: I did not talk over. I didn\u2019t know what to talk about. It was something I \u2014 everything was so\nstrange. Everything was -- it was not normal. Everything was upside down. I wasn\u2019t used to this\nkind of stuff. Used to have a free time, and we\u2019d go out and we lived in a town with a, mostly\namong Jews and we didn\u2019t know nothing else. The only time I met the goyim, only when I went\nto school with them, that\u2019s about all.",
        "A: At home I speak Yiddish mostly.",
        "A: Yes. I know German because my father when he was born, it used to be Austrian empire so\nthey spoke German.",
        "A: I still speak German of today, today too.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t listen to his speeches. We had no radio.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: No, they took away all the radios.",
        "A: The newspapers were no newspapers. Everything was in German propaganda and so on. We\ndidn\u2019t buy these papers. We didn\u2019t read anything.",
        "A: Yes, we had to clean up the barracks. And we came home every single day.",
        "A: Oh we did it for a couple of months. And afterwards they decided to make Oswiecim,\nAuschwitz, Juden rein. It means clean of Jews. And the declared it a Reich. This belonged to\nthe Third Reich. And Oswiecim will become a Reich, and all the Jews will be evacuated to the\nghettoes. So we were evacuated to Sosnowiec to ghetto. They called it, what did the call it. It\u2019s\nSosnowiec.",
        "A: Outside of Sosnowiec there\u2019s a ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah that was beginning of, the end of 39, I think 1940. Now right away, my grandmother\nused to go for the summers, she used to go to my aunt, my father\u2019s sister. She lived near Krakow\nin Wieliczka which is a small town outside of Krakow. So she used to go there every summer\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nfor the summer time and she was staying with my aunt. And sure enough she was lucky that\nbefore and almost at the end of 39 she passed away. And my father still had a chance to go to\nbury her in Wieliczka. And as I came into Poland, I wanted to go to Wieliczka so the Jewish\ncommittee in Poland told me don\u2019t go there, because there\u2019s absolutely nothing. There is no\ncemetery, there is no nothing.",
        "A: Yeah, Srodula, they called it Srodula. It\u2019s empty. The ghetto was called Srodula.",
        "A: That was in Sosnowiec. It\u2019s a\u2014",
        "A: The conditions the ghetto was like this here. They gave you rations and I wasn\u2019t there too\nlong because they were trying, they were grabbing me and they sended me to a committee and\nthey send me away to a camp, to an arbeitslager.",
        "A: Labor camp. Because the committee picked up all the people and they sent us away to a lager\ncamp and the labor camp was named, was Blechhammer. Blechhammer was an international\ncamp. They called it the Hermann Goering work camp. Hermann Goering, they called it like,\nhis institute, his work. And over there we had all kind of international people, prisoners from\ndifferent countries.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: In the meantime, yes. No my sister \u2014 wait a minute. To begin with, now wait a minute. To\nbegin with, they needed volunteers to go to camp and they needed a bookkeeper. So what\u2019s\nhappened? My middle sister was what she called -- her name is Regina Schnitzer. She was a\nbookkeeper before the war. So they found out that she is a good bookkeeper and they told her we\nneed a bookkeeper and you have to go and we send you away to a camp. And is the first one to\nbe sent away to a camp. And she was in a camp by the name of Annaberg. And over there she\nhad to register people. I tell you about her, different, what happened to her. Anyway \u2014",
        "A: I was in Blechhammer. But she was \u2014",
        "A: If |\u2014I had nobody else. I was the only \u2014",
        "A: Just me for the time being. Yes. My parents were still in the ghetto.",
        "A: I tell you what it was. To begin with, it was like a death camp. But the minute we came in,\nthey stripped our clothes and they gave us what you called stripes, with wooden shoes. And the\nnext thing is they gave us what you call a, the beds were one, two, three bridges on straw with no\nbrav -- blanket to cover yourself up. They got us up 4:00 in the morning to walk for two hours to\nthe place where we supposed to be working. So it took us two hours to get there. People were\nbeating up and people collapsed on the way over. They couldn\u2019t take it. I was a youngster yet. I\ncould still, had a little bit energy in it. So what happened is our job was to cut out woods and\nthen carry it on our shoulders thousands of pounds of trees to carry on shoulders, all day from\nmorning to night. Lunchtime they give us what you call it soup which 1s like dishwater. That\u2019s\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nhow it tasted with a small piece of bread. And this, and then they took us back let\u2019s say 6, 7:00 or\nso and they took us back to camp under the guard of machine guns and SS goes behind us. And a\nlot of people collapsed. A lot of people were beaten. They couldn\u2019t make it up. Like I say it was\na death camp. People were dying right and left.",
        "A: All men, yes, yes. And then they brought us -- so took us what you call it, we only slept a\ncouple of hours every single day. And so on.",
        "A: This was in 1942.",
        "A: I was in ghetto and after this, in 41 they send me and they send me to Blechhammer was 41,\n42.",
        "A: For a year, yes.",
        "A: I was in Blechhammer yes.",
        "A: No, at all.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t correspond. There was no way you could write or do anything.",
        "A: Well I tell you a story about, you are talking about. My sister happened to be on Polish\npapers. We was, she acting like a Polish girl in Krakow. And she was a privileged. She could\nwrite letters because as a Polack she could still write and the censor, 1t went through it and was\nno problem. But what happened was in the back of her she saw a Polish girl. She says there goes\na Jewish girl. And she told two Gestapo men that this is a Jewish girl. And sure enough she had a\nletter written to us, to, to ghetto where she is and what goes on so she saw what\u2019s going on. So\nshe took the letters and swallowed the letters. And the next thing is they took her down to the\nGestapo headquarters in Krakow and nobody got out alive from the Gestapo headquarters. So\nsure enough they kept on squeezing her that she is not, she is Jewish, that she is not Polish. She\nwas what you call it blond and blue-eyed but they didn\u2019t believe her and they kept on squeezing\nher and telling her you\u2019re Jewish, you are Jewish, Jewish. And she kept on saying no.\nSo the Gestapo man says if you are really Polish let me see if you know the Polish prayers. You\nhear this. So she went, she sits in a school every morning, we have to say stay there when they\nsay the Jewish prayers. So she memorized it and she prayed and she made the Jewish prayers in\nfront of them.",
        "A: The Polish prayers, of course. So they saw the Polish prayers and they realized that she is a\nPolack. Anyway, they send her away, not as a Jew, but they send her away as a Polack.",
        "A: They sent her to Auschwitz.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: They sent all the, a lot of Polacks they sent to Auschwitz to work. She was not the only one.\nAnd I tell you a story, what\u2019s happened in Auschwitz. In Auschwitz there was a lot of peasants,\nPolish peasants. They couldn\u2019t read or write. And they wanted to, they were allowed to write\nletters to their loved ones, their parents and so on and so on. So what\u2019s happened, since they\ncouldn\u2019t read or write and she was perfect in German. And she was perfect in Polish, so they\nasked her if she could write letters for them. And they gave her some kind of a reward, a piece of\nbread, a piece of this and this. So she wrote these letters. So what happened 1s that the\ncommander inside in the camp where she was, was in charge of that group and looked at her. He\nsaid listen, I know that you are Jewish. He told her. Because none of them could read or write\nand don\u2019t you ever write another letter because you\u2019re going to be sent right away to the oven.\nAnd she stopped writing.",
        "A: Blechhammer, I was there for quite a while. And then the next thing is they sent me from\nBlechhammer, they sent me what you call it to a, to Annaberg. Yeah, Annaberg was a camp\nwhich was international camp. What means international. They brought Jews from all over\nEurope, Jews from Belgium, from Holland, from France, from Italy, from Greece. All the Jews\ncame in from \u2014 they brought them in by rail from every \u2014 at night they came in and they brought\nthem in and they had to dis, or take off their clothes and so on. And they had big barrels that are\nstanding there with that had lines and they had to separate all the clothes and separate. So we had\na job while I was in Blechhammer, I mean in Annaberg, to pick up all the stuff they have and put\nit in the barrels. Like they had hidden diamonds and rings and watches and so on. And the barrels\nwere filled up and the next thing 1s were shipped to Germany and they bought weapons with it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: Annaberg is in Niederschlesien. It\u2019s in Germany also. So we were in Annaberg. We worked\nwhat you call it making the autobahn at that time. On the autobahn means the highway like we\nhave the highways here. They built the autobahn in Germany. They have the highway go to all of\nGermany and this was our job, doing it the whole day and when they came at night, we had to do\nthis kind of selection to select all the things what they brought in from the different countries.\nNow the people over there, they weren\u2019t there too long. Because the Gestapo came every week\nand we had an appeal in the blocks. I mean they made appeals and the Gestapo men picked up\nthe people, one, two, this one, this one, this one and they were all sent out to Auschwitz. This\nwas all the Jews, different kind of nationalities. Like Holland, French Jews, Polish Jews, all these\nJews. And this went on for months and months and months.",
        "A: Bad. I mean the food was lousy. It was a piece, small piece of bread with a little bit water and\nwe had to survive. That\u2019s what we had to do.",
        "A: They were mostly older than Iam. I was a youngster among them. There were people in 40s,\nin 50s and 60s. And these people could not survive because they didn\u2019t have the energy. So what\nhappened was I was still a little bit energy because I was a little younger than they were and I\ncould do, at least I could hold on with my life. But one thing, I did not, I did not give up hope\nthat I will lose my life. I always had faith that one day I\u2019m going to be rescued and I\u2019m going to\nbe back with my family. I had my hope. And don\u2019t forget the wires were connected. Everything\nwas wired. Everything was electrified and so on and so on. And they guards were watching with\ntowers and so on.",
        "A: Not on my arm, no. They gave us no numbers. Only Auschwitz had numbers. I had a\nnumber but not on the arm.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: There were, there were, everybody was stealing somebody else\u2019s bread. That was helping out.\nEverybody was hungry. Everybody was starved. People, we went out. We were eating grass\nbecause we had nothing to eat to fill out our stomach. That\u2019s how bad it was.",
        "A: Yeah, of course, same thing.",
        "A: Yeah same thing.",
        "A: Annaberg. I was there about two or three years til the camp was completely liquidated. And\nafter this I think less than three years. And the camp was liquidated because they send out most\nof the people, they sent to Auschwitz. And the people who remained, they had to close up the\ncamp and they sent us to a different camp. They sent us to a camp by the name of Graditz. I\ndon\u2019t know how far it was. Walking distance. So we had to walk to Graditz. And we came to\nGraditz. We had the same thing we did in Blechhammer. We were cutting woods and carrying\nwoods and carrying and so on and so on. The conditions were horrible and people were dying\nright and left. Cond \u2014 they what you call it. The health problem was so bad that people collected\nwhat you call it, became no water, no soap, no nothing so people could not wash or clean and we\nwere so filthy so everybody had lice. So lice developed typhus, so everybody was sick with\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\ntyphus. And the camp, nobody could do anything because they close up the camp because the\ncamp was full of typhus. We have 1200 people there. And we were living on the bridges one,\ntwo and three on straw and people were hallucinating because the temperature went down. No\nmedication, no water, no nothing. People were dying right and left. As I was laying, the next\nthing is that moved over to my right side and sure enough the man was dead. I pushed him over\nand the next thing is the man on my left side, the same thing happened. They pushed over his, to\nmy side and sure enough he was dead. I myself was sick with typhus. I had a high temperature. I\ndon\u2019t know how I made it out. So we had from 1200 people, 200 people survived. And from the\n200 people we could hardly walk. We could hardly do anything. So what happened is we had to\ntake out all the bodies who were laying there. We had to bring them to the yard and, and people\nwere digging a big pit and they threw it into the pits and they closed it up and they put what you\ncall it all kind of the infections on top of it, that the infections shouldn\u2019t go.\nThe Germans would never walk into it because they didn\u2019t want to get typhus. And after we\nsurvived, 200 people, we could hardly walk. And the next thing is they had to close the camp\nbecause the camp has nobody to be working. So they had to send us back to another camp. So\nwe walked about a whole day to another camp, the last camp was named Langenbielau.\nLangenbielau was a camp what the Germans where making air force parts, for the air, for the\nGerman air force. So what happened. The machineries were all by Germans and since they were\nlosing the war almost so they needed all the Germans to go to fight for the war. So they took\naway all the Germans, all these machineries, all the people who worked on the machines and\nthey took us and we should go and they teached us how to run the machines. So we had to take\nover their machinery and they sent them away to the front lines, to the Russian lines.\nSo we worked there for \u2014 I was there since beginning of January 1945. This 1s the time when we\ncame in. And we were of course surrounded by SS guards and the camp was surrounded by\nelectric wires and so on. And now that we worked there in camp and the rations were terrible.\nSame thing, but we survived somehow. Very few people going and coming. People dropped\ndead. So what happened was the Germans wanted to save bullets. They let them die in the street.\nNow in 1945 this was already May 1945. May 1945, the war was getting very bad. We hear\nsome kind of rumors that they\u2019re losing the war. We didn\u2019t know what was up.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: No, not at all.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: So what happened was that in January 1945 like I told you with the camp we worked. And\nsure enough every single day we had appeals. They were counting how many people are still\nthere. The Germans were counting. One day it was May the eighth 1945 I, I couldn\u2019t, I was sick\nlike a dog. I couldn\u2019t get out and I looked out and I see everybody is standing there for two, three\nhours and I don\u2019t see nobody, no guards, no nothing. What\u2019s going on. We didn\u2019t know what\nwas going on. The guards were running away. The whole thing was, the guard, the guard houses\nwere empty. But we always are afraid to go to the gate because the gates are what you call\nelectrified and we are afraid that they put what you call it dynamite all around the camp. If you\ncross it you were killed. Going across. So we didn\u2019t do anything. We\u2019re standing there and\nwaiting. Came about 12 noon in May the eighth 1945. All of a sudden we hear cannons\nbooming. And all of a sudden a tank break through the gate. A tank, a Russian tank and he\ncomes in and people standing there didn\u2019t know what to say. You are liberated. You are free\npeople.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was, I was, I couldn\u2019t believe anything anymore. Because after all the\nyears, I didn\u2019t know is right or wrong. The only thing they warned us. Don\u2019t go out to loot the\nGermans houses because we shot and kill you. So we are afraid to touch anything. They didn\u2019t\nfeed us. They didn\u2019t give us anything. They just told us you\u2019re free to do.",
        "A: A little bit.",
        "A: They were happy that the war is over, that \u2014",
        "A: Well what kind of a celebration could it be? We were happy that we can be free people, go\nout and be a human being again. We are not in a camp any more, appeals any more, working\nconditions again and guards who are watching us all the time. This was the beauty part.",
        "A: Well in camp I couldn\u2019t stay too long. I was sick like a dog. I couldn\u2019t do anything. So sure\nenough my friend says to me you can\u2019t walk. I could barely walk. I take a little wagon. We put\nyou up and let\u2019s get out of the camp. We can\u2019t stay here.",
        "A: Yeah, a little bit older than Iam. So anyway he said I take you in a wagon and we take you\nout of here. So he went off. We came in. I tell you what he said. I, we going and find out if we\ncan get some transportation. To get out of here. So sure enough we come to an estate that was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nlike a governor\u2019s place, like the German governor. Lived in an estate, tremendous estate. Horses,\ncows, you name it and sure enough we come to the estate. We see the keeper of the estate. We\nask him a question, if we can borrow from him a horse and a wagon because we have some stuff\nin. We\u2019d like to take it out. He says sure. He was afraid because he knew what were done. He\nwas a German. So he gave us a horse and he gave us a wagon. So we took the horse and the\nwagon and we came back to the camp. We took up whatever we had left and we came back. We\nwanted to give him back the horse and the wagon. So as we came back to the estate, sure enough\nsilent, nothing. Just dogs barking all over the place. We couldn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.\nWe were afraid to go inside. Sure enough we go inside, we look in the barn where they have the\nhorses and things. Sure enough a whole rope hanging every, the governor and his wife and the\nkeeper and all the helps, they all hang themselves.",
        "A: So we were afraid to, we figure that the Russians would say that we did the one who hanged\nthem. So we went outside. We talk. I spoke to the Russian, one of the officers. I says officer we\ncame here to get the horse and wagon. We came into the barn. The next thing 1s I see all the\npeople hanging there. So he says to me where. So he comes in to me, he takes the machine gun.\nHe shoots down at them to make sure they are dead.\nAnd then he told us you can stay here and stay till you feel better and stronger and then you can\ngo your way. So let me tell you something. We were in the estate. They had, you name it, they\nhave it. Eggs, butter, cheese, clothes, shoes anything you can imagine. You could never believe\nwhat we saw, what happened over there. And we recuperated there because we were staying\nthere about six weeks to get ourselves back on our feet. But we were skeletons. I was 70 pounds.\nI could hardly walk so we were standing there for a couple of months to get \u2014",

        "A: I can\u2019t recall. I don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s like a governor lives here in Albany, they have the estate over\nthere.",
        "A: The who?",

So what\u2019s happened. He\ndid not bother us that we should go, we should leave or anything else. There was nobody in\ncharge. Except the Russian soldiers, that\u2019s all.",
        "A: We came to our senses. I mean to our energy a little bit. We walked out looking for relatives,\nlooking if we have living ones. Maybe somebody\u2019s alive. If somebody\u2019s still here. So we went,\neverybody went different directions and sure enough somebody told me, oh I saw your sister. Oh\nyou saw my sister? She was in a woman\u2019s camp. And sure enough we were united. I saw my\nsister.",

        "A: Everything in Germany.",
        "A: Yeah so sure enough because everybody was in camps, different camps. So sure enough, we\nwalked, walked. This one, question here, question there. Sure enough somebody told us they\nsaw our sister, the youngest one. She survived. Ok. As we go along. Sure enough we found her.\nAnd we were united. All her teeth were knocked out. She was toothless. Beaten up. Hardly walk\nand sure enough after this we decided we can\u2019t stay here. We have to go. So we went what you\ncall it to the DP camp. The DP camp was not too far from Frankfurt in Germany. And so we\nwent there to the DP camp. They gave us a place where to stay. They gave us food. They gave us\nclothes. They gave us all kind of things. And I can\u2019t recall the name even of the camp. Anyway,\nwe were there quite a while and I was there quite a while. And the next thing is people came\ntelling me that the sister was in the Polish papers, that they had that she is in Poland. You hear.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nSo sure enough I said where in Poland. So she told me in a small town in Poland and she\u2019s\nsupposed to be a director of a camp, of a Jewish camp, what you call it, sponsored by the United\nNations Relief organization. UNRO. So I said how can I get from Germany back to Poland? So\nI hired a smuggler to smuggle me across the border to be able to get to the Polish, to the Poland.\nSo sure enough I told my sisters, look here you stay here. I\u2019m going back to Poland and I will see\nif I can find her. I went back to Poland, I went back, paid the smuggler and he went to the p, to\nthe bridge. The bridge was lit up and the smuggler says you wait til the lights will get off and\nyou cross the bridge. And sure enough when the lights get off we all crossed the bridge and we\nwere on the other side. This was already Polish territory. As we went there to Polish territory,\nwe had to go and we kept on walking, walking, walking and the Polish, and this was through\nGerman occupied territory at one time. So sure enough the Polacks they show us, they say listen,\ndon\u2019t go walk down but the Polish people will grab you to work because the bombs what they\nwere ruined, they want that you probably grab you to work to fix it up. But we were afraid.\nWe\u2019re not afraid. We were just out from a concentration camp. So sure enough I was there with\nanother friend and as we were walking the Polish comes up, and the military. Says come over\nhere, he says to me. What are you talking about, I just came in Poland. I just came out from a\nconcentration camp. Me and my friend. I\u2019m looking for family. You want me to work now after\nI was spent so many years slavery and so on. Oh. He said listen and you go back to the town,\nthe first thing you got to do register with the military. You hear this. That\u2019s all they\u2019re interested\nin. To have another military.\nSo sure enough we went back to our town, to the town where my sister was.",
        "A: The town was, what did the call it. I'll come back to that. Anyway this was a town which\nwas another Jewish kids, orphans. They was there and she was the director of that camp. And\nsure enough I come into the town. I meet a friend of mine which I knew before the war, yes and\nhe was a privileged person. Why? He had a motorcycle. And a motorcycle. How come he got a\nmotorcycle? His aunt was a communist before the war. And after the war they rewarded a\nmotorcycle. The Polish government. So since he had the motorcycle, I says to my friend, listen\ncan you take me to the camp. I hear my sister\u2019s supposed to be there. Sure enough he took me to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nthe camp. And I come to the camp. It\u2019s empty. Nobody is there except the cook. I said, I found\nout that she\u2019s supposed to be here. So the cook came over to me and he said listen, your sister 1s\nhere but the Russians wanted to have a show. So they have out of town another part of town, all\nthe kids went over to perform in the show. So she\u2019s on the other side of the town. So sure\nenough I talked to my friend to take me over to the other place of town. He found out that I am\nalready in the camp where she is supposed to be. He walked over and I came over there and we\ncriss crossed. First. So sure enough we were united. After all the years.",

I have the papers because they sent me\nfrom the Holocaust museum the day where he was, what they tell him eshtomen, [ph] he died.\nYou know how they write. So I had the original paper from the Red Cross that he died particular\nday. My mother survived the war.",
        "A: In Auschwitz.",
        "A: Then I was united my sisters and my mother said before the war that we should all meet back\nin OSwiecim where we were born. Ok. So since we were already in the DP camp, and they went\nback to Poland so what\u2019s happened was that my sister says it\u2019s no use to go back to Poland. Anti-\nSemitism, the Russians told us don\u2019t go back because they will send you to Siberia. You never\nhave with them again. So we decided not to stay, not to go back and we decided to stay and wait\nuntil we bring them over to us. So we were staying what you call it in, in the DP camp and they\nwere in Poland. And they were in Poland. My sister and my mother and my sister got married in\nPoland to a Jewish man. And sure enough he, at that time, Poland allowed people to have a little\nbusiness. So he had a little business. And she went off. They did not allow the Jews to leave.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nAnd then it came an order and so my mother was elderly and she could leave. Well what\nhappened was so we arranged for somebody to sponsor my mother to America. But since my\nmother was crippled from the war. She could not walk so she wouldn\u2019t be able to get a visa to\ncome to America. So we decided maybe she cannot. They will allow her to come in. So we had\na woman, somebody who sponsored her as a maid to come back to Canada. So she went off. She\ngot the papers and meantime, as she go in for the papers. She was in Paris. She was in Paris at\ntransit and she was in Paris for over a year waiting to go in. And in Paris, in the meantime, she\nwas waiting. And finally she went in to Canada. She went to Canada. She was living there in\nvery harsh conditions. They were, the climate was bad and everything was bad. I couldn\u2019t go\nthere. Nobody could go there because we were not citizens. I mean I tell you how come we came\nto America later.\nSo what happened was that she was living in Montreal Canada. And Poland decided that Jews\ncan leave, not to America, no place else but to Palestine. At that time it wasn\u2019t Israel, was\nPalestine. So sure enough my brother in law and my sister picked their selves up and they went\nto Palestine. As they went to Palestine my mother had a chance to bring them over to Canada\nbecause mothers could bring in siblings back to their country. So mother arranged it and she\nbrought over my brother in law and my sister to Canada. And they remained in Canada and they\ndied in Canada.",

And my sister was acquainted with the fuhrer which my\nmother lived and she kept on telling her I have here a very good friend before the war and she\nhelped me a whole lot. And I like to help her. And she helped her a whole lot and she sent her\nfood over the border. Over the line and every time there was an appeal, a death appeal, she was\nnotified, the lager Fuhrer was notified. My sister that this 1s the appeal. So what happened was\nthey arranged it for her to put a uniform on her that she is what you call helping out cleaning out\nthe places and so on. So they did not take her to the death camp. And that\u2019s how she survived.",

And people died on the way over but somehow, some way for day and\nnight, they went til they came in to Gross-Rosen. When they came into Gross-Rosen they were\nliberated by the British.

We did not need papers, we didn\u2019t have visas. We can go in. if you register, you go. So my\nsister went and registered me and my sister and my brother in law and we all registered. And\nsure enough we came on the first boat who left Bremenhaven in Germany. And we left what you\ncall it, for America. And the name of the ship was Marine Fleisher. It was advertised in the\npapers. If you look up the New York Times you see my name and my sister\u2019s name come on\nthat boat. We have, we are registered on that. The New York Times says has what you call it a\nprint out of it.\nSo we came into America. I told you. I had two uncles living there before the war. Didn\u2019t I tell\nyou this before? My father wrote a letter to them. They could not, no appeal.\nSo sure enough as we came into the piers my uncles were standing there and waiting for us. And\nwe were very happy to come to America.

So what happened\nwas that he used to go to the mountains to bake for the summer. He used to go every summer, he\nused to go there. They called him up in a colony someplace in a hotel. And he was baking all\nkind of stuff. He was a baker by trade. So the apartment was empty because he took the family\nwith him. So my uncle arranged for us to stay in the apartment for the next two months because\nwhile he is away we can stay in his apartment. In Borough Park. So we stayed in the apartment\nat Borough Park. After two months we could not stay there any longer because we knew they\nare coming back so we had to look for an apartment. So we went all over the place looking. We\nfound an apartment on 242 Rivington Street on the Lower East Side. It was a, these houses were\nabandoned. They were closed up because they were deteriorated and so on. But since the war\nended, they needed places for the soldiers, for people to come to it to live. So they opened them\nup again. It was a walk up, three flight walk up and no hot water. The bathtub was in the\nkitchen. The toilet, excuse me, was 1n the hall and there was no -- steps of course going up there.\nSo the apartment at that time we rented, we paid about $12 a week.

So I went to the owner and said listen, I\u2019ve been working here for a while.\nI'd like to have a raise. So he gave me a two dollar raise. I says if this is what I\u2019m going to wait\nfor, forget about it. I could never get married. I could never have a family. I could never do\nanything. So what\u2019s happened?

        "A: No. As I see it, as it is now. The anti-Semitism is still here. It\u2019s hidden but it\u2019s still here. You\ncannot deny that it is not. Every time there is something. If a Jew does something, headlines are\ncoming up. If the Gentiles will do it, you didn\u2019t see this. I read a book now about Mr. Mark, the\noil man. I don\u2019t know if you read it or not. King of oil they call it. Did you read that book?",
        "A: The book is the King of oil. You know he was pardoned by Mr., by President Clinton.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: Mark Rich yes. I read the book now about him. The thing is if he wouldn\u2019t be a Jew you\nreally think for one minute they will go through the routine they go through. Do you know how\nmany swindlers and how many guys that do worse things than he did? And so he didn\u2019t do\nanything wrong but what happened 1s, still 1s, he\u2019s a Jew and remember that you cannot take it\nthis way, no matter what.",
        "A: Oh yes. Because we have to talk a lot. To begin with a lot of them are not here anymore.",
        "A: Well not exact. No, no not at all.",
        "A: I go to the meetings, I go to the places but I am not -- there is nothing yet left any more you\nsee. There is absolutely nothing. What is there? My people from my home town I don\u2019t, I can\u2019t\neven count them on one hand. And people from outside, I cannot connect with them because they\nhave different ways and they had, they suffered different ways too.",
        "A: Today, Auschwitz.",
        "A: When I hear the word Auschwitz, it puts what you call it, a chill in my body when I hear the\nword Auschwitz. Because I lived there and I knew the town and I knew the people in the town\nand I was like I told you. My father had a factory half a mile away from the camp. You talk\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nabout Poland. I am trying to claim some kind \u2014 I told you property. They would not give it back\nto me.",
        "A: One child.",
        "A: One grandson.",
        "A: Do I what?",
        "A: If I have a message?",
        "A: Well he is too young yet. He 1s only six years old.",
        "A: Of course I have a message. I am going to write a story about it so you should have it when he\ngets older to be able to read it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: I didn\u2019t. But I\u2019m going to sit down and write it. Because my sons they know and just to write\na book I wouldn\u2019t write a book about it. Who would be interested in my book anyway?",
        "A: The thing is if I mentioned the word Auschwitz, maybe they\u2019d be interested. If they see the\nheadline Auschwitz. I was born in Auschwitz, maybe they would be interested.",
        "A: Yes, of course. The best time was before the war.",
        "A: The best time, the best as a child.",
        "A: Yes, they are both college graduates and they went to yeshiva yes. And they pray every single\nday. Yeah they put the t\u2019fillen on and so on. They are religious. I mean they are not fanatics but\nmoderate.",
        "A: I tell you. It\u2019s a different ball game with the civil rights. You can\u2019t compare the civil rights,\nour civil rights. Our civil rights were taken away completely. In America the civil rights are not\ntaken away completely. They still have courts, they still have judges. They still have something.\nYou cannot just throw it out. You still have a chance to go into a court house and claim your\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\ncase. I didn\u2019t have this case. I never did. I could never go complain. I told you. I went to the\nteacher. He beat me up. You know what she told me. It didn\u2019t kill you. I mean this is the answer\nI get. Now how could I go and complain to anybody.\nYou\u2019re talking about the civil rights here. No comparison. I don\u2019t say they don\u2019t have their, they\nshouldn\u2019t have a civil right. They are entitled to all kind of things but to say that\u2019s not\ndiscrimination. I would say definitely there is. You still go. There is a woman here. She was a\ncook on tv and they fired here because she mentioned the word and that was the end of it. I mean\nit just shows you that it\u2019s still here, but the thing is people still can complain about it. And that\u2019s\nthe results and that\u2019s what happened. If you, if you come and out of the line then you going to be\npunished in a way, manually or prison, one or the other. You can\u2019t get away with something like\nthis because it\u2019s still a democratic country. A civilized country. People still listen to you. People\nstill go after you. I mean if you have some problems or so on. I did not have these kind of rights.\nSo that\u2019s why I love the United States. I like the constitution. \u2019m a good honest citizen. I follow\nall the rules and regulations because I love this country. This country gave me a home. This\ncountry made me a citizen. I am entitled to all kind of things that the people of the United States\nare. I can even run for office if I wanted to. I\u2019m a little bit too late, the age. So I can\u2019t do it\nanymore.",
        "A: Well the thing 1s this here when I came here, I had to live here five years to become a citizen.\nAnd before I became a citizen I had to know my senators are, who the court house is. What the\nSupreme Court is. How the constitution works and I had to bring two witnesses to testify in\nfavor of me that I am here and who I am and so on, so on. And today you don\u2019t have it any\nmore. They have a lot of immigrants that they came over, illegally and overnight they want to\nbecome citizens. I think that\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t believe \u2014 I went through five years to be a honest\ncitizen, to become a citizen. I think that everybody should have the same kind of thing what I\ndid. It shouldn\u2019t go when you come in, you go through the door and I want to be a citizen. I\nmean this country would be in ruins if this is the case. Every hoodlum is going to come in and\novernight he will become a citizen. But that I knock them in some way. They should work. They\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nshould do the same thing I did. To be honest about it. Work at it and become normal like\neverybody else does. This is the way I look at it.",
        "A: If I what?",
        "A: Yeah I have some, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah sure. They live in Cleveland, they live in different places. They don\u2019t live in some\ntown.",
        "A: Yeah I do, yes.",
        "A: Don\u2019t forget the people I am touch with are more my age. Nobody is a youngster.",
        "A: I lost my education. I lost my childhood. It was, it was unbelievable. I could have gone to\nschool. Maybe I could have become a lawyer, a doctor, a scientist, whatever. I lost it. I could not\ngo back after I came to the United States because I had to make a living. And nobody was going\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\nto give me anything. Nobody give me handouts. I came empty handed with no money at all.\nNothing, just the clothes on my back.",
        "A: If I did what?",
        "A: No. Like I said to you. My education stopped at 14. My yeshiva education, my school\neducation stopped at 15. Like I say to you, I went to night school here to pick up the language.\nAnd I think I speak ok.",
        "A: I want to tell you one thing. It\u2019s a very important thing that you took the interview. It\u2019s a very\nimportant thing for future generations to find out because things will be forgotten. It\u2019s a couple\nof years we die out. We\u2019re not here anymore and what, how else, how else would history be\ncontinued without having these kind of conversation of mine and from different people and films\nand so on. Because as you see it year after year, less and less people talk about the Holocaust.\nThe only time is the agencies and people like they were the Washington Memorial and so on but\notherwise you can see day in and day out less and less people think about it and there are a lot of\ndeniers that it never happened. You go into Iran, they deny it ever happened. You go into the\nArab countries, it\u2019s just a Jew propaganda. It never happened. I mean how can you talk to people\nif they don\u2019t even understand that things do, did happen because you don\u2019t deal to, 1n democratic\ncountries. You deal with animals all over. They only have one religion which is Moslem and\nthat\u2019s all they believe in. The Jews have no right to live. The Jews have no right to exist. They\ncome from pigs. They come from animals and so on. This is how they talk. So how can you talk\nto these people. The only one is that we as a people have obligated to keep on repeating over and\nover and over again so our children and our grandchildren can never ever forget. Yesterday we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013\ncelebrated the day of Tisha B\u2019 Av ok. Day of Tisha B\u2019 Av was 2000 years ago. The temple was\ndestroyed and other people were killed. Didn\u2019t know we still keep the date. We never forget it.\nWe still pray, we still fast, we still do it. And now in our case things little by little will be\nforgotten.",
        "A: I was there, yes. I have put on the computer my name and my family\u2019s name.",
        "A: If I came to the \u2014",
        "A: Oh a couple of years ago. It must have been about ten years ago.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s an important place because it\u2019s where the capital is. It\u2019s very important for people\nto come in and see what actually happened. Not everybody can go to Israel and go see Yad\nVashem. I was in Israel. I saw Yad Vashem. And here in Washington at least they have a\nchance to see \u2014 by the way in Auschwitz I also went to a place where they opened up a\nsynagogue and it\u2019s a huge synagogue. And I put my pictures from my sister and everything in\nthat synagogue.",
        "A: In the town yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: I went to the camp myself too. I show all the, the horror. I saw the crematorium. I saw the\ntallisen which are hanging there. I saw the suitcases. I saw the children\u2019s clothes and those\nclothes. I mean a million and a half children. A million \u2014",
        "A: If I did what?",
        "A: No, because there are no Jews there and all you see is Polacks all over the place. The streets\nare the same. The houses are the same but the thing is you have absolutely no connection to\nanybody. How could I have any feelings there? If at least I had one friend, I had one synagogue.\nI had one, one place I can go and say hello. Nobody, nobody. Don\u2019t forget this was after 60\nyears when I was there.",
        "A: Like what do you want me to tell you.",
        "A: Iam very thankful that you took my telephone and you took it on the machine and so on. At\nleast some memories will come out and some people will listen to it. Some people will have a\nlittle bit of feeling for it. Because like I say to you, our generation today is busy with jazz with all\nkind of things but this 1s something that\u2019s not in the daily routine. That\u2019s what I will say. So ?m\nglad that you have it at least on record that people at least will have a chance to listen to it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 17, 2013",
        "A: Ok, thank you very much.\n(end interview)\n"
