        "Question: Let me ask you first, Mrs. Karplus, if you could, say your name and where we are right\nnow, and we can say that the date is August 27\", 1997. And if you could say your name and\nwhere we are right now, and then we\u2019ll go from there, okay?",
        "Answer: I am Erna Karplus, and we are in my apartment on Beacon Street, in Brookline,\nMassachusetts.",
        "Q: Okay, that\u2019s August 27\", 1997.",
        "A: Sorry.",
        "Q: No, no, that\u2019s okay, I can add that. Well, I have many questions for you.",
        "A: I\u2019m so glad.",
        "Q: And I guess [Il start out by just asking you to talk and reflect a little bit about your childhood,\nand yo -- did you grow up in Vienna?",
        "A: I was born in Vienna, and I had three siblings. I was the youngest, and I lived in Vienna, but\nfrom \u201932 to \u201936 I was in Paris, and lived in Paris. And then I went back because I married a\nfriend of mine whom I knew only 11 years. So we decided to marry. And I loved to be in Paris,\nof course, it was a wonderful experience as a young Viennese. People liked the Viennese people.\nThey hated -- the French people hated the Germans, but they liked the Viennese, so I was lucky,\nand had a wonderful time. I was working there, because one could only take little money there. I\ncould live only three months of the money which I\u2019ve taken with me. So I started es -- I wanted\nto stay longer than three months, and I started as soon as possible to earn money to stay longer.\nAnd so I stayed longer, I went always in summer back to Vienna, and also f -- I went skiing, and\nmet my friends for Christmas, and then in summer I went also -- I really did a lot of\nmountaineering, summer and winter, fall and spring, all the time we were on the mountains as\nyoungsters.",
        "Q: Well tell -- tell me a little bit about that and growing up in Vienna again. What was it like\nbeing a child in Vienna? Do you -- was it -- was it a -- was it a -- a memorable childhood --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- do you remember many things? What are some of the things you remember most about\nyour childhood?",
        "A: Of course, first was school, and I was six years in the gymnasium where you learn Latin and I\nthink at that time we learned English there. I feel I had a very happy childhood. We had many\nfriends and it was of -- was, of course, very different to what\u2019s going on here. We didn\u2019t -- we\u2019re\nnot allowed to go in a nightclub, or outside. We always had some sis -- parties, some parties at\nhome, so that was with -- really lovely. We had a big apartment, and as we were four, we had\nmany friends, and we [indecipherable] parents loved also to entertain, so we had to always saw\nthe friends at home. My -- first, of course, I was not as much in the mountains, but when I grow\nup as a -- and had friends. If we -- if I say boyfriend, it does not mean like here that you sleep\nwith them. S-S -- ju -- it was everything very platonic, and -- but we had many friends, and with\nthem we went to theater, or to the concert, or weekend to the mountains. That\u2019s -- I loved the\nmountains, and the f -- a-and whether it was skiing or rock climbing, everything was lovely for\nus, and for me. Then, after my six years of gymnasium, I decided to become a photographer, and",
        "Q: How old were you then? How old were you?",
        "A: 16, probably.",
        "Q: 16.",
        "A: Just a minute. It was six, 11 -- no, seven, seven -- 17. Because five class -- five were ca --\npublic school, that means the lower classes, and then there for six years in the gymnasium, that\u2019s\n11 years, and you started with six years, so that was 17.",
        "Q: 17.",
        "A: And first I worked at a photographer, and then I went to a school where I learned about\nphotography and printing and so on.",
        "Q: And what pro -- what drew you into -- what attracted you to photography?",
        "A: I think it\u2019s -- we always have taken pictures, and then I met somebody, a photographer, who\ntalked about it, and suddenly I decided I\u2019d rather to go two more years and to make my\n[indecipherable] as to go to study photography. But then, I admit my -- it was called master exam\nfor photography, it\u2019s not like here master. I was first an apprentice. It goes like -- I don\u2019t know\nhow you call it here, you know? And then I made my master for photography, and I worked at\nthe photographer. Then -- I always have taken exercises. Not only me, everyone in Vienna had,\nMother and everyone has taken exercises, and my teacher said, you\u2019re so gifted, why don\u2019t you\nstudy to be an exercise teacher? So I propose this to my father, who was horrified. You never\nwill need to work, you will marry and never will need to work again. And now you have\nphotographer, for what do you want to study to be a exercise teacher? Luckily, my brother-in-\nlaw, Dr. Felix Fleischner talked for me, he was all for it, said I st-study what I want, and luckily\nFather agreed. He had to agree because one has to pay, of course. And I studied to be a phot --\nexercise teacher and got my diploma in Vienna.",
        "Q: When was this, approximately?",
        "A: The diploma, ach, I have it somewhere. Let me think. Six, 17, that was [inaudible] 24 - 25,\nprobably \u201929.",
        "Q: \u201929?",
        "A: Nine, cause --",
        "Q: What year were you born, by the way?",
        "A: Seven.",
        "Q: 1907?",
        "A: In seven, yes.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: Yes, I will have my 90\" birthday this year in November. I can\u2019t believe it.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t look like you\u2019re about to have your 90\" birthday.",
        "A: No, I will look like 102, but I am not. Anyway, then, when I made my diploma, I worked for\n[indecipherable] photography, and I worked as an exercise teacher, after I have the diploma. In\nVienna you have to have a diploma, not like here that everyone can put out her shingle without\never learned anything. And also, where you teach, it was -- somebody came to look whether it 1s\nthe proper place to teach. Whether it\u2019s clean enough, whether it has the shower and so on. [phone\nringing]",
        "Q: Do you need to get that?",
        "A: [indecipherable] [tape break] -- is not a nurse, but she was with my sister [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Ah, I see.",
        "A: And she calls sometimes, see how everything is.",
        "Q: Ah, oh. Okay.",
        "A: Is settle. Do you have it on?",
        "Q: Yes. Do you want me to turn it off? [tape break]. Continuing. Go ahead.",
        "A: I love to teach exercises, and too, I was very happy to start in Vienna with it, and I was also\nteaching like we have here, the st -- ca -- for instance, the Cambridge Center for Adult\nEducation. So there were in Vienna [indecipherable] which were really started to make\ngrandfather of the brother-in-law of mine, of Hartman, and I was teaching, for instance in the\nLuderhatte mon volksheim. And I probably did not work the whole day from morning evening,\nthat I don\u2019t remember, but I enjoyed to work, and to do things and of course weekend we always\nwent away, a group of people. We were several who always met in the train and we went\nsomeplace. Then, in \u00b032, I got the chance to go to Paris. It was -- as I say, it was three months. I\nhad some money and I loved to go to Paris, also to practice my French. We had always as\nchildren, when we were young, we had a governess very long, and then a French teacher, who\nwent also with us at -- in summer for vacation. I think she learned more German than we learned\nFrench, but it was a possibility to learn French. And so I went to Paris, but --",
        "Q: Well yeah, okay, that\u2019s fine. We -- we can -- let -- let me just ask you one specific thing about",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- about Vienna when you were a child. You know, in doing some reading about the history of\nanti-Semitism in Austria, there is quite a bit of history going back to long before you were born,\nand I\u2019m just wondering, y-you\u2019re describing us a ch -- an -- a nice, a pleasant childhood, do --\ndid you -- were there things when you were a little girl, I mean, before the anschluss that you\nnoticed? I mean, were there -- did your grandfather have problems, did your parents have\nproblems, did you have any problems?",
        "A: Never. Never. We had always also some Gentile friends, who went with us to mountains, we\nwere invited. Everything went -- we -- I never felt an anti-Semitisms. I -- i-in fact grew up, my\nfather was very religious. I was not allowed to write on Saturday at school, we had school at\nSaturday. And there was another girl who was not allowed to write. So there were never given\nwritten examinations on Saturday because we didn\u2019t write. But there was never -- I never felt any\nanti-Semitisms as long we were there, til Hitler came. We were very lucky this way, we had\nalways, as I say, Gentile friends, and in fact, our Jewish friends had very nice Gentile friends\nwhom they married after Hitler to -- to go out with them. That -- to emigrate with them. So we\nwere really a mixed group. More Jews than Gentile, but we were mix and I never suffered.",
        "Q: Did you hear of anyone, any Jewish friends or -- or acquaintances, or even people you had\nheard about who had a problem?",
        "A: Only, for instance at the university. It was very hard for my brother-in-law, who was an x-ray\ndoctor, Roentgenologist. He was only [indecipherable] and not -- could not become professor.\nThen there was, at the university, a Jewish professor, m-my husband\u2019s uncle was professor of\nneurology. But that was really seldom that a Jew got a professorship. That I knew, that I heard.\nBut otherwise I really never personally felt it, that the anti-Semitism was -- I knew it was there,\nbut I didn\u2019t feel it. I didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: Ho-How did you know it was there? How di -- how were you --",
        "A: For instance, about this university, and then, now I try to think. I really -- I don\u2019t remember\nanything special before Hitler --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- that is -- but I d -- I knew that there is anti-Semitisms. I try to remember, but I don\u2019t know,\nI\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: Were there stories, Mrs. Karplus, at that time of -- of Jewish families wanting to assimilate\nand in some cases actually convert? Wa-Was there -- were there conversions to Christianity\ngoing on 1-in the desire to assimilate, or --",
        "A: No, not much. No, except that many, many who were not at all religious. For instance, we\nthree sisters married three men who were not at all religious, but they -- they didn\u2019t convert, I\nmean, and my husband said always for a joke he would never convert. Maybe, if he would fall in\nlove with a woman, then he would co -- he would convert, but no-nobody I knew. That doesn\u2019t\nsay it didn\u2019t exist, but nobody I knew converted. We all -- they assimilated really, very much.\nMy father came what was afterwards Poland, at that time when he was born it was still Austria.\nBut he was very religious, and that was really seldom that si -- si -- that one is so religious. More\n-- all my friends were really assimilated, and not at all -- and had Christmas tree.",
        "Q: So they weren\u2019t practicing or observant in that -- in that sense.",
        "A: Yeah, but re -- Christmas tree didn\u2019t mean to us a Catholic festivity. It was --",
        "Q: M-More of a cultural",
        "A: -- cultural, yeah.",
        "Q: -- or a national --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Mm-hm.",
        "A: [indecipherable] again and again. And so, for instance, all of my in-laws had Christmas trees,\nand my -- and my mother-in-law, everyone had. But -- but we did not have it at home, because\nFather was Jewish religious, so we didn\u2019t have it. In fact we had a kosher house, and we kept it\nas youngster, but then, more and more, we kept it less. But at first real -- we really ke -- were --\nalso tr-tried to do everything my father and mother wanted to do. We kept all the -- for -- for\ninstance, all the holidays, Jewish holidays at home. So, as a youngster, I really did not suffer by\nanti-Semitism, was -- and we were very lucky probably, our group of people, because we were\nmix in, as I said. Two of my very good friends had Gentile friends and then they married them,\nso s -- they went together out from the -- Austria.",
        "Q: And when you were a child with your -- with your father being o-observant, did you belong to\na synagogue?",
        "A: We went to synagogue when the parents were there, to visit, of course. We visited Mother,\nbecause it was -- sometime it was also separated, the men and the women in -- in one of the\ntemple after [indecipherable] not. So we always went there to visit Mother, when she was af --\nthere. Father was probably more in the temple than Mother, but Mother also observed with --\nwith Father, and -- but a-as a little child, I felt also religious, but then less and less.",
        "Q: And how did -- what -- what kind of feeling was that as a little child, to -- to be religious as a\nchild? Do you remember the feeling you had?",
        "A: It was -- I try to remember. It was quite of course, to go up as a little, little one with it. You\nknow, it was quite of course that we thought like our parents were thinking. And this was so\ntradition to have all the holidays. And at -- probably felt myself religious because I wouldn\u2019t\nhave touched what wasn\u2019t allowed, for instance, ham. I wouldn\u2019t touch. I would not, never as a\nyoungster, eat what I was not allowed to eat for the religious reason.",
        "Q: So that everything was kosher in your family?",
        "A: Yeah, in my family, my family, but not -- one friend of my sister\u2019s family was also kosher,\nbut otherwise all our friends were not religious at all, brought up. They were conscious Jews, I\nthink, but not religious. In general, they were very assimilated, really. We all felt Viennese, and\nnot Jewish Viennese. We didn\u2019t emphasize the Jews in -- but we felt very Viennese, of course,\ngrowing up there, and living there, and we loved Vienna. So, I am sorry I can\u2019t say -- I mean, I\nthink I only accepted what my parents expected from us children.",
        "Q: What many children --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- most children do.",
        "A: At that time. And then, afterwards, I mean when I was maybe 16 or 17 years old, I -- I felt\ndifferent. I felt that it is really some of the things I didn\u2019t want to accept. For instance, I wasn\u2019t\nallowed to ring the bell when I came home the apartment. To me it was much more work to\nknock than ringing the bell like that.",
        "Q: Was this every day, or just on Shabbat?",
        "A: Every day. We were not allowed to ring the -- oh, excuse me, that -- that was a good question\nof you and a bad answer of me. It -- yes, it probably was only si -- as -- as -- as -- Saturday\nShabbes, you are right. It was not the whole week.",
        "Q: But -- but 1t mu-must have seemed like more, because you remembered it as every day, right?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, you know, it is a few years ago, so --",
        "Q: A couple of years.",
        "A: -- it\u2019s [indecipherable] and my memory doesn\u2019t get better. I mean, my si -- one sister had the\nwonderful memory and I never had the good memory and it didn\u2019t get better.",
        "Q: Well, it seems pretty good to me.",
        "A: No, no, it didn\u2019t get better.",
        "Q: Well, let -- let me ask you a little bit about -- now, your -- your father and -- and his work, and\n-- and did his work allow you all to have a -- a comfortable lifestyle --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- or was it a difficult one?",
        "A: Most of the time father -- we had the very good life. We had piano lessons and basic French\nand the English, and the -- and Mother had every day a hairdresser coming, and everything --\nthat was like that in Vienna. So we had --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, and domestic help, did you have --",
        "A: And dom -- of course --",
        "Q: Maids and cooks?",
        "A: -- two domestic help. We had the lovely apartment we had and that means we moved from a\nsmaller apartment to a bigger apartment. You had to buy the apartment and Father could do it.\nAnd he really gave us all the opportunities to learn and to come and go. He was not delighted\nthat I spent so much money when we went skiing when I was older. When -- I went skiing\nbecause that cost money, the train. And there he was not -- he thought that I spend too much\nmoney on the -- for the train, for the -- but to me it was important. And my future husband, who\nwas always with us, had in fact a ticket for nothing because he had the high pos-position in the\nnewspaper. So he had, for all the trains, if he wanted first class, to go first class, wherever he\nwanted, he had the ticket. So for birthday I got sometimes tickets, so to go, so to be able to go\nevery weekend, and I did.",
        "Q: And did you all travel, did you take vacations abroad, or did you --",
        "A: Always. When we were small, Mother went with us vacation. We went to -- first years always\nto Salzburg, because Mother\u2019s parents lived there, and we went for summer and also Christmas,\nwe went to Salzburg for our vacation. Close by -- to Salzburg was a suburban place, and there\nthe parents rented the house, so we went always to this house in Salzburg. And the most exciting\nwas that we were there at the beginning when Reinhardt started to have the place in Salzburg,\nbecause now it is quiet, of course, but my brother was in one of the place, and very little role so\nwe could always go to all the [indecipherable] rehearsals. So it was wonderful, we knew all then,\nall the li -- wonderful actor and actresses. And that was the first year that was played\n\u2018\u201cJedermann\u201d\u2019, by Hoffner -- by Hofmannsthal. Hofmannsthal was a Viennese and \u201cJedermann\u201d\nwas a play by him and it was played in front of the beautiful church, a lovely, lovely church. And\nwe were very proud, of course that our brother was of the stage. We were very young. So\nSalzburg was important. Afterwards we went to Italy with Mother, and we went to -- where else?\nWe -- fit -- Italy several times, and always to a beach to swim. And in the year 1914, we were,\nfor instance in Italy at the beach in Carrado, and then we saw a man going with a drum on the\nbeach, and we children, I was six and a half years -- we children were delighted, but in reality, he\nannounced that the war broke out. 1914 til \u201918 was the war. So, of course, Mother was in despair\nonly to get home. All she wanted, to get home.",
        "Q: And so this -- you thought this man was making nice music?",
        "A: Yeah, that -- that was lovely for a child, a drum, to go with the drum, and I had no idea, of\ncourse, what it was, and then Mother tried to explain to us. But then it was the first World War,\n14 to \u201918, and Austria was, up to then very big, and then it is -- became a very little country,\nbecause Hungary left many Romanian born a -- so many countries were taken, were occupied by\nthe -- by the [indecipherable]. Austria became a small -- a small country. But st -- during the war,\nof course, we suffered very much.",
        "Q: During World War I?",
        "A: Just awful.",
        "Q: And how is that -- tell me about that.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t get to eat, and you had to stand 1n line for hours to get, I don\u2019t know how many\neggs, maybe two eggs. And we children went all after school, always standing in line. And often\nwe had the same dresses, but then we had to be different so that nobody knew that there are three\npeople of a family who wanted to have eggs or meat or bread, I don\u2019t know any more what all,\nwe had to stand in line. And -- but really for hours.",
        "Q: And now -- but your family was well off --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and yet you still had to stand in line?",
        "A: No -- yeah, nobody ha -- nobody h-had the possibility. Sometimes we got from a uncle, from\nMother\u2019s brother, who was in the military, an officer, but that was not only in the war, he was by\nch-choice for his life, you know, he went to military academy and so on. Sometimes he came and\nbrought us something special to eat. We had only one vegetable, for instance, all that we got for\nwithout standing in line. It was called rote and it is a kind of beet. I still have the feeling, the taste\nof it, because we ate every day this beet.",
        "Q: When\u2019s the last time you had one of those beets?",
        "A: But no, I eat a little better.",
        "Q: But -- but you -- you haven\u2019t -- I was asking you, I wondered if you\u2019ve had any of those beets\nsince then. I bet you haven\u2019t wanted to taste them.",
        "A: No, never. Never. Never. I don\u2019t know whether they are here, I really don\u2019t --",
        "Q: And you don\u2019t want to find out.",
        "A: No, I\u2019m -- no, I\u2019m not curious.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: It was really ec -- so that was very hard. Then, we had no shoes, we had wooden shoes only,\nthere was no leather. And I [indecipherable] my feet very much with these wooden shoes,\nbecause they were so heavy on my skin.",
        "Q: So even pe-people or families with means like yours --",
        "A: Means.",
        "Q: -- was as -- as 1f you were poor.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, everyone was the same. That\u2019s it, we co-couldn\u2019t get really enough to eat. It was\nvery, very hard.",
        "Q: Do you remember going to bed hungry as a child?",
        "A: No, that I don\u2019t remember, because we surely got the roten, the -- the beets. I don\u2019t remember\nthat I was -- went hungry. But not -- it was not a pleasure to eat, this was -- we t -- 1t was not\nmuch there to eat. Yes, anti-Semitisms I met for the first time in Salzburg, that reminds me.\nWhen we went to Salzburg, there was a horrid paper. It was called Der Sturm, that means storm.\nAnd it was awfully anti-Semitic. And there it was written the family from Albert Pollack, he was\n-- he had many, many things [indecipherable] and he was high up, you know, from the -- to --\nvery, very appreciated, he was an [indecipherable] and he was very appreciated in Salzburg then.\nIt\u2019s hoefe is -- means -- it\u2019s aristocrats. And there was written the family from Vienna ca-came\nand eat and ate and ate, and they\u2019ve taken us all the food away.",
        "Q: O-Okay.",
        "A: [indecipherable] accent whatsoever.",
        "Q: You were saying, taking all the food away.",
        "A: Food",
        "Q: The food away.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. And that -- so, and that\u2019s interesting because there were many Jews in Vienna, but not\nvery many in Salzburg, right?",
        "A: There weren\u2019t in Salzburg. My -- my grandfather, for instance [indecipherable] his brother,\nhis sister to come. They were in Austria.",
        "Q: Oh, no thank you.",
        "A: But you tell me.",
        "Q: Okay, I will, thank you.",
        "A: Is -- they were in Austria, all, and he ask them to come because he loved Salzburg. And I\ndon\u2019t know whether you know grandfather was a military in Salzburg and loved it, and then he --\nwhen he got through with his military, he rented an apartment and a little shop. And then he was\ncalled to that -- it was some -- I think some Catholic high one who was in charge for Salzburg,\nand say, don\u2019t you know, no Jew is allowed to settle in Salzburg? You have to leave right away,\nand -- and leave your apartment and shop. So grandfather went away, and talked to the military\nfor whom he worked -- not worked, for whom he was with, and they liked him very much and\nappreciated him because he was a very good man. And they talked to this archbishop or whoever\nhe was, and he called grandfather and say -- said come. You are granted to live here, but you will\nbe the only Jew. But grandfather did not si -- maybe you have it, grandfather, after a little while\nhis sister came, his brother came and so on. And then came more and more and more Jews to\nSalzburg. And he was wonderful because he was fighting for everything. They had no rabbi --\nrabbi there. Rabbiner in German. Rabbi is English, isn\u2019t it? They had no rabbi there, he had to\ncome. They had no kosher meat for people who wanted kosher meat. So he had to -- everything\nto arrange. There was no temple, and when they wanted to buy some acres to build the temple,\nthey were not allowed to buy it for that, for temples they were not allowed to buy. Then -- but\none Jew had grounds and said he want to build a temple there, and then it was permitted, if it 1s\nnot on the side -- close to the sidewalk.

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah, in summer I went there. And I was there three months, th -- I had only money for three\nmonths, so -- and I loved to stay longer, of course I had to ask for the permission of my parents\nbecause I was too young, I was 24 and a half. That was for Vienna young, and I had to get\npermission. And I went from one photographer to the next one, whether they want to have me.\nFinally, I found one who said yes, a German, if I type French, English and German letters. I said\nI\u2019m willing to type, but I can only type with two fingers. But you don\u2019t have to pay me for the\novertime, because I need to -- so I worked for him, and that was in spring, I remember. And then\nI was very lucky, one day he was sick and so I had to go out to take a photograph, which was on\na magazine on the -- on the top, how do you call it?",

        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I worked for him, and then came a friend to Paris, who was really a friend of my older\nsister, who was already married at that time. And for him I was always the little Erna, but when\nhe saw me in Paris I was grown up, and he fell in love with me. And he lived in -- in Spain, and\nhe say, please come and t -- and it\u2019s so beautiful in Spain, Madrid and so on. So I went to Madrid\nand spent also some weeks somewhere on a beach, but alone. And I went on the beach and didn\u2019t\nknow, I saw always men behind me. And then I learned one can\u2019t go as a woman alone on a\nbeach, that means one invites the men. And I had no idea, of course. So of -- I stopped to walk\non the beach alone, yeah. I had no -- I didn\u2019t know that. And then I went back to Paris and there I\nmet at -- my phot -- [indecipherable] photographer, a very nice young lady, who also invited me\nto go boating with them and so on. And I wanted to start now with exercises to teach. So I looked\nfor a place where I can rent it for one hour or so, invited some people, invited some people to\nwatch, and so I started to teach exercises in Paris. And I earned enough money to live there\ncomfortable, made very good friends. And as I say, the French people were charming to me, and\nvery nice, and as I loved to teach, and always asked, every year when I came back to -- before I\ncame back in summer to the parents, I always say please, can there be another year? So I was\nfour years there. I always had two months at least vacation, and then I\u2019ve taken another studio\nagain, where I was teaching. And then in -- four years later, in ni -- 1-in \u201936, my husband\nproposed that we should marry. So I always loved him, so it was easy for me to say yes.",
        "Q: Where were you at the time?",
        "A: In Paris. He wrote me every second day, a shorthand letter. His family, Karplus, always wrote\nonly shorthand to each other, so I had to learn shorthand before I left, but I wasn\u2019t as fluent. And\nas he wrote me every second day, I -- I was already -- the second day I wasn\u2019t ready for the next\nletter. And so I went back to Vienna, but my pupils were terrific, when I said I will marry I got\nthe most beautiful wedding gifts in Paris already, from my friends and pupils.

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: He was born in Vienna, and his father was a lawyer and my husband studied also law, but not\nto be a lawyer, only to be a good executive. To be a lawyer in Vienna at that time you had to\nstudy law, then to be seven years in a law firm before you\u2019re allowed to be a lawyer, to open up\nyour own office.

        "A: Very much. Everyone liked him. During the time I was away they were all the time in touch\nwith him, and in fact he helped one of my sisters who had a -- opened a -- for children, a nurser -\n- nursery, and he helped her. They were always in touch with each other, and they all liked him.\nAnd then we were there til \u201938.",

        "Q: Please, yeah, let\u2019s talk about that.",
        "A: He -- he was the head of a big publishing house and that he became, in Vienna it was called\ndirector, if you are the head of. Here you call it publisher. There were five daily newspapers,\nthen there were six or seven weekly newspapers, and books were published. There were 800\npeople and he was the head of it. He did not write himself, never, but he was the head of the --\nchief editor and [indecipherable] of all the ones who wrote, and he, of course ha-had decided\nabout the salary and things like that. Besides of [indecipherable] that he became in *36, and\ntherefore he decided to marry, because he had a very high salary, and said now we can live very\nwell together, and I can take care of you. In Vienna one married only til the husband could take\ncare of the wife. One didn\u2019t expect to work -- that she was working. And so th-therefore, when\nhe became the head -- he was not the head first, he was under the director, I wa -- he wrote me to\nmarry. And of course, when -- should I tell you now when Hitler came?",
        "Q: Yes, you --",
        "A: Or not yet?",
        "Q: Well, let -- let me just ask you one more question about -- about leading up to -- well, what\nwas the climate there -- and I guess this get -- leads into the question a-a-about when Hitler\ncame, did you feel when you came back after four years that the atmosphere, in terms of people\u2019s\nattitudes towards Jews, and the anti-Semitism had changed? Did you notice a difference?",
        "A: No, but I have to say that some people were amazed that we -- that I went back to Vienna,\nbecause they were afraid what will be. And my husband -- my husband said he n -- he would not\nleave his wonderful position, which was interesting for him, of course, and he would not leave\nvoluntarily. But there was some people who said, why did you come back? And for me it was a\ngood reason to come back, to marry my husband.",
        "Q: Well, what gave you the idea, or what was it that people said that gave you an idea that it\nwasn\u2019t good to come back?",
        "A: Said that -- that Hitler is in Germany, and somehow they were afraid that he will really c-\ncome to -- also to Austria and so on.",
        "Q: And what did you know about Hitler in 1936, and wh --",
        "A: I knew --",
        "Q: -- what were you afraid of [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- that -- I knew -- I knew about Hitler because I had friends in Germany, for instance.\n[sneezes |",
        "Q: Bless you.",
        "A: Excuse me. Who came to Paris to bring money, that I take care of money, because they knew\nthat they will eventually leave there. So I knew that in Germany it went on, but nothing 1s\natrocities like afterwards. I had no idea. But I knew that Germany, he is against Jews, but they\nwere not yet deported like later. In \u201933, he started in Paris -- in Germany. So people were what --\nwhat -- probably afraid in Austria that -- and ask me why I came back, and considered to come\nback. They were amazed. But, as I see, my husband said he would not leave voluntarily his job,\nhis interesting job. And I loved to come back to Vienna. I loved Paris, of course, very much, and\n-- but I enjoyed to come back to Vienna because it was really my birthplace, and where I spent so\nmany years.",
        "Q: Were there times during those years, from \u00b036 to \u201938 before the anschluss that -- that you did\nfeel uncomfortable or -- or frightened?",
        "A: No, I never felt frightened, and really it was a big surprise, the -- when Hitler marched -- not\nhe marched in, but the SS men marched in. It was a big surprise for all of us, and Schuschnigg,\nwho was our president spoke on the television to say good-bye.",
        "Q: On the ra -- on the tel -- not the television, on --",
        "A: Not television --",
        "Q: -- on the radio.",
        "A: -- the radio. Excuse me.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Now itt is -- television is so handy. No, it was on the radio that he said good-bye, he has to\ngive in, he can\u2019t fight. And th-that was a horror, of course, for all of us. It was a surprise.\nSomehow one feared it, but it was a surprise when it happened.",
        "Q: Tell -- tell me about the -- the feeling that you remember, maybe, if you do remember the\nfeeling at that time when he rat -- actually came to power, and what kinds of conversations were\ngoing on in your family at that time.",
        "A: But in Germany was far enough for us, you know? We had also relatives in Germany, my\nmother\u2019s sister and children were there. And -- but it was so f -- Germany was far for us, and at\nthat time it was -- he didn\u2019t start right away as horrid as he did afterwards. Even in Austria, I\nmean he started awful, but the horrid atrocities came later, much later. And --",
        "Q: Wh-What -- what was it about Hitler in 1936 and 1937, before Kristallnacht, and before the\nanschluss --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- that made you be fearful of him, or -- or -- or not --",
        "A: Yeah, not secure --",
        "Q: -- certainly not want him to come to power.",
        "A: -- let us say not sec --",
        "Q: Not secure, okay.",
        "A: -- not secure. But we saw -- we spoke very little about it, I have to say, and we were not really\nso much afraid of it that we expected it. We didn\u2019t expect it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Right.",
        "A: But some people were afraid of it. I mean, my family didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: But -- but you knew something about him.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What was it that you knew about him?",
        "A: Just that h-he\u2019s ridiculously anti-Semitic, and want to have only the blonde, blue-eyed people.\nOh, I have blue eye. And that he wanted only to have won the race, that the Jews are impossible,\nthat we\u2019re all Jew.",
        "Q: And how did you know this, from reading the --",
        "A: Well, reading, probably --",
        "Q: -- just from reading the newspapers, or listening to the radio?",
        "A: -- in the newspapers, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I si -- don\u2019t think we listed so much to the radio as we do here now. I think we\u2019re g -- read\nnewspapers, and I had plenty newspapers at home from my husband, [indecipherable]\nnewspapers.",
        "Q: So when the anschluss took place, when the Nazis came to power in Austria, you said that it\nwas a shock. What kinds of conversations was -- were you having with your family at that time,\nonce the anschluss st --",
        "A: What should we do? Th-That was the first, everyone, what should we do, what can we do?\nThat was the first reaction, of course, of all of us. It was on a Friday evening and we were at my\nparent\u2019s, but my husband was not yet there.",
        "Q: Was he still at work?",
        "A: A-At his work, at his office, because two SS men came. The moment they marched in, two SS\nmen went to the office, took my husband, with a letter addressed to Dr. Richard Karplus from\nBerlin to give his office to the two SS men who hand him the letter. Of course they had no idea\nwhat to do. It was prepared already because the newspaper was important, a democratic\nnewspaper, and so many newspaper in his firm who -- which came out, you know? So everything\nwas prepared from Berlin, that he should pa -- give over.",
        "Q: Because he was Jewish?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: Of course, but -- but what -- let me ask you a naive question, how did they know on the day\nthat they m -- took power in Austria that, presumably many other people including your husband\nwere Jewish and -- and owned property or factories, and they would have these letters ready.\nHow -- how would they know that?",
        "Q: I do -- that, I don\u2019t know how they found out, but probably newspaper was very important,\nbecause a newspaper brought the news, and they didn\u2019t want that it is against them, you know?\nThat I can understand, that they really had the aim to stop Jews to be at the top of newspapers,\nyou know? That was obvious, because the newspapers give you the news and they can be\ndifferently brought.",
        "Q: Now, when you say differently brought, do you mean like different kinds of perspectives\ndepending --",
        "A: Yeah, perspective, we se --",
        "Q: -- on the political --",
        "A: -- we he -- see -- see it here, how the republicans --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and the democrats [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Well, did -- were there newspapers that were publishing ideas about, you know, a Jewish\nconspiracy and these kinds of things at that --",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: So there wasn\u2019t that kind of --",
        "A: No, not at all.",
        "Q: -- Fascist --",
        "A: Not at all. In the newspapers were the news, I\u2019m sure about -- about Hitler, all these years,\nyou know, that we learned about what\u2019s going on in Germany, and -- but 1t was never in these\npapers how it was -- there was a single Jewish newspaper, but I -- I don\u2019t remember to have seen\nit, really, and so I don\u2019t know. But I can understand that the newspaper were in aim to stop right\naway to write how horrid Hitler is here, you know? They wanted to avoid that -- this.",
        "Q: So you mean -- you -- you were -- you\u2019re saying that they did not want to write about how\nterrible Hitler was --",
        "A: Yeah, see --",
        "Q: -- because the Nazis were coming to power in Austria and they didn't want to --",
        "A: Yeah, I mean --",
        "Q: -- get their presses confiscated, or --",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] the Germans didn\u2019t want that the newspapers write badly about the\nGermans, and to influence people. So that -- so they were really anxious to get it out of the hand\nof the Jew. But my husband stayed still 10 days, because he said he is the captain, he -- the\npeople, of course -- 800 people lost all their heads, whether they were Jewish or not Jewish.",
        "Q: When you say they lost their heads --",
        "A: Tha -- lost their head, that is probably German [indecipherable]",
        "Q: For -- for being -- lo-losing their jobs?",
        "A: Y-Yeah, not only losing their jobs, but that Hitler came in. That we are no more Austria.",
        "Q: They lost their heads, they were -- they were --",
        "A: We are no more Austrians, but not all of them, it was a mixed group. There were many non-\nJews. For instance, the secretary of my husband. My husband called me up at my parent\u2019s and\nsaid, Erna, don\u2019t walk alone at home. One doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I send you my\nsecretary. And the secretary has taken, in the moment the SS men came to my husband, he has\ntaken out the -- you know, h-he was a Nazi. He was -- his secretary was in the party already, the\nNationalistic party.",
        "Q: And did your husband know that?",
        "A: No idea. But he offered to come to take me home, because he had the -- how do you call it,\nyou know, the party insignia.",
        "Q: Was it a -- was it a swastika at that time?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It was a swastika?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: For [indecipherable] Austria [indecipherable]",
        "A: And so -- and so he sent me him, that he walks me home. He was a -- very devoted to my\nhusband, and that was again and again afterwards. Though you are a Jew, I love you.",
        "Q: So he was a member of the party, but he didn\u2019t have anything against you, at that time.",
        "A: No, not against my husband, he wrote us and -- afterwards. He -- because he appreciated my\nhusband as a person, you know. And said -- but that was not only with my husband, one heard it\nvery often. I love you, though you are a Jew. But t -- all the Jews are, of course, horrid, but you\nare not horrid.",
        "Q: When did you start hearing that kind of thing?",
        "A: After Hitler, of course, after Hitler. And also, I mean, I saw it with as -- a -- also the secretary\nwas also not Jewish -- of -- of my husband. I\u2019d say all -- I\u2019d say -- not all, but they wrote all the\ntime to my husband afterwards, because a -- as a person they liked him, it was only bad luck that\nhe was a Jew. And he stayed this evening very long in th -- in the office, so to calm down the\npeople, the reporters and everyone. And then he came home, and that I remember distinctly. It\nwas very late probably, and we walked up and down in the big living room, you know, what\nshould we do, what should we do. And we were very lucky, we got -- we had friends in America\nwho send us telegram whether we want affidavit. We got letters from Paris from the lady who\nhas taken over my studio, that my pupils want to have me back, and I ha -- I have right away a\njob. The friends from Paris wrote me, they want to have me back. I wanted to go to Paris, but my\nhusband, who was very intelligent, said, Erna, let us only once emigrate. Paris will be also a\nvictim of Hitler. And he was so right. So we thought about America, a little about Australia. But\nmy husband read always English, and knew so much about Boston, for instance, so we -- we\nwanted to go really to amer -- we decided. And then I started to go to the different embassies to\nget the visas, you know, to get the visa to go to France, and to Switzerland, to go through the\ndifferent lands. And the French sent us an affidavit so we could really -- we could really go to\nAmerica.",
        "Q: Okay now, let me --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: Okay, this is s-side A of tape two with Mrs. Karplus, our interview continues. Mrs. Karplus,\nyou were just talking about emigrating to America, but I -- I'd like to back up a little bit to that --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- night that you and your husband were pacing back and forth in the living room.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And talking about what to do. I-I just want to ask you to r-recall as many specifics about that\nas you can. I mean, did you suddenly feel like your whole world was going to be changed?",
        "A: Yeah, yes, yes. Of course. We felt awful to leave our homeland, and we were -- we were\nborn, where we were so many years. It was a horrid s -- moment to think one has to leave that --\nwe were in the lovely apartment almost not two years, and made so many changes there, and\nbuilt lovely [indecipherable] there. And so many things we did. It was an awful thing to think to\nleave, but the luckiest thing was that we were two. We did it for each other. Alone, I would have\nbeen much more lost fo -- to do it for myself. But I had the feeling I do it for my husband and he\ndid it for me, not to collapse. So we were really ve -- horridly, of course, upset and unhappy. And\nwhat to do? That was the big question for everyone.",
        "Q: Now, this was back in -- in March of 1938?",
        "A: 736 -- \u00b038, yeah --",
        "Q: \u201938, March of --",
        "A: -- excuse me, \u00b030 si -- yeah.",
        "Q: -- Mar -- March of 38.",
        "A: March \u201938.",
        "Q: And you also have -- had family who were faced with the same kinds of decisions.",
        "A: Yeah",
        "Q: What other conversations were going on in the family at that time?",
        "A: Yeah, everyone had the same problem. How and where to go, and as fast as possible to leave.\nWe were the first ones because the others were not confronted right away with losing the job or -\n- or stopping their job. Also my brother-in-law, who was a Roentgenologist, you know, he still\ncontinued to -- to see patients. And another brother-in-law was in a big firm, and he continued to\nbe there. But my husband was really confronted, the first one of the family to lose his job. But --\nSO we made -- right away tried to make arrangements, but we were not sure what to do, really. I\nmean the -- because from the -- Paris, for instance, I got not the same day, I got the -- after a few\ndays the letters, and we were not yet hundred percent decided right away, where we go.\nEventually we worked through that, that America would be the right place, where Hitler would\nnot come. And my husband was right that he said let us not go to Paris. Many people went to\nParis and went through -- or to England, for instance, and were bombed there, I mean. So it was\nvery clever of him to go -- to decide for America.",
        "Q: Let me ask you -- a-and I know some of this might be painful memories, but I want to ask you\nabout some of the specifics of -- of 1938, and how you felt, a-apart from your decision about\nwhere to go --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- which I-I\u2019m sure you were thinking about a lot.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What was it like living in Vienna in 1938, between the time that the anschluss started in -- in\nMarch, to the Kristallnacht in -- in --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- in the end, in November of \u201938. What -- what was it -- what was it like th -- were you\nrequired to identify yourself as a Jew? Did you have to wear one of the yellow badges, or --",
        "A: No, not yet, because we left in June or July, very early.",
        "Q: In -- in \u201938 --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- or *39?",
        "A: 30 -- 738.",
        "Q: Oh, I thought you didn\u2019t leave until \u201939.",
        "A: No, we left very early because we were really f -- as I said, one of the first one who were\nconfronted with it.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t have to live through Kristallnacht?",
        "A: No, we were not there. Also, my sisters and brother not. The parents were -- were still in\nVienna, I think, but not in their apartment. And we were no -- we left comparatively early. I have\nit in my book, I think",
        "Q: You have a little leather book that looks --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- about four inches by one and -- two inches --",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: This is 1938.",
        "A: We left fr -- Friday the 15\" of July at two o\u2019clock. We went to Zurich. So it was really early,\nyou know? The 15\" of July. We were very lucky. For that reason we could take all our silver, all\nour furniture, everything with us, only not all money.",
        "Q: They delayed your money.",
        "A: We got very little money, but all our fur -- all we had, we could take with us. We were not\nallowed to buy something any more. No -- nothing new, we could take. So, for us it was really\nshort in comparison, that we were in Vienna under Hitler.",
        "Q: So from March to June is only three months.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What were those three months like?",
        "A: The three months, I\u2019m amazed that I see in my booklet how we saw every day friends, not --\nat five o\u2019clock, at seven o\u2019clock, at nine o\u2019clock, we saw friends, friends, probably we were all\nwant to talk over what to do, I suppose.",
        "Q: And maybe you wanted to say good-bye to people, too?",
        "A: Also that, but that was not right away, but I see my husband had [indecipherable] the 19\" of\nMarch, and fr-friends came, family came. So we saw a lot of people in this time, and I think\nreally because we were also excited what -- about the happenings, and what to do. And I went --\nmy husband went, I told you, the first 10 days to the office, got always in the evening some\ntelephone calls with the -- they can put the -- now, how 1s it called, you said it before, the\nHakenkreutz. Sometimes people -- I have the hole in my head. Is it -- to take off democratic\npaper. Of course, my husband say to everything yes [indecipherable] because he knew it doesn\u2019t\nhurt him to forbid, you know? And then came two people, two SS men to our apartment to look\nwhether we have s -- something against Hitler, some literature or so. And in fact we had the New\nYork Times, where there was something, but they couldn\u2019t speak English, luckily.",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: That was probably nex -- everything in \u201938, so ma -- April, maybe.",
        "Q: Maybe April of \u201938.",
        "A: But the horror was, of course that -- was that they take my husband with them, you know?",
        "Q: What -- what --",
        "A: They went through the whole apartment, in my -- my underwears, in the -- the -- they looked\nwhether there 1s something hidden. They have taken 40 books of our books, which were from\nJews, or Russian communists, and they looked everything over. And as I say, we had always the\nSunday Times, and in the Sunday Times was something against Hitler, but they didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t\nread English, luckily. So they didn\u2019t know. So they didn\u2019t find anything, only these 40 books\nthey have taken with them, and luckily they had to ha -- very heavy for s -- them to carry, they\nwere very heavy. And -- but they didn\u2019t take my husband, that was the big danger always.",
        "Q: And wh-why? Did you see that happening around you, the people who si -- men were\ndisappearing?",
        "A: Yeah, for instance my brother-in-law.",
        "Q: Say that again?",
        "A: My brother-in-law, who was in a -- in an office, he was also doctor of law without being a\nlawyer. He did the same as my husband. To be a good executive, and he -- his boss was away in\nPrague, and when the SS --",
        "Q: His boss was?",
        "A: In Prague, Czechoslovi --Czeshuls -- I don\u2019t --",
        "Q: Czechoslovakia, yeah, uh-huh.",
        "A: Right. And as the boss was not here, and he was next to the boss, the head of the firm, he c --\nwas taken to the police, the SS men taking him to the police. And when my sister went there, of\ncourse they didn\u2019t let him go. They kept him because it was a Jewish firm, and the boss is not\nthere, but he is representing the boss, so he was in the police. At that time it was only police,\nthere was not yet concentration camps, that we knew. And my sister went, of course, there. I\nslept in her house because she was, of course, awfully upset and unhappy. I -- I didn\u2019t remember\nthat I slept there, but I read it in my little book. And she had two little children. And that was an\nawfully exciting time for my sister, and also for us, what will happen with him. Eventually he\nwas freed, and they went also, but we were the first one to live -- to leave Aus -- Vienna. But\nsoon afterwards, my sister, who was married with the Roentgenologist, and also my other sister\n[indecipherable] they left. My sister -- I know very little about my sister who was married with\nthe doctor, because I was --",
        "Q: And her name?",
        "A: Risa Fleischner. Dr. Felix Fleischner. And I don\u2019t know whether you know Lynn. Do you\nknow Lynn?",
        "Q: I know who she is, cause I\u2019ve read some of her questions --",
        "A: Who she is. And she --",
        "Q: -- this is your niece, your great-niece?",
        "A: Yeah, my great-niece, and she 1s the great -- grand -- she is the grandchild of my sister Risa\nFleischner. And her daughter, Lis says -- she lives in -- Lis Rosenman, she lives in New York,\nshe says she knows a lot about. I admit I n -- I know very little how they went through, because\nwe di -- were a lot with my sister whose husband was his -- at the police, you know? That was\nthe most frightening thing for us, what will happen to him. And I was, of course, also frightened\nthe 10 days my husband went to the office, whether he came home. If one of the 800 people\ncould have said one word against my husband, he would never be allowed to go home and to\nleave the country. But we were so lucky that not one person said anything against him. He was\nvery -- people liked him very much and he was a very fair boss. I mean, he was just as much for\nthe worker as for the executives. So --",
        "Q: And these were -- these were -- all 800 people were all employees in the textile --",
        "A: Yeah. Not textile, in my husband\u2019s --",
        "Q: -- in the -- I\u2019m -- excuse, not the textile --",
        "A: -- the publishing house.",

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah. And my father closed the office, and at that time he -- he will -- had heart trouble, and\nhe went to a kind of hospital [indecipherable] sanatorium it was called, where you go after your\noperation to recuperate. That was a wonderful thing in Vienna, when you were operated, to have\na place where to recuperate where there were doctors and nurses, you know? You didn\u2019t have to\nstay the hospital as long, and go home. But you will go to the sanatortum. Here, sanatorium 1s for\nmental sick people, no? But we called it so -- like that. So F -- Father and Mother were there, and\n[ -- that was a -- horrid, of course, for me to say good-bye, because I didn\u2019t know whether I will\never see them again. That was really awful. That was -- but you asked what we did in that time\nbefore we left. Number one, I had to go to the different embassies, and I had always to stand in\nline, because I was not the only one who wanted to get the visa for France and Switzerland. So\nthat one had to have the permission that one paid all the taxes. One had to have it black and\nwhite that we paid everything and can leave the country. There were many things like that of\ncourse, for the police. And one had to prove things, you know? And then wa -- we prepared, of\ncourse, to leave -- I mean, to -- e-everything has to be packed, and to decide what one takes or\nnot. And, for instance, we didn\u2019t take the dining room, because we thought we will never have as\nbig a -- an apartment again. And so it\u2019s sad time, but what I was really amazed to see, how many\nfriends we saw all the time, family and friends, also. It -- 1t seems we were two hours there and\nthen two hours there. That I didn\u2019t remember, frankly, you know? I only saw it in my little book\nthat we did.",
        "Q: So, e-everyone in your family was -- most people in your family were thinking about leaving,\nyou -- you talked about Risa and is it Felix Fleischner?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. And I saw from my notes, I guess from your grand-niece that --",
        "A: Did you talk to my grand-niece?",
        "Q: No, I didn\u2019t, but I\u2019ve -- but I saw some of the notes that she sent to Arwen at the Holocaust\nMuseum.",
        "A: Oh, she did, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. And she mentioned apparently that -- that Risa and Felix went away -- fled Vienna in\n\u201938 also in a -- ina plane, in a little plane --",

        "A: Yeah. The --",
        "Q: You were all in together? No --",
        "A: -- yeah -- no, no. They went after us, but to the same place we went, because we had a cousin\nover there, a cousin who lived with her husband in France, in Paris. I saw her a lot during the\ntime. And then they were on vacation, this was summer, on vacation. Whether it is France or\nSwitzerland, I don\u2019t know. [indecipherable] it was in Milan [indecipherable] and probably the\nname of the [indecipherable] I wrote down. Yeah. That -- we -- we went there, and my ha -- no,\nmy brother left the first one, because his wife was pregnant and expected in August, a child. So\nhe was the first one who went to Italy, because in Italy we had the -- he had the business friends,\nreally. And also he could make business instead of from Vienna. He makes the business from\nItaly, from Milano. So he was the first one who left for his pregnant wife\u2019s sake.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s Agon?",
        "A: Agon.",
        "Q: Agon, uh-huh.",

        "Q: Well, I just have these notes here, I just -- I just [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, he was Agon Sporer, my -- my name, my born name, shp -- my family name, Sporer. I\nhad also my studio here, under my -- my name Sporer, Erna Sporer.",
        "Q: Oh.",

        "A: -- I left, and then afterwards Risa left, and afterwards Hella left.",
        "Q: And what about your parents?",
        "A: My parents stayed there in the apartment, and one day Mother said a-an SS man came -- we\ncalled them always SS, a Nazi. Do you say Nazi here?",
        "Q: Either -- either one, I think would [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, came and said, your husband has to come with us to the police. So Father had to go to\nthe police, and was there. Of course that means overnight in a -- in -- like in jail. And Mother\nwas, of course, horridly unhappy and said he has -- he\u2019s a sick man with his heart and so on. So\nafter a week, they said, if you empty your apartment, we can have your apartment in one week,\nwe will give him free. So Mother had to empty the apartment in one week, and Father got free.\nAnd then they lived with other families in an apartment.",
        "Q: In Vienna?",
        "A: Vienna.",
        "Q: They stayed?",
        "A: Yeah, that was -- but that was much later.",

        "A: That I don\u2019t know exactly, I know only when they came here, but to -- my brother tried to get\nthem to Italy, to Milano, but this was very, very hard to get them in. And then, after many\nmonths, I don\u2019t know how -- unfortunately when, but it was surely we left in June, July we left?",
        "Q: I think you said you left July 15\".",
        "A: July, yeah. July 15, yeah, we left Vienna. It was probably November or December that they\nleft. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: That -- that your parents left?",
        "A: Par -- my parents.",
        "Q: So everyone left in \u201938 o-of your main family.",
        "A: Everyone, yeah, luckily.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And my parents were in Italy.",
        "Q: So -- but your parents lived through Kristallnacht then?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Your parents lived through Kristallnacht? They -- they were --",
        "A: No, no, in Italy.",
        "Q: Oh, they were in Italy all -- by November?",
        "A: My parents lived in -- because th -- my -- no, they -- no, they lived in Vienna, of course.",
        "Q: In -- in -- during --",
        "A: And then they had to leave the -- the -- the apartment in one week to the SS men.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then they lived with many other people in -- in -- in an apartment.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The Jews were put together.",
        "Q: But I was -- I was just suggesting that 1-1f they didn\u2019t leave until December of 1938,\nKristallnacht was in November of 1938. Do you remember them telling you about Kristallnacht?",
        "A: No, no, no, nothing.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Nothing. I am not sure that\u2019s -- and unfortunately I am the only old one, my generation. I\ncan\u2019t ask anyone, because nobody is there. So I am not sure when they left Vienna. I know only\nthat they were then in Italy, and we sent them -- peop -- fre -- people sent them an affidavit, and\nMother went always to a consulate and it repeated about 15 times that the consul always asks one\nthing, that the affidavit giver has to do. And after 15 times the af -- the man who gave the\naffidavit said, here is enough. But the consul ask always Mother to come, it was far for her to\ncome to the consul. He was obviously an anti-Semite and didn\u2019t want the parents go to America,\nso he never asked 10 things at the same time, no, one thing. And she has always to come and\ncome and come and come to the consul to get the affi -- to get the emigration. So one said he has\nenough, he can\u2019t do any more. So we found somebody else here in Boston, who were very nice,\nand then what I was -- e-every evening I came home after work and cried. That was all I could\ndo for my poor parents who were there. I thought Mother is so old, 60 years old, that she has to\ngo through that, and Father was 74. So, it\u2019s tha -- for me the idea was awful, these old, old,\npeople. And a cousin of my husband married an -- a married lawyer who, when she met him in\nVienna when he came to help Jews to come out of -- of Vienna, and then they married and he\nwas very influential in [indecipherable] in -- in Washington. So when Mother came one day\nagain to the consul, the consul said, and whom do you have in Washington who has such\ninfluence? And she got her affidavit. Only through -- Alfred Shvetsky was his name. He was in\nthe big firm you probably know, Sullivan and Cromwell in -- in New York. His father was one, I\nthink, of the founders. So anyway, the parents came with the worst boat [indecipherable]\nprepared it, the boat -- about the boat I had the newspaper clipping, the Navamari it was called.\nAnd there were hundreds and hundreds of people on it instead of 50 people. They were lying\nnext to each other. It was awful.",
        "Q: Fro-From where to where?",
        "A: From Portugal to New York. Luckily we didn't know during this time, how awful this was.\nFor weeks and weeks they were on the boat.",
        "Q: For weeks?",
        "A: Navamari was the name of the boat.",
        "Q: No, the -- you -- they were on the boat --",

        "Q: For weeks?",
        "A: -- because it was -- for weeks.",
        "Q: Why for weeks?",
        "A: They stopped in Bermuda, I know. Where else they stopped, I don\u2019t know. They had very\nlittle to eat and drink, and there were very few bathrooms, and many people got cholera. And\nthey were lying one next to the other. And many people went to court afterwards. And I had an\narticle, unfortunately I don\u2019t find -- I also re -- wrote already for my grand-niece, for Lynnie\nabout the Holocaust, because she wanted to know for her children, you know? And I started it on\nvacation, and I can\u2019t find it. I feel ashamed, but I can\u2019t find it. I looked again and again for it, but\nI can\u2019t find it. And there was also, I found a note, a newspaper note about Navamari , how awful\nit was and -- in the newspaper. And afterwards many people went to court to get money for --\nbecause it was so awful, the -- the -- the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: The boat?",
        "A: Yes, the boat, and how they were treated, horrid. When they arrived, they looked so bad that I\nthought Father will die on the way to the apartment. It was just that horrifying.",
        "Q: You -- you met them at the --",

        "Q: [indecipherable] Mm-hm.",
        "A: Then it started, my brother had to leave, because it looked for the Jews, they were -- secluded\nthe Jews in Italy also. So my brother left, and my parents. Then we started worrying. We didn\u2019t\nstart right away, we thought they are in Italy, in [indecipherable] and secure, you know? And so\nit -- 1t -- S-September, and therefore, I was so afraid and so unhappy because I thought that soon\nwe will be in the war. In \u201941 December, and we were in the war. And so it\u2019s -- I can give you\nsome ice in it.",
        "Q: No, no. No, thank you, no, that\u2019s fine.",

        "A: So the parents came over, yeah.",
        "Q: So what was that like standing there on the dock, waiting for your parents just to come --",
        "A: It was awful, and luckily we didn\u2019t know ho-how awful the whole trip was. That was -- we\nwere really lucky, because to t -- to travel all the time, all the weeks, would have been awful. But\nI felt so sorry for my old mother, 60 years old, and she became 99. Then she was little older.",
        "Q: Do you -- do you remember what kind of reunion it was? It must have been both happy and\nsad, huh?",
        "A: Ve-Very t -- very touching and af -- ab -- one, I think I went with Father into the apartment of\nmy sister in New York, because Mother waited probably for -- with my other sisters for the\nsuitcases, and Father of -- was, of course, in an awful state, awful.

We were\nnot allowed to buy stockings new, or anything new we were not allowed to -- to -- and our\nmoney was right away blocked in -- at the bank. And what was awful, of course, to go on the\nstreet, and to see that Jews have to kneel down and to scrub what\u2019s an artist put paint on, and the\nJews have to kneel on the street and to brush -- to try to brush them away. That w-was --",

But now I remember, he was once put also to the police and he jumped from the\nthird floor down and broke several things. So he got to the hospital and survived. But he stayed\nthere, and the children were all brought up Catholic, because mother was Catholic. Not very\nreligious, but they were. Of course, I mean, one had a hard time when one was half Jewish. One -\n- then it was called Jewish. My brother-in-law, for instance, another from my husband\u2019s side,\nHans Hartman, who was a -- 1-1s still -- he\u2019s dead, but he\u2019s a very famous psychoanalyst, and he\nhad -- he had both parents at that time were not Jewish.

Some brain infection. And there 1s a little hope if\none operates. One has to open the head, and during the operation one saw that the head was f --\nfull of pus, and there was no hope for her. Tuesday evening, at 10:30, November 17, 1942, sh --\nis my much beloved, good mother passed away. It is one -- it is very good, they said she was not\nconscious and f -- the good God has at le -- didn\u2019t let her suffer long. My darling mother cames -\n- is [indecipherable] in the crematorium, burned, and I hope that I will get the urn\u201d -- do you say\nurn? -- \u201cwh-when -- when I come home, so -- so I can bury her with my brother, Bela. I am --\nafterwards is I have four -- a 40 fever,\u201d -- that means 104 or something -- \u201cduring the sickness of\nmy never to forget mother, the -- I was wa -- during the sickness all day and night I\u2019ve taken care\nof her, I\u2019ve nursed her. So -- I got so awfully sick mentally about the horrid loss, that I had to lie\ndown for three months and I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t get better and I didn\u2019t want to get better.\nEveryone told me that it would be an misery, and one ca -- one can\u2019t change this misery, and it\nwas surely not Mother\u2019s intention mis -- that I wa -- I-I was so bad off, and I tried to get better.\nSo I stayed til December, but I fell from the bed because I was in this\u201d -- up, you know, it\u2019s sert -\n- up, you know? It\u2019s [indecipherable] she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got better and I worked very intensely.\nThen again the transports.\u201d -- do you see transport? \u201cIt started in September to [indecipherable]. I\ngot in such a transport, but in the last moment, one had taken me out. Later -- later it -- there\nwere no excuse any more, and so I had, in December n -- I was in the -- sent the -- to the -- 1t was\ncalled death -- death la -- death place. Auschwitz, I was there -- I was -- that\u2019s what is there. I\nhad s -- through seven more months da-daily I saw the death -- I face the death, and a -- and I\nexpected 1 -- myself to get into the crematorium, but I was lucky and had to clean -- to make\nclean and went to Hamburg. All these trips [indecipherable] with -- with my mother, and I -- to\nTheresienstadt, we made in a wagon for animals. It was a horrid, daily by day and night, very\nbad bombardments.\u201d Is this right? Bombardment?",
        "Q: Bom-Bombardments, yes.",
        "A: Bo -- yeah. \u201cWe thought always to be killed by the bombs. I was three months in Hamburg,\nthen close to [indecipherable] there -- there were many bombs attacks in our concentration camp,\nand so I -- during the time I worked, I lost again everything. I did not have soap, no toothbrush,\nnothing, only the -- only I had the very bad what I had on -- on. Then we had to go away from\nthere, and after two weeks again in a wagon for animals, 120 people in one wagon, were always\nte -- every day some dead. We had to stand without eating, water, without water in a very bad\u201d --\noh, sometimes it\u2019s so hard, you know, [indecipherable] \u201cwe were in [indecipherable] and\nphysically we were -- we came to the very badly -- a very known for bad, Bergen-Belsen. It was\na -- it was known to -- to the -- for that to -- that people die there. I can\u2019t tell you, my loved ones\nto -- what I went through. Hungry, thirst and lice. We were sleeping on the -- on the earth\nwithout any cover, all cl-close to each other through four weeks. No piece of bread for many\nweeks, no water to wash, and if it\u2019s -- was alright, very seldom a water soup with beets. That was\nall -- in all the concentration camps our daily menu. The people were all so down physically, that\nhundred died every day.\u201d Do you want to continue?",
        "Q: Well, I think --",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry I --",
        "Q: No, no, this is interesting, but I -- I think I'd like to ask you a little bit about -- I mean, cause\nprobably we don\u2019t have time to read the whole let -- the whole thing.",
        "A: No, and because I\u2019m also not prepared to [indecipherable]",
        "Q: No. No, no, th -- but this is -- this gives a -- a -- a feeling of a terrible time.",
        "A: Yeah, a better idea that [indecipherable] happened horrid.",
        "Q: What -- what do you -- what do you recall from having learned about Mimi\u2019s experience?\nWhat -- in addition to what you\u2019ve just read, I mean --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- what kind of hell that she lived through.",
        "A: She was very bad off. She had tuberculosis afterwards. And she had broken her arm, I\nremember. I went in \u201963 the first time to Europe, but I went to see her in Prague, and she was in\nvery bad shape.",
        "Q: This was at -- so you hadn\u2019t seen her since -- when was the last time --",
        "A: The last time I saw her later because a cousin of mine invited her to Austria. They could get\nout of Prague when somebody guaranteed to take care of them, and so Mimi was lucky, through\nme, she -- the family learned then how she is in Prague, and my cousin who lived in -- close to\nSalzburg, at that time, invited her. So I saw her then also there. But I have sent her I don\u2019t know\nhow many packages, care was at that time, care packages we called it. And she always asked me\nfor things what she could sell. For ins -- lipsticks it seems were not in Prague and she could sell,\nand for that she could buy what she wanted to, food or whatever. And when I was in Prague in\n\u00b063, there were still the communists. One person -- Mimi called for me at the airplane, and also\none communist -- one official. And then I was in a very good hotel and got everything beautiful\nto eat and the people outside were standing in line to get something to eat and had no-not a tenth\nof it. So of course I invited many friends of Mimi and Mimi herself. And I was horrified that in\nthe hotel they offer everything what you want and the outside the poor people didn\u2019t, and they --\nin the trolley car one heard -- one woman heard us speaking German, so she came over and --\nand said how horrid it 1s to live through all this with the communists. So I was at a very bad time\nin Prague at that time, but I's -- really did my best to help Mimi. At that time I didn\u2019t have much\nmoney, but at tha -- my husband died already in \u201958, so I was alone.",
        "Q: He died in \u00b058?",
        "A: Yeah. But --",
        "Q: So -- so Mim1\u2019s story is really a story of survival.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s unbelievable. It\u2019s unbelievable that she survived.",
        "Q: What do you attribute that to?",
        "A: I don\u2019t say what I think. [tape break]",
        "Q: So we erased that part.",
        "A: Yeah, but that is my m --",
        "Q: But y --",
        "A: I never talked with somebody about it, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah. Well --",
        "A: And I always thought, I mean, she was not a very beloved cousin, I have to say. And my\ncousin in -- of Salzburg was very decent to invite her. And it was very interesting, the little she\n[indecipherable] there, it was Lynnie and her sister Debbie, they were small. They only liked my\ncousin who lived in the -- there, but they didn\u2019t like Mim1. That was so interesting, the children\nhad the instinct. But I felt so sorry for her, I mean --",
        "Q: Of course, yeah, I can understand that.",
        "A: Well, a horror to go through all that.",
        "Q: Do you -- a-a-and her brother was the other one in the picture?",
        "A: Yeah, and who committed suicide when Hitler came. He was a doctor.",
        "Q: What -- what is -- what is the story -- tell -- what do you know about that story? When -- was\nthis in \u201938, right away after the anschluss?",
        "A: Yeah, right away, right away.",
        "Q: What do you know about that?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, but we thought, the family thought that he was baptized, he was baptized,\nI think and didn\u2019t want that they find out that he is a Jew. I think, but we don\u2019t know really.",
        "Q: What -- what was his name again?",
        "A: Bela. B-e-l-a.",
        "Q: B-Bela.",
        "A: Bela.",
        "Q: His last name was?",
        "A: Herz, A -- H-e-r-z. That means heart.",
        "Q: Bela Hertz.",
        "A: Herz, yeah. No, Hertz one writes with t-z, and they are only H-e-r-z.",
        "Q: Okay. And --",
        "A: And Mimi was not married. She was once married, got divorced, but very short.",
        "Q: So -- so he -- so this is maybe a story of Bela as someone who was discover -- he was afraid\nhe was -- be discovered as a Jew.",
        "A: Yeah, I thought. I -- that was --",
        "Q: So he was maybe making adjustments for his own survival by trying to deny his identity to\nsome extent.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes, I thou -- that 1s what I assume, but don\u2019t know, you know? And he was buried of course,\nthere, but I don\u2019t know it.",
        "Q: Well, let me ask you, Mrs. Karplus then -- we\u2019re jumping around in time a little bit here, but I\nwanted to ask you one more thing about just as you were leaving in \u201938. You went to Zurich\nfirst, you said?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Who --",
        "A: No, my brother was first [indecipherable]",
        "Q: No, but I mean, but --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- you -- you first went to Zur -- I mean, in other words you -- your first --",
        "A: I we -- we went to Zurich, yeah.",
        "Q: -- destination after Vienna was Zurich, and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- can you recall the details of the day that you left and how you traveled, and what it felt like\nat that time?",
        "A: It felt -- of course, I don\u2019t remember exactly, but it felt -- I know that it felt awful to leave\nyour homeland, and to go into an unknown country. America was so far at that time for us. We\nhad an uncle I remember who came once from America. Oh, he was in America. You know, that\nwas, really for us, so far. At that time we went also with the boat there. We were lucky, with the\nNormandie we went there from France to America. But flying was not yet there. Telephone was\nnot yet between there, so it was really in an unknown nothing. But we were lucky that we had the\nfriends here where we could live the first week, so that was very lucky -- in New York. We tried\nfirst New York. My husband tried first to get the job in New York. And I got one right away at\nRubenstein, because they knew me from Paris.",
        "Q: Did -- did you -- but it was \u00b038 that you went to Zurich and -- and --",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] \u201938.",
        "Q: -- tell me how long -- how long did you stay there?",
        "A: Where?",
        "Q: In Zurich?",
        "A: In Zurich, s -- very short, because we went to my cousin, who lived in Paris at that time, and\nthen in -- in -- close to Salzburg.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And she was with her husband on vacation from Paris and s -- and invited us to come.",
        "Q: And how long did you stay there?",
        "A: I stayed there about two weeks. I don\u2019t think that I have it here, where we -- when we g --\nwent to -- my husband, I know went with na -- the [indecipherable] cousin to make arrangements\nfor the going. In [indecipherable] I know we were in -- in August we came -- went to America\nand --",
        "Q: So it was August of \u201938 that you --",
        "A: Yeah, \u00b038, yes.",
        "Q: So you only -- you were only",
        "A: [indecipherable] one month.",
        "Q: -- in Zurich and -- and Paris for -- for maybe a total of a month.",
        "A: Yeah. [indecipherable] in between, we were there.",
        "Q: Those two? Oh.",
        "A: Yeah. Not --",
        "Q: They --",
        "A: The most a month we were.",
        "Q: And what --",
        "A: Maybe we make -- we started -- we arrived maybe beginning of August here. I always said\nwe are not a May flower, but August flower.",
        "Q: You were on the August flower.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what was the trip like to the United States?",
        "A: Wonderful, the Normandie. Yeah, that was such a wonderful boat, and so good to eat. And we\ndidn\u2019t want to talk to all the immigrants.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: We talked not German to each other, I think, we talked French or English, I don\u2019t know any\nmore.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Bef -- we didn\u2019t want to hear from everyone the misery. There were so many people, so poor,\nyou know? Everyone lost somebody, we were so lucky that we didn\u2019t lose people, you know?\nAnd there were so many people who lost [indecipherable] the concentration camp, they didn\u2019t\nknow what happened and so on. And we didn\u2019t want really to talk to everyone.",
        "Q: I-It\u2019s -- at this time in *38, of course it wasn\u2019t as much loss around you as y-y --",
        "A: No, but sti --",
        "Q: -- at that time, but --",
        "A: -- no, tha -- you\u2019re right, at that time nobody was still concentration camp, but everyone felt\nmiserable, of course.",
        "Q: Yeah -- yeah, and you -- maybe you just didn\u2019t want to think about it any more.",
        "A: We -- I didn\u2019t, yeah, yeah. And we -- my husband and I decided we never talk about Vienna,\nhow would it be now to be in Vienna. We never talked about it, so not -- so to get used to the\nAmerican life, to assimilate here and not what we lost. We didn\u2019t talk what we lost, we wanted to\nmake our new life here.",
        "Q: So you just stopped talking about it?",
        "A: About, yeah, we didn\u2019t talk. Now we -- we would be this [indecipherable] now we would\nhave the party, now we would -- we never talked about what we lost.",
        "Q: But what -- what -- what about in 1940 and \u201941 and \u201944, and when the -- when the details of\nthe Holocaust started coming out, did you talk about it then?",
        "A: That -- of -- then, yeah. Then of course, we talked about the Holocaust, but not what we, what\nwe lost, what we would have n-now in Vienna. The money, the positions, my husband never got\nthe position here, a decent. So, we were so occupied with here, and wanted to be here.",
        "Q: Right. Did you -- did you ever talk about what it -- would have happened to us if we had\nstayed?",
        "A: No, it was clear.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t need to talk about that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that we talked about it. We -- we surely talked about how lucky we were to\ncome out, and specially with our things because we couldn\u2019t buy a bed or anything, you know?\nWe had no money.",
        "Q: But you -- you left quite a bit of money behind.",
        "A: We -- yeah.",
        "Q: Can you say about how much, or --",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "Q: But it was -- it was substantial amount of money.",
        "A: But it [indecipherable] yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And so how did you put your life back together financially here, when you were here?",
        "A: I got very soon a job at Rubenstein, Helena Rubenstein, you know, had a salon in New York.\nAnd she knew me because I was teaching her sisters in Paris, so she knew me. And I\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: [inaudible]",
        "A: I worked there, you know, and then my husband, we were told that he should take the first\njob, whatever it is. So a friend of ours worked in a store, and was asked whether he wanted to go\nwith a couple to Canada and tutor children, high school\u2019s children.",
        "Q: And -- and what the children?",
        "A: High school.",
        "Q: Tutor -- tutor. Tutor the children.",
        "A: Tutor.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And this young man, Eddie, didn\u2019t want to go, so he asked my husband and my husband went\nto Canada for two or three months with an American couple and was tutoring all Latin and\nFrench and mathematic, everything, and skiing, because he was a very good skier. The only\nthing he said he didn\u2019t know was, when he was asked when friends came in and he helped to\nprepare, you know, the drinks and so, when he was asked for a Manhattan. He had no idea how\nto do mixed drinks because we never had them in Vienna, you know? And then they came back\nand we hoped through his -- that maybe there is a connection that they will get some job for my\nhusband, but they got it only for me. She knew somebody \u201cVogue\u201d, at \u201cHarper\u2019s Bazaar\u2019, and\nthat was a write-up about me, and I got some private lessons through this write-up. So I earned\nfaster than my husband. And -- but then this couple went away again, I don\u2019t know where, and\noffered us their apartment for three months on Park Avenue. So we didn\u2019t have to rent -- to pay\nrent, we lived there for three months. And then we went back probably, to a rented. But after one\nyear, when my husband couldn\u2019t find a job because the publishers say you have no experience in\nAmerica. A small job we can\u2019t give a man like you, and a high job you can\u2019t get because you\nhave no experience.",
        "Q: So they were saying he was overqua --",
        "A: My husband would have gone everything, he would have done I don\u2019t know what, to rub the\nfloor, I\u2019d -- anything, only to prove --",
        "Q: But they -- they said he was overqualified for the lower positions?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And he always loved Boston, and in fact, he [indecipherable] he paid very intelligently, not\nonly storage, went to New York, but also to Boston, he paid in Vienna, because what he read\nabout Boston he loved always. Close to the mountains, academic place, so -- so -- and my sister\nand Felix Fleischner were already in Boston. So he went ahead, and we went Boston. I asked\nRubenstein, she had the salon here, to transfer me. I worked at Rubenstein and he looked for a\njob.",
        "Q: And -- and when -- when was this, when did you arrive in Boston?",
        "A: One year, \u201939. It was in \u201939, 38 August we came, it was probably September, October \u00b039, I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So that you were in New York about a year?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And where in New York did you live?",
        "A: We lived -- first we lived with a friend on Central Park West, then we rented, also in the west,\nclose to Columbia [indecipherable] an apartment, and hert -- the -- there was h-high-ups, the s --\nsubway, the -- not the su -- the trolleys were awful noisy, but we got used to it. Then my husband\nwent, I stayed alone in this apartment. Then we were three months in Park Avenue with mice,\nand then probably we went back, that I don\u2019t remember now, and mo -- probably went back to\nthe west side because that was the cheapest at that time.",
        "Q: Ha -- and --",
        "A: And -- and in New York my husband didn\u2019t get a job, but here he got a job, and\n[indecipherable] in a very disagreeable job in wal -- Waltham or Watertown. He had to sell\nwatches which are very bad and cheap. And for him to sell, to know it is bad, he suffered awful.\nIt was awful for him. And then he had different jobs, but never a real intellectual job as he had,\nyou know?",
        "Q: So it must have been unhappy for him in some ways.",
        "A: Yeah, he was very well balanced man. He went home and read, you see all the books we\nhave? This is his books. He read and [indecipherable] away. And eventually he prepared all the\ndinner for me, and pre -- eventually he washed the -- he wa -- washed the linen, or laundry,\nbecause I worked long hours. I worked before Rubenstein, after Rubenstein, and after four years\nI left Rubenstein and finally we agreed that I risk to have my own st-studio. But nobody knew\nanything about exercises at that time. That was \u201941, I got my [indecipherable] four years\n[indecipherable]. I think \u201941, I started to -- to look for a studio, which was also very hard. Very,\nvery hard, because I make noise. People jump, walk, noise. It has to be in a region where people\ncan park. It was Tremont Street at that time, all right. Because now I wouldn\u2019t be on Tremont\nStreet, but at that time it was all right. And it was very funny, there was -- it was for the Young\nMan Christian Association, a house. And I ask -- I talked to the director and said, I look for a\nplace, but we have only money for three months rent. I don\u2019t know -- if I don\u2019t get pupils, we\ncan\u2019t pay, and wa -- I have to move. And in fact, the purple -- the person who was there before,\nshe left without paying. But he believed me and has taken me. I was then 15 years there, because\nI worked up, you know, to pupils more and more and more and more. And I never advertised. I\nget them all -- got them only recommended. And that was the wonderful thing, you know, not to\nget from the street anyone who smells or expects wonders. So, my pupils suit me.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Let me change tapes here, and just wanted to ask you a couple more questions.",
        "A: Then I can --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: -- with Mrs. Karplus. This is the side A of tape number three, and I just wanted to ask you a\ncouple more questions. I-I -- I want to ask you how you kept in touch with you -- you all left\nyour family, your fr -- -- your -- your parents. You were all together in New York, in -- but --",
        "A: Yeah, first we were all together in New York. My --",
        "Q: S-So you were --",
        "A: -- the three sisters.",
        "Q: So you really kept in close contact with your family?",
        "A: Yeah, with my sisters. My brother was in Brazil, of course, and -- during the war it was no-\nnot possible. But my mother went first to him when his wife died 1-in Brazil. And otherwise, we\nthree sisters were close because one stayed in New York, Hella and Richard Streicher with their\nchildren the -- my sister Risa and Felix Fleischner were here, they were only for a short time in\nGreenfield, but they came back because he got the job in the Beth Israel hospital, to be the head\nof the department, the [indecipherable] department. And he is really a famous man because there\nis all over the world an association called Felix Fleischner Association, which meet once a year\nand there are, from all over the world the people come, the doctors -- it is for the chest, lung, and\nthey come, also surgeons and so on, and there are some who give the lectures. And there are\nhundreds and hundreds of doctors who get together, and I\u2019m very proud that it is called Felix\nFleischner lecture -- lectures, or association. And in fact, there is also, here in Boston once a\nyear, called the dinner for Risa and Felix Fleischner and they give some prizes to the best young\npeople who do research for x-ray. So, I always say I\u2019m surrounded by famous people, really.",

But th -- it was already -- the daughter was already about 14 years old, so we hadn\u2019t seen\nmy brother for a long time. We had no money to go there, and we -- and he probably also not.

        "A: And everyone a -- only mothe -- parents lost their belongings, but the si -- my both sisters had\nalso all the belongings here, as I had. So it is really like a wonder that we didn\u2019t have to go\nthrough that.

        "Q: -- not that it would be rational, but -- not that it was a rational thought, but that people -- I\nknow pum -- some people felt oh, you know, it\u2019s not fair that I survived and so many other\npeople didn\u2019t. Did you ever go through that experience?",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I have to admit, I was only thankful. I didn\u2019t feel guilty, only thankful that my husband\ndecided America is -- is the right thing, and not Paris. I am only thankful, because it was -- it was\nreally up to him only to decide. And I didn\u2019t feel guilty, I felt only really, as I said -- I -- I feel it\nso -- such a luck is that we three sisters were in America, and could help each other, you know,\nin many ways. Because my sister and brother-in-law went to Boston and I\u2019ve taken care of\nsitting her children in -- in New York in the meantime. You know, we could help each other with\nlittle things, which were important. And -- and I was lucky they were here because I love\nchildren and so I saw children. I had children here. And then the grandchildren came, so I was\nvery lucky as long my sister lived. And now they try also to say al -- all nice to me. And I have\ntwo nephews who are my husband\u2019s side here, who are psychiatrists and psychoanalysts, and\nthey are very nice to me, so I\u2019m lucky, really.",
        "Q: Do you feel that e-even though your experience was not horrific and direct in -- in the way\nthat many -- many others was, do you feel that there\u2019s something that you want to say about your\nexperience, or any lessons that you would like future generations to understand about what\nyou\u2019ve been through and -- and the way that you\u2019ve thought about it in your life?",
        "A: Yes. You know that I know that my -- for instance, Lynnie. They will bring up the children\nwith the knowledge of horror, what happened. And therefore Lynnie wanted, I started to write --\nwhich I don\u2019t write -- write -- she asked me to write about Holocaust. And then she was so happy\nwhen she heard that you will interview me, because she wanted her children to know what was\ngoing on when we left Austria. And she wanted the children know about it. And I had a\nwonderful experience with friends here sht -- all my friends were pupils, of course. And\n[indecipherable] invited in their house and the husband asked me about leaving Austria, about\nwhy, and so on. So I told him I\u2019m Jewish and so on. And then children came for dinner and he\nsaid, I want that Erna repeats now, so that you know, what s -- what she went through. And I\nadmired that. I was very happy, because these are people [indecipherable] of course not -- not\nJewish. And I admire that the father told the young children, you should know what was going\non, why Erna is here, you know? But I have really to say I always felt, because we are two. I\nnever felt I did it for myself. I felt always I just make it as easy as possible for my husband. And\nI\u2019m sure he felt the same for me. People who went -- came alone, I tried to help a lot, because I\nfelt so bad for them. I had a girlfriend, for instance, from Vienna, and we knew her very well,\nand she was here in Boston, and she wa -- and every weekend, whatever we did we tried to -- to\ntake her, because she was alone. And that -- that is hard, to come alone. And her mother died in\nVienna, but not in the concentration camp, she was sick. So it\u2019s -- that is -- makes it really hard. I\nfeel this was a really -- lucky that I had the partner for whom to -- to be. And I never regretted\nthat I work hard, or so, I -- I didn\u2019t know it. I didn\u2019t know it, the others knew it, but I didn\u2019t know\nthat I work hard. I\u2019d -- we were -- and I\u2019m very lucky now, because my husband [indecipherable]\nso little, and I also [indecipherable] to Rubenstein. We both earned 30 dollars a week, that I\nremember like anything. Then his mother came, and we didn\u2019t know whether we have enough\nmoney for it -- to -- for eating. And -- and my husband always said, because we couldn\u2019t put\nmoney aside, he said, what will we do v -- when we both retire? And I said, we will be in a\nrocking chair and remember the good old times. But I thought -- I collected many things about\nexercises, I thought I will write in paper, in newspapers about exercises if I can\u2019t teach any more.\nAnd I\u2019m a very bad writer, but I thought I would. My husband would have helped me. So 1s -- it\nis really when I think back to the \u201938, it was, of course horrid, horrid to leave your -- where you\nwere born and where you lived, and all your friends there, and to leave the parents, that was the\nworst. And then, when we left with the airplane, I think it was the first time I was in an airplane,\nand the cook came -- or maid came to the airport and waved good-bye, you know, it was that --\nan awful experience, of course. But I never thought again and again, of it. Because I really -- we\nboth wanted to assimilate here, even if my language is not assimilating, but we both wanted\nreally to make the best with our life, and not make it harder, and we had no money to get -- go\nback to Europe. \u201963 1 -- 1-1s the first time I went back, after 25 years.",
        "Q: You went back in si --",
        "A: To Europe.",
        "Q: Did you go to Vienna?",
        "A: At that time -- I have to try to think. Yes, I went back to Vienna and there was the friend who\nmarried a non-Jew, and they were in New Zealand and they were back, and he got back his\nfactory for the -- he made furniture. And the people kept the f-factory going, and when he came\nback, he and his brothers, they returned it to them. Which was wonderful, it showed what good\nbosses they were. And yes, I went then to Vienna, and with a car we went to -- with their car we\nwent to Salzburg. So --",
        "Q: What did it feel like to be in Vienna after that time, all that horrible things?",
        "A: It was awful. I went to the apartment -- I wanted to go to the apartment where my husband\nand I lived, but I started so much to cry that I didn\u2019t want to ring the bell whoever was there. I\ncouldn\u2019t. But whether I went the first time, or another time, I went to the apartment of my\nparents, where we lived. And that was -- that was very hard. That was, of course very hard to see\nagain, everything you left.",
        "Q: Did the people take you -- let you come in?",
        "A: Yeah, the people -- the people were quite nice, but I think my sister was already here, she\nsaid, again somebody? I said, but I wasn\u2019t here yet. Because I-I think my sister was there, or my\nbrother, I don\u2019t know who was there before, you know? But to the apartment with my husband, I\nthink I tried in \u201963, and I think to my parents I went another time. I didn't go often to Vienna,\nonly to take a course close to Vienna. I have taken a dance course. But I -- but every year I was\nin Europe to Salzburg because I love Salzburg, and my tra -- my favorite cousin was there.",
        "Q: So you traveled back to Austria many times?",
        "A: Every year I went after \u00b063 -- I think [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So you created new memories for -- for --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- Austria for you.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t like Vienna as much as Salzburg. Salzburg is -- do you know Salzburg?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: It is so beautiful, and so lovely a-as -- it has such an old part of -- Vienna, of course, too, but\nit is a lovely place. So I went, and also I had a cousin whom I loved there much and they had at\nthe lake, a house there. So that was very nice, and I went to Switzerland a lot, to the mountains,\nof course.",
        "Q: Well, is there anything else that -- that you\u2019d like to say that I haven\u2019t asked you about that\nyou think it\u2019s -- in -- that you\u2019d like to -- to share?",
        "A: Id say to -- I'd like to say that the Americans are -- were awfully nice to me. There was -- I --\ne -- very slowly I worked up my studio where I had pupils, as an exercise teacher. I didn\u2019t do any\nphotography here. And I feel always a f -- I started underground, and it was hard to get really on\nthe ground. And during the war, or af -- right after the war -- \u201947 it was in fact, one of my pupil\none day ask me, do you care to use our farmhouse in New Hampshire? I said I will ask my\nhusband. My husband at that time had no job, and wanted that I go alone on vacation because I\nneeded it, and he wanted to stay in Boston, which I never would have done, to leave him in\nBoston alone. And of course he was delighted. We met. Before, she didn\u2019t know my husband, I\ndidn't know her husband. All I knew her during the time, during the war, she has taken me --\nsometimes in the evening she invited me for dinner. And my husband worked for -- sometime in\nthe evening at the -- to make teeth [indecipherable] teeth, false teeth. So I knew her only from\nthat. This farmhouse was in New Hampshire, surrounded by 2,000 acres woods. It was a dream.\nThen she told me, but it has no electricity. And water it has only when the windmill goes, to get\nthe water down. It was so lovely, it\u2019s -- the first time, of course, we were together. And then we\nwere also some weekends, I think, together. And they saw that my husband repaired everything,\nwhether it was on the roof, or whatever was to be repaired, he was very handy. And I, of course,\ncleaned the house. So we got the key. Until six -- 69, we -- my whole family went there. We\nalways spent all of the holidays there together, the whole family. They came from New York, the\nStreichers with the -- then with the children, afterwards with the grandchildren. We had the\nhouse all the time, very seldom they went because they had a yacht, where they were in summer.\nIn winter we couldn\u2019t, in the -- when it was snow. And when mud was, we had the Jeeps they\nhad there. So we left our car up, and -- but the first year, \u00b047, when she asked me whether we\nwant to use it, a f -- a farm, we had no car. They [indecipherable] another to -- pupil to ask me,\nwould you care to use my car? I go on the cruise. So we had a car of another pupil. I thought that\nthe [indecipherable] were terrific to us, really terrific. To let the house have us. All the time we\nwere there. They moved then to Maine, so got -- first they lived on Brattle Street. Do you know\nwhere the -- the church is of the -- not Albanian, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s Sparks Street and Brattle Street, the\nchurch?",
        "Q: In Cambridge, you mean?",
        "A: Yeah, in Cambridge.",
        "Q: I -- I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve been past it, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Yeah, because there the parents lived, with the biggest garden in Cambridge. And they lived\nin the back, there was a kind of museum of a professor and they lived there. But then they moved\nto Maine and used -- very seldom they went to New Hampshire to the farm. So we were all the\ntime there. In summer we were there, because it didn\u2019t cost us anything. And my sister Risa,\nFelix and the children and the grandchildren, everyone was there, til \u00b069, and then they sold that.\nBut then also my brother-in-law died and the -- we wouldn\u2019t have gone any more as much up\nthere. But from \u201947 to \u201969, and it was so wonderful for all of us. And we learned how to make\n[indecipherable] and we learned how to cut trees, we never did it, but we learned it from them,\nyou know, to saw wood. I learned to -- how 1s it called when you swing the -- and split?",
        "Q: S-Split wood? With the axe?",
        "A: Split wood. Not with the axe, I couldn\u2019t do the axe and I know now why --",

        "Q: A wedge?",
        "A: A sledge -- sledgehammer.",
        "Q: Sledge -- yeah, okay.",
        "A: A sledgehammer.",
        "Q: Sledgehammer.",
        "A: That I could do, but I couldn\u2019t do a axe, I think I was astigmatic and couldn\u2019t point, you\nknow, the axe. But we worked in the woods, and it was just wonderful for us. We -- the first year\nwhen we didn't know what to do in the woods, when we were there, we went on all the\nmountains around, because we loved so much. So it was really, I have a very good experience.\nAnd now, walking with a cane, and walking with one eye black, people want always to help me.\nThey are so kind, and I always hope not to be seen by my pupils with a cane.",

We had many\nfriends and it was of -- was, of course, very different to what\u2019s going on here. We didn\u2019t -- we\u2019re\nnot allowed to go in a nightclub, or outside.

And now you have\nphotographer, for what do you want to study to be a exercise teacher? Luckily, my brother-in-\nlaw, Dr. Felix Fleischner talked for me, he was all for it, said I st-study what I want, and luckily\nFather agreed. He had to agree because one has to pay, of course.

We were very lucky this way, we had\nalways, as I say, Gentile friends, and in fact, our Jewish friends had very nice Gentile friends\nwhom they married after Hitler to -- to go out with them.

        "A: Every day. We were not allowed to ring the -- oh, excuse me, that -- that was a good question\nof you and a bad answer of me. It -- yes, it probably was only si -- as -- as -- as -- Saturday\nShabbes, you are right. It was not the whole week.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, you know, it is a few years ago, so --",
        "A: -- it\u2019s [indecipherable] and my memory doesn\u2019t get better. I mean, my si -- one sister had the\nwonderful memory and I never had the good memory and it didn\u2019t get better.",
        "A: No, no, it didn\u2019t get better.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Most of the time father -- we had the very good life. We had piano lessons and basic French\nand the English, and the -- and Mother had every day a hairdresser coming, and everything --\nthat was like that in Vienna. So we had --",
        "A: And dom -- of course --",
        "A: -- two domestic help. We had the lovely apartment we had and that means we moved from a\nsmaller apartment to a bigger apartment. You had to buy the apartment and Father could do it.\nAnd he really gave us all the opportunities to learn and to come and go. He was not delighted\nthat I spent so much money when we went skiing when I was older. When -- I went skiing\nbecause that cost money, the train. And there he was not -- he thought that I spend too much\nmoney on the -- for the train, for the -- but to me it was important. And my future husband, who\nwas always with us, had in fact a ticket for nothing because he had the high pos-position in the\nnewspaper. So he had, for all the trains, if he wanted first class, to go first class, wherever he\nwanted, he had the ticket. So for birthday I got sometimes tickets, so to go, so to be able to go\nevery weekend, and I did.",
        "A: Always. When we were small, Mother went with us vacation. We went to -- first years always\nto Salzburg, because Mother\u2019s parents lived there, and we went for summer and also Christmas,\nwe went to Salzburg for our vacation. Close by -- to Salzburg was a suburban place, and there\nthe parents rented the house, so we went always to this house in Salzburg. And the most exciting\nwas that we were there at the beginning when Reinhardt started to have the place in Salzburg,\nbecause now it is quiet, of course, but my brother was in one of the place, and very little role so\nwe could always go to all the [indecipherable] rehearsals. So it was wonderful, we knew all then,\nall the li -- wonderful actor and actresses. And that was the first year that was played\n\u2018\u201cJedermann\u201d\u2019, by Hoffner -- by Hofmannsthal. Hofmannsthal was a Viennese and \u201cJedermann\u201d\nwas a play by him and it was played in front of the beautiful church, a lovely, lovely church. And\nwe were very proud, of course that our brother was of the stage. We were very young. So\nSalzburg was important. Afterwards we went to Italy with Mother, and we went to -- where else?\nWe -- fit -- Italy several times, and always to a beach to swim. And in the year 1914, we were,\nfor instance in Italy at the beach in Carrado, and then we saw a man going with a drum on the\nbeach, and we children, I was six and a half years -- we children were delighted, but in reality, he\nannounced that the war broke out. 1914 til \u201918 was the war. So, of course, Mother was in despair\nonly to get home. All she wanted, to get home.",
        "A: Yeah, that -- that was lovely for a child, a drum, to go with the drum, and I had no idea, of\ncourse, what it was, and then Mother tried to explain to us. But then it was the first World War,\n14 to \u201918, and Austria was, up to then very big, and then it is -- became a very little country,\nbecause Hungary left many Romanian born a -- so many countries were taken, were occupied by\nthe -- by the [indecipherable]. Austria became a small -- a small country. But st -- during the war,\nof course, we suffered very much.",
        "A: Just awful.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t get to eat, and you had to stand 1n line for hours to get, I don\u2019t know how many\neggs, maybe two eggs. And we children went all after school, always standing in line. And often\nwe had the same dresses, but then we had to be different so that nobody knew that there are three\npeople of a family who wanted to have eggs or meat or bread, I don\u2019t know any more what all,\nwe had to stand in line. And -- but really for hours.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No -- yeah, nobody ha -- nobody h-had the possibility. Sometimes we got from a uncle, from\nMother\u2019s brother, who was in the military, an officer, but that was not only in the war, he was by\nch-choice for his life, you know, he went to military academy and so on. Sometimes he came and\nbrought us something special to eat. We had only one vegetable, for instance, all that we got for\nwithout standing in line. It was called rote and it is a kind of beet. I still have the feeling, the taste\nof it, because we ate every day this beet.",
        "A: But no, I eat a little better.",
        "A: No, never. Never. Never. I don\u2019t know whether they are here, I really don\u2019t --",
        "A: No, I\u2019m -- no, I\u2019m not curious.",
        "A: It was really ec -- so that was very hard. Then, we had no shoes, we had wooden shoes only,\nthere was no leather. And I [indecipherable] my feet very much with these wooden shoes,\nbecause they were so heavy on my skin.",
        "A: Means.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, everyone was the same. That\u2019s it, we co-couldn\u2019t get really enough to eat. It was\nvery, very hard.",
        "A: No, that I don\u2019t remember, because we surely got the roten, the -- the beets. I don\u2019t remember\nthat I was -- went hungry. But not -- it was not a pleasure to eat, this was -- we t -- 1t was not\nmuch there to eat. Yes, anti-Semitisms I met for the first time in Salzburg, that reminds me.\nWhen we went to Salzburg, there was a horrid paper. It was called Der Sturm, that means storm.\nAnd it was awfully anti-Semitic. And there it was written the family from Albert Pollack, he was\n-- he had many, many things [indecipherable] and he was high up, you know, from the -- to --\nvery, very appreciated, he was an [indecipherable] and he was very appreciated in Salzburg then.\nIt\u2019s hoefe is -- means -- it\u2019s aristocrats. And there was written the family from Vienna ca-came\nand eat and ate and ate, and they\u2019ve taken us all the food away.",
        "A: [indecipherable] accent whatsoever.",
        "A: Food",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: There weren\u2019t in Salzburg. My -- my grandfather, for instance [indecipherable] his brother,\nhis sister to come. They were in Austria.",
        "A: But you tell me.",
        "A: Is -- they were in Austria, all, and he ask them to come because he loved Salzburg. And I\ndon\u2019t know whether you know grandfather was a military in Salzburg and loved it, and then he --\nwhen he got through with his military, he rented an apartment and a little shop. And then he was\ncalled to that -- it was some -- I think some Catholic high one who was in charge for Salzburg,\nand say, don\u2019t you know, no Jew is allowed to settle in Salzburg? You have to leave right away,\nand -- and leave your apartment and shop. So grandfather went away, and talked to the military\nfor whom he worked -- not worked, for whom he was with, and they liked him very much and\nappreciated him because he was a very good man. And they talked to this archbishop or whoever\nhe was, and he called grandfather and say -- said come. You are granted to live here, but you will\nbe the only Jew. But grandfather did not si -- maybe you have it, grandfather, after a little while\nhis sister came, his brother came and so on. And then came more and more and more Jews to\nSalzburg. And he was wonderful because he was fighting for everything. They had no rabbi --\nrabbi there. Rabbiner in German. Rabbi is English, isn\u2019t it? They had no rabbi there, he had to\ncome. They had no kosher meat for people who wanted kosher meat. So he had to -- everything\nto arrange. There was no temple, and when they wanted to buy some acres to build the temple,\nthey were not allowed to buy it for that, for temples they were not allowed to buy. Then -- but\none Jew had grounds and said he want to build a temple there, and then it was permitted, if it 1s\nnot on the side -- close to the sidewalk. It has to be farther back so that nobody is offended by a\ntemple. Perhaps the Gentile would be offended if there\u2019s a temple.",
        "A: No. Not at all, because as -- they were all Catholic, of course. So -- but it was built. And that\nwas hundred year old for -- two or three years ago when I went there. And so that was celebrated\nand grandfather was celebrated. All the time was spoken about Albert Pollack, and I was so\nproud.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: He was very [indecipherable] and he was very liked as a person. For instance when Jews -- s-\nstrangers I shouldn\u2019t say, you know, when people came who didn\u2019t live in Salzburg, they were\nalways invited for the holidays in the house of my grandfather and grandmother, always. So, they\nhad only eight children, so it was really bu-bu -- nothing, and he was very well off, because he u-\nunderstood a lot about antiques, and the whole family loved antiques, and had also -- many of\nthem had the s-s-stores, antique stores, and dealed with antiques. Two of my uncles and an aunt,\nand my mother. At one point, probably when Father\u2019s business wasn\u2019t so good, she had also an\nantique shop. Everyone had antique and of course the apartment had only antique furniture and --\nbecause they all loved antiques. [indecipherable] Grandfather, who understood a lot, really.",
        "A: So now we were at my grandfather and we all -- we all grandchildren loved grandfather\nbecause he was very gentle and warm and caring. We had not the same feeling for grandmother,\nwho was a little colder, but very beautiful. Have you seen pictures of her?",
        "A: I will show --",
        "A: Caroline.",
        "A: Was Caroline Pollack. I show you pictures afterwards.",

        "A: Mimi, yeah.",
        "A: [indecipherable]. And then her brother was a doctor in Vienna, but he committed suicide\nwhen Hitler came.",
        "A: By the way, I think he was baptized. I think. But oh -- maybe one didn\u2019t know that he is\nJewish, he -- and -- but he committed suicide. But it 1s so adorable because it\u2019s so old fashioned,\nisn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Wa -- my cousin, no.",
        "A: She\u2019s my cousin.",

We went always\nChristmas in Salzburg and in the hotel we lived, and then for -- in summer we lived always close\nto Salzburg. [indecipherable] went with the -- first you had to walk, and then you went with the\ntrolley to Salzburg as children.",
        "A: Father was very little with us in summer, because he worked in Vienna, and Mother was\nalways with us, I mean, when we were children, and the governess was also always, or a French\nlady was -- a French governess.",

        "A: Father inven -- Father imported different textiles, from Italy, and from Switzerland and\nprobably from England because always came an English, a very nice English gentleman to\nVienna, and that -- and came to our house, I mean, for dinner. And he came very often. I even\nhad to photograph from him -- him, in my folder, you know, my photograph folder where I -- I\nhad to have pictures for my exam. And he had the office in Vienna and my brother worked also\nwith him, yeah, when he grew up. And he had also a -- a [indecipherable] associate who worked\nwith him. And it was in Vienna too, that you came always home for lunch, for a long -- for a\nlong hour, because Father, for instance, we were eating and then he always was lying down. And\nthat was not only him who was lying down, everyone in Vienna, all the parents were resting after\nlunch, before they went back to the office. Very few people, therefore, lived out of Vienna and\nhad houses, we all had apartments because to be close to the office. My husband, for instance,\nalso walked off -- always to the office, and came home for lunch. Lunch was our big dinner. That\nmeans the evening we had also plenty to eat, but less. So --",
        "A: No, only en gros, en gros that means the big [indecipherable] of tex -- of textile, of material.",
        "A: From It -- from Italy and Switzerland I am sure, but now I thought also from England because\none gentleman came always from England, I remember, but I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t\nremember, so I suppose that he also imported, you know, from England, some material.",
        "A: Father? Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Father traveled, yeah, traveled very much.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have prop -- we had only in Vienna, a -- a lovely apartment, looking over a park, si\n-- one, two, three, four, five rooms in a row, looking on the park and then the living room and\ndining room were on the other side of the street. But it was really lovely to look, the view was so\nnice, and the balcony was to the park.",
        "A: It was the first time that I left Vienna alone and did -- afterwards I realized how good it was\nfor me, because I was always the youngest Sporer girl, and the never -- the sister-in-law of the\nfamous Dr. Felix Fleischner, I never had the feeling I\u2019m Erna Sporer. And 1n Paris, of course, I\nwas in the first time alone, the first time I washed my own stockings and underwear, because I\nwas a spoiled brat in Vienna, as we always had somebody to do it. And I --",

        "A: Yeah, in summer I went there. And I was there three months, th -- I had only money for three\nmonths, so -- and I loved to stay longer, of course I had to ask for the permission of my parents\nbecause I was too young, I was 24 and a half. That was for Vienna young, and I had to get\npermission. And I went from one photographer to the next one, whether they want to have me.\nFinally, I found one who said yes, a German, if I type French, English and German letters. I said\nI\u2019m willing to type, but I can only type with two fingers. But you don\u2019t have to pay me for the\novertime, because I need to -- so I worked for him, and that was in spring, I remember. And then\nI was very lucky, one day he was sick and so I had to go out to take a photograph, which was on\na magazine on the -- on the top, how do you call it?",
        "A: Of the cover. So I was very proud [indecipherable]",
        "A: No. I think Vu, it was called. I think.",
        "A: A news magazine, yeah.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "A: And I worked for him, and then came a friend to Paris, who was really a friend of my older\nsister, who was already married at that time. And for him I was always the little Erna, but when\nhe saw me in Paris I was grown up, and he fell in love with me. And he lived in -- in Spain, and\nhe say, please come and t -- and it\u2019s so beautiful in Spain, Madrid and so on. So I went to Madrid\nand spent also some weeks somewhere on a beach, but alone. And I went on the beach and didn\u2019t\nknow, I saw always men behind me. And then I learned one can\u2019t go as a woman alone on a\nbeach, that means one invites the men. And I had no idea, of course. So of -- I stopped to walk\non the beach alone, yeah. I had no -- I didn\u2019t know that. And then I went back to Paris and there I\nmet at -- my phot -- [indecipherable] photographer, a very nice young lady, who also invited me\nto go boating with them and so on. And I wanted to start now with exercises to teach. So I looked\nfor a place where I can rent it for one hour or so, invited some people, invited some people to\nwatch, and so I started to teach exercises in Paris. And I earned enough money to live there\ncomfortable, made very good friends. And as I say, the French people were charming to me, and\nvery nice, and as I loved to teach, and always asked, every year when I came back to -- before I\ncame back in summer to the parents, I always say please, can there be another year? So I was\nfour years there. I always had two months at least vacation, and then I\u2019ve taken another studio\nagain, where I was teaching. And then in -- four years later, in ni -- 1-in \u201936, my husband\nproposed that we should marry. So I always loved him, so it was easy for me to say yes.",
        "A: In Paris. He wrote me every second day, a shorthand letter. His family, Karplus, always wrote\nonly shorthand to each other, so I had to learn shorthand before I left, but I wasn\u2019t as fluent. And\nas he wrote me every second day, I -- I was already -- the second day I wasn\u2019t ready for the next\nletter. And so I went back to Vienna, but my pupils were terrific, when I said I will marry I got\nthe most beautiful wedding gifts in Paris already, from my friends and pupils. And went back to\nVienna and then --",
        "A: In Vienna.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: A very small wedding. I mean, here everyone has it elaborate. I ha -- we had only the closest\nfamily.",
        "A: He, yeah.",
        "A: He was born in Vienna, and his father was a lawyer and my husband studied also law, but not\nto be a lawyer, only to be a good executive. To be a lawyer in Vienna at that time you had to\nstudy law, then to be seven years in a law firm before you\u2019re allowed to be a lawyer, to open up\nyour own office. But he never thought of being a lawyer. O -- really he studied only law to be a\ngood executive.",
        "A: And then he --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Very much. Everyone liked him. During the time I was away they were all the time in touch\nwith him, and in fact he helped one of my sisters who had a -- opened a -- for children, a nurser -\n- nursery, and he helped her. They were always in touch with each other, and they all liked him.\nAnd then we were there til \u201938.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, I was, yeah. Very little, but I did teach exercises.",
        "A: -- and of course I have taken exercises, of course. I have taken acrobatic til I broke my\ncollarbone. And -- a very leisurely life. \u2019've taken courses at museum, and my husband had\nalways when -- if he wanted tickets for theater for -- because he -- for his position, and he --\nweekend we always were in the mountains, of course, and I had a lovely time these two years I\nwas in Vienna, and then we -- we bought [indecipherable] my husband bought the beautiful\napartment, and we had it all redone with an architect, and the architect designed all our thing, all\nour furniture, and that friend who had the factory to make furniture, made it, and we had a lot of\nfriends and always I saw now in this little booklet, even after Hitler, always we saw friends,\nfriends, friends in Vienna. They were for dinner -- of course we had the maid and cook, so they\nwere for dinner with us, we went for dinner to them. So we had the very social life, also. But\nFriday evening, which is the beginning of the Shabbes, we always have the whole fl -- all s --\nfour couples had to be at my parent\u2019s for dinner. That was Friday evening.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- our husbands didn\u2019t appreciate this much, but -- but my parents expected it, so we did\nit, yeah.",
        "A: That -- family, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Family has --",
        "A: -- yeah. S-So should I tell you what my husband did?",
        "A: He -- he was the head of a big publishing house and that he became, in Vienna it was called\ndirector, if you are the head of. Here you call it publisher. There were five daily newspapers,\nthen there were six or seven weekly newspapers, and books were published. There were 800\npeople and he was the head of it. He did not write himself, never, but he was the head of the --\nchief editor and [indecipherable] of all the ones who wrote, and he, of course ha-had decided\nabout the salary and things like that. Besides of [indecipherable] that he became in *36, and\ntherefore he decided to marry, because he had a very high salary, and said now we can live very\nwell together, and I can take care of you. In Vienna one married only til the husband could take\ncare of the wife. One didn\u2019t expect to work -- that she was working. And so th-therefore, when\nhe became the head -- he was not the head first, he was under the director, I wa -- he wrote me to\nmarry. And of course, when -- should I tell you now when Hitler came?",
        "A: Or not yet?",
        "A: No, but I have to say that some people were amazed that we -- that I went back to Vienna,\nbecause they were afraid what will be. And my husband -- my husband said he n -- he would not\nleave his wonderful position, which was interesting for him, of course, and he would not leave\nvoluntarily. But there was some people who said, why did you come back? And for me it was a\ngood reason to come back, to marry my husband.",
        "A: Said that -- that Hitler is in Germany, and somehow they were afraid that he will really c-\ncome to -- also to Austria and so on.",
        "A: I knew --",
        "A: -- that -- I knew -- I knew about Hitler because I had friends in Germany, for instance.\n[sneezes |",
        "A: Excuse me. Who came to Paris to bring money, that I take care of money, because they knew\nthat they will eventually leave there. So I knew that in Germany it went on, but nothing 1s\natrocities like afterwards. I had no idea. But I knew that Germany, he is against Jews, but they\nwere not yet deported like later. In \u201933, he started in Paris -- in Germany. So people were what --\nwhat -- probably afraid in Austria that -- and ask me why I came back, and considered to come\nback. They were amazed. But, as I see, my husband said he would not leave voluntarily his job,\nhis interesting job. And I loved to come back to Vienna. I loved Paris, of course, very much, and\n-- but I enjoyed to come back to Vienna because it was really my birthplace, and where I spent so\nmany years.",
        "A: No, I never felt frightened, and really it was a big surprise, the -- when Hitler marched -- not\nhe marched in, but the SS men marched in. It was a big surprise for all of us, and Schuschnigg,\nwho was our president spoke on the television to say good-bye.",
        "A: Not television --",
        "A: -- the radio. Excuse me.",
        "A: Now itt is -- television is so handy. No, it was on the radio that he said good-bye, he has to\ngive in, he can\u2019t fight. And th-that was a horror, of course, for all of us. It was a surprise.\nSomehow one feared it, but it was a surprise when it happened.",
        "A: But in Germany was far enough for us, you know? We had also relatives in Germany, my\nmother\u2019s sister and children were there. And -- but it was so f -- Germany was far for us, and at\nthat time it was -- he didn\u2019t start right away as horrid as he did afterwards. Even in Austria, I\nmean he started awful, but the horrid atrocities came later, much later. And --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, not secure --",
        "A: -- let us say not sec --",
        "A: -- not secure. But we saw -- we spoke very little about it, I have to say, and we were not really\nso much afraid of it that we expected it. We didn\u2019t expect it.",
        "A: But some people were afraid of it. I mean, my family didn\u2019t --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Just that h-he\u2019s ridiculously anti-Semitic, and want to have only the blonde, blue-eyed people.\nOh, I have blue eye. And that he wanted only to have won the race, that the Jews are impossible,\nthat we\u2019re all Jew.",
        "A: Well, reading, probably --",
        "A: -- in the newspapers, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I si -- don\u2019t think we listed so much to the radio as we do here now. I think we\u2019re g -- read\nnewspapers, and I had plenty newspapers at home from my husband, [indecipherable]\nnewspapers.",
        "A: What should we do? Th-That was the first, everyone, what should we do, what can we do?\nThat was the first reaction, of course, of all of us. It was on a Friday evening and we were at my\nparent\u2019s, but my husband was not yet there.",
        "A: A-At his work, at his office, because two SS men came. The moment they marched in, two SS\nmen went to the office, took my husband, with a letter addressed to Dr. Richard Karplus from\nBerlin to give his office to the two SS men who hand him the letter. Of course they had no idea\nwhat to do. It was prepared already because the newspaper was important, a democratic\nnewspaper, and so many newspaper in his firm who -- which came out, you know?

But I can understand that the newspaper were in aim to stop right\naway to write how horrid Hitler is here, you know? They wanted to avoid that -- this.",

        "A: -- [indecipherable] the Germans didn\u2019t want that the newspapers write badly about the\nGermans, and to influence people. So that -- so they were really anxious to get it out of the hand\nof the Jew. But my husband stayed still 10 days, because he said he is the captain, he -- the\npeople, of course -- 800 people lost all their heads, whether they were Jewish or not Jewish.",
        "A: Tha -- lost their head, that is probably German [indecipherable]",
        "A: Y-Yeah, not only losing their jobs, but that Hitler came in. That we are no more Austria.",
        "A: We are no more Austrians, but not all of them, it was a mixed group. There were many non-\nJews. For instance, the secretary of my husband. My husband called me up at my parent\u2019s and\nsaid, Erna, don\u2019t walk alone at home. One doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I send you my\nsecretary. And the secretary has taken, in the moment the SS men came to my husband, he has\ntaken out the -- you know, h-he was a Nazi. He was -- his secretary was in the party already, the\nNationalistic party.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And so -- and so he sent me him, that he walks me home. He was a -- very devoted to my\nhusband, and that was again and again afterwards. Though you are a Jew, I love you.",
        "A: No, not against my husband, he wrote us and -- afterwards. He -- because he appreciated my\nhusband as a person, you know. And said -- but that was not only with my husband, one heard it\nvery often. I love you, though you are a Jew. But t -- all the Jews are, of course, horrid, but you\nare not horrid.",
        "A: After Hitler, of course, after Hitler. And also, I mean, I saw it with as -- a -- also the secretary\nwas also not Jewish -- of -- of my husband. I\u2019d say all -- I\u2019d say -- not all, but they wrote all the\ntime to my husband afterwards, because a -- as a person they liked him, it was only bad luck that\nhe was a Jew. And he stayed this evening very long in th -- in the office, so to calm down the\npeople, the reporters and everyone. And then he came home, and that I remember distinctly. It\nwas very late probably, and we walked up and down in the big living room, you know, what\nshould we do, what should we do. And we were very lucky, we got -- we had friends in America\nwho send us telegram whether we want affidavit. We got letters from Paris from the lady who\nhas taken over my studio, that my pupils want to have me back, and I ha -- I have right away a\njob. The friends from Paris wrote me, they want to have me back. I wanted to go to Paris, but my\nhusband, who was very intelligent, said, Erna, let us only once emigrate. Paris will be also a\nvictim of Hitler. And he was so right. So we thought about America, a little about Australia. But\nmy husband read always English, and knew so much about Boston, for instance, so we -- we\nwanted to go really to amer -- we decided. And then I started to go to the different embassies to\nget the visas, you know, to get the visa to go to France, and to Switzerland, to go through the\ndifferent lands. And the French sent us an affidavit so we could really -- we could really go to\nAmerica.\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yes, yes. Of course. We felt awful to leave our homeland, and we were -- we were\nborn, where we were so many years. It was a horrid s -- moment to think one has to leave that --\nwe were in the lovely apartment almost not two years, and made so many changes there, and\nbuilt lovely [indecipherable] there. And so many things we did. It was an awful thing to think to\nleave, but the luckiest thing was that we were two. We did it for each other. Alone, I would have\nbeen much more lost fo -- to do it for myself. But I had the feeling I do it for my husband and he\ndid it for me, not to collapse. So we were really ve -- horridly, of course, upset and unhappy. And\nwhat to do? That was the big question for everyone.",

        "A: Yeah",
        "A: Yeah, everyone had the same problem. How and where to go, and as fast as possible to leave.\nWe were the first ones because the others were not confronted right away with losing the job or -\n- or stopping their job. Also my brother-in-law, who was a Roentgenologist, you know, he still\ncontinued to -- to see patients. And another brother-in-law was in a big firm, and he continued to\nbe there. But my husband was really confronted, the first one of the family to lose his job. But --\nSO we made -- right away tried to make arrangements, but we were not sure what to do, really. I\nmean the -- because from the -- Paris, for instance, I got not the same day, I got the -- after a few\ndays the letters, and we were not yet hundred percent decided right away, where we go.\nEventually we worked through that, that America would be the right place, where Hitler would\nnot come. And my husband was right that he said let us not go to Paris. Many people went to\nParis and went through -- or to England, for instance, and were bombed there, I mean. So it was\nvery clever of him to go -- to decide for America.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, not yet, because we left in June or July, very early.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: 30 -- 738.",
        "A: No, we left very early because we were really f -- as I said, one of the first one who were\nconfronted with it.",
        "A: No, we were not there. Also, my sisters and brother not. The parents were -- were still in\nVienna, I think, but not in their apartment. And we were no -- we left comparatively early. I have\nit in my book, I think",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: We left fr -- Friday the 15\" of July at two o\u2019clock. We went to Zurich. So it was really early,\nyou know? The 15\" of July. We were very lucky. For that reason we could take all our silver, all\nour furniture, everything with us, only not all money.",
        "A: We got very little money, but all our fur -- all we had, we could take with us. We were not\nallowed to buy something any more. No -- nothing new, we could take. So, for us it was really\nshort in comparison, that we were in Vienna under Hitler.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The three months, I\u2019m amazed that I see in my booklet how we saw every day friends, not --\nat five o\u2019clock, at seven o\u2019clock, at nine o\u2019clock, we saw friends, friends, probably we were all\nwant to talk over what to do, I suppose.",
        "A: Also that, but that was not right away, but I see my husband had [indecipherable] the 19\" of\nMarch, and fr-friends came, family came. So we saw a lot of people in this time, and I think\nreally because we were also excited what -- about the happenings, and what to do. And I went --\nmy husband went, I told you, the first 10 days to the office, got always in the evening some\ntelephone calls with the -- they can put the -- now, how 1s it called, you said it before, the\nHakenkreutz. Sometimes people -- I have the hole in my head. Is it -- to take off democratic\npaper. Of course, my husband say to everything yes [indecipherable] because he knew it doesn\u2019t\nhurt him to forbid, you know? And then came two people, two SS men to our apartment to look\nwhether we have s -- something against Hitler, some literature or so. And in fact we had the New\nYork Times, where there was something, but they couldn\u2019t speak English, luckily.",
        "A: That was probably nex -- everything in \u201938, so ma -- April, maybe.",
        "A: But the horror was, of course that -- was that they take my husband with them, you know?",
        "A: They went through the whole apartment, in my -- my underwears, in the -- the -- they looked\nwhether there 1s something hidden. They have taken 40 books of our books, which were from\nJews, or Russian communists, and they looked everything over. And as I say, we had always the\nSunday Times, and in the Sunday Times was something against Hitler, but they didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t\nread English, luckily. So they didn\u2019t know. So they didn\u2019t find anything, only these 40 books\nthey have taken with them, and luckily they had to ha -- very heavy for s -- them to carry, they\nwere very heavy. And -- but they didn\u2019t take my husband, that was the big danger always.",
        "A: Yeah, for instance my brother-in-law.",
        "A: My brother-in-law, who was in a -- in an office, he was also doctor of law without being a\nlawyer. He did the same as my husband. To be a good executive, and he -- his boss was away in\nPrague, and when the SS --",
        "A: In Prague, Czechoslovi --Czeshuls -- I don\u2019t --",
        "A: Right. And as the boss was not here, and he was next to the boss, the head of the firm, he c --\nwas taken to the police, the SS men taking him to the police. And when my sister went there, of\ncourse they didn\u2019t let him go. They kept him because it was a Jewish firm, and the boss is not\nthere, but he is representing the boss, so he was in the police. At that time it was only police,\nthere was not yet concentration camps, that we knew. And my sister went, of course, there. I\nslept in her house because she was, of course, awfully upset and unhappy. I -- I didn\u2019t remember\nthat I slept there, but I read it in my little book. And she had two little children. And that was an\nawfully exciting time for my sister, and also for us, what will happen with him. Eventually he\nwas freed, and they went also, but we were the first one to live -- to leave Aus -- Vienna. But\nsoon afterwards, my sister, who was married with the Roentgenologist, and also my other sister\n[indecipherable] they left. My sister -- I know very little about my sister who was married with\nthe doctor, because I was --",
        "A: Risa Fleischner. Dr. Felix Fleischner. And I don\u2019t know whether you know Lynn. Do you\nknow Lynn?",
        "A: Who she is. And she --",
        "A: Yeah, my great-niece, and she 1s the great -- grand -- she is the grandchild of my sister Risa\nFleischner. And her daughter, Lis says -- she lives in -- Lis Rosenman, she lives in New York,\nshe says she knows a lot about. I admit I n -- I know very little how they went through, because\nwe di -- were a lot with my sister whose husband was his -- at the police, you know? That was\nthe most frightening thing for us, what will happen to him. And I was, of course, also frightened\nthe 10 days my husband went to the office, whether he came home. If one of the 800 people\ncould have said one word against my husband, he would never be allowed to go home and to\nleave the country. But we were so lucky that not one person said anything against him. He was\nvery -- people liked him very much and he was a very fair boss. I mean, he was just as much for\nthe worker as for the executives. So --",
        "A: Yeah. Not textile, in my husband\u2019s --",
        "A: -- the publishing house.",
        "A: Yeah, the publishing house.",
        "A: Yeah. And my father closed the office, and at that time he -- he will -- had heart trouble, and\nhe went to a kind of hospital [indecipherable] sanatorium it was called, where you go after your\noperation to recuperate. That was a wonderful thing in Vienna, when you were operated, to have\na place where to recuperate where there were doctors and nurses, you know? You didn\u2019t have to\nstay the hospital as long, and go home. But you will go to the sanatortum. Here, sanatorium 1s for\nmental sick people, no? But we called it so -- like that. So F -- Father and Mother were there, and\n[ -- that was a -- horrid, of course, for me to say good-bye, because I didn\u2019t know whether I will\never see them again. That was really awful. That was -- but you asked what we did in that time\nbefore we left. Number one, I had to go to the different embassies, and I had always to stand in\nline, because I was not the only one who wanted to get the visa for France and Switzerland. So\nthat one had to have the permission that one paid all the taxes. One had to have it black and\nwhite that we paid everything and can leave the country. There were many things like that of\ncourse, for the police. And one had to prove things, you know? And then wa -- we prepared, of\ncourse, to leave -- I mean, to -- e-everything has to be packed, and to decide what one takes or\nnot. And, for instance, we didn\u2019t take the dining room, because we thought we will never have as\nbig a -- an apartment again. And so it\u2019s sad time, but what I was really amazed to see, how many\nfriends we saw all the time, family and friends, also. It -- 1t seems we were two hours there and\nthen two hours there. That I didn\u2019t remember, frankly, you know? I only saw it in my little book\nthat we did.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Yeah. The --",
        "A: -- yeah -- no, no. They went after us, but to the same place we went, because we had a cousin\nover there, a cousin who lived with her husband in France, in Paris. I saw her a lot during the\ntime. And then they were on vacation, this was summer, on vacation. Whether it is France or\nSwitzerland, I don\u2019t know. [indecipherable] it was in Milan [indecipherable] and probably the\nname of the [indecipherable] I wrote down. Yeah. That -- we -- we went there, and my ha -- no,\nmy brother left the first one, because his wife was pregnant and expected in August, a child. So\nhe was the first one who went to Italy, because in Italy we had the -- he had the business friends,\nreally. And also he could make business instead of from Vienna. He makes the business from\nItaly, from Milano. So he was the first one who left for his pregnant wife\u2019s sake.",

        "A: Why do you ask?",

        "A: Yeah, came and said, your husband has to come with us to the police. So Father had to go to\nthe police, and was there. Of course that means overnight in a -- in -- like in jail. And Mother\nwas, of course, horridly unhappy and said he has -- he\u2019s a sick man with his heart and so on. So\nafter a week, they said, if you empty your apartment, we can have your apartment in one week,\nwe will give him free.

        "A: No, no, no, nothing.",
        "A: Nothing. I am not sure that\u2019s -- and unfortunately I am the only old one, my generation. I\ncan\u2019t ask anyone, because nobody is there. So I am not sure when they left Vienna. I know only\nthat they were then in Italy, and we sent them -- peop -- fre -- people sent them an affidavit, and\nMother went always to a consulate and it repeated about 15 times that the consul always asks one\nthing, that the affidavit giver has to do. And after 15 times the af -- the man who gave the\naffidavit said, here is enough. But the consul ask always Mother to come, it was far for her to\ncome to the consul. He was obviously an anti-Semite and didn\u2019t want the parents go to America,\nso he never asked 10 things at the same time, no, one thing. And she has always to come and\ncome and come and come to the consul to get the affi -- to get the emigration. So one said he has\nenough, he can\u2019t do any more. So we found somebody else here in Boston, who were very nice,\nand then what I was -- e-every evening I came home after work and cried. That was all I could\ndo for my poor parents who were there. I thought Mother is so old, 60 years old, that she has to\ngo through that, and Father was 74. So, it\u2019s tha -- for me the idea was awful, these old, old,\npeople. And a cousin of my husband married an -- a married lawyer who, when she met him in\nVienna when he came to help Jews to come out of -- of Vienna, and then they married and he\nwas very influential in [indecipherable] in -- in Washington. So when Mother came one day\nagain to the consul, the consul said, and whom do you have in Washington who has such\ninfluence? And she got her affidavit. Only through -- Alfred Shvetsky was his name. He was in\nthe big firm you probably know, Sullivan and Cromwell in -- in New York. His father was one, I\nthink, of the founders. So anyway, the parents came with the worst boat [indecipherable]\nprepared it, the boat -- about the boat I had the newspaper clipping, the Navamari it was called.\nAnd there were hundreds and hundreds of people on it instead of 50 people.

And I had an\narticle, unfortunately I don\u2019t find -- I also re -- wrote already for my grand-niece, for Lynnie\nabout the Holocaust, because she wanted to know for her children, you know? And I started it on\nvacation, and I can\u2019t find it. I feel ashamed, but I can\u2019t find it. I looked again and again for it, but\nI can\u2019t find it.

We didn\u2019t\nstart right away, we thought they are in Italy, in [indecipherable] and secure, you know? And so\nit -- 1t -- S-September, and therefore, I was so afraid and so unhappy because I thought that soon\nwe will be in the war. In \u201941 December, and we were in the war. And so it\u2019s -- I can give you\nsome ice in it.",

        "A: It was awful, and luckily we didn\u2019t know ho-how awful the whole trip was. That was -- we\nwere really lucky, because to t -- to travel all the time, all the weeks, would have been awful. But\nI felt so sorry for my old mother, 60 years old, and she became 99. Then she was little older.",
        "A: Ve-Very t -- very touching and af -- ab -- one, I think I went with Father into the apartment of\nmy sister in New York, because Mother waited probably for -- with my other sisters for the\nsuitcases, and Father of -- was, of course, in an awful state, awful. Th-They looked horrid. And\nwe sisters were so unhappy. It was really awful. Am I excused for th -- for a moment?",

We were\nnot allowed to buy stockings new, or anything new we were not allowed to -- to -- and our\nmoney was right away blocked in -- at the bank. And what was awful, of course, to go on the\nstreet, and to see that Jews have to kneel down and to scrub what\u2019s an artist put paint on, and the\nJews have to kneel on the street and to brush -- to try to brush them away. That w-was --",

But I mean, it was so that this\nwas an awful, an awful sight. My time was not yet a concentrate -- that people were deported to\nconcentration camps. That was not yet at that time. I don\u2019t know when it started, frankly.",

But you have\nto be completely Jewish when you had a Christian father also, and a Jewish mother, you were not\nallowed, I mean, to stay or to do things. That way if you -- of my sister Hella Streicher, a brother\nof my -- of [indecipherable] Streicher, was married to a Gentile li -- doctor. And they stayed\nthere in Vienna. But now I remember, he was once put also to the police and he jumped from the\nthird floor down and broke several things. So he got to the hospital and survived. But he stayed\nthere, and the children were all brought up Catholic, because mother was Catholic. Not very\nreligious, but they were. Of course, I mean, one had a hard time when one was half Jewish. One -\n- then it was called Jewish. My brother-in-law, for instance, another from my husband\u2019s side,\nHans Hartman, who was a -- 1-1s still -- he\u2019s dead, but he\u2019s a very famous psychoanalyst, and he\nhad -- he had both parents at that time were not Jewish.

And, for\ninstance, my grandmother, who [indecipherable] she was in an old na -- old home -- no, no, for\nold people, you know, in a room, and died there. But one aunt, I think, died in the concentration\ncamp, and that, with our big family, that was terrifically lucky that -- because my friends here all\nlost so many family members, and we didn\u2019t.

He wrote to\nmy -- one aunt went to Argentine, and one uncle went to Argentine [indecipherable]. \u201cI can\u2019t tell\nyou my enormous pleasure, I can\u2019t describe it when I saw your writing, my beloved Aunt Ella.\nFinally, I found you.\u201d I wou -- [indecipherable] I -- I -- I va -- \u201cI didn\u2019t know where to look for\nyou, but the world conquerors found my loved ones. When I read your letter, I had a -- v-very\nmuch to cry, because it was also still addressed to my beloved mother, but I will tell you in\nshort\u201d -- as you say, in short -- \u201cin short sentence, my life what I had to go through. Mother and I\nwere in July 1942 deported to Theresienstadt.\u201d They lived in Prague in Czechoslovakia. \u201cWhen\nwe -- when we arrived there with the transport, all our -- our suitcase were taken away. Only 50\nkilogram we had, with the most important things, but we never saw it again. I worked as a nurse,\nand I worked very hard so that I didn\u2019t -- so that we\u2019\u2019-- because her mother lived there -- \u201cthat we\ndidn\u2019t have to come in another the -- to Poland, in -- in -- to tra -- to be transported to Poland. So\nMother and I were all right. Then I got an awful\u201d -- you don\u2019t say angine in English, sore throat,\nbut it is with an abscess -- \u201cand with 40 grade fever,\u201d that means 104 or five. \u201cAnd Mother ha --\nMother got an ear inf-infection, and her ears was very painful, and the doctor calmed me, said it\ncan be only -- be taken care in the hospital and Tuesday early -- it\u2019s one of the specialist doctors,\nthey said that see that she has an infectious -- infecting\u201d [indecipherable], it\u2019s in the -- God, this\nis hard for me to know. \u201cThe brain infection. Some brain infection. And there 1s a little hope if\none operates. One has to open the head, and during the operation one saw that the head was f --\nfull of pus, and there was no hope for her. Tuesday evening, at 10:30, November 17, 1942, sh --\nis my much beloved, good mother passed away. It is one -- it is very good, they said she was not\nconscious and f -- the good God has at le -- didn\u2019t let her suffer long. My darling mother cames -\n- is [indecipherable] in the crematorium, burned, and I hope that I will get the urn\u201d -- do you say\nurn? -- \u201cwh-when -- when I come home, so -- so I can bury her with my brother, Bela. I am --\nafterwards is I have four -- a 40 fever,\u201d -- that means 104 or something -- \u201cduring the sickness of\nmy never to forget mother, the -- I was wa -- during the sickness all day and night I\u2019ve taken care\nof her, I\u2019ve nursed her. So -- I got so awfully sick mentally about the horrid loss, that I had to lie\ndown for three months and I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t get better and I didn\u2019t want to get better.\nEveryone told me that it would be an misery, and one ca -- one can\u2019t change this misery, and it\nwas surely not Mother\u2019s intention mis -- that I wa -- I-I was so bad off, and I tried to get better.\nSo I stayed til December, but I fell from the bed because I was in this\u201d -- up, you know, it\u2019s sert -\n- up, you know? It\u2019s [indecipherable] she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got better and I worked very intensely.\nThen again the transports.\u201d -- do you see transport? \u201cIt started in September to [indecipherable]. I\ngot in such a transport, but in the last moment, one had taken me out. Later -- later it -- there\nwere no excuse any more, and so I had, in December n -- I was in the -- sent the -- to the -- 1t was\ncalled death -- death la -- death place. Auschwitz, I was there -- I was -- that\u2019s what is there. I\nhad s -- through seven more months da-daily I saw the death -- I face the death, and a -- and I\nexpected 1 -- myself to get into the crematorium, but I was lucky and had to clean -- to make\nclean and went to Hamburg. All these trips [indecipherable] with -- with my mother, and I -- to\nTheresienstadt, we made in a wagon for animals. It was a horrid, daily by day and night, very\nbad bombardments.\u201d Is this right? Bombardment?",
        "A: Bo -- yeah. \u201cWe thought always to be killed by the bombs. I was three months in Hamburg,\nthen close to [indecipherable] there -- there were many bombs attacks in our concentration camp,\nand so I -- during the time I worked, I lost again everything. I did not have soap, no toothbrush,\nnothing, only the -- only I had the very bad what I had on -- on. Then we had to go away from\nthere, and after two weeks again in a wagon for animals, 120 people in one wagon, were always\nte -- every day some dead. We had to stand without eating, water, without water in a very bad\u201d --\noh, sometimes it\u2019s so hard, you know, [indecipherable] \u201cwe were in [indecipherable] and\nphysically we were -- we came to the very badly -- a very known for bad, Bergen-Belsen. It was\na -- it was known to -- to the -- for that to -- that people die there. I can\u2019t tell you, my loved ones\nto -- what I went through. Hungry, thirst and lice. We were sleeping on the -- on the earth\nwithout any cover, all cl-close to each other through four weeks. No piece of bread for many\nweeks, no water to wash, and if it\u2019s -- was alright, very seldom a water soup with beets. That was\nall -- in all the concentration camps our daily menu. The people were all so down physically, that\nhundred died every day.\u201d Do you want to continue?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry I --",
        "A: No, and because I\u2019m also not prepared to [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, a better idea that [indecipherable] happened horrid.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: She was very bad off. She had tuberculosis afterwards. And she had broken her arm, I\nremember. I went in \u201963 the first time to Europe, but I went to see her in Prague, and she was in\nvery bad shape.",
        "A: The last time I saw her later because a cousin of mine invited her to Austria. They could get\nout of Prague when somebody guaranteed to take care of them, and so Mimi was lucky, through\nme, she -- the family learned then how she is in Prague, and my cousin who lived in -- close to\nSalzburg, at that time, invited her. So I saw her then also there. But I have sent her I don\u2019t know\nhow many packages, care was at that time, care packages we called it. And she always asked me\nfor things what she could sell. For ins -- lipsticks it seems were not in Prague and she could sell,\nand for that she could buy what she wanted to, food or whatever. And when I was in Prague in\n\u00b063, there were still the communists. One person -- Mimi called for me at the airplane, and also\none communist -- one official. And then I was in a very good hotel and got everything beautiful\nto eat and the people outside were standing in line to get something to eat and had no-not a tenth\nof it. So of course I invited many friends of Mimi and Mimi herself. And I was horrified that in\nthe hotel they offer everything what you want and the outside the poor people didn\u2019t, and they --\nin the trolley car one heard -- one woman heard us speaking German, so she came over and --\nand said how horrid it 1s to live through all this with the communists. So I was at a very bad time\nin Prague at that time, but I's -- really did my best to help Mimi. At that time I didn\u2019t have much\nmoney, but at tha -- my husband died already in \u201958, so I was alone.",
        "A: Yeah. But --",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s unbelievable. It\u2019s unbelievable that she survived.",

And it was very interesting, the little she\n[indecipherable] there, it was Lynnie and her sister Debbie, they were small. They only liked my\ncousin who lived in the -- there, but they didn\u2019t like Mim1. That was so interesting, the children\nhad the instinct. But I felt so sorry for her, I mean --",

        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, but we thought, the family thought that he was baptized, he was baptized,\nI think and didn\u2019t want that they find out that he is a Jew. I think, but we don\u2019t know really.",

        "A: It felt -- of course, I don\u2019t remember exactly, but it felt -- I know that it felt awful to leave\nyour homeland, and to go into an unknown country. America was so far at that time for us. We\nhad an uncle I remember who came once from America. Oh, he was in America. You know, that\nwas, really for us, so far. At that time we went also with the boat there. We were lucky, with the\nNormandie we went there from France to America. But flying was not yet there. Telephone was\nnot yet between there, so it was really in an unknown nothing. But we were lucky that we had the\nfriends here where we could live the first week, so that was very lucky -- in New York. We tried\nfirst New York. My husband tried first to get the job in New York. And I got one right away at\nRubenstein, because they knew me from Paris.",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] \u201938.",
        "A: Where?",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Wonderful, the Normandie. Yeah, that was such a wonderful boat, and so good to eat. And we\ndidn\u2019t want to talk to all the immigrants.",
        "A: We talked not German to each other, I think, we talked French or English, I don\u2019t know any\nmore.",
        "A: Bef -- we didn\u2019t want to hear from everyone the misery. There were so many people, so poor,\nyou know? Everyone lost somebody, we were so lucky that we didn\u2019t lose people, you know?\nAnd there were so many people who lost [indecipherable] the concentration camp, they didn\u2019t\nknow what happened and so on. And we didn\u2019t want really to talk to everyone.",

        "A: We -- I didn\u2019t, yeah, yeah. And we -- my husband and I decided we never talk about Vienna,\nhow would it be now to be in Vienna. We never talked about it, so not -- so to get used to the\nAmerican life, to assimilate here and not what we lost. We didn\u2019t talk what we lost, we wanted to\nmake our new life here.",

        "A: That -- of -- then, yeah. Then of course, we talked about the Holocaust, but not what we, what\nwe lost, what we would have n-now in Vienna. The money, the positions, my husband never got\nthe position here, a decent. So, we were so occupied with here, and wanted to be here.",
        "A: No, it was clear.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that we talked about it. We -- we surely talked about how lucky we were to\ncome out, and specially with our things because we couldn\u2019t buy a bed or anything, you know?\nWe had no money.",

The only\nthing he said he didn\u2019t know was, when he was asked when friends came in and he helped to\nprepare, you know, the drinks and so, when he was asked for a Manhattan. He had no idea how\nto do mixed drinks because we never had them in Vienna, you know? And then they came back\nand we hoped through his -- that maybe there is a connection that they will get some job for my\nhusband, but they got it only for me. She knew somebody \u201cVogue\u201d, at \u201cHarper\u2019s Bazaar\u2019, and\nthat was a write-up about me, and I got some private lessons through this write-up. So I earned\nfaster than my husband. And -- but then this couple went away again, I don\u2019t know where, and\noffered us their apartment for three months on Park Avenue. So we didn\u2019t have to rent -- to pay\nrent, we lived there for three months. And then we went back probably, to a rented. But after one\nyear, when my husband couldn\u2019t find a job because the publishers say you have no experience in\nAmerica.

Close to the mountains, academic place, so -- so -- and my sister\nand Felix Fleischner were already in Boston. So he went ahead, and we went Boston.

And eventually he prepared all the\ndinner for me, and pre -- eventually he washed the -- he wa -- washed the linen, or laundry,\nbecause I worked long hours. I worked before Rubenstein, after Rubenstein, and after four years\nI left Rubenstein and finally we agreed that I risk to have my own st-studio.

I think \u201941, I started to -- to look for a studio, which was also very hard. Very,\nvery hard, because I make noise. People jump, walk, noise. It has to be in a region where people\ncan park. It was Tremont Street at that time, all right. Because now I wouldn\u2019t be on Tremont\nStreet, but at that time it was all right. And it was very funny, there was -- it was for the Young\nMan Christian Association, a house. And I ask -- I talked to the director and said, I look for a\nplace, but we have only money for three months rent. I don\u2019t know -- if I don\u2019t get pupils, we\ncan\u2019t pay, and wa -- I have to move. And in fact, the purple -- the person who was there before,\nshe left without paying. But he believed me and has taken me. I was then 15 years there, because\nI worked up, you know, to pupils more and more and more and more. And I never advertised. I\nget them all -- got them only recommended. And that was the wonderful thing, you know, not to\nget from the street anyone who smells or expects wonders. So, my pupils suit me.",

        "A: -- the three sisters.",
        "A: Yeah, with my sisters. My brother was in Brazil, of course, and -- during the war it was no-\nnot possible. But my mother went first to him when his wife died 1-in Brazil. And otherwise, we\nthree sisters were close because one stayed in New York, Hella and Richard Streicher with their\nchildren the -- my sister Risa and Felix Fleischner were here, they were only for a short time in\nGreenfield, but they came back because he got the job in the Beth Israel hospital, to be the head\nof the department, the [indecipherable] department. And he is really a famous man because there\nis all over the world an association called Felix Fleischner Association, which meet once a year\nand there are, from all over the world the people come, the doctors -- it is for the chest, lung, and\nthey come, also surgeons and so on, and there are some who give the lectures. And there are\nhundreds and hundreds of doctors who get together, and I\u2019m very proud that it is called Felix\nFleischner lecture -- lectures, or association. And in fact, there is also, here in Boston once a\nyear, called the dinner for Risa and Felix Fleischner and they give some prizes to the best young\npeople who do research for x-ray. So, I always say I\u2019m surrounded by famous people, really.",
        "A: Yes, yes, and then the first time when he came with his daughter, we were awfully excited, of\ncourse. But th -- it was already -- the daughter was already about 14 years old, so we hadn\u2019t seen\nmy brother for a long time. We had no money to go there, and we -- and he probably also not. So\nwhen he came with his daughter, we were very, very happy and excited, really. It was wonderful.\nBut luckily, that all close -- also for my husband that the siblings, everyone came out, and that\nwas a wonder. Was really -- when so many people who were [indecipherable] no? And had to go\nthrough the concentration camp, and only my cousin Mimi, who --",
        "A: -- went to the concentration camps.",
        "A: Mm-hm, very. Very, and lucky. I mean, so lucky.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Was so lucky.",
        "A: No, because we started early.",
        "A: The people -- that made a big difference, it -- we star -- we started early, before people were\ndeported.",
        "A: I think, number one, if you had not still money, for instance, for the van.",
        "A: For the van. The van, it\u2019s called, where we had everything.",
        "A: The van.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: But I tried to -- so many had not the luck to get an affidavit for instance, you know? To\nAmerica. Because, I mean, we knew someone who was living in New York, a Viennese survivor\nof -- a psychoanalyst. We knew here, and she was wonderful, she ta -- sent us right away a wire.\nSo anyone who got an affidavit could leave to America. But many people didn\u2019t know anyone --",
        "A: -- in America, for instance --",
        "A: -- and go to America.",

        "A: Yeah, from my family, from my father\u2019s family some went.",
        "A: From Father\u2019s family some went there, and -- to Israel, to Palestine at that time, but I don\u2019t\nknow whether many people went and frankly I don\u2019t know if --",
        "A: No, and through [indecipherable] went there who only -- I only know of them, and they were\na cousin and her children.",
        "A: To -- to Israel? But never, we never --",
        "A: Because he was not really -- he was Jewish feeling, but this was nothing attractive for us to go\nto Palestine -- and to --",
        "A: -- wa -- we never -- funny, we never thought of it.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no --",
        "A: -- we never -- we were not Zionists, definitely not. And we thought -- I mean, and everyone of\ncourse thought of -- toward my husband, he will never have any difficulty to find a job, a man of\nthis caliber, of course he will right away have a job, people thought. And we thought too.",
        "A: Of course --",
        "A: -- nowadays it is different --",
        "A: -- everything different. At that time Palestine -- at -- it wasn\u2019t so attractive. I mean, it isn\u2019t\nattractive for me today because it is much too much going on there. It is -- it is a horror to see\nthis shooting forth and back. And I hate also when the Israelis shoot.",
        "A: I hate it, because it is a oc -- no, we never thought of Israel.",
        "A: Of course, I only thought of Paris, because I loved Paris and I knew the people who want to --\nwant to have me there teaching again, you know? That -- that is attractive, of course. But luckily\nwe came to America, wi -- very lucky.",
        "A: Oh [indecipherable]",
        "A: Where is she living, in Boston?",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It is the biggest one that there is, that our family was so lucky. It is really terrific, where we\nwere so many, but I only think because we left early.",
        "A: And everyone a -- only mothe -- parents lost their belongings, but the si -- my both sisters had\nalso all the belongings here, as I had. So it is really like a wonder that we didn\u2019t have to go\nthrough that. I mean, it was an awful time when my brother-in-law was in prison, because we\ndidn\u2019t know, do they keep him for good.",
        "A: That -- that --",
        "A: No, I never -- I never -- I never heard of it of anyone.",
        "A: It might be, you know, you don\u2019t talk about everything.",
        "A: And I have to admit, I was only thankful. I didn\u2019t feel guilty, only thankful that my husband\ndecided America is -- is the right thing, and not Paris. I am only thankful, because it was -- it was\nreally up to him only to decide. And I didn\u2019t feel guilty, I felt only really, as I said -- I -- I feel it\nso -- such a luck is that we three sisters were in America, and could help each other, you know,\nin many ways. Because my sister and brother-in-law went to Boston and I\u2019ve taken care of\nsitting her children in -- in New York in the meantime. You know, we could help each other with\nlittle things, which were important. And -- and I was lucky they were here because I love\nchildren and so I saw children. I had children here. And then the grandchildren came, so I was\nvery lucky as long my sister lived. And now they try also to say al -- all nice to me. And I have\ntwo nephews who are my husband\u2019s side here, who are psychiatrists and psychoanalysts, and\nthey are very nice to me, so I\u2019m lucky, really.",
        "A: Yes. You know that I know that my -- for instance, Lynnie. They will bring up the children\nwith the knowledge of horror, what happened. And therefore Lynnie wanted, I started to write --\nwhich I don\u2019t write -- write -- she asked me to write about Holocaust. And then she was so happy\nwhen she heard that you will interview me, because she wanted her children to know what was\ngoing on when we left Austria. And she wanted the children know about it. And I had a\nwonderful experience with friends here sht -- all my friends were pupils, of course. And\n[indecipherable] invited in their house and the husband asked me about leaving Austria, about\nwhy, and so on. So I told him I\u2019m Jewish and so on. And then children came for dinner and he\nsaid, I want that Erna repeats now, so that you know, what s -- what she went through. And I\nadmired that. I was very happy, because these are people [indecipherable] of course not -- not\nJewish. And I admire that the father told the young children, you should know what was going\non, why Erna is here, you know? But I have really to say I always felt, because we are two. I\nnever felt I did it for myself. I felt always I just make it as easy as possible for my husband. And\nI\u2019m sure he felt the same for me. People who went -- came alone, I tried to help a lot, because I\nfelt so bad for them. I had a girlfriend, for instance, from Vienna, and we knew her very well,\nand she was here in Boston, and she wa -- and every weekend, whatever we did we tried to -- to\ntake her, because she was alone. And that -- that is hard, to come alone. And her mother died in\nVienna, but not in the concentration camp, she was sick. So it\u2019s -- that is -- makes it really hard. I\nfeel this was a really -- lucky that I had the partner for whom to -- to be. And I never regretted\nthat I work hard, or so, I -- I didn\u2019t know it. I didn\u2019t know it, the others knew it, but I didn\u2019t know\nthat I work hard. I\u2019d -- we were -- and I\u2019m very lucky now, because my husband [indecipherable]\nso little, and I also [indecipherable] to Rubenstein. We both earned 30 dollars a week, that I\nremember like anything. Then his mother came, and we didn\u2019t know whether we have enough\nmoney for it -- to -- for eating. And -- and my husband always said, because we couldn\u2019t put\nmoney aside, he said, what will we do v -- when we both retire? And I said, we will be in a\nrocking chair and remember the good old times. But I thought -- I collected many things about\nexercises, I thought I will write in paper, in newspapers about exercises if I can\u2019t teach any more.\nAnd I\u2019m a very bad writer, but I thought I would. My husband would have helped me. So 1s -- it\nis really when I think back to the \u201938, it was, of course horrid, horrid to leave your -- where you\nwere born and where you lived, and all your friends there, and to leave the parents, that was the\nworst. And then, when we left with the airplane, I think it was the first time I was in an airplane,\nand the cook came -- or maid came to the airport and waved good-bye, you know, it was that --\nan awful experience, of course. But I never thought again and again, of it. Because I really -- we\nboth wanted to assimilate here, even if my language is not assimilating, but we both wanted\nreally to make the best with our life, and not make it harder, and we had no money to get -- go\nback to Europe. \u201963 1 -- 1-1s the first time I went back, after 25 years.",
        "A: To Europe.",
        "A: At that time -- I have to try to think. Yes, I went back to Vienna and there was the friend who\nmarried a non-Jew, and they were in New Zealand and they were back, and he got back his\nfactory for the -- he made furniture. And the people kept the f-factory going, and when he came\nback, he and his brothers, they returned it to them. Which was wonderful, it showed what good\nbosses they were. And yes, I went then to Vienna, and with a car we went to -- with their car we\nwent to Salzburg. So --",
        "A: It was awful. I went to the apartment -- I wanted to go to the apartment where my husband\nand I lived, but I started so much to cry that I didn\u2019t want to ring the bell whoever was there. I\ncouldn\u2019t. But whether I went the first time, or another time, I went to the apartment of my\nparents, where we lived. And that was -- that was very hard. That was, of course very hard to see\nagain, everything you left.",
        "A: Yeah, the people -- the people were quite nice, but I think my sister was already here, she\nsaid, again somebody? I said, but I wasn\u2019t here yet. Because I-I think my sister was there, or my\nbrother, I don\u2019t know who was there before, you know? But to the apartment with my husband, I\nthink I tried in \u201963, and I think to my parents I went another time. I didn't go often to Vienna,\nonly to take a course close to Vienna. I have taken a dance course. But I -- but every year I was\nin Europe to Salzburg because I love Salzburg, and my tra -- my favorite cousin was there.",
        "A: Every year I went after \u00b063 -- I think [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. [indecipherable]",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t like Vienna as much as Salzburg. Salzburg is -- do you know Salzburg?",
        "A: It is so beautiful, and so lovely a-as -- it has such an old part of -- Vienna, of course, too, but\nit is a lovely place. So I went, and also I had a cousin whom I loved there much and they had at\nthe lake, a house there. So that was very nice, and I went to Switzerland a lot, to the mountains,\nof course.",
        "A: Id say to -- I'd like to say that the Americans are -- were awfully nice to me. There was -- I --\ne -- very slowly I worked up my studio where I had pupils, as an exercise teacher. I didn\u2019t do any\nphotography here. And I feel always a f -- I started underground, and it was hard to get really on\nthe ground. And during the war, or af -- right after the war -- \u201947 it was in fact, one of my pupil\none day ask me, do you care to use our farmhouse in New Hampshire? I said I will ask my\nhusband. My husband at that time had no job, and wanted that I go alone on vacation because I\nneeded it, and he wanted to stay in Boston, which I never would have done, to leave him in\nBoston alone. And of course he was delighted. We met. Before, she didn\u2019t know my husband, I\ndidn't know her husband. All I knew her during the time, during the war, she has taken me --\nsometimes in the evening she invited me for dinner. And my husband worked for -- sometime in\nthe evening at the -- to make teeth [indecipherable] teeth, false teeth. So I knew her only from\nthat. This farmhouse was in New Hampshire, surrounded by 2,000 acres woods. It was a dream.\nThen she told me, but it has no electricity. And water it has only when the windmill goes, to get\nthe water down. It was so lovely, it\u2019s -- the first time, of course, we were together. And then we\nwere also some weekends, I think, together. And they saw that my husband repaired everything,\nwhether it was on the roof, or whatever was to be repaired, he was very handy. And I, of course,\ncleaned the house. So we got the key. Until six -- 69, we -- my whole family went there. We\nalways spent all of the holidays there together, the whole family. They came from New York, the\nStreichers with the -- then with the children, afterwards with the grandchildren. We had the\nhouse all the time, very seldom they went because they had a yacht, where they were in summer.\nIn winter we couldn\u2019t, in the -- when it was snow. And when mud was, we had the Jeeps they\nhad there. So we left our car up, and -- but the first year, \u00b047, when she asked me whether we\nwant to use it, a f -- a farm, we had no car. They [indecipherable] another to -- pupil to ask me,\nwould you care to use my car? I go on the cruise. So we had a car of another pupil. I thought that\nthe [indecipherable] were terrific to us, really terrific. To let the house have us. All the time we\nwere there. They moved then to Maine, so got -- first they lived on Brattle Street. Do you know\nwhere the -- the church is of the -- not Albanian, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s Sparks Street and Brattle Street, the\nchurch?",
        "A: Yeah, in Cambridge.",
        "A: Yeah, because there the parents lived, with the biggest garden in Cambridge. And they lived\nin the back, there was a kind of museum of a professor and they lived there. But then they moved\nto Maine and used -- very seldom they went to New Hampshire to the farm. So we were all the\ntime there. In summer we were there, because it didn\u2019t cost us anything. And my sister Risa,\nFelix and the children and the grandchildren, everyone was there, til \u00b069, and then they sold that.\nBut then also my brother-in-law died and the -- we wouldn\u2019t have gone any more as much up\nthere. But from \u201947 to \u201969, and it was so wonderful for all of us. And we learned how to make\n[indecipherable] and we learned how to cut trees, we never did it, but we learned it from them,\nyou know, to saw wood. I learned to -- how 1s it called when you swing the -- and split?",
        "A: Split wood. Not with the axe, I couldn\u2019t do the axe and I know now why --",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: No, no, with that -- yeah, with a hatchet, but you have a word for it.",
        "A: A sledge -- sledgehammer.",
        "A: A sledgehammer.",
        "A: That I could do, but I couldn\u2019t do a axe, I think I was astigmatic and couldn\u2019t point, you\nknow, the axe. But we worked in the woods, and it was just wonderful for us. We -- the first year\nwhen we didn't know what to do in the woods, when we were there, we went on all the\nmountains around, because we loved so much. So it was really, I have a very good experience.\nAnd now, walking with a cane, and walking with one eye black, people want always to help me.\nThey are so kind, and I always hope not to be seen by my pupils with a cane.",
        "A: Yeah. D-Do you think you have enough?",
