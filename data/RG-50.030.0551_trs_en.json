        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nAnnette Fein, conducted by Ina Navazelskis, on November 7\", 2008, in\nAlexandria, Virginia. Thank you, Annette, for agreeing to talk with us today. As \u2014\nas you know, we are interested in recording the stories of people who experienced\nand survived the Holocaust. And since we are here at the child survivor\u2019s\nconference, we are very grateful that you\u2019ve agreed to tell \u2014 to talk to us. Can you\ngive me a little bit of background about your s \u2014 your whole \u2014 your story; where \u2014\nwhere you were born; where your family came from? And we\u2019ll start from there.",
        "Answer: Okay. My family came from Poland. I don\u2019t remember the exact location,\nbut my brother Jack would be able to tell you. And they moved to \u2014 to Paris, where\nI was born.",
        "Q: When?",
        "A: In \u2014 I-I was born in 1940, so I assume like a year or so before, maybe two years\nbefore, because Jack was also born in Paris. And then, by the age of around two,\nwe were put in hiding in a place called Vales(ph) Galant(ph), and I have absolutely\nno memory of that time. And after I think about \u2014 well, I guess around 1945, we\nwere brought by relatives to an orphanage. I just today learned that we were in\nseveral places, but I only know of one place, Taverne, an orphanage in Taverne, a\nJewish orphanage, where I was until the age of [indecipherable] until 1948, when \u2014\nNovember 7, 2008\nwhere I then was adopted by American citizens, who were bo-both born in Russia,\nbut they were both \u2014 they were both already American citizens, and we \u2014 I believe\nthat happened in 1947, and it took about a year for the whole process to be finished,\nand I moved to America at the age of eight, 1948.",
        "Q: Do you \u2014 do you know anything about your birth parents?",
        "A: Well, we have photographs of them, and I know that they were both sew \u2014\ntailors. I have photographs, but I \u2014 I dil \u2014 I don\u2019t remember them. I rem \u2014 it\u2019s all\nblocked out, basically, the whole time. I don\u2019t know ti \u2014 a-anything, except what \u2014",
        "Q: Do you know their names?",
        "A: Calpeak(ph). Rose and Joseph Calpeak(ph).",
        "Q: And do you \u2014 do you know \u2014 did they have any relatives that you were ever able\nto identify?",
        "A: Not that we\u2019ve been \u2014 yes, well, we had a \u2014 my father had a sister who also\nperished \u2014 or it was my mother, I think it was my mother\u2019s sist \u2014 sister. You\u2019ll have\n\u2014I-\u2014Ican\u2019t\u2014I have to verify, I\u2014 I\u2014I don\u2019t remember all these things, I forget\nthem. I mean, I \u2014 I put them out of my mind, pretty much. They \u2014 and there was \u2014\nthere was another relation o \u2014 th-that \u2014 the daughters \u2014 the \u2014 the sister\u2019s daughter is\nstill alive \u2014 is alive in\u20141in Paris. We\u2019re in contact with. And there\u2019s another cousin\nalso in Paris.\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "Q: So would this suggest that when your family left Poland, it wasn\u2019t just your\nimmediate family, your father and your mother, but a larger group of people?",
        "A: Perhaps, perhaps, but I have no \u2014 no idea. I t\u2014 I have never really delved into the\ndetails of that. I know the fa \u2014 th-the minimal facts, and that\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: Have you been happy knowing just the minimal facts?",
        "A: It\u2019s been \u2014",
        "Q: Maybe happy isn\u2019t the right word, but \u2014",
        "A: Well, yeah, no, I do \u2014 I don\u2019t think it 1s the right word. For me it\u2019s been \u2014 1-it\u2019s\nsomething that was, and I accepted, and I don\u2019t feel that I can just delve on it all the\ntime. Or even to know if it \u2014 I don\u2019t believe that it can help me personally in my\nlife, so I just don\u2019t bother. I do \u2014 I go forward, not backwards.",
        "Q: Do you know what happened, though, to your parents specifically? Were you\nable to learn that?",
        "A: That, yes. We \u2014 basically. I know that my father was put in a camp much earlier,\nI don\u2019t remember the name. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t know it, I don\u2019t remember. And my\nmother, evidently \u2014 I keep hearing stories that she would cu \u2014 she had put us in\nhiding, in this village called Vales(ph) Galant(ph), and she lived there as well, with\nthe family and evidently there were other children there. And she went back to\nParis, I \u2014 I believe and got caught and then sent to a camp.\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t know whi \u2014 where \u2014",
        "A: Again, I don\u2019t remember. It\u2019s over and down, I just don\u2019t remember these names,\nbecause they \u2014 they\u2019re long and complicated things.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t \u2014 yeah, but you know, you \u2014 they\u2019re not recognizable, you don\u2019t\nknow that it would have been Auschwitz she was sent to \u2014",
        "A: No, it\u2019s not Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. What\u2019s your [indecipherable]",
        "A: [indecipherable] mental, it\u2019s a mental block, so \u2014 which I \u2014 I accept that it\u2019s\nthere, and I \u2014 it doesn\u2019t bother me too much, so \u2014",
        "Q: Well, you know, who\u2019s to \u2014 who is anybody else to say how another person\nshould deal with \u2014 with their stories and their lives?",
        "A: Hm, right, right, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Do \u2014 do you have an earliest memory in your mind, of anything?",
        "A: None, no. The only \u2014 I-I used to \u2014 I used to have a memory or \u2014 or \u2014 of\nsomething like a place with a lot of trees, and we \u2014 I remember something \u2014 hearing\n\u2014 hearing people or children say something about Jews, and I never knew what that\nwas about until I moved to Israel, and I would \u2014 any time I met French people, I\nwould ask them if \u2014 because I only remember the tap \u2014 or the name, at that time,\nTaverne, the \u2014 the pla \u2014 the \u2014 where the orphanage was. And, I would \u2014 any time I\nNovember 7, 2008\nwould meet French people, I would ask them if they knew of the place. And it\nhappens that \u2014 actually the first job I had in Israel was with an architect, and one of\nthe partners was an interior decorator, Frenchman, and he \u2014 he tur \u2014 his name was\nJosh Goldsta \u2014 is Josh Goldstein. And he said yes, of cour \u2014 he of \u2014 he knows the\nplace, and it turns out that he and his wife both worked at this orphanage, but once \u2014\nafter we\u2019d already left there.",
        "Q: So, would \u2014",
        "A: And so he described the \u2014 the setting, and that kind of made more sense, why\nthat was stuck in my head, of the trees, and \u2014",
        "Q: So, until you had that conversation with him, did you know that this 1s \u2014 you \u2014\ncould you place it in a town o \u2014 when you had this image of trees, or you didn\u2019t\neven know where that was?",
        "A: No, I didn't know where it was. I didn\u2019t know where it was, because I never \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. It was putting two and two together.",
        "A: Yeah, I never came across anyone \u2014 cause I \u2014 when \u2014 whenever I would ask if\nthey kn \u2014 1-it only started in \u2014 in Israel when I asked people where Taverne was.\nAnd \u2014",
        "Q: What was your first language that you spoke?",
        "A: French.\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "Q: French.",
        "A: French.",
        "Q: And was \u2014 how long was that the only language that you spoke?",
        "A: Until the age of eight, and once we moved to America, | think within about two\nmonths we learned English. I learned English perhaps faster than my brother. And,\nin fact I got very low grades in French when I studied, because I used to talk in\nclass. So \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 I\u2019ve put that \u2014 I\u2019ve also blocked that out, I mean, I \u2014 I know that, I \u2014 I accept it,\nI \u2014 now, 1-if I absolutely have to talk French, I might understand some. I understand\na bit. But I don\u2019t \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 in \u2014 in fact, in Israel, in Mitzpe Ramon there are a\nlot of French people, and I find the French very snobby about the language, so I\ndon\u2019t \u2014 I say, okay, I don\u2019t talk French. But [indecipherable] I can understand a\nlittle, because I studied a bit, right? When I wa \u2014 when I\u2019m in France, I \u2014 the few\ntimes that I was in France, I was able to talk to people in the street, but not to\npeople that I know. Mental \u2014 good mental block. But \u2014",
        "Q: Why do you think that mental block\u2019s there?",
        "A: Probably there are things that I don\u2019t want to remember, I mean, that\u2019s quite\nclear, you know. Okay.\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "Q: But it\u2019s interesting, you know, when one has a mental block, when I think about\nit in my own life, there are har \u2014 there are some \u2014 there are some parts that have\nbeen hard, and if someone were to ask me to reconstruct them, it would not be easy.\nI remember that they existed. I remember, let\u2019s say, a basic story about them, but\nnot necessarily a specific within it, or certainly not a timeline. But I know that they\nwere there, you know, I \u2014 I was conscious when these events happened. And that\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s surprising for me 1s, when you\u2019re not conscious, you don\u2019t \u2014 you just don\u2019t\nremember something. Then the question 1s \u2014 1s, is there a reason why you have no\ncuriosity about it, or do you think you have no curiosity about it?",
        "A: I\u2019ve kind of never went too deeply into it because I just like my life, and I \u2014 I\nsaid, this is what happened, and I \u2014 you don\u2019t go back. You don\u2019t go back. You\ncannot solve \u2014 you\u2019re right, you can find out, yes, your roots, and \u2014 and things like\nthat, but I\u2019m sure like there are reasons why I-I \u2014 I do \u2014I do a lot of sewing so I can\nsay, oh yeah, well, my parents were also \u2014",
        "Q: In that profession.",
        "A: \u2014 tailors, in that profession. I do a lot of \u2014 I\u2014 I do artwork. I don\u2019t know whether\nthere\u2019s a connection there. But to me that\u2019s just to go \u2014 you can\u2019t go backwards, you\ncan only go forwards. So that\u2019s why I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t s \u2014\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "Q: So, isn\u2019t it difficult sometimes, being with people who \u2014 who have another need,\nthe \u2014 the need to go backwards? How do you \u2014 how does that \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s [indecipherable] had become difficult for me, that difficult perhaps for\nthem, but not for \u2014 I don\u2019t find it \u2014 that it\u2019s difficult for me. I look at it, you know, it\n\u2014 these are facts that you can\u2019t change, and I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t feel that knowing more\nabout it \u2014 I learned now from \u2014 from my brother, who seems to know much \u2014 so\nmuch more. But he\u2019s a \u2014 for instance, he doesn\u2019t remember me as part of \u2014 1n his \u2014\nin his life, and I don\u2019t remember him in that wa \u2014",
        "Q: In that early life in France?",
        "A: \u2014 in -\u2014 yeah. So there\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: That was going to be one of my questions.",
        "A: Yeah, so it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s a \u2014I say, okay, I mean, I\u2019ve totally blocked it out, but \u2014 and he\nhasn\u2019t, but there\u2019s still a lot of things that he also doesn\u2019t \u2014 hasn\u2019t been able to relate\nto or to see clearly, or to understand clearly. And again, that for some \u2014 maybe\nbecause I live in Israel, and that\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014 my life 1s \u2014 1s my life as it is, and\nwithout complications of my past. For me, I mean.\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "Q: When you got \u2014 what I guess I'd like to try and trace is, when you got to the\nUnited States, or even if it was earlier, even though you were a child, a young child\nearlier, do you remember conversations coming up, about the war, about the\nHolocaust, about murders?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did your paren \u2014 your adopted parents, what were they like?",
        "A: Oh, they were very good people, very nice people, very giving. I don\u2019t remember\ntoo much, if they talked very much about the war, but was \u2014 it was always a \u2014 it was\nnot like \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a hidden fact that we were adopted, we were \u2014 it was something\nthat we were \u2014 we knew about. It wasn\u2019t sudden \u2014 suddenly we learned that we\nwere adopted, and where we came from. But I \u2014 I think I just kind of like, you\nknow, fit in as quickly as possible. Like for instance, learning English. I \u2014 I believe\nthat within about two months I was talking English, I was fluent in it.",
        "Q: And do you have memories of your brother being able to, or having \u2014 struggling\nwith that?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Okay. How did your adoptive parents cross your path? Do you remember \u2014",
        "A: How did they what?\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "Q: How did they cross your path? Do you have memories of the first time you met\nthem?",
        "A: No. Only through what they once \u2014 what they \u2014 my father told me \u2014 both of\nthem, that when they came to the orphanage \u2014 they came to visit your \u2014 1n yo \u2014 they\ncame to Europe and my father, who was very \u2014 an ardent Zionist, decided that the\nbest way to find out what the situation was, was by going to an \u2014 a Jewish\norphanage, and that\u2019s how he \u2014 I-I don\u2019t know exactly what the procedure was, but\nthat\u2019s how he came to that orphanage, and he always said that he \u2014 he saw me, and\ndecided because they didn\u2019t have children of their own, he decided to ad \u2014 to adopt\nme. And my mother at the time didn\u2019t want \u2014 my adopted mother didn\u2019t want\nanything to do with it, because she was not feeling well at \u2014 at that \u2014 this was in \u00b047.\nAnd \u2014 but he \u2014 it was his decision, basically, and they said there\u2019s also a brother.\n[indecipherable] said, okay, we\u2019ll take both of them. But I don\u2019t remember the\nsituation, I don\u2019t in \u2014 in any way.",
        "Q: Aside from the trees, what would be other early memories that you can recall?",
        "A: Only \u2014 yes \u2014",
        "Q: It doesn\u2019t have to be Holocaust related, they could be about anything, just \u2014 just\n\u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 what comes to your mind?\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "A: Ah, there was \u2014 okay, there was one \u2014 as I said before, there was \u2014 hearing\nchildren yell out something about Jews.",
        "Q: Was it a mean yelling out?",
        "A: Maybe \u2014 yeah, I think so. And, again this \u2014 this interior decorator said to me that\nwe went to school, evidently, and in order to go to school, we left the orphanage\nand passed a Catholic school. So, perhaps that kind of \u2014 so, for \u2014 at that point, that\nexplained to me why I remember something like that. The details, nothing at all,\nright. And there was one other thing of someone \u2014 and again, I\u2019ve never delved into\nit, because it\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a pleasant thing to remember, about \u2014 something\nabout a tree, and a \u2014 interestingly enough, I had a time when I di\u2014 I would paint a\nlot of trees. And someone once decided that it wou \u2014 it showed that I \u2014 my \u2014 I\nhadn\u2019t \u2014 that I didn\u2019t have roots, and that was why I was drawing trees. And I said,\nfine, that\u2019s, you know, pretty clear, and understandable. But there was one thing that\nthere was a mat \u2014 someone who had a lot of keys, and I think there was a name\ncalled zoo or zoe or something like that. And this could have been a dream, or it\ncould have been something in detail, that someone was hanging from a tree, that\u2019s\nall I remember. I mean, that\u2019s \u2014 it was never made \u2014 never clear, and I really don\u2019t \u2014\nI\u2019m not all that interested to know too much about that. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Was it a shadow?\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "A: A shadow, or \u2014",
        "Q: A shadow of a person on that tree, was it \u2014 or \u2014",
        "A: I can\u2019t even say. Just someone hanging on a tree, or hanging on a tree. Like a \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. It doesn\u2019t bring \u2014 it doesn\u2019t bring up a \u2014 a \u2014 a pleasant image whatso \u2014 at\nall.",
        "A: No, no, no. So, I put it out \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 it was there. When I was much younger,\nit would \u2014 it would \u2014 I would think about it now and then, but I \u2014 I pushed it out,\nand \u2014",
        "Q: Did you feel different than other children in the United States?",
        "A: I think only in the \u2014 well, that\u2019s \u2014 I think that\u2019s why I se \u2014 I learned English very\nquickly, because kids in the s \u2014 in the neighborhood would call me Frenchie, and I\ndecided I didn\u2019t \u2014 I wanted to be American, again, as quickly as I could.",
        "Q: And did you feel different than other children because you were adopted, and\nyou knew you were adopted?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember that feeling. Maybe in the first few months, or the first\nyear, because we did go to a private school for one year. And then, when we went to\ngrammar school, we would put \u2014 we were put back a year. And I never made up\nthat year, whereas Jack did, because it wasn\u2019t \u2014 because I\u2019d become friends with \u2014\nNovember 7, 2008\nwith kids that were \u2014 I was with, so, it was enough, I-I didn\u2019t need to go \u2014 go ahead\none year. So no, I don\u2019t think I felt too different.",
        "Q: Can you describe to me a little bit about \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t know how to express\nthis in a way that doesn\u2019t sound much too \u2014 too many big words.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: But how does \u2014 how did you form your \u2014 I mean, most of the time children form\ntheir identity from all of these building blocks that are part of their past. That\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily mean they stay there, but that\u2019s what they have to start with.\nThey have this building block, this one, this one, this one, and then later they can\nsay, well, I want part of this one, I want part of that one, I don\u2019t want the rest. And\nlittle by little they start forming their identity. What formed yours? How did you\nform yours? What things did you choose to become who you are?",
        "A: I think I was very influenced by the \u2014 by the Israeli \u2014 I think also \u2014 okay, we\u2019re \u2014\nwhen I came to America, I remember my father would \u2014 used to make records of\nus, he \u2014 he liked to sing and we \u2014 he made records of \u2014 of us talking 1n \u2014 and I\nremember one of the \u2014 even \u2014 no, even before I spoke English, I mensh \u2014 I thi \u2014\nfrom the orphanage, we were ma \u2014 we were oriented to think about Israel, and I\nthink that that was like \u2014 that was always my \u2014 my direction, 1s to come to Israel,\nwhich I did, very \u2014 as soon as I-I finished at th \u2014 sorry. When I ca \u2014 when I \u2014 in one\nNovember 7, 2008\nof the tapes that we made, I said that I wanted to come to Palestine. And this was\nlike very early in \u20141n the process. So I think that was always what pushed me\nalong. And because my parents, especially my father, was so much into Israel\nhimself, it always \u2014",
        "Q: It was natural.",
        "A: It was very natural. And I became involved in youth groups, Young Judaea, as\nin high school, before high school, you know, in high school at least \u2014",
        "Q: Where did you grow up here? What \u2014 what si \u2014",
        "A: In Union \u2014 well, we started out in Newark, New Jersey, and then in Union,\nNew Jersey. And in \u2014 when I was in my last year, or my la \u2014 no, I think in my se \u2014\nor junior \u2014 between my junior and senior year of high school, I came \u2014 I went to\nIsrael with Young Judaea.",
        "Q: That was the first time?",
        "A: That was the first time. And afterwards I said I was moving \u2014 I was coming back\nto Israel. And, in fact, in my year book it says I\u2019m known for wanting to go to\nIsrael. So, I\u2014 I was ac \u2014 active in young Judea, wa \u2014 I decided to go to u\u2014 I went to\nuniversity for \u2014 first, and \u2014 because my parents had said, you know, finish\nuniversity, and then do whatever you want. And I realized that was a good a \u2014 good\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "Q: Where did you go to school?",
        "A: Temple University. Studied art, fine arts, and art education. And I finished and I\nwent to Israel for a year, and I\u2019m now \u2014 that was in \u201963, and I\u2019m still living there,\nSO \u2014",
        "Q: And does \u2014 is \u2014 is Israel more home than the United States ever was?",
        "A: Israel is home. I don\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t say more home, because I feel very much at\nhome in \u2014 in America because I grew up here. Yet, not here in this area, but in \u2014 in\nJersey for instance, there\u2019s no more a \u2014 when my parents were alive, New Jersey\nfelt very much part of me, and it was \u2014 it\u2019s always easier \u2014 easy for me to come to\nAmerica, because I love it, right, I speak English, and there\u2019s no problem there, so\n\u2014 and I \u2014I like some of the things that I see in America, but oh, you, the sun is in\nyour eyes. Do you want to move? Do you edit afterwards?",
        "Q: I stopped it, right now.",
        "A: Okay, yeah.",
        "Q: I paused it. Or, put it this way, I paused it, and we\u2019ll just move to these chairs\nhere.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "Q: Okay. Here we go. I was hoping the sun was going to go in the other direction.\nSo, record, okay. So, you were saying that Israel is home, but you felt at home here\nas well, having grown up here.",
        "A: Yes, yes, it\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: So how did \u2014 how did these other parts of that early life that you don\u2019t\nremember, that \u2014 that was blocked out, at what point did they come in \u2014 at what\npoint would you be reminded, or would some pe \u2014 point, some piece of information\ncome up? Do you have \u2014",
        "A: Only when I come here and \u2014 no, basically only when I come here and I hear\nabout things that my brother knows about and reads ab \u2014 o-or has been involved\nwith. So, it\u2019s all. I was part of that too, but that\u2019s as far as it goes, because I go back\nhome and \u2014 and \u2014 home to Israel, and get into my work and \u2014",
        "Q: And your \u2014 your parents from Poland came to France, your brother wasn\u2019t that\nmuch older than you were.",
        "A: Two years older.\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "Q: Two years older. But did he have any direct memories of them, that he would tell\nyou, or that he would share with you, as you were kids still?",
        "A: No, no. I \u2014 he may have had, yes, but we were not close to \u2014 we didn\u2019t \u2014 I do \u2014\nwe \u2014 for instance, we \u2014 we lived in Newark, we went to grammar school, but then\nwe moved to Union, and he was already in high school, but \u2014 and still in Newark,\nand I \u2014 when we moved to Union, I started high school in Union, some \u2014 our paths\nwa-wa-was like, you know, I didn\u2019t know his friends, because he was in a different\nhigh school. So we were very much apart, and then he went off to college, and I was\nstill in high school, and we were very, very much apart, I think.",
        "Q: Well, you had \u2014 when \u2014 if you were eight years old when you came to the\nUnited States, and let\u2019s say normally it \u2014 you know, a teenager finishes high school\nat 17, you had less than a decade where you were living together. A decade 1s still a\ndecade, but \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, but not \u2014 no, really \u2014",
        "Q: Not really, less.",
        "A: \u2014 there was too many aga \u2014 because he went to a different high school, so our\npaths weren\u2019t similar. I became very involved in \u2014 in youth group in Young\nJudaea, he didn\u2019t want \u2014 it didn\u2019t happen with him. I went to overnight camps, I\nNovember 7, 2008\ndon\u2019t think he did. Well, maybe he did one time. I used to love to go, and he didn\u2019t,\nas far as I know.",
        "Q: Can you tell me what those camps gave you?",
        "A: He\u2019s a math \u2014 he\u2019s a mathematician, I\u2019m into art. It\u2019s like, you know, we\u2019re two\nplanets apart. I don\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: Well, here\u2019s an irony, without knowing \u2014 without knowing you at all, and not\nhaving talked to your brother, it sounds that you were the person who certainly\nfound an identity in being Jewish, and then looking to Israel as a place that would\nbe for you, your direction, and he did not. And yet \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 when you look at the Holocaust, and looking at what were those early years\nthat are so murky, you have less interest in it, and he has more.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And there\u2019s a certain irony in that, you know?",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: I\u2019m also the only one in the whole family that \u2014 that moved to Israel and that\nbecame \u2014 that decided Israel was the place for me. Which probably came from my\nadopted \u2014 well, no, I think that came way before, from the orphanage. Because\nNovember 7, 2008\nagain, when I came I said, I\u2019m coming to \u2014 I wi \u2014 want to go to Palestine. I was\neven, I think, kosher at the time, as I\u2014 I was very concerned about what I was\neating when I first came to America.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: But I remember some \u2014 I don\u2019t remember more than an episode, but I remember\nthe episode, and it \u2014 some kind of a context of that episode. And then there\u2019s a next\nmemory that could have been a year later, could have been a year and a half later.\nBut some \u2014 a little bit is \u2014 something 1s there. And so that\u2019s why when you see me\nperplexed, I am \u2014 I\u2019m truly perplexed, you know, of \u2014\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "A: Because it\u2019s never als \u2014 it\u2019s never really bothered me that I don\u2019t remember these\nthings, because I\u2019ve always believed for myself that I\u2019m \u2014 I can\u2019t relive my past,\nand it\u2019s not going to change really, who I am, for me. I \u2014 I accept anyone who wants\nto delve into \u2014 into that, and \u2014 and to dig out things, and \u2014 like, Pll accept people\nthat feel that if they go to psychiatric treatment, you know, and find out what their\npast was, and they \u2014 they \u2014 I accept that people need that, and somehow, for some\nreason \u2014 I don\u2019t say I don\u2019t need it, I just don\u2019t \u2014 haven\u2019t felt that I need to \u2014 to\nsearch that. Which is perhaps perplexing.",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s perplexing, but it\u2019s also a choice that no one else can say you should or\nshould not do, you know, it 1s \u2014 1t is an each individual choice. It is \u2014 but these\nthings that happen, in some way or another, they form our identity. So what kind of\na person do we become using those various pieces? And I think that that\u2019s one of\nthe \u2014 I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why people do go back into that, they ta \u2014\nthey take something that they remembered, or experienced, and it shaped them, you\nknow, and how did it shape them? And so that\u2019s what, you know, sometimes we \u2014",
        "A: Well, I think \u2014 I think that wa \u2014 what did shape me was the fact that we were \u2014\nwhat I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember details, but I know that I came to America with the idea\nthat I was going to move to Palestine.",
        "Q: And where from that \u2014\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "A: So that did shape me.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t understand how it didn\u2019t affect my brother, but that\u2019s because, again,\nwhen we \u2014 we\u2019d been so different, and always were very different. And that\u2019s what\n\u2014 that\u2019s what guided me.",
        "Q: Can you tell me, what did \u2014 and \u2014 and I say this from complete ignorance: I\u2019m\nnot Jewish, and I\u2019ve not \u2014 not been to Israel, and I\u2019d like to hear what about it\nspoke to you. What articulated in a certain way, and \u2014",
        "A: At the time \u2014 look, I \u2014 again, I came the first time with a youth group. I was not a\n\u2014I wa -\u2014hadn\u2019t finished high school yet, and it was very exciting, I remember this \u2014\nalso a very young country still. In \u201950 \u2014 it was \u00b057 that I went, right, so it was only\nwhat, not even 10 years old. And it was \u2014 it was just li \u2014 we traveled a lot, and 1s a \u2014\nas a\u2014 aS a young person just traveling like that, it just affected me.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a lot of fun.",
        "A: And it was also a very free feel \u2014 a very \u2014 it\u2019s not what it 1s today, right? It was\nvery free, very easy, very warm. If you ask someone how to get someplace, they\ntake you there at the time. It ma \u2014 1t may not happen today, but there 1s an easiness\nabout Israelis, a warmness like, about Israelis that \u2014 that really pulls you. And again,\ntoday it\u2019s very different because it\u2019s become much more Americanized as well\nNovember 7, 2008\n[indecipherable]. And bigger. So, it\u2019s not the same thing that it was when I first \u2014\nwhen I first came to Israel, and I was \u2014 excitedly, I mean, I \u2014 you know, oh, I\u2019m\ngonna come back to Israel, and I just did that, that\u2019s all I did.",
        "Q: I belong.",
        "A: I\u2014 yeah. I didn\u2019t have to identify as a Jew, I was a Jew. Everyone is a Jew,\nbasically [indecipherable]. You didn\u2019t have to \u2014 I don\u2019t have to go to synagogue in\norder to prove that I\u2019m Jewish. I don\u2019t like religion to start out with, so I don\u2019t know\nwhen \u2014 if that happened then, or now, but I\u2019m very \u2014 I\u2019m not anti-religious, but I\ndon\u2019t \u2014 I think religion is a very big problem in our world, so \u2014 but, I mean, that\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s now my feelings today, after being the age that I am, and seeing what I \u2014\nwhat I see, everything. But it always just felt very much at home. So I came back,\nafter being two months with a bunch of kids, you know, and having a great time.\nAnd I was still belonging to \u2014 to Young Judaea at the time, and I became a leader\nin the movement. And I got kicked out because I would tell the truth. I li \u2014 I liked si\n\u2014 you know, I liked the facts to be clear. It wasn\u2019t a great, easy place to be, and I\u2019m\n\u2014I would tell kids this, you know, that\u2019s not good, you have to tell them to \u2014 you\nknow, to come. And I don\u2019t see the point in doing that, so \u2014",
        "Q: What was it that got you kicked out?\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "A: Because I \u2014 I just never \u2014I didn\u2019t want to lie about what Israel was. It wasn\u2019t an\neasy place to come to live in. It still isn\u2019t an easy place to come to live in. And if\nyou want \u2014 decide that you want to come, you ha \u2014 I think you have to be aware of\nthat, and not what the Jewish agency will tell you, because that\u2019s a bunch of lies\nsometimes.",
        "Q: But you know, it\u2019s pretty harsh to kick someone out who has such a passion for a\nplace.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, because \u2014",
        "Q: You got over it, huh?",

It didn\u2019t stop me from doing what I wanted to do, was\nfine. I have \u2014 I\u2019m going in my direction.

And it came from our home, so the fact that my brother wa \u2014 I\n\u2014 it always also amazes me, and no one really, in the family came to that decision to\ndo that.

        "A: Okay. It\u2019s a much warmer place, not just \u2014 not just physically, but people are\nvery giving, very, very tough, but very soft inside. Like this \u2014 what they call the\nNovember 7, 2008\nsabra, which is the fruit of Israel, and it\u2019s prickly on the outside, and soft and sweet\non the inside. And this is what the sabra \u2014 that\u2019s what an Israeli born person is like.\nAnd that\u2019s, I think, probably one of the things that \u2014 that attracted me.

So I spoke French.\nAnd [indecipherable] and after about three months, my boss said, maybe 1n five\nyears we'll become partners. And I looked at him and I said, this is not the place for\nme. Because this was outside of Tel Aviv, it was in a little place that was \u2014Is \u2014I -\nI don\u2019t know what I was doing there.

And I\nworked for \u201cThe Jerusalem Post\u2019 doing graphic work.

The other\ncousins, I\u2019ve manage \u2014 I\u2019ve \u2014 a few times, in fact, let\u2019s \u2014 the father \u2014 the father, who\npassed away already a long time ago, who put \u2014 blamed my parents for the fact that\nwe didn\u2019t speak French, I never \u2014 after that I never have come \u2014 I haven\u2019t had\ncontact with them. And there was one time like about, I don\u2019t know, I think 10 - 11\n- 12 years ago that I went with Jack and his wife Judy, we went to France, and we\nwent \u2014 my cousins Sallah(ph) and George for dinner, and this man who knew we\nwere coming \u2014 the \u2014 well, she\u2019s the cousin, actually, his wife, but they were on\nvacation. They knew we were coming. I \u2014 to me, that\u2019s enough to not even search\nfor them. And Jack, without a \u2014 he-he-he calls them up, they were in Nice, and then\nhe asks \u2014 he puts me on the phone, and the guy just starts out about how quelle\nNovember 7, 2008\ndomage, I don\u2019t speak \u2014 don\u2019t speak French. And I said, well, it\u2019s too bad you don\u2019t\nspeak English, and I gave the phone back to my brother. He wants to make contact\nwith the \u2014 with these people, fine. I have no \u2014 no problem with that. I don\u2019t need the\ncontact with someone like that. And again, they made no great effort to \u2014 to keep us\nin contact, and they knew how to \u2014 to reach us, how to find us. They knew where\nwe were. So \u2014",
        "Q: You know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I felt \u2014 me \u2014 I think I\u2019m sure that\u2019s part of the \u2014 obviously part of the \u2014 it\u2019s\nblocked out because it\u2019s not \u2014 I mean \u2014 in fact, I\u2019m also [background noise] happy\nthat I didn\u2019t grow up in France, you know\u201d I find the French very sloppy, that\nlanguage, and a lot of things, even though \u2014",

        "Q: I'd say about another 15 minutes, and that will be it, may \u2014 yeah, something like\nthat, all right?",
        "A: I haven\u2019t talked so much in a long, long time.",
        "Q: Well, I \u2014 it\u2019s interesting, you know? It \u2014 it \u2014 and I \u2014 and I appreciate that you\u2019re\ntalking to me and I\u2019m a total stranger, you know.",
        "A: Perhaps that\u2019s why.",
        "Q: That \u2014 sometimes that happens, you know. I re \u2014 I remember \u2014 and one of the\nreasons I don\u2019t put my voice on the recorder is because, one of the things that\u2019s\nartificial, is that I\u2019d love to jump in and so \u2014 you know, you say something and I\nwant to say, oh yeah, that reminds me of x,y,z and I have to remember that 10 years\ndown the line, if someone\u2019s listening to this, they don\u2019t care about my x,y,z, you\nknow. But let me run this thought by you. They say that very often, psychologists\nsay that children who were adopted have a sense \u2014 well, this I will put out, cause\nit\u2019s \u2014 here\u2019s the \u2014 here\u2019s the thought that occurs to me, and I wonder whether any of\nit fits. Okay, another one of [background noise] Okay. I hope that \u2014 I hope that this\nis fine and we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re recording. There are \u2014 there 1s this thought among\npsychologists that children who have been adopted, and know that they are adopted,\nNovember 7, 2008\nand had the good luck to grow up in a \u2014 in a loving family, sometimes nevertheless\nhave a feeling inside that someone at one point rejected them, because they were\nadopted in the first place. Somebody in the early part of their lives. It doesn\u2019t \u2014 it\nsometimes doesn\u2019t have any connection to reality. I mean, they may know, for\nexample, that my mother did not want to give me up, my mother would have\npreferred to keep me, but she gave me up. But that there was a certain kind of\nrejection, and \u2014 that was experienced anyway, even though consciously you know\nthat that other person\u2019s, the birth mother\u2019s circumstances could have been such that\nthey had no choice. And when I hear you speak about the relatives that were blood\nrelatives in France, it sounds that they had no great interest to keep up ties.",
        "A: That, definitely yes, I mean, I \u2014 I see that, I feel that. And, again, I\u2019ve given \u2014 if\nthey annoyed me enough \u2014 also, very \u2014 I think make decisions, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s\nnot making \u2014 not always logical, but this is fact for me. I don\u2019t \u2014 I would not go out\nof my way to change these facts. This is what it 1s, and that\u2019s okay, but I will not go\nbegging to these people to be \u2014 to what, to accept me? I mean, this \u2014 I\u2019m your\nrelative. To this day we have no \u2014 I\u2019ve been to their home, stayed with them once\nwhile back there, some years way, way back. I made the effort to come to visit\nthem. Their daughters then came to me in \u2014 1n Israel. They were \u2014 I was \u2014 they\nreally annoyed me, because they just expected that you \u2014 to \u2014 to do everything. I\u2019m\nNovember 7, 2008\nnot used to that kind of thing, I was \u2014 didn\u2019t grow up that way. So it would \u2014 it just\n\u2014 and they \u2014 again, they never made any more effort to keep in touch with me, at\nleast this particular set of relatives. The others, yes, they\u2019ve made every effort, and\nwe stay in touch. So they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re fine. I \u2014 I\u2014 we\u2019re not that close, but still 1t\u2019s \u2014\nit\u2019s a feeling that they \u2014 yes, they\u2019re my relatives, I accept them that way. I can\u2019t \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t feel as close to them, perhaps, as relatives in America, but what they are, it\u2019s\nokay. S \u2014 not \u2014 I do \u2014 I\u2019m not angry with them, I am probably angry \u2014 I definitely,\nnot probably, I \u2014 of course, I \u2014",
        "Q: Well, I guess that\u2019s \u2014 I wasn\u2019t putting \u2014 I wasn\u2019t going to put the word on it, but\nthere was a certain kind of \u2014 yeah, something there which is \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Especially when the \u2014 the father of these \u2014 these relatives, blame people who \u2014\nwho gave so much to me, and to Jack and to them. So, and then to blame them?\nWell, but did you make any effort to bring me to France, to remind me of who \u2014\nwho \u2014 what my background is? Nothing. So, why \u2014",

        "Q: Different people.",
        "A: \u2014 in our reactions to things. We\u2019re very different in everything, so it\u2019s not\nunusual.",
        "Q: What about the French family that hid you? Do you have any contact or\nknowledge of them?",
        "A: Yeah, no, I don\u2019t \u2014 he \u2014 he did. He went to \u2014 he went to meet them, he \u2014 he even\n\u20141n fact, he\u2019s \u2014 he gave me a letter that they wrote. I think that the \u2014 the parents\nhave since passed away, but their daughters and they \u2014 they\u2019re alive, and he \u2014 he did\nmeet with them, and I never \u2014 I never \u2014 I never made the contact.

I\u2014 I was here because my \u2014 Jack\u2019s wife\u2019s dau \u2014 daughter\ngot married, so they kept saying please come, please come, and I came. And then\nthere was the conference, I said, okay I\u2019ll come to the conference as well.\nNovember 7, 2008",
        "Q: Have you ever been any \u2014 to any other Holocaust related conference? And when",
        "A: No, no. And I don\u2019t think that I would make an effort to come. Maybe after \u2014\nafter this time, I might. I know there was one in Jerusalem last year, I didn\u2019t \u2014\ndidn\u2019t go to it. I don\u2019t \u2014 I also \u2014I don\u2019t like even seeing movies of \u2014 of that time. I\ndon\u2019t like repetitions of the whole thing. I know it happened, I know it was, but\nokay, I \u2014 I think \u2014 again, I believe that we should go forward, and not to \u2014",
        "Q: So where \u2014 yes, but where is \u2014 where \u2014 what about it is where you say, how\ncould \u2014 I don\u2019t know exactly how \u2014 how to phrase this, but what about it 1s\nrepetitious?

        "A: I don\u2019t know. Everyone, I \u2014 I believe it gives everyone something.

No, if it fills you and it gives you some meaning, I think\nyou should do as much as you can. Which is, for instance, one thing that I\u2019ve said to\nJack, well, you know, you need that, go and do it, it\u2019s \u2014 but don\u2019t involve me in\nsomething that I don\u2019t feel that I could do.

I mean, I work in an organization\nwhich is dedicated to this. But there are fundamental Christians who need to bring\nthe gospel to everybody. And part of how they interpret fundamental Christ \u2014 how\nthey interpret their mission as Christians is that they\u2019re not good Christians unless\nthey share the gospels, you know?

I \u2014 I think sometimes\nI\u2019m more religious some \u2014 than these all that, you know, because I think what I \u2014\nwhat I say is my \u2014 my word is definitely my word, I don\u2019t go back on it. I don\u2019t\nthink that if you\u2019re going to fast it makes you a better person. Many things that I\njust think you have to be wi \u2014 you have to be straight with yourself in your life, and\nthat\u2019s what\u2019s important to me.

        "A: Ah, yeah. No, I don\u2019t know whether I would want to tell her something, but once\nI went to \u2014 in \u20141in Israel we have a lot of people that read coffee cups, and I used to\nlove to go to the, like coffee cups or cards, tarot cards or \u2014 not tarot cards, but\nmainly coffee cups. And especially at that ttme when in \u2014 when I was in Israel at\nfirst, these were usually very primitive women, who were so wise. My \u2014 but one\nwoman said to me \u2014 I came there and she said, she wa \u2014 suddenly said, you have\ntwo mothers. And she said I would meet my \u2014 my \u2014 the \u2014 the other mother like in\nNovember 7, 2008\n15 years, right? And, well, I was tripped out by it. I-I said, wow, this, you know,\nthis is going to be very interesting. I know that it\u2019s not right, but still, maybe \u2014\nmaybe it was. [indecipherable] you know.",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: Must have been in the mid-60s or late 60s or something like that. Of course, 15\nyears passed and nothing ever happened, so \u2014 but it was \u2014 it \u2014 for a long time it was\nin my head, but why? What would happen if I did meet her, if the \u2014",

        "A: Yes, yes. Uncanny, but again I think \u2014 no, she wasn\u2019t \u2014 she was just very wise in\nthat I believe she asked me what, at first, what my mother\u2019s name was. And I\nstupidly said Rose, but it\u2019s not my real mother\u2019s name. So, maybe I said that.\nSomething, something made it clear to her, because a-again, they pick up on your \u2014\nthe way you sit, the way you talk, what you say. You know, every little thing, they\nknew exactly how to \u2014 how to interpret it, and I\u2014 I remember once after this, I was\nvisiting friends in Tel Aviv, and I said to them, oh I can \u2014 I \u2014 I could read your\ncoffee cup, you know. And I did the same thing. And they said [indecipherable] I\nNovember 7, 2008\nsaid, don\u2019t be ridiculous, I just \u2014 I\u2019m telling you what you want to hear, you know,\nand so it\u2019s \u2014",

I remember, let\u2019s say, a basic story about them, but\nnot necessarily a specific within it, or certainly not a timeline. But I know that they\nwere there, you know, I \u2014 I was conscious when these events happened.

So I spoke French.\nAnd [indecipherable] and after about three months, my boss said, maybe 1n five\nyears we'll become partners. And I looked at him and I said, this is not the place for\nme.

But we\u2019ve never real \u2014 well, again, I don\u2019t think\nI made any great effort to sit with them and get all that information. And if you te \u2014\naga \u2014 last \u2014 the last time I was in Paris, they were busy, and we \u2014 I had \u2014 we met\nonce for dinner at their house. I slept one weekend there, because the place where I\nwas staying, I had to \u2014 I-I couldn\u2019t stay with who \u2014 it was a friend of mine, I\ncouldn\u2019t stay that weekend so, they allowed me to stay.

The other\ncousins, I\u2019ve manage \u2014 I\u2019ve \u2014 a few times, in fact, let\u2019s \u2014 the father \u2014 the father, who\npassed away already a long time ago, who put \u2014 blamed my parents for the fact that\nwe didn\u2019t speak French, I never \u2014 after that I never have come \u2014 I haven\u2019t had\ncontact with them. And there was one time like about, I don\u2019t know, I think 10 - 11\n- 12 years ago that I went with Jack and his wife Judy, we went to France, and we\nwent \u2014 my cousins Sallah(ph) and George for dinner, and this man who knew we\nwere coming \u2014 the \u2014 well, she\u2019s the cousin, actually, his wife, but they were on\nvacation. They knew we were coming. I \u2014 to me, that\u2019s enough to not even search\nfor them. And Jack, without a \u2014 he-he-he calls them up, they were in Nice, and then\nhe asks \u2014 he puts me on the phone, and the guy just starts out about how quelle\nNovember 7, 2008\ndomage, I don\u2019t speak \u2014 don\u2019t speak French. And I said, well, it\u2019s too bad you don\u2019t\nspeak English, and I gave the phone back to my brother. He wants to make contact\nwith the \u2014 with these people, fine. I have no \u2014 no problem with that. I don\u2019t need the\ncontact with someone like that. And again, they made no great effort to \u2014 to keep us\nin contact, and they knew how to \u2014 to reach us, how to find us. They knew where\nwe were. So \u2014",

Somebody in the early part of their lives. It doesn\u2019t \u2014 it\nsometimes doesn\u2019t have any connection to reality. I mean, they may know, for\nexample, that my mother did not want to give me up, my mother would have\npreferred to keep me, but she gave me up. But that there was a certain kind of\nrejection, and \u2014 that was experienced anyway, even though consciously you know\nthat that other person\u2019s, the birth mother\u2019s circumstances could have been such that\nthey had no choice.

I don\u2019t \u2014 I would not go out\nof my way to change these facts. This is what it 1s, and that\u2019s okay, but I will not go\nbegging to these people to be \u2014 to what, to accept me? I mean, this \u2014 I\u2019m your\nrelative. To this day we have no \u2014 I\u2019ve been to their home, stayed with them once\nwhile back there, some years way, way back. I made the effort to come to visit\nthem. Their daughters then came to me in \u2014 1n Israel.

I\u2019m\nNovember 7, 2008\nnot used to that kind of thing, I was \u2014 didn\u2019t grow up that way. So it would \u2014 it just\n\u2014 and they \u2014 again, they never made any more effort to keep in touch with me, at\nleast this particular set of relatives. The others, yes, they\u2019ve made every effort, and\nwe stay in touch. So they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re fine. I \u2014 I\u2014 we\u2019re not that close, but still 1t\u2019s \u2014\nit\u2019s a feeling that they \u2014 yes, they\u2019re my relatives, I accept them that way. I can\u2019t \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t feel as close to them, perhaps, as relatives in America, but what they are, it\u2019s\nokay.

And especially at that ttme when in \u2014 when I was in Israel at\nfirst, these were usually very primitive women, who were so wise. My \u2014 but one\nwoman said to me \u2014 I came there and she said, she wa \u2014 suddenly said, you have\ntwo mothers.
