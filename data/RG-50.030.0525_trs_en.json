        "Q: Right. And where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in a little village by the name of Botos, B-o-t-o-s, Hungarian village. It means the\nplace in which you trade, in Hungarian.",
        "Q: Place in which you trade.",
        "A: In which you trade, yeah.",
        "Q: So where is that near?",
        "A: That is presently in northern Serbia, just south of a town that the Hungarians call Szabadka.",

        "A: B-o-t-o-s, the Serbs spell it with a little hook on the S.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But it means absolutely nothing.",

        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right. And -- but very seriously speaking, my mom had given birth, she was a very tiny lady.\nMy dad was six foot two, 180 pounds, my mom was never more than 95 pounds, and after she\ngave birth to my brother, who was three years older, she was told never again to conceive\nbecause she had great problems with my brother. And somehow I -- I happened, and -- I had that\nfrom my grandmother. She was told by everybody to abort, to abort, to abort, because she\u2019d die\nin the process. And she said no, no, no, no, no. So I popped out, she survived, but she was so\nweak she never recovered. And eventually, five years later she died of galloping pneumonia,\nbecause she had no strength left. So from --",
        "Q: Galloping pneumonia.",
        "A: Yeah, galloping pneumonia. She was gone in six weeks because she had no defensive\nmechanism left.",

Looking, looking, and\nlooking from av -- as I was growing up he was always looking, and eventually found a woman.\nOf all of the races in the world, he found a German woman and got married to her in 1955.

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Anyway, it was in Botos and we were living in Suboditsa in Szabadka and then we were\nliving in Modbaskirk where my grandmother, my father\u2019s mother, had all kinds of properties.\nBut we originally come from Tameshwar. Tameshwar is Romania.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And after --",
        "Q: That was where your father was born.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, where my father was born in a village, a now big estate next to Tameshwar\ncalled Bukavitz. We had a big, big horse spread. [indecipherable] raising horses for racing and\nraising horses for the guard of the emperor. At that time there was still an emperor before 1918.\nIn mid 1918 with the Treaty of Trianon, that part of Austria-Hungary, Hungary fell to Romania.\nThe second part fell to the so-called Yugoslavs, eventually it was lost. And the third part was\nretained by Hungary. And in 1941 when the Nazis attacked Yugoslavia, Hungary quickly\nrecouped two of the three parts --",
        "Q: That [indecipherable] right.",
        "A: -- including the Barcika, borders within the Barcika. So it reverted back to Hungary.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So most of my education except three years, I have in Hungaria. I had had no education in\nGerman whatsoever because we had nothing to do -- we were Hungarian bourgeoisie of\nHuguenot background.",

        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But she was lying there and just suddenly she was just there, she was dead. And I -- I\nremember about two or three weeks before she eventually died, she stood up and baked for me\nand my brother -- and there 1s a fruit which is like a big pear, but it\u2019s not pear, they call it quitten\nin German. It makes marvelous jam, but it 1s not liquid jam, it is [indecipherable] jam and you\ncan cut it into slices, and it melts on your tongue.",
        "Q: Really.",
        "A: So she stood up for that, very painfully she was doing that, with the helper, Sophie, was our\nlady for all purposes. She had been with the family for two generations. It -- even at my time she\nalready about 60 years old. She eventually died at about 92 or 93, she had always been in the\nfamily. And she and my mom made that quitten [indecipherable] they\u2019d call it. And I grabbed it\nand sliced it up and brought it out to the street to my -- for my friends --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- because it was a delicacy and I remember my mom looking at me with -- very sad I\nunderstand, but I [indecipherable] I ha -- I made that for you. And I just kept on smiling. And I\nwas called, as a child, naturally in Hungarian, the smiling country.",
        "Q: The smiling country.",
        "A: Mosoly orszag.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Mosoly orszag, because before my mom died I had to smile just to cope with that problem of\nher illness, and after she died, my dad tells me I was smiling at everybody, hoping that somebody\nwould touch me and be good to me.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And Mosoly orszag in Hungarian 1s a very poetic term. It doesn\u2019t exist in any other\nlanguages. Orszag means world, country.",

        "Q: Exactly the same kind of -- were you close with your father?",
        "A: I was very close to my dad. My dad was sportsman, a horseman. He taught me very early\nhorsemanship and sportsmanship and I hit it off --",
        "Q: So he was really --",
        "A: -- really well with my dad.",
        "Q: You did.",
        "A: And my brother was more independent. Do-Don\u2019t forget please that in the 1920\u2019s and 30\u2019s,\nfathers were absolute rulers in the family.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: As had been their fathers. And the father would count -- the mother\u2019s words were listened to,\nbut they nev-never really amounted to much, except they had to be faithful to their -- to their\nhusbands, right --",
        "Q: To the husbands, yeah.",
        "A: -- remain [indecipherable] right. And my father always thought he knew exactly what my\nbrother and I would have to do. My father kept on telling me that I would have to become a\ndoctor of jurisprudence, and then I would have to go to the Hungarian minister of external affairs\nto become a diplomat. And he was -- we had big places in which to live. My brother the room\nand the bathroom, I had my room and my bathroom. And my room was the diplomat en zimmer.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That means the diplomat\u2019s room.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: My brother was the engineer\u2019s room, although my brother had no interest in engineering at\nall, so he and my dad were always fighting about. My brother was pigheaded, he was born in\nJune, June 22\", and he said, I want to be a merchant, I want to be a merchant, and I don\u2019t want\nto be a -- my dad said, but in ou-our family there are no merchants. And my brother said, well,\nwe\u2019 ll see about that. And -- and I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re interested in that, but my poor brother\nmanaged school just barely, out of spite. He was very, very bright. Was brighter than I would\never hope to be. And he barely studied and somehow he made it, so with my father\u2019s position,\nwho eventually recognized that my brother was not qualified to be in the gymnasium.\nGymnasium is the Hungarian term for university preparatory, secondary education, [speaks\nHungarian here], you see. My brother was eventually put into the [indecipherable] Akad\u00e9mia,\ninto the commercial academy, happy like a lark. Fell in love with his ma -- language teacher, did\na no-no, was expelled from school, and promptly talked my father into getting him an\napprenticeship in one of Austria\u2019s famous coffee peddling chains, Meiml, and becoming Meiml,\nM-e-i-m-1. Great coffee in Vienna. If you go to Vienna, go to a Meiml coffee shop, is to --\nsecond to none. And they also specialize in special imports, fruit and vegetable imports from the\ntropics, so my brother\u2019s dream was suddenly fulfilled. He was an apprentice, high class evide --\nMeiml is high class, high class apprentice at Meiml and said eventually I\u2019m going to take over\nthe store. And I recall by the time my brother was around, what four -- 17 - 18 years old -- he\nwas born \u201922, so it must have been 1939 I think, right? Suddenly he kept on a pyramid great\noranges, one at a time. And I was Baylor at home. Baylor is annelbare, okay? But baylor in\nHungarian is much cuter, and annelbare sounds hard. Baylor is somebody that you know of. The\nwhite one.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Baylor -- in Slavic Baylor means white collar, okay, so anyway -- and my pet name was\nUrchika. Urchika means the younger brother. The elder brother is called Bandiko. So when my\nbrother came home --",
        "Q: So who called you Urchika?",
        "A: Sorry? Urchika --",
        "Q: Urchika.",
        "A: I was ur -- Urchika.",
        "Q: Urchika.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And who called you that, your brother?",
        "A: My -- everybody.",
        "Q: Everybody.",
        "A: The whole family, I was Urchika, and because it was a status symbol. I was the second son.\nThe second sons had no rights, they would inherit nothing. But they were cute [indecipherable]\nand the brother was Bandiko. Bandiko in Hungarian means the young [indecipherable] while he\nwas growing up. At 15 - 16 he slowly became Bandi, the one expecting to inherit everything --",
        "Q: Every --",
        "A: -- and therefore carry on the names and the tradition, except he jumped off the tradition\nwagon, wanted to become a merchant, right?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And he brought home, I have to say [indecipherable] means, here you are, Urchika, a great\norange for you. Oh I loved my brother. And then he fell in love. Whatever I knew, I was -- he\nwas 19, I was 16.",
        "Q: 16.",
        "A: Totally innocent, unlike the boys and the girls today, I was just a dreaming little boy, wanting\nto work [indecipherable]",
        "Q: But he wasn\u2019t so innocent.",
        "A: My brother was a bit more experienced. He got expelled from school because he fell in love\nwith a -- there was a beautiful Hungarian teacher [indecipherable] she was teaching French and\nhe was enchanted by her upper structure. And somewhere along the line, during the intermission,\nhe [indecipherable] dared stick his hand up, and with the no-no.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Right?",
        "Q: So he was kicked out?",
        "A: But he eventually got [indecipherable] 1t was recognized as a juvenile prank, you see, and she\nkind of liked him, too. Anyway, he then fell in love with a Jewish girl. And that was something\nvery serious. I remember her hair, it was so shiny, dark jet black and big, big, big, big eyes. And\nI think she was the love of his -- she would have been the love of his life. And that was in 1940, I\nremember, and suddenly I didn't get the oranges, she got the oranges",
        "Q: She got the --",
        "A: [indecipherable] and then --",
        "Q: So tell m --",
        "A: So in the -- th-the Germans, or you --",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back a little bit.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to your -- your father. You said you -- that you were close to your father.",
        "A: My father -- my father was a confirmed monarchist, Austria Hungarian style. He had been to\nthe military academy, the -- like the Sandhurst equivalent was in Vienna Neustadt.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And in Budapest, it was two stages, one year each, and he was second lieutenant in 19 -- early\n1918. He fought in the first World War, a second lieutenant, and was hoping to have a career,\nbecause we had -- our family had had established solid linkages with the family, the royal family,\nwith the imperial family because they were -- my family was in horse breeding, especially horses\nto be picked from which the grenadier guard horses would be picked --",
        "Q: I see, I see.",
        "A: -- for the guard of the Kaiser. And he was hoping to enter the -- the -- he was the only child of\nhis grandmother, but the fifth child on my grandfather, because my grandfather, Lallier\ngrandfather\u2019s first wife died --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- after giving birth to --",
        "Q: Four --",
        "A: -- four children.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then he married -- my grandfather married my father\u2019s mother, with whom sh -- sh -- he\nhad only one child, my father.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And since the other four children were two daughters and two sons, they\u2019d already by\ntradition taken on their professional training. My father would have been the one to join the\narmy, and become a soldier, right? But he had also finished university, in terms of a law degree\nequivalent, but he never got a law degree. So he was a second lieutenant and the one disturbing\nnews I hear, which had great influence over him was that after Hungary capitulated and the B\u00e9la\nKun regime took power, my father demilitarized, was still wearing the officer\u2019s uniform without\nthe insignia, was accosted by a bunch of commies in the -- the central part of Budapest, was put\nup against the wall to be shot on the spot by the communists. And he tells me the League of\nNations representative, [indecipherable] Pallavicini, from Italy originally, happened to have been\ndriving through and happened to witness the almost killing of my dad and some other former\nofficers, and saved him.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So my father didn\u2019t get shot.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And eventually the B\u00e9la Kun regime was -- was defeated by Horthy -- not the nicest of all\nnice in the world, but highly more -- much more acceptable to [indecipherable] traditionally than\nthe commies ever would. My father became an avid communist hater. All his life he was a\ncommunist hater, and especially after the Soviets took power. And during the second World\nWar, be Tito taking power. And the Romanians falling to communism. My father knew that we\u2019d\nlose everything and we lost everything. We lost the possessions in wa -- in -- in Romania, we lost\nthe possessions in Hungary, albeit late in 1940, except for a villa. And do you know Hungary at\nall? Lake Balaton?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Lake Balaton used to have great, great inland sea. We had a beautiful little country house\nright on the lake, and lost everything what is not in Serbia today. And we lost even one particular\nvery 1-important little domain down on the Adriatic Sea. We lost everything. And the most\npainful loss was evidently the horse breeding, because not only did we lose that, but with the\nSoviets advancing 1944, they destroyed the whole thing, it was just [indecipherable] in Romania,\nand stooped -- stole all the remaining horses.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So we were left -- my grandmother was left only with two factories and one large estate,\nwhich we then lost to the Titoists.",
        "Q: So [indecipherable]",
        "A: So we are what we consider -- they would have called us higher bourgeoisie.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: In Hungarian terms.",
        "Q: So you were quite well off.",
        "A: We were very well off, yeah, but that\u2019s why -- that\u2019s why you see --",
        "Q: Yeah, but where were the hor -- where were the horses? I mean, why wa --",
        "A: They were at Tameshwar. Tameshwar --",
        "Q: Tameshwar.",
        "A: -- is Tymiswar --",
        "Q: Right --",
        "A: -- today.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And di -- whe -- and my dad was born on the Salas, the village by the name of Bukavitz.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the whole estate, the major estate of the horses was there.",
        "Q: Was that close enough to Botos so he would just --",
        "A: Ah, no, no, no --",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: Oh, a -- about -- let\u2019s see, no, but that would be about four hours car drive.",
        "Q: So what was he doing in Botos?",
        "A: He -- after the war, th -- we had a problem.",
        "Q: Ah no, dur -- bef-before.",
        "A: You mean, after the first World War.",
        "Q: Yes, after the first World War.",
        "A: It\u2019s a very important question, that.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Hungary having disintegrated, and big parts of Hungary having been chopped off, people\nliving in the chopped off areas had to make a choice of citizenship. My father never wanted to\ngive Austrian hi -- Austro-Hungarian citizenship, but Austro-Hungary didn\u2019t exist any more. It\nwas either Austria or Hungaria, or Romania, or -- they were still calling themselves the Kingdom\nof Serbs, Croats and Slavines. I think only in 1929 did they became Yugoslavia. Never loving\neach other, even killing each other in -- in Belgrade Parliament --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- would you believe that? Anyway, so he was traveling back and forth to try to take care of\nthe estates, but with the estates being in [indecipherable] because of expropriation rights,\nespecially minorities who had visibly remained Austro-Hungarian in spirit. My father was one of\nthose traveling back and forth, who remained Austro-Hungarians committed to the crown that\ndidn\u2019t exist, committed to the [indecipherable] in Budapest that didn\u2019t exist, but loving Horthy,\nbecause Horthy was claimed by the Hungarians to become the personal representative of the\ncrown, the Hungarians still hoping that one of the sons of Oto, the last Kaiser, would eventually\nbe invited back in. Which never happened, right?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So moving from one place to another, he sometimes took jobs. He spoke his five or six local\nlanguages, was [indecipherable] useful. So he worked for awhile. For the Hungarians he worked\nin administration. For the Romanians he didn\u2019t work, he -- [whisper]",
        "Q: He said what?",
        "A: For the rom -- he\u2019d never work for the Romanians.",
        "Q: The Romanians, he wouldn\u2019t do that.",
        "A: Gossip has it that 1f you want to go to a really corrupt country anywhere in Europe, you don\u2019t\nhave to go further than Romania.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Right? And he also worked for the Serbs in Dubocka where I was born --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- you see. And his last post there was, from what I remember, was -- you know kuntai, a -- in\nthe United States you have the states and the states have some divisions.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Of the main subdivisions, of te -- 10 - 15 - 20, we lived just on one or two towns. And back\nhome did have a chief administrative [indecipherable] officer, which is called a landrat in\nAustria.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: There\u2019s no such title, but I would call him a -- a -- a legal officer, chief legal administrative\nofficer of the whole region, containing up to 20 villages of one or two towns. Th-That was his\nlast job.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: You see, and it qualified him as a civil servant, but he never got any promotion, even though\nhe was -- my dad was, intellectually, a very self possessed person. Highly trained -- you know,\nit\u2019s in the blood after all generation [indecipherable] and some of these [indecipherable] for some\ntime bloomed forth a very fast thinker, very energetic, great sportsman, great writer. He thought\nhe was great in everything, including his hating the communists. But his hatred of communists\ndidn\u2019t prevent us from losing everything. I\u2019ve learned not to hate anything. But it\u2019s easy if you\nhave nothing, how can you -- you either hate everything or you hate nothing.",
        "Q: Did you grow up in Botos?",
        "A: I -- no, I was wa -- I think I grew -- was in Botos three years, and then we also had a smaller\nplace in a place where my mom died. Where did she die? Parage, P-a-r-a-g-e. Parage in\nHungarian, I don\u2019t know what it means. I -- it\u2019s just a name on that tiny village. We had another\nplace there and she was -- you know I -- wait now, I -- now I remember, actually. In Parage we\nhad a house, several hectares of land and a -- a well 200 meters deep.",

        "A: Now that\u2019s a lot of da -- depth, right? And how do I remember that? At me -- watermelon\ntime, our male servant, Ilya was his name, he was a Slav, kept on lowering the watermelons 200\nmeters down in the rope to have them ice cold before bringing them up. And I remember that\nbecause my mom\u2019s illness was somehow linked with that deep well, but I\u2019ve never found to what\nextent. I remember the water was enormously cold. My grandmother sometime splashed my\nbrother and I. She was in that time there too. And I [indecipherable] frigid. So maybe -- did she\ntake her bath in ice cold water, which Ilya had just brought her in a some -- something like that,\nshe developed galloping pneumonia, she was gone.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She died in Parage, she was buried in Parage.",
        "Q: I see, and swe --",
        "A: Even though we had no linkages with Parage whatsoever except that little place, which we\neventually lost.",
        "Q: Right. And after Parage, then where?",
        "A: After Parage we went to Brimuk, which is another Hungarian village in the Bauska. And from\nBrimuk he then -- he was transferred over, he went back to Tameshwar for two years, which was\nabout \u201832 to \u201834, and then he went back to our remaining properties in [indecipherable]. That was\nin the Barnot. Barcika is in the middle, Barnot is to the east of that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: [indecipherable] the Serbs call that Petrovgrad then, today they call it Zrenjanin, in which we\nhad two factories. And those were, because of its -- this possession\u2019s gradual by the heir\ncountries of parts of Hungary. We had lost everything in Romania and we had lost the thing over\nat the Adriatic, right? There still remained one house in Vienna, I remember that in the 19\ndistrict. And we remained within those two factories and those two factories were the last\nremnant because some -- some of the other possessions that we had had, because of the -- the --\nthe Great Depression. We lost part of that because of the Great Depression, including\nparticipation a particular [indecipherable] if I remember, 1n Tameshwar. I think I even have a\nphoto of something that looks like a [indecipherable] building. And so we were hanging onto\nthose -- hanging onto those two factories, but --",
        "Q: And what -- what -- what did those factories produce?",
        "A: They were -- one produced textiles and the other one producing valves and -- what do you\nattach valves to? Cylinders.",
        "Q: Cylinders.",
        "A: Valves and cylinders.",
        "Q: So there\u2019s a vast network of --",
        "A: It was a nast vetwork",
        "Q: -- [indecipherable] family --",
        "A: -- of the capitalistic investment viable during the course of the Austro-Hungarian empire,\nbecause it was a solidly established 32 million dollar -- 32 million peoples\u2019 market. And with the\ndisintegration of all that, the market potential had disappeared. The Serbs would never trade with\nthe Hungarians. Through Romanians nobody would trade because they never pay. The Austrians\nhad no money left, so the whole system gradually disintegrated.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Like you\u2019re hanging on your good -- then you could declare bankruptcy. All I\n[indecipherable] personally, what I saved from that is knowing how to ride a horse, even had my\nown horse for awhile, and memories of what a great life it would have been if it hadn\u2019t been for\nthat stupid Hitler.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Because we had -- we had -- you know, in choosing where to live, you recognize that people\nare people are people, and that people, being individualistic, have a right in their own\nnationhood. And one who believes that [indecipherable] if they believe they\u2019re distinct enough\nand if they believe that they can maintain themselves without leeching off other countries,\nneighboring countries, then they rightly hold -- need a nationhood.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Right? But in my father\u2019s eyes, it was the empire or nothing.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Right? He never had any chance of any promotions anywhere, right? And I think he left this\nwhole area as a refugee because A, the commies would have gotten him, they\u2019d have\n[indecipherable] right? He had a gran -- he had a mother who was a very distinguished lady of\nsociety, and she\u2019s -- he just couldn\u2019t st-stand the risk of Tito Hungarian communism getting hold\nof my grandmother.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know? So he escaped to Austria and --",
        "Q: With her?",
        "A: -- and [indecipherable] toward the end of the war, and then eventually [indecipherable] he met\nthat German, fine looking. I think sh -- one -- she\u2019s one of the few good Germans\n[indecipherable] she -- met her, fell in love with her, had his mother with him all the time. Had\nenough means to establish himself. And because of his languages and the legal training, he\neventually won a post with the German federal government. Now, I resented that very much.\nActually, if you want to know something really specific, my father was a -- a German speaking\nAustrian, speaking German like an Austrian, just like me. But he has already established\ncredentials at a time when West Germany needed men who would go through these\nDenazification rituals -- I call them rituals on purpose because some people thought that it was\nfoolish because they let the big Nazis go and ritualize the little Nazis had never done anything to\nanybody. And my father was, for awhile, I think 12 months in the area of Bavaria, a\nDenazification judge.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Now was it that because he was known to become -- been an anti-communist all his life and\nby 1947 the Cold War had broken out? Or was it because of his special legal knowledge, or was\nit because of his languages?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But one way or the other he was the -- he was the -- the [indecipherable] local for\nDenazification president and he was doing that for 11 months. And I -- I had difficulties with that\nbecause he was not a German. And difficulties with the notion of his living in Germany. Why\nwouldn\u2019t he have stayed in Austria? And he said to me -- we talked about it several times after I\nfound him, you see, because don\u2019t forget I was prisoner of war for a year.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: British prisoner of war. So eventually I -- after they let me go in August 1946, so I was\nputting in a lot of to finally -- finally I discovered he was in [indecipherable] why do you have to\ngo to Germany? And he said, because I love her. I said, don\u2019t you forget everything else? Don\u2019t\nyou forget what has happened? He says, in Austria communists lived -- the communists were\nright in Vienna and I\u2019m -- I was afraid. They almost killed me once, I wanted to be safe enough,\nand well, Germany was safe enough. So I visited him three times in the course of 30 years.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I had my personal reasons for not feeling home [indecipherable]. She was a great lady,\nEdith, but my father and I didn\u2019t -- you bu -- beautifully put -- said question, my father and I\nwere very close. Spiritual very close, mentally very sharp, very close, sportsmanlike very close.\nAnd we were kind of principled. My brother was more a merchant [indecipherable] but live and\nlet live. And we went -- we went apart because of that. And he also told me -- I told him, look,\nI\u2019ve had enough of this [speaks Hungarian] in Hungarian. [Hungarian] means real pig\n[indecipherable] I\u2019m going to go to Canada. Adalbert, you are the only one I have.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Now it\u2019s you who is number one. I said, so what, because my broth -- well, your brother is\ndead. So I said, what do I do with that, \u2019m number one, we have nothing left. He says, oh yeah,\nyou have pride left, you have family tradition left and you will do what I want you to do. So I\nsaid, what do you want me to do? You stay in Germany, and go to university in Germany and try\nto become a diplomat. Me? A diplomat in the German -- no. I said, Dad, no. I prefer anything to\nthat. His eyes popped out and said [indecipherable] you want to emigrate? You lose your\ncivilization if you go to America. I says, oh really? Six months later I was [indecipherable] and\nhe never talked to me again for five years.",
        "Q: Wow. We have to change the tape.",
        "A: Very --\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Let me go -- let me go back --",
        "A: So I told you about my brother and h-he loved that Jewish girl.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And yeah, well, they forgot to mention. So the Germans, as I said, just to update that\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- April 1941, the Nazis came in, took possession of the Barnot, gave Barcika and Barnya\nback to the Hungarians. The bridges were already built for the Hungarians, then we had to come\nin the Barnot, we were living in Montbachkirche, and we were all waiting and I was already\nanticipating going to Budapest to study, because I finished my -- was about finishing my high\nschool, very well finishing my high school. And suddenly the bridges were torn off and the\nGermans said, we will remain occupiers of the Barnot for the time being. And that\u2019s how that\n[indecipherable] division was created out of this -- that peasant [indecipherable] w-we were\ncalled [indecipherable] all of a sudden. And within six months, the Jewish people disappeared.",
        "Q: From Barnot?",
        "A: Yeah, and from the world, yeah. And including the little raven, shiny haired beauty that my\nbr-brother was so terribly in love. How can I say terribly in love, delightfully love in with. And\nupon inquiring, my father told me that he had learned from the Germans that they were picked up\nfor their better safekeeping. Put up in some brick factories, usually. The main brick factory was\nin Poncho, which was Ponchoway in Hungarian, just off the -- off the Danube river, on the --\nnorth of the Danube river, from whence they suddenly disappeared around September, October\n1941. And we never heard of the [indecipherable] again. But we had not heard anything,\nshooting or gassing or anything, they were just gone, you see. [indecipherable] was the first case\nof a massive enleve mon, in French. Enleve mon means the picking up en masse and they\ntransport them, carting them away [indecipherable]. But not the Jews were first ones to have\nbeen -- how do I know that? My father had, wherever -- whenever he was in Bachkirche, he had\na card round. Every Tuesday night they were playing cards, one of the four guys, four guys,\neverything. They were drinking, they were smoking, they were banging the table like the way\nmen were supposed to do to [indecipherable]. One of them was a mathematics teacher by name\nof -- by nam-ame-ame -- by the name of Frankel, he was a Jewish guy. And he always managed\nwinning. It made my father very angry. But they kept on playing for years. Now how do I know\nthat? I was the one serving them the wine.",
        "Q: I see, right. And he used to take it --",
        "A: And then Frank -- Frank was a great math teacher, was my math teacher. He had the ge --\nbuilt me -- geometric models from potatoes. He brought in a potato, cut off it\u2019s last thi -- see, you\nsee what an arc 1s? You see -- you see, you can measure that along -- he loved it. He in my mind\nwas a very influential creator of curiosity.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He was [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So why don\u2019t you -- when you -- let\u2019s go back to when you were a kid.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What did you like in school? You liked mathematics.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Ping pong and chess have nothing to do with each other. I love -- my father introduced me\ninto -- you know how I survived the war? I knew how to take care of my body.",
        "Q: You knew how to take care of your body?",
        "A: Yes. You want to have a confession? Never engaged in any se -- any sexual relation until I\nwas 22 and a half. Why?",
        "Q: And you think that helped, why?",
        "A: Why? Because so many guys in the war decimated, they were pulled back from the front, the\nfirst thing they did, half dead, pulled back from the front, went to the whorehouses. So they were\nalways caught in between having [indecipherable] because the food was also terrible. And yet\nthey lined themselves up. For miles they were lined up for a whorehouse of five or six or seven\nwomen, right? Horrendous experience. When I saw this at ma -- I won\u2019t have to do anything\nwith that. And then I met my -- my potential first wife, for whom I saved myself, and who had\nsaved myself unknowing for me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we got married to each other in Vienna, right, in 1948.",
        "Q: 1948?",
        "A: Totally innocent.",

        "A: She was German speaking.",
        "Q: She was German speaking?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right. Her grandmother was Hungarian.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But her father was German Volksdeutsche, yeah. And I married her in Vienna. And -- and I\nmust also say she was blonde, blue eyed, which is curious for me because when I was destined or\nselected to go on officer\u2019s training in the Waffen SS, there still was a requisite that to be a real\nWaffen SS officer you had to be blonde, blue eyed.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And [indecipherable] 80, and all those things. And I was just the opposite of that, looking like\na Gypsy amongst all those blondes. And I had to go to a special commission, a racial\ninvestigation commission. [indecipherable]. And they looked at me and said, you don\u2019t qualify,\njust the color of your hair, the color of your eyes. And th-the other said, but we need young man\nwho knows ports and have been in the war [indecipherable] anything? So they checked my --\nthey checked my protruding brain, oh good brain capacity.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Why would Adolf worry about good brain ca -- brain capacity [indecipherable] good,\nimpressive brain capacity, fine bone structure. Too French, but with a bit of training, the bones\nwill be okay. Fine muscle structure, but his outside looks have to be improved upon. So they\npassed me with the condition that within three or four years I\u2019d have to marry a light blonde\nGerman.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: With whom I would have to procreate four children, watch this one, one of whom would be\npurely blonde, an improvement of the race. Another one would be half blonde, also an\nimprovement, but two would remain hopeless, they said. Hopelessly non-German looking.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] non-German looking, right.",
        "A: And it was th -- several times in my life in those -- those terrible three years in which I was\nreally feeling abused and angry, as I said, who are they to tell me what kind of woman I should\nmarry? I mean it -- you know, this was really trespassing upon my personal is -- guess what? I\nwas released from POW camp, made it to Vienna as fast as possible to go back to school, right,\nat the university because I\u2019d had my gymnasium, right? And who do I see at the -- round street\ncorner just marching away, a little blonde kid with her mother. And I look in the [indecipherable]\nwent around the corner, never had a [indecipherable]. Something compelled me to trace myself\nback [indecipherable] and that was that little blonde blue-eyed kid.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: My two children are blonde blue eyed.",
        "Q: Blonde and blue eyed.",
        "A: My looks have improved.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But, by my voluntary choice, that\u2019s different.",
        "Q: That\u2019s different. When you were raised, were you raised as a Catholic or Protestant?",
        "A: I was raised by my grandmother going to Catholic church, but on Protestant principles. She\nsaid, we have to go to church, there is no Protestant church in the area, but we pray to the\nProtestant God [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Was that confusing to you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: You knew exactly what it meant?",
        "A: -- no, to me -- to me -- you could -- what appealed to me, you could stand up tall and raise\nyour eyes to the heavens and talk to your God, hoping to talk to -- directly by talk to. To me the\npope was not essential.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: To me -- because I had to learn the little catechism, you know the catechism? Catechism was\nwhat the pope wanted us to believe, not letting us be free to choose what we wanted to believe.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So I had no use for the catechism.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: And between the two of us, I\u2019m very critical of the 10 commandments, that they were -- the\nway they were spelled out.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But we have a personal responsibility to God, but it also gives us the right and the\n[indecipherable] to ask, God, where are you?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t talk to me. So --",
        "Q: So, did you ti --",
        "A: -- don\u2019t ask me questions about religion, I\u2019m -- at the present time --",
        "Q: But when you were raised as a kid --",
        "A: Re -- organized religion is an organized attack by the ones who know how to use people, to\nbrainwash people --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- for self profiteering purposes. It\u2019s a dismal use, dismal you -- it\u2019s not right.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t have this --",
        "A: And what was happening with Catholic clergy is just atrocious [indecipherable]",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t feel this as a kid.",
        "A: No, as a -- as akid I was -- I was happy to stand tall.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because my -- my grandmother was an individualist.",
        "Q: So did you -- did your grandmother sort of take over --",
        "A: She had -- yeah -- yeah --",
        "Q: -- partly raising you after your mother passed?",
        "A: -- and after my mom died, my grandmother was the ruling influence in our lives, but too\nmuch emphasis on discipline --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- too much emphasis on tradition, but great emphasis on respect for ladies.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Obviously ladies --",
        "Q: Was this your mother\u2019s mother, or your father\u2019s mother?",
        "A: My father\u2019s.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Oh yeah, she was a lady of stature.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: As my grandfather wouldn\u2019t have married her, you see.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She says [indecipherable] Baylor, you have to make sure to learn how to distinguish between\na lady and just an ordinary woman. Trouble is, in Vienna, the ladies were in the [indecipherable]\ndistrict, the ordinary women were in the second district.",
        "Q: See, that\u2019s the only way you --",
        "A: And she said, eventually she said, there is nothing wrong learning how to -- going to the girls\nin the second district.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I never did.",
        "Q: Right. You never did --",
        "A: But she would -- and my grandmother hired two professional educators. I was six years old,\nmy brother was nine years old, that we had had for about seven years each. One of them was six\nfoot something, big moustache, legs like that and she didn't like my jumpy attitude. I was a fast\nlearner, I wanted to learn fast, to play games fast, and eventually it was so bad she couldn\u2019t corre\n-- she tied my legs to the chair [indecipherable] onto the chair, said you will now sit for an hour\nbecause I want you to sit for an hour and do exactly what I want you, I said, but I\u2019ve already\nfinished. That\u2019s not the is-issue. You have to follow me, you have to -- I am the one to educate\nyou, to bring you up, therefore, you have to learn discipline. Oh, I hated her. And then -- but -- at\nnight she said, never go out in the dark, because there\u2019s a guy waiting for you with the knife. She\nwas terrified of the dark. Eventually my father let her go. The other woman was okay.",
        "Q: So does this mean you --",
        "A: The other woman was a loving girl, a loving woman by the name of Anna Fayis, also\ncomplete -- very Hungarian. She really made a Hungarian out of [indecipherable]. She was from\n-- she was also from Szeged, right. Blonde woman, she was an educator, very tough but very fair,\nand very decent. She didn't mistreat us. But she was almost like a mother substitute, except my\nfather was loafing around, so she could kind of not handle my father, you see [indecipherable].\nBut she was a very strong influence and she survived the war and went back to Hungary and I\ncorresponded with her until 1963, when she died.",
        "Q: So did this --",
        "A: And from her -- her, I was able to retrieve some of those photographs there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Because she had somehow managed to save some of the things that the commies had taken\nout.",
        "Q: Some of the photographs, right. So did this mean you didn\u2019t go to school?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: Thi -- thi -- did this mean you didn\u2019t go to school, that you were home --",

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- from a Hungarian secondary school, which was a good enough school to give me\nimmediate admission to the university in Budapest --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- which was the most famous university, [indecipherable] university in Prague, and the\nVienna University in Austria.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And eventually, after I was released from prisoner of war, I went to Vienna with that\ncertificate, I was admitted immediately to the --",
        "Q: To that school, right.",
        "A: -- university to study, guess what, law. I always told my father, I don\u2019t want to study law, I\ndon\u2019t want to study law, I don\u2019t want to study diplomacy, I want to study [indecipherable]\npolitical science. He said, you will study law [indecipherable]. So eventually I took --",

        "A: Oh, I love -- I loved studying because, first of all, my brain was very flexible. I don\u2019t know\nwhether it\u2019s that French stimulus or a Hungarian -- it\u2019s a -- some kind of a mix of the French and\nthe Hungarian that keeps you jumping all the time.

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Now, what I know is what nobody else knows. You know why I always keep on jumping?\nWhen the Germans marched into Austria -- Austria was a leisurely people. On the whole most of\nthem are good-willed people, they\u2019re a lot of fun, kind of like the French 1s and the -- the Italian.\nSo they went Nazi for awhile because they needed jobs and maybe because of Hitler and all that,\nbut on the whole they are a more leisurely people than the ever -- the Germans would ever hope\nto be. The Germans quickly built [indecipherable] and mortars into the behinds of every one of\nus, right, to make us move like the Germans. I think they forgot to take one out. Keeps on\nmaking me jumpy. But I was a good student and a very -- I loved the Latin. At that time they still\nhad six years of Latin, four years of Greek, and I loved the -- the -- the classicists. Greek\nmythology has great significant in my life. I really believe in Venus. I also believe in Pallas\nAthena because to me the ideal lady is a combination of Venus and Pallas Athena, you see.\nBrain-wise and otherwise. And also loved games, so in order to be able to do everything within\nthe constraints of a disciplinary upbringing, I had to be fast in learning to get away from those\nropes.",

My father\ntaught me how to play chess. After two years he stopped, he said, I can\u2019t stand it any more, you\nkeep on winning all the time. Very [indecipherable]. So I was a fast learner and with the\nlanguages, you grew up with the Hungarian and with the Slavic, and with the Romanian and with\nthe German and with the -- whatever French there had been in the family still [indecipherable]\nmy -- my grandmother, father\u2019s mother always called an umbrella a parapree. A strange term in\nAustria, right? But that\u2019s the way it was, so I wer -- grew up with five languages and I still\ncommanding -- have added to that English and some Russian because when I was at Columbia\nUniversity I was taken up into a special program in which my capacities, like music capacities,\nwill be brought to full bloom by [indecipherable] and they -- they were going to employ me by\nthe Rand Corporation to become a -- some kind of a spy about eastern Europe, understandably\nso.

        "Q: -- you\u2019re right. So you --",
        "A: I -- I loved studying. But back home the limits of studying was within the context of your\nsocioeconomic structure. You needed to know how to understand that, but don\u2019t worry about\nthings outside of that. It was not universal education. It was parochial [indecipherable] empire in\nU.S. education. The Kaiser is on the top and you always have to bow to them. Somewhere along\nthe line I dropped that. Why do I have to bow to a Kaiser if I don\u2019t have to bow if I want talk to\nGod? And Canada and Magill broadened my attitude to become a Universalist attitude, the\nessential foundation being peace among humans.",
        "Q: Right.",

But amongst the\nmasses, especially in the east, the most part there was there the [indecipherable] there was\nalways greater anti-Semitism.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The Hungarian peasantry was very anti-Semitic. That\u2019s an issue that hasn\u2019t been fully\nexplored yet. The Jewish people, the Jewish potentates, I call them potentates in Hungary, right,\nthey were not enemies of Hungarian ordinary peasants, because the peasants were living in a\nfeudal system. The big enemies of Hungarian peasants were the Hungarian aristocrats. The\nHungarian aristocrats were explicitly anti-Semitic, unlike the Viennese aristocracy.",
        "Q: Yes --",
        "A: You see, by then, any feudal system, remember, five, 600 years ago had its basic principles\nresting on the Jews killed Jesus, therefore we have to exterminate the Jews and we have to keep\nthem in place. We have to let them prosper then we\u2019ll rob them blind. So a necessary evil, it has\nto be fully controlled. That is a feudal system. With the enlightenment period, this emphasis on\nthe Jews killed Jesus, therefore we have to kill the Jews has disappeared [indecipherable] in\nparticular in Italy, and of course, particularly amongst the more educated classes of the German\nspeaking Protestants, right? But the Catholics were hanging onto that well until [indecipherable],\nit\u2019s the truth, you see, so you\u2019re raised in a situation like that, you see Frankel, the mathematic\nteacher playing a -- pleasurably yelling as much and drinking as much, and I-I knew he was\nJewish, but he was member of a group, of an in-group of the higher bourgeoisie, and behaving\nlike it too. Like the guys had all the rights, the guys have all the powers. They could misbehave,\nthey can be drunk, right?

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Bringing her up in the -- spoke only -- he was Prussian German. As Prussian German as any\nPrussian German would want to be, brought up his daughter in America speaking the Prussian\nGerman accent. I met her when I was at Columbia University and living in International House,\nshe was a frequent visitor because she had a guy there that she knew, was -- she was musically\ninclined.

        "A: You should allow some specific black men to have the specialized training to make use of\ntheir natural talents. And that was kind of almost like a renaissance type of belief, you know.",
        "Q: And did you ha --",
        "A: If you have the talent, you\u2019re worthwhile being developed.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: All systems would have that. The East Germans made use of that premise too, but -- so we\nloved Jesse Owens. We had no feeling for the German athletes, but we necessarily rooted for the\nHungarian. And would you believe it? A nation of 10 million had -- were third best amongst the\ngold medal winners?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They were our national heroes.",
        "Q: So what did -- what did you think of the fact that Hitler didn\u2019t pin the medal on Jesse Owens?",
        "A: Oh, he didn\u2019t [indecipherable]. Hitler was to me an alien figure.",
        "Q: He was an alien figure.",
        "A: You know, I remember my dad was rooting like crazy, yelling like -- my dad was a very\n[indecipherable] civil gentleman, he -- he got carried away when the Hungarians were winning\nthe gold medals. He said absolutely nothing when the Germans were winning their medals, and I\nthink the Germans came first best there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: First best, they had the largest number of medals, but [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And what were you hearing about Hitler from your father and from other people?",
        "A: Oh, th-the fi -- the film -- I think I saw the film a year later and for what I\u2019ve seen through it,\nand it may influence my reasoning, it was one of the most creative films ever as a documentary,\nbringing you all kinds of new nuances of moviemaking, including attempts at early\n[indecipherable] things like that. And the glorification scenes of the flags and all that. There\u2019s a\nlot of glorification of flags in the United States today, so maybe the Americans learned from her,\nright, how to do all those things.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about Leni Riefen --",
        "A: But the -- the politics of it -- the politics of it remain hidden in the background, you know\nwhy? Because Berlin was selected unanimously to become the site of the 1936 Olympics.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And all the democratic nations, having underwritten that, my family had no reason to\nquestion.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It was 1936. Hitler had already shown his muscle. The Zargebeit have got back, the\n[indecipherable] have gotten back. He -- the Austrian [indecipherable] is already working on,\nright? And there were all kinds of Nazi things, plots all over the world, right, even United States\n[indecipherable] starting to show its ugly head, right? So we had all the major -- there were\n[indecipherable] countries approving of that. You would say, well, things are normal. Hitler\nseems to be accepted, it\u2019s a sporting event --",
        "Q: So that --",
        "A: -- maybe just like the one now in China, right?",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: And if it\u2019s a sporting event, whatever excesses there may have been against the Jewish\npopulation, right, the Kristallnacht in 1934, that would have been a singular bad experience in\nhistory, but it will never reoccur.

        "Q: Kris-Kristallnacht --",
        "A: -- pulled the rug under any of the other [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- right, Kristallnacht doesn\u2019t occur until \u201938.",
        "A: It\u2019s in 1938, I was 11 years old.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: You see, and th-the movie, I remember the movie, it really glorified, I thought as a kid, the\nexceptional human contents of exceptionally gifted athletes, and kind of an ideal to which you\nwould aspire.",

        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Now, if we had been told then, warned then, that is actually a Riefenstahl type of propaganda\non behalf of Nazis --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- \u2019'd have had, maybe, as a fairly creative thinking 11 year old, a second thought. I never\ndiscovered behind that -- beyond -- behind that, the intent.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Now, was it an attempt to -- by Hitler, through Riefenstahl to blind everybody? Was she an\ninstrument of Nazi political power manipulation? Well, she was then about -- about 25 -- 28\nyears old, or something like that.

        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Now, would I have loved that because I had dark hair and brown eyes, and winning the --\nwinning the [indecipherable] championship in world Ping Pong, not because I was dark haired,\nbut because I would have been best at it.",

        "A: And that\u2019s exactly the point.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Wanting to be best at something has nothing to do with race or creed. You have the talent,\ndevelop it, but 1t doesn\u2019t make you better than anybody else.",

        "A: Oh, I\u2019d have loved to have been part of that movie, why not, glorifying sport.",
        "Q: Of that movie.",
        "A: You were in -- you\u2019re in -- you\u2019re -- as long as you\u2019re engaged in sport, right?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You cannot -- you\u2019re not supposed to -- not engage in sex at the same time, right? Nor are you\nengaged in racism.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But clearly there was a racist element in that.",
        "A: Oh, but surely it was, on hindsight.",
        "Q: Yeah, right. But -- but that\u2019s not what you noticed then.",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t notice that, I was just carried away with the Hungarians having an incredible\nperformance.",
        "Q: But you saw something about Jesse Owens, you and your friends. You saw that -- that Hitler\nwould not put on -- give him the medal, cause he was so angry that --",
        "A: Well, at the -- the -- please don\u2019t forget, at the level of 11 year olds, the German yo-youth\nwere already in the Hitler youth.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We were boy scouts.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: In Hungary there were boy scouts, there were no Hitler youth. Actually, in Hungary there\nnever were any Hitler youth. In the Banar there were Volksdeutsche Hitler youths equivalent, but\nthat\u2019s a very -- way secondary, lower com -- con-consideration. So if you\u2019re a boy scout, you\u2019re\na Universalist, you kind of look at the Hitler youth we knew, but there were no movies about the\nHitler youth. You\u2019ll notice all placards, you received placards [indecipherable] say, well they are\ndoing the same, they said they all look so blonde. Why do they all look so blonde? But they\ndidn\u2019t go beyond that. We were Hungarians on the -- of all kinds of mixed. You have light\nblondes, dark blondes, you have Slavic looking types, you have Gypsy looking types, all kinds of\n[indecipherable |",

        "A: Took Austria.",
        "Q: -- in Austria.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Wh-What do you think?",
        "A: It had no import on us --",
        "Q: No import.",
        "A: -- except my -- my grandmother was saying oh, now business will become a bit better.",
        "Q: Will become better?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, when Hitler invaded Austria, I [indecipherable] in the world invaded\nconsciously, not liberated okay, it\u2019s a big difference.",
        "Q: Ri-Right.",
        "A: An German -- Austrian German would say liberated. [indecipherable] invaded Austria,\noccupied Austria --",
        "Q: But there was no war.",
        "A: -- our business was improving, because --",
        "Q: But there was no war.",
        "A: There was no war, right, but there was massive unemployment. And Austria had needed\naccess to the German market --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- who were fully employed under the auspices of the state. Exports, subsidies, you name it,\nHitler had that. Chalke had worked on the policies magnificently. All of a sudden Germans are\ngetting money and gold from all over the place, but they weren't satisfied, right? And part of that\nover-spilled into Austria, part of that into the agricultural economies, because the agriculture\neconomy needed machinery. In exchange for the machinery, they delivered to the Germans\n[indecipherable] for butter and whipping cream. I remember after the Germans came into\nVienna, six weeks after there was no whipping cream left in Vienna, which was a major\ncatastrophe, don\u2019t laugh at me. The Germans took it all. But they paid for in cash.",
        "Q: So what happens to the Jews in Austria --",
        "A: So business improved.",
        "Q: Do you know th -- do you know about that?",
        "A: The what?",
        "Q: What -- what happened -- do you -- do you hear, as a ki -- you\u2019re what, 14 years old?",
        "A: No, that was 1938? I was 13 years old.",
        "Q: 13 years.",
        "A: Almost 14, yeah.",
        "Q: 14. Do you hear about what happens to the Jews when it -- when the Germans --",
        "A: Oh no, there was -- well, in Austria -- I was not in Vienna itself in 1938, but there was a\ndisquiet. Mr. Frank expressed -- sometimes he came with very sad face to his -- to card games\nwith my dad.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And it lasted for about two years, and then it suddenly just gone, I\u2019ve t -- ve told you that.",
        "Q: Right, he was disappearing.",
        "A: But we heard from friend in Vienna that the Jewish people had disappeared in the course of\nJune, July 1938, literally overnight. And all those ghastly scenes about the broomsticks, you\nknow, having to clean the streets --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you know, wash the roads [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- underneath, that those excesses had happened, but the observation there is that sa -- I\nremember some of the Austria monarchists saying quite critically, if the allies hadn\u2019t destroyed\nAustria-Hungary, the Jewish pogroms would never have happened.",
        "Q: Well, how about --",
        "A: -- because the Jewish population was at peace during the r-reign of Joseph -- Franz Joseph the\nsecond, was at peace with the community at large.",
        "Q: But ha -- that\u2019s --",
        "A: -- and were fully [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- how was that an --",
        "A: -- that, but only at the level of the higher bourgeoisie. So they were in Hungary, even though\nless so, because the Hungarian aristocracy was very opposed to the Jewish rising influence in\nfinancial services especially, right. But with the disintegration of the empire, right, somebody\nwas made the scapegoat, and Hitler succeeded, I think -- I\u2019m just jumping here -- succeeded in\nconvincing the only Austrian working class person without a job that Hitler\u2019s proposition that the\nGerman Jews has benefited from the first World War equally applied in Austria.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Namely that there was Austrian Jewish person who had benefited from the first World War.\nBut that 1s absolute nonsense, because with Austria-Hungary being destroyed, everybody lost.\nBut Hitler and the Nazis in Austria were able to exploit that. And as you would expect,\nmanipulating those uneducated brains into ou-outbur -- outbursts of hatred, led to the scenes of\nthe Austrian mob forcing -- with the policemen just looking on, right, forcing the Jewish persons,\nincluding the highly intelligentsia Jewish person, including the very skilled doctor, and\n[indecipherable] to kneel on the streets and clean on the streets in Austria.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And then there were no hue and cry. By the time there was no hue and cry when the Jews\nsuddenly disappeared because anti-Semitism, latent amongst the peoples, masses at large, was\nbrought on very forcefully by Hitler\u2019s own presence.",
        "Q: And is your father surprised at what happens?",
        "A: My father was lucky. My father was -- he was, I think -- how should I answer that? Frank was\na very good friend of his. I remember there was a Jewish dentist [indecipherable] Beshker, who\nwas a very good friend of his. My father said previous, as I mentioned to you, that Hitler would\nbe -- would be a good means to keep communism at bay and help us save our properties. But\nthen with respect to the Jews, I think he was contented to know -- too contented to really believe\nthat when the Jews of the Banar disappeared, that what the Germans had claiming, including the\nVolksdeutsche German representative, that they were being rounded up for their own\nsafekeeping, that\u2019s where it stopped.",
        "Q: And w-what if --",
        "A: I think he fell into that trap, if we --",
        "Q: Did you -- did you fall into it as well, given that he said that to you, that you thought, well --",
        "A: Well, I -- I b -- I -- I believe -- I -- I still feel aggrieved about what happened to that little\nJewish girl that my brother was in love with. And I re -- I ca -- I saw my brother crying many,\nmany, many times, and I never saw him smiling ever again. But I thought that was a singular\ncase of a boy loving a girl, without referring to the girl being a Jewish girl. So --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And di -- so, did you talk with your broth --",
        "A: So I was -- I was -- well, let\u2019s see now, this would have been 1941, in June \u201941 I was 16 years\nold. We had -- I had no Jewish guys actually at all in the Hungarian school, but we couldn\u2019t have\nhad that because they had disappeared in the summer of 1941.",
        "Q: Right. So did that --",
        "A: No, let me just see --",
        "Q: -- was that shocking to you, that these, all of these people just were -- disappeared? Or not?",
        "A: Shocking? Well, absolu -- I\u2019d have to go back in my memory cells.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: What -- what about that disturbed me -- well, also kind of made me feel neutral? I think I -- I\nmust have kind of felt well, that\u2019s the way things are these days.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: If they say -- and we knew that the superior force had come in, if that is the way things are\nhappening, that is part the way -- ay -- oh, you, I have the answer. I was much more concerned\nabout the Germans, the Nazi Germans coming 1n and hanging hundreds of Serbs accused of\nbeing communists, all over the main market squares in Montbachkirche, in Boch, in -- there are\nthree major cities in the Banar. Montbachkirche, Notchkinken and Ponchua, right?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They were hanging hundreds of Serbs, rounding up in the streets, without any cause\nwhatsoever, and let them hang there for days, with placards saying this is how people will end\ntheir lives if they raise their fists, or whatever, do something against the occupational force of the\nGermans. I was so perturbed about that, visibly in front of our eyes, that the disappearance of the\nJewish people was not really knowing where they\u2019re gone to.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t see it, you couldn\u2019t see it.",
        "A: There was no rumors about their [indecipherable]",

        "A: There was no knowledge of concentration camp.",
        "Q: There wasn\u2019t?",
        "A: I think the much greater evil was the hanging of all these Serbs --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- because they were left hanging there.",
        "Q: So there are no rumors about concentration camps in Germany?",
        "A: There were nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "A: Nothing at all. Nothing at all. Only noise -- [indecipherable] got to mean something very bad\neventually, after the fact. Namely, the [indecipherable] kills.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They were rounded up, as I mentioned to you already in Montbachkirche, Libriken and in\nPonchua. So somehow they got over the [indecipherable] linked with the idea of -- that\u2019s from\nwhere they were eventually disappeared, and nobody knows where.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But there was no talk at all about concentration camps. Don\u2019t forget, the only concentration\ncamp existing, the earliest one was Dachau 1936, and Dachau was not for Jewish people. The\nJewish camps, I think, were being opened up -- Flossenbirg 1939.",
        "Q: Well, there are -- there are Jews who go, but those are not the first Jews --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- in \u00b033.",

        "Q: Were much -- there later. Right, right.",
        "A: -- were only 1941 - \u201942 - \u00b043.",
        "Q: But the -- the -- the general concentration camp system, which is huge in Germany by the\ntime \u201939 comes, and 1940 comes --",
        "A: Yeah, but it was -- that was --",
        "Q: Do you hear about that?",
        "A: It was -- it -- 1t goes back to that but th-the -- the -- f-from what I\u2019ve read since then including\nCharter\u2019s book on Hitler and all that, the -- the main intention of the early concentration camps 1s\nto make it a point to which to -- into -- which to enclose completely, the enemies of the state\npolitical. Communists, reactionaries, anti-Nazis, generally speaking. And eventually the\nunterklass, namely the Gypsies, in that order, and only eventually the Jewish people, in camps of\ntheir own.",
        "Q: But what do you hear w -- that\u2019s what you read later, but what do you --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- hear when you\u2019re growing up, about those camps, anything?",
        "A: No, I --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t hear anything.",
        "A: -- knew nothing about it at all.",
        "Q: Nothing.",
        "A: No difference. Absolutely nothing. Actually, I was -- I was drafted in 17 -- in -- in June --\nJune 1*', 1942. I was in the Balkans, in the Prinz Eugen division all this time, until September\n1944. In September 194 -- the Soviets broke through Romania into Serbia and their -- our\ndivision was massacred, being put up against the [indecipherable] 90 percent of the personnel we\nlost fighting the Soviets. In that time being in Yugoslavia, I knew nothing, I\u2019d seen nothing about\nconcentration camps. The first concentration camp I did see is on my way to the officers\u2019 school.\nWe were supposed to be -- this was early in January 1945 -- supposed to be in Nuremburg.\nNuremburg was bombed the hell out of on the 11\" and 12\" of January, so we were rerouted\ntowards the end of January to Leitmeritz. And on the way to Leitmeritz in the Czech repu --\nnorthwestern Czech Republic, we are -- there was only one road leading to Leitmeritz, and on the\nright hand side the road was Theresienstadt. And remember sitting in the lorries, about 10 - 20 of\nus in the lorry, and we were told at a certain moment on the road, now you must look to the left,\nyou\u2019re not allowed to look to the right. And army being the army, we looked to the left, but some\nof them, why don\u2019t we look to the left? Because there are Jewish people there, not supposed to --\nyou are not allowed to look at them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "A: And that\u2019s when this notion of Jewish people, huh, concentration camp came up in the mind.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Right? And then we talked to each other and some of them who had been in the Soviet Union\non the eastern front for several years had come across concentration camp in eastern Europe, in\nPoland, right? And that day they interconnected as ah-ha, this must be a concentration camp.\nOnly eventually did we learn that it was Theresienstadt.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But Theresienstadt was a, quote unquote, model concentration camp, to which the Red Cross\ndignitaries were invited, showing them off, even Jewish plays, Jewish theater, Jewish opera,\nJewish musicians and things like that. Nobody talked of the [indecipherable] of the small\nfortress, which was the extermination part of Theresienstadt.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And a real Austro-Hungarian would never want any part of Germany, because that\u2019s the way\nhistory was. Either you\u2019re a German -- an Austrian Imperialist, or a German Imperialist, and you\nwill never forget that Bismarck, upon being asked personally by the Kaiser representative in\n1898 if he would concern that Austro-Hungary join Germany, the new Reich in an economic\nunion, said Austro-Hungary will never qualify for a deve -- for an economic union because they\nare an underdeveloped, backward country. A real Austro-Hungarian would never forgive the\nGermans for that. And my father never did. At the same time he said, well, Hitler is Austrian.\nWhy don\u2019t you look at it from the point of view of Austria bringing Germany into the fold?\nRidiculous.",

        "A: How can a little country absorb a huge country and not grow ill over that, right? So ina\ncertain sense my father\u2019s attitude as a Royalist, in my eyes, was compromised. I didn\u2019t know\nhow to explain it then, but I see it today. But at the base of that was my father\u2019s hatred of\nBolshevism, because don\u2019t forget, in the -- in the si -- the trigger for my dad actually was\nreawakening him to the threat of Bolshevism in the -- the civil war in Spain. There is official\nknowledge that they burned about 300 churches, the communists, three major cathedrals,\nviolated at least 10,000 nuns and killed 5,000 priests and bishops. Now, we had no use for\nCatholicism, but as a Christian you would say, if communists can do that in that country, they\u2019re\na threat for all of European civilization, because Spain was part and parcel of western\ncivilization, for the better, worse, the everything, in spite of the horrible things they did in South\nAmerica.",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to have --",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Yes, I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re going to stop.",
        "A: Very, very important.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: You know, you might be asking this question, how about the economics of Hitler? How many\npeople got to support Hitler amongst the previous so-called high bourgeois circles? Because he\nwas jobs, he was economics, he was foreign currency and he was international power. Most of\nthem did.",
        "Q: Y-You rolling? Okay.",
        "A: So what place did greed play?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know, does -- does -- did it play a lot? Did you see it?",
        "A: Well, I just tell you that, sure. From the Hitlerian policies of full employment, everybody who\nhad suffered from [indecipherable] unemployment would benefit.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So the job creation prevailed over -- from the mental principles of morality. Never look\nbeyond the day after tomorrow. Everybody was cashing in, especially on foreign exchange. Even\nthe Jewish people --",
        "Q: But now -- now --",
        "A: -- early in the Hitler regime were cashing 1n on foreign exchange.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And Hitler forbade them to exchange in foreign exchange dealings, right? Cause he wanted\nthe so-called pure Germans to have full control over foreign exchange [indecipherable |\nsupporting the national interest because the Jewish people would then take the foreign exchange\nand then deposit it abroad, right? So the first distinction, actually racial discrimination, actually\n[indecipherable] openly professed that against the Jews, was [indecipherable] recognition, that\nthe money, foreign exchange, has to be kept at home, and those who sabotage that had to be\nimprisoned or even hanged. So Kristallnacht was just a small example of what was really\nhappening in the background, and that has never been researched. And eventually the Jewish\npeople fell into step, you see? They had to give up their own disposition of foreign exchanges,\nthey had to report like everybody else, but they had lost the trust, because some had been able to\nmanage to deposit substantial dollar accounts, right? So the German Germans got mad, right, and\nwent after them because they were Jews, not because they were capitalist financiers. So the greed\n-- and everyone was on the bandwagon. Land prices were going up, so you bought land prices\ncheap, reselling them at higher values. There were certain guarantees by the Hitler regime. If\nyour direct recourse as a high ranking party member you could that -- get all the financial\nfunding you wanted to get to -- to -- to do this [indecipherable] right? It paid there for bec -- to\nbecome a party member and move up high in the rank because you were a talented foreign\nexchange administrator. You got these medals of this and that and everything else. And with the\ngreed, there was the greed for Jewish accumulations of currency, Jewish accumulations of -- of\nthe fine arts especially, and the disappearance, in a very short period of time, period around --\nwhen was that, 1930 -- 1940 - 1941, of all those very famous [indecipherable] in Berlin, Jewish\nart dealers, right, with the Germans sequestering all that, even though they let go guys like -- like\nRosen-Rosenbaum -- Rosenthal, right? So with that greed, the greed became massive, plunder,\nall the [indecipherable] Jewish properties to start, then the properties of the Polish aristocracy,\nand then looking beyond that, the plundering of westernmost Russia. Great cause for invasion,\nthe invasion wasn\u2019t about eradicating communism. The invasion was the Germans, the -- Hitler\nneeded all the raw materials he could lay his hands on, and whatever world there was, including\nthe -- including the wealth creation in the -- in the Ukraine under -- under top level agricultural\nsoil. Plunder was at the base of it. Typical medieval warfare.",
        "Q: So, in 19 --",
        "A: And everybody jumped in the bandwagon. My grandmother made a profit [indecipherable]\nthe extra jobs and the extra contracts, right? So the question of morality? Hitler didn\u2019t say he\nwanted all that because he was going to major -- wage a major war. Oh, by the way, have you\nnoticed something interesting? That great courageous, purely racist superior German nation was\nonly winning wars against little countries that were little and totally unarmed. So where is the big\nheroism? Killing all the you -- the Poles in six weeks? The ger -- the Yugoslavs in four weeks?\nHungarians, just walked over, Romania walked over. Big deal. The Frenchies were unprepared,\nright? And they were comparatively a much smaller country, right, smaller industrial capacity\nand that. So what about -- many of the Germans today still claim -- oh my God, I know from the\ntrial, most of the Germans have -- Viel trial, most of the German opinion hasn\u2019t changed.",

        "A: Yeah, yeah.",

        "Q: Well, that\u2019s 38.",

        "A: -- got even more prevalent because Hitler had brought law and order, he had kicked out the\ncommunists, or imprisoned the communists, or exterminated the communists except for the few\nwho were getting away to the Soviet Union. And the bourge -- bourgeoisie, I think if I can\ngeneralize like that, from my own family\u2019s point of view, they were saying well, at least he has\ngiven us jobs, he has given us law and order and he has given us the perception that the commies\nhave diminished their influence in central Europe, and that the possibility of a Spanish civil war\nreoccurring, destroying the aristocracy and the -- the bourgeoisie -- our bourgeoisie in central\nEurope has been -- has been put to -- brought to a halt.",
        "Q: And did you want Germany to come into Hungary\u201d?",
        "A: I was never a German watcher, my -- my dream was always to go to Budapest and play the\nfirst fiddle somewhere along the line in Hungarian foreign policy, which would have been a very\ndifficult thing to do because the Hungarians hate the Romanians. The Hungarians hate the\nthought -- my God, the Hungarians hate the Gypsies, and many Hungarians hated the Jewish\npeople.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So being a Hungarian diplomat, it may -- may not have been a wise choice at all, on\nhindsight.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But that thought is what --",
        "Q: But that\u2019s what you were thinking about.",
        "A: -- was my ability to get away from the peasant way of life and don\u2019t forget I had two uncles in\nBudapest and they had very important government posts, so I\u2019d be like in good hands in\nBudapest.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And my father always said [speaks foreign language here] You have got to become a\nsomebody, you\u2019ve got to become a somebody because you are number one, right, after the war\nand I said -- well I\u2019ve already mentioned that to you, see. And before the war, to become a\nnumber one [indecipherable] you had to go to Budapest, which was the capital city closest to\n[indecipherable]. And then it was hort -- Horthy was, for me, until 1944, when the\n[indecipherable] replaced him, a person that I could trust because he had [indecipherable] of B\u00e9la\nKun, he had provided Hungary with enough economic benefits for association with the Germans\nand the re-association with the Austrians. And he also kept the riffraff, Romanian riffraff and\nthings like that kind of at bay. So I could live with the system.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But when -- when the Germans attack Russia in 1941, before you get into the\nWaffen SS --",
        "A: Before that Yugoslavia comes in, don\u2019t forget please, April 1941.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: That changed everything. The real -- that -- the German attack on northern Yugoslavia and\nthe marching through Romania demonstrated to me that the German power was overwhelming\nand it couldn\u2019t care less about the individualism and the natural character of the smaller nation.\nThey would just march in, right, occupy them and brutalize them. And with the first hanging of\nthese dozens and dozens of Serbs, and letting them be hanging there on the market for days and\ndays and days, demonstrate to me that there was something about the Germans that you had to be\nfrightened of.",
        "Q: So you become frightened?",
        "A: But the only way -- I became in that sense anti-Nazi -- anti-German German.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But that was no different because most Austrians throughout the history were anti-German,\nright? But --",
        "Q: But that wasn\u2019t true now.",
        "A: -- the feeling that f -- the feeling strengthened to me. So I was looking at Budapest even more,\nsaying that the Serbs had been defeated, they have become impotent, where else can I go? I'd -- I\nwas just about to finish my high school education so I was hanging onto the dream of going to\nBudapest and shedding this Barcika and Barnard be -- and being in the core country of\nmarginalization. I would have been happy with that. My education was getting to it, and the\ninfluence of Anna Fayish, was a lady the second [indecipherable] that raised me, right, was\nstrictly a -- Baylor, you go to Budapest, you\u2019I|l be okay. And I thought going to Budapest I\u2019d be\nable to kind of hide from all these things. And the first thing you know they drafted me.",
        "Q: Well, let me ask you something. How -- how do you accommodate for both thinking that\nwhen the Nazis come in --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- they do things to individuals --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- that your -- you\u2019re no longer safe as an individual any more.",
        "A: Not any more.",
        "Q: And -- and the world in which you want to live by then --",
        "A: You see, but don\u2019t -- don\u2019t forget, at that time being an individual still meant something in --\nin -- in -- 1n soci -- societal layers in which you could claim to have some residual rights, if you\nwere V.I.P., cooperating with the Germans. You were guaranteed as long as you cooperated. If\nyou were somebody highly critical of the Germans, or [indecipherable] to the Serbs, they pick\nyou up and shoot you. So -- and there was no in between. You were either there or here. To be in\nthe middle and have no opinion at all would be perhaps true of the peasants who were working.\nIf you were in the bourgeoisie, one way or the other you were visible, right? You were out in the\nopen and you necessarily were expected to wield an opinion. Now, the opinion couldn\u2019t be like --\nI have -- I have not seen 1-in the Barnard where I was living then, any Hungarian leader\nmarching in the street and telling the Germans it is wrong for you to hang all the Serbs. They\nwere keeping their mouth shut. I have never seen a Protestant or a Catholic preacher, priest or\nbishop, and there were several bishops in a large area, going out and telling German\n[indecipherable] German, you mustn\u2019t do that, it\u2019s inhuman. So they were hold their mouth shut\nas far as possible if they had no dependents and linkages with the Germans.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: But the ones in industry, the ones who were delivering wheat, the ones who were delivering\nthe wines to the Germans, they necessarily were okay under economic advantage. And you\nknow, in circumstances like that, unless you have economic survival, you have no survival. Now,\nthis is a horrendous statement to make. If the economic survival depends on your -- is the\noutcome of your unwillingness to pinpoint the evil, and come out and say it is wrong. Cause if\nyou had done that, they shoot you.",
        "Q: So there was not --",
        "A: So it was absolute power. I was faced for the first time in my life with this. I didn\u2019t know the\nconcept. I know now the concept of what is absolute power. I\u2019m not saying that absolute power\ncorrupts absolutely. It\u2019s one of the aberrations. But, I was faced with absolute power, and seeling\n-- seeing all those dead ones, the disappearance of the Jewish people, the quiet and furtive\ndisappearance was a -- 0-of lesser significance. Not because they were Jewish people, but\nbecause it was invisible, if right in front of your nose, what horrendous thing the Germans could\ndo. At the same time they were all marching. I remember the black uniforms tn -- in\nMontbachkirche, the t -- main town hall was a great old traditional building, Austrian style.\nBeautiful all kind of statues and beautiful columns and that -- and they were -- the main gate was\nabout 10 feet wide and there was a German black uniform left and right, beautiful blonde, and a -\n- they were handing -- selling [indecipherable] white -- white whatever you call it, a piece of the\nleather strips of that --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] wait th -- one -- one second, one second.",
        "A: Absolute power.",
        "Q: What -- can you hold?",
        "A: Okay. Sorry.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They looked as an example of absolute power in practice. You were terrified just looking at\nthat.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And then some b -- would be partisan Serbs killed one of them. In return Germans rounded up\n200 and hanged them on the following day. Just picking them up in the street of Montbachkirche.\nHang them up on the main square. And then you\u2019re a 17 year old kid, or a 16 year old kid, you\nsay well, what is happening? I know there was one moment in which my brother and I, with all\nthis mixing of things, we put on -- we -- I was able to obtain a little French flag, and I put the\nFrench flag on my lapel because I wasn\u2019t a German, I wasn\u2019t really a Hungarian in Hungary, I\nwas a Hungarian living in the Barnard at that time. I certainly wasn\u2019t a Serb, I don\u2019t want to look\nas a Romanian, which I possibly do. I wanted to say I\u2019m special, I\u2019m French. Trouble is, the\nFrench had already been defeated, so it didn\u2019t really mean much.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But it was my brother\u2019s and I kind of demonstration of something that we\u2019re, hey, we\u2019re a bit\ndifferent, right? We are neither this, nor this, nor that. And certainly not German.",
        "Q: And what did your brother think of all this that was going on?",
        "A: Oh, he was so happy in the store, the -- because in terms of purchasing power, the -- I\nremember the [indecipherable] store had greater and greater difficulties getting oranges, and\ngetting all the select merchandise because once th-the Germans came in, all these so-called\nnecessities for the bourgeoisie were disappearing, and ration cards were -- ensued, right? So my\nbrother\u2019s concern was how do I help keep a store afloat that has become the meaning in my life?\nAnd how do I get oranges to my lady friend -- lady friend in the old traditional sense, right?\nMaybe touching, maybe [indecipherable] but nothing more than that [indecipherable] the girl\nthat I love, where oranges cannot be any more obtained because of the German embargo on\neverything.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You see? So it was looking -- it was looking very miserable, and I told you I had seen him cry\nquite a few times after she disappeared --",
        "Q: Would you -- would you have called yourself apolitical at that time, in a way?",
        "A: I was -- well, if apolitical by definition means you have no interest in politics, no.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I was surrounded too much by the first indications of absolute terror, not to take time out and\nthink about the consequences. But having nowhere to turn, having nowhere to go, in that\ndesperate situation I was looking more and more at Budapest as my safe haven, sort of imagining\nthat Hitler would never do it to Horthy. And two years later he did. And I remember that the\nGermans established a local police by the name of some kind of a national guard populated or --\nor peopled by Volksdeutsche and the chief of that was a -- a lawyer trained in Dubocka, in the\nadjacent province, a Dr. Wright, who had gotten his PhD [indecipherable] in German, in Nazi\nGermany became -- came back down -- if you look at the typical Nazi, what do you see? A huge\nchin, a small forehead, a big belly, strong legs, eyes bulging forward like that, and cruelty in the\nface. He declared himself general of the police, right. He came to our home in March or April\n1942 and said, Colonel, if you try -- \u2019ve gone on record with that, even in German court --\nColonel, if you try to hide your brother -- your son -- your two sons, you will be declared\nmagaroni. Your sons, don\u2019t try to get them over to Hungary, we\u2019ll hide -- we\u2019ll find them, we\u2019 Il\nput them up against the wall, we\u2019ll shoot them. And made my father shut up. And our name got\nonto the list. And I\u2019m often -- I\u2019ve often wondered, I still wonder, if I had been the father, being\ntold that by a brutal looking Volksdeutsche nobody whose son is a general of the police, what\nwould I have done?",
        "Q: So what did he do?",
        "A: He did nothing. He lived through seeing our names put on, then he talked to us, he said, you\nknow, the time has come to let you know that communism has become a threat. Look at all these\npartisans killing all these Germans. You have an obligation going back to the empire, to keep the\n[indecipherable]. And that was that.",
        "Q: So that meant you had to join --",
        "A: He gave up on us.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So that, were you then conscripted?",
        "A: He gave up on us, yeah. I [indecipherable] very often, and I\u2019ve often wondered -- and my\nbrother said, absolutely I will not go, and my father said look, if you don\u2019t want the whole\ncatastrophe of the whole family, because Wright was a -- oh Wright was, by the way, c-caught\nby the partisans early in 1945.",
        "Q: Who was --",
        "A: Irwin Wright, Dr. Wright.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The con -- so-called -- self declaimed general [indecipherable] police [indecipherable] were\ncaught and unceremoniously hanged for repeated brutality and -- and crimes against humankind.\nHe personally was involved in many tortures of presumed partisan leaders.

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You see. And -- but again, I -- I\u2019m -- I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m against people ca -- getting some criminal\ntypes and hanging them on the tree, but I think the partisans were absolutely right to hang him.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: [Il go on official record, I told the German judges that. See, he was -- he was -- he was -- he\nwas -- he was a criminal, not just --",
        "Q: So why did -- why did this guy -- oh, there he 1s. Okay. [tape break] Ill check it out.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. All right, we\u2019re ready. You [indecipherable |",
        "A: So, just to let you know that even though I\u2019ve always suffered with this -- this notion that\nsince I don\u2019t have a PhD in philosophy, I\u2019Il never be first class.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Yes, right.",
        "A: Okay, we go --",
        "Q: Tell me, why did this guy Wright go to your father to say that he better -- that you two -- that\nyou two boys would be put on the list.",
        "A: Because my father was a visible member of the community, equally at home in the\nHungarians speaking and the German speaking, having a mother who was Austrian German and\ntherefore, by the Hitlerian laws had given offspring to a half German, who had given offspring to\nquarter Germans, because Austria had been absorbed into Germany, had become Germanized,\nand in terms of the racial profile you had to go back seven generations to prove that you were\nAryan, right?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We were qualified, classified as half Germans.",
        "Q: But it sounds fe --",
        "A: Wait, wait, wait --",
        "Q: Yes, okay.",
        "A: -- as half Germans. And since they needed everybody to get the 27,000 Volksdeutsche recruit",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to fill in the numbers of our division, they had to reach out for persons well beyond the pure\nGermanism of the really simple Volksdeutsche, who were a hundred percent Germanic, right?\nAnd since my father was a visible member of the community, going to him, to gave an example -\n- he [indecipherable] Wright was g -- was given example to others --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- who were like of mixed blood, to make sure. And depending on how my father would\nbehave, they would then also fall into step.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So my father, as I already mentioned to you, proved that [indecipherable] morally, he said\nyou\u2019re obliged to, because Austria-Hungary was always there to defend western civilization from\nthe [indecipherable] from Asia, right, so the war ca -- secondly the church approves of tha-that,\nthe church demands that, God demands that, and thirdly I\u2019ll tell you, there is no choice, period.\nAnd there was no way out. There was nowhere to go.",
        "Q: Right. So do you receive a notice to come?",
        "A: Ah yes, yes, it was a notice, yeah. After Wright came I think the notice came about a week\nafter, saying that the notice was a formal notice of induction and the notice of you shall present\nyourself -- my brother was, I think, on the first of May and I was on the first of June.",
        "Q: And were you in the same division? The Prince Eugen division?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: Were you in the same division?",
        "A: Yeah, in the same division, yeah. It was strictly that the whole Barnard was used for the\nsetting up of the Prince Eugen division, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the Prince Eugen has very special significance in Austria\u2019s history, because it was he\nwho beat the chur -- the Turks, and expanded the Austrian bi -- b-boundaries to include the --\nthat whole area into Austria-Hungary.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Right -- right around the Danube river, beyond where the Romanian boundary 1s today.",
        "Q: So your -- your brother and yourself both get letters --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",

        "A: Everybody, everybody --",
        "Q: Everybody gets letters.",
        "A: -- everybody -- I think actually letters were sent out to those who had better schooling,\nbecause we, the graduates of -- even though I was in Hungarian school -- so it had no business in\nusing me at all, because it was the induction of the Volksdeutsche. The Volksdeutsche were all\nlinked with the Volksdeutsche shul -- schools that were established after the Germans came in,\nand they were established with the Germans in using the -- the Nazi oriented leadership of the\nVolksdeutsche then, to set up German schools following the right German examples. And those\nwho were in that school when [indecipherable] German speaking. I was in Hungarian school and\nthey drafted me even though I was -- and my brother had already finished high school.",
        "Q: But you were considered Volksdeutsche in some way.",
        "A: Yeah, ah -- th-they were -- in their declaration they had to refer to me as Volksdeutsche as\nthey would have had no right whatsoever to draft me.",

        "A: Spoke some German, but the German was not -- I can show you all my photos, all my photos\nthe back wall -- on th-the back page they have Hungarian language.",
        "Q: But did you spea --",
        "A: I knew German, but I was by now means -- I was very far from being -- and I didn't\nunderstand German German. They are completely different [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I was demoted [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And where were -- where were you and your brother sent at first?",
        "A: My brother went first. He was already in the -- he was -- he was forced to go to the artillery\nregiment. I re -- I remember him, remembering visiting when he was in [indecipherable], he was\nabout 80 kilometers above where I was and I remember seeing the -- the barracks where he was.\nHe was inside the barracks, holding on desperately to the steel partitions, looking like the guy,\nI\u2019ve got to get away, I\u2019ve got to get away. And I was cry. And I went with my father, my father\nsaid nothing, just stony face, but I saw in my brother\u2019s eyes that he was so terribly unhappy. He\nran away three times, and he took phone calls from my dad every time and the third time they\nalmost shot him, but then, upon repeated phone calls, they decided they would demote him from\nthe signals into a punishment battalion. And he stayed with that until he died.",
        "Q: And what is -- what is a punishment battalion?",
        "A: Punish battalion is a battalion which was set up specifically for those who don\u2019t -- don\u2019t\nperform military duty according to regulations. Those who have been captured trying to escape,\nor known to have been wanting to escape, or those who have been escaped and then captured.\nAnd it\u2019s -- the survival rate was then maybe 10 percent. And I remember my brother\u2019s face, I\nremember my brother\u2019s face, I think he came there when I was visiting also in the -- that was a\nkind of second -- around the 25\"\" of December 1944, when I was being brought up with a couple\nof other officer candidates from these front lines in the Balkans through a little village on the\nDanube river, where he was stationed with his battalion. And I had found out where he was and\nwe saw ourselves maybe for a half an hour and we talked about what can we do, where can we\ngo. And he told me look, you\u2019Il be behind the front, you better go because it\u2019ll save your life.\nAnd he said, as far as I\u2019m concerned there\u2019s nothing I can do because there\u2019s nowhere that I can\nrun to.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I left him there, I -- feeling terribly guilty not -- not to have stayed longer, but we\ncouldn\u2019t stay together longer.",
        "Q: Was he able --",
        "A: Not to stay longer, to -- to find a way out.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: My main reason for going to officer school was it was safely behind the lines [indecipherable]\nand the chances of survival were 90 percent. I -- I simply had to survive.",
        "Q: And you had a choice of what kind of regiment you were in?",
        "A: Well, you can -- no, if they -- they say that you are picked to go, you have to go, but there are\nmany reasons why they would go. Some would fall in the river, say oh thank you very much, I\nwant to die for Hitler, I want to be an officer for Hitler. Others will just stand there, you know,\nsay nothing. Command is a [indecipherable] command, and their system was a command system.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I said -- I said nothing, I just said yes. I was actually surprised because I wasn\u2019t fitting in and\nI\u2019d been demoted once for not understanding the German well enough, and yet somehow they, I\ndon\u2019t know --",
        "Q: So how do you get demoted fr --",
        "A: -- oh, you know why they picked me? I had -- I was one of the few remaining who had high\nschool graduation, and by the law of induction into officer training, you were still expect to have\nhad at least high school.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I had happened to have had high school, so they put me into, and there were seven or\neight of us picked.",
        "Q: You --",
        "A: Seven or eight out of 42 graduates, all of whom had perished. All the others had already died.",
        "Q: What was training like?",
        "A: Training?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Was there any?",
        "A: I mentioned to you my love of sports. And I found myself in a nation, in UNRRA\n[indecipherable] bossed around by those eight foot tall Germans with shoulders like that,\nwaistlines like that, legs like that, being able to run a hundred yards in five seconds or at least so\nthey claim. And I said to myself -- oh, by the way, by that time I\u2019d already been called Gypsy,\nBalkanaiser, pork eater, bacon eater, you name it [indecipherable] just because of my looks.\nThere\u2019s something -- and they told me you\u2019ve got to be able to prove something, that you\u2019re\nequal and competitive, at least in something. So I took them on with their marching 10\nkilometers in 40 minutes, with fully -- things loaded, I never lagged behind. In no time -- I\u2019m\nvery [indecipherable] my hands [indecipherable] I was -- in no time I was very, very good at the\nMorse code.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Oh, well, I was in signals.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Wireless. You see, there were signals wire, telephone, civil Morse code. Oh, I outdid the Volk\nGermans. There was one Volk German guy by the name of -- what was the name? I should know\n[indecipherable]. Anyway, one, the real Volksdeutsche, who terribly wants to be like a\nReichsdeutsche. His hair was [indecipherable] like that, he was reddish blonde, blue eyes, big\nnose sticking out, big shoulders, and [indecipherable] Nicholas his name was. And he always\nsaid, Lally, you\u2019re a magaroni, you just can\u2019t do -- you just can\u2019t to it. And I looked and I said,\nyou know Nicholas, I proved to you that as a magaroni I can do it. So ou -- I beat him every time\nin our speedwriting, in the -- in the signals. That was fun. And I beat him every time in long\nmarches, and I beat him every place else. Here was my personal challenge to prove to me that\neven though in their eyes I was only a Gypsy kind of a looking guy, deep inside myself I was a\nman, I was a human being, you know? And they were all smoking [indecipherable] and they\nwere all womanizing. Our jackets, the military jackets had a small pocket on the inside, inside of\nthe left. Condoms.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I have no idea where they bought the condom, but -- so the -- the commanding sergeant\ncomes and says, this weekend you will be allowed to go out. There are two of them in there,\nmake sure that you use them because [Il -- P\u2019Il check on you if you did or not because for the\nfuehrer you\u2019ve got to procreate children. No questions about who the girl will be, no question if\nthey would be willing or not, no question married or not, you\u2019ve got to do it. And I had a --\ngained a good friend, Walter Meyhallowicz, whose grandfather had been Serb, but who had been\nGermanized because of two German mothers marrying into the clan. He was a tall guy, black,\nblack, black, like a Gypsy looking. So we kind of stuck together because we were -- both looked\n[indecipherable] right? So I looked at -- Walter said, what are we going to do with that, he says.\nHe was two years older, I don\u2019t know if he had experience or not. So he said, we\u2019ll find us a new\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: So the sports kept me -- helped me keep myself in good shape, and I was also somehow, even\nthough I\u2019d been raised very pr -- in a very protective environment -- we had a maid, we had a\njunior maid, we had the [indecipherable], the Jack of all trades man. We were not allowed to do\nphysical labor. I was never allowed to go to the kitchen because [indecipherable] all that stuff,\nright? I didn\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t learn how to fend for myself.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No, I hadn\u2019t. But then, in the army your rations aren\u2019t really adequate if you want to keep\nyour body in good shape. So somewhere along the line observing others, and there was an older\nVolksdeutsche, a ba -- farmer, who really knew how to find potatoes and things like that, so I\nwas learning very, very quickly. And on the front I always knew how to have a few extra morsels\nof bread in my pocket, like to chew at. And I always knew how to have extra newspapers to wrap\naround my feet, because the German boots were totally pervious to cold [indecipherable] you\nhad frozen feet in no time. But we discovered if you wrap them in paper on top at -- on top of the\nsock, your chances were 90 percent better of not getting your toes freeze -- fro-frozen off.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And with that you somehow learned how to handle life, even in the most difficult\ncircumstances. And again, not smoking was a very great contributor to being able to develop\nsome kind of resistance against the terrible cold in Yugoslavia, and then also on the southeastern\nfront; 40 below zero in that, you know? And it -- I had this extra energy also because of the\n[indecipherable] rations. To go through the darkest times and always kind of wanting to show\nthat even though you guys think I\u2019m an untermen -- in my eyes I\u2019m not an untermenschen. I\ndidn't want to prove that I was a Nazi. I would never want to be a Nazi. I didn\u2019t look like one,\nright? Or behave like one. But I wanted to prove I\u2019m a human being, I shouldn\u2019t be looked down\nat.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And a very as -- na -- strong motivating factor was that we were compelled to read the \u201cMein\nKampf\u2019. We were compelled to read the what, the f -- the mi -- m-me -- me -- mama -- \u201cThe\nMythos of the 20\" Century,\u201d by Rosenberg, right? And we were compelled to enjoy\nindoctrination every day, all with the same thing, heil Hitler this, heil Hitler that. But they will\nnever have an opportunity to do anything with the brains that we still had for purposes of\nlearning. And somewhere in my mind there was -- an increasing part of my brain had became\ncompletely aloof against their attempts to take my mind over completely and make me\ncompletely embrace their serial ideology. And one of the clinching moments came when the\nofficer investigating my racial purity told me who I would have to get married to. Cause it may\nnot be important to you, it may not be important overall within the context of the Holocaust, but\nsomewhere in my mind there was enough of a defensive mechanism in which the I wanted to be\nme, and in which there was still enough scope left for the brain to fill in the void and to undo the\ndamage caused to the other part, whichever it was, the left or the right.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: And the killing in the panzergraben was a second major determining for that. You see, I still\nask myself how come I knew, after witnessing all that killing, after losing most of my friends in\nthe war, after witnessing some of the atrocities, including some -- a couple of Germans had their\ngenital parts cut off by partisan female. Another partisan female had a big stick stuck into her\n[indecipherable]. After witnessing all that and becoming completely immune to any perception\nof morality, how come I knew when Viel was doing the killing, that 1t was wrong? But I knew it\nwas wrong, but I was so terribly scared at the same time. I knew it was wrong. I was scared. So I\nwas just petrified. What do you do with that? So, just like my dad when Dr. Wright came, I\ndecided nothing -- I decided I do nothing, because I wanted to survive. And I talked to Rabbi\nPoupko about that, a very senior conservative rabbi in Montreal. I asked him, what would you\nhave done, Rabbi? He |-liked my testimony, he liked my -- he said, Adal -- al -- Lallier, you\nreally have courage. I said, it\u2019s not courage, it is [indecipherable]. Well, I say it\u2019s courage. I say,\nwhat would you have done? He said, in the eyes of the Jewish interpretation of God, one\u2019s own\nlife always comes first. Now, I don\u2019t know if he told me that, if it\u2019s true or not, or if he told me\nthat to appease me, to decrease my pain or my agony, but he told me, you were absolutely right\ntrying to si -- preserve your life, assuming that would have become a creative life. You didn\u2019t\nwant to waste that. And he said, the fact alone that you finally decided to speak up proves that\nyou were right in keeping your mouth shut, because if you hadn\u2019t, they would you put a -- put\nyou up on the spot and shot you. So, good excuse, but I still did nothing.",
        "Q: But --",
        "A: Why didn\u2019t my father try to get us away? Maybe because he wouldn\u2019t have had -- oh who --\nwho -- wh-who -- I don\u2019t know, there were no airplane, there were no flights out. Would have to\nbe -- I don\u2019t know, there were no boats on which to go, we were in the central Europe. So how\ndo you get away over three or four, 500 kilometers of -- of territory that belonged to the Hitler\nGermans? How do you do it? I-I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s go back and tal -- and tell me a little bit more about what the -- the training, the\nideoli -- ideological training was like. You were all forced to read \u201cMein Kampf.\u201d",
        "A: We were all -- we were given lectures, ideological lectures. Weltanschauung, you can write\nthat down, but the term is well known. Weltanschauung.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know that from philosophy, right. Weltanschauung was an obligatory course throughout\nthe four and a half months training of Pinuna. And the weltanschauung is really teaching us how\nto take the oath of fealty to Hitler, not question anything about that and -- and to exercise com-\ncomplete commitment to the oath, even willingness to die for it.",
        "Q: And what was the oath?",
        "A: And that was -- we had the physical training -- I -- I liked the physical training. But what I\nliked about the physical training is to find out that I too, coming from the nowhere, could do it\nalmost as well, even better than some of the German Germans did. And that\u2019s where the\nOlympian image rose in my mind, you see.",
        "Q: But were you feeling conflicted being in -- in what is a Nazi group?",

        "Q: I mean the Waffen SS is a Nazi --",

        "A: You mean -- no, I -- that -- no, th-the -- already -- I\u2019ve come a -- already on record saying that\nwhen they finally -- and I\u2019m kind of jumping now --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- eventually the oath of fealty was taken for the division as a whole --",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And I have reasons to believe that I was the only one who said quietly, so that no one would\nhear me, instead of I swear the honor of Hitler, I sweared the Miklos Hort-Horthy.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So I -- I pled my f-f -- oath of allegiance to a guy that I believed in.",
        "Q: But not [indecipherable]",
        "A: See, in that sense I was an exception. And alone saying Horthy, I was not professing myself\non behalf of Nazism, but Horthy-ism. But Horthy-ism too, on hindsight, was a semi-feudal\nFascistic state -- state of mind, with an absolute dictator on the top. But it was not based on racial\nimpurities or --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- racial discrimination and that. It was just Hungarianism, but I was very -- I was feeling\nhappy with that, but I was also feeling happy that nobody had overheard me.",
        "Q: Right. But you also had to read Rosenberg, who was clearly a racist.",
        "A: Oh, on Rosenberg we were not read, but we were read excerpts to --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- during the weltanschauung.",
        "Q: So did you then learn what the racial feeling of Nazism was?",
        "A: Well, we were -- we were being told. Learning means you are taught how to think for\nyourself.",
        "Q: No, no, not necessarily. I mean, sometimes --",
        "A: Oh well, my interpretation --",
        "Q: -- it can be bad learning.",
        "A: I brought you a printout of my appointment as a full professor --",

        "A: -- how to see things.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the only way to see things properly was the way they were telling us. I remember a\nphilosophy professor [indecipherable] some years ago, appearing and saying Lallier, when I go\nto my classroom I tell them, I am the one who knows it all, on th -- only to listen to me. Ill\nexamine you on those questions and you\u2019ll know it all. So I\u2019m the one that you have to repeat in\norder to pass. Same thing there.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So they knew th -- knew the stuff they had to learn to earn their diploma, but they were not\nreally literate persons who could think for themselves. And I say that -- most of those of the\npeasant stock fell completely, wholesale for what the Nazis were feeding them. And Lowd was\none par -- very particular example. You see --",

        "Q: By the way, was there a Waffen SS song that was sung? Something like if others prove I\u2019m tr",
        "A: The Waffen SS by that time had become a propaganda tool by which they were hoping to\nentice the physically more capable and mentally more alert to volunteer for service on behalf of -\n- and I\u2019m being very formal in that -- on behalf of defending western civilization against godless\ncommu -- see, I still have it in my blood. At the same time, since the really noble ones fit in that\nperfect image were being killed in Russia left, right and center, they badly needed replacements,\nso in no time, by mid-1940 th-the standards were being reduced. No more [indecipherable] 76.\nNo more shoulders like that, waistlines 32, feet like that and [indecipherable] like that and\nblonde and all that. They were taking left, right and center. And more and more of the small\nMediterranean, Gypsy looking types were got -- gotten in. More and more compromising\nadmissions by people of half blood, that first of all, you had to have half blood, then you had to\nhave quarter blood, the-then you said, unless there was a Jewish grandmother you'll be taken\nwhatever your blood com -- blood combination is. But one restriction remained. You shouldn\u2019t\nhave had a Jewish grandmother. And even that restriction was eventually raised, right? O-Or\nerased. But I remember you had to go back seven generations to prove it -- prove that you\u2019re\npure Aryan. But all that -- most of that had fallen by wayside mid-1943.",

There may have been shooting at [indecipherable] once in awhile. Anyway, he wrote a\nbook about the Waffen SS signals [indecipherable]. And it is from that -- and he asked me to\nread through that, I met him through somebody else.

        "A: Oh yes. We also -- we had the signals training, we had the ideological training, we had the\nphysical training, which I absolutely was very happy with, and we have the skills training. The --\nall the weapons you can possibly imagine in -- from the pistols, for would be officers eventually,\nit\u2019s essential training. You had the carbine, which carbine question came up during the court,\nbecause I insisted 1t was the [indecipherable] carbine and some of the Nazi Germans counter-\ninsisted that the Waffen SS had never had [indecipherable] carbine, but the judge graciously --\nWinkler, took my explanation, having discovered through some not Nazi experts that they were\nCzech carbines, which we may have been using then, or he may have been able to use. And we\nhad the Mitryettes, and we had especially the Sturmgewehr. Sturmgewehr was a 1944\nproduction, very similar to the Soviet AK 457 which could spit out, I think 57 bullets, smaller\nbullets, in about three seconds, or something like that. And then we had also shooting with --\nwith -- what you call those little pipes? Mortars?",

        "A: That was -- yeah, again, that was in October 1944, in which we hadn\u2019t really learned -- we\nhad followed the partisans, we had not -- not been engaged at the headquarters level in facing\nany [indecipherable] formations with T -- T34 tanks and the whole bit the Soviets were throwing\nat us, and in three days of fighting we lost 90 percent of everything. We lost 90 percent of our\ntrucks. My truck was the only one to have survived the -- the massacre [indecipherable] because\nI was skillful enough -- I was the driver -- I was skillful enough to hide it behind a church, and I\nwas lucky enough to have escaped being directly shot at by -- I was -- had to cross a bridge, and\nthat -- right to bridge there were dozens of German vehicles destroyed by anti-tank fire, and I\nwas next in line to be shot at. And I had my five guys including my [indecipherable] in the truck,\nand I was driving like a madman, trying to hit the bridge, but before I made a sharp turn, I\ndecided to stop just for a brief moment, I don\u2019t know what made me stop. And at that moment I\nstopped the shot of the anti-tank weapon buzzed by the front of the windshield of the car. And\nthen I just so -- noticed that, they needed about 17 seconds for a second shot and I accelerated\nand got away. I was the only funkwagen who was saved from the whole division. The division\nhad 37 of wireless communication trucks.",
        "Q: And they were all --",
        "A: They all got perished and about 2500 guys died in three days, including a guy by the name of\nLisi, who stuck his neck out in front of the truck, was hit in chest on with the grenade, he just\ndisintegrated.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He was one of the very gifted high school graduates and he was a bourgeois son, he was a\nvery nice guy who was -- who was there I think for defending his motherland and his father\u2019s\nproperties from communism, and he was not a Nazi. But Lowd Nicholas was a Nazi.",
        "Q: And where -- after your tra -- how ma -- how many weeks were you in training?",
        "A: We were trained until for the first of June -- actually, 15\" of June, first of June I was drafted,\n15\" of June we were sent up to [indecipherable] and we were sent back down, totally contrary to\nour expectations because we thought we\u2019d be engaging against the Soviets, they sent us down to\nSerbia to fight the partisans who had by that time become very numerous. Because as you know,\nHitler\u2019s having invaded the Soviet Union, Tito immediately declared war on the Germans under\nhorrendous, horrendous circumstances for the partisans because they were nobodies, they had\nnothing, and yet they survived somehow. Tito is to me a -- a remarkable man, the way he took on\nthe Nazis, but he also let his people suffer because it was because of the odd -- killing of some\nodd German soldier, the Germans were hanging hundreds and hundreds of innocent Serb\ncivilians. And Tito added to power, exterminated the whole Yugoslav -- the whole -- the entire\nYugoslav bourgeoisie. You see, Tito is a major was criminal, but without Tito the war couldn\u2019t\nhave been won the way it has won, so I\u2019m kind of caught in between. One of my big images\nabout that he -- from the war is an image that I retrieved from a book written by one of Tito\u2019s p-\nprimary assistants [indecipherable] Angelis. You may have heard of Milo Angelis. He had a\nbook on wartime memora -- memor -- memor -- memoirs in which on one particular cage --\npage, there is a Serb young man about 18 years old, with a typical Serb cap, dressed like a poor\npeasant, standing under the gallows with that German officers surrounding him. And just before\nhe died, he raised his hand like that, and he died like that. Now, if I ever wanted to have a photo\nover which I\u2019d cry about the absolute courage in the face of actual power, that guy is my hero in\nmy mind. He was a total anti-Nazi, he who died because he believed that what Germans were\ndoing was wrong. Trouble is his death was caused by T-Tito\u2019s partisan killing one or two\nGermans. And this guy was rounded up in a small village chacha and hanged with many of the\nothers.",
        "Q: But you want to blame ti --",
        "A: An unforgettable picture.",
        "Q: -- you want to blame Tito and not the Nazis?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: Do you want to blame Tito and not the Waffen SS?",
        "A: No, no, no, I am blaming the Nazis.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They had no right to capture the 200, right? At the same time, amongst the 200, there was one\nwho dared raised his fist and tell the Germans face to face before they hanged him, but they\ndidn\u2019t prove merciful. They\u2019re being told [indecipherable] that you\u2019re dead wrong, you\u2019re killers.",
        "Q: When --",
        "A: I should send you that picture, perhaps.",
        "Q: Mm. When -- when you were in the Waffen SS in yu -- in the former Yugoslavia --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- in Serbia, did you know what Pri-Prince Eugen regiments were doing, the division was\ndoing in Yugoslavia?",
        "A: Oh, well, in the -- in the --",
        "Q: I mean, what sort of reports --",
        "A: -- we were the center of communication and our major task was to communicate between the\nvarious parts of the division, the various battalions and regiments about how to arrange the\nwarfare against the partisans.",
        "Q: But it was only --",
        "A: So it was strictly, strictly for two and a half years, from September 1942 to October 1944, we\nwere engaged strictly against the partisans, under murderous circumstances.",
        "Q: So you --",
        "A: We had no idea, because we are too far away in the center, no idea what atrocities were being\ncommitted by the various -- by the two regiments, or the two battalions, the various battalions.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t --",
        "A: But we did drive through villages that had been completely destroyed, and we knew that that\nis the price that the Serbs were -- most of the partisans were Serbs, right -- the Serbs were payi --\npaying for what they were trying to do to the Germans and those were the [indecipherable] that\nthe German Nazis were imposing upon them, finding two or three partisan that -- even burn the\nwhole village. And that was a fact of life of war, but that\u2019s the way I -- my interpretation was,\nthat is what the war is about. But deep inside myself I always knew that the Germans had no\nbusiness being in the Balkans, because I had carried forward, for me, the recognition when the\nGermans occupied Austria, it was upsetting history upside-down. The Germans had no business\nbeing in Austria, but the fact is, 1t was absolute power and I\u2019d become part and parcel of the\nabsolute power. So in a certain sense I was directly underwriting the absolute power by\ncommunicating messages.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But since I didn\u2019t see the destruction and dying in front of my eyes, this -- I kind of -- th-they\nremained kind of aloof of that. So I was only a communicator and not an executor. But all of that\ncame forcefully, right in front of my eyes because of Viel and his killing in the panzergraben.",
        "Q: So do you think in the -- some way you became numb during that period in Serbia?",
        "A: Yeah, one th -- one -- one becomes -- you see one death your -- you vom -- excuse me, you --\nyou vomit.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You see two de -- two dead, you vomit maybe a couple of times later. You see 10 dead --",
        "Q: You stop.",
        "A: -- you have a look and say, well [indecipherable] this 1s my friend. And if the friend is still\nalive, you quickly go there and hope that you can talk to him or soothe him, or talk to him or his\nmother or something like that to make him die in peace. If you see a hundred dead, hanging,\nwhich I had before they drafted me --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you'd see, well, if these were my people, what would I do with them? I\u2019d take them off the\nhangers, I suppose and I\u2019d give them a decent burial, that\u2019s all that we can do.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: What happened to all those people in the church, burned to the stake, who felt that it was\nwrong? They had no choice just to bury them quietly, didn\u2019t they? I\u2019m not absolving Nazis of\ntheir guilt.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But the hanging, the burning, how far back does that go into history? And why would an\neducated nation like the Germans, the highest proportion of PhDs of any of the nations of that\ntime, follow a pattern of medieval savagery? How does one explain that?",
        "Q: Because a PhD doesn\u2019t protect you --",
        "A: Yeah, well, well -- well --",
        "Q: -- clearly. So you -- you were in the Waffen SS in the Prince Eugen re-regiment?",
        "A: Yeah, I was in the Waffen SS --",
        "Q: Was that in \u00b042 to f --",
        "A: -- but please don\u2019t forget, the Waffen SS was the seventh division.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We still were given the Waffen SS blood group tattooed in.",
        "Q: Oh, you were.",
        "A: But we were never given a Waffen SS number, because to be truly a Waffen SS officer, you\nhave to have your number.",
        "Q: No number, uh-huh.",
        "A: So if you would call that a gross act of discrimination, call it that. I don\u2019t view it like that,\nonly [indecipherable] say it as a proof, they needed cannon fodder --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- they got the cannon fodder by force, without giving them equal legal protection. They had\neven promised German citizenship. None of the surviving members of the Prince Eugen got the\ncitizenship unless they qualified by living in Germany after the war for five years. So did they\ntreat the [indecipherable] as untermenschen? I want to go on official record, they treated the --\nReichs Germans treated the Volksdeutsche definitely as untermenschen and repeatedly called\nthem speck-fresser, bacon eaters and sigoina and balkinazer, including myself. And it was so bad\nthat the highest commander with -- of the Waffen SS, the SS [indecipherable] haupter eventually\nhad to pass an order all the way down asking the officers to finally put a stop to these\ndiscriminating references to the Volksdeutsche. And why that command? Because they still had\na hundred thousand Volksdeutsche that they haven\u2019t drafted yet and that they didn\u2019t want to lose.\nThe bodies, they were needed to fight th-the Soviets in the conditions of increasing despair.",
        "Q: Now, you were promoted twice, am I right?",
        "A: Well, I was promoted with everybody else, first to Sturmin and then to [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t promoted out of ranks. Actually, my first promotion, so-called, was delayed because\nafter they were sent down -- I was very good in signaling, in my Morse codes, so I was picked to\nbe amongst the first group to be sent on to Serbia. And I was standing -- like I was sent on two\nweeks before the second group was to follow, it was a stage, kind of transportation of troops,\n20,000 plus men. And I was up standing night guard over my teraf -- my -- my -- my Morse code\nmachine, and suddenly a phone call came in by somebody with a guttural German and gave me a\ncommand that I didn\u2019t understand. And you can\u2019t say, excuse me please, would you repeat that?\nAnd I said, Jawohl, and I did nothing. The following day the sergeant in charge called me and\nsays, Lallier, as of immediately, you are demoted to become a muli-fuehrer. A muli-fuehrer was\na -- a mule attendant. So, with my glorious knowl-knowledge of m -- the Morse codes, whatever\nthey would be, it would have been useful, I found myself in a stall with about 300 mult -- mules\nand mule attendants, about 30 of them, none of them having finished even elementary school. All\nof them having great hands, great backs, great understanding of their -- of their animals, but I\nmust maybe worriedly say, because it sound like discrimination, not much of a developed brain\npower.",
        "Q: We have to stop there.\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "Q: You were a muli-fuehrer after SS man?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you were a muli-fuehrer for six weeks?",
        "A: No, I was a SS man while being a muli-fuehrer.",
        "Q: Oh, you were both at the same time?",
        "A: There was no promotion. If you\u2019re a muli-fuehrer you get no promotion.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Until November 1942. And then they picked me up because they thought I may have some\nbrains because they must have looked at my high school certificate graduate [indecipherable] so\nput me into training as a truck driver.",
        "Q: As a truck driver.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. In 1942, when you were -- between 42 and \u00b044 --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- the end of \u201944, you were f --",
        "A: I was in the Balkans.",
        "Q: -- in the Balkans.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you hear anything about what was going on in the east?",
        "A: No, there was no --",
        "Q: Did you -- did you know about killing centers?",
        "A: -- no, we were --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- so busy fighting the Titoists who were becoming more and more numerous because of the\nGerman stupid policies of fighting the whole population. We had the position like in Iraq. In ord\n-- in -- in order to -- instead of making the population love you by being good to them and not\nhanging them, they did exactly the opposite, right? It became slow work, and the German\ncommand always referred to the partisans as bandits. Bandits who are f -- waging illegal warfare,\ntotally contrary to international agreements, right?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: And disagreement about the bandits, international, goes back about 150 years, without the\nquestion ever being asked first, well what are the countries doing in those countries in which\nthese bandits emerged in the first place.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So --",
        "A: Iam very concerned about, you know, international diplomacy, because that thing about\nbanditry in occupied countries is a direct consequence of the imperial party -- including\n[indecipherable] Austria-Hungary, having conspired to look at local uprises against foreign\ndomination as an illegal act at the mercy of countries that occupied the country. It\u2019s not right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Anyway, so we were there fighting the partisans, totally pursuing this Iraqi type of policy, I\nmust say honestly in -- in Iraq and -- and in a -- and in a -- in -- in Vietnam formerly, and it was\nhopeless because the more you hang the more young people would say, we don\u2019t want these\nbloody bastards and we were part and parcel of the bastards. So eventually we had to keep on\nretreating, retreating and treating because the Germans were doing badly, justifiably so, and the\nSoviets finally, the U-Ukrainian front, about three million men broke through 150,000 German\nline, some of it being kept open by the Prince Eugen, two or 3,000 remaining men, so we were\nretreating like mad. I still had my -- my communication truck. I was taking care of the truck\nbecause if you have a truck you can get away much faster than running for your life.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So slowly but steadily we moved towards Croatia, the then Croatia, today Croatia. And once\nwe reached the rina dri -- th-the river Drina, I got the call with the six other guys from the\nremnants of the graduates, the high school graduates that we\u2019ll be commanded as of tomorrow to\ngo through Vienna to Nuremberg to officers\u2019 school. Oh, I never got any medals, by the way.",
        "Q: You were commanded to go to officers\u2019 school?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what was --",
        "A: I was -- yeah, I was picked up, this was mid-December 1944, on the -- on taking back.",
        "Q: So the German are -- the Germans are losing but you\u2019re now sent to officers\u2019 school?",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "Q: What did -- what --",
        "A: -- don\u2019t forget, we were fighting the Soviets --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- we were being heavily decimated.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: There were only six or seven high school graduates left. The German officers corps in the\nWaffen SS was heavily depleted --",
        "Q: Right. So they wanted to --",
        "A: -- by all those [indecipherable]. So they needed any garbage. And for the first time they\ndeclared themselves that even Volksdeutsche so-called, an honorary Volksdeutsche would be\npicked --",
        "Q: To what?",
        "A: -- as possible candidate, but they were put in through the first phase very rigorously is to sort\nthem out, if they would found -- be found unqualified to become German officers, right?",
        "Q: So do you --",
        "A: And so I was one of the six or seven.",
        "Q: So you go to officers\u2019 school?",
        "A: Well, yeah, th-they call it cadet school.",
        "Q: Cadet school?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Where was this?",
        "A: Oh, the cadet school was supposed to have been in Nuremberg, so we took -- we took a train\nride from Croatia through Zagreb to Vienna, from Vienna to Nuremberg. We arrived in\nNuremberg two days after 2,000 allied planes had bombed the whole city to the smithereens,\nkilling 35,000 unsuspecting pro-Nazi Nurembergese, right? And we stayed there for two days\npicking up -- they used phosphor bombs. Would you want to know what a body looks like after it\ngot burned up? No, I wouldn\u2019t -- I'll tell you. Facial features remain exactly the same except they\nare charcoal black.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the bodies are [indecipherable]. So we were picking them by the thousands and putting\nthem into a pyre and burning eventually to the -- into ashes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And after two days the clearance came. Oh, they also dropped the bomb and a -- an air mine,\nwhich was a new invention. An air mine can destroy by air pressure, a thousand people in an area\nof about 100 square feet, and they dropped an air mine onto the SS luncheon barracks.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: There were about a thousand SS personnel and all of them died with their eyes blown out of\ntheir heads because of the air pressure, and we had to clean up that mess. Anyway, the -- we\nweren\u2019t in the area, that was two days before. And then we were told we would go by lorry from\nNuremberg directly into Chekia to go to Leitmeritz, because the officers\u2019 school, including the\nfirst stage, namely the cadet qualification part would have been delodged from Nuremberg,\nwhich was totally destroyed, to Leitmeritz, which was safely in the background from all\nactivities, even though the Soviets had broken through, they were still 200 kilometers away. So\nWalter and I, he was in the group, he looked at me and I looked at him, says, gee, we\u2019 lI finally be\nsafe. We'll finally survive. And then, on the way over, about 12 kilometers outside of Leitmeritz\non the -- still on the western side, the [indecipherable] from the west, suddenly we\u2019re told, augen\nnach links. Eyes to the left. Varoon, why? Juden -- I remember the off suf -- off sub officer --",
        "Q: They said Juden?",
        "A: Yeah, just said Juden. [speaks German here]. You are not allowed to look. To retain our\npurity as Aryan officer candidates, I suppose, right? You mustn\u2019t look at the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yes, but Waffen SS were also in concentration camps.",
        "A: Well yes, but not the real Waffen SS. The concentration camp guards, not Waffen SS, they\nwere special guards, if you know the SS [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But there were Waffen SS personnel --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- amongst them who had been wounded, who had even volunteered, or who had been\notherwise assigned in administrative posts. If you go through the lists you will discover that,\nright, right?",
        "Q: But you couldn\u2019t let --",
        "A: So I -- I beg your pardon ma\u2019am, SS, concentration camp guards were members of the\nAllgemeine SS.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The Waffen SS were supposedly, 99 percent of the time, 99 percent of their -- of their per --\npresence as soldiers, preoccupied to fight in the east and the west.",
        "Q: But you\u2019re being ironic.",
        "A: But about 600 of them over the course of the three, four years of the war did do service in the\nconcentration camps.",
        "Q: Do you think --",
        "A: And we went directly to the officers\u2019 school, and the first time it hits us, Juden, the question\ncame up between Walter and I, what\u2019s that? And being young men who had survived three years\nof partisan warfare, we\u2019d say [indecipherable] Juden? Why aren\u2019t we allowed to look? And we\narrived in Leitmeritz with that question, and eventually -- that was end of January 1945.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: By mid-March we knew.",
        "Q: What did you know?",
        "A: The concentration camp.",
        "Q: You knew that it was a camp, I get it.",
        "A: Because on the 18\" of March, we arise in the morning at five o\u2019clock and told, you are going\nto go on guard duty, eight to nine kilometers away. You\u2019ve got to line up immediately with\nweapons which we will distribute to you, because weapons were not generally distributed unless\nyou were on the front lines, right, we\u2019 ll give the weapons to you, we will board the lorries and\nwe'll drive westward to pick up prisoners. And after driving for about three-quarters of an hour\nwe suddenly see a fortress-like building. Manifesto, small fortress. And all kinds of activities in\nfront around six -- 6:30 in the morning on the 18\", right? And Waffen -- and SS guards coming\nout and prisoners -- and prisoner of war coming out. I think all of them, with the Jewish and --\nyou see, and then we said to ourself, what\u2019s that? And then Viel, who was our commanding\nofficer, concentration camp Theresienstadt, our duty is to supervise 1500 to 2,000 inmates\ndigging an anti-tank ditch, which the high command thought would have to be dug to hold back\nthe Soviet tanks from a breakthrough. Suddenly, two things realized upon us. Number one, we\nhad to supervise prisoners, which is not what officers are trained to do. Officer training is to\nbecome officers to fight the commies. Not being [indecipherable] you looked at those people\nthey were ragged, they were kind of -- th-th-th--their -- their -- their -- to -- clothing was kind of\nall torn up, they were starving looking, they were t-totally inwarded looking. They were kind --\nbarely able to walk. And we were -- forgive me for saying that -- we were representatives of a\nmighty ideology, right, fighting the communists and that, we should be on the front. And serious\nquestions were raised, but you were given the command, so they were coming out, 1500 to 2,000\nof them and we were si -- surrounded and marched with them where the commanding officer was\n-- told him to march. Concentration camp, for the first time. And only then did we know that\nthere were actually two concentration camps, Theresienstadt, the model camp, which the\nGermans were showing off to the Red Cross volunteers.",
        "Q: But that\u2019s only for a few days.",
        "A: And the smaller --",
        "Q: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s only a model for a few days.",
        "A: Well -- well --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- get technical now. All I remember is that I had read a book by a guy name of Adler, who\nwas in Theresienstadt, who was able to survive that, who wrote a couple of chapters in the book,\n\u201cTheresienstadt\u201d --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- areference to the Red Cross commissioners being told and being displayed the Jewish\npeople happy like a lark. And -- but we didn\u2019t know about that. But what we did know is that\nthere was the Theresienstadt with about 10 to 15 thousand persons and the kleine feste with two\nto 2,000 to 2,500. And the kleine feste, one rumor had it, were destined to be exterminated, but\nthey also contained non-Jewish people. Some Soviet prisoner of war who had gotten -- got even\nsome Britishers, I also understand even an Australian was locked up in the kleine feste. Anyway,\nit was the killing grounds, and it is those people that we are to supervise. So we did. On the first\nday nothing untoward happened. They had equipment, it is not true that they did it with their\nhands and -- and then [indecipherable] had the appropriate shovels and that, but we were spaced\nevery 20 meters on both sides of the ditch, get -- becoming deeper and deeper. But on the second\nday we were brought back and that\u2019s at -- now, lunch at two o\u2019clock, Viel suddenly started\nshooting, where I was standing.",
        "Q: Viel started shooting. Did y --",
        "A: Ah, yeah. We were -- we had talked about the service [indecipherable] guard service, and\nvery, very unhappy because some of the soldiers claimed they had gotten medals of heroism\nfighting the commies and that and suddenly they\u2019re only prison guards. It was not compatible\nwhich wa -- what we thought was the eth -- ethics of the international recognized ethical form of\nbehavioral officers. But we didn\u2019t ask any questions. The questions would be asked on the\nfollowing day in the evening when, after having witnessed and/or heard the killing and pointed at\nViel through the testimony of at least two of us, we decided getting back to Leitmeritz, to the\nhigh school for girls where we were stationed with the preliminary station of the officers\u2019 school,\nwhen we decided to send a delegation to the commanding officer, and not demanding, asking for\nan explanation.",
        "Q: We have to stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: So in the training, you know --",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: -- th-the cadet stage of officer training, we had weapons training, specialized weapons, the\nnew Sturmgewehr, which is the assault weapons, I\u2019ve mentioned them to you. And -- but we\neach had to learn how to. We had training with bazookas because the Soviets had been breaking\nthrough, the tanks -- we didn\u2019t have me -- Germans didn\u2019t have enough tanks left. And since they\nhad broken through the Carpathians the bazookas were our last means of defense and the\nbazookas were the long, long pipes, as well as the Panzerfausts, we learned that. And we were\nalso being taught officers\u2019 strategy in military tactics at the lowest possible level. That is, we\nwere being elevated to recognizing that being a soldier is not quite like being an officer. An\nofficer has to provide leadership. We\u2019ve given -- we were given ideological education, not any\nmore Nazi ideology, but repeatedly they emphasized respect for international law, respect for\nwarli -- war making practices, respect for war cri -- no, disrespect for war criminality. We were\ntold that an officer\u2019s duty is to prevent war criminal act from happening, right, and an officer will\neventually get married and become a noble representative of a new Germany, no more Nazi\nGermany, right?",
        "Q: This is -- the is the -- this is the late training?",
        "A: All that in the perio -- yeah, in the prem -- between January and end of March 1945.",
        "Q: \u00b045, right.",
        "A: And this they say. And we also had, because we were being trained to become eventually,\nmembers of the officers\u2019 school for signals officers, we were being given technical education.\nWe had to bypass some very serious technical questions concerning telecommunications,\ncommunications and radio wireless equipment, right? And that\u2019s where mathematics came in,\nright?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I was able to handle that, right? Not because of Nazism, it was strictly a profession, right?\nSo -- and all that within the context of most of us having been happy not to be on the front any\nmore, but having higher chances of survival, as was indicated by the dislodging of certain other\nofficers\u2019 school to safer and safer areas, right? So we were all trying to hang on, I was trying to\nhang on, I didn\u2019t want to fail and be sent back, which happened to several of us, right? In the --\nWalter Meyhollowicz failed. He couldn\u2019t handle it any more because I think he was so big he\nwould have needed 300 orders of potatoes, he was starving. So he failed the exam, was sent\naway to the front, the Soviets captured him. He spent 10 years as a prisoner of war in the Soviet\nUnion, and somehow managed surviving, can you imagine that? Anyway, so -- and then\nsuddenly we found ourselves on the second day witnessing a plain act of murder. We got\ntogether -- sh-sh-sh -- in the evening, and --",
        "Q: So it\u2019s -- re -- re-explain that time. You\u2019re standing on the side of those --",
        "A: I-PIl -- 1\u2019ll come back --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- to -- one minute, Joan, let me just finish this.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, and Barouka Kuno, a fair minded soldier, he was not a Nazi, he was from the tri -- he was\na Sudetendeutsche.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He was one of the three who was sent to present his petition to the commanding officer of the\nschool, and we\u2019d get the answer two days later. Now, I'll stop here, P\u2019Il go back. Okay, so on the\nsecond day we went back, we were brought by white truck. A number of prisoners, we didn\u2019t\ncount them, I estimate between 1500 to 2,000. At the same time the ti -- the ditch was supposed\nto be two kilometers long. Now, two kilometers long is 2,000 meters. If you have 2,000 prisoners\nhalf starving, how can they possibly dig with just to shovel one meters worth of 20 meters across\nand up to two meters deep? So something -- my numbers may not be correct, or maybe the\nGermans were thinking that these guys were ready to work their butts off, hoping to survive.\nAnyway, SO we were again posted every 20 meters. I was on the right hand side, another guy was\non the left hand side [indecipherable] both sides, and we had the weapons in our hands, and just\nwatching them. Now, I was very close to a group of seven, and one of the seven -- like, they\nwere a bit separate from the others, and the ditch was maybe about a meter deep, something like\nthat, but unequally so. And the officer group was standing a bit higher up, about 20 meters away,\nwith Viel among them, including the commanding officer of the school, and they were kind of\nchatting and looking and chatting and I was standing. I had to look this way, not that way,\nbecause once you\u2019re told where to guard your post you couldn\u2019t move even a foot of that. And if\nyou had to make a pee you have to ask for permission to leave or to turn around. And suddenly I\n-- I noticed that big, big guy with a big dark red beard, and just urging the others on to work, to\nwork, to work. And one of the guys was -- the first one who got killed was a tiny little guy,\nalmost no face left, like blue eyes, a little sparse hair, no chest, barely moving, t-tiny, maybe\naround 50-ish. And suddenly, I look -- I look at that, I hear something, there is Viel. Oh, we had\nput our weapons away for lunch, then we got our weapons back, but there were still some\npyramids there because lunches were taken in sequence. So Viel goes to a pyramid, grabs a rifle,\nand there could be more than three, could be four or five. So one of the witnesses said oh, when\nyou grab a rifle of the three, the others four fall down. He took one of the four or five, stood up\nstraight, aimed that and I said to myself, what -- wh -- I didn\u2019t know the word what the hell is\nhappening, excuse me, what\u2019s happening. And I said, well maybe he\u2019s just limbering up or\nsomething. It was a muddy day for -- you know, springtime, mud in the river -- gri -- ditch.\nRaises the weapon and aims towards me. I didn\u2019t even duck because I said, what will -- and\nsuddenly, he aims -- it doesn\u2019t take long to aim. And so I hear the shot and the little guy just falls\ndown. Didn\u2019t even just hear the pop, falls down. He kind of fell down forward, and the military\nlaw is, if you hit the chest or the heart, you always fall forward, you never fall backward. Okay,\nso second shot, second guy falls down. And then a third shot, the big guy. And the big guy had\nstood up straight and he was looking at the officer, and the officer was looking at him. The big\nguy had the shovel, the officer had the gun. So the officer pulled the trigger, hits the big guy, the\nbig guy falls down, stands up, raises his hand. Viel aims, shoots the second time, the big guy\nfalls down. Stands up -- no more raised arm, stands up, still keeps on staring at Viel. Big guy.\nLegs like that. He must have been a capo because he looked better fed than the other guys. Viel,\nthird time, plomp. Was in the face, whatever, fall down in the mud. Three shots, plus two shots,\nfive shots, three dead guys. Foosh. Five shots. Carbine is not empty yet. Keeps on shooting, all\nthe seven guys dead. He missed one shot, right? Puts the gun back, the carbine, goes back to the\n[indecipherable]. The officers had looked, turned around, joined the group, continued the\ndiscussion. Seven dead guys. A little while later, I\u2019m standing there, I\u2019m looking at the\n[indecipherable] I\u2019m looking at the guy behind me, in front of me [indecipherable] the thing.\nWhat the -- what -- what happened? What happened? Deep inside myself I was like a stone.\nUnable to bel -- unable to think. Wha -- I thought I\u2019d a -- I had an active mind, my mind never\nfalls asleep. I just -- petrified. I had never seen a dead Jew in my life. Suddenly I see seven dead\nJew -- I never wanted to see a dead Jew. That\u2019s not why I was in war. All I was in war, to keep\nthe commies off central Europe. Some of the commies were Jewish commissars. There was, as\nyou well know, Hitler\u2019s personal command to kill the Jewish commissars, right? Never seen one,\nalive or dead. There were seven Jews. Say nothing, continue my guard duty. Didn\u2019t di -- don\u2019t\nstep off the thing, cause you\u2019re not allowed. But -- I hear a noise. A two wheeler. A death cart.\nTypical of concentration camps, I found later on. Okay? Four guys were pushing, prisoners,\nJewish, death guard -- 1t s-seemed like standard procedure. They\u2019d appeared from the nowhere,\nthey were coming closer and closer, nobody touched them, nobody told them anything. Came to\nthe ditch -- went to the ditch, put the cart -- I think they even got it somehow into the ditch and\ngrabbed the little guy who had died first, no problem, two guys lift him up, bango on the\n[indecipherable]. Grabbed the second guy -- they needed all four of them to lift up the heavy\nguy. They had problems lifting up the heavy guy, so finally the [indecipherable] got him and the\none, two three, all seven, turned the cart around, marched away. Death cart. Standard instrument\nof picking up the dead during the Nazi regime. Now, not even the commies in the Spanish Civil\nWar were doing things like that.",
        "Q: Were there --",
        "A: So, we were officer candidates. We had been told repeatedly, abide by international law\nconcerning warfare, abide by this, abide by that. The rules -- an officer\u2019s thing is to prevent\nthings like that happening. My own leader of inspection did the killing. And it was my own, I\nwas part of the officers\u2019 school.",
        "Q: So he was training you?",
        "A: Why did he do it?",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Was he a German German? Was he a Nazi German? Had he lost his mind? Or, my\n[indecipherable] finale -- my latest conclusion; he had been so brainwashed by his own system\nthat we [indecipherable] because he had been made officer in the Dachau camp in 1938 -- he had\nbeen so brainwashed to have believed, like many Nazis, they had become master of life or death\nof the untermensche, and that he was responsible to no one. And the tragedy over that is\nevidently the tragedy of seven dead Jewish people, innocent as they were, especially, but tragedy\nthat nobody brought it to trial. Two days later, the officer of commanding school said, what has\nhappened, has happened. If you survive the war, if you win the war, we are not accountable. If\nyou lose the war, you\u2019re going to be dead anyway. So you got away scot-free. And we in our\ndeep ourselves, including Barouka, who claimed in Ravensburg that he had been in the hospital,\nhe had never been there, and the judge accused him -- accused him of lying directly into the face\nof modern German democratic law, right? Even Barouka said it was wrong, what had happened.",
        "Q: Who was Barouka?",
        "A: This is no -- Barouka Kuno, one of the witnesses --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- who was quite close to me. He was a decent guy. I was counting on him to back me up.\nSuddenly he looks at me, he says, Lallier, you were a traitor. This never happened. So -- so, we\nwent through the last four weeks of the war, totally, totally having -- I had totally lost belief in\nany trace of humanity on the part of the Germans. So just look at the sequence. Hanging all those\nSerbs. Massacring the partisan women. There was one more [indecipherable] massacring the\npartisan women. Anyway, I\u2019Il -- Pll become -- come to they murdered -- killing -- oh, t-talking\nabout human rights and that. And that -- oh yes, killing all kinds of partisan, burning the villages,\nand then seeing this guy killing seven unarmed, half starved people in their tattered rags, could\nonly have meant that the guy had suffered dementia, which is legally excusable, they put a guy\nlike that in a nuthouse, right? Or the ultimate evil condition of believing that his destiny was to\nbe the ultimate judge over the life or death of people, especially [indecipherable] defenseless\npeople. So he, to me -- Viel was the -- remains the ultimate example of the evil that the Nazi\nsystem can inculcate in human minds, making them believe at the individual level that not only\nAdolf, but they as their emissaries had the right to kill on sight, without being accountable to\nanybody. Now, counter argument, as I learned from the critics at Ravensburg, a Waffen SS\nofficer will never do a killing like that unless he\u2019s ordered to.",
        "Q: Who said that?",
        "A: The defense lawyer. Now, he raised the question that was Viel ordered by the superior\nofficers in -- still living in Prague to do the killing to find out how the cadets would react. Would\nthey react like true Nazis and clap? Or would those be weeded out who may have negative\ninclinations. Because the SS officer corps will need to have undoubtedly component members\nwho are ultimate Nazis to whom what Hitler says is the absolute right. I have no answer to that\nbecause the commanding officer eventually lost his life, the last day of the war in Prague, but the\nquestion was raised at the court, you see?",
        "Q: Well, let me ask you something.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Either way, whether Viel did it on his own, or he did it because he was ordered, does it really\nmake a difference?",
        "A: Yes. yes.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Because in all armies, if the order is given, you have no choice but to do it.",
        "Q: Do you have --",
        "A: Including the American Army.",
        "Q: Do you have a choice if you think it\u2019s a war -- if it\u2019s a war crime?",
        "A: Please look at Vietnam.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t want to look at Vietnam --",
        "A: I want to look at Vietnam.",
        "Q: -- I\u2019m looking at this, I\u2019m looking at what constitutes --",
        "A: I would say that in the German order --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- of military conduct, and war conduct, the order has to come from a superior officer, period.",
        "Q: But you were -- you said you were -- you were -- been trained -- you were --",
        "A: We were questioning --",
        "Q: No, no, no --",
        "A: We were -- I say, there were two choices.",

        "A: A war crime?",
        "Q: -- wh-what were you car -- what were you trained is a war crime?",
        "A: War crime is what Viel did to those seven Jews, that\u2019s a war crime.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I can\u2019t give you a purer, clearer --",
        "Q: No, I understand that.",
        "A: -- definition of war crime.",
        "Q: But you were also just being taught. You were going to cadet school from January -- from\nMar -- what is it, March 19?",
        "A: That\u2019s a -- from Jan -- end of January to mid-March.",
        "Q: March of 1945.",
        "A: That war crimes -- an office -- an officer\u2019s duty, to prevent --",
        "Q: Prevent any war s --",
        "A: -- any [indecipherable] from committing a war crime.",
        "Q: Right. So isn\u2019t he committing a war crime?",
        "A: He, in our eyes was committing what we would today call a war crime.",
        "Q: But wouldn\u2019t you have called that --",
        "A: At that time I called 1t murder.",
        "Q: Wa -- but still, it\u2019s the same.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: It\u2019s the same, a war crime is a murder, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Well, no.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No. A -- a war crime is a murder in a situation in which a war is properly conducted 1n the\nJudeo-Christian interpretation, according to the laws of Judeo-Christianity, in which you kind of\ngo contrary to the laws and do the killing, even though the war crime legal setting would not\nallow you to, or not order you to.",
        "Q: Well, let me have th -- let me ask s -- to you in another way. Did you now begin to believe\nthat what the Nazis were doing, or the Germans were doing under the Nazi regime was\ncommitting war crimes wholesale?",
        "A: Well that, yes.",
        "Q: Is that what you finally believed?",
        "A: It was a wholesale -- I was going to conclude that particular example, and the hangings in\nYugoslavia, and that partisan little woman, and the others who were -- oh yeah, the hero, my\nlittle Serbian hero, were an expression of the endemic attitude of the German Nazis to kill on\nsight without any feelings of accountability.",
        "Q: And is that what you finally believed [indecipherable]",
        "A: And -- and that\u2019s what I finally believe and that is why I have difficulties with the modern\nGerman system, because at court most of them doubted my honesty of the testimony. Most of\nthem called me a traitor. Now, what is that an indication of?",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s --",
        "A: They\u2019re trying to white -- they were trying to whitewash poor Viel.",
        "Q: Well let me -- okay, let me ask you this. You -- when you were captured, right, at the end of\nthe war.",
        "A: Yeah. By the Brits.",
        "Q: By the Brits.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You told an office --",
        "A: I -- I prudently arranged to be captured by the Brits.",
        "Q: By the -- I -- oh, really?",
        "A: Because they were closest to my home.",
        "Q: I see, right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right. Okay. So you\u2019re captured by the Brits, and you tell some officer --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- British officer, I gather?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What you saw.",
        "A: Yeah. Not only him.",
        "Q: Not only him.",
        "A: Also to the -- to the s -- C.I.C. guy Brown, Major Brown [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Who was an American.",
        "A: -- and also to the -- to general -- two star American General Wood at the UNRRA in Vienna,\nand also to my personal self-appointed confessor, the abbot of the Benedictine monastery, yeah.",
        "Q: All right, so you -- you tell four or five people. It\u2019s a number of people.",
        "A: I told one, two, three, four people, yeah.",

        "A: -- I was waiter. The first one, the -- the Brit was in the summer 1945, I was 20 plus three\nmonths.",
        "Q: Right. Okay.",
        "A: And by that time I had confirmed my first feeling that I experienced while I was looking at\nthe killing.",
        "Q: Which was?",
        "A: That it was wrong.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Now, wrong means, in the strict sense of definitions, war crime.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: No, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.",
        "A: Because we now have to have full understanding --",
        "Q: Right, I --",
        "A: -- that the Germans suffered under Hitler, right?",
        "Q: No, no, because --",
        "A: They were the major people suffered under Hitler, right?",
        "Q: No, that\u2019s now why. It\u2019s --",

        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: You can\u2019t do that. So, when did you find out, between 1945 and by the time you leave Europe\nin 1951, when do you find out --",
        "A: Yeah, October 1951.",
        "Q: Right, when do you find out about the gassings?",
        "A: The gassing?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Why are we suddenly stopping the war crimes?",
        "Q: No, no, I\u2019m going to go back to the war crimes. First I want to know -- I want --",
        "A: You will? You promise?",
        "Q: Yes, I promise you. I want to get some sense of --",
        "A: Very -- I was working -- I was working, I didn\u2019t know about the gassing until I finally got\nhold of the Vienna [indecipherable] in which 1940 -- when was the Vienna [indecipherable]? I\nwas in a POW -- no, actually, I found out in the pre -- British POW camp, in the course of the\nwinter 1945. There was a Jewish guy who had worn a British uniform, who went around -- it was\nan officers\u2019 camp, actually.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm.",
        "A: Went around in Graz, Wetzelsberg, okay? And I wa -- have to tell you about that too. Very\nclose to Tito Yugoslavia and very close to the Brits being terribly worried that Tito is -- will o-\noccupy that part of Austria and declare them Europea -- the Yugoslav sovereign territory\ncommunist, and the Brits didn\u2019t want any of that. So what did they do? They fed us -- made us\ndo all kinds of military and non-military exercises, even told us -- not me specifically, there were\nsenior officers that they\u2019d have to keep us physically ready to once again take up fighting against\nthe Tito, and brother did we ever hate Tito. Giving us the weapons to get Tito\u2019s attempts to come\nto the north and push him all the way back. So we had a pretty good time learning English at the\nsame time. And I say those British officers were wise officers, and the one who went around\nasking was a Jewish Austrian who went around wanting to know if any of us had been to a\nconcentration camp, and if anyone\u2019s of -- of -- had ever seen people, Jewish people being gassed.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Now, I don\u2019t know what the others told them, but I could only tell him that I myself never did\nsee because I was never close enough in the Polish area where those things were happening.",
        "Q: But that was new for you to hear.",
        "A: Yes, that was news to me to hear and it only confirmed -- the term endemic is very late in my\nlife.",
        "Q: I understand.",
        "A: But I would now say it only confirmed what I was getting the impression then, Nazi Germany\nwas about. The absolute right to kill or gas, without accou -- without accountability.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- did you ask about the killing?",
        "A: No, I went back with -- I went back on the following day, requisitioning a bicycle from a\npublic stand off the main church in Leitmeritz with another cadet offi -- cadet 0 -- candidate by\nthe name of Schultz, Sep Schultz, a real Nazi-like Volksdeutsche, to go back and find out if it\u2019s\nreally true what happened, right? And we went into the klanifesto, into the small fortress to ask\nsome questions, and we were allowed to go in because we were fully uniformed, right? So we\nwent around and we came across a couple of subalterns who looked at us like as equal because\nwe were not yet officers and who showed us, well this is the wall against which the shooting is\ndone. That is the wall in which [indecipherable] and the wall against which some of the hanging\nis done. This is where some of them perished trying to jump across the fence. And we discovered\nthat it really was an extermination camp. But we never went to higher command, because given\nour lower -- lower rank, we were just happy to have been tolerated in there asking a few\nquestions. And we decided that -- we didn\u2019t just quietly disappear, but it strengthened our resolve\nin waiting for the answer by the commander of the school, right, to really find out what we got to\nbe involved in against our -- our perception that officer candidates don\u2019t do things like that, are\nnot ordered to do things like that. Now, the second question is, why would we have been sent\nthere in the first place? There were other military uniform -- military units in the area. And I\u2019m\ncoming back to the main thesis. I think I\u2019m right in presuming that the real Nazis in the Waffen\nSS command wanted to give a last minute test to our affiliation with Nazism as an ideology.\nThey wanted to find out which of us would continue falling into step and which of us could be\nconsidered untrusty and maybe put up against the wall. And you know what, given the devilnish\n-- devilish -- devilness of the system, it\u2019s a plausible intellectual question.",
        "Q: Is there -- is there a problem? Wait one second. [interruption] So you\u2019re asking the quest --",
        "A: So the second interesting question is, was it possibly aimed at testing the cadets for their\nallegiance to Nazism, separating those who continue believing in Hitler\u2019s absolute ideas about\nthe right to kill from those who would have had some doubts. And hoping to sort out those who\nwould have some doubts.",

I found it very funny\nfor guys to be wearing skirts, you know, but I liked them, I liked them. Gave me a chance to\nlearn English as fast as possible. And he says, I have a job to do. Don\u2019t ask me, don\u2019t bother me,\ndon\u2019t bother -- he said, bother, he said [indecipherable]. So I said, but sir, you know -- said, oh,\nno, no, no. [indecipherable] said, okay, Ill report it. Remember [indecipherable]. Major Brown,\nC.I.C, Bamberg, 1946, October, November. They send me back to Bamberg because I had\nbecome homeless. I had lost my Austrian citizenship because I hadn\u2019t been born in Austria,\nright?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

But they sent me to Bamberg because as a so-called Volksdeutsche, they couldn\u2019t\nsend me back to Yugoslavia. I wouldn\u2019t have gone back to Yugoslavia, right. So I went back to -\n- | went up to Bamberg against my will and a year later I couldn\u2019t stand it any more, I went down\nto Vienna, crossing the border illegally and that was that. Oh, I even wrote a letter to the\nAustrian president saying that as a former Austrian, I beg your pardon, but I do wish to live in\nAustria. Could you please accommodate me with a permission to cross the boundary illegally?\nAnd would you believe it, I got a letter from President\u2019s of Austria office saying Lallier, you are\nwelcome because so many of you young ones died, we badly need replacements. Never asked\nany questions, right? Anyway, so in Bamberg I had to report to the C.I.C as per my release, I\nhave to be entrusted to American or British authority for reeducation. Cause they must have\nrecognized that I had a brain that might be potentially useful for reexamination. So that\n[indecipherable] me, you see?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I went to Brown and Brown turned out to be a German emigrant. Spoke fluent German, oh\nhe spoke such a beautiful Rhineland German, it was a pleasure to talk to the guy. And o-over the\ncourse of time -- met him quite a few times -- the Germans gave me no job because I had been in\nthe Waffen SS [indecipherable]. Suddenly they said well, SS [indecipherable] welcome. I have to\nwait until the [indecipherable] which I got in [indecipherable] not from my father. And -- so\nthere was no inside work on that. And so eventually we talked about the -- America. I took to the\nguy, he was very intelligent. I liked his ways and he was so leisurely. He was so different, not\n[indecipherable] officer German, I -- Major, I said wow, Major is staff officer. You know, we are\n[indecipherable]. And he liked me, he said Lallier, you are -- in German [speaks German] I can\nreeducate you, do you like America? I said, I know nothing. I know a bit about the British, but I\ndid see American soldiers and officers lie on their stomach playing dice. He says, oh yeah, we\nlove doing that. Would you like to do that? It was a sale, right? He said then, a little while later,\nand would you like to work for us? And I said, yes please, I need job. I need job badly. So he\ngave me a job as a stoveman in an American infantry company stationed in Bamberg. And\nstoveman was the most dangerous job in the army because they used gasoline stoves and every\nthird of them was expected to explode into the stovemen\u2019s faces, right? And I said, stoveman?\nSounds good to me. All the food you can eat, he said. So I got the job as a stoveman. I did a very\ngood job. Not even one stove exploded while I was working in Bamberg for nine months. And\nhe was pleased, he says, you seem highly useful, your English is getting better, your German and\nother languages, how about working for us? I said, doing what? He says, well, certain things we\nlike to find out. You were in the Waffen SS for instance. What if we sent you to Switzerland to\nexplore the escape routes of some higher SS officials through Switzerland to Latin America. And\nI\u2019m a humble guy, I [indecipherable] thinking of generals and colonels and all this. I said, why\nshould I do that? He said, because you seem like a guy who can cross boundaries and fact find\nwithout being caught, and -- would you like to do that? I said, well, why not? Where should I go?\nHe said, well, go to Switzerland, try to get across the border. Make sure that they don\u2019t catch you\nbecause the Swiss will put you in jail for being Waffen SS [indecipherable] and Ill give you 200\nAmerican dollars. And try to fact find in the Basel area if there may have been someone on the\nstreets, through which some of these Waffen S -- these SS [indecipherable] he emphasized\nstrongly, seem to have go -- escaped and then to Latin America. So, he said, I\u2019ll give you two\nweeks to find out and report back to me. And I -- I found it very amusing, here I am a nobody --\noh, and he said, and if you do a good job on the other assignments, I'll try to get you a visa to\nemigrate to the United States.

I don\u2019t want to stay here, I want to go\nback home. I can\u2019t go back home, cause Tito is still there. I want to go back to Austria to study,\nbut I need your help, I said. And I also need to talk to you about something that had happened.\nAnd this was -- by that time it was June -- no, March 19 -- oh, February 1948. So I had been with\nthe [indecipherable] often working in that American company [indecipherable] company. And by\nthe time he had told me about the American presidency, election for demo -- oh, I loved it, I just\nswallowed America wholesale. And he was delighted. And I said, look, I\u2019ve to tell you about the\nthing that had happened. In \u201948, the Czech Republic was falling to communist hands. Hungary\nhad fallen into communist hands so the threat was evidently the thing that we had tried to fight\nagainst. Soviet Union expanded and become reality. And [indecipherable] look, the Soviets are\nexpanding, I\u2019m feeling terrible, I\u2019ve lost my home, I don\u2019t want to go to America, what do I do?\nAnd I said, what do I do especially? I have to confess to you that I had witnessed that murder.\nWhat murder? In the Panzergraben. Oh, you witnessed a murder in the Panzergraben. I said yes.\nWell, who? I said -- I gave him the story exactly, the big body guy, Viel and all that. He looks at\nme and says, I believe you. And I said, you better believe me because I don\u2019t believe it was right\nand I\u2019ve got to clear my conscience because I believe it was wrong and I believe the guy should\nbe apprehended, and I named the name. He sits back and says, Lallier. Lally. The Cold War is\non. I am glad that you are saying that because I can -- I\u2019m counting on you. We need guys like\nyou cause you never know about the Cold War. And he says, our policy is to report these things\nabout what the Nazi had done, to higher levels. My job here is to reeducate you, and talking to\nyou to pass on any useful information about you to the higher ups. I will report what you have\njust said, but there is nothing more that I can do about that because I am not a war crime\ndiscrimination -- I am not a war crime investigator. So what -- I left it in his hands. In March\n1948, I crossed the boundary, went to Vienna, found a little job, found my little eventual wife\nand decided that I would approach -- I\u2019d heard from friends about the United Nations refugee\norganization in Vienna. I went there in person [indecipherable] I remember. And I learned that\nthe commanding officer was a general, two star general by the name of Wood.

And I\nsaid, please, I speak languages, please, I know many refugees, please, I know many Jewish\nrefugees, please, I want to talk General Wood. And would you believe it? General Wood\nreceived me. There was another proof that the American system will have even generals lying on\ntheir bellies, playing the dice, hoping to win. So with me, play the dice.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I went to General Wood\u2019s office, bowed to him, no [indecipherable] any more, right, bow to\nhim. Adalbert Lallier, looking for a job. He says, what languages? I said Hungarian. Good. I\nsaid, Serbo-Croatia. Good. I said, little Czech. Oh, he says, very good. We can use you. English,\nhe listened to me, he said, you learn fast. I said, also French. He says, oh Monsieur Delong will\nbe your boss. He\u2019ll love you. Right? But he said, right now I cannot take you because I need to\nfind out who you are. So, I said please, please, I need job badly. Anything is better than cleaning\nStoves.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Two days later I pass by, I am invited back to General Wood\u2019s office, he says, I just got a\nclearance from the C.I.C. Bamberg. A guy by the name of Brown, he says. Not his real name. I\nsaid, I know. He said I should give you any job. He said Lallier can handle any job, you can trust\nhim. Right? So he gave me a job, two weeks as a volunteer without pay to clean up all their\nbackward records on all immigrants through the Vienna refugee center for the past two years.\nAnd he said, unless you can do it in two weeks, I won\u2019t take you. I can tell you one thing, in my\nlife, it was not only the Jewish dimension, because by that time I had talked to [indecipherable]\ncause I was hanging around waiting for the job, th-the ones with the beards, ones with the smile,\nones who pretended they were -- had been jewelers in Budapest, most of them Hungarians,\nbecause they were escaping en masse. And so I had heard of the fortunes and misfortunes and I\ndecided Lallier, God has sent you, God. There were times and still are believes --\n[indecipherable] in which I believe God 1s, period. Okay? God wants me here. So I worked for\ntwo weeks without sleeping an hour and got himself a filing system from the AA to the ZZ in all\ncountries, including the American emigration part, not just the Canadian part. Oh, he was so\nimpressed, he said, I\u2019ll give you a back pay for two weeks in Austrian shillings. I think he gave\nme a thousand shillings for two weeks. And he says, I appoint you as of immediately, chief of\nthe Canadian desk. And I never asked him, as a Canadian should, what business have you as an\nAmerican to appoint me to the Canadian desk? I was so happy. I had my own second, even\nbrought her a picture, I think, Mrs. -- Madame Friedman, oh, if I had -- hadn\u2019t met my wife,\nMadame Friedman would have been a great substitute. Never had anything with her, though, she\nwas young married too. Anyway, so I got my secretary and in no time I was wielding all my\nlanguages.",

They were a St. Laurent, who happened to be a then nephew\nof Canada\u2019s Prime Minister then, and a Mr. Klassen from Toronto.

I -- I had an Austrian identity card, so I had no problem crossing the\nSoviet demarcation line, which was very, very, very tough, and often had to ferry the refugees\nillegally, giving them false identification papers. Most of them turned out to be Hungarian\nJewish. Some je -- Czech Jewish, a very few Yugoslav Jewish. I [indecipherable] about 300 of\nthem. And often the Jewish people were, as you would expect, jewelers, merchants, silk\nproducers, merchant general, one banker. None of them agriculture, none of the textile laborers,\nbut owners of textile mills.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

Unfortunately at the same time, and it is not very well known,\nthey were also lifting the total restrictions on members, former members of the German armed\nforces, including the Waffen SS.",
        "Q: The Canadians were.",
        "A: Canadians and the Americans.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Into Canada alone, more than 2500 former Waffen SS members of the Ukrainian division\nwere transported over by special agreement with the Brits, who had captured them and kept in\nBritain, not knowing what to do with them because the Soviets had shot everybody else upon\nbeing returned, you see, so with special agreement, Jewish people were being let in, but the\nNazis were also being let in, or the presumed Nazis, right? Including some of whom, from the\nreal eastern Europe, who had turned out to have been members without saying so, right, of some\nconcentration camp and Einsatz commandos, right? So I\u2019m looking at that parallel, wondering\nabout the Canadian approaches between 1947 and 1949. Was it just to get as many bodies as\npossible to replace the lost bodies during the war, right? And kind of wanting to be equal. So\nmany Jewish people, so many non-Jew, I don\u2019t know, but the fact is that I did tell the Canadian\nconsuls upon several visits who I was because they had to look at my background to find me\ntrustworthy, right? They knew about the incident about the killing and they thought I was okay, I\nwas doing a good job and eventually they told me, quite soon, Lallier, you too will have to come\nto Canada, we need guys like you.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Your wife is -- you\u2019re married -- you\u2019re already -- your wife is pregnant. So we look at the\npast, we know you have committed nothing wrong. Come on over as soon as you can. And the\n[indecipherable] to Vienna was being abolished at the end of 1951, so I decided in October 1951\nto come over here after getting the -- I had my big row with my father about that, right? He didn't\nwant me to go. So I went anyway. So I came over on the second of October 1951, after having\nfalsified or not falsified -- hundreds of doc -- immigration documents, and brought personally\nquite a few of them across the Soviet demarcation line, often at the threat of being captured by\nthe Soviets. But I knew my way around the bridge baca -- you know, the Linz bridge was the key\nthing. You could only ferret people over without proper identification during the lunch hour,\nbecause on the east side of Linz was a big steel factory which the cho -- Soviets had reopened\nright? And during the lunch hour, because feeding was poor on the east Soviet side, thousands of\nworkers crossed the bridge and went to the western side where the food was much better,\nAmerican zone. So it is there that I ferreted out many, including Mr. Goldstein and Mr.\nGoldsmith, who had been a very preeminent jeweler in -- 1n Budapest and who eventually got to\nMontreal and opened up the -- the coffee shop, which had become very famous as a little coffee\nshop, on Drummond Street. Anyway, so they wanted me and the Americans, in the meantime,\ndidn\u2019t let me loose. The general said, Mr. Lallier, I understand you also work under special\nconditions and special cases. I says, well what do you have to offer? By that time I had my baby,\nyou see, my daughter.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And he says, well, there 1s a guy in Czechoslovakia by the name of Ruberchinsky. He is a\nchief expert on tensile wires. I had no idea what tensile wires were. Now I know. Those are\nwires, stretched wires that use as guidelines for precision shooting long distance cannons. The\nAmericans has no experts like that. Ruberchinsky they -- absolutely they needed to get away\nfrom these Sovietized Czechs, who wanted absolutely to keep him there for the Soviet Union. He\nsays, if you ferret Ruberchinsky t -- out to the west and into our safe hands, to the ameri --\nAmerican zone in Vienna, I guarantee you an immigration visa for the United States as a refugee.\nAnd boy was that ever a challenge. I knew the boundary area, I knew some peasants. Peasants\nare good to know. I know that from my boy -- life as a child, you see. And I knew -- had some\ncontacts on the Czech side of the boundary. By that time it had become communist, you see, this\nwas, my God, early 1951, and they needed Ruberchinsky and I got Ruberchinsky through\ncontacts and I arranged Ruberchinsky to be brought by lorry and then by oxcart to the boundary\nand then [indecipherable] I crossed the boundary into a quick Austrian ready available cab. We\nwent to Vienna, I deposited him in the office of General Wood and he almost fell over. And I\nhad for -- had phoned the Canadian consulate and said, I have a guy here from the Czech\nRepublic -- from Czechoslovakia who is a tensile experts, wouldn\u2019t Canada use them? And they\nsaid, we want them. So there was a tug of war between --",
        "Q: Between the two.",
        "A: -- the American and the -- and the American offered him a huge factory, right, already made,\nright to take over. And then I asked -- so Ruberchinsky got his American visa 1n no time, and\nGeneral Wood looked at me and said, you know, Lallier, I know about your past, but you really,\nreally have done a good job of getting yourself reeducated, right? You know, I\u2019m really happy\nabout that. I\u2019m really happy about that. Anyway, so Ruberchinsky went to the United States and\nI decided I would come to Canada because -- I\u2019Il be honest about that, some of the American\npresence had become so militaristic that I got to be concerned a bit about the message of true\ndemocracy on the one hand, which I lovingly embraced, and the military regime perpetuating\nitself because of the feeling of universal power. And having experienced the German attempt to\nuniversal military power, I decided I\u2019d had enough of that. No more C.I.C.. I had a couple of\nminor jobs, one of them included somebody else that I had been able to bring through the Soviet\nzone in Vienna across the -- you know Vienna?",
        "Q: A little.",
        "A: Th-The Danube -- the Danube canal is in the middle of the tho -- town --",
        "Q: Mm-hm, right.",
        "A: -- the nine district, right? And I had brought him to the demarcation line and the Soviets had\nsomehow g-gotten hold of that, and the Americans were waiting on this side, so I was able with\nthe American to pull the co guy, with the last bit of our strength across the demarcation line to\nsave him from the west and he was almost -- he almost died with fright because the Soviets were\nhanging onto his legs on the other side. So then I decided I\u2019d had enough. My wife says, look, I\nwant peace and quiet; my daughter had been born. So I came to Canada and -- wanting to study.\nMy credentials were good, my English was much better, my French was okay for Quebec, even\nthough Quebec\u2019s accent is different from the French [indecipherable]. And I was a Protestant, so\nin Quebec I found that Protestants were not really welcome, so I kind of deemphasized that.\nThere was no immigration of French Protestants into Quebec from 1529 to 1929, can you\nimagine that? That\u2019s another thing that I didn\u2019t know about. Anyway, so I found meni -- menial\njobs. I worked in a color dye factory, I worked in a -- in the gold mine. I worked as a shoe\ncleaner, I worked in a -- as a vacuum cleaner salesman. And I worked as a car washer. And let\u2019s\nsee, I worked one more dirty job, in a barrel factory, I was a hole puncher. Concerned, cause I\nhad learned a bit about democracy. I had been told about Jefferson. I had been told about the\nConstitution. I had been told about the duality of Canada, and my mind was so empty. I had\nknown nothing about the systems. That kind of pleased my soul. And I was married, I had\nresponsibility for the family. My wife was a haute couturiere, she had no problem finding a job.\nSo I decided I would work with Steinbergs as a store manager for awhile to get money and go\nback to school. I went to the French university for admission, speaking in European French and\nhaving to answer -- one of the first questions was what religion are you? You are from Europe. I\nsaid well, look, I\u2019m of [indecipherable] origin. He said Protestants study at McGill. We cannot\naccept Protestants. And that was that. So my desire to match my heart with some of the French\nblood rest -- remaining in it, with the French heart of Canadian, didn\u2019t work. I went to McGill\nspeaking colloquial English. Good for selling vacuum cleaners, but not good for studying Burke\nand Hume and Locke. And looked at the guy -- who looked Jewish, you know guys who look\nJewish, who happen to be Jewish, right? You see it on their eyes. I said -- Solean was his name,\nDean Solean, the first Jewish administrator at McGill in 1954. Okay, big, big difference. There\nhad been no Jewish administrators before then, so McGill was kind of opening up. I said please,\nAustria born, speaking all kinds of languages, working for [indecipherable] America, please, I\nwant to finish college. What certification do you have? Well, I ha -- in Vienna I studied two\nyears at the university -- and that\u2019s very impressive. It\u2019s like three years over here. So he looked\nat that, he says, look Lallier, I will accept you for a B.A. in economics and political science, and\nPll put you into honors economics. Oh, I felt so pleased. You know what honors economics is?\nIt\u2019s a special degree, undergrad, leading you direct into graduate school. I phoned my wife and\nsaid, oh my dear, I haven\u2019t even started, but already I have honors.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I said yes, honors, oh wow. He says, but you first must spend another year learning\nEnglish, because if I take you right now you'll fail, and I don\u2019t want you to fail, I see that you\ndon\u2019t want to fail. So I ya -- I said, so what do I do? And there was something that I will never\nforget. Dean Solean looks at me, jee -- Jewish Canadian, free to have the first dean job at McGill,\nin a society in which the Jewish people were not easily accepted. Tells me, you know, Mr.\nLallier, Canada\u2019s a great, free country. Do whatever you want. But come back the first of\nSeptember 1954, I'll take you. And I said, great, free country. Nobody ever in my life had told\nme it\u2019s a great free country, you\u2019re free to what to do. My conversion to democracy and human\nfreedom and individual freedom started blooming, but deep inside, the shame of what I had\nwitnessed never died. So I went to McGill [indecipherable] learning English day and night, I was\nworking 70 words a day, and with that good mind of mine it\u2019s working well, even s-started to\nwrite in, the [indecipherable] professor was very, very, very protective of me and encouraging.\nAnd I landed with a very high quality B honors economics, political science. Wrote out a few\nletters of reco -- of application. Lo and behold Columbia took me without restrictions, but with\nthe restriction to study in the Russian Institute. Why? Lallier, we know that you know languages,\nwe badly need you for your east European languages to be trained as a specialist in Soviet\naffairs, but you have to learn Russian. And I had a Russian teacher at Columbia who was a\nyoung lady refugee from Leningrad. I don\u2019t know how she made it, oh she was so beautiful, I\nwas studying Russian day and night, including some coffee sessions with the young lady, right, I\nremember that. And I felt I was really taking to Russian, everybody was pleased. So I got my\nMaster\u2019s degree in economics in one year, which was unusual. I had my Russian\n[indecipherable] certificate in one additional year, which is unusual. And I was fully qualified for\nmy Ph.D. in economics. All of that in two years. And then I got tired. The United States got the\nwar in the Vietnam. I was suffering under this blatant expression of militarism under false\nphilosophic and moral premises of [indecipherable] theory and all of that stuff, and I\u2019d become a\nperson who had highly admired Jefferson, on the one hand, in spite of his dubious background\nlately, right, but also Locke. I\u2019m a [indecipherable] by conviction. And I decided I would come\nback to Canada, take up a teaching post, fini -- post, fish -- finish my doctorate somewhere along\nthe line, but prefer a country of peace. Even though the country was supplying all the napalm the\n-- America needed to bomb the hell out of Vietnam. So I came back home, came across some of\nmy refugees that I brought here, including the guy who had opened the coffee shop, who gave\nme a permanent table like in Vienna. Adalbert, whenever you come -- in Hungarian -- this is\nyour table, I give you my personal services. And he was very grateful. And some others I kept\ncontact with, who was very grateful, and I had no problem getting my citizenship, even being\ninvited to speak at a citizenship ceremony in both languages -- both official languages, no\nAustrian any more, did that. Recognizing the French Canadian identity, but also the need of\nEnglish Canada to remain strong and united, so they liked that. So that was 1957. I went to the\nUnited States, lived in New York for three years, 1960 to 1963. Had a very good time on\nBroadway, working part time in a -- in a p -- ina -- ina chicken and sparerib store, a Jewish store\non Broadway just off Columbia in which the owner told me, when you sell expensive cheeses,\nalways leave your thumb on the scale. And I told him, I can\u2019t do that. He says, if you want the\njob you\u2019d better do that, but also got a ska -- part-time ta -- I was very good at Columbia,\nactually, had an A average, at the graduate level. And the professor that chaired then said lall --\nLallier, you\u2019re really a very smart kid, he said, even though you\u2019re a bit older than the average\nkid, he says, I recommend you for a teaching job at Brooklyn College. So he got me a Brooklyn\nsummer job [indecipherable] college, 1962 in the summer -- 1961 in the summer. And he said, I\nprefer you to stay in the United States and you don\u2019t need to have your doctorate 1n economics\nbecause with your advanced degrees, graduate degrees 1n international politics, I want you to\nwork for the Rand Corporation. And the Rand Corporation is the air force\u2019s secret service, I wa -\n- didn't want that. And I hope, I beg you to understand why I made up my mind that I would not\ncontinue living in the States. I love America for its ideals, for its honesty, for the greatest of,\nespecially President Roosevelt. Not so much the subsequent ones. And for the liberating me, for\na chance to develop my mind. But I prefer maybe being a small country member, because small\ncountries can always prevent themselves from stepping under the toes. Big countries, by their\nsize alone, cannot do that. I\u2019m a friend of the United States, I am very highly respective of you\nfor giving me the honor of having this discussion and making my confession once again, hoping\nto convince you that when I applied that job -- for that job in General Woods\u2019s office, God had\ngiven me a mandate, and I\u2019m very serious about that, to try to undo, not so much my feelings of\nguilt, cause you can\u2019t do feelings of unguilt if you cannot prevent the killing of innocent people,\nbut trying to do my best to ease the suffering of many of the Jewish refugees, especially those\nfrom Hungary and the Czechia -- and Czechoslovakia. And I think I have been able to follow\nthrough on my mandate in doing that, and thereby easing my pangs of conscience, hoping that\neventually the maker, in the Christian tradition St. Peter, will look at me and say, oh Adalbert\nyou old rascal, you didn\u2019t do anything, did you? But you at least tried to redeem yourself and to\nhelp a people badly needed help [indecipherable] crucial time. It wasn\u2019t thousands of them, it\nwas maybe just a couple of hundred. And the couple of hundred have had children, some of them\nI know even eight to 10 children. And it seems that they have forgiven me for doing nothing,\neven Rabbi Poupko. My conscience is still not pleased, because when you have to be a man, you\nhave to be a man, even though it costs your life. \u2019' ve had moment -- in English you have the\nstatement, if a man is a chicken, he is not a man. At that moment I was a chicken.",
        "Q: What do --",
        "A: I\u2019m still -- I\u2019m still ashamed of that.",
        "Q: What do you think you could have done?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: What could you have done?",
        "A: I don\u2019t reflect about that, it\u2019s a matter of just sentimentality. The Rabbi Poupko tells me, if\nyou had decided to talk, you wouldn\u2019t be here witness to a crime, and a criminal would remain\nunpunished, and maybe a whole system would therefore remain unpunished. So in a certain\nsense, he\u2019d say, Lallier, be practical about thing. You may have decided not to talk because you\nknew you had a higher purpose than that. You had to become a witness to something awful that\nhad happened, and that was what your life was about. But even though it intellectually sounds --\nsounds very satisfying, to stand there and to look at the man killing, right in front of my face,\nseven innocent people one at a time, it\u2019s a horrendous experience.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It makes you lose your belief in God -- believe in God, because God would never allow a\nthing like that to happen. And it makes you lose your belief in basic simple human dignity.",
        "Q: Is that --",
        "A: Now, the happy thing about that is maybe the -- not happy, the positive about that 1s I didn\u2019t\nknow those seven people. I know they were Jewish. But if I had been able to discover who they\nwere, in the eyes of some, their names alone would recreate them as human beings who had been\nthere with a purpose, who had never fulfilled a purpose. Because if you say -- there\u2019s a big\ndifference between seven de -- and not the seven dead Jews, and saying Mr. Cour and Mr.\nSteinberg and Mr. Sweinberg and Mr. That or Mr. This and That. They are human beings in their\nidentities as they were. Their lives are recreated. One can even proceed and find out who they\nwere, what they had done, what they had achieved for the good or the bad. And if they had had\nrelatives or not [indecipherable] or not. And lo and behold, after the trial, two persons came\nforth, one claiming to be the granddaughter of the grandfather which she hadn\u2019t known what had\nhappened to except that he had died somewhere in the -- in the concentration camp.",
        "Q: How did -- how did you find out what the names of those seven people were?",
        "A: Oh, through -- through the documentary. Oh no, that I found out going myself and my -- I was\nsent as a Canadian delegate to the Czech Republic as a expert in financial -- international finance\nto Prague through Casel, which is an arm of the Canadian development -- international\ndevelopment agencies, to help some of the Czech bankers democratize their procedures and\nbring them up to par in terms of capitalistic banking practices. I spent six weeks in Prague\nconsulting with two very senior bankers, both of whom by -- were, by the way, communist party\nmembers, but who had mellowed down to capitalistic practices and wanting to learn about them.\nSo I was teaching them how a Canadian banker practices, and I spent six weeks there, and on the\nsecond week I le -- decided I\u2019d go back to Leitmeritz, I\u2019d go back to Theresienstadt for the\nsecond time to fact find and to reminisce. And I went back and I found the site. I found the\nmasses of graves and gravestones and all that. And that\u2019s when I decided I would not continue\nliving with myself with that feeling of shame unless I finally spoke up and --",
        "Q: And that\u2019s what made you speak up?",
        "A: -- made my confession. And I came back from Prague in August 1997, and in December, on\nDecember first, I arranged with Rambam and with a friend lawyer of mine who happens to be\nHungarian Jewish, who cord -- who had known me for many years and with Rabbi Poupko to\nmake my of-official confession about what had happened. And the rest follows all of that.",
        "Q: I read a report, but I had no idea whether it\u2019s true, that you spoke to a former Waffen SS\nperson, to ask about --",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, no, no. I had written -- no, no, that was after that, because once you have\ncome out into the open, there are certain repercussions, but also legal requisites, namely, I had to\nmake up my mind, do I sue, or do I not sue. Right?",
        "Q: No, I don\u2019t --",
        "A: Or do I [indecipherable] the Germans to sue.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Right? But to sue is a procedure going through, at the first stage, the consul general of\nGermany, of the modern, democratic, decent Germany, and go for two or three interviews so\nthey can squeeze me, if it\u2019s veracity or not, or if I\u2019m lying --",
        "Q: No, no, I was a -- I was asking -- what I read was that you asked a former Waffen SS person -",
        "A: No, no -- yeah, th -- but Ill come to that --",
        "Q: -- permission -- ah.",
        "A: -- no, no, no, but Pll -- I-P\u2019ll -- P11 come to that. Not for permission, misinterpretation.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But -- but in following through the legal preparation, legal proceedings as to how to go about,\nofficially I had to find out from the senior, still living, the Waffen SS highest commander, what\nhis post-war view were, namely, when I wrote -- I think it was 1998, okay, about a killing of this\nsort. So on the one hand I wanted to feel him out. On the other hand I wanted to play this -- this\nred herring of military hierarchy and the level of responsibility. So I wrote him a personal letter,\nhe was General Kumm, he was the second [indecipherable] general of my division, but it took\nhim away from [indecipherable] and he wasn\u2019t hanged because of that. The seven other\ncommanders were all hanged by the Titoists, and I think justifiably so, including a German Field\nMarshall. So I wrote to Kumm and surprisingly got an answer. I said, I have to account for you\nas the highest remaining Waffen SS ranking officer -- he was a brigadier, at the brigadier level,\nto account for you for the deed by Julius Viel then and then, involving seven Jews that they\nkilled in the Panzergraben. And -- not for permission, okay, I want you to tell me if, from what\nyou know about military discipline and military command structures if this can be looked at as a\nwar crime. He wrote me a letter, personal letter, signing it. I have original letter in his own\nhandwriting, from a Waffen SS brigadier who has since died about two years ago at the age of\n92. He says, Dr. Lallier, because I put in my full credential to make it [indecipherable], he said,\nDr. Lallier, I am reporting received of your letter, your inquiry, and all that I can say is that in my\nview -- I\u2019m translating now from the German -- in my view, any Waffen SS man or Waffen SS\nofficer who commits a war crime ceases being member of the Waffen SS. Which means to say,\nhe says, that friendship ends amongst Waffen SS officers, where war crimes are committed.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Now, an interesting statement, because he himself was commander of the division in which\nmany what we call today war crimes had been committed.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Now, had he learned anything in his long [indecipherable] life 1n which the Americans never\ntouched him, he never was in prison, because he was Germany\u2019s major s -- expert in partisan\nwartare, which the Americans were trying to learn about as much as we can, as we well know,\nright?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay? Now -- or, did he have any other intentions like finding a cheap way of apologizing?\nBut he in fact told me, you go ahead, because a war crime 1s a war crime, you have my blessing.\nI didn\u2019t need his blessing.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But I needed him to reveal himself. And you know, given the command structure, once a\nbrigadier tells me it\u2019s a war crime, the ones below him cannot say it\u2019s not a war crime. There is a\ntrouble with that. Everybody below him who were at court --",
        "Q: Said it was not.",
        "A: -- told me I was lying.",

        "A: Yeah. [indecipherable] yeah.",

        "A: Viel.",
        "Q: Viel.",

        "Q: And was she Hungarian?",
        "A: She was happy, she loved me for being able to get away with my life.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I\u2019ve been able to convince her she -- that she was the greatest lady in my life. And I think\nreally very happily with that concept. In return, she gave me love and the children.",
        "Q: And sh -- you had two children with her.",
        "A: You see [indecipherable] but my children are ya -- my children know.",
        "Q: Right. But they fa --",
        "A: My son I told, but he is 10 years younger than my daughter.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But my daughter I didn\u2019t tell about because she had had some upheavals in her life, I didn't\nwant to burden her with that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But after I came out with the confession, she came and said, Dad, you were absolutely right, I\nam completely on your side.",
        "Q: Yes. Why do you call it a confession, do you think?",
        "A: Because, as a Christian --",
        "Q: Since it isn\u2019t your act.",
        "A: -- as a Christian, to feel in a situation which you desperately need to talk to somebody who\nwill listen to you with feeling and with anticipation of being able to do something for you, you\nempty your soul. You empty your soul to get rid of the feeling of the sin that you had committed.\nAnd it is only upon m-matching the minds, he, the confessor, believe that you are honest. You,\nthe confessee are giving an honest information. There\u2019s a higher level of togetherness in which\nthe forgiveness is given by the authority who is raised in the culture, then educated to understand\nand to give you forgiveness. I\u2019m not a Catholic, I wouldn't believe in having to go to church to\nconfess my little [indecipherable] that and the priest would tell me -- tell me all about it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You see, I\u2019m not that, but I did go to [indecipherable] who was -- who was a Pryor of the\nBenedictines, which had been my school and ho-hoping for understanding, but his answer was --\nand when I told him about the crime, he says, Adalbert, you have got to build your postwar life.\nWhat has happened had happened, he says, you cannot change that, it\u2019s in God\u2019s hands. Now this\nis not an answer that I would consider satisfactory, right? But at the same time the urge to go to\nsomebody who 1s a potentate, I use the term potentate. What is a potentate? Kind of somebody\nassigned by God to fill in the particular command position where human needs are looked at and\ndecided positively creative.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I wanted to empty my soul for somebody to say, Lallier, we recognize your agony. We cannot\nforgive you, we are not God, but we\u2019ll pass on the message that on the whole you have tried to\nbe -- to be -- to become and remain a good guy. Confession. I want to die, I\u2019m 83 years old\nalmost, with somebody coming to my coffin and say, at least you gave me that job.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Simple as that. And I-I -- I have living witnesses [indecipherable] the kids, Evan and\nFrederick, I\u2019m trying to keep the candles lit. The Jewish people are special people. They suffered\na great deal at the hands of the Catholics, it wasn\u2019t right, all of 1t under the false premises that\nJesus had been killed. I asked myself often that, did Jesus deserve being declared a God? I prefer\nthe Jewish version, he was one of the prophets whose image as somebody, changed unto a\ngodlike image, for whatever extra powers that might involve or imply. So that\u2019s not in the right\nway, I don\u2019t even know if Jesus would have wanted to be declared a God. So I\u2019m much closer to\nthe Jewish interpretation of God, it\u2019s the one thing that I have problems with, the notion the\nJewish God is kind of desperately absolutist. Like we can bargain for everything, but God is the\nabsolute command, we\u2019d never even dare contemplate to make a counter-proposal. God to me 1s\nsomebody I can talk to, God is somebody will -- who will understand because God by nature is\ngood. God is not a command person. God is a guide. And God created Eve and Adam, I don\u2019t\nknow in which sequence, was it a guide who would eventually --",

In some ways you feel guilty because you feel you\nwere a coward, you didn\u2019t do something. But you also didn\u2019t do something against somebody. I\nmean, you didn't kill -- you didn\u2019t kill these Jews. But it also feels as if your feeling of guilt\nspans larger than that one incident --",
        "A: Oh, no --",
        "Q: -- that\u2019s it\u2019s m -- that it\u2019s --",
        "A: -- no, th-th-th-th - it -- clearly, the one incident is the sample, which demonstrates to you that\nthe incident itself took place in a context in which the broader reality --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- reconfirmed the evilness of that reality.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: It\u2019s the one particular example of an evil empire that I was part of. I don\u2019t know why, but I\nwas part of that. And the -- the feeling of guilt was, in a certain sense, arose from the feeling of\nimpotence -- after impo --- feeling la -- impo -- I\u2019d so desperately want to do something, but I\u2019m\nunable to do anything because I\u2019m totally petrified in my state. Now, what do you do with that?\nYou just swallow hard, just swallow hard and by swallowing hard you get to believe that if you\nhad done something, they may not have gotten killed. And Rabbi Poupko, I told you Rabbi\nPoupko exactly, Rabbi said Lallier, that doesn\u2019t follow, if you had done something they may not\nhave killed. Because if you had done something about the first one getting killed, they\u2019d kil --\nthey\u2019d have killed you and the other six anyway. But I cannot accept that because again, th-th-the\nharder view, a man being a man, in a context of a civil society in which killing is murder. And\nracially induced killing is the ultimate crime, let\u2019s say. Extermination of a whole people. What\ndoes a man do with that? Do I grab the gun? I didn\u2019t grab the gun. And I watched the other six.\nSo, by doing nothing, Viel was able to do whatever he had wanted to do.",

        "A: And since the other four children were two daughters and two sons, they\u2019d already by\ntradition taken on their professional training. My father would have been the one to join the\narmy, and become a soldier, right? But he had also finished university, in terms of a law degree\nequivalent, but he never got a law degree. So he was a second lieutenant and the one disturbing\nnews I hear, which had great influence over him was that after Hungary capitulated and the B\u00e9la\nKun regime took power, my father demilitarized, was still wearing the officer\u2019s uniform without\nthe insignia, was accosted by a bunch of commies in the -- the central part of Budapest, was put\nup against the wall to be shot on the spot by the communists. And he tells me the League of\nNations representative, [indecipherable] Pallavicini, from Italy originally, happened to have been\ndriving through and happened to witness the almost killing of my dad and some other former\nofficers, and saved him.",
        "A: So my father didn\u2019t get shot.",
        "A: And eventually the B\u00e9la Kun regime was -- was defeated by Horthy -- not the nicest of all\nnice in the world, but highly more -- much more acceptable to [indecipherable] traditionally than\nthe commies ever would. My father became an avid communist hater. All his life he was a\ncommunist hater, and especially after the Soviets took power. And during the second World\nWar, be Tito taking power. And the Romanians falling to communism. My father knew that we\u2019d\nlose everything and we lost everything. We lost the possessions in wa -- in -- in Romania, we lost\nthe possessions in Hungary, albeit late in 1940, except for a villa. And do you know Hungary at\nall? Lake Balaton?",
        "A: Lake Balaton used to have great, great inland sea. We had a beautiful little country house\nright on the lake, and lost everything what is not in Serbia today. And we lost even one particular\nvery 1-important little domain down on the Adriatic Sea. We lost everything. And the most\npainful loss was evidently the horse breeding, because not only did we lose that, but with the\nSoviets advancing 1944, they destroyed the whole thing, it was just [indecipherable] in Romania,\nand stooped -- stole all the remaining horses.",
        "A: So we were left -- my grandmother was left only with two factories and one large estate,\nwhich we then lost to the Titoists.",
        "A: So we are what we consider -- they would have called us higher bourgeoisie.",
        "A: In Hungarian terms.",
        "A: We were very well off, yeah, but that\u2019s why -- that\u2019s why you see --",
        "A: They were at Tameshwar. Tameshwar --",
        "A: -- is Tymiswar --",
        "A: -- today.",
        "A: And di -- whe -- and my dad was born on the Salas, the village by the name of Bukavitz.",
        "A: And the whole estate, the major estate of the horses was there.",
        "A: Ah, no, no, no --",
        "A: Oh, a -- about -- let\u2019s see, no, but that would be about four hours car drive.",
        "A: He -- after the war, th -- we had a problem.",
        "A: You mean, after the first World War.",
        "A: It\u2019s a very important question, that.",
        "A: Hungary having disintegrated, and big parts of Hungary having been chopped off, people\nliving in the chopped off areas had to make a choice of citizenship. My father never wanted to\ngive Austrian hi -- Austro-Hungarian citizenship, but Austro-Hungary didn\u2019t exist any more. It\nwas either Austria or Hungaria, or Romania, or -- they were still calling themselves the Kingdom\nof Serbs, Croats and Slavines. I think only in 1929 did they became Yugoslavia. Never loving\neach other, even killing each other in -- in Belgrade Parliament --",
        "A: -- would you believe that? Anyway, so he was traveling back and forth to try to take care of\nthe estates, but with the estates being in [indecipherable] because of expropriation rights,\nespecially minorities who had visibly remained Austro-Hungarian in spirit. My father was one of\nthose traveling back and forth, who remained Austro-Hungarians committed to the crown that\ndidn\u2019t exist, committed to the [indecipherable] in Budapest that didn\u2019t exist, but loving Horthy,\nbecause Horthy was claimed by the Hungarians to become the personal representative of the\ncrown, the Hungarians still hoping that one of the sons of Oto, the last Kaiser, would eventually\nbe invited back in. Which never happened, right?",
        "A: So moving from one place to another, he sometimes took jobs. He spoke his five or six local\nlanguages, was [indecipherable] useful. So he worked for awhile. For the Hungarians he worked\nin administration. For the Romanians he didn\u2019t work, he -- [whisper]",
        "A: For the rom -- he\u2019d never work for the Romanians.",
        "A: Gossip has it that 1f you want to go to a really corrupt country anywhere in Europe, you don\u2019t\nhave to go further than Romania.",
        "A: Right? And he also worked for the Serbs in Dubocka where I was born --",
        "A: -- you see. And his last post there was, from what I remember, was -- you know kuntai, a -- in\nthe United States you have the states and the states have some divisions.",
        "A: Of the main subdivisions, of te -- 10 - 15 - 20, we lived just on one or two towns. And back\nhome did have a chief administrative [indecipherable] officer, which is called a landrat in\nAustria.",
        "A: There\u2019s no such title, but I would call him a -- a -- a legal officer, chief legal administrative\nofficer of the whole region, containing up to 20 villages of one or two towns. Th-That was his\nlast job.",
        "A: You see, and it qualified him as a civil servant, but he never got any promotion, even though\nhe was -- my dad was, intellectually, a very self possessed person. Highly trained -- you know,\nit\u2019s in the blood after all generation [indecipherable] and some of these [indecipherable] for some\ntime bloomed forth a very fast thinker, very energetic, great sportsman, great writer. He thought\nhe was great in everything, including his hating the communists. But his hatred of communists\ndidn\u2019t prevent us from losing everything. I\u2019ve learned not to hate anything. But it\u2019s easy if you\nhave nothing, how can you -- you either hate everything or you hate nothing.",
        "A: I -- no, I was wa -- I think I grew -- was in Botos three years, and then we also had a smaller\nplace in a place where my mom died. Where did she die? Parage, P-a-r-a-g-e. Parage in\nHungarian, I don\u2019t know what it means. I -- it\u2019s just a name on that tiny village. We had another\nplace there and she was -- you know I -- wait now, I -- now I remember, actually. In Parage we\nhad a house, several hectares of land and a -- a well 200 meters deep.",
        "A: Now that\u2019s a lot of da -- depth, right? And how do I remember that? At me -- watermelon\ntime, our male servant, Ilya was his name, he was a Slav, kept on lowering the watermelons 200\nmeters down in the rope to have them ice cold before bringing them up. And I remember that\nbecause my mom\u2019s illness was somehow linked with that deep well, but I\u2019ve never found to what\nextent. I remember the water was enormously cold. My grandmother sometime splashed my\nbrother and I. She was in that time there too. And I [indecipherable] frigid. So maybe -- did she\ntake her bath in ice cold water, which Ilya had just brought her in a some -- something like that,\nshe developed galloping pneumonia, she was gone.",
        "A: She died in Parage, she was buried in Parage.",
        "A: Even though we had no linkages with Parage whatsoever except that little place, which we\neventually lost.",
        "A: After Parage we went to Brimuk, which is another Hungarian village in the Bauska. And from\nBrimuk he then -- he was transferred over, he went back to Tameshwar for two years, which was\nabout \u201832 to \u201834, and then he went back to our remaining properties in [indecipherable]. That was\nin the Barnot. Barcika is in the middle, Barnot is to the east of that.",
        "A: [indecipherable] the Serbs call that Petrovgrad then, today they call it Zrenjanin, in which we\nhad two factories. And those were, because of its -- this possession\u2019s gradual by the heir\ncountries of parts of Hungary. We had lost everything in Romania and we had lost the thing over\nat the Adriatic, right? There still remained one house in Vienna, I remember that in the 19\ndistrict. And we remained within those two factories and those two factories were the last\nremnant because some -- some of the other possessions that we had had, because of the -- the --\nthe Great Depression. We lost part of that because of the Great Depression, including\nparticipation a particular [indecipherable] if I remember, 1n Tameshwar. I think I even have a\nphoto of something that looks like a [indecipherable] building. And so we were hanging onto\nthose -- hanging onto those two factories, but --",
        "A: They were -- one produced textiles and the other one producing valves and -- what do you\nattach valves to? Cylinders.",
        "A: Valves and cylinders.",
        "A: It was a nast vetwork",
        "A: -- of the capitalistic investment viable during the course of the Austro-Hungarian empire,\nbecause it was a solidly established 32 million dollar -- 32 million peoples\u2019 market. And with the\ndisintegration of all that, the market potential had disappeared. The Serbs would never trade with\nthe Hungarians. Through Romanians nobody would trade because they never pay. The Austrians\nhad no money left, so the whole system gradually disintegrated.",
        "A: Like you\u2019re hanging on your good -- then you could declare bankruptcy. All I\n[indecipherable] personally, what I saved from that is knowing how to ride a horse, even had my\nown horse for awhile, and memories of what a great life it would have been if it hadn\u2019t been for\nthat stupid Hitler.",
        "A: Because we had -- we had -- you know, in choosing where to live, you recognize that people\nare people are people, and that people, being individualistic, have a right in their own\nnationhood. And one who believes that [indecipherable] if they believe they\u2019re distinct enough\nand if they believe that they can maintain themselves without leeching off other countries,\nneighboring countries, then they rightly hold -- need a nationhood.",
        "A: Right? But in my father\u2019s eyes, it was the empire or nothing.",
        "A: Right? He never had any chance of any promotions anywhere, right? And I think he left this\nwhole area as a refugee because A, the commies would have gotten him, they\u2019d have\n[indecipherable] right? He had a gran -- he had a mother who was a very distinguished lady of\nsociety, and she\u2019s -- he just couldn\u2019t st-stand the risk of Tito Hungarian communism getting hold\nof my grandmother.",
        "A: You know? So he escaped to Austria and --",
        "A: -- and [indecipherable] toward the end of the war, and then eventually [indecipherable] he met\nthat German, fine looking. I think sh -- one -- she\u2019s one of the few good Germans\n[indecipherable] she -- met her, fell in love with her, had his mother with him all the time. Had\nenough means to establish himself. And because of his languages and the legal training, he\neventually won a post with the German federal government. Now, I resented that very much.\nActually, if you want to know something really specific, my father was a -- a German speaking\nAustrian, speaking German like an Austrian, just like me. But he has already established\ncredentials at a time when West Germany needed men who would go through these\nDenazification rituals -- I call them rituals on purpose because some people thought that it was\nfoolish because they let the big Nazis go and ritualize the little Nazis had never done anything to\nanybody. And my father was, for awhile, I think 12 months in the area of Bavaria, a\nDenazification judge.",
        "A: Now was it that because he was known to become -- been an anti-communist all his life and\nby 1947 the Cold War had broken out? Or was it because of his special legal knowledge, or was\nit because of his languages?",
        "A: But one way or the other he was the -- he was the -- the [indecipherable] local for\nDenazification president and he was doing that for 11 months. And I -- I had difficulties with that\nbecause he was not a German. And difficulties with the notion of his living in Germany. Why\nwouldn\u2019t he have stayed in Austria? And he said to me -- we talked about it several times after I\nfound him, you see, because don\u2019t forget I was prisoner of war for a year.",
        "A: British prisoner of war. So eventually I -- after they let me go in August 1946, so I was\nputting in a lot of to finally -- finally I discovered he was in [indecipherable] why do you have to\ngo to Germany? And he said, because I love her. I said, don\u2019t you forget everything else? Don\u2019t\nyou forget what has happened? He says, in Austria communists lived -- the communists were\nright in Vienna and I\u2019m -- I was afraid. They almost killed me once, I wanted to be safe enough,\nand well, Germany was safe enough. So I visited him three times in the course of 30 years.",
        "A: And I had my personal reasons for not feeling home [indecipherable]. She was a great lady,\nEdith, but my father and I didn\u2019t -- you bu -- beautifully put -- said question, my father and I\nwere very close. Spiritual very close, mentally very sharp, very close, sportsmanlike very close.\nAnd we were kind of principled. My brother was more a merchant [indecipherable] but live and\nlet live. And we went -- we went apart because of that. And he also told me -- I told him, look,\nI\u2019ve had enough of this [speaks Hungarian] in Hungarian. [Hungarian] means real pig\n[indecipherable] I\u2019m going to go to Canada. Adalbert, you are the only one I have.",
        "A: Now it\u2019s you who is number one. I said, so what, because my broth -- well, your brother is\ndead. So I said, what do I do with that, \u2019m number one, we have nothing left. He says, oh yeah,\nyou have pride left, you have family tradition left and you will do what I want you to do. So I\nsaid, what do you want me to do? You stay in Germany, and go to university in Germany and try\nto become a diplomat. Me? A diplomat in the German -- no. I said, Dad, no. I prefer anything to\nthat. His eyes popped out and said [indecipherable] you want to emigrate? You lose your\ncivilization if you go to America. I says, oh really? Six months later I was [indecipherable] and\nhe never talked to me again for five years.",
        "A: Very --\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: So I told you about my brother and h-he loved that Jewish girl.",
        "A: And yeah, well, they forgot to mention. So the Germans, as I said, just to update that\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: -- April 1941, the Nazis came in, took possession of the Barnot, gave Barcika and Barnya\nback to the Hungarians. The bridges were already built for the Hungarians, then we had to come\nin the Barnot, we were living in Montbachkirche, and we were all waiting and I was already\nanticipating going to Budapest to study, because I finished my -- was about finishing my high\nschool, very well finishing my high school. And suddenly the bridges were torn off and the\nGermans said, we will remain occupiers of the Barnot for the time being. And that\u2019s how that\n[indecipherable] division was created out of this -- that peasant [indecipherable] w-we were\ncalled [indecipherable] all of a sudden. And within six months, the Jewish people disappeared.",
        "A: Yeah, and from the world, yeah. And including the little raven, shiny haired beauty that my\nbr-brother was so terribly in love. How can I say terribly in love, delightfully love in with. And\nupon inquiring, my father told me that he had learned from the Germans that they were picked up\nfor their better safekeeping. Put up in some brick factories, usually. The main brick factory was\nin Poncho, which was Ponchoway in Hungarian, just off the -- off the Danube river, on the --\nnorth of the Danube river, from whence they suddenly disappeared around September, October\n1941. And we never heard of the [indecipherable] again. But we had not heard anything,\nshooting or gassing or anything, they were just gone, you see. [indecipherable] was the first case\nof a massive enleve mon, in French. Enleve mon means the picking up en masse and they\ntransport them, carting them away [indecipherable]. But not the Jews were first ones to have\nbeen -- how do I know that? My father had, wherever -- whenever he was in Bachkirche, he had\na card round. Every Tuesday night they were playing cards, one of the four guys, four guys,\neverything. They were drinking, they were smoking, they were banging the table like the way\nmen were supposed to do to [indecipherable]. One of them was a mathematics teacher by name\nof -- by nam-ame-ame -- by the name of Frankel, he was a Jewish guy. And he always managed\nwinning. It made my father very angry. But they kept on playing for years. Now how do I know\nthat? I was the one serving them the wine.",
        "A: And then Frank -- Frank was a great math teacher, was my math teacher. He had the ge --\nbuilt me -- geometric models from potatoes. He brought in a potato, cut off it\u2019s last thi -- see, you\nsee what an arc 1s? You see -- you see, you can measure that along -- he loved it. He in my mind\nwas a very influential creator of curiosity.",

        "A: Ping pong and chess have nothing to do with each other. I love -- my father introduced me\ninto -- you know how I survived the war? I knew how to take care of my body.",
        "A: Yes. You want to have a confession? Never engaged in any se -- any sexual relation until I\nwas 22 and a half. Why?",
        "A: Why? Because so many guys in the war decimated, they were pulled back from the front, the\nfirst thing they did, half dead, pulled back from the front, went to the whorehouses. So they were\nalways caught in between having [indecipherable] because the food was also terrible. And yet\nthey lined themselves up. For miles they were lined up for a whorehouse of five or six or seven\nwomen, right? Horrendous experience. When I saw this at ma -- I won\u2019t have to do anything\nwith that. And then I met my -- my potential first wife, for whom I saved myself, and who had\nsaved myself unknowing for me.",

        "A: But her father was German Volksdeutsche, yeah. And I married her in Vienna. And -- and I\nmust also say she was blonde, blue eyed, which is curious for me because when I was destined or\nselected to go on officer\u2019s training in the Waffen SS, there still was a requisite that to be a real\nWaffen SS officer you had to be blonde, blue eyed.",
        "A: And [indecipherable] 80, and all those things. And I was just the opposite of that, looking like\na Gypsy amongst all those blondes. And I had to go to a special commission, a racial\ninvestigation commission. [indecipherable]. And they looked at me and said, you don\u2019t qualify,\njust the color of your hair, the color of your eyes. And th-the other said, but we need young man\nwho knows ports and have been in the war [indecipherable] anything? So they checked my --\nthey checked my protruding brain, oh good brain capacity.",
        "A: Why would Adolf worry about good brain ca -- brain capacity [indecipherable] good,\nimpressive brain capacity, fine bone structure. Too French, but with a bit of training, the bones\nwill be okay. Fine muscle structure, but his outside looks have to be improved upon.

        "A: With whom I would have to procreate four children, watch this one, one of whom would be\npurely blonde, an improvement of the race. Another one would be half blonde, also an\nimprovement, but two would remain hopeless, they said. Hopelessly non-German looking.",
        "A: And it was th -- several times in my life in those -- those terrible three years in which I was\nreally feeling abused and angry, as I said, who are they to tell me what kind of woman I should\nmarry? I mean it -- you know, this was really trespassing upon my personal is -- guess what? I\nwas released from POW camp, made it to Vienna as fast as possible to go back to school, right,\nat the university because I\u2019d had my gymnasium, right? And who do I see at the -- round street\ncorner just marching away, a little blonde kid with her mother. And I look in the [indecipherable]\nwent around the corner, never had a [indecipherable]. Something compelled me to trace myself\nback [indecipherable] and that was that little blonde blue-eyed kid.",
        "A: My two children are blonde blue eyed.",

        "A: But, by my voluntary choice, that\u2019s different.",

        "A: No --",
        "A: -- no, to me -- to me -- you could -- what appealed to me, you could stand up tall and raise\nyour eyes to the heavens and talk to your God, hoping to talk to -- directly by talk to. To me the\npope was not essential.",
        "A: To me -- because I had to learn the little catechism, you know the catechism? Catechism was\nwhat the pope wanted us to believe, not letting us be free to choose what we wanted to believe.",
        "A: So I had no use for the catechism.",
        "A: And between the two of us, I\u2019m very critical of the 10 commandments, that they were -- the\nway they were spelled out.",
        "A: But we have a personal responsibility to God, but it also gives us the right and the\n[indecipherable] to ask, God, where are you?",

        "A: She says [indecipherable] Baylor, you have to make sure to learn how to distinguish between\na lady and just an ordinary woman. Trouble is, in Vienna, the ladies were in the [indecipherable]\ndistrict, the ordinary women were in the second district.",
        "A: And she said, eventually she said, there is nothing wrong learning how to -- going to the girls\nin the second district.",

One of them was six\nfoot something, big moustache, legs like that and she didn't like my jumpy attitude. I was a fast\nlearner, I wanted to learn fast, to play games fast, and eventually it was so bad she couldn\u2019t corre\n-- she tied my legs to the chair [indecipherable] onto the chair, said you will now sit for an hour\nbecause I want you to sit for an hour and do exactly what I want you, I said, but I\u2019ve already\nfinished. That\u2019s not the is-issue. You have to follow me, you have to -- I am the one to educate\nyou, to bring you up, therefore, you have to learn discipline. Oh, I hated her. And then -- but -- at\nnight she said, never go out in the dark, because there\u2019s a guy waiting for you with the knife. She\nwas terrified of the dark. Eventually my father let her go. The other woman was okay.",
        "A: The other woman was a loving girl, a loving woman by the name of Anna Fayis, also\ncomplete -- very Hungarian. She really made a Hungarian out of [indecipherable]. She was from\n-- she was also from Szeged, right. Blonde woman, she was an educator, very tough but very fair,\nand very decent. She didn't mistreat us. But she was almost like a mother substitute, except my\nfather was loafing around, so she could kind of not handle my father, you see [indecipherable].\nBut she was a very strong influence and she survived the war and went back to Hungary and I\ncorresponded with her until 1963, when she died.",
        "A: And from her -- her, I was able to retrieve some of those photographs there.",
        "A: Because she had somehow managed to save some of the things that the commies had taken\nout.",

        "A: -- I greet -- did go to a high, high -- the Hungarian school was a very [indecipherable] school.\nI have a matriculation --",
        "A: -- from a Hungarian secondary school, which was a good enough school to give me\nimmediate admission to the university in Budapest --",
        "A: -- which was the most famous university, [indecipherable] university in Prague, and the\nVienna University in Austria.",
        "A: And eventually, after I was released from prisoner of war, I went to Vienna with that\ncertificate, I was admitted immediately to the --",
        "A: -- university to study, guess what, law. I always told my father, I don\u2019t want to study law, I\ndon\u2019t want to study law, I don\u2019t want to study diplomacy, I want to study [indecipherable]\npolitical science. He said, you will study law [indecipherable]. So eventually I took --",
        "A: -- took up law and political science, but then I dropped law, I found law -- law is boring.",
        "A: Anyway, I have a very good --",
        "A: -- high school condition.",
        "A: Oh, I love -- I loved studying because, first of all, my brain was very flexible. I don\u2019t know\nwhether it\u2019s that French stimulus or a Hungarian -- it\u2019s a -- some kind of a mix of the French and\nthe Hungarian that keeps you jumping all the time. Everybody says, Lally, your metabolism 1s\nfantastic. You never sit back and do nothing. Absolutely right.",
        "A: Now, what I know is what nobody else knows. You know why I always keep on jumping?\nWhen the Germans marched into Austria -- Austria was a leisurely people. On the whole most of\nthem are good-willed people, they\u2019re a lot of fun, kind of like the French 1s and the -- the Italian.\nSo they went Nazi for awhile because they needed jobs and maybe because of Hitler and all that,\nbut on the whole they are a more leisurely people than the ever -- the Germans would ever hope\nto be. The Germans quickly built [indecipherable] and mortars into the behinds of every one of\nus, right, to make us move like the Germans. I think they forgot to take one out. Keeps on\nmaking me jumpy. But I was a good student and a very -- I loved the Latin. At that time they still\nhad six years of Latin, four years of Greek, and I loved the -- the -- the classicists. Greek\nmythology has great significant in my life. I really believe in Venus. I also believe in Pallas\nAthena because to me the ideal lady is a combination of Venus and Pallas Athena, you see.\nBrain-wise and otherwise. And also loved games, so in order to be able to do everything within\nthe constraints of a disciplinary upbringing, I had to be fast in learning to get away from those\nropes.",
        "A: And how to be good at sports, to have an [indecipherable] with my dad, that was kind of de-\nemphasizing studies, he really wanted to just play soccer, obviously, being a left wing and the --\nin the high school soccer team, also playing soc -- ping pong and also playing chess. My father\ntaught me how to play chess. After two years he stopped, he said, I can\u2019t stand it any more, you\nkeep on winning all the time. Very [indecipherable]. So I was a fast learner and with the\nlanguages, you grew up with the Hungarian and with the Slavic, and with the Romanian and with\nthe German and with the -- whatever French there had been in the family still [indecipherable]\nmy -- my grandmother, father\u2019s mother always called an umbrella a parapree. A strange term in\nAustria, right? But that\u2019s the way it was, so I wer -- grew up with five languages and I still\ncommanding -- have added to that English and some Russian because when I was at Columbia\nUniversity I was taken up into a special program in which my capacities, like music capacities,\nwill be brought to full bloom by [indecipherable] and they -- they were going to employ me by\nthe Rand Corporation to become a -- some kind of a spy about eastern Europe, understandably\nso. The Americans want to pick the brain that can instantaneously prove useful. They knew, the\nAmericans, about my forced induction in that, but th-they forgave me. And I have to tell you that",
        "A: -- that\u2019s a latter part of the story.",
        "A: I -- I loved studying. But back home the limits of studying was within the context of your\nsocioeconomic structure. You needed to know how to understand that, but don\u2019t worry about\nthings outside of that. It was not universal education. It was parochial [indecipherable] empire in\nU.S. education. The Kaiser is on the top and you always have to bow to them. Somewhere along\nthe line I dropped that. Why do I have to bow to a Kaiser if I don\u2019t have to bow if I want talk to\nGod? And Canada and Magill broadened my attitude to become a Universalist attitude, the\nessential foundation being peace among humans.",
        "A: Because all humans have red blood. It makes no sense at all to shed human lifes, or -- blood is\nequally red, why -- why -- why shed it? That\u2019s -- that\u2019s me today.",

And they even gave them barisees exceptionally with appropriate financial\npayments. If we wanted [indecipherable] graf, a count, you had to pay three times more than\nyou\u2019d had to pay. But there were quite a few very successful Jewish businessman who had\nbecome barons and were living -- and their ladies -- living a [indecipherable] lifestyles, with free\nentry to the [indecipherable] and to all the privileges, to parliament and all that. But amongst the\nmasses, especially in the east, the most part there was there the [indecipherable] there was\nalways greater anti-Semitism.",
        "A: The Hungarian peasantry was very anti-Semitic. That\u2019s an issue that hasn\u2019t been fully\nexplored yet. The Jewish people, the Jewish potentates, I call them potentates in Hungary, right,\nthey were not enemies of Hungarian ordinary peasants, because the peasants were living in a\nfeudal system. The big enemies of Hungarian peasants were the Hungarian aristocrats. The\nHungarian aristocrats were explicitly anti-Semitic, unlike the Viennese aristocracy.",
        "A: You see, by then, any feudal system, remember, five, 600 years ago had its basic principles\nresting on the Jews killed Jesus, therefore we have to exterminate the Jews and we have to keep\nthem in place. We have to let them prosper then we\u2019ll rob them blind. So a necessary evil, it has\nto be fully controlled. That is a feudal system. With the enlightenment period, this emphasis on\nthe Jews killed Jesus, therefore we have to kill the Jews has disappeared [indecipherable] in\nparticular in Italy, and of course, particularly amongst the more educated classes of the German\nspeaking Protestants, right? But the Catholics were hanging onto that well until [indecipherable],\nit\u2019s the truth, you see, so you\u2019re raised in a situation like that, you see Frankel, the mathematic\nteacher playing a -- pleasurably yelling as much and drinking as much, and I-I knew he was\nJewish, but he was member of a group, of an in-group of the higher bourgeoisie, and behaving\nlike it too. Like the guys had all the rights, the guys have all the powers. They could misbehave,\nthey can be drunk, right? Get into all kinds of mischief and yet they were excused because they\nare men, and presumed to be just.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Ah well, the -- the -- no, no, the -- the -- we never knew of the existence of just the ordinary\npoor Jewish people who were Orthodox.",
        "A: We were with the cultured Jewish people. Li -- never brought up the question in my mind,\nexcept many years after the second World War of how much discrimination there must have\nbeen between the Jewish people who had arrived --",
        "A: -- in the uppermost classes and the little Orthodox bearded ones still living in the villages in\nPoland and Hungary. I remember one instance in New York City, Ill tell you about that later on.",
        "A: A Mr. Rosenberg.",
        "A: You must have heard that name Rosenberg, one of the greatest [indecipherable] in New York\nCity ever, who was a German Jew, who was able to get away with special arrangements with the\nNazis, with all of his paintings, set himself up in New York City, right? Had a glorious daughter,\nbrought -- bringing her up on the -- on the west side, right?",
        "A: Bringing her up in the -- spoke only -- he was Prussian German. As Prussian German as any\nPrussian German would want to be, brought up his daughter in America speaking the Prussian\nGerman accent. I met her when I was at Columbia University and living in International House,\nshe was a frequent visitor because she had a guy there that she knew, was -- she was musically\ninclined.

        "A: Brought up [indecipherable] but to answer your question, class-wise, if you\u2019re at a certain\nelite level, Jewish or not, made no difference at all, just like in England. There are in British\nparliament from Jewish lords, I know, successful bankers, successful businessmen who I know.",
        "A: No, I was not in a situation in which you would say a Jew is all good or bad. We didn\u2019t know\nabout the poor Jews in Poland.",
        "A: They were simply nonexistent. And the ones that are socially acceptable, they were just like\neverybody else.",
        "A: And you know what\u2019s an interesting thing?",
        "A: The Jewish people that I knew of a certain rank, they were Hungarian nationalists, or Austrian\nnationalists, or Serbian nationalists or Romanian nationalists, even though they were Jewish. But\nthe Hungarian Jews was really Hungarian. What else could they be? So la --",
        "A: Sorry?",

        "A: -- the -- the -- the -- Hor -- the -- Horthy\u2019s regime was very much in support of Hungarian\nJews.",
        "A: You see? By the way, the interesting statistic is also B\u00e9la Kun was a Jewish Hungarian, but he\nhad gone communist.",
        "A: So maybe he had gone communist because he thought that somebody had to do something\nliberational for the little Jewish people who were poor, barely living in the modern\n[indecipherable]. I know -- I never studied that, but th-the -- a very serious question arose in my\nmind some years ago, and I been looking at that. I have caught in Vienna many years ago when I\nwas visiting a display of Austrian Jews who had per -- been persecuted by the Nazis, who had\ndisappeared, who had been killed. As again, the Austrian Jews had been able to get away. 80\npercent of the Austrian Jewish intelligentsia was allowed to get away. The poor Austrian Jews,\nliterally almost all of them perished.",
        "A: [indecipherable] because they were not able to get away.",
        "A: But at the same time, seems like it\u2019s some kind of an imbalance. How come Rosenberg was\nable to get away with everything, and tens of thousand of poorly Jews are killed?",
        "A: It just -- something is lacking there, som-some feeling of responsible -- responsibility 1s\nlacking.",
        "A: Well, they were all [indecipherable] they were all -- except -- except for the ones who were\ncaught as having been anti-Hitler, those who had been able to get away anyway, right, to the\nanti-Hitler areas. But the ones who stayed inside, mostly they were caught and executed. The\nothers were solidly marching, e-even the Austrian. He gave us jobs, he is wa -- our own li-life\nand blood.

And everybody wearing a\nuniform, marching together, were trying out yell everybody else. There were no weapons. There\nwere just brutal encounters and -- between the uniformed communists, uniformed blackists,\nwhich was the Austrian National Traditional party, and the uniformed retro -- the socialists, but\nnot as red as the communist redshirts, right?",

        "A: But the -- the politics of it -- the politics of it remain hidden in the background, you know\nwhy? Because Berlin was selected unanimously to become the site of the 1936 Olympics.",

        "A: And that\u2019s exactly the point.",
        "A: Wanting to be best at something has nothing to do with race or creed. You have the talent,\ndevelop it, but 1t doesn\u2019t make you better than anybody else.",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019d have loved to have been part of that movie, why not, glorifying sport.",
        "A: You were in -- you\u2019re in -- you\u2019re -- as long as you\u2019re engaged in sport, right?",
        "A: You cannot -- you\u2019re not supposed to -- not engage in sex at the same time, right? Nor are you\nengaged in racism.",
        "A: Oh, but surely it was, on hindsight.",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t notice that, I was just carried away with the Hungarians having an incredible\nperformance.",
        "A: Well, at the -- the -- please don\u2019t forget, at the level of 11 year olds, the German yo-youth\nwere already in the Hitler youth.",
        "A: We were boy scouts.",
        "A: In Hungary there were boy scouts, there were no Hitler youth. Actually, in Hungary there\nnever were any Hitler youth. In the Banar there were Volksdeutsche Hitler youths equivalent, but\nthat\u2019s a very -- way secondary, lower com -- con-consideration. So if you\u2019re a boy scout, you\u2019re\na Universalist, you kind of look at the Hitler youth we knew, but there were no movies about the\nHitler youth. You\u2019ll notice all placards, you received placards [indecipherable] say, well they are\ndoing the same, they said they all look so blonde. Why do they all look so blonde? But they\ndidn\u2019t go beyond that. We were Hungarians on the -- of all kinds of mixed. You have light\nblondes, dark blondes, you have Slavic looking types, you have Gypsy looking types, all kinds of\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Took Austria.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It had no import on us --",
        "A: -- except my -- my grandmother was saying oh, now business will become a bit better.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, when Hitler invaded Austria, I [indecipherable] in the world invaded\nconsciously, not liberated okay, it\u2019s a big difference.",
        "A: An German -- Austrian German would say liberated. [indecipherable] invaded Austria,\noccupied Austria --",
        "A: -- our business was improving, because --",
        "A: There was no war, right, but there was massive unemployment. And Austria had needed\naccess to the German market --",
        "A: -- who were fully employed under the auspices of the state. Exports, subsidies, you name it,\nHitler had that. Chalke had worked on the policies magnificently. All of a sudden Germans are\ngetting money and gold from all over the place, but they weren't satisfied, right? And part of that\nover-spilled into Austria, part of that into the agricultural economies, because the agriculture\neconomy needed machinery. In exchange for the machinery, they delivered to the Germans\n[indecipherable] for butter and whipping cream. I remember after the Germans came into\nVienna, six weeks after there was no whipping cream left in Vienna, which was a major\ncatastrophe, don\u2019t laugh at me. The Germans took it all. But they paid for in cash.",
        "A: So business improved.",
        "A: The what?",
        "A: No, that was 1938? I was 13 years old.",
        "A: Almost 14, yeah.",
        "A: Oh no, there was -- well, in Austria -- I was not in Vienna itself in 1938, but there was a\ndisquiet. Mr. Frank expressed -- sometimes he came with very sad face to his -- to card games\nwith my dad.",
        "A: And it lasted for about two years, and then it suddenly just gone, I\u2019ve t -- ve told you that.",
        "A: But we heard from friend in Vienna that the Jewish people had disappeared in the course of\nJune, July 1938, literally overnight. And all those ghastly scenes about the broomsticks, you\nknow, having to clean the streets --",
        "A: -- you know, wash the roads [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- underneath, that those excesses had happened, but the observation there is that sa -- I\nremember some of the Austria monarchists saying quite critically, if the allies hadn\u2019t destroyed\nAustria-Hungary, the Jewish pogroms would never have happened.",
        "A: -- because the Jewish population was at peace during the r-reign of Joseph -- Franz Joseph the\nsecond, was at peace with the community at large.",
        "A: -- and were fully [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- that, but only at the level of the higher bourgeoisie. So they were in Hungary, even though\nless so, because the Hungarian aristocracy was very opposed to the Jewish rising influence in\nfinancial services especially, right. But with the disintegration of the empire, right, somebody\nwas made the scapegoat, and Hitler succeeded, I think -- I\u2019m just jumping here -- succeeded in\nconvincing the only Austrian working class person without a job that Hitler\u2019s proposition that the\nGerman Jews has benefited from the first World War equally applied in Austria.",
        "A: Namely that there was Austrian Jewish person who had benefited from the first World War.\nBut that 1s absolute nonsense, because with Austria-Hungary being destroyed, everybody lost.\nBut Hitler and the Nazis in Austria were able to exploit that. And as you would expect,\nmanipulating those uneducated brains into ou-outbur -- outbursts of hatred, led to the scenes of\nthe Austrian mob forcing -- with the policemen just looking on, right, forcing the Jewish persons,\nincluding the highly intelligentsia Jewish person, including the very skilled doctor, and\n[indecipherable] to kneel on the streets and clean on the streets in Austria.",
        "A: And then there were no hue and cry. By the time there was no hue and cry when the Jews\nsuddenly disappeared because anti-Semitism, latent amongst the peoples, masses at large, was\nbrought on very forcefully by Hitler\u2019s own presence.",
        "A: My father was lucky. My father was -- he was, I think -- how should I answer that? Frank was\na very good friend of his. I remember there was a Jewish dentist [indecipherable] Beshker, who\nwas a very good friend of his. My father said previous, as I mentioned to you, that Hitler would\nbe -- would be a good means to keep communism at bay and help us save our properties. But\nthen with respect to the Jews, I think he was contented to know -- too contented to really believe\nthat when the Jews of the Banar disappeared, that what the Germans had claiming, including the\nVolksdeutsche German representative, that they were being rounded up for their own\nsafekeeping, that\u2019s where it stopped.",
        "A: I think he fell into that trap, if we --",
        "A: Well, I -- I b -- I -- I believe -- I -- I still feel aggrieved about what happened to that little\nJewish girl that my brother was in love with. And I re -- I ca -- I saw my brother crying many,\nmany, many times, and I never saw him smiling ever again. But I thought that was a singular\ncase of a boy loving a girl, without referring to the girl being a Jewish girl. So --",
        "A: So I was -- I was -- well, let\u2019s see now, this would have been 1941, in June \u201941 I was 16 years\nold. We had -- I had no Jewish guys actually at all in the Hungarian school, but we couldn\u2019t have\nhad that because they had disappeared in the summer of 1941.",
        "A: No, let me just see --",
        "A: Shocking? Well, absolu -- I\u2019d have to go back in my memory cells.",
        "A: What -- what about that disturbed me -- well, also kind of made me feel neutral? I think I -- I\nmust have kind of felt well, that\u2019s the way things are these days.",
        "A: If they say -- and we knew that the superior force had come in, if that is the way things are\nhappening, that is part the way -- ay -- oh, you, I have the answer. I was much more concerned\nabout the Germans, the Nazi Germans coming 1n and hanging hundreds of Serbs accused of\nbeing communists, all over the main market squares in Montbachkirche, in Boch, in -- there are\nthree major cities in the Banar. Montbachkirche, Notchkinken and Ponchua, right?",
        "A: They were hanging hundreds of Serbs, rounding up in the streets, without any cause\nwhatsoever, and let them hang there for days, with placards saying this is how people will end\ntheir lives if they raise their fists, or whatever, do something against the occupational force of the\nGermans. I was so perturbed about that, visibly in front of our eyes, that the disappearance of the\nJewish people was not really knowing where they\u2019re gone to.",
        "A: There was no rumors about their [indecipherable]",
        "A: There was no knowledge of concentration camp.",
        "A: I think the much greater evil was the hanging of all these Serbs --",
        "A: -- because they were left hanging there.",
        "A: There were nothing.",
        "A: Nothing at all. Nothing at all. Only noise -- [indecipherable] got to mean something very bad\neventually, after the fact. Namely, the [indecipherable] kills.",
        "A: They were rounded up, as I mentioned to you already in Montbachkirche, Libriken and in\nPonchua. So somehow they got over the [indecipherable] linked with the idea of -- that\u2019s from\nwhere they were eventually disappeared, and nobody knows where.",
        "A: But there was no talk at all about concentration camps. Don\u2019t forget, the only concentration\ncamp existing, the earliest one was Dachau 1936, and Dachau was not for Jewish people. The\nJewish camps, I think, were being opened up -- Flossenbirg 1939.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. So actually the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- regretfully of cour -- in the -- the\nextermination camps --",
        "A: -- were only 1941 - \u201942 - \u00b043.",
        "A: Yeah, but it was -- that was --",
        "A: It was -- it -- 1t goes back to that but th-the -- the -- f-from what I\u2019ve read since then including\nCharter\u2019s book on Hitler and all that, the -- the main intention of the early concentration camps 1s\nto make it a point to which to -- into -- which to enclose completely, the enemies of the state\npolitical. Communists, reactionaries, anti-Nazis, generally speaking. And eventually the\nunterklass, namely the Gypsies, in that order, and only eventually the Jewish people, in camps of\ntheir own.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: No, I --",
        "A: -- knew nothing about it at all.",
        "A: No difference. Absolutely nothing. Actually, I was -- I was drafted in 17 -- in -- in June --\nJune 1*', 1942. I was in the Balkans, in the Prinz Eugen division all this time, until September\n1944. In September 194 -- the Soviets broke through Romania into Serbia and their -- our\ndivision was massacred, being put up against the [indecipherable] 90 percent of the personnel we\nlost fighting the Soviets. In that time being in Yugoslavia, I knew nothing, I\u2019d seen nothing about\nconcentration camps. The first concentration camp I did see is on my way to the officers\u2019 school.\nWe were supposed to be -- this was early in January 1945 -- supposed to be in Nuremburg.\nNuremburg was bombed the hell out of on the 11\" and 12\" of January, so we were rerouted\ntowards the end of January to Leitmeritz. And on the way to Leitmeritz in the Czech repu --\nnorthwestern Czech Republic, we are -- there was only one road leading to Leitmeritz, and on the\nright hand side the road was Theresienstadt. And remember sitting in the lorries, about 10 - 20 of\nus in the lorry, and we were told at a certain moment on the road, now you must look to the left,\nyou\u2019re not allowed to look to the right. And army being the army, we looked to the left, but some\nof them, why don\u2019t we look to the left? Because there are Jewish people there, not supposed to --\nyou are not allowed to look at them.",
        "A: I remember that, that was end of January, around 20\" of January, 1945.",
        "A: And that\u2019s when this notion of Jewish people, huh, concentration camp came up in the mind.",
        "A: Right? And then we talked to each other and some of them who had been in the Soviet Union\non the eastern front for several years had come across concentration camp in eastern Europe, in\nPoland, right? And that day they interconnected as ah-ha, this must be a concentration camp.\nOnly eventually did we learn that it was Theresienstadt.",
        "A: But Theresienstadt was a, quote unquote, model concentration camp, to which the Red Cross\ndignitaries were invited, showing them off, even Jewish plays, Jewish theater, Jewish opera,\nJewish musicians and things like that. Nobody talked of the [indecipherable] of the small\nfortress, which was the extermination part of Theresienstadt.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Oh -- oh yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2019m 14.",
        "A: Yeah, 14. 1939, 14.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, first of all, your -- maybe we shouldn\u2019t leave Austria. Don\u2019t forget, my dad was an\nAustrian Royalist Monarchist who was looking down at Hitler.",
        "A: But with the absorption of Austria --",
        "A: Wait, wait.",
        "A: With the absorption of Austria into Germany --",
        "A: -- an impossible combination happened in the mind of one, who was an Austrian Royalist,\nnamely, throughout 800 years of history, Austria had never been subjugated to Germany.",
        "A: And a real Austro-Hungarian would never want any part of Germany, because that\u2019s the way\nhistory was. Either you\u2019re a German -- an Austrian Imperialist, or a German Imperialist, and you\nwill never forget that Bismarck, upon being asked personally by the Kaiser representative in\n1898 if he would concern that Austro-Hungary join Germany, the new Reich in an economic\nunion, said Austro-Hungary will never qualify for a deve -- for an economic union because they\nare an underdeveloped, backward country. A real Austro-Hungarian would never forgive the\nGermans for that. And my father never did. At the same time he said, well, Hitler is Austrian.\nWhy don\u2019t you look at it from the point of view of Austria bringing Germany into the fold?\nRidiculous.",
        "A: How can a little country absorb a huge country and not grow ill over that, right? So ina\ncertain sense my father\u2019s attitude as a Royalist, in my eyes, was compromised. I didn\u2019t know\nhow to explain it then, but I see it today. But at the base of that was my father\u2019s hatred of\nBolshevism, because don\u2019t forget, in the -- in the si -- the trigger for my dad actually was\nreawakening him to the threat of Bolshevism in the -- the civil war in Spain. There is official\nknowledge that they burned about 300 churches, the communists, three major cathedrals,\nviolated at least 10,000 nuns and killed 5,000 priests and bishops. Now, we had no use for\nCatholicism, but as a Christian you would say, if communists can do that in that country, they\u2019re\na threat for all of European civilization, because Spain was part and parcel of western\ncivilization, for the better, worse, the everything, in spite of the horrible things they did in South\nAmerica.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Very, very important.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: You know, you might be asking this question, how about the economics of Hitler? How many\npeople got to support Hitler amongst the previous so-called high bourgeois circles? Because he\nwas jobs, he was economics, he was foreign currency and he was international power. Most of\nthem did.",
        "A: So what place did greed play?",
        "A: Well, I just tell you that, sure. From the Hitlerian policies of full employment, everybody who\nhad suffered from [indecipherable] unemployment would benefit.",
        "A: So the job creation prevailed over -- from the mental principles of morality. Never look\nbeyond the day after tomorrow. Everybody was cashing in, especially on foreign exchange. Even\nthe Jewish people --",
        "A: -- early in the Hitler regime were cashing 1n on foreign exchange.",
        "A: And Hitler forbade them to exchange in foreign exchange dealings, right? Cause he wanted\nthe so-called pure Germans to have full control over foreign exchange [indecipherable |\nsupporting the national interest because the Jewish people would then take the foreign exchange\nand then deposit it abroad, right? So the first distinction, actually racial discrimination, actually\n[indecipherable] openly professed that against the Jews, was [indecipherable] recognition, that\nthe money, foreign exchange, has to be kept at home, and those who sabotage that had to be\nimprisoned or even hanged. So Kristallnacht was just a small example of what was really\nhappening in the background, and that has never been researched. And eventually the Jewish\npeople fell into step, you see? They had to give up their own disposition of foreign exchanges,\nthey had to report like everybody else, but they had lost the trust, because some had been able to\nmanage to deposit substantial dollar accounts, right? So the German Germans got mad, right, and\nwent after them because they were Jews, not because they were capitalist financiers. So the greed\n-- and everyone was on the bandwagon. Land prices were going up, so you bought land prices\ncheap, reselling them at higher values. There were certain guarantees by the Hitler regime. If\nyour direct recourse as a high ranking party member you could that -- get all the financial\nfunding you wanted to get to -- to -- to do this [indecipherable] right? It paid there for bec -- to\nbecome a party member and move up high in the rank because you were a talented foreign\nexchange administrator. You got these medals of this and that and everything else. And with the\ngreed, there was the greed for Jewish accumulations of currency, Jewish accumulations of -- of\nthe fine arts especially, and the disappearance, in a very short period of time, period around --\nwhen was that, 1930 -- 1940 - 1941, of all those very famous [indecipherable] in Berlin, Jewish\nart dealers, right, with the Germans sequestering all that, even though they let go guys like -- like\nRosen-Rosenbaum -- Rosenthal, right? So with that greed, the greed became massive, plunder,\nall the [indecipherable] Jewish properties to start, then the properties of the Polish aristocracy,\nand then looking beyond that, the plundering of westernmost Russia. Great cause for invasion,\nthe invasion wasn\u2019t about eradicating communism. The invasion was the Germans, the -- Hitler\nneeded all the raw materials he could lay his hands on, and whatever world there was, including\nthe -- including the wealth creation in the -- in the Ukraine under -- under top level agricultural\nsoil. Plunder was at the base of it. Typical medieval warfare.",
        "A: And everybody jumped in the bandwagon. My grandmother made a profit [indecipherable]\nthe extra jobs and the extra contracts, right? So the question of morality? Hitler didn\u2019t say he\nwanted all that because he was going to major -- wage a major war. Oh, by the way, have you\nnoticed something interesting? That great courageous, purely racist superior German nation was\nonly winning wars against little countries that were little and totally unarmed. So where is the big\nheroism? Killing all the you -- the Poles in six weeks? The ger -- the Yugoslavs in four weeks?\nHungarians, just walked over, Romania walked over. Big deal. The Frenchies were unprepared,\nright? And they were comparatively a much smaller country, right, smaller industrial capacity\nand that. So what about -- many of the Germans today still claim -- oh my God, I know from the\ntrial, most of the Germans have -- Viel trial, most of the German opinion hasn\u2019t changed.",
        "A: We are a heroic nation, look at us tha -- to some of them, it\u2019s the -- some of the veteran -- we\nwere fighting the whole world. No other nation could have been able to do it. How stupid. But\nnobody knew that in 1938.",
        "A: You know the domino effect? Hitler was the first practitioner of the domino effect --",
        "A: -- the countries that had no problem [indecipherable] sorry, I may have gone off the tangent.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well, the -- first of all Austria, Austria my f --",
        "A: -- my dad -- my dad learned how to live with that. He was a realist, but he sa -- quietly he\nremained an Austrian Imperial [indecipherable] of the Kaiser.",
        "A: And that was that.",
        "A: And openly -- openly, like many others he said, we need Hitler because we can use him. Okay",
        "A: This applies 1940 just as much.",
        "A: Same opinion, the same opinion --",
        "A: -- got even more prevalent because Hitler had brought law and order, he had kicked out the\ncommunists, or imprisoned the communists, or exterminated the communists except for the few\nwho were getting away to the Soviet Union. And the bourge -- bourgeoisie, I think if I can\ngeneralize like that, from my own family\u2019s point of view, they were saying well, at least he has\ngiven us jobs, he has given us law and order and he has given us the perception that the commies\nhave diminished their influence in central Europe, and that the possibility of a Spanish civil war\nreoccurring, destroying the aristocracy and the -- the bourgeoisie -- our bourgeoisie in central\nEurope has been -- has been put to -- brought to a halt.",
        "A: I was never a German watcher, my -- my dream was always to go to Budapest and play the\nfirst fiddle somewhere along the line in Hungarian foreign policy, which would have been a very\ndifficult thing to do because the Hungarians hate the Romanians. The Hungarians hate the\nthought -- my God, the Hungarians hate the Gypsies, and many Hungarians hated the Jewish\npeople.",
        "A: So being a Hungarian diplomat, it may -- may not have been a wise choice at all, on\nhindsight.",
        "A: But that thought is what --",
        "A: -- was my ability to get away from the peasant way of life and don\u2019t forget I had two uncles in\nBudapest and they had very important government posts, so I\u2019d be like in good hands in\nBudapest.",
        "A: And my father always said [speaks foreign language here] You have got to become a\nsomebody, you\u2019ve got to become a somebody because you are number one, right, after the war\nand I said -- well I\u2019ve already mentioned that to you, see. And before the war, to become a\nnumber one [indecipherable] you had to go to Budapest, which was the capital city closest to\n[indecipherable]. And then it was hort -- Horthy was, for me, until 1944, when the\n[indecipherable] replaced him, a person that I could trust because he had [indecipherable] of B\u00e9la\nKun, he had provided Hungary with enough economic benefits for association with the Germans\nand the re-association with the Austrians. And he also kept the riffraff, Romanian riffraff and\nthings like that kind of at bay. So I could live with the system.",
        "A: Before that Yugoslavia comes in, don\u2019t forget please, April 1941.",
        "A: That changed everything. The real -- that -- the German attack on northern Yugoslavia and\nthe marching through Romania demonstrated to me that the German power was overwhelming\nand it couldn\u2019t care less about the individualism and the natural character of the smaller nation.\nThey would just march in, right, occupy them and brutalize them. And with the first hanging of\nthese dozens and dozens of Serbs, and letting them be hanging there on the market for days and\ndays and days, demonstrate to me that there was something about the Germans that you had to be\nfrightened of.",
        "A: But the only way -- I became in that sense anti-Nazi -- anti-German German.",
        "A: But that was no different because most Austrians throughout the history were anti-German,\nright? But --",
        "A: -- the feeling that f -- the feeling strengthened to me. So I was looking at Budapest even more,\nsaying that the Serbs had been defeated, they have become impotent, where else can I go? I'd -- I\nwas just about to finish my high school education so I was hanging onto the dream of going to\nBudapest and shedding this Barcika and Barnard be -- and being in the core country of\nmarginalization. I would have been happy with that. My education was getting to it, and the\ninfluence of Anna Fayish, was a lady the second [indecipherable] that raised me, right, was\nstrictly a -- Baylor, you go to Budapest, you\u2019I|l be okay. And I thought going to Budapest I\u2019d be\nable to kind of hide from all these things. And the first thing you know they drafted me.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Not any more.",
        "A: You see, but don\u2019t -- don\u2019t forget, at that time being an individual still meant something in --\nin -- in -- 1n soci -- societal layers in which you could claim to have some residual rights, if you\nwere V.I.P., cooperating with the Germans. You were guaranteed as long as you cooperated. If\nyou were somebody highly critical of the Germans, or [indecipherable] to the Serbs, they pick\nyou up and shoot you. So -- and there was no in between. You were either there or here. To be in\nthe middle and have no opinion at all would be perhaps true of the peasants who were working.\nIf you were in the bourgeoisie, one way or the other you were visible, right? You were out in the\nopen and you necessarily were expected to wield an opinion. Now, the opinion couldn\u2019t be like --\nI have -- I have not seen 1-in the Barnard where I was living then, any Hungarian leader\nmarching in the street and telling the Germans it is wrong for you to hang all the Serbs. They\nwere keeping their mouth shut. I have never seen a Protestant or a Catholic preacher, priest or\nbishop, and there were several bishops in a large area, going out and telling German\n[indecipherable] German, you mustn\u2019t do that, it\u2019s inhuman. So they were hold their mouth shut\nas far as possible if they had no dependents and linkages with the Germans.",
        "A: But the ones in industry, the ones who were delivering wheat, the ones who were delivering\nthe wines to the Germans, they necessarily were okay under economic advantage.

If the economic survival depends on your -- is the\noutcome of your unwillingness to pinpoint the evil, and come out and say it is wrong. Cause if\nyou had done that, they shoot you.",
        "A: So it was absolute power. I was faced for the first time in my life with this. I didn\u2019t know the\nconcept. I know now the concept of what is absolute power. I\u2019m not saying that absolute power\ncorrupts absolutely. It\u2019s one of the aberrations. But, I was faced with absolute power, and seeling\n-- seeing all those dead ones, the disappearance of the Jewish people, the quiet and furtive\ndisappearance was a -- 0-of lesser significance. Not because they were Jewish people, but\nbecause it was invisible, if right in front of your nose, what horrendous thing the Germans could\ndo. At the same time they were all marching. I remember the black uniforms tn -- in\nMontbachkirche, the t -- main town hall was a great old traditional building, Austrian style.\nBeautiful all kind of statues and beautiful columns and that -- and they were -- the main gate was\nabout 10 feet wide and there was a German black uniform left and right, beautiful blonde, and a -\n- they were handing -- selling [indecipherable] white -- white whatever you call it, a piece of the\nleather strips of that --",
        "A: Absolute power.",
        "A: Okay. Sorry.",
        "A: They looked as an example of absolute power in practice. You were terrified just looking at\nthat.",
        "A: And then some b -- would be partisan Serbs killed one of them. In return Germans rounded up\n200 and hanged them on the following day. Just picking them up in the street of Montbachkirche.\nHang them up on the main square. And then you\u2019re a 17 year old kid, or a 16 year old kid, you\nsay well, what is happening? I know there was one moment in which my brother and I, with all\nthis mixing of things, we put on -- we -- I was able to obtain a little French flag, and I put the\nFrench flag on my lapel because I wasn\u2019t a German, I wasn\u2019t really a Hungarian in Hungary, I\nwas a Hungarian living in the Barnard at that time. I certainly wasn\u2019t a Serb, I don\u2019t want to look\nas a Romanian, which I possibly do. I wanted to say I\u2019m special, I\u2019m French. Trouble is, the\nFrench had already been defeated, so it didn\u2019t really mean much.",
        "A: But it was my brother\u2019s and I kind of demonstration of something that we\u2019re, hey, we\u2019re a bit\ndifferent, right? We are neither this, nor this, nor that. And certainly not German.",
        "A: Oh, he was so happy in the store, the -- because in terms of purchasing power, the -- I\nremember the [indecipherable] store had greater and greater difficulties getting oranges, and\ngetting all the select merchandise because once th-the Germans came in, all these so-called\nnecessities for the bourgeoisie were disappearing, and ration cards were -- ensued, right? So my\nbrother\u2019s concern was how do I help keep a store afloat that has become the meaning in my life?\nAnd how do I get oranges to my lady friend -- lady friend in the old traditional sense, right?\nMaybe touching, maybe [indecipherable] but nothing more than that [indecipherable] the girl\nthat I love, where oranges cannot be any more obtained because of the German embargo on\neverything.",
        "A: You see? So it was looking -- it was looking very miserable, and I told you I had seen him cry\nquite a few times after she disappeared --",
        "A: I was -- well, if apolitical by definition means you have no interest in politics, no.",
        "A: I was surrounded too much by the first indications of absolute terror, not to take time out and\nthink about the consequences. But having nowhere to turn, having nowhere to go, in that\ndesperate situation I was looking more and more at Budapest as my safe haven, sort of imagining\nthat Hitler would never do it to Horthy. And two years later he did. And I remember that the\nGermans established a local police by the name of some kind of a national guard populated or --\nor peopled by Volksdeutsche and the chief of that was a -- a lawyer trained in Dubocka, in the\nadjacent province, a Dr. Wright, who had gotten his PhD [indecipherable] in German, in Nazi\nGermany became -- came back down -- if you look at the typical Nazi, what do you see? A huge\nchin, a small forehead, a big belly, strong legs, eyes bulging forward like that, and cruelty in the\nface. He declared himself general of the police, right. He came to our home in March or April\n1942 and said, Colonel, if you try -- \u2019ve gone on record with that, even in German court --\nColonel, if you try to hide your brother -- your son -- your two sons, you will be declared\nmagaroni. Your sons, don\u2019t try to get them over to Hungary, we\u2019ll hide -- we\u2019ll find them, we\u2019 Il\nput them up against the wall, we\u2019ll shoot them. And made my father shut up. And our name got\nonto the list. And I\u2019m often -- I\u2019ve often wondered, I still wonder, if I had been the father, being\ntold that by a brutal looking Volksdeutsche nobody whose son is a general of the police, what\nwould I have done?",
        "A: He did nothing. He lived through seeing our names put on, then he talked to us, he said, you\nknow, the time has come to let you know that communism has become a threat. Look at all these\npartisans killing all these Germans. You have an obligation going back to the empire, to keep the\n[indecipherable]. And that was that.",
        "A: He gave up on us.",
        "A: He gave up on us, yeah. I [indecipherable] very often, and I\u2019ve often wondered -- and my\nbrother said, absolutely I will not go, and my father said look, if you don\u2019t want the whole\ncatastrophe of the whole family, because Wright was a -- oh Wright was, by the way, c-caught\nby the partisans early in 1945.",
        "A: Irwin Wright, Dr. Wright.",
        "A: The con -- so-called -- self declaimed general [indecipherable] police [indecipherable] were\ncaught and unceremoniously hanged for repeated brutality and -- and crimes against humankind.\nHe personally was involved in many tortures of presumed partisan leaders. I remember those\nstories kind of, kind of. He deserved what he was getting, but it was Wright who really caused\n[indecipherable] my brother\u2019s eventual dying.",
        "A: You see. And -- but again, I -- I\u2019m -- I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m against people ca -- getting some criminal\ntypes and hanging them on the tree, but I think the partisans were absolutely right to hang him.",
        "A: [Il go on official record, I told the German judges that. See, he was -- he was -- he was -- he\nwas -- he was a criminal, not just --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: So, just to let you know that even though I\u2019ve always suffered with this -- this notion that\nsince I don\u2019t have a PhD in philosophy, I\u2019Il never be first class.",
        "A: But at least I\u2019m linked to somebody who is.",
        "A: Okay, we go --",
        "A: Because my father was a visible member of the community, equally at home in the\nHungarians speaking and the German speaking, having a mother who was Austrian German and\ntherefore, by the Hitlerian laws had given offspring to a half German, who had given offspring to\nquarter Germans, because Austria had been absorbed into Germany, had become Germanized,\nand in terms of the racial profile you had to go back seven generations to prove that you were\nAryan, right?",
        "A: We were qualified, classified as half Germans.",
        "A: Wait, wait, wait --",
        "A: -- as half Germans. And since they needed everybody to get the 27,000 Volksdeutsche recruit",
        "A: -- to fill in the numbers of our division, they had to reach out for persons well beyond the pure\nGermanism of the really simple Volksdeutsche, who were a hundred percent Germanic, right?\nAnd since my father was a visible member of the community, going to him, to gave an example -\n- he [indecipherable] Wright was g -- was given example to others --",
        "A: -- who were like of mixed blood, to make sure. And depending on how my father would\nbehave, they would then also fall into step.",
        "A: So my father, as I already mentioned to you, proved that [indecipherable] morally, he said\nyou\u2019re obliged to, because Austria-Hungary was always there to defend western civilization from\nthe [indecipherable] from Asia, right, so the war ca -- secondly the church approves of tha-that,\nthe church demands that, God demands that, and thirdly I\u2019ll tell you, there is no choice, period.\nAnd there was no way out. There was nowhere to go.",
        "A: Ah yes, yes, it was a notice, yeah. After Wright came I think the notice came about a week\nafter, saying that the notice was a formal notice of induction and the notice of you shall present\nyourself -- my brother was, I think, on the first of May and I was on the first of June.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Yeah, in the same division, yeah. It was strictly that the whole Barnard was used for the\nsetting up of the Prince Eugen division, yeah.",
        "A: And the Prince Eugen has very special significance in Austria\u2019s history, because it was he\nwho beat the chur -- the Turks, and expanded the Austrian bi -- b-boundaries to include the --\nthat whole area into Austria-Hungary.",
        "A: Right -- right around the Danube river, beyond where the Romanian boundary 1s today.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Everybody, everybody --",
        "A: -- everybody -- I think actually letters were sent out to those who had better schooling,\nbecause we, the graduates of -- even though I was in Hungarian school -- so it had no business in\nusing me at all, because it was the induction of the Volksdeutsche. The Volksdeutsche were all\nlinked with the Volksdeutsche shul -- schools that were established after the Germans came in,\nand they were established with the Germans in using the -- the Nazi oriented leadership of the\nVolksdeutsche then, to set up German schools following the right German examples. And those\nwho were in that school when [indecipherable] German speaking. I was in Hungarian school and\nthey drafted me even though I was -- and my brother had already finished high school.",
        "A: Yeah, ah -- th-they were -- in their declaration they had to refer to me as Volksdeutsche as\nthey would have had no right whatsoever to draft me.",
        "A: So Iam an honorary Volksdeutsche, declared so by the Hitler regime. Big deal.",
        "A: Spoke some German, but the German was not -- I can show you all my photos, all my photos\nthe back wall -- on th-the back page they have Hungarian language.",
        "A: I knew German, but I was by now means -- I was very far from being -- and I didn't\nunderstand German German. They are completely different [indecipherable]",
        "A: That\u2019s why I was demoted [indecipherable]",
        "A: My brother went first. He was already in the -- he was -- he was forced to go to the artillery\nregiment. I re -- I remember him, remembering visiting when he was in [indecipherable], he was\nabout 80 kilometers above where I was and I remember seeing the -- the barracks where he was.\nHe was inside the barracks, holding on desperately to the steel partitions, looking like the guy,\nI\u2019ve got to get away, I\u2019ve got to get away. And I was cry. And I went with my father, my father\nsaid nothing, just stony face, but I saw in my brother\u2019s eyes that he was so terribly unhappy. He\nran away three times, and he took phone calls from my dad every time and the third time they\nalmost shot him, but then, upon repeated phone calls, they decided they would demote him from\nthe signals into a punishment battalion. And he stayed with that until he died.",
        "A: Punish battalion is a battalion which was set up specifically for those who don\u2019t -- don\u2019t\nperform military duty according to regulations. Those who have been captured trying to escape,\nor known to have been wanting to escape, or those who have been escaped and then captured.\nAnd it\u2019s -- the survival rate was then maybe 10 percent. And I remember my brother\u2019s face, I\nremember my brother\u2019s face, I think he came there when I was visiting also in the -- that was a\nkind of second -- around the 25\"\" of December 1944, when I was being brought up with a couple\nof other officer candidates from these front lines in the Balkans through a little village on the\nDanube river, where he was stationed with his battalion. And I had found out where he was and\nwe saw ourselves maybe for a half an hour and we talked about what can we do, where can we\ngo. And he told me look, you\u2019Il be behind the front, you better go because it\u2019ll save your life.\nAnd he said, as far as I\u2019m concerned there\u2019s nothing I can do because there\u2019s nowhere that I can\nrun to.",
        "A: And I left him there, I -- feeling terribly guilty not -- not to have stayed longer, but we\ncouldn\u2019t stay together longer.",
        "A: Not to stay longer, to -- to find a way out.",
        "A: My main reason for going to officer school was it was safely behind the lines [indecipherable]\nand the chances of survival were 90 percent. I -- I simply had to survive.",
        "A: Well, you can -- no, if they -- they say that you are picked to go, you have to go, but there are\nmany reasons why they would go. Some would fall in the river, say oh thank you very much, I\nwant to die for Hitler, I want to be an officer for Hitler. Others will just stand there, you know,\nsay nothing. Command is a [indecipherable] command, and their system was a command system.",
        "A: I said -- I said nothing, I just said yes. I was actually surprised because I wasn\u2019t fitting in and\nI\u2019d been demoted once for not understanding the German well enough, and yet somehow they, I\ndon\u2019t know --",
        "A: -- oh, you know why they picked me? I had -- I was one of the few remaining who had high\nschool graduation, and by the law of induction into officer training, you were still expect to have\nhad at least high school.",
        "A: And I had happened to have had high school, so they put me into, and there were seven or\neight of us picked.",
        "A: Seven or eight out of 42 graduates, all of whom had perished. All the others had already died.",
        "A: Training?",
        "A: I mentioned to you my love of sports. And I found myself in a nation, in UNRRA\n[indecipherable] bossed around by those eight foot tall Germans with shoulders like that,\nwaistlines like that, legs like that, being able to run a hundred yards in five seconds or at least so\nthey claim. And I said to myself -- oh, by the way, by that time I\u2019d already been called Gypsy,\nBalkanaiser, pork eater, bacon eater, you name it [indecipherable] just because of my looks.\nThere\u2019s something -- and they told me you\u2019ve got to be able to prove something, that you\u2019re\nequal and competitive, at least in something. So I took them on with their marching 10\nkilometers in 40 minutes, with fully -- things loaded, I never lagged behind. In no time -- I\u2019m\nvery [indecipherable] my hands [indecipherable] I was -- in no time I was very, very good at the\nMorse code.",
        "A: Oh, well, I was in signals.",
        "A: Wireless. You see, there were signals wire, telephone, civil Morse code. Oh, I outdid the Volk\nGermans. There was one Volk German guy by the name of -- what was the name? I should know\n[indecipherable]. Anyway, one, the real Volksdeutsche, who terribly wants to be like a\nReichsdeutsche. His hair was [indecipherable] like that, he was reddish blonde, blue eyes, big\nnose sticking out, big shoulders, and [indecipherable] Nicholas his name was. And he always\nsaid, Lally, you\u2019re a magaroni, you just can\u2019t do -- you just can\u2019t to it. And I looked and I said,\nyou know Nicholas, I proved to you that as a magaroni I can do it. So ou -- I beat him every time\nin our speedwriting, in the -- in the signals. That was fun. And I beat him every time in long\nmarches, and I beat him every place else. Here was my personal challenge to prove to me that\neven though in their eyes I was only a Gypsy kind of a looking guy, deep inside myself I was a\nman, I was a human being, you know? And they were all smoking [indecipherable] and they\nwere all womanizing. Our jackets, the military jackets had a small pocket on the inside, inside of\nthe left. Condoms.",
        "A: I have no idea where they bought the condom, but -- so the -- the commanding sergeant\ncomes and says, this weekend you will be allowed to go out. There are two of them in there,\nmake sure that you use them because [Il -- P\u2019Il check on you if you did or not because for the\nfuehrer you\u2019ve got to procreate children. No questions about who the girl will be, no question if\nthey would be willing or not, no question married or not, you\u2019ve got to do it. And I had a --\ngained a good friend, Walter Meyhallowicz, whose grandfather had been Serb, but who had been\nGermanized because of two German mothers marrying into the clan. He was a tall guy, black,\nblack, black, like a Gypsy looking. So we kind of stuck together because we were -- both looked\n[indecipherable] right? So I looked at -- Walter said, what are we going to do with that, he says.\nHe was two years older, I don\u2019t know if he had experience or not. So he said, we\u2019ll find us a new\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: So the sports kept me -- helped me keep myself in good shape, and I was also somehow, even\nthough I\u2019d been raised very pr -- in a very protective environment -- we had a maid, we had a\njunior maid, we had the [indecipherable], the Jack of all trades man. We were not allowed to do\nphysical labor. I was never allowed to go to the kitchen because [indecipherable] all that stuff,\nright? I didn\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t learn how to fend for myself.",
        "A: No, I hadn\u2019t. But then, in the army your rations aren\u2019t really adequate if you want to keep\nyour body in good shape. So somewhere along the line observing others, and there was an older\nVolksdeutsche, a ba -- farmer, who really knew how to find potatoes and things like that, so I\nwas learning very, very quickly. And on the front I always knew how to have a few extra morsels\nof bread in my pocket, like to chew at. And I always knew how to have extra newspapers to wrap\naround my feet, because the German boots were totally pervious to cold [indecipherable] you\nhad frozen feet in no time. But we discovered if you wrap them in paper on top at -- on top of the\nsock, your chances were 90 percent better of not getting your toes freeze -- fro-frozen off.",
        "A: And with that you somehow learned how to handle life, even in the most difficult\ncircumstances. And again, not smoking was a very great contributor to being able to develop\nsome kind of resistance against the terrible cold in Yugoslavia, and then also on the southeastern\nfront; 40 below zero in that, you know? And it -- I had this extra energy also because of the\n[indecipherable] rations. To go through the darkest times and always kind of wanting to show\nthat even though you guys think I\u2019m an untermen -- in my eyes I\u2019m not an untermenschen. I\ndidn't want to prove that I was a Nazi. I would never want to be a Nazi. I didn\u2019t look like one,\nright? Or behave like one. But I wanted to prove I\u2019m a human being, I shouldn\u2019t be looked down\nat.",
        "A: And a very as -- na -- strong motivating factor was that we were compelled to read the \u201cMein\nKampf\u2019. We were compelled to read the what, the f -- the mi -- m-me -- me -- mama -- \u201cThe\nMythos of the 20\" Century,\u201d by Rosenberg, right? And we were compelled to enjoy\nindoctrination every day, all with the same thing, heil Hitler this, heil Hitler that. But they will\nnever have an opportunity to do anything with the brains that we still had for purposes of\nlearning. And somewhere in my mind there was -- an increasing part of my brain had became\ncompletely aloof against their attempts to take my mind over completely and make me\ncompletely embrace their serial ideology. And one of the clinching moments came when the\nofficer investigating my racial purity told me who I would have to get married to. Cause it may\nnot be important to you, it may not be important overall within the context of the Holocaust, but\nsomewhere in my mind there was enough of a defensive mechanism in which the I wanted to be\nme, and in which there was still enough scope left for the brain to fill in the void and to undo the\ndamage caused to the other part, whichever it was, the left or the right.",
        "A: And the killing in the panzergraben was a second major determining for that. You see, I still\nask myself how come I knew, after witnessing all that killing, after losing most of my friends in\nthe war, after witnessing some of the atrocities, including some -- a couple of Germans had their\ngenital parts cut off by partisan female. Another partisan female had a big stick stuck into her\n[indecipherable]. After witnessing all that and becoming completely immune to any perception\nof morality, how come I knew when Viel was doing the killing, that 1t was wrong? But I knew it\nwas wrong, but I was so terribly scared at the same time. I knew it was wrong. I was scared. So I\nwas just petrified. What do you do with that? So, just like my dad when Dr. Wright came, I\ndecided nothing -- I decided I do nothing, because I wanted to survive. And I talked to Rabbi\nPoupko about that, a very senior conservative rabbi in Montreal. I asked him, what would you\nhave done, Rabbi? He |-liked my testimony, he liked my -- he said, Adal -- al -- Lallier, you\nreally have courage. I said, it\u2019s not courage, it is [indecipherable]. Well, I say it\u2019s courage. I say,\nwhat would you have done? He said, in the eyes of the Jewish interpretation of God, one\u2019s own\nlife always comes first. Now, I don\u2019t know if he told me that, if it\u2019s true or not, or if he told me\nthat to appease me, to decrease my pain or my agony, but he told me, you were absolutely right\ntrying to si -- preserve your life, assuming that would have become a creative life. You didn\u2019t\nwant to waste that. And he said, the fact alone that you finally decided to speak up proves that\nyou were right in keeping your mouth shut, because if you hadn\u2019t, they would you put a -- put\nyou up on the spot and shot you. So, good excuse, but I still did nothing.",
        "A: Why didn\u2019t my father try to get us away? Maybe because he wouldn\u2019t have had -- oh who --\nwho -- wh-who -- I don\u2019t know, there were no airplane, there were no flights out. Would have to\nbe -- I don\u2019t know, there were no boats on which to go, we were in the central Europe.

        "A: We were all -- we were given lectures, ideological lectures. Weltanschauung, you can write\nthat down, but the term is well known. Weltanschauung.",
        "A: You know that from philosophy, right. Weltanschauung was an obligatory course throughout\nthe four and a half months training of Pinuna. And the weltanschauung is really teaching us how\nto take the oath of fealty to Hitler, not question anything about that and -- and to exercise com-\ncomplete commitment to the oath, even willingness to die for it.",
        "A: And that was -- we had the physical training -- I -- I liked the physical training. But what I\nliked about the physical training is to find out that I too, coming from the nowhere, could do it\nalmost as well, even better than some of the German Germans did. And that\u2019s where the\nOlympian image rose in my mind, you see.",

        "A: See, in that sense I was an exception. And alone saying Horthy, I was not professing myself\non behalf of Nazism, but Horthy-ism.

No more [indecipherable] 76.\nNo more shoulders like that, waistlines 32, feet like that and [indecipherable] like that and\nblonde and all that. They were taking left, right and center. And more and more of the small\nMediterranean, Gypsy looking types were got -- gotten in. More and more compromising\nadmissions by people of half blood, that first of all, you had to have half blood, then you had to\nhave quarter blood, the-then you said, unless there was a Jewish grandmother you'll be taken\nwhatever your blood com -- blood combination is. But one restriction remained. You shouldn\u2019t\nhave had a Jewish grandmother. And even that restriction was eventually raised, right? O-Or\nerased. But I remember you had to go back seven generations to prove it -- prove that you\u2019re\npure Aryan. But all that -- most of that had fallen by wayside mid-1943.",
        "A: And the existence of the Waffen SS [indecipherable] commissione [indecipherable] was only\n[indecipherable], which even today\u2019s Waffen SS veterans\u2019 paper keeps on emphasizing. They\nhave a publication, every month calling -- calling it \u201cThe Volunteer.\u201d And they still believe that\nfact is a -- a hundred percent of those who have been in the Waffen SS were volunteer.",
        "A: 20 percent were perhaps volunteers.",
        "A: So I was feeling -- I -- no.",
        "A: But I have an American friend who interestingly is somehow enamored with -- a very highly\npositioned federal -- federal employee in the western part of the United States, very highly\npositioned, who had written a history on the milder, non-criminal parts of the Waffen SS, namely\nthe -- the signals formations, and til -- for what I recall, the signal formations never even ever\nraised a weapon against anybody, because my job -- our job was to be there and play with this\nthing. There may have been shooting at [indecipherable] once in awhile. Anyway, he wrote a\nbook about the Waffen SS signals [indecipherable]. And it is from that -- and he asked me to\nread through that, I met him through somebody else. And out of that I retrieved [indecipherable |\ninformation, the list of those who had been in the concentration camps, and I didn\u2019t tell him that,\nit\u2019s none of his business. I mean, I\u2019m free to do with that, unless I want to republish the whole\nthing, in which case I\u2019d have to mention his name, see?",
        "A: But --",
        "A: -- he is an American, he\u2019s -- I find him a bit strange. He is not a Nazi, but he believes a -- he\nfall -- fell for that slogan that the Waffen SS [indecipherable]. I\u2019ve been writing innumerous\nproof to the contrary, but he is an [indecipherable] and -- but he had made a significant\ncontribution exploring a subject, and being able to distinguish the evil ones from the not so\ncommitted ones to the ones who were there against their will, but who somehow seemed to have\nsurvived the war, even though serving against their will or something like that.",
        "A: But he hasn\u2019t written me since my last letter in which I -- I told him, absolutely told him, you\nfinally have to get away from the lie that the Volksdeutsche were volunteers. He would normally\nwrite me four times -- once every four weeks, but I haven\u2019t heard of him for the past eight\nweeks, so maybe he found that my attitude was becoming too pushy [indecipherable] speaking\nthe truth. But he\u2019s an o -- he\u2019s an okay guy. He\u2019s an okay American.",
        "A: And he told me he\u2019s going to vote for -- for Obama, so I don\u2019t know if that makes him more\nokay or not. Sorry?",
        "A: Oh yes. We also -- we had the signals training, we had the ideological training, we had the\nphysical training, which I absolutely was very happy with, and we have the skills training. The --\nall the weapons you can possibly imagine in -- from the pistols, for would be officers eventually,\nit\u2019s essential training. You had the carbine, which carbine question came up during the court,\nbecause I insisted 1t was the [indecipherable] carbine and some of the Nazi Germans counter-\ninsisted that the Waffen SS had never had [indecipherable] carbine, but the judge graciously --\nWinkler, took my explanation, having discovered through some not Nazi experts that they were\nCzech carbines, which we may have been using then, or he may have been able to use. And we\nhad the Mitryettes, and we had especially the Sturmgewehr. Sturmgewehr was a 1944\nproduction, very similar to the Soviet AK 457 which could spit out, I think 57 bullets, smaller\nbullets, in about three seconds, or something like that. And then we had also shooting with --\nwith -- what you call those little pipes? Mortars?",
        "A: And we had grenade shooting and we had special training ones, they became quite frequently\ndistributed, the anti-tank weapons. The Panzerakate and they call it [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, no, no, I was not in an infantry regiment.",
        "A: I was strictly tied to the headquarters of the division communicate -- in communications.",
        "A: Only two times was I engaged in active two week warfare --",
        "A: -- against the Russians.",
        "A: That was -- yeah, again, that was in October 1944, in which we hadn\u2019t really learned -- we\nhad followed the partisans, we had not -- not been engaged at the headquarters level in facing\nany [indecipherable] formations with T -- T34 tanks and the whole bit the Soviets were throwing\nat us, and in three days of fighting we lost 90 percent of everything. We lost 90 percent of our\ntrucks. My truck was the only one to have survived the -- the massacre [indecipherable] because\nI was skillful enough -- I was the driver -- I was skillful enough to hide it behind a church, and I\nwas lucky enough to have escaped being directly shot at by -- I was -- had to cross a bridge, and\nthat -- right to bridge there were dozens of German vehicles destroyed by anti-tank fire, and I\nwas next in line to be shot at. And I had my five guys including my [indecipherable] in the truck,\nand I was driving like a madman, trying to hit the bridge, but before I made a sharp turn, I\ndecided to stop just for a brief moment, I don\u2019t know what made me stop. And at that moment I\nstopped the shot of the anti-tank weapon buzzed by the front of the windshield of the car. And\nthen I just so -- noticed that, they needed about 17 seconds for a second shot and I accelerated\nand got away. I was the only funkwagen who was saved from the whole division. The division\nhad 37 of wireless communication trucks.",
        "A: They all got perished and about 2500 guys died in three days, including a guy by the name of\nLisi, who stuck his neck out in front of the truck, was hit in chest on with the grenade, he just\ndisintegrated.",
        "A: He was one of the very gifted high school graduates and he was a bourgeois son, he was a\nvery nice guy who was -- who was there I think for defending his motherland and his father\u2019s\nproperties from communism, and he was not a Nazi. But Lowd Nicholas was a Nazi.",
        "A: We were trained until for the first of June -- actually, 15\" of June, first of June I was drafted,\n15\" of June we were sent up to [indecipherable] and we were sent back down, totally contrary to\nour expectations because we thought we\u2019d be engaging against the Soviets, they sent us down to\nSerbia to fight the partisans who had by that time become very numerous. Because as you know,\nHitler\u2019s having invaded the Soviet Union, Tito immediately declared war on the Germans under\nhorrendous, horrendous circumstances for the partisans because they were nobodies, they had\nnothing, and yet they survived somehow. Tito is to me a -- a remarkable man, the way he took on\nthe Nazis, but he also let his people suffer because it was because of the odd -- killing of some\nodd German soldier, the Germans were hanging hundreds and hundreds of innocent Serb\ncivilians. And Tito added to power, exterminated the whole Yugoslav -- the whole -- the entire\nYugoslav bourgeoisie. You see, Tito is a major was criminal, but without Tito the war couldn\u2019t\nhave been won the way it has won, so I\u2019m kind of caught in between. One of my big images\nabout that he -- from the war is an image that I retrieved from a book written by one of Tito\u2019s p-\nprimary assistants [indecipherable] Angelis. You may have heard of Milo Angelis. He had a\nbook on wartime memora -- memor -- memor -- memoirs in which on one particular cage --\npage, there is a Serb young man about 18 years old, with a typical Serb cap, dressed like a poor\npeasant, standing under the gallows with that German officers surrounding him. And just before\nhe died, he raised his hand like that, and he died like that. Now, if I ever wanted to have a photo\nover which I\u2019d cry about the absolute courage in the face of actual power, that guy is my hero in\nmy mind. He was a total anti-Nazi, he who died because he believed that what Germans were\ndoing was wrong. Trouble is his death was caused by T-Tito\u2019s partisan killing one or two\nGermans. And this guy was rounded up in a small village chacha and hanged with many of the\nothers.",
        "A: An unforgettable picture.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: No, no, no, I am blaming the Nazis.",
        "A: They had no right to capture the 200, right? At the same time, amongst the 200, there was one\nwho dared raised his fist and tell the Germans face to face before they hanged him, but they\ndidn\u2019t prove merciful. They\u2019re being told [indecipherable] that you\u2019re dead wrong, you\u2019re killers.",
        "A: I should send you that picture, perhaps.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, well, in the -- in the --",
        "A: -- we were the center of communication and our major task was to communicate between the\nvarious parts of the division, the various battalions and regiments about how to arrange the\nwarfare against the partisans.",
        "A: So it was strictly, strictly for two and a half years, from September 1942 to October 1944, we\nwere engaged strictly against the partisans, under murderous circumstances.",
        "A: We had no idea, because we are too far away in the center, no idea what atrocities were being\ncommitted by the various -- by the two regiments, or the two battalions, the various battalions.",
        "A: But we did drive through villages that had been completely destroyed, and we knew that that\nis the price that the Serbs were -- most of the partisans were Serbs, right -- the Serbs were payi --\npaying for what they were trying to do to the Germans and those were the [indecipherable] that\nthe German Nazis were imposing upon them, finding two or three partisan that -- even burn the\nwhole village. And that was a fact of life of war, but that\u2019s the way I -- my interpretation was,\nthat is what the war is about. But deep inside myself I always knew that the Germans had no\nbusiness being in the Balkans, because I had carried forward, for me, the recognition when the\nGermans occupied Austria, it was upsetting history upside-down. The Germans had no business\nbeing in Austria, but the fact is, 1t was absolute power and I\u2019d become part and parcel of the\nabsolute power. So in a certain sense I was directly underwriting the absolute power by\ncommunicating messages.",
        "A: But since I didn\u2019t see the destruction and dying in front of my eyes, this -- I kind of -- th-they\nremained kind of aloof of that. So I was only a communicator and not an executor. But all of that\ncame forcefully, right in front of my eyes because of Viel and his killing in the panzergraben.",
        "A: Yeah, one th -- one -- one becomes -- you see one death your -- you vom -- excuse me, you --\nyou vomit.",
        "A: You see two de -- two dead, you vomit maybe a couple of times later. You see 10 dead --",
        "A: -- you have a look and say, well [indecipherable] this 1s my friend. And if the friend is still\nalive, you quickly go there and hope that you can talk to him or soothe him, or talk to him or his\nmother or something like that to make him die in peace. If you see a hundred dead, hanging,\nwhich I had before they drafted me --",
        "A: -- you'd see, well, if these were my people, what would I do with them? I\u2019d take them off the\nhangers, I suppose and I\u2019d give them a decent burial, that\u2019s all that we can do.",
        "A: What happened to all those people in the church, burned to the stake, who felt that it was\nwrong? They had no choice just to bury them quietly, didn\u2019t they? I\u2019m not absolving Nazis of\ntheir guilt.",
        "A: But the hanging, the burning, how far back does that go into history? And why would an\neducated nation like the Germans, the highest proportion of PhDs of any of the nations of that\ntime, follow a pattern of medieval savagery? How does one explain that?",
        "A: Yeah, well, well -- well --",
        "A: Yeah, I was in the Waffen SS --",
        "A: -- but please don\u2019t forget, the Waffen SS was the seventh division.",
        "A: We still were given the Waffen SS blood group tattooed in.",
        "A: But we were never given a Waffen SS number, because to be truly a Waffen SS officer, you\nhave to have your number.",
        "A: So if you would call that a gross act of discrimination, call it that. I don\u2019t view it like that,\nonly [indecipherable] say it as a proof, they needed cannon fodder --",
        "A: -- they got the cannon fodder by force, without giving them equal legal protection. They had\neven promised German citizenship. None of the surviving members of the Prince Eugen got the\ncitizenship unless they qualified by living in Germany after the war for five years. So did they\ntreat the [indecipherable] as untermenschen? I want to go on official record, they treated the --\nReichs Germans treated the Volksdeutsche definitely as untermenschen and repeatedly called\nthem speck-fresser, bacon eaters and sigoina and balkinazer, including myself. And it was so bad\nthat the highest commander with -- of the Waffen SS, the SS [indecipherable] haupter eventually\nhad to pass an order all the way down asking the officers to finally put a stop to these\ndiscriminating references to the Volksdeutsche. And why that command? Because they still had\na hundred thousand Volksdeutsche that they haven\u2019t drafted yet and that they didn\u2019t want to lose.\nThe bodies, they were needed to fight th-the Soviets in the conditions of increasing despair.",
        "A: Well, I was promoted with everybody else, first to Sturmin and then to [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t promoted out of ranks. Actually, my first promotion, so-called, was delayed because\nafter they were sent down -- I was very good in signaling, in my Morse codes, so I was picked to\nbe amongst the first group to be sent on to Serbia. And I was standing -- like I was sent on two\nweeks before the second group was to follow, it was a stage, kind of transportation of troops,\n20,000 plus men. And I was up standing night guard over my teraf -- my -- my -- my Morse code\nmachine, and suddenly a phone call came in by somebody with a guttural German and gave me a\ncommand that I didn\u2019t understand. And you can\u2019t say, excuse me please, would you repeat that?\nAnd I said, Jawohl, and I did nothing. The following day the sergeant in charge called me and\nsays, Lallier, as of immediately, you are demoted to become a muli-fuehrer. A muli-fuehrer was\na -- a mule attendant. So, with my glorious knowl-knowledge of m -- the Morse codes, whatever\nthey would be, it would have been useful, I found myself in a stall with about 300 mult -- mules\nand mule attendants, about 30 of them, none of them having finished even elementary school. All\nof them having great hands, great backs, great understanding of their -- of their animals, but I\nmust maybe worriedly say, because it sound like discrimination, not much of a developed brain\npower.\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I was a SS man while being a muli-fuehrer.",
        "A: There was no promotion. If you\u2019re a muli-fuehrer you get no promotion.",
        "A: Until November 1942. And then they picked me up because they thought I may have some\nbrains because they must have looked at my high school certificate graduate [indecipherable] so\nput me into training as a truck driver.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I was in the Balkans.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, there was no --",
        "A: -- no, we were --",
        "A: -- so busy fighting the Titoists who were becoming more and more numerous because of the\nGerman stupid policies of fighting the whole population. We had the position like in Iraq. In ord\n-- in -- in order to -- instead of making the population love you by being good to them and not\nhanging them, they did exactly the opposite, right? It became slow work, and the German\ncommand always referred to the partisans as bandits. Bandits who are f -- waging illegal warfare,\ntotally contrary to international agreements, right?",
        "A: And disagreement about the bandits, international, goes back about 150 years, without the\nquestion ever being asked first, well what are the countries doing in those countries in which\nthese bandits emerged in the first place.",
        "A: Iam very concerned about, you know, international diplomacy, because that thing about\nbanditry in occupied countries is a direct consequence of the imperial party -- including\n[indecipherable] Austria-Hungary, having conspired to look at local uprises against foreign\ndomination as an illegal act at the mercy of countries that occupied the country. It\u2019s not right.",
        "A: Anyway, so we were there fighting the partisans, totally pursuing this Iraqi type of policy, I\nmust say honestly in -- in Iraq and -- and in a -- and in a -- in -- in Vietnam formerly, and it was\nhopeless because the more you hang the more young people would say, we don\u2019t want these\nbloody bastards and we were part and parcel of the bastards. So eventually we had to keep on\nretreating, retreating and treating because the Germans were doing badly, justifiably so, and the\nSoviets finally, the U-Ukrainian front, about three million men broke through 150,000 German\nline, some of it being kept open by the Prince Eugen, two or 3,000 remaining men, so we were\nretreating like mad. I still had my -- my communication truck. I was taking care of the truck\nbecause if you have a truck you can get away much faster than running for your life.",
        "A: So slowly but steadily we moved towards Croatia, the then Croatia, today Croatia. And once\nwe reached the rina dri -- th-the river Drina, I got the call with the six other guys from the\nremnants of the graduates, the high school graduates that we\u2019ll be commanded as of tomorrow to\ngo through Vienna to Nuremberg to officers\u2019 school. Oh, I never got any medals, by the way.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I was -- yeah, I was picked up, this was mid-December 1944, on the -- on taking back.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Don\u2019t forget -- no, no, no --",
        "A: -- don\u2019t forget, we were fighting the Soviets --",
        "A: -- we were being heavily decimated.",
        "A: There were only six or seven high school graduates left. The German officers corps in the\nWaffen SS was heavily depleted --",
        "A: -- by all those [indecipherable]. So they needed any garbage. And for the first time they\ndeclared themselves that even Volksdeutsche so-called, an honorary Volksdeutsche would be\npicked --",
        "A: -- as possible candidate, but they were put in through the first phase very rigorously is to sort\nthem out, if they would found -- be found unqualified to become German officers, right?",
        "A: And so I was one of the six or seven.",
        "A: Well, yeah, th-they call it cadet school.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, the cadet school was supposed to have been in Nuremberg, so we took -- we took a train\nride from Croatia through Zagreb to Vienna, from Vienna to Nuremberg. We arrived in\nNuremberg two days after 2,000 allied planes had bombed the whole city to the smithereens,\nkilling 35,000 unsuspecting pro-Nazi Nurembergese, right? And we stayed there for two days\npicking up -- they used phosphor bombs. Would you want to know what a body looks like after it\ngot burned up? No, I wouldn\u2019t -- I'll tell you. Facial features remain exactly the same except they\nare charcoal black.",
        "A: And the bodies are [indecipherable]. So we were picking them by the thousands and putting\nthem into a pyre and burning eventually to the -- into ashes.",
        "A: And after two days the clearance came. Oh, they also dropped the bomb and a -- an air mine,\nwhich was a new invention. An air mine can destroy by air pressure, a thousand people in an area\nof about 100 square feet, and they dropped an air mine onto the SS luncheon barracks.",
        "A: There were about a thousand SS personnel and all of them died with their eyes blown out of\ntheir heads because of the air pressure, and we had to clean up that mess. Anyway, the -- we\nweren\u2019t in the area, that was two days before. And then we were told we would go by lorry from\nNuremberg directly into Chekia to go to Leitmeritz, because the officers\u2019 school, including the\nfirst stage, namely the cadet qualification part would have been delodged from Nuremberg,\nwhich was totally destroyed, to Leitmeritz, which was safely in the background from all\nactivities, even though the Soviets had broken through, they were still 200 kilometers away. So\nWalter and I, he was in the group, he looked at me and I looked at him, says, gee, we\u2019 lI finally be\nsafe. We'll finally survive. And then, on the way over, about 12 kilometers outside of Leitmeritz\non the -- still on the western side, the [indecipherable] from the west, suddenly we\u2019re told, augen\nnach links. Eyes to the left. Varoon, why? Juden -- I remember the off suf -- off sub officer --",
        "A: Yeah, just said Juden. [speaks German here]. You are not allowed to look. To retain our\npurity as Aryan officer candidates, I suppose, right? You mustn\u2019t look at the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well yes, but not the real Waffen SS. The concentration camp guards, not Waffen SS, they\nwere special guards, if you know the SS [indecipherable]",
        "A: But there were Waffen SS personnel --",
        "A: -- amongst them who had been wounded, who had even volunteered, or who had been\notherwise assigned in administrative posts. If you go through the lists you will discover that,\nright, right?",
        "A: So I -- I beg your pardon ma\u2019am, SS, concentration camp guards were members of the\nAllgemeine SS.",
        "A: The Waffen SS were supposedly, 99 percent of the time, 99 percent of their -- of their per --\npresence as soldiers, preoccupied to fight in the east and the west.",
        "A: But about 600 of them over the course of the three, four years of the war did do service in the\nconcentration camps.",
        "A: And we went directly to the officers\u2019 school, and the first time it hits us, Juden, the question\ncame up between Walter and I, what\u2019s that? And being young men who had survived three years\nof partisan warfare, we\u2019d say [indecipherable] Juden? Why aren\u2019t we allowed to look? And we\narrived in Leitmeritz with that question, and eventually -- that was end of January 1945.",
        "A: By mid-March we knew.",
        "A: The concentration camp.",
        "A: Because on the 18\" of March, we arise in the morning at five o\u2019clock and told, you are going\nto go on guard duty, eight to nine kilometers away. You\u2019ve got to line up immediately with\nweapons which we will distribute to you, because weapons were not generally distributed unless\nyou were on the front lines, right, we\u2019 ll give the weapons to you, we will board the lorries and\nwe'll drive westward to pick up prisoners. And after driving for about three-quarters of an hour\nwe suddenly see a fortress-like building. Manifesto, small fortress. And all kinds of activities in\nfront around six -- 6:30 in the morning on the 18\", right? And Waffen -- and SS guards coming\nout and prisoners -- and prisoner of war coming out. I think all of them, with the Jewish and --\nyou see, and then we said to ourself, what\u2019s that? And then Viel, who was our commanding\nofficer, concentration camp Theresienstadt, our duty is to supervise 1500 to 2,000 inmates\ndigging an anti-tank ditch, which the high command thought would have to be dug to hold back\nthe Soviet tanks from a breakthrough. Suddenly, two things realized upon us. Number one, we\nhad to supervise prisoners, which is not what officers are trained to do. Officer training is to\nbecome officers to fight the commies. Not being [indecipherable] you looked at those people\nthey were ragged, they were kind of -- th-th-th--their -- their -- their -- to -- clothing was kind of\nall torn up, they were starving looking, they were t-totally inwarded looking. They were kind --\nbarely able to walk. And we were -- forgive me for saying that -- we were representatives of a\nmighty ideology, right, fighting the communists and that, we should be on the front. And serious\nquestions were raised, but you were given the command, so they were coming out, 1500 to 2,000\nof them and we were si -- surrounded and marched with them where the commanding officer was\n-- told him to march. Concentration camp, for the first time. And only then did we know that\nthere were actually two concentration camps, Theresienstadt, the model camp, which the\nGermans were showing off to the Red Cross volunteers.",
        "A: And the smaller --",
        "A: Well -- well --",
        "A: -- get technical now. All I remember is that I had read a book by a guy name of Adler, who\nwas in Theresienstadt, who was able to survive that, who wrote a couple of chapters in the book,\n\u201cTheresienstadt\u201d --",
        "A: -- areference to the Red Cross commissioners being told and being displayed the Jewish\npeople happy like a lark. And -- but we didn\u2019t know about that. But what we did know is that\nthere was the Theresienstadt with about 10 to 15 thousand persons and the kleine feste with two\nto 2,000 to 2,500. And the kleine feste, one rumor had it, were destined to be exterminated, but\nthey also contained non-Jewish people. Some Soviet prisoner of war who had gotten -- got even\nsome Britishers, I also understand even an Australian was locked up in the kleine feste. Anyway,\nit was the killing grounds, and it is those people that we are to supervise. So we did. On the first\nday nothing untoward happened. They had equipment, it is not true that they did it with their\nhands and -- and then [indecipherable] had the appropriate shovels and that, but we were spaced\nevery 20 meters on both sides of the ditch, get -- becoming deeper and deeper. But on the second\nday we were brought back and that\u2019s at -- now, lunch at two o\u2019clock, Viel suddenly started\nshooting, where I was standing.",
        "A: Ah, yeah. We were -- we had talked about the service [indecipherable] guard service, and\nvery, very unhappy because some of the soldiers claimed they had gotten medals of heroism\nfighting the commies and that and suddenly they\u2019re only prison guards. It was not compatible\nwhich wa -- what we thought was the eth -- ethics of the international recognized ethical form of\nbehavioral officers. But we didn\u2019t ask any questions. The questions would be asked on the\nfollowing day in the evening when, after having witnessed and/or heard the killing and pointed at\nViel through the testimony of at least two of us, we decided getting back to Leitmeritz, to the\nhigh school for girls where we were stationed with the preliminary station of the officers\u2019 school,\nwhen we decided to send a delegation to the commanding officer, and not demanding, asking for\nan explanation.\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: So in the training, you know --",
        "A: -- th-the cadet stage of officer training, we had weapons training, specialized weapons, the\nnew Sturmgewehr, which is the assault weapons, I\u2019ve mentioned them to you. And -- but we\neach had to learn how to. We had training with bazookas because the Soviets had been breaking\nthrough, the tanks -- we didn\u2019t have me -- Germans didn\u2019t have enough tanks left. And since they\nhad broken through the Carpathians the bazookas were our last means of defense and the\nbazookas were the long, long pipes, as well as the Panzerfausts, we learned that. And we were\nalso being taught officers\u2019 strategy in military tactics at the lowest possible level. That is, we\nwere being elevated to recognizing that being a soldier is not quite like being an officer. An\nofficer has to provide leadership. We\u2019ve given -- we were given ideological education, not any\nmore Nazi ideology, but repeatedly they emphasized respect for international law, respect for\nwarli -- war making practices, respect for war cri -- no, disrespect for war criminality. We were\ntold that an officer\u2019s duty is to prevent war criminal act from happening, right, and an officer will\neventually get married and become a noble representative of a new Germany, no more Nazi\nGermany, right?",
        "A: All that in the perio -- yeah, in the prem -- between January and end of March 1945.",
        "A: And this they say. And we also had, because we were being trained to become eventually,\nmembers of the officers\u2019 school for signals officers, we were being given technical education.\nWe had to bypass some very serious technical questions concerning telecommunications,\ncommunications and radio wireless equipment, right? And that\u2019s where mathematics came in,\nright?",
        "A: So I was able to handle that, right? Not because of Nazism, it was strictly a profession, right?\nSo -- and all that within the context of most of us having been happy not to be on the front any\nmore, but having higher chances of survival, as was indicated by the dislodging of certain other\nofficers\u2019 school to safer and safer areas, right? So we were all trying to hang on, I was trying to\nhang on, I didn\u2019t want to fail and be sent back, which happened to several of us, right? In the --\nWalter Meyhollowicz failed. He couldn\u2019t handle it any more because I think he was so big he\nwould have needed 300 orders of potatoes, he was starving. So he failed the exam, was sent\naway to the front, the Soviets captured him. He spent 10 years as a prisoner of war in the Soviet\nUnion, and somehow managed surviving, can you imagine that? Anyway, so -- and then\nsuddenly we found ourselves on the second day witnessing a plain act of murder. We got\ntogether -- sh-sh-sh -- in the evening, and --",
        "A: I-PIl -- 1\u2019ll come back --",
        "A: -- to -- one minute, Joan, let me just finish this.",
        "A: So, and Barouka Kuno, a fair minded soldier, he was not a Nazi, he was from the tri -- he was\na Sudetendeutsche.",
        "A: He was one of the three who was sent to present his petition to the commanding officer of the\nschool, and we\u2019d get the answer two days later. Now, I'll stop here, P\u2019Il go back. Okay, so on the\nsecond day we went back, we were brought by white truck. A number of prisoners, we didn\u2019t\ncount them, I estimate between 1500 to 2,000. At the same time the ti -- the ditch was supposed\nto be two kilometers long. Now, two kilometers long is 2,000 meters. If you have 2,000 prisoners\nhalf starving, how can they possibly dig with just to shovel one meters worth of 20 meters across\nand up to two meters deep? So something -- my numbers may not be correct, or maybe the\nGermans were thinking that these guys were ready to work their butts off, hoping to survive.\nAnyway, SO we were again posted every 20 meters. I was on the right hand side, another guy was\non the left hand side [indecipherable] both sides, and we had the weapons in our hands, and just\nwatching them. Now, I was very close to a group of seven, and one of the seven -- like, they\nwere a bit separate from the others, and the ditch was maybe about a meter deep, something like\nthat, but unequally so. And the officer group was standing a bit higher up, about 20 meters away,\nwith Viel among them, including the commanding officer of the school, and they were kind of\nchatting and looking and chatting and I was standing. I had to look this way, not that way,\nbecause once you\u2019re told where to guard your post you couldn\u2019t move even a foot of that. And if\nyou had to make a pee you have to ask for permission to leave or to turn around. And suddenly I\n-- I noticed that big, big guy with a big dark red beard, and just urging the others on to work, to\nwork, to work. And one of the guys was -- the first one who got killed was a tiny little guy,\nalmost no face left, like blue eyes, a little sparse hair, no chest, barely moving, t-tiny, maybe\naround 50-ish. And suddenly, I look -- I look at that, I hear something, there is Viel. Oh, we had\nput our weapons away for lunch, then we got our weapons back, but there were still some\npyramids there because lunches were taken in sequence. So Viel goes to a pyramid, grabs a rifle,\nand there could be more than three, could be four or five. So one of the witnesses said oh, when\nyou grab a rifle of the three, the others four fall down. He took one of the four or five, stood up\nstraight, aimed that and I said to myself, what -- wh -- I didn\u2019t know the word what the hell is\nhappening, excuse me, what\u2019s happening. And I said, well maybe he\u2019s just limbering up or\nsomething. It was a muddy day for -- you know, springtime, mud in the river -- gri -- ditch.\nRaises the weapon and aims towards me. I didn\u2019t even duck because I said, what will -- and\nsuddenly, he aims -- it doesn\u2019t take long to aim. And so I hear the shot and the little guy just falls\ndown. Didn\u2019t even just hear the pop, falls down. He kind of fell down forward, and the military\nlaw is, if you hit the chest or the heart, you always fall forward, you never fall backward. Okay,\nso second shot, second guy falls down. And then a third shot, the big guy. And the big guy had\nstood up straight and he was looking at the officer, and the officer was looking at him. The big\nguy had the shovel, the officer had the gun. So the officer pulled the trigger, hits the big guy, the\nbig guy falls down, stands up, raises his hand. Viel aims, shoots the second time, the big guy\nfalls down. Stands up -- no more raised arm, stands up, still keeps on staring at Viel. Big guy.\nLegs like that. He must have been a capo because he looked better fed than the other guys. Viel,\nthird time, plomp. Was in the face, whatever, fall down in the mud. Three shots, plus two shots,\nfive shots, three dead guys. Foosh. Five shots. Carbine is not empty yet. Keeps on shooting, all\nthe seven guys dead. He missed one shot, right? Puts the gun back, the carbine, goes back to the\n[indecipherable]. The officers had looked, turned around, joined the group, continued the\ndiscussion. Seven dead guys. A little while later, I\u2019m standing there, I\u2019m looking at the\n[indecipherable] I\u2019m looking at the guy behind me, in front of me [indecipherable] the thing.\nWhat the -- what -- what happened? What happened? Deep inside myself I was like a stone.\nUnable to bel -- unable to think. Wha -- I thought I\u2019d a -- I had an active mind, my mind never\nfalls asleep. I just -- petrified. I had never seen a dead Jew in my life. Suddenly I see seven dead\nJew -- I never wanted to see a dead Jew. That\u2019s not why I was in war. All I was in war, to keep\nthe commies off central Europe. Some of the commies were Jewish commissars. There was, as\nyou well know, Hitler\u2019s personal command to kill the Jewish commissars, right? Never seen one,\nalive or dead. There were seven Jews. Say nothing, continue my guard duty. Didn\u2019t di -- don\u2019t\nstep off the thing, cause you\u2019re not allowed. But -- I hear a noise. A two wheeler. A death cart.\nTypical of concentration camps, I found later on. Okay? Four guys were pushing, prisoners,\nJewish, death guard -- 1t s-seemed like standard procedure. They\u2019d appeared from the nowhere,\nthey were coming closer and closer, nobody touched them, nobody told them anything. Came to\nthe ditch -- went to the ditch, put the cart -- I think they even got it somehow into the ditch and\ngrabbed the little guy who had died first, no problem, two guys lift him up, bango on the\n[indecipherable]. Grabbed the second guy -- they needed all four of them to lift up the heavy\nguy. They had problems lifting up the heavy guy, so finally the [indecipherable] got him and the\none, two three, all seven, turned the cart around, marched away. Death cart. Standard instrument\nof picking up the dead during the Nazi regime. Now, not even the commies in the Spanish Civil\nWar were doing things like that.",
        "A: So, we were officer candidates. We had been told repeatedly, abide by international law\nconcerning warfare, abide by this, abide by that. The rules -- an officer\u2019s thing is to prevent\nthings like that happening. My own leader of inspection did the killing. And it was my own, I\nwas part of the officers\u2019 school.",
        "A: Why did he do it?",
        "A: Was he a German German? Was he a Nazi German? Had he lost his mind? Or, my\n[indecipherable] finale -- my latest conclusion; he had been so brainwashed by his own system\nthat we [indecipherable] because he had been made officer in the Dachau camp in 1938 -- he had\nbeen so brainwashed to have believed, like many Nazis, they had become master of life or death\nof the untermensche, and that he was responsible to no one. And the tragedy over that is\nevidently the tragedy of seven dead Jewish people, innocent as they were, especially, but tragedy\nthat nobody brought it to trial. Two days later, the officer of commanding school said, what has\nhappened, has happened. If you survive the war, if you win the war, we are not accountable. If\nyou lose the war, you\u2019re going to be dead anyway. So you got away scot-free. And we in our\ndeep ourselves, including Barouka, who claimed in Ravensburg that he had been in the hospital,\nhe had never been there, and the judge accused him -- accused him of lying directly into the face\nof modern German democratic law, right? Even Barouka said it was wrong, what had happened.",
        "A: This is no -- Barouka Kuno, one of the witnesses --",
        "A: -- who was quite close to me. He was a decent guy. I was counting on him to back me up.\nSuddenly he looks at me, he says, Lallier, you were a traitor. This never happened. So -- so, we\nwent through the last four weeks of the war, totally, totally having -- I had totally lost belief in\nany trace of humanity on the part of the Germans. So just look at the sequence. Hanging all those\nSerbs. Massacring the partisan women. There was one more [indecipherable] massacring the\npartisan women. Anyway, I\u2019Il -- Pll become -- come to they murdered -- killing -- oh, t-talking\nabout human rights and that. And that -- oh yes, killing all kinds of partisan, burning the villages,\nand then seeing this guy killing seven unarmed, half starved people in their tattered rags, could\nonly have meant that the guy had suffered dementia, which is legally excusable, they put a guy\nlike that in a nuthouse, right? Or the ultimate evil condition of believing that his destiny was to\nbe the ultimate judge over the life or death of people, especially [indecipherable] defenseless\npeople. So he, to me -- Viel was the -- remains the ultimate example of the evil that the Nazi\nsystem can inculcate in human minds, making them believe at the individual level that not only\nAdolf, but they as their emissaries had the right to kill on sight, without being accountable to\nanybody. Now, counter argument, as I learned from the critics at Ravensburg, a Waffen SS\nofficer will never do a killing like that unless he\u2019s ordered to.",
        "A: The defense lawyer. Now, he raised the question that was Viel ordered by the superior\nofficers in -- still living in Prague to do the killing to find out how the cadets would react. Would\nthey react like true Nazis and clap? Or would those be weeded out who may have negative\ninclinations. Because the SS officer corps will need to have undoubtedly component members\nwho are ultimate Nazis to whom what Hitler says is the absolute right. I have no answer to that\nbecause the commanding officer eventually lost his life, the last day of the war in Prague, but the\nquestion was raised at the court, you see?",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Yes. yes.",
        "A: Because in all armies, if the order is given, you have no choice but to do it.",
        "A: Including the American Army.",
        "A: Please look at Vietnam.",
        "A: I want to look at Vietnam.",
        "A: I would say that in the German order --",
        "A: -- of military conduct, and war conduct, the order has to come from a superior officer, period.",
        "A: We were questioning --",
        "A: We were -- I say, there were two choices.",
        "A: A war crime?",
        "A: War crime is what Viel did to those seven Jews, that\u2019s a war crime.",
        "A: I can\u2019t give you a purer, clearer --",
        "A: -- definition of war crime.",
        "A: That\u2019s a -- from Jan -- end of January to mid-March.",
        "A: That war crimes -- an office -- an officer\u2019s duty, to prevent --",
        "A: -- any [indecipherable] from committing a war crime.",
        "A: He, in our eyes was committing what we would today call a war crime.",
        "A: At that time I called 1t murder.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Well, no.",
        "A: No. A -- a war crime is a murder in a situation in which a war is properly conducted 1n the\nJudeo-Christian interpretation, according to the laws of Judeo-Christianity, in which you kind of\ngo contrary to the laws and do the killing, even though the war crime legal setting would not\nallow you to, or not order you to.",
        "A: Well that, yes.",
        "A: It was a wholesale -- I was going to conclude that particular example, and the hangings in\nYugoslavia, and that partisan little woman, and the others who were -- oh yeah, the hero, my\nlittle Serbian hero, were an expression of the endemic attitude of the German Nazis to kill on\nsight without any feelings of accountability.",
        "A: And -- and that\u2019s what I finally believe and that is why I have difficulties with the modern\nGerman system, because at court most of them doubted my honesty of the testimony. Most of\nthem called me a traitor. Now, what is that an indication of?",
        "A: They\u2019re trying to white -- they were trying to whitewash poor Viel.",
        "A: Yeah. By the Brits.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I -- I prudently arranged to be captured by the Brits.",
        "A: Because they were closest to my home.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Not only him.",
        "A: Also to the -- to the s -- C.I.C. guy Brown, Major Brown [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- and also to the -- to general -- two star American General Wood at the UNRRA in Vienna,\nand also to my personal self-appointed confessor, the abbot of the Benedictine monastery, yeah.",
        "A: I told one, two, three, four people, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I was -- the first one that I talked to --",
        "A: -- I was waiter. The first one, the -- the Brit was in the summer 1945, I was 20 plus three\nmonths.",
        "A: And by that time I had confirmed my first feeling that I experienced while I was looking at\nthe killing.",
        "A: That it was wrong.",
        "A: Now, wrong means, in the strict sense of definitions, war crime.",
        "A: Crime against humanity is even better.",
        "A: That came at the moment if I were -- in which I suddenly matured into recognizing that all the\nprevious moments --",
        "A: -- were exactly the same.",
        "A: Endemic. You know the term endemic?",
        "A: I\u2019ve been learning English all my life, I --",
        "A: -- endemic to the Nazi Germans.",
        "A: Should I say to the Germans?",
        "A: Because we now have to have full understanding --",
        "A: -- that the Germans suffered under Hitler, right?",
        "A: They were the major people suffered under Hitler, right?",
        "A: They hated him.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Why didn\u2019t the ju -- why didn't the judge in Ravensburg lock up the seven or eight who said I\nwas lying?",
        "A: Please [indecipherable] mine idea is not speaking the truth in front of court --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, October 1951.",
        "A: The gassing?",
        "A: Why are we suddenly stopping the war crimes?",
        "A: You will? You promise?",
        "A: Very -- I was working -- I was working, I didn\u2019t know about the gassing until I finally got\nhold of the Vienna [indecipherable] in which 1940 -- when was the Vienna [indecipherable]? I\nwas in a POW -- no, actually, I found out in the pre -- British POW camp, in the course of the\nwinter 1945. There was a Jewish guy who had worn a British uniform, who went around -- it was\nan officers\u2019 camp, actually.",
        "A: Went around in Graz, Wetzelsberg, okay? And I wa -- have to tell you about that too. Very\nclose to Tito Yugoslavia and very close to the Brits being terribly worried that Tito is -- will o-\noccupy that part of Austria and declare them Europea -- the Yugoslav sovereign territory\ncommunist, and the Brits didn\u2019t want any of that. So what did they do? They fed us -- made us\ndo all kinds of military and non-military exercises, even told us -- not me specifically, there were\nsenior officers that they\u2019d have to keep us physically ready to once again take up fighting against\nthe Tito, and brother did we ever hate Tito. Giving us the weapons to get Tito\u2019s attempts to come\nto the north and push him all the way back. So we had a pretty good time learning English at the\nsame time. And I say those British officers were wise officers, and the one who went around\nasking was a Jewish Austrian who went around wanting to know if any of us had been to a\nconcentration camp, and if anyone\u2019s of -- of -- had ever seen people, Jewish people being gassed.",
        "A: Now, I don\u2019t know what the others told them, but I could only tell him that I myself never did\nsee because I was never close enough in the Polish area where those things were happening.",
        "A: Yes, that was news to me to hear and it only confirmed -- the term endemic is very late in my\nlife.",
        "A: But I would now say it only confirmed what I was getting the impression then, Nazi Germany\nwas about. The absolute right to kill or gas, without accou -- without accountability.",
        "A: And they were a Christian nation, equally Catholic and Protestant, which in itself raises many\nother questions. They were not all mitleifer, you know the term mitleifer?",
        "A: In Denazification a key term that excused you for having been a major con -- mitleifer is one\nwho happily --",
        "A: -- runs along.",
        "A: Everything the benefits.",
        "A: And 90 percent were declared mitleifers.",

        "A: I -- [have my Denazification document.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: It\u2019s a leap of -- of mal-intent, yeah.",
        "A: You know, it is a -- both matter. I -- I was kind of -- could go off completely on that tangent.\nDoesn\u2019t in true human loving.",
        "A: In true human loving, quality and quantity are very closely interlinked.",
        "A: Right, and the purer the loving, the closer they\u2019re intertwined right? Okay. At any age, right?",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Okay, so let\u2019s go back to that. The -- it takes a bit of training in philosophy to be able to\nanswer the question of individual acts of crime, generally I prefer crimes against humanity.",
        "A: Okay? Even though Holocaust is a very exceptional kind of crime against humanity, okay?\nBetween individual acts of crime against humanity and a whole system gearing individuals to\nthat. And there the conclusion is simple. Remember the lady who wrote the book on\nProletarianism?",
        "A: Wasn\u2019t her --",
        "A: -- conclusion --",
        "A: -- that for an individual to act criminally, the whole system must be set up on a criminal base.",
        "A: So there is your answer. Viel, you could say, couldn\u2019t help it. He had been convinced by his\nsuperior that what he was doing was right. But that -- wait, wait -- that, in any military strategy\nwill then put the blame on --",
        "A: -- the commander in chief --",
        "A: -- of the United States armed forces, right?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s not how it works.",
        "A: Because in simpler terms, at any level you\u2019ve got to have a direct command from the next\nsuperior officer, which means to say it never gets to the top. But in the Hitler system, the\nWannsee conference was the top.",
        "A: And types like Viel, deranged completely of -- not deranged, hateful completely, or not, or\nmaybe hurting from a sev -- very severe stomach wound that he was still suffering with, may\nhave been said to have lost his mind. I looked into his eyes, they showed absolutely nothing.\nThey didn\u2019t show lust to kill. I think that the guillotine manipulators must have had the same\nlook of --",
        "A: -- absolutely no feeling.",
        "A: It\u2019s not human being that we are killing, chicken that -- even chick -- killing chickens would\nbe wa -- awaken some feelings in you. So, was he an executor on his own behalf, or was he only\nexecuting what the system had told him was right?",
        "A: Did I accuse the system in Ravensburg?",
        "A: I did.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: That was later. At the same time, it had to be said.",
        "A: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Seven\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "A: So was he ordered, or did he do it on his own?",
        "A: And there is no answer to that.",
        "A: No, well see, but again, military discipline tells you he couldn\u2019t have done it on his own\nbecause B, he would also have reduced the efficiency of the anti-tank diggers, by reducing their\nnumbers.",
        "A: And one of the arguments of the defense was exactly that. Lallier is lying, because no officer\nwill go contrary to the need to keep efficiency as high as possible.",
        "A: I found that a very contrived --",
        "A: Oh, they were sh -- oh, there were reports from the Czech legal proceedings following the\nwhole catastrophe of the small fortress of Theresienstadt in which tens of thousands of people,\nJewish people mainly, lost their lives.",
        "A: It is a continuum, a continual --",
        "A: -- killings during the seven or eight days of the digging of the ditch.",
        "A: But we were there only for two days --",
        "A: -- and on the first day I heard nothing --",
        "A: -- in my section.",
        "A: And two kilometers is long enough not to be able to hear clearly, right?",
        "A: And in my section -- this killing happened in my section on the second day.",
        "A: But court proceedings which to pred -- demonstrate that many people -- I even have a listing\nof the seven dead, plus others who were killed somewhere else at different times --",
        "A: -- at the same ditch.",
        "A: Endemic. So ki-kil -- he -- Viel wasn\u2019t the only one, but the Czech courts tried several of\nthem, and hanged several.",
        "A: In 1948 or 1940 --",
        "A: -- no, 1950 - 751.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I went back with -- I went back on the following day, requisitioning a bicycle from a\npublic stand off the main church in Leitmeritz with another cadet offi -- cadet 0 -- candidate by\nthe name of Schultz, Sep Schultz, a real Nazi-like Volksdeutsche, to go back and find out if it\u2019s\nreally true what happened, right? And we went into the klanifesto, into the small fortress to ask\nsome questions, and we were allowed to go in because we were fully uniformed, right? So we\nwent around and we came across a couple of subalterns who looked at us like as equal because\nwe were not yet officers and who showed us, well this is the wall against which the shooting is\ndone. That is the wall in which [indecipherable] and the wall against which some of the hanging\nis done. This is where some of them perished trying to jump across the fence. And we discovered\nthat it really was an extermination camp. But we never went to higher command, because given\nour lower -- lower rank, we were just happy to have been tolerated in there asking a few\nquestions. And we decided that -- we didn\u2019t just quietly disappear, but it strengthened our resolve\nin waiting for the answer by the commander of the school, right, to really find out what we got to\nbe involved in against our -- our perception that officer candidates don\u2019t do things like that, are\nnot ordered to do things like that. Now, the second question is, why would we have been sent\nthere in the first place? There were other military uniform -- military units in the area. And I\u2019m\ncoming back to the main thesis. I think I\u2019m right in presuming that the real Nazis in the Waffen\nSS command wanted to give a last minute test to our affiliation with Nazism as an ideology.\nThey wanted to find out which of us would continue falling into step and which of us could be\nconsidered untrusty and maybe put up against the wall. And you know what, given the devilnish\n-- devilish -- devilness of the system, it\u2019s a plausible intellectual question.",
        "A: So the second interesting question is, was it possibly aimed at testing the cadets for their\nallegiance to Nazism, separating those who continue believing in Hitler\u2019s absolute ideas about\nthe right to kill from those who would have had some doubts. And hoping to sort out those who\nwould have some doubts.",
        "A: I-In -- in a tot -- 1-1n a totalitarian system it is very difficult to distinguish between generally\nand non-generally. The system in its totality exists and under each many interpretations --",
        "A: -- right, will be imposed upon people. And it could well be that in the whole Waffen SS,\nattempts like that were being made throughout the war, but I can only talk about our own\nexperience, and within our own experience. This clash di -- in our deepest inside between\ndiscovering what is wrong, about which we could do nothing, and trying to make sense of why it\nhappened.",
        "A: And I\u2019m still trying to make sense as to why anyone, supposedly an officer, supposedly\nabiding by international agreement and warfare and on and on and on, not committing crimes\nagainst humanity, why would a person li -- do that? He didn\u2019t sound -- look like one who had\ngone crazy. So, a cold blooded killer? In Nazism there was no such thing as a cold blooded\nkiller. Viel --",
        "A: Well, I would only --",
        "A: -- I would only -- I would only look at Viel and I would recall during the hangs of the Serbs,\nthe presence of German officers from the Wehrmacht, who were standing there and looking at\nthe shooters and executioners the way the other members of the officers\u2019 school were standing\nthere looking at Viel doing the shooting. Irresponsive. Would you call that irresponsive?",

        "A: -- he said look, I have a job to do. I remember it [indecipherable] job to do. I have to take care\nof you guys and I have to keep you in good shape. He was Scots, I think. I found it very funny\nfor guys to be wearing skirts, you know, but I liked them, I liked them. Gave me a chance to\nlearn English as fast as possible. And he says, I have a job to do. Don\u2019t ask me, don\u2019t bother me,\ndon\u2019t bother -- he said, bother, he said [indecipherable]. So I said, but sir, you know -- said, oh,\nno, no, no. [indecipherable] said, okay, Ill report it. Remember [indecipherable]. Major Brown,\nC.I.C, Bamberg, 1946, October, November. They send me back to Bamberg because I had\nbecome homeless. I had lost my Austrian citizenship because I hadn\u2019t been born in Austria,\nright?",
        "A: And I was -- I served in the German army, without, thank God, getting the German\ncitizenship. But they sent me to Bamberg because as a so-called Volksdeutsche, they couldn\u2019t\nsend me back to Yugoslavia. I wouldn\u2019t have gone back to Yugoslavia, right. So I went back to -\n- | went up to Bamberg against my will and a year later I couldn\u2019t stand it any more, I went down\nto Vienna, crossing the border illegally and that was that. Oh, I even wrote a letter to the\nAustrian president saying that as a former Austrian, I beg your pardon, but I do wish to live in\nAustria. Could you please accommodate me with a permission to cross the boundary illegally?\nAnd would you believe it, I got a letter from President\u2019s of Austria office saying Lallier, you are\nwelcome because so many of you young ones died, we badly need replacements. Never asked\nany questions, right? Anyway, so in Bamberg I had to report to the C.I.C as per my release, I\nhave to be entrusted to American or British authority for reeducation. Cause they must have\nrecognized that I had a brain that might be potentially useful for reexamination. So that\n[indecipherable] me, you see?",
        "A: So I went to Brown and Brown turned out to be a German emigrant. Spoke fluent German, oh\nhe spoke such a beautiful Rhineland German, it was a pleasure to talk to the guy. And o-over the\ncourse of time -- met him quite a few times -- the Germans gave me no job because I had been in\nthe Waffen SS [indecipherable]. Suddenly they said well, SS [indecipherable] welcome. I have to\nwait until the [indecipherable] which I got in [indecipherable] not from my father. And -- so\nthere was no inside work on that. And so eventually we talked about the -- America. I took to the\nguy, he was very intelligent. I liked his ways and he was so leisurely. He was so different, not\n[indecipherable] officer German, I -- Major, I said wow, Major is staff officer. You know, we are\n[indecipherable]. And he liked me, he said Lallier, you are -- in German [speaks German] I can\nreeducate you, do you like America? I said, I know nothing. I know a bit about the British, but I\ndid see American soldiers and officers lie on their stomach playing dice. He says, oh yeah, we\nlove doing that. Would you like to do that? It was a sale, right? He said then, a little while later,\nand would you like to work for us? And I said, yes please, I need job. I need job badly. So he\ngave me a job as a stoveman in an American infantry company stationed in Bamberg. And\nstoveman was the most dangerous job in the army because they used gasoline stoves and every\nthird of them was expected to explode into the stovemen\u2019s faces, right? And I said, stoveman?\nSounds good to me. All the food you can eat, he said. So I got the job as a stoveman. I did a very\ngood job. Not even one stove exploded while I was working in Bamberg for nine months. And\nhe was pleased, he says, you seem highly useful, your English is getting better, your German and\nother languages, how about working for us? I said, doing what? He says, well, certain things we\nlike to find out. You were in the Waffen SS for instance. What if we sent you to Switzerland to\nexplore the escape routes of some higher SS officials through Switzerland to Latin America. And\nI\u2019m a humble guy, I [indecipherable] thinking of generals and colonels and all this. I said, why\nshould I do that? He said, because you seem like a guy who can cross boundaries and fact find\nwithout being caught, and -- would you like to do that? I said, well, why not? Where should I go?\nHe said, well, go to Switzerland, try to get across the border. Make sure that they don\u2019t catch you\nbecause the Swiss will put you in jail for being Waffen SS [indecipherable] and Ill give you 200\nAmerican dollars. And try to fact find in the Basel area if there may have been someone on the\nstreets, through which some of these Waffen S -- these SS [indecipherable] he emphasized\nstrongly, seem to have go -- escaped and then to Latin America. So, he said, I\u2019ll give you two\nweeks to find out and report back to me. And I -- I found it very amusing, here I am a nobody --\noh, and he said, and if you do a good job on the other assignments, I'll try to get you a visa to\nemigrate to the United States. Now, I am a living example of an early shift United States policy\nin 19 -- late 1946, by which time the Cold War had began.",

        "A: -- said no, not yet. And he said, well, but I-I will inter -- look at that. Then he said, if you need\nany other type of employment, if things go well I will give you a highest recommendation as a\nre-educable person. I was 21 years old.",
        "A: Not yet in the prime, okay? So I went to -- across the border, swam across the river. Boy, that\nRhine river 1s terribly cold. Boy, 1s it ever a fast river [indecipherable] on the other side. Went to\nthe next monastery, I won\u2019t tell you where. I promised I would never talk about that.

        "A: Most of those facts have since become quite well known, including the persons involved,\nright?",
        "A: And I got my evidence, I went back to, and I said to Mr. -- Herr Brown, I said Herr Brown -- I\ndidn\u2019t call him Major -- Herr Brown, I have the evidence, and he took careful note of that, and\nthen I became serious, and I -- look, I have a problem. I don\u2019t want to stay here, I want to go\nback home. I can\u2019t go back home, cause Tito is still there. I want to go back to Austria to study,\nbut I need your help, I said. And I also need to talk to you about something that had happened.\nAnd this was -- by that time it was June -- no, March 19 -- oh, February 1948. So I had been with\nthe [indecipherable] often working in that American company [indecipherable] company. And by\nthe time he had told me about the American presidency, election for demo -- oh, I loved it, I just\nswallowed America wholesale. And he was delighted. And I said, look, I\u2019ve to tell you about the\nthing that had happened. In \u201948, the Czech Republic was falling to communist hands. Hungary\nhad fallen into communist hands so the threat was evidently the thing that we had tried to fight\nagainst. Soviet Union expanded and become reality. And [indecipherable] look, the Soviets are\nexpanding, I\u2019m feeling terrible, I\u2019ve lost my home, I don\u2019t want to go to America, what do I do?\nAnd I said, what do I do especially? I have to confess to you that I had witnessed that murder.\nWhat murder? In the Panzergraben. Oh, you witnessed a murder in the Panzergraben. I said yes.\nWell, who? I said -- I gave him the story exactly, the big body guy, Viel and all that. He looks at\nme and says, I believe you. And I said, you better believe me because I don\u2019t believe it was right\nand I\u2019ve got to clear my conscience because I believe it was wrong and I believe the guy should\nbe apprehended, and I named the name. He sits back and says, Lallier. Lally. The Cold War is\non. I am glad that you are saying that because I can -- I\u2019m counting on you. We need guys like\nyou cause you never know about the Cold War. And he says, our policy is to report these things\nabout what the Nazi had done, to higher levels. My job here is to reeducate you, and talking to\nyou to pass on any useful information about you to the higher ups. I will report what you have\njust said, but there is nothing more that I can do about that because I am not a war crime\ndiscrimination -- I am not a war crime investigator. So what -- I left it in his hands. In March\n1948, I crossed the boundary, went to Vienna, found a little job, found my little eventual wife\nand decided that I would approach -- I\u2019d heard from friends about the United Nations refugee\norganization in Vienna. I went there in person [indecipherable] I remember. And I learned that\nthe commanding officer was a general, two star general by the name of Wood. And by that time I\nhad handled a British major in the col -- in the prisoner of war camp, I\u2019d handled a C.I.C. major,\nand once you have handled a C.I. major, you can talk face to face to an American general.",
        "A: Right. So I found myself speaking very fa -- low level English, asking for an interview with\nthe chief of the mission [indecipherable] mission in Vienna, and they almost fell over. And I\nsaid, please, I speak languages, please, I know many refugees, please, I know many Jewish\nrefugees, please, I want to talk General Wood. And would you believe it? General Wood\nreceived me. There was another proof that the American system will have even generals lying on\ntheir bellies, playing the dice, hoping to win. So with me, play the dice.",
        "A: I went to General Wood\u2019s office, bowed to him, no [indecipherable] any more, right, bow to\nhim. Adalbert Lallier, looking for a job. He says, what languages? I said Hungarian. Good. I\nsaid, Serbo-Croatia. Good. I said, little Czech. Oh, he says, very good. We can use you. English,\nhe listened to me, he said, you learn fast. I said, also French. He says, oh Monsieur Delong will\nbe your boss. He\u2019ll love you. Right? But he said, right now I cannot take you because I need to\nfind out who you are. So, I said please, please, I need job badly. Anything is better than cleaning\nStoves.",
        "A: Two days later I pass by, I am invited back to General Wood\u2019s office, he says, I just got a\nclearance from the C.I.C. Bamberg. A guy by the name of Brown, he says. Not his real name. I\nsaid, I know. He said I should give you any job. He said Lallier can handle any job, you can trust\nhim. Right? So he gave me a job, two weeks as a volunteer without pay to clean up all their\nbackward records on all immigrants through the Vienna refugee center for the past two years.\nAnd he said, unless you can do it in two weeks, I won\u2019t take you. I can tell you one thing, in my\nlife, it was not only the Jewish dimension, because by that time I had talked to [indecipherable]\ncause I was hanging around waiting for the job, th-the ones with the beards, ones with the smile,\nones who pretended they were -- had been jewelers in Budapest, most of them Hungarians,\nbecause they were escaping en masse. And so I had heard of the fortunes and misfortunes and I\ndecided Lallier, God has sent you, God. There were times and still are believes --\n[indecipherable] in which I believe God 1s, period. Okay? God wants me here. So I worked for\ntwo weeks without sleeping an hour and got himself a filing system from the AA to the ZZ in all\ncountries, including the American emigration part, not just the Canadian part. Oh, he was so\nimpressed, he said, I\u2019ll give you a back pay for two weeks in Austrian shillings. I think he gave\nme a thousand shillings for two weeks. And he says, I appoint you as of immediately, chief of\nthe Canadian desk. And I never asked him, as a Canadian should, what business have you as an\nAmerican to appoint me to the Canadian desk? I was so happy. I had my own second, even\nbrought her a picture, I think, Mrs. -- Madame Friedman, oh, if I had -- hadn\u2019t met my wife,\nMadame Friedman would have been a great substitute. Never had anything with her, though, she\nwas young married too. Anyway, so I got my secretary and in no time I was wielding all my\nlanguages.",
        "A: Taking on the refugees.",

They were a St. Laurent, who happened to be a then nephew\nof Canada\u2019s Prime Minister then, and a Mr. Klassen from Toronto. And upon my first\npresentation of my first case, who happened to have been Jewish, we took a liking to each other,\nbecause I was well staged, I had the documentation and I wanted these poor refugees to come to\nCanada, period.",

But to you it is now to prove that you can do\nthe job, because we\u2019re so behind that we desperately need a guy with your languages, but it\u2019s to\nyou -- for you to prove that you can do it --",
        "A: -- and that you deserve my trust.",

        "A: -- don\u2019t forget. I haven\u2019t even mentioned that yet. Anyway, so I worked my head off the first\npresentation went very well. I -- I had an Austrian identity card, so I had no problem crossing the\nSoviet demarcation line, which was very, very, very tough, and often had to ferry the refugees\nillegally, giving them false identification papers. Most of them turned out to be Hungarian\nJewish. Some je -- Czech Jewish, a very few Yugoslav Jewish. I [indecipherable] about 300 of\nthem. And often the Jewish people were, as you would expect, jewelers, merchants, silk\nproducers, merchant general, one banker. None of them agriculture, none of the textile laborers,\nbut owners of textile mills.",
        "A: Canada at that time needed cheap labor. They needed shoe workers, textile workers, so there I\nwent --",
        "A: -- looking at their documents --",
        "A: -- and, textile worker, shoe worker, woodworker, ba -- anything you say, I would put in.\nSome of them looked so brilliantly, other than workers, but the consul general were just happy to\nhave -- because Canada suddenly was losing, as they did United States, their restrictive policies\nas [indecipherable] Jewish people. Unfortunately at the same time, and it is not very well known,\nthey were also lifting the total restrictions on members, former members of the German armed\nforces, including the Waffen SS.",
        "A: Canadians and the Americans.",
        "A: Into Canada alone, more than 2500 former Waffen SS members of the Ukrainian division\nwere transported over by special agreement with the Brits, who had captured them and kept in\nBritain, not knowing what to do with them because the Soviets had shot everybody else upon\nbeing returned, you see, so with special agreement, Jewish people were being let in, but the\nNazis were also being let in, or the presumed Nazis, right? Including some of whom, from the\nreal eastern Europe, who had turned out to have been members without saying so, right, of some\nconcentration camp and Einsatz commandos, right? So I\u2019m looking at that parallel, wondering\nabout the Canadian approaches between 1947 and 1949. Was it just to get as many bodies as\npossible to replace the lost bodies during the war, right? And kind of wanting to be equal. So\nmany Jewish people, so many non-Jew, I don\u2019t know, but the fact is that I did tell the Canadian\nconsuls upon several visits who I was because they had to look at my background to find me\ntrustworthy, right? They knew about the incident about the killing and they thought I was okay, I\nwas doing a good job and eventually they told me, quite soon, Lallier, you too will have to come\nto Canada, we need guys like you.",
        "A: Your wife is -- you\u2019re married -- you\u2019re already -- your wife is pregnant. So we look at the\npast, we know you have committed nothing wrong. Come on over as soon as you can. And the\n[indecipherable] to Vienna was being abolished at the end of 1951, so I decided in October 1951\nto come over here after getting the -- I had my big row with my father about that, right? He didn't\nwant me to go. So I went anyway. So I came over on the second of October 1951, after having\nfalsified or not falsified -- hundreds of doc -- immigration documents, and brought personally\nquite a few of them across the Soviet demarcation line, often at the threat of being captured by\nthe Soviets. But I knew my way around the bridge baca -- you know, the Linz bridge was the key\nthing. You could only ferret people over without proper identification during the lunch hour,\nbecause on the east side of Linz was a big steel factory which the cho -- Soviets had reopened\nright? And during the lunch hour, because feeding was poor on the east Soviet side, thousands of\nworkers crossed the bridge and went to the western side where the food was much better,\nAmerican zone. So it is there that I ferreted out many, including Mr. Goldstein and Mr.\nGoldsmith, who had been a very preeminent jeweler in -- 1n Budapest and who eventually got to\nMontreal and opened up the -- the coffee shop, which had become very famous as a little coffee\nshop, on Drummond Street. Anyway, so they wanted me and the Americans, in the meantime,\ndidn\u2019t let me loose. The general said, Mr. Lallier, I understand you also work under special\nconditions and special cases. I says, well what do you have to offer? By that time I had my baby,\nyou see, my daughter.",
        "A: And he says, well, there 1s a guy in Czechoslovakia by the name of Ruberchinsky. He is a\nchief expert on tensile wires. I had no idea what tensile wires were. Now I know. Those are\nwires, stretched wires that use as guidelines for precision shooting long distance cannons. The\nAmericans has no experts like that. Ruberchinsky they -- absolutely they needed to get away\nfrom these Sovietized Czechs, who wanted absolutely to keep him there for the Soviet Union. He\nsays, if you ferret Ruberchinsky t -- out to the west and into our safe hands, to the ameri --\nAmerican zone in Vienna, I guarantee you an immigration visa for the United States as a refugee.\nAnd boy was that ever a challenge. I knew the boundary area, I knew some peasants. Peasants\nare good to know. I know that from my boy -- life as a child, you see. And I knew -- had some\ncontacts on the Czech side of the boundary. By that time it had become communist, you see, this\nwas, my God, early 1951, and they needed Ruberchinsky and I got Ruberchinsky through\ncontacts and I arranged Ruberchinsky to be brought by lorry and then by oxcart to the boundary\nand then [indecipherable] I crossed the boundary into a quick Austrian ready available cab. We\nwent to Vienna, I deposited him in the office of General Wood and he almost fell over. And I\nhad for -- had phoned the Canadian consulate and said, I have a guy here from the Czech\nRepublic -- from Czechoslovakia who is a tensile experts, wouldn\u2019t Canada use them?

You know, I\u2019m really happy\nabout that. I\u2019m really happy about that. Anyway, so Ruberchinsky went to the United States and\nI decided I would come to Canada because -- I\u2019Il be honest about that, some of the American\npresence had become so militaristic that I got to be concerned a bit about the message of true\ndemocracy on the one hand, which I lovingly embraced, and the military regime perpetuating\nitself because of the feeling of universal power. And having experienced the German attempt to\nuniversal military power, I decided I\u2019d had enough of that. No more C.I.C..

And I had brought him to the demarcation line and the Soviets had\nsomehow g-gotten hold of that, and the Americans were waiting on this side, so I was able with\nthe American to pull the co guy, with the last bit of our strength across the demarcation line to\nsave him from the west and he was almost -- he almost died with fright because the Soviets were\nhanging onto his legs on the other side. So then I decided I\u2019d had enough. My wife says, look, I\nwant peace and quiet; my daughter had been born. So I came to Canada and -- wanting to study.\nMy credentials were good, my English was much better, my French was okay for Quebec, even\nthough Quebec\u2019s accent is different from the French [indecipherable]. And I was a Protestant, so\nin Quebec I found that Protestants were not really welcome, so I kind of deemphasized that.\nThere was no immigration of French Protestants into Quebec from 1529 to 1929, can you\nimagine that? That\u2019s another thing that I didn\u2019t know about. Anyway, so I found meni -- menial\njobs. I worked in a color dye factory, I worked in a -- in the gold mine. I worked as a shoe\ncleaner, I worked in a -- as a vacuum cleaner salesman. And I worked as a car washer. And let\u2019s\nsee, I worked one more dirty job, in a barrel factory, I was a hole puncher. Concerned, cause I\nhad learned a bit about democracy. I had been told about Jefferson. I had been told about the\nConstitution. I had been told about the duality of Canada, and my mind was so empty. I had\nknown nothing about the systems. That kind of pleased my soul. And I was married, I had\nresponsibility for the family. My wife was a haute couturiere, she had no problem finding a job.\nSo I decided I would work with Steinbergs as a store manager for awhile to get money and go\nback to school. I went to the French university for admission, speaking in European French and\nhaving to answer -- one of the first questions was what religion are you? You are from Europe. I\nsaid well, look, I\u2019m of [indecipherable] origin. He said Protestants study at McGill. We cannot\naccept Protestants. And that was that. So my desire to match my heart with some of the French\nblood rest -- remaining in it, with the French heart of Canadian, didn\u2019t work. I went to McGill\nspeaking colloquial English. Good for selling vacuum cleaners, but not good for studying Burke\nand Hume and Locke. And looked at the guy -- who looked Jewish, you know guys who look\nJewish, who happen to be Jewish, right? You see it on their eyes. I said -- Solean was his name,\nDean Solean, the first Jewish administrator at McGill in 1954. Okay, big, big difference. There\nhad been no Jewish administrators before then, so McGill was kind of opening up. I said please,\nAustria born, speaking all kinds of languages, working for [indecipherable] America, please, I\nwant to finish college. What certification do you have? Well, I ha -- in Vienna I studied two\nyears at the university -- and that\u2019s very impressive. It\u2019s like three years over here. So he looked\nat that, he says, look Lallier, I will accept you for a B.A. in economics and political science, and\nPll put you into honors economics. Oh, I felt so pleased. You know what honors economics is?\nIt\u2019s a special degree, undergrad, leading you direct into graduate school. I phoned my wife and\nsaid, oh my dear, I haven\u2019t even started, but already I have honors.",
        "A: So I said yes, honors, oh wow. He says, but you first must spend another year learning\nEnglish, because if I take you right now you'll fail, and I don\u2019t want you to fail, I see that you\ndon\u2019t want to fail. So I ya -- I said, so what do I do? And there was something that I will never\nforget. Dean Solean looks at me, jee -- Jewish Canadian, free to have the first dean job at McGill,\nin a society in which the Jewish people were not easily accepted. Tells me, you know, Mr.\nLallier, Canada\u2019s a great, free country. Do whatever you want. But come back the first of\nSeptember 1954, I'll take you. And I said, great, free country. Nobody ever in my life had told\nme it\u2019s a great free country, you\u2019re free to what to do. My conversion to democracy and human\nfreedom and individual freedom started blooming, but deep inside, the shame of what I had\nwitnessed never died. So I went to McGill [indecipherable] learning English day and night, I was\nworking 70 words a day, and with that good mind of mine it\u2019s working well, even s-started to\nwrite in, the [indecipherable] professor was very, very, very protective of me and encouraging.\nAnd I landed with a very high quality B honors economics, political science. Wrote out a few\nletters of reco -- of application. Lo and behold Columbia took me without restrictions, but with\nthe restriction to study in the Russian Institute. Why? Lallier, we know that you know languages,\nwe badly need you for your east European languages to be trained as a specialist in Soviet\naffairs, but you have to learn Russian. And I had a Russian teacher at Columbia who was a\nyoung lady refugee from Leningrad. I don\u2019t know how she made it, oh she was so beautiful, I\nwas studying Russian day and night, including some coffee sessions with the young lady, right, I\nremember that. And I felt I was really taking to Russian, everybody was pleased. So I got my\nMaster\u2019s degree in economics in one year, which was unusual. I had my Russian\n[indecipherable] certificate in one additional year, which is unusual. And I was fully qualified for\nmy Ph.D. in economics. All of that in two years. And then I got tired. The United States got the\nwar in the Vietnam. I was suffering under this blatant expression of militarism under false\nphilosophic and moral premises of [indecipherable] theory and all of that stuff, and I\u2019d become a\nperson who had highly admired Jefferson, on the one hand, in spite of his dubious background\nlately, right, but also Locke. I\u2019m a [indecipherable] by conviction. And I decided I would come\nback to Canada, take up a teaching post, fini -- post, fish -- finish my doctorate somewhere along\nthe line, but prefer a country of peace. Even though the country was supplying all the napalm the\n-- America needed to bomb the hell out of Vietnam. So I came back home, came across some of\nmy refugees that I brought here, including the guy who had opened the coffee shop, who gave\nme a permanent table like in Vienna. Adalbert, whenever you come -- in Hungarian -- this is\nyour table, I give you my personal services. And he was very grateful. And some others I kept\ncontact with, who was very grateful, and I had no problem getting my citizenship, even being\ninvited to speak at a citizenship ceremony in both languages -- both official languages, no\nAustrian any more, did that. Recognizing the French Canadian identity, but also the need of\nEnglish Canada to remain strong and united, so they liked that. So that was 1957. I went to the\nUnited States, lived in New York for three years, 1960 to 1963. Had a very good time on\nBroadway, working part time in a -- in a p -- ina -- ina chicken and sparerib store, a Jewish store\non Broadway just off Columbia in which the owner told me, when you sell expensive cheeses,\nalways leave your thumb on the scale. And I told him, I can\u2019t do that. He says, if you want the\njob you\u2019d better do that, but also got a ska -- part-time ta -- I was very good at Columbia,\nactually, had an A average, at the graduate level. And the professor that chaired then said lall --\nLallier, you\u2019re really a very smart kid, he said, even though you\u2019re a bit older than the average\nkid, he says, I recommend you for a teaching job at Brooklyn College. So he got me a Brooklyn\nsummer job [indecipherable] college, 1962 in the summer -- 1961 in the summer. And he said, I\nprefer you to stay in the United States and you don\u2019t need to have your doctorate 1n economics\nbecause with your advanced degrees, graduate degrees 1n international politics, I want you to\nwork for the Rand Corporation. And the Rand Corporation is the air force\u2019s secret service, I wa -\n- didn't want that. And I hope, I beg you to understand why I made up my mind that I would not\ncontinue living in the States. I love America for its ideals, for its honesty, for the greatest of,\nespecially President Roosevelt. Not so much the subsequent ones. And for the liberating me, for\na chance to develop my mind. But I prefer maybe being a small country member, because small\ncountries can always prevent themselves from stepping under the toes. Big countries, by their\nsize alone, cannot do that. I\u2019m a friend of the United States, I am very highly respective of you\nfor giving me the honor of having this discussion and making my confession once again, hoping\nto convince you that when I applied that job -- for that job in General Woods\u2019s office, God had\ngiven me a mandate, and I\u2019m very serious about that, to try to undo, not so much my feelings of\nguilt, cause you can\u2019t do feelings of unguilt if you cannot prevent the killing of innocent people,\nbut trying to do my best to ease the suffering of many of the Jewish refugees, especially those\nfrom Hungary and the Czechia -- and Czechoslovakia. And I think I have been able to follow\nthrough on my mandate in doing that, and thereby easing my pangs of conscience, hoping that\neventually the maker, in the Christian tradition St. Peter, will look at me and say, oh Adalbert\nyou old rascal, you didn\u2019t do anything, did you? But you at least tried to redeem yourself and to\nhelp a people badly needed help [indecipherable] crucial time. It wasn\u2019t thousands of them, it\nwas maybe just a couple of hundred. And the couple of hundred have had children, some of them\nI know even eight to 10 children. And it seems that they have forgiven me for doing nothing,\neven Rabbi Poupko. My conscience is still not pleased, because when you have to be a man, you\nhave to be a man, even though it costs your life. \u2019' ve had moment -- in English you have the\nstatement, if a man is a chicken, he is not a man. At that moment I was a chicken.",
        "A: I\u2019m still -- I\u2019m still ashamed of that.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: I don\u2019t reflect about that, it\u2019s a matter of just sentimentality. The Rabbi Poupko tells me, if\nyou had decided to talk, you wouldn\u2019t be here witness to a crime, and a criminal would remain\nunpunished, and maybe a whole system would therefore remain unpunished. So in a certain\nsense, he\u2019d say, Lallier, be practical about thing. You may have decided not to talk because you\nknew you had a higher purpose than that. You had to become a witness to something awful that\nhad happened, and that was what your life was about. But even though it intellectually sounds --\nsounds very satisfying, to stand there and to look at the man killing, right in front of my face,\nseven innocent people one at a time, it\u2019s a horrendous experience.",
        "A: It makes you lose your belief in God -- believe in God, because God would never allow a\nthing like that to happen. And it makes you lose your belief in basic simple human dignity.",
        "A: Now, the happy thing about that is maybe the -- not happy, the positive about that 1s I didn\u2019t\nknow those seven people. I know they were Jewish. But if I had been able to discover who they\nwere, in the eyes of some, their names alone would recreate them as human beings who had been\nthere with a purpose, who had never fulfilled a purpose. Because if you say -- there\u2019s a big\ndifference between seven de -- and not the seven dead Jews, and saying Mr. Cour and Mr.\nSteinberg and Mr. Sweinberg and Mr. That or Mr. This and That. They are human beings in their\nidentities as they were. Their lives are recreated. One can even proceed and find out who they\nwere, what they had done, what they had achieved for the good or the bad. And if they had had\nrelatives or not [indecipherable] or not. And lo and behold, after the trial, two persons came\nforth, one claiming to be the granddaughter of the grandfather which she hadn\u2019t known what had\nhappened to except that he had died somewhere in the -- in the concentration camp.",
        "A: Oh, through -- through the documentary. Oh no, that I found out going myself and my -- I was\nsent as a Canadian delegate to the Czech Republic as a expert in financial -- international finance\nto Prague through Casel, which is an arm of the Canadian development -- international\ndevelopment agencies, to help some of the Czech bankers democratize their procedures and\nbring them up to par in terms of capitalistic banking practices. I spent six weeks in Prague\nconsulting with two very senior bankers, both of whom by -- were, by the way, communist party\nmembers, but who had mellowed down to capitalistic practices and wanting to learn about them.\nSo I was teaching them how a Canadian banker practices, and I spent six weeks there, and on the\nsecond week I le -- decided I\u2019d go back to Leitmeritz, I\u2019d go back to Theresienstadt for the\nsecond time to fact find and to reminisce. And I went back and I found the site. I found the\nmasses of graves and gravestones and all that. And that\u2019s when I decided I would not continue\nliving with myself with that feeling of shame unless I finally spoke up and --",
        "A: -- made my confession. And I came back from Prague in August 1997, and in December, on\nDecember first, I arranged with Rambam and with a friend lawyer of mine who happens to be\nHungarian Jewish, who cord -- who had known me for many years and with Rabbi Poupko to\nmake my of-official confession about what had happened. And the rest follows all of that.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, no, no. I had written -- no, no, that was after that, because once you have\ncome out into the open, there are certain repercussions, but also legal requisites, namely, I had to\nmake up my mind, do I sue, or do I not sue. Right?",
        "A: Or do I [indecipherable] the Germans to sue.",
        "A: Right? But to sue is a procedure going through, at the first stage, the consul general of\nGermany, of the modern, democratic, decent Germany, and go for two or three interviews so\nthey can squeeze me, if it\u2019s veracity or not, or if I\u2019m lying --",

        "A: But -- but in following through the legal preparation, legal proceedings as to how to go about,\nofficially I had to find out from the senior, still living, the Waffen SS highest commander, what\nhis post-war view were, namely, when I wrote -- I think it was 1998, okay, about a killing of this\nsort. So on the one hand I wanted to feel him out. On the other hand I wanted to play this -- this\nred herring of military hierarchy and the level of responsibility. So I wrote him a personal letter,\nhe was General Kumm, he was the second [indecipherable] general of my division, but it took\nhim away from [indecipherable] and he wasn\u2019t hanged because of that. The seven other\ncommanders were all hanged by the Titoists, and I think justifiably so, including a German Field\nMarshall. So I wrote to Kumm and surprisingly got an answer. I said, I have to account for you\nas the highest remaining Waffen SS ranking officer -- he was a brigadier, at the brigadier level,\nto account for you for the deed by Julius Viel then and then, involving seven Jews that they\nkilled in the Panzergraben. And -- not for permission, okay, I want you to tell me if, from what\nyou know about military discipline and military command structures if this can be looked at as a\nwar crime. He wrote me a letter, personal letter, signing it. I have original letter in his own\nhandwriting, from a Waffen SS brigadier who has since died about two years ago at the age of\n92. He says, Dr. Lallier, because I put in my full credential to make it [indecipherable], he said,\nDr. Lallier, I am reporting received of your letter, your inquiry, and all that I can say is that in my\nview -- I\u2019m translating now from the German -- in my view, any Waffen SS man or Waffen SS\nofficer who commits a war crime ceases being member of the Waffen SS. Which means to say,\nhe says, that friendship ends amongst Waffen SS officers, where war crimes are committed.",
        "A: Now, an interesting statement, because he himself was commander of the division in which\nmany what we call today war crimes had been committed.",
        "A: Now, had he learned anything in his long [indecipherable] life 1n which the Americans never\ntouched him, he never was in prison, because he was Germany\u2019s major s -- expert in partisan\nwartare, which the Americans were trying to learn about as much as we can, as we well know,\nright?",
        "A: Okay? Now -- or, did he have any other intentions like finding a cheap way of apologizing?\nBut he in fact told me, you go ahead, because a war crime 1s a war crime, you have my blessing.\nI didn\u2019t need his blessing.",
        "A: But I needed him to reveal himself. And you know, given the command structure, once a\nbrigadier tells me it\u2019s a war crime, the ones below him cannot say it\u2019s not a war crime. There is a\ntrouble with that. Everybody below him who were at court --",

You,\nthe confessee are giving an honest information. There\u2019s a higher level of togetherness in which\nthe forgiveness is given by the authority who is raised in the culture, then educated to understand\nand to give you forgiveness.

        "A: Simple as that. And I-I -- I have living witnesses [indecipherable] the kids, Evan and\nFrederick, I\u2019m trying to keep the candles lit. The Jewish people are special people. They suffered\na great deal at the hands of the Catholics, it wasn\u2019t right, all of 1t under the false premises that\nJesus had been killed. I asked myself often that, did Jesus deserve being declared a God? I prefer\nthe Jewish version, he was one of the prophets whose image as somebody, changed unto a\ngodlike image, for whatever extra powers that might involve or imply. So that\u2019s not in the right\nway, I don\u2019t even know if Jesus would have wanted to be declared a God. So I\u2019m much closer to\nthe Jewish interpretation of God, it\u2019s the one thing that I have problems with, the notion the\nJewish God is kind of desperately absolutist. Like we can bargain for everything, but God is the\nabsolute command, we\u2019d never even dare contemplate to make a counter-proposal. God to me 1s\nsomebody I can talk to, God is somebody will -- who will understand because God by nature is\ngood. God is not a command person. God is a guide.

        "A: Oh, no --",

Now, what do you do with that?\nYou just swallow hard, just swallow hard and by swallowing hard you get to believe that if you\nhad done something, they may not have gotten killed. And Rabbi Poupko, I told you Rabbi\nPoupko exactly, Rabbi said Lallier, that doesn\u2019t follow, if you had done something they may not\nhave killed. Because if you had done something about the first one getting killed, they\u2019d kil --\nthey\u2019d have killed you and the other six anyway. But I cannot accept that because again, th-th-the\nharder view, a man being a man, in a context of a civil society in which killing is murder. And\nracially induced killing is the ultimate crime, let\u2019s say. Extermination of a whole people. What\ndoes a man do with that? Do I grab the gun? I didn\u2019t grab the gun.

        "A: And you develop your reason, but always inculcating them with this need to ask question, to\nconfirm fact.

        "A: But please don\u2019t forget, for three years I served the evil empire. And part of that was a\nconviction naturally, an honest conviction that serving that empire would put a halt to what I still\nbelieve is an empire equally as equal -- equally equal -- equally as evil, namely godless\nBolsheviks.",
