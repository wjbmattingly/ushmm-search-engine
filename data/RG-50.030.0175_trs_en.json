        "Q: OK. Uh Bea, we've started. Would you tell us your name please?",
        "A: I'm uh Beatrice Pappenheimer, but I was born Beate Stern.",
        "Q: Where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Lauterbach, Germany. Lauterbach uh is a small town and it was uh October\n1932.",
        "Q: Tell me about your parents and your family.",
        "A: OK. My family consisted of my parents and I have a sister who is three years younger\nthan I am, and at that time we had an uncle living with us. He was uh about nineteen\nyears old. He was still going to the university, and also uh my grandmother lived with us.\nAnd this is, this was our family unit.",
        "Q: Tell me about your childhood, before it became really bad.",
        "A: OK. In Lauterbach it was still mostly peaceful. Uh the only thing that I remember was\nthat my uncle used to come home from the university and he used to have uh many\narguments going on with my father, because my uncle would say, I can see the hand-\nwriting on the wall. I see what's coming. Let's get out of here. My father, he was an\northodox Jew. He had a lot of faith. He had faith in God. He had faith in people, and he\nthought, well, Hitler then...Hitler as much as what he's doing and what we're hearing, he's\nnot going to get away with it. And also probably he thought what am I going to do in a\ndifferent country, even Israel, or Palestine at that time, where things were pretty tough.\nHe didn't speak any language but German. He was in business. He had a textile business.\nWe owned a little store but he was on the road most of the time and my mother was in the\nstore. Uh as a matter of fact, I remember this because my grandmother used to take care\nof me. I, I think in those days I used to know my grandmother better than I knew my\nmother. As a matter of fact, I often think of my parents being very modern, today's\nparents like, because they both worked. My father had had a university education and I\nwas taken care of by the grandmother. And uh then the other thing that I remember was\nthat uh there was talk about a cousin dying. And I remember I had nightmares about that\nfor some reason. I was scared. That was the first time I knew what it was like to be scared\nof death, of something unknown. Uh that was my earliest recollection. I also...I remember\nplaying dead. Uh I would lay down in the living room floor and I would cross my hands\nover my chest and say to Grandma, I'm dead. So there was talk about people, I remember,\neven disappearing and dying, even that early. The next thing that I remember - one day\nmy parents came home and they were all agitated and uh the reason for it was they had to\ngo and register somewhere. And I remember something about that the men were called\nIsrael...they had a name and the women's name was Sara.\u2019 But my parents were terribly\nupset. They didn't like the idea that they had to give their names and addresses and\noccupation and I think also what it was they had to have permission to uh move. If they\nwant to move out if Lauterbach, they had to get permission, and that upset them to no\nend, and we stayed in Lauterbach until about 1936 when my father had to give up his\nstore and they also had to give up the house because Jews were not allowed to have any,\nhold any property anymore. So then we moved to Karlsruhe. One of the reasons we\nmoved to Karlsruhe was because my uh father had a brother and his family was living\nthere. I think so. And that...Karlsruhe was a__ big city, compared to Lauterbach, but we\nhad had a nice sized house in Lauterbach. In Karlsruhe it was a different story. When we\nfirst came there we moved into with my uh aunt and uncle and their three children, and\nthey just had a small apartment, so I remember us being five children in one bedroom.\nAnd we had a wonderful time as children but at the same time it was bedlam. And my\nuh...I remember my father and my uncle both trying to find us an apartment. Well, that\nwas very very difficult already in those days because many people wouldn't, if you were\na Jew they wouldn't rent you an apartment. They weren't allowed to. But finally my\nfather found an apartment above a bank and I think...well, this 1s the picture that I showed\nyou that I have a picture from. And uh it was a small apartment compared to the big\nhouse we had in Lauterbach which consisted of three rooms. The bathroom was out in the\nhallway and we shared it with other families but we had a a kitchen and the door opened\nfrom the hallway into the kitchen, so that was the main entrance and on the left side was\nthe living room and on the right hand side was was the bedroom. And there in Karlsruhe I\nwas old enough I had to start going to school. And uh school was very very different than\nwhat we have here in the United States. There were all man teachers. They were uh going\nby the uh Nazi theories and we had to learn how to say \"Heil Hitler\" and we had to uh we\nwere taught Nazi theories. I don't remember much of that. I just remember mostly uh that\nthey taught us a tremendous amount in one year, but they were extremely strict. It was\nperfectly alright for the teacher to hit you, and uh for the girls, I remember we had to go\nup to the front of the room, to the desk of the teacher, and it was always on a platform,\nand we would hold our hands out like so, the tips of our fingers, and he would take the\nruler and hit our hands that way. For the boys, he could slap them around wherever the\nhand would fall. We had to sit a certain way. We had to write a certain way. We could\nnot look out of the window and God forbid we should talk to each...to each other, or to\nthe teacher. You were only allowed to talk if the teacher addressed you. So it was\ncompletely different, but naturally I didn't realize that until years and years later. Also we\ndidn't like to go to school, mostly because on the way to school there were other children,\nnot Jewish, who would go after us and yell, dirty Jews, or Christ killer...all kinds of\nnames. They would push us, throw stones at us and we were very afraid and the same\nthing when we would come home. Sometimes we would duck into stores. I remember\none of the stores we used to run into was uh a big department store, and it had uh\nescalators and that was my first experience with an escalator. Uh, yes, the city of\n* decree August 17, 1938\nKarlsruhe was quite modern, and it was a beautiful city. I still remember the parks. I still\nremember the Schloss, or the palace that we used to go to that was in the park and every\nSabbath afternoon we would uh just walk around this since we were orthodox, so one of\nthe things you did, in the morning you would go to synagogue, in the afternoon you\nwould go to the park. And talking about synagogues, we didn't really have a synagogue\nthere. We used to have one in Lauterbach. I remember my father and I going to a regular\nsynagogue, but in uh Karlsruhe for some reason I never went to a regular synagogue. We\nwent where there was just like an apartment and it was two rooms - one room for the\nwomen and one room for the men, and there always had to be a guard in front of the\napartment building uh watching the place, so I don't know whether it was you were not\nallowed to hold services or not, but I just remember the guard. But as children we used to\nhave a good time running around and uh my parents being religious we used to go every\nFriday and...my father used to go Friday I should say. We used to stay home, wait for him\nto come home, and the on Saturday mornings we used to all go to synagogue, and it was\na religious thing, but I think it was also social because we had a chance to meet with\nother people then. Uh we went to school there for about a year, and then Hitler closed all\nthe schools to Jewish children.\u201d We were not allowed to attend the public schools\nanymore. And after that my father tried to teach us as much as possible. Uh I remember\nas we used to uh sometimes go for a walk with one of my parents or with both of them,\nwe used to see signs in front of stores saying Juden verboten. Not only uh stores but also\npublic buildings and even parks. And our lives became more and more restricted. Uh one\nday as children we were playing outside in the street because that was the only place\nwhere we could play, and two Nazis came along and we picked up some little pebbles out\nof the gutter and started throwing those pebbles at them. By then we had a hatred for the\nNazis. Well, they got tired of the game, and they turned around and they started yelling at\nus and going after us, and it was just fortunate that we knew the streets and the alleys of\nKarlsruhe a little better than they did. But my mother, she had been watching from the\nliving room window and she saw the whole episode and when we came back upstairs she\nwas absolutely furious, and she says, I can't trust you to play outside by yourselves\nanymore. From now on, either you have to have your father or I along, so that restricted\nour movement. Uh we used to see parades. We lived uh where there was right opposite\nfrom our apartment, there was like a uh public square and there was a tall uh column, you\nmight say, and I don't know uh what it was all about uh but they used to have parades, uh\nthe brown shirts and some of the other Nazi movements, and I as a child, I loved uh\nlistening to the music. I used to love to listen to the parade and the marching, never\nthinking anything that much of it. I knew my parents were against it, but it sounded so\npretty, so I would go to the window of our living room and look out. And one day my\nmother came up behind me and she hit me on my behind and she said I don't want you\nlooking out of the window. So I couldn't do that anymore. Uh like I say, our lives were\nvery very restricted, plus scary at the same time because I remember my mother saying to\nmy father, now be sure you're back by nig...uh night time. I don't want to have to worry\n* Jewish children could only go to Jewish schools: Nov., 1938; no school for Jewish children at\nall: July 1, 1942.\nabout you. And one of the reasons was that uh there were a lot of muggings going on and\npeople just disappearing, so my mother always used to say, be...be home before it's dark,\nand I remember there were times when my father wasn't home and she would pace the\nkitchen floor, back and forth, back and forth. So life for my parents must have been\nterribly tough, terribly uncertain and I, I remember the arguments between them a lot uh\nfor one reason or another. Also because uh some of the shops were closed to us it was\nhard even to know where to get your bread, where to get your food. It was tough. I had\none experience that I shall never forget was that one day uh I went over to see my\ngirlfriend, and she lived right across the street from us, and I go upstairs...she lived also\nin an apartment...and uh I knocked on the door. The mother opens up the door and she's,\nand she says to me, oh it's you. I don't want you playing anymore here. And she just shut\nthe door in my face. And that was the last I saw of this friend. And I gather that she\nwasn't Jewish, and by then, and I forgot exactly what year it was...could have been\nprobably 1937, '38...they couldn't, they they could not fraternize with you any more, but\nthat hurt. And I still carry that hurt. Uh the next thing that I can tell you about is that uh\none night we woke up and there was a lot of commotion in the street and as I\nremembered looking out of the window, I saw fires all over the place. It was as though\nthe whole city of Karlsruhe was burning, but I remember saying something...my father\nwas saying uh the synagogues are burning. They're burning all the synagogues. So he\nquickly got dressed and went downstairs and I remember my mother and my sister and I\nwaiting up for my father to come home again. And he didn't come home. And we waited\nand we waited all night. He never came home. We found out...and I don't remember when\nI found this out, but now I can tell you that he had been taken like a lot of other men that\nnight, rounded up and they were taken to concentration camps and he was taken to\nBuchenwald. I don't remember how long he was gone, but I shall never forget the day he\ncame back, and at first I didn't know it was him, because the kitchen door opens up and\nthere stands this man...he was bent over. My father had...he was a short man but he had\nalways been quite erect, but that day he was bent over and he had, he was all dirty and\nthere was blood on him and he was shaking. We had one of those old-fashioned uh black\nwood-burning stoves right across from the kitchen door, and when he opened up that\ndoor he started putting his hands, both hands, on that stove, and I knew it was hot, so I\nscreamed at him...Pa...and at that same instant, I recognized who he was, and I screamed,\nPapa, Papa, it's hot. And my screams brought my mother into the kitchen and she took\none look at him and I still remember her raising her hands and quickly going to him and\ntaking him into the bedroom. Well my father was sick, I guess, and uh it was lucky I\nthink that my mother had a little bit of nursing experience. Somehow she managed to get\nhim well, because we couldn't call a doctor by then, and uh...but he was never the same\nafter that. I don't think my father found work when we had come to uh Karlsruhe. I don't\nknow really what he did, except for one comment. One evening...I I I used to watch him.\nHis hands always hurt him, and one evening I remember we were sitting around the table\nand I said to him, how come your hands hurt you so much Father? And he said it's\nbecause I'm laying bricks and it's hard work and it hurts my hands. So he must have been\nmaybe put into forced labor and uh he was a brick-layer. He was never the same after\nthat. He stayed around the apartment quite a bit and maybe he was hiding. I don't know. I\ndon't know to this day how he managed to get out of Buchenwald. Uh I don't\nknow...some people I know if they paid enough money they were able to get out. Others\nthey escaped. I don't know how he did it. The next thing that I remember is uh that we\nhad bombings. The air raids started. The air raids would start up and we'd go down...first\nof all we had to pull our shades because we had, there was blackout, so we had to go\ndown...we pulled the shades, went down to the basement and there we huddled in the\nbasement. It was a big basement, because we lived in an apartment and the apartment\nhouses, several of them must have been connected so it was a community basement. And\none of the things that I remember and probably this whole episode I remember because of\nthat...my mother used to tell stories to everyone and one of her stories...I I smile at it\ntoday, and whether I believed her or not I don't know, but she would say...see this\nbasement. It has a rounded roof, and it did. It had a rounded roof. And we were all\nhuddled down there. Some of the children were crying. Some of the older people\nwringing their hands and saying what's going to become of us, and uh you didn't know\nwhether you would live from one minute to the next. You would hear the bombs falling\nand it was...it was terribly frightening. And here my mother tells the story...see this roof\nis rounded. If a bomb should fall, it's not going to come through. It's going to roll right\noff, and I must have laughed at it even at this time, because when ever I think about it, it\nmakes me laugh for some reason. And she would tell all kinds of different stories. She\nwould try to get everybody to sing songs, just anything just to take their minds off just a\nlittle bit of of the situation. Then the air raid sirens would blow again and we'd go\nupstairs. So we got used to that kind of a life uh...nights being interrupted by the sirens.\nSometimes even during the day. Then one day...it was late 1939,\u00b0 there was a loud knock\non the door. And there stood two Gestapo. My mother asked them, what do you want?\nAnd they said, don't ask any questions, and they yelled, just go and pack. And my mother\nsaid, well, how long are we going to be gone? How much should we pack? And they got\nangrier and angrier as she asked these questions, and they yelled louder and louder, and\nfinally they said, just go pack enough for two weeks, so my mother goes into the\nbedroom and she starts packing and I went into the living room because I had a doll that I\nloved very much and I used to take that doll where ever I went, so as I went into the\nliving room one of the Nazis followed me, and I go and pick up that doll and he says, he\nsays to me, and he also gets ahold of my arm and starts shaking me and saying, where\nyou're going you don't need this doll, and I look at him, and to this day I can see that face.\nAnd I and I said to him, if I can't have that doll...I thought for some reason that he wanted\nit... said to him, if I can't have that doll, you can't have her either. And I take the doll and\nI threw her down on the floor and her doll...and that doll was made...her face was made\nout of porcelain and broke into hundreds of pieces, and oh, that it got me so upset. As a\nmatter of fact I was so upset during that whole episode I don't remember my father or my\nsister. It seemed like the whole thing was played out between my mother and I for some\nreason, and yet I know they were there, but I don't remember them at all. My mother gets\ndone packing and we're about to go out, and I look around that apartment and I thought to\nmyself...we'll never see it again. And I look at my mother and I said to her as much. I\n* date uncertain\nsays I don't want to go. They're not going to let us see this place again. And I take ahold\nof the leg of the kitchen table and I...I wouldn't let go of it, and my mother had a terrible\ntime trying to get me out of the door, but little by little she calmed me and she managed\nto get me out. They took us to the railroad station, and there there were hundreds of\npeople, lots of people. And you could tell some of them had been waiting there for quite\nsome time, because they were laying on blankets, sitting on the suitcases. There were\nbabies crying. Older people again crying and uh it was just so confusing...everything. We\nwaited, I I forgot for how long, but after a while we lined up and they put us on a train.\nNow it was a regular train but we were squeezed in. There were so many of us. And I\nthought always because there was so many people on the train and I don't know whether\nthey'd slow (ph) or not that that's why the train went very slow. And it did. It went very\nslow, and especially going around a bend. It would really slow down, and because there\nwere So many people, it was very hot and the windows were open so some people\nthought they would escape and they jumped out of the windows, but they didn't realize at\nfirst that there were Nazis on the roof of the train, and they had guns and they shot those\npeople as they tried to get away from the train, and that was my first experience seeing\nsomeone die. I saw some being shot. It was terrible. And people were just...everybody\nwas very excited on the train, too. Then after a while the train stopped and it was at the\nborder of Germany and France. And then there was a voice over the loudspeaker and it\nsaid, if you have any money, get rid of it, or at least I thought that's what it said, because\nmy mother, she tried to hide some money on her and and I I was in a terrible state I guess\nbecause I saw her doing it and I started screaming at her, which I would never have dared\nto do under ordin...ordinary circumstances because you had a great great respect for your\nparents. But I said to her, don't do this. They're going to do something terrible to you, and\nsure enough, they had said over the loudspeaker that if you disobeyed orders, you would\nbe shot, and so I was just hysterical when I saw her doing that and so she says OK, take\nthe money and flush it down the toilet. So I go take the money and I go to the toilet and I\nflush it down, and I don't think...I don't know how much it was or anything...it was just a\nhandful...and then I came back and I walked through the corridor because there they have\ncompartments and I walked through the corridor and you can see into the compartments\nand there I saw the Nazis searching people and taking them out into the corridor and uh\nafter a while I noticed that they were lining them up on the platform outside. Pretty soon I\nhear the shots and true to their word they were shooting all the people who had tried to\nhide money on their person. But I didn't see...I just heard the shots...I didn't see anything\nbecause my mother took me against her body like and she hid my face against her. Then\nthe train went on, and like I said, there were so many people on the train, I didn't have a\nseat. My mother had a seat but I didn't, and after a while I made myself comfortable on\nthe floor. I just sat down on the floor and I remember I had a wall to lean against. I\nremember still seeing a fat lady sitting there and there was an old man and people\nstanding...somebody tall and thin and the train went on and on. I don't remember...there\nwas no food, nothing to drink, and I missed more not having anything to drink. I became\nvery very thirsty and my throat felt so dry, almost was like getting a sore throat, and I\ndon't remember how many days we were on the train. It just seemed like 1t went on and\non and on and on. I slept some and then suddenly the train stopped and we were able to\nget out but then they put us on trucks and I remember still the roughness of those of those\nNazis. Sometimes there was an old person who didn't walk fast enough for them, and\nthey would kick him, or they would pull a man's beard or they would hit them with their\nsticks that they had and always I heard the word, \"schnell, schnell\", which means quick,\nquick. Then we were put on those trucks and taken to the concentration camp. My first\nsight of that concentration camp what...my my...I became just desolate. There was barbed\nwire all around it and it looked all brown, grey and black. There wasn't any green for\ngrass. There were no leaves on the trees. It looked so desolate. It looked so sad. We were\ntaken off the trucks and then we were separated, the men from the women and we had to\nsay goodbye to my father and the women were taken to a big barrack and there they told\nus to get undressed and this time they looked for gold. We had little bracelets. They took\nthose. My mother, she had pierced earrings. They were round...they were hoop earrings\nand they pulled those earrings right off her ear lobe. They didn't even give her a chance to\ntake them off. They just pulled them, and I still her, hear her cry out to this day, and I\nremember her holding her hands like that to her ears. Then they gave us mattresses and\nthe mattress was very light, and I was surprised but the reason why it was so light was\nbecause it just contained straw. They assigned a bed for us. Now my mother and sister\nand I, we had only one bed to sleep on. We were about twenty-five to thirty people in a\nbarrack. We had just...there were just beds but they had like...they were they were\nframes, wooden frames, chicken wire and then we put the mattress on. There were no\nbunk beds. People tried to have a little privacy. Now I remember them, them hanging up\nmaybe some kind of a rag or cloth, and in each barrack there was a scale, and I was,\nreally at first | remember I was wondering what was the scale for. But I had a chance to\nfind out, because everyday they would throw one loaf of bread into the barrack, and they\nwould throw it. The women would go after that loaf of bread. At first it wasn't that bad,\nbut then when you...but then when we became hungrier and hungrier, things became\nworse and worse. And the reason I'm saying this is that we used to have one person to\ndiv...to divide up this loaf of bread, and it wasn't very big. It was regular loaf like that.\nBut to divide it up amongst, like I say, twenty-five to thirty people wasn't very easy, and\nalso I never saw any knives, forks or spoons. So one person was selected and she would\ntry and weigh bread as closely as possible so everybody would have the same amount.\nDidn't always work out that way because it was very difficult to do. So 1f one person\nwould get just a little bit more, the other women would jump on this person and they\nwould have terrible fights. These women who had been ladies turned like into animals\nalmost, just to have a little bit of more bread, but they were starving us, and when you are\nthat hungry it hurts and you will do almost anything, anything to get just a little bit of\nbread, or anything. The other thing that they used to give us in the evenings, they used to\ngive us a bowl of soup and the soup consisted of just...1t was liquid and it had a little bit\nof a vegetable in it but one day in my soup I found a little piece of meat. A little piece of\nmeat. I still see it to this day. And I ate that piece of meat and do you know that I can still\ntaste it. I still know what it looks like and do you...nothing in my whole life is every\ngoing to taste as good as that little piece of meat. How it found it's way to me I don't\nknow, but that's the only time that I had meat. That's about all that I can remember\ngetting or eating there except my mother worked in the kitchen, so I had dysentery.\nPeople got terribly sick with various diseases because the sanitary conditions were non-\nexistent. Like I never saw any running water. The barrack that we were staying in, it\nleaked. So sometimes my mother, she would have a container and she would try and\ncollect as much water as possible and I think we used that for drinking. We used it for\nvarious things that we needed, maybe washing off a little bit. I don't remember taking a\nshower, bath, nothing. We were dirty. We had lice. We had lice in our hair. We had lice\non our clothing. And I remember my sister, she had terrible sores because these lice, they\nmade you scratch, and she had sores all over her legs, all over her arms and body, and in\nthe evening my mother would try and take her clothes off but the clothes would stick to\nthe sores and she would cry terribly. The one strange thing that happened in that camp\nwas that we used to get uh people from Switzerland. A woman would come...I mean it\nwas a lady. She would come. She was from the uh Red Cross. She would come and as\nchildren we'd go to this one barrack where we used to be able to uh play certain games\nand she would be there and she would sing songs for us. I remember this because she\nused to yodel. That's the first time I heard any yodeling. And she would distribute those\nlittle triangles of cheese. One piece of cheese per person. Well, it would have been better\nif she hadn't done it at all because what happened was we were like animals and some of\nus were stronger than other people and because we were so hungry, terrible fights used to\nbreak out again amongst us children. We used to try and get away the cheese from each\nother, and I...as a matter of fact my sister to this day holds it against me...being older,\nbeing stronger than her, I used to grab the cheese away from her, and she oft...she\noften...that's one of the things she always used to say to me. She says, Bea, how could\nyou have done this to me. I was starving like you. How could you take the cheese. But I\ndid it. I took the cheese away from her and so I don't understand...I never could\nunderstand how how how come they did something like that. They knew we were terribly\nhungry. We were starving. And yet they came and they went back, and they didn't do\nanything. They they saw the way we were living. And...but that didn't happen too often. I\nremember maybe two, three times during that time...I was there almost a year...",
        "Q: Which camp was this, Bea?",
        "A: This, this was at Gurs. And uh it was, it was a terrible thing to do to us and it didn't help\nus any. By then I, we had been there maybe a year. I was very homesick for my father.\nUh and I would, I would listen to grown-up's conversation, and I knew where the man's\ncamp was, and maybe because I listened uh I got it into my head that I want to visit my\nfather, no matter what. I, I...the urge was so strong. I had to see my father. So I told my\nsister about it. I said I want to see our father, and she says you are absolutely crazy. First\nof all, they're not going to let you. They'll shoot us before they'll let you do it. I said I\ndon't care. I want to see our father. Will you come with me? Very reluctantly my sister\ncomes with me and I take her hand and we go to the entrance of the camp. The guard\ncomes out of his guardhouse and he must have asked where were, where we want to go\nand I told him. He must have given me a certain amount of resistance. I don't remember\nthe exact conversation, but one thing I remember is that I didn't have any respect for our\nguards. I wasn't even that scared of them. I just had no respect for them. I felt I was\nsuperior to them, and I don't know why, where that feeling even came from. And because\nof that I think I was able to do what I did, because there we were having a bit of an\nargument and like I say, I don't remember the exact conversation. The one thing that I\nremember about it is that I kicked him on his boot and I said to him, \"tu sale cochon\",\nwhich means you dirty pig. And I take my sister's hand and we...I said to her, what ever\nyou do Suzie, don't look back, and we march out of that camp and we, I thought for sure\nhe would shoot us in the back. I really expected it, but he didn't. We marched and we\nmarched and to this day I still can see that route. That concentration camp was very close\nto the Pyrenees. You could see the Pyrenees, and the Pyrenees were throwing a shadow\nover the road, and after the shadow I still can see that sun shining and we walked down\nthat road and I find the camp where the men are, and somebody must have...yeah,\nsomebody did. Somebody took us to my father. I don't remember everything about that\nvisit, but one thing I've never forgotten...just during that time they were giving everyone\neggs. Just an egg. And I was so surprised to see an egg, because we had never gotten an\negg at the camp. Even in Germany it was very hard to get eggs and I've always loved\neggs, so if they were giving each man an egg, I thought ummm....my father surely will\nshare that egg with us. I know he will. My father opens up the egg. So did the other\npeople. It was a raw egg. And I look at my father, and he was shaking for some reason as\nhe was looking at the egg, so I go look at the egg and low and behold there's blood in the\negg. Well an orthodox Jew will not eat an egg with blood in it. It's unclean. It's not\nkosher, but I thought oh, he'll make an exception. He'll, he'll eat some of it and give us\nsome surely. We're starving after all. But my father takes the egg and throws it against\nthe wall of the barrack and I could hardly believe it, but I look at that yellow ooze\nrunning down the wall and I thought to myself, I'm going to go lick it before 1t touches\nthe floor, and I go and run for it, but I made the mistake of turning around as I ran,\nbecause I, I knew I was...I...I...what I was doing was not right, and I looked at my father's\nface and I stopped. I could not do it. My father took us in his arms and we cried together.\nAnd I don't...that's something I just could never forget, that even though he was starving,\nwe were starving, he would not eat the egg that had blood in it and therefore not kosher.\nUh we got back to the women's camp and that's, that was, that's the big thing that I\nremember about that visit. Then uh my sister who like I say is four years younger than I,\nshe became very weak, very sickly, so one day my mother said it's...I'm going to send\nSuzie out of the camp so you have to say goodbye to her, and I said goodbye to my sister\nand I hated it because she was really my best friend and so it was just my mother and I\nand shortly after that they transferred us to another concentration camp by the name of\nRivesaltes...",
        "Q: Do you know...excuse me...do you know where Suzie went?",
        "A: At that time I did not know where she went. I just knew she...I said goodbye to her and\nthat was it, so then, like I say, we were transferred to the, to another concentration camp\nby the name of Rivesaltes and there it was much the same. The only thing is I must have\neven gotten hungrier because I remember going into the garbage, so I was in competition\nwith the rats and the mice. As a matter of fact there was talk about the rats being also\nstarving, not having enough food so they used to bite people. I became sick with cholera\nand uh they put me into like an infirmary. It was a little room and I remember there was a\nwindow with bars on it. One day I see my father's face and I could hardly believe it and I,\nI must have asked how come they let him come to see me, and he said it's because I'm\nbeing transferred to Marseilles. Well, I didn't think too much of it for some reason uh and\nI didn't realize that that was the last time that I saw my father, through that window. I got\nbetter and then one day my mother came for me, and as we walked back to the barracks I\nstill remember her saying to me, you know it's time that I sent you out of the camp too.\nOtherwise you won't last much longer. Now my mother, I remember watching her in the\nevenings when she would get undressed. She was like a skeleton. And also she started\ncoughing. She would cough at night and now I suspect she came down with TB. But I\nremember the coughing and I remember how skinny she was and also probably she gave\nus maybe some of the food that she should have eaten. I don't know. One day my mother\ntakes me to a place where there were other children and a truck, and then we were loaded\nup on that truck. I said goodbye to my mother, also not really realizing this would be the\nlast time I would ever see her. We said goodbye and the truck went out of the camp. It\nwas broad daylight. There was this organization called the OSE, Oeuvre de Secours des\nEnfants and they took out as many children as they could out of the concentration camps\nand they had homes across the southern part of France. I was moved fourteen different\ntimes and uh these homes...they were like chateaus or big mansions and we used to be\nmaybe a hundred, hundred and fifty, two hundred children in one of those homes. They\nwere, they tried to teach us French and also uh give us...they gave us French uh names\nlike I was born Beate and my name name turned into Beatrice. Uh they gave us...we\ndidn't have much schooling. We were really busy trying to, for instance we...to grow\nvegetables so we would have something to eat. Sometimes we came to these places. They\ndidn't even have enough beds or furniture so the boys would be uh building furniture. Us\ngirls, we would till the soil so we would have something to eat. They use...they used to\nteach us how to survive in the, in the forest. Uh what grasses, what weeds to eat because\nmany times we didn't have enough vegetables, so we would eat off the land. Uh we\njust...we were constantly moving all the time. We did our own cooking. We did our own\nuh washing of dishes and uh did everything ourselves. I really learned housekeeping in\nthose homes you might say. Uh we we learned how to write a little bit more. They always\nmade sure that we would write to our parents in the concentration camp. We had older\nchildren looking after the younger ones. Uh I received letters from my parents. As a\nmatter of fact I tried to send a package once to the concentration camp of bread. Uh I I\nhadn't...I... some reason bread became very very important to me and so one day I went\ninto the village and I tried to get...I got some bread and I made a package to send to the\ncamp. Whether my mother ever got it or not I have no idea and those homes were raided\nthough. And so they used to move us. I remember one night they woke us up and we\nwere moved by uh motorcycle. It was a terrible ride yet at the same time I found it very\nexciting. At other times we were moved by like farmer's cart with hay on top of us,\nbecause the countryside was also occupied and all these little towns were occupied and\nand a lot of the uh French were Na...Nazis. So we were moved from one place to the\nother. One day as I came to this home, a little girl comes and she brings me a blanket and\nI look at her, she looks at me, and I thought oh, she looks familiar, and I didn't recognize\nher right away because she didn't have any hair. Her hair was shaved and she had a\nbandage, and it took me maybe a couple of seconds to recognize my sister. And I could\nhardly believe it. It was pure coincidence. It was like a miracle that we found each other.\nWell we, needless to say, we were overjoyed and we hugged each other. As a matter of\nfact we would...we wouldn't let go of each other for the longest time. We were quite\ninsecure. I remember being terribly insecure and I used to scratch my he...my head all the\ntime and uh I used to think, what's going to happen to us? What's going to happen to us\nwhen the war is over with? Will my parents be alive? Will we find them again? Will we\nfind each other again? But I also learned something during those days, that maybe\nbecause the times were so terrible that I learned that what goes on around you is one\nthing and what goes on within you can be another thing. Because I found myself having\nperfectly happy moments. And it was a strange revelation.",
        "Q: Tell us about some of those moments.",
        "A: I remember once we were, we were in this uh convent and and these moments came all of\na sudden, for no reason at all. I was going down the stairs and I was going to be with\nsome other girls and on those stairs this happiness comes over me, just like that and I\nthink it was...I was alive. I was able to go down the stairs and it it was, you know, the\nsituation was terrible. I didn't know...at that time I didn't know where my sister was. I\ndidn't know where my parents was, but I was joining a group of friends and for some\nreason that made me happy and also what was so important in those times was my Jewish\nidentity. It helped me tremendously. I had something in common with other people. And\nI knew that other Jews were taking care of me and it gave me a sense of family and that\nwas very important and and finding out all of this on my own...nobody telling me this,\ngave me a sense of security because I knew that within I was alright. The things that were\nhappen...were happening outside uh could only touch me if I let them touch me, and this\nwas the most important lesson I think that I've learned in my whole life. Uh and it's true I\nmade also a lot of friends during that time, good friends. Uh and these friends, they\nhelped me an awful lot to get through it and I hope that I was able to help some of these\npeople too. I don't know. I did meet up with some later on and we stayed in those homes\nuntil 194....1943.",
        "Q: Could you...before you move on...could you tell me...you said that you were, you were in\na convent at one point. Can you tell me a little bit about the convent...",
        "A: Yes. This is...I'm coming to it. (laughter) So we were in those homes until 1943. Well, in\n1943 Hitler became even in a bigger hurry to kill all the Jews so these homes were\nbombed. They were not raided anymore. Now this was getting to be serious business, and\nthis organization...what to do with all of these children that they had on their hands.\nSome of the children went into private Christian homes. Some of us, my sister included,\nwent to a convent. That convent was in Milleau (ph), in the southern central part of\nFrance. A little town. And life in the convent was completely different than what we had\never known. As a matter of fact I had hardly given it a thought that I knew some people\nwere Christians, gentiles, but we were used to calling the others but I had never really\nmixed with anybody especially that was not Jewish. I had lived in a Jewish world, so this\nwas different. I learned about baby Jesus, for instance. And the story was so appealing to\nme and what happened was that I became...I thought to myself, this 1s nice. Why\nshouldn't I turn Catholic? And I wanted to turn Catholic. I liked the convent. The sisters\nwere very very kind. Uh as a matter of fact only one sister really knew that we were\nJewish. The others did not know. It was a school convent so we learned catechism. I\nknow a lot about the Catholic religion. We went to church. It's true we could not\nta...partake of communion and I don't know really how they got around that, but we did\nnot take communion but we did everything otherwise what the other Christian children\ndid. There too the older ones took care of the younger ones. I remember I took care of a\nlittle girl, and I still remember her name. Her name was Violet. Now she was a little\nCatholic girl. She had a problem. She would not let anybody touch her. She had a mental\nproblem. But I liked that little girl. I still remember how she looked. She had curly hair,\ndark curly hair. She had kind of a dark skin and I liked that. I always was so white that I\nalways liked somebody that had a dark skin, so I took a liking to her but I knew that if I\nwould touch her she would pull away. But I used to kind of flirt with her. I used to smile\nat her, talk to her, and eventually I was able to just play a game with her of touching and\nsoon we became friends and I was able to touch her. And that gave me a lot of\nsatisfaction, because I was the only one. In that convent we also uh had food. It's true we\nhad chestnuts for breakfast, for lunch and dinner, but 1t was food. But to this day I don't\nlike chestnuts. On Sundays we used to get chocolate milk, but it isn't chocolate milk like\nwe have here. It was like a very...almost like a between a pudding and between a\nchocolate milk. It was very thick, but I loved it. It was delicious. And uh we had bread.\nWe had soups. We even had some meat once in a blue moon, and...but we were not\nstarving anymore and we slept between two sheets, which was luxury. We used to uh do\nwork for the village. I learned how to sew, how to do embroidery. I learned how to knit.\nWe also were farmed out to farmers and I learned how to cut grapes and also uh to pull\nweeds and to pull bugs off potato leaves because they didn't have insecticides in those\ndays, so this was done by hand. And we used to do things like that.",
        "Q: OK. Could we at this point pause? We need to change tapes and then we'll come back to\nthe convent.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: OK. Uh tell me more about the convent. Tell me, tell me what con...what it was like\nbeing in the convent.",
        "A: OK. It was (cough), it was very nice. I happened to like it. Uh the sisters had a lot of faith\nand when bombings were going on, for instance, instead of going down to the basement,\nthey would have us go out in the in the yard and uh we would hold hands and uh we\nwould just form a circle and dance around and the only protection that we would have\nwould be a piece of wood that we we would put between our teeth and the bombs would\nfall and there we were, just dancing around. It's true though that they had a big sign on\nthe roof, and I forgot what it was...saying that they couldn't bomb the convent because it\nwas a convent. There was some kind of a sign saying you cannot bomb here but you\nknow, whether that would hold true that they would honor that or not who knows, but\nthat's what 1t was and nothing ever did happen.",
        "Q: OK. We need to stop the tape...\nPAUSE",
        "Q: Tell me about the convent and bombing raids on the convent. You had started a story.",
        "A: OK. In the convent, when uh the air raids would start, we didn't go down in the basement.\nWhat we used to do, we used to out into the court...1nto the courtyard, and there we\nwould hold hands and dance around the circle. And the only protection that we used to\nhave was a piece of wood that we would take between our teeth so we would not bite our\ntongue, and it's true that there was a sign on the roof of the convent letting the planes\nknow that they should not bomb the convent, but whether they would actually uh do this\nor or not, we really weren't that sure, so we were scared. But the sisters, they had a lot of\nfaith and that's the way we did it, and I'm here to tell the story. Uh the other thing that I\nremember is that one day we were walking...we always used to walk to church two by\ntwo, and we were in uniforms. I used to stand out because I had blond hair. The children,\nmost of the children who were French, have dark hair. Dark hair, usually a darker skin,\nbut my hair no one had cut for quite some time so it was very long, very blond. I looked\nvery very German. While Milleau was occupied and there were Nazis walking all over\nthe place and as we walked towards the church, suddenly a Nazi comes up to me, started\nstroking my face, started stroking my hair, and I was petrified. I could not look at him. I\nwas trembling. And it was just fortunate that the sister who had been walking in front of\nthe line just happens to turn around and saw what was going on. She came towards him\nand started talking to him and he let me alone. And thank God I had the presence of mind\nnot to open up my mouth. It was a frightening experience. Uh the other thing that I\nremember is that, like I say, I liked the story of Jesus. I was really taken up by it and I\nwant to convert. And I told the sisters, I said to that one sister, I said, . 1 still\nremember her name... , | would like to become Catholic. And she would shake\nher head and she says, I don't know. I don't know. I don't think your fath...your father and\nmother would like that, and I would say, it would be so much easier. And it's true. I was\nthinking it would be so much easier to be a Christian than to be Jewish but somehow I\nnever did do it. But they are children, and many of them who did convert and who after\nleaving the convent did become Christians or were adopted by Christian families. We lost\nan awful lot of kids that way. But my sister and I, we stayed Jewish. Also we were in two\ndifferent convents. My sister, she had...by then she still was sickly and she also was\nstarting to come down with TB. So in those years whenever you had something like that,\nthey said you should go out in the country, so they sent my sister...at first they just\nwanted to send my sister out to the country to another convent, and I argued with them\nand I said to them, if you send my sister, I go. And I was very stubborn and so they had\nus both go and we went to Balmal (ph), to another convent and there it was, it was a\nfarming convent and we used to help take care of some of the livestock. Well one day the\nsister told me take care of this cow, to take her to a certain pasture. Well, I've never been\ngood at directions and I took her to the wrong pasture because when I came back with\nher, the poor cow was all bloated and the sister was furious with me. She says from now\non I cannot trust you with the cows, so you're going to have to feed the pigs. I know you\ncan't do anything wrong feeding the pigs, so here I was, a nice little Jewish girl who\ndoesn't eat any pork, feeding the pigs. Uh we learned how to church butter and we ate\nbutter for the first time in years, and oh did it taste good but the only trouble is we had a\nlittle bit of butter. We didn't have enough bread. At least it wasn't enough bread for me,\nand I was always hungry for bread, butter and jelly. I used to dream about food. We\nstayed in that convent until the war was almost over with and then this organization took\nus back and we went back to one of the homes. And there we stayed until it was over.",
        "Q: Tell us, tell us about the home and tell us first...did you find out...you had met up with\nyour sister. Did you find out where she had been?",
        "A: Uh not really. We didn't talk about things like that that much. It was...our talk was more\nabout the everyday things, you know...what we were going to...eating was of the utmost\nimportance. We always talked about food. Uh we used to do a lot...I remember I used to\ndo a lot of running. Again the older children took care of younger children. I seemed to\nhave a certain aptitude to take care of like uh...I remember I took care of a boy who was a\nuh hemo...hemophilia I think...where they bleed. I had to be very careful with him. Uh II\nhad to make sure that he would not run, that he wouldn't cut himself and I used to take\nhim for walks. We used to sit under the tree for hours at a time, and uh he was my\nresponsibility at times I remember. Uh and then I used to take care of other children. And\nuh we were, we were busy walking, exercising, uh like I say learning about what we\ncould eat, what we couldn't eat, and also sitting down and learning French. We used to\nplay games. Uh we had uh we used to dance like I learned to dance the __ there because\nwe were all Jewish...butt different...there were children from Poland. There were children\nfrom Hungary, from all different nationalities, uh not only German. And I learned how to\nspeak a little Yiddish, so it was...uh I don't know. We didn't even...I don't think we even\ndid that much. For the most...we were weak. We didn't weigh very much, and we\nconcentrated more or less on our health and what we had to eat. Uh oh we washed\nclothes. I was always very particular as to how I look, and I...this story I got from my\nsister. She used to say whenever there...because in many of those chateaus they were old.\nThere was no running water for instance, so we had to take a bath in a lake but winter\ntime comes. It was too cold and most of the children wouldn't do it, but here I was, taking\nmy bath in the lake, no matter how cold it was. Or I would wash clothes out which a lot\nof the other children wouldn't do, and uh as a matter of fact I...there was a doctor. I\nremember him because he used to come to the home on horseback and uh he used to be\nquite fond of me and uh he used to call me Mignon (ph) which means sweet in French\nand uh he had another name for me which I...which escapes me now, and uh he was very\nnice. He was very special. The other thing that I had was a paren (ph), a god mother. And\nusually I don't tell this story but I think here it's OK to...you know, I should tell it. Uh she\nwould send me money every month and there I had this money. As a matter of fact it's in\nmy documents, her name is, and uh she would send me money and I had all this money\nand I didn't really know what to do with all that money but I just saved it and once in a\nwhile some...we would get, we would be able to go into town and so I would buy a\nfountain pen with it. I bought some uh uh shoe polish with it once, and uh I quarreled\nwith my sister because she used too much shoe polish, as a matter of fact. I said to her, do\nyou think that I can spend all this money on shoe polish and you use it all. She\nremembers that too. She remembers all the terrible things I did to her, and one day we\nhad gone into Paris and I bought all the children ice cream and I felt likeabig\nbecause I had all that money, and why I had that power I don't know to this day. But she\nwanted to adopt me. Later on I found out, but she wouldn't take my sister and I wouldn't\ngo without my sister and that was after the war. As a matter of fact when the war was\nover with this organization having all of us on their hands, one of the things they did was\nadvertise in the , which is a German-Jewish newspaper and it circulates in Israel,\nPalestine in those days, and in New York and England and my grandmother was the first\none to read the advertisement that the org...that they had put in that paper saying that they\nBeata and Suzie Stern were looking for any living relatives and it was from my\ngrandmother that we heard first. She sent us a letter.",
        "Q: From where?",
        "A: From Israel, Palestine. And I was over-joyed. I thought oh, my grandmother is alive.\nBecause by then I was constantly worried...would anybody be alive and what would\nbecome of us. I mean can you imagine. Here we were. Two little girls and realizing that\ntheir...the letters from our parents had stopped after a while we were in those homes. So I\nknew something happened to them. Also by then there were a lot of rumors going around.\nI mean I don't know whether...I don't know whether we knew about Auschwitz and all\nthose terrible camps or not. I really don't remember. I just remember something terrible\nwas happening to people, but it was not a descriptive type of a information that I received\nor or knew. I just knew something terrible happened. As a matter of fact, after I didn't\nhear from my parents, I became uh very scared and I wouldn't talk for a while. They had\na hard time getting me to talk again because I was so afraid. Uh and I used to constantly\nworry...think what will become of us? What's going to happen to Suzie and I? So when I\nheard from my grandmother it was just really something to me, and then my uncle also\nwrote, and soon we heard from my aunts in New York City and my uncle and aunt in\nLondon. Well, everybody wanted us. They all said, come to us. We'll see that you get out\nand we'll take care of you. So we had a choice but this paren, she also wanted me and she\neven said what a wonderful life you will have with me. I, I had...I always wrote her thank\nyou and she communicated with me too whether I don't...I haven't found any of her letters\namongst the letters that I have but there was some kind of communication and it must\nhave been by word mou...mou...mouth and word. And I just know she also wanted to\nadopt me. But I said no, because she wouldn't take my sister. I want to go to Palestine\nbecause I remembered my grandmother, but my sister said no. Let's go to London,\nbecause that's the shortest route. Now we have been traveling all this time, constantly,\nand my sister probably was even more tired than I was. And so she thought, well, it's the\nshortest route. Let's go to England, London. So I said OK. So one day they took us to\nParis to process all the papers I imagine and this...there was a lady in who was a\nfriend to one of my aunts and she knew that my mother was in the concentration camp, so\nmy aunt had told her about us and that we might see her and to watch out for us and low\nand behold, we met up with her and to this day I call her Tanta Santa (ph). And she came\nwith us to Paris and on the train, I remember I had all this money and I thought to myself,\nI don't need this money anymore. I should give it away. And I said to Santa, I said to her,\nyou know, I'd like to give this money to a library. Why to a library? Why I want to give\nthe money away? I don't know. But I said to her, I don't need this money. Take this\nmoney and give it to a library. So I gave her the money. Now it's interesting...at that time\nI really didn't know it was to her that I gave the money. I found that out years and years\nlater when I discussed this part of my life with her, and she said to me, Beata (ph), you\ngave me that money. It was me you gave it to. And I saw to it that that money went to a\nJewish library. And like I say, what prompted me to do this I don't know. Then uh also\nthe other thing we did while we were in Paris was Tanta Santa and I, she had lost her\nhusband. She didn't know where her husband was. I didn't know whether...where my\nparents were. I didn't know there was a cousin who I was very fond of...his name was\nRobert...and his mother who was, had been in the concentration camp with my mother,\nAunt Clara...I want to find out where all these people had gone to, where they were,\nwhether they were still alive, and they had lists in certain places...they must have been\npublic places, so we went in Paris to all these different places and we would look at these\nlists, looking for my parents and other relatives and she looking for her moth...for her\nhusband. We would go from one place to the other and it was terrible for us because we\nwould never see the names, so we knew, you know, they were gone. And we did that...we\nwere...I, I had forgotten...we were a few days there, and we never did find any of the\nnames, but we always, every morning I remember we used to have hope and we would go\nout and she would take me around. Every evening we would come home dead tired and\nwe felt so bad, so desolate and so sad. Then after a few days it was time to board the ship,\nSO we went and it was one of the first ships to leave Calais...",
        "Q: Excuse me. I think you need to back up to explain something for me. Your aunt, or as\nyou called her your aunt, had taken you from to Paris.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Alright. How did you make arrangements to go where with her?",
        "A: Well, she did. She made all the arrangements. I...that was out of my hands because I\ndidn't know Paris. I was just...I was by then twelve years old, so I didn't know that much\nbut I knew...she wanted...I wanted to go with her because I must have been...I was very\nclose to her and when, probably when she said she was looking for her husband, I must\nhave said well I'd like to look for my parents and for my Aunt Clara and so I used to go\nwith her and she remembers me doing this. And uh that's how, but then she stayed in\nParis. She didn't come on ship and then we were about uh I think we were about fifteen,\nsixteen children who boarded that ship and we went to England. It was one of the first\nships to leave Calais and suddenly there were rumors on board that the waters were\nmined, and we thought, oh my God. We've come this far to be blown up. And uh we got\nscared but after a while we noticed there was uh mine sweepers going ahead of us and\neverything was alright, or not quite alright because there was a storm and it was such a\nrough voyage...most of us kids were throwing up all over and we were so sick and so\nmiserable. Lucky for us there were some Waves aboard and that was my first experience\nmeeting Americans. And they were wonderful. Absolutely wonderful to us. They took\ncare of us. Washed our faces. Cleaned our clothes off and made it bearable. Well we\narrived in England and then we took the train to London and there was my uncle who had\ncome to meet us, and uh I was over-joyed at seeing them. Being with a family again.\nLiving in a regular house. It it was wonderful. My aunt spoke French, which was good. I\nby then had a hatred for Germany. I hated the idea that I was born in such a country. I\nwas ashamed. I was ashamed of being German. I was almost ashamed of myself. Where\nall these feelings came from I don't know exactly but I was... was ashamed. I didn't want\nto speak German, so my aunt spoke French with us and uh they were good to us, but\ntimes were difficult. They lived in a house where the windows were all broken, because\nof the bombings there and there was cardboard on the windows. Uh food was rationed. I\nremember my aunt tried so hard to uh get sugar so she could bake some cakes, or even\njust bake. Uh we had to start going to school there. My aunt thought it would be good if\nwe started school, but at first she uh used to tutor so we would learn English, and he was\nwonderful. We came out of the camps and and at that time, through those homes, in fairly\ngood condition except we had calluses on our feet. We didn't have shoes and we used to\ngo bare-footed so much of the time, so the calluses were about an inch thick and it was\nvery painful after a while, these calluses, and we had to go to a foot doctor and slowly get\nall that layer of callus taken off. Uh the doctor was so nice. Uh my aunt still talks about\nhim to this day because he would not accept a penny for any of it when he heard our story\nbecause he had never seen feet that callused. Oh, I forgot to tell you too and the only\nother shoe that I remember wearing was in the convent they gave us some which\nare wooden shoes. But they are also very hard because we didn't have the nice little\nslippers to fit into the \u2014_ so we used to just wear the wooden show and most of the\ntime I didn't like them. They didn't feel very comfortable and so I used to kick them off\nand just walk bare-footed. But we suffered, I suffered very badly from uh those calluses.\nUh we were malnourished to some extent but my aunt managed to get us as much food as\npossible and we were under the doctor's care, the foot doctor care and this and that. Uh I\nstarted to school. It was a Jewish school. My aunt and uncle were orthodox. We lived in\nStanford Hill, London, and there were a lot of Hasidim (ph) and it was a lovely area. I\nabsolutely loved it and it was good living uh there. I felt I was again with my family, so\nuh I started this uh Victor (ph) High School, but it was hard for me. I could not sit still. I\ndidn't have any patience. I always wanted to be on the go. And it was too hard for me\nbecause not only was I learning English, they were teaching us a awful lot of Hebrew, the\n. We studied __. It was all too much. I was just overcome because I had never\nhad any really formal Hebrew uh lessons before, and finally I told my aunt I don't want to\ngo back to school. I just don't want to go. At first she more or less told me yes I had to\ngo, so I got in to trouble at school and the teachers must have contacted her and that was\nthe end of my schooling. And so she had me take uh sewing lessons because I was\nquite...I was good at sewing and my uncle had a...he manufactured handbags in the\nhouse, so I learned how to use the sewing machines and I would help him with that, but\nagain it was sitting and I just could not sit. So he says OK, if you can't sit how about\ngoing to uh to some of the people I do business with and I'll give you samples of my\nhandbag and you show it to them and see whether they want to buy any. So I went to\nthese different uh places and uh showed the samples and I would take the orders, bring\nthem back to my uncle. He would box them up in big boxes and I still remember shipping\n(ph) them on the bus and the subway and taking them to the various businesses and so\nthat was my job. My other job was taking care of my little cousin and I made myself\nquite useful and I alwa...my aunt always gave me money. She says since you work for\nme, here's money. So I had money again, and I always used to go to the movies with my\nfriends and I had a very good social good life. Uh we stayed in England until 1947. Then\nmy...I had two aunts in New York and an uncle and they decided it would be best for us\nto come to New York City. And also one of the reasons was that my father had written\nthem a letter saying that if anything should happen to him or his wife, that we are to go to\nthem, because they were the sisters of my mother. So they took this letter and they said\nthis is your father's wish so this is what you should do. Well, they had trouble with me\nagain. I didn't want to leave England. I loved it there. I liked the religious life. Uh I liked\nliving among the Hasidim (ph) because they were so joyful. I loved going to the... had a\ngirlfriend. She was Hasidish and I would enjoy going to services with her and I\nenjoyed...I remember attending the weddings and it seems almost every week somebody\nwas getting married. Anyhow this was our social outlet and I just loved it, and my aunts\nhad a hard time convincing me to come to New York. But uh then at the end of uh\nOctober in '47, by plane, we came to uh New York City and I don't know how much\nmore of my story you want or not.",
        "Q: Bea, you went to high school. What did you...",
        "A: I went to high school in New York. Now on one year of schooling in Germany, the little\nbit I had in England, somehow I managed to get into high school. I had to take a test, but\nI passed it. But I remember the principal when I told him how little schooling I had, he\nwas very doubtful that I could even pass the test, and uh he says it really would be better\nif you would start elementary school. And he probably was right, but I didn't want to\nbecause I wanted to be with my own peers. And so I started high school and I graduated\nbut my goal in life was to have a home, a husband and children. So two weeks after\ngraduating high school, I got married and uh soon after I started my family and I have\nfour daughters and three of them are married and I have five grandchildren.",

Uh I'm more thankful and also\nbecause I feel that I have survived that uh my speaking out on what happened in those\ndays is more or less uh saying well, you know, something terrible has happened to our\npeople, but I'm going to tell everybody that I can about it, and make sure that something\nlike that will never happen again.",

        "A: I'm uh Beatrice Pappenheimer, but I was born Beate Stern.",
        "A: I was born in Lauterbach, Germany. Lauterbach uh is a small town and it was uh October\n1932.",
        "A: OK. My family consisted of my parents and I have a sister who is three years younger\nthan I am, and at that time we had an uncle living with us. He was uh about nineteen\nyears old. He was still going to the university, and also uh my grandmother lived with us.\nAnd this is, this was our family unit.",
        "A: OK. In Lauterbach it was still mostly peaceful. Uh the only thing that I remember was\nthat my uncle used to come home from the university and he used to have uh many\narguments going on with my father, because my uncle would say, I can see the hand-\nwriting on the wall. I see what's coming. Let's get out of here. My father, he was an\northodox Jew. He had a lot of faith. He had faith in God. He had faith in people, and he\nthought, well, Hitler then...Hitler as much as what he's doing and what we're hearing, he's\nnot going to get away with it. And also probably he thought what am I going to do in a\ndifferent country, even Israel, or Palestine at that time, where things were pretty tough.\nHe didn't speak any language but German. He was in business. He had a textile business.\nWe owned a little store but he was on the road most of the time and my mother was in the\nstore. Uh as a matter of fact, I remember this because my grandmother used to take care\nof me. I, I think in those days I used to know my grandmother better than I knew my\nmother. As a matter of fact, I often think of my parents being very modern, today's\nparents like, because they both worked. My father had had a university education and I\nwas taken care of by the grandmother. And uh then the other thing that I remember was\nthat uh there was talk about a cousin dying. And I remember I had nightmares about that\nfor some reason. I was scared. That was the first time I knew what it was like to be scared\nof death, of something unknown. Uh that was my earliest recollection. I also...I remember\nplaying dead. Uh I would lay down in the living room floor and I would cross my hands\nover my chest and say to Grandma, I'm dead. So there was talk about people, I remember,\neven disappearing and dying, even that early. The next thing that I remember - one day\nmy parents came home and they were all agitated and uh the reason for it was they had to\ngo and register somewhere. And I remember something about that the men were called\nIsrael...they had a name and the women's name was Sara.\u2019 But my parents were terribly\nupset. They didn't like the idea that they had to give their names and addresses and\noccupation and I think also what it was they had to have permission to uh move. If they\nwant to move out if Lauterbach, they had to get permission, and that upset them to no\nend, and we stayed in Lauterbach until about 1936 when my father had to give up his\nstore and they also had to give up the house because Jews were not allowed to have any,\nhold any property anymore. So then we moved to Karlsruhe. One of the reasons we\nmoved to Karlsruhe was because my uh father had a brother and his family was living\nthere. I think so. And that...Karlsruhe was a__ big city, compared to Lauterbach, but we\nhad had a nice sized house in Lauterbach. In Karlsruhe it was a different story. When we\nfirst came there we moved into with my uh aunt and uncle and their three children, and\nthey just had a small apartment, so I remember us being five children in one bedroom.\nAnd we had a wonderful time as children but at the same time it was bedlam. And my\nuh...I remember my father and my uncle both trying to find us an apartment. Well, that\nwas very very difficult already in those days because many people wouldn't, if you were\na Jew they wouldn't rent you an apartment. They weren't allowed to. But finally my\nfather found an apartment above a bank and I think...well, this 1s the picture that I showed\nyou that I have a picture from. And uh it was a small apartment compared to the big\nhouse we had in Lauterbach which consisted of three rooms. The bathroom was out in the\nhallway and we shared it with other families but we had a a kitchen and the door opened\nfrom the hallway into the kitchen, so that was the main entrance and on the left side was\nthe living room and on the right hand side was was the bedroom. And there in Karlsruhe I\nwas old enough I had to start going to school. And uh school was very very different than\nwhat we have here in the United States. There were all man teachers. They were uh going\nby the uh Nazi theories and we had to learn how to say \"Heil Hitler\" and we had to uh we\nwere taught Nazi theories. I don't remember much of that. I just remember mostly uh that\nthey taught us a tremendous amount in one year, but they were extremely strict. It was\nperfectly alright for the teacher to hit you, and uh for the girls, I remember we had to go\nup to the front of the room, to the desk of the teacher, and it was always on a platform,\nand we would hold our hands out like so, the tips of our fingers, and he would take the\nruler and hit our hands that way. For the boys, he could slap them around wherever the\nhand would fall. We had to sit a certain way. We had to write a certain way. We could\nnot look out of the window and God forbid we should talk to each...to each other, or to\nthe teacher. You were only allowed to talk if the teacher addressed you. So it was\ncompletely different, but naturally I didn't realize that until years and years later. Also we\ndidn't like to go to school, mostly because on the way to school there were other children,\nnot Jewish, who would go after us and yell, dirty Jews, or Christ killer...all kinds of\nnames. They would push us, throw stones at us and we were very afraid and the same\nthing when we would come home. Sometimes we would duck into stores. I remember\none of the stores we used to run into was uh a big department store, and it had uh\nescalators and that was my first experience with an escalator. Uh, yes, the city of\n* decree August 17, 1938\nKarlsruhe was quite modern, and it was a beautiful city. I still remember the parks. I still\nremember the Schloss, or the palace that we used to go to that was in the park and every\nSabbath afternoon we would uh just walk around this since we were orthodox, so one of\nthe things you did, in the morning you would go to synagogue, in the afternoon you\nwould go to the park. And talking about synagogues, we didn't really have a synagogue\nthere. We used to have one in Lauterbach. I remember my father and I going to a regular\nsynagogue, but in uh Karlsruhe for some reason I never went to a regular synagogue. We\nwent where there was just like an apartment and it was two rooms - one room for the\nwomen and one room for the men, and there always had to be a guard in front of the\napartment building uh watching the place, so I don't know whether it was you were not\nallowed to hold services or not, but I just remember the guard. But as children we used to\nhave a good time running around and uh my parents being religious we used to go every\nFriday and...my father used to go Friday I should say. We used to stay home, wait for him\nto come home, and the on Saturday mornings we used to all go to synagogue, and it was\na religious thing, but I think it was also social because we had a chance to meet with\nother people then. Uh we went to school there for about a year, and then Hitler closed all\nthe schools to Jewish children.\u201d We were not allowed to attend the public schools\nanymore. And after that my father tried to teach us as much as possible. Uh I remember\nas we used to uh sometimes go for a walk with one of my parents or with both of them,\nwe used to see signs in front of stores saying Juden verboten. Not only uh stores but also\npublic buildings and even parks. And our lives became more and more restricted. Uh one\nday as children we were playing outside in the street because that was the only place\nwhere we could play, and two Nazis came along and we picked up some little pebbles out\nof the gutter and started throwing those pebbles at them. By then we had a hatred for the\nNazis. Well, they got tired of the game, and they turned around and they started yelling at\nus and going after us, and it was just fortunate that we knew the streets and the alleys of\nKarlsruhe a little better than they did. But my mother, she had been watching from the\nliving room window and she saw the whole episode and when we came back upstairs she\nwas absolutely furious, and she says, I can't trust you to play outside by yourselves\nanymore. From now on, either you have to have your father or I along, so that restricted\nour movement. Uh we used to see parades. We lived uh where there was right opposite\nfrom our apartment, there was like a uh public square and there was a tall uh column, you\nmight say, and I don't know uh what it was all about uh but they used to have parades, uh\nthe brown shirts and some of the other Nazi movements, and I as a child, I loved uh\nlistening to the music. I used to love to listen to the parade and the marching, never\nthinking anything that much of it. I knew my parents were against it, but it sounded so\npretty, so I would go to the window of our living room and look out. And one day my\nmother came up behind me and she hit me on my behind and she said I don't want you\nlooking out of the window. So I couldn't do that anymore. Uh like I say, our lives were\nvery very restricted, plus scary at the same time because I remember my mother saying to\nmy father, now be sure you're back by nig...uh night time. I don't want to have to worry\n* Jewish children could only go to Jewish schools: Nov., 1938; no school for Jewish children at\nall: July 1, 1942.\nabout you. And one of the reasons was that uh there were a lot of muggings going on and\npeople just disappearing, so my mother always used to say, be...be home before it's dark,\nand I remember there were times when my father wasn't home and she would pace the\nkitchen floor, back and forth, back and forth. So life for my parents must have been\nterribly tough, terribly uncertain and I, I remember the arguments between them a lot uh\nfor one reason or another. Also because uh some of the shops were closed to us it was\nhard even to know where to get your bread, where to get your food. It was tough. I had\none experience that I shall never forget was that one day uh I went over to see my\ngirlfriend, and she lived right across the street from us, and I go upstairs...she lived also\nin an apartment...and uh I knocked on the door. The mother opens up the door and she's,\nand she says to me, oh it's you. I don't want you playing anymore here. And she just shut\nthe door in my face. And that was the last I saw of this friend. And I gather that she\nwasn't Jewish, and by then, and I forgot exactly what year it was...could have been\nprobably 1937, '38...they couldn't, they they could not fraternize with you any more, but\nthat hurt. And I still carry that hurt. Uh the next thing that I can tell you about is that uh\none night we woke up and there was a lot of commotion in the street and as I\nremembered looking out of the window, I saw fires all over the place. It was as though\nthe whole city of Karlsruhe was burning, but I remember saying something...my father\nwas saying uh the synagogues are burning. They're burning all the synagogues. So he\nquickly got dressed and went downstairs and I remember my mother and my sister and I\nwaiting up for my father to come home again. And he didn't come home. And we waited\nand we waited all night. He never came home. We found out...and I don't remember when\nI found this out, but now I can tell you that he had been taken like a lot of other men that\nnight, rounded up and they were taken to concentration camps and he was taken to\nBuchenwald. I don't remember how long he was gone, but I shall never forget the day he\ncame back, and at first I didn't know it was him, because the kitchen door opens up and\nthere stands this man...he was bent over. My father had...he was a short man but he had\nalways been quite erect, but that day he was bent over and he had, he was all dirty and\nthere was blood on him and he was shaking. We had one of those old-fashioned uh black\nwood-burning stoves right across from the kitchen door, and when he opened up that\ndoor he started putting his hands, both hands, on that stove, and I knew it was hot, so I\nscreamed at him...Pa...and at that same instant, I recognized who he was, and I screamed,\nPapa, Papa, it's hot. And my screams brought my mother into the kitchen and she took\none look at him and I still remember her raising her hands and quickly going to him and\ntaking him into the bedroom. Well my father was sick, I guess, and uh it was lucky I\nthink that my mother had a little bit of nursing experience. Somehow she managed to get\nhim well, because we couldn't call a doctor by then, and uh...but he was never the same\nafter that. I don't think my father found work when we had come to uh Karlsruhe. I don't\nknow really what he did, except for one comment. One evening...I I I used to watch him.\nHis hands always hurt him, and one evening I remember we were sitting around the table\nand I said to him, how come your hands hurt you so much Father? And he said it's\nbecause I'm laying bricks and it's hard work and it hurts my hands. So he must have been\nmaybe put into forced labor and uh he was a brick-layer. He was never the same after\nthat. He stayed around the apartment quite a bit and maybe he was hiding. I don't know. I\ndon't know to this day how he managed to get out of Buchenwald. Uh I don't\nknow...some people I know if they paid enough money they were able to get out. Others\nthey escaped. I don't know how he did it. The next thing that I remember is uh that we\nhad bombings. The air raids started. The air raids would start up and we'd go down...first\nof all we had to pull our shades because we had, there was blackout, so we had to go\ndown...we pulled the shades, went down to the basement and there we huddled in the\nbasement. It was a big basement, because we lived in an apartment and the apartment\nhouses, several of them must have been connected so it was a community basement. And\none of the things that I remember and probably this whole episode I remember because of\nthat...my mother used to tell stories to everyone and one of her stories...I I smile at it\ntoday, and whether I believed her or not I don't know, but she would say...see this\nbasement. It has a rounded roof, and it did. It had a rounded roof. And we were all\nhuddled down there. Some of the children were crying. Some of the older people\nwringing their hands and saying what's going to become of us, and uh you didn't know\nwhether you would live from one minute to the next. You would hear the bombs falling\nand it was...it was terribly frightening. And here my mother tells the story...see this roof\nis rounded. If a bomb should fall, it's not going to come through. It's going to roll right\noff, and I must have laughed at it even at this time, because when ever I think about it, it\nmakes me laugh for some reason. And she would tell all kinds of different stories. She\nwould try to get everybody to sing songs, just anything just to take their minds off just a\nlittle bit of of the situation. Then the air raid sirens would blow again and we'd go\nupstairs. So we got used to that kind of a life uh...nights being interrupted by the sirens.\nSometimes even during the day. Then one day...it was late 1939,\u00b0 there was a loud knock\non the door. And there stood two Gestapo. My mother asked them, what do you want?\nAnd they said, don't ask any questions, and they yelled, just go and pack. And my mother\nsaid, well, how long are we going to be gone? How much should we pack? And they got\nangrier and angrier as she asked these questions, and they yelled louder and louder, and\nfinally they said, just go pack enough for two weeks, so my mother goes into the\nbedroom and she starts packing and I went into the living room because I had a doll that I\nloved very much and I used to take that doll where ever I went, so as I went into the\nliving room one of the Nazis followed me, and I go and pick up that doll and he says, he\nsays to me, and he also gets ahold of my arm and starts shaking me and saying, where\nyou're going you don't need this doll, and I look at him, and to this day I can see that face.\nAnd I and I said to him, if I can't have that doll...I thought for some reason that he wanted\nit... said to him, if I can't have that doll, you can't have her either. And I take the doll and\nI threw her down on the floor and her doll...and that doll was made...her face was made\nout of porcelain and broke into hundreds of pieces, and oh, that it got me so upset. As a\nmatter of fact I was so upset during that whole episode I don't remember my father or my\nsister. It seemed like the whole thing was played out between my mother and I for some\nreason, and yet I know they were there, but I don't remember them at all. My mother gets\ndone packing and we're about to go out, and I look around that apartment and I thought to\nmyself...we'll never see it again. And I look at my mother and I said to her as much. I\n* date uncertain\nsays I don't want to go. They're not going to let us see this place again. And I take ahold\nof the leg of the kitchen table and I...I wouldn't let go of it, and my mother had a terrible\ntime trying to get me out of the door, but little by little she calmed me and she managed\nto get me out. They took us to the railroad station, and there there were hundreds of\npeople, lots of people. And you could tell some of them had been waiting there for quite\nsome time, because they were laying on blankets, sitting on the suitcases. There were\nbabies crying. Older people again crying and uh it was just so confusing...everything. We\nwaited, I I forgot for how long, but after a while we lined up and they put us on a train.\nNow it was a regular train but we were squeezed in. There were so many of us. And I\nthought always because there was so many people on the train and I don't know whether\nthey'd slow (ph) or not that that's why the train went very slow. And it did. It went very\nslow, and especially going around a bend. It would really slow down, and because there\nwere So many people, it was very hot and the windows were open so some people\nthought they would escape and they jumped out of the windows, but they didn't realize at\nfirst that there were Nazis on the roof of the train, and they had guns and they shot those\npeople as they tried to get away from the train, and that was my first experience seeing\nsomeone die. I saw some being shot. It was terrible. And people were just...everybody\nwas very excited on the train, too. Then after a while the train stopped and it was at the\nborder of Germany and France. And then there was a voice over the loudspeaker and it\nsaid, if you have any money, get rid of it, or at least I thought that's what it said, because\nmy mother, she tried to hide some money on her and and I I was in a terrible state I guess\nbecause I saw her doing it and I started screaming at her, which I would never have dared\nto do under ordin...ordinary circumstances because you had a great great respect for your\nparents. But I said to her, don't do this. They're going to do something terrible to you, and\nsure enough, they had said over the loudspeaker that if you disobeyed orders, you would\nbe shot, and so I was just hysterical when I saw her doing that and so she says OK, take\nthe money and flush it down the toilet. So I go take the money and I go to the toilet and I\nflush it down, and I don't think...I don't know how much it was or anything...it was just a\nhandful...and then I came back and I walked through the corridor because there they have\ncompartments and I walked through the corridor and you can see into the compartments\nand there I saw the Nazis searching people and taking them out into the corridor and uh\nafter a while I noticed that they were lining them up on the platform outside. Pretty soon I\nhear the shots and true to their word they were shooting all the people who had tried to\nhide money on their person. But I didn't see...I just heard the shots...I didn't see anything\nbecause my mother took me against her body like and she hid my face against her. Then\nthe train went on, and like I said, there were so many people on the train, I didn't have a\nseat. My mother had a seat but I didn't, and after a while I made myself comfortable on\nthe floor. I just sat down on the floor and I remember I had a wall to lean against. I\nremember still seeing a fat lady sitting there and there was an old man and people\nstanding...somebody tall and thin and the train went on and on. I don't remember...there\nwas no food, nothing to drink, and I missed more not having anything to drink. I became\nvery very thirsty and my throat felt so dry, almost was like getting a sore throat, and I\ndon't remember how many days we were on the train. It just seemed like 1t went on and\non and on and on. I slept some and then suddenly the train stopped and we were able to\nget out but then they put us on trucks and I remember still the roughness of those of those\nNazis. Sometimes there was an old person who didn't walk fast enough for them, and\nthey would kick him, or they would pull a man's beard or they would hit them with their\nsticks that they had and always I heard the word, \"schnell, schnell\", which means quick,\nquick. Then we were put on those trucks and taken to the concentration camp. My first\nsight of that concentration camp what...my my...I became just desolate. There was barbed\nwire all around it and it looked all brown, grey and black. There wasn't any green for\ngrass. There were no leaves on the trees. It looked so desolate. It looked so sad. We were\ntaken off the trucks and then we were separated, the men from the women and we had to\nsay goodbye to my father and the women were taken to a big barrack and there they told\nus to get undressed and this time they looked for gold. We had little bracelets. They took\nthose. My mother, she had pierced earrings. They were round...they were hoop earrings\nand they pulled those earrings right off her ear lobe. They didn't even give her a chance to\ntake them off. They just pulled them, and I still her, hear her cry out to this day, and I\nremember her holding her hands like that to her ears. Then they gave us mattresses and\nthe mattress was very light, and I was surprised but the reason why it was so light was\nbecause it just contained straw. They assigned a bed for us. Now my mother and sister\nand I, we had only one bed to sleep on. We were about twenty-five to thirty people in a\nbarrack. We had just...there were just beds but they had like...they were they were\nframes, wooden frames, chicken wire and then we put the mattress on. There were no\nbunk beds. People tried to have a little privacy. Now I remember them, them hanging up\nmaybe some kind of a rag or cloth, and in each barrack there was a scale, and I was,\nreally at first | remember I was wondering what was the scale for. But I had a chance to\nfind out, because everyday they would throw one loaf of bread into the barrack, and they\nwould throw it. The women would go after that loaf of bread. At first it wasn't that bad,\nbut then when you...but then when we became hungrier and hungrier, things became\nworse and worse. And the reason I'm saying this is that we used to have one person to\ndiv...to divide up this loaf of bread, and it wasn't very big. It was regular loaf like that.\nBut to divide it up amongst, like I say, twenty-five to thirty people wasn't very easy, and\nalso I never saw any knives, forks or spoons. So one person was selected and she would\ntry and weigh bread as closely as possible so everybody would have the same amount.\nDidn't always work out that way because it was very difficult to do. So 1f one person\nwould get just a little bit more, the other women would jump on this person and they\nwould have terrible fights. These women who had been ladies turned like into animals\nalmost, just to have a little bit of more bread, but they were starving us, and when you are\nthat hungry it hurts and you will do almost anything, anything to get just a little bit of\nbread, or anything. The other thing that they used to give us in the evenings, they used to\ngive us a bowl of soup and the soup consisted of just...1t was liquid and it had a little bit\nof a vegetable in it but one day in my soup I found a little piece of meat. A little piece of\nmeat. I still see it to this day. And I ate that piece of meat and do you know that I can still\ntaste it. I still know what it looks like and do you...nothing in my whole life is every\ngoing to taste as good as that little piece of meat. How it found it's way to me I don't\nknow, but that's the only time that I had meat. That's about all that I can remember\ngetting or eating there except my mother worked in the kitchen, so I had dysentery.\nPeople got terribly sick with various diseases because the sanitary conditions were non-\nexistent. Like I never saw any running water. The barrack that we were staying in, it\nleaked. So sometimes my mother, she would have a container and she would try and\ncollect as much water as possible and I think we used that for drinking. We used it for\nvarious things that we needed, maybe washing off a little bit. I don't remember taking a\nshower, bath, nothing. We were dirty. We had lice. We had lice in our hair. We had lice\non our clothing. And I remember my sister, she had terrible sores because these lice, they\nmade you scratch, and she had sores all over her legs, all over her arms and body, and in\nthe evening my mother would try and take her clothes off but the clothes would stick to\nthe sores and she would cry terribly. The one strange thing that happened in that camp\nwas that we used to get uh people from Switzerland. A woman would come...I mean it\nwas a lady. She would come. She was from the uh Red Cross. She would come and as\nchildren we'd go to this one barrack where we used to be able to uh play certain games\nand she would be there and she would sing songs for us. I remember this because she\nused to yodel. That's the first time I heard any yodeling. And she would distribute those\nlittle triangles of cheese. One piece of cheese per person. Well, it would have been better\nif she hadn't done it at all because what happened was we were like animals and some of\nus were stronger than other people and because we were so hungry, terrible fights used to\nbreak out again amongst us children. We used to try and get away the cheese from each\nother, and I...as a matter of fact my sister to this day holds it against me...being older,\nbeing stronger than her, I used to grab the cheese away from her, and she oft...she\noften...that's one of the things she always used to say to me. She says, Bea, how could\nyou have done this to me. I was starving like you. How could you take the cheese. But I\ndid it. I took the cheese away from her and so I don't understand...I never could\nunderstand how how how come they did something like that. They knew we were terribly\nhungry. We were starving. And yet they came and they went back, and they didn't do\nanything. They they saw the way we were living. And...but that didn't happen too often. I\nremember maybe two, three times during that time...I was there almost a year...",
        "A: This, this was at Gurs. And uh it was, it was a terrible thing to do to us and it didn't help\nus any. By then I, we had been there maybe a year. I was very homesick for my father.\nUh and I would, I would listen to grown-up's conversation, and I knew where the man's\ncamp was, and maybe because I listened uh I got it into my head that I want to visit my\nfather, no matter what. I, I...the urge was so strong. I had to see my father. So I told my\nsister about it. I said I want to see our father, and she says you are absolutely crazy. First\nof all, they're not going to let you. They'll shoot us before they'll let you do it. I said I\ndon't care. I want to see our father. Will you come with me? Very reluctantly my sister\ncomes with me and I take her hand and we go to the entrance of the camp. The guard\ncomes out of his guardhouse and he must have asked where were, where we want to go\nand I told him. He must have given me a certain amount of resistance. I don't remember\nthe exact conversation, but one thing I remember is that I didn't have any respect for our\nguards. I wasn't even that scared of them. I just had no respect for them. I felt I was\nsuperior to them, and I don't know why, where that feeling even came from. And because\nof that I think I was able to do what I did, because there we were having a bit of an\nargument and like I say, I don't remember the exact conversation. The one thing that I\nremember about it is that I kicked him on his boot and I said to him, \"tu sale cochon\",\nwhich means you dirty pig. And I take my sister's hand and we...I said to her, what ever\nyou do Suzie, don't look back, and we march out of that camp and we, I thought for sure\nhe would shoot us in the back. I really expected it, but he didn't. We marched and we\nmarched and to this day I still can see that route. That concentration camp was very close\nto the Pyrenees. You could see the Pyrenees, and the Pyrenees were throwing a shadow\nover the road, and after the shadow I still can see that sun shining and we walked down\nthat road and I find the camp where the men are, and somebody must have...yeah,\nsomebody did. Somebody took us to my father. I don't remember everything about that\nvisit, but one thing I've never forgotten...just during that time they were giving everyone\neggs. Just an egg. And I was so surprised to see an egg, because we had never gotten an\negg at the camp. Even in Germany it was very hard to get eggs and I've always loved\neggs, so if they were giving each man an egg, I thought ummm....my father surely will\nshare that egg with us. I know he will. My father opens up the egg. So did the other\npeople. It was a raw egg. And I look at my father, and he was shaking for some reason as\nhe was looking at the egg, so I go look at the egg and low and behold there's blood in the\negg. Well an orthodox Jew will not eat an egg with blood in it. It's unclean. It's not\nkosher, but I thought oh, he'll make an exception. He'll, he'll eat some of it and give us\nsome surely. We're starving after all. But my father takes the egg and throws it against\nthe wall of the barrack and I could hardly believe it, but I look at that yellow ooze\nrunning down the wall and I thought to myself, I'm going to go lick it before 1t touches\nthe floor, and I go and run for it, but I made the mistake of turning around as I ran,\nbecause I, I knew I was...I...I...what I was doing was not right, and I looked at my father's\nface and I stopped. I could not do it. My father took us in his arms and we cried together.\nAnd I don't...that's something I just could never forget, that even though he was starving,\nwe were starving, he would not eat the egg that had blood in it and therefore not kosher.\nUh we got back to the women's camp and that's, that was, that's the big thing that I\nremember about that visit. Then uh my sister who like I say is four years younger than I,\nshe became very weak, very sickly, so one day my mother said it's...I'm going to send\nSuzie out of the camp so you have to say goodbye to her, and I said goodbye to my sister\nand I hated it because she was really my best friend and so it was just my mother and I\nand shortly after that they transferred us to another concentration camp by the name of\nRivesaltes...",
        "A: At that time I did not know where she went. I just knew she...I said goodbye to her and\nthat was it, so then, like I say, we were transferred to the, to another concentration camp\nby the name of Rivesaltes and there it was much the same. The only thing is I must have\neven gotten hungrier because I remember going into the garbage, so I was in competition\nwith the rats and the mice. As a matter of fact there was talk about the rats being also\nstarving, not having enough food so they used to bite people. I became sick with cholera\nand uh they put me into like an infirmary. It was a little room and I remember there was a\nwindow with bars on it. One day I see my father's face and I could hardly believe it and I,\nI must have asked how come they let him come to see me, and he said it's because I'm\nbeing transferred to Marseilles. Well, I didn't think too much of it for some reason uh and\nI didn't realize that that was the last time that I saw my father, through that window. I got\nbetter and then one day my mother came for me, and as we walked back to the barracks I\nstill remember her saying to me, you know it's time that I sent you out of the camp too.\nOtherwise you won't last much longer. Now my mother, I remember watching her in the\nevenings when she would get undressed. She was like a skeleton. And also she started\ncoughing. She would cough at night and now I suspect she came down with TB. But I\nremember the coughing and I remember how skinny she was and also probably she gave\nus maybe some of the food that she should have eaten. I don't know. One day my mother\ntakes me to a place where there were other children and a truck, and then we were loaded\nup on that truck. I said goodbye to my mother, also not really realizing this would be the\nlast time I would ever see her. We said goodbye and the truck went out of the camp. It\nwas broad daylight. There was this organization called the OSE, Oeuvre de Secours des\nEnfants and they took out as many children as they could out of the concentration camps\nand they had homes across the southern part of France. I was moved fourteen different\ntimes and uh these homes...they were like chateaus or big mansions and we used to be\nmaybe a hundred, hundred and fifty, two hundred children in one of those homes. They\nwere, they tried to teach us French and also uh give us...they gave us French uh names\nlike I was born Beate and my name name turned into Beatrice. Uh they gave us...we\ndidn't have much schooling. We were really busy trying to, for instance we...to grow\nvegetables so we would have something to eat. Sometimes we came to these places. They\ndidn't even have enough beds or furniture so the boys would be uh building furniture. Us\ngirls, we would till the soil so we would have something to eat. They use...they used to\nteach us how to survive in the, in the forest. Uh what grasses, what weeds to eat because\nmany times we didn't have enough vegetables, so we would eat off the land. Uh we\njust...we were constantly moving all the time. We did our own cooking. We did our own\nuh washing of dishes and uh did everything ourselves. I really learned housekeeping in\nthose homes you might say. Uh we we learned how to write a little bit more. They always\nmade sure that we would write to our parents in the concentration camp. We had older\nchildren looking after the younger ones. Uh I received letters from my parents. As a\nmatter of fact I tried to send a package once to the concentration camp of bread. Uh I I\nhadn't...I... some reason bread became very very important to me and so one day I went\ninto the village and I tried to get...I got some bread and I made a package to send to the\ncamp. Whether my mother ever got it or not I have no idea and those homes were raided\nthough. And so they used to move us. I remember one night they woke us up and we\nwere moved by uh motorcycle. It was a terrible ride yet at the same time I found it very\nexciting. At other times we were moved by like farmer's cart with hay on top of us,\nbecause the countryside was also occupied and all these little towns were occupied and\nand a lot of the uh French were Na...Nazis. So we were moved from one place to the\nother. One day as I came to this home, a little girl comes and she brings me a blanket and\nI look at her, she looks at me, and I thought oh, she looks familiar, and I didn't recognize\nher right away because she didn't have any hair. Her hair was shaved and she had a\nbandage, and it took me maybe a couple of seconds to recognize my sister. And I could\nhardly believe it. It was pure coincidence. It was like a miracle that we found each other.\nWell we, needless to say, we were overjoyed and we hugged each other. As a matter of\nfact we would...we wouldn't let go of each other for the longest time. We were quite\ninsecure. I remember being terribly insecure and I used to scratch my he...my head all the\ntime and uh I used to think, what's going to happen to us? What's going to happen to us\nwhen the war is over with? Will my parents be alive? Will we find them again? Will we\nfind each other again? But I also learned something during those days, that maybe\nbecause the times were so terrible that I learned that what goes on around you is one\nthing and what goes on within you can be another thing. Because I found myself having\nperfectly happy moments. And it was a strange revelation.",
        "A: I remember once we were, we were in this uh convent and and these moments came all of\na sudden, for no reason at all. I was going down the stairs and I was going to be with\nsome other girls and on those stairs this happiness comes over me, just like that and I\nthink it was...I was alive. I was able to go down the stairs and it it was, you know, the\nsituation was terrible. I didn't know...at that time I didn't know where my sister was. I\ndidn't know where my parents was, but I was joining a group of friends and for some\nreason that made me happy and also what was so important in those times was my Jewish\nidentity. It helped me tremendously. I had something in common with other people. And\nI knew that other Jews were taking care of me and it gave me a sense of family and that\nwas very important and and finding out all of this on my own...nobody telling me this,\ngave me a sense of security because I knew that within I was alright. The things that were\nhappen...were happening outside uh could only touch me if I let them touch me, and this\nwas the most important lesson I think that I've learned in my whole life. Uh and it's true I\nmade also a lot of friends during that time, good friends. Uh and these friends, they\nhelped me an awful lot to get through it and I hope that I was able to help some of these\npeople too. I don't know. I did meet up with some later on and we stayed in those homes\nuntil 194....1943.",
        "A: Yes. This is...I'm coming to it. (laughter) So we were in those homes until 1943. Well, in\n1943 Hitler became even in a bigger hurry to kill all the Jews so these homes were\nbombed. They were not raided anymore. Now this was getting to be serious business, and\nthis organization...what to do with all of these children that they had on their hands.\nSome of the children went into private Christian homes. Some of us, my sister included,\nwent to a convent. That convent was in Milleau (ph), in the southern central part of\nFrance. A little town. And life in the convent was completely different than what we had\never known. As a matter of fact I had hardly given it a thought that I knew some people\nwere Christians, gentiles, but we were used to calling the others but I had never really\nmixed with anybody especially that was not Jewish. I had lived in a Jewish world, so this\nwas different. I learned about baby Jesus, for instance. And the story was so appealing to\nme and what happened was that I became...I thought to myself, this 1s nice. Why\nshouldn't I turn Catholic? And I wanted to turn Catholic. I liked the convent. The sisters\nwere very very kind. Uh as a matter of fact only one sister really knew that we were\nJewish. The others did not know. It was a school convent so we learned catechism. I\nknow a lot about the Catholic religion. We went to church. It's true we could not\nta...partake of communion and I don't know really how they got around that, but we did\nnot take communion but we did everything otherwise what the other Christian children\ndid. There too the older ones took care of the younger ones. I remember I took care of a\nlittle girl, and I still remember her name. Her name was Violet. Now she was a little\nCatholic girl. She had a problem. She would not let anybody touch her. She had a mental\nproblem. But I liked that little girl. I still remember how she looked. She had curly hair,\ndark curly hair. She had kind of a dark skin and I liked that. I always was so white that I\nalways liked somebody that had a dark skin, so I took a liking to her but I knew that if I\nwould touch her she would pull away. But I used to kind of flirt with her. I used to smile\nat her, talk to her, and eventually I was able to just play a game with her of touching and\nsoon we became friends and I was able to touch her. And that gave me a lot of\nsatisfaction, because I was the only one. In that convent we also uh had food. It's true we\nhad chestnuts for breakfast, for lunch and dinner, but 1t was food. But to this day I don't\nlike chestnuts. On Sundays we used to get chocolate milk, but it isn't chocolate milk like\nwe have here. It was like a very...almost like a between a pudding and between a\nchocolate milk. It was very thick, but I loved it. It was delicious. And uh we had bread.\nWe had soups. We even had some meat once in a blue moon, and...but we were not\nstarving anymore and we slept between two sheets, which was luxury. We used to uh do\nwork for the village. I learned how to sew, how to do embroidery. I learned how to knit.\nWe also were farmed out to farmers and I learned how to cut grapes and also uh to pull\nweeds and to pull bugs off potato leaves because they didn't have insecticides in those\ndays, so this was done by hand. And we used to do things like that.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: OK. It was (cough), it was very nice. I happened to like it. Uh the sisters had a lot of faith\nand when bombings were going on, for instance, instead of going down to the basement,\nthey would have us go out in the in the yard and uh we would hold hands and uh we\nwould just form a circle and dance around and the only protection that we would have\nwould be a piece of wood that we we would put between our teeth and the bombs would\nfall and there we were, just dancing around. It's true though that they had a big sign on\nthe roof, and I forgot what it was...saying that they couldn't bomb the convent because it\nwas a convent. There was some kind of a sign saying you cannot bomb here but you\nknow, whether that would hold true that they would honor that or not who knows, but\nthat's what 1t was and nothing ever did happen.\nPAUSE",
        "A: OK. In the convent, when uh the air raids would start, we didn't go down in the basement.\nWhat we used to do, we used to out into the court...1nto the courtyard, and there we\nwould hold hands and dance around the circle. And the only protection that we used to\nhave was a piece of wood that we would take between our teeth so we would not bite our\ntongue, and it's true that there was a sign on the roof of the convent letting the planes\nknow that they should not bomb the convent, but whether they would actually uh do this\nor or not, we really weren't that sure, so we were scared. But the sisters, they had a lot of\nfaith and that's the way we did it, and I'm here to tell the story. Uh the other thing that I\nremember is that one day we were walking...we always used to walk to church two by\ntwo, and we were in uniforms. I used to stand out because I had blond hair. The children,\nmost of the children who were French, have dark hair. Dark hair, usually a darker skin,\nbut my hair no one had cut for quite some time so it was very long, very blond. I looked\nvery very German. While Milleau was occupied and there were Nazis walking all over\nthe place and as we walked towards the church, suddenly a Nazi comes up to me, started\nstroking my face, started stroking my hair, and I was petrified. I could not look at him. I\nwas trembling. And it was just fortunate that the sister who had been walking in front of\nthe line just happens to turn around and saw what was going on. She came towards him\nand started talking to him and he let me alone. And thank God I had the presence of mind\nnot to open up my mouth. It was a frightening experience. Uh the other thing that I\nremember is that, like I say, I liked the story of Jesus. I was really taken up by it and I\nwant to convert. And I told the sisters, I said to that one sister, I said, . 1 still\nremember her name... , | would like to become Catholic. And she would shake\nher head and she says, I don't know. I don't know. I don't think your fath...your father and\nmother would like that, and I would say, it would be so much easier. And it's true. I was\nthinking it would be so much easier to be a Christian than to be Jewish but somehow I\nnever did do it. But they are children, and many of them who did convert and who after\nleaving the convent did become Christians or were adopted by Christian families. We lost\nan awful lot of kids that way. But my sister and I, we stayed Jewish. Also we were in two\ndifferent convents. My sister, she had...by then she still was sickly and she also was\nstarting to come down with TB. So in those years whenever you had something like that,\nthey said you should go out in the country, so they sent my sister...at first they just\nwanted to send my sister out to the country to another convent, and I argued with them\nand I said to them, if you send my sister, I go. And I was very stubborn and so they had\nus both go and we went to Balmal (ph), to another convent and there it was, it was a\nfarming convent and we used to help take care of some of the livestock. Well one day the\nsister told me take care of this cow, to take her to a certain pasture. Well, I've never been\ngood at directions and I took her to the wrong pasture because when I came back with\nher, the poor cow was all bloated and the sister was furious with me. She says from now\non I cannot trust you with the cows, so you're going to have to feed the pigs. I know you\ncan't do anything wrong feeding the pigs, so here I was, a nice little Jewish girl who\ndoesn't eat any pork, feeding the pigs. Uh we learned how to church butter and we ate\nbutter for the first time in years, and oh did it taste good but the only trouble is we had a\nlittle bit of butter. We didn't have enough bread. At least it wasn't enough bread for me,\nand I was always hungry for bread, butter and jelly. I used to dream about food. We\nstayed in that convent until the war was almost over with and then this organization took\nus back and we went back to one of the homes. And there we stayed until it was over.",
        "A: Uh not really. We didn't talk about things like that that much. It was...our talk was more\nabout the everyday things, you know...what we were going to...eating was of the utmost\nimportance. We always talked about food. Uh we used to do a lot...I remember I used to\ndo a lot of running. Again the older children took care of younger children. I seemed to\nhave a certain aptitude to take care of like uh...I remember I took care of a boy who was a\nuh hemo...hemophilia I think...where they bleed. I had to be very careful with him. Uh II\nhad to make sure that he would not run, that he wouldn't cut himself and I used to take\nhim for walks. We used to sit under the tree for hours at a time, and uh he was my\nresponsibility at times I remember. Uh and then I used to take care of other children. And\nuh we were, we were busy walking, exercising, uh like I say learning about what we\ncould eat, what we couldn't eat, and also sitting down and learning French. We used to\nplay games. Uh we had uh we used to dance like I learned to dance the __ there because\nwe were all Jewish...butt different...there were children from Poland. There were children\nfrom Hungary, from all different nationalities, uh not only German. And I learned how to\nspeak a little Yiddish, so it was...uh I don't know. We didn't even...I don't think we even\ndid that much. For the most...we were weak. We didn't weigh very much, and we\nconcentrated more or less on our health and what we had to eat. Uh oh we washed\nclothes. I was always very particular as to how I look, and I...this story I got from my\nsister. She used to say whenever there...because in many of those chateaus they were old.\nThere was no running water for instance, so we had to take a bath in a lake but winter\ntime comes. It was too cold and most of the children wouldn't do it, but here I was, taking\nmy bath in the lake, no matter how cold it was. Or I would wash clothes out which a lot\nof the other children wouldn't do, and uh as a matter of fact I...there was a doctor. I\nremember him because he used to come to the home on horseback and uh he used to be\nquite fond of me and uh he used to call me Mignon (ph) which means sweet in French\nand uh he had another name for me which I...which escapes me now, and uh he was very\nnice. He was very special. The other thing that I had was a paren (ph), a god mother. And\nusually I don't tell this story but I think here it's OK to...you know, I should tell it. Uh she\nwould send me money every month and there I had this money. As a matter of fact it's in\nmy documents, her name is, and uh she would send me money and I had all this money\nand I didn't really know what to do with all that money but I just saved it and once in a\nwhile some...we would get, we would be able to go into town and so I would buy a\nfountain pen with it. I bought some uh uh shoe polish with it once, and uh I quarreled\nwith my sister because she used too much shoe polish, as a matter of fact. I said to her, do\nyou think that I can spend all this money on shoe polish and you use it all. She\nremembers that too. She remembers all the terrible things I did to her, and one day we\nhad gone into Paris and I bought all the children ice cream and I felt likeabig\nbecause I had all that money, and why I had that power I don't know to this day. But she\nwanted to adopt me. Later on I found out, but she wouldn't take my sister and I wouldn't\ngo without my sister and that was after the war. As a matter of fact when the war was\nover with this organization having all of us on their hands, one of the things they did was\nadvertise in the , which is a German-Jewish newspaper and it circulates in Israel,\nPalestine in those days, and in New York and England and my grandmother was the first\none to read the advertisement that the org...that they had put in that paper saying that they\nBeata and Suzie Stern were looking for any living relatives and it was from my\ngrandmother that we heard first. She sent us a letter.",
        "A: From Israel, Palestine. And I was over-joyed. I thought oh, my grandmother is alive.\nBecause by then I was constantly worried...would anybody be alive and what would\nbecome of us. I mean can you imagine. Here we were. Two little girls and realizing that\ntheir...the letters from our parents had stopped after a while we were in those homes. So I\nknew something happened to them. Also by then there were a lot of rumors going around.\nI mean I don't know whether...I don't know whether we knew about Auschwitz and all\nthose terrible camps or not. I really don't remember. I just remember something terrible\nwas happening to people, but it was not a descriptive type of a information that I received\nor or knew. I just knew something terrible happened. As a matter of fact, after I didn't\nhear from my parents, I became uh very scared and I wouldn't talk for a while. They had\na hard time getting me to talk again because I was so afraid. Uh and I used to constantly\nworry...think what will become of us? What's going to happen to Suzie and I? So when I\nheard from my grandmother it was just really something to me, and then my uncle also\nwrote, and soon we heard from my aunts in New York City and my uncle and aunt in\nLondon. Well, everybody wanted us. They all said, come to us. We'll see that you get out\nand we'll take care of you. So we had a choice but this paren, she also wanted me and she\neven said what a wonderful life you will have with me. I, I had...I always wrote her thank\nyou and she communicated with me too whether I don't...I haven't found any of her letters\namongst the letters that I have but there was some kind of communication and it must\nhave been by word mou...mou...mouth and word. And I just know she also wanted to\nadopt me. But I said no, because she wouldn't take my sister. I want to go to Palestine\nbecause I remembered my grandmother, but my sister said no. Let's go to London,\nbecause that's the shortest route. Now we have been traveling all this time, constantly,\nand my sister probably was even more tired than I was. And so she thought, well, it's the\nshortest route. Let's go to England, London. So I said OK. So one day they took us to\nParis to process all the papers I imagine and this...there was a lady in who was a\nfriend to one of my aunts and she knew that my mother was in the concentration camp, so\nmy aunt had told her about us and that we might see her and to watch out for us and low\nand behold, we met up with her and to this day I call her Tanta Santa (ph). And she came\nwith us to Paris and on the train, I remember I had all this money and I thought to myself,\nI don't need this money anymore. I should give it away. And I said to Santa, I said to her,\nyou know, I'd like to give this money to a library. Why to a library? Why I want to give\nthe money away? I don't know. But I said to her, I don't need this money. Take this\nmoney and give it to a library. So I gave her the money. Now it's interesting...at that time\nI really didn't know it was to her that I gave the money. I found that out years and years\nlater when I discussed this part of my life with her, and she said to me, Beata (ph), you\ngave me that money. It was me you gave it to. And I saw to it that that money went to a\nJewish library. And like I say, what prompted me to do this I don't know. Then uh also\nthe other thing we did while we were in Paris was Tanta Santa and I, she had lost her\nhusband. She didn't know where her husband was. I didn't know whether...where my\nparents were. I didn't know there was a cousin who I was very fond of...his name was\nRobert...and his mother who was, had been in the concentration camp with my mother,\nAunt Clara...I want to find out where all these people had gone to, where they were,\nwhether they were still alive, and they had lists in certain places...they must have been\npublic places, so we went in Paris to all these different places and we would look at these\nlists, looking for my parents and other relatives and she looking for her moth...for her\nhusband. We would go from one place to the other and it was terrible for us because we\nwould never see the names, so we knew, you know, they were gone. And we did that...we\nwere...I, I had forgotten...we were a few days there, and we never did find any of the\nnames, but we always, every morning I remember we used to have hope and we would go\nout and she would take me around. Every evening we would come home dead tired and\nwe felt so bad, so desolate and so sad. Then after a few days it was time to board the ship,\nSO we went and it was one of the first ships to leave Calais...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, she did. She made all the arrangements. I...that was out of my hands because I\ndidn't know Paris. I was just...I was by then twelve years old, so I didn't know that much\nbut I knew...she wanted...I wanted to go with her because I must have been...I was very\nclose to her and when, probably when she said she was looking for her husband, I must\nhave said well I'd like to look for my parents and for my Aunt Clara and so I used to go\nwith her and she remembers me doing this. And uh that's how, but then she stayed in\nParis. She didn't come on ship and then we were about uh I think we were about fifteen,\nsixteen children who boarded that ship and we went to England. It was one of the first\nships to leave Calais and suddenly there were rumors on board that the waters were\nmined, and we thought, oh my God. We've come this far to be blown up. And uh we got\nscared but after a while we noticed there was uh mine sweepers going ahead of us and\neverything was alright, or not quite alright because there was a storm and it was such a\nrough voyage...most of us kids were throwing up all over and we were so sick and so\nmiserable. Lucky for us there were some Waves aboard and that was my first experience\nmeeting Americans. And they were wonderful. Absolutely wonderful to us. They took\ncare of us. Washed our faces. Cleaned our clothes off and made it bearable. Well we\narrived in England and then we took the train to London and there was my uncle who had\ncome to meet us, and uh I was over-joyed at seeing them. Being with a family again.\nLiving in a regular house. It it was wonderful. My aunt spoke French, which was good. I\nby then had a hatred for Germany. I hated the idea that I was born in such a country. I\nwas ashamed. I was ashamed of being German. I was almost ashamed of myself. Where\nall these feelings came from I don't know exactly but I was... was ashamed. I didn't want\nto speak German, so my aunt spoke French with us and uh they were good to us, but\ntimes were difficult. They lived in a house where the windows were all broken, because\nof the bombings there and there was cardboard on the windows. Uh food was rationed. I\nremember my aunt tried so hard to uh get sugar so she could bake some cakes, or even\njust bake. Uh we had to start going to school there. My aunt thought it would be good if\nwe started school, but at first she uh used to tutor so we would learn English, and he was\nwonderful. We came out of the camps and and at that time, through those homes, in fairly\ngood condition except we had calluses on our feet. We didn't have shoes and we used to\ngo bare-footed so much of the time, so the calluses were about an inch thick and it was\nvery painful after a while, these calluses, and we had to go to a foot doctor and slowly get\nall that layer of callus taken off. Uh the doctor was so nice. Uh my aunt still talks about\nhim to this day because he would not accept a penny for any of it when he heard our story\nbecause he had never seen feet that callused. Oh, I forgot to tell you too and the only\nother shoe that I remember wearing was in the convent they gave us some which\nare wooden shoes. But they are also very hard because we didn't have the nice little\nslippers to fit into the \u2014_ so we used to just wear the wooden show and most of the\ntime I didn't like them. They didn't feel very comfortable and so I used to kick them off\nand just walk bare-footed. But we suffered, I suffered very badly from uh those calluses.\nUh we were malnourished to some extent but my aunt managed to get us as much food as\npossible and we were under the doctor's care, the foot doctor care and this and that. Uh I\nstarted to school. It was a Jewish school. My aunt and uncle were orthodox. We lived in\nStanford Hill, London, and there were a lot of Hasidim (ph) and it was a lovely area. I\nabsolutely loved it and it was good living uh there. I felt I was again with my family, so\nuh I started this uh Victor (ph) High School, but it was hard for me. I could not sit still. I\ndidn't have any patience. I always wanted to be on the go. And it was too hard for me\nbecause not only was I learning English, they were teaching us a awful lot of Hebrew, the\n. We studied __. It was all too much. I was just overcome because I had never\nhad any really formal Hebrew uh lessons before, and finally I told my aunt I don't want to\ngo back to school. I just don't want to go. At first she more or less told me yes I had to\ngo, so I got in to trouble at school and the teachers must have contacted her and that was\nthe end of my schooling. And so she had me take uh sewing lessons because I was\nquite...I was good at sewing and my uncle had a...he manufactured handbags in the\nhouse, so I learned how to use the sewing machines and I would help him with that, but\nagain it was sitting and I just could not sit. So he says OK, if you can't sit how about\ngoing to uh to some of the people I do business with and I'll give you samples of my\nhandbag and you show it to them and see whether they want to buy any. So I went to\nthese different uh places and uh showed the samples and I would take the orders, bring\nthem back to my uncle. He would box them up in big boxes and I still remember shipping\n(ph) them on the bus and the subway and taking them to the various businesses and so\nthat was my job. My other job was taking care of my little cousin and I made myself\nquite useful and I alwa...my aunt always gave me money. She says since you work for\nme, here's money. So I had money again, and I always used to go to the movies with my\nfriends and I had a very good social good life. Uh we stayed in England until 1947. Then\nmy...I had two aunts in New York and an uncle and they decided it would be best for us\nto come to New York City. And also one of the reasons was that my father had written\nthem a letter saying that if anything should happen to him or his wife, that we are to go to\nthem, because they were the sisters of my mother. So they took this letter and they said\nthis is your father's wish so this is what you should do. Well, they had trouble with me\nagain. I didn't want to leave England. I loved it there. I liked the religious life. Uh I liked\nliving among the Hasidim (ph) because they were so joyful. I loved going to the... had a\ngirlfriend. She was Hasidish and I would enjoy going to services with her and I\nenjoyed...I remember attending the weddings and it seems almost every week somebody\nwas getting married. Anyhow this was our social outlet and I just loved it, and my aunts\nhad a hard time convincing me to come to New York. But uh then at the end of uh\nOctober in '47, by plane, we came to uh New York City and I don't know how much\nmore of my story you want or not.",
        "A: I went to high school in New York. Now on one year of schooling in Germany, the little\nbit I had in England, somehow I managed to get into high school. I had to take a test, but\nI passed it. But I remember the principal when I told him how little schooling I had, he\nwas very doubtful that I could even pass the test, and uh he says it really would be better\nif you would start elementary school. And he probably was right, but I didn't want to\nbecause I wanted to be with my own peers. And so I started high school and I graduated\nbut my goal in life was to have a home, a husband and children. So two weeks after\ngraduating high school, I got married and uh soon after I started my family and I have\nfour daughters and three of them are married and I have five grandchildren.",
        "A: On me? I think that I have learned to cope better with life. Uh it has shown me though\nwhat man can do to man and how inhumane they can be. I am because of it not that\ntrustful of people in general but I am thankful that I am here. I know a lot of survivors\nfeel guilty that they are here, but I don't have that guilt. Uh I'm more thankful and also\nbecause I feel that I have survived that uh my speaking out on what happened in those\ndays is more or less uh saying well, you know, something terrible has happened to our\npeople, but I'm going to tell everybody that I can about it, and make sure that something\nlike that will never happen again.",
