        "Anthony: lam Anthony Di lorio and | am at the home of Mrs. Lily Margules in the Bronx, New\nYork. |am here on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to\ninterview Mrs. Margules about her family's experiences during the Holocaust. Good\nmorning.",
        "Lily: Good morning.",
        "Anthony: Perhaps we can begin by, since we have already interviewed you before--we know a\nlot about you, when you were born--perhaps you can describe what it was like growing\nup in your parents' home during the 1930's.",
        "Lily: My parents were a young professional couple and as a child, | and my sister had a very\ncomfortable life. We had a nanny who took care of us because my mother was a\ndentist and she was working. It was really a very pastoral, pleasant life. We were good\ntaken care of; we were sent to a private school, we took ballet and music, piano\nlessons. My parents wanted to inject into us as much culture as possible so we used to\ngo to children's plays in the theater and to the operas. Summertime we used to go to\nhave very nice vacations where we were swimming in the River Vilija. We had little\nfriends; we had--. Most of the people, the little girls and boys we associated, were in\nthe same class so it was a very sheltered childhood. We actually were quite happy\nwith our life.",
        "Anthony: Now, you had a sister?",
        "Lily: Yes, | had a younger sister.",
        "Anthony: What was her name?",
        "Lily: Her name was Raya. Hebrew name, Rachel. She is four years younger than |. As two\nlittle girls, sometimes we used to fight but she was a very pretty, vivacious girl. We got\nalong quite well except that she was more spoiled than I. Like from the beginning, |\nwas told that | have to be a professional. It was not--my parents didn't ask. It was\ndecided that | have to go to medical school to be a doctor. For her, was decided that\nshe has to marry somebody well-off, a good provider, a handsome husband, children\nand she just had to be like a lady of the house, a hostess. Just looking pretty and\nbehaving.",
        "Anthony: Is that something she wanted to be?",
        "Lily: Well, she accepted this role from the beginning. She never was trying to have good\ngrades. She was just passing and she liked the ballet, she liked to play the piano. Also\nshe had her little friends and really she was like mentally prepared to a very pleasant\nlife, being very spoiled by both parents and the nanny.",
        "Anthony: What about you? Did you really want to be a doctor?",
        "Lily: It was not a question that | want to be a doctor. It was just put before me that fait\naccompli and | just had to be and--. Also, | liked to study. As strange as it sounds\ntoday, | really--l was very interested in reading. When | was six years old, | was\nintroduced to books and | was a voracious reader. | was very interested in a lot of\nthings. Also in school | was a very good student and it used to come very easy to me. |\ndidn't have to study a lot. When | had to write an essay | could write it in two minutes.\n| used to write a few essays for my little friends that had difficulties. | was not crazy\nabout math but somehow | managed and | used to be a teacher's pet.",
        "Anthony: | noticed your report card and it was quite good.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Anthony: Now your little sister went to the same school?",
        "Lily: Yes. We went to a private school.",
        "Anthony: Was this a Jewish school?",
        "Lily: This was a private Jewish school that only Jewish children went to there. We were off\non Saturdays and Sunday was a school day but all the instructions were in Polish. We\nalso had two times a week Hebrew but everything was taught in Polish.",
        "Anthony: What was the language in your household?",
        "Lily: When | was a little girl, my parents spoke Russian because when they went to the\nuniversity and before | was born, Vilna was occupied by Russia and the young people,\nat this time, spoke Russian. Then when | started to get older, my father one time came\nfrom work and said we have to speak Polish. The child will have to go to a Polish\nschool and she is still talking Russian. Then they were starting to speak Polish but\nwhen their friends came and when they are talking between themselves, Russian was\nthe language that they spoke.",
        "Anthony: Did they speak any other languages between Russian and Polish?",
        "Lily: There was a Jewish paper that used to come. My mother didn't read Jewish but my\nfather read the Jewish paper. | imagine that my mother spoke Jewish. But when she\nspoke with her friends or her family, it was mostly in Russian. Do you know the Jewish\npopulation had three layers of society? There were these people that were assimilated\nJews and they mainly spoke Russian and Polish. There were the people that were\nyoung Zionists and they sent their children to Hebrew School and they were trying to\nmake Hebrew a living language. The third layer of the Jewish society was people that\nbelieve that Yiddish is the language of the Jewish people. There were very famous\n\u201cRagymnasium\u201d [?] (88)that were taught only in Jewish and the children were sent to\nthis school. They were taught Yiddish and they were speaking between themselves\nalso in Yiddish. There were like three layers of Jewish society. Unfortunately, my\nparents were very assimilated and they, because of their professional background, felt\nthat the Russian revolution and the Russian language is kind of salvation for all people.\nThey believed in all the ideals that sounded very nice on paper but unfortunately fell\napart later.",
        "Anthony: So you would describe your parents as being Socialists at that time?",
        "Lily: No, they were not Socialist, | mean maybe as young students. As young students they\nbelieved in all the revolutionary ideals. | remember that my father used to just ask me\nfrom time to time to sing the International. | had a good voice and even when the\nRussian came, his biggest pleasure was just when | was singing the International for\nhim. He believed in those ideas, equality, was very idealistic about it.",
        "Anthony: Definitely not a Stalinist but--.",
        "Lily: No, no, no. Was very idealistic because at this time, when he was a student, all those\nideas of Lenin and Trotsky were very much in the mind of the young students who\nbelieved very deeply that the oppressed people have to unite and everybody has the\nsame right. Religion shouldn't imprison people. So they were very idealistic and very\nmuch for equal rights for everybody.",
        "Anthony: Would you describe your parents as being secular, more secular than religious?",
        "Lily: Very secular, very secular. As a matter of fact, | didn't know that | was Jewish until |\nwent to school. It was a very hard experience for me because a lot of people that |\nwent to school, the children, were from religious families. When | went to school the\nfirst day, my nanny prepared me my lunch. It was a Kaiser roll with butter and ham. |",
        "had no idea that there's something wrong. When | opened the lunch and there are\nchildren, who can be very cruel, saw my lunch; they said, you are not Jewish. | said,\nyes |am Jewish. | mean it was like a revelation for me that it came out that | was\nJewish. | started to cry. | didn't want to eat. They said to me, do you know that Jewish\nchildren are not allowed to eat ham and do you know that Jewish children are not\nallowed to rip paper or grab something on a Saturday. When my nanny came to pick\nme up, | was in tears. When! came, she called my mother. We sat down and | told her\nthe whole story. She told me I'm Jewish, we are not religious, but we are Jews and you\nare going to Jewish school with Jewish children. | had a very good friend of mine and\nevery Friday night, they used to light candles. When | went there and | saw that they\nare lighting candles, | was very impressed with the whole dinner and everything that\nwas--. | came home and | said to my mother, | was told that God will punish us, we\ndon't light candles. | was so distressed that-my mother went out and bought two\ncandlesticks and she started to light candles on Friday just to pacify me. Because it\nwas a revelation for me. | started to ask her because | never knew my grandparents.\nThen she told me that her father who passed away at a young age, was a religious Jew,\nwas not fanatic with a big white beard. Then | kind of was researching my background\nand | was very impressed and this is how | come to know my heritage.",
        "Anthony: Did you speak any other languages besides Polish?",
        "Lily: Yes, | soeak Russian. | speak Spanish, Castellan Spanish. | soeak Yiddish. | used to\nspeak and write a very good German. Even | used to write the Gothic German but |\nhave a mental block now and | just--| get very upset even when | hear the language\neven spoken so | don't count German.",
        "Anthony: When you were young, growing up in Vilna, could you speak Yiddish?",
        "Lily: No, no. | learned to speak Yiddish when | was brought into ghetto. Because when |\nwas brought into ghetto, | met there people that if | would live in Vilna a hundred\nyears, | would never meet those kind of people. | grew up in a very sheltered and\nrestricted little society. My peers spoke Polish, only Polish. But when | came to the\nghetto, | met all kinds of people; | started to mingle and | learned Yiddish. | know the\nalphabet because | was taught Hebrew as a child when | went to school, but | never\nlearned to read Yiddish. | also, there was a time that | know quite well, White Russian,\nbut not anymore.",
        "Anthony: Earlier you divided the Jewish population of Vilna into three groups?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Anthony: Which would you say was the most numerous of the three?",
        "Lily: It's very hard for me to say. | would say the most numerous were the Yiddish-\nspeaking people. This was the most numerous. This was actually the working-class\nlanguage. There were a lot of very, very poor people, Jewish people, in Vilna that lived\nin basements and had a very hard life. They were speaking Yiddish. Those people who",
        "were assimilated and those people that sooke Hebrew were more elitist and they were\nfewer.",
        "Anthony: Minority?",
        "Lily: Minority, yes.",
        "Anthony: Your nanny, you mentioned your nanny. Your nanny was not Jewish?",
        "Lily: No, she was a Polish girl that was a--. The day that my mother brought me from the\nhospital, she was there already. She was brought over because my mother was a\nworking dentist, yes, she was a working woman. She was a young girl at this time and\nmy mother kind of--. My mother was a very good heart person. She kind of taught her\nmanners and she kind of took her into the family. She was never outside. She was\nalways a member and she was very, very fond of my mother. After she became a\nmember of the family, she kind of took over. | tell you a little instance. Every morning,\nshe used to dress me up, very, very nice, even with gloves. We used to go to a park.\nThe park was called Katajenka. Over there the other nannies were bringing their little\nchildren from parents that were in the same class and all the nannies used to brag\nabout, oh my lady did this and my lady, they went to this theater and they had this and\nall--it was like kind of a competition between how the children were dressed. When\nmy nanny decided that | needed a new dress; she didn't go to my mother or my father\nto ask. She went to a store where we had a credit, she chose the material. She went\nto a dressmaker, she chose the style. The dressmaker knew, already, that she is\nreliable. After she did it, she also went and bought me a new pair of shoes, a new pair\nof gloves; she came and she said to my mother, you know, | did today, this and this and\nthis. My mother would never say no to her but when my father got the bills and he\nused to question her, she used to say, what do you want me to go with your little girl--\nlike a pauper to the park? My father would never, never speak against her. She was\njust like the boss. She knew that she has to take care of her little girls later on--in the\nbeginning, just me. She knew that she had to take care of my mother and she was a\npart of the family.",
        "Anthony: What kind of house did you live in?",
        "Lily: | lived in an apartment house. | was born in an apartment house on Ludwisarska Four.\nMy mother's office was right there. She had an office and she had a waiting room.\nThen there were quarters, living quarters. But when my sister was born, the\napartment became too small. We moved to Pilsaskero, where we lived until 1939.",
        "Anthony: That was also an apartment?",
        "Lily: This was an apartment. We lived on the second floor. It was a very nice apartment\nwith a balcony. They were very nice quarters. My mother also had an office and there\nwas a waiting room. Also there was a room for my nanny. It had two entrances. One\nwas the entrance that you went into the kitchen and one was a front entrance that the\npatient used to come. It was beautiful furnished. When | was trying to furnish my\nhouse--when | married and | settled down--l always was trying to imitate whatever |",
        "saw. Like we had a grandfather clock and | had a grandfather clock. We had a piano\nand | didn't have furniture yet but | bought a piano, the first thing we bought a piano. |\nalways--even the coloring--if you look at my apartment, this is the coloring that | was\ntrying to imitate",
        "Anthony: Very interesting. So that was the yardstick by which you measured good taste?",
        "Lily: Good taste, yes. My mother had a very good taste. | never saw my mother without a\nhat and a pair of gloves. She was a very good looking woman, a beautiful woman and\non Fridays was her day off. Before | started school, when | was a little girl, my biggest\npleasure was Fridays. Because in the morning, she used to dress up and we used to go\nand do errands, whatever she had to do on her day off. Strange men on the street\nused to tip their hat to my mother. | was very proud that this is my mother. It was a\nreal--like | was admiring her, not only because she was very good but because she was\nvery attractive. When | remember my mother, | always see her in the white doctor\ncoat, this is how | remember her or when she was walking on the street dressed up\nwith the hat and the gloves and men just tipping their hat to her.",
        "Anthony: Your parents wanted you to be like her?",
        "Lily: | don't know if they wanted me to be like her but it was taken for granted that | have\nto be in the medical profession. | mean it was no question asked; it was just, this is\nhow | was groomed to be.",
        "Anthony: Did you live in a mainly Jewish neighborhood or was it a mixed neighborhood?",
        "Lily: It was a mixed neighborhood. We lived nearby from the medical faculty of the\nuniversity. | remember the riots, it started at the synagogue riots and it was very hard\nfor the Jew to go to a medical university, a medical college. In Poland, it was different.\nWhen you finished high school, you didn't go to college. You go right away to\nuniversity and you had to make up your mind what you wanted to study. Now here,\nhere you go to college and then you go to medical school or to law school. Over there,\nit was different. It was very hard for a Jew to go in and study medicine. From the\nwhole school that | went to, it was a private school, just one person was accepted per\nyear for a period of two or three years. So those few medical students that were in the\nuniversity studying medicine, Jewish, were really persecuted. There was a time that\nthey were not allowed to sit. They were assigned special seats on the left. They\nrebelled and they were standing up and they were taking notes during the lecture. |\nmet some people after liberation that were medical students in Vilna and they were\ntelling me about those times. I, myself, remember that there were riots and my\nmother came running to school to pick me up because she was afraid that | should be\nassaulted by those people that were just rioting nearby where we were living.",
        "Anthony: Do you know why your parents sent you to a private Jewish school?",
        "Lily: My parents wanted me to have the best education and this was a very fine school, one\nof the best. | wish | could give my children the kind of education that | and my sister\nhad as children. The professors were very educated; they were highly dedicated.",
        "Most of the students were motivated. There were some children that went there just\nto please their parents and tried to get away but we had movies, we had a chemical\nlaboratory, we had a physics laboratory; we had field trips; we had a gym, gym was\nimportant; we had all kinds of visual aids to make the education more interesting. Also\nwhen we had French Revolution, they were teaching us about French Revolution. It\nwas not that they told us about Robespierre and Marat, but we had a mock judgment.\nThere was a judge assigned; there was somebody who was Marat, who was\nRobespierre and somebody that was just from the people. The history, all of a sudden,\nbecame alive. | just recently met a friend of mine that | didn't see for many, many\nyears and we started to talk. He said he was amazed how alive the French Revolution\nbecame when we were students. Every class had a school paper. We had to write\narticles; the class paper was coming out every month. The best article from the class\npaper was put in the school paper. Those articles were amazing. This is--the\natmosphere was very conductive to bring up an intelligent human being. This is the\nreason | was sent there.",
        "Anthony: How would you characterize relations between Jews and non-Jews in Vilna?",
        "Lily: There were a lot of anti-Semites. | think that | told in the previous interview that my\nfather was really having a very hard time when he went for an exam. You see, my\nfather was working in a pharmacy. This was a pharmacy from --a very big pharmacy\nthat was from the city pharmacy. Every worker that worked had a kind of insurance.\nWhen he needed a prescription, he went to this pharmacy. It was a very big outfit; it\nwas called \u201cCasa Horich\u201d [phonetic] (324). It was like a big insurance for the workers.\nFrom this pharmacy was employed a lot of pharmacists, only three Jewish pharmacists\nwere employed. In 1935, those three pharmacists were told that they don't have\nenough education; they have to go and pass a test. They cannot do just a simple\npharmacist; they have to have Masters in pharmacy. It was called Magister der\nPharmazie. Here was my father, a young man, with a wife and two children, and he\nhad to go to work and also study. | remember that he used to go and dig up all kinds\nof herbs and study all kinds of things. He used to close himself and study whatever, he\njust had a chance. Then he went for the test. The test was in the medical faculty of\nthe university. Unfortunately there was a professor there and his name was Macheski,\none of the biggest anti-Semites. He passed the written test and then he passed the\noral test. As he was coming out, he asked him, by the way, what is the chemical\nformula for carbonated water? My father was so unnerved that he got a mental block\nand he didn't answer him. He didn't pass the test. So he had to study again and he\nhad to travel to Warsaw. He went there and he passed the test there. | remember\nwhen he sent us a telegram, \"Il passed!\" and it was one of the biggest joys for us. But it\ndidn't take long and all three Jewish pharmacists were told that they had to go. They\ndidn't want a Jew to have a civil service job.",
        "Anthony: So even though he got the Masters and he qualified, he still lost?",
        "Lily: Yes, he lost. Then we had like a family pow-wow. He lost the job. We didn't know\nwhat to do. So it was decided that everybody will help him and he will have to buy a\npharmacy because he couldn't get a job. When he went to buy a pharmacy, he found\na pharmacy in a place called Softy [Salos], S-o-l-y. As a Jew, he couldn\u2019t buy the",
        "pharmacy so somehow he found a Polish pharmacist whose name was Vishnefski. He\ngave him a sum of money, this Vishnefski bought the pharmacy and my father was the\nowner and he worked there. This Vishnefski was not even there. This was in 1938.",
        "Anthony: That's when he lost the shop?",
        "Lily: He lost his job in 1936 or 1937. For a year or a year and a half, he didn't work. There\nwere a lot of anti-Semites.",
        "Anthony: Did you notice whether there was any difference between Poles and Lithuanians, for\nexample?",
        "Lily: Well, actually, | didn't get in touch during my childhood too much with Lithuanians. |\nstarted to know Lithuanians when, in 1940, Russia took over and it then became\nLithuania. So for a year, you know, but... also | got in touch with Lithuanians when they\nwere guarding the ghetto. They were very tall, the: policemen. We used to call them\n\u201caniterate\u201d [?] (391), this how tall they were. Lithuanians were also very anti-Semitic,\nvery anti-Semitic, especially those who were sympathizers with the Germans.",
        "Anthony: If you had to compare the two, would you say that one was worse than the other?\nLithuanian anti-Semitism or Polish?",
        "Lily: | would say they were just--both of them were bad. It is hard to compare.",
        "Anthony: Earlier, you mentioned that there were some anti-Semitic pogroms?",
        "Lily: They were actually not pogroms. They were riots between the students, between the\nPolish students and the Jewish students and the university.",
        "Anthony: But you were protected from all that because you were still going to the Jewish\nschool?",
        "Lily: | was protected because, first of all | was a little girl and | was going to a Jewish school.",
        "Anthony: How about your mother? Who were her clients?",
        "Lily: My mother had a lot of non-Jewish clients. | remember that well-to-do Polish\nlandowners used to come to her and they used to come with a horse and buggy. They\nused to come like the driver used to sit in the front of the house and wait for them.\nThey were very tall, young men, middle-aged men. A lot of them used to come with\nboots and they used to bend down and kiss my mother's hand. Especially in the\nspringtime, they used to bring her like strawberries or fresh things. My mother was a\nvery good dentist and she had a very good reputation that she had a very light hand,\nthey used to say, for extraction of the teeth. She used to make very nice false teeth.\nShe had a dental mechanic that was working with her. Those people used to come for\nmiles to her because they used to like her work. Of course, | mentioned that they\ntrusted her if they came to her. They used to sometimes bring their wives, children to\nattend her. But there was one day that my mother used to do a lot of pro bono work.",
        "Any poor Jewish or non-Jewish people knew that if they have a toothache, they can\nring the bell and they can come in. She would just help them and cure them and do\nwhatever; she would treat them like the most expensive patients and she wouldn't\ncharge them. She just had this obligation to do good. As a matter of fact, when | was\nin concentration camps, | met a few people that said to me, you know, | know you. |\nused to see you in your mother's office. Sometimes | would sneak in. | used to\npretend that |am a helper. | would just stay in the corner and look. Apparently they\nsaw me. You know that your mother didn't charge me at all. We're poor people and\nshe was just like an angel to us. One of the women worked in the kitchen and she used\nto help me because my mother helped her when she was a little girl and she had a\ntoothache. This is my recollection about the--.",
        "Anthony: A very-loved mother?",
        "Lily: Yes, a very good person.",
        "Anthony: The poorest classes and the richest classes?",
        "Lily: Yes. She always--and | remember her telling me if you see somebody that puts a hand\nout, you have to put something in it. We always had a few boxes in our house. One\nbox was for orphans, one blue box was to buy land for Israel, there was Keren\nKayemet. It was a Hebrew organization and when we used to get allowance, we had\nto put a few pennies into this box. When | got older and | started to think about Israel\nand all the things, | was very much interested in it. | was very pleased that even my\nmother was not a Zionist but she had the sense that you have to help; that you have to\nkind of go out and start to think about your own land if you are to be a whole person.\nSo charity | learned in my house.",
        "Anthony: Charity begins at home?",
        "Lily: Yes, it really began with me at home.",
        "Anthony: Now 1939 was a very bad year for your family?",
        "Lily: A very bad year.",
        "Anthony: Before the war?",
        "Lily: Yes, yes. | never saw my mother sick. Then in 1938, she went to a doctor and she was\ndiagnosed as having cancer. She was operated on in a very good hospital. She was\nopened and closed. The professor that operated on her called my father and said to\nhim; unfortunately your wife has a month or two to live. She has cancer of the ovary\nthat it metastasized. Your two little girls, you have to think about it and you have to\nsay mentally goodbye to her. Of course, it was a very big tragedy because my parents-\n-they met as students and they had a very good relationship. My father put my\nmother on a pedestal and he couldn't believe it because she was never sick. We were\nnot told about it. We were very sheltered. My aunt Sonia kind of took over. My\nmother was brought home; there was a hospital bed there and every day, she was",
        "taken for radiation treatments. Sometimes, | would skip school and | was going with\nher for the radiation treatment. She was taking it very bad. She was very nauseous\nand we used to save a piece of herring for her after the treatment; something to--the\nnausea should go away. | was very, very distressed about it. | don't think my sister\nrealized what was going on but | understood and after a while, a miracle happened.\nShe kind of had a relapse, just happened to feel better. When she was sick, she was\nlying in this big salon, this big waiting area and the dog, Rex, was just lying there. We\nhad to disconnect the bell because people wouldn't let go. The patients just wanted to\ncome and say hello to her and she needed all her privacy and she couldn't continue her\npractice. But as soon as she got better, she recovered, and she started to practice\nagain. She started slowly but all of a sudden, everybody came back. It was very\nanxious for her to resume practice. Maybe for four or five months, everything came to\nnormal and then she had a relapse. After a month, again the hospital bed came and\nMay 24th, she passed away. My aunt Sonia, who was a midwife and a nurse, took care\nof her. She was giving her all medication but there was nothing we could do. |\nremember, you know in Jewish tradition, you sit Shiva and my mother passed away on\na Thursday. It was the first day of a Jewish holiday called Shavuot which is a very\nhappy holiday. Saturday morning, my little friends came to take me out and it was in\nMay. It was a beautiful, beautiful day. In May in Vilna, the lilacs were blooming; the\nsmell in the air was incredible. The birds were singing and the sun was shining and |\nwas walking on the sidewalk with my little friends and | said, my God, the world goes\non and my mother is not there. | also have to mention to you that my mother had a\nvery big funeral. People that knew her; all the patients came, all the students from the\nschool from me and from my sister's and we had a problem with Rex because he\nwanted to go behind. He had just--had to be taken away. | remember when my\nmother passed away it was maybe like four o' clock in the morning, and in my ear is\nthis terrible howling of this dog. This dog was howling, inhuman. When | woke, up and\nmy aunt that was present, started to cry. Then this dog has to be taken out of the\nhouse and then | realize that | lost my mother. It was a very, very hard time for me. |\nwas always a good student but because | was going for the treatments with my\nmother, my grades fell down. The teacher came to pay me a visit and he says to me\nyou should come back to school and improve your grades. What's going on? After all\nyou were always like a very good student. | said to him, I'm sorry | just cannot do it.\nMy world ended and | just cannot do it. He said to me all right, maybe after the\nsummer, he says, we will put you like kind of probation. We won't give you the bad\ngrade because this is not you. After the summer, you will pass the exams, and then we\nwill give you the report card. | says, all right but | just couldn't bring myself back to go\nto school because the school year ended June 20, so | still had plenty of time to go, |\njust couldn't do it. This summer was a very sad summer for me because me and my\nsister and our nanny, we were sent to Soty [Salos] where my father had the pharmacy.\nTape One, Side B",
        "Anthony: So it's the summer of 1939, and you're in Soty [Salos]?",
        "Lily: Yes, I'm in Soty [Salos]. It was a very big adjustment for us because all of a sudden we\nmet different youngsters and different people. We were very heartbroken. We were\nvery grateful that my aunt could stay with us for a month which was kind of our link.",
        "She became our second mother; she took over very swiftly. Then we were preparing\nourselves; in September the school was supposed to resume. | was sitting ina\nhammock; it was September 1, | think, reading a book. All of asudden my nanny came\nrunning and she said your father wants you to come over right away to the pharmacy.\nThis where we found out that the war broke out and the Germans were invading.\nThen the pandemonium broke because all of a sudden Soty [Salos] became White\nRussia and we were isolated from Vilna. My aunt sent somebody to take both of us to\nher; we should go to school there. But my father said no, they have to be with me.\nWe had to stay in White Russia. | was sent to the school in Ashmyana because there\nwas no high school there and my sister was going to a school in Soty [Salos]. This is--.",
        "Anthony: Goodbye Vilna?",
        "Lily: Yes. During the vacation, my father sent us to my aunt because we were missing her a\nlot. We went there and we stayed there during the winter vacation for a week or two.",
        "Anthony: In Vilna?",
        "Lily: In Vilna, yes. But | just didn't find anything because most--it was just not the Vilna that\n| remembered. It became completely different so that when we came back, we were\nstaying till 1941.",
        "Anthony: In Soty [Salos]?",
        "Lily: Yes--no, not in Soty [Salos] because when the Russian came, my father didn't get a\npassport because he was bourgeois. He was the owner of the pharmacy so he was\npersecuted by the Russian also. They took away the pharmacy and they sent us toa\nsmall village called Ostrowiec [Ostroweic Swietokrzyski]. Over there, he became the\nmanager. My sister had to go to a school there and | was still in Ashmyana. In 1941,\nthe war, when the Germans took over, we were in Ostrowiec [Ostroweic\nSwietokrzyski]. From there, me and my sister escaped back to Vilna and then my\nfather came.",
        "Anthony: Now your aunt Sonia, she was your mother's older sister?",
        "Lily: Older sister, yes.",
        "Anthony: Could you tell us a little bit more about her? She was a midwife and a nurse in Vilna?",
        "Lily: Yes. My mother and my aunt Sonia were very close. There was not a day that they\ndidn't see each other. When my Aunt Sonia was a young girl, she was romantically\ninvolved with one of the leaders of the revolution. As a matter of fact, she escaped her\nfather's house and she wanted like a set-up, they believed in free-love, and she wanted\nlike to set up house with this young revolutionary. But my grandfather put his foot\ndown. He came and took her practically by the hand and said that no daughter of\nmine will do this thing. She was a very good-looking woman. For the longest time she\ndidn't have a boyfriend, she was not interested, she was just interested in the\nprofession. She married late in life and her wedding was in our house. She met this",
        "very nice young fellow whose name was Joseph Persky. After the wedding, after the\nhoneymoon, they set up house, not far from us.",
        "Anthony: This was before your mother died?",
        "Lily: This was before my--.",
        "Anthony: During the 1930's?",
        "Lily: Yes, the 1930's. | was very close with her because there was not a day that she didn't\ncome to our house or we didn't go to her. She never had children and she was very,\nvery dedicated to both of us and, of course, to my mother. My mother had also an\nolder sister, her name was Esther. She was married with two children but there was a\nvery big binding with those two sisters. Actually, after my mother passed away, she\ntook her place. When we escaped from Ostrowiec [Ostroweic Swietokrzyski] and me\nand my sister came as the little two peasant girls, we came to her house. We were\nstaying in her house; she was very good to us. We found shelter and comfort in her\nhouse and my father also stayed in her house. With her, we went to the ghetto when\nthe Jews from Vilna were sent to the ghetto. The whole time in ghetto, we were\ntogether, me and my sister and my aunt and my father. My aunt and my sister slept in\none bed and my father slept on the floor. She was working in the Jewish Hospital as a\nnurse. She was very instrumental in saving, actually, my life because | was in the\nhospital. | told about it so | don't want to repeat it. But she took me out from the\nhospital just in time when the Germans were asking for 500 people, Jews, from the\ncommander of the ghetto. He, in order to save able-bodied Jews, said to them, send\nthem sick people from the hospital. She, being a nurse, found out just the night before\nshe took me out. The whole time during the liquidation of the ghetto, we were\ntogether. When we came to the Rosa Cemetery, there was a selection. My sister\nlooked very, very young so my aunt took off a pair of shoes with heels and she gave it\nto my sister. Also she stuffed her bosom with a pair of socks. We were all three going\ntogether. | don't know how it happened but we got separated from my aunt. She was\nsent to the left and both of us were sent to the right. When | realized that she was\nsent to the left, | became hysterical and | was running back to the left. A German SS\nman with a rifle beat me over the head and says to me, you are too young. You have\nto work for the Fatherland. Took me off the floor and there were some other girls just\ntook me away and | never saw my aunt again.",
        "Anthony: Do you remember that date?",
        "Lily: | will never forget it. It was September 23, 1943; it was the day of the liquidation of\nthe ghetto. This was the last time that | saw her.",
        "Anthony: Mr. Persky, her husband, was he separated earlier?",
        "Lily: He was amerchant. He had a business in wild mushrooms and furs. He had a lot of\ncontact with peasant, buying from them, the wild mushrooms. Also, he didn't look\nJewish. He looked very much like a Pole. So before--when they send notices that they\nnext day they send us to the ghetto, he called my aunt and said to her, he's not going",
        "to the ghetto. He's going to the country. He want her to go with him. But she said she\ncannot separate herself from the children and also my father and both of us, me and\nmy sister, we look very Jewish. He could take just one, her, but not us. She said that\nshe is going with us to the ghetto and this was the sacrifice that she made. Because |\nalways think that maybe if she would went with him to the country, he would be alive.\nWhen | survived, | was searching for him. | was asking about him, but | could never\nfind a trace, because he was very good to us.",
        "Anthony: So you don't know whether he survived?",
        "Lily: | don't know, | don't know.",
        "Anthony: When your aunt was young, did she also attend the university?",
        "Lily: Yes, she attended the university, yes.",
        "Anthony: The same one as your mother?",
        "Lily: | don't know because--. | don't know exactly. | know that there was always talk that\nshe was with the students, with her romance, with this revolution. There was always\nlike family secrets and things like this about my stern grandfather who put his foot\ndown but | don't know this | don't know. | imagine because this is what they were sent\nto study so | imagine but | don't know.",
        "Anthony: Now your father, these are bad years for your father, the loss of his job, the loss of his\nwife, then loss of the next job, and being forced to move. Now what happens to him\nduring these months?",
        "Lily: What time of--?",
        "Anthony: He was in Soly [Salos] and then he loses the pharmacy because he's too bourgeois.\nThen he is forced to move to Ostrowiec [Ostroweic Swietokrzyski], where he just was\nan employee--.",
        "Lily: He was a manager.",
        "Anthony: Manager?",
        "Lily: Yes. He was a manager and it was a small pharmacy and he was the only one that\nworked but he didn't own it. Of course it was very hard years for him. He developed a\nlot of friendship with the doctors that used to come, the Russian doctors used to come\nfor the medicine over there. Since he spoke Russian--but when the German came,\nthere was some Russian doctor that wanted to take us deep into Russia. He didn't\nwant to do it because he said that during the war, you have to have a roof above your\nhead so he didn't want to do it. But as soon as the Russian left and the German came,\na lot of pogroms started against the Jews, against the Jews in Ostrowiec [Ostroweic\nSwietokrzyski]. When the Russian were there, the Polish landowners suffered a lot\nbecause they were just the same bourgeois. When they used to come to the",
        "pharmacy, there was a room in the back where my father used to prepare their\nmedicines and they used to congregate there. They used to come--they could freely\ntalk without being observed by the communists. They were kind of friendly so when\nthe pogroms started, one of them came and said that you should take our belongings\nand he will save us and he will take us to this big house that he said belonged (one\nword unclear). So my father and my sister put some belongings on their wagon and he\ntook them going there to this big house. On the way, they were accosted by twenty\nPoles and my father was put against a tree, blindfolded and they wanted to shot him in\nthe presence of my little sister. They just hurt him but we suspected that it was\narranged by the landowner who wanted just to take the belongings that my father was\ntaking and scare him. When my father came home, | was waiting for him. When | saw\nhim bleeding, we understood that they were just false people that want to take\nadvantage and they want to take our furniture, our bedding, whatever we had there.\nMy father went to the rabbi of the house, of the little town and said to him that if we\ncould sleep a few nights there because our life is in danger. The rabbi let us stay over\nthere. About two days later, he sent both of us with a peasant to Vilna and then he\nwaited two days and then--we became--. Those were very hard times for him. First of\nall, he believed in those people that wanted to save us and it was a very big let-down\nthat only for material thing but it was morally, he lost faith. He was like--here he was a\nJew in Poland; then he was persecuted by the Russian as a bourgeois; then with\nsomebody who was supposed to be his friend, whom he did favors, let him also down.\nIt was--. When my father came to Vilna, he was walking, he walked. From all the\naggravation, he developed a very big abscess right here in the back. He went to the\nhospital and when it came the time of liquidation of the Jewish population and\neverybody was sent, we were actually separated. | went to the ghetto with my aunt\nand my sister and my father was already in the ghetto because the Jewish hospital was\nthere. He was desperate because he was operated on and he was lying in bed and he\nthought that he lost his two little girls and his sister-in-law. Somehow, somebody that\nknew us came to visit him in the hospital and told him that we are alive. He was still in\nbad shape when he came out from the hospital and we were in the ghetto together.\nAfter he gota little better, he got a job as a pharmacist in a--it was called the Spanish\nlazareth, the pharmacy and he worked there for a time. Later on, it was liquidated and\nhe worked in the hospital pharmacy in ghetto. | was sick in the hospital with the\ninfection and my father was taken out by the Gestapo in his white coat, from the\npharmacy with another group of people from the hospital staff, and they were sent to\na labor camp in Estonia.",
        "Anthony: You remember when this was?",
        "Lily: The liquidation of the ghetto was in September in 1943 and this was during the\nsummer in 1943. | saw once, my father, later on. When | was in labor camp,\nDunawerke, it was nearby of Kaiserwald [did not specify whether Kaiserwald camp or\ntown of Kaiserwald, now Mezaparks], once a woman came and said, you know, | met\nsomebody who says he is David Mazur and he was crying going around there looking\nfor his two daughters, little girls. | said that | know you because when we had a very\nbad toothache, from the labor camp they used to send us to Kaiserwald, to this\nGerman dentist, and she had a very bad toothache. She went and she met him. |\nreally don't know exactly how they met but he was desperate. When he heard there",
        "are women from Vilna, he was looking for us. He was sent from Estonia to this\nconcentration camp, Kaiserwald.",
        "Anthony: Kaiserwald, where you go?",
        "Lily: Yes, we go Kaiserwald. The next day | went and | pretended that | have a very bad\ntoothache and | went to Kaiserwald. | risked my life and | found him. Before | went\nthere, | collected some bread and | brought him bread. When | saw him, | didn't\nrecognize him. He was wearing the striped uniform and all of a sudden he shrunk and |\nmean that it was just somebody that was not my father. We were standing behind the\nwall because women and men were not supposed to--Jewish women and men were\nnot supposed to communicate even. We were standing and he asked me where is my\nsister? | think it was the time when my sister was very sick with rheumatic fever. This\nwas the reason she didn't come and she was in a small like a--it was called a\nkrankenrevier, in this labor camp. | said that she was all right and that she's with me\ntogether. He said, look after we will survive, | want you to come to the pharmacy in\nSoty [Salos] and this is where we are to meet. When you come there, the only thing |\nask you, you should bring me your good name. | understand he meant that he wants\nto see me and my sister, two virgins, he meant. He says to me, | don't need so much\nbread, | need cigarettes. He wanted to smoke. Can you come tomorrow again? |\ncame back and | asked again and somehow they let me come. | remember that my\nfriends there that worked in the labor camp, we collected warm socks and gloves and\nalso got some tobacco and paper and | was so happy because when we were working\nin the labor camp, there were also some day workers. They asked them for this\ntobacco and they gave it to them. They were Latvian day workers, and also prisoners\nof war from Holland. The next day when | came there and | was looking for him but he\nwasn't there.",

After\nliberation, when | was very sick, she recovered sooner and she was--kind of took over\nand she became the older sister.

        "Lily: Physical support is kind of--we were looking out for each other. There was the\nloneliness and abandonment--is a very big moral deterrent. We kind of stuck together.\nAt night, when we slept, we were always together so this kind of gave us strength.",

She didn't have her friends,\nshe didn't know what to do with herself; she was mostly spending that time waiting for\nme or my aunt or my father to come back and bring her something to eat.
