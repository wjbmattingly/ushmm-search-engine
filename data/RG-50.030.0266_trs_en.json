        "Question: Could you please tell me your name?",
        "Answer: My name's Robert Zimmer. I now live in Williamsburg, Virginia.",
        "Q: Where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Buffalo, New York, on the 28th of April 1924.",
        "Q: Could you tell us a little bit about what Buffalo was like, your childhood was like in\nBuffalo?",
        "A: Well, I was part of the working class community. My dad was a machinist on the Erie\nRailroad, and we lived through the Depression, which was sort of harrowing at times,\nespecially one Christmas Eve when my dad came home and said he was laid off, and then\nthat he was out of work about six months, and then he got back to work again; things\nimproved from that point. So I was a Depression child. We didn't know we were poor.\nWe -- I went to public school, walked, oh, eight-tenths of a mile I guess. I was a\nkindergartner. And then went through high school. Obviously, for my size, I played\nbasketball, but it was a small high school. There were only 44 of us in the graduating\nclass. I married a girl from the graduating class, back then. I've known her since we\nwere in kindergarten I guess, and -- but we didn't date until going to the senior prom\ntogether. By that time Pearl Harbor had happened, and everybody was going off to war\nor working in the war industries. I decided I wanted to go to college, although, I'd been\nthe first one in our family to graduate from high school even. My two older sisters, they\nare 10, 14 years older than I am, they left school as sophomores to help support the\nfamily. And my folks said that I didn't have to support the family if I went to college,\nand that was all the help they could give me for going away to school. I went to the state\nteacher's college at Brockport, New York. I had enlisted in the \u2014 enlisted Reserve Corp\nin July of '42, and was called to active duty then in April of '43. This enough background\nof growing up in Buffalo or not?",
        "Q: No, that's fine.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: In '42, after enlisting, can you tell us briefly what led up to your activity in Europe?",
        "A: Well, as I said, I'd enlisted in the Reserves, and they had permitted me to start college.\nThen in April '43 I went on active duty, went through processing at Port Agra, and then\nended up in basic training at Camp McQuaide in the Coast Guard Artillery. I applied for\na -- OCS, the Boston candidate school to get a commission. My battery commander\nrecommended that we take our applications back and apply for an army specialized\ntraining program, ASTP, which promised us 18 months of college training, and then\nofficers candidate school training. That sounded awfully good to me, and I said okay, and\nI went to Stanford University for processing, and then to the University of Oregon at\nEugene, Oregon, to study engineering. This was the most intense academic work I had\never gone through. Tremendous number of courses that we had to take. We had\nsupervised study every evening. We started at 6:00 o'clock in the morning, and had a\nschedule back then until 10:00 o'clock at night; and then lights were out at 10:30, so we\ndidn't have much free time. Then in April of '43, this program closed down because of the\nanticipation of the invasion of Europe, and these troops were really in a holding pattern,\nwe now realized, and we went to fill up the vacancies in the 11th Armored Division, and\nI became a -- well, I went to the 22nd Tank Battalion Company, AV, for medium tanks,\nand I was a bowl gunner, or a BOG, and an assistant driver on one of the Sherman tank,\nmedium tank. And they gave us, oh, several review of basic training, taught us how to\ndrive a tank and how to shoot a 75-millimeter gun from the tank, and while we're doing\nthings, basic survival, but we got the division -- well, the division was getting ready to\nship overseas then, in August, and we moved from California -- Camp Cooke, California\nto the East Coast, and I think that was Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, and went to board a\nship one night, the SS Samaria, and half of the division was on it, about 5,000 men, and\nthey congratulated us, that it was only single loaded. By that they meant that we didn't\nhave to share our bunks with anybody. Because in double loaded you have one bunk for\ntwo people, and we were able to sleep for eight hours and the other guy would sleep for\neight hours. But we had bunks by ourselves. And I shouldn't say bunk. It was actually --\nthey were hammocks that were strung across the dining room tables and the back table\nthere. It was a very, very quiet crossing, but we had British food, and the British didn't\nmake any friends among these American troops with the kind of food they gave us and\nthe service we got. We were very unhappy with the Brits on this score. I don't know if\nany of the other guys told you about it, but we had close to food riots on the ship. We did\nsee -- we were called to the general quarters several times, and we did see some action of\ndeath charges being dropped. It was a large convoy, and-- so I presume that they had\nsome alerts that there were u-boats stalking or trying to attack the convoy. We landed in\nLiverpool, and much to our surprise saw the headlines of the newspaper saying the SS\nSamaria had been sunk, and we got off the ship, and we were glad the news headline\nwasn't true. Then they put us on trains and took us to the southern part of England near\nWarminister where we drew tanks and had to clean up the equipment, because these\ntanks had been stored, a lot of Cosmoline, it's heavy grease on all parts. It's quite a chore\ncleaning it up and getting them in working condition. Then we had to check out the\ntanks, drive them enough to road test them and get a few miles on them so we were\nconfident that they weren't going to breakdown when we needed them. And then on about\nthe 16th or 17th of December -- I'm skipping over. We had a few trips to London, and I\ndid get into London in what they called a buzz bomb alley where there was a lot of\ndamage, and I was in London one night, and when some buzz bombs came in, we could\nhear the explosions and see the flashes, and the anti-aircraft was going off. So having\nbeen in London during some of the attacks, we were getting a poor taste of what the war\nwas going to be like. On the 16th or 17th of December we moved to Wayland, England,\nand boarded an LST. It's a landing ship tank that were under the auspices of the U.S.\nNavy. And we really envied the navy guys because they had clean beds with sheets,\nshowers, and a good cafeteria, good food, and a greatly enjoyed being guests of the Navy\nfor that short cross of the channel, which was just overnight. We landed in Sibret, and\nthen unloading the tanks, our tank had an accident. We were the number three tank being\nloaded, and so we're almost the last tank to unload. While the LST had a basketball\nbackboard \u2014 so when they didn't -- weren't carrying tanks, the crew could shoot baskets\nor something. Anyhow, our tank was under it, and the motion of unloading the tanks, the\nbackboard had dropped loose, and it swung down. Well, our gunner reached up to move\nthat so the hatch of the tank wouldn't hit it. Our tank commander was down on the deck\ndirecting our driver to get the tank off the LST. Well, just as our gunner, Edmonton --\nand most of these guys I refer to them by their last name \u2014 had reached out to lift this up.\nMartiburg [ph] gave Trevy [ph] the signal to move out, and he did, and Edmonton caught\nhis hand between this backboard and the chariot top. And he crushed two or three\nfingers, and part of his hand. Well, this was a real medical emergency, and nobody's\naround to help, so we bypass the column, and delivered Edmonton to a hospital by tank.\nWe picked up a motorcycle escort and drove through Sibret, and had -- the motorcycle\nMP didn't realize the tank could go that fast. We had steel tracks, and this was\nDecember, so it was cold weather, and they were cobblestone streets with streetcar tracks\non them, and we were skidding and swerving. In fact, we made about two turns where\nour tank went -- spint 360 degrees around before we changed directions. And, in fact, we\nalmost ran over another motorcycle. The M-view was directing traffic, and he let the --\nour escort come through, and he put up his hand for us to stop, and we weren't stopping,\nand he scrambled to get out of the way, and then we had two motorcycle escorts. Well,\nwe got to this hospital, and I had the distinction of being -- delivering the first patient\never by tank to this hospital. And I actually carried Edmonton. He was a small slight\nman, older than the rest of us, he was in our mid to late 30's, and we didn't see him until\nthe war was over, and heard that he had lost two fingers and part of the palm of his hand.\nThen we got back to the company, and loaded up with gas and ammunition, because at\nthis point we didn't know that there was a battle in the Bulge. We were originally\nscheduled to go to Calais and help -- well, sort of contain about 10,000 Germans that had\nbeen bypassed, and this was sort of our introduction to combat. We weren't going to go\nin and capture them, but we weren't going to let them come out either. They had live\nammunition, we had live ammunition, we shot, we killed, but we were just going to make\nsure that they didn't move. That was the original plans that we had. Well, they changed\nthat when the Battle of the Bulge started, and they gave orders to our division to travel\nfrom Sibret directly to Bastogne. This was a -- I'd say a force -- it was a force smart. We\ndrove until we ran out of gas, and the truck came by, handed up a gas can, we loaded up\nand kept going. We drove through Paris -- oh, this must have been about the 24th -- 23rd,\n24th. I want to say it was the 24th of December, Christmas Eve. Now the people in Paris\nknew about the Battle of the Bulge. They knew the German breakthrough, and we were\nbeing inundated with propaganda, that the Germans were going to be in Paris by\nChristmas. Well, the American Armored Division is a pretty impressive show of force to\ndrive through the city, and the people in Paris were out on the sidewalks, there were eight\nand ten gates, they were trying to climb up on the tanks giving us eggs and flowers and\nfruit. Everything we wanted, but our orders were not to stop, very specific not to stop. I\nremember driving up to the Arc of Triumph and making a sharp left turn, and drove on\nthrough to Sanson. And all the time it was just hurry, keep going, keep going. It's\nSanson they gave us a break to do some maintenance on the tanks, and I shouldn't use\nthat word \"break,\" because we had to work awfully hard. We had to break -- take the\ntrack apart, and take the connectors that linked each section of track. These come off as a\nbig one-inch nut on it, and you have to take that apart, take that off, then with a\nsledgehammer knock the connector off. And then we put on a new connector or an\nextender. We call them duckbills, which would extend the width of the track about four\nto five inches. And, again, these have to be put on with a sledgehammer, and then the\nnuts put back on and tightened up, and it was not easy work; heavy physical work, as\nwell as track -- threading that track up over the drive wheels and sprockets of the tank.\nThey had promised us a turkey dinner for Christmas day, and they delivered it. We got\nturkey, but that was all we got, turkey and bread; no fixings, but we had turkey. Well, at\nthis point they discovered that our tank, this is tank A3, had a bad transmission and so the\nrest of the division went on, and we stayed with ordinance while they repaired and\neventually they replaced the transmission, and then they decided it was an engine\nproblem; they replaced the engine. So the division went on to Neufchateau and through\nBastogne, and got into action very quickly. Our tank was behind, so we missed the first\nday \u2014 first several days of action. In fact, when we got up to Neufchateau, they held us\nthere until -- they thought the division was coming off the line, and they didn't, so we\nwere several days there. We didn't know where we were going to, just stayed put. I had\nsome interesting stories as we were traveling by ourselves. I remember, this was now\nsnow and ice, and I remember one little French boy, I would guess must have been seven\nor eight years old, about that high, came by the side of the road. He looked cold and\nmiserable. We stopped, and put some wool socks on him, and a hat, and gave him some\ncandy bars, and muffled him up as best as we could, but we had to go, but he did look\nlike a very forlorn waif by the side of the road. Then as we were driving beyond here,\nnow we're in France into Belgium, in that line there, a one-lane road, and it had sort of a\ncrown on it to help drainage, but it was all ice and snow, and it was snowing. This was\nvery tricky driving, because if we kept the tank balanced on the top of the crown, we\nmade good progress. If it was off balance, we'd slide down to one side until we hit the\nditch and got some soft dirt, and then the tracks would dig in and bring us up on top of\nthe thing, but usually we'd go up too far and then we'd slide down the other side. So we\nwere going down the road like this, up one side, down the other. This was all right until\nwe noticed that along both sides of the road there were these large trees, and they were,\noh, at least that big around. These trees were all notched, and they had little white boxes\nall wired around them. And we discovered later that these were boxes of TNT, and that\nwas primer cord, and this whole road had been mined like that in case the Germans did\nbreak through from Bastogne. They would have blown all these trees, and it would have\nbeen like jackstraws across that road, and they would have been denied to the Germans.\nThis concerned me driving down that road. First of all, we didn't -- we could see probably\nblowing that road while we were there. All we could see is bumping into something and\nsetting the whole thing up. So that was a harrowing experience. Then we caught up with\nthe division, and as I said, we waited, and then we were in the area around Longchamps\nwhich 1s, oh, two or three kilometers from Bastogne, in and around that area, and we --\nour company became part of CCR. The 11th Armored Division was divide -- made up of\nthree combat commands. Combat command CCA or CCB or CCR. And there could be\nany combination of battalions or companies in either one depending on the mission. Well,\nthe mission of Combat Command Ark, CCR, was to support whichever -- A or B -- had\nthe main action; in case of any difficulty, we'd back them up, in case they broke through,\nthen we were to go through the break and exploit it. So we were always moving here and\nthere depending on what the action was. Sometimes we'd move three or four times\nduring a night, maybe -- frequently, more than that, almost like a chess game, to get in\nposition where we expected the German thrust to be. And I remember painting our tanks\nwhite, or whitewashing them, so we could hardly see them with all that snow around, and\nit was very cold. Getting up in the morning, I'd take half three-quarters of an inch of\ngauze across the inside of the tank. There's no heaters in the tank, and we'd just be sitting\nthere, and as long as one man was on the radio, the rest of us could sleep, so we'd take\nturns doing that, but it was cold. And sometimes we'd be in position. I remember one --\nthis little valley where the forward slope of the valley, and on the other side of the knoll\nwas our German column. This morning at dawn, bright and clear, blue sky, it was\nbeautiful, and our friends in the 19th ?Akal? Air Command came over with their P-47s,\nand attacked this German column. Now, the column was out of sight, it was on the other\nside of this hill, but we could see the people dive down, we could see the machine guns\ngoing, we could see them drop bombs, and it actually disappeared around the crest of the\nhill. And after, oh, a half hour or so we got orders to move, that we were no longer\nneeded there. Air Force had taken care of the threat, so we moved to another position, but\nthat was a lot of the kinds of activity we were doing.",
        "Q: Do you remember any underground resistance as you were going from action to\naction?",
        "A: No, we didn't run into underground. We were very sympathetic to the Belgiums. I\nremember we would come across some of the Belgium homes that had been overrun by\nthe Germans, and I remember one little cottage we came into, and there was an elderly\nwoman, I'd say an old woman, maybe in her 80's. She was still laying in bed. She had a\nbullet hole in her head, and we had no need for it. Of course, there were all sorts of dead\nanimals around, but when it was cold, that didn't bother us. When it thawed that became\na problem. We were into the Bulge and had heard about the massacre of Normandy, and\nthat was in the northern section of Bulge, and the 11th was not involved in that, but that\nwent through that the whole American army I think. The Germans were not nice, and we\nweren't going to take any prisoners either.",
        "Q: How many people were killed?",
        "A: Oh, the massacre of Normandy, about 160 I think. These were American solders that\nhad been captured by the Germans and they were machine gunned. So the 11\" decided\nnot to take any prisoners for a while. And, in fact, General Patton had come down to\ndivision headquarters, which is quite a way downs by the chain of command, to give\ndirect orders to our division and commander that we were to take prisoners, and -- but we\nestablished our reputation then, and, so, we didn't wear patches, so -- we didn't want to be\ncaptured by the Germans; they didn't like us.",
        "Q: Patches?",
        "A: Shoulder patches showing that we were members of the 11th Armored Division, a\ntriangular patch that's red, yellow and blue with the 11th on it. And so we fought through\nthe Bulge, and that was a big battle. I understand that there were about 80,000 American\ncasualties, and a 100,000 German casualties in about six weeks. So it was a lot of very\nserious fighting, and small action is big action, and so on. We helped in the pinching off\nof the Bulge, drawing up with the First Army, part of the 41% Calvary, and Major Greene,\nor General Greene now, led that group to do that, and that was at Houffalize. And then\nfrom that point on we started pushing the Germans back, and we moved in to Luxemburg\nto bridge the sick-pick line, and we finally broke through at Prim or Prim, I guess it is.\nAnd at the time sat at the Prum River. And from that point then we made a dash to the\nline getting near Coblenz, took a breather there \u2014 a breather, a couple of days -- and then\nthey started moving us upstream of the line, so I guess we'd be moving east, and closed\noff the Saar-Moselle Triangle. That took a large amount of prisoners. I remember that\nkind of action, because at night we could see German search lights on the Rhine forming\na huge \"v\". So the German troops -- because they were disorganized. There were\nindividuals of small units, you know, with nowhere to go to get across. Of course, we\nwere killing them off, and taking them prisoners, and sending them back making sure\nthey didn't get across. We got to the line, and we crossed at --near Worms on a pontoon\nbridge, and much to our surprise there was the Navy in their Navy uniforms with their\nwhite sailor caps manning the pontoon rig, which was with smoke pots all around so we\ncouldn't -- but nobody could see it, but driving a tank across that was -- across the Rhine\non a pontoon bridge was sort of disconcerting shall we say? Everybody had their hatches\nopen. We're standing with their heads out in case that bridge went down, that we'd have\nsomewhat of a chance to get on the tank. We crossed there. And we started driving\nthrough Central Europe, heading toward -- well, it was actually East Germany now, and\ncaptured an arms plant -- a Walther arms plant at -- in Zella-Mehlis, and we're into\nCzechoslovakia, and we were the first American troops to cross the Czech border, but we\nwere pulled back and told that the Russians were supposed to have our case in Prague in\nCzechoslovakia. So we went south along the Czech/German border into Austria, and\nthrough Linz.",
        "Q: What is this timeframe?",
        "A: Timeframe, March/April of '45. We were moving very fast. One time we -- the\nGermans let us go through, and then they cut off our supplies, so we had to -- I think that\nwas in Kombach. Don't quote me on that name, but we were cut off there, and we had to\nsend our trucks with our light tanks back to fight the way through the Germans in order to\nget supplies and bring supplies up so we could keep moving. And we've heard that they'd\ngive us maps expecting us to cover the 20 miles in two or three days, and we'd do that in\na half a day, and we have to wait for maps so we can go on. Of course, the Germans were\nvery disorganized at this point, and when they did resist, it was sort of a last ditch stand,\nbut we were moving very fast, and the Armored Division just -- with CCA and CCB, they\njust use a pincers movement, and cut them off, and we'd just keep going.",
        "Q: At this point the war was turning back clearly _?",
        "A: Yes, a little. Again, in the front line, we didn't know what was happening elsewhere.\nWe were \u2014 We didn't have radios or news broadcasts, we did get newspapers. Every day\nwas another day at combat. We're just pressing on. A lot of my impressions are, you\nknow, hindsight. The day-to-day activities were just to keep that tank going, and drive\nuntil we hit resistance, and then we deploy to fight. So I remember one time in Briod, it\nwas the first -- only time we had to dismount from our tanks and fight on foot. This was -\n- This is scary for a tanker. A tanker feels very comfortable with that steel around them.\nBut there was a hospital there with British pilots there, and we couldn't get to it because\nbridges had been blown up, and we had to go across the bridges 1n the water, and then\ndeploy to take them down. The Germans who were guarding the Brits were very happy to\nsurrender, so they -- there was no resistance. But at the time they told us to dismount, we\ndidn't know what we were going to run into, and you never do, but we were able to cap --\nto relieve the -- liberate these British flyers, and turn the German prisoners we had over\nto them, and they took care of it, and --",
        "Q: What happened as your division approached Mauthausen, or how many _ +?",
        "A: We captured Linz, and we were the first troops into Austria. We captured Linz, and\nactually had heavier fighting at Linz then we had since the Battle of the Bulge. The\nothers had been rather sporadic. So we took a lot of casualties going into Linz. To give\nyou a little bit of a feel of this, I remember going into Linz. There was a railroad that was\nin a cut that was down, oh, I'd say, four feet below the road. The road was next to it, and\nthen there's a mountainside going up. Only room for one tank. Two tanks couldn't pass\neach other on this road. Coming up the mountain road, around a bend, where a group of\nabout, oh, 15 to 20 kids on bicycles. They were the Hitler young. They were in military\nuniform, and strapped to each bicycle was a Panzerfaust, an anti-tank weapon. It looked\nlike a football at the end of a hockey stick. They were coming, and we were going down,\nand we weren't going to let them get close, so -- and a kid on a bicycle is -- and I say a\nkid, these were 12, 13, 14 years old. And we had to open up with machines guns. It\nwasn't pretty. Some of them tried to climb the mountain side, they couldn't do that, and\nthey couldn't drop down to the railroad cut, we'd just drove right through it. That was\ngoing into Linz. After Linz we kept going, and finally met the Russians. Now, this\nbeyond Mauthausen. At this point we had a company, 22nd Tactic, part of CCA, Combat\nCommand Day, and we were one of the lead companies. So we had bypassed\nMauthausen. Other units of the 11\" found Mauthausen. We started getting rumors from\nour guys, the cooks and bakers who were going back for supplies, that they had found a\nconcentration camp. And some of the rumors we heard were that there were bodies\nstuffed down wells, that there were bodies stacked as cord wood all over the place. They\neven said that they had found some lampshades made out of human skin that had tattoos\non them. This came at the time when we got to Russia. Now, the deal with the Russians\nwere that there would be a ten mile buffer zone from the Russians and the American\nArmy, and they were between the Germans that were trying to surrender, and they were\ndesperately trying to surrender to the Americans rather than the Russians. And at this\npoint a large number of the 12\u201c SS Panzer Group surrendered to our lines. We were to --\nthey were supposed to surrender to the Russians but didn't. We finally took them under\ncontrol, and our control was just an open field, and we mark it off with telephone wire,\njust strung telephone wire about two or three strands of it on pipes or posts stuck in the\nground. There was a stream flowing through the field. I don't know how many thousand\ntroops and Germans were in there. We had set up our tanks at about a hundred foot\nintervals, and we just rounded the machine gun between the tanks. And we weren't going\nto let any Germans get out. We weren't very careful about them. If we saw any\nmovement, a machine gun would go off. We didn't care if 1t sprayed through the camp.\nSome of our guys saw some Germans trying to swim in the stream, and, again, we\nmachine gunned them, and let fly a whole round of ammunition just to make sure. We\ndidn't have facilities to feed them, so periodically, like every other day or so, we'd shoot a\nhorse and drag it into the camp, and it was up to them to butcher it and how to distribute\nthe meat however they want. That was about the only food we could give them. This\nwas going on while Mauthausen was being cleaned up and made, quote, Suitable for\nhuman habitation. In other words, other members -- parts of our Division were at\nMauthausen taking care of the sick, burying the dead, and because -- there's talk \u2014 finding\nthe camp, it was a surprise to the Division. We weren't prepared for it. We didn't know\nthey existed. We had no idea of the extent of it. We didn't have food, we didn't have\nmedics to help the people. Some of the people died just running to our tanks and half\ntracks. Emotionally, they were drained, but physically they were kind of a skeleton. The\nfood we had wasn't appropriate for a person who was -- had been on a starvation diet.\nAnd they started eating food too fast, and this didn't agree with their stomachs, and so\nthey would get even sticker, and many of them died. It was a very sad thing, but we\ndidn't know, because the medics could have been backing us up, but we were so far ahead\n-- actually, the 11th, when the war was over, we were the furthest east of any American\ntroop. We were way east of Berlin. Most people don't realize that the Third Army had\ngotten that far east. And our lines were awfully far extended. And it was a difficult thing\nfor them to bring the resources up to take care of these people, and, fortunately, we were\nable to save off many of them.",
        "Q: When your division first went in -- I realize you weren't there, so -- but other members\nwere, what happened to the SS who were the head of the camps? Do you know whatever\nhappened to the upper echelon the day in Europe under your supervision --",
        "A: What I've heard was that when the tanks got close to the camp, the Germans ran, they\nleft, and I don't know if they were captured or if they were able to hide themselves or\nwhat. The -- I'm sure the reaction of the guys was that, if there was no resistance, we had\nto do something with these sick and dying people. You know, thousands of people that\nare dying, some dying as you're looking at them. It was something that nobody was\nprepared for. And I'm sure that we weren't -- the guys weren't concerned about the\nguards that had run away. But I know in other -- let's see. What was the name of that\ntown? Well, we hit a small city that had a lot of forced labor, slave labor, mainly French\nand Dutch people. When we liberated that, the French and the Dutch took care of their\nguards very quickly, and not very humanly; they just beat them up, and beat them to\ndeath. And I imagine if there were any survivors over at the camp, were in physical\ncondition, they got their hands on the guards at Mauthausen. They were treated the same\nway.",
        "Q: Do you if there were men and women who were at the camp?",
        "A: There were men and women and children. I've been back to the camp -- I went back\nthere about five years ago. The camp was made up mainly of East Europeans, many\nPoles, Latvians, Estonians, Bulgarian, there were even a few Americans, 2- or 300\nAmericans in that camp. There were predominantly Jewish, but there were other people\nthere too. They were, I guess, masons and catholics and the thing.",
        "Q: ?",
        "A: Yeah. So there were all sorts of people in there. We could see the grave sites, mass\ngrave in the film that some of the guys in the division took. We used our bulldozers to\ndig out the grave, but the Germans in the local community -- I guess this was Austria, I\nshould say Austria, it's in Norwood really -- denied knowing anything about this camp.\nThat is hard to believe because of the stench that was coming from the camp. You could\nsmell it for miles away. And the sight, you might imagine, but the smell no one can\nimagine. Well, we got the local people to help bury, and so we made them place each\nbody in the trench as gently as they could. We filled the trench, and then had them put\ndirt over them with shovels, but once there was covering of dirt, then we used a bulldozer\nto put more dirt over them, and then put another layer of bodies in. The danger from\ndisease was so great we had to get these bodies -- there's thousands of them \u2014 into the\nground, and we had to get them buried.",
        "Q: How close was the closest town to the concentration camp? You said you could smell\nthis for miles?",
        "A: Mauthausen overlooks the Danube River, and the town of Mauthausen. I would guess\nthe distance from the town to the camp was maybe three kilometers. Not very far. That's\nwhy it stretches the imagination that they wouldn't know what was happening there,\nbecause the shift of the wind, they'd know it.",
        "Q: What was the town peoples' response when your division had come in and then\nrealized that the camp was being liberated? Did they have a response to the people who\nhad been in the camps?",
        "A: I don't know. Remember, we had bypassed it. The people lived in a small farming\nvillage, and everybody there denied being Nazi, denied knowing anything about the\ncamps. This village was pretty remote from Mauthausen. We were about 20 or 30 miles\nfrom them by that time. And they didn't have good communication, just a -- had to take a\ndirt road to get into the village, in fact. So -- and that's -- Afterwards, they started taking\ntours of the guys through the camp, and then shortly after that, in July, the Division was\ndisbanded, and we were preparing to go to Japan to fight over there.",
        "Q: So members of the Division were brought in. When people grew up as prisoners in\nthe camp, still in the camp? Where were they --",
        "A: Yes. This was in the period when they were trying to, not only bring up our medical\nstaff and supplies, but just even while the burial details were in progress so that the guys\nin the Division could see what's happening. And this sort of reinforces what we've been\nfighting for, although, we didn't know it. From Battle of the Bulge on, we were fighting\nmost of the troops of a -- Panzer groups. Now the Panzer group was made up of several\npounds or division, so it was a large -- almost a corps type thing. But we -- The people in\nthese small towns, they said they didn't know anything about it. I suspect they were\ntelling the truth, but the people close to Mauthausen had to know what was going on.",
        "Q: What happened to the people that -- your part of the division regarding the Panzer\ngroups?",
        "A: When Mauthausen was cleared of the survivors, and the dead had been buried, our\nprisoners were transported back to Mauthausen, and they were incarcerated in those\nbarracks until they were later exchanged probably to the Russians, because they were\nsupposed to be turned over to the Russians anyway, and I suspect the Russians kept them\nfor X number of years at forced labor. I don't have -- that's a rumor I had.",
        "Q: So thousands of people in the Panzer group that you had to guard?",
        "A: Yep.",
        "Q: And then they were moved to the concentration camps?",
        "A: Uh-hm.",
        "Q: How did your detail wind up from that part of the war, at Mauthausen?",
        "A: See, the war was over shortly after that. And, in fact, the day we got the word that the\nwar was over, there was a lot of celebration, you know? And we got word about 10:00\no'clock in the morning. And there was a lot of celebrating. And then about 11:00 o'clock\nat night we get an urgent message to mount our tanks and move out, that 52 German\nTiger Tanks were going to break through to a readout area in their purchase garden,\nsomewhere in that area. And, so, we had to move from this little town we were in to head\nthe tanks off. And the German Tiger Tank is a huge tank, and greatly outguns, and\nthere's much more armor than American Sherman Tank; they had 88-millimeter cannon,\nand we had a 76-millimeter. And kind of against Tiger, is not what we really like to do,\nbut we had to drive through the mountains to head these guys off, but we had drunken\ndrivers taking us there, and it was a blackout drive, so it was rather hazardous to your\nhealth just to ride the tanks. But we got to where we were supposed to be, and the\nGermans didn't show up. It was a trick or a rumor, that there were no Tiger Tanks\ncoming through. But that was really the last incident of the war, as far as I remember,\nother than going on guard duty in Star and Read, and eventually up to Nuremburg to\nsupervise the destruction of German ammunition by German POWs. And then I was able\nto go home, and didn't really-- end of December of '45, and was actually discharged from\nthe Army in January of '46. And coming home, we were on victory ship, the Norway\nVictory, and it was a small boat, today's standards, and we had a tremendous gale in the\nnorth Atlantic. Instead of taking seven days to go from Sibret to the Norfolk, it took us\neleven. And I was seasick ten-and-a-half of those 11 days. It literally -- the waves were\n60 to a hundred feet high. I mean, you'd look up, and the ship was down here, and all\nyou saw was water way up there. But we did get to Norfolk safely, and then we were\ndischarged, and I used the GI bill to pick up a civilian life, and it was a typical young\nman ina hurry. I used the GI bill to get three degrees, and I -- including a master's and a\ndoctorate, a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1950. So -- and then I went into\ncommunity college work, and became the founding president of three community\ncolleges in the country. So I had a whole professional career. But then 1976 -- oh, I had -\n- when I got my Ph.D. in '50, Korea was breaking out, and in '52 it looked like Korea was\ngoing to become World War III, and I could see myself going back into service as a tank\ncrewman, PFC type. And so with a hot Ph.D. in my pocket, I went to various services to\nsee if I could get a direct commission. I went to the Army, and they said, We'd make you\na second lieutenant in the quartermaster corps. I went to the Navy, and they said, we\nhave no use for Ph.D.s. Went to the Army -- or the Air Force rather, and they said, We'd\nmake you a first lieutenant as a human resources research specialist. I figured, with a title\nlike that, 1t would take me -- well, it took me about 20 seconds to accept the Reserve\ncommission with the Air Force, and I stayed active in the Air Force Reserves. And in '76\nwent back in active duty with the Air Force at the Pentagon. I was a full colonel at this\npoint, and became the director of post-secretary education for the Secretary of Defense,\nand helped with the establishment -- or rather with the degree granting authority that the\ncommunity college of the Air Force had. So I was still in the community college work.",
        "Q: We're running out of time. Going back to Mauthausen, were you able to take a tour\nthrough at the time --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- after part of your division -- liberating the camp, and cleaned part of it, you said\nother parts of your troop has passed through. Had you gone through --",
        "A: I wasn't part of that group. I had gone back, as I said, five years ago. That would\nhave been '85, maybe '86. Most of my reactions are from the film that Ray Bush had\ntaken.",
        "Q: Can tell me a little bit about how that came about?",
        "A: Well, Ray was with the '56 engineers, and he had a small eight-millimeter camerA:\nAnd we were all told not to have that, cameras or keep diaries or take pictures of\nanything, but that didn't stop most of us. And he was taking pictures of combat from\nEngland right in through the Bulge on to Mauthausen. And he would send those home.\nSome of them were x-rayed, unfortunately, but he put them all together in this -- two\nreels of film, and he showed them to us at the division reunion. And the offhand, if I\nwanted a copy of it, he'd be glad to do it, and I took him up on it. I had a copy made, or\nhe had copy made, I paid for it, but whatever, and it was fortunate I did, because his copy\nwas destroyed when a fire went through his home. So mine was the only surviving copy,\nand that's why I thought, rather than take a chance on it, because it is rather historic\nevidence that the Holocaust Museum should be -- would be the place to deposit it.",
        "Q: And the film was taken as --",
        "A: It took as day-to-day activities would provide. And I know one section of the film,\nthere was a section of the 22nd Tank Battalion moving, and I think he got my picture, but\nI was all buttoned up inside the tank. He got a picture of my tank anyhow.",
        "Q: And it showed the prisoners that survived as well?",
        "A: Yes. It was showing them in the barracks in various stages of emaciation. It showed\nthem unloading the dead in wagons, showed them placing them in the mass graves,\nshowed them covering the graves, and even took a view from the concentration camp\nover to the countryside where you could see the Danube River.",
        "Q: And in your experiences of the war, was this something that was totally unexpected?",
        "A: Yes. We were fighting the Nazis. We were soldiers fighting soldiers. We didn't \u2014\nnothing prepared us for this. Nobody told us that there were concentration camps. I don't\nthink anybody knew. We didn't expect anything when we overran Mauthausen. It just\nsort of reinforced the -- our feeling that we were fighting a just war, that whatever\nhappened, it was right that we should be in the war, that we were the good guys, white\nhats, even though there are times during combat when we weren't nice guys, but combat\nis like that, you fight to survive.",

        "Answer: My name's Robert Zimmer. I now live in Williamsburg, Virginia.",
        "A: I was born in Buffalo, New York, on the 28th of April 1924.",
        "A: Well, I was part of the working class community. My dad was a machinist on the Erie\nRailroad, and we lived through the Depression, which was sort of harrowing at times,\nespecially one Christmas Eve when my dad came home and said he was laid off, and then\nthat he was out of work about six months, and then he got back to work again; things\nimproved from that point. So I was a Depression child. We didn't know we were poor.\nWe -- I went to public school, walked, oh, eight-tenths of a mile I guess. I was a\nkindergartner. And then went through high school. Obviously, for my size, I played\nbasketball, but it was a small high school. There were only 44 of us in the graduating\nclass. I married a girl from the graduating class, back then. I've known her since we\nwere in kindergarten I guess, and -- but we didn't date until going to the senior prom\ntogether. By that time Pearl Harbor had happened, and everybody was going off to war\nor working in the war industries. I decided I wanted to go to college, although, I'd been\nthe first one in our family to graduate from high school even. My two older sisters, they\nare 10, 14 years older than I am, they left school as sophomores to help support the\nfamily. And my folks said that I didn't have to support the family if I went to college,\nand that was all the help they could give me for going away to school. I went to the state\nteacher's college at Brockport, New York. I had enlisted in the \u2014 enlisted Reserve Corp\nin July of '42, and was called to active duty then in April of '43. This enough background\nof growing up in Buffalo or not?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well, as I said, I'd enlisted in the Reserves, and they had permitted me to start college.\nThen in April '43 I went on active duty, went through processing at Port Agra, and then\nended up in basic training at Camp McQuaide in the Coast Guard Artillery. I applied for\na -- OCS, the Boston candidate school to get a commission. My battery commander\nrecommended that we take our applications back and apply for an army specialized\ntraining program, ASTP, which promised us 18 months of college training, and then\nofficers candidate school training. That sounded awfully good to me, and I said okay, and\nI went to Stanford University for processing, and then to the University of Oregon at\nEugene, Oregon, to study engineering. This was the most intense academic work I had\never gone through. Tremendous number of courses that we had to take. We had\nsupervised study every evening. We started at 6:00 o'clock in the morning, and had a\nschedule back then until 10:00 o'clock at night; and then lights were out at 10:30, so we\ndidn't have much free time. Then in April of '43, this program closed down because of the\nanticipation of the invasion of Europe, and these troops were really in a holding pattern,\nwe now realized, and we went to fill up the vacancies in the 11th Armored Division, and\nI became a -- well, I went to the 22nd Tank Battalion Company, AV, for medium tanks,\nand I was a bowl gunner, or a BOG, and an assistant driver on one of the Sherman tank,\nmedium tank. And they gave us, oh, several review of basic training, taught us how to\ndrive a tank and how to shoot a 75-millimeter gun from the tank, and while we're doing\nthings, basic survival, but we got the division -- well, the division was getting ready to\nship overseas then, in August, and we moved from California -- Camp Cooke, California\nto the East Coast, and I think that was Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, and went to board a\nship one night, the SS Samaria, and half of the division was on it, about 5,000 men, and\nthey congratulated us, that it was only single loaded. By that they meant that we didn't\nhave to share our bunks with anybody. Because in double loaded you have one bunk for\ntwo people, and we were able to sleep for eight hours and the other guy would sleep for\neight hours. But we had bunks by ourselves. And I shouldn't say bunk. It was actually --\nthey were hammocks that were strung across the dining room tables and the back table\nthere. It was a very, very quiet crossing, but we had British food, and the British didn't\nmake any friends among these American troops with the kind of food they gave us and\nthe service we got. We were very unhappy with the Brits on this score. I don't know if\nany of the other guys told you about it, but we had close to food riots on the ship. We did\nsee -- we were called to the general quarters several times, and we did see some action of\ndeath charges being dropped. It was a large convoy, and-- so I presume that they had\nsome alerts that there were u-boats stalking or trying to attack the convoy. We landed in\nLiverpool, and much to our surprise saw the headlines of the newspaper saying the SS\nSamaria had been sunk, and we got off the ship, and we were glad the news headline\nwasn't true. Then they put us on trains and took us to the southern part of England near\nWarminister where we drew tanks and had to clean up the equipment, because these\ntanks had been stored, a lot of Cosmoline, it's heavy grease on all parts. It's quite a chore\ncleaning it up and getting them in working condition. Then we had to check out the\ntanks, drive them enough to road test them and get a few miles on them so we were\nconfident that they weren't going to breakdown when we needed them. And then on about\nthe 16th or 17th of December -- I'm skipping over. We had a few trips to London, and I\ndid get into London in what they called a buzz bomb alley where there was a lot of\ndamage, and I was in London one night, and when some buzz bombs came in, we could\nhear the explosions and see the flashes, and the anti-aircraft was going off. So having\nbeen in London during some of the attacks, we were getting a poor taste of what the war\nwas going to be like. On the 16th or 17th of December we moved to Wayland, England,\nand boarded an LST. It's a landing ship tank that were under the auspices of the U.S.\nNavy. And we really envied the navy guys because they had clean beds with sheets,\nshowers, and a good cafeteria, good food, and a greatly enjoyed being guests of the Navy\nfor that short cross of the channel, which was just overnight. We landed in Sibret, and\nthen unloading the tanks, our tank had an accident. We were the number three tank being\nloaded, and so we're almost the last tank to unload. While the LST had a basketball\nbackboard \u2014 so when they didn't -- weren't carrying tanks, the crew could shoot baskets\nor something. Anyhow, our tank was under it, and the motion of unloading the tanks, the\nbackboard had dropped loose, and it swung down. Well, our gunner reached up to move\nthat so the hatch of the tank wouldn't hit it. Our tank commander was down on the deck\ndirecting our driver to get the tank off the LST. Well, just as our gunner, Edmonton --\nand most of these guys I refer to them by their last name \u2014 had reached out to lift this up.\nMartiburg [ph] gave Trevy [ph] the signal to move out, and he did, and Edmonton caught\nhis hand between this backboard and the chariot top. And he crushed two or three\nfingers, and part of his hand. Well, this was a real medical emergency, and nobody's\naround to help, so we bypass the column, and delivered Edmonton to a hospital by tank.\nWe picked up a motorcycle escort and drove through Sibret, and had -- the motorcycle\nMP didn't realize the tank could go that fast. We had steel tracks, and this was\nDecember, so it was cold weather, and they were cobblestone streets with streetcar tracks\non them, and we were skidding and swerving. In fact, we made about two turns where\nour tank went -- spint 360 degrees around before we changed directions. And, in fact, we\nalmost ran over another motorcycle. The M-view was directing traffic, and he let the --\nour escort come through, and he put up his hand for us to stop, and we weren't stopping,\nand he scrambled to get out of the way, and then we had two motorcycle escorts. Well,\nwe got to this hospital, and I had the distinction of being -- delivering the first patient\never by tank to this hospital. And I actually carried Edmonton. He was a small slight\nman, older than the rest of us, he was in our mid to late 30's, and we didn't see him until\nthe war was over, and heard that he had lost two fingers and part of the palm of his hand.\nThen we got back to the company, and loaded up with gas and ammunition, because at\nthis point we didn't know that there was a battle in the Bulge. We were originally\nscheduled to go to Calais and help -- well, sort of contain about 10,000 Germans that had\nbeen bypassed, and this was sort of our introduction to combat. We weren't going to go\nin and capture them, but we weren't going to let them come out either. They had live\nammunition, we had live ammunition, we shot, we killed, but we were just going to make\nsure that they didn't move. That was the original plans that we had. Well, they changed\nthat when the Battle of the Bulge started, and they gave orders to our division to travel\nfrom Sibret directly to Bastogne. This was a -- I'd say a force -- it was a force smart. We\ndrove until we ran out of gas, and the truck came by, handed up a gas can, we loaded up\nand kept going. We drove through Paris -- oh, this must have been about the 24th -- 23rd,\n24th. I want to say it was the 24th of December, Christmas Eve. Now the people in Paris\nknew about the Battle of the Bulge. They knew the German breakthrough, and we were\nbeing inundated with propaganda, that the Germans were going to be in Paris by\nChristmas. Well, the American Armored Division is a pretty impressive show of force to\ndrive through the city, and the people in Paris were out on the sidewalks, there were eight\nand ten gates, they were trying to climb up on the tanks giving us eggs and flowers and\nfruit. Everything we wanted, but our orders were not to stop, very specific not to stop. I\nremember driving up to the Arc of Triumph and making a sharp left turn, and drove on\nthrough to Sanson. And all the time it was just hurry, keep going, keep going. It's\nSanson they gave us a break to do some maintenance on the tanks, and I shouldn't use\nthat word \"break,\" because we had to work awfully hard. We had to break -- take the\ntrack apart, and take the connectors that linked each section of track. These come off as a\nbig one-inch nut on it, and you have to take that apart, take that off, then with a\nsledgehammer knock the connector off. And then we put on a new connector or an\nextender. We call them duckbills, which would extend the width of the track about four\nto five inches. And, again, these have to be put on with a sledgehammer, and then the\nnuts put back on and tightened up, and it was not easy work; heavy physical work, as\nwell as track -- threading that track up over the drive wheels and sprockets of the tank.\nThey had promised us a turkey dinner for Christmas day, and they delivered it. We got\nturkey, but that was all we got, turkey and bread; no fixings, but we had turkey. Well, at\nthis point they discovered that our tank, this is tank A3, had a bad transmission and so the\nrest of the division went on, and we stayed with ordinance while they repaired and\neventually they replaced the transmission, and then they decided it was an engine\nproblem; they replaced the engine. So the division went on to Neufchateau and through\nBastogne, and got into action very quickly. Our tank was behind, so we missed the first\nday \u2014 first several days of action. In fact, when we got up to Neufchateau, they held us\nthere until -- they thought the division was coming off the line, and they didn't, so we\nwere several days there. We didn't know where we were going to, just stayed put. I had\nsome interesting stories as we were traveling by ourselves. I remember, this was now\nsnow and ice, and I remember one little French boy, I would guess must have been seven\nor eight years old, about that high, came by the side of the road. He looked cold and\nmiserable. We stopped, and put some wool socks on him, and a hat, and gave him some\ncandy bars, and muffled him up as best as we could, but we had to go, but he did look\nlike a very forlorn waif by the side of the road. Then as we were driving beyond here,\nnow we're in France into Belgium, in that line there, a one-lane road, and it had sort of a\ncrown on it to help drainage, but it was all ice and snow, and it was snowing. This was\nvery tricky driving, because if we kept the tank balanced on the top of the crown, we\nmade good progress. If it was off balance, we'd slide down to one side until we hit the\nditch and got some soft dirt, and then the tracks would dig in and bring us up on top of\nthe thing, but usually we'd go up too far and then we'd slide down the other side. So we\nwere going down the road like this, up one side, down the other. This was all right until\nwe noticed that along both sides of the road there were these large trees, and they were,\noh, at least that big around. These trees were all notched, and they had little white boxes\nall wired around them. And we discovered later that these were boxes of TNT, and that\nwas primer cord, and this whole road had been mined like that in case the Germans did\nbreak through from Bastogne. They would have blown all these trees, and it would have\nbeen like jackstraws across that road, and they would have been denied to the Germans.\nThis concerned me driving down that road. First of all, we didn't -- we could see probably\nblowing that road while we were there. All we could see is bumping into something and\nsetting the whole thing up. So that was a harrowing experience. Then we caught up with\nthe division, and as I said, we waited, and then we were in the area around Longchamps\nwhich 1s, oh, two or three kilometers from Bastogne, in and around that area, and we --\nour company became part of CCR. The 11th Armored Division was divide -- made up of\nthree combat commands. Combat command CCA or CCB or CCR. And there could be\nany combination of battalions or companies in either one depending on the mission. Well,\nthe mission of Combat Command Ark, CCR, was to support whichever -- A or B -- had\nthe main action; in case of any difficulty, we'd back them up, in case they broke through,\nthen we were to go through the break and exploit it. So we were always moving here and\nthere depending on what the action was. Sometimes we'd move three or four times\nduring a night, maybe -- frequently, more than that, almost like a chess game, to get in\nposition where we expected the German thrust to be. And I remember painting our tanks\nwhite, or whitewashing them, so we could hardly see them with all that snow around, and\nit was very cold. Getting up in the morning, I'd take half three-quarters of an inch of\ngauze across the inside of the tank. There's no heaters in the tank, and we'd just be sitting\nthere, and as long as one man was on the radio, the rest of us could sleep, so we'd take\nturns doing that, but it was cold. And sometimes we'd be in position. I remember one --\nthis little valley where the forward slope of the valley, and on the other side of the knoll\nwas our German column. This morning at dawn, bright and clear, blue sky, it was\nbeautiful, and our friends in the 19th ?Akal? Air Command came over with their P-47s,\nand attacked this German column. Now, the column was out of sight, it was on the other\nside of this hill, but we could see the people dive down, we could see the machine guns\ngoing, we could see them drop bombs, and it actually disappeared around the crest of the\nhill. And after, oh, a half hour or so we got orders to move, that we were no longer\nneeded there. Air Force had taken care of the threat, so we moved to another position, but\nthat was a lot of the kinds of activity we were doing.",
        "A: No, we didn't run into underground. We were very sympathetic to the Belgiums. I\nremember we would come across some of the Belgium homes that had been overrun by\nthe Germans, and I remember one little cottage we came into, and there was an elderly\nwoman, I'd say an old woman, maybe in her 80's. She was still laying in bed. She had a\nbullet hole in her head, and we had no need for it. Of course, there were all sorts of dead\nanimals around, but when it was cold, that didn't bother us. When it thawed that became\na problem. We were into the Bulge and had heard about the massacre of Normandy, and\nthat was in the northern section of Bulge, and the 11th was not involved in that, but that\nwent through that the whole American army I think. The Germans were not nice, and we\nweren't going to take any prisoners either.",
        "A: Oh, the massacre of Normandy, about 160 I think. These were American solders that\nhad been captured by the Germans and they were machine gunned. So the 11\" decided\nnot to take any prisoners for a while. And, in fact, General Patton had come down to\ndivision headquarters, which is quite a way downs by the chain of command, to give\ndirect orders to our division and commander that we were to take prisoners, and -- but we\nestablished our reputation then, and, so, we didn't wear patches, so -- we didn't want to be\ncaptured by the Germans; they didn't like us.",
        "A: Shoulder patches showing that we were members of the 11th Armored Division, a\ntriangular patch that's red, yellow and blue with the 11th on it. And so we fought through\nthe Bulge, and that was a big battle. I understand that there were about 80,000 American\ncasualties, and a 100,000 German casualties in about six weeks. So it was a lot of very\nserious fighting, and small action is big action, and so on. We helped in the pinching off\nof the Bulge, drawing up with the First Army, part of the 41% Calvary, and Major Greene,\nor General Greene now, led that group to do that, and that was at Houffalize. And then\nfrom that point on we started pushing the Germans back, and we moved in to Luxemburg\nto bridge the sick-pick line, and we finally broke through at Prim or Prim, I guess it is.\nAnd at the time sat at the Prum River. And from that point then we made a dash to the\nline getting near Coblenz, took a breather there \u2014 a breather, a couple of days -- and then\nthey started moving us upstream of the line, so I guess we'd be moving east, and closed\noff the Saar-Moselle Triangle. That took a large amount of prisoners. I remember that\nkind of action, because at night we could see German search lights on the Rhine forming\na huge \"v\". So the German troops -- because they were disorganized. There were\nindividuals of small units, you know, with nowhere to go to get across. Of course, we\nwere killing them off, and taking them prisoners, and sending them back making sure\nthey didn't get across. We got to the line, and we crossed at --near Worms on a pontoon\nbridge, and much to our surprise there was the Navy in their Navy uniforms with their\nwhite sailor caps manning the pontoon rig, which was with smoke pots all around so we\ncouldn't -- but nobody could see it, but driving a tank across that was -- across the Rhine\non a pontoon bridge was sort of disconcerting shall we say? Everybody had their hatches\nopen. We're standing with their heads out in case that bridge went down, that we'd have\nsomewhat of a chance to get on the tank. We crossed there. And we started driving\nthrough Central Europe, heading toward -- well, it was actually East Germany now, and\ncaptured an arms plant -- a Walther arms plant at -- in Zella-Mehlis, and we're into\nCzechoslovakia, and we were the first American troops to cross the Czech border, but we\nwere pulled back and told that the Russians were supposed to have our case in Prague in\nCzechoslovakia. So we went south along the Czech/German border into Austria, and\nthrough Linz.",
        "A: Timeframe, March/April of '45. We were moving very fast. One time we -- the\nGermans let us go through, and then they cut off our supplies, so we had to -- I think that\nwas in Kombach. Don't quote me on that name, but we were cut off there, and we had to\nsend our trucks with our light tanks back to fight the way through the Germans in order to\nget supplies and bring supplies up so we could keep moving. And we've heard that they'd\ngive us maps expecting us to cover the 20 miles in two or three days, and we'd do that in\na half a day, and we have to wait for maps so we can go on. Of course, the Germans were\nvery disorganized at this point, and when they did resist, it was sort of a last ditch stand,\nbut we were moving very fast, and the Armored Division just -- with CCA and CCB, they\njust use a pincers movement, and cut them off, and we'd just keep going.",
        "A: Yes, a little. Again, in the front line, we didn't know what was happening elsewhere.\nWe were \u2014 We didn't have radios or news broadcasts, we did get newspapers. Every day\nwas another day at combat. We're just pressing on. A lot of my impressions are, you\nknow, hindsight. The day-to-day activities were just to keep that tank going, and drive\nuntil we hit resistance, and then we deploy to fight. So I remember one time in Briod, it\nwas the first -- only time we had to dismount from our tanks and fight on foot. This was -\n- This is scary for a tanker. A tanker feels very comfortable with that steel around them.\nBut there was a hospital there with British pilots there, and we couldn't get to it because\nbridges had been blown up, and we had to go across the bridges 1n the water, and then\ndeploy to take them down. The Germans who were guarding the Brits were very happy to\nsurrender, so they -- there was no resistance. But at the time they told us to dismount, we\ndidn't know what we were going to run into, and you never do, but we were able to cap --\nto relieve the -- liberate these British flyers, and turn the German prisoners we had over\nto them, and they took care of it, and --",
        "A: We captured Linz, and we were the first troops into Austria. We captured Linz, and\nactually had heavier fighting at Linz then we had since the Battle of the Bulge. The\nothers had been rather sporadic. So we took a lot of casualties going into Linz. To give\nyou a little bit of a feel of this, I remember going into Linz. There was a railroad that was\nin a cut that was down, oh, I'd say, four feet below the road. The road was next to it, and\nthen there's a mountainside going up. Only room for one tank. Two tanks couldn't pass\neach other on this road. Coming up the mountain road, around a bend, where a group of\nabout, oh, 15 to 20 kids on bicycles. They were the Hitler young. They were in military\nuniform, and strapped to each bicycle was a Panzerfaust, an anti-tank weapon. It looked\nlike a football at the end of a hockey stick. They were coming, and we were going down,\nand we weren't going to let them get close, so -- and a kid on a bicycle is -- and I say a\nkid, these were 12, 13, 14 years old. And we had to open up with machines guns. It\nwasn't pretty. Some of them tried to climb the mountain side, they couldn't do that, and\nthey couldn't drop down to the railroad cut, we'd just drove right through it. That was\ngoing into Linz. After Linz we kept going, and finally met the Russians. Now, this\nbeyond Mauthausen. At this point we had a company, 22nd Tactic, part of CCA, Combat\nCommand Day, and we were one of the lead companies. So we had bypassed\nMauthausen. Other units of the 11\" found Mauthausen. We started getting rumors from\nour guys, the cooks and bakers who were going back for supplies, that they had found a\nconcentration camp. And some of the rumors we heard were that there were bodies\nstuffed down wells, that there were bodies stacked as cord wood all over the place. They\neven said that they had found some lampshades made out of human skin that had tattoos\non them. This came at the time when we got to Russia. Now, the deal with the Russians\nwere that there would be a ten mile buffer zone from the Russians and the American\nArmy, and they were between the Germans that were trying to surrender, and they were\ndesperately trying to surrender to the Americans rather than the Russians. And at this\npoint a large number of the 12\u201c SS Panzer Group surrendered to our lines. We were to --\nthey were supposed to surrender to the Russians but didn't. We finally took them under\ncontrol, and our control was just an open field, and we mark it off with telephone wire,\njust strung telephone wire about two or three strands of it on pipes or posts stuck in the\nground. There was a stream flowing through the field. I don't know how many thousand\ntroops and Germans were in there. We had set up our tanks at about a hundred foot\nintervals, and we just rounded the machine gun between the tanks. And we weren't going\nto let any Germans get out. We weren't very careful about them. If we saw any\nmovement, a machine gun would go off. We didn't care if 1t sprayed through the camp.\nSome of our guys saw some Germans trying to swim in the stream, and, again, we\nmachine gunned them, and let fly a whole round of ammunition just to make sure. We\ndidn't have facilities to feed them, so periodically, like every other day or so, we'd shoot a\nhorse and drag it into the camp, and it was up to them to butcher it and how to distribute\nthe meat however they want. That was about the only food we could give them. This\nwas going on while Mauthausen was being cleaned up and made, quote, Suitable for\nhuman habitation. In other words, other members -- parts of our Division were at\nMauthausen taking care of the sick, burying the dead, and because -- there's talk \u2014 finding\nthe camp, it was a surprise to the Division. We weren't prepared for it. We didn't know\nthey existed. We had no idea of the extent of it. We didn't have food, we didn't have\nmedics to help the people. Some of the people died just running to our tanks and half\ntracks. Emotionally, they were drained, but physically they were kind of a skeleton. The\nfood we had wasn't appropriate for a person who was -- had been on a starvation diet.\nAnd they started eating food too fast, and this didn't agree with their stomachs, and so\nthey would get even sticker, and many of them died. It was a very sad thing, but we\ndidn't know, because the medics could have been backing us up, but we were so far ahead\n-- actually, the 11th, when the war was over, we were the furthest east of any American\ntroop. We were way east of Berlin. Most people don't realize that the Third Army had\ngotten that far east. And our lines were awfully far extended. And it was a difficult thing\nfor them to bring the resources up to take care of these people, and, fortunately, we were\nable to save off many of them.",
        "A: What I've heard was that when the tanks got close to the camp, the Germans ran, they\nleft, and I don't know if they were captured or if they were able to hide themselves or\nwhat. The -- I'm sure the reaction of the guys was that, if there was no resistance, we had\nto do something with these sick and dying people. You know, thousands of people that\nare dying, some dying as you're looking at them. It was something that nobody was\nprepared for. And I'm sure that we weren't -- the guys weren't concerned about the\nguards that had run away. But I know in other -- let's see. What was the name of that\ntown? Well, we hit a small city that had a lot of forced labor, slave labor, mainly French\nand Dutch people. When we liberated that, the French and the Dutch took care of their\nguards very quickly, and not very humanly; they just beat them up, and beat them to\ndeath. And I imagine if there were any survivors over at the camp, were in physical\ncondition, they got their hands on the guards at Mauthausen. They were treated the same\nway.",
        "A: There were men and women and children. I've been back to the camp -- I went back\nthere about five years ago. The camp was made up mainly of East Europeans, many\nPoles, Latvians, Estonians, Bulgarian, there were even a few Americans, 2- or 300\nAmericans in that camp. There were predominantly Jewish, but there were other people\nthere too. They were, I guess, masons and catholics and the thing.",
        "A: Yeah. So there were all sorts of people in there. We could see the grave sites, mass\ngrave in the film that some of the guys in the division took. We used our bulldozers to\ndig out the grave, but the Germans in the local community -- I guess this was Austria, I\nshould say Austria, it's in Norwood really -- denied knowing anything about this camp.\nThat is hard to believe because of the stench that was coming from the camp. You could\nsmell it for miles away. And the sight, you might imagine, but the smell no one can\nimagine. Well, we got the local people to help bury, and so we made them place each\nbody in the trench as gently as they could. We filled the trench, and then had them put\ndirt over them with shovels, but once there was covering of dirt, then we used a bulldozer\nto put more dirt over them, and then put another layer of bodies in. The danger from\ndisease was so great we had to get these bodies -- there's thousands of them \u2014 into the\nground, and we had to get them buried.",
        "A: Mauthausen overlooks the Danube River, and the town of Mauthausen. I would guess\nthe distance from the town to the camp was maybe three kilometers. Not very far. That's\nwhy it stretches the imagination that they wouldn't know what was happening there,\nbecause the shift of the wind, they'd know it.",
        "A: I don't know. Remember, we had bypassed it. The people lived in a small farming\nvillage, and everybody there denied being Nazi, denied knowing anything about the\ncamps. This village was pretty remote from Mauthausen. We were about 20 or 30 miles\nfrom them by that time. And they didn't have good communication, just a -- had to take a\ndirt road to get into the village, in fact. So -- and that's -- Afterwards, they started taking\ntours of the guys through the camp, and then shortly after that, in July, the Division was\ndisbanded, and we were preparing to go to Japan to fight over there.",
        "A: Yes. This was in the period when they were trying to, not only bring up our medical\nstaff and supplies, but just even while the burial details were in progress so that the guys\nin the Division could see what's happening. And this sort of reinforces what we've been\nfighting for, although, we didn't know it. From Battle of the Bulge on, we were fighting\nmost of the troops of a -- Panzer groups. Now the Panzer group was made up of several\npounds or division, so it was a large -- almost a corps type thing. But we -- The people in\nthese small towns, they said they didn't know anything about it. I suspect they were\ntelling the truth, but the people close to Mauthausen had to know what was going on.",
        "A: When Mauthausen was cleared of the survivors, and the dead had been buried, our\nprisoners were transported back to Mauthausen, and they were incarcerated in those\nbarracks until they were later exchanged probably to the Russians, because they were\nsupposed to be turned over to the Russians anyway, and I suspect the Russians kept them\nfor X number of years at forced labor. I don't have -- that's a rumor I had.",
        "A: Yep.",
        "A: Uh-hm.",
        "A: See, the war was over shortly after that. And, in fact, the day we got the word that the\nwar was over, there was a lot of celebration, you know? And we got word about 10:00\no'clock in the morning. And there was a lot of celebrating. And then about 11:00 o'clock\nat night we get an urgent message to mount our tanks and move out, that 52 German\nTiger Tanks were going to break through to a readout area in their purchase garden,\nsomewhere in that area. And, so, we had to move from this little town we were in to head\nthe tanks off. And the German Tiger Tank is a huge tank, and greatly outguns, and\nthere's much more armor than American Sherman Tank; they had 88-millimeter cannon,\nand we had a 76-millimeter. And kind of against Tiger, is not what we really like to do,\nbut we had to drive through the mountains to head these guys off, but we had drunken\ndrivers taking us there, and it was a blackout drive, so it was rather hazardous to your\nhealth just to ride the tanks. But we got to where we were supposed to be, and the\nGermans didn't show up. It was a trick or a rumor, that there were no Tiger Tanks\ncoming through. But that was really the last incident of the war, as far as I remember,\nother than going on guard duty in Star and Read, and eventually up to Nuremburg to\nsupervise the destruction of German ammunition by German POWs. And then I was able\nto go home, and didn't really-- end of December of '45, and was actually discharged from\nthe Army in January of '46. And coming home, we were on victory ship, the Norway\nVictory, and it was a small boat, today's standards, and we had a tremendous gale in the\nnorth Atlantic. Instead of taking seven days to go from Sibret to the Norfolk, it took us\neleven. And I was seasick ten-and-a-half of those 11 days. It literally -- the waves were\n60 to a hundred feet high. I mean, you'd look up, and the ship was down here, and all\nyou saw was water way up there. But we did get to Norfolk safely, and then we were\ndischarged, and I used the GI bill to pick up a civilian life, and it was a typical young\nman ina hurry. I used the GI bill to get three degrees, and I -- including a master's and a\ndoctorate, a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1950. So -- and then I went into\ncommunity college work, and became the founding president of three community\ncolleges in the country. So I had a whole professional career. But then 1976 -- oh, I had -\n- when I got my Ph.D. in '50, Korea was breaking out, and in '52 it looked like Korea was\ngoing to become World War III, and I could see myself going back into service as a tank\ncrewman, PFC type. And so with a hot Ph.D. in my pocket, I went to various services to\nsee if I could get a direct commission. I went to the Army, and they said, We'd make you\na second lieutenant in the quartermaster corps. I went to the Navy, and they said, we\nhave no use for Ph.D.s. Went to the Army -- or the Air Force rather, and they said, We'd\nmake you a first lieutenant as a human resources research specialist. I figured, with a title\nlike that, 1t would take me -- well, it took me about 20 seconds to accept the Reserve\ncommission with the Air Force, and I stayed active in the Air Force Reserves. And in '76\nwent back in active duty with the Air Force at the Pentagon. I was a full colonel at this\npoint, and became the director of post-secretary education for the Secretary of Defense,\nand helped with the establishment -- or rather with the degree granting authority that the\ncommunity college of the Air Force had. So I was still in the community college work.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I wasn't part of that group. I had gone back, as I said, five years ago. That would\nhave been '85, maybe '86. Most of my reactions are from the film that Ray Bush had\ntaken.",
        "A: Well, Ray was with the '56 engineers, and he had a small eight-millimeter camerA:\nAnd we were all told not to have that, cameras or keep diaries or take pictures of\nanything, but that didn't stop most of us. And he was taking pictures of combat from\nEngland right in through the Bulge on to Mauthausen. And he would send those home.\nSome of them were x-rayed, unfortunately, but he put them all together in this -- two\nreels of film, and he showed them to us at the division reunion. And the offhand, if I\nwanted a copy of it, he'd be glad to do it, and I took him up on it. I had a copy made, or\nhe had copy made, I paid for it, but whatever, and it was fortunate I did, because his copy\nwas destroyed when a fire went through his home. So mine was the only surviving copy,\nand that's why I thought, rather than take a chance on it, because it is rather historic\nevidence that the Holocaust Museum should be -- would be the place to deposit it.",
        "A: It took as day-to-day activities would provide. And I know one section of the film,\nthere was a section of the 22nd Tank Battalion moving, and I think he got my picture, but\nI was all buttoned up inside the tank. He got a picture of my tank anyhow.",
        "A: Yes. It was showing them in the barracks in various stages of emaciation. It showed\nthem unloading the dead in wagons, showed them placing them in the mass graves,\nshowed them covering the graves, and even took a view from the concentration camp\nover to the countryside where you could see the Danube River.",
        "A: Yes. We were fighting the Nazis. We were soldiers fighting soldiers. We didn't \u2014\nnothing prepared us for this. Nobody told us that there were concentration camps. I don't\nthink anybody knew. We didn't expect anything when we overran Mauthausen. It just\nsort of reinforced the -- our feeling that we were fighting a just war, that whatever\nhappened, it was right that we should be in the war, that we were the good guys, white\nhats, even though there are times during combat when we weren't nice guys, but combat\nis like that, you fight to survive.",
