        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But I have -- I had a brother. He died in the meantime. He was nearly four years\nolder than me, and he was born in Russia.",
        "Q: Did you know him?",

        "A: I don't know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don't know. I think my father, maybe he was -- maybe. I don't know.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: I-- with my mother I met when I was nearly 18 years old. I did not have a\nrelationship with her before.",
        "Q: Well, explain this to us. How did it happen?",
        "A: My parents divorced after I was born when my father did not believe that I was his\ndaughter, and -- but then I -- they put me with a couple they paid monthly to raise me,\nand I was by then nearly one-and-a-half years, and my mother was a picaflor. (Laughing. )",
        "Q: What does that mean? What does that mean?",
        "A: He liked all the flowers, men flowers.",
        "Q: Isee. I see.",
        "A: And so he -- he could not believe that I was his daughter, but when I grow a little bit\nolder, I was the one what looked more like him. I had the same nose.",
        "Q: Oh. So that's how they -- you know, in those days they didn't have DNA testing.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And my father always said he had a Catholic nose, and I am born with a Catholic\nnose like he had. So my -- they divorced, and my mother disappeared. I think she went to\nBrazil. She lived in Brazil then. And years later, my father had -- she had a son, no, my\nbrother, and one day when the -- he went out, and he saw his son looking between\ngarbage; said, \"What you are looking?\" He said he is hungry. \"You are hungry. Where is\nyour mother?\" \"At home.\" \"And why you are here?\" \"She sent me out.\" And then my\nfather went to the judge and said, \"I like to have the right of my children.\" So my mother\n-- they took her right away as mother to take care of the children, and he raised me and\nhis -- my brother.",
        "Q: That sounds like a very sad beginning.",
        "A: Yeah. I never had a mother.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: And I think I can tell you I am grateful to her that she sent me the documents that I\ncould come out from Germany, but she was a person that is very hard to believe.",
        "Q: Itis. Itis. Tell me this, was your father -- were you close to your father as you were\ngrowing up?",
        "A: Oh, my father loved his children.",
        "Q: Okay. And what are some of your earliest memories?",
        "A: My earliest memory? I had varied caretakers, what my father took for the half of his\nhouse and for to raise his children. We spoke only German at home. I didn't learn\nanother language. And some of them I liked much, but some not so. We had some of\nthem that teach me from Jesus Christos. I think they wanted to convert me when I was\nfive years old.",
        "Q: So you would have -- you would have caretakers who wanted to -- who wanted to\nsave your soul, in other words?",
        "A: Yeah. (Laughing.) It is funny. And \u2014 but we are not religious at home.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. That was my next question. So your father didn't go to synagogue much?",
        "A: I don't know. I don't know. Maybe when he came to Germany and we lived on the\nstrasse, and the ones near synagogue that he went by my brother, he took him to\nthe synagogue, and I remember I must have been three or four years old, and my brother\nwent to the synagogue, and they called him to the Torah \u2014 you know what is the Torah?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Explain.",
        "A: And then I cried I like to go also, so they took me. And when they called my brother\nto the Torah, I said, \"I like to go, too,\" so next time they put me pants on that I looked\nlike a little boy.",
        "Q: Really. Did your father have any of his own family in Berlin?",
        "A: No. He had a cousin -- an uncle, yeah. It was a brother from his father.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And -- but not a relationship because my father came to Germany, maybe he didn't\nspeak German then and they made fun of him.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. So he was -- I mean, he was actually quite alone in raising you and your\nbrother? There wasn't any large -- you know, extended family to help?",
        "A: No. But, you know, neighbors, children from neighbors that were my age. And then\nmy father, he had a store, a men's store, and he had a partner, and they lived near us, and\nthey had three children, and the lady of the house, she always say about me, \"She is sweet\nlike sugar, but she is bitter like galla(ph).\"",

        "A: Yeah. But her daughter what was more or less my age, maybe a year older, was not -\n- was a little bit handicapped --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- mentally.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. So she was sad that --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But they divided. The partner moved out to another place, and then he went to\nFrance. And funny thing, when we are in Montevideo, was it, or Buenos Aires -- I think\nin Buenos Aires.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. When you were there, yeah?",
        "A: Yeah, we had a young man what lived in the neighborhood, one day he came to me,\n\"Jutta, you know the lady what knows you when you was a child?\" I said, \"Oh.\" And,\n\"Yes, .\" \"Ahh,\" I say, \"yeah, I remember the name.\" So I went and she was in\nBuenos Aires, they lived in Buenos Aires, and her older daughter died in France. She\nwas older.",
        "Q: The one who was handicapped?",
        "A: That was handicapped? Oh, she find a guy what married her.",
        "Q: Oh. Oh.",
        "A: And she was not very good -- good looking, and she -- and I went to the wedding.",
        "Q: Oh, did you?",
        "A: With my mother's husband.",
        "Q: But -- so who was the lady who had helped raise you who ended up in Buenos Aires,\nwhat was her name?",
        "A: What raised me? I had several that raise us. I had one that is my half-sister, my\nfather had a daughter with her; her name was Johanna.",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "A: Johanna Sashovec(ph). But she -- he had a daughter that I'm still -- I met the\ndaughter more or less -- Werner, + when they came to us? Maybe 28, no, 27,\nand I know about her, and when I was a child -- she is six years younger than me. When\nI was a child, she said, \"Jutta, what you like, a brother or a sister?\" So I did not\nunderstand much, but then it came to me.",
        "Q: Isee. So there was -- there was a lady who came into your father's life?",
        "A: Yeah. And she took -- I have -- no, I have not a photo from her, I think. And she put\nme \u2014 when I was six years old, she put me to school, and she bought me the big -- what\nyou have when you go to school, how do you say, the sac d'\u00e9tude.",
        "Q: Oh, yeah, sort of like a little backpack?",
        "A: Yeah. I had a big one when you see the photo. She took care of me, but since my\nfather didn't like to marry her, her mother came and took her back to \u2014 from where they\ncame, Senftenberg.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So your father didn't remarry ever?",

And one day she asked me, \"Jutta, what you do with the\nmoney?\" I said, \"I save it.\" \"Oh, where do you save it?\" With my -- with the sister for\nmy stepmother. And later, much later, when I already was married and far away, she --\nwhen I spoke -- she called -- no, I called her, and she said, \"You made money with her,\nand you give it to my sister, not to me.\" People are strange.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "A: Yeah, I had a lot of friends, older, younger, yeah. We were mixed, all mixed. But\nthen afterward that Hitler came and took the Jews, we were more together than the other\nones. I had -- in the building where we lived, above us lived a family. I don't know, I\nnever saw the father, so maybe from divorce or she didn't have a father, and she -- they\nalways invited me, and she played with me, and her grandmother was very nice, \"Jutta,\ncome up, come up.\" And then after Hitler, she from the window told, \"Oh, Jews. Oh,\nJews.\" So I felt a little bit put by side.",

        "A: My father was an atheo. He didn't believe in nothing.",
        "Q: Isee. But for a small child, such things are both painful and confusing.",

        "Q: Isee. Your father you said at one point -- your father had this business -- the store\ntogether with somebody else, but then that person left?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, they divided, and the other, he opened up a store, the same store a few\nblocks away, but must be that he didn't go away with him, they left Germany and went to\nFrance. His wife had family in France. And then after years I met her again in Buenos\nAires, and they told me that they came to South America, and the older daughter died.",
        "Q: Isee. The one who had been handicapped?",
        "A: No, this was a second one. She was more or less my age. The older daughter was\nthree years older than me, three or four years.",

        "A: No, in '38 to -- when was the Christmas \u2014 the glass?",
        "Q: Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Kristallnacht. People came to ?streiten lang? and cried against the Jews, \"Oh, that's a\nJewish store.\" But there were some between those people that said, \"No, come, come,\ncome, +,\" so it was not destroyed.",
        "Q: Isee. That's unusual.",
        "A: Yeah. But after, my father didn't open up again.",
        "Q: Isee. So he was able to maintain the store until Kristallnacht, and after that no?",
        "A: No, he closed it. No, they didn't destroy it.",
        "Q: Okay. But here is my question. Between 1933 and 1938, was it harder for him to\nmake a living?",
        "A: No. It was okay.",
        "Q: It was okay?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. How come he was in hiding?",
        "A: Why -- it came a time where they went and looked for Jewish men to take them to\nSachsenhausen, and a lot of -- a lot of what he met disappeared in Sachsenhausen, so he\ndisappeared, too, but not at Sachsenhausen. He went underground.",
        "Q: How long did he stay away\u201d?",
        "A: Okay. When he was crossing the to \u2014 I think to Bergen somewhere, they\ncatched him and they sent him back to Berlin, and then he had to go every week to the\npolice that he was there.",
        "Q: So he had to register with the police --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- every week?",
        "A: But after -- I don't know how long it took, a few months maybe, he didn't need to go\nanymore, but then before the war -- maybe four or five months before the war he\ndisappeared again, but the store was closed. He didn't open it up after Kristallnacht, so \u2014",
        "Q: So how did you eat? How did you live?",
        "A: Okay. He made it -- he made the business without a store.",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "A: Yeah. He bought and sold to other stores.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So he became more like a wholesaler --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- rather than to -- direct to customers?",
        "A: Yeah. And we had a lot of -- my father had friends what was not Jewish, and one of\nthem said, \"Abraham, why you don't convert? I spoke with the vater.\"",
        "Q: \"I spoke with the priest\"?",
        "A: Yeah, it was a priest, but my father was not interested. He didn't believe in one; how\nhe would believe in another one.",
        "Q: Well, yeah, that is logical. That makes sense.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did his manner change? Did he -- did the pressure show on him of all these things\nthat were going on?",
        "A: Maybe. Maybe.",
        "Q: Did you see this change at home?",
        "A: Okay. Since he had not a wife at home, he liked to go out and play cards.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Inthe cafe, cafe Moka Eftiin __..",
        "Q: Uh-huh. That's before he married your stepmother?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. And then --",
        "A: My stepmother, and then she organized it to play the cards at home, then so her\nfather came and somebody else from her came, and my father learned Schach. Schach.",
        "Q: Oh, Chess?",
        "A: Yeah. So they played Chess. And then when they married, they came -- always\ncame the relatives from her for dinner. I thinks it better in our house or looked to save\nmoney. And they sent me out to buy in the feinkost.",
        "Q: Inthe good food, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And bring this, and bring this. And this was after hours, maybe it was 7:30,\n8:00. And then when Hitler was there, they always go, \"Oh, Hitler, we will have each\none a car for free, the auto.\"",
        "Q: Really.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That's what people would be saying in the streets?",
        "A: Yeah, when the Germans were winning the war.",
        "Q: Were you -- when you were a teenage girl in the 1930s, like a young teenage girl,\nwere you frightened to go out on the streets after Hitler came to power?",
        "A: No, I was not one what like to go out if its dark.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: +, but I -- I was not an unafraid adventurer.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did --",
        "A: Iwas ahouse girl. I liked to read.",
        "Q: Well, it also sounds that as if -- did you feel somewhat abandoned; that is, when your\nstepmother came on the scene, did your father's attention --",
        "A: No, she was jealous of my brother, and \u2014 and for me, she looked that she has\nsomebody what helps with the housekeeping. Even you know what I didn't like, she had\na very nice mother, no, and the mother came every day to us, and she let her wash the\ndishes and all this. I think it was terrible. And all for food? So I don't know if the\npeople had money.",
        "Q: I don't understand. Can you repeat this. Her mother would come every single day?",
        "A: Yeah, every single day to help her and to wash and to iron, and she was madam.",
        "Q: Isee. I see. So she got other people to do those household chores?",
        "A: Yeah, what -- when she found something, yeah.",
        "Q: When -- when Krystallnacht came around, you were already about 15 years old?",
        "A: Yeah, I was working. I was a kaufmannischer lehrling in a big store, in household\nappliances. Nota store. It was for major --",
        "Q: It was wholesale is that?",

And then was Krystallnacht, and after this the --\nthe boss came to me and said, \"Jutta, my wife works in the -- to help young people who\nwent and moved to London for education, and so she would take care of you.\" And I said\nto my father, \"Papa, they will take care of me and I can go to London and learn English\nand this and that.\" \"No. How would you go to England?\" He didn't allow it.",
        "Q: Oh. Oh. So they -- they had offered you a way of leaving?",
        "A: Okay. And so I lost my job in this office. And in the same building was a woman,\nshe was sewing, no, ,",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And I went up to her, and I liked to sew, so she said, \"Okay, you can come. I will\nteach you and learn and you can help me.\" And I went, and I was there five, six months,\nthen she got from the arbeit office --",
        "Q: From the labor office, yeah.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You knew not to.",
        "A: Yeah, \"has horns.\" (Laughing.) Say how I know who is Jews. Most of the people\ntook me for I don't know. When we were married, they took me for Italian.",
        "Q: Did you have many such incidents -- did you have -- were there many such sorts of\nexchanges that you would hear in the late thirties?",

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And what I feel bad, when I left Germany, he took one of my luggage to the train\nstation, and the mother, the sister for my stepmother, she was even more than the\nstepmother, she was later very happy when I left, and he was Jewish. He was raised by\nhis mother, but the parents were divorced, and he took the bicycle and left Berlin, and\nthen the mother was so preoccupied that they were looking for him, and they brought him\nhome again, and I'm sorry I think maybe he perished.",
        "Q: So did he leave because he was so unhappy that you were leaving?",
        "A: No, no. He was -- this was already 1940.",
        "Q: Isee.",

        "A: No, he was killed in the concentration camp.",
        "Q: What -- do you know anything about the details?",

You don't know your mother.\nYou don't know what person she is.\" So I never answered the letter. But then when I\nfound this letter, I saw the address, and I wrote her a letter if she still 1s interested in me,\nif she can sponsor me.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And she sent me the paper for Uruguay. And I didn't know how she looked, and\nWerner was on the ship, and he saw a lady call, \"Is Jutta Popower on the ship?\" And then\nhe came to me, \"Jutta, I think the lady what is calling is your mother.\" It was true.",
        "Q: What happened to your brother? When he left at age 18 because your stepmother\nwas criticizing him all the time, where did he go? What did he do?",

He went to\nBelgium, and in Belgium he entered into -- did something from +, this was a\nJewish school to teach -- he learned in like an engineer plan, things like this, for two\nyears, and then was from Dunkirk that the English took all the people out while the\nGermans started the war. It is before the war. So he came to this --",
        "Q: Oh, so you're talking about Dunkirk?",
        "A: Yeah. He came to England, and then he came to England, they deported him to live\non the Island of Man. Did you hear of that one?",

        "Q: That's right. That's right. There makes the difference.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And that's why he could go into the English Army. Because a lot of German Jewish\nrefugees ended up being, well, quarantined, imprisoned not 1n bad prisons, but,\nnevertheless, treated like enemy aliens.",
        "A: Don't tell me.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I remember he wrote me, he had to make a testament and say something\nhappened to him, no, he put me in in his testament and I get the money. I'm glad nothing\nhappened to him.",

When he married her, after a while he found out she\nwas ten years older than him.",
        "Q: Really.",
        "A: This was -- then he didn't like it as much. She should have never told him her age.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And he liked to go away on trips for a month or so, and then he would say -- then he\nsaid, \"Yeah, I'm going to visit my sister,\" and this was not true. He never came to visit me\nin Argentina. And when I came to Israel and I met her, she hated me. And she -- when\nwe lived in Argentina, she wrote to my father-in-law that her husband give all the money\nwhat he has to me, and this is no. He lied to her, so she hated me.",
        "Q: Such complex human relations sometimes, you know.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And such painful ones.",
        "A: Werner went with my brother in Israel, I don't know if looking for a job or -- and\nwhen Werner went and bought something to eat, he gave him, no; and when he bought\nsomething, he hided it not to give up. He was like my mother.",

        "A: I didn't know where to go. By accident only that the book fell down and came out\nwith the letter in with that my mother had sent me in '38.",
        "Q: Isee. So it was a complete accident?",
        "A: Yeah. And she was not living no more at the address, but the people what received\nthe letter know where she was living, so they went over and gave her the letter.",
        "Q: And what were you doing -- what kind of work were you doing by the time you left?",
        "A: That I left?",

        "A: Yeah. But the people that oversaw us and teached us were very nice over there, very\nnice. And then in December, I told what was the manager of all of us that I was leaving,\nthat I was going to South America, and he said, \"Why you are leaving? The war will be\nfinished soon.\" He didn't know about concentration camp and all this.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The Jews know all over this a lot of parents from people that never came out from\nSachsenhausen.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. That's true. That's true. So \u2014 but everybody -- you say the majority of the\nworkers in Siemens were Jewish?",
        "A: No. The workers, yeah.",
        "Q: The workers.",
        "A: But not the people what oversaw us.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And --",

        "Q: And did that work out?",
        "A: This I have so, and if this was not, I had money. I needed money when I would go.\nMy stepmother wouldn't give me money for a taxi or to Hamburg for a visa or so.",

        "Q: Oh, dear.",
        "A: And what are they kept there? With lice. And so she said, \"Jutta, you are dirty. You\nhave lice.\" And then I took the children to the park, and we were sitting on the bench, and\nwe came home, she had lice, too.",
        "Q: You didn't have much choices there, did you?",
        "A: Yeah. I couldn't go with the two children. I was a child myself, and that's a busy\nstreet with cars and and all the -- aye yal.",

I needed the money.\" \"Okay.\" I never saw her. When I was in Berlin and called\nup, she didn't like to see me. I think she was afraid.",
        "Q: So she stayed and survived the war?",
        "A: No, she was not Jewish. She only found out that after --",
        "Q: So even if she converted, it didn't matter?",

        "Q: Itis. Itis. Tell me this, was your father -- were you close to your father as you were\ngrowing up?",
        "Q: Okay. And what are some of your earliest memories?",
        "Q: So you would have -- you would have caretakers who wanted to -- who wanted to\nsave your soul, in other words?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. That was my next question. So your father didn't go to synagogue much?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Explain.",
        "Q: Really. Did your father have any of his own family in Berlin?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. So he was -- I mean, he was actually quite alone in raising you and your\nbrother? There wasn't any large -- you know, extended family to help?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. So she was sad that --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. When you were there, yeah?",
        "Q: The one who was handicapped?",
        "Q: Oh. Oh.",
        "Q: Oh, did you?",
        "Q: But -- so who was the lady who had helped raise you who ended up in Buenos Aires,\nwhat was her name?",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "Q: Isee. So there was -- there was a lady who came into your father's life?",
        "Q: Oh, yeah, sort of like a little backpack?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So your father didn't remarry ever?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: We will talk about that. Right now I want to talk a little bit more about your\nchildhood and \u2014 what part of Berlin were you living in?",
        "Q: N4, in other words?",
        "Q: So it sound like to was sort of in the middle of Berlin?",
        "Q: What did the neighborhood look like?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Was it a working class neighborhood?",
        "Q: Okay. Did you live in an apartment building?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Behind the store?",
        "Q: And this is the store that he had a partner with at one point?",
        "Q: Okay. And was your father a tailor? When you say he had a men's store --",
        "Q: Okay. So, I mean, he was a -- he was a store -- okay --",
        "Q: A storekeeper. So it was all men's goods?",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. Did he make a decent living?",
        "Q: Did -- did you have anybody -- I mean, did you have a cook at home, too, to help\nprepare the meals?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. How would you characterize your childhood?",
        "Q: You mean --",
        "Q: Would you say that you were a happy child or not?",
        "Q: Did you feel the lack of having a mother?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: What did she look like to you, do you remember?",
        "Q: And how --",
        "Q: Oh. And is this before -- did she still live in Berlin?",
        "Q: Did she -- when she didn't live with you anymore, --",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "Q: How did you start school? Did you start school at age six or so?",
        "Q: Okay. What kind of memories do you have from school?",
        "Q: In my report card?",
        "Q: Ah, so you don't have good hearing, yeah. Did you -- what kind of personality was\nyour father? Tell me a little bit about him?",
        "Q: Yeah, of course.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: And did he spend time with you when he could?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So when he went to the cinema, you wanted to go as well?",
        "Q: And he had to then tell you what was going on?",
        "Q: Yeah. Were you close with your brother?",
        "Q: Isee. Isee. Did that change at some point? When children are small --",
        "Q: What did he do?",
        "Q: He defended you, your brother did?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Soin some ways your stepmother -- do you think it was a little bit like Cinderella,\nAshenputtel?",
        "Q: Was your stepmother German, did you say, or Jewish?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were you ever close to her or not?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well, tell -- well, that sort of begs the question of couldn't your father help pay for\nthese expenses?",
        "Q: Isee. So we will come to that part. Let's -- let's talk a little bit about again school life\nand -- and your neighborhood in Berlin.",
        "Q: Ofcourse. Of course.",
        "Q: He was atheist, you say?",
        "Q: Isee. But for a small child, such things are both painful and confusing.",
        "Q: So your parents; that is, your father and your stepmother, tried to find other\nplaymates for you and other activities for you?",
        "Q: Oh, you did.",
        "Q: Okay. How did your neighborhood change by the 19 --",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "Q: And that was what year?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And what was her name?",
        "Q: Elna(ph) Shilla(ph)?",
        "Q: And you said that you had a half-sister --",
        "Q: From the other lady?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: And she lived -- did she grow up with her mother?",
        "Q: And did they live far from you?",
        "Q: Senftenberg?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Was -- was -- was her mother Jewish?",
        "Q: Also not. And you --",
        "Q: Pardon?",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: That's to -- to your half-sister's mother?",
        "Q: You said you would say -- you would call your half-sister's mother \"tante,\" yes?",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "Q: No, no, no, but what was her name, her full name?",
        "Q: Sashovec. Johanna Sashovec.",
        "Q: Isee. Your father you said at one point -- your father had this business -- the store\ntogether with somebody else, but then that person left?",
        "Q: Isee. The one who had been handicapped?",
        "Q: Did your father have business difficulties after 1933, after Hitler comes to power?",
        "Q: Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: Isee. That's unusual.",
        "Q: Isee. So he was able to maintain the store until Kristallnacht, and after that no?",
        "Q: Okay. But here is my question. Between 1933 and 1938, was it harder for him to\nmake a living?",
        "Q: It was okay?",
        "Q: Yeah. How come he was in hiding?",
        "Q: How long did he stay away\u201d?",
        "Q: So he had to register with the police --",
        "Q: -- every week?",
        "Q: So how did you eat? How did you live?",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So he became more like a wholesaler --",
        "Q: -- rather than to -- direct to customers?",
        "Q: \"I spoke with the priest\"?",
        "Q: Well, yeah, that is logical. That makes sense.",
        "Q: Did his manner change? Did he -- did the pressure show on him of all these things\nthat were going on?",
        "Q: Did you see this change at home?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. That's before he married your stepmother?",
        "Q: Okay. And then --",
        "Q: Oh, Chess?",
        "Q: Inthe good food, yeah.",
        "Q: Really.",
        "Q: That's what people would be saying in the streets?",
        "Q: Were you -- when you were a teenage girl in the 1930s, like a young teenage girl,\nwere you frightened to go out on the streets after Hitler came to power?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did --",
        "Q: Well, it also sounds that as if -- did you feel somewhat abandoned; that is, when your\nstepmother came on the scene, did your father's attention --",
        "Q: I don't understand. Can you repeat this. Her mother would come every single day?",
        "Q: Isee. I see. So she got other people to do those household chores?",
        "Q: When -- when Krystallnacht came around, you were already about 15 years old?",
        "Q: It was wholesale is that?",
        "Q: Oh. Oh. So they -- they had offered you a way of leaving?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: From the labor office, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: So she didn't know you were Jewish?",
        "Q: Even at that age, you know, you knew?",
        "Q: You knew not to.",
        "Q: Did you have many such incidents -- did you have -- were there many such sorts of\nexchanges that you would hear in the late thirties?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So did he leave because he was so unhappy that you were leaving?",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "Q: Oh. When did your father start thinking of leaving?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Tell me what happened?",
        "Q: He went underground?",
        "Q: And he was one of them?",
        "Q: You found out after the war?",
        "Q: What -- do you know anything about the details?",
        "Q: That he had been shipped off to a concentration camp?",
        "Q: So when -- after he left in Kristallnacht, did he ever come back?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: That's right, to register.",
        "Q: And then at some point -- when did he go underground?",
        "Q: So that would have been 1939, April something?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: What happened to your brother? When he left at age 18 because your stepmother\nwas criticizing him all the time, where did he go? What did he do?",
        "Q: Your brother.",
        "Q: Yeah. What was his --",
        "Q: How did he get there from Germany\u2019?",
        "Q: Oh, so you're talking about Dunkirk?",
        "Q: Yes, I've heard of that.",
        "Q: So was he a prisoner there?",
        "Q: Well, this is -- it is simply -- I've heard of other German Jewish refugees coming to\nEngland --",
        "Q: Pardon?",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "Q: That's right. That's right. There makes the difference.",
        "Q: And that's why he could go into the English Army. Because a lot of German Jewish\nrefugees ended up being, well, quarantined, imprisoned not 1n bad prisons, but,\nnevertheless, treated like enemy aliens.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So when did you next see him?",
        "Q: Really.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Such complex human relations sometimes, you know.",
        "Q: And such painful ones.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "Q: Itis disappointing.",
        "Q: So your mother -- you know, your mother is in Uruguay and sends you these --",
        "Q: She sends you the papers --",
        "Q: And how -- how is it that between the time your father went underground and ended\nup in France, your brother is gone, how 1s it that you stayed so late in Germany\u2019?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Isee. So it was a complete accident?",
        "Q: And what were you doing -- what kind of work were you doing by the time you left?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. In Berlin.",
        "Q: You were soldering?",
        "Q: Yeah, that's right, it 1s called soldering.",
        "Q: And so it was metal bits that you were soldering together?",
        "Q: For the war. So it was military?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. That's true. That's true. So \u2014 but everybody -- you say the majority of the\nworkers in Siemens were Jewish?",
        "Q: The workers.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And --",
        "Q: And did that work out?",
        "Q: So -- but your -- her sister --",
        "Q: -- was holding your money for you?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "Q: Yeah. What happened to the twins? You say she had twins?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Wasn't sick themselves?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: And the other one, did she get better?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Oh, dear.",
        "Q: You didn't have much choices there, did you?",
        "Q: In 19 --",
        "Q: So didn't seem to have much understanding?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So she stayed and survived the war?",
        "Q: So even if she converted, it didn't matter?",
        "Q: When did you stop living at home with her?",
        "Q: When did you stop living at home with her?",
        "Q: Okay. So the war has already started?",
        "Q: Do you remember what Berlin was like?",
        "Q: And did I understand correctly that \u2014 that this train was sealed; that is, were you able\nto get on and off of it or not?",
        "Q: In the bath?",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: Well, that shows just how tired and exhausted you were.",
        "Q: Were you able to get off of the train in Paris?",
        "Q: And so that's why you never saw him again?",
        "Q: So your mother in Uruguay\u201d?",
        "Q: Yeah. So you get on the boat by yourself, is that right, in Lisbon?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And what was your first impression of him?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Still are.",
        "Q: And we will take some pictures later, we will film some of the pictures --",
        "Q: We will film some of the photos that you have --",
        "Q: -- and that proves it. So what \u2014 what happened when you got to Uruguay and you\nmeet your mother again after so many years?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So that was hard to take?",
        "Q: So it wasn't easy?",
        "Q: And one of them took her to Uruguay?",
        "Q: Hungarian.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: As the first one?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. To the second wedding?",
        "Q: Yeah. And did you stay in Uruguay?",
        "Q: No, you. After you arrived in --",
        "Q: No, no. I want to find out how -- did you get to Argentina in some way\u201d?",
        "Q: Tell me about that?",
        "Q: The Hungarian one?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: I didn't understand that part. You said you told him you were going to Israel, and\nwhat did he say?",
        "Q: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Difficult.",
        "Q: Not only difficult, very --",
        "Q: Very hard.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Well, yeah.",
        "Q: It sounds like you had a lot of disappointments.",
        "Q: Well, that's the way somebody can survive, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So was the first time you went back to Germany when you went with your husband?",
        "Q: And what kind of a feeling did that leave with you?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: You mean, the people that you would take on tour?",
        "Q: And you -- you had to tell them that you are Jewish?",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "Q: Oh. That's kind of cold and brusque.",
        "Q: Did you visit back to where your street was, where you had grown up?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: I think I was with Werner.\nWERNER PREUSS: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. Have -- well, I guess I'm at the point where -- are there -- is there anything\nthat we haven't talked about that is important to add to your story? Is there anything that\nwe have not talked about that -- that you think is important to add to your story?",
        "Q: I don't think so. It sounds like it was quite a challenge.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Or angry all the time?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well --",

        "Q: To Henry Power. And do you remember when this was taken? You must have been\nlike four or five years old?",
        "Q: Three years. So it would have been 1924 or '25 or something?",
        "Q: Isee. I see. So it was your father with his two children?",
        "Q: Very young man.",

        "Q: All right. So what is this photo?\nWERNER PREUSS: This picture was taken in 1939 in a working camp in Germany. It\nwas not a camp really. It was a farmer's town where all what you see you there, we had\nto work for the local farmers.",
        "Q: And this is outside Berlin?\nWERNER PREUSS: Yeah, this was near Berlin, but I don't remember the name of the\nvillage. This was a village. Most ofthem were _ +, big --",
