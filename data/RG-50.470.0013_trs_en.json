So\nthis is how the day started, and it really, and eh the only\ncontact with the outside world was through the window. And\nwhen we see through the window a strange strange thing\nhappening. Because all of a sudden there appeared a German\nGestapo's with canes aS am aS ae guard. And they were\nstationed all around on all corners around this area. And,\neh but there were no SS, eh guard of any kind. There were\nnothing in the area, usually, for many days there was always\na eh British airplane hanging about the camp.

And it lasted about\nseven hours, terrifying fighting and the all the walls were\nwere Shaking and of course we immediately thought that\nprobably this is it. You know that the Americans are coming\nbecause we Know eh that the Americans are marching toward\nDachau. We knew this even eh already when we were march ma\nmarching from emb brook, that they were coming.\nEm the fighting eh lasted about seven hours and then it\nstopped. And nothing happened again. And it took about\nanother twenty minutes before we heard a individual shot ba\nba hear and there from all direction and then I look in the\nwindow and I see there are a lot of people running towards\nthe fences, prisoners from other block which was not in the\nQuarantine. And I see that some of them are caring guns!\nRiffles already, you know. So we eh eh broke through the\nwindow outside be because door was still locked you know,\nand we started running toward the fences and we see that\nthis area was completely already demolished.

He was\nwalking..beginning to cry...and eh eh behind him were eh eh\neh other eh eh soldiers and he were commanding the guards\nthat were on the Dachau, Germans, to step, to descend and to\nsurrender.

And here I saw eh\neh another row of eh eh eh defense and eh eh behind right\nbehind the fense there were already about fifty Prisoners of\nWar; Germans, officers and men, sitting in the ditch. And I\nSaw the phony little jeeps, you know, cruising here and\nthere, you know, and for years for many eh years we\nalways discussed eventual liberation. How this will happen.\nInhale...and we always wished that there would be an\nAmericans who would liberate us and .....inhale....in those",

        "at Dachau. And Poles, and Russians, and Czechs, Italians,\nand French. And when I took a walk around the main street,\nI saw many blocks decorated. It took probably a minute, you\nknow, all the decoration must must have been waiting in\nstorage somewhere...inhale...eh in secret. It was\ndrizzling, rain drizzling when during that eh eh hour of\nliberation, but half the time went by and it cleared-up.\nAnd eh sun began to set down and there was a glorious eh eh\nsun-setting but there there were also a very dark clouds on\nthe East.
