        "INTERVIEW WITH MONIQUE GOODRICH",
        "April 2, 1992",
        "BROOKLINE, MASSACHUSETTS\nThe date is April 2, 1992 and we are speaking with Monique Goodrich in Brookline, Massachusetts.\nMs. Goodrich, could you tell us your name at the time of the war, your date of birth, your place of\nbirth and anything you possibly can about your family background and your childhood?\nI was known as Monique Jackson. I was born in Paris, France. I was born in October 29, 1937.\nMy parents-- my father's name was Charles, he was born in Russia, in Vesitosk (ph) (c.10); my\nmother was born in Poland. They both emigrated to France when they were young. My father did\nsome studies. They were both orphans of the first World War.\nSo they met in France?\nThey met in France, yes. They were pretty young when I was born, | I guess. My mother was\ntwenty years old when I was born. My mother never really had a good family. She was raised, I\nguess, by her sister. Jeannette, who is dead now, told me that she is the one who took her out of the\norphanage because her parents died during the war. I think typhoid. So my mother never knew her\nparents and she was raised by her grandmother, by her sisters; she was shunted back and forth.\nAll in Poland?\nIn Poland and in Paris. My father was more or less the same. He came from a large family and he\nhas more recollection of his parents but he was also orphaned during the war and didn't know his\nparents. No, he knew them a little bit, he knew more his oldest sister, I think he knew. Her name\nwas Emma; I think she raised him. But he lost his whole family except for a brother that was left in\nthe United States. That's one of the reasons we did come to the United States, because his brother\nwas here, Sam.\nYou don't know anything about the religious background of the family or anything, do you?",
        "The religion? My father certainly was well-versed in religion. He knew the prayers, there must\nhave been some orthodox. But he didn't practice. He gave up the religion, certainly. I don't know\nif it was before the war or during the war but I think he gave up all religion.\nWhen he was in Paris, you said he was studying.\nHe did study some engineering, I think he did, for a while, but then he ran out of money and he had\nto go to work. He told us lots of stories of how--I guess there were a group of them--they used to\nrun out of money and how they used to try and get the baker to give them some money and how\nthey would take the herring and split it so they could have something to eat. Lots of stories like that.\nDo you know anything about your parents' basic education. Did they go to public school system\nthere?\nMy mother went to public school. My poor father, he didn't know really, Russian. He studied in\nYiddish. I don't think he knew Hebrew but he studied in Yiddish. His mother tongue was Yiddish.\nHis mother tongue was Yiddish and he could write Yiddish. Everything else was very difficult.\nLanguages didn't come very easily to him so he came to France, had a hard time with French and\nwhen he became a little fluent in French, he went to Spain. He ended up in Spain during the war, in\na camp there. So when he became a little fluent in Spain, he came back to France. From France, we\ncame to this country. My poor father was always speaking in all kinds of different languages.\nI see. That's interesting. What can you tell me about your home? Do you remember? Were you\nextremely young?\nBefore the war, I do not remember anything because I was two years old when the war started. My\nearliest recollections are of the little town in the Pyrenees in the south of France in the Medi,\nNeichtauber called St. Laurent De Neste. This is where I spent quite a few years of the war. Those\nare my earliest recollections.\nSince you can't tell me first hand, can you tell me what happened and how you got there?\nIn 1939 when the Germans crossed over to France, the family started to go--they wanted to go to the\nfree zone of France. My mother--I forgot the exact story how it went--but she knew someone or\nsomebody told her to go down to the Pyrenees and I think the government helped the mothers and",
        "the children to escape. They escaped, they ended up in the Pyrenees with quite a few members--her\nsister was there with her family. There were about some twenty persons, I think, some Jewish\npeople who were in that particular town, in that little town, ended up in St. Laurent De Neste. I\ntalked to her last night, she mentioned that they were strafed when they were escaping and they\nended up in that small town. They took the train and they ended up--it was about maybe twenty or\nthirty miles from Towl (ph) (c.62) which is the biggest city.\nSo when you got there, did the individuals hide people or, what happened exactly?\nThe French, if you recall, had a corroborating government. Life was very difficult but the town\nitself was very helpful. My mother always tells the story how they used to make little baskets down\nthere. My mother says I used to go off into this little town and I would come back. Somebody\nwould give me a basket they would put eggs in there or milk and really keep my mother supplied.\nThey were extremely helpful; vegetables--.\nThere wasn't a huge shortage in these areas, or--?\nNot when I was with my mother. I don't remember being hungry, no. It seems that the town really\nhelped my mother and my father survive; the other people who were there also.\nDo you remember what it looked like?\nAbsolutely, yes.\nGive me any possible descriptions that you have and be as specific as you like.\nThe town was a beautiful little town. I remember it; it was imbedded in my mind. I could never\nforget it. As a matter of fact when we went back there, about ten years ago, my husband and I, I\ntook him exactly to where it was. Because it was in the Pyrenees and because it was so close to the\nSpanish boarder, there was a sort of like a Spanish flair to it.\nDid they speak Basque there?",
        "Yes, some of the people spoke Basque. As a matter of fact, I spoke Basque, I learned a tongue\ndown there that was Basque--very Spanish. But I forgot it all, unfortunately. The reason I forget it\nall 1s because there's a definite southern accent to France. When we went back to Paris after the\nwar, I was really made fun of so I dropped it as quickly as I could. It was like all small towns\nwhether they be French or whether they be Spanish, they have what they call a plass (ph.)(c.88)\nwhich is the center of the town. There's usually the churches, the town hall, very similar almost to\nthe American town. From that plass radiates all the streets of the town. In the center of town, there\nwas also a building where the people used to put hay. I remember they used to stack hay there and\nwe used to play in there and have fun. The smell of hay was just incredible.\nYou played with just the regular kids?\nYes, as a matter of fact, Zhebair(ph) (c.92) was one of them and he is in one of those pictures there.\nI found them afterwards. We had a house that was a three story house, very primitive, actually. All\nthe houses were built; they were at least hundreds of years old with very, very thick walls. The\nmain room would be where there would a coal stove and then the bedrooms upstairs. That's where\nwe lived and on top of the house was a huge balcony. It wasn't as big as I remember because I was\na small girl and everything seemed big but from the top of the balcony, you could see the Pyrenees,\nthe mountains. It was very pretty, I used to play up there a lot.\nDid the people in the town--I assume they knew you were Jewish?\nI think so. As you will see, they knew that we were Jewish.\nYour brother wasn't born then?\nNo.\nSo you slept---?\nWell, as I begin to unfold the story, you will see what happens. We lived in this little town. It was\nin the free zone but it was not really that safe. We never really knew who was collaborating and if\nmy father would be denounced. After a while, the mayor, Mr. Couquebert, who had two daughters,\nhelped my mother. She was friendly with his wife. The whole family was friendly and he told her\nthat the day they would come for my father that he would let her know. He had to be very careful",
        "because again there was a collaborating government. As things began to be very difficult, there was\nin these old buildings, they had, since there was no refrigeration, they had like a closet, a very thick\ncloset where they would keep the goods. You know, the butter and the perishables and it would\nkeep them quite cool. My brother was born in '41 so this was about '42, '43 maybe, when it became-\n-my mother didn't want people to know that my father was in the house. He would stay in the house\nbut anytime anybody would come to the house, he would go into that little closet. They had put an\narmoire in front it and he would hide there. But my brother would call, \"Pa-pa, pa-pa\" back there,\nso it became very difficult for him to hide. Across the street, there was like a barn, nothing like a\nbarn that you would think of now, but like an old building where the animals would be kept. My\nfather very often would go there during the day or at night and hide there so he wouldn't be home.\nMy mother tells me that the Germans did come into the town one time. I was at my little friend's\nhouse. Her father had trucks which of course could not be used that time because they didn't have\ngasoline. We would play in the trucks and they had put some swings there and we'd swing. One\nday the Germans came in and they routed all the men. There were some that were Mackee\n(ph)(c.138), the Resistance. We were very scared. I was very, very scared at the time. They killed,\nthey rounded up and some of them tried to escape and they rounded up the ones who tried to escape,\nthey were shot. There was the father of the baker was shot dead and a few others were shot. They\nput all the men in this la plass (c.141) where I told you where there was a building where people\ncould get together. They let them go after a while.\nDid you have a sense--at this point did you understand anything that was going on, a sense of the\ndanger?\nThere was a sense of danger but I really didn't understand what was going on. As the hidden\nchildren understood, we knew instinctively that we couldn't call attention to ourselves, that we had\nto be very good and obey and do what we were told to do. Because after a while, my mother felt\nthat it was too dangerous. She talks about the brown Jews coming around and telling them to hide\nthe children, at least to save the children if they couldn't save themselves. So I ended up in a\nconvent for a while with the sisters. That was a very miserable time.\nHow old were you?\nI was four.\nDo you remember this?\nVery distantly, yes.",
        "Do you want to talk about it at all?\nYes, I can talk about it because I did go back and visit. Some of the horror was worked out. They\nhad an orphanage, they ran an orphanage there and so I was just a member of the children in the\norphanage. It was very, very regimented. You got up at a certain hour and you went in the chapel\nand prayed. You ate at a certain hour and you went to the bathroom at a certain hour and a four-\nyear-old child, it was very difficult besides being away from my parents.\nYou knew that they were still there?\nMy parents?\nYes. Or did you--?\nHard to say. Hard to say what I felt. I think what happened is that I sort of withdrew into myself.\nThe only thing that I remember vividly is having to go to the bathroom all the time and not being\nable to go and being very, very afraid at night. Again I would have to go to the bathroom and I was\nafraid to get up and go.\nI'm sorry we couldn't let you go when you got here.\nThat's okay. I was scared, I was always scared. I always knew that there was danger and I didn't\nknow what the danger was. Being away from my parents was also very--. You knew, instinctively\nthat there was danger because my father was hidden. I was shushed, I'm sure, all the time. There\nwas danger, it was imminent at all times and I didn't know why.\nDid the nuns know that you were Jewish?\nI don't know. I'd have to ask my mother if they knew. My mother says I didn't stay very long. To\nme, it seemed like a very long time. But when I back to visit them, to visit about ten years ago, that\nwas the last stop I made because that was the most painful one to do. That was really miserable.\nThey understood right away what had happened to me and they proceeding to give me flowers\nbecause they had changed the place totally. It was bright and it was cheerful where it had been stark",
        "and dark. There were flowers everywhere and so they proceeded to show me all the pictures that\nthey had; the children that were there.\nWere they the same people?\nNot the same sisters. They weren't the same sisters.\nBut they knew the legacy?\nRight, they did know. So from there, I was there by myself. As my brother got a little bit older, I\nthink my brother was about a year and a half old, according to my mother the brown Jews or\nsomebody came and said hide your children. They took us away and my parents weren't supposed\nto know where and it was the most horrible place on earth. There were two other children with us\nthat came from the town and I forgot to ask my mother what their names were. One of them was\nnamed Louie, who didn't survive. He finally ended up being deported anyway, and his brother. We\nwere at a town, the name I do not remember and my mother does not remember. We were\nabsolutely--we really didn't have enough food to eat there. It was the most horrible place; we were\nconstantly punished. I was punished for losing a barrette; I went without supper. It was really\npretty awful. My mother had a dream that we didn't have enough food and that we were not well\nand she woke up my father one night and she says we have got to go get the children. He says no\nwe shouldn't; she says if you don't come with me, I'll go by myself. So they went to Taub (ph)\n(c.196) to the Red Cross who had placed us. She insisted that they tell her where we were. They\nfinally did and she came and got us. I remember she was absolutely so upset when she saw us\nbecause we had gotten so thin and--.\nYou remember being at this place?\nYes.\nThis was a home, with people?\nIt was a home, yes, with people. It was a private home. It was not an institution or anything like\nthat. It was a private home. We went to school. I remember we had to walk quite a few miles to go\nto school.",
        "Was this your first experience 1n school?\nNo, because I had started in St. Laurent de Neste in kindergarten. Maybe, I'm messing up--I think\nwe were in school there, I'm not sure. I remember we used to dig for roots in the soil to see, to eat.\nWe used to go to people and ask for food, if I remember correctly. My mother tells me that the\npeople, when she finally got there to get us, that the neighbors came and told them how happy they\nwere that they came for us and got us out of there.\nWhat happened from that point?\nAfter that, I don't remember if it's this one or the one before--I went on a farm, Labastide it was\ncalled and I stayed there also for a few months. It was in the foothills of the Pyrenees on a farm.\nEven as miserable as I was, because how could I ever be happy being away from my parents, I\nknew that it was a beautiful place. I could remember walking out in the Spring and having just a\nfield of narcissuses as far as the eye could see. Because it was the foothills of Pyrenees, the roads\nwere very steep. Everybody would leave the bicycle at the farm and the only way you could go\ndown was to walk down to the town. The food was there, it was farm food, but the food was there.\nSo you weren't starving?\nNo, I wasn't starving but I was not happy.\nWere there other kids?\nThere was one girl. I found out when I went back: her name was Lahansel (ph)(c.220); she was\nadopted. She and I were pretty good friends. My job, since I was four, five years old, on the farm\nwas to keep the birds away from the chickens. They had these prey birds that would come down,\ncircle and circle and then come down and pick chicken. I would stay with a big stick and if I saw\nthem circling, I would start shouting and wave my stick but once in a while, they would get a\nchicken anyway.\nThey wouldn't try to attack you, would they?\nNo.",
        "Good. You went to school while you were there, also?\nNo, I didn't go to school. Maybe, it was during the summer, I'm not sure. I don't remember going to\nschool there.\nWhere was your brother?\nMy brother must have been young. Maybe I've got it out of sequence because there I was by\nmyself. When I went to that other place where I told you, where I was so miserable, my brother\nwas with me.\nWere your parents 1n the vicinity all this time?\nThey weren't too far. When I was at Labastide, it was the sister of our neighbor, Madame Cazeau,\nthis 1s a picture of her. It was just a question of saving--according to my mother, it was just a\nquestion of trying to keep me away from the house. In case something happened, that I would be\nsaved.\nDo you remember any incidents at this time, Nazis or any bombings or anything, did anything go on\nat this time?\nBombings, no. I never heard any bombings. The only time that I saw them when they would drop\ntheir--I can remember; they would come down to the town to Labastide, into the town and they\nwould drop off their bicycles. I remember being in the five, you know how; these old farms--there's\njust one big room, with the big fireplace, literally how you see it in Plymouth planation--that's how\nthey cooked on an open fire. I can remember when the Germans--I could never distinguish the\ndifference between the Germans or the gendarme, the police, whenever they appeared, I would go\non the corner of the fireplace and try to make myself as small as I could. I was always afraid, I was\nvery much afraid.\nI'm sure. Were there other playmates at this time?\nNo, I don't remember any playmates at all.",
        "How long--you were only there for just a few months?\nI think it was just a few months that I was there.\nWhere were you afterwards?\nI think it was the farm, the Red Cross, the convent and then for a while, instead of sleeping--after a\nwhile my mother said if we perish, we perish together. What I would do is I would not sleep at\nhome at night. She would send me to the neighbor's house and I would sleep with their daughter,\nHuni(ph)(c.268). Again I used to wake up in the middle of the night and I used to get frightened. I\ncould hear the mice in the walls and I couldn't sleep. It was a time of always being frightened and\ndidn't know why. I think we could feel it from the adults but they never would tell us anything so\nwe really--this fear was not known, was an unknown fear. Which actually made it worse because\nwe never knew where it was coming from. My mother got false identity papers from the policeman\nwho was helping her. At the beginning--my father still talked until he died, about the garden that he\nhad in back of the house. I went back to see that garden; I could remember it so vividly. One night,\nthey did come for my father and my mother was told--. Monsieur Couquebert sent his wife during\nthe day and told her that my father should not be home that night. He went across, where I told you,\nacross the house and he watched them; in the middle of the night they came for him. It was no\nlonger safe for him to stay there. What they did is, I'm sure you've heard of the Basseur, (ph)\n(c.287) the people who would take the Jews from France to Spain where it was supposed to be\nsafer?\nSmugglers, kind of.\nThat's exactly what happened. They took the men and took them over to Spain and my father ended\nup in Spain.\nWhat did he do in Spain, do you know?\nHe was in a camp, what they call a concentration camp, in Miranda. They struggled but they\nsurvived and we were left in the Pyrenees by ourselves with my mother. What my father used to do\nin order to earn his living; he worked in leather. When they would kill the cows, the oxen, he would\ntake the leather and tan it. He would make pocketbooks. My bag was (c.300) from my\nfather. As a matter of fact, when I back to this little town ten years ago, this Hunee (ph)(c.302) who",
        "I used to sleep with, she showed me and I don't have a picture of it here, she showed me a\npocketbook that my father made for her.\nThat's interesting. So your father got to Spain and then your mother came to the farm and took you\nout, 1s that what happened?\nThen we stayed with her.\nWhere was this?\nStill in St. Laurent De Neste. However, the twenty people that were there with us who--and I wasn't\nreally that much aware of them--I was aware of my mother's sister and her husband in Marcel but I\nwasn't aware of anybody else for some reason.\nI was going to ask you, did they associate with one another or was it dangerous?\nThere was a lot of--my mother tells me that they were not very nice to her, as far as the Jewish\npeople that were there.\nWhy?\nI don't know. They were just cliquish, you know, unfortunately.\nInteresting that in every situation that ---.\nThey decided that when it got to be too dangerous and they decided that they were going to Spain,\nmy brother was too young to go, to cross the Pyrenees, so Labastide's basseur (??) (322) that he\nwould come back for her and we were left behind and everybody left. As it turned out, this basseur\n(c.325) worked--what my mother never understood is that the men went first and they made it, he\ntook them there. But the others, the rest of them, they were delivered into the Germans' hands and\nso they all perished.",
        "Oh, G__. And so by chance you just didn't go with them.\nWe didn't go because my brother was too young to go. My mother's sister, her husband, when they\nwere in the mountains, the Germans came upon them. Uncle Jack was behind. He wasn't with his\nwife so he went to go with his wife, to protect them and his son and at that point he was shot. He\ndied right there and then.\nDid the smuggler get killed also?\nHe was the--the Resistance got him. He was shot.\nSo they were betrayed?\nThey were betrayed. He got money from the Jews and he got money from the Germans.\nWait, he was collaborating with the Germans and the Resistance went after him, I see.\nYes, the Resistance got after him. His wife, there was a woman there, my mother was telling me\nlast night, there was a woman in the town who arranged all this. They got after her too. They\nshaved her head, I understand.\nThe Resistance?\nYes.\nWas there much resistance activity in this town, do you know?\nEvidently, there was, yes.\nWas your mother aware of it? Did they make contact at all?",
        "They made contact with her after the war to see if she could identify any of the people who had\nbetrayed them. Because at the time when all the Jews left, she begged her sister not to go, to stay\nwith her. Her sister went and that's when they were put on the train to Auschwitz, she was able to\nsend her that letter.\nWhat year was this?\nIt blew my mind. When I went back to St. Laurent de Neste and the little town--my mother couldn't\nremember where my uncle was buried--because I remember when he was shot that my mother and I\nwent to the cemetery to the town, now I know its name is Shaum (ph) (c.359) and we went to place\na plaque on his tomb. They found her somewhere because there was one girl that escaped from the\ngroup; she ran and she was able to escape. She lived with us, evidently, for a little while. Her name\nwas Rosa Rosenberg. I remember going with her by train to that little town where we placed that\nplaque. When I went back, it blew my mind because I saw that it was just a few days before the\ndebarcation (?)(c.368) when the Americans went into France.\nSo that was already forty---?\n'44, June 44 when they were caught.\nDo you know what year it was then when you were--for example, how many years were you in this\ntown then, for three years?\n'39 to '45.\nOh, okay, for six years. Did you attend school at all then after you came back there?\nYes, I went to school.\nYou did. Were you ever told you were Jewish or anything like that by your parents?\nI remember my father, for a while, that he was trying to teach me Yiddish. I remember he tried but\nI guess he felt that 1t probably would not be the safest thing to do, so he stopped. For some reason,",
        "even though my parents learned Yiddish and I certainly understand it well, I never attempted to\nspeak it. One thing that I regret immensely, is not speaking Yiddish.\nWell, it's never too late.\nMy son and I, we were going to try and learn . One time, I remember, I made inquiries to see if we\ncould find--and there was a class but somehow we never materialized it and learned Yiddish. Do\nyou speak it?\nNo. But now I'm also thinking that I should.\nSometimes, I go down to Florida where my mother and father were and all you hear speaking is\nYiddish. I lament the fact that some day it's not going to be anymore.\nProbably not. Some day soon.\nIt's such a rich language, too.\nYes. We should all go take Yiddish. I have been thinking of it also.\nBut you must speak Hebrew.\nYes, I speak Hebrew fluently.\nThat, I envy you because I want to be able to speak it.\nI spent a lot of time there. Are there any specific episodes or anything from your war time\nexperiences that stand out in your mind vividly. I'm sure there must be some things that happened\nor--.\nDo you want to hear good things, bad things? Anything at all.",
        "Anything, everything.\n| was trying to think of all the things that I remember. One thing I remember is because we didn't\nhave much food, there wasn't much meat in those days and I can remember my father raising rabbits\nin one room in that house where we lived and we were overrun with rabbits. My father couldn't kill\none of them for food because they were friendly little rabbits. I don't think we ate one of them.\nThat's good.\nThen I remember there was a little closet outside and we had a duck. I can remember one time, in\nabsolute awe, I opened the door to let the two ducks out and the little ducklings came tumbling after\nthem, the little yellow ducklings, that was so cute! I remember the geese used to walk around the\ntown. There was one place where there were geese and they would run after you and pinch you\nsomething fierce. They were awful, really, really bad.\nThat's funny. They weren't afraid of people.\nNo. They used them like dogs to guard places. Oh, yes, they attack and they are very mean.\nAnd they can be trained to do that?\nI don't think they need too much training. It's instinct.\nJust give them some food. That's interesting. Is there anything else? Those are nice images.\nI can remember swimming in the town, in the river. I can remember going to church with my\nfriends. We used to cut out the wafers for the communion.\nYour parents encouraged you to go to church?\nYes, they did.",
        "Did they go to church too?\nI think my mother attended a couple of times, yes. I used to do a lot in the church. Again, the\nchurch was the center of the town. I did that.\nYou had a lot of playmates there?\nYes, I did. There were all these things to do around the church and so on and I certainlly partook\npart in all that. Most of it, though, was terror, fear. Although after a while, my mother finally\ndecided we were going to stay together and we were together, I think there was less of it than\nbefore. It was always this fear, first of all, that I was going to be sent away. And I was sent away a\nlot, even after the war, I was. It wasn't something that remained just for the war. After the war,\nalso, that was a kind of betrayal on my parents' part that I was pensioned off again.\nI would like to hear about that. Do you want finish with the war period and go on to that? Is there\nanything else you can--for my purposes, for this project, I'm going to concentrate on the war period.\nFor the purposes of our interview, I would like to have everything down.\nI'm trying to think of what else you would be interested in. I know that at one time, my mother tells\nme and I don't remember that, she was told that she had to leave. That it was no longer safe for her.\nDon't forget that the mayor also was helping us to stay and she was told not to stay there, to leave.\nShe didn't know where to go. She put my brother in the stroller and took some food with her and\nshe started walking away from the town. It's not as if you could take a bus or anything like that so\nshe started walking and walking. At night, she knocked on the door of a farmer and asked if she\ncould stay with her children, she would not make any noise. I think one of them refused her, she\nwas afraid. Another one let her stay, I think, in the barn. The next morning, I don't know how my\nmother did that, she must have been so frightened, the next morning she started walking again. I\nthink the second day, this Hunai(c.480) who I used to sleep with, who was my neighbor, she was\nabout 18, 19, she came on her bicycle after my mother and told her that it was safe, that she could\ncome back. Remember I told you how my father used to work with the leather; he used to take the\nskin and tan it; there's a whole process that you go through and he would make a pocketbook. My\nfather tells the story, you know how for the oxen, they used to have a stick with like a nail on the\nend, they would prick them on the rear end to get them to go faster. My father used to get mad\nbecause they used to ruin it, they would pierce the skin and it would ruin the leather. He would\nmake the skins and my mother would sell the skins, it was her job. That was the black market.",
        "Where did he get the cows and the oxen. That was illegal, or wasn't it? Where were they provided?\nWhen they killed the cows, I guess, they used to give my father the skins or he would buy the skins.\nHe did work for a while too. He worked maybe as an upholster in (c.502), he tells me, I\nthink, he used to go there every so often but then it stopped. My mother tells me that they managed\nto--she had money; she was left with some money. Mr. Couquebert, the one who was so helpful to\nher, when my father left for Spain, he came over. My mother says he opened his wallet and he says\nhere, how much do you need? He was willing to give her whatever she needed.\nThat's very nice. Was he given some kind of commendation afterwards?\nI don't know if he was. I think that's why--I talked to my mother last night. I wanted to get the\nnames because I think they should. He did perish. He somehow went back to England and got back\ninto the armed forces and he perished during the war. He ended up being killed. He certainly\nshould be one of the righteous because he certainly did help us. I don't think without him, we would\nhave survived.\nCould be, good chance. It's amazing how you found these all these little towns they just went all\nover.\nI don't know if you saw the movie that was shown by Bill Moyers on Channel 13, the education--\ncalled \"The Weapons of the Spirit\". That you've got to see. It's about a little town in France called\nthe Chambon.\nOh, yes, I know about the Chambon. Okay.\nAn amazing, amazing story and I watched it glued to the television. The tears just kept coming out\nbecause it reminded me so much of that little town, where without them, we would not have\nsurvived.\nI want to stop the tape and flip it over. Okay.",
        "I remember the day that my mother got a letter from the Red Cross saying that my father had made\ninto Spain. I remember the day that my mother got the letter from my aunt, her sister, that she was\non her way to Auschwitz.\nYou didn't tell me about that on the tape, did you? Would you like to tell me about please.\nMy mother said that when they finally assembled, got assembled to leave where the basseur(c.587)\nwas going to take over the Pyrenees into Spain, they all got together in back of the cemetery. I\nremember a woman arriving, I didn't know who she was and she arrived with a suitcase and she\nasked me a question where my mother was. I told her where she was and I guess she was one of\nthem. I don't remember who she was. She perished also; she went with them.\nMy mother begged her sister to stay and she wouldn't stay and she went. A while later she got a\nletter from her that she was in a cattle car so to Auschwitz. I remember the day that my\nmother got the letter.\nHow did she--?\nShe was walking around in total despair. I didn't know. It's only later that I realize what it was.\nThe Russians came. There was a bunch of Russians that came also from--I guess they were on their\nway to Franco, to Spain. They stopped at our house; my mother happened to speak Russian. They\nbrought her food, anything she wanted. They had food and stuff, they brought her in the back. My\nmother spoke fluent Russian then--.\nHow is that? She's from Poland though.\nShe also lived in Russia for a while. That's where she learned Russian. I remember being in Paris\nduring the liberation.\nThe Americans?\nRight. She finally decided that she had to go back to Paris in order to get my father back from\nSpain. We went back to Paris and we lived, I think, with her sister for a little while until my father\ncame back. She found an apartment. I remember my father coming back from Spain, brown and\nlooking good with a bunch of bananas that we had never seen. We became a family again.",
        "How was that?\nI guess it was tough for them. They had lost everything again. Nothing was left from the old\napartment. Everything was gone, apartments were hard to get so we got an apartment. They began\nto try and find ways to--. Somehow, they got hold of my uncle in this country and I remember,\nimagine having an Uncle Sam!. He used to send us packages with chewing gum and everything\nyou could imagine 1n those packages. In the name of--they had to rebuild their lives--we were again\nsent off to homes by ourselves.\nWas that a common thing?\nPretty common, yes.\nWhere were you sent?\nIn the countryside.\nFor how long?\nA year, six months. I was very, very (c.624), very hard to take. You could understand, I think,\nas children we understood during the war that it was inevitable or that it was necessary, but after the\nwar it was--.\nYour parents felt that they couldn't function, they couldn't build up as quickly if you were around?\nThey did that also even before the war, as a child.\nThat's interesting. Do you want to talk a little bit about the time after the war, when you came to\nAmerica?",
        "I don't know. It probably won't be part of the war story so I don't think--I could tell you but I don't\nthink 1t needs to be recorded.\nThen that's up to you. Some people want it for a sense of completion to tell their entire situation for\nthe purpose of the interview. If you'd rather not, that's fine.\nOnly to say that after the war, I was seven years old when I got back to Paris. We lived in Paris for\nsix years. Then we came to the United States.\nSo you went to high school in the United States?\nYes. I went to Lesane (ph) (c.637), for a year and a half in Paris. Then I came here. I started here\nin junior high school. My parents, they were born in Poland or Russia. They came to France, my\nfather went to Spain and came back to France and then came here so it was a constant upheaval for\nthem to adjust and learn new languages and new ways. It was tough.\nWhat about your sense of--once you were reunited and after the war, was there any more sense of\nJewishness in the family?\nI certainly knew that I was Jewish when I was in France. I remember that, we didn't have libraries\nthe way you have libraries here--where you can go into the library and pick any book you want. So\nthey used to have books, some books in the school that you could borrow and you could pick a book\non one day. They announced a book, some Jewish history or something just before it was my time\nto pick a book and I remember I picked a book. I went to some organization, I think my mother\nmade me join some organizations that I enjoyed. By and large, I think, I didn't know anything about\nJudaism at all. I knew more about, since I was in the convent, and all my little friends were\nCatholic, I knew more about the Catholic religion than I did about Judaism. It was only when I\ncame to this county, after I got married; I was almost ashamed. People would ask me questions\nabout the Jewish holidays and I didn't know anything about them, that I began to learn what they all\nmeant. It's now that I've started to partake in the Seder and different things.\nDid you have a sense, when you were with the Catholic children, that you weren't part of them?\nI always knew there was something different about me.",
        "I've spoken to other people who had that. They knew they were going through all the motions and\neverything but said that they knew it wasn't their----. Would you like to talk about your aunt and\nuncle who were taken away?\nThey were--I remember my cousin and he was a brat.\nHis name was Marcel?\nHis name was Marcel? I can't remember the last name. I know that their names are in Yad\nVashem. I think that's been recorded.\nIf you could find that out for me?\nI'll find out the last name. It just escapes me right now. I don't remember, I remember him more\nthan I remember--. I remember the house they lived in and I have a picture of that. They lived in\nthe house that my brother was born in. I remember visiting them.\nIn Paris?\nNo, in St. Laurent De Neste. Anything in Paris before the war, I do not remember, I was just too\nyoung.\nHow old was Marcel?\nHe must have been two or three years older than I was. He must have been about seven, maybe.\nDo you know where he was born?\nHe must have been born in Paris.\nSo he was a brat? He was rambunctious? or he was just bad? or mean to you?",
        "He was mean, yes. I always felt guilty about saying that since he perished. But he was. My mother\ntells the story of how he wouldn't eat. You know mothers always have to feed their, especially their\nsons, their children. She would take and do every thing for him so that he would eat. I do not\nremember that much.\nYou wouldn't know anything about his schooling, or any of his family background?\nNo, I would have to ask my mother.\nIf we could find that out for a future point, then we could use his story. Otherwise, it would be\ndifficult.\nYes, to get it together, yes.\nIs there anything else that you would like to tell me that you can think of? with regard to your\nparticular experience or with any of the repricusions? That is entirely up to you.\nI can't think of anything as far as the--. I think, as a child, 1t was so painful, we were in such pain all\nthe time, that we just didn't--. It's like not being awake all the time, it's kind of a strange sensation.\nIt's like if it was too painful, you just forgot, you just didn't remember or you just weren't there. I\ndon't know what I was thinking of but I don't have the vivid recollections. There are certain things\nthat are very vivid, like in the convent. Having to go to the chapel, praying--. I remember the food,\nI remember them giving us this hot chocolate made with water for breakfast and hating it.\nWhat else did you have to eat?\nBread, mostly bread. That's the only thing that I remember about food--tomatoes, there must have\nbeen some vegetables that kids didn't like vegetables. I remember--as I said, I was so afraid to go\ninto the convent. It was only at the last, last minute that I rang the doorbell and we went. The town\nitself, I can remember walking from my house to where my aunt used to live. As the picture shows\nyou, there was like a wall in the street and I can remember the sun making shadows on the wall. I\nused to be so scared to walk through that, it was like a, what do they call it, a calfule (ph) (c.712),\nbetween two streets and oh I used to be so scared, always scared. I can remember having whooping\ncough and being very sick.",
        "Was there any way to get medical attention?\nThere was a doctor, I remember being treated by the doctor. I don't know how much they could do\nbut I do remember having the whooping cough.\nDo you think that this sense of fear, you carried this?\nOh, yes. I remember the night my brother was born. I was four years old and I remember that. I\ntried to think of the town. I can remember my brother was always being absconded, I always had to\ngo look for my brother. They used to say, he's in the shirt, in the chemise; they used to make fun of\nme.\nYour brother lives in America now?\nYes.\nDo you talk to him about the experience?\nNot much. I really, as I said, never really told the whole story. I remember the woman in that place,\nwhere I told you, where we didn't really have enough to eat. How she used to walk with her feet\npigeon like this and I remember once asking her how come you walk like that? She says when you\nget old, you'll walk like that.\nDid you write notes that you'd like to look at?\nThese were just notes that I wrote when I sent back to St. Laurent de Neste about ten years ago.\nProbably my mother has one, I should get 1t back from her. I wrote to her at great length when I\nwas there, sent her some long letters. At night I would get back to the hotel and I would have to\nwrite it down and I probably should get that back from her because that's when I really put my\nfeelings down, very traumatic. She says she cried when she got the letters. For a long time,\nespecially during the terrorists, when France didn't want to give the terrorists, I think it was during\nthe Munich thing--.",
        "The Olympics?\nThe Olympics. I got mad at French and as much as I liked the cheeses, I think, for a whole year, I\nboycotted the cheese. Then I began to realize, wait a second, how about all the people who had\nbeen so nice and without whom you wouldn't have survived so I started to buy cheese again.\nWhy suffer?\nNo, I didn't want them to suffer.\nDo you identify with your French roots, or you've really been in this country for a long time?\nDo I identify with, yes, this is a part of me that's really--. It's really one of the things that's difficult.\nWhen I go back to France, some of the things, some of the basic things, I speak French fluently, but\nsome of the basic things, sometimes, I don't know how to do, I have to ask. They look really--.\nYou feel silly?\nSilly, silly. People look at me, where have you been, what planet did you come from? But I do\nenjoy going to France.\nI was thinking, perhaps your home was sort of atypical anyway since your parents were immigrants\nthere. Were they fully French?\nMy mother was. My father, no, but my mother definitely was.\nHe had an accent then in his French as well?\nYes.",
        "So he was in great danger?\nMy father was, in more danger than my mother. It's Just amazing that we did survive as a family.\nSo many, as you saw, didn't survive.\nIs there anything else you want to tell me for this interview?\nI don't think so. I think this covers it. Just to make sure that the town does get recognition, that it is\nwritten up--all the names of the people, the French. It was just amazing that without this little town,\nif they had been hostile, or if they had not wanted us, I do not know how we would have survived. I\ndon't think there was a way to survive.\nI would like for you to write down these names for me if you could do this. At this point, I guess,\nwe can stop and I want to thank you very much.\nMy pleasure.",
