        "Q: Would you tell me...tell me your name please?",
        "A: Uh my name is Kurt Klein. I was born on July 2, 1920 in a town called Waldorf, which is\nvery close to Heidelberg, in Germany.",
        "Q: Tell me about uh your parents and your family.",
        "A: Well uh I grew up in the post-World War I era and, of course, those were really difficult\ntimes and my parents were struggling to get along during this uh economic chaos that existed\nduring those times. You may remember uh there there was this very serious inflation. I mean\nit was ludicrous in a sense uh such as has never been seen before -- or since, I believe -- and\nthat made it very difficult to to uh carry on anything at all. My father had a business that was\nmade extremely difficult uh because of uh the economic conditions that existed after World\nWar I. He was a broker for hops and tobacco and grain that he would buy from the farmers\nin the town that we lived 1n and uh and he and my mother helped him uh all she could and of\nof course they they along with so many others were just struggling to to exist in those days.\nBut still you might you might say that I grew up in a middle class uh family and uh of course\nafter going to elementary school in in this town, uh it was expected that I I would go to toa\nhigh school in Heidelberg. Uh really it was the called the Oberrealschule which was then\nperhaps on a somewhat higher level than high school, but uh uh those were, of course,\nalready quite uh eventful times and I I grew up amid all this chaos of the different parties of\nof Weimar Republic fighting each other and uh from my earliest childhood on uh saw the\nformation of the Nazi Party and how they gradually gained strength and uh uh there\nwere...early on there were perhaps times when one didn't uh take them all that seriously but it\nsoon became apparent that they were a force to be reckoned with...",
        "Q: Kurt, what is that...in your life, uh tell me tell me about how this affected you.",
        "A: Well, uh it affected me in in the sense that uh later on especially uh when when people uh\nwere won over by the Nazis, they they no longer uh were our friends or or or neighbors as as\nwe had been used to it. And uh it also represented an an ominous threat because uh from\nearly on, Hitler and all the others uh made it quite clear how they felt about the Jews and\nwhat they would be doing uh to to the Jews, but uh it it also uh meant that uh\nsometimes...you you would see all these slogans on the walls uh direct...many of them\ndirected against Jews and uh so you you had a feeling even earlier on that you were truly\nbeing singled out. Uh uh you hardly knew for what reason, but uh but you knew that that all\nall this propaganda was directed against you. And it uh it it made it difficult at times to to\ncarry on because you you uh you obviously...in my father's case uh I don't know the details,\nbut uh you couldn't do business with people who felt that way. Nevertheless uh things were\nstill more or less alright uh un...until Hitler actually came to power but I I could see that the\nNazi Party was uh gaining strength and so could the others but uh uh actually nobody\nbelieved that they were capable of of doing the things which in fact uh it turned they they\nlater did.",
        "Q: Did you lose friends because of this atmosphere?",
        "A: Uh once Hitler was in power...I don't remember losing any earlier, but once Hitler was in\npower uh uh it it...uh there was a gradual alienation from from the rest of of my schoolmates.\nUh some of them were better than others but many of them initially apologized for some of\nthe things that Hitler said he was going to do uh assuring us that he, of course, didn't mean\npeople like us, my parents or our friends. And then gradually you could almost see the direct\nrelation of their indoctrination in the Hitler Youth, let's say, uh of how much more hostile\nthey became until in the end they stopped talking altogether or they might perhaps uh taunt\nyou. Even then uh it was well-known that there were concentration camps and they would\nsay things to the effect that uh if you people behave, you might be alright but uh but uh if\nyou don't watch out, you might all wind up in concentration camps. And after which they uh\nof course didn't... mean long before then they they had stopped to associate with you. At at\nfirst uh uh these people had been in my house uh constantly and I had been in their homes\nand they had eaten in our home and I ate in theirs, and uh uh there there was really no\ndifference. I grew up uh considering myself a part of that scene, never thinking that I was\ngoing to be singled out for something like this, and uh I I I saw the gradual evolution of of of\nhow all this changed. Uh uh it was bewildering to someone growing up uh amid the turmoil\nof that of that period.",
        "Q: Tell us what was high school...what uh...tell me about those early years. What kinds of\nthings did you do as a...?",
        "A: Well, I actually I did all the things that uh any young man does or likes. Uh uh I II engaged\nin sports uh just as the others did, and I liked soccer. Uh II liked books quite a bit and that\nhelped me later also when when I was sort of shut off from the outside world, but even early\non I [I liked books and uh I belonged to a uh organization of uh young uh Jewish young\npeople. We we went on on hikes very often. Uh went mountain climbing, swimming, skiing.\nUh we did all the things uh that young people are apt to do and uh I liked movies a great\ndeal. Also American movies in those days were quite popular and uh uh I read books also by\na also by American authors. Uh I I remember such things as Jack London, uh and many\noth...Mark Twain, of course. Huck Finn...I I did all those things and uh so in that sense II I\nhad a normal uh upbringing uh and then later on when uh all the other boys turned away\nfrom me uh and there were very few Jewish friends in the town that I lived in...there were uh\nthere was no...nobody exactly my age but there were some other boys close to me, but no\nmore than two or three. Uh the rest of my Jewish friends I found in in Heidelberg uh which\nwas, of course, large enough to have a larger Jewish uh con...uh population, and uh that to\nsome extent made up uh for my not being able to associate with anybody in the town in\nwhich I lived and I have some very fond memories of, for instance, of this organization that I\nmentioned, of going off into the mountains and going hiking, sometimes for uh a few day\ntrips, uh staying in youth hostels overnight and uh those were all things that that sort of made\nmy my formative years quite interesting and and and to some extent enjoyable. And that\nwent on even after the Nazis came to power, but uh it 1t stopped when I was approximately\nuh fourteen. At that point uh my father uh was no longer able to to send me to high school\nwhich had which required tuition and so it it was thought best that...uh for Jewish young\npeople at the time it was quite common to to to learn a trade and uh so I uh I thought about\nwhat I would like to be and uh since I had always liked books I I chose printing as as my\nvocation and I I did in fact uh get a job in in printing in the town where I lived. In fact, 1t was\non the same street where I lived and this man was quite willing to take me on and I worked\nthere for a number of months and then the authorities uh heard about it and made it\nimpossible for him to keep me on, so then I I I had to stop that and I later on uh worked uh\nfor a Jewish firm. It was...that was still in existence at that time uh which was a uh tobacco\nfactory where where they actually made cigars uh and I I found some sort of a job uh\nun...until the time uh that I uh in fact left Germany, but it was becoming more and more\nevident that uh that uh Jews should leave if uh anybody at all would have them, and not very\nmany countries would have them. It it wasn't quite that easy but especially young people\nuh...1t was suggested for young people to to leave because there there was obviously no\nfuture for them in in Germany. And so uh we too uh came to that conclusion, that I...and\nsince we had some relatives uh in the States that that seemed to be the the natural place to go.\nUh the...I was fortunate and now in retrospect I know that that uh must have saved my life.\nUh my sister who was older than I uh was then in nurses' training uh in Germany, but uh she\nalso decided, of course, that 1t was time to leave and as someone vouched for her on this end\nand and so she came here a year ahead of me and had she not been here, I I would not have\ngotten out, because she was able to go after people and and and ask them for for the\nnecessary papers that one needed in those days, an affidavit of support, and uh so she she did\nthat for me and so that by 1937 uh I was able to to leave also and come to Buffalo where at\nthat time my sister lived and uh uh and so did uh various other relatives, among them an\nuncle and an aunt and their daughter in whose house I I then stayed the first few years uh\nwhen I came to Buffalo. Uh I also uh uh was able after a couple of weeks to to find a job in\nprinting again so that I could continue that uh that training and uh that 1s in fact what what I\nmade my career. Uh there were, of course...when I was still in Germany, you you could see\nthe uh the gradual more and more repressive measures that were being directed at at Jews.\nUh the the thing that I remember so well is uh being 1n school and uh having uh having to\nattend...1t was mandatory attendance at at uh these propaganda films that uh Leni Riefenstahl\ndid in those days, Triumph of the World being one them, and I I I still remember them\nvividly because uh I could see at first hand how the films like that affected especially the\nyoung and how uh how they swung them over to unquestioned obedience to to the Nazi\ncause. And uh but but everybody was affected by them...the the the older people too, and you\ncould see that the more uh that they...this propaganda worked on them, the the the more they\nbelieved it.",
        "Q: We're going to have pause a moment...\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE",
        "A: Well, I remember uh uh attending such films or listening uh to the speeches on the radio and\nI was a teenager then and and wondering that uh how did I ever get into this position. I I\npersonally don't know any any such people as they describe, and uh I uh how how 1s this\npossible and uh how 1s it possible to have all this venom directed at you when in fact you\nyou haven't done a thing and and you've just lived a a peaceful life and my parents were\nsimply uh law-abiding citizens who who were struggling to get along in in a very difficult\neconomy. And uh and that, of course, was very, very puzzling to me. Uh but the the point I\nwas trying to make was that the the Nazis knew like almost no one else how to use the power\nof the media to to sway people's opinions. Uh you know, radio had come into its own during\nmy early childhood and and they used that for propaganda purposes as no one else had has\nhad before or since. And uh that's how they were able to uh to to sway people and and get\nthem to do the things they did.",
        "Q: OK. Let's move forward now. You had been talking about you in Buffalo. Uh...",
        "A: Right. Well, in Buffalo I uh I was tn printing and uh uh I I gradually uh improved myself a\nlittle. I found some other jobs in printing and uh I uh in the...of course at that point we...from\nthen on uh both my sister and I uh were trying to to make it possible for our parents to follow\nus. Uh I should mention that I also had an older brother who came uh to the States about a\nyear after I did, uh although he uh initially settled down in uh...I forget the exact\nsequence...uh first in New York, then in Boston, then back in New York again I believe is is\nhow it was. Uh and uh we, of course, tried very hard to get our our parents uh to follow us,\nbut uh those were difficult times here also and uh it was not easy to get the necessary papers\nuh for my parents. At least it was difficult to convince anybody that there was any immediate\nurgency about getting them out and the answer usually was, yes, in due time uh after you\nhave established yourselves uh you you will see them also follow you, and so while we\ncontinuously worked on it, uh really nothing that much happened uh and until uh really until\n19...November '38 when when Kristallnacht came. And uh then people began to take some\nnotice. Uh and and, of course, there was absolute panic in among the Jews in Germany about\ngetting out. Uh unfortunately uh my parents hesitated a little too long about registering at the\nAmerican Consulate in in in Stuttgart and so they got a very...they had a system of of priority\nnumbers in those days and so they got a very high uh number which uh made it impossible\nfor them to uh to contemplate leaving immediately. Uh uh there there many attempts that we\nmade at the time uh to have them leave on the basis that we the children were asking for\nthem but as we eventually found out, you needed to be a citizen in order for for I believe it\nwas called Form 575, or something like that...uh which meant that some people were\nallowed in outside the quota, but basically uh they had they had to adhere to the quota\nsystem and and the high priority numbers which, of course, everybody wanted to get out at\nthe time. So uh this went on and on and uh but in each letter I uh I...1t it so happens that I uh\nhave every letter that my parents ever wrote to me uh during that period, from the time II I\nleft uh left them and uh each letter would uh would be full of some news of more repressive\nmeasures that uh that were taking place, so that before Kristallnacht, for example, uh they\nhad written to us that now they had been forced to...my father had been forced to sell his\nbusiness and the the Nazis had effectively throttled Jewish businesses anyway and uh had uh\nthrough their boycott pointed out to the uh German population that they ought not to buy\nfrom Jews or associate with them, and and those measures were, of course, felt uh in in in\npretty short order so that there came a point when my father was forced to sell his business\nand uh a very short time later also the house that they were in uh because they simply\ncouldn't keep that up. Uh and after...they had already made the arrangements for selling the\nhouse, but the man who bought it was not going to move in uh until the following spring\nbecause he was going to do some renovating, and so it became an agonizing decision for\nthem to...uh should they stay in that house throughout the winter, largely without heat or\nother or income, or should they avail themselves of whatever was was uh offered to them in\na very run-down, dilapidated part of the town, also uh and should they take while that\nwas...while the taking was still good and uh uh this is what they were agonizing over at the\npoint when when Kristallnacht happened. After that they were under orders to move and and\nall these decisions were were taken from their hands and uh as it wound up, they they moved\nin with another uh acquaintance, a Jewish lady who...1in fact the uh wife of the owner of the\nof that cigar factory uh for which uh I had worked and and and where my father had\nsubsequently worked for a little bit uh in in the office when he could no longer have his own\nbusiness. Uh they they...she had an old house somewhere in another part of the town and\nthey were ordered to move to uh what was really above a stable...uh what had been a\nstable...it was not then anymore, and 1n in just one room of uh...of course, uh during\nKristallnacht uh we were to find out that some of the uh some of my schoolmates...uh one in\nparticular...had become the leader of of the of this gang of hoodlums who had invaded my\nparents house and and lined them up against a wall and proceeded to smash all all their\nfurniture and everything they could lay their hands on. And uh they they took my father with\nthem that night and he had to spend some time uh in in the local jail but was released a few\ndays later, probably because of his age and uh uh but...that was by far the the better part of\nwhat happened on Kristallnacht because uh most men were simply sent to concentration\ncamps, but what I was going to say about uh the gang that that invaded my parents'\nhouse...uh this 1s uh this then a boy who had been in and out of our home and had eaten at\nour table and and he led this gang tn in really making threats towards these elderly people,\nuh defenseless people, and uh and and treated them in the in the most abombnibal manner\nand vandalized the whole place.",
        "Q: And you were hearing all of this as it were through the letters your received?",
        "A: Yes. Well, some of it was only through veiled references that uh my parents were able to\nmake, but uh we uh we could usually...we learned to read between the lines and we we knew\nwhat they meant when when they made references. For instance, uh they let us know that\ntheir furniture had been smashed because I still remember my my mother's uh used the\nphrase that they now were possessors of mini-furniture and uh all this was actually\nconfirmed to us by uh an uncle of mine who was fortunate enough to leave after those times\nand because he had a a daughter in England and a very influential son-in-law who got them\nout and they eventually wound up also coming to Buffalo where I lived and where they had a\nson uh so they were able to fill me in on some of the details of what happened.",
        "Q: What did you...uh what did you do now? This is is after Kristallnacht...uh tell us about you\nvery briefly so that we can move into the war experience for you.",
        "A: Well uh II should, however, also uh mention that you know we kept on trying by every\nmeans to to get them out, but at at at every turn something else happened and uh and the next\nthing that that happened was was in 1940 when in uh in the fall of 1940 we received a letter\nfrom a relative in Switzerland who informed us that...he said you will, of course, have read\nthe reports in in the newspapers of what has happened to your parents along with uh all the\nJews of the province of Baden and the Palatinate and that namely that at the whim of the\nlocal authorities, they were told within twenty minutes to two hours to pack up a few things\nand uh and take along with them and they were in fact deported to the south of France. Uh\nwhat...to what was then the unoccupied zone of France uh to a to a camp that had at one time\nserved as a refugee camp for the civil war refugees that came from Spain, because it was\nnear the Pyrenees and and the Spanish border and uh they were they were simply dumped\nthere with with without blankets, with...without adequate, with without anything and and and\nuh the Germans told the French to take over and uh so we we...of course, it took a long time\nuntil we then established some direct contact with uh my parents because they uh at first they\ncouldn't write and when they did write it it took...that...those things took weeks and weeks in\nthose days. Uh and uh also because the there was already a war going on in Europe uh by\nthat time, of course. Uh that in '39, of course, added to our complications. When the war\nstarted, we again were set back incredibly far back as far as as trying to help them to get out\nof there because normal escape routes were out of the question and you you could only find\nuh certain ones and and that only if you had quite a bit of money uh either to bribe officials\nor and and just for the passage and and everything else. Uh but at any rate, uh being in the\nunoccupied zone of of uh of France was uh at the same time...they were, of course,\nsegregated. They were not allowed to live together there. Men were 1n a different camp than\nthan women, but they were usually once a week allowed to to visit each other and and, of\ncourse, we got their letters then and we wrote to them. We were able to do that, and uh uh\nthis is uh quite a record of what went on in in those camps, but where...whereas it it was, of\ncourse, a catastrophe that this had happened to them, at the same time it still uh made it\npossible for them to perhaps get out uh easier uh than if they had remained in Germany\nbecause they they could go to the American consulate in Marseilles. If they were summoned\nby the by the consul, they were allowed out of these camps uh to to take care of this matter,\nbut somehow or other there there was always a flaw and always a new complication\nthat...and this went on I mean in an absolutely half-assed way. At at every corner there was\nan...another obstacle and we we had booked passage for them many times and they had to let\nthose terms expire because their papers weren't ready and and so it and and then they were\nmoved. My father was was sent to another camp, closer to Marseilles and uh and so so it\nwent on and on. Uh uh they could in fact with the right papers have left by way of Spain and\nPortugal. We had a Portuguese ship, the passage for them on on several times and each time\nsomething...uh they could never get clearance on time. And uh this this went on, on and on.\nIn the meantime uh I uh...by the...this was now running into 1942 and uh by the summer of\nuh '42 uh actually perhaps five, six weeks later, one one of my letters was returned from\nthere...uh address un...unknown. Left no forwarding address. And as we found out through a\ntracing bureau after the war uh they were in fact deported to to Auschwitz, along with all the\nthousands and thousands who were there. Uh this also uh this time was the time when I was\ninducted in the Army. Uh so that uh uh it it 1t all happened together and I I recently found a a\nnotice for from the State Department uh that reached us in November of '42, a time when I\nwas already in the Army, that said that they were now pleased to let us know that that our\nparents had gotten clearance. This was three months after they had been deported to\nAuschwitz. But at any rate uh I I was inducted in the Army and uh to me it was a great relief\nand also perhaps a source of pride that I was able to finally uh do something about this. Here\nwe had been literally paralyzed for years, always at the uh whim of the uh of whatever\nauthorities were in charge and uh and now I was finally able to to to fight this this big\nev...evil. And uh I I was in the Army and uh actually never finished basic training before\nthey found out that I had a language capability and in those days of course they were looking\nfor for German-speaking personnel and German-speaking personnel that uh no doubt they\ncould trust. Uh so that uh I was pulled out of the uh away from the unit that I had been\nassigned to in those days and sent to a military intelligence uh training center in Maryland in\nfact uh which uh in which we uh were assigned to these uh different jobs of either prisoner\nof war interrogation or or some military government or some other, some other activities and\nI wound up with a unit that uh was charged with prisoner of war interrogation and uh we uh\nfirst went on maneuvers and this was now '42. Uh no...this was '43, and uh later uh by the\nend of that summer I...we were sent overseas, first to England and then I spent uh nine\nmonths in northern Ireland where I was assigned to the unit that I I went through the actual\nbattles with, namely the 5th U.S. Infantry Division, and uh as such was attached to a\nregiment and uh my job was, of course, to to uh interrogate prisoners for whatever tactical\ninformation they could give and that's what I did. Uh I uh I went through the various\ncampaigns. I uh I went through Normandy uh not too much after D-Day and uh went\nthrough the various campaigns and also in in Luxembourg and uh later on in in Germany and\nfirst in the north in the Ruhr area and then another time more in the south, but at one point\nwe were called...we were...I belonged to Patton's 3rd Army and uh we had to uh we wound\nup in in Czechoslovakia. This was now toward the end of the war and uh uh...(cough)...we\nwere uh in a in a town called Elernordheim (ph). Uh from there uh...this these were the the\nfinal stages of the war, that it was becoming quite obvious that it would soon be over, but uh\nreports reached us that uh the town a few miles away from there was was ready to surrender\nbecause there were uh flying white flags uh from from their houses and uh so it became my\njob, along with uh a very small medical detachment and and the military government uh\ndetachment, uh to go to that town and take take the surrender. It was my job to uh uh see if\nthere were still any any Germans uh soldiers, prisoners... mean soldiers there and uh we we\nwent to that town, just about three jeeps, on the evening of May 6th uh and the uh military\ngovernment uh colonel took care of the civilian surrender with the with the mayor of the\ntown uh whereas I went about my business looking for for Germans and I only found a a few\nin a uh in a German field hospital. They had converted a school house into into a hospital,\nand I I I found a few of them and made arrangements, made some mental notes what to do\nwith them the following day. We were not in any position to do anything right then and\nthere. Uh but uh we uh...it was late in the day and we uh the war was still going on. We still\nhave received some shelling even on the way to the town. Uh but so we decided to go back\nto our unit about uh six, eight miles away from there, and it was getting dark, so when we\ngot back uh I compared notes with the uh military government colonel and he told me that in\nfact they uh had come across a group of about a hundred twenty uh Jewish girls who had\nbeen uh dumped into an abandoned factory by their SS guards, and that we would uh see\nwhat could be done the following morning. Uh and that was the first inkling I had of of that\nparticular incident. Uh the following morning I went back with a greatly uh augmented\ngroup of people. Uh the medics were there in in great numbers and and again with the\nmilitary government colonel also and uh I uh I drove into that factory and uh and I saw this\ncourtyard and the and there were some what I I can only describe them as as living skeletons\nwalking around, going about certain chores such as getting water uh in the courtyard and\nover in a doorway I I saw another young woman sort of leaning against the doorway and and\nshe seemed to be in slightly better condition than than the rest that I had just seen and I\nwalked over to her and addressed her in I think both in English and in German, and uh\nbecause I assumed of course that she spoke German uh and uh which she confirmed, and I\nuh I wanted to see, of course, where the rest of of her companions were, and I asked her\nabout them and she just motioned me in and I...uh we went inside and uh that was of course\na scene of devastation that nobody who has ever seen it will will ever forget. Uh I mean\nthese girls, young women, mostly were were lying on scraps of straw that they had found..in\nin various stages of disease or close to death and uh uh I mean...it it was just simply\nsomething that uh that one couldn't believe, that anybody would permit that, and the the\nyoung woman I had seen there uh did a most remarkable thing uh that that really uh I mean it\nit just uh shattered me. When we came into this large room where where all these women\nwere were lying, she pointed at them and then quoted some lines from a from a well-known\nGerman poem by Goethe called \"The Divine,\" and the words are...freely translated mean\nsomething like, \"noble be man...\" she made a gesture, \"...helpful and good.\" And that really\nsimply devastated me. And I started to to talk to some of them, and uh one of them addressed\nme in English and uh when I tried to reassure her that now she was alright, she she went like\nthis and said no, it's too late, too late. And in fact I heard later that she did die only hours\nlater. Uh of course, our unit made immediate arrangements to uh to take care of of of these\ngirls and uh we evacuated the hospital of whatever Germans were still in it and we we took\nthem to the hospital and uh where they came under the care and supervision of uh of our\nAmerican doctors. Uh I should mention perhaps that this girl I met first and who was my\nguide is, has been my wife for forty-four years and that we have eight grandchildren, three\nchildren and and eight grandchildren. But uh this was still May 7th and that was just when\nthe war was coming to an end and uh I uh I mean I was totally shaken by this experience but\nI but I had to go back to my unit because now uh all these German troops were uh\nsurrendering en masse uh uh and I really had my hands full for for a few days. Uh when I\nwas able to get back to the hospital a few days later uh I, of course, wanted to...I saw all the\ngirls but I wanted to see this girl in particular and I found that she had in fact also collapsed\non admittance to the hospital and that she was listed in critical condition and uh at one point\nduring that time the doctors wanted to amputate her legs but uh she wouldn't let them and\nfortunately uh she was right. Uh despite the fact that she was that ill uh we carried on quite a\nquite a lively conversation and uh uh she...when I was ready to leave she gave me a few\nsheets of paper and they happened to be some thoughts that uh she had expressed on\nliberation and what it was in fact was an ode to her liberating uh Americans and perhaps you\ncan see why I became interested in her. It uh...she was an unusual person with a certain aura\nabout her that I I just knew I had to get to know better, and from that evolved our\nrelationship and I was able to visit her later, still in the hospital. Even after I was transferred\nfrom the immediate area, I would still come back a few times and later on made it possible\nfor her to be nearer where I was and uh I found her some lodging...her and friend in in\nMunich where I had been transferred after the war. Uh our our story sort of uh came to a\nclimax when when we married about a year later in in Paris. I uh I had been...I had gotten a\nleave from the Army by that time and uh and gone back to Buffalo, but I came back to Paris\nand uh after a great deal of difficulty with the with the local authorities there, we finally got\nmarried and that is our story. The...[ uh...1t uh...1t's difficult to think back to those times and\nand to think that we are really those people but uh but that is what happened to us. Uh I of\ncourse had some very interesting experiences while I was in the Army. Uh I among other\nthings what happened to me was that I that uh one of the uh uh German soldiers that were\nbrought to me for interrogation happened to be Hitler's chauffeur and uh he gave me the the\nstory of the last days of of Hitler and Eva Braun in the Bunker in in Berlin uh which has has\ngone down in the history books as as being the definitive uh story of of Hitler's last days and\nhe told me how he uh how Hitler had instructed him personally uh to dispose of his and Eva\nBraun's remains by pouring gas over their bodies in in the courtyard of that Bunker uh\nbecause they didn't want any remains to fall into Russian hands. The Russians had, of course,\ntaken Berlin...uh were taking it shortly thereafter, and uh so he carried out all all those orders\nand that is that is the story that came down to me and I see uh by the history books also to to\nothers. Uh that is apparently how it happened.",
        "Q: Did he describe to you the last days in the Bunker?",
        "A: Well, he did but I don't have a very detailed recollection of that. Uh they must have been\nchaotic but I I really can't tell you details that uh that, you know, that would uh throw any\nlight on it now. I uh I do remember that he described uh his personal duties that that Hitler\nhad instructed him to do, and uh and so that uh I I think that in fact that no no traces were\never found by the Russians uh of Hitler and Eva Braun, his mistress, so that is the story of\nthat. Uh as as I said before, un...unfortunately we we found out after the war that uh uh my\nparents along with so many others had been deported to Auschwitz and so I certainly knew if\nnot first hand at least I had an understanding for what uh had gone on during the war. Uh I\nwill say this that I always...I I really did think the Nazis capable. I knew their mentality and I\ndid think them capable of doing the things which which in fact they did and they did do.\nNothing truly surprised me. I merely didn't know the details. I also always knew that it\nwould come to a war, even as a young boy. Uh the the signs of it were there and in the\nturmoil of that world and quest for revenge that the average German had at the time...I just\nknew that it would come to another war in which I no doubt would be involved.",

        "A: Uh my name is Kurt Klein. I was born on July 2, 1920 in a town called Waldorf, which is\nvery close to Heidelberg, in Germany.",
        "A: Well uh I grew up in the post-World War I era and, of course, those were really difficult\ntimes and my parents were struggling to get along during this uh economic chaos that existed\nduring those times. You may remember uh there there was this very serious inflation. I mean\nit was ludicrous in a sense uh such as has never been seen before -- or since, I believe -- and\nthat made it very difficult to to uh carry on anything at all. My father had a business that was\nmade extremely difficult uh because of uh the economic conditions that existed after World\nWar I. He was a broker for hops and tobacco and grain that he would buy from the farmers\nin the town that we lived 1n and uh and he and my mother helped him uh all she could and of\nof course they they along with so many others were just struggling to to exist in those days.\nBut still you might you might say that I grew up in a middle class uh family and uh of course\nafter going to elementary school in in this town, uh it was expected that I I would go to toa\nhigh school in Heidelberg. Uh really it was the called the Oberrealschule which was then\nperhaps on a somewhat higher level than high school, but uh uh those were, of course,\nalready quite uh eventful times and I I grew up amid all this chaos of the different parties of\nof Weimar Republic fighting each other and uh from my earliest childhood on uh saw the\nformation of the Nazi Party and how they gradually gained strength and uh uh there\nwere...early on there were perhaps times when one didn't uh take them all that seriously but it\nsoon became apparent that they were a force to be reckoned with...",
        "A: Well, uh it affected me in in the sense that uh later on especially uh when when people uh\nwere won over by the Nazis, they they no longer uh were our friends or or or neighbors as as\nwe had been used to it. And uh it also represented an an ominous threat because uh from\nearly on, Hitler and all the others uh made it quite clear how they felt about the Jews and\nwhat they would be doing uh to to the Jews, but uh it it also uh meant that uh\nsometimes...you you would see all these slogans on the walls uh direct...many of them\ndirected against Jews and uh so you you had a feeling even earlier on that you were truly\nbeing singled out. Uh uh you hardly knew for what reason, but uh but you knew that that all\nall this propaganda was directed against you. And it uh it it made it difficult at times to to\ncarry on because you you uh you obviously...in my father's case uh I don't know the details,\nbut uh you couldn't do business with people who felt that way. Nevertheless uh things were\nstill more or less alright uh un...until Hitler actually came to power but I I could see that the\nNazi Party was uh gaining strength and so could the others but uh uh actually nobody\nbelieved that they were capable of of doing the things which in fact uh it turned they they\nlater did.",
        "A: Uh once Hitler was in power...I don't remember losing any earlier, but once Hitler was in\npower uh uh it it...uh there was a gradual alienation from from the rest of of my schoolmates.\nUh some of them were better than others but many of them initially apologized for some of\nthe things that Hitler said he was going to do uh assuring us that he, of course, didn't mean\npeople like us, my parents or our friends. And then gradually you could almost see the direct\nrelation of their indoctrination in the Hitler Youth, let's say, uh of how much more hostile\nthey became until in the end they stopped talking altogether or they might perhaps uh taunt\nyou. Even then uh it was well-known that there were concentration camps and they would\nsay things to the effect that uh if you people behave, you might be alright but uh but uh if\nyou don't watch out, you might all wind up in concentration camps. And after which they uh\nof course didn't... mean long before then they they had stopped to associate with you. At at\nfirst uh uh these people had been in my house uh constantly and I had been in their homes\nand they had eaten in our home and I ate in theirs, and uh uh there there was really no\ndifference. I grew up uh considering myself a part of that scene, never thinking that I was\ngoing to be singled out for something like this, and uh I I I saw the gradual evolution of of of\nhow all this changed. Uh uh it was bewildering to someone growing up uh amid the turmoil\nof that of that period.",
        "A: Well, I actually I did all the things that uh any young man does or likes. Uh uh I II engaged\nin sports uh just as the others did, and I liked soccer. Uh II liked books quite a bit and that\nhelped me later also when when I was sort of shut off from the outside world, but even early\non I [I liked books and uh I belonged to a uh organization of uh young uh Jewish young\npeople. We we went on on hikes very often. Uh went mountain climbing, swimming, skiing.\nUh we did all the things uh that young people are apt to do and uh I liked movies a great\ndeal. Also American movies in those days were quite popular and uh uh I read books also by\na also by American authors. Uh I I remember such things as Jack London, uh and many\noth...Mark Twain, of course. Huck Finn...I I did all those things and uh so in that sense II I\nhad a normal uh upbringing uh and then later on when uh all the other boys turned away\nfrom me uh and there were very few Jewish friends in the town that I lived in...there were uh\nthere was no...nobody exactly my age but there were some other boys close to me, but no\nmore than two or three. Uh the rest of my Jewish friends I found in in Heidelberg uh which\nwas, of course, large enough to have a larger Jewish uh con...uh population, and uh that to\nsome extent made up uh for my not being able to associate with anybody in the town in\nwhich I lived and I have some very fond memories of, for instance, of this organization that I\nmentioned, of going off into the mountains and going hiking, sometimes for uh a few day\ntrips, uh staying in youth hostels overnight and uh those were all things that that sort of made\nmy my formative years quite interesting and and and to some extent enjoyable. And that\nwent on even after the Nazis came to power, but uh it 1t stopped when I was approximately\nuh fourteen. At that point uh my father uh was no longer able to to send me to high school\nwhich had which required tuition and so it it was thought best that...uh for Jewish young\npeople at the time it was quite common to to to learn a trade and uh so I uh I thought about\nwhat I would like to be and uh since I had always liked books I I chose printing as as my\nvocation and I I did in fact uh get a job in in printing in the town where I lived. In fact, 1t was\non the same street where I lived and this man was quite willing to take me on and I worked\nthere for a number of months and then the authorities uh heard about it and made it\nimpossible for him to keep me on, so then I I I had to stop that and I later on uh worked uh\nfor a Jewish firm. It was...that was still in existence at that time uh which was a uh tobacco\nfactory where where they actually made cigars uh and I I found some sort of a job uh\nun...until the time uh that I uh in fact left Germany, but it was becoming more and more\nevident that uh that uh Jews should leave if uh anybody at all would have them, and not very\nmany countries would have them. It it wasn't quite that easy but especially young people\nuh...1t was suggested for young people to to leave because there there was obviously no\nfuture for them in in Germany. And so uh we too uh came to that conclusion, that I...and\nsince we had some relatives uh in the States that that seemed to be the the natural place to go.\nUh the...I was fortunate and now in retrospect I know that that uh must have saved my life.\nUh my sister who was older than I uh was then in nurses' training uh in Germany, but uh she\nalso decided, of course, that 1t was time to leave and as someone vouched for her on this end\nand and so she came here a year ahead of me and had she not been here, I I would not have\ngotten out, because she was able to go after people and and and ask them for for the\nnecessary papers that one needed in those days, an affidavit of support, and uh so she she did\nthat for me and so that by 1937 uh I was able to to leave also and come to Buffalo where at\nthat time my sister lived and uh uh and so did uh various other relatives, among them an\nuncle and an aunt and their daughter in whose house I I then stayed the first few years uh\nwhen I came to Buffalo. Uh I also uh uh was able after a couple of weeks to to find a job in\nprinting again so that I could continue that uh that training and uh that 1s in fact what what I\nmade my career. Uh there were, of course...when I was still in Germany, you you could see\nthe uh the gradual more and more repressive measures that were being directed at at Jews.\nUh the the thing that I remember so well is uh being 1n school and uh having uh having to\nattend...1t was mandatory attendance at at uh these propaganda films that uh Leni Riefenstahl\ndid in those days, Triumph of the World being one them, and I I I still remember them\nvividly because uh I could see at first hand how the films like that affected especially the\nyoung and how uh how they swung them over to unquestioned obedience to to the Nazi\ncause. And uh but but everybody was affected by them...the the the older people too, and you\ncould see that the more uh that they...this propaganda worked on them, the the the more they\nbelieved it.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE",
        "A: Well, I remember uh uh attending such films or listening uh to the speeches on the radio and\nI was a teenager then and and wondering that uh how did I ever get into this position. I I\npersonally don't know any any such people as they describe, and uh I uh how how 1s this\npossible and uh how 1s it possible to have all this venom directed at you when in fact you\nyou haven't done a thing and and you've just lived a a peaceful life and my parents were\nsimply uh law-abiding citizens who who were struggling to get along in in a very difficult\neconomy. And uh and that, of course, was very, very puzzling to me. Uh but the the point I\nwas trying to make was that the the Nazis knew like almost no one else how to use the power\nof the media to to sway people's opinions. Uh you know, radio had come into its own during\nmy early childhood and and they used that for propaganda purposes as no one else had has\nhad before or since. And uh that's how they were able to uh to to sway people and and get\nthem to do the things they did.",
        "A: Right. Well, in Buffalo I uh I was tn printing and uh uh I I gradually uh improved myself a\nlittle. I found some other jobs in printing and uh I uh in the...of course at that point we...from\nthen on uh both my sister and I uh were trying to to make it possible for our parents to follow\nus. Uh I should mention that I also had an older brother who came uh to the States about a\nyear after I did, uh although he uh initially settled down in uh...I forget the exact\nsequence...uh first in New York, then in Boston, then back in New York again I believe is is\nhow it was. Uh and uh we, of course, tried very hard to get our our parents uh to follow us,\nbut uh those were difficult times here also and uh it was not easy to get the necessary papers\nuh for my parents. At least it was difficult to convince anybody that there was any immediate\nurgency about getting them out and the answer usually was, yes, in due time uh after you\nhave established yourselves uh you you will see them also follow you, and so while we\ncontinuously worked on it, uh really nothing that much happened uh and until uh really until\n19...November '38 when when Kristallnacht came. And uh then people began to take some\nnotice. Uh and and, of course, there was absolute panic in among the Jews in Germany about\ngetting out. Uh unfortunately uh my parents hesitated a little too long about registering at the\nAmerican Consulate in in in Stuttgart and so they got a very...they had a system of of priority\nnumbers in those days and so they got a very high uh number which uh made it impossible\nfor them to uh to contemplate leaving immediately. Uh uh there there many attempts that we\nmade at the time uh to have them leave on the basis that we the children were asking for\nthem but as we eventually found out, you needed to be a citizen in order for for I believe it\nwas called Form 575, or something like that...uh which meant that some people were\nallowed in outside the quota, but basically uh they had they had to adhere to the quota\nsystem and and the high priority numbers which, of course, everybody wanted to get out at\nthe time. So uh this went on and on and uh but in each letter I uh I...1t it so happens that I uh\nhave every letter that my parents ever wrote to me uh during that period, from the time II I\nleft uh left them and uh each letter would uh would be full of some news of more repressive\nmeasures that uh that were taking place, so that before Kristallnacht, for example, uh they\nhad written to us that now they had been forced to...my father had been forced to sell his\nbusiness and the the Nazis had effectively throttled Jewish businesses anyway and uh had uh\nthrough their boycott pointed out to the uh German population that they ought not to buy\nfrom Jews or associate with them, and and those measures were, of course, felt uh in in in\npretty short order so that there came a point when my father was forced to sell his business\nand uh a very short time later also the house that they were in uh because they simply\ncouldn't keep that up. Uh and after...they had already made the arrangements for selling the\nhouse, but the man who bought it was not going to move in uh until the following spring\nbecause he was going to do some renovating, and so it became an agonizing decision for\nthem to...uh should they stay in that house throughout the winter, largely without heat or\nother or income, or should they avail themselves of whatever was was uh offered to them in\na very run-down, dilapidated part of the town, also uh and should they take while that\nwas...while the taking was still good and uh uh this is what they were agonizing over at the\npoint when when Kristallnacht happened. After that they were under orders to move and and\nall these decisions were were taken from their hands and uh as it wound up, they they moved\nin with another uh acquaintance, a Jewish lady who...1in fact the uh wife of the owner of the\nof that cigar factory uh for which uh I had worked and and and where my father had\nsubsequently worked for a little bit uh in in the office when he could no longer have his own\nbusiness. Uh they they...she had an old house somewhere in another part of the town and\nthey were ordered to move to uh what was really above a stable...uh what had been a\nstable...it was not then anymore, and 1n in just one room of uh...of course, uh during\nKristallnacht uh we were to find out that some of the uh some of my schoolmates...uh one in\nparticular...had become the leader of of the of this gang of hoodlums who had invaded my\nparents house and and lined them up against a wall and proceeded to smash all all their\nfurniture and everything they could lay their hands on. And uh they they took my father with\nthem that night and he had to spend some time uh in in the local jail but was released a few\ndays later, probably because of his age and uh uh but...that was by far the the better part of\nwhat happened on Kristallnacht because uh most men were simply sent to concentration\ncamps, but what I was going to say about uh the gang that that invaded my parents'\nhouse...uh this 1s uh this then a boy who had been in and out of our home and had eaten at\nour table and and he led this gang tn in really making threats towards these elderly people,\nuh defenseless people, and uh and and treated them in the in the most abombnibal manner\nand vandalized the whole place.",
        "A: Yes. Well, some of it was only through veiled references that uh my parents were able to\nmake, but uh we uh we could usually...we learned to read between the lines and we we knew\nwhat they meant when when they made references. For instance, uh they let us know that\ntheir furniture had been smashed because I still remember my my mother's uh used the\nphrase that they now were possessors of mini-furniture and uh all this was actually\nconfirmed to us by uh an uncle of mine who was fortunate enough to leave after those times\nand because he had a a daughter in England and a very influential son-in-law who got them\nout and they eventually wound up also coming to Buffalo where I lived and where they had a\nson uh so they were able to fill me in on some of the details of what happened.",
        "A: Well uh II should, however, also uh mention that you know we kept on trying by every\nmeans to to get them out, but at at at every turn something else happened and uh and the next\nthing that that happened was was in 1940 when in uh in the fall of 1940 we received a letter\nfrom a relative in Switzerland who informed us that...he said you will, of course, have read\nthe reports in in the newspapers of what has happened to your parents along with uh all the\nJews of the province of Baden and the Palatinate and that namely that at the whim of the\nlocal authorities, they were told within twenty minutes to two hours to pack up a few things\nand uh and take along with them and they were in fact deported to the south of France. Uh\nwhat...to what was then the unoccupied zone of France uh to a to a camp that had at one time\nserved as a refugee camp for the civil war refugees that came from Spain, because it was\nnear the Pyrenees and and the Spanish border and uh they were they were simply dumped\nthere with with without blankets, with...without adequate, with without anything and and and\nuh the Germans told the French to take over and uh so we we...of course, it took a long time\nuntil we then established some direct contact with uh my parents because they uh at first they\ncouldn't write and when they did write it it took...that...those things took weeks and weeks in\nthose days. Uh and uh also because the there was already a war going on in Europe uh by\nthat time, of course. Uh that in '39, of course, added to our complications. When the war\nstarted, we again were set back incredibly far back as far as as trying to help them to get out\nof there because normal escape routes were out of the question and you you could only find\nuh certain ones and and that only if you had quite a bit of money uh either to bribe officials\nor and and just for the passage and and everything else. Uh but at any rate, uh being in the\nunoccupied zone of of uh of France was uh at the same time...they were, of course,\nsegregated. They were not allowed to live together there. Men were 1n a different camp than\nthan women, but they were usually once a week allowed to to visit each other and and, of\ncourse, we got their letters then and we wrote to them. We were able to do that, and uh uh\nthis is uh quite a record of what went on in in those camps, but where...whereas it it was, of\ncourse, a catastrophe that this had happened to them, at the same time it still uh made it\npossible for them to perhaps get out uh easier uh than if they had remained in Germany\nbecause they they could go to the American consulate in Marseilles. If they were summoned\nby the by the consul, they were allowed out of these camps uh to to take care of this matter,\nbut somehow or other there there was always a flaw and always a new complication\nthat...and this went on I mean in an absolutely half-assed way. At at every corner there was\nan...another obstacle and we we had booked passage for them many times and they had to let\nthose terms expire because their papers weren't ready and and so it and and then they were\nmoved. My father was was sent to another camp, closer to Marseilles and uh and so so it\nwent on and on. Uh uh they could in fact with the right papers have left by way of Spain and\nPortugal. We had a Portuguese ship, the passage for them on on several times and each time\nsomething...uh they could never get clearance on time. And uh this this went on, on and on.\nIn the meantime uh I uh...by the...this was now running into 1942 and uh by the summer of\nuh '42 uh actually perhaps five, six weeks later, one one of my letters was returned from\nthere...uh address un...unknown. Left no forwarding address. And as we found out through a\ntracing bureau after the war uh they were in fact deported to to Auschwitz, along with all the\nthousands and thousands who were there. Uh this also uh this time was the time when I was\ninducted in the Army. Uh so that uh uh it it 1t all happened together and I I recently found a a\nnotice for from the State Department uh that reached us in November of '42, a time when I\nwas already in the Army, that said that they were now pleased to let us know that that our\nparents had gotten clearance. This was three months after they had been deported to\nAuschwitz. But at any rate uh I I was inducted in the Army and uh to me it was a great relief\nand also perhaps a source of pride that I was able to finally uh do something about this. Here\nwe had been literally paralyzed for years, always at the uh whim of the uh of whatever\nauthorities were in charge and uh and now I was finally able to to to fight this this big\nev...evil. And uh I I was in the Army and uh actually never finished basic training before\nthey found out that I had a language capability and in those days of course they were looking\nfor for German-speaking personnel and German-speaking personnel that uh no doubt they\ncould trust. Uh so that uh I was pulled out of the uh away from the unit that I had been\nassigned to in those days and sent to a military intelligence uh training center in Maryland in\nfact uh which uh in which we uh were assigned to these uh different jobs of either prisoner\nof war interrogation or or some military government or some other, some other activities and\nI wound up with a unit that uh was charged with prisoner of war interrogation and uh we uh\nfirst went on maneuvers and this was now '42. Uh no...this was '43, and uh later uh by the\nend of that summer I...we were sent overseas, first to England and then I spent uh nine\nmonths in northern Ireland where I was assigned to the unit that I I went through the actual\nbattles with, namely the 5th U.S. Infantry Division, and uh as such was attached to a\nregiment and uh my job was, of course, to to uh interrogate prisoners for whatever tactical\ninformation they could give and that's what I did. Uh I uh I went through the various\ncampaigns. I uh I went through Normandy uh not too much after D-Day and uh went\nthrough the various campaigns and also in in Luxembourg and uh later on in in Germany and\nfirst in the north in the Ruhr area and then another time more in the south, but at one point\nwe were called...we were...I belonged to Patton's 3rd Army and uh we had to uh we wound\nup in in Czechoslovakia. This was now toward the end of the war and uh uh...(cough)...we\nwere uh in a in a town called Elernordheim (ph). Uh from there uh...this these were the the\nfinal stages of the war, that it was becoming quite obvious that it would soon be over, but uh\nreports reached us that uh the town a few miles away from there was was ready to surrender\nbecause there were uh flying white flags uh from from their houses and uh so it became my\njob, along with uh a very small medical detachment and and the military government uh\ndetachment, uh to go to that town and take take the surrender. It was my job to uh uh see if\nthere were still any any Germans uh soldiers, prisoners... mean soldiers there and uh we we\nwent to that town, just about three jeeps, on the evening of May 6th uh and the uh military\ngovernment uh colonel took care of the civilian surrender with the with the mayor of the\ntown uh whereas I went about my business looking for for Germans and I only found a a few\nin a uh in a German field hospital. They had converted a school house into into a hospital,\nand I I I found a few of them and made arrangements, made some mental notes what to do\nwith them the following day. We were not in any position to do anything right then and\nthere. Uh but uh we uh...it was late in the day and we uh the war was still going on. We still\nhave received some shelling even on the way to the town. Uh but so we decided to go back\nto our unit about uh six, eight miles away from there, and it was getting dark, so when we\ngot back uh I compared notes with the uh military government colonel and he told me that in\nfact they uh had come across a group of about a hundred twenty uh Jewish girls who had\nbeen uh dumped into an abandoned factory by their SS guards, and that we would uh see\nwhat could be done the following morning. Uh and that was the first inkling I had of of that\nparticular incident. Uh the following morning I went back with a greatly uh augmented\ngroup of people. Uh the medics were there in in great numbers and and again with the\nmilitary government colonel also and uh I uh I drove into that factory and uh and I saw this\ncourtyard and the and there were some what I I can only describe them as as living skeletons\nwalking around, going about certain chores such as getting water uh in the courtyard and\nover in a doorway I I saw another young woman sort of leaning against the doorway and and\nshe seemed to be in slightly better condition than than the rest that I had just seen and I\nwalked over to her and addressed her in I think both in English and in German, and uh\nbecause I assumed of course that she spoke German uh and uh which she confirmed, and I\nuh I wanted to see, of course, where the rest of of her companions were, and I asked her\nabout them and she just motioned me in and I...uh we went inside and uh that was of course\na scene of devastation that nobody who has ever seen it will will ever forget. Uh I mean\nthese girls, young women, mostly were were lying on scraps of straw that they had found..in\nin various stages of disease or close to death and uh uh I mean...it it was just simply\nsomething that uh that one couldn't believe, that anybody would permit that, and the the\nyoung woman I had seen there uh did a most remarkable thing uh that that really uh I mean it\nit just uh shattered me. When we came into this large room where where all these women\nwere were lying, she pointed at them and then quoted some lines from a from a well-known\nGerman poem by Goethe called \"The Divine,\" and the words are...freely translated mean\nsomething like, \"noble be man...\" she made a gesture, \"...helpful and good.\" And that really\nsimply devastated me. And I started to to talk to some of them, and uh one of them addressed\nme in English and uh when I tried to reassure her that now she was alright, she she went like\nthis and said no, it's too late, too late. And in fact I heard later that she did die only hours\nlater. Uh of course, our unit made immediate arrangements to uh to take care of of of these\ngirls and uh we evacuated the hospital of whatever Germans were still in it and we we took\nthem to the hospital and uh where they came under the care and supervision of uh of our\nAmerican doctors. Uh I should mention perhaps that this girl I met first and who was my\nguide is, has been my wife for forty-four years and that we have eight grandchildren, three\nchildren and and eight grandchildren. But uh this was still May 7th and that was just when\nthe war was coming to an end and uh I uh I mean I was totally shaken by this experience but\nI but I had to go back to my unit because now uh all these German troops were uh\nsurrendering en masse uh uh and I really had my hands full for for a few days. Uh when I\nwas able to get back to the hospital a few days later uh I, of course, wanted to...I saw all the\ngirls but I wanted to see this girl in particular and I found that she had in fact also collapsed\non admittance to the hospital and that she was listed in critical condition and uh at one point\nduring that time the doctors wanted to amputate her legs but uh she wouldn't let them and\nfortunately uh she was right. Uh despite the fact that she was that ill uh we carried on quite a\nquite a lively conversation and uh uh she...when I was ready to leave she gave me a few\nsheets of paper and they happened to be some thoughts that uh she had expressed on\nliberation and what it was in fact was an ode to her liberating uh Americans and perhaps you\ncan see why I became interested in her. It uh...she was an unusual person with a certain aura\nabout her that I I just knew I had to get to know better, and from that evolved our\nrelationship and I was able to visit her later, still in the hospital. Even after I was transferred\nfrom the immediate area, I would still come back a few times and later on made it possible\nfor her to be nearer where I was and uh I found her some lodging...her and friend in in\nMunich where I had been transferred after the war. Uh our our story sort of uh came to a\nclimax when when we married about a year later in in Paris. I uh I had been...I had gotten a\nleave from the Army by that time and uh and gone back to Buffalo, but I came back to Paris\nand uh after a great deal of difficulty with the with the local authorities there, we finally got\nmarried and that is our story. The...[ uh...1t uh...1t's difficult to think back to those times and\nand to think that we are really those people but uh but that is what happened to us. Uh I of\ncourse had some very interesting experiences while I was in the Army. Uh I among other\nthings what happened to me was that I that uh one of the uh uh German soldiers that were\nbrought to me for interrogation happened to be Hitler's chauffeur and uh he gave me the the\nstory of the last days of of Hitler and Eva Braun in the Bunker in in Berlin uh which has has\ngone down in the history books as as being the definitive uh story of of Hitler's last days and\nhe told me how he uh how Hitler had instructed him personally uh to dispose of his and Eva\nBraun's remains by pouring gas over their bodies in in the courtyard of that Bunker uh\nbecause they didn't want any remains to fall into Russian hands. The Russians had, of course,\ntaken Berlin...uh were taking it shortly thereafter, and uh so he carried out all all those orders\nand that is that is the story that came down to me and I see uh by the history books also to to\nothers. Uh that is apparently how it happened.",
        "A: Well, he did but I don't have a very detailed recollection of that. Uh they must have been\nchaotic but I I really can't tell you details that uh that, you know, that would uh throw any\nlight on it now. I uh I do remember that he described uh his personal duties that that Hitler\nhad instructed him to do, and uh and so that uh I I think that in fact that no no traces were\never found by the Russians uh of Hitler and Eva Braun, his mistress, so that is the story of\nthat. Uh as as I said before, un...unfortunately we we found out after the war that uh uh my\nparents along with so many others had been deported to Auschwitz and so I certainly knew if\nnot first hand at least I had an understanding for what uh had gone on during the war. Uh I\nwill say this that I always...I I really did think the Nazis capable. I knew their mentality and I\ndid think them capable of doing the things which which in fact they did and they did do.\nNothing truly surprised me. I merely didn't know the details. I also always knew that it\nwould come to a war, even as a young boy. Uh the the signs of it were there and in the\nturmoil of that world and quest for revenge that the average German had at the time...I just\nknew that it would come to another war in which I no doubt would be involved.",
