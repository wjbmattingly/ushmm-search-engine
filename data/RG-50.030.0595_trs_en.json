        "Question: This is an oral history interview, conducted by the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum. The interview is conducted on October 17\", 2010\nat the Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia Kindertransport Association conference.\nThe interviewer is Noemi Szekely-Popescu, and the interviewee is Herbert\nFriedman. Welcome. Could you first give me your name at birth?",
        "Answer: My name is Herbert Friedman, born on December 11\", 1924, in Vienna,\nAustria. Can you stop the tape for a second?",
        "Q: Absolutely. [break] So Mr. Friedman, you just told us what year you were\nborn, and I\u2019d be curious to know what your parents did. What \u2014 what did your\nfather do?",
        "A: My father was a shoe designer, working on ladies\u2019 shoes, and he worked for,\ninitially, as far as I remember, for a Czech shoe factory called Bachia(ph). This was\nin the 20s. But then, with the depression, the factory f-folded up and he went into\nthe leather business, selling supplies to shoe repair shops. And it was a \u2014 I imagine,\na-as a child I really didn\u2019t appreciate the \u2014 the difficulty that \u2014 that it was for him to\nearn a living, but we managed.",
        "Q: Now, what did your mother do? Did she stay at home?",
        "A: No, she was a housekeeper, and there were three children. And my grandmother,\nand of course my parents, we all lived in one apartment. And the apartment was\nOctober 17, 2010\nabout a \u2014 consisted of about two and a half rooms. A-And in the bedroom \u2014 all six\nof us slept in that one bedroom. It was a big bedroom, but I would sleep with my\nbrother, and then that was the custom. And if we had visitors, by the way, which\nhappened from time to time, people who came from Radom, where they had\noriginally come from, then the two boys, my brother and I would sleep on the floor.\nSpread out a blanket on the floor, and the guests would stay in the bed. But that was\nthe custom, and the \u2014 we really expected that this would happen, and di-di-didn\u2019t\naffect us in any way, or didn\u2019t bother us sleeping on the floor, because we slept just\nas well on the floor as in bed, as \u2014 as \u2014 as kids.",
        "Q: What part of Vienna was this?",
        "A: Well, we lived in the 20\" district, known as the Brigittenau, about two blocks\nfrom the Danube. And we lived on the fourth floor, no elevators, no running water\nin the apartment. You went out in the hallway, where there was a cold water faucet\nthat you got the water from, and then would bring it in the home, and \u2014 and then\nthere was a\u2014 a bathroom, it was sort of a \u2014 just a \u2014 a toilet, which was shared b-\nbetween two apartments. A-And that \u2014 and that was the style, an-and that\u2019s all I\nsaw, and any people I came in contact with, they all seemed to have a similar setup\nexcept sometimes the apartment was even smaller than ours. So, there was no \u2014\nliving in the fourth floor, there was no elevator, you walked. And my grandmother\nOctober 17, 2010\nwould many times say, oh those steps, they\u2019re killing me. You see, but at the time I\nsays, you know, I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s complaining, there\u2019s nothing to it. You\nknow, I could take two steps at a time as a kid, running up and down. But the last\ntime when I was in Vienna, two years ago, I walked those steps. The house is still\nthere. And \u2014 and \u2014 and I understood what my grandmother was talking about.",
        "Q: So you said that you had siblings. Can you tell me their names, when they were\nborn?",
        "A: Yeah, well, my brother was two years older. His \u2014 his name was Benny, and he\nwas born February of \u2014 of \u201922. I have a sister born March 8\", \u201926.",
        "Q: And your sister\u2019s name?",
        "A: Lilly.",
        "Q: Did you have an observant family? What denomination did you belong to?",
        "A: Yeah, ultra-Orthodox. Ultra-Orthodox, yeah. Come \u2014 come Friday, you know,\nthe light would go off. And we all, we\u2019d have a light by the Shabbas candle, and we\nwould have no heat, because it\u2019s Shabbas, you know, you have to suffer. A-And,\nyou know, I remember \u2014 of course, you can\u2019t get it on tape, but to show you, my\ngrandmother would sit there, in va \u2014 in Vienna it really gets cold, and sh-she would\n[indecipherable] she\u2019d back and forth, you know, with her \u2014 with her feet and arm,\ntrying stay warm. But, no heat, until Shabbas was over, you see.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "Q: So \u2014 so what did they \u2014 what did your family do for a Shabbat meal, given that\nthere\u2019s no heat? Did they leave the stove on, or \u2014",
        "A: Oh, we had the \u2014 a cold \u2014 I mean we had \u2014 we have a warm meal before going to\nsynagogue on Friday, and on Saturday we had something cold, that didn\u2019t require\nany \u2014 any heating un-until Shabbas was over.",
        "Q: Which synagogue did you go to?",
        "A: It was called \u2014 well, my father would go to the Kasha(ph) temple. And I didn\u2019t\nlike to go there, so at first I\u2014 he would drag me with him. And I didn\u2019t like it\nbecause I didn\u2019t understand what was going on, and it was stand up and sit down\nand stand up and sit down and you know, and \u2014 and it went on forever. So I would\ngo to the Klikee(ph) temple. The Klikee(ph) temple was located on the Klikee(ph)\ngasse. Many times in Austria they \u2014 they would name the temple after the s \u2014 the\nstreet that it was located on. And I liked the \u2014 the Klikee(ph) because after services,\nthey would give candy to the kids. So it was \u2014 so naturally that was a big attraction\nfor me, the candy.",
        "Q: Now, when you say ultra-Orthodox, do you \u2014 do you mean Hasidic, or \u2014 or\nOrthodox?",
        "A: No. N-No, just ver-very much adherent, but not [indecipherable], no.",
        "Q: And you say that your family had originally come from Radom?\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: Yes. First my father came. He came from Radom to \u2014 because he was going to\nbe drafted into the Polish army. He didn\u2019t want to serve in the Polish army, so he\nran away. And he heard about Vienna, so he came to Vienna. And my mother later\nf-followed. And as a matter of fact, she told me once that if \u2014 and you want me to\nsay in German? [speaks German here]. When | arrived in Vienna, | thought I was\nin heaven. That\u2019s how different it \u2014 living conditions were in Poland, Radom,\ncompared to the modern city of Vienna, Austria.",
        "Q: And your \u2014 your father was trying to escape being drafted, was that during the\nrun up to the first world war, or when was that?",
        "A: No, this was after.",
        "Q: After?",
        "A: Yeah, this was af \u2014",
        "Q: So what year did they come to Vienna? Do you know?",
        "A: \u2019'm\u2014I\u2019m not quite \u2014 I think my father came there around maybe \u201920, and my\nmother came a year later, \u201921 or \u201922, something like that. Many questions tha-that\nI\u2019m being asked now, I-I wish I had asked. That\u2019s why when I talk to \u2014 to my\nchildren, and when I talk to schools, I always urge people \u2014 young \u2014 young\nchildren, to ask their parents while you still have an opportunity, or grandparents,\nwhat life was like for them. Because I know you wi \u2014 are going to regret. We all do,\nOctober 17, 2010\nno matter how old, or \u2014 or \u2014 at the time, but eventually you \u2014 you\u2019re going to regret\nthat you did not ask certain questions while you had the opportunity.",
        "Q: So they came \u2014 both of them came from Poland.",
        "A: Yeah, Radom.",
        "Q: Did they speak Polish amongst each other, or Yiddish \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, as a matter of fact, they spoke Yiddish normally, but Polish when they\ndidn\u2019t want us to know what they were talking about. So they\u2019d switch to Polish.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t grow up to \u2014 to know Polish, to learn Polish?",
        "A: No, no, no. We spoke yi \u2014 they would speak Yiddish, we would speak German.\nSo \u2014 so I understood what they were saying, but we didn\u2019t really speak Yiddish, w-\nwe spoke German. The children.",
        "Q: Di-Did your father have to speak German in his business life, or did \u2014 could he\nget by on Yiddish?",
        "A: Well, he spoke both. So whatever the circumstances were, he could respond. But\nthe \u2014 most of the time, the people that he dealt with likewise were immigrants from\nadjoining countries, because Austria was a more modern place and it offered\ngreater opportunities than smaller countries, I mean \u2014 not smaller countries, you\nknow, but \u2014 but th \u2014 not as advanced countries. So he would speak \u2014 when he dealt\nOctober 17, 2010\nwith Gentiles, he spoke German, and with Jewish people, yeah, it was always \u2014\nYiddish was the international language.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about school?",
        "A: Yes. I always attended elementary school, and then \u2014",
        "Q: Jewish school, or a state school?",
        "A: No, a state. Yeah, public school. Which was very good. I attended public school,\nf-four years of elementary, and then we switched over to something called\nhauptschule, which was a sort of a\u2014 I guess in America you\u2019d call it middle\nschool. And in my case, I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t even finish the middle school, because once\nHitler came in, none of us were able to attend any school, we were kicked out of\nschool, and \u2014 and I sw-switched over to a Jewish school for a while, called Talmud\nTorah in the second district in Vienna. The second district was heavily populated\nby Jewish people, and they used to call it Matzoh Insel. Matzoh Island.",
        "Q: So bef \u2014 before the annexation, when you\u2019re still able to go to \u2014 to a state school,\ndid you take any supplementary, or so-some sort of Jewish classes at the end of the\nday, or \u2014 or on Sundays, or \u2014",
        "A: No, n-not really. Only training for Bar Mitzvah, where a year ahead of time, I\nwould sit down with someone, not a rabbi, but one of the Hassids, who would teach\nme the Torah portion that I was supposed to read at my Bar Mitzvah, which\nOctober 17, 2010\noccurred in \u00b037, actually four months before Hitler came in. And it happened to be\na very momentous occasion in my life. You might find it funny, my grandmother\nwas at first a little upset that I would have my Bar Mitzvah staged at the Klikee(ph)\ntemple. Why\u2019? Because the Klikee(ph) temple had an organ. And having an organ in\na temple, that \u2014 that was not kosher enough, so she wanted me to have it somewhere\nelse. But I liked the Klikee(ph) temple, and I was going there. So I had to tell her\nthat although they have this organ, they never use it. And the only time they use it\nwas on Sundays when on occasion they have a wedding. But the mere fact that the\norgan was there, that was enough reason for her not to particularly enjoy being\nthere.",
        "Q: Since you went to a non-Jewish school until the annexation, did you have any\nnon-Jewish friends? What was the distribution of Jews to non-Jews in your class?",
        "A: In\u2014 from grade one, I experienced anti-Semitism. Six years old, I go into grade\none, another kid \u2014 they find out very soon whether you\u2019re Christian or not, even at\nsix. And he called me a Christ killer, and you know, I didn\u2019t know what that was. I\nsaid \u2014 you know, what he was talking about. And \u2014 and it was not \u2014 when I came\nhome, I asked my mother. And she said, oh, pay no attention, or this is something\nthat they\u2019re \u2014 where they\u2019re taught at home not to like certain people, but you\u2019re\ngonna hear this, just \u2014 h-he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying, so just forget about it.\nOctober 17, 2010\nBut you mean \u2014 you very soon learn. Later on actually, we would frequently have\nfights, wh-which \u2014 which occurred mainly when the priests came to school, and\nstarted showing movies. And it dealt \u2014 you saw people with beards, and \u2014 and th-the\npayos and so forth, so you knew that \u2014 and they showed the crucifixion.",
        "Q: Do you remember what grade this was? How old were you when these movies\nstarted to be shown?",
        "A: I think I\u2014I probably was around eight or nine, a-an-and \u2014 and when class lets\nout, then we started fights. And many a day I\u2019d come home with a bloody nose\nbecause at that time, when somebody hit you, you \u2014 you struck back. And I was\nnever hesitant, so it\u2019s oh \u2014 you know, even as I went on to middle school, you\nknow, I \u2014 somebody said something to me, called me a dirty Jew, you know, I'd let\nhim have it. And you learn that if it\u2019s one person, you take him on, but if there\u2019s a\ngroup, I figured I\u2019d better run. But I was never scared, al-although my mother in\nparticular always told me not to get involved, or \u2014 or \u2014 you know, walk away, run\naway, but I never did.",
        "Q: How did your father feel about this? Did he have an opinion about confrontation,\nor \u2014",
        "A: I was always scared to tell my father, because \u2014 because he was the enforcer, you\nsee, so I dealt mostly with my mother. I \u2014 I had a mean \u2014 when I was \u2014 and \u2014 and\nOctober 17, 2010\nalso, many times, I \u2014 I admit, I didn\u2019t listen. I \u2014 I was \u2014 my mother would say, a\nreckless person. In the summer of \u201934, I asked my mother if I could go swimming.\nAnd I loved swimming, even as a child, you know. And she said no, you stay home.\nSo I said to \u2014 okay, well, can I go downstairs, you know, be on the street? All right,\nbe on the street, but I want you home before too long. So I sai-said fine. So, I ran\ndownstairs with my bathing suit to go swimming, that she had told me not to do.\nAnd I \u2014 in my eagerness to cross the street, didn\u2019t look, and I was hit by a truck.\nAnd I had several fractures and lacerations and concussion and spent three months\nin the hospital. That was an important lesson. But being somewhat reckless, rising\nto whatever challenge that came along, has always been a part of me. I-I was, to\nsome extent, not to make myself some sort of a hero, I was always aggressive. And\nsometimes it got me into trouble, but it never changed my mind. This was in 734. I\nhave another event in \u201937, when \u2014 wh-which had a great impact on my life. There\nwere three boys, and we were walking along the Danube [indecipherable] only a\nthree or four minute walk from where we lived, so \u2014 and this was in the winter of\n\u00b037, late October, when, as we\u2019re walking along, we notice something bobbing up\nand down in the wa \u2014 in the water, and we didn\u2019t know at first what it was. And\nthen we recognized that this was a person, you know, what is she doing in the\nwater? So \u2014 so it dawned on us that this person 1s about to drown. So two of us ran\nOctober 17, 2010\ndown the embankment and jumped into the water. I was 13 \u2014 not quite 13, and my\nfriend was not quite 15. And the third person ran to get the police. So, if you know\nanything about the Danube, and I know, since you are from Hungary, you know\nthe Danube, it\u2019s a very swift river. You\u2019re not going to swim against the current,\nyou just can\u2019t, it just knocks you down. So \u2014 so if you go in here, you\u2019re gonna\ncome out way, way down on the other side. So after a while we \u2014 we struggled, but\nwe were able to get her to th-the embankment and \u2014 and ou-out of the water. And\nby that time, the third person had run to get the police, and when we got to \u2014 when\nwe got her out to the side o-of the river, the police was there, and the ambulance\nwas there. And they picked her up and th \u2014 it was a woman, and they took her away.\nAnd then the police took the two of us to the police station. And there they gave us\nsome hot chocolate and d-dry out. And a man came and started questioning us and\nthen he took a picture. And we paid no attention as to who he was, or what was up,\nwhat \u2014 we were there several hours, and then they said to us, oh, now you can go\nhome. So I went home, and I ha \u2014 I hate to describe to you what took place when I\ngot home. First of all, 1t was Friday evening, and I\u2019m supposed to go with my father\nto the synagogue. And I wasn\u2019t home. And, where were you? [indecipherable] So,\nI was so scared to tell what happened to \u2014 to my mother, so I said, do you know\nwhat? We were playing by the water, and I fell in. Then came, how many times\nOctober 17, 2010\nhave I told you to stay away from the water? When are you finally going to listen,\nand so forth. And \u2014 and wa-was plenty of scolding and reprimand, you know, n-no\nfood, you know, we\u2019re not going to give you anything. And of course I \u2014 I was so\ndisheveled, you know, and tha \u2014 look \u2014 looked terrible. A-And it wasn\u2019t until the\nnext day, when people stopped my mother on the street and started congratulating\nher, and she didn\u2019t know what for. And then she found out that there had been a\npicture in the newspaper, which described what had taken place. And then she came\nback and started questioning, what \u2014 what really happened, you see, so sh-she was\nof two \u2014 two \u2014 two different feelings. In the one, she says, do you realize how\ndangerous it was for you, what you did? A-And, this was very reckless. And the\nother way she \u2014 she was proud that I had participated in \u2014 1n saving a person. But\nth-the recklessness was a major factor, that you would go to such an extreme, which\nwas very, very unusual. And by the way, I have a picture here, as it appeared in a\nnewspaper, blew up and I\u2019ll \u2014 Pll show it to you later; and also comments that were\nabout me specifically. It just so happened that this particular event became a bone\nof contention between the Austrian more or less public press, which for the most\npart was anti-Semitic, and the Jewish press, an-and the Jewish publications, who\ntook the German newspapers to task. It \u2014 1t just so happened that the two boys who\njumped into the water were Jewish. The boy who ran to get the police was Gentile.\nOctober 17, 2010\nIt never occurred to us that this would ever be a problem, but it was a big bone of\ncontention, a big discussion. The \u2014 I mean, in particular th-the Jewish press,\nbecause the Jewi \u2014 the Jews were always characterized as being cowards. Jews \u2014\nJews didn\u2019t want to be in the military, and Jews were afraid and \u2014 and unreliable,\nand \u2014 and they\u2019re not really Austrian and so forth, and \u2014 but here was an example\nwhere two Jewish boys jumped in the water. We didn\u2019t hesitate, we didn\u2019t ask who\nit was, we didn\u2019t ask what religion she was. We just acted because we \u2014 we felt we\n\u2014 we should do something, you see? And I have various correspondence which\nrefers to that particular event, in \u2014 in several organizations who got involved. This\nwas in October or \u2014 late October of 1937. One month later I had my Bar Mitzvah,\nand at the Bar Mitzvah there was a lot of congratulation, because this was only a\nmonth later, and the Kultusgemeinde \u2014 the Kultusgemeinde, it\u2019s called a cultural\nassociation, but really it\u2019s not a cultural association, 1-1t was a sort of a semi-\ngovernment authority for the Jewish people. And every Jew in Austria had to deal\nwith the Kultusgemeinde at least three times in their lives. The Kultusgemeinde\nissued the birth certificate, the marriage certificate and the death certificate. So \u2014 so\nevery Jew had to register with the Kultusgemeinde, which later on also turned out\nto be a detriment for the Jewish people, because when the Nazis came in and\nwanted a list, all they had to do is go to the Kultusgemeinde and have a list of any\nOctober 17, 2010\n\u2014 of a Jew living anywhere in the city. So at that time the Kultusgemeinde\nrepresentative came to the temple, and th-they gave me a di-diploma of recognition\nfor what I had done, and \u2014 and also a watch. And this was the first watch that I had\never owned, so \u2014 so to me that \u2014 that was a big deal.",
        "Q: You mentioned that there was a point of contention between the Jewish press\nand the mainstream press, and then you gave some great background about how\nJews had been perceived, and \u2014 and obviously you being part of this heroic act was\nkind of going counter to the prevailing notion of \u2014 of how a Jew would act. But I\u2019m\ncurious exactly how the Jewish press was making use of this. What were they\nsaying, and what was \u2014 what was the conversation between the two presses?",
        "A: Mostly it \u2014 it dealt \u2014 they were attacking the press for their attitude toward Jews,\nthe reason for their hostility to Jews, and their idiocy as pertaining anti-Semitism.\nAnd their failure to recognize what we had done. The majority of press had nothing,\nno comment whatsoever. There was only one particular newspaper, it\u2019s called \u201cDas\nKleine Blatt,\u201d which carried a small picture of the two of us, and \u2014 and our age, and\nour name, and one paragra \u2014 one sentence, actually; and that was it. An-And no\nother publication \u2014 public \u2014 publication, who certainly at that time in the country, if\nit had been anybody else, it would have been played up big, you see? So, it\u2019s\ninteresting, no attention was \u2014 was paid to it. Forty \u2014 40 years later, my son, who\nOctober 17, 2010\nwas working in Congress, and I had just given an interview in Norfolk, Virginia,\nwhere I was living at the time, and they wrote up the experience that I had, and my\n\u2014my background and so forth. And when he read it, h-he showed it to the\ncongressman. And congressman was Whitehurst from Norfolk. He says well \u2014\nwell, we\u2019ve got to do something, this is not right. So he wrote a letter to the\nambassador, giving him a \u2014 a copy of the article in the newspaper, and that I had\nnever received any recognition. So the ambassador at that time was Thomas\nKlestil. Thomas Klestil went on from the embassy, the ambassador being there in\nWashington, to become the foreign minister of Austria. And then, from the foreign\nministry, became the president of Austria. So the ambassador said that he had\nnever heard of this, but he was going to investigate.",
        "Q: How old was the ambassador?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how old he was. I \u2014 I suppose he was in his 40s, you know. But he\nwould investigate, and it was maybe a couple of months later he came back and said\nyes, we have a record of this. And they arranged a reception for me, and I met the\nambassador, and he asked me if I would be willing to come back at the\ngovernment\u2019s invitation to Austria, they want to honor me. And eventually I was\ngiven a gold medal for heroism, 40 years after the event.",
        "Q: So this would have happened in the 70s and the 80s? When did this happen?\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: I-It probably \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t have the \u2014 th-the date now. It \u2014 probably in the 70s.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a fascinating story. He \u2014",
        "A: It was a \u2014 let\u2019s see now, I\u2019m trying to think. Yeah, \u201978 maybe, something like\nthat. But this is not the end of the story. When Hitler came in, as soon as Hitler and\nthe Nazis took over in Austria, my mother was the driving force. She felt that we\ncould not possibly stay on in Austria, we had to get out. But there were many\npeople at first, when Hitler came in that says, well, you know what\u2019s going on, the\n\u2014 you know, with the plundering of shops and the beating up of Jewish people, and\npeople s-stationing themselves, Nazi personnel in uniform stationing them \u2014 1n front\nof Jewish shops, from \u2014 not to let anybody in. I mean, not to let any Gentiles in to \u2014\nto patronize the Jewish shops. They recognized right away that we cannot live \u2014 go\non living in Austria, we had to get out. So she wrote the letter to, you know, who \u2014\nwho do you write? A cousin of a cousin of a cousin that yo \u2014 she once heard of, and\nso forth. But she wrote a letter and she described our plight, that my \u2014",
        "Q: Where was this cousin? In the United States?",
        "A: Yeah, lived in Baltimore, a-and whether or not he would be willing to send an\naffidavit, and then she asked for an affidavit for my father and my brother, and she\n\u2014 and at that time she felt, you know, let me get the men out. You know, th \u2014\nOctober 17, 2010\nnobody\u2019s going to touch the women, and you know, and children and such, you\nknow, what \u2014",
        "Q: Is this still 1938?",
        "A: This was \u201938, yes. Probably as early as April \u201938. Hitler came in in March, 13\",\nI believe.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry to cut you off all the time, but I\u2019m very interested 1n this progression.\nSo your mother realizes pretty much immediately that there\u2019s danger. So I\u2019m\ncurious about the years \u00b033 through 38. How are your parents, or adults around\nyou, reacting to what was happening in Germany? Did they talk about it at all?\nWere you aware of it?",
        "A: Yes, they talked about it. And \u2014 and we knew about it, but we felt that the\nAustrians are very patriotic, and oh, we are social democrats, and oh \u2014 no,\nAustria\u2019s not going to become involved, you know \u2014 you know, this is Germany.\nAnd communications at that time were not what they are today. So whatever was\nwritten in the paper and so forth, 1-1t was like a different world, going from one\ncountry to the other. You \u2014 you \u2014 actually, you couldn\u2019t go, un-unless you \u2014 you\nhad to have visas. You ri \u2014 you \u2014 you can go to \u2014 to Hungary in an hour and a half,\nI\u2019m in \u2014 1n \u2014 today I\u2019m in Hungary. Not in those days. You had to have a \u2014 a visa\nor \u2014 to leave, and a visa to enter, a-and it was \u2014 you had to have a passport, and it\nOctober 17, 2010\nwas a complicated affair, you know, and \u2014 and transportation was not what it 1s\ntoday. I mean, for me, as a\u2014 as \u2014 as a child, it w \u2014 it was a big deal to \u2014 to get ona\nbus, and to \u2014 and to \u2014 and to get on a streetcar. Oh, oh, that was an exciting event.\nAs a matter of fact, somebody asked me once, how old were you when you first\nrode in a passenger automobile? And the first time I rode in a passenger automobile,\nI-I was a-around 16 years old, in \u2014 in London. In London, trying to take a taxi to \u2014\nto the train station. That was in 1940, you know, and \u2014 and I\u2019d never ridden in a \u2014 in\ntaxi before, but this was the first time.",
        "Q: W-Well, had you taken like a fiaker, you \u2014 you were taking horse-drawn\nbuggies, or there was absolutely no \u2014",
        "A: N-N-N-No, you \u2014 you took a \u2014 first of all, the first means of transportation was\nto walk, you see, that was custom, the \u2014 no matter how far it was, you walked. A-\nAnd aside from walking, you took the streetcar. And if you \u2014 buses were not\navailable, except if you wanted to leave the city, that\u2019s where they had buses. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you ever bicycle?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have a bicycle, no. Because if I had a bicycle, I\u2019d have to drag it up four\nf\u2014 four floors of steps. And I-I think that my parents would have been more\nconcerned with safety, e-even then, because the \u2014 th-they knew that I probably\nwould use the bike to go to areas where they wouldn\u2019t want me to go. Where there\u2019s\nOctober 17, 2010\nmaybe some traffic and so forth. So most of the time I-I just walked. I walked to\nschool.",
        "Q: How long did it take to walk to school?",
        "A: Well, the public school was around the corner, the elementary school. And the\nother one was a little further, m-maybe a 15 minute walk. Now, when I went in\nTalmud Torah School, sometimes I\u2019d see a horse-driven wagon, and we would\njump on that, and when the \u2014 when the driver was \u2014 wasn\u2019t looking, you know. So\nI\u2019?d jump on it and \u2014 and take a ride with him, and then jump off. Which too was not\nthat safe. But that\u2019s what we did.",
        "Q: So amongst your siblings, were you \u2014 were you the \u2014 th-the little devil? The one\nwho always got into trouble, or was your brother similar?",
        "A: No, no, he was very conservative. I \u2014 I was the trouble maker. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhy, but the \u2014 I\u2019ve done that throughout my life, you know, army service, I did\nthings that \u2014 on reflection now, when I think back I says, oh my God, that was\ndumb. And working \u2014 I\u2019m a pharmacist and we \u2014 we \u2014 we had our own business in\nNorfolk, Virginia, and in the 80s, I experienced two hold-ups, and had a gun to my\nhead twice, you know, and you know, people would say, well, were you scared, and\nso forth. I say, yes, of course I \u2014 I was scared, but \u2014 but it \u2014 but one thing I can tell\nyou, I did not panic. Of course, you know, I\u2019m skipping the story back and forth,\nOctober 17, 2010\nmaybe. So \u2014 so the first time that I had a gun to my head, it was by two black men,\nand they wanted Talwin, which mimics opium, but it wasn\u2019t even a narcotic, and I\nwas astonished when they asked for it, you see. But then he asked for my wallet, so\nI gave him my wallet. Then he said to me, kneel down. And I said to him, if you\u2019re\ngoing to shoot me, you\u2019re going to have to look at me, I\u2019m not kneeling. And he\nsays \u2014 and he says, all right. And he turned around and walked \u2014 and ran out. By the\nway, he got shot and killed two days later, trying to rob another pharmacy. The\nsecond time maybe was \u2014 maybe three \u2014 three weeks later, and this time it was by\ntwo whites. And they were more knowledgeable, they were prepared. They came\nwith an empty pillowcase, and they knew \u2014 they probably had shopped us, and they\nknew where I kept the narcotics. So \u2014 so they wanted the morphine, and the\nDilaudid and the Demerol, and the codeine and opium and so forth that we had; so\nthey got all of that. And then, you know, he\u2019s holding a pistol, while the other one is\nloading up on \u2014 on whatever we had in narcotics. And then he said to me, ge \u2014 let\nme have your wallet. So I said to him, let me \u2014I says, give me \u2014 give you my\nwallet? I says, do you realize what problems that is? I says, I gotta run here and\nthere to get new identification and new driver\u2019s license. I got to stop all the credit\ncards, I says, it\u2019s a whole lot of trouble. And so he says, all right, keep the wallet.\nAnd people couldn\u2019t believe, you \u2014 you actually did that? I says, yes. So, I\u2014I-\nOctober 17, 2010\nthroughout life, I don\u2019t panic. I-I size up the situation a-as to what I need to do and\n\u2014 and act accordingly. And \u2014 and I feel that when you panic, then many times the\nperson who is the aggressor, will also panic, and then you don\u2019t know what to\nexpect. People would ask me, they would \u2014 found it strange that the first time that\nyou were held up, you had two blacks, right? Yeah. And the second time it was two\nwhites? Yeah. Don\u2019t you find it strange? I says, no, I says, my \u2014 my pharmacy was\nan equal opportunity pharmacy. So \u2014 so they \u2014 they would laugh, it was fun. But\nafter that, I hired the police to come in and \u2014 an-and they were \u2014 every \u2014 every\nafternoon and evening I would have police in \u2014 in the pharmacy, and my sons urged\nme, you know, it\u2019s time to get out. You know, you \u2014 you can\u2019t keep this up.\nBecause it was true, because you \u2014 you become apprehensive that every time the\ndoor opens, you don\u2019t know who 1s coming in. And the problem with drugs today in\nAmerica is so \u2014 so pervasive, that you just don\u2019t know what to anticipate. A-And\nyou live and work in a form of tension. So although I was only 59 at the time, I \u2014 I\ndecided to call it quits. I sold the pharmacy and retired at 59. And I took a three\nmonth vacation, you know, traveled to Europe; your country, Hungary, I was there\nfor about a month. Enjoyed it. A-And when I came back I was restless and didn\u2019t\nknow what to do, so I went to work for the navy, the navy hospital in the \u2014 as a\npharmacist. And I worked until the 90s a-and then I quit a-and stopped working.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "Q: Well, now we\u2019ve gotten a bit ahead of ourselves.",
        "A: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to Vienna, and \u2014 and I \u2014 I was very curious about one thing. You\nsaid that during the \u2014 this heroic rescue, you had one friend with you who was non-\nJewish. Did you have many non-Jewish friends, and \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. Was he the only one?",
        "A: Yes. He happened to live on the floor below us. And it was interesting that when\nHitler came in, although we were very close friends, he stopped me on the\nstairways one day, and he told me that Herbert, you understand that we can\u2019t be\nfriends any longer. So I said yes, I understand. An-And that was the end, I thought.\nA couple days later, we meet up again on the steps, and th \u2014 he stopped me, and he\nsaid, would I do him a favor? I says, what \u2014 what is it you \u2014 you want? He says,\nwell, I need a pair of white socks, and I know you have some. Would you loan me\nyour white socks? So I said, well, why do you need my white socks? He says, well,\nhe says, you know, he says, I belong to the Hitlerjugend, and white socks are part\nof the uniform. And I was told to stand downstairs in front of Herr Gros\u2019(ph) shop,\nto make sure that no Christian people go in. So I need the socks. So I\u2014 his name\nwas Bertie. So I said, Bertie, I \u2014 I\u2014 I have no idea where the socks are, or if I still\nOctober 17, 2010\nhave them. I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think that I have it. And maybe he understood that \u2014\nwhat I was saying, but I\u2014 I gave him no socks. But as close a friend we were,\novernight, Hitlerjugend, y-you know \u2014 you know. And this was the biggest\nsurprise that I had, that the \u2014 the very same people who lived with you in \u2014 in the\nhouse, an-a-and knew the family and \u2014 and guten tag and guten naft(ph) and this\nand that an-and they\u2019re friendly, and suddenly yo \u2014 tell you they have been in the\nunderground f-for years, under \u2014 as Nazis. And this is unbelievable. I remember \u2014",
        "Q: Th-They told you that?",
        "A: Yeah, when Hitler came in. They said, yeah, we been in underground. I\nremember a neighbor came in that we were very friendly with \u2014 as a matter of fact,\nthe family \u2014 they were a tailor, and my folks wanted to have a \u2014 a big table when\nthey had the reception after the Bar Mitzvah, th \u2014 in our apartment. They didn\u2019t\nhave a big enough table so we \u2014 so they loaned us the \u2014 that \u2014 their work table\nwhere they made suits or coats or whatever the \u2014 a tailor does. So \u2014 so \u2014 so the\nwoman came over, Frau Bodichka(ph), and she\u2019s friends with my mother a-and\nshe\u2019s saying to my mother, you have nothing to fear. Yo-You are good Jews.\nNobody\u2019s going to touch you. But, she says, maybe the people who live across the\nstreet, she says, maybe they got it coming to them. And as young as I was at the\ntime, you know, just 13 years old, I said \u2014 I says, how do I know that the people\nOctober 17, 2010\nacross the street aren\u2019t saying the same thing about us? You see, but wa \u2014 one thing\nthat I-I later became aware of, that 1-if I was 13, it was just a number. I really\novernight became an adult. A-And you recognize right away that things are not\ngoing to be the way they were. And for instance, when my mother had written to\nAmerica, to distant cousins for an affidavit, they responded and were willing to\nsend the affidavit. But I was going to be there, wi \u2014 stay in Vienna. And I felt I was\nju \u20141n as much \u2014 in as much danger as anybody else. And there was a Jewish boy\nacross the str-street, Teddy Katz, he told me one day, let\u2019s run away. Don\u2019t say\nanything to anybody, we\u2019ll run away. I says, where do you want to run? He says,\nwell, we\u2019ll go to Czechoslovakia. I says, who do we know in Czechoslovakia? I\nsays, ha \u2014 I says, we have no money. I says \u2014 I says re \u2014 we gonna cross the border\nillegally? Yes. I says, when we get there, then what? So, I said no, I \u2014 I \u2014 it just\ndoesn\u2019t make any sense. But I wanted to get out, so I had registered with what was\nknown then as the Palestina(ph) office, the Pales-Palestine office, for aliyah. But \u2014\nbut I didn\u2019t hear. So I deci \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2014I\u2019m sorry to cut you off again, but this is another point that I\u2019m particularly\ninterested in. What was your family\u2019s relationship to Zionism as you were growing\nup?",
        "A: None.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "Q: So, registering with the Palestina(ph) office, this was something completely\nnew? It hadn\u2019t been in your mind before?",
        "A: Oh, no, I had no intention of going to Palestine, or \u2014 for the most part, you\nknow, life was okay. You know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s our country, you know, I\u2019m Austrian. I\nwas very patriotic, you know, because it\u2019s drilled into you in school, you know, and\nyou know, Austria, our homeland and the Austrian history, Austrian-Hungarian\nempire, the Kaiser and so forth, so \u2014 so \u2014 the imperial Austria, oh we \u2014 we stopped\nthe \u2014 the Turks when they attacked and \u2014 and if you go downs \u2014 downtown in the\nfirst district, you can see where the \u2014 the last shell is still imbedded in \u2014 in the\nconcrete and so forth. S-So Austrians are quite patriotic. But th \u2014 I felt that I was in\ndanger, and I wanted to get out of the country, especially after Kristallnacht. On\nKristallnacht, after the assassination of the diplomat in Paris, and with Hershel\nGrynszpan, who shot the embassy personnel in \u2014 in Paris. It wasn\u2019t ambassador,\nbut the \u2014 an assistant to the ambassador, whatever his position was, I don\u2019t recall.\nBut I knew that something was going to happen, that there would be revenge. I\nmean, I-I just \u2014 you \u2014 you could almost smell it in the air, that something was going\nto happen.",
        "Q: This is November *38?",
        "A: Yes.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "Q: But the annexation happened \u2014",
        "A: In March.",
        "Q: \u2014 at the beginning of that year.",
        "A: In March.",
        "Q: Ca-Can you tell me whether \u2014 how things were going in th \u2014 in that six month\nperiod, leading up to Kristallnacht? How many things were changing?",
        "A: Well, I can tell you I\u2014 I was a\u2014 a member of the Hakura(ph) swim team.\nHakura(ph) means strength. And I was member of the swim team. On March the\n10\", I believe it was a Thursday, I had just gone there for a practice session. When I\nwalked out, I saw a large mass of people, and were yelling and screaming, and as \u2014\nas a kid I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m always attracted to something that \u2014 that\u2019s different as a \u2014 I want\nto know what\u2019s going on. So \u2014 so I approached them, that was only across the street\nfrom Dianabad(ph). I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re acquainted with Vienna or not. So, if\nyou cross the street you come to Schwedenzplatz(ph), so \u2014 so there they had a big\ndemonstration. Gra \u2014 a great mass of people, with this social democratic flag and\nwhatnot. And on \u2014 and the police standing in front of me. And on the other side, a\nsmall group of Nazis, and yelling at each other, and so forth. This was Thursday.\nAnd on Sunday we\u2019re gonna have a plevicide whether or not Austria wants to join\nwith Hitler. This wa \u2014 this was by order of the chancellor of Austria, Schuschnigg,\nOctober 17, 2010\nKurt Schuschnigg. So when I saw that, I says oh, Austrians will never vote for\nHitler. As I \u2014 so as \u2014 I really wasn\u2019t concerned until the next evening, when over\nthe radio, suddenly I heard that the plevicide had been cancelled, and the\ngovernment had abdicated, and new people were coming to \u2014 into government, and\nthey were all Nazi officials. I says \u2014 then I recognized re \u2014 this does not sound\ngood. Something is gonna happen. And it \u2014 and true enough, why \u2014 on Sunday,\nGerman troops marched in, and announce a gov \u2014 overthrew the government, and\nwe \u2014 we were part of Germany. We had been annexed, or anschluss. And this \u2014\nand suddenly we\u2019re oven \u2014 over-overnight we\u2019re pri \u2014 night, I was confident that\nAustria would never become part of Germany, suddenly e-everyone \u2014 everyone\nthat you met wu \u2014 seemingly seemed to be connected to \u2014 with the Nazi party all\nalong, in the underground [indecipherable]. And everybody ha-had this \u2014 the\narmband on with the Nazi insignia, and flags all over the city, and I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand how suddenly people that I \u2014 I felt 1f you give them the chance to vote\nwould have voted against the Nazis, now everybody seemed to be for it. The \u2014 the\ncardinal of Austria, Innitzer, welcomed Hitler as, you know, the native son\nreturning to his country and so forth, and \u2014 and 1t seemed so unbelievable, how\novernight something as dramatic a-as a \u2014 as giving away everything and becoming a\ndevoted Nazi, a-and the Jewish people going to be the target, you see, because we\nOctober 17, 2010\nheard it con-consistently, with the editor of the newspapers, or ev \u2014 ev \u2014 everything\nbecame pro-Nazis, a-and you saw no opposition whatsoever. Everybody was for the\nNazis. And the people were f-for the Nazis. Either that, or afraid, because\nseemingly 100 percent were not necessarily in favor of what was taking place, but it\nseemed to be the vast majority were. And the plundering took place, and the beating\ntook place and the dem \u2014 the humiliation took place, you know, all the graffiti that\nhad been anti-Nazi \u2014 they take elderly Jewish people, and sometimes religious\npeople, whoever they were, peop-people of recognition, professional people, you\nknow, and would humiliate them, give him a toothbrush and tell him to scrub the\nstreets and so forth, and spit at them and make fun. And the people would stand\naround and laugh.",
        "Q: And this is still the run-up to Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, before. Could \u2014 could we stop one second?",
        "Q: Yes, absolutely.",
        "A: I-I want to go to the bathroom.",
        "Q: Absolutely. Stop the track. [break] Okay.",
        "A: Where wer \u2014 where are we now?\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "Q: We are at the preceding events that are leading up to Kristallnacht.",
        "A: On Kristallnacht, no \u2014 November nine, we saw what was going on on the street,\nthat the shops are being plundered, a-and the Jewish people are \u2014 on the street were\nbeing beaten up, so you\u2019re afraid to \u2014 as to what may happen. And the greatest fear\nwas to hear the knock on the door. When you \u2014 when you heard that knock on the\ndoor, we froze. And I could see the expression on my \u2014 my father and my mother\u2019s\nface, and I \u2014 and I knew they \u2014 they were scared. And it passes onto the children\nwhen you \u2014 wh-when they see that the \u2014 the parents are \u2014 are frightened. And the \u2014\nthere\u2019s a knock on the door and the order, open up. So, we opened up the door, and\nto \u2014 two uniformed SA people walked in, one a little older tha-than the other one.\nThe other one licked \u2014 looked to be sa \u2014 someone maybe 18 or 19 years old,\nsomething like that. And they demanded to see my brother, specifically asking for\nba \u2014 for him by his name, but he was not home. So they didn\u2019t believe it, so they\nwent through the apartment, searching for him, and he wasn\u2019t there. So, since he\nwasn\u2019t there, one of them, the elderly one said, we\u2019ll take him, pointing to me. And\nit was then that my mother started pleading and crying, saying he 1s only a little\nboy, he hasn\u2019t done anything, and please leave him alone, you know \u2014 you know,\njust begging him. And \u2014 and it was then that the younger SA man said, it wasn\u2019t\nhim. Tha-That\u2019s it, it wasn\u2019t him. And they said oh \u2014 okay, we\u2019ll come back in a\nOctober 17, 2010\nlittle while. So, when I heard it wasn\u2019t him, a-as I \u2014 I surmised that maybe my\nbrother had gotten into a fight, and now was the time to get even, you see. And the\nmere fact that it wasn\u2019t him, saved me. And because my mother, as soon as they\nleft, told me to run downstairs and intercept my brother from coming home, and\ntelling him to stay with a friend, not to come home. And \u2014 and then she sent me to\ntell my uncle not to go home, and to stay with his mother-in-law. That was\ninteresting too, and h-he \u2014 he told me later on, that they came to his mother-in-law\u2019s\nhome, you know, everybody knew already where most likely somebody would \u2014\nwould go if you want to pick him up. And when he heard the knock on the door, he\ncrawled under the table, and the table had a long tablecloth. So they were searching\nthe house, the \u2014 the apartment that they lived in, and they didn\u2019t see him. And they\nwere pounding the table, saying well, you be sure to \u2014 to let us know as soon as he\ncomes here. Well, he was under the table. He survived. His wife and his son did not\nsurvive. But i-it was, th-the following day, on the 10\u201c of November, when I wa \u2014\nwas on my way to go to the Palestina(ph) office to check on the \u2014 on my aliyah,\nwhich is immigration to then known Palestine or Israel. When I came downstairs, I\nsaw a\u2014a big truck and a lot of people around the truck jeering and laughing and\nenjoying themselves. And the police is there also, just standing there. And I was\nwondering what the heck is going on here, what\u2019s it all about, you know? And \u2014 and\nOctober 17, 2010\nthe house right next door to us, there was a shop, a shop carrying bedding\nequipment, blankets and pillows and pillowcases and towels and stuff like that. And\nI noticed that they were carrying stuff out from the shop, and putting it on the truck.\nWell, you recognize right away, it doesn\u2019t take long, as to what\u2019s going on. They\u2019re\njust confiscating whatever goods he has and putting it on the truck. And then I saw\nthe owner standing there beside the \u2014 the shop. Hi-His name was shp \u2014 H-Herr\nSchpringer(ph). A Mr. Schpringer(ph). A-And he\u2019s white-faced, scared. And\nwhen they had just about emptied the shop, Mr. \u2014 Herr Schpringer(ph), being a\nbusiness man, walks up to the head honcho Nazi there, and asks for a receipt. And\nth-the storm trooper turned around and yelled to the crowd, Herr Schpringer(ph)\nwants a receipt. And everybody starts laughing and cheering and screaming. And\nthen he grabs Schpringer(ph) by the neck, the collar of his neck, and turned him\naround and gave him a kick in the rear, and Schpringer(ph) fell down on the\npavement. And he said, here Jew, this is your receipt. I \u2014 I witnessed that. A-And I-I\nfelt that even going to the aliyah office may not be such a good idea. I says \u2014 so I\ndecided to go to the home of the chief rabbi.",
        "Q: Now, let me cut you off once again, cause this 1s very interesting, the dynamics\nof this. You\u2019re witnessing this, does that mean you\u2019re a part of the crowd? Where\nare you standing?\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: Just standing be \u2014 not part. I\u2019m standing ba \u2014 little distance away, y-you know,\nmaybe \u2014 but I\u2019m a \u2014 nobody\u2019s paying any attention to me, you see, I\u2019m just a kid.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t feel like you were in danger of being recognized as a Jew?",
        "A: Y-Y-You know \u2014 you know, a-again, I-I did things a-as a kid, that when I reflect\nnow, I says, this was really stupid. I mean th \u2014 I had no awareness. I \u2014 spontaneous\nresponse to different things. For instance, if I told you I saw Eichmann, and asked\nhim to put a country on my passport, it\u2019s only years later that I even became aware\nwho he was. I had no idea Eichmann, I never heard of him. But I went to \u2014 to the\nRothschild palace, which was the Nazi headquarters, and I walked in there \u2014 well,\nwhen you walk in there, everything is heil Hitler, you know, an-and I\u2019m not going\nto come in and say heil Hitler, so wha-what am I going to say? Griiss gott. Which\nwas the way we normally greeted each other, griiss gott, and \u2014 greet God. And \u2014\nand everybody looks up, you know, what\u2019s this Jewish kid doing here? You see, so\nI asked \u2014 when Eichmann asked me what it is I want, and I told him, I need to get a\ncountry entered \u2014 because I ca \u2014 I can\u2019t remember exactly what \u2014 you had to choose\non the passport what country you n \u2014 had to have on the passport. And if it wasn\u2019t\nlisted, then you couldn\u2019t go to that country. And England wasn\u2019t listed. I never\nthought of going to England. And so of course, this is somewhat later.\n35October 17, 2010",
        "Q: So I\u2019m going to stop the track right now, we\u2019re going to switch tracks, one\nsecond.\nEnd of File Two\nOctober 17, 2010\nBeginning File Three",
        "Q: All right, we\u2019re on track three. So, let \u2014 let me just stop you, and \u2014 in terms of\nthe chronology. So you \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, because \u2014 because I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not t-telling you step by step.",
        "Q: Well, this is very exciting, but \u2014 but I \u2014 I just \u2014 I want to get my bearings in the\nstory. So you witness Herr Schpringer being brutalized, and you decide that\nmaybe you should go to the Palestina(ph) organization, but then \u2014",
        "A: Oh, orig \u2014 originally had planned to go, th-then I said to myself, no, no, this may\nbe too dangerous. So \u2014 so I went to \u2014 actually, it wasn\u2019t that night either, on\nrecollection. I\u2014 I went \u2014 I did go to the aliyah office. I\u2019m sorry, I had to correct\nmyself. I went to the aliyah office, a-and when I came there, it was packed with\npeople; men and women. And I wasn\u2019t there very long when the SS showed up, and\nthey sent men to one side, and the women and children to the other side. And I had\nhad my Bar Mitzvah, so it came up to me to decide which side should I go on? And\nI felt that maybe I better play it safe. So I decided to go with the women, although\nyou know, people who had had their Bar Mitzvah, they regard themselves already\nas men. But, you know, I \u2014 I says, I \u2014 I better play it safe. And it wasn\u2019t very long\nthereafter, when we had separated and we were in different rooms, that all the men\nwere taken away by truck. And later on I learned that they had been taken to\nOctober 17, 2010\nDachau. Had I stayed with the men, I would have wound up in Dachau, but I was\nwith the women. So they kept us there for an hour, an hour and a half, til they\ndecided what to do with us, what \u2014 they let us go. And here again comes the\nrecklessness. They let us go, and I\u2019m going out on the s \u2014 from the building. So I\nthought that more and more men will be coming to the building, and they\u2019re gonna\nget arrested, and maybe I ought to warn them. But in back of me, there\u2019s an SS\nman, right in the building. If you\u2019ve been to Vienna, I am \u2014 the building 1s still\nthere, and it\u2019s not far \u2014 the Hotel Metropol was Gestapo headquarters. It\u2019s only one\nblock away. And maybe two blocks away is the Kultusgemeinde on the Juden \u2014\non the Judengasse. So this was in the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the Aurelia street, you see,\nwhich on \u2014 only short walk where the aliyah office was. Years later I took my wife\nthere and I showed her where it was. A-And so I stood at the edge of the \u2014 the\npavement \u2014 pedes \u2014 pedestrian pavement, not the street, and as men were\napproaching me to go into the building, I would turn my head away and say, don\u2019t\ngo in, Gestapo. And invariably, they would say, what did you say? And I would\nrepeat, you know, but not looking directly at him, as if I \u2014 but the Gestapo in back\nof me was a trooper, noticed that people were coming up to me and turned around\nand walking away. So a-after three or four had done this, he comes out and yells for\nme to come back. And he wants to know, what did you say to the men? Was hast\nOctober 17, 2010\ndu gesagt? I says, I didn\u2019t say anything, I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014I-\u2014I said I\u2014 oh, you said\nsomething. I said, the only thing I said was I was here for some time and I just got\nout. That I waited a long time, but I just got out. That\u2019s not what you said, tell me\nwhat you said. So I stuck by my story. So yeah, they \u2014 he wanted \u2014 he really beat\nme, and then he kicked me down the steps. There were about three steps as \u2014 as you\nentered the building. So I fell over the three steps, and I got up, and I ran away.",
        "Q: Now, when you were turning people away, were you turning any passerby away,\nor did you know who \u2014",
        "A: No, people were coming from the other side, apparently they \u2014 they may have\ncome from the Kultusgemeinde, approaching aliyah office, you see. I don\u2019t know\nif the Kultusgemeinde was open at that time or not, because this was right \u2014\nKristallnacht.",
        "Q: This is November 10\".",
        "A: Yes. This is still part of the \u2014 the pogrom.",
        "Q: So whoever is passing by at that point is \u2014 is Jewish, because that\u2019s the section of\nthe \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, so you knew that these people are in danger?",
        "A: Oh \u2014- oh yeah, yeah.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. And I knew if they got into the building they\u2019d get arrested. And the \u2014\nmany years later, I felt that what I did at that time probably was more dangerous\nthan jumping into the Danube. And didn\u2019t even think of it, I just acted spontaneous.\nIt came to my mind that I can \u2014 I wish I had a name, or had recognized who \u2014 who\nany of these people were, but I had no idea. But you know, once I \u2014 I fell down the\nsteps, and you know, I had the black eye and I went home and my mother, she was\nreally in \u2014 in a panic. She says, we told you to stay home, we told you not to go\nhere, and told you this and that, you know, that \u2014 berated, you know, because\nparental concern, they know that when you\u2019re home, you know, at least we know\nwho you are or where you are, and \u2014 a-and we don\u2019t worry. But once a child \u2014 a-and\nI don\u2019t know if you have children yet, but when y \u2014 when you do, y-you become\naware that if you don\u2019t know where the child is, you begin to worry.",
        "Q: Had you succeeded in intercepting your brother?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What happened to your brother?",
        "A: Yeah, I intercepted him, told him not to come home, and he went with a friend.\nBut he \u2014 the f \u2014 it was on the following day that I decided, first of all, it was useless\nOctober 17, 2010\nto go to the Kultusgemeinde, because the Kultusgemeinde, th-the line was for\nblocks, people standing 1n line, trying to get into the building to see the officials.",
        "Q: What were they hoping for?",
        "A: An idea, information, maybe financial help because nobody was working, y-y-\nyou see, SO yo-you want to eat, you see, you need money. So maybe \u2014 maybe they\u2019 Il\nget a tip, which country, anywhere in the world, affords an opportunity that you can\ngo to and so forth. I-I decided that s-since I was known, with the notoriety of saving\nthis girl, that maybe this could be of help to me. So I went to see Israel Taglicht, a\nrabbi asr \u2014 Israel Taglicht, who was the chief rabbi of Vienna. I \u2014 I still remember,\nit was the first time I had been in \u2014 at his residence [indecipherable] really f\u2014\nbeautiful home, the flush red carpet. Cause this something that I hadn\u2019t seen before,\nyou see, so I rem \u2014 I remembered the red carpet. And he asked me what he could do\nfor me, a-and I asked him, you know, that I had applied for aliyah, I hadn\u2019t heard, is\nthere anything th \u2014 he could help me with. So, h-he refers me to see the executive\nsecretary of the Kultusgemeinde, who was Josef Lowenherz, Dr. Josef\nLowenherz, and he f \u2014 phoned him apparently, and he got through to him and I had\na pass. So, the following day, I went to see Lowenherz, and I didn\u2019t have to stand\nin line. I see all these people standing in line and he does \u2014 right away e \u2014 allowed\nto enter, with this pass. And I came to his office, and he knew about me, he knew\nOctober 17, 2010\nabout having saved this girl, and he said, you know, what can I do for you? And I\ntold him again I had applied for aliyah, I hadn\u2019t heard, can he do anything for me?\nAnd it was then that he lifted the phone, and he started talking to somebody. And it\nwas all about a Kindertransport. And, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. So\nwhen he put the phone down, I says, what \u2014 what is the Kindertransport? So he\nexplained to me that he is in negotiation with Eichmann. He didn\u2019t say Eichmann,\nhe said the Nazis. He did not know whether he\u2019s gonna be successful or not, but the\nidea is to have a transport of 1,000 children; 800 would go to England, the first\n800. The last 200 would be dropped off in Holland. And he said to me, I don\u2019t\nknow whether we will be successful in negotiation with Nazi authorities, he says,\nbut if you like, he says, Ill put your name on the list. So I said yes, what I got to\nlose, I says, yeah, put my name on the list, and I didn\u2019t think anything o-of \u2014 more\nabout it. I went home, and again where have you been, and this or that, you \u2014 why\naren\u2019t you \u2014 how many times to we have to tell you to stay home and so the litany\nof \u2014 of complaints that my mother had. But it was a \u2014 a week later that I was\nnotified that I\u2019d been \u2014 I had been chosen to participate in the transport.",
        "Q: How did your parents react?\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: Th-They was fine. I was old enough that I want to get out. My mother was\nsatisfied that all the men, so c \u2014 old men will be go out of the way, a-and it will just\nbe my mother and my sister.",
        "Q: At this \u2014 at this point, has your father and uncle been successful in leaving the\ncountry?",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 no, they \u2014 they\u2019re still there, they \u2014 but they have received the affidavit.\nAnd now the problem was w-we had to find the money for pa-passage. And they\ngot assistance for \u2014 some money that came from the cousin, and \u2014 and some money\nthey had saved up. Other than that, I don\u2019t know if they got anything from the\nKultusgemeinde or not. I just don\u2019t know. But I\u2014 I knew when I left that my father\nwas going to \u2014 I left in December, and \u2014 and my father was leaving in January. See,\nth-they had the visa and then \u2014 and the affidavit. It was a week after I had talked to\nDr. Lowenherz that I was notified to participate in the Kindertransport, which\nwas to leave on the \u2014 late at night, it was around 10 o\u2019clock at night from a station \u2014\nnot the Westbahnhof. Many people will tell you I left from the Westbahnhof, they\ndidn\u2019t leave from the Westbahnhof, the \u2014 they left from one station afterward,\ncalled Hutteldorf. And the requirements as to \u2014 we were given a notification as to\nwhat we would \u2014 allowed \u2014 were allowed to take out of the country. And it\u2019s\ninteresting, you were not allowed to take anything out of the country, including\nOctober 17, 2010\nclothing that was new. Anything that you took out of the country had to be in your\npossession one year ahead of time, \u201937. And \u2014",
        "Q: How would you prove this?",
        "A: Y-You know, at that time, I didn\u2019t think of it, but we obeyed it, yeah. It\u2019s a \u2014\nnobody, as far as I know \u2014 I mean, I have no way of knowing, but my \u2014 my parents\ndid not buy anything, a pair of socks, o-or a shirt, or underwear, no-none of that. It\nwas true that then \u2014 everything that I took with me, I had had be-before. And \u2014 and\nunder penalty of punishment, whatever the punishment would have been, my father\nhad to swear a signed affidavit, that whatever I was taking out had been in my\npossession as of 1937. An-And by the way, I have that document, with his\nsignature, you see.",
        "Q: What\u2019s happening to your brother at this point?",
        "A: Well, he left with my father in \u2014 in January of \u201939.",
        "Q: So then, the \u2014 the three male members of your family leave together in the \u2014\nJanuary of \u201939, your father, your uncle and your brother?",
        "A: No, no, my uncle had nothing to do with this.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It\u2019s just my fa \u2014 my uncle, before they left, my uncles \u2014 I \u2014 I took him to the\ntrain station, he was smuggling himself across the border into Yugoslavia to go to\nOctober 17, 2010\nPalestine because it \u2014 1-illegal immigration was more productive and successful\nthan trying to wait for admission by any authorit \u2014 any country. You\u2019re not\nsupposed to be in Yugoslavia, you\u2019re not supposed to be in Italy wi-without p-\npermit, and \u2014 which you couldn\u2019t get, so you \u2014 you just crossed the border.",
        "Q: Di-Did he take a train? How was he going to cross the border?",
        "A: Yo-You get to the border, the Austrian border, and you get off the train. And\nthen at night, th \u2014 wi\u2014 there was a smuggling operation going on at that time.\nPeople got paid to take you, and \u2014 and th \u2014 and I-I guess there was bribery to look\nanother way in the \u2014 you know, th-that must have gone on for a long time.",
        "Q: And this is the winter of 38, when he\u2019s escaping to Yugoslavia? It\u2019s after\nKristallnacht?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, no December \u2014",
        "Q: December.",
        "A: December \u00b038, yes. What day? I don\u2019t know, maybe a third week of December,\nor the second week of December. No, it had to be \u2014 it had to be probably the first\nweek of December, because I left on \u2014 on my birthday, the 11\", so it had to be\nbefore that, cause I took him to the train. A-Again, there was [indecipherable]\nnobody else. Even when any kind of form needed to be filled out, they called on\nme. My \u2014 my parents, to a large extent felt that I would know what to do, you see.\nOctober 17, 2010\nSo \u2014 so the \u2014 my brother would do something foolish, you see, so \u2014 so he \u2014 and he\u2019s\nsmaller \u2014 see, my brother was taller. So he\u2019s taller [indecipherable] more of a\nchild, you know, tha-that \u2014 he \u2014",
        "Q: Nobody suspects a child.",
        "A: Ye-Yeah, he can get by, you see. Maybe they \u2014 their judgment was correct in \u2014\nin that respect.",
        "Q: So what happens to your uncle? Does he get through to Yugoslavia?",
        "A: He wa \u2014 he got through Yugoslavia, and Romania, into Turkey and from\nTurkey to Israel. His wife was left behind, and his son was left behind. And they\nwere deported. You didn\u2019t ask me about my friend, who was \u2014",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about your friend.",
        "A: \u2014 who was involved with me in saving the girl. We had, you know, when \u2014 when\nyou think back, you know, as \u2014 as children, the type of conversation that we had\ncompared to the conversation that kids have in this country, yeah, you know, it was\na \u2014 it was unbelievable. You\u2019re talking about life and death, and they\u2019re talking\nabout football, or baseball, you know. So I \u2014 his name was Ernst, I used to call him\nErnsty(ph). I said, why don\u2019t you try to get out also? He couldn\u2019t get on the\nKindertransport. He was two years older, so the cut-off age was, at that time was\n16, and he \u2014 he was almost 17. He says \u2014 in any event, he says, I \u2014 I can\u2019t leave my\nOctober 17, 2010\nparents. The sister had left for Israel, she had made aliyah early o-of ?38. So he \u2014\nhe s \u2014 he said, in any event, he says, you know, my \u2014 my father 1s \u2014 1s a decorated\nfrom World War I, and he says, I can understand where they\u2019ll bother you because\nyou \u2014 you \u2014 your parents are \u2014",
        "Q: One \u2014 one moment.",
        "A: So-\u2014so he \u2014 he felt that his father having been a veteran of the World War I, and\ndecorated and you know, au \u2014 Austrian citizen to begin with, whereas my parents\nwere naturalized. And nothing is gonna happen to us. So \u2014 so I\u2014 he wasn\u2019t too \u2014 he\nsays, in your case, your \u2014 your parents are Polish originally, and he says yeah, I can\nsee where \u2014 so he stayed and what would happen eventually is that like everybody\nelse, they were kicked out of the apartment. I was in England ba \u2014 by that time and\nlost contact. My problem also was, I had no money. Somebody was give me \u2014 have\nto give me a stamp. Then sometimes I got a postcard from someone. And that\u2019s the\nonly means I had to write. And I heard nothing any more fr-from Ernsty(ph). Later\non I heard that the parents were deported to Theresienstadt, and they died there.\nAnd he was living with some girl in the second district, and they were deported\n[indecipherable] down here. And when they arrived in \u2014 in Poland, the following\nday they were all shot, including him. And tha-that was what \u2014 I didn\u2019t hear that\nuntil the end of the war. I had no idea that \u2014 often wondered what happened to him,\nOctober 17, 2010\nbut we never knew. Of course, I didn\u2019t know what happened to my uncle, I didn\u2019t\nknow what happened to my cousins or my aunt, or \u2014 or my grandparents or, you\nknow, in \u2014 in Poland my father\u2019s parents\u2019 family, most of them are still in Radom,\nand there were 10 brothers and sisters. And they \u2014 and they had married and they\nhad children. Nobody survived. So that \u2014 that was one aspect. I don\u2019t know where I\nam 1-1-in \u2014 in this story, yo-yo-you better take me back to \u2014",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: \u2014a particular event, or \u2014",
        "Q: Well, what I'd like to know at this point is, what\u2019s happening to your sister? Is\nshe just staying home and \u2014",
        "Q: She \u2014 she was two years younger, so she was around 11, and she stayed home.\nAnd in the meantime, while I\u2019m in England, I am \u2014 e-even today 1-it bothers me, I-I\nam put in a very, very stressful position. My uncle writes to me \u2014 and this is my\nmother\u2019s brother \u2014 the other uncle was my father\u2019s brother. But he writes to me that\nhe\u2019s smuggled himself across the border into Italy. And he says, help me, I\u2019m\neating grass. [phone ringing] And do you \u2014 are you getting the phone I\u2019m hearing?\n[break]",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re back on. He writes to you and you\u2019re in England and he says that\nhe\u2019s eating grass.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, a-and help me. Well, I-I\u2019m 14 years old, I have no money. Absolutely not\n\u2014 not one penny, nothing. And I don\u2019t speak the language. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s\ngoing on. I\u2019m at this place in Dovercourt in Lowestoft(ph), freezing cold. I mean,\nthis cabin, no running water. Every bit of clothing that I had, ?\u2019m\u2014I?\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m\nputting it on at night, trying to stay warm, and \u2014 because we\u2019re right on the ocean,\nand this wintertime. I couldn\u2019t stay warm. So aft \u2014 they gave us sort of a canister,\nwas supposed to be filled with hot water, and \u2014 and when I woke up in the morning\nthe second night, it was \u2014 it was frozen ice. And I said, you know, to \u2014 to my friend\nwho is staying with me, I says, you know, I can\u2019t take this any more, I says, I\u2019m not\ngonna stay here. So \u2014 so I just took the blanket, and I went into the dining hall, and\nthere they had a fireplace, and I put the blanket on the floor. And for the rest of the\ntime that I was at this camp, I slept on the floor in front of the dining place, ju-just\nha-had to stay warm. But this is a different story now. As far as my uncle is\nconcerned, he writes to me from time to time that he \u2014 he also has no money, and\nhe\u2019s hungry. And then in one letter he\u2019s saying that \u2014 now that you\u2019re safe and out\nof the country, it\u2019s your responsibility to help me, to help me get out of the country.\nWell \u2014 well, I get this letter, a-and then o-on a \u2014 on a personal note from my\nmother, she\u2019s getting, as time goes on, more worried and more concerned. My\nfather is in United States, a good looking man, and maybe it went on in her head\nOctober 17, 2010\nthat maybe he\u2019s met somebody, which later on I hear, was not that unusual. So sh \u2014\nthe pressure went on, with me caught in the middle. She\u2019s writing to me that he\u2019s\nnot doing anything to help her get out of the country. In the meantime, he\u2019s in this\ncountry, he doesn\u2019t speak English. He doesn\u2019t know who is what, or where to go or\nwhat do you do. He doesn\u2019t have any money either. He\u2019s dependent upon the\nassistance from \u2014 from the distant cousins who have no relation whatso-whatsoever.\nI don\u2019t know what their finances were at the time. So, you know, one letter I get,\nthat I should write to my father, that if he doesn\u2019t do something to help my mother\nto get out of the country, that I should write to him \u2014 oh, she said, send a cable \u2014 h-\nhow am I gonna send a cable \u2014 tha-that I would have nothing to do with him, if he\nwasn\u2019t more active in helping. I realized the situation she\u2019s in, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s going on. So I wrote him what she told me. And then I get a letter from my\nfather, that this is no way to talk to me. A-And you know, I \u2014 I\u2019m in the middle of\nthis thing, in the \u2014 in the back and forth, and you know, th \u2014 1-it was for me a very,\nvery uncomfortable and stressful and it\u2019s \u2014 1f you can put yourself in the situation\nwhere \u2014 where you are put in the situation of choosing between your father or your\nmother, I mean how \u2014 how do you do this? A-A-And \u2014 and \u2014 and who 1s right and\nwho is wrong, an-and what\u2019s going on? I don\u2019t know. Bu-But you ask me to do this,\nall right, \u20191l \u2014 Pll do it. You see, so \u2014 but I mean, th-that has always bothered me\nOctober 17, 2010\nthat \u2014 that I wrote that letter. And I \u2014 he s \u2014 my father berated me, that this no way\nto talk to me, and it was disrespectful. But 1-it was \u2014 you know, the war broke out\nand my mother is still over there, and finally she did get an affidavit, cause\nAmerica and Germany, there was still correspondence going on because America\nwas not at war in \u201939. So she \u2014 she got the affidavit and she\u2019s able to leave through\nItaly.",
        "Q: With your sister?",
        "A: With my sister, yeah.",
        "Q: What about your grandmother?",
        "A: My \u2014 my grandmother, I\u2019ve almost forgot about her. She \u2014 she left before any of\nus did. I-I really \u2014 I really loved her. She [indecipherable] she was put in touch, I\ndon\u2019t know how, she took a train t-toward the Belgium border, and there she was\nma \u2014 we had two aunts \u2014 two \u2014 my mother had two sisters who lived in Paris, so \u2014\nso they have arranged where one of the husbands of \u2014 of one of the sisters were to\ngo to Belgium and arrange with a smuggler, and they smuggled her across the\nborder.",
        "Q: How much earlier is this?",
        "A: This probably was e-either very \u2014 at the end of November, or maybe early \u2014\nearly \u2014 first week of December.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "Q: \u00b038?",
        "A: Yeah, \u201938, yeah. So she crosses the border, and she gets arrested. And the French\nput her in prison, illegal entry. An elderly woman, and she only speaks Yiddish, and\nshe\u2019s very frum. So in prison she doesn\u2019t want to eat, because it\u2019s treyfa. So she\ndies. In-Interesting that, since talking about what \u2014 Paris, that she was arrested by\nthe French police, the two sisters were deported to Auschwitz, picked up by the\nFrench. Collaborators. I-I-I\u2019m skipping a lot.",
        "Q: No, no [inaudible]",
        "A: My mother e-eventually, she gets the affidavit, she meets up with the brother\nwho had written to me, you know, for help, and whatever money she has, not much,\nit\u2019s some spending money, she \u2014 she gives it to him.",
        "Q: This is in Italy?",
        "A: In Italy, yeah.",
        "Q: And in the meantime, the Italian police had picked him up because he\u2019s got no\nplace where to stay. And he went to the Jewish welfare service of some kind, and\nthe building, an-and the Italians had closed it, because too many people were\ncoming there for \u2014 asking for help and \u2014 and so forth. They didn\u2019t want any Jewish\nimmigrants to come to the country. So \u2014 so when they picked them up, they asked\nthem what \u2014 what is your source of income? He has no income. We give you 24\nOctober 17, 2010\nhours to get out of the country, or else we\u2019ll return you to Germany. So he crosses\nthe border illegally, into France.",
        "Q: Do you know how he did it, given that he couldn\u2019t bribe anyone?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, no, he didn\u2019t have anything. Cause the minute he crossed the\nborder, he got picked up and sent to Gurs. And then he, from Gurs he went to\nDrancy, and from Drancy he went to Auschwitz. He had a son, Julius. The son,\nhad smu \u2014 had smuggled himself across the border. It\u2019s a little chilly here. Are you\nuncomfortable?",
        "Q: No. Let me press pause [indecipherable] [break] So, pressing record. If I\nremember correctly, you had mentioned that you had some interaction with\nEichmann. Was that \u2014 was that a personal eyewitness on your part, or was that\nthrough \u2014",
        "A: No, I\u2014I didn\u2019t know anything about Eichmann. I needed to have an entry made\n0-on \u2014 on an immediate basis, because I\u2019m going to go to England an-and I needed\na passport, and England was not listed on the passport, so \u2014 so how do I do this? So\n\u2014 so I decided that the best way \u2014 a-and by the way, it has to be certified on the\npassport, each country that you want to go \u2014 emigrate to. So I decided to go to Nazi\nheadquarters. They were located at Rothschild palace. And I just went in and \u2014 and\nright away I meet the person in charge, the \u2014 you know, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re referring\nOctober 17, 2010\nme from one place to the other. And he wants to know what it is that \u2014 that I\u2019m\nthere for, and so I told him. And he \u2014 he [indecipherable] agreed and he gave it to\nme, wrote in there and put the stamp on it and \u2014 an-and that was it. And it was only\nyears later that I learned that the person who was in charge was Eichmann. So if he\nwas in charge, so \u2014 so \u2014 so it must have been him. You know, he didn\u2019t introduce\nhimself to me. But, you know, my assumption. I don\u2019t know who else had the\nauthority, except f-for hi \u2014 for Eichmann, once you are in \u2014 1n the headquarters of\nthe Nazi government.",
        "Q: How did people treat you there when they were referring you from one place to\nthe next? Was it just all business?",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "Q: There was \u2014 there was no un-pleasantry\u201d",
        "A: No, no. I said griiss gott, th-they gave me a \u2014 they stared at me. I \u2014 I \u2014 I think\nthey were surprised, they didn\u2019t know what to do. I mean, a little boy comes in, and\nthere\u2019s \u2014 with gruss gott, a-a-and you know, who \u2014 who \u2014 who do you want to see?\nAn-And I probably said th-the person in charge. A-And so the \u2014 from one office to\nthe other, to wind up with Eichmann, I \u2014 1\u20141\u2014I1-\u2014I did hear, when he was tried in\nIsrael that he made some claim that on occasion he tried to save Jews. I mean, that\nwas par \u2014 so-some small part of his defense. But he did o \u2014 also admit that one\nOctober 17, 2010\nmistake that he made was that he slapped Lowenherz. And tha-that he \u2014 he\napologized for having slapped his face, because he had much respect for\nLowenherz, and \u2014 and Lowenherz survived. And by the way, ma-many people felt\nthat Lowenherz was a collaborator. I spoke to his son, his son survived, and I was\nable to get ahold of him, lived in New York, name \u2014 changed his name to\nLavary(ph). I have a letter that he sent me, talking about his father and how glad he\nwas to hear from me, because I had written to him and told him about the father,\nand \u2014 the father being responsible for my sur-surviving. And he says, the father\nwould have been happy to hear from me. And he put me in touch with his daughter,\nwho lives in California, and she\u2019s a professor at one of the universities there, and\nhe \u2014 he felt that the daughter should hear my story. So we got the daughter to call\nme, and we were in a conference phone call, and I told her story, and then she \u2014\nbecause the father was criticized for having supplied the lists to the Nazi authorities,\nwho were then picked up and deported. How else do you find out who lives where?\nBut they had the information. My knowledge of Lowenherz, he had no choice. So \u2014\nso they\u2019re gonna get that list no matter what. He\u2019s not the only one who knows\nwhere the lists are. So if they kill him [indecipherable] so \u2014 so he is in a difficult\nsituation. Might \u2014 you might also find of interest that the rabbi at my Bar Mitzvah\nwas Rabbi Benjamin Murmelstein. There you have a different story. He was part\nOctober 17, 2010\nof the Judenrat in Vienna, and then he became part of the Judenrat at\nTheresienstadt. It is reported that he acted shamefully, that he molested women,\nand if they didn\u2019t cooperate, he\u2019d put them on the list to be deported. There are\nbooks written about his deed. He too survived, and wound up in Italy. They wanted\n\u2014 many of the people who knew him from \u2014 who also had survived Theresienstadt\nwanted to hang him up. He a \u2014 with the church\u2019s help, he wound up in Rome, and\nthe Vatican supposedly helped him, and he started working for the Vatican, and he\ndied in Italy. And the wife wanted to have him buried in the Jewish cemetery, and\nthey refused. And with the Vatican intercession, to cooperate or to yield or\nwhatever, so \u2014 so they agreed, but only at the edge of the cemetery. I understand\nthat there is some sort of a custom that if you are an apostate, or you\u2019ve done\nsomething disrespectful to the Jewish people, they let you be buried in the Jewish\ncemetery, but away from everybody, only at the edge. So that is where he\u2019s buried,\nin Italy. That\u2019s the story of the rabbi, Benjamin mermu \u2014 Benjamin\nMurmelstein. And I have \u2014 I can\u2019t remember the name of the book, but there\u2019s a \u2014\na book written about the \u2014 the Judenrat, he was the head of the camp at\nTheresienstadt, and he s \u2014 replaced Edelman, who was the former head. And\nEdelman, before being deported, advised the committee there, don\u2019t trust\nOctober 17, 2010\nMurmelstein. And if you like, Pll give you name of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the book, and\n\u2014 and you can Google M-Murmelstein.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure [indecipherable]",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t make reference to what he did, only the position that he held. So \u2014 so\nhe \u2014 he became quite prominent as Benjamin Murmelstein. I don\u2019t know if \u2014 you\ndidn\u2019t write down the name. Benjamin Murmelstein. | still have the Bar Mitzvah\nbook that I received. That\u2019s another story. It was about two or three days before we\nleft. We had to take our suitcases and to have it inspected by the Gestapo. And you\nwere not allowed to take any money, you\u2019re not allowed to take any cameras, no\njewelry, nothing of any value. You \u2014 a-anything in your possession had to be in\nyour possession as of \u201937, as I mentioned earlier. No \u2014 no typewriters, nothing \u2014 no\nmusical instruments, an-and the only thing that was not listed was books. And since\nit wasn\u2019t listed, I felt, you know, I always liked books, and the nicest present you\ncould give me for my Bar Mitzvah would be a book. So, I\u2014 I had received quite a\nfew books, so I put them in a suitcase. And when we went to the Kultusgemeinde,\nwhere we had taken our suitcase to, the Gestapo agent said, what\u2019s with these\nbooks? And my mother said, well, he likes to read. He doesn\u2019t need them. So he\nstarted \u2014 took some of the books and tossed them all out. You know, just threw\nthem away, but he left some books there. And one of the books he\u2019d left was the\nOctober 17, 2010\nBar Mitzvah boy \u2014 prayer book, which I still have, with the date and everything.\nAnother document. German Bar Mitzvah prayer book. So where are we in the\nstory?",
        "Q: Well, tell me about the day that you left. So, it was from Hiitteldorf. Who did\nyou go to the train station with?",
        "A: O-Only my mother. My father was \u2014 oh, she felt my father may be arrested, you\nknow, so he \u2014 because fo-for a while he just didn\u2019t leave the house. So it was \u2014 I-I\nhad no idea what to expect, but when w \u2014 when we got there, each child had to be\ndropped off at the foot of the steps. That was in the requirement that we had\nreceived, as to what procedure to follow for the transport, and \u2014 and we were to\narrive at a certain hour, and in my case late in the evening. The child had to be drop\noff at the steps of the foot o-of the entrance. The parent was not allowed on the\nplatform. Only one parent could come, and we would be given a number, and that\nwas it. A-And now we arriving at the station. And there are hundreds of parents\nwith a child, and well, I\u2019m almost 14, only one day away. This is a \u2014 late in \u2014 at\nnight, on the 10\" of December, and I\u2019m listening to some of the conversation that\nwas going on, you know, with the \u2014 the conversation between my mother a-and me,\nwe \u2014 we \u2014 we knew what to accept. I wanted to be part of 1t, my mother wanted me\nout of the country, so it was, write to me, we\u2019ll get together, we\u2019ll be okay an-and\nOctober 17, 2010\nso forth, and you know, my \u2014 each \u2014 each one encouraging the other, y-you see, so\n\u2014 so I\u2019m not \u2014 I \u2014 I recognize what 1s taking place, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not emotionally\ncarried away, because I know we\u2019re gonna meet up again, you know. My father, a\nmonth later is leaving, so I know we\u2019re gonna get together some \u2014 at some time.\nWhen or what, of course, we had no idea. But I\u2019m listening to what goes on around\nme, which I found very heartrending. I had no idea that on this transport would be\nchildren between two and 16. And the conversation of some of these children, four,\nfive, six years old, they had no idea what was taking place, and what \u2014 why they\nwere there and where they were going and why they were going an-and \u2014 and are\nyou not coming with me, or \u2014 or I don\u2019t want to go, I want to stay. You don\u2019t love\nme, or \u2014 I get emotional even today when I talk about it because at the time I \u2014 I\nwas not as em-emotionally affected as I am now, because now I have children and\ngrandchildren and I don\u2019t know if I would have the courage of the parents, the\nsacrifice that they made, to take a kid at that age and send him away. I-It took a lot\nof guts, I mean, cause I don\u2019t want you to worry, or write to me, or we\u2019ll soon get\ntogether, and it\u2019s all fabricated. They don\u2019t know. And as finally happened, close to\n90 percent of the children never saw their parents again. So 1-1t \u2014 it was a very, very\nstressful period. A-And you know, give them a number, I \u2014 you know, my number\nwas thr \u2014 325, so I knew I was going to England \u2014 because until then I didn\u2019t even\nOctober 17, 2010\nknow where I was going for sure. So \u2014 so I knew I was going to England. And they\ntook the younger children, they put them in one wagon, the older children in another\nwagon. And the girls in one wagon, the boys in another wagon, so \u2014 and I\nremember on the \u2014 f-for the \u2014 for the most part we had a certain amount of fear as to\nwhat was going to happen, even on the train, whenever it stopped and the Nazi\npersonnel came on an-and then they walked through and \u2014 because they could kick\nyou off the train, you know. Somebody \u2014 there was a rumor that somebody was\ntaken off the train. If there was or wasn\u2019t, I have no idea, you know, rumor\ncirculates. So we had some social workers from the Kultusgemeinde who came\nwith us and they had \u2014 they were going to be allowed to leave the country, but their\nfamily was held hostage, they had to return. And we a-arrived to the\n[indecipherable] 1-in \u2014 late \u2014 late at night, after a day and a half of traveling on the\ntrain, we arrived in Holland and the train stopped on the German side first, and they\ninspected, and whatever and then they let the train proceed across the border. And\nonce we crossed the border all hell broke loose, and everybody started yelling and\nscreaming and cheering and you know, because now we knew we were free; no\nlonger to be afraid of the Nazis or what they could do. And I remember people\ncoming up to the train and th-they offered us drinks and \u2014 and sandwiches and so\nforth, a very friendly reception 1-in Holland. And after a little while, I-I was so tired\nOctober 17, 2010\nfrom the day and a half on th \u2014 on the train that I \u2014 I-I could \u2014 I could barely stay\nawake. So \u2014 so all I remember is I got on this boat and the crossing of the channel is\nvery stormy, I \u2014 and I got motion sick. I\u2019d never been on any ocean, I \u2014 first time I \u2014\nI\u2019m seeing an ocean. And in the morning the \u2014 the next morning we \u2014 we arrived in\nHarwich, England, and I faintly remember \u2014 I don\u2019t know how \u2014 being taken to\nLowestoft(ph) in Dovercourt. And there I stayed maybe three weeks, something\nlike that, and my \u2014 my problem started, I was there three weeks then \u2014 then they \u2014\nthey sent me to Ipswich, and I was there 10 days, and being \u2014 and then I went to\nanother place, 1t was a convalescent home for sick people, and \u2014 and in each time 1-\ni-in the \u2014 in Dovercourt every weekend, they \u2014 they would line us up and \u2014 and\npeople would come down a-and pick out certain children. And you know, I asked\nthem what\u2019s going on? These are people that \u2014 private people want to take a child in\ntheir home. But I noticed that whenever they picked anybody out, they wanted a\nsmall, small, young children. Nobody wanted to get a teenager, you see, so nobody\npicked me. So \u2014 so I was going to this convalescent home, and then I went another\nplace. Each time I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m staying a week or two, or three weeks, and then I go\nanother place, and then finally I was sen \u2014 we went to a place called \u2014 they always\ncut down the number of boys, always \u2014 you know, th \u2014 by then, I think we\u2019re down\nto a dozen boys a-and \u2014 and we\u2019re going to a\u2014 San Remo hotel in Margate, near \u2014\nOctober 17, 2010\nnear Dover. And th-that was sort of a family run hotel, small hotel, and I really\nliked it. I said oh, this 1s beautiful. I sa \u2014 th-the ocean, a-and \u2014 and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s gotten\nwarmer and the food is great, and we were there maybe two and a half weeks, and\nthe proprietor tells us that you'll have to leave, you know, some other place. I says,\nwhy, I says, you know, we like it here. We said, we want \u2014 I want to stay here, I\nsaid, this is \u2014 this is very nice. He said, I\u2019m very sorry, but I can\u2019t support a group\nof boys and nobody pays us. So that was the first time that I realized that \u2014 what\nwas going on. That we\u2019re being shifted from one place to the other. Maybe they\nsaid, all right, I\u2019ll take them for a few days, and so forth, you see, but nobody was\npaying anybody, you see, so these people were \u2014 were offering to house some \u2014\nsome boys until they realized that th \u2014 they\u20191l have to make room for us, and there\u2019s\ncertain expense involved, and \u2014 and you \u2014 there\u2019s no funds available.",
        "Q: I-I\u2019m \u2014 a-at this point I\u2019m curious about the people around you. First off, did you\nknow anyone on the Kindertransport?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And then once you get to England, are you making any kind of friendships and\nhow well are you able to communicate in English?",
        "A: \u2019'm not communicating with \u2014 I\u2019m living with German boys, Austrian boys, and\nwe\u2019re talking German. Spoke German almost the whole time I lived in England. A-\nOctober 17, 2010\nAnd f-from San Remo Hotel, we were sent to Croydon, an estate. Then we \u2014 we\nhearing the possibility of war, and the \u2014 that be \u2014 you know, now the \u2014 England is\nrearm \u2014 finally re-rearming itself, you know, a-and there\u2019s more and more talk\nabout the possibility of war because Hitler wants Danzig and \u2014 a-and England has\na pact with Poland and France and so forth, they\u2019re gonna come to the assistance\nof the Polish government. A-And in Croydon, it was around September first, war\nstarts. A-And there we stayed at a school that had been evacuated of British\nchildren, it was a private school, a girls\u2019 school. Kendra Hall was the name. And\nso we stayed there on \u2014 on the first night when war star \u2014 started. And \u2014 and we\nexperienced the first air raid alarm, supposedly German planes were si-si \u2014 flying\noverhead. A-And we went into the air raid shelter. And we were there \u2014 nice place,\nby the way \u2014 we were there maybe two weeks when we were told that we had to\nleave the place because near us was a \u2014 the RAF, Royal Air Force had a base, and\nthey needed to house their personnel, so they were going to take over the school,\nand we would have to leave. So, the next thing we were being sent to London, to\nanother school. I don\u2019t know if you know anything about London, Eaton(ph)\nAvenue, [indecipherable] school. And the same thing, it\u2019s a private school, it was\nempty, children had been evacuated. And the building 1s empty, if you want to stay\nthere, fine. So a group of boys stayed at this school.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "Q: These are still German speaking refugees?",
        "A: Yeah, all was, yeah, yeah. We just speak German. Hardly anybody knew any\nEnglish. And \u2014",
        "Q: Well, the nine months that you\u2019re in Britain before the war breaks out, you\u2019re\nnot receiving any kind of schooling? You\u2019re just being moved around?",
        "A: No school.",
        "Q: And how frequently are you able to communicate with \u2014 with anyone back\nhome?",
        "A: Perhaps once a month or every six weeks or something like that. Not \u2014 not a \u2014\nnot on a daily basis or even weekly basis, it\u2019s just that \u2014 because I \u2014 I have the\nstamps. I mean, it sounds silly today, you know, when you talk about it, you know, I\nhave a stamp. But you know, I was there maybe a week, and I\u2019m told by the\nheadmaster that they had a phone call from the refugee committee. And the refugee\ncommittee tha \u2014 informs him that they have no money for my support. They\u2019 ve run\nof \u2014 out of funds, and that I would have to get a job. So he \u2014 he told me that the \u2014\nyou \u2014 you got to find a job. I-I don\u2019t know how I found it, whether he found it for\nme, or whether somebody told me about it, I just don\u2019t remember. But I went for\ninterview for the person who was going to employ me, and he hired me, and the job\nwas to be a delivery boy, a-and that\u2019s what I was, a del \u2014\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "Q: In London?",
        "A: Yeah.

He says \u2014\nhe says, 1f you really do well, he says, I'll teach you to be a cutter, and he says, a\ncutter makes something like 40 pounds a week, or something like that. As \u2014 as a\ndelivery boy I make one pound. One pound a week, you know, I thought that was\ngreat, one pound a week.",

        "A: I ate \u2014 I ate one meal a day. And sometimes, y-you know, when people I\u2019ve\nworked with \u2014 not \u2014 not \u2014 not every day, but maybe ca \u2014 two, three times a week,\nbecause we \u2014 we have these lunchtime periods, you know, in the afternoon, th-the \u2014\n10 o\u2019clock or so they ha \u2014 they serve tea. When I say serve tea, we ma \u2014 we made\ntea, a-and in f\u2014 in \u2014 in the afternoon at two o\u2019clock, the teatime again, we \u2014\nsometimes they would bring an extra sandwich, not \u2014 not \u2014 not all the time, but\nsometimes, and that \u2014 that was a big deal for me.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "Q: And these were the other delivery boys, or \u2014 who would bring the sandwiches?",
        "A: No, no, no, they were wor-workers.",

        "Q: Were they British or foreigners?",
        "A: No, no, British, yeah British. And you learn English listening to them, you know,\nmany times \u2014 they liked me and they laughed about the way I spoke, and the accent\nI had and so forth, and \u2014 but that\u2019s what I was doing, whatever. Maurice Skark(ph)\nwas the owner. And he would do the cutting, I would pick up the cloth from the\nwholesaler, and I would take the cloth and bring him the cloth, or \u2014 and he had the \u2014\nwhat do you call it Joyce, a design? No, no, no, how to \u2014 how to cut th-th-the fabric\nout.",

        "A: Th-There\u2019s a di \u2014 a \u2014 a paper design that you lay \u2014 put down and cut\naccordingly. So \u2014 so \u2014 so he had the design which was drawn out on paper and he\nhad a picture of what the dress ought to look like and so forth, and \u2014 and this was\nhigh \u2014 high expense fashions for the day. And the \u2014 and he would start from scratch\nOctober 17, 2010\nand make the dress and then I \u2014 or the coat or many times was a \u2014 women\u2019s\novercoats, or \u2014 or a skirt, or whatever. A-And then I would take the finished product\nand take it back to the wholesaler and the wholesaler would inspect it, and tha-that\u2019s\n\u2014 when it passes inspection, that\u2019s when he gets paid, you see. Now, on one pound a\nweek, I paid 15 shillings fo-for room and board. Three shillings I had to pay for\ntransportation, cause I lived at this Swiss cottage. And where I worked was off a\nstreet called Poland Street, which was near Oxford Circle, if you\u2019ve ever been to\nLondon. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a block away from Oxford Street, which is the main drag. A-\nAnd I worked there until the day that I actually left London.",

        "Q: The war had already broken out?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, I lived through the bombing.",
        "Q: And you were working.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. As a matter of fact, I \u2014 I\u2014 I was an air raid warden. I had\nvolunteered to be in \u2014 become an air raid warden.",
        "Q: So your English had improved by then?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I o \u2014 well not fluent, but well enough to \u2014 to know what\u2019s going on and\nI could read the paper. But as an air raid warden, when the \u2014 when the air raid\n67October 17, 2010\nwarden \u2014 warning came on, I would be on the roof.

        "Q: So you would spot an airplane and you\u2019d get everyone down in the basement?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, to so \u2014 go undercover.",

        "Q: How did you become a volunteer air raid warden?",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t remember. I volunteered. An-And any-anybody who wants to\ndo anything, you know, it \u2014 it\u2019s okay. Had I been 18 years old, I would have been\narrested as an enemy alien. And since I don\u2019t reme \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t remember\nwhether you had to be 18 or 16 when they considered you an enemy alien and they\nwould put you in some sort of a camp. At 18 you could volunteer for a pioneer \u2014\nwhat they called Pioneer Corps, and in England, you know, I wasn\u2019t old enough to\n\u2014 to be in anything at the time. I was waiting f \u2014 you know, I-I can imagine how my\n\u2014 my parents were in this country at the time, and in the newsreel when they went to\nthe \u2014 the movies on occasion, they would see th \u2014 oh, what \u2014 they have a movie \u2014\nwhat they would ca \u2014 what they called Movietone News. This is way before your \u2014\nyour time. They would show London ablaze, and they would show the \u2014 the \u2014 the\nsearching f \u2014 search lights a-and f-fire \u2014 buildings were put aflame and \u2014 and heavy\nbombing. An-And \u2014 and I lived through that and I \u2014 I \u2014 we had sandbags all around\nthe building, the school; it was not a very big building, it was small. But\nsandbagged all around, and we would sleep in \u2014 1n the cellar, the basement, or \u2014 and\nwa \u2014 one particular night, if you ever \u2014 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen it on television maybe,\nwhen a bomb falls down, there is that searing noise, and as it comes closer to you\nOctober 17, 2010\nit\u2019s louder and louder. And this particular time I felt, that\u2019s got my number \u2014 that\u2019s\ngot our number on it, a-and it\u2019s gonna hit our building. And a-as it came closer a-\nand I \u2014 and suddenly I heard a huge explosion, and the building shook and the glass\nbroke and I had been sleeping, you know, I \u2014 I sat up quite alarmed. And the\nheadmaster of the school saw me, and he said to me, Mr. Friedman, would you like\nto have a cup of tea? Br-British stoic behavior. Years later, I had described Joyce\nmany times, that particular event, and \u2014 and I showed her and told her how close\nthat bomb fell. And I said, you know, it wiped out that entire building. So \u2014 so years\nlater, in the 60s, we went back, and I \u2014 and I wanted to show her the building, it\u2019s a\n\u2014 and st \u2014 the place was still vacant, nothing was there. So I says, look, this 1s where\nthe bomb fell. And th-the school had been converted into apartments, and knocked\non the door in one of the apartments and talked to the people if they\u2019Il let me come\nin. And we came in, and I was telling them the different things. And I said, you\nknow, around here, there used to be a \u2014 a dumbwaiter. You know what a\ndumbwaiter is?",
        "Q: The one that goes \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it goes down ba \u2014 he says, oh, he says, I was wondering what was\nback there. So he \u2014 he liked the fact that I could explain that to him. So, li-living\nthrough the London blitz, my parents, knowing that I was there, I-I can imagine\nOctober 17, 2010\nthat they were very worried. And they were anxious to \u2014 to get me out. My father\nsent me an affidavit, the affidavit was rejected by the American embassy. Kennedy,\nJoseph Kennedy was the ambassador at that time. It was rejected because my\nfather\u2019s income was insufficient.",
        "Q: Wh-Wh- What was he doing? What was his job at this time?",
        "A: He wa \u2014 he was working in some sort of a shoe factory, and he was making \u2014 I\nhave the \u2014 a re\u2014 a receipt home \u2014 either he was making 12 dollars a week, or 15\ndollars a week, th-that was it.",

        "A: Yes, in Baltimore.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And your brother.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: A-And my brother. And my brother was living someplace else, and he had a job\nm-making 10 dollars or 15 dollars a week as a tailor, that he had learned in Austria.\nSo, I was supposed to be on \u2014 on a ship. I \u2014 I left in late November of 1940.",
        "Q: But your affidavit is first rejected.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So then how \u2014 how do you \u2014",
        "A: Well \u2014 well, they \u2014 my mother went to the Jewish welfare system, HIAS, and\nthe person there was a Julia Strauss, she was in charge of the off \u2014 o-of the Jewish\nWelfare System \u2014 Ser-Service, or whatever they called themselves at the time. And\nshe had a friend who, through marriage was a-an owner or a major shareholder of\nAmico Oil. It was called a st \u2014 first it was Standard Oil of \u2014 of Ohio, and dus \u2014 she\napparently talked to him and so forth, whether he would be willing to help and so \u2014\nsend an affidavit and described to him the circumstances \u2014 and he agreed. And he\noffered 150 dollars for part o-of my passage f-for the ship, because m-my folks\ndidn\u2019t the money, and I didn\u2019t have the money. And \u2014 and in \u2014 and with the\nstipulation that the other half be paid \u2014 and this 1s also strange, often, you know, I \u2014\nI thought at the time you \u2014 it was a very wise, outstanding thing for him to agree,\nfirst to give the affidavit, which guarantees that I would not be dependent upon any\nkind of social welfare once I arrived in this country; e-even though, you know, had\nOctober 17, 2010\nmy parents, my family is here, it makes no difference, according to the American\nlaws at the time. So \u2014 so he agrees to give 150 dollars, with the stipulation that an\nequal amount be spent by somebody in England. He wasn\u2019t going to pay the whole\nthing.",
        "Q: So, who did you find in England?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, a-all this \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 I had no control over\nbooking, or over \u2014 for \u2014 for much of what went on.",
        "Q: Do you know what organization was handling your case? Was it a\u2014 a Jewish\nwelfare organization?",
        "A: I-It no \u2014 evidently some welfare agency \u2014 incidentally, while I was living in\nEngland \u2014 [| left out that story \u2014 my mother writes me a letter that I should try to be\nplaced \u2014 I mean, she sees I\u2019m changing my addresses, ever \u2014 every two, three weeks\nI got a different address that she \u2014 she\u2019s seeing. Why don\u2019t you stay in one place?\nEvery time you write you have a different address. So she writes me a letter saying\nthat I should write to the refugee committee, asking them to be placed with a\nfamily. And when you are placed with a family, you could ask them to send papers\nover to me, perhaps they need a domestic. And I\u20191l come over and I\u2019Il be a\ndomestic. And then Lilly can be a babysitter. But that \u2014 that was not unusual, by the\nway, at the time. Maybe you\u2019ve heard it from other \u2014 so \u2014 so \u2014 so \u2014\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "Q: But she\u2019s writing this still from Vienna?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. So \u2014 so \u2014 so now I get that letter, so, like an obedient son, I write to\nthe committee, the Bloomsbury House or whatever it was ca \u2014 and abou \u2014 about a\nweek later I get an answer. And \u2014 and here\u2019s the strange part of the answer; how did\nyou get to this country, who is taking care of you, and are you Jewish? And I still\nhave that letter, you see. And I \u2014I got that letter, I was so astonished. I says, who 1s\ndoing what for me? I\u2019m going from one place to the other. Wh-Who is doing this?\nAnd they don\u2019t know I exist, you see, so nevertheless I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m answering the\nletter, you know, answered each question. And then I got another letter saying back,\nthank you for writing to us and giving us the information. We will do our very best\nto place you with a family, but we ask that you be patient, because it may take us\nsome time. That\u2019s the last I heard, I was never placed with a family. I \u2014 I had \u2014 at\nthe same time, I \u2014 I don\u2019t want to create the impression that I\u2019m angry with anybody\nor disappointed with anybody. It was war time. The people who were working in\nthese offices had families of their own, and they are concern, there is bombing\ngoing on. It\u2019s a\u2014 ya \u2014 you know, you don\u2019t know from one day to the next whether\nyour home will be destroyed, you see, so 1-it \u2014 it\u2019s more or less everybody\u2019s looking\nout f-for them \u2014 for \u2014 first of all to \u2014 for their own family, rather than look out for\nwhat happens to some kid here or there, you see. Although sa \u2014 many children were\nOctober 17, 2010\nevacuated, you know, a\u2014I was not, a-and m-many others were not. I-It\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s\nthe way it was, it \u2014 it\u2019s war.",
        "Q: You mentioned you were being \u2014 at \u2014 at first, you were being moved around\nevery two weeks or so. Do you have any sense of how the decisions were made?\nWere your \u2014 did they \u2014 did these people know each other, was it private charity?\nYou have \u2014",
        "A: I had no idea, I had no idea. Just kept on being shifted. A-And it was on \u2014 onl-\nonly boys, and sometimes the boy would come and sometimes not. Sometimes he\nwas going different direction. I-I don\u2019t know why. But once I was in London, I was\nin contact with some of the boys that I\u2019d been with at \u2014 particularly in Croydon, I\nhad a very good friend, Martin Lerbl(ph), I have much of his correspondence with\nme, he wanted me to go t\u2014 to Australia and become farmers. And \u2014 and \u2014 and I\nwrote my mother that we\u2019re thinking of going \u2014 of volunteering to go to Australia\nand become farmers an-and she was all for it. You know, she already had me\nrunning a big farm and \u2014 and becoming prosperous that way, and so on, so \u2014 and\nthen I wrote my father, told him that we\u2019re thinking about going to Australia,\nalthough I hadn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t have the foggiest idea how I get to Australia.

        "Q: Did your father say that you need to come to the United States, what was his\nresponse?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He wants the family together 1-in the United States. Now, a-\narriving in the United States, for two weeks everything is fine. But I meet people\nhere, a-and gradually I-I\u2019m becoming quite concerned, an-and finally I didn\u2019t \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t like this country.",
        "Q: Wha-What were you seeing?",
        "A: Stupid questions. People who \u2014 y-you speak with an accent, where you from? I\ndon\u2019t know \u2014 which I got quite often. Where you from? Vienna. And then I would\nsay oo \u2014 a-and then I \u2014 I begin to question, I says, do they know where that 1s?

        "A: No, he\u2019s a\u2014 he\u2019s an American, very, very, extremely wealthy. And I told him\nwhat my problem was an-and his answer was, you better listen to your mother.

        "Q: Were you older than the other children?",

        "A: Although another boy \u2014 I did \u2014 I left out the story, it\u2019s of interest to us. The first\nride I ever took was in a taxicab in London. I didn\u2019t have enough money to go to\nthe train station, so I took a subway to go Oxford \u2014 Oxford Street on the Oxford\nCircle. And because of heavy bombing, you couldn\u2019t just find a cab, but a cab came\nalong, and I stopped it. And the cab driver said, where you going? I said, I\u2019m going\nto Liverpool station, if you\u2019ll take me. He says, hop in. So I got in the cab, and\ninside the cab 1s another boy. And after a while we start talking to each other. He is\nmy age. He is going to Liverpool train station. Here you\u2019re gonna take th \u2014 a ship \u2014\nyou know, the train, it goes to Liverpool, there he\u2019s gonna take a ship, the same\nship. Going to the States? Yes. What city? Baltimore. It was \u2014 his name was Bert\nGrumwalt(ph). He had been with a private family, and he\u2019s telling me that when he\nOctober 17, 2010\nleft, the family gave him 10 pounds, going away present. I said, 10 pounds, you\u2019re\nkidding. 10 pounds? Unbelievable. I didn\u2019t have \u2014 even have one. I had noth \u2014 you\nknow, wa \u2014 but anyhow we \u2014 we gu \u2014 he was placed in the 12\" grade. I\u2019m going\ninto the 10\" grade, that was the difference. His eng \u2014 his English was fluent, mine\nwas not.",
        "Q: Even though you had stayed for two years in England?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. My speech was not. So there was a girl in school that I lamented to\nmany times, Dorothy, because many time I just wanted to quit. In 10\" grade they\nteach [indecipherable] English. And sh \u2014 she was right, but I was upset. She said, I\nknow e-eventually you'll know it, but right now you don\u2019t. I mean, how different it\nis today, where they pass you no matter what. She says, you don\u2019t know it. If you\ndon\u2019t know it, I can\u2019t pass you. That\u2019s it. But, by the time I graduated, I graduated\nwith honors.",
        "Q: Now, you\u2019re saying that Bert Grumwalt(ph), you went to the same school?",
        "A: No, no, different school. He went to City College. It\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s called City\nCollege, but it\u2019s not a college, it\u2019s a high school. He was in 12\" grade; I was in the\n10\" grade. That bothered me. Incidentally, he went to the European theater during\nthe war; we lost track of each other. He fought at the Battle of the Bulge, and was\ntaken prisoner by the Germans, was wounded, almost died. He recovered. He\u2019d\nOctober 17, 2010\nspent several months at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, where he recovered.\nHe joined the si \u2014 h-he got a Master\u2019s degree, I don\u2019t know what in. Do you\nremember \u2014 did he ever mention it? I-I can\u2019t remember, but \u2014 but he \u2014 he joined the\nCIA, and they sent him back to \u2014 to Germany. He came back to the States and he\nwent to work for Grundell(ph), a brokerage \u2014 Wall Street firm. He became the\nmanager of the Baltimore office, became very, very rich. And I \u2014 I mean wealthy.\nLived in a penthouse in Baltimore. But we were good friends, and go out together.\nHe died, well, this February will be three years. But you know, we had many\nmemor \u2014 shared memories, although he was with a family and I didn\u2019t know him in\nEngland, and \u2014 but he knew my cir \u2014 the circumstance that I lived on, and also my\n\u2014 my \u2014 my war experience. He was sent to Europe, I \u2014 I \u2014 when I joined up they\nasked me what branch of service do you want to be in? I \u2014I said, you know, army.\nY-Yeah, but what particular service in the army? So I \u2014 I don\u2019t know, what\u2019s my\nchoice? So they rattled off artillery, or the paratroopers, th-the tank corps, the\ninfantry, you know, different \u2014 you know, quartermaster corps and so forth. And\nthen he said medical corps. So I said medical [indecipherable] I think I\u2019ll take the\nmedical corps.",
        "Q: What drew you to that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I thought that would \u2014 I would learn more. I feel \u2014\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "Q: How old were you?",
        "A: 18. I says, what am I gonna learn in the artillery, how to fire shell? How \u2014 how\u2019s\nthat gonna be of help to me? So I said, I\u2019ll take the medical corps. So when I \u2014\nyoull read the story there about how I got shipped to the Pacific, because I had no\nidea how to wind up 1n the \u2014 in the \u2014 going to the Pacific. I protested when \u2014 when I\nwas given shipping orders that I was going to be sent to the Pacific, I \u2014 I protested. I\n\u2014 [ \u20141s [indecipherable] one time they had a special program where they would\nsend you to college. In-Incidental, when I finished high school \u2014 I keep on going\nback and forth \u2014 the principal called me in, and re \u2014 we had become friends, a-and\nhe said to me, how would you like to have a scholarship? And I didn\u2019t know what\nthat was. I \u2014 I said, what\u2019s a scholarship? So \u2014 so he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s explaining to me. He\nsaid, Loyo-Loyola College is offering you a scholarship. And he\u2019s telling me that\nthis is a Catholic school and \u2014 and \u2014 and what it\u2019s like and so forth. I says, a\nCatholic school is offering me a scholarship? I says \u2014 I couldn\u2019t believe this. I says,\ndo you \u2014 you mean it\u2019s a Catholic an-and \u2014 I\u2019m Jewish. He says, oh la \u2014 no, do-\ndon\u2019t worry about that, they offered. He says, the only thing is, 1s that you have to\nhave an interview with the dean of admissions, but I don\u2019t anticipate any problem.\nSo \u2014 so I went to see the dean of admission and everything 1s fine with him, except\nhe wants me to promise that I will attend the school, if given a schol \u2014 made enough\nOctober 17, 2010\nof a scholarship that I will actually accept it. And the problem was that I already\nhad received orders to go into the army. I says, I can\u2019t promise. I don\u2019t know when I\nwill be called. So \u2014 so I never accepted the scholarship. But th-the surprise was the\norders that I received after basic training, was to go to the Pacific, which I didn\u2019t\nwant, but I had no choice.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t want because you wanted to go back to Europe?",
        "A: Europe, yeah, of course. I speak German. Why do you send me out to the\nPacific? And in college they have a special training where they \u2014 1-in the army they\nhave a special training where they \u2014 the army will pay to send you to college. So I\nsaid oh that \u2014 how wonderful. So I applied. So in order to be accepted, you \u2014 again,\nyou have to be interviewed. The only program available was German. So the first\nquestion he is asking me, he says, I see in your resume here that you speak German,\nis that right? I said yes. He says, then why should we send you to college to study\nGerman? By the way, it was called ASTP, Army Special Training Program. I said, I\nwant to go to college and this is the only thing you offer. So, he rejects, whi-which\nmade sense. But then to turn around and send me to the Pacific made no sense. But\nthis is the army.",
        "Q: In the meantime, in \u2014 while this is all happening, how much are you aware of\nwhat was happening back in Europe and \u2014\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: \u2014 especially Nazi occupied Europe.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "A: Nothing. We have family over there, we have no idea what\u2019s going on. We ar-\nare very worried, very worried, but we \u2014 we don\u2019t know. We \u2014 we hope that\nsomehow or other the \u2014 they\u2019re okay, but we don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Are you able to contact the uncle who made it to Palestine?",
        "A: Th\u2014no. The one whom \u2014 to Palestine? No. Don\u2019t hear anything about him\neither.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: What I-I \u2014 as a matter of fact, I don\u2019t even know if he got to Palestine. I mean,\nat that time, all I knew is he crossed the border into Yugoslavia, I never heard any\nmore.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Just before the war ended was the first time I got a letter, where he wrote me\nhow happy he was to find me, and described him \u2014 his situation in Israel. And you\nknow, I was his favorite and this and that and \u2014 but nos \u2014 I had had the medical\ntraining in the States and I had been made to believe that I would wind up in some\nOctober 17, 2010\nsort of a hospital facility in the Pacific. So I looked forward to that, working in the\nhospital, fine. And we were on the water over a month, maybe five weeks on the\nwater. Can you imagine? And if you read the description there, it was a freighter\nthat had been converted into a troop ship. And we were, as I say there, packed in\nlike sardines, thousands of troops, and one on top of the other, we stacked on \u2014 on\nsort of a canvas bunk a-an \u2014 and \u2014 and there\u2019s non \u2014 you can\u2019t turn around, because\nit\u2019s so close, and you got to climb up a for \u2014 four or five high, as to whe \u2014 where\nyou\u2019re gonna stay, a-an \u2014 a-and if you \u2014 you take a shower, but it\u2019s salt water, and\nthere\u2019s no way that you can lather yourself in soap water, it just doesn\u2019t work. So \u2014\nso it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s always sticky, and you ya \u2014 and you feel crummy. And th \u2014 an-and \u2014\nan-an-and it\u2019s the same clothes, yo \u2014 you know, and there\u2019s no change of clothes.\nA-And you feel real miserable. You get \u2014 1-in the \u2014 in this article I saw it was a\u2014a\npreparation for jungle warfare. But we were about five weeks on the water. Today\nyou can fly over there in one day. But when I \u2014 we landed in [indecipherable] and I\nwas there maybe a little over a week and then was back on the ship again, and\nwhere we going? Everything was always secret, nobody knew. I mean, who am I\ngonna tell? You see, but I was on \u2014 on the \u2014 even on the first sh \u2014 0-on the first\ntroop ship [break]\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "Q: They were telling you that you can\u2019t tell any \u2014 you were saying you can\u2019t tell\nanyone where you are, but you didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: No, they weren\u2019t telling us not to say anything, because there was nothing to say.\nIn other words, we \u2014 we were told nothing. Where am I going? Nobody knows. So I\nmade reference to that in \u2014 in the article that I hope you\u2019ll find of interest, and\nwound up in [indecipherable] and then I\u2019m put onto another troopship, and again, I\nha \u2014 I don\u2019t have the faintest idea. But they have a roster and one day I\u2019m being told\nthat there was watch duty. Watch duty you are on the deck with a rifle, and for\nabout two hours \u2014 two hours off and \u2014 and four hours off. I mean, two hours on and\nfour hours off. A-And I see my list as being chosen for on \u2014 for \u2014 for on duty. I\nsays, wait a minute, I says, I\u2019m a medic. We don\u2019t carry weapons. I says, why \u2014\nwhy \u2014 so \u2014 so I says, wait a minute, there\u2019s a mistake here. I don\u2019t do anything with\nweapons. So the officer says to me, well, I don\u2019t anything about what you tell me, I\nhave nothing here about medic here. He says, you in the infantry. I says, no. Well \u2014\nwell, that\u2019s your assignment. That\u2019s the first time that I heard anything about the\ninfantry.",
        "Q: Had you received any combat training?",
        "A: No, we-well, yes, 1-1-1n basic training you receive \u2014 but \u2014 but not with weapons,\nif you\u2019re a medic. One time the \u2014 they took us out and we fired a machine gun and I\nOctober 17, 2010\nfired the \u2014 a carbine and an M-1 rifle, yeah, I fired one time. But th \u2014 but how to\nclean it, how to handle it [indecipherable] no \u2014 no extensive training. Yeah, that\none time it was a wa \u2014 how to disarm somebody who comes to \u2014 at you with a \u2014\nwith a bayonet on the rifle. How to disarm that person. That\u2019s a-another story. But I\nwas assigned as a medic to the infantry, and from day one I hated it. It 1s \u2014 first of\nall, the living conditions were so terrible. The food was horrible. Ev-Everything was\npowdered, we \u2014 we got nothing fresh. You living in the jungle, a-and you know, 1-\ninsects crawling all over you. And you know, I\u2019m a city boy, I\u2019m \u2014 you can\u2019t take a\nbath, y-yo-yo-you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 it takes weeks to get a letter. A-And we were not\ndirectly \u2014 at least I was not directly involved in \u2014 in combat, but we \u2014 we got the\nwounded, and \u2014 an-and my job was principally thr-three directions; overcome\nshock, hemorrhage and fractures. A-And you learn, it\u2019s amazing. Really, you know,\nI was astonished how much you can learn just by watching what somebody else\ndoes, and then sometimes having somebody who knows, come over and \u2014 and work\nwith you, and so you learn those things. How to apply traction, and how to apply\nsupport, and sa \u2014 and put on a cast and all that. You know, you learn that, because\nlater on, toward the end of the war, I was assigned to, you know, shipped to\nHawaii, a-and \u2014 and there I became an instructor and the draft was still going on,\nand new recruits were coming in and I was lecturing in \u2014 1n two subjects \u2014 three\nOctober 17, 2010\nsubjects; sanitation, first aid and venereal diseases. And I always started off my\nlecture in venereal diseases, telling them that many times \u2014 at that time, when you\ngot a venereal disease, you could be court-martialed and put into prison. You may\nnot know this, and it\u2019s totally different today, but then, you know \u2014 so \u2014 so \u2014 so\ngonorrhea was a major problem to \u2014 to many, and disabling, and because it\u2019s so\ninfectious. So \u2014 so I wou \u2014 I would start off my \u2014 my lecture with contrary to what\nyou may have been told, that you cannot catch gonorrhea off a toilet seat, I want to\nassure you that that is incorrect. It is possible to get gonorrhea off a toilet seat, but\nit\u2019s a hell of a place to take your girlfriend. You see, because many times, when you\nasked a soldier, how did you get this? You see, oh, I don\u2019t know, maybe off a toilet\nseat, you know. It\u2019s really nonsense, you see it was \u2014 so but this was \u2014 got a big\nlaugh, and \u2014 and \u2014 and I would have the attention of the audience. A-And when the\nwar had ended, but I was still in Hawaii, and troops were being repatriated back to\nthe country, I asked the commanding officer if he will authorize me to go to the\nuniversity there, so he said okay. So I went to the \u2014 for a little while to the\nUniversity of Hawaii. An-And then when I came back, I-I \u2014 you know, I thought\nI\u2019d become a doctor, until one day I met a guy who had graduated from high school\nwith me, and you know, hi Herb, you know, Phil, how are you doing? We start\ntalking to each other, where \u2014 what are you doing now? I says, well, I\u2019m going to\nOctober 17, 2010\ncollege park, I\u2019ve been accepted to be pre-med. So he says, why do you want to go\nto pre-med? He says, you know, when you finish it, what do you got? Nothing.\nThen you still gotta go to med school, right? I says yeah, of course. He says, well,\nwhy don\u2019t you go to pharmacy school? I says, why should I go to pharmacy? I want\nto become \u2014 he says, no, he says, you use that as your pre-med. And this way you at\nleast have a degree as a pharmacist and you \u2014 and you can work during the summer\nand then pay for medical school \u2014 because I had no money. So I thought it was a\ngood idea. The \u2014 the problem was that 1t was mid-August and school starts in\nSeptember. So \u2014 so, how do I get in? Because at that time so many thousands of\nsoldiers came out, an-and they all wanted to go into \u2014 applied to Hopkins. Hopkins\nturned me down and said, reapply next year. Well, you\u2019re not going to sit around for\na whole year. Now I\u2019m in my 20s, 21 or 22 years old. So I \u2014 you know, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\nthought about it, I says, you know, it\u2019s not a bad idea, but would I get in? So \u2014 so I-I\nwent there, and I asked to meet th-the dean of admission, was a elderly woman. And\nshe gave me the same answer, she says, we \u2014 we can admit you next year, but our\nclasses are closed. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna be possible. She says, well, 1f somebody\nlast minute doesn\u2019t want to come in, you know, maybe. I\u2019ll give you an application,\nshe says, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. I-I-I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s gonna be possible. So I\nsaid to her \u2014 her name was Kohl(ph). I-I-I said, Dean Kohl(ph), if you admit me,\nOctober 17, 2010\nPll come back and kiss you. The whole of \u2014 the whole office there overheard this\nconversation, they all burst out laughing. But I got in.",
        "Q: And did you come back?",
        "A: I\u2014I came back, but I didn\u2019t kiss her. So \u2014 so I\u2014I guess that\u2019s the story.",
        "Q: I have just one last question. How did you end up learning about what happened\nback in Europe?",
        "A: We thr \u2014 through the Red Cross, got the notification that my uncle, you know,\nmy mother\u2019s brother had been sent to Auschwitz. And \u2014 and then gradually we\nheard that his son, my cousin, he was 18 years old, he was killed in Auschwitz. And\nthe most difficult thing for my mother was to learn that the husbands of her sisters\nand the children had survived, but the sisters had not. A-And mentally, she was\nfinished after this. I-It was \u2014 life at home was o \u2014 was, from then on was very, very\ndifficult. Later on when the \u2014 I \u2014 I went back into the army, by the way, during the\nKorean War, an-and became a commissioned officer. But \u2014 and we lived in\nVirginia for 40 years, but every time I went home, all I had to do was open the door\nan-and \u2014 and it was \u2014 she\u2019d talk about the brother and the sister, and the brother and\nthe sister and why and this and that. An-And a certain regret. It\u2019s just difficult. She\nshould have left me in England and should have worked on getting out the brother.\nI was safe. And maybe she could have helped the brother at that time. And I \u2014 I\nOctober 17, 2010\nknew she was right. So \u2014 so you carry that burden, you know, am I responsible, you\nknow, and \u2014 you know, I just \u2014 could I have done something, you know, who \u2014 who\n\u2014 about my uncle, who should I have talked to? I mean, I didn\u2019t know anybody, I \u2014\nyou know, where, what? I mean, I don\u2019t even know where \u2014 where is he? What\u2019s\nthe address, you know? And \u2014 and even if I have the address, I mean, who \u2014 who \u2014\nwho is gonna do what? I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to me from day to \u2014 one to\nthe next day, so \u2014 so how am I \u2014 well, but \u2014 but you have that complex of guilt, you\nknow, that he is my friend, I didn\u2019t do anything for him. A-A-And then you hear\nabout the other kids, a million and a half, you know, and I survived and they didn\u2019t.\nAnd why did I survive? A-And you know, for many years, while I was busy\nworking in the off \u2014 in the \u2014 in the pharmacy, and my wife can tell you, I was okay.\nIt was when I stopped working that all this came back to me, a-and it to \u2014 to this\nday, you know, I\u2019m very much troubled. And \u2014 and for a while, I had to get some\nhelp. Well, that, I guess is enough.",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: A-As an interviewer, or interviewee, 1s it?",

By the way, you can even get a much clearer picture,\nsince you are at the Holocaust Museum, go into the library, ask for the book, then\nlook up my name. An \u2014 because \u2014 an-and by the way, the \u2014 Deborah\nOppenheimer, the producer, gave me a copy of the book, an-and thanked me for\nthe contribution I made to it. I don\u2019t mean financially. I would love to \u2014 and they\ngave us a copy, but it\u2019s a\u2014 o-of the film, but it\u2019s a VCR, a-and \u2014 and \u2014 and if they\nhave it now on the CD \u2014",

        "Q: Yes.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: You see. So when I saw that film, in a way, I felt better.

So \u2014 so yo-you spend a couple of\nhours together, a-and I hope I didn\u2019t overwhelm y-you with my story.",

But then, with the depression, the factory f-folded up and he went into\nthe leather business, selling supplies to shoe repair shops. And it was a \u2014 I imagine,\na-as a child I really didn\u2019t appreciate the \u2014 the difficulty that \u2014 that it was for him to\nearn a living, but we managed.",

And the apartment was\nOctober 17, 2010\nabout a \u2014 consisted of about two and a half rooms. A-And in the bedroom \u2014 all six\nof us slept in that one bedroom. It was a big bedroom, but I would sleep with my\nbrother, and then that was the custom. And if we had visitors, by the way, which\nhappened from time to time, people who came from Radom, where they had\noriginally come from, then the two boys, my brother and I would sleep on the floor.\nSpread out a blanket on the floor, and the guests would stay in the bed. But that was\nthe custom, and the \u2014 we really expected that this would happen, and di-di-didn\u2019t\naffect us in any way, or didn\u2019t bother us sleeping on the floor, because we slept just\nas well on the floor as in bed, as \u2014 as \u2014 as kids.",
        "A: Well, we lived in the 20\" district, known as the Brigittenau, about two blocks\nfrom the Danube. And we lived on the fourth floor, no elevators, no running water\nin the apartment. You went out in the hallway, where there was a cold water faucet\nthat you got the water from, and then would bring it in the home, and \u2014 and then\nthere was a\u2014 a bathroom, it was sort of a \u2014 just a \u2014 a toilet, which was shared b-\nbetween two apartments. A-And that \u2014 and that was the style, an-and that\u2019s all I\nsaw, and any people I came in contact with, they all seemed to have a similar setup\nexcept sometimes the apartment was even smaller than ours. So, there was no \u2014\nliving in the fourth floor, there was no elevator, you walked. And my grandmother\nOctober 17, 2010\nwould many times say, oh those steps, they\u2019re killing me.

        "A: Well, he spoke both. So whatever the circumstances were, he could respond. But\nthe \u2014 most of the time, the people that he dealt with likewise were immigrants from\nadjoining countries, because Austria was a more modern place and it offered\ngreater opportunities than smaller countries, I mean \u2014 not smaller countries, you\nknow, but \u2014 but th \u2014 not as advanced countries. So he would speak \u2014 when he dealt\nOctober 17, 2010\nwith Gentiles, he spoke German, and with Jewish people, yeah, it was always \u2014\nYiddish was the international language.",
        "A: Yes. I always attended elementary school, and then \u2014",
        "A: No, a state. Yeah, public school. Which was very good. I attended public school,\nf-four years of elementary, and then we switched over to something called\nhauptschule, which was a sort of a\u2014 I guess in America you\u2019d call it middle\nschool. And in my case, I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t even finish the middle school, because once\nHitler came in, none of us were able to attend any school, we were kicked out of\nschool, and \u2014 and I sw-switched over to a Jewish school for a while, called Talmud\nTorah in the second district in Vienna. The second district was heavily populated\nby Jewish people, and they used to call it Matzoh Insel. Matzoh Island.",
        "A: No, n-not really. Only training for Bar Mitzvah, where a year ahead of time, I\nwould sit down with someone, not a rabbi, but one of the Hassids, who would teach\nme the Torah portion that I was supposed to read at my Bar Mitzvah, which\nOctober 17, 2010\noccurred in \u00b037, actually four months before Hitler came in. And it happened to be\na very momentous occasion in my life. You might find it funny, my grandmother\nwas at first a little upset that I would have my Bar Mitzvah staged at the Klikee(ph)\ntemple. Why\u2019? Because the Klikee(ph) temple had an organ. And having an organ in\na temple, that \u2014 that was not kosher enough, so she wanted me to have it somewhere\nelse. But I liked the Klikee(ph) temple, and I was going there. So I had to tell her\nthat although they have this organ, they never use it. And the only time they use it\nwas on Sundays when on occasion they have a wedding. But the mere fact that the\norgan was there, that was enough reason for her not to particularly enjoy being\nthere.",
        "A: In\u2014 from grade one, I experienced anti-Semitism. Six years old, I go into grade\none, another kid \u2014 they find out very soon whether you\u2019re Christian or not, even at\nsix. And he called me a Christ killer, and you know, I didn\u2019t know what that was. I\nsaid \u2014 you know, what he was talking about. And \u2014 and it was not \u2014 when I came\nhome, I asked my mother. And she said, oh, pay no attention, or this is something\nthat they\u2019re \u2014 where they\u2019re taught at home not to like certain people, but you\u2019re\ngonna hear this, just \u2014 h-he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying, so just forget about it.\nOctober 17, 2010\nBut you mean \u2014 you very soon learn.

        "A: I think I\u2014I probably was around eight or nine, a-an-and \u2014 and when class lets\nout, then we started fights. And many a day I\u2019d come home with a bloody nose\nbecause at that time, when somebody hit you, you \u2014 you struck back. And I was\nnever hesitant, so it\u2019s oh \u2014 you know, even as I went on to middle school, you\nknow, I \u2014 somebody said something to me, called me a dirty Jew, you know, I'd let\nhim have it. And you learn that if it\u2019s one person, you take him on, but if there\u2019s a\ngroup, I figured I\u2019d better run. But I was never scared, al-although my mother in\nparticular always told me not to get involved, or \u2014 or \u2014 you know, walk away, run\naway, but I never did.",
        "A: I was always scared to tell my father, because \u2014 because he was the enforcer, you\nsee, so I dealt mostly with my mother. I \u2014 I had a mean \u2014 when I was \u2014 and \u2014 and\nOctober 17, 2010\nalso, many times, I \u2014 I admit, I didn\u2019t listen. I \u2014 I was \u2014 my mother would say, a\nreckless person. In the summer of \u201934, I asked my mother if I could go swimming.\nAnd I loved swimming, even as a child, you know. And she said no, you stay home.\nSo I said to \u2014 okay, well, can I go downstairs, you know, be on the street? All right,\nbe on the street, but I want you home before too long. So I sai-said fine. So, I ran\ndownstairs with my bathing suit to go swimming, that she had told me not to do.\nAnd I \u2014 in my eagerness to cross the street, didn\u2019t look, and I was hit by a truck.\nAnd I had several fractures and lacerations and concussion and spent three months\nin the hospital. That was an important lesson. But being somewhat reckless, rising\nto whatever challenge that came along, has always been a part of me. I-I was, to\nsome extent, not to make myself some sort of a hero, I was always aggressive. And\nsometimes it got me into trouble, but it never changed my mind. This was in 734. I\nhave another event in \u201937, when \u2014 wh-which had a great impact on my life. There\nwere three boys, and we were walking along the Danube [indecipherable] only a\nthree or four minute walk from where we lived, so \u2014 and this was in the winter of\n\u00b037, late October, when, as we\u2019re walking along, we notice something bobbing up\nand down in the wa \u2014 in the water, and we didn\u2019t know at first what it was. And\nthen we recognized that this was a person, you know, what is she doing in the\nwater? So \u2014 so it dawned on us that this person 1s about to drown. So two of us ran\nOctober 17, 2010\ndown the embankment and jumped into the water. I was 13 \u2014 not quite 13, and my\nfriend was not quite 15. And the third person ran to get the police. So, if you know\nanything about the Danube, and I know, since you are from Hungary, you know\nthe Danube, it\u2019s a very swift river. You\u2019re not going to swim against the current,\nyou just can\u2019t, it just knocks you down. So \u2014 so if you go in here, you\u2019re gonna\ncome out way, way down on the other side. So after a while we \u2014 we struggled, but\nwe were able to get her to th-the embankment and \u2014 and ou-out of the water. And\nby that time, the third person had run to get the police, and when we got to \u2014 when\nwe got her out to the side o-of the river, the police was there, and the ambulance\nwas there. And they picked her up and th \u2014 it was a woman, and they took her away.\nAnd then the police took the two of us to the police station. And there they gave us\nsome hot chocolate and d-dry out. And a man came and started questioning us and\nthen he took a picture. And we paid no attention as to who he was, or what was up,\nwhat \u2014 we were there several hours, and then they said to us, oh, now you can go\nhome. So I went home, and I ha \u2014 I hate to describe to you what took place when I\ngot home. First of all, 1t was Friday evening, and I\u2019m supposed to go with my father\nto the synagogue. And I wasn\u2019t home. And, where were you? [indecipherable] So,\nI was so scared to tell what happened to \u2014 to my mother, so I said, do you know\nwhat? We were playing by the water, and I fell in. Then came, how many times\nOctober 17, 2010\nhave I told you to stay away from the water? When are you finally going to listen,\nand so forth. And \u2014 and wa-was plenty of scolding and reprimand, you know, n-no\nfood, you know, we\u2019re not going to give you anything. And of course I \u2014 I was so\ndisheveled, you know, and tha \u2014 look \u2014 looked terrible. A-And it wasn\u2019t until the\nnext day, when people stopped my mother on the street and started congratulating\nher, and she didn\u2019t know what for. And then she found out that there had been a\npicture in the newspaper, which described what had taken place. And then she came\nback and started questioning, what \u2014 what really happened, you see, so sh-she was\nof two \u2014 two \u2014 two different feelings. In the one, she says, do you realize how\ndangerous it was for you, what you did? A-And, this was very reckless. And the\nother way she \u2014 she was proud that I had participated in \u2014 1n saving a person. But\nth-the recklessness was a major factor, that you would go to such an extreme, which\nwas very, very unusual. And by the way, I have a picture here, as it appeared in a\nnewspaper, blew up and I\u2019ll \u2014 Pll show it to you later; and also comments that were\nabout me specifically. It just so happened that this particular event became a bone\nof contention between the Austrian more or less public press, which for the most\npart was anti-Semitic, and the Jewish press, an-and the Jewish publications, who\ntook the German newspapers to task. It \u2014 1t just so happened that the two boys who\njumped into the water were Jewish. The boy who ran to get the police was Gentile.\nOctober 17, 2010\nIt never occurred to us that this would ever be a problem, but it was a big bone of\ncontention, a big discussion. The \u2014 I mean, in particular th-the Jewish press,\nbecause the Jewi \u2014 the Jews were always characterized as being cowards. Jews \u2014\nJews didn\u2019t want to be in the military, and Jews were afraid and \u2014 and unreliable,\nand \u2014 and they\u2019re not really Austrian and so forth, and \u2014 but here was an example\nwhere two Jewish boys jumped in the water. We didn\u2019t hesitate, we didn\u2019t ask who\nit was, we didn\u2019t ask what religion she was. We just acted because we \u2014 we felt we\n\u2014 we should do something, you see? And I have various correspondence which\nrefers to that particular event, in \u2014 in several organizations who got involved. This\nwas in October or \u2014 late October of 1937. One month later I had my Bar Mitzvah,\nand at the Bar Mitzvah there was a lot of congratulation, because this was only a\nmonth later, and the Kultusgemeinde \u2014 the Kultusgemeinde, it\u2019s called a cultural\nassociation, but really it\u2019s not a cultural association, 1-1t was a sort of a semi-\ngovernment authority for the Jewish people. And every Jew in Austria had to deal\nwith the Kultusgemeinde at least three times in their lives. The Kultusgemeinde\nissued the birth certificate, the marriage certificate and the death certificate. So \u2014 so\nevery Jew had to register with the Kultusgemeinde, which later on also turned out\nto be a detriment for the Jewish people, because when the Nazis came in and\nwanted a list, all they had to do is go to the Kultusgemeinde and have a list of any\nOctober 17, 2010\n\u2014 of a Jew living anywhere in the city. So at that time the Kultusgemeinde\nrepresentative came to the temple, and th-they gave me a di-diploma of recognition\nfor what I had done, and \u2014 and also a watch. And this was the first watch that I had\never owned, so \u2014 so to me that \u2014 that was a big deal.",
        "A: Mostly it \u2014 it dealt \u2014 they were attacking the press for their attitude toward Jews,\nthe reason for their hostility to Jews, and their idiocy as pertaining anti-Semitism.\nAnd their failure to recognize what we had done. The majority of press had nothing,\nno comment whatsoever. There was only one particular newspaper, it\u2019s called \u201cDas\nKleine Blatt,\u201d which carried a small picture of the two of us, and \u2014 and our age, and\nour name, and one paragra \u2014 one sentence, actually; and that was it. An-And no\nother publication \u2014 public \u2014 publication, who certainly at that time in the country, if\nit had been anybody else, it would have been played up big, you see? So, it\u2019s\ninteresting, no attention was \u2014 was paid to it. Forty \u2014 40 years later, my son, who\nOctober 17, 2010\nwas working in Congress, and I had just given an interview in Norfolk, Virginia,\nwhere I was living at the time, and they wrote up the experience that I had, and my\n\u2014my background and so forth. And when he read it, h-he showed it to the\ncongressman. And congressman was Whitehurst from Norfolk. He says well \u2014\nwell, we\u2019ve got to do something, this is not right. So he wrote a letter to the\nambassador, giving him a \u2014 a copy of the article in the newspaper, and that I had\nnever received any recognition. So the ambassador at that time was Thomas\nKlestil. Thomas Klestil went on from the embassy, the ambassador being there in\nWashington, to become the foreign minister of Austria. And then, from the foreign\nministry, became the president of Austria. So the ambassador said that he had\nnever heard of this, but he was going to investigate.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how old he was. I \u2014 I suppose he was in his 40s, you know. But he\nwould investigate, and it was maybe a couple of months later he came back and said\nyes, we have a record of this. And they arranged a reception for me, and I met the\nambassador, and he asked me if I would be willing to come back at the\ngovernment\u2019s invitation to Austria, they want to honor me. And eventually I was\ngiven a gold medal for heroism, 40 years after the event.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: I-It probably \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t have the \u2014 th-the date now. It \u2014 probably in the 70s.",
        "A: It was a \u2014 let\u2019s see now, I\u2019m trying to think. Yeah, \u201978 maybe, something like\nthat. But this is not the end of the story. When Hitler came in, as soon as Hitler and\nthe Nazis took over in Austria, my mother was the driving force. She felt that we\ncould not possibly stay on in Austria, we had to get out. But there were many\npeople at first, when Hitler came in that says, well, you know what\u2019s going on, the\n\u2014 you know, with the plundering of shops and the beating up of Jewish people, and\npeople s-stationing themselves, Nazi personnel in uniform stationing them \u2014 1n front\nof Jewish shops, from \u2014 not to let anybody in. I mean, not to let any Gentiles in to \u2014\nto patronize the Jewish shops. They recognized right away that we cannot live \u2014 go\non living in Austria, we had to get out. So she wrote the letter to, you know, who \u2014\nwho do you write? A cousin of a cousin of a cousin that yo \u2014 she once heard of, and\nso forth. But she wrote a letter and she described our plight, that my \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, lived in Baltimore, a-and whether or not he would be willing to send an\naffidavit, and then she asked for an affidavit for my father and my brother, and she\n\u2014 and at that time she felt, you know, let me get the men out. You know, th \u2014\nOctober 17, 2010\nnobody\u2019s going to touch the women, and you know, and children and such, you\nknow, what \u2014",
        "A: This was \u201938, yes. Probably as early as April \u201938. Hitler came in in March, 13\",\nI believe.",
        "A: Yes, they talked about it. And \u2014 and we knew about it, but we felt that the\nAustrians are very patriotic, and oh, we are social democrats, and oh \u2014 no,\nAustria\u2019s not going to become involved, you know \u2014 you know, this is Germany.\nAnd communications at that time were not what they are today. So whatever was\nwritten in the paper and so forth, 1-1t was like a different world, going from one\ncountry to the other. You \u2014 you \u2014 actually, you couldn\u2019t go, un-unless you \u2014 you\nhad to have visas. You ri \u2014 you \u2014 you can go to \u2014 to Hungary in an hour and a half,\nI\u2019m in \u2014 1n \u2014 today I\u2019m in Hungary. Not in those days. You had to have a \u2014 a visa\nor \u2014 to leave, and a visa to enter, a-and it was \u2014 you had to have a passport, and it\nOctober 17, 2010\nwas a complicated affair, you know, and \u2014 and transportation was not what it 1s\ntoday. I mean, for me, as a\u2014 as \u2014 as a child, it w \u2014 it was a big deal to \u2014 to get ona\nbus, and to \u2014 and to \u2014 and to get on a streetcar. Oh, oh, that was an exciting event.\nAs a matter of fact, somebody asked me once, how old were you when you first\nrode in a passenger automobile? And the first time I rode in a passenger automobile,\nI-I was a-around 16 years old, in \u2014 in London. In London, trying to take a taxi to \u2014\nto the train station. That was in 1940, you know, and \u2014 and I\u2019d never ridden in a \u2014 in\ntaxi before, but this was the first time.",
        "A: N-N-N-No, you \u2014 you took a \u2014 first of all, the first means of transportation was\nto walk, you see, that was custom, the \u2014 no matter how far it was, you walked. A-\nAnd aside from walking, you took the streetcar. And if you \u2014 buses were not\navailable, except if you wanted to leave the city, that\u2019s where they had buses. And \u2014",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have a bicycle, no. Because if I had a bicycle, I\u2019d have to drag it up four\nf\u2014 four floors of steps. And I-I think that my parents would have been more\nconcerned with safety, e-even then, because the \u2014 th-they knew that I probably\nwould use the bike to go to areas where they wouldn\u2019t want me to go. Where there\u2019s\nOctober 17, 2010\nmaybe some traffic and so forth. So most of the time I-I just walked. I walked to\nschool.",
        "A: Well, the public school was around the corner, the elementary school. And the\nother one was a little further, m-maybe a 15 minute walk. Now, when I went in\nTalmud Torah School, sometimes I\u2019d see a horse-driven wagon, and we would\njump on that, and when the \u2014 when the driver was \u2014 wasn\u2019t looking, you know. So\nI\u2019?d jump on it and \u2014 and take a ride with him, and then jump off. Which too was not\nthat safe. But that\u2019s what we did.",
        "A: No, no, he was very conservative. I \u2014 I was the trouble maker. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhy, but the \u2014 I\u2019ve done that throughout my life, you know, army service, I did\nthings that \u2014 on reflection now, when I think back I says, oh my God, that was\ndumb. And working \u2014 I\u2019m a pharmacist and we \u2014 we \u2014 we had our own business in\nNorfolk, Virginia, and in the 80s, I experienced two hold-ups, and had a gun to my\nhead twice, you know, and you know, people would say, well, were you scared, and\nso forth. I say, yes, of course I \u2014 I was scared, but \u2014 but it \u2014 but one thing I can tell\nyou, I did not panic. Of course, you know, I\u2019m skipping the story back and forth,\nOctober 17, 2010\nmaybe. So \u2014 so the first time that I had a gun to my head, it was by two black men,\nand they wanted Talwin, which mimics opium, but it wasn\u2019t even a narcotic, and I\nwas astonished when they asked for it, you see. But then he asked for my wallet, so\nI gave him my wallet. Then he said to me, kneel down. And I said to him, if you\u2019re\ngoing to shoot me, you\u2019re going to have to look at me, I\u2019m not kneeling. And he\nsays \u2014 and he says, all right. And he turned around and walked \u2014 and ran out. By the\nway, he got shot and killed two days later, trying to rob another pharmacy. The\nsecond time maybe was \u2014 maybe three \u2014 three weeks later, and this time it was by\ntwo whites. And they were more knowledgeable, they were prepared. They came\nwith an empty pillowcase, and they knew \u2014 they probably had shopped us, and they\nknew where I kept the narcotics. So \u2014 so they wanted the morphine, and the\nDilaudid and the Demerol, and the codeine and opium and so forth that we had; so\nthey got all of that. And then, you know, he\u2019s holding a pistol, while the other one is\nloading up on \u2014 on whatever we had in narcotics. And then he said to me, ge \u2014 let\nme have your wallet. So I said to him, let me \u2014I says, give me \u2014 give you my\nwallet? I says, do you realize what problems that is? I says, I gotta run here and\nthere to get new identification and new driver\u2019s license. I got to stop all the credit\ncards, I says, it\u2019s a whole lot of trouble. And so he says, all right, keep the wallet.\nAnd people couldn\u2019t believe, you \u2014 you actually did that? I says, yes. So, I\u2014I-\nOctober 17, 2010\nthroughout life, I don\u2019t panic. I-I size up the situation a-as to what I need to do and\n\u2014 and act accordingly. And \u2014 and I feel that when you panic, then many times the\nperson who is the aggressor, will also panic, and then you don\u2019t know what to\nexpect. People would ask me, they would \u2014 found it strange that the first time that\nyou were held up, you had two blacks, right? Yeah. And the second time it was two\nwhites? Yeah. Don\u2019t you find it strange? I says, no, I says, my \u2014 my pharmacy was\nan equal opportunity pharmacy. So \u2014 so they \u2014 they would laugh, it was fun. But\nafter that, I hired the police to come in and \u2014 an-and they were \u2014 every \u2014 every\nafternoon and evening I would have police in \u2014 in the pharmacy, and my sons urged\nme, you know, it\u2019s time to get out. You know, you \u2014 you can\u2019t keep this up.\nBecause it was true, because you \u2014 you become apprehensive that every time the\ndoor opens, you don\u2019t know who 1s coming in. And the problem with drugs today in\nAmerica is so \u2014 so pervasive, that you just don\u2019t know what to anticipate. A-And\nyou live and work in a form of tension. So although I was only 59 at the time, I \u2014 I\ndecided to call it quits. I sold the pharmacy and retired at 59. And I took a three\nmonth vacation, you know, traveled to Europe; your country, Hungary, I was there\nfor about a month. Enjoyed it. A-And when I came back I was restless and didn\u2019t\nknow what to do, so I went to work for the navy, the navy hospital in the \u2014 as a\npharmacist. And I worked until the 90s a-and then I quit a-and stopped working.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, I think so.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes. He happened to live on the floor below us. And it was interesting that when\nHitler came in, although we were very close friends, he stopped me on the\nstairways one day, and he told me that Herbert, you understand that we can\u2019t be\nfriends any longer. So I said yes, I understand. An-And that was the end, I thought.\nA couple days later, we meet up again on the steps, and th \u2014 he stopped me, and he\nsaid, would I do him a favor? I says, what \u2014 what is it you \u2014 you want? He says,\nwell, I need a pair of white socks, and I know you have some. Would you loan me\nyour white socks? So I said, well, why do you need my white socks? He says, well,\nhe says, you know, he says, I belong to the Hitlerjugend, and white socks are part\nof the uniform. And I was told to stand downstairs in front of Herr Gros\u2019(ph) shop,\nto make sure that no Christian people go in. So I need the socks. So I\u2014 his name\nwas Bertie. So I said, Bertie, I \u2014 I\u2014 I have no idea where the socks are, or if I still\nOctober 17, 2010\nhave them. I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think that I have it. And maybe he understood that \u2014\nwhat I was saying, but I\u2014 I gave him no socks. But as close a friend we were,\novernight, Hitlerjugend, y-you know \u2014 you know. And this was the biggest\nsurprise that I had, that the \u2014 the very same people who lived with you in \u2014 in the\nhouse, an-a-and knew the family and \u2014 and guten tag and guten naft(ph) and this\nand that an-and they\u2019re friendly, and suddenly yo \u2014 tell you they have been in the\nunderground f-for years, under \u2014 as Nazis. And this is unbelievable. I remember \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, when Hitler came in. They said, yeah, we been in underground. I\nremember a neighbor came in that we were very friendly with \u2014 as a matter of fact,\nthe family \u2014 they were a tailor, and my folks wanted to have a \u2014 a big table when\nthey had the reception after the Bar Mitzvah, th \u2014 in our apartment. They didn\u2019t\nhave a big enough table so we \u2014 so they loaned us the \u2014 that \u2014 their work table\nwhere they made suits or coats or whatever the \u2014 a tailor does. So \u2014 so \u2014 so the\nwoman came over, Frau Bodichka(ph), and she\u2019s friends with my mother a-and\nshe\u2019s saying to my mother, you have nothing to fear. Yo-You are good Jews.\nNobody\u2019s going to touch you. But, she says, maybe the people who live across the\nstreet, she says, maybe they got it coming to them. And as young as I was at the\ntime, you know, just 13 years old, I said \u2014 I says, how do I know that the people\nOctober 17, 2010\nacross the street aren\u2019t saying the same thing about us? You see, but wa \u2014 one thing\nthat I-I later became aware of, that 1-if I was 13, it was just a number. I really\novernight became an adult. A-And you recognize right away that things are not\ngoing to be the way they were. And for instance, when my mother had written to\nAmerica, to distant cousins for an affidavit, they responded and were willing to\nsend the affidavit. But I was going to be there, wi \u2014 stay in Vienna. And I felt I was\nju \u20141n as much \u2014 in as much danger as anybody else. And there was a Jewish boy\nacross the str-street, Teddy Katz, he told me one day, let\u2019s run away. Don\u2019t say\nanything to anybody, we\u2019ll run away. I says, where do you want to run? He says,\nwell, we\u2019ll go to Czechoslovakia. I says, who do we know in Czechoslovakia? I\nsays, ha \u2014 I says, we have no money. I says \u2014 I says re \u2014 we gonna cross the border\nillegally? Yes. I says, when we get there, then what? So, I said no, I \u2014 I \u2014 it just\ndoesn\u2019t make any sense. But I wanted to get out, so I had registered with what was\nknown then as the Palestina(ph) office, the Pales-Palestine office, for aliyah. But \u2014\nbut I didn\u2019t hear. So I deci \u2014",
        "A: None.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: Oh, no, I had no intention of going to Palestine, or \u2014 for the most part, you\nknow, life was okay. You know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s our country, you know, I\u2019m Austrian. I\nwas very patriotic, you know, because it\u2019s drilled into you in school, you know, and\nyou know, Austria, our homeland and the Austrian history, Austrian-Hungarian\nempire, the Kaiser and so forth, so \u2014 so \u2014 the imperial Austria, oh we \u2014 we stopped\nthe \u2014 the Turks when they attacked and \u2014 and if you go downs \u2014 downtown in the\nfirst district, you can see where the \u2014 the last shell is still imbedded in \u2014 in the\nconcrete and so forth. S-So Austrians are quite patriotic. But th \u2014 I felt that I was in\ndanger, and I wanted to get out of the country, especially after Kristallnacht. On\nKristallnacht, after the assassination of the diplomat in Paris, and with Hershel\nGrynszpan, who shot the embassy personnel in \u2014 in Paris. It wasn\u2019t ambassador,\nbut the \u2014 an assistant to the ambassador, whatever his position was, I don\u2019t recall.\nBut I knew that something was going to happen, that there would be revenge. I\nmean, I-I just \u2014 you \u2014 you could almost smell it in the air, that something was going\nto happen.",
        "A: Yes.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: In March.",
        "A: In March.",
        "A: Well, I can tell you I\u2014 I was a\u2014 a member of the Hakura(ph) swim team.\nHakura(ph) means strength. And I was member of the swim team. On March the\n10\", I believe it was a Thursday, I had just gone there for a practice session. When I\nwalked out, I saw a large mass of people, and were yelling and screaming, and as \u2014\nas a kid I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m always attracted to something that \u2014 that\u2019s different as a \u2014 I want\nto know what\u2019s going on. So \u2014 so I approached them, that was only across the street\nfrom Dianabad(ph). I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re acquainted with Vienna or not. So, if\nyou cross the street you come to Schwedenzplatz(ph), so \u2014 so there they had a big\ndemonstration. Gra \u2014 a great mass of people, with this social democratic flag and\nwhatnot. And on \u2014 and the police standing in front of me. And on the other side, a\nsmall group of Nazis, and yelling at each other, and so forth. This was Thursday.\nAnd on Sunday we\u2019re gonna have a plevicide whether or not Austria wants to join\nwith Hitler. This wa \u2014 this was by order of the chancellor of Austria, Schuschnigg,\nOctober 17, 2010\nKurt Schuschnigg. So when I saw that, I says oh, Austrians will never vote for\nHitler. As I \u2014 so as \u2014 I really wasn\u2019t concerned until the next evening, when over\nthe radio, suddenly I heard that the plevicide had been cancelled, and the\ngovernment had abdicated, and new people were coming to \u2014 into government, and\nthey were all Nazi officials. I says \u2014 then I recognized re \u2014 this does not sound\ngood. Something is gonna happen. And it \u2014 and true enough, why \u2014 on Sunday,\nGerman troops marched in, and announce a gov \u2014 overthrew the government, and\nwe \u2014 we were part of Germany. We had been annexed, or anschluss. And this \u2014\nand suddenly we\u2019re oven \u2014 over-overnight we\u2019re pri \u2014 night, I was confident that\nAustria would never become part of Germany, suddenly e-everyone \u2014 everyone\nthat you met wu \u2014 seemingly seemed to be connected to \u2014 with the Nazi party all\nalong, in the underground [indecipherable]. And everybody ha-had this \u2014 the\narmband on with the Nazi insignia, and flags all over the city, and I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand how suddenly people that I \u2014 I felt 1f you give them the chance to vote\nwould have voted against the Nazis, now everybody seemed to be for it. The \u2014 the\ncardinal of Austria, Innitzer, welcomed Hitler as, you know, the native son\nreturning to his country and so forth, and \u2014 and 1t seemed so unbelievable, how\novernight something as dramatic a-as a \u2014 as giving away everything and becoming a\ndevoted Nazi, a-and the Jewish people going to be the target, you see, because we\nOctober 17, 2010\nheard it con-consistently, with the editor of the newspapers, or ev \u2014 ev \u2014 everything\nbecame pro-Nazis, a-and you saw no opposition whatsoever. Everybody was for the\nNazis. And the people were f-for the Nazis. Either that, or afraid, because\nseemingly 100 percent were not necessarily in favor of what was taking place, but it\nseemed to be the vast majority were. And the plundering took place, and the beating\ntook place and the dem \u2014 the humiliation took place, you know, all the graffiti that\nhad been anti-Nazi \u2014 they take elderly Jewish people, and sometimes religious\npeople, whoever they were, peop-people of recognition, professional people, you\nknow, and would humiliate them, give him a toothbrush and tell him to scrub the\nstreets and so forth, and spit at them and make fun. And the people would stand\naround and laugh.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, before. Could \u2014 could we stop one second?",
        "A: I-I want to go to the bathroom.",
        "A: Where wer \u2014 where are we now?\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: On Kristallnacht, no \u2014 November nine, we saw what was going on on the street,\nthat the shops are being plundered, a-and the Jewish people are \u2014 on the street were\nbeing beaten up, so you\u2019re afraid to \u2014 as to what may happen. And the greatest fear\nwas to hear the knock on the door. When you \u2014 when you heard that knock on the\ndoor, we froze. And I could see the expression on my \u2014 my father and my mother\u2019s\nface, and I \u2014 and I knew they \u2014 they were scared. And it passes onto the children\nwhen you \u2014 wh-when they see that the \u2014 the parents are \u2014 are frightened. And the \u2014\nthere\u2019s a knock on the door and the order, open up. So, we opened up the door, and\nto \u2014 two uniformed SA people walked in, one a little older tha-than the other one.\nThe other one licked \u2014 looked to be sa \u2014 someone maybe 18 or 19 years old,\nsomething like that. And they demanded to see my brother, specifically asking for\nba \u2014 for him by his name, but he was not home. So they didn\u2019t believe it, so they\nwent through the apartment, searching for him, and he wasn\u2019t there. So, since he\nwasn\u2019t there, one of them, the elderly one said, we\u2019ll take him, pointing to me. And\nit was then that my mother started pleading and crying, saying he 1s only a little\nboy, he hasn\u2019t done anything, and please leave him alone, you know \u2014 you know,\njust begging him. And \u2014 and it was then that the younger SA man said, it wasn\u2019t\nhim. Tha-That\u2019s it, it wasn\u2019t him. And they said oh \u2014 okay, we\u2019ll come back in a\nOctober 17, 2010\nlittle while. So, when I heard it wasn\u2019t him, a-as I \u2014 I surmised that maybe my\nbrother had gotten into a fight, and now was the time to get even, you see. And the\nmere fact that it wasn\u2019t him, saved me. And because my mother, as soon as they\nleft, told me to run downstairs and intercept my brother from coming home, and\ntelling him to stay with a friend, not to come home. And \u2014 and then she sent me to\ntell my uncle not to go home, and to stay with his mother-in-law. That was\ninteresting too, and h-he \u2014 he told me later on, that they came to his mother-in-law\u2019s\nhome, you know, everybody knew already where most likely somebody would \u2014\nwould go if you want to pick him up. And when he heard the knock on the door, he\ncrawled under the table, and the table had a long tablecloth. So they were searching\nthe house, the \u2014 the apartment that they lived in, and they didn\u2019t see him. And they\nwere pounding the table, saying well, you be sure to \u2014 to let us know as soon as he\ncomes here. Well, he was under the table. He survived. His wife and his son did not\nsurvive. But i-it was, th-the following day, on the 10\u201c of November, when I wa \u2014\nwas on my way to go to the Palestina(ph) office to check on the \u2014 on my aliyah,\nwhich is immigration to then known Palestine or Israel. When I came downstairs, I\nsaw a\u2014a big truck and a lot of people around the truck jeering and laughing and\nenjoying themselves. And the police is there also, just standing there. And I was\nwondering what the heck is going on here, what\u2019s it all about, you know? And \u2014 and\nOctober 17, 2010\nthe house right next door to us, there was a shop, a shop carrying bedding\nequipment, blankets and pillows and pillowcases and towels and stuff like that. And\nI noticed that they were carrying stuff out from the shop, and putting it on the truck.\nWell, you recognize right away, it doesn\u2019t take long, as to what\u2019s going on. They\u2019re\njust confiscating whatever goods he has and putting it on the truck. And then I saw\nthe owner standing there beside the \u2014 the shop. Hi-His name was shp \u2014 H-Herr\nSchpringer(ph). A Mr. Schpringer(ph). A-And he\u2019s white-faced, scared. And\nwhen they had just about emptied the shop, Mr. \u2014 Herr Schpringer(ph), being a\nbusiness man, walks up to the head honcho Nazi there, and asks for a receipt. And\nth-the storm trooper turned around and yelled to the crowd, Herr Schpringer(ph)\nwants a receipt. And everybody starts laughing and cheering and screaming. And\nthen he grabs Schpringer(ph) by the neck, the collar of his neck, and turned him\naround and gave him a kick in the rear, and Schpringer(ph) fell down on the\npavement. And he said, here Jew, this is your receipt. I \u2014 I witnessed that. A-And I-I\nfelt that even going to the aliyah office may not be such a good idea. I says \u2014 so I\ndecided to go to the home of the chief rabbi.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: Just standing be \u2014 not part. I\u2019m standing ba \u2014 little distance away, y-you know,\nmaybe \u2014 but I\u2019m a \u2014 nobody\u2019s paying any attention to me, you see, I\u2019m just a kid.",
        "A: Y-Y-You know \u2014 you know, a-again, I-I did things a-as a kid, that when I reflect\nnow, I says, this was really stupid. I mean th \u2014 I had no awareness. I \u2014 spontaneous\nresponse to different things. For instance, if I told you I saw Eichmann, and asked\nhim to put a country on my passport, it\u2019s only years later that I even became aware\nwho he was. I had no idea Eichmann, I never heard of him. But I went to \u2014 to the\nRothschild palace, which was the Nazi headquarters, and I walked in there \u2014 well,\nwhen you walk in there, everything is heil Hitler, you know, an-and I\u2019m not going\nto come in and say heil Hitler, so wha-what am I going to say? Griiss gott. Which\nwas the way we normally greeted each other, griiss gott, and \u2014 greet God. And \u2014\nand everybody looks up, you know, what\u2019s this Jewish kid doing here? You see, so\nI asked \u2014 when Eichmann asked me what it is I want, and I told him, I need to get a\ncountry entered \u2014 because I ca \u2014 I can\u2019t remember exactly what \u2014 you had to choose\non the passport what country you n \u2014 had to have on the passport. And if it wasn\u2019t\nlisted, then you couldn\u2019t go to that country. And England wasn\u2019t listed. I never\nthought of going to England. And so of course, this is somewhat later.\n35October 17, 2010\nOctober 17, 2010\nBeginning File Three",
        "A: Yeah, because \u2014 because I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not t-telling you step by step.",
        "A: Oh, orig \u2014 originally had planned to go, th-then I said to myself, no, no, this may\nbe too dangerous. So \u2014 so I went to \u2014 actually, it wasn\u2019t that night either, on\nrecollection. I\u2014 I went \u2014 I did go to the aliyah office. I\u2019m sorry, I had to correct\nmyself. I went to the aliyah office, a-and when I came there, it was packed with\npeople; men and women. And I wasn\u2019t there very long when the SS showed up, and\nthey sent men to one side, and the women and children to the other side. And I had\nhad my Bar Mitzvah, so it came up to me to decide which side should I go on? And\nI felt that maybe I better play it safe. So I decided to go with the women, although\nyou know, people who had had their Bar Mitzvah, they regard themselves already\nas men. But, you know, I \u2014 I says, I \u2014 I better play it safe. And it wasn\u2019t very long\nthereafter, when we had separated and we were in different rooms, that all the men\nwere taken away by truck. And later on I learned that they had been taken to\nOctober 17, 2010\nDachau. Had I stayed with the men, I would have wound up in Dachau, but I was\nwith the women. So they kept us there for an hour, an hour and a half, til they\ndecided what to do with us, what \u2014 they let us go. And here again comes the\nrecklessness. They let us go, and I\u2019m going out on the s \u2014 from the building. So I\nthought that more and more men will be coming to the building, and they\u2019re gonna\nget arrested, and maybe I ought to warn them. But in back of me, there\u2019s an SS\nman, right in the building. If you\u2019ve been to Vienna, I am \u2014 the building 1s still\nthere, and it\u2019s not far \u2014 the Hotel Metropol was Gestapo headquarters. It\u2019s only one\nblock away. And maybe two blocks away is the Kultusgemeinde on the Juden \u2014\non the Judengasse. So this was in the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the Aurelia street, you see,\nwhich on \u2014 only short walk where the aliyah office was. Years later I took my wife\nthere and I showed her where it was. A-And so I stood at the edge of the \u2014 the\npavement \u2014 pedes \u2014 pedestrian pavement, not the street, and as men were\napproaching me to go into the building, I would turn my head away and say, don\u2019t\ngo in, Gestapo. And invariably, they would say, what did you say? And I would\nrepeat, you know, but not looking directly at him, as if I \u2014 but the Gestapo in back\nof me was a trooper, noticed that people were coming up to me and turned around\nand walking away. So a-after three or four had done this, he comes out and yells for\nme to come back. And he wants to know, what did you say to the men? Was hast\nOctober 17, 2010\ndu gesagt? I says, I didn\u2019t say anything, I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014I-\u2014I said I\u2014 oh, you said\nsomething. I said, the only thing I said was I was here for some time and I just got\nout. That I waited a long time, but I just got out. That\u2019s not what you said, tell me\nwhat you said. So I stuck by my story. So yeah, they \u2014 he wanted \u2014 he really beat\nme, and then he kicked me down the steps. There were about three steps as \u2014 as you\nentered the building. So I fell over the three steps, and I got up, and I ran away.",
        "A: No, people were coming from the other side, apparently they \u2014 they may have\ncome from the Kultusgemeinde, approaching aliyah office, you see. I don\u2019t know\nif the Kultusgemeinde was open at that time or not, because this was right \u2014\nKristallnacht.",
        "A: Yes. This is still part of the \u2014 the pogrom.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh \u2014- oh yeah, yeah.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: Yeah. And I knew if they got into the building they\u2019d get arrested. And the \u2014\nmany years later, I felt that what I did at that time probably was more dangerous\nthan jumping into the Danube. And didn\u2019t even think of it, I just acted spontaneous.\nIt came to my mind that I can \u2014 I wish I had a name, or had recognized who \u2014 who\nany of these people were, but I had no idea. But you know, once I \u2014 I fell down the\nsteps, and you know, I had the black eye and I went home and my mother, she was\nreally in \u2014 in a panic. She says, we told you to stay home, we told you not to go\nhere, and told you this and that, you know, that \u2014 berated, you know, because\nparental concern, they know that when you\u2019re home, you know, at least we know\nwho you are or where you are, and \u2014 a-and we don\u2019t worry. But once a child \u2014 a-and\nI don\u2019t know if you have children yet, but when y \u2014 when you do, y-you become\naware that if you don\u2019t know where the child is, you begin to worry.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, I intercepted him, told him not to come home, and he went with a friend.\nBut he \u2014 the f \u2014 it was on the following day that I decided, first of all, it was useless\nOctober 17, 2010\nto go to the Kultusgemeinde, because the Kultusgemeinde, th-the line was for\nblocks, people standing 1n line, trying to get into the building to see the officials.",
        "A: An idea, information, maybe financial help because nobody was working, y-y-\nyou see, SO yo-you want to eat, you see, you need money. So maybe \u2014 maybe they\u2019 Il\nget a tip, which country, anywhere in the world, affords an opportunity that you can\ngo to and so forth. I-I decided that s-since I was known, with the notoriety of saving\nthis girl, that maybe this could be of help to me. So I went to see Israel Taglicht, a\nrabbi asr \u2014 Israel Taglicht, who was the chief rabbi of Vienna. I \u2014 I still remember,\nit was the first time I had been in \u2014 at his residence [indecipherable] really f\u2014\nbeautiful home, the flush red carpet. Cause this something that I hadn\u2019t seen before,\nyou see, so I rem \u2014 I remembered the red carpet. And he asked me what he could do\nfor me, a-and I asked him, you know, that I had applied for aliyah, I hadn\u2019t heard, is\nthere anything th \u2014 he could help me with. So, h-he refers me to see the executive\nsecretary of the Kultusgemeinde, who was Josef Lowenherz, Dr. Josef\nLowenherz, and he f \u2014 phoned him apparently, and he got through to him and I had\na pass. So, the following day, I went to see Lowenherz, and I didn\u2019t have to stand\nin line. I see all these people standing in line and he does \u2014 right away e \u2014 allowed\nto enter, with this pass. And I came to his office, and he knew about me, he knew\nOctober 17, 2010\nabout having saved this girl, and he said, you know, what can I do for you? And I\ntold him again I had applied for aliyah, I hadn\u2019t heard, can he do anything for me?\nAnd it was then that he lifted the phone, and he started talking to somebody. And it\nwas all about a Kindertransport. And, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. So\nwhen he put the phone down, I says, what \u2014 what is the Kindertransport? So he\nexplained to me that he is in negotiation with Eichmann. He didn\u2019t say Eichmann,\nhe said the Nazis. He did not know whether he\u2019s gonna be successful or not, but the\nidea is to have a transport of 1,000 children; 800 would go to England, the first\n800. The last 200 would be dropped off in Holland. And he said to me, I don\u2019t\nknow whether we will be successful in negotiation with Nazi authorities, he says,\nbut if you like, he says, Ill put your name on the list. So I said yes, what I got to\nlose, I says, yeah, put my name on the list, and I didn\u2019t think anything o-of \u2014 more\nabout it. I went home, and again where have you been, and this or that, you \u2014 why\naren\u2019t you \u2014 how many times to we have to tell you to stay home and so the litany\nof \u2014 of complaints that my mother had. But it was a \u2014 a week later that I was\nnotified that I\u2019d been \u2014 I had been chosen to participate in the transport.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: Th-They was fine. I was old enough that I want to get out. My mother was\nsatisfied that all the men, so c \u2014 old men will be go out of the way, a-and it will just\nbe my mother and my sister.",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 no, they \u2014 they\u2019re still there, they \u2014 but they have received the affidavit.\nAnd now the problem was w-we had to find the money for pa-passage. And they\ngot assistance for \u2014 some money that came from the cousin, and \u2014 and some money\nthey had saved up. Other than that, I don\u2019t know if they got anything from the\nKultusgemeinde or not. I just don\u2019t know. But I\u2014 I knew when I left that my father\nwas going to \u2014 I left in December, and \u2014 and my father was leaving in January. See,\nth-they had the visa and then \u2014 and the affidavit. It was a week after I had talked to\nDr. Lowenherz that I was notified to participate in the Kindertransport, which\nwas to leave on the \u2014 late at night, it was around 10 o\u2019clock at night from a station \u2014\nnot the Westbahnhof. Many people will tell you I left from the Westbahnhof, they\ndidn\u2019t leave from the Westbahnhof, the \u2014 they left from one station afterward,\ncalled Hutteldorf. And the requirements as to \u2014 we were given a notification as to\nwhat we would \u2014 allowed \u2014 were allowed to take out of the country. And it\u2019s\ninteresting, you were not allowed to take anything out of the country, including\nOctober 17, 2010\nclothing that was new. Anything that you took out of the country had to be in your\npossession one year ahead of time, \u201937. And \u2014",
        "A: Y-You know, at that time, I didn\u2019t think of it, but we obeyed it, yeah. It\u2019s a \u2014\nnobody, as far as I know \u2014 I mean, I have no way of knowing, but my \u2014 my parents\ndid not buy anything, a pair of socks, o-or a shirt, or underwear, no-none of that. It\nwas true that then \u2014 everything that I took with me, I had had be-before. And \u2014 and\nunder penalty of punishment, whatever the punishment would have been, my father\nhad to swear a signed affidavit, that whatever I was taking out had been in my\npossession as of 1937. An-And by the way, I have that document, with his\nsignature, you see.",
        "A: Well, he left with my father in \u2014 in January of \u201939.",
        "A: No, no, my uncle had nothing to do with this.",
        "A: It\u2019s just my fa \u2014 my uncle, before they left, my uncles \u2014 I \u2014 I took him to the\ntrain station, he was smuggling himself across the border into Yugoslavia to go to\nOctober 17, 2010\nPalestine because it \u2014 1-illegal immigration was more productive and successful\nthan trying to wait for admission by any authorit \u2014 any country. You\u2019re not\nsupposed to be in Yugoslavia, you\u2019re not supposed to be in Italy wi-without p-\npermit, and \u2014 which you couldn\u2019t get, so you \u2014 you just crossed the border.",
        "A: Yo-You get to the border, the Austrian border, and you get off the train. And\nthen at night, th \u2014 wi\u2014 there was a smuggling operation going on at that time.\nPeople got paid to take you, and \u2014 and th \u2014 and I-I guess there was bribery to look\nanother way in the \u2014 you know, th-that must have gone on for a long time.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, no December \u2014",
        "A: December \u00b038, yes. What day? I don\u2019t know, maybe a third week of December,\nor the second week of December. No, it had to be \u2014 it had to be probably the first\nweek of December, because I left on \u2014 on my birthday, the 11\", so it had to be\nbefore that, cause I took him to the train. A-Again, there was [indecipherable]\nnobody else. Even when any kind of form needed to be filled out, they called on\nme. My \u2014 my parents, to a large extent felt that I would know what to do, you see.\nOctober 17, 2010\nSo \u2014 so the \u2014 my brother would do something foolish, you see, so \u2014 so he \u2014 and he\u2019s\nsmaller \u2014 see, my brother was taller. So he\u2019s taller [indecipherable] more of a\nchild, you know, tha-that \u2014 he \u2014",
        "A: Ye-Yeah, he can get by, you see. Maybe they \u2014 their judgment was correct in \u2014\nin that respect.",
        "A: He wa \u2014 he got through Yugoslavia, and Romania, into Turkey and from\nTurkey to Israel. His wife was left behind, and his son was left behind. And they\nwere deported. You didn\u2019t ask me about my friend, who was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 who was involved with me in saving the girl. We had, you know, when \u2014 when\nyou think back, you know, as \u2014 as children, the type of conversation that we had\ncompared to the conversation that kids have in this country, yeah, you know, it was\na \u2014 it was unbelievable. You\u2019re talking about life and death, and they\u2019re talking\nabout football, or baseball, you know. So I \u2014 his name was Ernst, I used to call him\nErnsty(ph). I said, why don\u2019t you try to get out also? He couldn\u2019t get on the\nKindertransport. He was two years older, so the cut-off age was, at that time was\n16, and he \u2014 he was almost 17. He says \u2014 in any event, he says, I \u2014 I can\u2019t leave my\nOctober 17, 2010\nparents. The sister had left for Israel, she had made aliyah early o-of ?38. So he \u2014\nhe s \u2014 he said, in any event, he says, you know, my \u2014 my father 1s \u2014 1s a decorated\nfrom World War I, and he says, I can understand where they\u2019ll bother you because\nyou \u2014 you \u2014 your parents are \u2014",
        "A: So-\u2014so he \u2014 he felt that his father having been a veteran of the World War I, and\ndecorated and you know, au \u2014 Austrian citizen to begin with, whereas my parents\nwere naturalized. And nothing is gonna happen to us. So \u2014 so I\u2014 he wasn\u2019t too \u2014 he\nsays, in your case, your \u2014 your parents are Polish originally, and he says yeah, I can\nsee where \u2014 so he stayed and what would happen eventually is that like everybody\nelse, they were kicked out of the apartment. I was in England ba \u2014 by that time and\nlost contact. My problem also was, I had no money. Somebody was give me \u2014 have\nto give me a stamp. Then sometimes I got a postcard from someone. And that\u2019s the\nonly means I had to write. And I heard nothing any more fr-from Ernsty(ph). Later\non I heard that the parents were deported to Theresienstadt, and they died there.\nAnd he was living with some girl in the second district, and they were deported\n[indecipherable] down here. And when they arrived in \u2014 in Poland, the following\nday they were all shot, including him. And tha-that was what \u2014 I didn\u2019t hear that\nuntil the end of the war. I had no idea that \u2014 often wondered what happened to him,\nOctober 17, 2010\nbut we never knew. Of course, I didn\u2019t know what happened to my uncle, I didn\u2019t\nknow what happened to my cousins or my aunt, or \u2014 or my grandparents or, you\nknow, in \u2014 in Poland my father\u2019s parents\u2019 family, most of them are still in Radom,\nand there were 10 brothers and sisters. And they \u2014 and they had married and they\nhad children. Nobody survived. So that \u2014 that was one aspect. I don\u2019t know where I\nam 1-1-in \u2014 in this story, yo-yo-you better take me back to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014a particular event, or \u2014\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, a-and help me. Well, I-I\u2019m 14 years old, I have no money. Absolutely not\n\u2014 not one penny, nothing. And I don\u2019t speak the language. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s\ngoing on. I\u2019m at this place in Dovercourt in Lowestoft(ph), freezing cold. I mean,\nthis cabin, no running water. Every bit of clothing that I had, ?\u2019m\u2014I?\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m\nputting it on at night, trying to stay warm, and \u2014 because we\u2019re right on the ocean,\nand this wintertime. I couldn\u2019t stay warm. So aft \u2014 they gave us sort of a canister,\nwas supposed to be filled with hot water, and \u2014 and when I woke up in the morning\nthe second night, it was \u2014 it was frozen ice. And I said, you know, to \u2014 to my friend\nwho is staying with me, I says, you know, I can\u2019t take this any more, I says, I\u2019m not\ngonna stay here. So \u2014 so I just took the blanket, and I went into the dining hall, and\nthere they had a fireplace, and I put the blanket on the floor. And for the rest of the\ntime that I was at this camp, I slept on the floor in front of the dining place, ju-just\nha-had to stay warm. But this is a different story now. As far as my uncle is\nconcerned, he writes to me from time to time that he \u2014 he also has no money, and\nhe\u2019s hungry. And then in one letter he\u2019s saying that \u2014 now that you\u2019re safe and out\nof the country, it\u2019s your responsibility to help me, to help me get out of the country.\nWell \u2014 well, I get this letter, a-and then o-on a \u2014 on a personal note from my\nmother, she\u2019s getting, as time goes on, more worried and more concerned. My\nfather is in United States, a good looking man, and maybe it went on in her head\nOctober 17, 2010\nthat maybe he\u2019s met somebody, which later on I hear, was not that unusual. So sh \u2014\nthe pressure went on, with me caught in the middle. She\u2019s writing to me that he\u2019s\nnot doing anything to help her get out of the country. In the meantime, he\u2019s in this\ncountry, he doesn\u2019t speak English. He doesn\u2019t know who is what, or where to go or\nwhat do you do. He doesn\u2019t have any money either. He\u2019s dependent upon the\nassistance from \u2014 from the distant cousins who have no relation whatso-whatsoever.\nI don\u2019t know what their finances were at the time. So, you know, one letter I get,\nthat I should write to my father, that if he doesn\u2019t do something to help my mother\nto get out of the country, that I should write to him \u2014 oh, she said, send a cable \u2014 h-\nhow am I gonna send a cable \u2014 tha-that I would have nothing to do with him, if he\nwasn\u2019t more active in helping. I realized the situation she\u2019s in, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s going on. So I wrote him what she told me. And then I get a letter from my\nfather, that this is no way to talk to me. A-And you know, I \u2014 I\u2019m in the middle of\nthis thing, in the \u2014 in the back and forth, and you know, th \u2014 1-it was for me a very,\nvery uncomfortable and stressful and it\u2019s \u2014 1f you can put yourself in the situation\nwhere \u2014 where you are put in the situation of choosing between your father or your\nmother, I mean how \u2014 how do you do this? A-A-And \u2014 and \u2014 and who 1s right and\nwho is wrong, an-and what\u2019s going on? I don\u2019t know. Bu-But you ask me to do this,\nall right, \u20191l \u2014 Pll do it. You see, so \u2014 but I mean, th-that has always bothered me\nOctober 17, 2010\nthat \u2014 that I wrote that letter. And I \u2014 he s \u2014 my father berated me, that this no way\nto talk to me, and it was disrespectful. But 1-it was \u2014 you know, the war broke out\nand my mother is still over there, and finally she did get an affidavit, cause\nAmerica and Germany, there was still correspondence going on because America\nwas not at war in \u201939. So she \u2014 she got the affidavit and she\u2019s able to leave through\nItaly.",
        "A: With my sister, yeah.",
        "A: My \u2014 my grandmother, I\u2019ve almost forgot about her. She \u2014 she left before any of\nus did. I-I really \u2014 I really loved her. She [indecipherable] she was put in touch, I\ndon\u2019t know how, she took a train t-toward the Belgium border, and there she was\nma \u2014 we had two aunts \u2014 two \u2014 my mother had two sisters who lived in Paris, so \u2014\nso they have arranged where one of the husbands of \u2014 of one of the sisters were to\ngo to Belgium and arrange with a smuggler, and they smuggled her across the\nborder.",
        "A: This probably was e-either very \u2014 at the end of November, or maybe early \u2014\nearly \u2014 first week of December.\nOctober 17, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, \u201938, yeah. So she crosses the border, and she gets arrested. And the French\nput her in prison, illegal entry. An elderly woman, and she only speaks Yiddish, and\nshe\u2019s very frum. So in prison she doesn\u2019t want to eat, because it\u2019s treyfa. So she\ndies. In-Interesting that, since talking about what \u2014 Paris, that she was arrested by\nthe French police, the two sisters were deported to Auschwitz, picked up by the\nFrench. Collaborators. I-I-I\u2019m skipping a lot.",
        "A: My mother e-eventually, she gets the affidavit, she meets up with the brother\nwho had written to me, you know, for help, and whatever money she has, not much,\nit\u2019s some spending money, she \u2014 she gives it to him.",
        "A: In Italy, yeah.\nOctober 17, 2010\nhours to get out of the country, or else we\u2019ll return you to Germany. So he crosses\nthe border illegally, into France.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, no, he didn\u2019t have anything. Cause the minute he crossed the\nborder, he got picked up and sent to Gurs. And then he, from Gurs he went to\nDrancy, and from Drancy he went to Auschwitz. He had a son, Julius. The son,\nhad smu \u2014 had smuggled himself across the border. It\u2019s a little chilly here. Are you\nuncomfortable?",
        "A: No, I\u2014I didn\u2019t know anything about Eichmann. I needed to have an entry made\n0-on \u2014 on an immediate basis, because I\u2019m going to go to England an-and I needed\na passport, and England was not listed on the passport, so \u2014 so how do I do this? So\n\u2014 so I decided that the best way \u2014 a-and by the way, it has to be certified on the\npassport, each country that you want to go \u2014 emigrate to. So I decided to go to Nazi\nheadquarters. They were located at Rothschild palace. And I just went in and \u2014 and\nright away I meet the person in charge, the \u2014 you know, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re referring\nOctober 17, 2010\nme from one place to the other. And he wants to know what it is that \u2014 that I\u2019m\nthere for, and so I told him. And he \u2014 he [indecipherable] agreed and he gave it to\nme, wrote in there and put the stamp on it and \u2014 an-and that was it. And it was only\nyears later that I learned that the person who was in charge was Eichmann. So if he\nwas in charge, so \u2014 so \u2014 so it must have been him. You know, he didn\u2019t introduce\nhimself to me. But, you know, my assumption. I don\u2019t know who else had the\nauthority, except f-for hi \u2014 for Eichmann, once you are in \u2014 1n the headquarters of\nthe Nazi government.",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: No, no. I said griiss gott, th-they gave me a \u2014 they stared at me. I \u2014 I \u2014 I think\nthey were surprised, they didn\u2019t know what to do. I mean, a little boy comes in, and\nthere\u2019s \u2014 with gruss gott, a-a-and you know, who \u2014 who \u2014 who do you want to see?\nAn-And I probably said th-the person in charge. A-And so the \u2014 from one office to\nthe other, to wind up with Eichmann, I \u2014 1\u20141\u2014I1-\u2014I did hear, when he was tried in\nIsrael that he made some claim that on occasion he tried to save Jews. I mean, that\nwas par \u2014 so-some small part of his defense. But he did o \u2014 also admit that one\nOctober 17, 2010\nmistake that he made was that he slapped Lowenherz. And tha-that he \u2014 he\napologized for having slapped his face, because he had much respect for\nLowenherz, and \u2014 and Lowenherz survived. And by the way, ma-many people felt\nthat Lowenherz was a collaborator. I spoke to his son, his son survived, and I was\nable to get ahold of him, lived in New York, name \u2014 changed his name to\nLavary(ph). I have a letter that he sent me, talking about his father and how glad he\nwas to hear from me, because I had written to him and told him about the father,\nand \u2014 the father being responsible for my sur-surviving. And he says, the father\nwould have been happy to hear from me. And he put me in touch with his daughter,\nwho lives in California, and she\u2019s a professor at one of the universities there, and\nhe \u2014 he felt that the daughter should hear my story. So we got the daughter to call\nme, and we were in a conference phone call, and I told her story, and then she \u2014\nbecause the father was criticized for having supplied the lists to the Nazi authorities,\nwho were then picked up and deported. How else do you find out who lives where?\nBut they had the information. My knowledge of Lowenherz, he had no choice. So \u2014\nso they\u2019re gonna get that list no matter what. He\u2019s not the only one who knows\nwhere the lists are. So if they kill him [indecipherable] so \u2014 so he is in a difficult\nsituation. Might \u2014 you might also find of interest that the rabbi at my Bar Mitzvah\nwas Rabbi Benjamin Murmelstein. There you have a different story. He was part\nOctober 17, 2010\nof the Judenrat in Vienna, and then he became part of the Judenrat at\nTheresienstadt. It is reported that he acted shamefully, that he molested women,\nand if they didn\u2019t cooperate, he\u2019d put them on the list to be deported. There are\nbooks written about his deed. He too survived, and wound up in Italy. They wanted\n\u2014 many of the people who knew him from \u2014 who also had survived Theresienstadt\nwanted to hang him up. He a \u2014 with the church\u2019s help, he wound up in Rome, and\nthe Vatican supposedly helped him, and he started working for the Vatican, and he\ndied in Italy. And the wife wanted to have him buried in the Jewish cemetery, and\nthey refused. And with the Vatican intercession, to cooperate or to yield or\nwhatever, so \u2014 so they agreed, but only at the edge of the cemetery. I understand\nthat there is some sort of a custom that if you are an apostate, or you\u2019ve done\nsomething disrespectful to the Jewish people, they let you be buried in the Jewish\ncemetery, but away from everybody, only at the edge. So that is where he\u2019s buried,\nin Italy. That\u2019s the story of the rabbi, Benjamin mermu \u2014 Benjamin\nMurmelstein. And I have \u2014 I can\u2019t remember the name of the book, but there\u2019s a \u2014\na book written about the \u2014 the Judenrat, he was the head of the camp at\nTheresienstadt, and he s \u2014 replaced Edelman, who was the former head. And\nEdelman, before being deported, advised the committee there, don\u2019t trust\nOctober 17, 2010\nMurmelstein. And if you like, Pll give you name of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the book, and\n\u2014 and you can Google M-Murmelstein.",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t make reference to what he did, only the position that he held. So \u2014 so\nhe \u2014 he became quite prominent as Benjamin Murmelstein. I don\u2019t know if \u2014 you\ndidn\u2019t write down the name. Benjamin Murmelstein. | still have the Bar Mitzvah\nbook that I received. That\u2019s another story. It was about two or three days before we\nleft. We had to take our suitcases and to have it inspected by the Gestapo. And you\nwere not allowed to take any money, you\u2019re not allowed to take any cameras, no\njewelry, nothing of any value. You \u2014 a-anything in your possession had to be in\nyour possession as of \u201937, as I mentioned earlier. No \u2014 no typewriters, nothing \u2014 no\nmusical instruments, an-and the only thing that was not listed was books. And since\nit wasn\u2019t listed, I felt, you know, I always liked books, and the nicest present you\ncould give me for my Bar Mitzvah would be a book. So, I\u2014 I had received quite a\nfew books, so I put them in a suitcase. And when we went to the Kultusgemeinde,\nwhere we had taken our suitcase to, the Gestapo agent said, what\u2019s with these\nbooks? And my mother said, well, he likes to read. He doesn\u2019t need them. So he\nstarted \u2014 took some of the books and tossed them all out. You know, just threw\nthem away, but he left some books there. And one of the books he\u2019d left was the\nOctober 17, 2010\nBar Mitzvah boy \u2014 prayer book, which I still have, with the date and everything.\nAnother document. German Bar Mitzvah prayer book. So where are we in the\nstory?",
        "A: O-Only my mother. My father was \u2014 oh, she felt my father may be arrested, you\nknow, so he \u2014 because fo-for a while he just didn\u2019t leave the house. So it was \u2014 I-I\nhad no idea what to expect, but when w \u2014 when we got there, each child had to be\ndropped off at the foot of the steps. That was in the requirement that we had\nreceived, as to what procedure to follow for the transport, and \u2014 and we were to\narrive at a certain hour, and in my case late in the evening. The child had to be drop\noff at the steps of the foot o-of the entrance. The parent was not allowed on the\nplatform. Only one parent could come, and we would be given a number, and that\nwas it. A-And now we arriving at the station. And there are hundreds of parents\nwith a child, and well, I\u2019m almost 14, only one day away. This is a \u2014 late in \u2014 at\nnight, on the 10\" of December, and I\u2019m listening to some of the conversation that\nwas going on, you know, with the \u2014 the conversation between my mother a-and me,\nwe \u2014 we \u2014 we knew what to accept. I wanted to be part of 1t, my mother wanted me\nout of the country, so it was, write to me, we\u2019ll get together, we\u2019ll be okay an-and\nOctober 17, 2010\nso forth, and you know, my \u2014 each \u2014 each one encouraging the other, y-you see, so\n\u2014 so I\u2019m not \u2014 I \u2014 I recognize what 1s taking place, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not emotionally\ncarried away, because I know we\u2019re gonna meet up again, you know. My father, a\nmonth later is leaving, so I know we\u2019re gonna get together some \u2014 at some time.\nWhen or what, of course, we had no idea. But I\u2019m listening to what goes on around\nme, which I found very heartrending. I had no idea that on this transport would be\nchildren between two and 16. And the conversation of some of these children, four,\nfive, six years old, they had no idea what was taking place, and what \u2014 why they\nwere there and where they were going and why they were going an-and \u2014 and are\nyou not coming with me, or \u2014 or I don\u2019t want to go, I want to stay. You don\u2019t love\nme, or \u2014 I get emotional even today when I talk about it because at the time I \u2014 I\nwas not as em-emotionally affected as I am now, because now I have children and\ngrandchildren and I don\u2019t know if I would have the courage of the parents, the\nsacrifice that they made, to take a kid at that age and send him away. I-It took a lot\nof guts, I mean, cause I don\u2019t want you to worry, or write to me, or we\u2019ll soon get\ntogether, and it\u2019s all fabricated. They don\u2019t know. And as finally happened, close to\n90 percent of the children never saw their parents again. So 1-1t \u2014 it was a very, very\nstressful period. A-And you know, give them a number, I \u2014 you know, my number\nwas thr \u2014 325, so I knew I was going to England \u2014 because until then I didn\u2019t even\nOctober 17, 2010\nknow where I was going for sure. So \u2014 so I knew I was going to England. And they\ntook the younger children, they put them in one wagon, the older children in another\nwagon. And the girls in one wagon, the boys in another wagon, so \u2014 and I\nremember on the \u2014 f-for the \u2014 for the most part we had a certain amount of fear as to\nwhat was going to happen, even on the train, whenever it stopped and the Nazi\npersonnel came on an-and then they walked through and \u2014 because they could kick\nyou off the train, you know. Somebody \u2014 there was a rumor that somebody was\ntaken off the train. If there was or wasn\u2019t, I have no idea, you know, rumor\ncirculates. So we had some social workers from the Kultusgemeinde who came\nwith us and they had \u2014 they were going to be allowed to leave the country, but their\nfamily was held hostage, they had to return. And we a-arrived to the\n[indecipherable] 1-in \u2014 late \u2014 late at night, after a day and a half of traveling on the\ntrain, we arrived in Holland and the train stopped on the German side first, and they\ninspected, and whatever and then they let the train proceed across the border. And\nonce we crossed the border all hell broke loose, and everybody started yelling and\nscreaming and cheering and you know, because now we knew we were free; no\nlonger to be afraid of the Nazis or what they could do. And I remember people\ncoming up to the train and th-they offered us drinks and \u2014 and sandwiches and so\nforth, a very friendly reception 1-in Holland. And after a little while, I-I was so tired\nOctober 17, 2010\nfrom the day and a half on th \u2014 on the train that I \u2014 I-I could \u2014 I could barely stay\nawake. So \u2014 so all I remember is I got on this boat and the crossing of the channel is\nvery stormy, I \u2014 and I got motion sick. I\u2019d never been on any ocean, I \u2014 first time I \u2014\nI\u2019m seeing an ocean. And in the morning the \u2014 the next morning we \u2014 we arrived in\nHarwich, England, and I faintly remember \u2014 I don\u2019t know how \u2014 being taken to\nLowestoft(ph) in Dovercourt. And there I stayed maybe three weeks, something\nlike that, and my \u2014 my problem started, I was there three weeks then \u2014 then they \u2014\nthey sent me to Ipswich, and I was there 10 days, and being \u2014 and then I went to\nanother place, 1t was a convalescent home for sick people, and \u2014 and in each time 1-\ni-in the \u2014 in Dovercourt every weekend, they \u2014 they would line us up and \u2014 and\npeople would come down a-and pick out certain children. And you know, I asked\nthem what\u2019s going on? These are people that \u2014 private people want to take a child in\ntheir home. But I noticed that whenever they picked anybody out, they wanted a\nsmall, small, young children. Nobody wanted to get a teenager, you see, so nobody\npicked me. So \u2014 so I was going to this convalescent home, and then I went another\nplace. Each time I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m staying a week or two, or three weeks, and then I go\nanother place, and then finally I was sen \u2014 we went to a place called \u2014 they always\ncut down the number of boys, always \u2014 you know, th \u2014 by then, I think we\u2019re down\nto a dozen boys a-and \u2014 and we\u2019re going to a\u2014 San Remo hotel in Margate, near \u2014\nOctober 17, 2010\nnear Dover. And th-that was sort of a family run hotel, small hotel, and I really\nliked it. I said oh, this 1s beautiful. I sa \u2014 th-the ocean, a-and \u2014 and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s gotten\nwarmer and the food is great, and we were there maybe two and a half weeks, and\nthe proprietor tells us that you'll have to leave, you know, some other place. I says,\nwhy, I says, you know, we like it here. We said, we want \u2014 I want to stay here, I\nsaid, this is \u2014 this is very nice. He said, I\u2019m very sorry, but I can\u2019t support a group\nof boys and nobody pays us. So that was the first time that I realized that \u2014 what\nwas going on. That we\u2019re being shifted from one place to the other. Maybe they\nsaid, all right, I\u2019ll take them for a few days, and so forth, you see, but nobody was\npaying anybody, you see, so these people were \u2014 were offering to house some \u2014\nsome boys until they realized that th \u2014 they\u20191l have to make room for us, and there\u2019s\ncertain expense involved, and \u2014 and you \u2014 there\u2019s no funds available.",

A-\nOctober 17, 2010\nAnd f-from San Remo Hotel, we were sent to Croydon, an estate. Then we \u2014 we\nhearing the possibility of war, and the \u2014 that be \u2014 you know, now the \u2014 England is\nrearm \u2014 finally re-rearming itself, you know, a-and there\u2019s more and more talk\nabout the possibility of war because Hitler wants Danzig and \u2014 a-and England has\na pact with Poland and France and so forth, they\u2019re gonna come to the assistance\nof the Polish government. A-And in Croydon, it was around September first, war\nstarts. A-And there we stayed at a school that had been evacuated of British\nchildren, it was a private school, a girls\u2019 school. Kendra Hall was the name. And\nso we stayed there on \u2014 on the first night when war star \u2014 started. And \u2014 and we\nexperienced the first air raid alarm, supposedly German planes were si-si \u2014 flying\noverhead. A-And we went into the air raid shelter. And we were there \u2014 nice place,\nby the way \u2014 we were there maybe two weeks when we were told that we had to\nleave the place because near us was a \u2014 the RAF, Royal Air Force had a base, and\nthey needed to house their personnel, so they were going to take over the school,\nand we would have to leave. So, the next thing we were being sent to London, to\nanother school. I don\u2019t know if you know anything about London, Eaton(ph)\nAvenue, [indecipherable] school. And the same thing, it\u2019s a private school, it was\nempty, children had been evacuated. And the building 1s empty, if you want to stay\nthere, fine.

But you know, I was there maybe a week, and I\u2019m told by the\nheadmaster that they had a phone call from the refugee committee.

Now, on one pound a\nweek, I paid 15 shillings fo-for room and board. Three shillings I had to pay for\ntransportation, cause I lived at this Swiss cottage.

Had I been 18 years old, I would have been\narrested as an enemy alien. And since I don\u2019t reme \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t remember\nwhether you had to be 18 or 16 when they considered you an enemy alien and they\nwould put you in some sort of a camp. At 18 you could volunteer for a pioneer \u2014\nwhat they called Pioneer Corps, and in England, you know, I wasn\u2019t old enough to\n\u2014 to be in anything at the time. I was waiting f \u2014 you know, I-I can imagine how my\n\u2014 my parents were in this country at the time, and in the newsreel when they went to\nthe \u2014 the movies on occasion, they would see th \u2014 oh, what \u2014 they have a movie \u2014\nwhat they would ca \u2014 what they called Movietone News.

An-And \u2014 and I lived through that and I \u2014 I \u2014 we had sandbags all around\nthe building, the school; it was not a very big building, it was small. But\nsandbagged all around, and we would sleep in \u2014 1n the cellar, the basement, or \u2014 and\nwa \u2014 one particular night, if you ever \u2014 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen it on television maybe,\nwhen a bomb falls down, there is that searing noise, and as it comes closer to you\nOctober 17, 2010\nit\u2019s louder and louder. And this particular time I felt, that\u2019s got my number \u2014 that\u2019s\ngot our number on it, a-and it\u2019s gonna hit our building. And a-as it came closer a-\nand I \u2014 and suddenly I heard a huge explosion, and the building shook and the glass\nbroke and I had been sleeping, you know, I \u2014 I sat up quite alarmed. And the\nheadmaster of the school saw me, and he said to me, Mr. Friedman, would you like\nto have a cup of tea? Br-British stoic behavior. Years later, I had described Joyce\nmany times, that particular event, and \u2014 and I showed her and told her how close\nthat bomb fell. And I said, you know, it wiped out that entire building. So \u2014 so years\nlater, in the 60s, we went back, and I \u2014 and I wanted to show her the building, it\u2019s a\n\u2014 and st \u2014 the place was still vacant, nothing was there. So I says, look, this 1s where\nthe bomb fell. And th-the school had been converted into apartments, and knocked\non the door in one of the apartments and talked to the people if they\u2019Il let me come\nin. And we came in, and I was telling them the different things. And I said, you\nknow, around here, there used to be a \u2014 a dumbwaiter. You know what a\ndumbwaiter is?",

So, li-living\nthrough the London blitz, my parents, knowing that I was there, I-I can imagine\nOctober 17, 2010\nthat they were very worried. And they were anxious to \u2014 to get me out. My father\nsent me an affidavit, the affidavit was rejected by the American embassy. Kennedy,\nJoseph Kennedy was the ambassador at that time.

And I was in a position where \u2014 where either way I\ncouldn\u2019t find \u2014 I didn\u2019t know how to go about finding a job, and at the same time I\ndidn\u2019t want to go to school.

        "A: Although another boy \u2014 I did \u2014 I left out the story, it\u2019s of interest to us. The first\nride I ever took was in a taxicab in London. I didn\u2019t have enough money to go to\nthe train station, so I took a subway to go Oxford \u2014 Oxford Street on the Oxford\nCircle. And because of heavy bombing, you couldn\u2019t just find a cab, but a cab came\nalong, and I stopped it. And the cab driver said, where you going? I said, I\u2019m going\nto Liverpool station, if you\u2019ll take me. He says, hop in. So I got in the cab, and\ninside the cab 1s another boy. And after a while we start talking to each other. He is\nmy age. He is going to Liverpool train station. Here you\u2019re gonna take th \u2014 a ship \u2014\nyou know, the train, it goes to Liverpool, there he\u2019s gonna take a ship, the same\nship. Going to the States? Yes. What city? Baltimore.

I said, 10 pounds, you\u2019re\nkidding. 10 pounds? Unbelievable. I didn\u2019t have \u2014 even have one.

So when I \u2014\nyoull read the story there about how I got shipped to the Pacific, because I had no\nidea how to wind up 1n the \u2014 in the \u2014 going to the Pacific.

And I didn\u2019t know what\nthat was. I \u2014 I said, what\u2019s a scholarship? So \u2014 so he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s explaining to me. He\nsaid, Loyo-Loyola College is offering you a scholarship. And he\u2019s telling me that\nthis is a Catholic school and \u2014 and \u2014 and what it\u2019s like and so forth. I says, a\nCatholic school is offering me a scholarship? I says \u2014 I couldn\u2019t believe this. I says,\ndo you \u2014 you mean it\u2019s a Catholic an-and \u2014 I\u2019m Jewish. He says, oh la \u2014 no, do-\ndon\u2019t worry about that, they offered. He says, the only thing is, 1s that you have to\nhave an interview with the dean of admissions, but I don\u2019t anticipate any problem.\nSo \u2014 so I went to see the dean of admission and everything 1s fine with him, except\nhe wants me to promise that I will attend the school, if given a schol \u2014 made enough\nOctober 17, 2010\nof a scholarship that I will actually accept it. And the problem was that I already\nhad received orders to go into the army. I says, I can\u2019t promise. I don\u2019t know when I\nwill be called. So \u2014 so I never accepted the scholarship. But th-the surprise was the\norders that I received after basic training, was to go to the Pacific, which I didn\u2019t\nwant, but I had no choice.",
        "A: Europe, yeah, of course. I speak German. Why do you send me out to the\nPacific? And in college they have a special training where they \u2014 1-in the army they\nhave a special training where they \u2014 the army will pay to send you to college. So I\nsaid oh that \u2014 how wonderful. So I applied. So in order to be accepted, you \u2014 again,\nyou have to be interviewed. The only program available was German. So the first\nquestion he is asking me, he says, I see in your resume here that you speak German,\nis that right? I said yes. He says, then why should we send you to college to study\nGerman? By the way, it was called ASTP, Army Special Training Program. I said, I\nwant to go to college and this is the only thing you offer. So, he rejects, whi-which\nmade sense. But then to turn around and send me to the Pacific made no sense. But\nthis is the army.\nOctober 17, 2010",

So I looked forward to that, working in the\nhospital, fine. And we were on the water over a month, maybe five weeks on the\nwater. Can you imagine? And if you read the description there, it was a freighter\nthat had been converted into a troop ship. And we were, as I say there, packed in\nlike sardines, thousands of troops, and one on top of the other, we stacked on \u2014 on\nsort of a canvas bunk a-an \u2014 and \u2014 and there\u2019s non \u2014 you can\u2019t turn around, because\nit\u2019s so close, and you got to climb up a for \u2014 four or five high, as to whe \u2014 where\nyou\u2019re gonna stay, a-an \u2014 a-and if you \u2014 you take a shower, but it\u2019s salt water, and\nthere\u2019s no way that you can lather yourself in soap water, it just doesn\u2019t work.

And th \u2014 an-and \u2014\nan-an-and it\u2019s the same clothes, yo \u2014 you know, and there\u2019s no change of clothes.\nA-And you feel real miserable. You get \u2014 1-in the \u2014 in this article I saw it was a\u2014a\npreparation for jungle warfare. But we were about five weeks on the water. Today\nyou can fly over there in one day. But when I \u2014 we landed in [indecipherable] and I\nwas there maybe a little over a week and then was back on the ship again, and\nwhere we going? Everything was always secret, nobody knew.

        "A: No, they weren\u2019t telling us not to say anything, because there was nothing to say.\nIn other words, we \u2014 we were told nothing. Where am I going? Nobody knows. So I\nmade reference to that in \u2014 in the article that I hope you\u2019ll find of interest, and\nwound up in [indecipherable] and then I\u2019m put onto another troopship, and again, I\nha \u2014 I don\u2019t have the faintest idea. But they have a roster and one day I\u2019m being told\nthat there was watch duty. Watch duty you are on the deck with a rifle, and for\nabout two hours \u2014 two hours off and \u2014 and four hours off. I mean, two hours on and\nfour hours off. A-And I see my list as being chosen for on \u2014 for \u2014 for on duty. I\nsays, wait a minute, I says, I\u2019m a medic. We don\u2019t carry weapons.

Well \u2014\nwell, that\u2019s your assignment. That\u2019s the first time that I heard anything about the\ninfantry.",
        "A: No, we-well, yes, 1-1-1n basic training you receive \u2014 but \u2014 but not with weapons,\nif you\u2019re a medic. One time the \u2014 they took us out and we fired a machine gun and I\nOctober 17, 2010\nfired the \u2014 a carbine and an M-1 rifle, yeah, I fired one time. But th \u2014 but how to\nclean it, how to handle it [indecipherable] no \u2014 no extensive training. Yeah, that\none time it was a wa \u2014 how to disarm somebody who comes to \u2014 at you with a \u2014\nwith a bayonet on the rifle. How to disarm that person. That\u2019s a-another story. But I\nwas assigned as a medic to the infantry, and from day one I hated it. It 1s \u2014 first of\nall, the living conditions were so terrible. The food was horrible. Ev-Everything was\npowdered, we \u2014 we got nothing fresh. You living in the jungle, a-and you know, 1-\ninsects crawling all over you. And you know, I\u2019m a city boy, I\u2019m \u2014 you can\u2019t take a\nbath, y-yo-yo-you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 it takes weeks to get a letter. A-And we were not\ndirectly \u2014 at least I was not directly involved in \u2014 in combat, but we \u2014 we got the\nwounded, and \u2014 an-and my job was principally thr-three directions; overcome\nshock, hemorrhage and fractures. A-And you learn, it\u2019s amazing. Really, you know,\nI was astonished how much you can learn just by watching what somebody else\ndoes, and then sometimes having somebody who knows, come over and \u2014 and work\nwith you, and so you learn those things. How to apply traction, and how to apply\nsupport, and sa \u2014 and put on a cast and all that. You know, you learn that, because\nlater on, toward the end of the war, I was assigned to, you know, shipped to\nHawaii, a-and \u2014 and there I became an instructor and the draft was still going on,\nand new recruits were coming in and I was lecturing in \u2014 1n two subjects \u2014 three\nOctober 17, 2010\nsubjects; sanitation, first aid and venereal diseases. And I always started off my\nlecture in venereal diseases, telling them that many times \u2014 at that time, when you\ngot a venereal disease, you could be court-martialed and put into prison. You may\nnot know this, and it\u2019s totally different today, but then, you know \u2014 so \u2014 so \u2014 so\ngonorrhea was a major problem to \u2014 to many, and disabling, and because it\u2019s so\ninfectious. So \u2014 so I wou \u2014 I would start off my \u2014 my lecture with contrary to what\nyou may have been told, that you cannot catch gonorrhea off a toilet seat, I want to\nassure you that that is incorrect. It is possible to get gonorrhea off a toilet seat, but\nit\u2019s a hell of a place to take your girlfriend. You see, because many times, when you\nasked a soldier, how did you get this? You see, oh, I don\u2019t know, maybe off a toilet\nseat, you know. It\u2019s really nonsense, you see it was \u2014 so but this was \u2014 got a big\nlaugh, and \u2014 and \u2014 and I would have the attention of the audience. A-And when the\nwar had ended, but I was still in Hawaii, and troops were being repatriated back to\nthe country, I asked the commanding officer if he will authorize me to go to the\nuniversity there, so he said okay. So I went to the \u2014 for a little while to the\nUniversity of Hawaii. An-And then when I came back, I-I \u2014 you know, I thought\nI\u2019d become a doctor, until one day I met a guy who had graduated from high school\nwith me, and you know, hi Herb, you know, Phil, how are you doing? We start\ntalking to each other, where \u2014 what are you doing now? I says, well, I\u2019m going to\nOctober 17, 2010\ncollege park, I\u2019ve been accepted to be pre-med. So he says, why do you want to go\nto pre-med? He says, you know, when you finish it, what do you got? Nothing.\nThen you still gotta go to med school, right? I says yeah, of course. He says, well,\nwhy don\u2019t you go to pharmacy school? I says, why should I go to pharmacy? I want\nto become \u2014 he says, no, he says, you use that as your pre-med. And this way you at\nleast have a degree as a pharmacist and you \u2014 and you can work during the summer\nand then pay for medical school \u2014 because I had no money. So I thought it was a\ngood idea. The \u2014 the problem was that 1t was mid-August and school starts in\nSeptember. So \u2014 so, how do I get in? Because at that time so many thousands of\nsoldiers came out, an-and they all wanted to go into \u2014 applied to Hopkins. Hopkins\nturned me down and said, reapply next year. Well, you\u2019re not going to sit around for\na whole year. Now I\u2019m in my 20s, 21 or 22 years old. So I \u2014 you know, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\nthought about it, I says, you know, it\u2019s not a bad idea, but would I get in? So \u2014 so I-I\nwent there, and I asked to meet th-the dean of admission, was a elderly woman. And\nshe gave me the same answer, she says, we \u2014 we can admit you next year, but our\nclasses are closed. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna be possible. She says, well, 1f somebody\nlast minute doesn\u2019t want to come in, you know, maybe. I\u2019ll give you an application,\nshe says, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. I-I-I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s gonna be possible. So I\nsaid to her \u2014 her name was Kohl(ph). I-I-I said, Dean Kohl(ph), if you admit me,\nOctober 17, 2010\nPll come back and kiss you. The whole of \u2014 the whole office there overheard this\nconversation, they all burst out laughing. But I got in.",

And\nthe most difficult thing for my mother was to learn that the husbands of her sisters\nand the children had survived, but the sisters had not. A-And mentally, she was\nfinished after this. I-It was \u2014 life at home was o \u2014 was, from then on was very, very\ndifficult.

But \u2014 and we lived in\nVirginia for 40 years, but every time I went home, all I had to do was open the door\nan-and \u2014 and it was \u2014 she\u2019d talk about the brother and the sister, and the brother and\nthe sister and why and this and that. An-And a certain regret. It\u2019s just difficult. She\nshould have left me in England and should have worked on getting out the brother.\nI was safe.
