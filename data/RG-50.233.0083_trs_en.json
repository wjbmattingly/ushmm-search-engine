        "Memories of Judith Kalman Mandel.",
        "I promised long time ago, 1944, that if I ever come alive out of the concentration camp I will\nsay the tale, that it should never be forgotten, what happened to us and could happen to anybody\nelse who is surrounded by fear, anger, discrimination and so on. People did not want to listen\nfor a long, long time because it wasn\u2019t nice. My story wasn\u2019t pleasant. People had some guilt.\nSome people were totally disinterested so I talked as much as I could, to my family to whoever\nlistened to me. I want to leave it as a memento not for me, and not for pity for me; but just to\nlet it stay alive. That it should never happen again and it should never be forgotten again.\nI was a young girl when it happened. I was sixteen and a half. I was 100 years old when I\ncame out. Like every survivor I have my own story and like every survivor I have my own\nversion of it, my own interpretation, my own questions. I give it to you to remember, to be\nbetter by it; to think before you say something or make fun of anybody; or belittle anybody, to\nknow that it gives a deep wound. I want to give you the courage, the happiness of being alive\nand be able to see, smell, touch, whatever you want, and just enjoy life in general. Well, let\u2019s\nstart with the story.\nI come from an unreligious town, from an unreligious family although both grandparents were\nreligious. My parents did not kept any more than Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur and we were\nfirst Hungarians and then Jewish. We were Hungarians who happened to be Jewish --- very\nproud to be assimilated and very well liked, in the beginning. I come from a little town, most\npeople knew each other. My uncle was a fairly rich man. My father was middle class, well\nliked. My mother was a beautiful, intelligent woman, looked up to. I used to recite poetry since\nI was three years old and relatively pretty child. I was basking in love of my parents and my\nuncle and people around us, so I thought. Then slowly, very slowly, everything started to\nchange. The different edicts from the authority came and our neighbor did not question why a\nJew are not allowed to do. We went along, my father and everybody believed the Jewish\nhierarchy who said nothing will happen if you keep the law. We are Hungarians and nothing\nwill happen to you. Nothing happened, we stayed home. You couldn\u2019t be a white-collar worker\nany more in an office so you became, like my father, a bricklayer. When the army did not take\nJewish men in, they became working force without uniform, their own clothes. They went into\nand they learned songs and they made up new songs that it does not matter that we have a ...\nhow you say it --- you work in the fields for Hungary. They\u2019re still good Hungarians. I went to\nschool, fell in love. I laughed, joked, I bicycled, I recited poetry. I went to the Jewish\norganizations and slowly I learned that I was a Jew, very slowly. By the Hungarian Nazi Party\nemblem on my desk in school or kids spit on us and called us name and of course we gave it\nback. We fought and yelled and went home. They said they are idiots, ha, ha, ha and don\u2019t be\nhurt. Just go for --- like nothing happened. We did. The edict came, more and more. I\nremember when Hitler came on the radio or in the movie theater. We saw the news, and the\npomp and the marching and the --- all the beauty of a Wagnerian night and I felt like a little\nmouse. All the goose steps were coming for me. But you joked, shook off. The next day was\nanother day. School time came 1942, or \u201941 when I finished junior high and I couldn\u2019t go to\nhigh school because I was a Jew. I couldn\u2019t stay home either, just sit home, do nothing; so I\nstarted to work as a beautician where a richer Jewish kid could get into a different school, pay\nhere and there. Slowly they went to school and who couldn\u2019t, learned a trade like your father,\nlike me. I was supposed to go into a Jewish .... Hungary had one Jewish schoolteacher\u2019s",
        "school which didn\u2019t take new pupils. They were not allowed and nobody else took me. So I\nlearned and again life gone on. I had tutor who taught me when \u2018everything will be peaceful\nagain\u201d, I could make my high school easier. I remember when Hitler walked into Poland. I\nremember some rumors. I knew my own family, friends; all of a sudden, we didn\u2019t hear from\nthem. So you grabbed a little tighter around you and loved a little more. And we lived.\n1944, March 19, the Germans occupied Hungary. I was in Budapest. That was my big chance\nto recite in a big Jewish auditorium. I couldn\u2019t and I sneaked back to my hometown Hatvan,\nwhich was not far from Budapest. Then the men were taken to working camp, all the men up to\nsixty. The women went home and came the edicts again. You had to put on the yellow star, you\nhad to move into the ghetto. From the ghetto, you were taken out to a factory, a sugar factory.\nFrom there we were taken to unknown destination. Whoever was afraid was calmed down that\nyou don\u2019t have to be afraid, we will be taken to a camp --- not a camp, a town where all the\nJews will be together. We\u2019ll learn and we believed. That\u2019s how it was....\nI remember so well like yesterday when they took us out the first time to work in the fields.\nThey took out 50 people from the ghetto. Meanwhile in the ghetto, they collected money, the\nGermans and the Hungarian Nazis, for us. My mother pulled me with her. That\u2019s way, after a\nfull day\u2019s work, we were coming back and the people of this lovely little town stood there while\nwe had to march in the middle of the gutter, singing and kissing the ground where the horses\nwere going before. The people, they stood by and laughed and cheered and clapped. I\nremember the faces around me. I remember the fear of dying. Got me like a knife. I remember\nthe hatred what came into me when I saw my so-called friends in the crowd laughing and\npointing at me. I remember other times when my friend next door wouldn\u2019t say hello to me\nwhen I had to wear the yellow star. There were some nice people --- went out their way to say a\nkind word; probably very ashamed of it. But nobody raised a question, nobody asked why. All\nof a sudden, good law abiding citizens became lower than dirt. The property was taken, the\nfreedom was taken away. Fear was planted. I saw people being beaten in the street and nobody\ncame to rescue. I remember the Hungarian so-called police who beat us unmercifully,\nunmercifully. You learned to be quiet; you learned to be a Jew and talked about Palestine and\nyou were no more Hungarians. I remember when we had to give in the jewelry, the radios, the\nbicycles, the record players, all the treasure, the jewelry, my mother\u2019s wedding band. I\nremember when we were allowed only 50 pounds, excuse me, 100 pounds, 50 kilos out of the\nhome to go to the inner ghetto. My mother saved, since I was a baby, my hope chest and\ntearing all up. The photo albums, tear out the pictures and leave my house. Everything on our\nback. My mother and I were the last to be taken out from our home because my father was so\nwell liked, big deal, I loved him. I remember my mother\u2019s tears and her cries when I took the\nbeautiful and never used Czechoslovakian dishes, glass dishes, and cracking them together\nsaying, if I can\u2019t use it, nobody else should. She had a pearl necklace, Richleau pearl they call\nit here. It was not round shape, it\u2019s more like different size, more like pear shape. I threw it\ninto the bathroom, the toilet. If I couldn\u2019t have it, nobody else will. But I remember my mother\ncleaning up the house before we left, 1t should be neat. I\u2019m fighting with her, leave them and\nburn this and let not have --- they enjoy it and my mother smiled and said, oh, we\u2019ll come back\nhere. I also remember two peasants coming who loved my father and wanted to hide us like ---\nas we live in Yonkers, one in New Rochelle would hide me and the other would hide my mother\nin Hastings. Being we were so uninformed to know what\u2019s coming and what\u2019s going on in the\nworld, my mother refused saying, I can\u2019t go away from my child. Whatever happens, will\nhappen with us two because I can\u2019t be separated. Well, Mengele separated us, Dr. Mengele in\nAuschwitz. My mother wanted to kill herself as we were going on this train to Auschwitz and I",
        "didn\u2019t let her. I should have, maybe, I don\u2019t know. Anyhow, you learn to be a Jew very, very\nhardly with many, many, many pain and many disappointment. I would envy those who had\nfaith, who was brought up as a religious Jewish kid because at least, they had some background\ninformation. I only was a Hungarian first. Oh, how I loved the gypsy music which was always\nplaying and how much I loved the Hungarian poets. How heartily I recited. I learned about\nJewish poets and I learned about Palestine. Our Jewish hierarchies, even our rabbi in that time\ndidn\u2019t approve of it. They only told us to follow the rules and follow the laws and nothing will\nhappen. We are Hungarian and nothing could happen to us. Hungary will not let us go. Then\nyou learn in the Eichmann time, that Hungary paid the German to take us out.\nJune 12, 1944, we were taken from Hatvan into a freight train and we started our journey. June\n15, we arrived to Auschwitz. This was the first time I ever heard of the word, Auschwitz. It\nwas a big, immense place with horrible smell. People were running with sticks in pajamas,\npajama-looking things, no hair. I asked my mother are we in an insane asylum? We were taken\nout from the train and all our valise, our papers, our identification are staying in the train. We\nhave to go in front of the SS ---- we were selected, one to right, one to left. I was taken from\nmy mother. I was sent to right. She was sent to left. My girlfriend who was in the next line\nheard Mengele and the foreman talking to my mother who was crying. Why are you crying?\nYour daughter is going ahead of you, waiting for you with coffee and bed. Just go with the rest.\nYou\u2019re so young and beautiful, shouldn\u2019t have a big girl like yours, just go with the rest and you\nwill see your daughter shortly. My mother went and I went. She was 38 years old. I was taken\nto a bathhouse. I had a belt, a wide leather belt which my mother sewed in money and a switch\nknife. If ever anybody tried to attack me, I should use it. Whoever heard that; you will be in\nrags, hairless, nameless, sometimes walking naked because there was no clothes for me. We\nwere taken into a big barrack. You didn\u2019t know who was there and there were about 1,000\npeople in one barrack. We were sleeping on the floor. Was no food, there was no toilet, there\nwas no dignity. There was nothing. You get up at three in the morning, they counted you and\nthen they herd you back again to the same room. You couldn\u2019t go out. You put your hand ---\none put the hand on the hairless head just to see if it\u2019s nightmare or if it\u2019s real. Then I cried and\nI asked one of the kapo, a Slovakian girl, where\u2019s my mother? She pointed to a chimney. She\nsaid she\u2019s burning over there. Of course you couldn\u2019t believe that. You saw your friend, you\ndidn\u2019t see yourself and you started to laugh because you couldn\u2019t recognize it in that condition.\nThen slowly it dawned on you that this 1s it, it\u2019s real, it\u2019s there and you lived. You try to adjust\nand form a new family, you had to belong. Somebody you have to love and love yourself and it\nwas very hard there to love, even yourself or your neighbor. You fought for everything, a piece\nof apple on the floor, so nobody should step on you. And the bread, you had to hide it. I never\nhide my bread, I always ate it. I always was hungry, immensely hungry and hunger hurt.\nBelieve me, hunger is pain. There were three things what hold me up high --- hold myself up\nhigh. I never stole from my fellow-inmates; I never fought for food; and I never sat on the\n\u2018\u201ckuble\u2019\u201d\u2019. The kuble was a barrel which I took out and brought in but I never sat on it. It was the\nlowest point --- lowest thing in my eyes, it was filled with diarrhea and everybody\u2019s shit and\neverybody\u2019s urine and it\u2019s all over. I couldn\u2019t sit on it; in front of everybody. But I got up in the\nmorning and I took it out to the latrine before anybody. I was in the latrine committee rather\nthan sit on it. It\u2019s ridiculous, it\u2019s stupid but it held me back. It\u2019s called dignity. Human dignity\nfor a sixteen year old. The food what we get was garbage. It was deliberately over salted if we\nget anything and then they didn\u2019t give us water; or they give us black coffee without sugar or\nsome kind of tea. It was too early yet in the stage to be able to eat it. We were in this place for\nabout three weeks. At July, about two weeks when I was taken to Krakow Plaszow --- to me\nKrakow Plaszow was the worst place. It was a Jewish cemetery. There we took out the marble",
        "grave markers were taken into Krakow to redone the gutters. Many times you hit into the earth\nand you came up with skeleton or piece of bone and heads and the work was horrible. It wasn\u2019t\nproductive work, it was sheer torture. We took how you call it --- gravestones, big stones. Six,\nseven, eight girls were taken as horses and had to pull wagons. There were beating, constant\nbeating, big German shepherds were --- trained dogs to go back in after the woman\u2019s breast and\nmen\u2019s testicles and pull them apart if one went out of the line. I saw the Gestapo beating and\nasking people, you know, for some stupid secrets. I saw them being tortured --- this is where I\nsaw young children taken out and halfway alive still, burning on the fire and screaming. There\nwas no God, God didn\u2019t listen and I said there was no God. But still we tried. You had a\nhuman dignity and you choked down the garbage that was called food. When hunger was very\nhurting, you cried. Nobody else saw and the six, seven girls were band together, you had\nnobody else. They delegated one as a mother and took care. One went for water and one went\nfor food and one tried to save the other. Keep up the spirits and we joked. Every time you felt\nlike crying, then we laughed. One was an opera singer who sang and I recited poetry at night.\nAnother teacher taught us something. We talked about resistance --- that was our resistance.\nThey could not push us that low or that down. You hang on to humanity and they were gone. I\nbecame sick, I was taken to the hospital there in Krakow. I had typhoid fever and I lived it\nthrough. I sang. The Polish Jews, they were still in their ghettos and they had some --- some\nhad food. So they told me to sing, they would give me food. I had fever and I sang and I sang.\nSometimes I get food. Then there were rumors that we will be taken again. My friend came\nand sneaked me out of the hospital. Hid me in the so-called bed and we were taken out again\nback to Auschwitz.\nKrakow was the worst place for me and the worst was the captain on a white horse. I don\u2019t\nknow his name. I know he was hanged after. Krakow, I got so many beatings and I thought\nmany times about killing myself. Can\u2019t live like this --- going to the electric wire. I had a\nfriend, her name was Kathy. Was a beautiful, intelligent, sweet girl, full of fire. She gave me a\nbig speech. She told me that look at me, I eat all the shit what they giving here and Ill go home\nand Ill give it back. Everything I get and I live it through and look at me. She slipped and as\nshe slipped, she was falling toward the wire. She grabbed the live wire and she was dead in a\nsecond, that was Kathy. There were other girls, a girl friend, Susie. Her eye was --- one of the\nkapo started to hit her and hit her in the eyes. Her eyes were coming out. She was blinded in\none eye. There were constant beating and fighting and killing. If not the German, then the\nJewish kapos. For a gold tooth, they killed people and pulled out their teeth. Food was\neverything. It was something what constantly was on everybody\u2019s thought and we became\nskinnier and sicker and filled with boils and ragged. They only gave us rags and lice with them.\nWe had horrible, horrible time. The fear from one another, from one Jew to the other and the\nGerman laughter and they came in clean beautiful clothes and touched us with a white glove\nonly. You felt lower and lower. Then you said no, I\u2019m not lower, I\u2019m just as good, I\u2019m better\nthan them. There was a young German man, a German SS, who saw me once. It was in\nAugust, we were working in the field and it was a peculiar weather. It was extremely cold in\nthe morning and the night but it was very hot in the daytime. He was drinking from his canteen.\nAs he was drinking, I was swallowing. He turned around and he offered me his drink from his\nown canteen. To me, I was in rags and filth and I looked at him and I said, you\u2019re offering me?\nHe said, yes, why not? I don\u2019t hate you. I looked at him and I said then how could you look\naround and see this? He said, I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m only following orders. Tomorrow I\u2019|l shoot you\nwithout a doubt if they tell me to do so. I looked at him and I said, oh, just tell me one thing,\nhow could you sleep after this? How could you put your head down and go to church or tend to\nyour friend, go home and kiss a girl. Could you ever live like normal people again. He said, oh",
        "yes, I\u2019m only following orders. This was already July, 1944 when the Americans were already\nin France. I didn\u2019t know about my father. I didn\u2019t believe that my mother was dead. We left\nagain and we hoped again. The rumors were flying that tomorrow we\u2019re going home. Or we\nwill be away from here or they\u2019re taking us here or there. You hang on to hopes. I remember\nwhen we were in that assassination against Hitler, they tried --- an attempt to assassinate him.\nEvery tenth of the prisoner was killed. We didn\u2019t know why. I remember when they were taken\nfrom us. It was extremely quiet in our barracks. Somebody started to pray. That passed too. I\nremember rape was done to us. Not by Germans, by kapos. Although it didn\u2019t have to be rapes\nbecause there was a price. A girl\u2019s price was a piece of buttered bread, a women\u2019s price on the\nmarket was a piece of bread and an onion because was less work. I never was tempted to go\nthere. Was too low. Maybe it would be a little more, I might have been. Hunger is very painful.\nI was constantly, constantly hungry and thirsty. I find my friend, my all-time best friend since\nchildhood, selling me water for bread. In August, we were taken, evacuated from the Krakow\nPlaszow ghetto, we were taken back to Auschwitz. That was a three days\u2019 trip. This is the first\ntime they gave us herring in August, and didn\u2019t give us water for three days. They put us ina\ntrain. First 80 people in a freight train. Then they put more and more and more into it. People\nwent absolutely crazy. Hunger hurt but thirst is much worse. There were people who drank\ntheir own urine and drank their blood and died. Everybody was fighting for just to put down\ntheir feet to be able to stand. We throwed the dead ones in one end of the train. Then we arrive\nin Auschwitz. Oh yeah, in between time, they once opened the train --- we were yelling for\nwater, begging for water. One soldier came with water and threw at us, wouldn\u2019t let us drink.\nWe arrived in Auschwitz. There was again a selection and I was again survived. I was sleeping\nanother barrack the whole night. I was with my aunt from night to morning and I didn\u2019t know\nit. She only find me in the morning when we spending the night to be taken to another part of\nAuschwitz. She was working near the crematorium. She was working with the Canadians, the\nwhite kerchiefs, \u201cgirls\u201d. They had a \u201cgood position\u201d. They could get the food, they were\nseparating the clothing and food from the deported luggage.\n(End of Tape 1, Side A)\nI asked her where my mother was and she told me about the crematorium. I was beaten and I\nsaw her being beaten. She spit out her tooth and I spit out two tooth. But I had somebody, I\nknow that somebody in my family was alive in that time. I learned the fact that my\ngrandmother died, my mother died, my cousins died and I believed that first kapo who told me\nthat they are burning people here. That was the first time I believed it. I didn\u2019t want to live nor\ndid I want to die any more. I didn\u2019t fought to be alive.\nI was just lucky or unlucky. Anybody, any survivor who says to you or to anybody, I was lucky\nbecause I did this so I survived. Or I did that and I was smart or I did this and that\u2019s why I\nsurvived. They are all lying. Or making it --- they just believe in that because it was sheer luck\nwho came back and who didn\u2019t. Just sheer luck.\nSo we were in Auschwitz again. And this time, we had pritches, bunk beds, we had bad. We\ngot gray uniforms, not the stripe, just plain gray uniform. We were deloused and we still\nweren\u2019t working. We were beaten every time somebody was hanging out of line and any little\namount of \u201cundisciplined behavior\u201d was good thing for beating. The dead was still counted.\nThen in September we were taken into Augsburg factory where we working in an airplane\nfactory. That saved my life. .... We were tattooed in Auschwitz in our hand. We got again the\ngray uniform. We went through again a selection. Again the usual freight train ride. Five\nhundred of us were taken to Augsburg into a factory where the first time I was working outside\nin Augsburg for the bomb. Cleaning up after the bombing. Many times I found food put down",
        "where we were expected to go. October came and we heard about Horthy, our Hungarian\ngovernor going away to Germany. No more is operating from the German army and then the\nafternoon we heard that the Hungarian SS party took over the governments. Again we grouped\ntogether. We had a mother, Marta and I had a friend, Veronica and another friend who was\nactually from Hatvan, my hometown. Her name was Elizabeth, she was very good to me. Very\ngood it mean always food. She gave me food. She gave me her portion. She was a decent girl\notherwise. Marta was our mother and we cling together. We talked, talked about getting out,\nwhen will be, if it will be over. We\u2019ll be together. We gave up the hope that we will meet\nanybody or find our family more or less. Sometimes we believed that we will reach Palestine --\n- sometimes we didn\u2019t that we ever will wake up even the next day. We were very happy when\nthe Americans bombed the city or even our factory. We cared nothing of being alive. It was\nunimportant any more. The importance were that it should be heard about it. The world Jewry\nshould know about it. That Hitler should be defeated. Rumors were constantly flying.\nWhen I was working finally in the factory itself, after two or three months of outside duty, I got\ninto, in November, into the factory --- which again I was lucky because it saved me. I was\nworking next to a German woman one side and next to a German man on the other side so there\nwas no way to sabotaging work. Whatever we done, it went through another German hand.\nOne German man, a beautiful human being, even though they didn\u2019t have much to eat, he gave\nus two heflling, the two prisoners, the two jailbirds, food every morning. I find food in my\nplace and my friend find food next to her. There was washing facility here and more or less\nbetter food. The winter we survived. I learned to walk in wooden shoes or without shoes. I\nlearned to sleep while I was working or standing. I had blood poisoning Christmas time. I was\noperated on my arms and we had a Jewish doctor with us. Told me that they will cut off my\narm. I had about 104, 105 fever and I survived that without an aspirin. I woke up after the\noperation and I tried to touch my arm and it was there.. I went further and my hand was there\nbut I was afraid to touch my finger, my finger was there. So I was very lucky all over. I had\npleurisy in that place. Also I survived that without aspirin even. I was taken out to take out the\nbomb, to put it out. The German thought we are very brave but it was no fear in us. It did not\nmatter if we dead or alive or whatever; but it mattered if a bomb fell on them. We were always\nvery happy when the American fighters came, the airplane came and the bombing was beautiful\nto our eyes. That\u2019s how we were, wished to die. Whenever we were taken, they went to the\nshelter --- we were just taken down into a place where we couldn\u2019t escape. It was delightful.\nWe sang, we ate our food --- whoever saved it. I never saved my food, I was very happy to eat\nit. Almost all of us survived in that place until March when we were taken out again.\nWe were taken to Muehldorf-Waldlager. In that place, my introduction to the place were one of\nthe young schriber saw me ---- schriber is a writer who wrote the people\u2019s name and numbers in\n--- he looked up and he said to me, oh my sister. I said you are mistaken, I am not your sister.\nHe took my name, my number, excuse me, he was kissing me. He jumped up and kissed me,\noh, my sister, my dear sister. I said no I\u2019m not your sister and I told him where I come from and\nmy name and serial number. After that, he very quietly gave me the place where to go which\nwas --- in there we were sleeping on the good earth. There was a trench between the beds.\nThere was a trench where we were walking and there was a tent over us. Again I saw a man, a\nskeleton man around us. The place was surrounded by electric wire but between one camp to\nthe other, between one section to the other, there was just normal wires. I went back to my\nbarrack or whatever you --- tent, and I get a message from one of the longer-time inmate that I\nwas called to the wire where the man meets woman. These were the hierarchies, the kapos, the\ndoctors, etc., they had more energy, more food in them to even be able to think, not necessarily",
        "sex, but be more than human who needed companion rather than all thinking of food and\nimmediate danger, I think. Anyhow, I didn\u2019t go. The second day I was put to work. I was\nworking near the kitchen and at night again I got a call to go out to the wire to meet this\nschriber. I was, I don\u2019t know, proud or stupid or what have you --- so I send back a message\nthat I am not a cow to be looked over and leave me alone. Well, next day, I was out to work in\nan underground airport. This was in 1945, March. They put cement on my shoulder which I\nsupposed to climb with two flights up. The cement was about 25 kilo, about 50 pounds and to\ntake it up two flights. I just --- they put it on my shoulder and I just fell down with it. They put\nit on again my shoulder and I fell with it. So I was beaten back, beaten from the work back to\nthe camp which was about a good kilometer. At the door, he was receiving this boy. His name\nwas Eddy Binbaum from Kejnark who was waiting there and took my number, took my name,\nmy number. It wasn\u2019t the name only, the number. He started --- as I left he whispered to me\nand he said, now you coming to the wire and I said, yes, of course. I went there and we talked.\nHe explained that he thought I was his long lost sister and he was in the Warsaw ghetto. He\ngavc me food through the gates and I was put to a very easy job. I went into the forest\ncollecting acorn. I got even a toothbrush which I didn\u2019t see for a year, almost a year. I saw him\nthrough the gates and we talked. I never liked him. I always had a fear in me for him, because\nof him, because of his behavior. I learned a great deal from this experience. That you --- in the\ncircumstances where you are, you never know what you will do just to survive. Because if that\nboy would have asked me in that particular time, after the beating, that if I have to go back there\nor lay down for him, I would have laid down for him. I don\u2019t think I would ever be ashamed of\nit. I don\u2019t know, it never come to that point. But I could understand a little more. Anyhow I\ncome back to this part for understanding. Then we were there until April.\nOn April 24, no April 23, there was an airplane, a bombing and many prisoners escaped. They\nput a --- what you call it, a laousserstrauser --- it meant a punishment stripe into my starting-to-\ngrow hair. It\u2019s about three inches with cut into the middle of your head completely, like an\nIndian or like the Hara Krishna people except it was reversed. Anyhow I was taken to the train\nwith the rest of the 500 girls and the rest of the camp. All of a sudden, this schriber came with\ntwo SS men and called my name and number. He told the head SS that I\u2019m not able to travel, I\nhad typhoid fever. I should go back with him to the camp. As I told you, I had some fear in me.\nI was climbing down when people who were with me from my town; they told me, don\u2019t go.\nYou will be a whore. You will be his lover and that\u2019s why he\u2019s doing it. So I didn\u2019t. I went\ndown and said I\u2019m much better. I\u2019m all right now and I shouldn\u2019t be taken back. This boy\nquietly told me that it cost him a lot of money to take me out of the --- a lot of gold, not money -\n-- to take me out of the transport because they are going into Innsbruck and they will kill us all\nwith a benzine injection. Benzine injection that we could burn faster. Meanwhile every time\nwe left the camp, like Augsburg or Mueldorf or Waldlager, we saw the Germans trying to erase\nall track of the camp. The papers and everything was burning and they were in a mad rush to\nclean up after them. That\u2019s the time when my group swore that if any of us will be alive, we\nwill talk so it shouldn\u2019t be forgotten no matter how much the Germans, the SS were trying to\ncover up. Whoever will survive will talk. So with this knowledge of benzine injections, I\nclimbed back to the train and sat there. I didn\u2019t tell nobody our future. I figured whatever\nhappens to the rest, should happen to me. Sit there. April 27, they opened the train, the\nGermans, and they said we are free. It was a beautiful, sunny, gorgeous afternoon. The town\nname is Poing, it was spring. Everybody started to run away from the train. I climbed down\nand I became hysterical. I cried and I stood by the train and I couldn\u2019t get up. I kissed the\nearth. I just got paralyzed, I just couldn\u2019t get up. My friends were trying to pull me away from\nthe train. I couldn\u2019t move. I was skinny and the knowledge of impending death and the",
        "benzine injections in my head and keeping it secret was just too much. AIl of a sudden, the\nguards, they say we were free. It was about a good five minutes and then we heard the machine\nguns. We were completely surrounded by other SS and like a sickle, I don\u2019t know how you say,\nwhen you see that with the thing 1n his hand, death and sickle, just went with the machine gun,\nwent in a complete circle. I saw the girls who were together, some of them from the beginning,\nfalling. Then I could get up --- oh I jumped, I jumped back to the train, back to the freight train\nand we started to pull back our comrades, the girls who will be able to pick up. The train\nstarted again and April 28, the American bomb came and started to machine gun our train\nbecause the Germans at Poing put an anti-aircraft wagon to our train. They started to shoot the\nAmerican airplane. The Americans came down and, in return, they started to machine-gun us.\nThat train ride was my lowest , the lowest point. I know that I will become a\nmusleman after that. It meant not only will you be dead --- I gave up. I know the minute when\nI give up. In that point, when I gave up, I remember as yesterday. I even remember better than\nyesterday. I was in the train and somebody left a piece of bread, a crumb. I had a very big\nstruggle in me. To steal it or not to steal it. When I turned around, somebody else stole it and\nthere was a big fight between the girls. We get low and we were dirty. We were covered with\nfilth and was thinking, look at myself and I said, there is no use. Maybe the Germans are right;\nthat we shouldn\u2019t be alive. When the machine guns started, I was standing in a corner where\nthere was a little hole looking out the passing wheels. Everybody who had somebody who was\nstanding with me there, two of my girlfriends, Kathy S and Lili, they have somebody pull them\ndown. Made room for them to lay down so that machine guns shouldn\u2019t hit them. I was\nstanding there and nobody picked me or pulled me down no matter how much they liked me.\nThere was no way to throw myself. The rest of the skeletons were dead people and hurt people.\nSomebody, some man had a striped uniform. They pushed it out to show the American raiders.\nTheir machine gun stopped. They went and gone around and meanwhile I said my goodbyes in\nmy little life, in my little head to everybody. I counted whom I will see again in other world. I\nwas very sure that that\u2019s it, that it\u2019s finished.\nMay 1* in the morning, our camp boys opened the train and they said, the Americans are here. I\nborned, I reborn May 1\u201c. I was 22 kilos which is about forty pounds. I remember an American\nsoldier picked me up and I was begging him not to give me back to the German again and then I\ndon\u2019t know nothing for a week. I was very lucky again. A doctor friend of mine, Dr. Gatheish\nGabol found me and he took me to Partenkirchen to a hospital for a week. He didn\u2019t give me\nfood which was very good because anybody who got food in the belly in the first couple of\ndays, they died. Well, that\u2019s my story. I was liberated at Seeshaupt, taken to Munich, then to\nDachau.\nThen I was in an UNRA camp till September. I had many experience there. I went home to\nfind my father. Tried to pick up life. Met my husband, lost my first child, waited to go to either\nIsrael or America. Israel, I mean Palestine, in that time there was still the camps in Cyprus\nwhich I couldn\u2019t bear to go. We came to America. I picked up my life. I\u2019m happy to be alive.\nMostly I enjoy every minute. I gain many thing by this experience. I know Ido. I ama\ndifferent person. I was a different person when I came out of camp. Now that the question is\nup and people are asking and there is interest in our stories, it\u2019s easier for me to --- finally after\n33 years --- to heal my wounds. I was an atheist when I came out of the camp. Then I became\nan agnostic and my children born and raised in. When Eichmann was caught, it didn\u2019t matter to\nme that they will hang him or not. It made me happy that there 1s a trial, there was a trial.\nWhen the first American turncoats were showed, I became more understanding about a Jewish\nturncoat or kapos or collaborators. When you seventeen, everything black and white; when you",
        "fifty-one, you can see gray. I don\u2019t know if I would be --- how I would react if it would have\nbeen presented with the same situation that they were, those kapos.. I know now that the\nGermans deliberately picked mostly the low people of our people to --- the opportunities to ---\nwho were able to take these. They did it deliberately so that we could be more angry with what\nwas immediate object to us, another hefling another prisoner, rather than the\nimmaculate god-like clean Germans. Nevertheless, when an American Jew says I\u2019m proud to\nbe a Jew, I think of the kapos. I\u2019m not proud to be anything. I\u2019m proud to be me. I\u2019m proud to\nbe a human being. Maybe, just maybe there 1s a little saying what I read somewhere -- if\nanybody else, not the Jewish people, would have been put in the same situation, they wouldn\u2019t\nonly fight with mouth, they probably would kill each other -- which didn\u2019t happen.\nI learned human nature. Nobody\u2019s perfect including myself. I learned tolerance on many, many\nthings but I can\u2019t tolerate self-pity. I very seldom indulge pity in me, for me. I\u2019m like the steel;\nI love my family probably more than it\u2019s normal but they are the most important thing to me\nafter my freedom --- before my freedom. They first and then freedom. It\u2019s nice to have nice\nthings but I could be very well without it. Whenever I felt low, I have to think very far, how\nlower I was before so everything after that is just high up. It\u2019s hard for me to see the flower\npicked because I know it will die but everything is already easy after that experience. You can\u2019t\nbe afraid of dying. I\u2019m neither afraid of aging. When you were sixteen and never thought you\nwill be 17, you\u2019re just not afraid of it, of dying, or aging.\nIsrael, when I went to Israel, I made peace with God. I got my answer, my own answer. I know\nthe world would never allow Israel to come in existence if not six million martyrs on their part.\nOh, yeah, I have guilt too. It was a very, very deep guilt that I\u2019m alive while the others didn\u2019t\nsurvive. I don\u2019t know why. Somehow I always knew. I know in my head, I didn\u2019t do nothing\nto be here and I was just lucky. But this guilt was persisting and the only way to press this was\nto talk the way I promised them. And I think I did. Although people said we are opportunists\nand liked to be pitied and so on. It wasn\u2019t so. I t was just sheer frustration that they\ndidn\u2019t want to hear it.\nI had beautiful comrades, had beautiful experiences with them. I had friends who find their\nown potato and gave me half of it, when there was no food. The same token, I steal for them\nand I was beaten. Borach but it didn\u2019t matter. We cried at night when nobody else saw us. You\ncould be sure the other person turned around and said don\u2019t cry and started to tell you\nsomething with a funny and you laughed. We tried to give each other a spirit to go on. When\nthere was no hope, we created. You know you lie with the optimism, nevertheless you try. I\nhad horrors, I saw unbelievable horrors. I saw babies being killed in fire when they weren\u2019t\ncompletely dead yet. I saw dogs tearing woman\u2019s breasts. I saw fighting like cats and dogs for\na piece of breadcrumb. I liced (?), oh boy do I lice. When I was filled with boils and our feet\nhurted and still you could laugh. Still you recited poetry. Still there was a woman who talked\nabout Shakespeare there and the other one who went to the Bible, without the book, only in her\nhead. There were girls who for eleven months didn\u2019t eat a piece of crappy meat what they gave,\nwouldn\u2019t eat it and kept the religion as it should be kept with the laws. I learned that it\u2019s easy to\nbe nasty --- by the same token light up; the world lights up with a good word. I learn that it\u2019s\neasy to say bad things to the other in anger. I learned to say the good things which make the\nworld a nicer place. (End of Side B, Tape 1)\nBut in your heart when you talk all the atrocities, all the horror, all the pain, the hunger, the\nthirst, the humiliation, the hurt, the worry about your relatives, the pain what is unbearable\nwhen you see your friend die next to you, the lice bites, the fever without aspirin, without water,",
        "itching, filth. I saw in Krakow Plaszow I a hospital when a baby is born and one of the SS\ncame in and tear it apart. I saw a girl, after her mother was beaten, ran to the German and held\nhis uniform and yelled, don\u2019t you have a mother? Both of them were killed just for holding on\nto his uniform. They talking about resistance. How could you resist when absolute indifference\nsurround you? Not to talk about those people really hated you; but the rest, the good --- the nice\npeople who just didn\u2019t care. It didn\u2019t hit them, didn\u2019t happen to them. There were many people\nwith us but it wasn\u2019t the same. When you are alone, completely alone in the world, and you are\nsurrounded by hate, you become timid. The resistance just --- there was resistance --- just to\nstay alive was a form of resistance. When you recited poetry, that was a form of resistance. But\nstill --- with all these odds, you are still human, that was a form of resistance. When you\nwalked in the snow barefooted because the wooden shoes, the Holland type of wooden shoes\nwhich everybody got the same size, didn\u2019t fit on your feet and you had to run and rush or else\nyou would be punished. You walked barefoot and still you could laugh and look at their eyes\nand keep your head up and say, I might be lower than you but I\u2019m just as human being and\nmaybe much better than you are.\nThere were many, as I started to say, many people who were not Jewish also in camps.\nAmerican prisoners and Russian prisoners and Polish prisoners-of-war; they had it a little\neasier, a little better. It wasn\u2019t that absolute aloneness, the nothingness behind it. It wasn\u2019t\nnecessarily their family worried, where is their mother, where is their father, were they killed\nand why? It wasn\u2019t a hate surrounding -- the neighbors spit on you and so on. There were\nChristian wives or husbands who went into the camp deliberately and I definitely take off my\nhat to them. They were just in the same boat as we were. They were our comrades even if they\nweren\u2019t Jews, they were my sisters, my blood brothers and I give them credit. I don\u2019t have any\nnotes, I\u2019m doing this just on the spur of the moment and if I\u2019m jumping here and there you\u2019 ll\nhave to excuse me.\nI want to talk about after liberation a little bit to finish my story. After I was out of the hospital,\nI went to the United Nations Restitution Action, I think that means UNRA camp. We were there\nfrom May to September, I got home, back to Hungary. During that time, I personally again\ncould only talk about my experience. Where I found friends, who took me out\nfrom Muenicle to Dachau where he was working in the American kitchen and saved my life by\ngiving me food and shelter. In there, there was a time of my life when I didn\u2019t belong to\nanybody. I didn\u2019t had to be account for anything, perfect absolute freedom. I done what I\npleased, I went wherever I went. I know that we either go to Palestine there when the Haganah\npeople came up for us. Our group decided to go first to Hungary to see if maybe somebody\nalive. From that time, I would have gone to Israel. Probably would never be in here, meet my\nhusband, so who knows what was right, who knows what was wrong. Anyhow I didn\u2019t, I went\nback to Hungary. Meanwhile let\u2019s go back to the UN camp.\nWe got food, we got shelter, we got clothes. There was no worry where the food was coming\nfrom. The most important thing still was food to your stomach and that was done. There was a\nrelative freedom in it. Being in jail, everything was beautiful. Being in jail and out of jail, it\nwas everything beautiful. The young friends and all these. I again recited poetry. I lived with\nmy so-called new family. We were responsible only for teach other, to each other. I was well\nliked. I went to camp to camp to recite poetry. I was in the American entertainment committee\nwhich meant that they took us to all these UNRA camps. I met many people, of course,\nwhenever we meet, we always ask, you was with Hatvan? The people from Hatvan? Or did you\nmeet people from Satoralia, Whely, Erdoebene? Where I -- my grandparents came and so on.",
        "You recuperated slowly. You had no outside contact with anybody beside your friends and\nbeside your fellow liberated inmates. Then in September, we were taken back to Hungary; also\nagain of course, in freight train but in much better condition, with food, with shelter, with\neverything. One of my friend who was two days before me, came home, came back to\nHungary; waited the Hungarian border and told me that my father is waiting for me at the\nstation. Well, when I saw him, I thought he will die. He was skinny, he was ragged. He was\nliberated January and after January every single train he waited till he heard that I\u2019m alive. He\nwaited after that every single train again until I came home and it left a toll on him. Then I\nbecame sick, I had again a pleurisy and I was taken to the mountain, my grandparent\u2019s house. I\nmet Ernie, fell in love, we got married and we had a plan to go to Israel. We went into a\nHachshara, a aliyah camp and I became pregnant. There was no transports going to Palestine\nbecause most of the transports were caught in and was taken to Cyprus so we decided to get in\ntouch with my uncle in France. He gave us working papers so we will be able to leave legally\nHungary. I had no bad time after the war in Hungary but I never went home to Hatvan. I just\ncouldn\u2019t bear the thought to go to Hatvan. I felt if I go near my house and I see something of\nmy mother laying somewhere, I will run amok. So Hatvan was no more in my eyes. I had a\nbaby, a preemie baby. We tried to keep her alive for two months and then she died. Then we\nleft to France. We lived in Lyon for two years. Put in legal paper for either America or\nPalestine, to go to Palestine. My father, meanwhile, was already in America and family meant\nan awful lot to me. I knew that I have a lot of family here. So the paper came through and we\ndid came to America.\nWe started anew and started from way bottom. Nobody helped us, thank God. Whatever we\nmade, it was my husband\u2019s two hands. He started right away a little shop in the neighborhood\nand went to work. Then I became pregnant with my Kathy which was my happiest moment in\nmy life because after the first baby I had to wait for four years till I was allowed to become\npregnant. I had doubts that I could be pregnant anymore. We struggled and made a life and I\nwas very happy. I am happy. I have three beautiful daughters. Ernie --- Ernest ---and I raised\nthem the best of our knowledge, the best to our ability. There are times when I couldn\u2019t console\nthem as maybe other mothers could because their problem or their cry was so ridiculous to me\nafter I went through, that I couldn\u2019t feel sorry for something childish like not getting the good\ndress or what she wanted. I can\u2019t tolerate self- pity as I said before, on me, or on anybody. I\ntried my best with my children. I made many mistakes, of course. But all the mistakes was\nhonest mistakes, not being -- that\u2019s one thing to hurt them. I love them more maybe than\nanybody else loved their child because to me it means a little more to have a family than\nsomebody who gets it easy, got it easy. I love very deeply. I try to be tolerant to other people.\nWell, this is my story. I hope that little bit we learn from each --- from somebody else\u2019s\nexperience and it shouldn\u2019t happen again. Not to me, not to the Jews, not to colored man, a\nblack man, or a yellow man, or a Christian, or a Vietnamese, or anybody.\nI love this country. It gave me shelter. I\u2019m full and equal citizen. I have a vote. I came with\nnothing to this country and I built up a nice life. I like the American people who might be a\nlittle more naive than the European but they are beautiful, they are helpful. I love the youth of\nAmerica who cares for Vietnam and the black people. I love Israel. I think it\u2019s only existing\nbecause six million died for it and people working for it. I\u2019m no Hungarian any more. I am\nAmerican and Iam a Jew. It is beautiful to me to look out the window when it\u2019s raining and I\nknow that I have a shelter over my head and I have clothes to keep me warm. The smile of my\nchildren. I grew up a lot in eleven months and it always will be with me. I\u2019m far from my\nfriends. We were thrown all over the world. They got married and I got married. I don\u2019t know",
        "their married name and they don\u2019t know mine, or so few who does. I met fellow camp people.\nWe ever meet, it\u2019s like big family. Whenever I meet anybody with the same tattoo on their had\nas mine, they are close to me even if I wouldn\u2019t know their name, closer to me than anybody\nelse could be. We came to this country with nothing. We brought out my father-in-law and\nmother-in-law. Then we helped out my sister-in-law and brother-in-law. We took out my\nHungarian --- my sister-in-law is still in Hungary for twice to visit and my niece. Once we\nwent back to Hungary and the first time I went back to Hatvan, my little town. I found nobody,\nbut nobody there. There was not one Jew left in Hatvan. I\u2019m not looking forward to go again\nto Hungary although I probably will, maybe this summer to see my niece getting married. I\ndon\u2019t blame the people who completely assimilated over there, became Hungarianized. That\nmuch that they changed their name and became non-Jews or nothing, no religion or no nothing.\nThey want just to be left alone, not to be reminded, not to be anything. They couldn\u2019t left\nHungary so they have to live their life the way they can.. I try to live my life the way I see it fit.\nI don\u2019t think I could try to understand those people who are here and don\u2019t want to remember\nbeing Jews. They just want to be completely assimilated. I hope the world will let them forget\neverything but I doubt. As long as there is anti-Jewish joke or anti-Semitism open or quiet, I\nfight against it. I belong to B\u2019nai Brith --- I started to belong when I came here and heard the\nfirst time about it when I didn\u2019t know the language yet. The Anti-Defamation League because I\nknow what it could happen. But as long as I\u2019m here and not in Israel, I am very thankful for\nthis country what they done for me personally. I have deep wounds but now it starts to heal.\nNow that people are asking questions and it won\u2019t be forgotten. The libraries are full with each\nand everyone individual stories and it will become more and more I\u2019m sure. You could go there\nand pick it out. The books are not burned anymore. Even in Skokie, even the neo-Nazis could\nyell again. Maybe somebody will know that they are not just idiots but they are threats and if\nwe are standing together and fighting back now, then there won\u2019t be another Auschwitz, which I\nknow definitely. We have a country now and our head high up. I think it\u2019s another story now\nbut the awareness, we are aware what could happen, will help that it shouldn\u2019t happen again.\nThe Hungarian Jews had one year, the Polish Jews had four, the German Jews had six or eight\nyear of terror. I know that as long as I live, the American Jews, they\u2019re not going to there\nbecause we are citizens. If worst comes to worst, Ill just pack up and go to Israel because there\nis a country where the Jews live in their own field, in their own country and they fight and they\nare surrounded with Arab, enemies but they have a gun in their hand and it can\u2019t happen\nanymore. If I would have a gun in my hand, it wouldn\u2019t happen anymore.\nToday\u2019s my mother\u2019s birthday. This is 1978. She was 38 years old and I bought all the lilac in\nthe ghetto because I couldn\u2019t go out to buy her a card. A card, a little present so I stole all the\nlilacs and I gave it to her. Today I\u2019m giving in her memory, this day. I wish my father would be\nalive to hear it and to know how much I loved him, how much I appreciated the way he raised\nme. What an honor and a pleasure and what a happiness God gave me that he was alive and I\nknow him for thirty more years, 34 more years. He died --\u201944 -- no thirty years, exactly thirty\nmore years with him. At least he saw my children. He loved them and they loved him. This is\nmy story. Had to be told and I\u2019m glad I said it and God bless you all. I am very, very happy. I\ncould tell you when I\u2019m around that it was worth it --- to be alive.",
