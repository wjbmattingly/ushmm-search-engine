        "A: The spellings for the name was the same thing, but instead of Irving, his name was\nEzriel. And my mother's name was SzendlA: And my brother's name was Mosche.",
        "Q: And let's start by talking a little bit about your life before the war. Can you describe\nyour father's occupation and the type of schooling and the family life you had before the\nwar?",
        "A: Yeah. My father's parents were bakers in Shedlitz. And he was born in 1900, also\nMarch the 23rd. But he didn't like the family because they were too religious for him, so\nwhen he grew up, he didn't want to be a baker, so he became a shoemaker. In 1923, he\nwas trying to avoid the Polish army, he went to Berlin, and he worked in Berlin for four\nor five years, approximately, as a shoemaker. He was making fancy shoes there. After \u2014\n\u2014 in 1928, he came back to Poland, and he married my mother. And I was born in\n1928. After 1928, I was one years old, my father didn't like living in Shedlitz, so we\nmoved to Aleksandrow Kujawski. This was not far. It's in Poland and . The reason\nhe moved there, because they found out over here he could make a nice living making\nshoes and selling them to people that was from Poland. So, when I came there, I was one\nyears old. My father started a business \u2014 well, actually, a Polish lady, because\nhe was in business with my mother, making the shoes and selling them. So, I was right\nbehind most of the time, and I spoke Polish. We lived there 'til 1938. In 1938, after the\nKristallnacht, most of the people were living \u2014\u2014 there was only 150, 200 Jews, not too\nmany Jews living there. Most of them were Polk Deutsche living there. 1938 became\nvery bad for us, so we had to leave Aleksandrow, and we went back to Shedlitz, came to\nShedlitz. So, my father's went to work for a sports factory. They were making sport\nshoes for skiing, ice skating, and soccer, and soccer balls.",
        "Q: And when your father was working, could you talk about the type of education,\nactivities, hobbies that you and your brother had?",
        "A: I had the same education like I had in Aleksandrow, because I was not used to Jewish\nlife, because most of the Jewish kids lived, like, in a ghetto. They had to go to Jewish\nschools. They didn't play with Polish kids. They were afraid. They were beaten up.\nThey couldn't go to swim. They couldn't ride a bicycle. They couldn't play ball. But I\nwas used to that Polish life, so I registered myself, and I went to a school, to a\nPolish school for a year. In that school, I became very popular because I'm a very good\nsoccer player and a ping\u2014pong player, and a volleyball player. So, they kept me there\ngood. They treated me good. Now, the war broke out in 1939. In 1939, when\nthe war broke out, was terrible. All the \u2014\u2014 half of Shedlitz was bombed. So, all my\nmother's relatives, most of them, got killed. So, they all moved in with us. So, they all\nlived with us in the ghetto, like for \u2014\u2014 like ten people living 1n one room.",
        "Q: Let's move back. Before the ghetto was established, after the bombing \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014\u2014 do they move in with you before the ghetto or \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Sure. They moved in before the ghetto, because they have no place left to live, so\nthey slept in my house, over there. We slept on the floor. We slept on couches, because\nthere was no mattresses in Europe. In Europe, a mattress was straw and a sack. That was\nyour mattress. And in the ghetto, when it started, the ghetto, they took away all the men\nright away, they took away. So, they took my father away, too. So, where he went, I did\nnot know where he went. Or how he went, I didn't know either.",
        "Q: So, let's go back. Let me step back a little bit before. From the period of the\nbombing, that's September '39, and then the ghetto was the next summer.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, that in\u2014between stage, was your father able to work? Were you able to do\nanything \u2014\u2014\u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014\u2014 or life pretty much stopped?",
        "A: No. My father didn't work nothing. He helped out a little bit in the bakery with my\ngrandmA: My grandma had a big bakery. She used to bake the bread and the cakes,\neverything for about \u2014\u2014 for the whole town, the whole ghetto used to go to my\ngrandmother. So, my father used to help them out. Then they took him away. I was in\nthe street, because I was not used to stay with the Jewish kids. I played outside. I hada\nspecial soccer ball my father gave me, so I played with the Polish kids in the street, and I\nwas very popular with the Polish kids because I played a lot of soccer. We went to the\nschool backyard playing because there was no school. At that time, there was noschools,\nnothing. So, everybody was free. You did whatever you could. Then they established a\nghetto. When they established the ghetto, they took away my father. I don't know where\nthey took him, but they took him away. I don't know where he got to.",
        "Q: Do you remember the day your father was taken away? Was it SS who took\nhim? Did you witness it?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Or just, one day, your father was \u2014\u2014",
        "A: No. I was in the street that time. I remember when they took out the men, the\nmen. They took out the men, and they make three lines. And the women on one side,\nthat they SS men was standing on top, on spokes. There was a pharmacy there. I\nremember now that the names from the street was \u2019Schutzki? 22, was a pharmacy,\none pharmacy in all of Shedlitz. And the guy was saying, all the men go to the left, the\nwomen be kept in the middle and with the young girls, and down the \u2014\u2014 the teenagers\nwere kept to the right. And that's how we were sorted. And then I saw they took away\nmy father. I heard from one of the SS soldiers where they take him to Sokolow, on a\nsoccer \u2014\u2014\u2014 on a soccer stadium. Where you think they kept the people? In the soccer\nstadium. And that's how they stood there for a week, two. And after this, I don't know\nwhere they shipped \u2014\u2014- where they took him.",
        "Q: So \u2014\u2014",
        "A: At that time, I didn't know where he is.",
        "Q: So, after your father left \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014\u2014 you were left alone in the ghetto with your mother \u2014\u2014",
        "A: And my brother.",
        "Q: And were the other relatives, were you uncles also taken away?",
        "A: No. My uncle was sick because he was in the farming, he was injured. So, his wife\ndied and the two girls died because, you know, they had no \u2014\u2014 they had no medications\nfrom infection. They all died. And they \u2014\u2014all the kids in the ghetto, it was\nterrible. They had no medications for them, so they were dying like flies. And in the\nghetto was bad, bad. And then they took me \u2014\u2014 I was assigned from the Utenrod\n(ph) to go, as a teenager, they needed me for the German soldiers, for the cavalmitz\n(ph), as they called it, for the barracks, to clean and to bring down the mattresses, the\nblankets, and to take down. So, they used to keep us for a whole day, and then at night\nwe used to go home, and in the morning we had to come again.",
        "Q: And were you escorted by policemen to your place of work, or were you just able to",
        "A: No, they took us. When we stood outside \u2014\u2014 they told us how many kids to pull\nout, you know, the Utenrod (ph). So, they came with a truck, and they took us to the\ncavalmitz (ph), to the barracks, when we worked. From the barracks, coming back, we\ndid not go by truck. They told us to walk.",
        "Q: And when you were walking, were you able to contact the Poles in the\ncommunity? Or \u2014\u2014",
        "A: No. We walked freely. They came. We walked into the \u2014\u2014 sometimes they used to\nbeat you up if they know that you're Jewish, you know, they used to beat you up in the\nstreets. To a park, you couldn't go. You couldn't go to swim. You couldn't do\nanything. The only thing you were \u2014\u2014 like a prisoner. But I, most of the time, used to\nrun out from the because I used to play with the kids in the street. I was a street\nkid. So, I used to play. And they know me. In that time, you know, the teenagers were\nnot anti\u2014semitic. When it came after age 15, 16, you know, the old teenagers, they\nhated you. They killed you. They took you to the Germans to sell you for two pound of\nsalt, two pounds of sugar. But the teenagers at 12, 13 years old, they didn't know so\nmuch about anti\u2014semitics. They were educated in the churches, they used to teach.",
        "Q: And did you have to wear any identifying badge?",
        "A: I used to wear, but I used to take it off when I went out on the street.",
        "Q: Was it an arm band or a star?",
        "A: Arm band.",
        "Q: And you just took it off?",
        "A: I took it off. I used to take it off and keep it in my pocket because I know that the kids\nnot going to say anything because they needed my soccer ball to play ball with. And\nthat's how we were in the ghetto. It was terrible living in the ghetto, because it was no\nfood, nothing. People used to get sick. And the tanks used to run day and night. And the\nSS used to come in and check the apartment once in a while to see if there's any men\nhiding out. So, they used to look under the bed and this, but when they saw kids with\nwomen only, they still didn't believe it. They used to ask you, Where's your\nhusband? Where's your father? So, we told them, they took them out already a couple\nmonths ago. But they still used to come and check.",
        "Q: Now, let's go back to you working in the SS kaserne. Can you describe sort of the\ntypical day? And I understand that at some point you stopped working there, so can you\ndescribe that a bit?",
        "A: Yeah. When I came to work there, I worked there for a while, because right, because\nwe used to run up and down the steps because there was no elevators, so we had to carry\nthe mattresses out, the blankets. And then we used to change the linens. And downstairs\nwas the laundry. So, when they cleaned that out, we had to bring up the fresh stuff\nupstairs. And then when we're finished with this, they used to clean the streets, the\ntoilets. We used to sweep, you know, the gutters. And that's how we worked there for a\nlong time. I would say I worked there for close to a year. And one day, I was playing\naround with the kids, and I was laughing, so the SS men thought I'm laughing from him,\nso he run over to me with a rifle with a corbet (ph) they called it the end side, and\nhit me in my head. He hit me in the head, and I fell down on the floor. I thought I was\ngoing to die. After this, I stood up. I went home. And I said to my mother I'm not going\nafter this. They could kill me. After this, I didn't go back to work because I worked\nmore than | \u2014\u2014\u2014 it was already '42.",
        "Q: And you mother and your brother, were they working also?",

So, she wasn't \u2014\n\u2014a housewife. There was no food. The only food I got when I used to go \u2014\u2014 sorry. I\nused to go to my grandma, to the bakery. I used to take some bread, you know. So, that's\nhow I used to meet them, when I used to go pick up the food. I used to pick up\nbecause he was delivering , you know, the wood, the eggs, you know, the milk, he\nused to bring it.",
        "Q: Was your mother's bakery inside \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Not my mother's.",
        "Q: I mean, your grandmother's, inside the ghetto boundaries?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. She was the only baker. She worked to the last minute, she had that\nbakery. And the last minute they took her, Yom Kippur day, and the trucks, and they\nfinished them off then.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: ~\u2014 he could come freely into the ghetto. Were there other Poles who were coming\ninto the ghetto?",

And he used to bring in the\nwood. And he used to bring in all that stuff. They way then, they used to give him\nflour. They used to pay him. She used to clean the bakeries down. And then, that's how\nI used to meet him and talk to him.Down to the last minute, when \u2014\u2014\u2014 before I made a\ndecision to go, I spoke to him, and I told him this and this time, you know, in the ghetto, I\ncouldn't take it no more. So, I told my mother, when I came in from the street, and I\nheard Yom Kippur day, going to be the liquidation of the ghetto. So, I came in and I told\nmy mother. So, my uncle says, Don't listen to him. You have a bed for to sleep. They're\ngoing to kill you. How do you want to sleep in the street? It's cold. You have no\nfood. You have no money. Nothing. kid. This is the time to leave, because they\nwant to kill us, because \u2014\u2014 don't you see what's going on? All the young SS and the\nstorm troopers went to the battlefield. They took them out. So, at that time, wasn't so\nbad in the street, because you had just the occupation force. And the occupation force\nwas old guys, like 40 years, 45, that were not so bad, you know what I mean? They\nsympathize. Some of the sympathize, you know. They knew what's going to happen. So,\nthat's how I find out. I'm going to \u2014\u2014 I told my mother the whole story, you go or\nnot.

They only\nthing they used to tell them in \u2014\u2014 the Utenrod (ph) said, Tomorrow, when a thousand\npeople would go to the station, the trains are going to wait for you. Where you're\ngoing? To a better place, to work, you have better facilities to live, and you'll have a\nbetter life. That's how they used to go. And the minute you came on the station, you were\nfinished. They put you in the wagons. They closed up, and they took you Plansber (ph),\nwhere you get transport that was going to Treblinka, Majdanek.",
        "Q: So \u2014\u2014",

But we looked different because we were raised 1n a Polish\ntown at that time, Aleksandrow Kujawski. We lived in, as all Polacks did. So, that's why\nwe didn't look like the typical Jews. So, we decided, told him we were going to meet him\nat this and this place, and he was waiting for us there.",
        "Q: How did you leave the ghetto?",
        "A: The ghetto, went out through the back, yes, through the back. We got really \u2014\u2014 we\nwent out through the back, and we sneaked out. You know, it was a rainy day, a\nrainy day. So, it was just good for us. It was, I would say, around 5, 6 o'clock at night.",

        "A: So, he says, I'll take you. But I have to make sure that, you know \u2014\u2014 that's why he\ntook you at night, because it was dark. So, he'll come, it will be dark. I will take you in\nthere. But, remember, he says, you cannot stay in the house for the time because I'm\nafraid, because nobody should find out. But it was a good location, so it was \u2014\u2014 it was\nacross the street from a church. His house was the last house at the end of the small\ntown, you know, of the village, the end of the road. And one side to the other side was\nthe church. So, not too many Nazis, not too many soldiers used to come to check them.",
        "Q: How far away from Shedlitz was it?",
        "A: I couldn't tell you. We went about two and a half hours.",
        "Q: And what was the name of the man and his wife?",
        "A: His name was Wladek, and his wife's name was StasA:",
        "Q: And about how old were they?",
        "A: Oh, they were old. Oh, how do you know, in Poland, how old they are because a\nperson 65 was how many died. There was no medication, nothing. He was very\nold. She's special \u2014\u2014 they were very old but very nice. Very nice. Because, you\nknow \u2014\u2014 but they were so scared. God forbid, 1f somebody finds out that I hide Jews,\nthey going to say you are a Jew lover, they're going to burn my house.",
        "Q: And describe your sleeping quarters.",
        "A: The sleeping quarters was not bad. But it was terrible because he had to hide us\ncertain places in case, you know, you see somebody walking or something, we had to\nsneak out for the \u2014\u2014 you know, the \u2014\u2014 on a small town, how the rooms are? We\nslept over on a floor, on the floor, but we had \u2014\u2014 you know, like, put down like straw,\nin plenty time, if he found out that somebody was going to come to check the small town,\nthe soldiers were going to come, the Germans, or pass by, so he kept us 1n the barn, you\nknow. He has chickens and had a few goats, you know, from milk he used to got. And\nthere were chickens. He had about 50 chickens maybe. And then he had one cow. And\nhe had two horses. So, we kept us there. Plenty of times we had to go in there to stay, but\nin the summertime, I didn't mind staying there. You know why? Because it was better\nthan in the house, you know.",
        "Q: I understand there were woods outside. How much time were you \u2014\u2014",
        "A: In the woods.",
        "Q: \u2014 out doors?",
        "A: It was a very good location, the woods, because his whole backyard was woods and\nswamps, so, in the summertime, we used to go to the woods and stay there. We used to\nenjoy ourselves because it was fresh air. You didn't have to sit in one place, you know,\nbecause she used to look out through the window to see if anybody's coming, God forbid,\nSO we used to sneak out and stay in the wood. And then, if it was rainy or bad weather,\nwe used to come back. So, he used to tell us when it's safe to come back.",
        "Q: What was the signal to know whether it was safe or not?",
        "A: Used to put on a few bricks there, you know, stone. If you put down, let's say, like\nthree, four bricks, one on top of the other, that means it was safe. And \u2014\u2014\u2014 but most of\nthe time it was safe. I'll tell you why, because it was the last house, and not too many\nsoldiers, Germans, came that time, because they were busy with the Russian front. So,\nthey, maybe, since I was there, hiding, for the two years, maybe once or twice, I'd say, I\nheard them talking that they came to check the town, but they never came there.",
        "Q: And did the neighbors ever stop by unexpectedly?",
        "A: No, because people \u2014\u2014 I told you, in our location \u2014\u2014 first of all, they didn't bother\nwith anybody. They were old people. They didn't have no children, which was the favor\nfor us, because otherwise they were afraid for their children or their grandchildren, and\nthey got rid of the dog. Why? Because the dogs used to bark, you know. So, he got rid\nof the dog, and he kept us there. He always begged us, even in they capture \u2014\u2014 they'll\ncapture you or they'll find out about you, don't tell them that I saved you. Don't tell them\nthat I kept you here. Just tell them, by mistake, you went in here from the woods.",
        "Q: And did you ever see any other Jews hiding in either the woods or \u2014\u2014",
        "A: No. No. No. Nobody was in that village except us. Because this was a village, you\nknow, with a lot of farmers. I mean, 1t was 1n our favor because they were not a village\nwhich was one house on top of the other. It was scattered around. Let's say \u2014\u2014 I'll give\nyou an example, there's 50 homes or something. It was far away, one house from the\nother. And his location was in the woods, the last one by the woods, by the\nswamps. And he was across the street from the church, and nobody ever came to him.",
        "Q: And during the time you were in hiding, did he bring you any news? Did you have\nany idea what was going on?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, always news. Because he was more interested about the news than\nI did, because he wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible. He told us that, you know,\nwhen \u2014\u2014 how he did, the Russians were coming close to this, that only says, Do me a\nfavor, when the Russian comes, don't run out, in case the Russians come into that\nvillage. Wait 'til I'll tell you. Because he used to go to town and sell something, you\nknow, little woods. He used to make little bundles of wood and sell it in town.",
        "Q: Did he ever tell you what happened to the Jews in Shedlitz?",
        "A: Oh, yes. He told me.",
        "Q: What did he tell you?",
        "A: He told us that when it was the liquidation in the ghetto, he told us exactly. And he\ntold us what they did with them. He said he was sure \u2014\u2014 what you have the pictures\nthere \u2014\u2014\u2014 they dig ditches and they throw them in and then burn them, the one which\nthey couldn't take, the last minute, to Majdanek and TreblinkA: They burned them. He\nsaid he know that some of them escaped. Where they are, he doesn't know. He knows\nthat some of them stayed with the Polish girls, they say. And then, when he came to the\nlast time to tell us that the Russian are all ready in Shedlitz. He told us that he saw a few\nguys there. But he says, Don't say to any of these people where you stood. Because he\nwas afraid, he was so scared because the Polacks were terrible. So, when he came \u2014\u2014\u2014\nwhen he told us that the Russians came, we went out there at night, also, that nobody\nshould see that, you know, stood there. And we went to Shedlitz. He told us where the\ncommittee is with the survivors. So, we went straight there. And we were not \u2014\u2014 and\nthe door, they were afraid to open up. They thought, who was there? They thought\nmaybe the Polacks come to kill them. So, in Shedlitz, we didn't stay too long.",
        "Q: Let me just step back on to liberation day.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you see any soldiers when you were in your hiding place, or you just heard from\nhim that he said he heard they were liberated and \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Exactly. Yeah. He said, they didn't come to this small town, the Russians. They\ndidn't want to get killed, because they were afraid, 1n case the \u2014\u2014\u2014 because the Polish\narmy, they had underground. They were against the Russians, you know. They didn't\nwant to surrender even voluntary. I remember the and . They were fighting\nfor a year there. So, they were afraid. So, the Russians we didn't see come to town. He\njust told us that the Russians were in Shedlitz.",
        "Q: And how did you get back to Shedlitz? Did you walk?",
        "A: We walked. We walked. It took us about two and a half, three hours.",
        "Q: And \u2014\u2014",
        "A: We have nothing with us, so it was easy to walk.",
        "Q: Did you see anybody on the road back?",
        "A: We saw somebody, but they didn't really \u2014\u2014 we didn't really pay attention to\nthem. They didn't really knew the situation because they know all the Jews were killed,\nso how did they expect? They didn't expect. But that was when they came \u2014\u2014 when\nwe came to Shedlitz, the people in Shedlitz, the guys, they all had weapons, gun,\ngrenades, so they gave us already. They gave us \u2014\u2014",
        "Q: The Jews were back in Shedlitz?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. There were some Jews already in Shedlitz. I would say about fifty or\nthat. They all had weapons.",
        "Q: Were these people you knew from before the war?",
        "A: Not really, but they know me. They knew who I am, because they know my\nfather. They know my grandmA: But he told me, my grandmother \u2014\u2014 Polack told me\nmy grandmother, up to the last minute with her son, they were baking, with her two\ndaughters. They were, the last minute, sitting in Shedlitz and making money. And what\nthey did with the money, nobody knows.",
        "Q: And so how long did you stay in Shedlitz?",
        "A: Not too long, about \u2014\u2014 I would say, six weeks, eight weeks, approximately, not\nsure, not much. More, more, more. Wait. We took \u2014\u2014 I tell you, the Russians came in\nin '44, end of '44. We stood 'til 45, 'til the war as finished in Shedlitz.",
        "Q: And where did you live?",
        "A: I told you, in the \u2014\u2014 we lived in, like was a , a cloak, you know, before, so\nthey made the \u2014\u2014 living quarters for us. And under the bruhat (ph) came in, they came\nin. They brought us money and food, you know. Was good, was not bad. But we were\nafraid for the Polacks. So, we stood there 'til May, when we heard, in May the 5th, was\nthe end of war. And May the 19th was the capitulation, the Germans signed for \u2014\u2014\nfrom Keitel, the , and Zhukov . And the Russians were good to us. The\nRussians gave us food. They gave us a gun, whatever you need, and they gave us\nblankets. They were very good. The Russians were very good to survivors.",
        "Q: I want to ask you two other questions when you were still in Shedlitz. One is that I\nunderstand you went back and visited your old home.",
        "A: Not right away.",
        "Q: Talk about when did you come back and describe what happened.",
        "A: I went back to the home, let's say, beginning of '45. The guys didn't tell me to go right\naway. And they told me not to go by myself. I took two \u2014\u2014 there was a lot of Jewish\nRussian soldiers. I went to a Russian captain, but otherwise they'll think that you come to\ntake revenge on them. So, he went with us, and even we went \u2014\u2014 I knew my grandma\nhad a lot of money hidden someplace, so I went to her house also with a soldier. Nothing\nwas there. But I didn't stay. I was afraid to stay there. In my house, when I walked in\nwith them, they say to me, We did not take any of your furniture. We don't know\nanything about it. All from the small town, and they came, they, like vultures, they\ngrabbed anything that they could, with, you know, with wagons and horses, you\nknow. When the ghetto was taken out, the destruction of the ghetto, what do you think\nhappened the next few days? They came like vultures from all over the Polacks. They\ntold me that, was which I \u2014\u2014 he says to me, You wouldn't believe, that Wladek says to\nme, what they did. They came, like, grabbing everything which was not nailed down.",
        "Q: So, when you went in your old house, were the people there using your old\nfurniture? Was \u2014\u2014",
        "A: No, it was nothing there. There was nothing there. I didn't see any furniture.",
        "Q: And \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Because they were smart. They used to give the furniture away someplace else, and\nthey brought in.",
        "Q: And so did you find anything that was left behind?",
        "A: No. That's all. I find some \u2014\u2014 a few old things, you know, like my father's tools,\nwas \u2014\u2014 how did I find? Because in the hallway was a closet, with a hole, like \u2014\u2014 like\na \u2014\u2014\u2014 what do you call it, where they used to \u2014\u2014 we used to keep in the wintertime\ncertain foods shouldn't get spoiled, potatoes, cabbage, . It's like a basement but a\nreach down. So, I knew we had something there. What, I didn't know. So, I went down\nthere. I found my father's tools.",
        "Q: And did the Poles say anything when you said, I'm taking these with me?",
        "A: No, they didn't say. They were happy to get rid of me. The minute they saw me on\nthe outer side, I saw they were screaming: I didn't take anything. We didn't do\nanything. Somebody came here and they took everything from here. Because that guy\nwas telling me that. Everything was taken. The minute of the liquidation of the ghetto,\nthey came like vultures, running. You know, they were digging for gold, for everything.\nThey thought the Jews were hiding things in the backyards and in the walls, you know,\nunder the streets, and so they were digging everything to look at, they could find\nsomething.Even they find the truth, they wouldn't touch them. What would they do?",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about who else was living in with you. The other Jews who\nsurvived, did they also survive in hiding? Had any of them come back from\nconcentration camp?",
        "A: No. Most of them was from hiding, which they were hiding out by Polish women, in\n\u2014, you know. In the woods, a few of them survived. Two young kids survived in the\nwoods. They came out with \u2014\u2014 they were \u2014\u2014 you know, you wouldn't believe it how\nthey looked, with guns, with grenades all around. So, they told them, What are you doing\nhere? They're going to kill you. He says, Us, they're not going to kill. We'll kill them\nfirst. They were wild kids, too. And they didn't stay too long in Shedlitz, those two guys.\nThey left the next day. I don't know where they went.",
        "Q: I understand they were registering people, survivors.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Talk about how the registration worked and who was organizing it.",
        "A: There was a committee already in Shedlitz. After a while, they came from all over to\nShedlitz, because a lot of people that came from hiding places. They came from the\nconcentration camp. So, there was a committee. And how they got the money, I don't\nknow. They gave every person, they gave us 1500 Zloty at that time to survive. You\nknow, we should have survive, in case we don't want to stay in Shedlitz. They advised us\nnot to stay, you know. Most of the people, they were advised not to stay in Shedlitz. We\nshould go with a Russian army, where they took, you know, was already occupied from\nthe German territory, when they gave it to Poland, and Stolczyn, Szczecin, all the Jews\narrived. It was coming there, flocks of people. You wouldn't believe it, like, it was\nshowing the Ten Commandments. Jews came from all the side to Szczecin, Stolezyn,\nhundreds of Jews, thousands of them.",
        "Q: And during this period, we're now talking end of '44, beginning of '45, your father was\ntaken in August of '40. Had you heard any rumors about what had happened to him?",
        "A: No. No. No.",
        "Q: You assumed he had died?",
        "A: We didn't know. Yeah. We thought he was dead. Everybody thought everybody's\ndied. When he came to Shedlitz, they told him that we went to Stolczyn.",
        "Q: And describe what the reunion was like with your father.",
        "A: My father \u2014\u2014 my brother recognized him at the station. We used to go to the station\nto see who was going to arrive, because every time a train came, we went to see who's\ngoing to be on that train. So, my brother recognized when he come to the station.",
        "Q: And then he brought him \u2014\u2014\u2014",
        "A: Yeah. We couldn't believe it. But he know that \u2014\u2014 he know that we were alive,\nbecause they told him in Shedlitz, in the committee, that we are alive and we went to\nStolezyn, because most of the people, all the survivors from all the time, from , from\n, from all over, they couldn't stay. They were afraid. So, they all went to\nSzczecin, Stolczyn, and other \u2014\u2014 all the towns which they were liberated, you know,\nfrom the Russians, which they went to this town was good, the was there, with\ncommittees, with food. They give you \u2014\u2014 anything you want, they give you. We were\nlike a new person when we came here.",
        "Q: And your father, did he tell you right away what had happened to him these four\nyears?",
        "A: No. Later on, he told us that. He was mostly \u2014\u2014 I don't know how he wind up\nthere, but Hungarian and Romanian Jews at that + came.",
        "Q: So \u2014\u2014",
        "A: In fact \u2014\u2014",
        "Q: Break off a little bit from the chronology, but what happened to your father during the\nfour years you were apart? After he was rounded up, do you know where he was sent?",
        "A: Yeah. Nordhausen. Over there, he was a \u2014\u2014 he was working in the factory 'til he\nwas liberated.",
        "Q: For four years in Nordhausen?",
        "A: I don't know this. I don't know. I know he was liberated. A lot of Hungarian Jews \u2014\n\u2014 in 1943, '44, that was the end of the war, they brought in a lot of Hungarian Jews to\nthat camp. So, that's how he survived, because most of the Hungarian Jews, they didn't\ntake him in the beginning, because they were all home in Hungary 'til 1943. Then, in '44,\nwhen they shipped them \u2014\u2014\u2014 some of them shipped to Auschwitz. Most of them went to\nAuschwitz, other camps, to the labor camps, you know.",
        "Q: And was it very hard reajusting to a life with your whole family, after having been\nused to being \u2014\u2014\u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014\u2014 on your own\u2019?",
        "A: After the \u2014\u2014 after the way we lived, like animals, all the time in Europe, because, in\nEurope, was a very bad life for the Jews. The Jews didn't have anything. They didn't\nhave no education. They didn't have nothing. Most of the Jews in Europe were\nshoemaker or, what do you call it, a tailor, this, and, you know, and the kids never went\nto school because they didn't have the money to send, and they were afraid to go to Polish\nschools. They only went to the Jewish school, malamitikof (ph), and they were teaching\nthem, you know. And they were never going into the streets. That's why most of these\npeople, I couldn't figure out how they could survive. They couldn't survive because they\nwere not used to a strict life. They were used to living in ghetto all the time. Actually,\nbefore Hitler came into the ghettos, you know, that they were \u2014_\u2014.:~ They never lived\nwith Polacks. They lived with themselves. And that life was terrible The kid didn't even\nknow how to sign his name. He wanted to hide them, and that's it. And in the street, he\ndidn't have a bicycle. He couldn't swim, because he was not allowed to go to swim. He\nwas not allow to go to a park because they killed you. And then they used to tell the kids,\ndon't hit. If a Polish kid hits you or does something to you, don't hit him back, because if\nyou hit him back, they'll come at night and they're dead.",
        "Q: So, when your father came back, you're all together in Stolezyn. And \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Yeah. And then we went \u2014\u2014 I told you, we went right away \u2014\u2014 1n a few months,\nwe went right away to Ziegenhain. When they made it \u2014\u2014 they made the transport to\nGermans to leave to Germany, because the Poles gave them an ultimatum, a date, that\nyou have to leave the houses and everything. That's all you're allowed to take 1s two\nsatchels. And they prepared the trains. You know what kind of trains? Like you had in\nthe Holocaust, trains like that. And then they came to us, and they said to us, you go with\nthem. You know, the Bruhat (ph) came and they said: This is your chance. We want\nyou all to go, all the Jews. They took from Szczecin, Stolezyn, and they said, When the\ntrain comes, go on the train.",
        "Q: How many people were in your group, your Bruhat (ph) group?",
        "A: A lot of, a lot of people, because in Szczecin, Stolczyn, was not only from\nShedlitz. They came from all over, so that \u2014\u2014 I would say a whole wagon. I would say\nabout 150 people, maybe more, and they told us to sit still, mix in the Germans. And\ndon't say anything, because when you pass by the Russian territory, because \u2014\u2014 you\nknow, Germany was divided in four sections. So, the first section we had to pass by, the\nRussian territory, then the French, then the English, and then was American. We didn't go\nto the American, because we were only allowed to go to the English sector. But when \u2014\n\u2014 the first sector was the Russian, when you pass by Russian, the Russian soldiers saw\nthe _, the train, to look whose there, don't say anything. If they talk to you, don't\nanswer. Don't make them look that you understand them. Then, when we arrived in the\nEnglish sector, the Bruhat (ph) was waiting for us, and they took us off, and they all gave\nus clothing and food, and they put us up in German houses. And they kept us there for a\nwhile. And then they took us \u2014\u2014 they came and said, this is the time to leave here,\nbecause we were already free in the English sector. And they took us on the cattle trucks,\nand in the trucks they took us to Ziegenhain. And at Ziegenhain was where we were.",
        "Q: Describe Ziegenhain. What did it look like?",
        "A: Ziegenhain was a regular concentration \u2014\u2014 looks like a concentration camp, because\nit was with barbed wire with a tower where they watch you. What do you call them?",
        "Q: Watch towers?",
        "A: Watch towers. And it was barracks, you know, very poor barracks, was on cinder\nblocks built. Ready\u2014made barracks. They put them on cinder blocks.",
        "Q: What was your reaction? You walked in \u2014\u2014\n[Pause.] {coughing}\nSo, you had just survived the war and walked into someplace and it's surrounded by\nbarbed wired, with a watch tower. What was the first thing that you thought of when you\nsaw that?",
        "A: As soon as we saw all Jewish people, all our uncles, we were happy, because they told\nus it was called at time the UNNRA: You heard that organization? UNNRA: President\nRoosevelt's wife was in charge, was a commissioner. She + to get it, person and\nthoroughly. They're the one which, you know, didn't allow us to come into the United\nStates. After the liberation, I can't figure out why they didn't let us go straight to\nAmerica, why did they have to put us into the DP camp. DP camp was actually \u2014\u2014\nwhat I was talking about, once again?",
        "Q: That's okay. Finish your thought, then we will go back and \u2014\u2014",
        "A: All right. I can't figure out why they didn't let us go straight to America, why they\nhave to throw us into DP camp. DP camps was actually the first person which has no\ncountry, so they put us there. All right. They did the right thing. But they put in the\nNazis \u2014\u2014 you know, I'll tell you the whole story. A lot of Nazis which arrived in\nAmerica, they don't know how they arrived. The ones which working for the Germans in\nthe camps, the Russians, the vice Russians, they worked in the camps, they were killing\nJews. And after the liberation, they were afraid to go back to their country, so that's how\nthey arrived in Germany and to the American sector. They arrived and they opened up\nDP camps for them, too. They put them in DP camps. Actually, they were not DP camps\nfor them, because they're not a displaced person. A displaced person 1s a person without\na country. They had a country. They were traitors. They were afraid to go back because\nStalin would kill them all.",
        "Q: And talk about your life in that Ziegenhain \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Okay. When we came to Ziegenhain, it was good. The many \u2014\u2014 I saw a lot of\nJewish people, our kind, was good. They opened up schools. We opened up a club, the\nkid would sing. They opened up a school for kids. My brother went to school to teach\nhim Hebrew. You know, they were teaching Hebrew because they brought in people\nwhich knew how to speak Hebrew, and they made \u2014\u2014 maybe six kibbutz in there,\nkibbutz draw, kibbutz ,",
        "Q: Did you go outside to these kibbutzes?",
        "A: Yeah. Kibbutz draw. I was with my brother. We stood in the kibbutz. I was a\nkid. What was I going to do with my mother and father when we need to, you know,\nyoung kids. So, we went to kibbutz . They make Saturday night dances. We had a\ngood life. And from America came a lot of clothing, you know, the clothing which they\nthrow into the boxes, and, you know, for the poor people. This is the clothing they used\nto bring us. A whole truck of clothing. Food they gave us, as much as you wanted to eat\nyou had. And they might teach you to cook the food. They gave milk. And they gave\nthe children chocolate they used to bring and everything. It was a beautiful life.",
        "Q: And what were your parents doing while you were busy with the other kids?",
        "A: My mother worked in the kitchen, cooked for the people, but she couldn't cook, you\nknow, and my father, you know, was walking around with the other people, playing\ndominos. They were playing cards. Some of them, you know, working. Some them of\ndidn't work. They took him to work, you know, in the camp because they needed wood\nfor the camp. They needed fixing, painting. They found some work for them. They used\nto be active. But the kids were good. There was schools. There was kibbutz. They had\ndances. They \u2014\u2014 the kids had nights, movies they brought in.",
        "Q: And were you going to school?",
        "A: No. My brother went to school. I was too old to go to school.",
        "Q: And what about the extended family? Did any other \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014\u2014 family come through?",
        "A: Yes. Cousins survived, and they came, also from Shedlitz, but they lived in different\ncamps. They other camps, but one cousin came to Ziegenhain. She lived with a\nlittle boy. So, they lived with us. But we went, later on, and I would found out about my\nmother's \u2014\u2014\u2014 my mother knew that she has relatives in America, two brothers. The\nsister she didn't know because the sister lived in Belgium. The sister survived in\nBelgium, and she went, in 1940, the last ship to AmericA: That's how she arrived in\nAmericA: But we didn't know. So, we were writing to Shedlitz \u2014\u2014 I mean, to\nAmericA: My mother didn't know the address, so we were writing to Brooklyn. She\nknew she has one brother in Brooklyn and one brother in St. Louis, but she didn't know\nwhich is which, so she didn't know the address. So, she put down Brooklyn St. Louis.\nSo, the letter came back and says there's no such a thing in America, Brooklyn St. Louis.\nSo, now we wrote another letter. And they found a Yacovich (ph), a cousin lived in the\nBronx, and that cousin from the Bronx knew about her two brothers and sister, and he\nwent and told them. So, we received a letter from him right away.",
        "Q: And about what year was it that she was able to establish connection were her\nbrothers?",
        "A: In 1947.",
        "Q: And did they offer to sponsor you?",
        "A: They didn't know nothing about sponsors that time, because that time we were\nregistered in Frankfurt to go to AmericA: Because we told the American government we\nhad relatives there. So, that point came out, the quota was closed for the American \u2014\u2014\u2014\nfor the Polish people. Only the German quota was open. They were tricky, because how\nmany German had left on the . So, the Polish quota was closed. So, we were the\nfirst ones on the list. We went to Frankfurt, and they told us, in 1946, you can't go to\nAmericA: You have to wait for quotA: So, we wrote them a letter that we need\nsponsors. So, they send us letters that they were sponsors for us. That's how we\nwent. So, we waited 'til 1948, 'til Truman passed the quota for the Jews, vice president,\nthat you could go to America or England or wherever you have sponsors. So, that's how\nwe went, in 1949, beginning of the first months of the quotA: So, we went to\nBremerhaven. And in Bremerhaven, we had to sit for two months, because the weather\nwas bad. We had to wait for army boat, 'til it comes, when the army boat used to come\nwith food and ammunition for the American soldiers, their bases. And the way back,\nthey used to ship, you know, the Holocaust survivors. So, you know, our ship was 1200\npeople going back. It was 200 Holocaust survivors. The rest was all the Nazis which had\nsurvived, working for the Germans.",
        "Q: And was there any interaction between the two groups?",
        "A: No. They kept their mouth shut, because most of them came on false papers. They\ndidn't come under right papers. They get false names, and who do you think was the\nsponsor for them? The churches, from Minnesota, from Detroit. You know they arrive\nhere. They were the sponsors. But, actually, they're \u2014\u2014 a lot of people don't know how\nthey arrived here. But they were called collaborators. They were afraid to go back to\nRussia or to Poland because they worked with the German. Because, in 1946, when they\nstarted the war with Russia, the Second Battalion, you know, the Vlosof, General Vlosov,\nhe surrendered to the Second Army, to the Germans, and he fought against, you know,\nthe Russian army. The same thing when Stalingrad, when there was the battle for\nStalingrad, you know, they send in from Romania, from Hungary, you know, armies to\nfight, and Italy, you know, they fought. And in 1943, the battle for Stalingrad, that was\nthe biggest battle. After that battle, you know, the Germans weren't done. In 1944, that\nwas the finish of them.",
        "Q: So, to return to your story, so, from Bremerhaven, you took this ship \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014\u2014 with the Nazi collaborators \u2014\u2014",

        "A: Yeah. My father's parents were bakers in Shedlitz. And he was born in 1900, also\nMarch the 23rd. But he didn't like the family because they were too religious for him, so\nwhen he grew up, he didn't want to be a baker, so he became a shoemaker. In 1923, he\nwas trying to avoid the Polish army, he went to Berlin, and he worked in Berlin for four\nor five years, approximately, as a shoemaker. He was making fancy shoes there. After \u2014\n\u2014 in 1928, he came back to Poland, and he married my mother. And I was born in\n1928. After 1928, I was one years old, my father didn't like living in Shedlitz, so we\nmoved to Aleksandrow Kujawski. This was not far. It's in Poland and . The reason\nhe moved there, because they found out over here he could make a nice living making\nshoes and selling them to people that was from Poland. So, when I came there, I was one\nyears old. My father started a business \u2014 well, actually, a Polish lady, because\nhe was in business with my mother, making the shoes and selling them. So, I was right\nbehind most of the time, and I spoke Polish. We lived there 'til 1938. In 1938, after the\nKristallnacht, most of the people were living \u2014\u2014 there was only 150, 200 Jews, not too\nmany Jews living there. Most of them were Polk Deutsche living there. 1938 became\nvery bad for us, so we had to leave Aleksandrow, and we went back to Shedlitz, came to\nShedlitz. So, my father's went to work for a sports factory. They were making sport\nshoes for skiing, ice skating, and soccer, and soccer balls.",
        "A: I had the same education like I had in Aleksandrow, because I was not used to Jewish\nlife, because most of the Jewish kids lived, like, in a ghetto. They had to go to Jewish\nschools. They didn't play with Polish kids. They were afraid. They were beaten up.\nThey couldn't go to swim. They couldn't ride a bicycle. They couldn't play ball. But I\nwas used to that Polish life, so I registered myself, and I went to a school, to a\nPolish school for a year. In that school, I became very popular because I'm a very good\nsoccer player and a ping\u2014pong player, and a volleyball player. So, they kept me there\ngood. They treated me good. Now, the war broke out in 1939. In 1939, when\nthe war broke out, was terrible. All the \u2014\u2014 half of Shedlitz was bombed. So, all my\nmother's relatives, most of them, got killed.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Sure. They moved in before the ghetto, because they have no place left to live, so\nthey slept in my house, over there. We slept on the floor. We slept on couches, because\nthere was no mattresses in Europe. In Europe, a mattress was straw and a sack. That was\nyour mattress. And in the ghetto, when it started, the ghetto, they took away all the men\nright away, they took away. So, they took my father away, too. So, where he went, I did\nnot know where he went. Or how he went, I didn't know either.",

She used to bake the bread and the cakes,\neverything for about \u2014\u2014 for the whole town, the whole ghetto used to go to my\ngrandmother. So, my father used to help them out. Then they took him away. I was in\nthe street, because I was not used to stay with the Jewish kids. I played outside. I hada\nspecial soccer ball my father gave me, so I played with the Polish kids in the street, and I\nwas very popular with the Polish kids because I played a lot of soccer. We went to the\nschool backyard playing because there was no school. At that time, there was noschools,\nnothing. So, everybody was free. You did whatever you could. Then they established a\nghetto. When they established the ghetto, they took away my father. I don't know where\nthey took him, but they took him away. I don't know where he got to.",
        "A: Yes.",

I\nremember now that the names from the street was \u2019Schutzki? 22, was a pharmacy,\none pharmacy in all of Shedlitz. And the guy was saying, all the men go to the left, the\nwomen be kept in the middle and with the young girls, and down the \u2014\u2014 the teenagers\nwere kept to the right. And that's how we were sorted. And then I saw they took away\nmy father. I heard from one of the SS soldiers where they take him to Sokolow, on a\nsoccer \u2014\u2014\u2014 on a soccer stadium. Where you think they kept the people? In the soccer\nstadium. And that's how they stood there for a week, two. And after this, I don't know\nwhere they shipped \u2014\u2014- where they took him.",

And they \u2014\u2014all the kids in the ghetto, it was\nterrible. They had no medications for them, so they were dying like flies. And in the\nghetto was bad, bad. And then they took me \u2014\u2014 I was assigned from the Utenrod\n(ph) to go, as a teenager, they needed me for the German soldiers, for the cavalmitz\n(ph), as they called it, for the barracks, to clean and to bring down the mattresses, the\nblankets, and to take down. So, they used to keep us for a whole day, and then at night\nwe used to go home, and in the morning we had to come again.",
        "A: No, they took us. When we stood outside \u2014\u2014 they told us how many kids to pull\nout, you know, the Utenrod (ph). So, they came with a truck, and they took us to the\ncavalmitz (ph), to the barracks, when we worked. From the barracks, coming back, we\ndid not go by truck. They told us to walk.",
        "A: No. We walked freely. They came. We walked into the \u2014\u2014 sometimes they used to\nbeat you up if they know that you're Jewish, you know, they used to beat you up in the\nstreets. To a park, you couldn't go. You couldn't go to swim. You couldn't do\nanything. The only thing you were \u2014\u2014 like a prisoner. But I, most of the time, used to\nrun out from the because I used to play with the kids in the street. I was a street\nkid. So, I used to play. And they know me. In that time, you know, the teenagers were\nnot anti\u2014semitic. When it came after age 15, 16, you know, the old teenagers, they\nhated you. They killed you. They took you to the Germans to sell you for two pound of\nsalt, two pounds of sugar. But the teenagers at 12, 13 years old, they didn't know so\nmuch about anti\u2014semitics. They were educated in the churches, they used to teach.",
        "A: I used to wear, but I used to take it off when I went out on the street.",
        "A: Arm band.",
        "A: I took it off. I used to take it off and keep it in my pocket because I know that the kids\nnot going to say anything because they needed my soccer ball to play ball with. And\nthat's how we were in the ghetto. It was terrible living in the ghetto, because it was no\nfood, nothing. People used to get sick. And the tanks used to run day and night. And the\nSS used to come in and check the apartment once in a while to see if there's any men\nhiding out. So, they used to look under the bed and this, but when they saw kids with\nwomen only, they still didn't believe it. They used to ask you, Where's your\nhusband? Where's your father? So, we told them, they took them out already a couple\nmonths ago. But they still used to come and check.",
        "A: Yeah. When I came to work there, I worked there for a while, because right, because\nwe used to run up and down the steps because there was no elevators, so we had to carry\nthe mattresses out, the blankets. And then we used to change the linens. And downstairs\nwas the laundry. So, when they cleaned that out, we had to bring up the fresh stuff\nupstairs. And then when we're finished with this, they used to clean the streets, the\ntoilets. We used to sweep, you know, the gutters. And that's how we worked there for a\nlong time. I would say I worked there for close to a year. And one day, I was playing\naround with the kids, and I was laughing, so the SS men thought I'm laughing from him,\nso he run over to me with a rifle with a corbet (ph) they called it the end side, and\nhit me in my head. He hit me in the head, and I fell down on the floor. I thought I was\ngoing to die. After this, I stood up. I went home. And I said to my mother I'm not going\nafter this. They could kill me. After this, I didn't go back to work because I worked\nmore than | \u2014\u2014\u2014 it was already '42.",
        "A: No. My brother was helping in the ghetto, working there, you know. And my mother,\nwhat can she do? She couldn't do anything. She couldn't do anything. So, she wasn't \u2014\n\u2014a housewife. There was no food. The only food I got when I used to go \u2014\u2014 sorry. I\nused to go to my grandma, to the bakery. I used to take some bread, you know. So, that's\nhow I used to meet them, when I used to go pick up the food. I used to pick up\nbecause he was delivering , you know, the wood, the eggs, you know, the milk, he\nused to bring it.",
        "A: Not my mother's.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. She was the only baker. She worked to the last minute, she had that\nbakery. And the last minute they took her, Yom Kippur day, and the trucks, and they\nfinished them off then.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, not really. Only he came in because he used to bring wood or \u2014\u2014 and this. And\nhe used to \u2014\u2014 he had a wagon, you know, with a horse. And he used to bring in the\nwood. And he used to bring in all that stuff. They way then, they used to give him\nflour. They used to pay him. She used to clean the bakeries down. And then, that's how\nI used to meet him and talk to him.Down to the last minute, when \u2014\u2014\u2014 before I made a\ndecision to go, I spoke to him, and I told him this and this time, you know, in the ghetto, I\ncouldn't take it no more. So, I told my mother, when I came in from the street, and I\nheard Yom Kippur day, going to be the liquidation of the ghetto. So, I came in and I told\nmy mother. So, my uncle says, Don't listen to him. You have a bed for to sleep. They're\ngoing to kill you. How do you want to sleep in the street? It's cold. You have no\nfood. You have no money. Nothing. kid. This is the time to leave, because they\nwant to kill us, because \u2014\u2014 don't you see what's going on? All the young SS and the\nstorm troopers went to the battlefield. They took them out. So, at that time, wasn't so\nbad in the street, because you had just the occupation force. And the occupation force\nwas old guys, like 40 years, 45, that were not so bad, you know what I mean? They\nsympathize. Some of the sympathize, you know. They knew what's going to happen. So,\nthat's how I find out. I'm going to \u2014\u2014 I told my mother the whole story, you go or\nnot. If not, I'm going to him. I spoke with him. I said \u2014\u2014 and he says it's all right, I\ncould go.",
        "A: No, no. They didn't know Treblinka, and they didn't know Majdanek. They only\nthing they used to tell them in \u2014\u2014 the Utenrod (ph) said, Tomorrow, when a thousand\npeople would go to the station, the trains are going to wait for you. Where you're\ngoing? To a better place, to work, you have better facilities to live, and you'll have a\nbetter life. That's how they used to go. And the minute you came on the station, you were\nfinished. They put you in the wagons. They closed up, and they took you Plansber (ph),\nwhere you get transport that was going to Treblinka, Majdanek.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: You want me to pause?",
        "A: Nobody knew about TreblinkA: They said it was a sickness. They take you to a\nbetter field.\n| Pause. |\nNice Wladek. Wladek was in love with her. He was telling her that this is the time. You\nhave to run away from the ghetto, because in two weeks, it's going to be Yom Kippur\nday. He said, I know, a hundred percent, it's going to be the liquidation from the ghetto.",
        "A: She had no choice. My mother didn't want to go either, because my uncle, you know,\nhe talks her out of it. So, my mother says, I have to go with him, otherwise he's going by\nhimself.",
        "A: He was a kid, a little kid. He was only, you know, a couple years old. He was \u2014\u2014\nhe was seven years old.",
        "A: No. Nobody saw us, because we \u2014\u2014 my mother \u2014\u2014 and you'll see the picture \u2014\n\u2014 my brother, we all \u2014\u2014 we didn't look like the typical Jews, because typical Jews,\nthey could recognize you. But we looked different because we were raised 1n a Polish\ntown at that time, Aleksandrow Kujawski. We lived in, as all Polacks did. So, that's why\nwe didn't look like the typical Jews. So, we decided, told him we were going to meet him\nat this and this place, and he was waiting for us there.",
        "A: The ghetto, went out through the back, yes, through the back. We got really \u2014\u2014 we\nwent out through the back, and we sneaked out. You know, it was a rainy day, a\nrainy day. So, it was just good for us. It was, I would say, around 5, 6 o'clock at night.",
        "A: He was waiting for you. So, my mother says, how do you know \u2014\u2014 my uncle says\nto her, How do you know he's not going to kill you? I said, What are you talking\nabout? He works for my grandma, and he likes me. He told me to come. I went with\nhim plenty of times + took me to his house, and I stood with him there.",
        "A: So, he says, I'll take you. But I have to make sure that, you know \u2014\u2014 that's why he\ntook you at night, because it was dark. So, he'll come, it will be dark. I will take you in\nthere. But, remember, he says, you cannot stay in the house for the time because I'm\nafraid, because nobody should find out. But it was a good location, so it was \u2014\u2014 it was\nacross the street from a church. His house was the last house at the end of the small\ntown, you know, of the village, the end of the road. And one side to the other side was\nthe church. So, not too many Nazis, not too many soldiers used to come to check them.",
        "A: I couldn't tell you. We went about two and a half hours.",
        "A: His name was Wladek, and his wife's name was StasA:",
        "A: Oh, they were old. Oh, how do you know, in Poland, how old they are because a\nperson 65 was how many died. There was no medication, nothing. He was very\nold. She's special \u2014\u2014 they were very old but very nice. Very nice. Because, you\nknow \u2014\u2014 but they were so scared. God forbid, 1f somebody finds out that I hide Jews,\nthey going to say you are a Jew lover, they're going to burn my house.",
        "A: The sleeping quarters was not bad. But it was terrible because he had to hide us\ncertain places in case, you know, you see somebody walking or something, we had to\nsneak out for the \u2014\u2014 you know, the \u2014\u2014 on a small town, how the rooms are? We\nslept over on a floor, on the floor, but we had \u2014\u2014 you know, like, put down like straw,\nin plenty time, if he found out that somebody was going to come to check the small town,\nthe soldiers were going to come, the Germans, or pass by, so he kept us 1n the barn, you\nknow. He has chickens and had a few goats, you know, from milk he used to got. And\nthere were chickens. He had about 50 chickens maybe. And then he had one cow. And\nhe had two horses. So, we kept us there. Plenty of times we had to go in there to stay, but\nin the summertime, I didn't mind staying there. You know why? Because it was better\nthan in the house, you know.",
        "A: In the woods.",
        "A: It was a very good location, the woods, because his whole backyard was woods and\nswamps, so, in the summertime, we used to go to the woods and stay there. We used to\nenjoy ourselves because it was fresh air. You didn't have to sit in one place, you know,\nbecause she used to look out through the window to see if anybody's coming, God forbid,\nSO we used to sneak out and stay in the wood. And then, if it was rainy or bad weather,\nwe used to come back. So, he used to tell us when it's safe to come back.",
        "A: Used to put on a few bricks there, you know, stone. If you put down, let's say, like\nthree, four bricks, one on top of the other, that means it was safe. And \u2014\u2014\u2014 but most of\nthe time it was safe. I'll tell you why, because it was the last house, and not too many\nsoldiers, Germans, came that time, because they were busy with the Russian front. So,\nthey, maybe, since I was there, hiding, for the two years, maybe once or twice, I'd say, I\nheard them talking that they came to check the town, but they never came there.",
        "A: No, because people \u2014\u2014 I told you, in our location \u2014\u2014 first of all, they didn't bother\nwith anybody. They were old people. They didn't have no children, which was the favor\nfor us, because otherwise they were afraid for their children or their grandchildren, and\nthey got rid of the dog. Why? Because the dogs used to bark, you know. So, he got rid\nof the dog, and he kept us there. He always begged us, even in they capture \u2014\u2014 they'll\ncapture you or they'll find out about you, don't tell them that I saved you. Don't tell them\nthat I kept you here. Just tell them, by mistake, you went in here from the woods.",
        "A: No. No. No. Nobody was in that village except us. Because this was a village, you\nknow, with a lot of farmers. I mean, 1t was 1n our favor because they were not a village\nwhich was one house on top of the other. It was scattered around. Let's say \u2014\u2014 I'll give\nyou an example, there's 50 homes or something. It was far away, one house from the\nother. And his location was in the woods, the last one by the woods, by the\nswamps. And he was across the street from the church, and nobody ever came to him.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, always news. Because he was more interested about the news than\nI did, because he wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible. He told us that, you know,\nwhen \u2014\u2014 how he did, the Russians were coming close to this, that only says, Do me a\nfavor, when the Russian comes, don't run out, in case the Russians come into that\nvillage. Wait 'til I'll tell you. Because he used to go to town and sell something, you\nknow, little woods. He used to make little bundles of wood and sell it in town.",
        "A: Oh, yes. He told me.",
        "A: He told us that when it was the liquidation in the ghetto, he told us exactly. And he\ntold us what they did with them. He said he was sure \u2014\u2014 what you have the pictures\nthere \u2014\u2014\u2014 they dig ditches and they throw them in and then burn them, the one which\nthey couldn't take, the last minute, to Majdanek and TreblinkA: They burned them. He\nsaid he know that some of them escaped. Where they are, he doesn't know. He knows\nthat some of them stayed with the Polish girls, they say. And then, when he came to the\nlast time to tell us that the Russian are all ready in Shedlitz. He told us that he saw a few\nguys there. But he says, Don't say to any of these people where you stood. Because he\nwas afraid, he was so scared because the Polacks were terrible. So, when he came \u2014\u2014\u2014\nwhen he told us that the Russians came, we went out there at night, also, that nobody\nshould see that, you know, stood there. And we went to Shedlitz. He told us where the\ncommittee is with the survivors. So, we went straight there. And we were not \u2014\u2014 and\nthe door, they were afraid to open up. They thought, who was there? They thought\nmaybe the Polacks come to kill them. So, in Shedlitz, we didn't stay too long.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Exactly. Yeah. He said, they didn't come to this small town, the Russians. They\ndidn't want to get killed, because they were afraid, 1n case the \u2014\u2014\u2014 because the Polish\narmy, they had underground. They were against the Russians, you know. They didn't\nwant to surrender even voluntary. I remember the and . They were fighting\nfor a year there. So, they were afraid. So, the Russians we didn't see come to town. He\njust told us that the Russians were in Shedlitz.",
        "A: We walked. We walked. It took us about two and a half, three hours.",
        "A: We have nothing with us, so it was easy to walk.",
        "A: We saw somebody, but they didn't really \u2014\u2014 we didn't really pay attention to\nthem. They didn't really knew the situation because they know all the Jews were killed,\nso how did they expect? They didn't expect. But that was when they came \u2014\u2014 when\nwe came to Shedlitz, the people in Shedlitz, the guys, they all had weapons, gun,\ngrenades, so they gave us already. They gave us \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. There were some Jews already in Shedlitz. I would say about fifty or\nthat. They all had weapons.",
        "A: Not really, but they know me. They knew who I am, because they know my\nfather. They know my grandmA: But he told me, my grandmother \u2014\u2014 Polack told me\nmy grandmother, up to the last minute with her son, they were baking, with her two\ndaughters. They were, the last minute, sitting in Shedlitz and making money. And what\nthey did with the money, nobody knows.",
        "A: Not too long, about \u2014\u2014 I would say, six weeks, eight weeks, approximately, not\nsure, not much. More, more, more. Wait. We took \u2014\u2014 I tell you, the Russians came in\nin '44, end of '44. We stood 'til 45, 'til the war as finished in Shedlitz.",
        "A: I told you, in the \u2014\u2014 we lived in, like was a , a cloak, you know, before, so\nthey made the \u2014\u2014 living quarters for us. And under the bruhat (ph) came in, they came\nin. They brought us money and food, you know. Was good, was not bad. But we were\nafraid for the Polacks. So, we stood there 'til May, when we heard, in May the 5th, was\nthe end of war. And May the 19th was the capitulation, the Germans signed for \u2014\u2014\nfrom Keitel, the , and Zhukov . And the Russians were good to us. The\nRussians gave us food. They gave us a gun, whatever you need, and they gave us\nblankets. They were very good. The Russians were very good to survivors.",
        "A: Not right away.",
        "A: I went back to the home, let's say, beginning of '45. The guys didn't tell me to go right\naway. And they told me not to go by myself. I took two \u2014\u2014 there was a lot of Jewish\nRussian soldiers. I went to a Russian captain, but otherwise they'll think that you come to\ntake revenge on them. So, he went with us, and even we went \u2014\u2014 I knew my grandma\nhad a lot of money hidden someplace, so I went to her house also with a soldier. Nothing\nwas there. But I didn't stay. I was afraid to stay there. In my house, when I walked in\nwith them, they say to me, We did not take any of your furniture. We don't know\nanything about it. All from the small town, and they came, they, like vultures, they\ngrabbed anything that they could, with, you know, with wagons and horses, you\nknow. When the ghetto was taken out, the destruction of the ghetto, what do you think\nhappened the next few days? They came like vultures from all over the Polacks. They\ntold me that, was which I \u2014\u2014 he says to me, You wouldn't believe, that Wladek says to\nme, what they did. They came, like, grabbing everything which was not nailed down.",
        "A: No, it was nothing there. There was nothing there. I didn't see any furniture.",
        "A: Because they were smart. They used to give the furniture away someplace else, and\nthey brought in.",
        "A: No. That's all. I find some \u2014\u2014 a few old things, you know, like my father's tools,\nwas \u2014\u2014 how did I find? Because in the hallway was a closet, with a hole, like \u2014\u2014 like\na \u2014\u2014\u2014 what do you call it, where they used to \u2014\u2014 we used to keep in the wintertime\ncertain foods shouldn't get spoiled, potatoes, cabbage, . It's like a basement but a\nreach down. So, I knew we had something there. What, I didn't know. So, I went down\nthere. I found my father's tools.",
        "A: No, they didn't say. They were happy to get rid of me. The minute they saw me on\nthe outer side, I saw they were screaming: I didn't take anything. We didn't do\nanything. Somebody came here and they took everything from here. Because that guy\nwas telling me that. Everything was taken. The minute of the liquidation of the ghetto,\nthey came like vultures, running. You know, they were digging for gold, for everything.\nThey thought the Jews were hiding things in the backyards and in the walls, you know,\nunder the streets, and so they were digging everything to look at, they could find\nsomething.Even they find the truth, they wouldn't touch them. What would they do?",
        "A: No. Most of them was from hiding, which they were hiding out by Polish women, in\n\u2014, you know. In the woods, a few of them survived. Two young kids survived in the\nwoods. They came out with \u2014\u2014 they were \u2014\u2014 you know, you wouldn't believe it how\nthey looked, with guns, with grenades all around. So, they told them, What are you doing\nhere? They're going to kill you. He says, Us, they're not going to kill. We'll kill them\nfirst. They were wild kids, too. And they didn't stay too long in Shedlitz, those two guys.\nThey left the next day. I don't know where they went.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: There was a committee already in Shedlitz. After a while, they came from all over to\nShedlitz, because a lot of people that came from hiding places. They came from the\nconcentration camp. So, there was a committee. And how they got the money, I don't\nknow. They gave every person, they gave us 1500 Zloty at that time to survive. You\nknow, we should have survive, in case we don't want to stay in Shedlitz. They advised us\nnot to stay, you know. Most of the people, they were advised not to stay in Shedlitz. We\nshould go with a Russian army, where they took, you know, was already occupied from\nthe German territory, when they gave it to Poland, and Stolczyn, Szczecin, all the Jews\narrived. It was coming there, flocks of people. You wouldn't believe it, like, it was\nshowing the Ten Commandments. Jews came from all the side to Szczecin, Stolezyn,\nhundreds of Jews, thousands of them.",
        "A: No. No. No.",
        "A: We didn't know. Yeah. We thought he was dead. Everybody thought everybody's\ndied. When he came to Shedlitz, they told him that we went to Stolczyn.",
        "A: My father \u2014\u2014 my brother recognized him at the station. We used to go to the station\nto see who was going to arrive, because every time a train came, we went to see who's\ngoing to be on that train. So, my brother recognized when he come to the station.",
        "A: Yeah. We couldn't believe it. But he know that \u2014\u2014 he know that we were alive,\nbecause they told him in Shedlitz, in the committee, that we are alive and we went to\nStolezyn, because most of the people, all the survivors from all the time, from , from\n, from all over, they couldn't stay. They were afraid. So, they all went to\nSzczecin, Stolczyn, and other \u2014\u2014 all the towns which they were liberated, you know,\nfrom the Russians, which they went to this town was good, the was there, with\ncommittees, with food. They give you \u2014\u2014 anything you want, they give you. We were\nlike a new person when we came here.",
        "A: No. Later on, he told us that. He was mostly \u2014\u2014 I don't know how he wind up\nthere, but Hungarian and Romanian Jews at that + came.",
        "A: In fact \u2014\u2014",
        "A: Yeah. Nordhausen. Over there, he was a \u2014\u2014 he was working in the factory 'til he\nwas liberated.",
        "A: I don't know this. I don't know. I know he was liberated. A lot of Hungarian Jews \u2014\n\u2014 in 1943, '44, that was the end of the war, they brought in a lot of Hungarian Jews to\nthat camp. So, that's how he survived, because most of the Hungarian Jews, they didn't\ntake him in the beginning, because they were all home in Hungary 'til 1943. Then, in '44,\nwhen they shipped them \u2014\u2014\u2014 some of them shipped to Auschwitz. Most of them went to\nAuschwitz, other camps, to the labor camps, you know.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: After the \u2014\u2014 after the way we lived, like animals, all the time in Europe, because, in\nEurope, was a very bad life for the Jews. The Jews didn't have anything. They didn't\nhave no education. They didn't have nothing. Most of the Jews in Europe were\nshoemaker or, what do you call it, a tailor, this, and, you know, and the kids never went\nto school because they didn't have the money to send, and they were afraid to go to Polish\nschools. They only went to the Jewish school, malamitikof (ph), and they were teaching\nthem, you know. And they were never going into the streets. That's why most of these\npeople, I couldn't figure out how they could survive. They couldn't survive because they\nwere not used to a strict life. They were used to living in ghetto all the time. Actually,\nbefore Hitler came into the ghettos, you know, that they were \u2014_\u2014.:~ They never lived\nwith Polacks. They lived with themselves. And that life was terrible The kid didn't even\nknow how to sign his name. He wanted to hide them, and that's it. And in the street, he\ndidn't have a bicycle. He couldn't swim, because he was not allowed to go to swim. He\nwas not allow to go to a park because they killed you. And then they used to tell the kids,\ndon't hit. If a Polish kid hits you or does something to you, don't hit him back, because if\nyou hit him back, they'll come at night and they're dead.",
        "A: Yeah. And then we went \u2014\u2014 I told you, we went right away \u2014\u2014 1n a few months,\nwe went right away to Ziegenhain. When they made it \u2014\u2014 they made the transport to\nGermans to leave to Germany, because the Poles gave them an ultimatum, a date, that\nyou have to leave the houses and everything. That's all you're allowed to take 1s two\nsatchels. And they prepared the trains. You know what kind of trains? Like you had in\nthe Holocaust, trains like that. And then they came to us, and they said to us, you go with\nthem. You know, the Bruhat (ph) came and they said: This is your chance. We want\nyou all to go, all the Jews. They took from Szczecin, Stolezyn, and they said, When the\ntrain comes, go on the train.",
        "A: A lot of, a lot of people, because in Szczecin, Stolczyn, was not only from\nShedlitz. They came from all over, so that \u2014\u2014 I would say a whole wagon. I would say\nabout 150 people, maybe more, and they told us to sit still, mix in the Germans. And\ndon't say anything, because when you pass by the Russian territory, because \u2014\u2014 you\nknow, Germany was divided in four sections. So, the first section we had to pass by, the\nRussian territory, then the French, then the English, and then was American. We didn't go\nto the American, because we were only allowed to go to the English sector. But when \u2014\n\u2014 the first sector was the Russian, when you pass by Russian, the Russian soldiers saw\nthe _, the train, to look whose there, don't say anything. If they talk to you, don't\nanswer. Don't make them look that you understand them. Then, when we arrived in the\nEnglish sector, the Bruhat (ph) was waiting for us, and they took us off, and they all gave\nus clothing and food, and they put us up in German houses. And they kept us there for a\nwhile. And then they took us \u2014\u2014 they came and said, this is the time to leave here,\nbecause we were already free in the English sector. And they took us on the cattle trucks,\nand in the trucks they took us to Ziegenhain. And at Ziegenhain was where we were.",
        "A: Ziegenhain was a regular concentration \u2014\u2014 looks like a concentration camp, because\nit was with barbed wire with a tower where they watch you. What do you call them?",
        "A: Watch towers. And it was barracks, you know, very poor barracks, was on cinder\nblocks built. Ready\u2014made barracks. They put them on cinder blocks.\nSo, you had just survived the war and walked into someplace and it's surrounded by\nbarbed wired, with a watch tower. What was the first thing that you thought of when you\nsaw that?",
        "A: As soon as we saw all Jewish people, all our uncles, we were happy, because they told\nus it was called at time the UNNRA: You heard that organization? UNNRA: President\nRoosevelt's wife was in charge, was a commissioner. She + to get it, person and\nthoroughly. They're the one which, you know, didn't allow us to come into the United\nStates. After the liberation, I can't figure out why they didn't let us go straight to\nAmerica, why did they have to put us into the DP camp. DP camp was actually \u2014\u2014\nwhat I was talking about, once again?",
        "A: All right. I can't figure out why they didn't let us go straight to America, why they\nhave to throw us into DP camp. DP camps was actually the first person which has no\ncountry, so they put us there. All right. They did the right thing. But they put in the\nNazis \u2014\u2014 you know, I'll tell you the whole story. A lot of Nazis which arrived in\nAmerica, they don't know how they arrived. The ones which working for the Germans in\nthe camps, the Russians, the vice Russians, they worked in the camps, they were killing\nJews. And after the liberation, they were afraid to go back to their country, so that's how\nthey arrived in Germany and to the American sector. They arrived and they opened up\nDP camps for them, too. They put them in DP camps. Actually, they were not DP camps\nfor them, because they're not a displaced person. A displaced person 1s a person without\na country. They had a country. They were traitors. They were afraid to go back because\nStalin would kill them all.",
        "A: Okay. When we came to Ziegenhain, it was good. The many \u2014\u2014 I saw a lot of\nJewish people, our kind, was good. They opened up schools. We opened up a club, the\nkid would sing. They opened up a school for kids. My brother went to school to teach\nhim Hebrew. You know, they were teaching Hebrew because they brought in people\nwhich knew how to speak Hebrew, and they made \u2014\u2014 maybe six kibbutz in there,\nkibbutz draw, kibbutz ,",
        "A: Yeah. Kibbutz draw. I was with my brother. We stood in the kibbutz. I was a\nkid. What was I going to do with my mother and father when we need to, you know,\nyoung kids. So, we went to kibbutz . They make Saturday night dances. We had a\ngood life. And from America came a lot of clothing, you know, the clothing which they\nthrow into the boxes, and, you know, for the poor people. This is the clothing they used\nto bring us. A whole truck of clothing. Food they gave us, as much as you wanted to eat\nyou had. And they might teach you to cook the food. They gave milk. And they gave\nthe children chocolate they used to bring and everything. It was a beautiful life.",
        "A: My mother worked in the kitchen, cooked for the people, but she couldn't cook, you\nknow, and my father, you know, was walking around with the other people, playing\ndominos. They were playing cards. Some of them, you know, working. Some them of\ndidn't work. They took him to work, you know, in the camp because they needed wood\nfor the camp. They needed fixing, painting. They found some work for them. They used\nto be active. But the kids were good. There was schools. There was kibbutz. They had\ndances. They \u2014\u2014 the kids had nights, movies they brought in.",
        "A: No. My brother went to school. I was too old to go to school.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. Cousins survived, and they came, also from Shedlitz, but they lived in different\ncamps. They other camps, but one cousin came to Ziegenhain. She lived with a\nlittle boy. So, they lived with us. But we went, later on, and I would found out about my\nmother's \u2014\u2014\u2014 my mother knew that she has relatives in America, two brothers. The\nsister she didn't know because the sister lived in Belgium. The sister survived in\nBelgium, and she went, in 1940, the last ship to AmericA: That's how she arrived in\nAmericA: But we didn't know. So, we were writing to Shedlitz \u2014\u2014 I mean, to\nAmericA: My mother didn't know the address, so we were writing to Brooklyn. She\nknew she has one brother in Brooklyn and one brother in St. Louis, but she didn't know\nwhich is which, so she didn't know the address. So, she put down Brooklyn St. Louis.\nSo, the letter came back and says there's no such a thing in America, Brooklyn St. Louis.\nSo, now we wrote another letter. And they found a Yacovich (ph), a cousin lived in the\nBronx, and that cousin from the Bronx knew about her two brothers and sister, and he\nwent and told them. So, we received a letter from him right away.",
        "A: In 1947.",
        "A: They didn't know nothing about sponsors that time, because that time we were\nregistered in Frankfurt to go to AmericA: Because we told the American government we\nhad relatives there. So, that point came out, the quota was closed for the American \u2014\u2014\u2014\nfor the Polish people. Only the German quota was open. They were tricky, because how\nmany German had left on the . So, the Polish quota was closed. So, we were the\nfirst ones on the list. We went to Frankfurt, and they told us, in 1946, you can't go to\nAmericA: You have to wait for quotA: So, we wrote them a letter that we need\nsponsors. So, they send us letters that they were sponsors for us. That's how we\nwent. So, we waited 'til 1948, 'til Truman passed the quota for the Jews, vice president,\nthat you could go to America or England or wherever you have sponsors. So, that's how\nwe went, in 1949, beginning of the first months of the quotA: So, we went to\nBremerhaven. And in Bremerhaven, we had to sit for two months, because the weather\nwas bad. We had to wait for army boat, 'til it comes, when the army boat used to come\nwith food and ammunition for the American soldiers, their bases. And the way back,\nthey used to ship, you know, the Holocaust survivors. So, you know, our ship was 1200\npeople going back. It was 200 Holocaust survivors. The rest was all the Nazis which had\nsurvived, working for the Germans.",
        "A: No. They kept their mouth shut, because most of them came on false papers. They\ndidn't come under right papers. They get false names, and who do you think was the\nsponsor for them? The churches, from Minnesota, from Detroit. You know they arrive\nhere. They were the sponsors. But, actually, they're \u2014\u2014 a lot of people don't know how\nthey arrived here. But they were called collaborators. They were afraid to go back to\nRussia or to Poland because they worked with the German. Because, in 1946, when they\nstarted the war with Russia, the Second Battalion, you know, the Vlosof, General Vlosov,\nhe surrendered to the Second Army, to the Germans, and he fought against, you know,\nthe Russian army. The same thing when Stalingrad, when there was the battle for\nStalingrad, you know, they send in from Romania, from Hungary, you know, armies to\nfight, and Italy, you know, they fought. And in 1943, the battle for Stalingrad, that was\nthe biggest battle. After that battle, you know, the Germans weren't done. In 1944, that\nwas the finish of them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Bremerhaven.",
        "A: It landed in Bremerhaven \u2014\u2014\u2014- Bremen \u2014\u2014\u2014 I mean, from Bremerhaven, it went to\nBoston. Because that ship was from Boston. So, the name for the ship was General\nHaan.",
        "A: No, no, no. The hires, you know, the hires was waiting for us. They took us down,\nand they gave me two dollars, so I went and I bought a sandwich and a Coke. I was\n___+. At night, we went with a train, because they know we don't belong\nthere. Ourrelatives is in New York. So, we went to Pennsylvania Station. At night, we\ncame. We came, our relatives was standing there in a line waiting for us.",
        "A: The last time? That was way before the \u2014\u2014 because they left, like, in 1912.",
        "A: Sure. Over 30 years. The sister she saw 1n 1939, when she came out visiting, '38,\nfrom Belgium, visit. That time \u2014\u2014 they killed them, because all the Jews in Belgium\nwas killed. But she survived. She went to CasablancA: And from Casablanca, 1940 was\nthe last ship going to AmericA: So, she went with that ship, that's how she arrived in\nNew York.",
        "A: We were there for a couple days, then they got us an apartment in New York. They\ngotus an apartment and =~. ~- You know, so, I signed up to go at night to night school\nfrom the Jefferson High School at night. And during the day, I used to go to work, and at\nnight I went to school. So, that's how I worked. I got a job in the milliner at that time, but\nyou didn't make money that time. I started at $12 a week. And then I worked in a few\nplaces. Then I learned a little bit, so I quit, because they abused you. They didn't want to\ngive you money. So, the next job I got I earned $30. So, I worked in the millinery for\n$30. Then I saw the guys that works in there, old timers, with me, and they get \u2014\u2014\u2014 the\npay's 85, and I only get $35. I went over to the guy, and I said, How come you're paying\nme $35 and this guy gets 85? Oh, he says, he is working a long time. I said, But I'm\nproducing more than him. He makes three or four, and I make ten, twelve. So, he says,\nno, no. So, I didn't say nothing. The next day, I left, and I went into another shop. And I\ntold them I liked it in there. And I said, I'm working 1n this and this shop, you know, and\nI'm getting \u2014\u2014\u2014 He says, What are you doing? I says \u2014\u2014 what did the guy used to pay\nyou? I said, He paid me $85. I said, Try me. See how good I am. So, he put me down to\nthe machine, and I started working. He saw the way I work. He says, Ah, you're\nhired. You're getting the pay, $85. So, I worked nights. The guy which I left calls up\nmy mother, and he says, How come your son didn't come to work? She says, Because\nmy son called and told me you abused him. You paid him only $35 or 32, and he got a\njob for $85. Why should he work for you?He says, You know, call your son. She\nsays \u2014\u2014 And let him come back to me. I'll give him the $85. And my mother, she was\na smart cookie. She says, No, no. I know what you want to do. You want to take him\noff the job. He should come back to you and then you're not going to give him the\npay. That's how I remained working for that guy. And I worked there 'til I saved up some\nmoney. I used to make good money there, because I worked \u2014\u2014 at the time they started\nto work on piece work. On piece work, I was making $300 a week, at that time was a lot\nof money. $300 in 1949. But the problem was \u2014\u2014 was sitting work. You didn't work\nthat hard. But then I saved up some money, and I went with a partner of mine. We were\n, and then put ourselves in line. And I bought a out, already I was making\nmoney. Because, at that time, you know, $150 a week, you know, was a lot of money,\nspecial cash. Then I met my wife through introduction.",
