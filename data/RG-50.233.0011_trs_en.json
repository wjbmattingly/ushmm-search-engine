They were very thin, they looked like two girls, they were so\nthin. But they were alive. But they couldn\u2019t take us home because the house was\nbombardiered, the part of it of the apartment, and it was winter.

And then he was so weak he couldn\u2019t do it anymore and he lay\ndown among the dead bodies. Then when the English army came in, the soldiers\ntake his pulse and he said in English because he knew a few words in English,\n23\ndon\u2019t leave me here I am alive, he says in English for the soldier, don\u2019t leave me\nhere, take me in the barracks because I am alive, 6631 1s my number and my\nbrother\u2019s number is 6630.

I took care of my two brothers and we get better. It is a sickness what you\nget from dirt. We had three kinds of lice because there was no hot water, we\ncannot take a bath. It was always the air raid because or the Americans came or\nthe Russians came or the English people came and it was a rebuttal, it was a fight\nand unfortunately a German tank was standing in front of the house with German\nsoldiers and they were firing like crazy for the airplanes. It was impossible to go\nout on the street, mainly for a Jewish. But the water was on the other side of the\nstreet. There was water. And then my brother dressed in my coat and in my hat\nbecause he said if somebody has to be alive then I am the one that has to be alive\nbecause I have to take care of my younger brother. And he went to the other side\nand he brought the water in a big pail.",

But my\nbrother dressed again in my clothing because for a boy it was not so good to go.\nHe dressed like a girl and he stumbled on dead bodies and stones. There were\nmany dead horses on the street and people were eating the horse meat on the\nstreet. And my brother went to the ghetto to visit my grandmother and my aunt\nand they were alive. They were very thin, they looked like two girls, they were so\nthin. But they were alive. But they couldn\u2019t take us home because the house was\nbombardiered, the part of it of the apartment, and it was winter. It was very cold,\nso we had to stay in the orphanage longer time for a few other months. Then my\ntwo brothers went to the orphanage home and just me, I went home with my\ngrandmother. But for a while I went also to the home.\nQ; Were you near the Danube?",
        "A: Yes.",

When I saw a lady sitting on the bench then I -- maybe this is my\nmother, maybe she forgets where she lives or something. But then I get a letter --\nmy mother gets a postcard from a hospital in Budapest and the lady was together\nwith my mother. She saw her. And then a neighbor in my grandmother\u2019s house,\nshe saw her dying.",
        "A: Vilma Mahrer, and this lady, Mrs. Pollack, she was dying and when she was\ndying she said she was together -- she did not want to tell us. But then when she\nwas dying she told us what happened.",

        "A: No, the English army liberated him in Bergen-Belsen. Their job was to carry the\ndead bodies to a big, big grave. That\u2019s what they were supposed to do, by the\nwrist, you know. And then he was so weak he couldn\u2019t do it anymore and he lay\ndown among the dead bodies. Then when the English army came in, the soldiers\ntake his pulse and he said in English because he knew a few words in English,\n23\ndon\u2019t leave me here I am alive, he says in English for the soldier, don\u2019t leave me\nhere, take me in the barracks because I am alive, 6631 1s my number and my\nbrother\u2019s number is 6630. Take a look where he is, find my brother and bring him\ntome. And accidentally my son was born in 1966 April the thirtieth, the same\nnumber what this Gyussi had and therefore he is named Gyussi.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I think it was a big injustice what happened because we were really ordinary\ninnocent people who did not hurt anybody. We did not take nothing from\nanybody and we did not hurt anybody and really it was a big injustice.",
        "A: We have to read them all the stories what people are telling them and if they listen\nto the stories they will believe it. One person can lie, two persons can lie, but so\nmany people cannot lie.",
        "A: Yes, I say that not everybody is a bad person and you have to look in everybody,\nthe nice and the good, and in myself, in my person, I don\u2019t hate anybody.\n24",

I get thyroid problem and I\u2019m on psychiatric care.\nA; Everybody wanted to survive, yes. That\u2019s what it is -- determination.

        "A: Pll tell you something, when my mother was still at home in November, we put\nour ears on the pillow, and we heard the guns and the fighting. It was not too far\nfrom Budapest, already, the Russians were very close. They were really close, we\ncould hear them. Unfortunately they were not close enough and it took time then\nto come.",
