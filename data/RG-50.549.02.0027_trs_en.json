        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Jerry Slivka, conducted on October 22nd, 1998, by Arwin\nDonohue. This is a post Holocaust, follow up interview, to a videotaped interview that\nwas conducted by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with Mr. Slivka on\nJune 16th, 1990. This is tape number one, side A. Before we go on and talk about -- even\nthough this 1s a post Holocaust interview, just say for the record that we\u2019re going to talk\nabout some pre-war and wartime things that weren\u2019t covered in the first interview. And\none of the things that I wanted to know from you has to do with just your very early\nyears, your -- I wanted the names of your family and something about the relationships\nwithin the family. I know you -- you mentioned in the first interview you had two\nbrothers and two sisters.",
        "Answer: Yes.",
        "Q: And their names and their ages relative to you and -- and then also your parents\nnames, and you didn\u2019t say anything about your -- your mother.",
        "A: Well, our family consists of father and mother and two sisters and two brothers and\nmyself, of course. My father\u2019s name, Hebrew name was Eliakim. In Polish, he was\nYakob, which is Jacob, but it\u2019s no -- no connection to the Hebrew name. My mother\u2019s\nname was Rosa -- Raisil in Yiddish, but the Polish name was Rosa.",
        "Q: And her maiden name?",
        "A: Her maiden name was Kirzner. And my brother next to me was Chaim and was born\nin 1917, then we have a sa -- I have the sister, Miriam, who was born 1920. And next\ncame my brother Reuben, who survived the war, still lives in Boston now. And he was\nborn 1922. And had a little sister who was born in 1927. She -- I was 12 years old when\nshe was born.",
        "Q: And her name?",
        "A: And her name was Hannah.",
        "Q: Were you -- and -- were you particularly close with any of your brothers or sisters?",
        "A: We were very close, we were very close, but my problem was that I did not live at --\nwith all of them all the time, because since I lived in a small village and my father wanted\nme to get some kind of education, which started about three years old. I was shipped off\nto the next town, which was about 12 mile -- 12 kilometers from our town, where there\nwas a teacher. As a matter of fact, my father worked there one year as a teacher, after he\nlost his job, which I talked about in the -- on the videotape. And I used to be away from\nthem for awhile. And later on, I was sent to a high school in Koven, which 1s the big city\nnot far from where we lived. And again, I -- I missed my family. I was there only one\nyear. This was my formal education. And then when I was 16, I left town also, to go in\nsearch of a -- learning a professional job in the city of Lodz. And sin -- fr-from then on, I\nwas away for quite a few years, returned about a year or two before the war came. Then a\nyear before the war, I came -- I -- I got married. A son was born. His -- My wife\u2019s name\nwas Rifka. This was in 1938. I omitted it from my videotape. And my son\u2019s name was\nBenjamin -- Benjamin. He -- He -- He lived only three years. He was born in ni -- you\nknow, we were married in 1938, he was born in 1939 and in 1942, in September, a week\nbefore Rosh Hashanah, the 23 days in the month of Ell, Hebrew month, they were all\ntaken out and shot, including my little boy. That\u2019s [indecipherable] was my family.",
        "Q: Where was this?",
        "A: This was in that -- in a village called Povorsk, which we visited two years ago. I think\nmy wife told you about a visit to -- the trip there.",
        "Q: She talked about the trip to Vilno, but didn\u2019t talk about your trip to Povorsk.",
        "A: Yeah, well, it started with Povorsk. A -- I -- I was not there when the tragedy\nhappened. I was in the Soviet Union, working a coal mine. And I found out about -- I\nknew -- I -- I -- the Soviet -- I -- I read the Soviet press, even though I worked for a slave\nlabor camp, we had a cultural life. There were -- there was a library with papers and\nbooks which you could read. As a matter of fact, I ha -- even had the privilege of\nsubscribing for -- to -- to the Pravda, one of the Soviet papers, for a short while, for a few\nmonths, because the librarian, who was also a internee like myself, had about half a\ndozen papers he could give, to give us a semblance of kind of freedom and culture. So, he\ngave me the privilege of sur-surpri -- which was dirt cheap, it was pennies. But, to me it\nhad a big value besides reading it, I could read it in the library. But I could sell it\nafterward for the purpose of rolling cigarettes. I, myself, was smoking. And we used to\nhave a kind of -- there was some commerce in the camp. Womens used to come out from\noutside and had a little -- put like a -- a kiosk in the camp. And if you had money, you\ncould buy things. They used to bring in milk, he used to bring in tobacco, which was sold\nby the glass. Actually, that was not even tobacco, it was tobacco roots, which were\nchopped up with an ax and you rolled it in newspaper. Now, once a mon -- once a week, I\nused to sell my bread ration in this commerce in -- intercamp commerce -- intracamp\ncommerce, and buy tobacco. But I had to buy a newspaper. A newspaper cost 10 rubles.\nSo, when I had five newspapers or six newspapers a week, I could sell five of them and\none use for my own needs and with others I used to get the 50 rubles and use it to buy the\ntobacco roots, see? So, while I had it, I was in very good shape, financially. I didn\u2019t have\nto sell my bread ration. So -- and in the press, there wasn\u2019t much about the Final\nSolution. The Soviet press didn\u2019t write much about it, they wrote about atrocities\ncommitted against the Soviet people, none that mentioned Jews. Of course the particular\nJews [indecipherable] designed to be exterminated. But -- And they knew about it, of\ncourse, but they didn\u2019t -- I remember when the revolt broke out in the Warsaw ghetto,\nthere was a little column, one column, but about four or five inches tall, about a revolt in\nthe Warsaw ghetto, which was liquidated by -- the Warsaw ghetto was liquidated by the\nGerman -- the German occupiers. Not mentioning much about just one word to the Jews.\nThe ghetto, of course, they had to mention the ghetto, because there\u2019s only one kind of a\nghetto, a Jewish ghetto. So they mentioned it. So there wasn\u2019t much about it. But one\nday, when the forces -- the Soviet forces approached not far from where my town was\nlocated, I wrote a letter from camp to the -- somebody in the ci -- town council, asking if\nthere\u2019s any information about my family. It so happened that the town was not liberated\nyet. It was still -- there was still the -- the -- the front was there in the -- the next city. For\nquite awhile, places changed hands back and forth, but I -- another town close to it, was\nalready liberated. And a friend of mine, who was a former partisan, where my brother\nwas also a partisan of the sa -- the same place, the same time. He was already liberated\nand he was working in the post office. And when they saw my name -- my return address,\nwith my name on it, he opened the letter and he sent it to my brother. He read it, sent to\nmy brother and my brother answered it. And he -- he just wrote me that he is -- he knows\nthat he -- he 1s -- he 1s alive, everything 1s -- all is well. He works now as -- doing -- as a\nguard in an NK VD, secret -- secret police farm. And he sent me -- he would sent me\nsome money. Course, they used to speculate theirselves by [indecipherable] and he knew\nthat I was in bad shape, so he send me some money. A few days later, I got a letter from\none of my friend -- a former brother-in-law of mine, as a matter of fact, and then his\nbrother, describing what happened and how it happened and who survived and did not\nsurvive. So I knew -- then I find out what happened. And I had in mind that my wi -- in\n1945, after the war, the Poles and the Soviets conclude an agreement to let -- this ha -- by\nthe way, this information is in the videotape, but I\u2019m telling you so you understand what I\nam talking about -- had an agreement to let all of those who were former Polish citizens,\ntil \u201839, coo -- provided they are Jews or Poles, not Ukrainians or Russians, could get out,\nback to Poland. And after a year, they find -- this is a long story, but doesn\u2019t make any\nsense, it repeats again. I left the Soviet Union, you know, and then came to Poland. But, I\nha -- I thought [P\u2019ll be able to go by this town and see what -- you know, where the place\nwas, at least, fo-found out what happened. But luckily, luckily, I could not stop there,\nbecause th-they routed me through a different way, through Belarus, through Minsk and -\n- but I always dreamed about coming back to Povorsk and putting up a monument, which\nwas impossible during Soviet days. First of all, they didn\u2019t allow any monuments which\nspecifically said Jews perished there. Soviet citizens, yes, but not Jews. So, 1-1n -- in --\nand at that time, this -- this was a very dangerous place to be, because Ukrainian\nnationalists already harassed the Soviet army and killed the Jews, just like the Poles did\nafter the war, yeah. So, is good that they did not go through. But I -- I -- It was a kind of -\n- became an obsession for me to come and put up a monument. Now, when you co -- then\nthey st -- they started allowing already do -- before Gorbachov\u2019s time already, they start\nallowing put up with and even in Yiddish or in Hebrew, what happened -- descriptions on\nthese monuments, and they allowed to have Jews. I don\u2019t know if you know about that\npol -- a Soviet write up of the name of Viefter Schenko, who wrote a poem about,\n\u2018\u201cThere\u2019s no monument in Babier,\u201d which is Kiev -- probably heard about it. And he\nwrote he\u2019s ashamed being a Russian, that they did not allow to put up m-monuments in\nthese places, so they did allow, finally they did allow. And then, in the beg -- middle of\nthis decade, since \u201895, I think, Ukraine became independent and they allowed, already.\nAnd there was a fellow in our -- 1n -- in the -- in the province there, who, as a matter of\nfact, he\u2019s -- he -- he was the -- the -- the secretary of the Communist party in the -- in the\n-- yeah, he was half Jewish, too, but he didn\u2019t -- he said himself Ukrainian. And he\nstarted putting up this monument with government help, first Soviet and then the\nindependent Ukraine. I got in touch with him, I found out there is in Israel a organization,\nit\u2019s called the House of Waleen. Waleen is the name of the province which has records of\nmany. There\u2019s probably, in that part, hundreds of thousands of Jews perished. They\ndidn\u2019t send them to -- to concentration camps, they killed them right then and there. In\nour town, it was exploded dump, oil dump that the Soviets built and they exploded it and\nthen they used it for when they killed th-the German [indecipherable] they dump the Jews\nin there, you know. And this is the place -- so it was a military zone, belonged to the\narmy. And you could not go into any place in army during Soviet days. They agreed\ntheyll let us put up the monument. We -- We -- We a-agreed on a price with -- how\nmuch it\u2019ll cost. But it came the day when they\u2019re supposed -- already the monument is\nready and they decided nyet, they\u2019re not allowed to on the mili-military. So, I -- finally it\nwas ready, we are ready to go in 19 -- in 19 -- this was what, 60, now is 90 -- 98 and 96.\n95, we had a date and I had a group, the -- a woman from the local -- well, W -- WMG --\nGME, I think it is. That used to be WGAM. This is affiliate of CBS. No, wait a minute,\nwas NBC. NBC, ABC, what\u2019s it, the other one?",
        "Q: CBS.",
        "A: CBS, yeah, CBS, with a cameraman and a reporter. Reluctantly the station agreed to\npay her expenses, she wanted to go very badly, but you couldn\u2019t go, because they said\nthey wouldn\u2019t allow to -- later on I found out they did allow it, make a long story short,\nand we -- we scheduled a trip for the next year, 1960 -- 96, yeah. I had a group of about\n12 people. There was myself, my wife and my daughter from Louisiana. The one from\nIsrael couldn\u2019t make it, she couldn\u2019t get vacation at that time, which I hope by next year\nto take her and some of my grandchildren, [indecipherable]. And we f -- and two women,\none -- both of them lived in New York, one now is in Boston and the other one works in\nNew York, daughters of survivors. And then there was another son of survivors, whose\nfather was a partisan with my brother. My brother and his wife and his three children,\nmade a group of 12 people. And a friend of mine who lives in Warsaw came with us and\nRochelle, of course. And we came -- we visited Warsaw. We went to Povorsk, this town.\nWe -- I have some pictures, I'll show you, of this. I also have a tape from that time, to all\n-- put this all in. We were met by the officials of the local government -- the head of the\nlocal council and by the officials, the hea -- the head of the -- deputy chairman of the\nregional council, which probably that\u2019s about 20 to 30 village -- like a county,\napproximately, here. Went with us with -- they -- we rented a bus and we stayed at a\nhotel, without cold water. My wife probably told you about the toilets [indecipherable]\ntell you. And we stayed there two days. We visited this town, we put up the monument.\nWe made -- you know, dedicated -- dedicated the monu -- the monument was standing\nalready. It was -- had the description of Hebrew, Ukrainian and -- and English, not in\nYiddish. And we started talking among ourselves, my friend from Poland, this --\nremarked it should be in Yiddish also, even though nobody can understand, nobody can\nread it, we are here, you know, the few of us old ones to understand, will be gone soon.\nSo we commissioned him, developer there, to put -- and we gave a few hundred more\ndollars, to put up the -- I had my -- the inscription in Yiddish, I had prepared all the -- all\nof them, all the descriptions. So I gave him a copy of it and he sent me a photo that it\u2019s\nalready there, it\u2019s put on. They also decided to -- we decided it needs a wider, more --\nunder the -- what do you call it?",
        "Q: Base\u201d?",
        "A: The base, but --",
        "Q: Pedestal?",
        "A: No, well you put under the house, what\u2019s under the house?",
        "Q: Foundation?",
        "A: Foundation. A wider foundation because it might topple. It looks good. It was a\nbeautiful [indecipherable]. So, we visited there one day and the same day we went to -- to\nmore neighboring towns. One, the town where I was born, and --",
        "Q: Which was? What was the name?",
        "A: Which was called Threeanoffka, Threeanoffka. And the -- there is a monument they\nput up themselves, place it is sa -- they say 345 Jews were buried there. I don\u2019t know who\ncounted them, but that\u2019s what they did. It\u2019s in Hebrew and in Ukrainian. But in this town,\nthere is a Jewish cemetery, par-part of which survived, ironically, a -- a cemetery that\nsurvives here, because the -- most cemeteries didn\u2019t. But, after the day, I was so -- we as -\n- we have to go to another town, we had relatives there and the -- one of the participants,\n[indecipherable] his parents lived there. So, there was already late and he talked me in,\nth-the fellow that put up the [indecipherable] talked me into go. Not -- It was only a few\nminutes away, I realized afterward. So, hopefully I'll go there again next year. And there,\nI know, there\u2019s a -- there\u2019s some stones still standing, one -- including I know one from\nmy grandmother, my paternal grandmother is buried there. And all -- all my relatives are\nburied there that died naturally, you know, the -- over generations. I don\u2019t know how\nmuch of it is left though, but I can\u2019t wait to see it. And we went to another town, where\nthere about -- over 3,000 people buried. And we came back to the big city, city where I\nwent to high school, we came to the hotel and we lied down there fo -- to have a nap, to\nhave supper late -- oh, yeah, th -- I didn\u2019t tell you about this story. They invited us to\ndinner.",
        "Q: Who did?",
        "A: The -- The officials invite us to dinner and there might have been about 20 people\nthere. The commandant of the base and his little girl and a few other people, th-the driver,\nthe photographer. We had -- We had the video photographer, yeah. Whom -- For whom,\nyou know, we paid, but it -- pennies, you know, si -- their -- their currency was so -- it\nwas 280,000 rubles. Ukrainian rubles, not Russian rubles, because [indecipherable] at\nthat time, forpa dollars, stack like this. And -- And the vodka flow -- flowed like water,\nyou know, and we had borsht and we had pilmani, which 1s Jewish, kreplach, you know.\nFamiliar dishes. And -- And pork. This was [indecipherable] bread, great br-bread was\ngood. And steak, it was kind of a cook steak and a -- it was good, was a good meal. And\nthey made speeches and of course, whoever spoke. I spoke, during the dedication of the\nmonument. I\u2019ll show you, if you have -- if you\u2019 Il have time, I\u2019Il show you part of it. You\nmight get the -- the feeling what -- how it was there. And we said some prayers, and the\nKaddish. So, when we came back to the hotel -- the hotel was a beautiful building with --\nnice and clean, nice bed, but there\u2019s no cold wa -- no hot water, cold water, so you\ncouldn\u2019t take a shower. So we lied down, we think it\u2019Il be later on -- this was already\nwhat, six, seven o\u2019clock, have to have a nap, because it\u2019s so em-emotionally charged you\nknow, and then -- and then the -- physically tired and exhausted. So we lied down for --\nfigure for about an hour and figure then we\u2019 ll go out and have dinner or supper, whatever\n[indecipherable]. We woke up eight o\u2019clock in the morning, without -- and dress\n[indecipherable]. That\u2019s how we -- tired we were. So then we went to Warsaw and from\nWarsaw, we split, my brother and his family -- and his family went to Lodz, where my\nsister-in-law was born, with their kids. His name was Reuben, her name was -- is Bella\nand the three kids was Ruth and Allen and -- and Audrey. And the two girls went to\nFrance, to have a good time, to Paris. And we went to Vilna with Rochelle, she told you\nabout this trip, very, very emotional. So that\u2019s how we -- then we came back to Warsaw,\nbecause there\u2019s no direct flights from Vilna, or -- so they had to go through Warsaw and\nmy -- my friend, who was -- who prepared dinner for us, it happened to be our\nanniversary. This was June 22nd. We went on the 17th, th-this was June 22nd, which 1s --\nturned to -- our wedding anniversary, it\u2019s also the anniversary of the beginning of the war\nbetween Germany and Russia -- Soviet Union, 19 -- 1942. And from Vilna, we came\nback to Warsaw, stayed a couple of days. Warsaw, of course, is a beautiful city. I knew\nWarsaw from before the war. It looks exactly the way it did look and -- and sa --\nimproved. They have nice set of -- of cross the busy sections, you had underground\nshopping centers like, underground. And if you cross, you know Mashallkosco is the\nmain street, you go under -- you cannot cross the street. And the -- the -- the traffic is\nunbelievable, it looked beautiful. And the situation, my sister-in-law told me Lodz was\nnot as good. Warsaw\u2019s fine, but the -- the countryside is not -- not good. Economic\nsituation not good. But through, of course we were interest -- we went -- I went to look at\nthe ghetto and I had an uncle and an aunt and cousins living there. And there\u2019s nothing.\nEmpty, but signs -- signs of streets that don\u2019t exist and signs of bunkers where the -- the\nWarsaw ghetto fighters came out or went into the sewers. Lamila, aiteen and some other\nplaces. Of course, it\u2019s -- it affected us very badly. The rest of the city is beautiful, except\nthe ghetto, nothing there.",
        "Q: Who was it in your family who was killed in Povorsk? Per -- From your wife and son\nand your parents?",
        "A: My -- My parents, my two sisters and then one brother was killed in the partisan\ngroup.",
        "Q: Which brother was that?",
        "A: This was Chaim, the second oldest, after me. H-He was, you know, there was a group\nthat came out -- I\u2019m repeating the same thing you have already, on the videotapes, a\ngroup of Jewish boys and girls came out just days before, they\u2019re prepared already,\nweeks before, to leave the town, because Poles didn\u2019t have a ghetto. There were -- There\nused -- The -- The -- There was one -- one German in town, Usunderfuerer. He was a\ngood man, helped a lot of Jews. But the -- his official thing was to -- to collect whatever\nhe could, you know, the furs, gold, anything of -- of value from the Jews. And then he\nhad the Jews working in this exploded oil dump, to squeeze out the oil that seeped\nthrough into the sand. Cause this is pra -- what was high -- high octane fuel -- aviation\nfuel, yeah, when the Soviets exploded it. An-And they had to turn it in, but at the same\ntime, they used to steal some of it, in bottles, in su -- having the coat and put it under the\ncoat. And they -- For a year, they lived from that. They used to exchange it with the\npeasants, which used it for -- for lightning fuel, you know, for kerosene. They found a\nway, because this was very dangerous, they have to put some salt in it. And salt was very,\nvery expensive. Salt is -- was a -- you know, ver -- at a higher value than gold, salt. Th-\nTheir -- Their diets require a lot of sa -- well, everybody, Europeans need a lot of salt. So\nfor the preserving pork you had to need sa -- you need salt. And to -- for cooking, for\nanything, you need salt. So salt was very expen -- but still, they put in some salt and they\ncould use kerosene lamps. There was no electricity in that region. So that\u2019s what they did.\nSo, for a year, they were not molested. Well, they were, but not to -- to such an extent as\nin other cities. The Ukrainian police was the worst, of course. There was no Germans in\ntown, they were at the front. Only this one German. A friend of mine was his orderly.\nUsed to do the -- in the day when they killed the Jews, he -- he t-told them, \u201cTake this\nhorse out to the field, this horse.\u201d In -- In other words, he gave him opportunity to run\naway and he did survive this way. So -- And the rest of the towns, and my wife\u2019s parents\n-- the brothers escaped -- three brothers escaped, one -- and the fourth one 1s -- oh -- there\n-- she had four brothers and three of them escaped. One of them escaped with the -- he\nworked for the Soviet railroad. Later on, he was accused that he let the one train run with\nthe other -- Soviet -- the Soviet law is very strict and they put him 1n jail and he died in\njail. You know that. And many friends -- we didn\u2019t have any more relatives in this town,\nmy relatives lived in the next town, which I told you about, Rhiannoffka. And\neverywhere there was my relatives there.",
        "Q: Can you describe what it was like to be back in Povorsk after all those years,\nemotionally.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s very difficult to describe it, but I\u2019ll try. We were -- I didn\u2019t recognize\nth-the -- the village. This changed entirely, the roads are different. They are paved roads,\nthey weren\u2019t in those days. And we came -- we lived near the railroad station, about a\nhundred meter or a hundred yards from the railroad, right across. And there was a water\ntower. Railroad -- Belonged to the railroads, was for the purpose of filling the\nlocomotives with water. It was, in that time, all locomotives were all coal -- coal and\nsteam. So it needs lots of water. There was a pipeline from -- from the -- from a lake,\nabout three kilometers away, about two miles approximately, to this water tower. And\nfrom u -- the water towers was between the railroad and us, which is as close as from\nhere to Wayside Road. And there\u2019s nothing there. Our houses were -- a matter of fact,\nthey have a picture of our house. It\u2019s -- Somebody found it and I don\u2019t know where they\ngot it, sent it to -- to a friend of mine in Israel.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: Tape one, side B, of an interview with Jerry Slivka. So y-you just repeat about --\nabout your house?",
        "A: Yeah, well, half of the house is on this picture. And then the three neighbor\u2019s houses -\n- four neighbor\u2019s houses, five -- five or six neighbor\u2019s house in same row. And then there\nwas a flour mill, which 1s -- this -- it\u2019s not there. Nothing there now. Behind that, about\n20 yards away, there\u2019s a whole new section built of new homes. And I have the suspicion\nthey were built from the materials of these houses. They didn\u2019t want to live in these\nhouses, you know, in case somebody claims them or what. E-Even though they thought\neverybody died anyway. But, it would better, you know, to pull them apart and build new\nhouses. So, I have -- I will show you that picture. In the front there, 1n this picture, the\nfront of the houses, there\u2019s military vehicles. I don\u2019t know was tanks or half tracks or\nsomething like that. And I don\u2019t -- maybe they are Polish or they are Soviet. It looked\nlike it\u2019s a wide -- wide picture. It looked like sake -- taken by -- either by the military or\nby some other coun -- I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not the amateur or a regular photographer\npicture. It looked like the scroll, it was rolled up into a storn, what it is fixed and I cou -- I\nrecognized the houses. And we were standing there and nothing there. Th-The -- The\nwhole -- The whole -- The whole trip was very emotional. We got on a train in Warsaw\nand I knew I -- many times I was traveling this, from Warsaw to -- from -- not so from\nWarsaw, ulefell from Lodz, travel mi -- and I knew every station, I knew every town.\nAnd every one of them had Jewish people there. They -- Probably 70 - 80 - 90 percent,\nsome of them were Jewish, the -- the peasants lived in the villages. Jews lived in the\nsmall towns, so called shtetla, see, and some bigger cities. In the city, you were -- Koven,\nwhere I went to school, which 1s not far from Povorsk, had a population of about 30,000 -\n22 to 25,000 were Jewish. And this -- Now, it\u2019s a cit-city of 60,000, and there isn\u2019t a\nsingle Jew. And the city was completely destroyed in the war and rebuilt by the Soviets,\nyou know, in these drab, long multi-story buildings, which fall a -- which started to fall\napart the minute they were built, and they\u2019 re still -- so it wa -- this was very emotional.\nIn time, you come to the station, I knew that station. The station was rebuilt exactly the\nway it was before the war. Looks -- This was a beautiful station and it still looks\nbeautiful, til you come into it. You see there -- Rochelle had to go to the bathroom in the\nhole in the floor, she -- with a half partition in between the men and the women. Luckily,\nour daughter went in with her, so she could help her to get up. She has problem with her\nback. Otherwise, I know what would happen there. And there -- the -- the -- there\u2019s the\nbazaar, you can buy anything you want, there\u2019s no -- nothing in the store, there is no\nstores. One or two stores in the whole city. Used to be a lively, you know, commercial\ncenter, nothing. I don\u2019t know, there might be a few Jews. Somebody said there might be\ntwo or three Jews in town, but I -- I never -- the -- nobody came. None of the population\ncame to this dedication, except the officials. And they make speeches about, you know,\ntheir former citizens and former, you know, survivors of the -- the -- and talking about\npeace and love among the nations and so forth and so on. I thanked them for putting up\nthe monument, I thanked them for -- I -- I carried with me a oak seedling, grown from an\nacorn in my backyard, right here. And when I opened it up, they couldn\u2019t -- I -- I\nwrapped it in soil, you know, potting -- like potting soil, that\u2019s wh -- potting soil, what\nthey use, you know, for growing flowers, and they couldn\u2019t -- admired th-the -- the\nbeauty of the soil, you know, such -- looks like rich, fertile soil, because they have sandy\nsoil. Even the Ukraine has beautiful soil. And I planted it there and it is not growing so\ngood, because I got a picture from it -- a friend of -- somebody, a friend of mine in Israel,\nknows a -- non-Jewish, who used to be a neighbor of ours, and they took a picture. And\nmy brother sends them a check every so often and this fellow there sent them packages.\nSo they take care of it. The head of the local council promised that he\u2019Il assign a high\nschool class to take care of it. So, every year I send them a hundred dollars, which is\nthere a fortune. And he wouldn\u2019t answer me, so I -- last year I cal -- finally got his\ntelephone number. I couldn\u2019t reach him at his pla -- place o -- office. So I got from\nsomebody else in his home, I call him, oh, he was very happy that -- but he didn\u2019t write\n[indecipherable] he -- maybe he doesn\u2019t know how to write, I don\u2019t know. But he said\noh, they are taking care of it. I don\u2019t see what they do there, but I can see there\u2019s a -- kind\nof to protect it, like a little cage. But it didn\u2019t grow. The soil is not so good, least probably\nsome fertilizer. We\u2019ll be there next year, be -- I hope. I hope, but with me, it was -- I -- th\n-- th -- this is my -- if I ever accomplished anything in my life, this would be at the -- at\nthe top of it. Most important thing I did. I feel I did something my -- they will approve --\nwould have approved -- th-th-the victims. So, there are some others aware of that and\nwant to hear about it. Some contributed to it. I didn\u2019t want -- it was not decide -- of\ncourse, I would pay for it with myself, see? But I wanted them to participate and to have\na Stake in it, see? And whoever I asked, they contributed some. I didn\u2019t ask, I wrote them\na letter them, if you can and want, contribute. If not, we\u2019ll do it anyway, see? So, sa -- he\nask him, of course, to come visit. Most of them did not want to. Most of -- there\u2019s not too\nmany, there\u2019s only a handful. So this was our trip. She told you about her -- she stood in\nthe middle of the -- middle of the street and cried. Vilna -- I don\u2019t know if she told you,\nVilna was the culture capital -- the -- the cul -- the Jewish -- Jewish culture. This was the\nonly place where there was teacher seminars for Hebrew teachers, Yiddish teachers and\nPolish Yiddish teachers for Vilna -- for high schools. It had a beautiful library called a\nstreshun library. And it had a very active, dynamic, Jewish population from -- from the\nextreme left to the extreme right and the Hasidim -- there were no Hasidim, no, cause\nVil-Vilna is just the opposite. Op -- They opposed Hasidism, see? So, there was a -- the\ngowan of Vilna is -- was a rabbi from the 18th century, 18th or 19th. Yeah, they -- they s-\nstill two streets, they are -- streets of the gowan\u2019s name. Gowan means a genius in\nHebrew, yeah. And there\u2019s the Jewish street. Street of the Jews. Still named so, but\nthere\u2019s no gowan, and no -- the cemetery where her mother was buried is not there,\nthere\u2019s a park there now. But they\u2019re building in this place at -- some -- some broken\nmonuments and they\u2019re trying to build a little monument composed of all these -- that --\nthe pieces that they found.",
        "Q: Will you tell a little bit more about the years before you had gone back and actually\nerected this monument? Had you been -- Had it been a dream of yours for a long time to\ndo this?",
        "A: It has been -- no-not a -- 1t was an obsession. I -- I was waiting for the day that it could\nbe -- I had a feeling one days we\u2019ll do it. I had a feeling. It 1s 1t -- I never expected that\nthe Soviet Union will collapse this way. I knew them, I -- they kept everything so strong\nand it would be -- never believed it, but 1t did happen. And I saw that time that I ca -- I\ncan realize my -- my -- my dream. I wanted very badly to do that, you see. I -- I -- I could\nhear -- you know, to this day, when I\u2019m on my lawn, I hear their cries. Th-The noise of\nthe -- of the lawnmower -- I -- I -- I -- when I was sitting in the mine -- when I found out\nwhat happened, I hear their cries. And I -- I -- At that time, I couldn\u2019t even cry myself.\nNow, I can, very easily. But at that time, I couldn\u2019t and I wonder what happened to me,\nwh-wh-where is my human emotions? There were none. | -- There was nobody to talk to\nabout it. It is very difficult to describe the feeling, very difficult. But I hoped to do it. And\nwe did. I hope to be again -- I want all my grandchildren to see it, to remember.",
        "Q: Did your ability to talk about your first wife and child have anything to do with the\nerection of the monument?",
        "A: No. No, no, no. I -- I felt to everybody the [indecipherable] you know, it was my\nfamily, my friend, my grandmother. My grandmother, in the next town, escaped when\nthey started shooting the -- tha -- surrounding the town, th-the Ukrainian police. This was\na town th-the -- the -- a lot of s-small agriculture. Every house had a garden and my\ngrandmother had a beanstalks, you know, which made it like a maze of -- place you c --\nyou could run away. Not far, bu -- a-and around town, there was a lot of forests. A lot of\nthem escaped to the forest. And my grandmother ran away with two of her grandchildren,\none my namesake. M-My aunts -- cousin of mine. And another cousin of mine who\nsurvived the war was in the partisans, he was a bricklayer. So, they needed in the\npartisans, you know, to build stoves in the -- in these trenches like, see? Those little\nbuildings in a -- in a hole under ground and he used to build these things. And he escaped\nalso to the forest, he found my grandmother na -- the next day, dead, with two kids,\nholding hands. So, I felt obligation to all of them, not -- not just my wife.",
        "Q: Will you talk a little more about the process then, of how you actually made it\nhappen? The monument.",
        "A: Well, I -- I told you before, it wa --",
        "Q: I meant --",
        "A: I tried, I got in touch with these people with the -- ma -- build these monuments. You -\n- They made a business out of it, not just monuments for the Holocau -- in general, they\nput in the import. Import -- they bring the stone. It is -- It is black granite. And they\nstarted selling, you know, for -- for local needs. With this, I guess this created a new\nindustry there for them. So, when I got in touch with them already, I -- I spoke to them\nquite often on the telephone, tried to write them. But when they said no -- when the\nmilitary said no, then I got in touch with Senator Cohen\u2019s office here, ask him what to do,\nhow to -- I wrote to the -- to -- to the Ukrainian embassy and I told them, you know, U-\nUkraine now 1s the largest country in Europe. And I wrote them, \u201cYou are this largest\ncountry, can\u2019t you as -- allow a piece of land f-for your former citizens?\u201d They didn\u2019t\nanswer. Then, Cohen\u2019s office told me to write -- there\u2019s a -- in Washington an agency --\nAmerican Commission for the Preservation of Historic si -- US historic sites abroad,\nwhich includes Holocaust sites. And they wrote to the embassy. And Senator Cohen\nwrote to the embassy, no answer. When we came back in 19 -- in 1995, when I ca -- we\nwent to Israel. We had planned to go to Israel and from Israel to go to -- to the -- to -- to -\n- to Ukraine. But since we couldn\u2019t make it, you know, we went a year later, we went to\nIsrael anyway, to see our daughter, kids. And when I came back, there was a letter to the\ncommission, that they understand I\u2019m going to Povorsk to sup -- put up a monument to\nmy -- for my parents. I don\u2019t know where they got this idea. The monument was already\nthere, it was standing already. And they promise that the local authorities will cooperate\nwith me to make it possible, which was great. But there was no civilians, not ci -- nobody\ncame from the local population. If we go now, I'll -- my brother, we decided, if we go,\nwe go for a few days, we walk around among -- among the civilians of the village and\nfind out -- I -- I am sure there are some people my age or a little younger, even, that will\nremember our family. I know what ha -- you know what happened, there is nothing to\nfind out, see? They\u2019re there and 1s the right place, because I have a picture of this place.\nA friend of mine sent somebody there while he\u2019s in the Ukraine, he say -- gave him a --\nfilled up his car with -- a Ukrainian -- with gas and he gave him a camera with film, take\npictures of this place. He did and there was a lot of bones lying on the ground, cause he\u2019s\nholding one bone that looks like a human. As a matter of fact, one of us -- one of this --\nfrom Boston fellow, found a little bone and I gis -- gave it to the local police to send the -\n- to FBI |-lab to -- it turned out was not human. I don\u2019t know, it was -- I don\u2019t know if\nthey parted with it, but anyway, he told me, it\u2019s not human, that\u2019s just -- so, 1t was -- it\ntook -- took -- it didn\u2019t take this long, it took several years, but the dream was there, th-\nthe obsession was there -- the -- th-the -- it was very important. So this 1s, if I\naccomplished anything in my life, this is the thing, the most important thing I did.",
        "Q: What was it then that made -- I mean, yo-you mentioned before we started the tapes\nthat when you did your interview with the Holocaust museum -- your video interview\neight years ago, that you hadn\u2019t told the story about your first wife and your son. What\nhappened that made you feel really --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, just too -- too painful about my son and the -- the marriage was a\nmisalliance. I -- I cannot talk about it.",
        "Q: Will you say -- I -- It sounds as if your family had a long history in the town where\nyou were born. Just for the record, will you say something about you family\u2019s history in\nthat area?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s -- was a town, you know, which, like most small towns that size, was mixed\nUkrainian and Jewish. It was -- I -- I can still picture the way it looked. There was a big\nmarketplace, like in a square, in the middle of town. And right in the center was the u --\nthe Ukrainian church, which is the same, the provis -- they called it provis lauw -- the\nRussian Orthodox church used to be there. And ri-right next to it, almost, in the square --\nnot in the middle of the square, but among the houses, was the Jewish synagogue. And ar\n-- and all the center was occupied by Jewish homes. A little out further, there were\npeasants, Ukrainian peasants, who had their parcels of land on them, and they were now\nbasically agricultural people, you know, they grew -- grew stuff. The Jews in this town\nwere all artisans. Blacksmiths, carpenters, who built furniture and houses and all kinds of\ncarpentry. Tailors, who work for the local non-Jewish population mostly, but they were\nthe majority. They used to go to villages where -- for six months, to build a house or to\nsew clothes for a couple who got married, you know, stayed there. They were all very\npious. Used to go, when they were in town, they used to go three times a day to the\nsynagogue. Lately, not so much. Most of them had grown beards, the majority, except\nafter the s-second World War, there were some that did shave their -- their faces. They\nwere strong believers in a rab -- Hasidic rabe, which exists now in New York. It was\ncalled a stollena chasidim. It was a typical, what we called -- we lived in the next town, it\nwas only 12 kilometers away, the same kind of people, we called them backward, cause\nthey were very observant. But there was no railroad sta -- the railroad station was six\nkilometers away. So you had to, 1f you\u2019re going to go by tra -- by train, you had to walk\nto the railroad station or take a horse and wagon. I -- And this was the kind of -- and there\nwas ha -- at least half of the -- half of the town were Kirzners, my mother\u2019s maiden name.\nAnd they were -- And I don\u2019t know even how they were related, but the one I knew were\nvery close, cousins, uncles, aunts. There must have been at least 70 to a hundred people\nperished of my relatives. I had two grandmother that -- wa -- one died a natural death\nmany years ago and the other one I told you, was found, was running away with two\ngrandchildren. I had the cousins by the dozens. This was the kind of a town it was. In th -\n- As I told you before, we -- we -- I lived in a town that was new. This one had a tradition\nway back, it was for generations -- during the war, the first World War, 1t was occupied\nby the Germans and they evacuated us. I was born during the first World War and we\nwere evacuated into the hinterland -- German, by Austro-Hungarians, which operated this\nsector of the front. I remember mother used to tell me I was probably s-six months old, it\nwas January, I was born in July. So, I was about five, six months old and they evacuate\nus 1n -- in cattle cars. Later Hitler used this for -- for sending -- but it was not -- these\nwere not evacuated for -- to -- to -- to die, they were evacu -- to -- to save their lives, s-so\nthey can move the front, you know, they we -- without hindrance by [indecipherable |\ncivilian population. And when I ca -- When you came to the destination, which was only\nabout 50 to 60 miles away, I was half frozen. So the Hungarian soldiers who operated\nthat sector of the front, threw me -- they stood -- to -- stood in a line and threw me from\nhand to hand til they revived me. Later in, the same Hungarians sent Jews to Auschwitz.\nSee the difference? That\u2019s why a lot of people did not escape, because we knew the\nGermans from the first World War. My father spoke Germans perfe -- German perfectly,\nand he worked for the Germans the first World War, as an interpreter. And who would\nexpect that the most civilized country in Europe -- nobody believed -- just the Germans\nwho didn\u2019t believe it -- that last long, so that we, who lived under the Germans in the first\nWorld War, we were waiting for them. Because the Czarist -- th-the -- the enemy was the\nCzarist army, the Cossacks. See, there was no Jewish officers in the -- in the Czarist\narmy, but there were Jewish officers in the German army. Or in the Hungarian --\nHungaria -- the Austro-Hungarian army. So nobody expected it. A lot of them could have\nbeen saved, a lot of them could have been evacuated. My parents could have. But how do\nyou leave? You have a home, you have a cow, you have a -- a barn, you have -- you\nknow, everything there. Not -- Not much, but a place to live.",
        "Q: Will you say something about your mother? I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve heard anything about\nher.",
        "A: M-M-My mom, she\u2019s an housewi -- housewife, worked very hard. She was a excellent\ncook and baker. She used to bake whe -- even though there were several bakers, she used\nto bake bread and we used to sell it at a little store. And we also kept -- she has a few --\none, two boarders, used to come for dinner in our house and sometimes -- there was no\nhotel in this village, so she used to also ser -- have a room prepared in case somebody\ncame and decided to stay overnight, to stay over there. Hard working, good mother,\nwonderful lady. And had a tough life. So we -- did we all. My fa-father was the -- the\nlearned Jew in town. He used to -- He used to write -- if they had to petition the court --\nwhich was in the big city used to come to my father to write petition, it was to be in\nPolish, very few people knew Polish. Very few people knew Russian before that. He\nspoke both of them. Three of them were German, Russian and ba -- and Hebrew of\ncourse. But I think I inherited his ability to languages.",
        "Q: Do you still have a -- a strong interest in languages?",
        "A: Oh, very much so. I -- Now I don\u2019t so mu -- I used to -- I used to teach Hebrew and\nYiddish. I taught a course here in Portland High School, evening classes, in Yiddish. I\nhad some student, non-Jewish, took Yiddish. And then I had a course 1n the temple for\nHebrew. I had one in Florida, where we lived now, a Hebrew class, but it dwindled. It\u2019s a\nvery few. I was the official interpreter here for many years and for the Maine Medical\nCenter, the county jail and police station and Diocese Refugee Resettlement Center and\nthe Jewish Federation Settlement Center. All the Jews that came in from Russia all went\nthrough me. I was their first -- I met them at the plane, somebody else brought the\nflowers. I greeted them in their own language. We took them over to the apartment which\nwe'd prepared, with a refrigerator full of groceries for at least a week. Take their kid to\nschools, every new immigrant had to be taken to the hospital for a tuberculosis test, that\nwas my job. I -- I had to translate -- the women had to be examined and I had to find the\nwords for mun -- the -- the monthly period and so many things I had to look up in the\ndictionary.",
        "Q: How did you become involved in that?",
        "A: Because I was the only one here that knew these languages. Nobody knew them. Later\non, some of them -- a few years later, some of them did do it. But the -- the diocese,\nwhich took care, you know, of the non-Jewish immigrants, for the state resettlement\ncenter, needed Polish interpreters. So, they had some of their own, but ga -- you -- you\nknow, you never can find -- when you need -- all of a sudden you need somebody, it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- I was on call. The -- The immigration department has an office here in Portland and\nthey caught some Poles who bought Social Security numbers -- cards in New York, at 50\ndollars apiece and they worked in a fancy hotel in Kennebunk. They got -- are illegal\nimmigrants -- to read them their rights. Called me up in the middle of the night, little girl\ngot sick, Polish and they don\u2019t speak English and they don\u2019t know how to explain to the\ndoctor when they -- they won\u2019t do anything until they know what -- what they can and\ncan not do. Three in the morning, two in the morning, come over there and we -- it has\nit\u2019s rewards, though, you see -- you come there and within minutes, you explain to them\nwhat the girls might be allergic to something, or they give her a shot or something and\nthe girl starts smiling. Great. An-And I had a prejudice, you know, I had to fight my\nprejudice against Poles, cause I knew how they treated us. But it\u2019s not their fault. Not\ntheir fault, so -- so you had to -- it -- it isn\u2019t always easy. You -- Sometimes you --\nDerogatory remarks about Jews from the same people you are trying to help, see? You\u2019re\nnot -- you know, unwillingly, 1-1-1t sticks through, you know, sticks through. I had one\nfellow that I work with, he was -- he -- he had an accident, he worked in the construction\nand he couldn\u2019t work. He lifted something and disc came out and they operated on him,\nprobably they shouldn\u2019t have operated. And he -- But he knew how to collect workmen\u2019s\ncompensation for several years. And he comes to -- he\u2019s not employed and he says he --\nbut he went to Florida, you try a place where there are no Blacks. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll look\nwhere there are not Jews either. He even -- I says, \u201cWhat do you got against Black?\u201d He\nsays, \u201cI have nothing against them, but I don\u2019t want to I-live near.\u201d Yo-You -- You know,\nyou -- there\u2019s a -- subtle ways of -- to show your, you know, discrimination and hatred\nand all that.",
        "Q: D-Does everybody you work with know that you\u2019re Jewish in these cases?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Well th-the Jewish, of course, immigrants knew and they also knew, they\nknew they were -- I\u2019m Jewish. I never made any secret of it. And never made any secret\nof when it was dangerous. I lived in Russia with the Russian people in the coal mines\n[indecipherable], they wonder how come you are -- you are the only one working here\nand the -- the director of the mine 1s a Jew. Little did they know I -- he is another\n[indecipherable] kind of a Jew.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Jerry Slivka. So, even -- I -- I was\ncurious about that, when you mentioned about your time in the coal mines and you were\ntalk -- you just said that you didn\u2019t make any secret of -- of being a Jew, I was wondering\ndi -- how -- how people knew that you were Jewish. Did you -- Did you tell them or did\nthey just know --",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah [indecipherable] they -- they -- they couldn\u2019t tell, because my Russian\nwas perfect, I spoke only Russian there, I lived there for several years with them. I -- I\nadopted their -- their mannerism, adopted their way. But ma -- every so often, we talked\nabout this and I was -- I was not -- made no secret of it. I told them that there are good\nJews and there are bad Jews as [indecipherable] good Russians and bad Russians and\ngood Ukrainians and bad Ukrainians. And I remember one fellow who was -- he was\ntalking about -- I know this -- he was anti-Semitic, no question about and he was talking\nout about me and talk about the -- the director of the -- the -- the mine, and so -- and I say\n-- and I told him -- his name was Vanya, which is short for Ivan, I says -- I say, \u201cLook,\nevery Russianality has it\u2019s bad and -- and good people, every national -- every nationality\nhas bad traits as a nationality, you know, get bad ones and good one,\u201d I says, \u201cbut in\nyou,\u201d I says, \u201call the bad ones. Jewish, Ukrainian, Russian, are concentrated in you.\u201d Shut\nhim up right away. Didn\u2019t know what to say. So I was -- I was not afraid. That time\nespecially, th -- it was a crime to -- to show national intolerance -- with Stalin, for calling\nsomebody a dirty Jew or a kike or that -- any -- any kind of nationality, that\u2019s 15 years in\njail. Later on, 1t became official policy, anti-Semitism, but not in that time.",
        "Q: Can you talk more about your relationship with Communism? I mean, back then you\nwere -- you were somewhat -- I -- I -- I\u2019m interested in your perspective on Communism\nback in the 19 -- I guess it was 1941 when you were working with the Communist Youth\nLeague, and --",
        "A: [inaudible] I like we start a little earlier?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: When I was young, my teenagers -- teenaged years, youngsters in Poland were very\nbusy in politics. We have nothing else to do. There was no work, there wa -- we had to\nfind the enemy and who the enemy was, who knows? The Poles were course, hated --\nhated us. We didn\u2019t see any future for ourselves as Jews -- y-young -- Jewish youngsters.\nSo we -- first of all, I wer -- I was probably 14 -15, is I joined the group Socialist\nZionists, the Shamara Zaheer and then the -- they\u2019re the one that pioneered in Israel, in\nthe kibbutzim, way to the left. The atheist Socialist Nationalist Jews. Then the -- I -- I\ndidn\u2019t like this kind of Socialism, so I became a Rightist youngster, you know for the --\nwas -- with -- they called it that time, the Revisionist Zionist again, Zionist again. And I\nwas disappointed then and because it was somewhat semi-Fascist, the -- the uniforms\nwere brown like -- like German SS. That what -- they had it before the German SS, you\nknow, but I mean, there was fights between the left and the right and I was basically\nZionist, but not -- I -- I don\u2019t know what the solution would be, to -- I -- a Jewish\nhomeland and Palestine or not the Jewish homeland and Palestine. So if you\u2019re born here,\nwe should have the rights here. So I joined the group, which was anti-Fascist. Little did I\nknow the anti-Fascist group was a -- the poli -- this Communist party was illegal in\nPoland. This was a way for them to -- from within, to come into the -- some kind of legal\nway and this was the anti-Fascist, they preached Socialist unity among the Je -- Je-Jewish\nSocialist parties -- so cal -- so called progressive, Polish so called progressive and they f-\nformed this, but later on I realized this was a Communist front. So I quit this party. But I\n-- I loved the Hebrew language, you know, I -- I was educated in it and the Communist\nforbid -- forbade Zionism and the language -- not just Zionism, but the language. Yiddish\nwas the language. I says, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we have two languages? It\u2019s a language that we --\nyou know, it\u2019s -- is al -- you know, come -- 1s already several thousand years in our\nhistory, why should we abandon? It\u2019s a beautiful language, I like it.\u201d So, I could not fit in\ninto a frame. I could not fi -- I -- I couldn\u2019t be a Communist. I was a Zionist -- a partial\nZionist. I had my own ideas. The same with religion, I was not -- I could not conform to\nthe official religion. I had atheistic or agnostic -- I don\u2019t know -- feelings, see? But like --\nlike many others, I didn\u2019t know what -- I couldn\u2019t make -- I -- I -- til this day I don\u2019t\nknow what I want, and I\u2019m sure that many other people don\u2019t either. Then came the\nCommunists, in 1939. Even though what I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the Soviet\nUnion, I saw right away something is wrong there. First of all, they arrested Communists,\nwho was -- one jail -- spent in jail, idealists, people idealist with -- spent in Polish jail\nfive, 10 years, for nothing. For raising a red flag, for speaking out against the\ngovernment, they were sent away. Th-They\u2019d say -- when they came in, the ri -- the first\nvictims were these people, they sent them away. I got a -- I -- I worked -- during the\nbeginning, I tried to organize a school that will t-teach Yiddish, because since we didn\u2019t\nhave enough population to -- to introduce the Yiddish language, Yiddish history, Jewish\nhistory, into the curriculum [indecipherable] my 20\u2019s, [indecipherable] are married, a-a-\nand -- and then to the Ukrainian school, because the -- the majority were the Ukrainian,\nand they rebuffed me. It all -- It all -- They almost accused me of being Nationalist and\nthis was a big -- oh, either Nationalist or Cosmopolitan, both of them were non-kosher.\nSo I gave up, I couldn\u2019t do anything. I got a job, because I was doing a good job for th --\nI was -- you know, I ha -- I worked with the -- at that time there were Yiddish papers that\ncame from Kiev and in the beginning were the honeymoon. So, the local pol -- di -- g-ga-\ngave me the job of managing the local store. There wasn\u2019t much in it, but whatever was, I\nwas the first one that I could use for myself, see? And my family. And my father got the\njob because he spoke Russian perfectly. I didn\u2019t speak Russian, but I -- I knew Ukrainian.\nNever learned it, but from the -- we lived among the Ukrainians, I knew Ukrainian. Then,\nthe war started and I left. I was in the army and when I came there, they -- they -- because\n-- | -- | -- | -- I fell into -- it\u2019s a long story, I don\u2019t -- not trying to tell the whole thing. I\nwas in -- in -- in German encirclement and I risked my life to get out of there and they\ntook and they put me on the front and then they took me off the front, because I was -- I\nam unreliable, because I was -- lived in Poland before \u201839. Thousands and thousands and\nthousands of people, they took out the front. They didn\u2019t take off local Ukrainians, who\ndeserted every day from the place where I was. I did not desert, because I know desertion\nmean death. Th-The Germans capture me, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s it, 1t\u2019Il be the end. So -- and then\nthey put me on -- on the build-building a railroad. It\u2019s already the second year of the war\nand -- near Stalingrad, on the other side of the Volga, because there was none there to put\non this side -- on the east -- west side -- you never know which [indecipherable] it was.\nAnd we build this railroad and it was built by the NK VD. This 1s the -- the secret police,\nth-the -- the prison authorities. And they took us as work battalions -- military work\nbattalions, and treated just like the -- these con -- co -- con -- convicts, see? And these\nwere also mostly for political crimes. Those who had a lot of si -- land, you know, the\nKulaks and so forth. Some were there for next to nothing. They stole something from the\nplace of work. Five years, 10 years, 15 years, you know, Stalin -- Stalin\u2019s pogrom. Then I\nrealized -- I saw the -- th-the real face of Communism, because I remember them and I\nwo-work in the coal mine and I figured if I only knew -- if Stalin only knew -- see how\nblind I was -- what -- what they do to us. Little did I know this was Stalin\u2019s orders. And\nwe build a railroad before we went in the mine, there used to be a -- a NK VD official by\nthe name of Brienin. Brienin I know was a Hebrew writer and I think it must be the same\nfamily, it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s very unusual name. Because I met a girl in Portland here, she\u2019s not\na local. And when I told her that I remember from the Hebrew literature, we studied -- a\nfellow by the name Reuben Brienin, she said that\u2019s -- was her uncle. She lived in -- I\ndon\u2019t know, Pennsylvania or somewhere. She knew who it was. He stayed in the Soviet\nUnion and this must be a -- from this same family and he was wearing elegant white shirt\n-- clean, white shirt and shiny boots, with military, navy pants and he used to walk -- see\n- - and now we had to -- it was in the Steppests, you know, the flat land. We had to dig\nthe soil out and we had to do so many cubic meters. An-And -- And we -- with -- and\nwheelbarrows, all by hand, without any machinery, go up, you know, like second floor\nhigh to put the trestle -- on the trestle and then somebody will stand there -- not one, in\nthe hundreds, and -- and the temperature, it\u2019Il be hard so we can put the rails on it. And\nhe used to come and go with this -- check out this. And he was -- he looked very well fed\na-and we were -- we were -- if you did the norm, that\u2019s a five cubic yards of soil, you get\na certain soup. There were three kinds of soup. Was millet -- millet, it\u2019s -- was thicker or\nthinner. Some was from water, all the way, you know to a little thick se -- or more bread.\nAn-And it was like a vicious circle, if you couldn\u2019t make your norm, you got less to eat.\nYou had less to eat, you had less strength to -- to -- to do any. So you were doomed.\nLuckily, this -- after four months, th-th-this was finished and I survived it. I went from --\nprobably from 150 pounds to about 100 pounds in -- in no time. Then I realized the real -\n- what the real Soviet order is, what Communism is. But I was supported before and I\nwas happy because in the beginning, you know, there were Jews in high -- high officials.\nNot too many too high. There was one Awon Kakanovich that survived, it was -- he was\nStalin\u2019s brother-in-law, a Jew. The rest of them were killed afterward. Especially 1948,\nbut I was out at that time. But it -- 1t was a great letdown.",
        "Q: What about when you came to America and you\u2019re here in the 1950\u2019s and you\u2019re in\nthe midst of the American response to Communism during the -- the Cold War? Did you\n-- What was -- Did -- What was your understanding? Did you -- could you relate to\nAmerican policy?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I did relate to [indecipherable] more so -- more so, because this was a\nthousand percent improvement on what we had. I never lived in a free country. I came\nand I got a job in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. And Woonsocket Rhode Island\u2019s a small\ntown and I saw -- I -- I already started reading -- knew enough English to read a paper.\nAnd I saw in the paper -- this was Hanukah holiday. And in the local paper, there an\narticle about Hanukah. The -- With a picture of a Menorah. The Hebrew school and so --\nI couldn\u2019t understand it, see? To me, this was -- no -- no American paid -- paid attention\nto it, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s normal, right? To me, it was not normal, it was -- it made me idealize\nAmerica, even though there were many things later on I found out that I knew it was not\nso great. But compared to what we had, this was paradise. I made my first wages, a dollar\nfive an hour, union wages, that\u2019s a help on a truck. I was a Hebrew teacher, the gets --\nfirst I got a job as a Hebrew teacher. This was 1948, there was some -- a lot of\nunemployment. Truman was just elected and they -- they thought the country\u2019s go-going\non to the dogs, economically, see? It was very difficult. So I stayed -- it was in Boston.\nSo when I came, they gave me a job in a Hebrew school. They knew I knew Hebrew.\nSome of my relatives -- relative\u2019s relatives in Chelsea, in Massachusetts and I came there.\nI did not -- my English was zero. And their Hebrew was zero -- and they gave me first a\nfifth grade with their teacher supervising me. Well, I didn\u2019t do badly because they\nunderstood some Hebrew. I have a natural knack of teaching, even though I have no\nacademic preparation for it. But I -- I could convey, you know, whatever I know to\nothers. And I did all right, he says, \u201cYou have promise.\u201d So then, there was -- th-the-then\nthe school year ended and there was a teacher, a young lady in the first grade and her\ncontract called for the school year, she quit. They decided to keep the school open\nanother two months -- do -- two weeks or three weeks, I don\u2019t remember what. The\nparents, they are paying tuition for the year, they wanted to have -- you know, let them\nhave the kids another two years in scho -- two weeks in school, not to be at their backs.\nWas a small, poor town, Chelsea. So, they gave me this first grade. I am by myself with a\nclassroom about 30 kids, don\u2019t understand a word of Hebrew. They can\u2019t read already,\nhardly and I don\u2019t understand a word of Eng -- they smelled a rat right away and this was\nthe worst time of my life. So, anyway, wi -- it lasted only a couple of weeks and the\nprincipal said, \u201cMaybe start the new year, I\u2019ll send for you.\u201d Meantime I went to\nWoonsocket, I got this job in the -- dollar five an hour, union wages. Hebrew school used\nto pay 75 dollars a week for about three hours a day, few days a week, which was great.\nAnd the -- also, he ga -- they send me to the -- Boston has it -- used to have a Hebrew\nteacher\u2019s college. Now it\u2019s called the Hebrew college, which awards degrees, you know,\nthe undergraduate and -- and the masters. They wanted to accept me in the third year -- it\nwas a four year school, third year, nights. And I -- when I thought -- w-we\u2019re -- with the\nkids -- September came, he sent for me, he wanted me to come and I said, \u201cNothing\ndoing, I don\u2019t want it, it\u2019s enough.\u201d So, I -- I went to -- later on, I lost the job. So, over\nthe summer, I came back to Boston, I got another job and there I went to Hebrew college\nand they told me they\u2019ll let me into a third -- I -- I had to take a-an exam in a few -- I -- a\nfew subjects I did not know. Talmud, I think 1t was and some other -- Hebrew, I -- the la-\nlanguage and I didn\u2019t have problems. But I didn\u2019t decide -- but I had a cousin -- my\ncousin\u2019s wife, who\u2019s to me like a sister and that -- she died already, and she says,\n\u201cWorking in this place is not for you.\u201d It was a [indecipherable], I was a foreman there. It\nwas 20 women. It was not easy either, but I managed. They pay me -- what -- came from\n42 dollars a week union wages, I got 32 dollars as a supervisor, you know. Foreman, 32\ndollars a week. The girl that worked there made -- the -- the -- the minimum wage went\nup to 75 cents an hour. Was 30 dol -- they -- they made more -- more than I did, almost.\nSo, she says, \u201cYou have to go to school, you have to learn. So it\u2019s either Hebrew college,\nor --\u201d she sa -- I says, \u201cMy father was an accountant, self taught.\u201d He is got some\ncorrespondence course. So I knew a little bit about bookkeeping. So I went to Bentley\u2019s -\n- Bentley College, which is now a big school. At that [indecipherable], it was a little --\nlittle school in Boylston Street and I took accounting. So, I worked for three -- three years\nin Boston, then we got married -- I got married, had a daughter, we came to Portland. So\n-- What were they talking about -- we talked abou-about something else, we were talking\nabout America, America. I -- America I thought, to me -- to me it was the greatest\ncountry in the world. So, of course, I knew the Soviet Union, I knew it already. I kn -- I --\nit was an evil empire, no question about it. I couldn\u2019t see how can American defend the\nsystem they don\u2019t know -- think about, which a lot of American did. There are many bad\nthings, you know, the Nixon and this and -- McCarthy. But these were things that did not\napply to me. I knew I can go anyplace -- I knew -- none -- it wasn\u2019t easy at that time,\neither, Brandeis was built, because it was hard for Jewish student to go to college, they\nhad a -- they had the certain number they would accept. But they were a certain number,\nnot zero. Poland it was, well, not zero. Point point something, see? And we were 10\npercent the population in Poland. And then the Soviet Union, so this, to me, is ideal, to --\nI didn\u2019t miss an election. I took my Americanism very, very seriously.",
        "Q: When did you become a citizen?",
        "A: I had -- usually, it takes five years. So, I came in \u201848, I was entitled to be in *53. But,\nin \u201853, we moved to Portland and you have to be a citizen of the state for at least a year.\nSo I have to wait in -- one more year. And Rochelle became a citizen the year after and\nshe was the first one to be on television.",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t tell me about that.",
        "A: Yeah, she was on television, on the -- it was on November 11. November 11 she\nbecame a citizen in the supreme co -- federal court, right here. I became active in the\nJewish organization [indecipherable]. I became one time friend -- a neighbor said, \u201cI\nwould like you to come to see a group. We are meeting every week, you might find it\ninteresting.\u201d I was, you know, very much aware of my accent. I got a job here as an\noffice manager, but still -- my accent\u2019s still heavy, the way it is now. This was, you\nknow, 1953. So, he took me in an-and they used to meet in the Congregational church,\nWoodfras Congregational Church, in the basement. And I come in there and the -- the\ngroup didn\u2019t tell me what is -- what they do and what is -- it\u2019s, \u201cCCome in, you -- you'll\nlike it.\u201d Boucher was his name, Frenchman. So I come in there and it is a group of\nToastmasters International, a group that learns public speaking, yeah. And this exactly\nwhat I needed, because I was -- I\u2019m -- I am by nature very bashful. Sometimes doesn\u2019t\nshow so much, but I am. And -- And I am very much aware of my accent, which I lost --\nthis I lost afterward. Not the accent, but being -- being, you know, considering an\nimpediment, yeah. It 1s not. I -- I learned that if you have to say something, people listen,\neven if you speak with an accent. So, I belong to this group and all of a sudden, when I\nmade my first -- you have to, after a few weeks, you make your so called icebreaker\nspeech and I told them what my story, I came to this country -- I still have it. And they --\nthey applauded, so it was great. And then I became active in the many other Jewish\norganizations. Jewish federation, Jewish Home for the Aged. I became, after -- at age 50,\nI quit my job and I started -- open my own office for the practice of public accounting.\nAnd I developed a very nice practice, people liked me, I did well. A few years ago, well,\nit\u2019s long -- le -- it\u2019s the nin -- 90 -- 1990, Rochelle and I and Senator Mitchell and\nSenator Cohen were honored. She told you -- I think she showed you this, this thing\nthere.",

[indecipherable] an evening. So, this is another\nachievement I think which we are very proud of.",
        "Q: And this was something you -- the immigrant work was something that you happened\ninto because of your language ability?",

        "Q: And -- But it took ha -- ha -- that -- then it evolved from there, I imagine to where you\nwere very --",
        "A: Oh, well there a lot of work there. I knew what it means to be an immigrant. I felt for\nthem, I knew and I understood them. I -- I know what they are talking about, see? And\nnot only my -- Rochelle did a lot of work. We had -- We organized once a marriage for\nthree couples, a mass marriage in the Temple. The rabbi, everything. Three couples. I\nmade a Bar Mitzvah for a boy. Organized a dinner for a hundred, 125 people, lunch. I\ntaught them to read Hebrew, then I send them to the girl to teach them to chant. It didn\u2019t\nwor -- they -- they have nothing to do with -- with the Portland -- Jewish institutions here.\nThe same people.

You know, it\u2019s a state that has not too many Jews.\nI remember when we came in the beginning, and th-the Yom HaShoah, Day of\nRemembrance came and we used to sit like mourners, real mourners. Nobody paid any\nattention. You didn\u2019t read about it, you didn\u2019t hear about it. Some congregations in\nBoston used to have a -- a memorial, you know. But Portland, nothing. Not in the\nsynagogue, even to this day, nothing. A-And I figured, we have to do something about it.\nGerda called me up, Gerda Haas. First of all, we went to Bangor, there was a theological\nseminary in there, non-Jewish, that wanted to have some kind -- it didn\u2019t work out. So\nthen one day she calls me, we having the -- Bates co -- Walden College had the seminar\non the Holocaust, which she organized with some other professors from Walden and\nother colleges, and --",

        "A: This was a four -- about 14 years ago. We are celebrating Bar Mitzvah last -- last year,\nit\u2019s almost 14 years. And there are some non-Jewish people and some Jewish people and\nwe all going to dif -- no budget. There was no money. We operate for about two years,\nwe run out of money and we needed -- we had an executive director, she paid very little,\nbut we didn\u2019t have a -- so we borrowed from a bank and we gave our per-personal\nsignatures. You know, th-then we started raising more money. We have now budget --\nnot much, but for a state like Maine, 100,000 dollars, we pay 40,000 for a executive\ndirector, who does all the work. And we have our annual meeting, to which we bring a\nspeaker. I established a little fund. Rochelle used to speak 1n schools and I used to speak\nand -- and the honorarium we get goes to this fund. And [indecipherable] 10,00 dollars,\nnow the income from it pays for speakers once a year. We have a trip to Poland every\ntwo years, for teachers. We have two teachers seminars every year and Bates college\nused to have one upstate. This year was the first year we had only one, cause there were\nnot enough. And we\u2019re [indecipherable]. We designed curriculum for kindergarten to\nfifth grade -- through fourth grade, I think. And then to eighth grade. And now they\u2019re ta\n-- eight to 12. We\u2019re talking about -- curriculum for eight to 12, which includes -- it\u2019s\nliterature based curriculum. Also includes Maine specific problems like the French\nminority in Maine and now other minority, we participate in fighting prejudice and the\nsame time we tried to rid ourselves of prejudice. A few weeks ago, they dabbed the\nswastikas on the synagogue, Presque Isle, where there\u2019s probably 10 Jews. And just the\nday before Yom Kippur. Swastika with a -- said, \u201cBurn Jews.\u201d They didn\u2019t -- still didn\u2019t\ncatch. Then there was, in another church, another town not far upstate, no Jews there.\nAnd they\u2019re -- And this -- and they -- this vandalant, they caught two kids that\nvandalized, you know, the piano and chairs and equipment in a church, mind you.

        "A: Well, the Human Rights Center is a great influence in -- in Portland. Not so much\namong the Jewish population, I -- yeah -- it did -- we have a lot of Jewish members, no --\nwe -- membership is part of our budget. And we have a lot of -- and especially when we\nhave the annual meeting. We pur -- we have about 150 - 200 people come and quite a\nfew Jews. But the interest among the schools, young people mostly, is the non-Jewish\nschools. Rochelle goes to quite a few schools to speak, I go with her. Sometimes, when I\nsee she is tired, I will try to answer some questions, cause sometime they\u2019Il ask questions\nwhich she doesn\u2019t know and I will do. Sometimes I speak on subjects of resistance,\nwhich I know from second hand, but still I know it, cause my brother was there. So I\nknow quite a b-bit about it. Th-They -- Our presence is felt. Our presence is felt now in\nthe state of Maine. As far as Maine, how did we integrate into Maine life when we came\nto Maine, I think sh --Rochelle told you, sh-she -- she had a hard time, very difficult time.\nI worked -- I was busy and I worked many hours. My job was seven days and -- and --\nand two evenings. Six days. Six days and two evenings I used to work. And then I started\nbuilding my own practice, doing some tax returns and the other -- the other five evenings,\nand Sundays. So, it was difficult. But I was too busy. She had a child, we didn\u2019t have a\ncar, we didn\u2019t have a television. We used to sit and listen to the radio, Fibber Magee,\nMolly, probably not aware what it is. Was a very popular, you know, sitcom without TV,\nradio. A year later we got the radio and we got a car, we made some friends. Portland --\nnot just Portland, all of Maine, Jewish and non-Jewish societies, they were closed, kind\nof, you know. If you were from away, you were not born here, regardless how long you\nlived, you were -- you were a stranger, yeah. What do they know? Now, the thing has\nchanged, because there a lot of people -- there a lot of newcomers and the Jewish\ncommunity -- the leadership of the Jewish community are newcomers. At that time, when\nI was a director of the federation board, I was probably the only away fa -- persons. Now\nthere are a lot of people, away. So, it doesn\u2019t -- you don\u2019t need the local, you know, little\nniche, you know, with the -- they had to join. You can find some people, you know, in\nyour situation, which is -- which is mu-much, much better. But this was, you know, it\nwas -- it was a provincial town. It isn\u2019t now.",
        "Q: Did you experience any discrimination?",
        "A: As a Jew? No, not at all. It ne -- It never ca -- came t -- I never -- never had to put to\n-- needed to. I -- Pro-Probably existed. It existed -- I know it existed in the clubs. We\nlived across the street from Woodfras Club, our first place. And Woodfras Club didn\u2019t\nhave any Jewish members til the 60\u2019s, when they started, you know, fighting\ndiscrimination. What helped? They to -- They didn\u2019t give them -- for discrimin -- the\nstate passed a law -- the organization that discriminate cannot get a liquor license. And\nthis was a great deal -- without a liquor license. The same happened w-with Woodfras\nClub, the same a -- ha -- with the Elks Club, the same act with Cumberland Club, va -- ga\n-- Cumberland -- Cumberland Country Club, you know, with the golf course. Now there\nare -- people are fighting for Jewish membership, to get Jewish members in there. Jews\nare good to -- fundraisers, you know, Jews can -- can contribute a lot, see? So now there\nare Jewish regis -- and the -- in the Portl -- Portland cun -- Cumberland Country Club,\nwhich is in Portland. Things that never expected. There was a -- a -- that town here,\nPoland Springs, beautiful town on a hill, and this will be the -- beautiful hotels there and -\n- and the sign was no dukes -- dogs or Jews welcome. So what happened, a bos -- Boston\nJew ca -- bought it. Of course it -- it wa -- out -- it\u2019s out of business now, the motel down\nthere. But, they start accept -- there\u2019s no problem now.",
        "Q: When you started to make friends in the Portland area, who did you make friends with\nand how did that [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, the fir -- the first one was newcomers. We had some friends, survivors. Not all\nof them were likable. Not all -- Not all of them were favorite friends, but we had\nsomething in common, at least. But then we kind of drifted apart. We found people on\nour level. Doesn\u2019t mean that their level was lower than ours, but you found many -- th-\nthe -- the good thing was about it, that people were seeking us out, you know, to -- as\nfriends, which was great, much better than when you -- you are asked to be a -- not --\nyou\u2019re asked, you don\u2019t have to be a gi -- you know, people -- by the language, you\nknow, determines, shows that somebody wants you as a friend. So, most of our friends\nare not -- well, there -- there aren\u2019t many left. There aren\u2019t any, practically, survivors.\nThere\u2019s one or two survivors that we know, we keep in touch, but that\u2019s about it.",
        "Q: Are -- Do you find friendships with survivors to be different in -- in [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, now it -- it\u2019s in deft, they all changed. They all changed, some for the worse, some\nfor the better. But we don\u2019t have to choose friend because of our common past. There\nplenty people we find -- we -- we have a friend now that doesn\u2019t understand what it\nmeans to be a survivor. Sh-She\u2019s look -- she ca -- sits right here and she looks at this and\nwe know -- sh-she knows Rochelle is talking to her about the Holocaust and she says,\n\u201cTh-This crystal, that\u2019s your mother leave you.\u201d It\u2019s not so funny, but it\u2019s\n[indecipherable]. Your mother left. We da -- we don\u2019t know what to give it to. Nobody\nwants to get that one. But we made -- we made our mark here on this town.",
        "Q: Did you talk a-about your past? Have you always talked and have you always been\nable to remember\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have to. If there were listeners, we were ready to talk. Not for t --\nnot for our satisfaction, to teach, only. Just -- Just to let -- we are trying to make people\naware what can happen if there is hatred, what can happen when there is intolerance. And\nthat\u2019s where it\u2019s not easy, not easy. I can see how -- she talk -- she can be very tough. She\nwa -- I start talking and all of a sudden I break down, because see now, where -- even\nwhen I tas -- it comes through, certain things, certain happenings, I -- I have to control\nmyself, very -- it\u2019s very difficult to control, not to -- stop the com -- breakdown. She\ndoesn\u2019t have this problem. Sh-She used to -- She used to smoke, so when she used to\nspeak before a school and get out afterwards, first thing, she\u2019ll take a cigarette. Now she\ndoesn\u2019t. She had an angina attack and I convinced her not to smoke. It wasn\u2019t easy, cause\nshe thought she cannot go to the bathroom without the cigarette. That\u2019s a necessities. I --\nI says, \u201cTry this time, try this time.\u201d Slowly, gradually, she stopped smo -- she doesn\u2019t\nsmoke much anyway. I used to smoke a lot, but I gave it up. I -- I -- I also loved to take a\ndrink, too, you know, in the Soviet Union, everybody drinks. And if you were -- if I were\nin the Soviet Union, I wouldn\u2019t be alive by now, I\u2019m sure, from the cigarettes and the\ndrinking, I would be kaput. But I knew -- I needed a drink to -- being to express myself.\nNot much, just a little. I don\u2019t need it now, I can do it. I needed a cigarette to calm my\nnerves. At that time, it had another purpose, 1-it helped not to feel the hunger pains. You\ntake a deep puff and you feel it right here, almost in the stomach. But now, I don\u2019t need\nit. There were many mistakes we made. She had problems when we came and all of a\nsudden she finds herself in a strange town, without friends, with a little girl, confined.\nShe was young. So she got depression, you know, from the past and all this. And the\ndoctor made a mistake, he did not involve me. He did agree -- he treated her with, you\nknow, a general practitioner, he treated her with pills to keep her, but we -- we should\nhave -- as -- talked to me and talk us together and try to solve the problems we had. We\ndidn\u2019t. That\u2019s a mistake we made. She never learned to talk to me. She can talk to an\naudience, but not to me, about herself. Talks about what happened to her during the\nHolocaust, but problems that we have, which hu-human beings do, regardless how much\nyou might love or not love, it\u2019s -- is -- they have problems and he -- that didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t\nrealize -- she takes pills, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s all. We didn\u2019t know how to relate our kids. We didn\u2019t\ndo badly. I think we brought up good kids. But, I wish I would known 40 years ago what\nI know now. We could have done better. But, there\u2019s no limit.",
        "Q: What did -- What do you know now, that you didn\u2019t know then, that would have been",
        "A: Well, re-relationships. Relationship between husband and wife or a father and -- and\ndaughter. We have a daughter who is overweight and we didn\u2019t know how to stop her.\nSomething was bothering, you know, you know, and we didn\u2019t know what. She\u2019s -- grew\nup to be a wonderful human being. She\u2019s a teacher. She has her Master\u2019s 1n education.\nParents used to come when she used to teach class -- now, she does teach reading, you\nknow, she has sev-several school -- used to come with -- they had once -- one kid, the\nsibling grew up to -- they came to the school, ask her to put her 1-in Harriet\u2019s class. Is\nexcellent teacher. Perhaps I could have done something about it. Perhaps I did something\nwrong, which I shouldn\u2019t have done. I have my doubts. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\nPeople think she\u2019s the greatest person in the world. She weighs probably 200 pounds,\nwhich is unhealthy. And every time we see her, I -- we don\u2019t talk about it. I wrote her a\nletter a couple years ago, explaining to her how I feel. I cannot -- I can better express\nmyself when I write. And I just asked her, \u201cDo you -- Did you see my letter?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cAre you going to answer?\u201d \u201cSomeday.\u201d Now, of course, she\u2019s a woman in her\n40\u2019s. She\u2019s not -- she\u2019s not a kid I can tell what to do. But, we could have made our lifes\na little easier, perhaps, I don\u2019t know. But oh, there\u2019s so much [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay. All right. It\u2019s now October the 23rd, 1998, and we are continuing the interview\nwith Jerry Slivka. And if -- I was thinking we could go back a little. We didn\u2019t discuss so\nmuch yesterday about the period right after you had arrived in the United States and your\n-- and your journey to the US, and we discussed it only very briefly in your videotaped\ninterview. So why don\u2019t we start with your journey here, and talk about --",
        "A: [indecipherable] arrived in the United States --",
        "Q: Yes, and -- and your trip from. Where did you leave from, what was the -- what was\nthe atmosphere on the ship?",
        "A: Well, I was in the -- I came here directly from Italy, where I stayed in a DP camp.\nFrom 1946, about -- the fall of 1946. I told you about my brother, my brother was there\nright before, couple years. And I came to Austria, by the underground -- it was called the\nBricha -- on the way to Israel [indecipherable] with my kibbutz. And when I came to\nItaly, there was a telegram waiting for me at the Joint Distribution Committee, the Jewish\nrelief organization, which had my name with that telegram from my brother, with -- and\nhis address where he is, in which camp. So I -- he -- I got it right away, I was very much\namazed, this was very efficient of them to do that. And I got in touch right away with my\nbrother and then some of his friends, we used to do some business, traveling all over\nItaly, you know, buying sa -- u-used clothing, mostly, and selling it on the open air\nmarkets and they took me with them -- with me -- they took me with them. And I came to\na town called Santa Maria deBarny in the Necce -- Lecce province, near Bari. It was in\nsouth -- south -- on the -- I forgot the name of -- of which one is the Adriatic and which\none is the -- the other sea.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] on the east, on the west coast is the Adriatic.",
        "A: Adriatic. This is the -- This is the west coast. The east coast is -- The east coast 1s\nRome. Naples, the east coast 1s the -- and this is the west coast, is right there. And we\nstayed there in villas, these were villas -- the rich people, they used to have, you know,\nrecreation homes, there was summer homes and winter homes, probably winter homes.\nAnd -- But they were very bad shape now, for several years, nothing was done there, but\nit was still beautiful villas. And so we stayed there for a few months and then the owners\nof the villas wanted to get their villas back, so they moved us to a place near Bari, a camp\nthat was used -- it was a -- this was a Italian military camp before the war and during the\nwar, the ge -- the Fascists kept their internees -- Jews from Germany and from\nYugoslavia, were interned there. Luckily, they didn\u2019t get to them and quite a few of them\nsurvived, see? So a long barracks, without ceilings in the rooms, just the -- like a -- a roof\nand the -- with cubicles where you lived, you know, two, three families in a -- in a little\ncubicle about the size of this room here. We lived with -- in a house, like the\nadministration was before, which was a similar kind of a room and there were again, four\nfamilies. There was a couple, friend of mine, with his wife, lived in one. The partitions\nwere with blankets, there were no -- no permanent walls there. They were in one corner,\nmy brother and wife was another corner and there was a third couple in the third corner\nand a fourth couple in the fourth corner. The -- One of the couples was a Yugoslavian\nrabbi, which was a [indecipherable] not the kind of rabbis I knew that, you know, spoke\nYiddish and -- they spoke Ladino, which is a Jewish language of Sephardic Jews. But we\nrealized all of a sudden, there are some common words there and this was the Hebrew th-\nthat was mixed in with Yiddish and with this Ladino, very interest -- very interesting\ncouple. And we stayed there. This camp was for people mostly who wanted to go to\nAmerica. They had -- most of them had relatives in America. They were get in touch with\nthem and they already -- some of them in possession of affidavits from their relatives in --\nbut it was impossible to come, b-because most of us were Polish born, the Polish quota\nwas -- even though I was cha -- as I was born, it was Russia, the Russia quota wa-was\nempty, so the -- I finally got in in the Russian quota, but my brother couldn\u2019t, they\nchanged it to a German quota. Anyway, a lot of people changed their place of birth in\nEurope, just to get in. But still, I waited from 1946, until 1948, two years. We did nothing\nthere. I did not go back to my kibbutz, I -- I -- I -- I had in my mind to take my brother,\njoin back -- rejoin my kibbutz with him and then go to Israel. But within a few months,\nthey left on illegal boat. You probably heard about the illegal Alliasa [indecipherable]\nyou know, people who -- the -- the -- the Jewish agency and other Jewish organizations\nbought some boats that were not really seaworthy, but loaded them with -- tried to get\npast the -- the British pra -- blo-Blockade, to get them into Palestine. Well, I didn\u2019t go,\nmy brother go -- already had papers from relatives. We found our relatives in America,\nBoston. And he -- he -- As a matter of fact, he put an ad to the paper, to the Jewish\norganizations and the -- there wa -- in the Jewish paper, in New York, Yiddish, looking\nfor his uncle, whose name was Decter. Decter -- the C is pronounced in Polish like a Z,\nso it sounded Dezter. His name was Deecter, actually, but they changed it here to Decter,\na complicated affair. But he put it in the -- in the New York -- the Jewish Forwards,\nwhich still being published now, it\u2019s a weekly, that Rupert and so, so and so\u2019s\n[indecipherable] Slivka is looking for his relatives in the name of David Decter. And he\nassumed that mo -- that most of the Jews lived in Brooklyn, see, who lived in Brooklyn,\nNe-New York. Course, he didn\u2019t know, it so happened he lives in Rhode Island. But my\nan -- aunt used to read the Yiddish paper and she found this name and through another,\ngot in touch, It was -- It was this -- It was this -- Our uncle in Rhode Island, who\n[indecipherable], and that\u2019s how he got in touch with her. And then we had some\nrelatives in Worcester, we had some relatives in Boston, and in Brighton. So he got\nalready papers. I didn\u2019t, but the minute I came, he tried to convince me that we should go\nto America, not to Israel, because it\u2019s -- he had enough war, so did I. He had -- He was in\nthe partisan all through the war. So, he says, \u201cLet American Jew go fight, for I have\nenough fighting.\u201d And we decided not to part and I gave in and we decided we will go to\nAmerica. But, we waited about two years. Finally, 1948, in June 19, I arrived in this\ncountry.",
        "Q: Before you go onto that, what di -- what were you doing during those two years? You\nwere staying in the camp [indecipherable]",
        "A: I think -- I -- My brother had a job in the local -- they call it a canteen, it was like a\nco-op store that used to sell some groceries, fruits, you know for the inhabitants of the\ncamp. And some had some, but not too much. They used to get the [indecipherable].\nThen I did the bookkeeping for them [indecipherable] a little that -- knew a little bit about\nbookkeeping, so prepared statements for them every month and -- and we -- and then\nother -- we used to go every week to buy stuff, we used to go to the -- Taranto, it\u2019s at the\n-- the -- the tip -- the -- of the boot, of the boot, you know, the ma -- imagine\n[indecipherable] boot about here, [indecipherable] peninsula, right near Sicily. Used to go\nbuy their fruit and vegetables and some other things that people might buy. And a lot of\npeople --they used to have a truck to their disposal, you know, to bring the stuff and a lot\nof people used to do business, used to sneak into the truck, it\u2019s a big, white there -- th-\nthey didn\u2019t have room to -- to load their stuff, because people had their merchandise an-\nand how do you accuse people -- not let -- they make a living this way. But, we were not\ngreat businessmen, so he and I did not do any -- any business. So, it was black market\nthings, you know, just to try to get along somehow. It was -- we -- it took some lessons,\nsome less -- the -- in Italian or in English. I didn\u2019t take right away, I wasted time. It was\nnot -- I don\u2019t know, the mood was not to study, 1t was kind of subdued. We didn\u2019t know\nwe'll be -- we\u2019ll be able to get out, what we going to know, so the time flew by. We were\nfed twice a day [indecipherable]. No, once a day we used to get lunch and then they gave\nus produce products to prepare for ourselves a breakfast, you know, coffee and what else\nand bread. We used to stand in line and get -- we didn\u2019t have the utilities, we didn\u2019t have\nthe -- any cutlery. So we used -- we used cans from margarine, which was just enough to\nget some soup in it, and was unbelievable life.",
        "Q: Who was running the camp?",
        "A: This was the UNRRA, United Nations Rehabilitation. Lasted during distribution. The\nJewish camps were around during -- during distribution, subsidized by the UNRRA.",
        "Q: So was this an all Jewish camp?",
        "A: No, this one was not. This was Jewish and there were a lot of Yugoslav non-Jews.\nSerbs -- mostly Serbs, they fought among themselves, Serbs and Croats and -- and\nGreeks, all -- all stateless, all refugees who were waiting to get to some new country\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Were these groups mixed? Did you mix at all with the other --",
        "A: Very little, very little. We didn\u2019t speak each other\u2019s language, but we tried to get along\nsomehow. Sometimes there was, I mean, friction. There was more friction among the\nCroats and the -- and the Serbs than among Jews and Yugoslavs. So, but we got along\nsomehow. We got the sh -- same rations. Of course we -- we used to get more rations\nfrom the Joint Distribution Committee, which took care of the Jewish refugees and then\nthey had some other church groups that did help support them. It was a community -- a\nfunny community, all different languages, different nationalities. Everybody waiting for\nthat piece paper -- visa to go to -- to America mostly. And some went to Australia with\n[indecipherable]. Some went to Canada. But for Jews it was very difficult.\n[indecipherable] Canada [indecipherable] Jews and so did the United States, but finally\nthere was a -- Truman introduced a law into Congress and they -- to let in all refugees of\nthe second war. So, finally everybody who wanted to come, did come, unless they could\nprove that they\u2019re Nazi. The question were -- we -- we had to go to CIA and they ask\nyou, \u201cWere you a prostitute, were you a Communist, were you a -- a Nazi, were you a\nFascist?\u201d N-Nobody, of course would sa -- tell that he was, but -- and then we had to go\nthrough a medical examination, if you\u2019re healthy. And they checked your documents out,\ngenuine or not. But two years was a very miserable life there. But we -- we organized --\ntried to organize wha -- there were -- there were some children, very few, but there\nwas some children and there was a school, a Jewish school. [indecipherable] didn\u2019t have\nit. Was a Jewish school. We had a library, Jewish and English -- not Jewi -- Yiddish and\nHebrew books and some English books were located 1n it. I learned a little -- little bit --\nvery, very, little English, some Italian, you know, to get along when I went to town. We\nwere -- I remember once going to the opera in -- in Bari, which was quite an event. And -\n- But, was a miserable life. Not enough food, there was food, but nothing like -- too good.\nSo, then I came in 1948, June 19th. It was a Saturday. It was a cloudy day, but I could see\nthe Statue of Liberty. I -- I also -- I told you before that I enjoyed the -- the cro --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: Tape number three, side A, of an interview with Jerry Slivka. So, you were saying\nabout the Toastmasters?",
        "A: Yeah, when I made my speech, the so-called icebreaking speech, is bi -- fi-first speech\nyou make is to introduce yourself to the group. I -- I entitled it the -- \u201cI\u2019m an American\nby Choice,\u201d and I spoke about my arrival to this -- to the United States here. I stood there\non the deck bec -- 1-it was a ship, I think it was called the Marine Perch. It was a\nconverted troop ship, so we slept -- there were no -- 1-1-in the -- the bowels of the ship in -\n- on hammocks, like the sailors used to sleep. We were women separately, men\nseparately. And I came with a cousin of mine, from Naples, who was -- he came from\nThriamaca, the town where I was born, I told you about, he died later, in Washington,\nDC. And the -- the minute we came on this ship, they served supper, and I was amazed at\nthe -- the co -- quantity of food. And -- And most, of course, the ship were Italians. This\nwas before the -- the law -- the law was already passed about mat -- matbegin, but I came\nas a regular immigrant, for which I paid. It was paid passen -- you had to pay for -- my --\nmy aunt sent me the money and the boat -- I don\u2019t remember what it cost -- it cost about\n300 dollars that time. Was -- Was a lot of money. And the -- the Italian people stood on\nthe deck in Naples and you know, it was a three -- three story, three decks. Not a big ship,\nbut there was a quite a few people there and they were throwing slices of bread to their\nrelatives, so th-they -- th-the situation -- the [indecipherable] situation apparently was\nvery bad after the war. This was already two years after the war, was still -- was still\noccupied. So -- And I -- We had tables for 10, we were assigned a table and after a few\ndays, [indecipherable], we got to the Mediterranean, it cuts across from the Gibraltar,\nbecomes stormy and people got sick. But I -- I -- There were days when I was all alone at\nthe table. I used to take some oranges to take to my friend and we made a few more other\nfriends, a few more that came from the camps, we met on the ship there, half a dozen\npeople. Yo-You know, we had something in common to talk about, we spoke the same\nlanguage. But there were there days when I was all by myself, and the waiter says --\nurged me to eat. He told me to [indecipherable], and I did. I was always hungry, I could\neat a lot at that time. And I --",
        "Q: Did you get sick?",
        "A: Not at -- Not today, I -- the last few days, I got a little bit dizzy-like, you know, when\nwe -- the -- the -- it was not too la-large a ship, it didn\u2019t have stabilize-stabilizers in, like\nwe have now. So, it went up and down, up and down and ma -- so [indecipherable] my\nhat, you know, but I did not throw up, I did -- and I did not lose my appetite. I could eat\nall the time. When I came, we stood and we went through Halifax, it took about two\nweeks, a long time. We stopped at Halifax and then we came in to New York. My cousin\ncame to pick me up, but it took some time before the -- we had to go to Custom, but the\nCustom didn\u2019t take long, we -- I didn\u2019t have much, a little suitcase with a change of\nunderwear, that\u2019s all. And I was standing there, I was thinking about the Statue of\nLiberty. I -- I knew about it and I knew about the inscription, which was by a Jewish girl,\nEmma -- Emma -- Emma Lazarus. Give me your tired, you know, your poor and that -- I\n-- I still get a little bit emotional about it and I was thinking, \u201cWh-What\u2019ll happen to\nme?\u201d I don\u2019t -- I -- I -- I didn\u2019t have any trade or profession. I didn\u2019t know the language\nexcept for a few -- a few sentences, probably. And I wondered what -- what -- what\u2019s\ngoing to happen. And then I came down and I met my cousin, he was holding a picture\nand he thought [indecipherable] pictures, well, see, I didn\u2019t look like my picture, because\nthe picture would look too beautiful. I was not as hand -- handsome as he thought I was\nfrom the picture. And he took me to a friend of his, because he -- he had the -- his father-\nin-law lived with them, his wife\u2019s father, who was a observant Jew. They were observant\nalso, but not as -- as strict. And we didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t come in and it was Saturday,\nShabbat, cannot -- [indecipherable] travel. So we waited til sundown and we took a train\nto Boston, and came in and when we came to Boston, we -- Back Bays -- it was Back\nBay station. And we came Commonwealth Avenue, it\u2019s a major thoroughfare in Boston\nand I saw a lot of cars and I thought was a -- it was a demonstration or a -- what do you\ncall it, a -- well, like a -- like a holiday, you know? There were, you know, a lot of cars,\nI\u2019ve never seen this many cars in my life, even, in Naples or Rome, were no-not this\nmany. They lived just off Brighton Ave. We took -- We took a cab. And we came in\nthere and there was their family, my -- my cousin\u2019s wife\u2019s family. They have a large\nfamily. My cousin didn\u2019t have such a bi-big -- only my aunt and he had two sisters. They\nlived in -- one lived in Worcester, one in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. They lived around\nBoston area and they all came to meet me. Th-They were somewhat disappointed. They\nwere very observant, religious Jews and they expected somebody with a beard, you\nknow, ear locks, and this was not it. And they knew -- they knew my parents. They were\nabout the age of my parents, some of them. They may -- And they knew us from home,\nso -- then I got, I told you, I got the -- through them, I got the jo -- some of them lived in\nChelsea and I got the job in the Hebrew school. That la-lasted a couple of weeks. Then I\nwent to Woonsocket and got the job in the Woolweist company, helper on a truck. This\nwas -- I work -- I made union wages. I joined the union right away, a dollar five an hour.\nAnd they took me into a store and bought a suit, you know, on installments, paid 50 cents\na week or a dollar a week. Life was good, I stayed with my aunt. She lived with her\ndaughter. Her name was Decter -- Anna Decter. My uncle was dead already. She died a\nfew years later from cancer. She was my -- my father\u2019s sister.",
        "Q: Where was your brother?",
        "A: My brother was still in Italy. E-Even though he got his papers before, I got the visa\nfirst. So I came in June, and the minute I start working, I se-sent him money. And -- And\nhe came in December, same year. And we both were -- h-he joined me. I -- I went to pick\nhim up at the -- he also came by boat, but this was a luxury ship, a Italian luxury ship,\nand -- forgot the name of it. And again, we went to school, there was Americanization\nclasses in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. I was this teacher\u2019s star pupil. Name of MacIntosh,\na -- a Scotsman -- Scotsman. And we had -- I already had enough vocabulary so that I\ncould talk to him and most of the class were Ukrainian women who lived -- who came\nbefore the war, but they never learned English. Now, they have to become citizen of the -\n- Social Security started and they had to become citizens, so they had to take the same\nAmericanization classes. But they -- they didn\u2019t know the language. They spoke\nUkrainian, which I understood. There was a Pole, one Pole who had difficult, very\ndifficult -- it\u2019s very difficult to [indecipherable] the English language. I -- I got it very\neasily, so did my brother. He was -- Later, they had a show, you know, to celebrate the --\nI think 1t was Armistice Day [inaudible] -- the melting pot. A co-concept that\u2019s not used\nnow any more. No more melting pot. The [indecipherable] in style now. So, but I stayed\nup til February -- February 20 -- I never forget this day, it was later, on February 22nd. It\nwas a -- not a -- 1t was the -- what holiday 1s February 22nd? Washington? February 22nd\nis a holiday, which was -- and Rhode Island was not -- it was [indecipherable] the -- I --\nwas a holiday in Massachusetts, but not in Rhode Island. What -- I can\u2019t -- can\u2019t think of\nthe [inaudible]. So, I -- I -- I was stunned, I wa -- this was the greater disappointment I\never had. I already was settled and I want to go to -- I wanted to go to school, you know,\ntake more courses there. And all of a sudden, I got a slip, I\u2019m laid off. And -- And my\nbrother got another job, also, another factory, very low, low paying jobs, and we lived\nwith -- with our relatives. They have a big house. My aunt gave us her room. She used to\n-- the house where she lived, later on she gave it to her daughter, she was with her. But\nshe had her own room and then this cousin had two dau -- two little girls. So my aunt\nslept in their room and they gave us her room, two of us slept there. And she cooked for\nus. She made sure, in the morning [indecipherable] I leave for work, that I have hot\ncereal. Very nice, this lady.",
        "Q: Does your family talk together about the war? Di-Did you talk to your family about\nthat?",
        "A: Yes, she told them a-about. And at that time, when I started talking, I -- just like now,\nI -- I break down, co -- even more so. I just st-started crying. In -- In Russia, when I heard\nabou -- I -- I couldn\u2019t cry. I didn\u2019t cry til I come and I didn\u2019t -- no, til I met my brother m1\n-- when we met together, here. But he did not, I did. Now, he cries and -- you just\nmention and he -- he cannot control his emotions. But at that time, my aunt, who used to\ngo -- she was a sick woman, she had hay fever -- fever. So, in the summer, at the end of\nthe summer, she used to go to the White Mountains to spend a few weeks, to ease the\npain of the pollen. But she stayed with us. My cousins went to a few weeks vacation.\nThey went to Narragansett, Narragansett Beach. But she stayed with me and my brother.\nOh, my brother came [inaudible]. She stayed with me, she cook -- and she used to put a\nplate of meat, with this -- and a loaf of bread and I used to clean it up in no time. I\nprobably gained 30 pounds with her, within a few weeks. But I worked hard, so I would\n[indecipherable] some. But I did not observe any diet. loved to eat. It was many years in\nwhich I didn\u2019t have any decent, you know. So, then, when I lost my job fa -- in February,\nthere was a -- a group -- and every town had a group, too, just -- the work that I did later\non, 1-in Portland -- there were some people who did it before, they used to help refugees\nfind jobs, find unemployment, find apartments and so forth, because there were some had\nfamilies and children. So, one took me over. H-He had an appointment to find a job for\nmy brother, but my brother was already working on the job, so he took me. I needed a job\nvery badly. And so he took me to Boston, and I got the job in the suburb of Boston. From\nthe da -- da -- da -- 42 dollars a week, in ra -- I got to 30 -- 30 -- 35 dollars, and I became\na foreman already, I kn-knew enough English and I knew a little bit about the Woolweist\nbusiness, you know, textile, cause I used to work textile before the war also, in Poland.\nSo I became foreman. And then the Korean war started. So, this business started\nbooming, textile. They had -- need uniforms for the army and so forth [indecipherable]\ndid. We re-re-reprocess waste into new stuff. And in the meantime, the fellow that I\nworked for, who was -- he was the chairman of the Republican party in Rhode Island.\nAnd when Truman was elected [indecipherable], no sense in being in business, this is --\nthe -- the country is going to the dogs. He made enough money during the war, so he\nslodi -- sold out. But this fellow in Massachusetts just opened, he started buying stuff and\nsure enough, the Korean war started, he had warehouse full of stuff and the prices went\nup and price controls and -- and wage controls. He says he couldn\u2019t give me a raise, cause\nthere\u2019s wage controls. But the higher pr-priced -- the higher paid employees, he could\nfind, but he didn\u2019t. Anyway, I worked there for about three years, but I was -- in the\nmeantime when I enrolled into Bentley College, which was called that time Bentley\nSchool of Accounting and Finance. And that all they taught us, accounting. So, it worked\nout all right. We get a little apartment, with my brother. And then my brother, who didn\u2019t\nwant to go to fight for, you know, for independent Israel, came to United States and he\nwas draft age -- it wasn\u2019t e-even his real age. They -- They used to think that if you\u2019re\nyoung as kids, easier to get in, so he changed his age. When he came he was drafted,\nKorean war started. And they drafted and took him down. He spent a year in Korea. So,\nhe did not avoid this -- this war. But the only good thing about it, he had, under the bill of\nrights, GI Bill of Rights, he could go to school and they paid the tuition. So he got the\ndegree in -- a degree -- Associate degree in Engineering and a degree in Business\nAdministration and when he graduated, he got a job 1n engineering. But then Boston,\nwhich is, you know, the scientific capital of, you know, state, all of a sudden there was no\none with the -- war ended, the Korean war ended. It was elaborate -- called elaborate\nelectronics [indecipherable] and he lost his job. So, they wanted to give him a job,\ntransfer him, you know, to California or some -- midwest or -- and he -- he -- my sister-\nin-law, he meet um -- met a girl and he married her. So, she didn\u2019t want to leave Boston.\nShe went to Hebrew college, just for the fun of it, she didn\u2019t [indecipherable] her here,\nShe had a little kid and another one. So, she didn\u2019t want to leave Boston, so he decided\nrun business of his own. He op -- ap -- opened a little sandwich shop, which is only --\ntwo degrees, had a little sandwich -- but he made a good living, did all right. Took time.\nAnd I worked 1n this place for three years and then I met Rochelle and we got married.\nThis is the boiler.",
        "Q: Will you talk about how you met Rochelle?",
        "A: Well, my sister-in-law and her aunt, both Auschwitz survivors, and they were in\nGermany, my brother\u2019s wife and her aunt who just died lately. I -- When I tell the story, I\nkid about and say she\u2019s never -- til this day she is mad at her stepm -- with her aunt\nbecause she introduced us. [indecipherable] So, she invited us for dinner and it clicked,\nwe had something in common. Lots in common. We decided to get married.",
        "Q: What did you have in common?",
        "A: Well, we have the same background, we both attended the same te -- kind of schools\nand we both speak Hebrew. And our education was similar and we both speak Yiddish\nand we both survivors. Of course she -- she survived in Nazi concentration camps and I\nwas in Soviet camps. But we both lost our families, so we have a lot in common.",
        "Q: Were you interested in getting married at that time?",
        "A: Yeah, I was. I was ready to. I wasn\u2019t economically ready, but figure well, some way\nwe'll sa -- get along. She worked. I was making about 65 dollars a week and she was\nmaking 30 dollars a week. But s-she -- I -- kidding, I -- I told her -- she got herself\npregnant, see? She says, yeah, she got herself preg -- an-and she fell, she would go by the\nstreetcar to work and she fell off, injured herself. But she went to doctors, she\u2019s pregnant,\nso she quit her job, she worked only a few weeks. But somehow we survived on -- on my\nsalary. She never worked since. We -- We lived there for a year, in Boston. We had my\nbachelor apartment, one room studio apartment, a highrise, like. The bed that doubles\ninto a -- so-sofa that doubles into a bed. And we had this table there [indecipherable] a\ngate-like table, it opens up to seat 12. We had party, had 12 people for dinner. There was\na kitchenette and a bathroom, and we managed somehow. After a year, we took -- I\ngraduated and I looked for a job and again, it was very difficult to get -- they used to start\na junior in accounting at that time for half what I was getting my job. So finally, we -- we\nwent -- she had an uncle in Pittsfield, we went to visit them. He wa -- H-He died, but his\nwidow and the kids were -- the son was there, his business, he wanted to go partner and I\nwas not cut out to be this kind of business. But I was looking for an office job. So,\nnothing came of it. It was -- the [indecipherable], then we stopped in Portland, we went\nby train. We stopped in Portland, because she had an aunt here also. And her husband --\nshe was very lonely, she was a sick woman. Her husband was a doctor and he was\noverprotective. She didn\u2019t go out, she was sitting in the house, and -- and she was very --\nshe just fell in love with our little girl. We had a little girl, three months old. She said,\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you move to Portland?\u201d So jokingly, I say, \u201cAll right. Find me a job and we\nmove to Portland.\u201d Came home and in two days she calls me, couple interviews. I came\nand I worked -- I got on this job of office manager for a large furniture store that had --\nsmall chain, they had three stores. Did the bookkeeping and took care of the shipping and\neverything, except selling. Selling I never could do, never knew how. So, I worked for\nthem for 13 years. And then same time, I built up -- I took in some tax work, it was\nevenings, I was working sec -- six days and two evenings, the store was open. And\nfinally I said, I want to work only 40 hours. Because I got enough to do besides that. And\nthen I gave them notice and I am trying to open my own office. So, luckily, the auditor --\nour auditor died -- luckily, I feel -- it so happened, 1t was [indecipherable] feel bad, he\nwas a nice man. And this -- this was my first substantial account, I took it over. Was, you\nknow, tack -- 1t was -- he died just before he got to do audit -- to prepare the tax returns\nfor the -- for the year. So, at age 50, I left a job, which paid a decent salary, to go on my\nown. I didn\u2019t get along with the manager, the manager thought that I am after his job,\nwhich I never -- never intended to. Afterward, we became very good friends -- after I\nquit. And he died also and the -- the fellow I worked for was a very rich man by\nstandards of 40 years ago --yeah, almost 40 -- and he -- he didn\u2019t have any children. So\nall his money that he left, went into a foundation -- a charitable foundation, he was a very\ncharitable man. And I was appointed the trustee to this foundation. So until this day, I\n[indecipherable] enough, and it was a little less than a million now, so about a million\nand a half dollars. And we give away in between 80 and 100,000 dollars a year to\ncharities, to local [indecipherable] of all, religious synagogue he belonged to -- he built a\nsynagogue and a Hebrew day school. And then the Maine Medical Center, which used to\nbe that time, the [inaudible] they used that -- wait a minute, now it\u2019s Maine Medical\nCenter. And he [indecipherable] fund all the Jewish and non-Jewish. [indecipherable] be\nhaving a meeting next week, to meet with the supervisory board that has to approve our\ngrants. We have no -- no -- we cannot -- all we can do, approve or not approve, but I\nmean, the power of the [indecipherable] is ours, myself and one more trustee, which I\nappointed. There was a -- a relative of his before, and he died, so I appoint another in the\nback of three trustees. Until this day, we give away a lot of money. Built the -- Now, they\nare fixing the cemetery where he is buried. We pledged them 50,000 dollars. And the\nHebrew school, which was -- they\u2019re trying to revive, it doesn\u2019t work. Not enough\nparents, [indecipherable] but now this year, there\u2019s a lot of young people who want their\nki-kids to have a Hebrew education, trying to revive this Hebrew day school, a school\nwhich gives secular end religious education. And we gave them 45,000 dollars, too. A\nmatching grant, they have to -- can raise another 45 to get the an educator and an\norganizer to try to get the school. So, this is another thing I\u2019m busy with.",
        "Q: Has --",
        "A: What -- What I\u2019m busy now is with the Holocaust Center.",
        "Q: Ha-Has your work been, and your career been an important part of your life?",
        "A: Very much so, certainly. I -- I always -- since I -- we came to Portland\n[indecipherable] couple of years when I -- before I settled -- after I settled, became\nknown and I started working, I was appointed to the [indecipherable] board. So I have\nbeen active in every Jewish organization in town. And the one -- for a few years I was in\nthe Toastmaster\u2019s International. I was treasurer -- always treasurer, never president. And -\n- So I was busy. The -- Then the immigrants start coming and the city need -- needed\ninterpreters for several -- I -- I was registered, I told you yesterday, _ f-for -- I was\ninterpreter of five languages. There\u2019s Hebrew, Yiddish, there\u2019s Russian, Ukrainian and\nPolish. I worked in all of them. I even -- I wo-worked with Czechs, I don\u2019t know Czech,\nbut is similar to Polish, so -- and they didn\u2019t have anybody. Then I worked to some\nBulgarians, was like Russian. Very similar to Russian. And then I worked with the group\n-- with the -- our sister city is Ar-Archangel, so we used -- exchanged immigrations\nevery year and I used to work with them to go visit, to translate for them. They were very\nhappy with me, they liked it, because they had -- I came in once and they had one -- one\ngroup, they were, I told you, tourist group. I worked with them. We have no problem. But\nthere\u2019s another group, I think it\u2019s fisheries. [indecipherable] the fishing industry. And\nthere was a fellow sitting there -- he -- their interpreter, with two big dictionaries and he\nwanted to transfer some -- translate something, started looking up. So I very seldom had\nto look up a word. Now I -- I can -- can\u2019t remember, but 10 years ago, five years ago, I\nstill could remember. And then I heard them say, \u201cWe were lucky, we got a very good\ninterpreter [indecipherable].\u201d So, the other group came over to me and asked me to try to\ndo something, I says, \u201cI -- I cannot mix in, you know. They -- You have your -- it\nwouldn\u2019t -- wouldn\u2019t be nice to, you know, try to mix in to somebody else\u2019s business,\u201d I\nsays. Th-They had one Russian who spoke some English, so somehow they got along all\nright.",
        "Q: And was this all volunteer work, your interpreting?",
        "A: All volunteer, all volunteer. No pay -- used to do some quite often [indecipherable |\npick you up [indecipherable] hospital or jail, police, immigration department. A lot of\nwork. And got busy and Rochelle busy now, speaking with the schools, and I go with\nher. Sometimes I participate in her -- when they ask -- start asking questions. I\u2019m a little\nolder, so I remember what happened. How life was in Poland they want to know, she\ndoes not remember. [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Do you speak about your experience?",
        "A: Yeah. I -- I talk also about -- about resistance, because my brother told me a lot about\n-- it\u2019s a subject that\u2019s not known too well. Very -- Lately, they write something about.\nWas quite a few b -- few books written lately that are -- that seems --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: Tape three, side B, of an interview with Jerry Slivka.",
        "A: And th-there were times when survivors did not want to speak. Now everybody writes\nbooks. Some are good, some are not so good. It\u2019s a -- It\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s a -- So, to be\non the -- it -- it will be a short time before all of us are gone, you know. I am 83. Some\nare a little younger and some a little older. So -- And every so often you hear -- some of\nour friends are gone, died. So, if there\u2019s nothing left, might be forgotten. And it shouldn\u2019t\nbe forgotten. Because it\u2019s still happening, you know, th-the ethnic cleansing, what\u2019s\ngoing on in the former Yugoslavia and all over the world, not just there. And if we don\u2019t\nteach it to the future generations, this might repeat itself. But there\u2019s not compare -- it\nnever happened, such a tragedy, you know, 1-in Jewish history or in an-any oth -- any\nother history, where the -- a -- a -- pr -- people developed a -- designed a program to\ndestroy another people, using all means available to them. For -- For using their\ntechnique, they\u2019re using their sophistication just to kill people. So it never happened\nbefore, and it ha -- we -- so -- so it -- it\u2019s incumbent upon us to see to it that it -- it doesn\u2019t\nhappen again, to anybody. We try to do all we can to prevent it. So, \u2019'm thinking maybe\nI\u2019m doing a very good job, the Maine Holocaust [indecipherable]. But, by the way, we\nare on the internet. We have a page you can look it up.",
        "Q: Will you say a little bit about your relationship with your brother, that\u2019s been an\nimportant --",
        "A: Oh yes, w-we are friends -- the ca -- I wish all brothers would be so close, we\u2019re very\nclose. I have a little problem with him, he\u2019s very generous. We come t -- go out to eat and\nwe fight, who -- who going to pay -- pick up the check, th -- sa -- sa -- somehow I gave in\nwith him. I have a problem now with him. I used to do his tax return. His and his kids. Of\ncourse, I never charged him for it, never dream of charging him. And now I got a co -- I\ngot a computer. Last year, I did my -- my tax re -- did theirs by hand, an-and a friend of\nmine who had a computer did mine on computer. An-And it was a -- came out exactly --\nso, I ga -- I do th -- there\u2019s also my -- my sister-in-law\u2019s aunt, who died a few months\nago, and I did hers. And his daughter, ma -- my niece, has a computer. She -- She\u2019s a\nlawyer now, as a matter of fact, she works -- she has a job, she didn\u2019t want this, you\nknow, rat race law profession, you work 24 hours a day, [indecipherable]. She wants a\njob where she can take her time, she can work out, you know, she\u2019s -- she\u2019s single, she\u2019s\nin her 30\u2019s, and she wants to enjoy life, and go on vacation. So, she got a job now with --\nshe jus -- she graduated -- you know, she -- for a few years she worked and then she went\nto law school, after college. So she just got -- a few years ago, she got her Maine -- New\nHampshire, sh -- well, she clerked for a co -- for a judge in New Hampshire. So she got\nthe New Hampshire -- she passed the New Hampshire Bar, Maine Bar and Massachusetts\nBar. And she works now for a investment firm, Fidelity -- Fidelity Investment, you know,\nit\u2019s one of the largest in the world and she worked there, you know, in the law\ndepartment. She was -- it was legal [indecipherable] legal. So she -- when I got the\nprogram, the program like this, cost me about 30 dollars. I -- I was -- I -- I was the first\naccountant in Maine to use a -- to use a computer for tax returns, 30 years ago. I paid for\na computer, 25,000 dollars. Now you buy it for 2,000. Besides the 25,000, I had to pay\n5,000 for maintenance of the software, changing the tax -- enhancing the programs and so\non. And five for the hardware. Something goes wrong, which it went a lot, now it -- now\nit\u2019s already no problem, but it was as big as -- twice the size of this table. And it made a\nnoise like it was, you know, it had a -- the first printer was like the ball printer, the IBM\ntypewriters had. Now, of course, you buy a computer for -- for 2,000 dollars, it has\neverything. And you buy a program, a tax program, which has 29 states beside the\nfederal, for 30 dollars. And you don\u2019t even need forms, they -- it prints on plain paper.\nRochelle used to come and to help me, she used to collate the forms and they were with --\nwith carbon. You\u2019d get -- all of a sudden, you start mixing up, you know,\n[indecipherable] paper over the carbon, or the printout are wrong. So, anyway, she -- so,\nsh-she took her -- her aunts, you know, my -- my sister-in-law\u2019s aunt, she put her through\n-- from my handwritten, and put it through their computer. So I told them I'll get a\ncomputer myself, you know, not just [indecipherable] don\u2019t do much, just my family.\nSays I -- Pll get a computer and so, this coming year, I will print you out a computer on\nmy computer, you won\u2019t have to -- so, he sends me a check for 3,000 dollars, to -- to pay\nfor the computer. I said, \u201cWhat do you have? I -- I don\u2019t want you to pay for my com --\u201d\nWe-Well, she died, the son died, she says, she would want you to have some of her\nmoney. I says, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s [indecipherable] to leave it for your children.\u201d So I -- I\ncouldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t help it, so I took the check, you know, I -- but I didn\u2019t deposit it. I\ncame home, I tore out the signature and I have it to keep. He calls me up, \u201cI got my\nstatement, didn\u2019t get my check,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to write you a letter, the minute |\ncan learn how to type.\u201d I\u2019m teaching my computer to read my dic -- you know, type my\ndictation, cause I -- I don\u2019t -- I type [indecipherable] finger here. It\u2019s very, very slow. I --\nI use it for e-mail, you know, I still type. But I have to wait. Wh-When we go to Florida,\nwe'll have time to train the computer to recognize my voice and -- and type. So I have a\ndifficult time with he -- with him. He\u2019s very generous. And he -- I can -- I cannot fight\nwith him. [indecipherable] is not a fighter, actually, but -- so I -- I have to write him a\nletter. Explain to him I don\u2019t want any -- any money matters between us. W-We are very\ndevoted to each other as we -- we -- we -- as much as we see -- we can see each other.\nWe have problem [indecipherable] so -- so, when he comes here, because Rochelle\nmakes -- usually she makes dinner and sometimes when we go out of course, I have a\ngood excuse. You are my guest, so I pay. But he come there [indecipherable], he was in\nFlorida and came to us for a week the first time, because her aunt used to be sick, she too-\ntook care of her mo -- better than a daughter. Was very, very sick, she wa -- survived\nAuschwitz and Rochelle -- that\u2019s how Rochelle met her. She went to see a friend of hers\nin the hospital and she met her own -- my -- my sister-in-law\u2019s aunt. We became friends.\nSo you can imagine, after the war, she was so sick that they carried her. She weighed\nabout 50 pounds. Nobody expected she survived. But she survived, she married, couldn\u2019t\nhave any children. And he died, she\u2019s -- was my age. She just died a few months ago. So,\nwe are getting along fine.",

If I\nwould have come there originally, just like anybody else, I would have adapted myself to\nthis life. Now I couldn\u2019t. My daughter did, though. She -- I am amazed. When she left for\nIsrael, we gave her six months.

So, after she\ngraduated, she didn\u2019t know what -- so she wanted to go to a graduate school. She was\nconsidering either law or journalism. And then she decided she will go to Israel and see\nwhat\u2019s going on. They were looking for teachers and social workers -- English teachers.\nAnd she had a teaching certificate from Brandeis. That\u2019s all she had. And she went there,\nstarted teaching and she hated. For a year, she was in absorption center, learning the\nlanguage.

        "A: I had -- Well, I was never religious, but I had religious background, I knew about\nreligion, I knew the Bible backward and forward. And I learned it since I was three years\nold, I knew it. I always had a kind of a -- I don\u2019t know how to describe my relationship\nwith religion. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- Rochelle has a hate - love, mostly hate. We -- We have\nproblem when I discuss it with her, I say, \u201cAll right, G-God, if he did do the Holocaust,\nyou know, if G-God did the Holocaust, all right, I can understand your hating him. But at\nthe same time, you agree that He exists. He or She or whatever It is. Because you cannot\nbe -- be mad at something that doesn\u2019t exist, can you?\u201d I partic -- I -- I was active here in\nevery facet of Jewish life in Portland except religious institutions. I belonged to a\nTemple, but I was several times elected to the board, I did not accept it. I did not -- I was\nof the opinion, if you are a leader in a religious organization, you have to at least have set\nsome example of -- of religious practice. And I could not do that. I consider religion --\nJewish religion as part of Jewish culture. It 1s in our past. Is there a God or isn\u2019t a God? I\ncannot determine. | -- I think by my philosophy, I\u2019m agnostic. But I cannot deny -- that\nmeans I cannot deny there isn\u2019t one, nor can there is one. But, the-these tr -- the trappings\nof religion do exist in our culture. This ha -- This is part of our inheritance. We do go on\nhigh holidays. I go, when I have chance, practically every Saturday here, when I\u2019m in\nPortland. And in Florida, there is a big synagogue and you don\u2019t just -- there -- you\u2019re\nnot welcome, as a -- as a Snowbird, w-we are snowbirds. That\u2019s people that stay for the\nseason. They accept membership, you know, for a low fee. Membership are very high\nthere, but for a low fee, for the few months you are there, but they -- you never get --\nyou-you\u2019re a second class member. So we -- I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t join. Once in awhile we go,\nthey had cultural events in the synagogue, shows and concerts, we go there. But that\u2019s\nabout it. Again, to put it in a nutshell, religion is part of our inheritance. I don\u2019t think we\nare ready to give it up yet. The idea would be, if there was one religion, one world\nreligion, where they recognize one force, call it God, call it whatever you want to, a non-\nsectarian. Will it ever be? I don\u2019t know. The Soviet Union tried to suppress religion for\n70 years and they did not succeed. It is strong, it\u2019s alive and people need it in their lives. I\nnever prayed. If I do pray, I pray for national or global salvation. Peace. Very important\nto me. Never -- I never prayed God for myself, help me get a good job, or -- I don\u2019t think\nthis power, which we call God, is designed for individual concern. I envy people that can\nhave a personal religion. This is my God, I pray, you know, and He answers me. If they\nhave it, more power to them. I cannot do that. I see, when I did the prayers, you know,\nthat we say on the high holidays, it\u2019s poetry. The adulation of a power which we call\nGod, see? I can\u2019t understand why do we have to bless God? This a power -- a omnipotent\npower that blesses us, right? So what -- what does my little blessing -- you know, we say\na blessing, in Jewish life, there are lots of blessings, you know, that -- that 613, it\u2019s what?\nCommandments. We have -- whatever you do, you make a blessing. Blessed are thou,\nyou know [indecipherable] brought forth from the soil. But you have to bring it yourself\nfrom the soil. Gives you th-the -- the tools of doing it, see? So, 1-if it\u2019s a blessing, I have\nto ask for a blessing. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019m more important a creature, as a ment, or any\nother creature. So, I have -- I -- I think I\u2019m in that class by myself. I don\u2019t think anybody\nhas the same -- everybody has his own -- his own belief, his own bi -- philosophy. I don\u2019t\nthink -- I\u2019m sure that others have their own, other kinds of philosophies or -- or beliefs, or\nwhatever and they think that theirs is right. But I -- I would like to see if there\u2019s a\nrelationship -- if there has -- a religion has to exist, let there be one. We -- We consider\nourselves the chosen people. Of course, they say we -- we were chosen to teach other\npeoples, but we taught enough -- yeah, we can taught enough. We -- Everybody knows\nthe Christian Right knows the Bible backward and forward, you know, and they use it\njust for their needs, just what they want. They, you know, they quote. But the other thing,\nthe good things are there, which they do not. So, until -- now, you see, you take the\nMuslim world. Religion is upswing in the Muslim, Jewish and Christian. The same even\nwith India, which was a very tolerant -- you know, the Hindu, mostly Hindu, we\u2019ll talk\nabout the -- what do you call it? Eastern religions --",
        "Q: Buddhists?",
        "A: Buddim -- Buddhism and the -- the Hindu I think was th-the most liberal one. They\ntolerated other religions. But they -- Now they -- they -- they developed atomic bomb\ninto the Hindu bomb. The -- Pak-Pakistan developed a atomic bomb and it is the Muslim,\nIslamic bomb. So Israel will have a Jewish bomb and Russia has a Russian bomb and we\nstart bringing in religion into politics. The greatest -- The greatest danger to the world 1s\nwhen we come on behalf, we c -- we represent God. [indecipherable] my God, you know.\nThe Germans had on their buckles of the -- the belts, God metoons, God 1s with us. The\nCzars had the same thing in Russian, see? So, th-this is the -- the greatest danger is when\nreligion -- when somebody thinks that he represents the right religion and the others --\noth-others do not. So, unless it is a -- a global religion, one that recognizes the right of\nman, human beings, man [indecipherable]. We have now a rabbi, a woman rabbi and they\ngo and hire a woman cantor. And some women don\u2019t like two women on the pulpit -- on\nthe, you know, stage there. Women. What\u2019s the difference it make if you -- if you have\nthe same rights, why not? They are -- They\u2019re more than 50 percent of population now\nare women. The most important people in my life are women. I have a wife. I have two\ndaughters, I have three granddaughters and three grandsons. So I hope I -- I hope I -- y-\nyou get the gist of what I am talking about, because I myself don\u2019t get it too clear.",
        "Q: I have just one more question I think, and then if you want to add anything, but it -- do\nyou think you can sum up, or explain something about how the -- your experiences living\nthrough the Holocaust in the wartime years ha-has affected your outlook on life?",
        "A: Oh, it affected me greatly. I -- I -- I lived through unusual times, unusual periods of\nhistory. I lived -- Don\u2019t forget, I was born in a -- during the first World War, that\u2019s 83\nyears ago. There was no electricity in the town I lived, til the day I left it. There was one\nfor -- in the flour mill, it had electricity just for the -- for the -- for one house in the -- the\n-- in the mill. And I came fr-from -- from the wagon, you know, horse and wagon -- horse\nand buggy, from the railroad -- from the -- the invention of electricity to space travel.\nThey were all during my lifetime. Telephone, which I don\u2019t understand eve -- still, how it\nworks, see -- was invented by the time why I was born. I am operating a computer and I\ncan get into a network which has -- I\u2019m trying to find one -- one subject, Yiddish, a\nlanguage of a people which is gone, almost a dead language. It\u2019s trying to be revived by\nnon-Jews studying it. And -- And there\u2019s 590 pages on the computer about Yiddish.\nThere\u2019s thousands of thousands and thousands of pages about science an-and then things\nwhich in my little laptop -- so, I am a product of a -- probably that covered a civilization\nwhich did not change from the fifte -- 1500\u2019s to the 2,000\u2019s. In the span of my lifetime,\nthese things happened. I used to go from -- with the wagon of bu -- a horse and buggy\nfrom Povorsk, from my -- the town where they lived, to Koven, to buy merchandise,\nwhich 1s three -- 33 kilometers. Seven -- 16 miles, all night. Course, there were no paved\nroads, it was sand, it was very difficult to get there. I go now to Israel, 6,000 miles, in the\nsame time, by plane. So, and -- and I still cannot digest it, I cannot understand it. And I\nfind that the -- the human race is way ahead in it\u2019s technology, but way behind in it\u2019s\nconception of life, all together. I think, if you made this much progress, 1-1f you could\nhave made this much progress 1n -- in our lifes with each other, the people\u2019s, countries,\nthe systems, religions, if you could find a way to regulate our lifes to the same measuring\nstick as the technology went, we should be wonderful and be -- be able to get along fine.\nAnd it\u2019s getting worse. That\u2019s what bothers me. I am worried that my grandchildren will\nrun out of food by the time they\u2019re grown up. And I know what it means being hungry. I\nwouldn\u2019t wish it on anybody. An-And the same time, you think -- yo-you don\u2019t see them,\nso you don\u2019t think of them, but the way I do think of it. There are millions of peop --\nchildren every day, die from hunger -- starvation. Every day in the world. Some are\nworried that they got too many people being born. And the same time, the same people\nare dying every day. And -- And I -- I am worried about what -- what will happen, you\nknow, with the developed countries and undeveloped countries. You can see now people\ncoming into the United States, you cannot stop that. You know, from other cultures. But\nnot so much culture, they come from the next door, from Mexico, who cannot --no living\nthere. And th-the world is getting so small. And -- And the -- the means of destruction are\ngetting so awesome, that who knows what will happen? I am worried, worried. And I\nthink something should be done. Course I [indecipherable] one person cannot do much. I\nwish I had the -- the gift of writing -- perhaps write a book about it, what -- what bothers\nme. But I don\u2019t -- This doesn\u2019t answer you question actually, does it? Your questions of\nwhat did I --",
        "Q: It starts to. [indecipherable] H-How --",
        "A: | -- I cannot give you an answer and I ca -- I -- I can -- I can raise a lot of questions on\nyour question. But how to solve it, I don\u2019t know. There is sitting now a group of people\nin -- in -- in Washington, the same race, believers of one God. They have wa -- wa -- one\nprophet more than we have, see, and -- and they cannot get along. Similar\n[indecipherable], similar languages. Same race. Same race. And we can\u2019t find the way to\n-- to settle their differences. And again, is it because it\u2019s my God 1s -- is the true God and\nI -- the -- the -- there\u2019s a -- there\u2019s a -- a little mountain and -- and a hill in Jerusalem,\nwhere the Jewish Temple stood. And there are Jews that want to build another Temple.\nBut we have been away from there a thousand years -- 2,000 years, and they built another\nsanctuary there. Why can\u2019t people live side by side? It -- It worries me a great deal. Now,\nof course, I have no -- I have no worries about making a living, even though I have\nnightmares. I have very strange nightmares. I -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t have -- I don\u2019t know\nwhere my next meal is coming from. I\u2019m hungry and I haven\u2019t got a few dollars to buy\nmyself a loaf of bread. Which -- It happened during my lifetime. And I -- And I get up,\nyou know, it wakes me up and I really thank God that I ha -- I have -- the refrigerator\u2019s\nfull. And I have, you know, what to live on. And so that the -- the -- the -- the threat 1s\ngone. But I fall asleep and the same -- the same would continue.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning of Tape Four, Side A",

        "Q: That\u2019s interesting to hear you say you think that a lot of the success of the survivors in\nthe United States has been motivated by that.",
        "A: Consciously or subconsciously, but it was a part of it. Could -- a lot -- we\naccomplished a lot -- some born Americans did -- could not accomplish, who had all the\nadvantages of language and upbringing and education and we -- we did it.

And this is the most important -\n- the most important things in our lives are -- are the children and grandchildren. We\nhope they retain being Jewish, not because we are better than other people, but we are --\nwe are the endangered species. I would like it to survive. We contributed a lot to the\nworld as Jews.

        "Answer: Yes.",
        "A: Well, our family consists of father and mother and two sisters and two brothers and\nmyself, of course. My father\u2019s name, Hebrew name was Eliakim. In Polish, he was\nYakob, which is Jacob, but it\u2019s no -- no connection to the Hebrew name. My mother\u2019s\nname was Rosa -- Raisil in Yiddish, but the Polish name was Rosa.",
        "A: Her maiden name was Kirzner. And my brother next to me was Chaim and was born\nin 1917, then we have a sa -- I have the sister, Miriam, who was born 1920. And next\ncame my brother Reuben, who survived the war, still lives in Boston now. And he was\nborn 1922. And had a little sister who was born in 1927. She -- I was 12 years old when\nshe was born.",
        "A: And her name was Hannah.",
        "A: We were very close, we were very close, but my problem was that I did not live at --\nwith all of them all the time, because since I lived in a small village and my father wanted\nme to get some kind of education, which started about three years old. I was shipped off\nto the next town, which was about 12 mile -- 12 kilometers from our town, where there\nwas a teacher. As a matter of fact, my father worked there one year as a teacher, after he\nlost his job, which I talked about in the -- on the videotape. And I used to be away from\nthem for awhile. And later on, I was sent to a high school in Koven, which 1s the big city\nnot far from where we lived. And again, I -- I missed my family. I was there only one\nyear. This was my formal education. And then when I was 16, I left town also, to go in\nsearch of a -- learning a professional job in the city of Lodz. And sin -- fr-from then on, I\nwas away for quite a few years, returned about a year or two before the war came. Then a\nyear before the war, I came -- I -- I got married. A son was born. His -- My wife\u2019s name\nwas Rifka. This was in 1938. I omitted it from my videotape. And my son\u2019s name was\nBenjamin -- Benjamin. He -- He -- He lived only three years. He was born in ni -- you\nknow, we were married in 1938, he was born in 1939 and in 1942, in September, a week\nbefore Rosh Hashanah, the 23 days in the month of Ell, Hebrew month, they were all\ntaken out and shot, including my little boy. That\u2019s [indecipherable] was my family.",
        "A: This was in that -- in a village called Povorsk, which we visited two years ago. I think\nmy wife told you about a visit to -- the trip there.",
        "A: Yeah, well, it started with Povorsk. A -- I -- I was not there when the tragedy\nhappened. I was in the Soviet Union, working a coal mine. And I found out about -- I\nknew -- I -- I -- the Soviet -- I -- I read the Soviet press, even though I worked for a slave\nlabor camp, we had a cultural life. There were -- there was a library with papers and\nbooks which you could read. As a matter of fact, I ha -- even had the privilege of\nsubscribing for -- to -- to the Pravda, one of the Soviet papers, for a short while, for a few\nmonths, because the librarian, who was also a internee like myself, had about half a\ndozen papers he could give, to give us a semblance of kind of freedom and culture. So, he\ngave me the privilege of sur-surpri -- which was dirt cheap, it was pennies. But, to me it\nhad a big value besides reading it, I could read it in the library. But I could sell it\nafterward for the purpose of rolling cigarettes. I, myself, was smoking. And we used to\nhave a kind of -- there was some commerce in the camp. Womens used to come out from\noutside and had a little -- put like a -- a kiosk in the camp. And if you had money, you\ncould buy things. They used to bring in milk, he used to bring in tobacco, which was sold\nby the glass. Actually, that was not even tobacco, it was tobacco roots, which were\nchopped up with an ax and you rolled it in newspaper. Now, once a mon -- once a week, I\nused to sell my bread ration in this commerce in -- intercamp commerce -- intracamp\ncommerce, and buy tobacco. But I had to buy a newspaper. A newspaper cost 10 rubles.\nSo, when I had five newspapers or six newspapers a week, I could sell five of them and\none use for my own needs and with others I used to get the 50 rubles and use it to buy the\ntobacco roots, see? So, while I had it, I was in very good shape, financially. I didn\u2019t have\nto sell my bread ration. So -- and in the press, there wasn\u2019t much about the Final\nSolution. The Soviet press didn\u2019t write much about it, they wrote about atrocities\ncommitted against the Soviet people, none that mentioned Jews. Of course the particular\nJews [indecipherable] designed to be exterminated. But -- And they knew about it, of\ncourse, but they didn\u2019t -- I remember when the revolt broke out in the Warsaw ghetto,\nthere was a little column, one column, but about four or five inches tall, about a revolt in\nthe Warsaw ghetto, which was liquidated by -- the Warsaw ghetto was liquidated by the\nGerman -- the German occupiers. Not mentioning much about just one word to the Jews.\nThe ghetto, of course, they had to mention the ghetto, because there\u2019s only one kind of a\nghetto, a Jewish ghetto. So they mentioned it. So there wasn\u2019t much about it. But one\nday, when the forces -- the Soviet forces approached not far from where my town was\nlocated, I wrote a letter from camp to the -- somebody in the ci -- town council, asking if\nthere\u2019s any information about my family. It so happened that the town was not liberated\nyet. It was still -- there was still the -- the -- the front was there in the -- the next city. For\nquite awhile, places changed hands back and forth, but I -- another town close to it, was\nalready liberated. And a friend of mine, who was a former partisan, where my brother\nwas also a partisan of the sa -- the same place, the same time. He was already liberated\nand he was working in the post office. And when they saw my name -- my return address,\nwith my name on it, he opened the letter and he sent it to my brother. He read it, sent to\nmy brother and my brother answered it. And he -- he just wrote me that he is -- he knows\nthat he -- he 1s -- he 1s alive, everything 1s -- all is well. He works now as -- doing -- as a\nguard in an NK VD, secret -- secret police farm. And he sent me -- he would sent me\nsome money. Course, they used to speculate theirselves by [indecipherable] and he knew\nthat I was in bad shape, so he send me some money. A few days later, I got a letter from\none of my friend -- a former brother-in-law of mine, as a matter of fact, and then his\nbrother, describing what happened and how it happened and who survived and did not\nsurvive. So I knew -- then I find out what happened. And I had in mind that my wi -- in\n1945, after the war, the Poles and the Soviets conclude an agreement to let -- this ha -- by\nthe way, this information is in the videotape, but I\u2019m telling you so you understand what I\nam talking about -- had an agreement to let all of those who were former Polish citizens,\ntil \u201839, coo -- provided they are Jews or Poles, not Ukrainians or Russians, could get out,\nback to Poland. And after a year, they find -- this is a long story, but doesn\u2019t make any\nsense, it repeats again. I left the Soviet Union, you know, and then came to Poland. But, I\nha -- I thought [P\u2019ll be able to go by this town and see what -- you know, where the place\nwas, at least, fo-found out what happened. But luckily, luckily, I could not stop there,\nbecause th-they routed me through a different way, through Belarus, through Minsk and -\n- but I always dreamed about coming back to Povorsk and putting up a monument, which\nwas impossible during Soviet days. First of all, they didn\u2019t allow any monuments which\nspecifically said Jews perished there. Soviet citizens, yes, but not Jews. So, 1-1n -- in --\nand at that time, this -- this was a very dangerous place to be, because Ukrainian\nnationalists already harassed the Soviet army and killed the Jews, just like the Poles did\nafter the war, yeah. So, is good that they did not go through. But I -- I -- It was a kind of -\n- became an obsession for me to come and put up a monument. Now, when you co -- then\nthey st -- they started allowing already do -- before Gorbachov\u2019s time already, they start\nallowing put up with and even in Yiddish or in Hebrew, what happened -- descriptions on\nthese monuments, and they allowed to have Jews. I don\u2019t know if you know about that\npol -- a Soviet write up of the name of Viefter Schenko, who wrote a poem about,\n\u2018\u201cThere\u2019s no monument in Babier,\u201d which is Kiev -- probably heard about it. And he\nwrote he\u2019s ashamed being a Russian, that they did not allow to put up m-monuments in\nthese places, so they did allow, finally they did allow. And then, in the beg -- middle of\nthis decade, since \u201895, I think, Ukraine became independent and they allowed, already.\nAnd there was a fellow in our -- 1n -- in the -- in the province there, who, as a matter of\nfact, he\u2019s -- he -- he was the -- the -- the secretary of the Communist party in the -- in the\n-- yeah, he was half Jewish, too, but he didn\u2019t -- he said himself Ukrainian. And he\nstarted putting up this monument with government help, first Soviet and then the\nindependent Ukraine. I got in touch with him, I found out there is in Israel a organization,\nit\u2019s called the House of Waleen. Waleen is the name of the province which has records of\nmany. There\u2019s probably, in that part, hundreds of thousands of Jews perished. They\ndidn\u2019t send them to -- to concentration camps, they killed them right then and there. In\nour town, it was exploded dump, oil dump that the Soviets built and they exploded it and\nthen they used it for when they killed th-the German [indecipherable] they dump the Jews\nin there, you know. And this is the place -- so it was a military zone, belonged to the\narmy. And you could not go into any place in army during Soviet days. They agreed\ntheyll let us put up the monument. We -- We -- We a-agreed on a price with -- how\nmuch it\u2019ll cost. But it came the day when they\u2019re supposed -- already the monument is\nready and they decided nyet, they\u2019re not allowed to on the mili-military. So, I -- finally it\nwas ready, we are ready to go in 19 -- in 19 -- this was what, 60, now is 90 -- 98 and 96.\n95, we had a date and I had a group, the -- a woman from the local -- well, W -- WMG --\nGME, I think it is. That used to be WGAM. This is affiliate of CBS. No, wait a minute,\nwas NBC. NBC, ABC, what\u2019s it, the other one?",
        "A: CBS, yeah, CBS, with a cameraman and a reporter. Reluctantly the station agreed to\npay her expenses, she wanted to go very badly, but you couldn\u2019t go, because they said\nthey wouldn\u2019t allow to -- later on I found out they did allow it, make a long story short,\nand we -- we scheduled a trip for the next year, 1960 -- 96, yeah. I had a group of about\n12 people. There was myself, my wife and my daughter from Louisiana. The one from\nIsrael couldn\u2019t make it, she couldn\u2019t get vacation at that time, which I hope by next year\nto take her and some of my grandchildren, [indecipherable]. And we f -- and two women,\none -- both of them lived in New York, one now is in Boston and the other one works in\nNew York, daughters of survivors. And then there was another son of survivors, whose\nfather was a partisan with my brother. My brother and his wife and his three children,\nmade a group of 12 people. And a friend of mine who lives in Warsaw came with us and\nRochelle, of course. And we came -- we visited Warsaw. We went to Povorsk, this town.\nWe -- I have some pictures, I'll show you, of this. I also have a tape from that time, to all\n-- put this all in. We were met by the officials of the local government -- the head of the\nlocal council and by the officials, the hea -- the head of the -- deputy chairman of the\nregional council, which probably that\u2019s about 20 to 30 village -- like a county,\napproximately, here. Went with us with -- they -- we rented a bus and we stayed at a\nhotel, without cold water. My wife probably told you about the toilets [indecipherable]\ntell you. And we stayed there two days. We visited this town, we put up the monument.\nWe made -- you know, dedicated -- dedicated the monu -- the monument was standing\nalready. It was -- had the description of Hebrew, Ukrainian and -- and English, not in\nYiddish. And we started talking among ourselves, my friend from Poland, this --\nremarked it should be in Yiddish also, even though nobody can understand, nobody can\nread it, we are here, you know, the few of us old ones to understand, will be gone soon.\nSo we commissioned him, developer there, to put -- and we gave a few hundred more\ndollars, to put up the -- I had my -- the inscription in Yiddish, I had prepared all the -- all\nof them, all the descriptions. So I gave him a copy of it and he sent me a photo that it\u2019s\nalready there, it\u2019s put on. They also decided to -- we decided it needs a wider, more --\nunder the -- what do you call it?",
        "A: The base, but --",
        "A: No, well you put under the house, what\u2019s under the house?",
        "A: Foundation. A wider foundation because it might topple. It looks good. It was a\nbeautiful [indecipherable]. So, we visited there one day and the same day we went to -- to\nmore neighboring towns. One, the town where I was born, and --",
        "A: Which was called Threeanoffka, Threeanoffka. And the -- there is a monument they\nput up themselves, place it is sa -- they say 345 Jews were buried there. I don\u2019t know who\ncounted them, but that\u2019s what they did. It\u2019s in Hebrew and in Ukrainian. But in this town,\nthere is a Jewish cemetery, par-part of which survived, ironically, a -- a cemetery that\nsurvives here, because the -- most cemeteries didn\u2019t. But, after the day, I was so -- we as -\n- we have to go to another town, we had relatives there and the -- one of the participants,\n[indecipherable] his parents lived there. So, there was already late and he talked me in,\nth-the fellow that put up the [indecipherable] talked me into go. Not -- It was only a few\nminutes away, I realized afterward. So, hopefully I'll go there again next year. And there,\nI know, there\u2019s a -- there\u2019s some stones still standing, one -- including I know one from\nmy grandmother, my paternal grandmother is buried there. And all -- all my relatives are\nburied there that died naturally, you know, the -- over generations. I don\u2019t know how\nmuch of it is left though, but I can\u2019t wait to see it. And we went to another town, where\nthere about -- over 3,000 people buried. And we came back to the big city, city where I\nwent to high school, we came to the hotel and we lied down there fo -- to have a nap, to\nhave supper late -- oh, yeah, th -- I didn\u2019t tell you about this story. They invited us to\ndinner.",
        "A: The -- The officials invite us to dinner and there might have been about 20 people\nthere. The commandant of the base and his little girl and a few other people, th-the driver,\nthe photographer. We had -- We had the video photographer, yeah. Whom -- For whom,\nyou know, we paid, but it -- pennies, you know, si -- their -- their currency was so -- it\nwas 280,000 rubles. Ukrainian rubles, not Russian rubles, because [indecipherable] at\nthat time, forpa dollars, stack like this. And -- And the vodka flow -- flowed like water,\nyou know, and we had borsht and we had pilmani, which 1s Jewish, kreplach, you know.\nFamiliar dishes. And -- And pork. This was [indecipherable] bread, great br-bread was\ngood. And steak, it was kind of a cook steak and a -- it was good, was a good meal. And\nthey made speeches and of course, whoever spoke. I spoke, during the dedication of the\nmonument. I\u2019ll show you, if you have -- if you\u2019 Il have time, I\u2019Il show you part of it. You\nmight get the -- the feeling what -- how it was there. And we said some prayers, and the\nKaddish. So, when we came back to the hotel -- the hotel was a beautiful building with --\nnice and clean, nice bed, but there\u2019s no cold wa -- no hot water, cold water, so you\ncouldn\u2019t take a shower. So we lied down, we think it\u2019Il be later on -- this was already\nwhat, six, seven o\u2019clock, have to have a nap, because it\u2019s so em-emotionally charged you\nknow, and then -- and then the -- physically tired and exhausted. So we lied down for --\nfigure for about an hour and figure then we\u2019 ll go out and have dinner or supper, whatever\n[indecipherable]. We woke up eight o\u2019clock in the morning, without -- and dress\n[indecipherable]. That\u2019s how we -- tired we were. So then we went to Warsaw and from\nWarsaw, we split, my brother and his family -- and his family went to Lodz, where my\nsister-in-law was born, with their kids. His name was Reuben, her name was -- is Bella\nand the three kids was Ruth and Allen and -- and Audrey. And the two girls went to\nFrance, to have a good time, to Paris. And we went to Vilna with Rochelle, she told you\nabout this trip, very, very emotional. So that\u2019s how we -- then we came back to Warsaw,\nbecause there\u2019s no direct flights from Vilna, or -- so they had to go through Warsaw and\nmy -- my friend, who was -- who prepared dinner for us, it happened to be our\nanniversary. This was June 22nd. We went on the 17th, th-this was June 22nd, which 1s --\nturned to -- our wedding anniversary, it\u2019s also the anniversary of the beginning of the war\nbetween Germany and Russia -- Soviet Union, 19 -- 1942. And from Vilna, we came\nback to Warsaw, stayed a couple of days. Warsaw, of course, is a beautiful city. I knew\nWarsaw from before the war. It looks exactly the way it did look and -- and sa --\nimproved. They have nice set of -- of cross the busy sections, you had underground\nshopping centers like, underground. And if you cross, you know Mashallkosco is the\nmain street, you go under -- you cannot cross the street. And the -- the -- the traffic is\nunbelievable, it looked beautiful. And the situation, my sister-in-law told me Lodz was\nnot as good. Warsaw\u2019s fine, but the -- the countryside is not -- not good. Economic\nsituation not good. But through, of course we were interest -- we went -- I went to look at\nthe ghetto and I had an uncle and an aunt and cousins living there. And there\u2019s nothing.\nEmpty, but signs -- signs of streets that don\u2019t exist and signs of bunkers where the -- the\nWarsaw ghetto fighters came out or went into the sewers. Lamila, aiteen and some other\nplaces. Of course, it\u2019s -- it affected us very badly. The rest of the city is beautiful, except\nthe ghetto, nothing there.",
        "A: My -- My parents, my two sisters and then one brother was killed in the partisan\ngroup.",
        "A: This was Chaim, the second oldest, after me. H-He was, you know, there was a group\nthat came out -- I\u2019m repeating the same thing you have already, on the videotapes, a\ngroup of Jewish boys and girls came out just days before, they\u2019re prepared already,\nweeks before, to leave the town, because Poles didn\u2019t have a ghetto. There were -- There\nused -- The -- The -- There was one -- one German in town, Usunderfuerer. He was a\ngood man, helped a lot of Jews. But the -- his official thing was to -- to collect whatever\nhe could, you know, the furs, gold, anything of -- of value from the Jews. And then he\nhad the Jews working in this exploded oil dump, to squeeze out the oil that seeped\nthrough into the sand. Cause this is pra -- what was high -- high octane fuel -- aviation\nfuel, yeah, when the Soviets exploded it. An-And they had to turn it in, but at the same\ntime, they used to steal some of it, in bottles, in su -- having the coat and put it under the\ncoat. And they -- For a year, they lived from that. They used to exchange it with the\npeasants, which used it for -- for lightning fuel, you know, for kerosene. They found a\nway, because this was very dangerous, they have to put some salt in it. And salt was very,\nvery expensive. Salt is -- was a -- you know, ver -- at a higher value than gold, salt. Th-\nTheir -- Their diets require a lot of sa -- well, everybody, Europeans need a lot of salt. So\nfor the preserving pork you had to need sa -- you need salt. And to -- for cooking, for\nanything, you need salt. So salt was very expen -- but still, they put in some salt and they\ncould use kerosene lamps. There was no electricity in that region. So that\u2019s what they did.\nSo, for a year, they were not molested. Well, they were, but not to -- to such an extent as\nin other cities. The Ukrainian police was the worst, of course. There was no Germans in\ntown, they were at the front. Only this one German. A friend of mine was his orderly.\nUsed to do the -- in the day when they killed the Jews, he -- he t-told them, \u201cTake this\nhorse out to the field, this horse.\u201d In -- In other words, he gave him opportunity to run\naway and he did survive this way. So -- And the rest of the towns, and my wife\u2019s parents\n-- the brothers escaped -- three brothers escaped, one -- and the fourth one 1s -- oh -- there\n-- she had four brothers and three of them escaped. One of them escaped with the -- he\nworked for the Soviet railroad. Later on, he was accused that he let the one train run with\nthe other -- Soviet -- the Soviet law is very strict and they put him 1n jail and he died in\njail. You know that. And many friends -- we didn\u2019t have any more relatives in this town,\nmy relatives lived in the next town, which I told you about, Rhiannoffka. And\neverywhere there was my relatives there.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s very difficult to describe it, but I\u2019ll try. We were -- I didn\u2019t recognize\nth-the -- the village. This changed entirely, the roads are different. They are paved roads,\nthey weren\u2019t in those days. And we came -- we lived near the railroad station, about a\nhundred meter or a hundred yards from the railroad, right across. And there was a water\ntower. Railroad -- Belonged to the railroads, was for the purpose of filling the\nlocomotives with water. It was, in that time, all locomotives were all coal -- coal and\nsteam. So it needs lots of water. There was a pipeline from -- from the -- from a lake,\nabout three kilometers away, about two miles approximately, to this water tower. And\nfrom u -- the water towers was between the railroad and us, which is as close as from\nhere to Wayside Road. And there\u2019s nothing there. Our houses were -- a matter of fact,\nthey have a picture of our house. It\u2019s -- Somebody found it and I don\u2019t know where they\ngot it, sent it to -- to a friend of mine in Israel.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Yeah, well, half of the house is on this picture. And then the three neighbor\u2019s houses -\n- four neighbor\u2019s houses, five -- five or six neighbor\u2019s house in same row. And then there\nwas a flour mill, which 1s -- this -- it\u2019s not there. Nothing there now. Behind that, about\n20 yards away, there\u2019s a whole new section built of new homes. And I have the suspicion\nthey were built from the materials of these houses. They didn\u2019t want to live in these\nhouses, you know, in case somebody claims them or what. E-Even though they thought\neverybody died anyway. But, it would better, you know, to pull them apart and build new\nhouses. So, I have -- I will show you that picture. In the front there, 1n this picture, the\nfront of the houses, there\u2019s military vehicles. I don\u2019t know was tanks or half tracks or\nsomething like that. And I don\u2019t -- maybe they are Polish or they are Soviet. It looked\nlike it\u2019s a wide -- wide picture. It looked like sake -- taken by -- either by the military or\nby some other coun -- I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not the amateur or a regular photographer\npicture. It looked like the scroll, it was rolled up into a storn, what it is fixed and I cou -- I\nrecognized the houses. And we were standing there and nothing there. Th-The -- The\nwhole -- The whole -- The whole trip was very emotional. We got on a train in Warsaw\nand I knew I -- many times I was traveling this, from Warsaw to -- from -- not so from\nWarsaw, ulefell from Lodz, travel mi -- and I knew every station, I knew every town.\nAnd every one of them had Jewish people there. They -- Probably 70 - 80 - 90 percent,\nsome of them were Jewish, the -- the peasants lived in the villages. Jews lived in the\nsmall towns, so called shtetla, see, and some bigger cities. In the city, you were -- Koven,\nwhere I went to school, which 1s not far from Povorsk, had a population of about 30,000 -\n22 to 25,000 were Jewish. And this -- Now, it\u2019s a cit-city of 60,000, and there isn\u2019t a\nsingle Jew. And the city was completely destroyed in the war and rebuilt by the Soviets,\nyou know, in these drab, long multi-story buildings, which fall a -- which started to fall\napart the minute they were built, and they\u2019 re still -- so it wa -- this was very emotional.\nIn time, you come to the station, I knew that station. The station was rebuilt exactly the\nway it was before the war. Looks -- This was a beautiful station and it still looks\nbeautiful, til you come into it. You see there -- Rochelle had to go to the bathroom in the\nhole in the floor, she -- with a half partition in between the men and the women. Luckily,\nour daughter went in with her, so she could help her to get up. She has problem with her\nback. Otherwise, I know what would happen there. And there -- the -- the -- there\u2019s the\nbazaar, you can buy anything you want, there\u2019s no -- nothing in the store, there is no\nstores. One or two stores in the whole city. Used to be a lively, you know, commercial\ncenter, nothing. I don\u2019t know, there might be a few Jews. Somebody said there might be\ntwo or three Jews in town, but I -- I never -- the -- nobody came. None of the population\ncame to this dedication, except the officials. And they make speeches about, you know,\ntheir former citizens and former, you know, survivors of the -- the -- and talking about\npeace and love among the nations and so forth and so on. I thanked them for putting up\nthe monument, I thanked them for -- I -- I carried with me a oak seedling, grown from an\nacorn in my backyard, right here. And when I opened it up, they couldn\u2019t -- I -- I\nwrapped it in soil, you know, potting -- like potting soil, that\u2019s wh -- potting soil, what\nthey use, you know, for growing flowers, and they couldn\u2019t -- admired th-the -- the\nbeauty of the soil, you know, such -- looks like rich, fertile soil, because they have sandy\nsoil. Even the Ukraine has beautiful soil. And I planted it there and it is not growing so\ngood, because I got a picture from it -- a friend of -- somebody, a friend of mine in Israel,\nknows a -- non-Jewish, who used to be a neighbor of ours, and they took a picture. And\nmy brother sends them a check every so often and this fellow there sent them packages.\nSo they take care of it. The head of the local council promised that he\u2019Il assign a high\nschool class to take care of it. So, every year I send them a hundred dollars, which is\nthere a fortune. And he wouldn\u2019t answer me, so I -- last year I cal -- finally got his\ntelephone number. I couldn\u2019t reach him at his pla -- place o -- office. So I got from\nsomebody else in his home, I call him, oh, he was very happy that -- but he didn\u2019t write\n[indecipherable] he -- maybe he doesn\u2019t know how to write, I don\u2019t know. But he said\noh, they are taking care of it. I don\u2019t see what they do there, but I can see there\u2019s a -- kind\nof to protect it, like a little cage. But it didn\u2019t grow. The soil is not so good, least probably\nsome fertilizer. We\u2019ll be there next year, be -- I hope. I hope, but with me, it was -- I -- th\n-- th -- this is my -- if I ever accomplished anything in my life, this would be at the -- at\nthe top of it. Most important thing I did. I feel I did something my -- they will approve --\nwould have approved -- th-th-the victims. So, there are some others aware of that and\nwant to hear about it. Some contributed to it. I didn\u2019t want -- it was not decide -- of\ncourse, I would pay for it with myself, see? But I wanted them to participate and to have\na Stake in it, see? And whoever I asked, they contributed some. I didn\u2019t ask, I wrote them\na letter them, if you can and want, contribute. If not, we\u2019ll do it anyway, see? So, sa -- he\nask him, of course, to come visit. Most of them did not want to. Most of -- there\u2019s not too\nmany, there\u2019s only a handful. So this was our trip. She told you about her -- she stood in\nthe middle of the -- middle of the street and cried. Vilna -- I don\u2019t know if she told you,\nVilna was the culture capital -- the -- the cul -- the Jewish -- Jewish culture. This was the\nonly place where there was teacher seminars for Hebrew teachers, Yiddish teachers and\nPolish Yiddish teachers for Vilna -- for high schools. It had a beautiful library called a\nstreshun library. And it had a very active, dynamic, Jewish population from -- from the\nextreme left to the extreme right and the Hasidim -- there were no Hasidim, no, cause\nVil-Vilna is just the opposite. Op -- They opposed Hasidism, see? So, there was a -- the\ngowan of Vilna is -- was a rabbi from the 18th century, 18th or 19th. Yeah, they -- they s-\nstill two streets, they are -- streets of the gowan\u2019s name. Gowan means a genius in\nHebrew, yeah. And there\u2019s the Jewish street. Street of the Jews. Still named so, but\nthere\u2019s no gowan, and no -- the cemetery where her mother was buried is not there,\nthere\u2019s a park there now. But they\u2019re building in this place at -- some -- some broken\nmonuments and they\u2019re trying to build a little monument composed of all these -- that --\nthe pieces that they found.",
        "A: It has been -- no-not a -- 1t was an obsession. I -- I was waiting for the day that it could\nbe -- I had a feeling one days we\u2019ll do it. I had a feeling. It 1s 1t -- I never expected that\nthe Soviet Union will collapse this way. I knew them, I -- they kept everything so strong\nand it would be -- never believed it, but 1t did happen. And I saw that time that I ca -- I\ncan realize my -- my -- my dream. I wanted very badly to do that, you see. I -- I -- I could\nhear -- you know, to this day, when I\u2019m on my lawn, I hear their cries. Th-The noise of\nthe -- of the lawnmower -- I -- I -- I -- when I was sitting in the mine -- when I found out\nwhat happened, I hear their cries. And I -- I -- At that time, I couldn\u2019t even cry myself.\nNow, I can, very easily. But at that time, I couldn\u2019t and I wonder what happened to me,\nwh-wh-where is my human emotions? There were none. | -- There was nobody to talk to\nabout it. It is very difficult to describe the feeling, very difficult. But I hoped to do it. And\nwe did. I hope to be again -- I want all my grandchildren to see it, to remember.",
        "A: No. No, no, no. I -- I felt to everybody the [indecipherable] you know, it was my\nfamily, my friend, my grandmother. My grandmother, in the next town, escaped when\nthey started shooting the -- tha -- surrounding the town, th-the Ukrainian police. This was\na town th-the -- the -- a lot of s-small agriculture. Every house had a garden and my\ngrandmother had a beanstalks, you know, which made it like a maze of -- place you c --\nyou could run away. Not far, bu -- a-and around town, there was a lot of forests. A lot of\nthem escaped to the forest. And my grandmother ran away with two of her grandchildren,\none my namesake. M-My aunts -- cousin of mine. And another cousin of mine who\nsurvived the war was in the partisans, he was a bricklayer. So, they needed in the\npartisans, you know, to build stoves in the -- in these trenches like, see? Those little\nbuildings in a -- in a hole under ground and he used to build these things. And he escaped\nalso to the forest, he found my grandmother na -- the next day, dead, with two kids,\nholding hands. So, I felt obligation to all of them, not -- not just my wife.",
        "A: Well, I -- I told you before, it wa --",
        "A: I tried, I got in touch with these people with the -- ma -- build these monuments. You -\n- They made a business out of it, not just monuments for the Holocau -- in general, they\nput in the import. Import -- they bring the stone. It is -- It is black granite. And they\nstarted selling, you know, for -- for local needs. With this, I guess this created a new\nindustry there for them. So, when I got in touch with them already, I -- I spoke to them\nquite often on the telephone, tried to write them. But when they said no -- when the\nmilitary said no, then I got in touch with Senator Cohen\u2019s office here, ask him what to do,\nhow to -- I wrote to the -- to -- to the Ukrainian embassy and I told them, you know, U-\nUkraine now 1s the largest country in Europe. And I wrote them, \u201cYou are this largest\ncountry, can\u2019t you as -- allow a piece of land f-for your former citizens?\u201d They didn\u2019t\nanswer. Then, Cohen\u2019s office told me to write -- there\u2019s a -- in Washington an agency --\nAmerican Commission for the Preservation of Historic si -- US historic sites abroad,\nwhich includes Holocaust sites. And they wrote to the embassy. And Senator Cohen\nwrote to the embassy, no answer. When we came back in 19 -- in 1995, when I ca -- we\nwent to Israel. We had planned to go to Israel and from Israel to go to -- to the -- to -- to -\n- to Ukraine. But since we couldn\u2019t make it, you know, we went a year later, we went to\nIsrael anyway, to see our daughter, kids. And when I came back, there was a letter to the\ncommission, that they understand I\u2019m going to Povorsk to sup -- put up a monument to\nmy -- for my parents. I don\u2019t know where they got this idea. The monument was already\nthere, it was standing already. And they promise that the local authorities will cooperate\nwith me to make it possible, which was great. But there was no civilians, not ci -- nobody\ncame from the local population. If we go now, I'll -- my brother, we decided, if we go,\nwe go for a few days, we walk around among -- among the civilians of the village and\nfind out -- I -- I am sure there are some people my age or a little younger, even, that will\nremember our family. I know what ha -- you know what happened, there is nothing to\nfind out, see? They\u2019re there and 1s the right place, because I have a picture of this place.\nA friend of mine sent somebody there while he\u2019s in the Ukraine, he say -- gave him a --\nfilled up his car with -- a Ukrainian -- with gas and he gave him a camera with film, take\npictures of this place. He did and there was a lot of bones lying on the ground, cause he\u2019s\nholding one bone that looks like a human. As a matter of fact, one of us -- one of this --\nfrom Boston fellow, found a little bone and I gis -- gave it to the local police to send the -\n- to FBI |-lab to -- it turned out was not human. I don\u2019t know, it was -- I don\u2019t know if\nthey parted with it, but anyway, he told me, it\u2019s not human, that\u2019s just -- so, 1t was -- it\ntook -- took -- it didn\u2019t take this long, it took several years, but the dream was there, th-\nthe obsession was there -- the -- th-the -- it was very important. So this 1s, if I\naccomplished anything in my life, this is the thing, the most important thing I did.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, just too -- too painful about my son and the -- the marriage was a\nmisalliance. I -- I cannot talk about it.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s -- was a town, you know, which, like most small towns that size, was mixed\nUkrainian and Jewish. It was -- I -- I can still picture the way it looked. There was a big\nmarketplace, like in a square, in the middle of town. And right in the center was the u --\nthe Ukrainian church, which is the same, the provis -- they called it provis lauw -- the\nRussian Orthodox church used to be there. And ri-right next to it, almost, in the square --\nnot in the middle of the square, but among the houses, was the Jewish synagogue. And ar\n-- and all the center was occupied by Jewish homes. A little out further, there were\npeasants, Ukrainian peasants, who had their parcels of land on them, and they were now\nbasically agricultural people, you know, they grew -- grew stuff. The Jews in this town\nwere all artisans. Blacksmiths, carpenters, who built furniture and houses and all kinds of\ncarpentry. Tailors, who work for the local non-Jewish population mostly, but they were\nthe majority. They used to go to villages where -- for six months, to build a house or to\nsew clothes for a couple who got married, you know, stayed there. They were all very\npious. Used to go, when they were in town, they used to go three times a day to the\nsynagogue. Lately, not so much. Most of them had grown beards, the majority, except\nafter the s-second World War, there were some that did shave their -- their faces. They\nwere strong believers in a rab -- Hasidic rabe, which exists now in New York. It was\ncalled a stollena chasidim. It was a typical, what we called -- we lived in the next town, it\nwas only 12 kilometers away, the same kind of people, we called them backward, cause\nthey were very observant. But there was no railroad sta -- the railroad station was six\nkilometers away. So you had to, 1f you\u2019re going to go by tra -- by train, you had to walk\nto the railroad station or take a horse and wagon. I -- And this was the kind of -- and there\nwas ha -- at least half of the -- half of the town were Kirzners, my mother\u2019s maiden name.\nAnd they were -- And I don\u2019t know even how they were related, but the one I knew were\nvery close, cousins, uncles, aunts. There must have been at least 70 to a hundred people\nperished of my relatives. I had two grandmother that -- wa -- one died a natural death\nmany years ago and the other one I told you, was found, was running away with two\ngrandchildren. I had the cousins by the dozens. This was the kind of a town it was. In th -\n- As I told you before, we -- we -- I lived in a town that was new. This one had a tradition\nway back, it was for generations -- during the war, the first World War, 1t was occupied\nby the Germans and they evacuated us. I was born during the first World War and we\nwere evacuated into the hinterland -- German, by Austro-Hungarians, which operated this\nsector of the front. I remember mother used to tell me I was probably s-six months old, it\nwas January, I was born in July. So, I was about five, six months old and they evacuate\nus 1n -- in cattle cars. Later Hitler used this for -- for sending -- but it was not -- these\nwere not evacuated for -- to -- to -- to die, they were evacu -- to -- to save their lives, s-so\nthey can move the front, you know, they we -- without hindrance by [indecipherable |\ncivilian population. And when I ca -- When you came to the destination, which was only\nabout 50 to 60 miles away, I was half frozen. So the Hungarian soldiers who operated\nthat sector of the front, threw me -- they stood -- to -- stood in a line and threw me from\nhand to hand til they revived me. Later in, the same Hungarians sent Jews to Auschwitz.\nSee the difference? That\u2019s why a lot of people did not escape, because we knew the\nGermans from the first World War. My father spoke Germans perfe -- German perfectly,\nand he worked for the Germans the first World War, as an interpreter. And who would\nexpect that the most civilized country in Europe -- nobody believed -- just the Germans\nwho didn\u2019t believe it -- that last long, so that we, who lived under the Germans in the first\nWorld War, we were waiting for them. Because the Czarist -- th-the -- the enemy was the\nCzarist army, the Cossacks. See, there was no Jewish officers in the -- in the Czarist\narmy, but there were Jewish officers in the German army. Or in the Hungarian --\nHungaria -- the Austro-Hungarian army. So nobody expected it. A lot of them could have\nbeen saved, a lot of them could have been evacuated. My parents could have. But how do\nyou leave? You have a home, you have a cow, you have a -- a barn, you have -- you\nknow, everything there. Not -- Not much, but a place to live.",

And we also kept -- she has a few --\none, two boarders, used to come for dinner in our house and sometimes -- there was no\nhotel in this village, so she used to also ser -- have a room prepared in case somebody\ncame and decided to stay overnight, to stay over there.

        "A: Oh, very much so. I -- Now I don\u2019t so mu -- I used to -- I used to teach Hebrew and\nYiddish. I taught a course here in Portland High School, evening classes, in Yiddish. I\nhad some student, non-Jewish, took Yiddish. And then I had a course 1n the temple for\nHebrew. I had one in Florida, where we lived now, a Hebrew class, but it dwindled. It\u2019s a\nvery few. I was the official interpreter here for many years and for the Maine Medical\nCenter, the county jail and police station and Diocese Refugee Resettlement Center and\nthe Jewish Federation Settlement Center. All the Jews that came in from Russia all went\nthrough me. I was their first -- I met them at the plane, somebody else brought the\nflowers. I greeted them in their own language. We took them over to the apartment which\nwe'd prepared, with a refrigerator full of groceries for at least a week. Take their kid to\nschools, every new immigrant had to be taken to the hospital for a tuberculosis test, that\nwas my job.

But the -- the diocese,\nwhich took care, you know, of the non-Jewish immigrants, for the state resettlement\ncenter, needed Polish interpreters. So, they had some of their own, but ga -- you -- you\nknow, you never can find -- when you need -- all of a sudden you need somebody, it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- I was on call. The -- The immigration department has an office here in Portland and\nthey caught some Poles who bought Social Security numbers -- cards in New York, at 50\ndollars apiece and they worked in a fancy hotel in Kennebunk.

Great. An-And I had a prejudice, you know, I had to fight my\nprejudice against Poles, cause I knew how they treated us. But it\u2019s not their fault. Not\ntheir fault, so -- so you had to -- it -- it isn\u2019t always easy. You -- Sometimes you --\nDerogatory remarks about Jews from the same people you are trying to help, see?

        "A: [inaudible] I like we start a little earlier?",
        "A: When I was young, my teenagers -- teenaged years, youngsters in Poland were very\nbusy in politics. We have nothing else to do. There was no work, there wa -- we had to\nfind the enemy and who the enemy was, who knows? The Poles were course, hated --\nhated us. We didn\u2019t see any future for ourselves as Jews -- y-young -- Jewish youngsters.\nSo we -- first of all, I wer -- I was probably 14 -15, is I joined the group Socialist\nZionists, the Shamara Zaheer and then the -- they\u2019re the one that pioneered in Israel, in\nthe kibbutzim, way to the left. The atheist Socialist Nationalist Jews. Then the -- I -- I\ndidn\u2019t like this kind of Socialism, so I became a Rightist youngster, you know for the --\nwas -- with -- they called it that time, the Revisionist Zionist again, Zionist again. And I\nwas disappointed then and because it was somewhat semi-Fascist, the -- the uniforms\nwere brown like -- like German SS. That what -- they had it before the German SS, you\nknow, but I mean, there was fights between the left and the right and I was basically\nZionist, but not -- I -- I don\u2019t know what the solution would be, to -- I -- a Jewish\nhomeland and Palestine or not the Jewish homeland and Palestine. So if you\u2019re born here,\nwe should have the rights here. So I joined the group, which was anti-Fascist. Little did I\nknow the anti-Fascist group was a -- the poli -- this Communist party was illegal in\nPoland. This was a way for them to -- from within, to come into the -- some kind of legal\nway and this was the anti-Fascist, they preached Socialist unity among the Je -- Je-Jewish\nSocialist parties -- so cal -- so called progressive, Polish so called progressive and they f-\nformed this, but later on I realized this was a Communist front. So I quit this party. But I\n-- I loved the Hebrew language, you know, I -- I was educated in it and the Communist\nforbid -- forbade Zionism and the language -- not just Zionism, but the language. Yiddish\nwas the language. I says, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we have two languages? It\u2019s a language that we --\nyou know, it\u2019s -- is al -- you know, come -- 1s already several thousand years in our\nhistory, why should we abandon? It\u2019s a beautiful language, I like it.\u201d So, I could not fit in\ninto a frame. I could not fi -- I -- I couldn\u2019t be a Communist. I was a Zionist -- a partial\nZionist. I had my own ideas. The same with religion, I was not -- I could not conform to\nthe official religion. I had atheistic or agnostic -- I don\u2019t know -- feelings, see? But like --\nlike many others, I didn\u2019t know what -- I couldn\u2019t make -- I -- I -- til this day I don\u2019t\nknow what I want, and I\u2019m sure that many other people don\u2019t either. Then came the\nCommunists, in 1939. Even though what I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the Soviet\nUnion, I saw right away something is wrong there. First of all, they arrested Communists,\nwho was -- one jail -- spent in jail, idealists, people idealist with -- spent in Polish jail\nfive, 10 years, for nothing. For raising a red flag, for speaking out against the\ngovernment, they were sent away. Th-They\u2019d say -- when they came in, the ri -- the first\nvictims were these people, they sent them away. I got a -- I -- I worked -- during the\nbeginning, I tried to organize a school that will t-teach Yiddish, because since we didn\u2019t\nhave enough population to -- to introduce the Yiddish language, Yiddish history, Jewish\nhistory, into the curriculum [indecipherable] my 20\u2019s, [indecipherable] are married, a-a-\nand -- and then to the Ukrainian school, because the -- the majority were the Ukrainian,\nand they rebuffed me. It all -- It all -- They almost accused me of being Nationalist and\nthis was a big -- oh, either Nationalist or Cosmopolitan, both of them were non-kosher.\nSo I gave up, I couldn\u2019t do anything. I got a job, because I was doing a good job for th --\nI was -- you know, I ha -- I worked with the -- at that time there were Yiddish papers that\ncame from Kiev and in the beginning were the honeymoon. So, the local pol -- di -- g-ga-\ngave me the job of managing the local store. There wasn\u2019t much in it, but whatever was, I\nwas the first one that I could use for myself, see? And my family. And my father got the\njob because he spoke Russian perfectly. I didn\u2019t speak Russian, but I -- I knew Ukrainian.\nNever learned it, but from the -- we lived among the Ukrainians, I knew Ukrainian. Then,\nthe war started and I left. I was in the army and when I came there, they -- they -- because\n-- | -- | -- | -- I fell into -- it\u2019s a long story, I don\u2019t -- not trying to tell the whole thing. I\nwas in -- in -- in German encirclement and I risked my life to get out of there and they\ntook and they put me on the front and then they took me off the front, because I was -- I\nam unreliable, because I was -- lived in Poland before \u201839. Thousands and thousands and\nthousands of people, they took out the front. They didn\u2019t take off local Ukrainians, who\ndeserted every day from the place where I was. I did not desert, because I know desertion\nmean death. Th-The Germans capture me, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s it, 1t\u2019Il be the end. So -- and then\nthey put me on -- on the build-building a railroad. It\u2019s already the second year of the war\nand -- near Stalingrad, on the other side of the Volga, because there was none there to put\non this side -- on the east -- west side -- you never know which [indecipherable] it was.\nAnd we build this railroad and it was built by the NK VD. This 1s the -- the secret police,\nth-the -- the prison authorities. And they took us as work battalions -- military work\nbattalions, and treated just like the -- these con -- co -- con -- convicts, see? And these\nwere also mostly for political crimes. Those who had a lot of si -- land, you know, the\nKulaks and so forth. Some were there for next to nothing. They stole something from the\nplace of work. Five years, 10 years, 15 years, you know, Stalin -- Stalin\u2019s pogrom. Then I\nrealized -- I saw the -- th-the real face of Communism, because I remember them and I\nwo-work in the coal mine and I figured if I only knew -- if Stalin only knew -- see how\nblind I was -- what -- what they do to us. Little did I know this was Stalin\u2019s orders. And\nwe build a railroad before we went in the mine, there used to be a -- a NK VD official by\nthe name of Brienin. Brienin I know was a Hebrew writer and I think it must be the same\nfamily, it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s very unusual name. Because I met a girl in Portland here, she\u2019s not\na local. And when I told her that I remember from the Hebrew literature, we studied -- a\nfellow by the name Reuben Brienin, she said that\u2019s -- was her uncle. She lived in -- I\ndon\u2019t know, Pennsylvania or somewhere. She knew who it was. He stayed in the Soviet\nUnion and this must be a -- from this same family and he was wearing elegant white shirt\n-- clean, white shirt and shiny boots, with military, navy pants and he used to walk -- see\n- - and now we had to -- it was in the Steppests, you know, the flat land. We had to dig\nthe soil out and we had to do so many cubic meters. An-And -- And we -- with -- and\nwheelbarrows, all by hand, without any machinery, go up, you know, like second floor\nhigh to put the trestle -- on the trestle and then somebody will stand there -- not one, in\nthe hundreds, and -- and the temperature, it\u2019Il be hard so we can put the rails on it. And\nhe used to come and go with this -- check out this. And he was -- he looked very well fed\na-and we were -- we were -- if you did the norm, that\u2019s a five cubic yards of soil, you get\na certain soup. There were three kinds of soup. Was millet -- millet, it\u2019s -- was thicker or\nthinner. Some was from water, all the way, you know to a little thick se -- or more bread.\nAn-And it was like a vicious circle, if you couldn\u2019t make your norm, you got less to eat.\nYou had less to eat, you had less strength to -- to -- to do any. So you were doomed.\nLuckily, this -- after four months, th-th-this was finished and I survived it. I went from --\nprobably from 150 pounds to about 100 pounds in -- in no time. Then I realized the real -\n- what the real Soviet order is, what Communism is. But I was supported before and I\nwas happy because in the beginning, you know, there were Jews in high -- high officials.\nNot too many too high. There was one Awon Kakanovich that survived, it was -- he was\nStalin\u2019s brother-in-law, a Jew. The rest of them were killed afterward. Especially 1948,\nbut I was out at that time. But it -- 1t was a great letdown.\n-- What was -- Did -- What was your understanding? Did you -- could you relate to\nAmerican policy?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I did relate to [indecipherable] more so -- more so, because this was a\nthousand percent improvement on what we had. I never lived in a free country. I came\nand I got a job in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. And Woonsocket Rhode Island\u2019s a small\ntown and I saw -- I -- I already started reading -- knew enough English to read a paper.\nAnd I saw in the paper -- this was Hanukah holiday. And in the local paper, there an\narticle about Hanukah. The -- With a picture of a Menorah. The Hebrew school and so --\nI couldn\u2019t understand it, see? To me, this was -- no -- no American paid -- paid attention\nto it, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s normal, right? To me, it was not normal, it was -- it made me idealize\nAmerica, even though there were many things later on I found out that I knew it was not\nso great. But compared to what we had, this was paradise. I made my first wages, a dollar\nfive an hour, union wages, that\u2019s a help on a truck. I was a Hebrew teacher, the gets --\nfirst I got a job as a Hebrew teacher. This was 1948, there was some -- a lot of\nunemployment. Truman was just elected and they -- they thought the country\u2019s go-going\non to the dogs, economically, see? It was very difficult. So I stayed -- it was in Boston.\nSo when I came, they gave me a job in a Hebrew school. They knew I knew Hebrew.\nSome of my relatives -- relative\u2019s relatives in Chelsea, in Massachusetts and I came there.\nI did not -- my English was zero. And their Hebrew was zero -- and they gave me first a\nfifth grade with their teacher supervising me. Well, I didn\u2019t do badly because they\nunderstood some Hebrew. I have a natural knack of teaching, even though I have no\nacademic preparation for it. But I -- I could convey, you know, whatever I know to\nothers. And I did all right, he says, \u201cYou have promise.\u201d So then, there was -- th-the-then\nthe school year ended and there was a teacher, a young lady in the first grade and her\ncontract called for the school year, she quit. They decided to keep the school open\nanother two months -- do -- two weeks or three weeks, I don\u2019t remember what. The\nparents, they are paying tuition for the year, they wanted to have -- you know, let them\nhave the kids another two years in scho -- two weeks in school, not to be at their backs.\nWas a small, poor town, Chelsea. So, they gave me this first grade. I am by myself with a\nclassroom about 30 kids, don\u2019t understand a word of Hebrew. They can\u2019t read already,\nhardly and I don\u2019t understand a word of Eng -- they smelled a rat right away and this was\nthe worst time of my life. So, anyway, wi -- it lasted only a couple of weeks and the\nprincipal said, \u201cMaybe start the new year, I\u2019ll send for you.\u201d Meantime I went to\nWoonsocket, I got this job in the -- dollar five an hour, union wages. Hebrew school used\nto pay 75 dollars a week for about three hours a day, few days a week, which was great.\nAnd the -- also, he ga -- they send me to the -- Boston has it -- used to have a Hebrew\nteacher\u2019s college. Now it\u2019s called the Hebrew college, which awards degrees, you know,\nthe undergraduate and -- and the masters. They wanted to accept me in the third year -- it\nwas a four year school, third year, nights. And I -- when I thought -- w-we\u2019re -- with the\nkids -- September came, he sent for me, he wanted me to come and I said, \u201cNothing\ndoing, I don\u2019t want it, it\u2019s enough.\u201d So, I -- I went to -- later on, I lost the job. So, over\nthe summer, I came back to Boston, I got another job and there I went to Hebrew college\nand they told me they\u2019ll let me into a third -- I -- I had to take a-an exam in a few -- I -- a\nfew subjects I did not know. Talmud, I think 1t was and some other -- Hebrew, I -- the la-\nlanguage and I didn\u2019t have problems. But I didn\u2019t decide -- but I had a cousin -- my\ncousin\u2019s wife, who\u2019s to me like a sister and that -- she died already, and she says,\n\u201cWorking in this place is not for you.\u201d It was a [indecipherable], I was a foreman there. It\nwas 20 women. It was not easy either, but I managed. They pay me -- what -- came from\n42 dollars a week union wages, I got 32 dollars as a supervisor, you know. Foreman, 32\ndollars a week. The girl that worked there made -- the -- the -- the minimum wage went\nup to 75 cents an hour. Was 30 dol -- they -- they made more -- more than I did, almost.\nSo, she says, \u201cYou have to go to school, you have to learn. So it\u2019s either Hebrew college,\nor --\u201d she sa -- I says, \u201cMy father was an accountant, self taught.\u201d He is got some\ncorrespondence course. So I knew a little bit about bookkeeping. So I went to Bentley\u2019s -\n- Bentley College, which is now a big school. At that [indecipherable], it was a little --\nlittle school in Boylston Street and I took accounting. So, I worked for three -- three years\nin Boston, then we got married -- I got married, had a daughter, we came to Portland. So\n-- What were they talking about -- we talked abou-about something else, we were talking\nabout America, America. I -- America I thought, to me -- to me it was the greatest\ncountry in the world. So, of course, I knew the Soviet Union, I knew it already. I kn -- I --\nit was an evil empire, no question about it. I couldn\u2019t see how can American defend the\nsystem they don\u2019t know -- think about, which a lot of American did. There are many bad\nthings, you know, the Nixon and this and -- McCarthy. But these were things that did not\napply to me. I knew I can go anyplace -- I knew -- none -- it wasn\u2019t easy at that time,\neither, Brandeis was built, because it was hard for Jewish student to go to college, they\nhad a -- they had the certain number they would accept. But they were a certain number,\nnot zero. Poland it was, well, not zero. Point point something, see? And we were 10\npercent the population in Poland. And then the Soviet Union, so this, to me, is ideal, to --\nI didn\u2019t miss an election. I took my Americanism very, very seriously.",
        "A: I had -- usually, it takes five years. So, I came in \u201848, I was entitled to be in *53. But,\nin \u201853, we moved to Portland and you have to be a citizen of the state for at least a year.\nSo I have to wait in -- one more year. And Rochelle became a citizen the year after and\nshe was the first one to be on television.",
        "A: Yeah, she was on television, on the -- it was on November 11. November 11 she\nbecame a citizen in the supreme co -- federal court, right here. I became active in the\nJewish organization [indecipherable]. I became one time friend -- a neighbor said, \u201cI\nwould like you to come to see a group. We are meeting every week, you might find it\ninteresting.\u201d I was, you know, very much aware of my accent. I got a job here as an\noffice manager, but still -- my accent\u2019s still heavy, the way it is now. This was, you\nknow, 1953. So, he took me in an-and they used to meet in the Congregational church,\nWoodfras Congregational Church, in the basement. And I come in there and the -- the\ngroup didn\u2019t tell me what is -- what they do and what is -- it\u2019s, \u201cCCome in, you -- you'll\nlike it.\u201d Boucher was his name, Frenchman. So I come in there and it is a group of\nToastmasters International, a group that learns public speaking, yeah. And this exactly\nwhat I needed, because I was -- I\u2019m -- I am by nature very bashful. Sometimes doesn\u2019t\nshow so much, but I am. And -- And I am very much aware of my accent, which I lost --\nthis I lost afterward. Not the accent, but being -- being, you know, considering an\nimpediment, yeah. It 1s not. I -- I learned that if you have to say something, people listen,\neven if you speak with an accent. So, I belong to this group and all of a sudden, when I\nmade my first -- you have to, after a few weeks, you make your so called icebreaker\nspeech and I told them what my story, I came to this country -- I still have it. And they --\nthey applauded, so it was great. And then I became active in the many other Jewish\norganizations. Jewish federation, Jewish Home for the Aged. I became, after -- at age 50,\nI quit my job and I started -- open my own office for the practice of public accounting.\nAnd I developed a very nice practice, people liked me, I did well. A few years ago, well,\nit\u2019s long -- le -- it\u2019s the nin -- 90 -- 1990, Rochelle and I and Senator Mitchell and\nSenator Cohen were honored. She told you -- I think she showed you this, this thing\nthere.",
        "A: No. There is three of these 1n the state of Maine. One, Senator C -- Mitchell and one\nSenator Cohen and Rochelle and roch -- and Jerry Slivka.",
        "A: From the Jewish community, yeah, Jewish community for work with immigrants --\nwork with immi -- so, this was the largest gathering of Jews 1n the sta -- in the history of\nPortland, over 600 people there. [indecipherable] an evening. So, this is another\nachievement I think which we are very proud of.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, well there a lot of work there. I knew what it means to be an immigrant. I felt for\nthem, I knew and I understood them. I -- I know what they are talking about, see? And\nnot only my -- Rochelle did a lot of work. We had -- We organized once a marriage for\nthree couples, a mass marriage in the Temple. The rabbi, everything. Three couples. I\nmade a Bar Mitzvah for a boy. Organized a dinner for a hundred, 125 people, lunch. I\ntaught them to read Hebrew, then I send them to the girl to teach them to chant. It didn\u2019t\nwor -- they -- they have nothing to do with -- with the Portland -- Jewish institutions here.\nThe same people. I even had a funeral -- had to get -- you know, talk to the professionals\nin charge. There was no money to buy the gr -- for the grave, for the ceremony, for the\ncasket and -- so there was a lot of work. I am -- Now I am an honorary member of the --\nlife honorary member of the Jewish Federation. I am life honorary member of the Jewish\n-- used to be the Jewish home for the aged, now it\u2019s called Cedar\u2019s. And now -- now I\nwork mostly with the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine.",
        "A: Found.",
        "A: It is a very interesting organization. You know, it\u2019s a state that has not too many Jews.\nI remember when we came in the beginning, and th-the Yom HaShoah, Day of\nRemembrance came and we used to sit like mourners, real mourners. Nobody paid any\nattention. You didn\u2019t read about it, you didn\u2019t hear about it. Some congregations in\nBoston used to have a -- a memorial, you know. But Portland, nothing. Not in the\nsynagogue, even to this day, nothing. A-And I figured, we have to do something about it.\nGerda called me up, Gerda Haas. First of all, we went to Bangor, there was a theological\nseminary in there, non-Jewish, that wanted to have some kind -- it didn\u2019t work out. So\nthen one day she calls me, we having the -- Bates co -- Walden College had the seminar\non the Holocaust, which she organized with some other professors from Walden and\nother colleges, and --",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: This was a four -- about 14 years ago. We are celebrating Bar Mitzvah last -- last year,\nit\u2019s almost 14 years. And there are some non-Jewish people and some Jewish people and\nwe all going to dif -- no budget. There was no money. We operate for about two years,\nwe run out of money and we needed -- we had an executive director, she paid very little,\nbut we didn\u2019t have a -- so we borrowed from a bank and we gave our per-personal\nsignatures. You know, th-then we started raising more money. We have now budget --\nnot much, but for a state like Maine, 100,000 dollars, we pay 40,000 for a executive\ndirector, who does all the work. And we have our annual meeting, to which we bring a\nspeaker. I established a little fund. Rochelle used to speak 1n schools and I used to speak\nand -- and the honorarium we get goes to this fund. And [indecipherable] 10,00 dollars,\nnow the income from it pays for speakers once a year. We have a trip to Poland every\ntwo years, for teachers. We have two teachers seminars every year and Bates college\nused to have one upstate. This year was the first year we had only one, cause there were\nnot enough. And we\u2019re [indecipherable]. We designed curriculum for kindergarten to\nfifth grade -- through fourth grade, I think. And then to eighth grade. And now they\u2019re ta\n-- eight to 12. We\u2019re talking about -- curriculum for eight to 12, which includes -- it\u2019s\nliterature based curriculum. Also includes Maine specific problems like the French\nminority in Maine and now other minority, we participate in fighting prejudice and the\nsame time we tried to rid ourselves of prejudice. A few weeks ago, they dabbed the\nswastikas on the synagogue, Presque Isle, where there\u2019s probably 10 Jews. And just the\nday before Yom Kippur. Swastika with a -- said, \u201cBurn Jews.\u201d They didn\u2019t -- still didn\u2019t\ncatch. Then there was, in another church, another town not far upstate, no Jews there.\nAnd they\u2019re -- And this -- and they -- this vandalant, they caught two kids that\nvandalized, you know, the piano and chairs and equipment in a church, mind you. An-\nAnd --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: What was I talking about, the --",
        "A: Yeah, in -- just a few weeks ago.",
        "A: We did a lot of work against -- we had a ca -- a law -- we had a law, you know, the\nho-homosexuals and the -- discrimination against homosexuals and lesbians, which when\nth-the -- the main religious right ga -- organized the -- a what do you call it? Referendum,\nand they voided that law. Trying some other way to get it, maybe a federal law or\nsomething. But we did a lot of good work. We meet once a month. I\u2019m the treasurer of it\nas of now. We\u2019re going away next -- in a few weeks, I\u2019ll -- but we -- I have a fax and I\nhave a telephone, I have a e-mail now, so we -- I can do the work from there. We have an\nassist-assistant so she\u2019ll sign the checks here, if necessary, and I think we are doing great\nwork.\nas understanding the Holocaust and how that has changed or not changed since the\nestablishment of Human Rights Center and since your work here?",
        "A: Well, the Human Rights Center is a great influence in -- in Portland. Not so much\namong the Jewish population, I -- yeah -- it did -- we have a lot of Jewish members, no --\nwe -- membership is part of our budget. And we have a lot of -- and especially when we\nhave the annual meeting. We pur -- we have about 150 - 200 people come and quite a\nfew Jews. But the interest among the schools, young people mostly, is the non-Jewish\nschools. Rochelle goes to quite a few schools to speak, I go with her. Sometimes, when I\nsee she is tired, I will try to answer some questions, cause sometime they\u2019Il ask questions\nwhich she doesn\u2019t know and I will do. Sometimes I speak on subjects of resistance,\nwhich I know from second hand, but still I know it, cause my brother was there. So I\nknow quite a b-bit about it. Th-They -- Our presence is felt. Our presence is felt now in\nthe state of Maine. As far as Maine, how did we integrate into Maine life when we came\nto Maine, I think sh --Rochelle told you, sh-she -- she had a hard time, very difficult time.\nI worked -- I was busy and I worked many hours. My job was seven days and -- and --\nand two evenings. Six days. Six days and two evenings I used to work. And then I started\nbuilding my own practice, doing some tax returns and the other -- the other five evenings,\nand Sundays. So, it was difficult. But I was too busy. She had a child, we didn\u2019t have a\ncar, we didn\u2019t have a television. We used to sit and listen to the radio, Fibber Magee,\nMolly, probably not aware what it is. Was a very popular, you know, sitcom without TV,\nradio. A year later we got the radio and we got a car, we made some friends. Portland --\nnot just Portland, all of Maine, Jewish and non-Jewish societies, they were closed, kind\nof, you know. If you were from away, you were not born here, regardless how long you\nlived, you were -- you were a stranger, yeah. What do they know? Now, the thing has\nchanged, because there a lot of people -- there a lot of newcomers and the Jewish\ncommunity -- the leadership of the Jewish community are newcomers. At that time, when\nI was a director of the federation board, I was probably the only away fa -- persons. Now\nthere are a lot of people, away. So, it doesn\u2019t -- you don\u2019t need the local, you know, little\nniche, you know, with the -- they had to join. You can find some people, you know, in\nyour situation, which is -- which is mu-much, much better. But this was, you know, it\nwas -- it was a provincial town. It isn\u2019t now.",
        "A: As a Jew? No, not at all. It ne -- It never ca -- came t -- I never -- never had to put to\n-- needed to. I -- Pro-Probably existed. It existed -- I know it existed in the clubs. We\nlived across the street from Woodfras Club, our first place. And Woodfras Club didn\u2019t\nhave any Jewish members til the 60\u2019s, when they started, you know, fighting\ndiscrimination. What helped? They to -- They didn\u2019t give them -- for discrimin -- the\nstate passed a law -- the organization that discriminate cannot get a liquor license. And\nthis was a great deal -- without a liquor license. The same happened w-with Woodfras\nClub, the same a -- ha -- with the Elks Club, the same act with Cumberland Club, va -- ga\n-- Cumberland -- Cumberland Country Club, you know, with the golf course. Now there\nare -- people are fighting for Jewish membership, to get Jewish members in there. Jews\nare good to -- fundraisers, you know, Jews can -- can contribute a lot, see? So now there\nare Jewish regis -- and the -- in the Portl -- Portland cun -- Cumberland Country Club,\nwhich is in Portland. Things that never expected. There was a -- a -- that town here,\nPoland Springs, beautiful town on a hill, and this will be the -- beautiful hotels there and -\n- and the sign was no dukes -- dogs or Jews welcome. So what happened, a bos -- Boston\nJew ca -- bought it. Of course it -- it wa -- out -- it\u2019s out of business now, the motel down\nthere. But, they start accept -- there\u2019s no problem now.",
        "A: Well, the fir -- the first one was newcomers. We had some friends, survivors. Not all\nof them were likable. Not all -- Not all of them were favorite friends, but we had\nsomething in common, at least. But then we kind of drifted apart. We found people on\nour level. Doesn\u2019t mean that their level was lower than ours, but you found many -- th-\nthe -- the good thing was about it, that people were seeking us out, you know, to -- as\nfriends, which was great, much better than when you -- you are asked to be a -- not --\nyou\u2019re asked, you don\u2019t have to be a gi -- you know, people -- by the language, you\nknow, determines, shows that somebody wants you as a friend. So, most of our friends\nare not -- well, there -- there aren\u2019t many left. There aren\u2019t any, practically, survivors.\nThere\u2019s one or two survivors that we know, we keep in touch, but that\u2019s about it.",
        "A: No, now it -- it\u2019s in deft, they all changed. They all changed, some for the worse, some\nfor the better. But we don\u2019t have to choose friend because of our common past. There\nplenty people we find -- we -- we have a friend now that doesn\u2019t understand what it\nmeans to be a survivor. Sh-She\u2019s look -- she ca -- sits right here and she looks at this and\nwe know -- sh-she knows Rochelle is talking to her about the Holocaust and she says,\n\u201cTh-This crystal, that\u2019s your mother leave you.\u201d It\u2019s not so funny, but it\u2019s\n[indecipherable]. Your mother left. We da -- we don\u2019t know what to give it to. Nobody\nwants to get that one. But we made -- we made our mark here on this town.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have to. If there were listeners, we were ready to talk. Not for t --\nnot for our satisfaction, to teach, only. Just -- Just to let -- we are trying to make people\naware what can happen if there is hatred, what can happen when there is intolerance. And\nthat\u2019s where it\u2019s not easy, not easy. I can see how -- she talk -- she can be very tough. She\nwa -- I start talking and all of a sudden I break down, because see now, where -- even\nwhen I tas -- it comes through, certain things, certain happenings, I -- I have to control\nmyself, very -- it\u2019s very difficult to control, not to -- stop the com -- breakdown. She\ndoesn\u2019t have this problem. Sh-She used to -- She used to smoke, so when she used to\nspeak before a school and get out afterwards, first thing, she\u2019ll take a cigarette. Now she\ndoesn\u2019t. She had an angina attack and I convinced her not to smoke. It wasn\u2019t easy, cause\nshe thought she cannot go to the bathroom without the cigarette. That\u2019s a necessities. I --\nI says, \u201cTry this time, try this time.\u201d Slowly, gradually, she stopped smo -- she doesn\u2019t\nsmoke much anyway. I used to smoke a lot, but I gave it up. I -- I -- I also loved to take a\ndrink, too, you know, in the Soviet Union, everybody drinks. And if you were -- if I were\nin the Soviet Union, I wouldn\u2019t be alive by now, I\u2019m sure, from the cigarettes and the\ndrinking, I would be kaput. But I knew -- I needed a drink to -- being to express myself.\nNot much, just a little. I don\u2019t need it now, I can do it. I needed a cigarette to calm my\nnerves. At that time, it had another purpose, 1-it helped not to feel the hunger pains. You\ntake a deep puff and you feel it right here, almost in the stomach. But now, I don\u2019t need\nit. There were many mistakes we made. She had problems when we came and all of a\nsudden she finds herself in a strange town, without friends, with a little girl, confined.\nShe was young. So she got depression, you know, from the past and all this. And the\ndoctor made a mistake, he did not involve me. He did agree -- he treated her with, you\nknow, a general practitioner, he treated her with pills to keep her, but we -- we should\nhave -- as -- talked to me and talk us together and try to solve the problems we had. We\ndidn\u2019t. That\u2019s a mistake we made. She never learned to talk to me. She can talk to an\naudience, but not to me, about herself. Talks about what happened to her during the\nHolocaust, but problems that we have, which hu-human beings do, regardless how much\nyou might love or not love, it\u2019s -- is -- they have problems and he -- that didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t\nrealize -- she takes pills, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s all. We didn\u2019t know how to relate our kids. We didn\u2019t\ndo badly. I think we brought up good kids. But, I wish I would known 40 years ago what\nI know now. We could have done better. But, there\u2019s no limit.",
        "A: Well, re-relationships. Relationship between husband and wife or a father and -- and\ndaughter. We have a daughter who is overweight and we didn\u2019t know how to stop her.\nSomething was bothering, you know, you know, and we didn\u2019t know what. She\u2019s -- grew\nup to be a wonderful human being. She\u2019s a teacher. She has her Master\u2019s 1n education.\nParents used to come when she used to teach class -- now, she does teach reading, you\nknow, she has sev-several school -- used to come with -- they had once -- one kid, the\nsibling grew up to -- they came to the school, ask her to put her 1-in Harriet\u2019s class. Is\nexcellent teacher. Perhaps I could have done something about it. Perhaps I did something\nwrong, which I shouldn\u2019t have done. I have my doubts. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\nPeople think she\u2019s the greatest person in the world. She weighs probably 200 pounds,\nwhich is unhealthy. And every time we see her, I -- we don\u2019t talk about it. I wrote her a\nletter a couple years ago, explaining to her how I feel. I cannot -- I can better express\nmyself when I write. And I just asked her, \u201cDo you -- Did you see my letter?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cAre you going to answer?\u201d \u201cSomeday.\u201d Now, of course, she\u2019s a woman in her\n40\u2019s. She\u2019s not -- she\u2019s not a kid I can tell what to do. But, we could have made our lifes\na little easier, perhaps, I don\u2019t know. But oh, there\u2019s so much [indecipherable]\n-- and your journey to the US, and we discussed it only very briefly in your videotaped\ninterview. So why don\u2019t we start with your journey here, and talk about --",
        "A: [indecipherable] arrived in the United States --",
        "A: Well, I was in the -- I came here directly from Italy, where I stayed in a DP camp.\nFrom 1946, about -- the fall of 1946. I told you about my brother, my brother was there\nright before, couple years. And I came to Austria, by the underground -- it was called the\nBricha -- on the way to Israel [indecipherable] with my kibbutz. And when I came to\nItaly, there was a telegram waiting for me at the Joint Distribution Committee, the Jewish\nrelief organization, which had my name with that telegram from my brother, with -- and\nhis address where he is, in which camp. So I -- he -- I got it right away, I was very much\namazed, this was very efficient of them to do that. And I got in touch right away with my\nbrother and then some of his friends, we used to do some business, traveling all over\nItaly, you know, buying sa -- u-used clothing, mostly, and selling it on the open air\nmarkets and they took me with them -- with me -- they took me with them. And I came to\na town called Santa Maria deBarny in the Necce -- Lecce province, near Bari. It was in\nsouth -- south -- on the -- I forgot the name of -- of which one is the Adriatic and which\none is the -- the other sea.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Adriatic. This is the -- This is the west coast. The east coast is -- The east coast 1s\nRome. Naples, the east coast 1s the -- and this is the west coast, is right there. And we\nstayed there in villas, these were villas -- the rich people, they used to have, you know,\nrecreation homes, there was summer homes and winter homes, probably winter homes.\nAnd -- But they were very bad shape now, for several years, nothing was done there, but\nit was still beautiful villas. And so we stayed there for a few months and then the owners\nof the villas wanted to get their villas back, so they moved us to a place near Bari, a camp\nthat was used -- it was a -- this was a Italian military camp before the war and during the\nwar, the ge -- the Fascists kept their internees -- Jews from Germany and from\nYugoslavia, were interned there. Luckily, they didn\u2019t get to them and quite a few of them\nsurvived, see? So a long barracks, without ceilings in the rooms, just the -- like a -- a roof\nand the -- with cubicles where you lived, you know, two, three families in a -- in a little\ncubicle about the size of this room here. We lived with -- in a house, like the\nadministration was before, which was a similar kind of a room and there were again, four\nfamilies. There was a couple, friend of mine, with his wife, lived in one. The partitions\nwere with blankets, there were no -- no permanent walls there. They were in one corner,\nmy brother and wife was another corner and there was a third couple in the third corner\nand a fourth couple in the fourth corner. The -- One of the couples was a Yugoslavian\nrabbi, which was a [indecipherable] not the kind of rabbis I knew that, you know, spoke\nYiddish and -- they spoke Ladino, which is a Jewish language of Sephardic Jews. But we\nrealized all of a sudden, there are some common words there and this was the Hebrew th-\nthat was mixed in with Yiddish and with this Ladino, very interest -- very interesting\ncouple. And we stayed there. This camp was for people mostly who wanted to go to\nAmerica. They had -- most of them had relatives in America. They were get in touch with\nthem and they already -- some of them in possession of affidavits from their relatives in --\nbut it was impossible to come, b-because most of us were Polish born, the Polish quota\nwas -- even though I was cha -- as I was born, it was Russia, the Russia quota wa-was\nempty, so the -- I finally got in in the Russian quota, but my brother couldn\u2019t, they\nchanged it to a German quota. Anyway, a lot of people changed their place of birth in\nEurope, just to get in. But still, I waited from 1946, until 1948, two years. We did nothing\nthere. I did not go back to my kibbutz, I -- I -- I -- I had in my mind to take my brother,\njoin back -- rejoin my kibbutz with him and then go to Israel. But within a few months,\nthey left on illegal boat. You probably heard about the illegal Alliasa [indecipherable]\nyou know, people who -- the -- the -- the Jewish agency and other Jewish organizations\nbought some boats that were not really seaworthy, but loaded them with -- tried to get\npast the -- the British pra -- blo-Blockade, to get them into Palestine. Well, I didn\u2019t go,\nmy brother go -- already had papers from relatives. We found our relatives in America,\nBoston. And he -- he -- As a matter of fact, he put an ad to the paper, to the Jewish\norganizations and the -- there wa -- in the Jewish paper, in New York, Yiddish, looking\nfor his uncle, whose name was Decter. Decter -- the C is pronounced in Polish like a Z,\nso it sounded Dezter. His name was Deecter, actually, but they changed it here to Decter,\na complicated affair. But he put it in the -- in the New York -- the Jewish Forwards,\nwhich still being published now, it\u2019s a weekly, that Rupert and so, so and so\u2019s\n[indecipherable] Slivka is looking for his relatives in the name of David Decter. And he\nassumed that mo -- that most of the Jews lived in Brooklyn, see, who lived in Brooklyn,\nNe-New York. Course, he didn\u2019t know, it so happened he lives in Rhode Island. But my\nan -- aunt used to read the Yiddish paper and she found this name and through another,\ngot in touch, It was -- It was this -- It was this -- Our uncle in Rhode Island, who\n[indecipherable], and that\u2019s how he got in touch with her. And then we had some\nrelatives in Worcester, we had some relatives in Boston, and in Brighton. So he got\nalready papers. I didn\u2019t, but the minute I came, he tried to convince me that we should go\nto America, not to Israel, because it\u2019s -- he had enough war, so did I. He had -- He was in\nthe partisan all through the war. So, he says, \u201cLet American Jew go fight, for I have\nenough fighting.\u201d And we decided not to part and I gave in and we decided we will go to\nAmerica. But, we waited about two years. Finally, 1948, in June 19, I arrived in this\ncountry.",
        "A: I think -- I -- My brother had a job in the local -- they call it a canteen, it was like a\nco-op store that used to sell some groceries, fruits, you know for the inhabitants of the\ncamp. And some had some, but not too much. They used to get the [indecipherable].\nThen I did the bookkeeping for them [indecipherable] a little that -- knew a little bit about\nbookkeeping, so prepared statements for them every month and -- and we -- and then\nother -- we used to go every week to buy stuff, we used to go to the -- Taranto, it\u2019s at the\n-- the -- the tip -- the -- of the boot, of the boot, you know, the ma -- imagine\n[indecipherable] boot about here, [indecipherable] peninsula, right near Sicily. Used to go\nbuy their fruit and vegetables and some other things that people might buy. And a lot of\npeople --they used to have a truck to their disposal, you know, to bring the stuff and a lot\nof people used to do business, used to sneak into the truck, it\u2019s a big, white there -- th-\nthey didn\u2019t have room to -- to load their stuff, because people had their merchandise an-\nand how do you accuse people -- not let -- they make a living this way. But, we were not\ngreat businessmen, so he and I did not do any -- any business. So, it was black market\nthings, you know, just to try to get along somehow. It was -- we -- it took some lessons,\nsome less -- the -- in Italian or in English. I didn\u2019t take right away, I wasted time. It was\nnot -- I don\u2019t know, the mood was not to study, 1t was kind of subdued. We didn\u2019t know\nwe'll be -- we\u2019ll be able to get out, what we going to know, so the time flew by. We were\nfed twice a day [indecipherable]. No, once a day we used to get lunch and then they gave\nus produce products to prepare for ourselves a breakfast, you know, coffee and what else\nand bread. We used to stand in line and get -- we didn\u2019t have the utilities, we didn\u2019t have\nthe -- any cutlery. So we used -- we used cans from margarine, which was just enough to\nget some soup in it, and was unbelievable life.",
        "A: This was the UNRRA, United Nations Rehabilitation. Lasted during distribution. The\nJewish camps were around during -- during distribution, subsidized by the UNRRA.",
        "A: No, this one was not. This was Jewish and there were a lot of Yugoslav non-Jews.\nSerbs -- mostly Serbs, they fought among themselves, Serbs and Croats and -- and\nGreeks, all -- all stateless, all refugees who were waiting to get to some new country\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Very little, very little. We didn\u2019t speak each other\u2019s language, but we tried to get along\nsomehow. Sometimes there was, I mean, friction. There was more friction among the\nCroats and the -- and the Serbs than among Jews and Yugoslavs. So, but we got along\nsomehow. We got the sh -- same rations. Of course we -- we used to get more rations\nfrom the Joint Distribution Committee, which took care of the Jewish refugees and then\nthey had some other church groups that did help support them. It was a community -- a\nfunny community, all different languages, different nationalities. Everybody waiting for\nthat piece paper -- visa to go to -- to America mostly. And some went to Australia with\n[indecipherable]. Some went to Canada. But for Jews it was very difficult.\n[indecipherable] Canada [indecipherable] Jews and so did the United States, but finally\nthere was a -- Truman introduced a law into Congress and they -- to let in all refugees of\nthe second war. So, finally everybody who wanted to come, did come, unless they could\nprove that they\u2019re Nazi. The question were -- we -- we had to go to CIA and they ask\nyou, \u201cWere you a prostitute, were you a Communist, were you a -- a Nazi, were you a\nFascist?\u201d N-Nobody, of course would sa -- tell that he was, but -- and then we had to go\nthrough a medical examination, if you\u2019re healthy. And they checked your documents out,\ngenuine or not. But two years was a very miserable life there. But we -- we organized --\ntried to organize wha -- there were -- there were some children, very few, but there\nwas some children and there was a school, a Jewish school. [indecipherable] didn\u2019t have\nit. Was a Jewish school. We had a library, Jewish and English -- not Jewi -- Yiddish and\nHebrew books and some English books were located 1n it. I learned a little -- little bit --\nvery, very, little English, some Italian, you know, to get along when I went to town. We\nwere -- I remember once going to the opera in -- in Bari, which was quite an event. And -\n- But, was a miserable life. Not enough food, there was food, but nothing like -- too good.\nSo, then I came in 1948, June 19th. It was a Saturday. It was a cloudy day, but I could see\nthe Statue of Liberty. I -- I also -- I told you before that I enjoyed the -- the cro --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, when I made my speech, the so-called icebreaking speech, is bi -- fi-first speech\nyou make is to introduce yourself to the group. I -- I entitled it the -- \u201cI\u2019m an American\nby Choice,\u201d and I spoke about my arrival to this -- to the United States here. I stood there\non the deck bec -- 1-it was a ship, I think it was called the Marine Perch. It was a\nconverted troop ship, so we slept -- there were no -- 1-1-in the -- the bowels of the ship in -\n- on hammocks, like the sailors used to sleep. We were women separately, men\nseparately. And I came with a cousin of mine, from Naples, who was -- he came from\nThriamaca, the town where I was born, I told you about, he died later, in Washington,\nDC. And the -- the minute we came on this ship, they served supper, and I was amazed at\nthe -- the co -- quantity of food. And -- And most, of course, the ship were Italians. This\nwas before the -- the law -- the law was already passed about mat -- matbegin, but I came\nas a regular immigrant, for which I paid. It was paid passen -- you had to pay for -- my --\nmy aunt sent me the money and the boat -- I don\u2019t remember what it cost -- it cost about\n300 dollars that time. Was -- Was a lot of money. And the -- the Italian people stood on\nthe deck in Naples and you know, it was a three -- three story, three decks. Not a big ship,\nbut there was a quite a few people there and they were throwing slices of bread to their\nrelatives, so th-they -- th-the situation -- the [indecipherable] situation apparently was\nvery bad after the war. This was already two years after the war, was still -- was still\noccupied. So -- And I -- We had tables for 10, we were assigned a table and after a few\ndays, [indecipherable], we got to the Mediterranean, it cuts across from the Gibraltar,\nbecomes stormy and people got sick. But I -- I -- There were days when I was all alone at\nthe table. I used to take some oranges to take to my friend and we made a few more other\nfriends, a few more that came from the camps, we met on the ship there, half a dozen\npeople. Yo-You know, we had something in common to talk about, we spoke the same\nlanguage. But there were there days when I was all by myself, and the waiter says --\nurged me to eat. He told me to [indecipherable], and I did. I was always hungry, I could\neat a lot at that time. And I --",
        "A: Not at -- Not today, I -- the last few days, I got a little bit dizzy-like, you know, when\nwe -- the -- the -- it was not too la-large a ship, it didn\u2019t have stabilize-stabilizers in, like\nwe have now. So, it went up and down, up and down and ma -- so [indecipherable] my\nhat, you know, but I did not throw up, I did -- and I did not lose my appetite. I could eat\nall the time. When I came, we stood and we went through Halifax, it took about two\nweeks, a long time. We stopped at Halifax and then we came in to New York. My cousin\ncame to pick me up, but it took some time before the -- we had to go to Custom, but the\nCustom didn\u2019t take long, we -- I didn\u2019t have much, a little suitcase with a change of\nunderwear, that\u2019s all. And I was standing there, I was thinking about the Statue of\nLiberty. I -- I knew about it and I knew about the inscription, which was by a Jewish girl,\nEmma -- Emma -- Emma Lazarus. Give me your tired, you know, your poor and that -- I\n-- I still get a little bit emotional about it and I was thinking, \u201cWh-What\u2019ll happen to\nme?\u201d I don\u2019t -- I -- I -- I didn\u2019t have any trade or profession. I didn\u2019t know the language\nexcept for a few -- a few sentences, probably. And I wondered what -- what -- what\u2019s\ngoing to happen. And then I came down and I met my cousin, he was holding a picture\nand he thought [indecipherable] pictures, well, see, I didn\u2019t look like my picture, because\nthe picture would look too beautiful. I was not as hand -- handsome as he thought I was\nfrom the picture. And he took me to a friend of his, because he -- he had the -- his father-\nin-law lived with them, his wife\u2019s father, who was a observant Jew. They were observant\nalso, but not as -- as strict. And we didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t come in and it was Saturday,\nShabbat, cannot -- [indecipherable] travel. So we waited til sundown and we took a train\nto Boston, and came in and when we came to Boston, we -- Back Bays -- it was Back\nBay station. And we came Commonwealth Avenue, it\u2019s a major thoroughfare in Boston\nand I saw a lot of cars and I thought was a -- it was a demonstration or a -- what do you\ncall it, a -- well, like a -- like a holiday, you know? There were, you know, a lot of cars,\nI\u2019ve never seen this many cars in my life, even, in Naples or Rome, were no-not this\nmany. They lived just off Brighton Ave. We took -- We took a cab. And we came in\nthere and there was their family, my -- my cousin\u2019s wife\u2019s family. They have a large\nfamily. My cousin didn\u2019t have such a bi-big -- only my aunt and he had two sisters. They\nlived in -- one lived in Worcester, one in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. They lived around\nBoston area and they all came to meet me. Th-They were somewhat disappointed. They\nwere very observant, religious Jews and they expected somebody with a beard, you\nknow, ear locks, and this was not it. And they knew -- they knew my parents. They were\nabout the age of my parents, some of them. They may -- And they knew us from home,\nso -- then I got, I told you, I got the -- through them, I got the jo -- some of them lived in\nChelsea and I got the job in the Hebrew school. That la-lasted a couple of weeks. Then I\nwent to Woonsocket and got the job in the Woolweist company, helper on a truck. This\nwas -- I work -- I made union wages. I joined the union right away, a dollar five an hour.\nAnd they took me into a store and bought a suit, you know, on installments, paid 50 cents\na week or a dollar a week. Life was good, I stayed with my aunt. She lived with her\ndaughter. Her name was Decter -- Anna Decter. My uncle was dead already. She died a\nfew years later from cancer. She was my -- my father\u2019s sister.",
        "A: My brother was still in Italy. E-Even though he got his papers before, I got the visa\nfirst. So I came in June, and the minute I start working, I se-sent him money.

I -- I went to pick\nhim up at the -- he also came by boat, but this was a luxury ship, a Italian luxury ship,\nand -- forgot the name of it. And again, we went to school, there was Americanization\nclasses in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. I was this teacher\u2019s star pupil. Name of MacIntosh,\na -- a Scotsman -- Scotsman. And we had -- I already had enough vocabulary so that I\ncould talk to him and most of the class were Ukrainian women who lived -- who came\nbefore the war, but they never learned English. Now, they have to become citizen of the -\n- Social Security started and they had to become citizens, so they had to take the same\nAmericanization classes. But they -- they didn\u2019t know the language. They spoke\nUkrainian, which I understood. There was a Pole, one Pole who had difficult, very\ndifficult -- it\u2019s very difficult to [indecipherable] the English language. I -- I got it very\neasily, so did my brother. He was -- Later, they had a show, you know, to celebrate the --\nI think 1t was Armistice Day [inaudible] -- the melting pot. A co-concept that\u2019s not used\nnow any more. No more melting pot.

So my aunt\nslept in their room and they gave us her room, two of us slept there. And she cooked for\nus. She made sure, in the morning [indecipherable] I leave for work, that I have hot\ncereal. Very nice, this lady.",
        "A: Yes, she told them a-about. And at that time, when I started talking, I -- just like now,\nI -- I break down, co -- even more so. I just st-started crying. In -- In Russia, when I heard\nabou -- I -- I couldn\u2019t cry. I didn\u2019t cry til I come and I didn\u2019t -- no, til I met my brother m1\n-- when we met together, here. But he did not, I did. Now, he cries and -- you just\nmention and he -- he cannot control his emotions. But at that time, my aunt, who used to\ngo -- she was a sick woman, she had hay fever -- fever. So, in the summer, at the end of\nthe summer, she used to go to the White Mountains to spend a few weeks, to ease the\npain of the pollen. But she stayed with us. My cousins went to a few weeks vacation.\nThey went to Narragansett, Narragansett Beach. But she stayed with me and my brother.\nOh, my brother came [inaudible]. She stayed with me, she cook -- and she used to put a\nplate of meat, with this -- and a loaf of bread and I used to clean it up in no time. I\nprobably gained 30 pounds with her, within a few weeks. But I worked hard, so I would\n[indecipherable] some. But I did not observe any diet. loved to eat. It was many years in\nwhich I didn\u2019t have any decent, you know. So, then, when I lost my job fa -- in February,\nthere was a -- a group -- and every town had a group, too, just -- the work that I did later\non, 1-in Portland -- there were some people who did it before, they used to help refugees\nfind jobs, find unemployment, find apartments and so forth, because there were some had\nfamilies and children. So, one took me over. H-He had an appointment to find a job for\nmy brother, but my brother was already working on the job, so he took me. I needed a job\nvery badly. And so he took me to Boston, and I got the job in the suburb of Boston. From\nthe da -- da -- da -- 42 dollars a week, in ra -- I got to 30 -- 30 -- 35 dollars, and I became\na foreman already, I kn-knew enough English and I knew a little bit about the Woolweist\nbusiness, you know, textile, cause I used to work textile before the war also, in Poland.\nSo I became foreman. And then the Korean war started. So, this business started\nbooming, textile. They had -- need uniforms for the army and so forth [indecipherable]\ndid. We re-re-reprocess waste into new stuff. And in the meantime, the fellow that I\nworked for, who was -- he was the chairman of the Republican party in Rhode Island.\nAnd when Truman was elected [indecipherable], no sense in being in business, this is --\nthe -- the country is going to the dogs. He made enough money during the war, so he\nslodi -- sold out. But this fellow in Massachusetts just opened, he started buying stuff and\nsure enough, the Korean war started, he had warehouse full of stuff and the prices went\nup and price controls and -- and wage controls. He says he couldn\u2019t give me a raise, cause\nthere\u2019s wage controls. But the higher pr-priced -- the higher paid employees, he could\nfind, but he didn\u2019t. Anyway, I worked there for about three years, but I was -- in the\nmeantime when I enrolled into Bentley College, which was called that time Bentley\nSchool of Accounting and Finance. And that all they taught us, accounting. So, it worked\nout all right. We get a little apartment, with my brother. And then my brother, who didn\u2019t\nwant to go to fight for, you know, for independent Israel, came to United States and he\nwas draft age -- it wasn\u2019t e-even his real age. They -- They used to think that if you\u2019re\nyoung as kids, easier to get in, so he changed his age. When he came he was drafted,\nKorean war started. And they drafted and took him down. He spent a year in Korea. So,\nhe did not avoid this -- this war. But the only good thing about it, he had, under the bill of\nrights, GI Bill of Rights, he could go to school and they paid the tuition. So he got the\ndegree in -- a degree -- Associate degree in Engineering and a degree in Business\nAdministration and when he graduated, he got a job 1n engineering. But then Boston,\nwhich is, you know, the scientific capital of, you know, state, all of a sudden there was no\none with the -- war ended, the Korean war ended. It was elaborate -- called elaborate\nelectronics [indecipherable] and he lost his job. So, they wanted to give him a job,\ntransfer him, you know, to California or some -- midwest or -- and he -- he -- my sister-\nin-law, he meet um -- met a girl and he married her. So, she didn\u2019t want to leave Boston.\nShe went to Hebrew college, just for the fun of it, she didn\u2019t [indecipherable] her here,\nShe had a little kid and another one. So, she didn\u2019t want to leave Boston, so he decided\nrun business of his own. He op -- ap -- opened a little sandwich shop, which is only --\ntwo degrees, had a little sandwich -- but he made a good living, did all right. Took time.\nAnd I worked 1n this place for three years and then I met Rochelle and we got married.\nThis is the boiler.",
        "A: Well, my sister-in-law and her aunt, both Auschwitz survivors, and they were in\nGermany, my brother\u2019s wife and her aunt who just died lately.

[indecipherable] So, she invited us for dinner and it clicked,\nwe had something in common. Lots in common. We decided to get married.",
        "A: Well, we have the same background, we both attended the same te -- kind of schools\nand we both speak Hebrew. And our education was similar and we both speak Yiddish\nand we both survivors. Of course she -- she survived in Nazi concentration camps and I\nwas in Soviet camps. But we both lost our families, so we have a lot in common.",
        "A: Yeah, I was. I was ready to. I wasn\u2019t economically ready, but figure well, some way\nwe'll sa -- get along. She worked. I was making about 65 dollars a week and she was\nmaking 30 dollars a week. But s-she -- I -- kidding, I -- I told her -- she got herself\npregnant, see? She says, yeah, she got herself preg -- an-and she fell, she would go by the\nstreetcar to work and she fell off, injured herself. But she went to doctors, she\u2019s pregnant,\nso she quit her job, she worked only a few weeks. But somehow we survived on -- on my\nsalary. She never worked since. We -- We lived there for a year, in Boston. We had my\nbachelor apartment, one room studio apartment, a highrise, like. The bed that doubles\ninto a -- so-sofa that doubles into a bed. And we had this table there [indecipherable] a\ngate-like table, it opens up to seat 12. We had party, had 12 people for dinner. There was\na kitchenette and a bathroom, and we managed somehow. After a year, we took -- I\ngraduated and I looked for a job and again, it was very difficult to get -- they used to start\na junior in accounting at that time for half what I was getting my job. So finally, we -- we\nwent -- she had an uncle in Pittsfield, we went to visit them. He wa -- H-He died, but his\nwidow and the kids were -- the son was there, his business, he wanted to go partner and I\nwas not cut out to be this kind of business. But I was looking for an office job. So,\nnothing came of it. It was -- the [indecipherable], then we stopped in Portland, we went\nby train. We stopped in Portland, because she had an aunt here also. And her husband --\nshe was very lonely, she was a sick woman. Her husband was a doctor and he was\noverprotective. She didn\u2019t go out, she was sitting in the house, and -- and she was very --\nshe just fell in love with our little girl. We had a little girl, three months old. She said,\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you move to Portland?\u201d So jokingly, I say, \u201cAll right. Find me a job and we\nmove to Portland.\u201d Came home and in two days she calls me, couple interviews. I came\nand I worked -- I got on this job of office manager for a large furniture store that had --\nsmall chain, they had three stores. Did the bookkeeping and took care of the shipping and\neverything, except selling. Selling I never could do, never knew how. So, I worked for\nthem for 13 years. And then same time, I built up -- I took in some tax work, it was\nevenings, I was working sec -- six days and two evenings, the store was open. And\nfinally I said, I want to work only 40 hours. Because I got enough to do besides that. And\nthen I gave them notice and I am trying to open my own office. So, luckily, the auditor --\nour auditor died -- luckily, I feel -- it so happened, 1t was [indecipherable] feel bad, he\nwas a nice man. And this -- this was my first substantial account, I took it over. Was, you\nknow, tack -- 1t was -- he died just before he got to do audit -- to prepare the tax returns\nfor the -- for the year. So, at age 50, I left a job, which paid a decent salary, to go on my\nown. I didn\u2019t get along with the manager, the manager thought that I am after his job,\nwhich I never -- never intended to. Afterward, we became very good friends -- after I\nquit. And he died also and the -- the fellow I worked for was a very rich man by\nstandards of 40 years ago --yeah, almost 40 -- and he -- he didn\u2019t have any children. So\nall his money that he left, went into a foundation -- a charitable foundation, he was a very\ncharitable man. And I was appointed the trustee to this foundation. So until this day, I\n[indecipherable] enough, and it was a little less than a million now, so about a million\nand a half dollars. And we give away in between 80 and 100,000 dollars a year to\ncharities, to local [indecipherable] of all, religious synagogue he belonged to -- he built a\nsynagogue and a Hebrew day school. And then the Maine Medical Center, which used to\nbe that time, the [inaudible] they used that -- wait a minute, now it\u2019s Maine Medical\nCenter. And he [indecipherable] fund all the Jewish and non-Jewish. [indecipherable] be\nhaving a meeting next week, to meet with the supervisory board that has to approve our\ngrants. We have no -- no -- we cannot -- all we can do, approve or not approve, but I\nmean, the power of the [indecipherable] is ours, myself and one more trustee, which I\nappointed. There was a -- a relative of his before, and he died, so I appoint another in the\nback of three trustees. Until this day, we give away a lot of money. Built the -- Now, they\nare fixing the cemetery where he is buried. We pledged them 50,000 dollars. And the\nHebrew school, which was -- they\u2019re trying to revive, it doesn\u2019t work. Not enough\nparents, [indecipherable] but now this year, there\u2019s a lot of young people who want their\nki-kids to have a Hebrew education, trying to revive this Hebrew day school, a school\nwhich gives secular end religious education. And we gave them 45,000 dollars, too. A\nmatching grant, they have to -- can raise another 45 to get the an educator and an\norganizer to try to get the school. So, this is another thing I\u2019m busy with.",

I -- I always -- since I -- we came to Portland\n[indecipherable] couple of years when I -- before I settled -- after I settled, became\nknown and I started working, I was appointed to the [indecipherable] board. So I have\nbeen active in every Jewish organization in town. And the one -- for a few years I was in\nthe Toastmaster\u2019s International. I was treasurer -- always treasurer, never president. And -\n- So I was busy. The -- Then the immigrants start coming and the city need -- needed\ninterpreters for several -- I -- I was registered, I told you yesterday, _ f-for -- I was\ninterpreter of five languages. There\u2019s Hebrew, Yiddish, there\u2019s Russian, Ukrainian and\nPolish. I worked in all of them. I even -- I wo-worked with Czechs, I don\u2019t know Czech,\nbut is similar to Polish, so -- and they didn\u2019t have anybody. Then I worked to some\nBulgarians, was like Russian. Very similar to Russian. And then I worked with the group\n-- with the -- our sister city is Ar-Archangel, so we used -- exchanged immigrations\nevery year and I used to work with them to go visit, to translate for them. They were very\nhappy with me, they liked it, because they had -- I came in once and they had one -- one\ngroup, they were, I told you, tourist group. I worked with them. We have no problem. But\nthere\u2019s another group, I think it\u2019s fisheries. [indecipherable] the fishing industry. And\nthere was a fellow sitting there -- he -- their interpreter, with two big dictionaries and he\nwanted to transfer some -- translate something, started looking up. So I very seldom had\nto look up a word. Now I -- I can -- can\u2019t remember, but 10 years ago, five years ago, I\nstill could remember. And then I heard them say, \u201cWe were lucky, we got a very good\ninterpreter [indecipherable].\u201d So, the other group came over to me and asked me to try to\ndo something, I says, \u201cI -- I cannot mix in, you know.

So -- And every so often you hear -- some of\nour friends are gone, died. So, if there\u2019s nothing left, might be forgotten. And it shouldn\u2019t\nbe forgotten.

We come t -- go out to eat and\nwe fight, who -- who going to pay -- pick up the check, th -- sa -- sa -- somehow I gave in\nwith him. I have a problem now with him. I used to do his tax return. His and his kids. Of\ncourse, I never charged him for it, never dream of charging him. And now I got a co -- I\ngot a computer. Last year, I did my -- my tax re -- did theirs by hand, an-and a friend of\nmine who had a computer did mine on computer. An-And it was a -- came out exactly --\nso, I ga -- I do th -- there\u2019s also my -- my sister-in-law\u2019s aunt, who died a few months\nago, and I did hers. And his daughter, ma -- my niece, has a computer. She -- She\u2019s a\nlawyer now, as a matter of fact, she works -- she has a job, she didn\u2019t want this, you\nknow, rat race law profession, you work 24 hours a day, [indecipherable]. She wants a\njob where she can take her time, she can work out, you know, she\u2019s -- she\u2019s single, she\u2019s\nin her 30\u2019s, and she wants to enjoy life, and go on vacation. So, she got a job now with --\nshe jus -- she graduated -- you know, she -- for a few years she worked and then she went\nto law school, after college. So she just got -- a few years ago, she got her Maine -- New\nHampshire, sh -- well, she clerked for a co -- for a judge in New Hampshire. So she got\nthe New Hampshire -- she passed the New Hampshire Bar, Maine Bar and Massachusetts\nBar. And she works now for a investment firm, Fidelity -- Fidelity Investment, you know,\nit\u2019s one of the largest in the world and she worked there, you know, in the law\ndepartment. She was -- it was legal [indecipherable] legal. So she -- when I got the\nprogram, the program like this, cost me about 30 dollars. I -- I was -- I -- I was the first\naccountant in Maine to use a -- to use a computer for tax returns, 30 years ago. I paid for\na computer, 25,000 dollars. Now you buy it for 2,000. Besides the 25,000, I had to pay\n5,000 for maintenance of the software, changing the tax -- enhancing the programs and so\non. And five for the hardware. Something goes wrong, which it went a lot, now it -- now\nit\u2019s already no problem, but it was as big as -- twice the size of this table. And it made a\nnoise like it was, you know, it had a -- the first printer was like the ball printer, the IBM\ntypewriters had. Now, of course, you buy a computer for -- for 2,000 dollars, it has\neverything. And you buy a program, a tax program, which has 29 states beside the\nfederal, for 30 dollars. And you don\u2019t even need forms, they -- it prints on plain paper.\nRochelle used to come and to help me, she used to collate the forms and they were with --\nwith carbon. You\u2019d get -- all of a sudden, you start mixing up, you know,\n[indecipherable] paper over the carbon, or the printout are wrong. So, anyway, she -- so,\nsh-she took her -- her aunts, you know, my -- my sister-in-law\u2019s aunt, she put her through\n-- from my handwritten, and put it through their computer. So I told them I'll get a\ncomputer myself, you know, not just [indecipherable] don\u2019t do much, just my family.\nSays I -- Pll get a computer and so, this coming year, I will print you out a computer on\nmy computer, you won\u2019t have to -- so, he sends me a check for 3,000 dollars, to -- to pay\nfor the computer. I said, \u201cWhat do you have? I -- I don\u2019t want you to pay for my com --\u201d\nWe-Well, she died, the son died, she says, she would want you to have some of her\nmoney. I says, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s [indecipherable] to leave it for your children.\u201d So I -- I\ncouldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t help it, so I took the check, you know, I -- but I didn\u2019t deposit it. I\ncame home, I tore out the signature and I have it to keep. He calls me up, \u201cI got my\nstatement, didn\u2019t get my check,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to write you a letter, the minute |\ncan learn how to type.\u201d I\u2019m teaching my computer to read my dic -- you know, type my\ndictation, cause I -- I don\u2019t -- I type [indecipherable] finger here.

Wh-When we go to Florida,\nwe'll have time to train the computer to recognize my voice and -- and type. So I have a\ndifficult time with he -- with him. He\u2019s very generous. And he -- I can -- I cannot fight\nwith him. [indecipherable] is not a fighter, actually, but -- so I -- I have to write him a\nletter. Explain to him I don\u2019t want any -- any money matters between us. W-We are very\ndevoted to each other as we -- we -- we -- as much as we see -- we can see each other.\nWe have problem [indecipherable] so -- so, when he comes here, because Rochelle\nmakes -- usually she makes dinner and sometimes when we go out of course, I have a\ngood excuse. You are my guest, so I pay. But he come there [indecipherable], he was in\nFlorida and came to us for a week the first time, because her aunt used to be sick, she too-\ntook care of her mo -- better than a daughter. Was very, very sick, she wa -- survived\nAuschwitz and Rochelle -- that\u2019s how Rochelle met her. She went to see a friend of hers\nin the hospital and she met her own -- my -- my sister-in-law\u2019s aunt. We became friends.\nSo you can imagine, after the war, she was so sick that they carried her. She weighed\nabout 50 pounds. Nobody expected she survived. But she survived, she married, couldn\u2019t\nhave any children. And he died, she\u2019s -- was my age. She just died a few months ago. So,\nwe are getting along fine.",

If I\nwould have come there originally, just like anybody else, I would have adapted myself to\nthis life. Now I couldn\u2019t. My daughter did, though. She -- I am amazed. When she left for\nIsrael, we gave her six months. We thought, six months, she\u2019ll come back, because she\nlived very well, she had -- the first year in college, she was in a dorm, and then she got an\napartment, with a few other girls. She come from a -- junior year, she had a car and then -\n- and the car was -- and when she used to call up and she says -- says to my wife, she\nsaid, \u201cLet me talk to daddy,\u201d she knew what -- she need some money. So, after she\ngraduated, she didn\u2019t know what -- so she wanted to go to a graduate school. She was\nconsidering either law or journalism. And then she decided she will go to Israel and see\nwhat\u2019s going on. They were looking for teachers and social workers -- English teachers.\nAnd she had a teaching certificate from Brandeis. That\u2019s all she had. And she went there,\nstarted teaching and she hated. For a year, she was in absorption center, learning the\nlanguage. And she went to Brandeis, which is a Jewish college, which had the best\nJudaica courses in the -- in the United States, and she didn\u2019t take a single one. Not the\nlanguage, Hebrew, not a -- no Bible, no anything, nothing. And then she comes there and\nshe gets a job and she says, \u201cI wish I would listen to my father.\u201d Too late. But she speaks\nHebrew now, fluently. She works with immigrants -- English speaking immigrants,\nmostly.

        "A: Iranian Jew.",
        "A: I had -- Well, I was never religious, but I had religious background, I knew about\nreligion, I knew the Bible backward and forward. And I learned it since I was three years\nold, I knew it. I always had a kind of a -- I don\u2019t know how to describe my relationship\nwith religion. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- Rochelle has a hate - love, mostly hate. We -- We have\nproblem when I discuss it with her, I say, \u201cAll right, G-God, if he did do the Holocaust,\nyou know, if G-God did the Holocaust, all right, I can understand your hating him. But at\nthe same time, you agree that He exists. He or She or whatever It is. Because you cannot\nbe -- be mad at something that doesn\u2019t exist, can you?\u201d I partic -- I -- I was active here in\nevery facet of Jewish life in Portland except religious institutions. I belonged to a\nTemple, but I was several times elected to the board, I did not accept it. I did not -- I was\nof the opinion, if you are a leader in a religious organization, you have to at least have set\nsome example of -- of religious practice. And I could not do that. I consider religion --\nJewish religion as part of Jewish culture. It 1s in our past. Is there a God or isn\u2019t a God? I\ncannot determine. | -- I think by my philosophy, I\u2019m agnostic. But I cannot deny -- that\nmeans I cannot deny there isn\u2019t one, nor can there is one. But, the-these tr -- the trappings\nof religion do exist in our culture. This ha -- This is part of our inheritance. We do go on\nhigh holidays. I go, when I have chance, practically every Saturday here, when I\u2019m in\nPortland. And in Florida, there is a big synagogue and you don\u2019t just -- there -- you\u2019re\nnot welcome, as a -- as a Snowbird, w-we are snowbirds. That\u2019s people that stay for the\nseason. They accept membership, you know, for a low fee. Membership are very high\nthere, but for a low fee, for the few months you are there, but they -- you never get --\nyou-you\u2019re a second class member. So we -- I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t join. Once in awhile we go,\nthey had cultural events in the synagogue, shows and concerts, we go there. But that\u2019s\nabout it. Again, to put it in a nutshell, religion is part of our inheritance. I don\u2019t think we\nare ready to give it up yet. The idea would be, if there was one religion, one world\nreligion, where they recognize one force, call it God, call it whatever you want to, a non-\nsectarian. Will it ever be? I don\u2019t know. The Soviet Union tried to suppress religion for\n70 years and they did not succeed. It is strong, it\u2019s alive and people need it in their lives. I\nnever prayed. If I do pray, I pray for national or global salvation. Peace. Very important\nto me. Never -- I never prayed God for myself, help me get a good job, or -- I don\u2019t think\nthis power, which we call God, is designed for individual concern. I envy people that can\nhave a personal religion. This is my God, I pray, you know, and He answers me. If they\nhave it, more power to them. I cannot do that. I see, when I did the prayers, you know,\nthat we say on the high holidays, it\u2019s poetry. The adulation of a power which we call\nGod, see? I can\u2019t understand why do we have to bless God? This a power -- a omnipotent\npower that blesses us, right? So what -- what does my little blessing -- you know, we say\na blessing, in Jewish life, there are lots of blessings, you know, that -- that 613, it\u2019s what?\nCommandments. We have -- whatever you do, you make a blessing. Blessed are thou,\nyou know [indecipherable] brought forth from the soil. But you have to bring it yourself\nfrom the soil. Gives you th-the -- the tools of doing it, see? So, 1-if it\u2019s a blessing, I have\nto ask for a blessing. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019m more important a creature, as a ment, or any\nother creature. So, I have -- I -- I think I\u2019m in that class by myself. I don\u2019t think anybody\nhas the same -- everybody has his own -- his own belief, his own bi -- philosophy. I don\u2019t\nthink -- I\u2019m sure that others have their own, other kinds of philosophies or -- or beliefs, or\nwhatever and they think that theirs is right. But I -- I would like to see if there\u2019s a\nrelationship -- if there has -- a religion has to exist, let there be one. We -- We consider\nourselves the chosen people. Of course, they say we -- we were chosen to teach other\npeoples, but we taught enough -- yeah, we can taught enough. We -- Everybody knows\nthe Christian Right knows the Bible backward and forward, you know, and they use it\njust for their needs, just what they want. They, you know, they quote. But the other thing,\nthe good things are there, which they do not. So, until -- now, you see, you take the\nMuslim world. Religion is upswing in the Muslim, Jewish and Christian. The same even\nwith India, which was a very tolerant -- you know, the Hindu, mostly Hindu, we\u2019ll talk\nabout the -- what do you call it? Eastern religions --",
        "A: Buddim -- Buddhism and the -- the Hindu I think was th-the most liberal one. They\ntolerated other religions. But they -- Now they -- they -- they developed atomic bomb\ninto the Hindu bomb. The -- Pak-Pakistan developed a atomic bomb and it is the Muslim,\nIslamic bomb. So Israel will have a Jewish bomb and Russia has a Russian bomb and we\nstart bringing in religion into politics. The greatest -- The greatest danger to the world 1s\nwhen we come on behalf, we c -- we represent God. [indecipherable] my God, you know.\nThe Germans had on their buckles of the -- the belts, God metoons, God 1s with us. The\nCzars had the same thing in Russian, see? So, th-this is the -- the greatest danger is when\nreligion -- when somebody thinks that he represents the right religion and the others --\noth-others do not. So, unless it is a -- a global religion, one that recognizes the right of\nman, human beings, man [indecipherable]. We have now a rabbi, a woman rabbi and they\ngo and hire a woman cantor. And some women don\u2019t like two women on the pulpit -- on\nthe, you know, stage there. Women. What\u2019s the difference it make if you -- if you have\nthe same rights, why not? They are -- They\u2019re more than 50 percent of population now\nare women. The most important people in my life are women. I have a wife. I have two\ndaughters, I have three granddaughters and three grandsons. So I hope I -- I hope I -- y-\nyou get the gist of what I am talking about, because I myself don\u2019t get it too clear.",
        "A: Oh, it affected me greatly. I -- I -- I lived through unusual times, unusual periods of\nhistory. I lived -- Don\u2019t forget, I was born in a -- during the first World War, that\u2019s 83\nyears ago. There was no electricity in the town I lived, til the day I left it. There was one\nfor -- in the flour mill, it had electricity just for the -- for the -- for one house in the -- the\n-- in the mill. And I came fr-from -- from the wagon, you know, horse and wagon -- horse\nand buggy, from the railroad -- from the -- the invention of electricity to space travel.\nThey were all during my lifetime. Telephone, which I don\u2019t understand eve -- still, how it\nworks, see -- was invented by the time why I was born. I am operating a computer and I\ncan get into a network which has -- I\u2019m trying to find one -- one subject, Yiddish, a\nlanguage of a people which is gone, almost a dead language. It\u2019s trying to be revived by\nnon-Jews studying it. And -- And there\u2019s 590 pages on the computer about Yiddish.\nThere\u2019s thousands of thousands and thousands of pages about science an-and then things\nwhich in my little laptop -- so, I am a product of a -- probably that covered a civilization\nwhich did not change from the fifte -- 1500\u2019s to the 2,000\u2019s. In the span of my lifetime,\nthese things happened. I used to go from -- with the wagon of bu -- a horse and buggy\nfrom Povorsk, from my -- the town where they lived, to Koven, to buy merchandise,\nwhich 1s three -- 33 kilometers. Seven -- 16 miles, all night. Course, there were no paved\nroads, it was sand, it was very difficult to get there. I go now to Israel, 6,000 miles, in the\nsame time, by plane. So, and -- and I still cannot digest it, I cannot understand it. And I\nfind that the -- the human race is way ahead in it\u2019s technology, but way behind in it\u2019s\nconception of life, all together. I think, if you made this much progress, 1-1f you could\nhave made this much progress 1n -- in our lifes with each other, the people\u2019s, countries,\nthe systems, religions, if you could find a way to regulate our lifes to the same measuring\nstick as the technology went, we should be wonderful and be -- be able to get along fine.\nAnd it\u2019s getting worse. That\u2019s what bothers me. I am worried that my grandchildren will\nrun out of food by the time they\u2019re grown up. And I know what it means being hungry. I\nwouldn\u2019t wish it on anybody. An-And the same time, you think -- yo-you don\u2019t see them,\nso you don\u2019t think of them, but the way I do think of it. There are millions of peop --\nchildren every day, die from hunger -- starvation. Every day in the world. Some are\nworried that they got too many people being born. And the same time, the same people\nare dying every day. And -- And I -- I am worried about what -- what will happen, you\nknow, with the developed countries and undeveloped countries. You can see now people\ncoming into the United States, you cannot stop that. You know, from other cultures. But\nnot so much culture, they come from the next door, from Mexico, who cannot --no living\nthere. And th-the world is getting so small. And -- And the -- the means of destruction are\ngetting so awesome, that who knows what will happen? I am worried, worried. And I\nthink something should be done. Course I [indecipherable] one person cannot do much. I\nwish I had the -- the gift of writing -- perhaps write a book about it, what -- what bothers\nme. But I don\u2019t -- This doesn\u2019t answer you question actually, does it? Your questions of\nwhat did I --",
        "A: | -- I cannot give you an answer and I ca -- I -- I can -- I can raise a lot of questions on\nyour question. But how to solve it, I don\u2019t know. There is sitting now a group of people\nin -- in -- in Washington, the same race, believers of one God. They have wa -- wa -- one\nprophet more than we have, see, and -- and they cannot get along. Similar\n[indecipherable], similar languages. Same race. Same race. And we can\u2019t find the way to\n-- to settle their differences. And again, is it because it\u2019s my God 1s -- is the true God and\nI -- the -- the -- there\u2019s a -- there\u2019s a -- a little mountain and -- and a hill in Jerusalem,\nwhere the Jewish Temple stood. And there are Jews that want to build another Temple.\nBut we have been away from there a thousand years -- 2,000 years, and they built another\nsanctuary there. Why can\u2019t people live side by side? It -- It worries me a great deal. Now,\nof course, I have no -- I have no worries about making a living, even though I have\nnightmares. I have very strange nightmares. I -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t have -- I don\u2019t know\nwhere my next meal is coming from. I\u2019m hungry and I haven\u2019t got a few dollars to buy\nmyself a loaf of bread. Which -- It happened during my lifetime. And I -- And I get up,\nyou know, it wakes me up and I really thank God that I ha -- I have -- the refrigerator\u2019s\nfull. And I have, you know, what to live on. And so that the -- the -- the -- the threat 1s\ngone. But I fall asleep and the same -- the same would continue.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning of Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: [indecipherable] convey [indecipherable] my feelings.",
        "A: [inaudible] Maybe I\u2019m incoherent, but I am trying to -- to tell you what worries me\nabout the world.",
        "A: It\u2019s getting even more complicated.",
        "A: Well, I think it was a good idea to interview us, or -- or other survivors, about the time\nfrom liberation, or our arrival in this country. It\u2019s very important, what you could make\nof yourself. Most of us did well, even though we had to pick up pieces and start from the\nbeginning. New country, new language, new customs, new modes of behavior,\neverything\u2019s new. We stepped into it and somehow we did it. I think what the driving\nforce behind it, 1t was kind of a rev-revenge. Revenge of Hitler. And -- And when I --\nwhen I see my grandchildren, I feel it. It\u2019s -- I have two groups of grandchildren, growing\nup in different cultures. I\u2019m trying to keep them together, I\u2019m trying to -- to have them\nsee each other as often as they can and to retain the relationship, even though they\u2019re\ndifferent backgrounds and different ideas, trying to accomplish it. I hope they remember\nme for it. Now for my sake, 1t doesn\u2019t matter, when I am gone, that\u2019s it. But, I might be\nthe common denominator for them. So --",
        "A: Consciously or subconsciously, but it was a part of it. Could -- a lot -- we\naccomplished a lot -- some born Americans did -- could not accomplish, who had all the\nadvantages of language and upbringing and education and we -- we did it. We did it, so --\nwell, the majority. There are a lot of people that are sick and poor among survivors. I\nhope they get the money from -- from sw -- from Switzerland now, so they can live their\nfew -- their last few years in comfort. But there are some. But the majority I think did all\nright, economically. Some countries, [indecipherable] that. We didn\u2019t. We -- We worried\nabout our children, we wanted them to be -- grow up as good human beings. I think, in a\nway, we succeeded. They -- Many think they couldn\u2019t understand us, see? They couldn\u2019t,\nbut the older they get, the smarter we look to them. They finally realized that the-there\nwas -- there was not wasted. Was not wasted, they know. And this is the most important -\n- the most important things in our lives are -- are the children and grandchildren. We\nhope they retain being Jewish, not because we are better than other people, but we are --\nwe are the endangered species. I would like it to survive. We contributed a lot to the\nworld as Jews. So, let us exist as Jews. Again, not because we are better, I hope ev-every\n-- every people have -- can contribute something. That\u2019s why they got rid of, you know,\nthis melting pot, it didn\u2019t work, even though, up to an extent it did work. But I think it\u2019s -\n- they -- it is a -- diversity is very important. Everybody can contribute something to life\nin the -- the -- America -- America itself is a concept that did not exist til -- til -- til\nAmerica. A country of immigrants. A country where everybody contributed something,\ngood or bad, both. A country where th-the patriotism 1s not just religious like in\ntheocracies which exist in this world. A country where you can love just for -- for being\nAmerica. What -- For the freedom, for the opportunity. A lot to be done. A lot yet to be\ndone. It worries me that the -- the Black belligerence, Farrakhan, the Muslim. Not -- Not\nbecause the -- ma -- Islam -- the nation of Islam, the Muslim religion. Fine, if they want\nto believe -- whatever they want to believe, but not to be the -- there\u2019s still a big problem\nfor them to be integrated into this society, into the econ-conomy. Though, a lot of them\ndid already. I hope they succeed more. Otherwise -- Otherwise, there will be a race war\nhere. This\u2019Il be very dangerous.",
        "A: Oh, sure.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- I -- I\u2019m all for it. I\u2019m all for it. I was -- I -- Many times I could not\nunderstand. Like, for instance, the Vietnamese war. The Vietnamese war. I was for\nvictory in Vietnam, because of Communism. But this was entirely different, cause it\u2019s not\nSoviet Communism. It is a nationalism. They fought for -- They fought for the Vietnam,\nnot for Communist [indecipherable], it was Vietnam they wanted. Their own -- Their\nown tradition, their own -- th-the fact that -- what was his name, the leader of -- my\nmemory\u2019s getting bad -- the founder of Vietnamese -- the North Vietnam\n[indecipherable] name. You know, the President of North Vietnam, he adopted\nCommunism. But -- But the Communism, the -- the co -- Soviet Communism collapsed.-\n- such a strong dictatorship, it collapsed. So you see, you cannot rule by force alone. It\u2019s\nimpossible. People have to love their country and to love the -- and this regime, that was\nnot loved and it had to collapse. So, I had many, you know, misconceptions, but as far as\nBlacks are concerned or integration [indecipherable], this has to be -- has to be achieved.\nHas to be achieved.",
        "A: No, I think -- I think I gave you my -- I -- I believe in America. I believe in the -- I\nthink this is a society which will -- it is still being developed, not -- there are many, many\nbad things, which have to be straightened out. I hope we understand [indecipherable]\nbecause our leaders understand it. I hope all the generations younger than I am, you\nknow, could -- we -- I think we on the right track. I think it ta-take some time. Hopefully\nit will be a -- 1t will be a -- some example -- exemplary society, America. We have the\nresources and we have the -- the -- the conditions. We have the historical conditions and\nwe have the human condition, the k-kind of people we have now. And we have a great\nfuture, provided we don\u2019t spoil it ourselves. The most important thing 1s to integrate the\nBlack population, which is 10 percent, that\u2019s a large percentage. Try to inter -- into the\neconomy first. Later on, in the way of thinking, in the philosophy of this country, country\nof minorities, cause there\u2019s no majority left. There\u2019s no single group in the United States\nthat is a majority, except by religion, maybe. Chr-Christian, the Christian religion,\nbecause they will dominate -- but I mean, the split -- the split, you know, there\u2019s\nCatholics and Protestant. Many, many different kinds of [indecipherable]. An-And if they\n-- they succeed in think-thinking this is a Christian country or a Protestant country or a\nCatholic country, itll be a big mistake. We are -- We have to create a new kind of\npatriotism. Patriotism for America, for -- for -- for human -- human beings, for human\nrights.
