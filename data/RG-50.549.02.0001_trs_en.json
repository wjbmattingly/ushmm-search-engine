        "Answer: Well, I'm Dorian Kurz and I came to this country in 1946, after the war,\nwith my brother, we were orphaned during the war and we were brought over here to\nAmerica by family that was living here and the first part of my history was recorded\nby the Holocaust Museum a few years ago.",
        "Question: And your brother's name?",
        "A: My brother's name is Alfred Kurz and we call him Freddy and I will probably be\ncalling him that in the course of this interview. And he lives in New Jersey.",
        "Q: So later on we're very interested in your relationship with your brother and in\ngeneral your relationship with your brother seems to have been the factor that still\nexists in your life, that brought you through that experience, so if we start at, arriving\nin Amsterdam after the war, just in general, the climate of Amsterdam and the\nenvironment there, in your community, how could you describe it?",
        "A: Let's see, I can't answer that specifically. I'm going to drop back from that a little\nbit. At the end of the war, we were liberated from a train that took us out of Bergen-\nBelsen and the aim of the Nazis was to destroy the train, but we were liberated before\nthat could happen, by the Russians. And that happened in a town which later on was\nin East Germany. It was in the spring, in April and eventually, it took three months\nfor the Red Cross to bring us back to Amsterdam, along with the other survivors. My\nmother was still alive and in the course of our train ride, she got typhus, which I had\nhad before that. And she was not well, even before the typhus. She survived the\ncrisis of the typhus in that little town in East Germany and when she was up and\nabout again, the Red Cross made contact with us and brought us through\nLypeseig(ph), which city still exists, back eventually into Holland. Now, a couple of\nrecollections of that time stick out very sharply. In Lypeseig(ph) my, there was a, we\nstayed in an armory of some sort, or a compound that had an armory and outside of\nthat armory, there was a machine, like a clothes wringer in appearance, except there\nwere knives in the middle. You turned some wheel, some lever and there were\nknives inside. And Freddy, my brother, who always had had investigative leanings,\nstuck his finger in there and turned the, turned the lever and cut off the tops of his\nfingers. I remember that because it was a lot of blood and a lot of hoopla and my\nmother very upset and very aggravated and they got him bandaged up and he has\nlittle bumps on three of his fingers, to the, at the top of his finger cause he cut off the\ntop of his fingers, so certainly do remember that. I remember waiting along the way\nsomewhere, in , with lots of other people, waiting for truck transport to move us from\none place to another. I had found in that little town where we were liberated, a doll\nsomebody had left behind. And for that doll, which was really my first toy in a very\nlong time and I was nine, I made little clothing out of little pieces of material and I\nmade a little cradle out of shoe box type of things and I was very attached to that little\ndoll. I put it down somewhere in the midst of that great mass of people waiting to be\ntransported and somebody took it and I cried and cried. It was a great blow.\nEventually we got back into Amsterdam, into a large barracks, I don't know where it\nwas, but you know, it's a child's recollection and I remember being in that large place\nlike, sort of like the barracks we'd had in the camps, but large and lying down and\ntaking a nap and when I woke up, at the foot of my bunk, was my oldest girlfriend,\nNomi(ph) Moskovitz(ph), with whom I grown up and whom I had not seen during\nthe intervening years. And she also, with her family, was in that displaces persons\nfacility and my mother had found her. So, a couple of those things that really stand\nup very sharply. Eventually we were out of those barracks and into our old\napartment.",
        "Q: I just wanted to ask before we went...",
        "A: I can tell you what, what happened with Nomi(ph), I mean that's fine. I didn't, I\nsaw Nomi(ph) for a few times in the following year. She and her family also moved\nback to Amsterdam. She had two brothers, one brother and at the time before the war\nand after the war she had some more siblings, her parents had some more children\nand it was quite remarkable because her father was sent to a separate place, separate\nconcentration camp from Nomi(ph) and her mother and miraculously that family\nsurvived and was reunited after the war. I will come back, I will tell you more about\nNomi(ph) in a while. She remained in Amsterdam, eventually she was married and\nshe moved to Israel and the last time I saw Nomi(ph) was in March of 1946 and then\ndid not see her again until 1959, which was my first trip to Israel and I had that trip,\non that trip I started out going to Europe first and went through Holland and saw her\nparents and they gave me her address in Israel and I am a blonde and blue eyed and\nNomi(ph) has a dark complexion, very dark eyes and black hair and we have, we\nwere friends from the time we were in nursery school, four and I always felt, I guess\nbecause it was in Holland and I was blonde and blue eyed, that I was ordinary and\nlooked like everyone else and that she was beautiful because she was so different\nlooking, so dark and she had long black hair and I was envious of her. In 1959 when\nI had not seen her for 13 years and in that time we had both gone from being girls to\nbeing women. She had been married, I was not and I visited her in Israel, there, I got\nsuch a shock because there was this big, fat woman, very large and it was Nomi(ph)\nand we were unable to communicate on any level, almost entirely, there was some\ninanities just that went, were between us and totally, you know, but we had been sort\nof like sisters, we slept in each others house __, it was exactly like two people\nfrom other planets and I have not been in touch with her since, so that's about it. I\nwill, I will go back now to my time in, in Amsterdam. So eventually, and I don't\nknow how my mother accomplished that, we got back our apartment. At the time we\nwere arrested in the middle of the night and we moved, the apartment was taken from\nus and our furniture was done away with and I suppose there must have been some\nresettlement commission and my mother got back our apartment and we went back\ninto it, but she, my mother was really quite sick at that time already and we lived in\nthat apartment a very short time and my mother was hospitalized and...",
        "Q: None of the furniture was there, none of the same?",
        "A: None of the furniture was there, no, not at all. The furniture my parents had had\nwas made in Vienna, custom made to order for my parents by a well known architect\nand none of that was there. But, my, there was some simple furniture that my mother\nhad. We were not there very long before it was impossible for my mother to continue\nas she was and she was moved to the hospital, the apartment was still ours and she\nunderwent some surgery and Freddy and I went to live with friends of my parents, I\nwill allude briefly, I mentioned those people when I made the visual tape because\nthose were the people who were in our apartment the night the Gestapo came. Those\nwere, that was the family that my mother was hiding and they had resettled after the\nwar, they were all hidden, the members of that family whose name was Roos, R-o-o-\ns. They had been in, separately under hadoken(ph) and they were reassembled after\nthe war and they were living in a little town called Rainin(ph) in Holland, about an\nhour and a half outside of Amsterdam and they lived in a house on a dike, it was a\nsmall farming town and Freddy and I went to live with them while my mother was\nnot well. Eventually my mother was brought back to the apartment and she did\nlinger until March of 1946, when she died. So for those nine months that she was ill,\nwe were most of time living with the family Roos in Rainin(ph) on the dike and I\ntherefore am not really, I, there's not a whole lot I can say about Amsterdam and what\nhappened to it. The only times we were brought in was to visit my mother and that\nnot very often, once every couple of months, she...",
        "Q: She was far away?",
        "A: She was in Amsterdam and... [ringing phone]",
        "Q: So, we've been interrupted, but we have been discussing how you and your\nbrother coped together with the loss of your mother.",
        "A: That, that answer is really on so many different levels. I would tell you from\ntoday's point of view, looking back as an adult person, that I'm not, I think I'm pretty\nmentally stable, fairly so, | mean no worse than most people, but I attribute that in\nvery large part to the, to two facts. The most important is that I have a brother. I\nthink I would not really have managed without, because he was my root. In general\nI, I think today that children can survive almost anything as long as they are confident\nin the care and love of a parent. And although, I mean obviously my history, my\nchildhood was not a very good childhood, looked at it from that point of view. Still,\nif I compare myself to the children I read about in the paper who suffer abuse at the\nhands of their parents, I had a rosy childhood in comparison. Because even looking\nback from here, surely there were moments of fear and lots of horrible things that I, I\nlooked at, but I never doubted my survival and I always felt secure when my mommy\nwas there and I was fortunate in that, that mother was not an hysterical sort. She\nmade it, 1t seem okay and I came through the war never doubting that we'd come\nthrough, in fact I remember lots of talk about, you know, with my mother about after\nthe war, when my father, whom we called Poppy, would be back and we never\ndoubted that. And after the war, directly after the war, while my mother was still\nalive, we talked a great deal about when she would get better and in that year it\ncertainly began to dawn on me that she was not getting better, but it was in\nconceivable because that was grounded in my security. Now we were very lucky\nbecause we knew, Freddy and I, from a very early age on, that we had lots of family\nelsewhere, in America and my mother drilled us consistently in addresses, in\nPalestine, where her brother lived and in America, where my father's family was and\nso I guess she figured if she wasn't going to make it through, she wanted us to have a\nplace that we would go to. It was a very close family and directly after the war, of\ncourse contact was made with them again and in fact, one of my father's brothers\ncame to Amsterdam not long after the war and he got, he got a passport, he got a visa\nand he was able to come and to arrange for my mother's care and also to start to\narrange for our coming to America and so by the time I was told that my mother had\nnot long to live and by the time I, we internalized that, we knew that we were not\ngoing to be in an orphanage, for example, we knew that we were going to America\nand so we were looking forward to that. So the fact that we survived emotionally,\nfairly, fairly emotionally stable, both of us, certainly is due to the type of person my\nmother was, the fact that we had a loving relationship and the fact that we were\nconfident in that close family that we had overseas. Now, for me, I think the\nimportance of my brother really happens after that, it's after we come here. Once,\nonce my mother died and my own roots were gone, in that sense, you know my, my\nparents were gone and, and Holland was gone, even though I was here with loving\naunt and uncle, still, it and, and a loving aunt and uncle who had been very close to\nmy parents so, my parents were talked about, it wasn't like, you know, I was with\nstrange people who had no idea about my background, but still it was the fact that I\nhad a brother that gave me a feeling of belonging. With my own history, belonging\nto something that had started when I started, when I was born. And that has\nincreased 1n importance, or that did increase in importance to me, in the years that we\nwere growing up in America. I say that despite the fact that we entered a wonderful\nhome and you know, that we were cared for and loved, but, but children don't give up\nwhat's theirs easily and my background was mine. And my brother was the only one\nwho had really shared it and who, you know, we'd had the same experiences, we had\nseen the same things, the bad stuff and we were very close. Now, besides that, I was\nthe older of the two of us by 16 months and my mother would always, you know,\nblame me when we had fights, cause I was the older one, I should know better and\nshe had always made me be responsible when, when we were, for some reason, you\nknow, it was up to me, so when she died, I felt definitely a responsibility for him and\nfor us as a brother-sister team and for values such as religious observance, that we\nhad learned there, I mean I jealously guarded those parts of our background that I\nthought were important for us and that would have been important for my parents.\nAnd I spun them into a little private thing between us. And because we were very\nclose in age, we really were close personally as well, we related well. To this day\nthere's certainly no one in the world with whom I fight as much as I do with him.\nWe, we can barely be in each other's company for 10 minutes without one of us\nscreaming at the other. We certainly don't have the same points of view and we see\nlife differently and he's a man, I'm a woman, so that already is different and, but\nunderlying it, there is a very deep love and respect that goes both ways. For my 60th\nbirthday my brother gave me a surprise party 1n a restaurant here in New York and he\nmade a speech, I, he never, he never says anything nice, he never gives a compliment\nto anyone's face, he'll never say you look nice, or that's great, what you did, never.\nBut that man got up there and made a speech about me which was unbelievable. He's\na kind, he's a more closed person than I am and that was one of the few times in his\nlife ever, that the window was opened. And I didn't, I never needed those words, you\nknow, to kind of let me know that it is a two way street because he's done much more\nme in my life. We've tried to do for each other. But he's always been there for me\nand I know and I've said it many times, that if God forbid I had lost him, I, I wouldn't\nhave made it, I am sure of that.",
        "Q: Thinking of you and your brother and going back to the time between your\nmother died, when you actually got on the boat and then the trip over to America,\nyou mentioned your being vehement about your little secrets and religious\nobservances, was your faith, were you able to practice it together with the community\nduring that time, or was it important at all?",
        "A: I'm sorry, I don't know which time you mean now?",
        "Q: The time from, between your mother's passing and your getting to America, that\ntransition of time before you were with your family.",
        "A: See again, this is not an easy answer. My mother was a very observant women in\nterms of the practice of Judaism, but she was never dogmatic. And she was very\nclever about the way she, she tried to instill that into Freddy and me. I never\nremember her saying you cannot do this on, on, on Shabbas(ph) or you can't eat this\nand that together, I never remember her saying that, but I read from a very early age\nand one day, for example, I found, I loved books, and I found a book lying around, I\nlooked at 1t and there were pictures in it and, and I tried to read it but some of the\nwords were too big and I asked about it and she said, \"Oh, well, if you want me to, I'll\nread you story.\" And you know, that was a book of bible stories. Well she did\neverything in that way, she tried to make things likable and fun, so whatever practice\nwe did, it was never onerous in any way, it was always in a good context, so I can't\neven tell you that I knew about the laws of Kashrut or the laws of, of Saturday as\nsuch, I don't know that I could have verbalized them, but I knew what we did and\ndidn't do with my mother and tried to continue to do that. Well, we grew up in, after\nthe war, first in the house of those people in, in Rainin(ph) and they were also\nobservant to a degree, but I know there was no kosher food to be had, or kosher meat\nto be had in Holland at that time, especially where we were. I cannot imagine that the\nfood that we ate after the war was, was kosher, but I don't remember being in agony\nor anything of the sort. So I know there was no meat served at the table with butter\nor milk, for example, but I don't remember ever questioning like where did, there\nwasn't that much meat, but I don't remember questioning where the meat came from,\nwe were just happy to have any sort of food. And so the people with whom we\nstayed certainly were not against observing because they had come from an observant\nbackground as well. And when I came to America, my aunt and uncle, my uncle was\nmy father's brother and my aunt, the lady who we grew up with, Lillian, she came\nfrom a very observant house, probably more so than the house that my parents had\ngrown up in and so there was no problem about observance. In the interim, between\nthe time we left Holland and the time we came to America, well, okay, I'll talk about\nthat for a little bit. I already mentioned that one of my father's brothers came over to\nHolland, and that was my Uncle Charlie and my father's, my father and his brother\nhad world wide optical business before the war and we had an office in Amsterdam\nand so he came over both to take, look after my mother and Freddy and me and also I\nthink, to see what was left from a business point of view. And he spent many, several\nmonths actually, in Holland. He was there when my mother died. And he came to\nvisit us, also stay with us in Rainin(ph), in that little town where we were, just a quick\nlittle aside there, I mean, this little town in Holland was not up to the minute in\ntechnology and the house we had really, literally was on a dike. A dike, a dike 1s\nreally a road, it's like the river ran below and then on the, as you know Holland is\nvery flat, so from the river to the land next to the river is just a flat continuation and\nthen a dike was built up high, like a wall and at the top of the wall they paved it and\nthat was a road. And then on the other side of the road there were houses, so that's\nwhere we lived. And, but there was no central heating for example and there was a\nbig pot-bellied stove in the living room, one of those black things and we fed it coal\nand wood and it heated up the living room, but the bedrooms, which were up on the\nsecond floor, didn't have any heat and anyone who's ever been in the low countries or\nin Germany in the wintertime, you know that things are very cold there, but this is\nwhat we were used to and it certainly didn't bother us, but when my Uncle Charlie\ncame to stay with us, see, that was in the middle of the winter and he, there was, it\nwas a little house and the family Roos had two boys and there was Freddy and me\nand so there were only a certain number of bedrooms and so my Uncle Charlie\nshared our bed, in a big large bed and I remember trying to sleep all night and\ncouldn't because my poor Uncle Charlie was just trying to hold onto us for warmth,\nhe was literally all night, you could hear his teeth rattling and he was physically\nshaking. And so, anyway, but he was there when my mother died and then it was\nvery hard to get, get visas to move people, including children from western Europe to\nAmerica, because everybody was trying to come to America. And my uncle with\nwhom I was going to live when I came to America, my Uncle Benjamin, who was\nanother brother of my father, in order to get Freddy and me to have a visa to come to\nAmerica, went to Washington to see President Truman and he got for us a special\npermit, read into the Congress of the United States, to give us priority to come in,\nwhich is how we managed to get in by the following August, August of '46 and while\nmy Uncle Benjamin was trying for that and my Uncle Charlie was in Europe, it was\narranged that after my mother died, that Freddy and I, in order to get a visa, should\nbe, should go to Sweden to establish residency there and from there, once we had our\nvisa, to come to the United States and eventually that is what happened. We left, we\nleft...",
        "Q: Why Sweden?",
        "A: I think the American consulate was open in Sweden, but the American consulate\nwas not yet open in Amsterdam and maybe because Sweden was a neutral country, I,\nI, I don't know the politics of the thing, but apparently something like that. It was\npossible to get the visa from Sweden and we got a priority because we were orphaned\nand because my Uncle Benjamin never took no for an answer on anything and just\nwent straight to the head man. He got to the outer office of President Truman and got\nto his aide and arranged for that. So my mother died in March and March of '46 and\nFreddy and I were brought to Amsterdam for the funeral and after the funeral they\ntook me to see Nomi(ph), to say good-bye to her because we knew we were going to\ngo to America and then shortly thereafter we flew to Sweden and we were taken to\nSweden by our Uncle Roos, the man whom we had been living with, he was not\nreally an uncle, he was just friends, but we called him, his name was Abraham,\nAb(ph) Roos, so he flew with us to, to Sweden, where my Uncle Charlie was and so\nwe hooked up with my Uncle Charlie there. That plane trip, going to Sweden, I\nremember very vividly because I...",
        "Q: Your first?",
        "A: It was my first plane trip, but I was, I had a terrible case of car sickness as a child,\nI, I couldn't even get into a car without throwing up. And this was a fairly small\nplane, not a very nice day and, and, and it put me off flying for decades. That was a\nthree hour trip. All I remember is that that plane kept going up and falling down,\ngoing up and falling down. Must have hit, you know, it was a prop plane, it flew\nunder the clouds, it hit all those air pockets and went down and even though we had\nnot seen an orange in our recollection, Freddy and I, they gave out oranges on that\nplane, I filled up every little bag, just threw up that entire trip. Sat next to the man\nwho was taking us, you know, Mr. Roos and Freddy was sitting in a jump seat and at\nsome point they found Freddy trying to open up the door next to him, I remember\nthat and they rushed, they rushed him away from that little, 1t was like a parachute\nseat they had him sitting in and he was fooling around with the door. We got to\nStockholm at the end of the day, stayed in a hotel which we called the\nconteenantalb(ph), this is Hotel Continental, across from the railroad station, we got\nthere late at night and my Uncle Charlie was there and we, we, we both remember\nthis first meal that we had there because Holland was still pretty bare after the war,\nyou certainly couldn't get a whole lot of exotic food products and for us exotic was\npretty well everything, like oranges, you know, were very exotic. And so eggs were\nhard to come by and so on, so we got in there pretty late at night, I guess about 10\no'clock we, we were taken into the dining room to have a meal because we hadn't\neaten very much and so Freddy immediately ordered to eggs and so we ate supper\nand then went to bed, where Freddy threw up all night. I mean, they'd said it was\nbecause he ate too much rich food after not having had rich food for a long time, but I\ndon't know. Anyway he was sick all night. Two men, my Uncle Charlie and Ab(ph)\nRoos, trying to comfort a little boy who was throwing up all night and I'm sure they\nwere wishing that there was some woman with them who knew what to do better. I\nstayed in Stockholm for awhile. We lived with a family who's last name escapes me\nfor a couple of weeks and then my uncle, my, Ab(ph) Roos went back to Holland and\nmy Uncle Charlie arranged for Freddy and me to be moved to a boarding school for\nthe summer because he had to go back to America, my Uncle Charlie and somebody\nhad to look after us, so they put us into some boarding school in the country, in the\nwoods outside of Stockholm and we spent the summer there. The caretaker, of\ncourse all the boys were gone from that boarding school, the caretaking family was\npaid to look after us and by some stroke of fortune, they spoke German and of course\nmy, I had, I mean my parents spoke German, that was there native language so that\nwas my first language and Dutch was my second language. And so they had a\ndaughter my age, so that summer was spent, her name was Marisha(ph), Mousey and\nso that summer was spent in, in the company of that little girl. Oh, lots of things\nabout that summer, first of all my Uncle Charlie...",
        "Q: Let's go to the other side while we go, can you...",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Can you hold that thought a moment? Okay, we're moving to side two.\n[end of side one, tape 1]",
        "A: I was speaking about the things in Stockholm. Most noteworthy was, still while\nboth men were with us, my Uncle Charlie and Ab(ph) Roos, they, we all went\nwalking, I, I just remember rivers and bridges in the city of Stockholm and sunshine\nand most of all what I remember, I, what I, I guess I consider today to be\nsupermarket, there was stores that just had racks and racks of food, fruit and food,\nwhich just boggled our minds. And I must say that even today when I think about tt,\nI'm amazed at that, that in, in Europe after the war, there were countries that were\nbare of all those things and countries that just, just had it up the kazoo. I mean, we\njust hadn't seen fruit for, all over, the stores, by, by the late spring and summer of\n1946 in Sweden, perhaps they'd always had it, I don't know, but they were just full of\nit and we, we couldn't imagine that. It was an upbeat time for us, even though we\nspoke a lot about my mother and the fact that she'd died and that made us sad, but we\nwere, Freddy and I, looking forward a lot to America. And so then they moved us to\nthat boarding school. Somewhere in the course of that summer I got my first taste of\nbubble gum, tried to learn how to blow bubbles. It must have been a pretty austere\nboarding school because the shock was the first morning when we got up, we went to\nbreakfast and they served us, what seemed to me to be sour milk and what I now\nknow to be rye crisps and I couldn't eat it. By the end of the summer I liked it quite a\nlot, but it's, I, I've, I've talked to people since and that was a fairly standard Swedish\nbreakfast, which is yogurt and rye crisp but I considered it sour milk and crackers, I\nthought it was awful.",
        "Q: Your friend, who you were mentioning, who you spent the whole summer with, is\nthis beyond the boarding, before the boarding school, or?",
        "A: That was in the boarding school, her family were caretakers there. Maybe while\nall the teachers and the children were gone, they were caretakers and we spent a lot of\ntime playing make believe. My Uncle Charlie had taken us on a shopping binge and\nI had noticed in a store, nightgowns, long nightgowns and you know I was 10 years\nold and they were long nightgowns with pretty little puffy sleeves and I made him\nbuy me a pink and a blue and they became princess gowns, I wore one and Mousey\nwore the other and we made Freddy be the prince. Spent a lot of time running\nthrough the woods, make believe like that. Anyway, in the course of that summer,\nour visa came through and the, Mousey's mother, the lady who spoke German and\nwith whom we were able to communicate to, brought us to Gurtaberg(ph), from\nwhere the ship we were to sail on, sailed. And the ship was the Grippsholm(ph),\nGrippsholm(ph) and so Freddy and I set sail. It was a two week trip from Sweden to\nAmerica, I don't know why is should have taken that long. We were put into separate\nstate rooms, I shared mine with three women, two upper bunks, two lower bunks and\nFreddy shared his with three men on a different deck. And that made me very\nanxious. The lady who took us to the ship had arranged for a single maiden lady to\neat her meals with us. Somewhere around the third day out there was a drill, you\nknow, in case something happened to the ship, but everybody forgot to tell me it was\na drill and so in the middle of the sirens and the whistles blowing, we were told to get\non deck and, and we were assigned to lifeboats and to my horror, we were assigned\nto different lifeboats. And I wouldn't let go of him, I was just screaming and crying.\nNobody told me that the ship wasn't going down. It was only afterwards that I\nlearned that. I, L..",
        "Q: Did they end up letting you be together? Stay together?",
        "A: I don't remember. Somewhere I found out it wasn't for real, I guess. But I just\nremember screaming and crying a lot. I contracted a skin condition which I, _,\nwe knew if was called impetigo, it's very painful and extremely contagious and the\nfear was that I would not be allowed into America, because they, they weren't\nallowing anything contagious in. Penicillin had come on the scene not long before\nand the ship's doctor decided to give me a regimen of penicillin every three hours,\nmorning and night, so four times a day and four times at night, they would come to\nmy bunk in the ship and give me shot in my rear end. It didn't help. By the time we\ncame to America, I was still full of impetigo and eventually, unfortunately gave it to\nthe whole family in America, including the two year old child, but in order to hide the\ncondition, I was put into gloves. I mean the lady who was eating meals with us and\nwho looked after to make sure that we didn't fall off the ship I guess, took care to put\nme into a pair of gloves and when we arrived in America, I guess that we, this was\nnow August fifth, 1946. We were still among the first wave of orphaned children\nthat were allowed in after the war and I guess the, the newspapers got lists of\ncelebrities that were expected on these various ships and then would go to meet the\nship and try to get a story and so at some point that, first of all, the morning of our\narrival, lots of hoopla, everybody was saying, oh, you've got to look, there is Long\nIsland, so some people were saying they were going to live on that long island, cause\nyou could see the land mass sticking out and Freddy and I, we said, no, no, we, we're\nnot going to live on Long Island, we're living at 503 Fifth Avenue, which was the\naddress my mother had hammered into our heads, cause that was where the optical\noffice was, Kurz Optical was there, so we told everybody we were going to be living\nat 503 Fifth Avenue. Some man came up, who turned out to be a reporter and who\nwanted to take our pictures, so he cast about for an interesting shot and found the\nlifeboy, the round lifeboy that says Grippesholm(ph) on it and posed Freddy and me\nwith our faces through it and took pictures which later appeared in the New York\nTimes and which I have copies. And me wearing one glove on the impetigo hand,\nyes. My hair, which was still very short because of the lice and all, it hadn't grown\nback completely yet. I was very small, I, you know, the difference in heights, Freddy\nand me and what we were and where we got to be shortly afterward is quite dramatic\nas we, we grew a lot. When my Uncle Benjamin was allowed on board, which was\npretty early on because we were alone, two children alone, traveling, he found us\nperched on top of the railing of the ship. I mean that reporter has, had sat us the top\nof the railing of the ship, without any regard for our safety and Uncle Benjamin came\nup, gave that man a real piece of his mind. So lots of hoopla, we had a suitcase, we\ncame down off the gangplank, through that big pier, where my, two of my aunts were\nwaiting for me.",
        "Q: This was at Ellis Island?",
        "A: No, it was no more Ellis Island, straight into the docks in New York?",
        "Q: It would have been then, Battery Park?",
        "A: No, I think it was not, I think it was in the 20's or the teens, it was on one of the\nlower slips, one of the lower berths. And my father's sister, my Aunt Lola was there\nto meet us and as well as Charlie's wife Karola(ph), the three had come to meet us on\nthe ship and vividly I remember that as soon as I left that large pier, that building, my\nfirst step to the outside, I bumped into somebody who cursed me out very roundly. I\nmust have stepped on her toe or something, but. And so then we took a taxi to\nBrighton(ph) Beach, Brooklyn, where my Uncle Benjamin and my Aunt Lillian,\nwhom we call Aunt Leah, where they lived, in Brighton(ph) Beach, they lived in a\ntwo room apartment, living room and a bedroom. They had two children, Diana,\nwho's my age and Vivian who was two. And Diana was in camp, this was August\nthe fifth, she was in camp for the summer and Vivian was home, she was a little girl.",
        "Q: Were these people who you had not yet met, except for your Uncle Benjamin?",
        "A: I had not met my Uncle Benjamin, that 1s to say, now within my recollection,\nactually they had met me, but I was very small, then by the time they went to\nAmerica, I was, last time I saw them I was two and a half or something, so they knew\nme, but I didn't know them. So this was, my Uncle Benjamin had not been to\nEurope, it was my Uncle Charlie who came to Europe. My Uncle Benjamin and my\nAunt Leah, whom I lived with, who I was to live with, I had not met them. So this\nwas my first meeting with them.",
        "Q: So your connection with your brother, as you've mentioned many times before, at\nthis point was crucial to your feeling at home?",
        "A: Very much so, very much so. And then you know how it is when you, when you\nenter a new family, there are, if children are especially children who are the same age\nand Diana and I are three months apart, there are lots of adjustments and\naccommodations that children have to make and there are, there is lots of power play\nthat goes on and where before Diana was queen in her own castle, except for a two\nyear old sister and you know, there were eight years between her and her sister, she\ncame back from camp to find two siblings of the same age and it was a very rough\nadjustment and there was a lot of politicking among the three of us as alliances got\npushed and pulled. And so certainly my, my feeling of needing my brother were, or\nusing him in alliances certainly, that was intensified.",
        "Q: And the language?",
        "A: Well, yes, that, lots of things to be said about that. To our great good fortune, my\nAunt Leah had spent some years of her young womanhood in Holland, so she spoke\nDutch. I spoke German pretty fluently and indeed still do, it's a children's German. If\nyou want to engage me in a conversation about genetics, I won't do so well, but if you\nwant to talk about the ordinary, every day things, I'm pretty fluent. You know, what\nchildren tend to talk about I can do pretty well and so I didn't have a problem\ncommunicating because both Benjamin and Leah spoke German, Leah spoke Dutch.\nAnd I want to tell you that a child left to his or her own devices picks up a language\nvery quickly. I arrived here on August the fifth, I went to school at the beginning of\nSeptember and by that time I spoke English. And it's true, I mean, they got a lady to\ncome in and teach us something, but that didn't do a whole lot, the truth is...",
        "Q: Did you also study in Sweden?",
        "A: No. The truth is, a child that goes, it's one of the reasons I feel so very strongly\nagainst what is happening in the school system to allow children to stay in their\nnative language. A child left to his own devices picks up a language, a young child,\nvery quickly. English was my third language. I had started school in Brighton(ph)\nBeach, Brooklyn, at PS 225, with Mrs. Field, in class 5A. I will say that in the course\nof that first term, I, I got to speak English fluently. I didn't get to write it perfectly\nwell, in fact I have compositions from that first half year and the English 1s funny,\ncause I write what I hear. All of a sudden I wrote as A-I-f-e-r-s-u-d-d-e-n, all of a\nsudden. And lots of my compositions which were kept from that time are funny\nbecause you can see that I spoke it all right, I just didn't know what I was saying and\nso I wrote it. By the way, Dutch 1s a very exact language, you write exactly what you\nhear, so I tried doing that in English and of course that, it's amusing to read now. But\nanyway by the time it became apparent it was impossible in two rooms for six people\nto live, we moved to Kew Gardens and into a little house and then the second half of\nmy fifth grade I had in, I started Kew Gardens in a new school.",
        "Q: So you came and you started in what grade?",
        "A: In 5A. I was just going to say something about that, I, before we were deported\nto, to concentration camps, I had only had the first grade. And that was it. I think I\nhad a couple of weeks of the second grade and then after the war, after we came back\nin Rainin(ph), I, they, they kind of, I mean lots of children had, had not had proper\nschooling and I kind of had the third grade, sort of. And then we left that in the\nmiddle, see and then we came to America and in Sweden I didn't go to school of\ncourse and then, it was only over the summer, was only a few months. And then I\ncame here and they tested me and I went into the fifth grade, which was the proper\ngrade for a 10 year old to go into. And of course, education in Europe is a little\ndifferent. In first grade we had learned addition, subtraction, multiplication and\ndivision and so by the time after the war, when I was trying to play catch up in the\nthird grade, other children also did that. When I came to America, children in the\nfifth grade were about to learn long division, which I knew how to do, so they put me\ninto the fifth grade and the truth is I learned English very quickly. I mean the part of\nthe curriculum that I was backwards on was history because in America they only\nlearn history of the United States in the early grades and I knew nothing. Geography\nof the United States, course I didn't know anything about that and literature because I\nhad not read children's books, but I was a voracious reader and loved reading. So,\nwhat I'm, what I'm ending up with here, so when we moved to Kew Gardens and we\nwere registered in PS 99, I vividly remember that first morning after the, my Aunt\nLeah took us in and registered us and the principal called for some young girl who\nbrought us to our classrooms. I was brought into my 5B classroom feeling very self-\nconscious, school was more formal in those days, everybody was sitting at their seat\nwith their hands clasped and the little girl brought me in to the class and my teacher\nturned to the class and said, \"Now this 1s a little orphan girl from Europe. She doesn't\nspeak any English and I want you all to be very nice to her.\" And of course I spoke\nEnglish quite as well as anyone else, possibly with a little bit of an accent, but I had a\ndilemma because [| didn't know whether to make her into a liar or whether I should\njust keep my mouth shut and not let her know that I spoke pretty fluently.",
        "Q: I assume that she was not Jewish?",
        "A: No, she was not Jewish, but I, but I mean she, she didn't mean this badly, she\nreally thought that I was not able to converse and she was going to try to make my\ntransition easier, but of course I spoke it fluently and I had a problem afterwards with\nhow to, how to handle that. So I went to school sketchily in my early years but it\ndidn't do me any harm and I graduated valedictorian in the eight grade.",
        "Q: Did the, did the students and teachers have any idea about your past, about where\nyou had come from, what you had been through?",
        "A: I, I don't think the students certainly did. At some point my teacher did, she, my\nteacher also was the quote, sewing teacher for the school and so one afternoon when\nwe had sewing, she got me aside and had me tell her the story and so I know she was\ncurious and she had me talk about it. But listen, it isn't just that those children didn't\nknow about it, people didn't talk about it here, nobody talked about it.",
        "Q: Your family neither?",
        "A: In my family, my parents were part of the conversation because my father was my\nUncle Benjamin's brother and my mother and my Aunt Leah had been best friends in\nthe time they were young wives and they'd had their children together and spent a lot\nof time in each other's company, so the conversation was much about the times gone\nby. But not, they did not try to draw me out on the experiences during the war. Once\nin awhile they got into the conversation or I would mention something, but they\ndidn't try to make me talk about it. And certainly, other people, outsiders of the\nfamily, this was not a subject of conversation, first of all, many Jewish people who\nwe knew had similar histories. Everybody, I guess, had lost people. It was a subject\nvery painful for a lot of people, it was raw, it was part of their own lives, or else they\nhad lost people to these kind of things and there was I think also a feeling that they've\nbeen through enough, why should we make them talk about it. It's only really in the\n1980's that this became a subject for general conversation, it was not done. And there\nwas also a feeling, certainly in the 50's, 40's and 50's that one tried to shield children\nfrom hearing bad things, 1t wasn't like now when violence is an every day thing on\nthe TV. It would not, you, one would not have put a child in the position of telling\nother children about these experiences, it would have been deemed not proper.",
        "Q: Between the fifth and the eighth grade, was the eighth grade where you were\nvaledictorian?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you know other Jewish children?",
        "A: I would venture...",
        "Q: Other then your relatives?",
        "A: I would venture to say that my school in Kew Gardens was 80 percent Jewish.\nMaybe not 80 perhaps in those years it was 60 percent Jewish. We certainly\nwouldn't, my aunt and uncle would not have moved into a community that did not\nhave synagogues and you know and other Jewish children.",
        "Q: Was going to the synagogue an important part of your life?",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. I, we were affiliated, I went to the Hebrew school after\nschool, five, four days a week. Went to the synagogue on Saturday morning, did that\neven when no one else went. Both Freddy and I did that. And Freddy was Bar\nMitzvahed at there and I became active when I was old enough to do that, _ being\na leader in the youth center and you know, it was very much a focal point of my\nexistence. I retained the observance as I thought my mother would have wanted me\nto and Freddy was a little bit more lax about that as boys are wont to do and that\ncaused me some aggravation and it was important enough for me so that when I went\nto high school, Forest Hills High School, the social life revolved around sororities,\nwhich meant Friday nights. I did not join a sorority and I was pretty well an outsider,\nI was an oddball and I had ambitions for the stage and joined play production and\neventually did get a role or two and walked from my house in Kew Gardens to those\nperformances in Forest Hills High School on Friday night and Saturday and did that\nwith a lot of trepidation. And religion has remained to this day, certainly an\nimportant thing, important core in my life.",
        "Q: How about being an American, was there a point at which or can you identify a\npoint which you began to feel like an American?",
        "A: I pretty quickly, I pretty quickly internalized some American things that made me\nfeel good about America. For one thing, I want to remind you, that in the 1940's and\n'50's, children entered school in the morning, stood up and pledged allegiance to the\nflag every day and stood up when the flag came, when you heard the Star Spangled\nBanner and those of us, not just those of us who were refugees and came here, but\npeople of that era, to this day, are more patriotic, if such a thing 1s possible to say,\nthan young people who are growing up today. We tend to honor the flag and all that.\nIn addition to that, my Uncle Benjamin thought of America as the land of savior, you\nknow, they were, they were also refugees as was all my family, I mean we were all,\nmy whole family, there was nobody really in America, everybody was in Europe.\nAnd I have correspondence from my parents to their family and friend, hundreds of\nletters that got saved and sent and kept with my mother's artifacts, with non-Jews\nduring the war and I, I have possession of those. And I've spent really hours looking\nat those and what emerges from them is this tremendous feeling of people that are\nbound up with hundreds, a far flung family, you married and you then acquired your\nspouse\ns family as well and your spouse's spouse's. They drew in their family and then you\nbecame family with the spouse's spouse's spouse's. And so I have letters like that, the\nmiddle of a tremendous network, it was a very close merging of family and friends, I\nmean it was one thing. And so when all of that got stopped one day by that maniac in\nGermany and everybody tried to get out, those who made it and who made it here\nand who worked hard and reestablished themselves, my Uncle Benjamin came here\nwith a few dollars in his hands one day, got on the subway from Brooklyn, where he\nwas dropped off after he arrived here, took the subway, which, I mean he didn't even\nknow his way, had heard about 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue, got instruction how to\ngo there, found an office on the fifth floor walkup and opened his office and he and\nhe became a successful optical wholesaler again, you know. He considered America\nas the golden land, the land that had saved him. He considered President Truman\nsomewhere up there with the deities. And there was a lot of talk about that, I mean\nwe respected America as I did as a land that had given us, you know, a chance to\ncome and to, to work and so we were very patriotic. I remind you also that not until\n20 years later was there any criticism above the president at the time, President\nRoosevelt and the Congress for not, you know, opening up the door and saving\npeople, which of course in retrospect we all realize should have happened but at that\ntime, I mean we went, everyone, all the Jewish refugees and the non-Jewish refugees\nwho came to America after the war found this a land of opportunity and equality and\nyou know, place where you could start and didn't matter what you had been, if you\nwanted to become something you could and we were very patriotic about that and I\ninternalized that very fast. I became a citizen on my, at my own right, since I had no\nparents, so you know, I had to and I was, I was old enough so requirements for\ncitizenship for me were until I was 18 I was not a citizen so at the age of 18 I was\nsworn in, 1n Abbot's(ph) field, I went with Freddy.",
        "Q: But Freddy couldn't?",
        "A: No, Freddy became a citizen in his own right when he became 18. The ceremony\nwas in Abbot's(ph) field, was crowded, crowded, it was a beautiful day, I was sworn\nin and somewhere, along with the other 20,000 people who were there, we all stood\nand we took the oath, I was very proud to do that and some reporter was roaming\naround saying, \"Anybody here have an interesting story?\" You know, but I wasn't\ngoing to push myself forward on that, but as he went past me, I said to him, \"Well, I\nwas interviewed when I came here.\" He said, \"Oh,\" and he, and he took my story, so\nI have an article about me on the day I came to the United States with picture and I\nhave an article about me on the day I became a citizen.",
        "Q: Do you remember the date?",
        "A: No. I know it was in the spring and the sun was shining and it was Abbot's(ph)\nfield.",
        "Q: Let's go to the other side. We're moving now to tape two.\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2",
        "Q: Not only becoming 18 is a major passage of life, but becoming an American\ncitizen is a major passage of life and how your life proceeded into a new passage and\nhow maybe the past always had some influence on that, from there.",
        "A: Well, after high school, I went to college. For a lot of reasons I did not pursue\ngoing out of town. A lot of reasons and I applied to Queens College and I applied to\nBarnett(ph) here in New York, women's undergraduate part of Columbia University\nand I was accepted Barnard with a scholarship, a partial scholarship, Freddy was still\nin Kew Gardens, living there, his last year of high school and so I commuted. In\nthose years it was still possible to put yourself through college, a thing that is no\nlonger possible, but when I started Barnard it was 823 dollars a year. I had a 350\ndollar scholarship. I had received something called a general _ foundation\nscholarship when I graduated high school, which paid me 25 dollars a semester,\nwhich I used toward textbooks, in the plural, cause you could do that cause we went\nto use, to buy used textbooks, 1t was possible. I worked at the synagogue youth\ncenter and made money that way. I worked summers as drama counselor in camps,\nso that I got paid more than other counseloring jobs. And I took a job every single\nJune with Olsen's(ph) Temporary Service. And it was quite possible to, if you, if you\nhad your living taken care of and I was living in Kew Gardens and eating, for a\nyoung person to go to school and pay their tuition with the help of a scholarship, that\nwas quite possible. Course it would not have been possible if, if I could not have\nlived at home in, in Kew Gardens, but even the tuition, which is unthinkable today, I\nmean no young person can possibly do that, but that was possible so I went to\nBarnard and spent the four years there. Never felt myself to be very pretty...",
        "Q: You're kidding?",
        "A: Certainly in high school I felt odd man out and my friends were oddballs, we, I\nwas not, I tried to belong to the in crowd, I, I never quite could. In Forest Hills High\nSchool they took, at the end of our freshman year, they, they culled out of the student\nbody of 800 I think approximately of my year, they took 36 of us whom they tested at\nthe end of the first year, based on our achievement of the first year and they put us\ntogether for all the math and science of the balance of the four years, they tried to\ngive us five years in four. And so I kind of traveled with the elite intellects of, of, of\nthe class, for those four years and I was always a studier, school didn't come easy, I, I\nalways had to work very hard, I spent a lot of hours studying, as opposed to my\nbrother. My brother used to come home and complain that every, he had too much\nwork, everything was too much work and then he'd sit down like for 15 or 20 minutes\nwith the pencil writing furiously and then one time I looked up and he was __ putting\non his sneakers and I said, \"Where are you going?\" And he said, \"I'm going to play\nbasketball in the schoolyard and I said, \"Well, you've just, you've just been\ncomplaining you have too much work , so what are you doing?\" He said, \"Well now\nI've made a schedule and what to do and I know when I'm studying for what, so now\nthis is the schedule for playing ball.\" See now, I never was able to do that, see I\nwould get nervous and bite my nails and work and study, so, there were some people\nin that group of thirty-something that they culled out, that really were extremely\ngifted in math and in science and I didn't have an easy time hanging on, but I did very\nwell in high school, I graduated the 10th, I think in, in, in the 800, I was number 10, I\nthink I had a 92.8 average or something like that, I was fine and so I had been pretty\nspoiled cause I'd done pretty well, all of my school years, I was, I was always an A\nstudent and in fact, I tell you what I remember, in the first grade, my mother made a\nbig fuss, because in Europe their marking system was to 10, I mean 100 was 10. I\nbrought back my report card in first grade, I had a 10 in everything and an eight in\npenmanship and she wouldn't let me forget that. It was only in later years that I\nfound a copy of my mother's report cards in elementary school, she was definitely a C\nstudent all the way, which I thought was quite extraordinary. But anyway, I was\nspoiled and I had, I had always had an easy time in school. I went into Barnard and I\nwas not happy. I was outclassed by a mile. Barnard had, certainly at that time, a\nlarge percentage of it's students had come from private schools. I was a product of\nthe public school system and most of it, Forest Hills High School, was definitely one\nof the top high schools in the city, but we had done things by rote. ______ you learn\nsomething, you memorized it, you took a test and you spewed it back out. I got to\ncollege, I had to write a term paper, I had never written a term paper in my life, I\ndidn't even know how to go about it. I mean, what we wrote were more like\ncompositions, but there were no term paper, a research paper? I hadn't the foggiest\nnotion. I had girls in the class who had been doing independent research at Barnard\nyou know, people who really knew what they were doing and I, I was under pressure\nto maintain my scholarship and I hadn't yet learned how to sift out the important stuff\nfrom the unimportant, so I tried very hard to keep up on all of it and you couldn't. So,\nI had no time while I was in college to learn anything. I, I just spend my time doing,\nbut not learning and I regret that a lot. I don't have good recollections of those four\nyears, they were very tense all the time. When I was growing up and I knew I\ncouldn't be an actress cause it would not work well with my, with my religious\ninclinations not to work on Saturday, I probably wouldn't have made a go of it\nanyway, but anyway, I, I, I gave up my pretensions for that, I decided to be a\nschoolteacher, I had worked with children all of my life when I could have been\nconsidered not a child. I'd done the youth service and camps and I really was very\ngood with children and I was going to be a schoolteacher. So when I came out of\nBarnard, I, I became a teacher of the fifth grade. I had done my student teaching at\nthe Dalton School and then taught fifth grade at Ridgewood, which is on the\nBrooklyn-Queens borderline. And somewhere in that first year I decided that all my\nlife I had been in a classroom. I started out on one side of the desk and now I was on\nthe other side of the desk and I was curious to see what life was like in New York as\na grown person, not in a classroom. So I decided to take a year off. I took that trip,\nthis was now, I graduated college in '58, so I taught school for '58 to summer '59 and\nI went to Europe and Israel, that was that, that summer, that trip. Freddy had\ngraduated college that year and he also, he decided not to wait, to work a year, he\ndecided to, to go to Europe that year too, we went separately. He left before me and\nhe took a ship across and then he rented a car on the continent, a little Renault\nDefeen(ph), which looks like a tin can that you can pick up. But I had already been\nworking for a year and I decided to do it, Freddy was going to stay at youth hostels\nall over and my mother's mother, my grandmother was alive in Israel still at that time\nand we decided to combine our trips, individual trips to Europe by meeting in Rome\ntowards the end of the summer and going to Israel together to visit my grandmother,\nwhom we knew, she had come to America in the intervening years to visit with my\nmother's sister, my Aunt Mary and had gone back to Israel and so we went\nindividually to Europe and Freddy, we, we went to see Freddy off on the ship on the\nday that he sailed and he also was seen off by the lady who became my sister-in-law,\nRachel and that was really when I first realized that she might very well be, become\nmy sister-in-law. And Freddy and I had agreed to give each other messages\nwhenever we were in a city, by leaving each other messages in the American Express\noffices, so that whenever we came, because that's where we picked up mail in those\nyears. If you went around with a very loose itinerary, you know, I knew I was going\nto England and then from England to Holland and from Holland to France and he had\nhis loose schedule, without knowing what hotels we were going to, but so that was\nhow people frequently communicated. And so I did that and he did that and we\nwould find messages from each other. And then I left a message for him when I got\nto Geneva. I got to Geneva on a Friday and on Saturday he appeared in my, in my\nhotel because he had gone to American Express, picked up and, and he found my\nnote and he knew where I was staying, so we decided then to travel from Switzerland\nthrough Italy to Rome together, since we were supposed to meet in Rome anyway in\na matter of two weeks. I didn't have a car and he had the Renault Defeen(ph). We\nshould have never done that, bad mistake. Because we left Geneva the next day and\ngot into a car accident almost immediately. Poor Freddy, he really felt very bad\nabout that. We were driving along on a country lane, there was a tiny little car in\nfront of us and that man suddenly made a left turn, into a field of wheat. I mean we,\nwe, we, it was just, we didn't know there was a road there, to make a left turn and we\nbanged into him with our little tin can, I was thrown up against the windshield and\nbroke my nose. Actually we didn't know I broke my nose, but I was bleeding and,\nand I said to Freddy, whose German was not terrific any more, I said, \"Don't worry\nabout it, I'll handle it.\" And out of the car, like a little circus car, came this huge man.\nAnd he spoke what is known as SwitzerDutch(ph), which is absolutely not related to\nthe German that I, I mean I couldn't understand him, he couldn't understand me, it\nwas a terrible situation. Anyway we got it sorted out, we were towed and we got into\na hotel near Lausanne and had to lay up there for three days while the car was\nrepaired. Some lady doctor came to the hotel, assured me my nose was not broken,\nbut it really was, cause I have the, I can feel it to this day. And in the course of those\nthree days, it was Freddy's birthday. We went to the top of the yungfrau(ph) together\nand we fought terribly and came evening times, I mean my brother was a 22 year old\nyoung man on the loose in Europe and he wanted to have a good time, but he felt\nresponsible for the sister so he started hanging around with me in the evening, it\ndidn't work. At three days we decided this was not good and he went his way and I\nwent my way by train and we met up in Rome, as we were planned to and then went\nto Israel happily together and then drove back afterwards to Paris and...",

        "A: It was very special, my grandmother was actually, whom we had seen a few years\nbefore that, my grandmother was living in Israel with her son, my mother's brother\nand his family, in Tel Aviv. And actually I had never met my, my mother's brother,\nmy uncle Elias(ph) and his family and so it was a very, very special 10 days that we\nwere all together. And it was my first trip to Israel and that was a exciting thing. As\nI told you, my mother had rehearsed Freddy and me in addresses, in case we were\nseparated during the war and one address was 503 Fifth Avenue and the other one\nwas 108 Benyahuda(ph) Street, which was in Tel Aviv, which was her brother. So of\ncourse my mother had told us a lot about her family there and my Uncle Elias(ph),\nher, her, her brother and his children, one of whom was close in age to Freddy and\nme. And so it was a very nice experience and the first of my visits to Israel. And\nwhen I came back to America after that summer, I told you I had decided to take\nsome time out from teaching and I decided to make myself available to the business\nworld. So, having been an academic students, not what we used to call commercial\nstudents in those days, you went to high school, you either got an academic diploma\nor a commercial diploma, I of course was academic, I had always stuck my nose up at\nthings like typing and shorthand and had a three finger method of typing my papers\nin college. So when I offered myself to the business world, you see, nobody wanted\nme. They all wanted to know what I could do. I said, \"Well what do you mean, what\nI can do, I'm intelligent, I'm a Barnard graduate, I was a teacher.\" And they would\nsay, \"Yes, yes, but what can you do, can you type? Can you do shorthand?\" Again I\nwant to tell you, this is the 50's now. Freddy went to Columbia and I went to\nBarnard. When he graduated, the recruiters came to Columbia and be interviewed by\nthe young men graduating. On my side of Broadway there was no such a thing as a\nrecruiter, our top English graduate got a scholarship to I think, secretarial school.\nWhen a girl wanted to go into publishing, she was advised she should go in as a\ntypist or secretary and work her way up. I venture to say not a boy was told that. I\nthink too, even, even at Barnard and Barnard really has a tradition of professional, of\nwomen who be, who've entered the professions, but most, most of them did not do\nthat. I mean not very many went to medical school or law school, law school\ncertainly not in those years. It's only in retrospect that I realize I should have gone to\nlaw school, a thought that never entered my mind and I probably would have been\ngood as a lawyer, because my mind works that way. But at those, in those years,\ncertainly, there were things women, professions like teaching that women thought\nabout readily and the others you didn't. We concentrated more on working and, and\ngetting married and having children and so we weren't fixated on careers for a\nlifetime, we were interested in having interesting work experiences, but not\nnecessarily lifetime careers. There was a lot of talk about teaching is a good\nprofession cause you get the summers off, you know, that kind of thing. Certainly\nthat has been a great thing of the women's movement I think, the fact that women are,\nare, are encouraged to think about working as a fulfillment of life, perhaps not all\ngood in the sense of what happens to children today, but certainly, if I think back, that\nit never dawned on my, you know, to go for... And this was from a school where\nthere was a lot of emphasis on that, the president of Barnard at the time was a woman\nwho encouraged that a lot. So...",
        "Q: So Freddy was at Columbia and you were at Barnard, still together...",
        "A: Well...",
        "Q: In parallel.",
        "A: Well together in the sense that, you know, if we were not going out of town, if we\nwere not going to be going out of town and staying in New York, then, in terms of\nIvy League schools or the top of the heap, there was Columbia and, and since we\nwere not going to be able to dorm, most of the people who graduated with us, if they\ndid not dorm, went on to Queen's College, you know, in their backyards and then,\nyou know, lived at home, if you're going to live at home, that was as close as we\ncame, so, yeah we were together, but that was really not because we were together,\nit's because we both were able to qualify for top schools and, and that was the top\nschool, certainly within commuting distance, I commuted every day, it was more than\nan hour each way.",
        "Q: And he still lived in the home also?",
        "A: He lived at home also.",
        "Q: And after his graduating...",
        "A: Well he took, you see he, he, my mother had, my mother's brother in Israel,\nElias(ph) had been trained as an engineer and my mother got it into her head early on,\nshe used to tell, Freddy used to be found with hammers and nails and taking things\napart and exploring so she always said he's going to be an engineer just like her\nbrother and I guess that stuck in his mind and he in fact took a five year engineering\nprogram at Columbia and, which they were able to do in four years, he came out with\na BS instead of a BA, having done two years in the engineering school and he\ngraduated with an engineering degree as, so yes, then he graduated the year after me\nand he announced that he was going to get married to that young lady, who name is\nRachel and she 1s his wife today, they have three children, live in New Jersey, Cherry\nHill, New Jersey and that is where he has lived, really since he graduated, he, at the\nend of college the recruiters came and Freddy accepted a job with RCA which was in\nCamden, New Jersey. To my great relief because he had spend time in California\nand all that and I was terrified that he was going to move to California and I guess I\nwould have moved with him by that time. So when they were married, they moved\nin commuting distance to his work in, in, in Camden, so they moved to\nHaddenfield(ph) in the Cherry Hill area and have moved, you know, from that little\ngarden apartment into a house and then into the home that they still occupy in Cherry\nHill. They had, eventually, three children, the oldest, Natalie, who is now 30 years\nold and the two twins, who were born triplets, and were triplets for a few days and\nthose young ladies are now going to be 28 and the twins are married and Natalie will\nget married this September. They are the love of my life. My sister-in-law and my\nbrother have been very generous in letting me share 1n those children's upbringing, I,\nI did it with malice aforethought, I made them my little dumplings from the time that\nthey recognized me and have spent a lot of time with them, took them on cruises and\ntrips to the Caribbean in their growing up years and in general, you know, have\ninveigled myself into their hearts and lives, so that to this day, they are my friends\nand indeed, the oldest one, Natalie, lives in an apartment that I own not far from here,\nthe one that I lived in before I moved here. And she live on 58th Street and since she\nis now a grown woman, I have been very fortunate in having her not only live near\nme, but like me enough to make me her friend and so we, we do things together, we\ngo to the opera and the theater together and you know, I, I don't have children of my\nown, a thing that I mind a lot. And the fact that I've had these three children and my\nsister-in-law has generously allowed me to really be part of their lives and not\nresented me for that. Being an aunt, you know, it, it's like being a grandparent, I\nguess, it's the best of all possible worlds, you have none of the responsibility for\ndiscipline and all the opportunity for bribery by being nice and so, you know, if a\nmother and father are resentful, it can make that hard. Rachel and Freddy have been\nvery generous and have allowed me to do my bit with them, so that they've been as\nclose as, you know, it is possible for nieces to be.",
        "Q: I have nieces also, I relate, identify with what you're talking about. I, I wanted to\nask you something that you had talked about before and that was that there was time\nwhen no one talked about these experiences and you, you mentioned the 80's and\nhow, when people started talking. When people started talking, for instance with\nyour nieces, have you talked with them, have they asked you or when did you begin\nto feel that it was, was all right for you to talk about this?",
        "A: I always thought so, I, I never had a problem talking about it, but you know, it's\nnot something you, you didn't go around playing with your friends and say, oh by the\nway, do you know that this and this, what happened to me, I mean it was not, you\njust didn't do that. But when it came up, I, I have always considered the war years a\npart of my life in the following way, first of all, my recollection of my parents in\nintimately bound up with that. I mean I can't separate the war years from my\nrecollections of my mother and my father and so I certainly was, I guess I've made\nthat clear by now that I, I find my, my mother's memory to be a very important thing\nto me and I had no intention of glossing over her life or my recollection of her life\nand, and that's part and parcel of those years, so I have never had difficulty thinking\nback, cause I have always wanted to remember her and that's part of it and I've really\nnot ever had a problem discussing it, I've never found that I broke down or couldn't\ntalk about it in any way. I've always been able to do that, I felt, in the early years,\ncertainly in the 50's, as a child, you don't want to be different so you don't call\nattention to those kinds of things and as a, as a grown up I always try to make sure\nthat if the subject came up that I didn't bore people to tears with it or you know, had\nthem morbidly interested in me as a freak of some kind, but I never minded talking\nabout it. I always thought, you know, that that was okay.",
        "Q: Was there talk, was there room, was there space, I'm talking about a kind of a\nintellectual, emotional space within the context of your religious community, the\nsynagogue, to talk about, was this an important...",
        "A: No, again, you asked first about my class, were there other Jews, that I, did know\nother Jews besides my family? Well, for the most part you know, people tend to\nmove where there are people like them, so I don't know where you're from but\ncertainly Jewish people tend to move to communities, especially observant Jews, tend\nto move to communities where there are other observant Jews, so we did that, that\nwas Kew Gardens. There were no other refugees from the war in my school when I\nwent to that school, not children who actually were survivors. There were children of\nchildren who were survivors, but not actual children, so Freddy and I were different\nin that way, but you know, ____ when it came to our synagogue, I guess 80 percent\nof them had fled Hitler at some point between the 30's and the 40's and so the\ndifference again was that the children in my synagogue, again were not the survivors,\nbut their, but their parents were the survivors so this wasn't strange for anyone. I\ndon't know if you know but in the Jewish religion there is a memorial prayer for the\ndead that is said on the festival holidays, on the last day of the festival holidays and it\nis traditional for the people who still have parents to not remain inside the sanctuary\nat the time that this is said, so they go out and they come back in after that prayer is\nsaid. Well I was very conscious of the fact, in the growing up years that there weren't\nany other children that hung around for that prayer. But in no other way, I think the\npeople, when we first moved in, since everybody was refugees, my family were also\nrefugees and there wasn't much made of that. Some people knew that of course I did\nnot call the adults with me mother and father or mom and dad, but aunt and uncle.\nAnd so, but there was a time when that was pretty common among survivors you\nknow, so yeah, there's, it didn't become a commonplace today, you know, when\npeople hear that I am a survivor, I, I notice their pupils dilate and they look at me\nwith a newfound interest, even people I've known. I got a call about a year ago, from\nmy accountant. I have a business in New York now and I have an accountant. When\nI started with this accountant he was a young man of no consequence. Now he's the\nbiggest accounting firm on Long Island. And I don't have day to day contact with\nhim, I work with somebody who is employed by him. Well, I got a phone call and it\nsaid, \"Miss Kurz? Hold the phone for a moment for Mr. Isrelloff(ph).\" So I got, I\nheld on the the phone and Bob Isrelloff(ph) came on. \"Hey,\" he said, \"Dorian(ph), I\njust came back from Washington, I visited the Holocaust Museum and I pushed some\nbuttons on an interacting and I was just amazed, there was a name there, Dorian(ph)\nKurz and I said to myself, well there can only be one of those and I pressed the\nbutton and there you were on the screen, I had no idea.\" Well, now Bob Isrelloff(ph)\nhasn't made a call to me in perhaps 20 years, you see, but the fact that I was one of\nthe survivors caught his interest and that has happened to me a couple of times. It 1s\nnow that people find you interesting or oddball or noteworthy, if you are a survivor.\nIn the 40's and 50's this was not noteworthy, it was more commonplace. You ask\nabout my nieces and whether they were, when they were growing up, were interested.\nI will tell you that when I was invited to do the, the history for the Holocaust\nMuseum, which I, the visual one that I gave in 1990, one of the reasons that I was\nkeen on doing it was not so much for historical reasons, because I knew there were\nmany people who could give their histories, but one of the reasons I wanted to do it\nwas because I was told I would have a copy of that tape and I wanted my brother's\nchildren to have that visual story because again, growing up, I mean children are not\nvery interested. You know, when, I was born in the year 1936. When people talk\nabout the first World War, I glaze over a little bit, it's somewhere there before I was\nborn and you know how things are before you were born, they're ancient history, they\nhave no relevance. Well, my nieces were born, not just after World War 2, but a long\ntime after World, World War 2, World War 1, what do they know one from the other\nor the Civil War, the Revolutionary War, the Crimean War, I mean it's all one to\npeople who weren't living at that time and I want them to know the story and I was\nanxious for them to have a copy of it. And, so that was definitely one of the reasons\nthat I was keen to do that visual history. And that made me think about other\nchildren who maybe didn't have an aunt or a father who were survivors, who should\nhave an opportunity, if they link in, to, to get stories, you know, even in 200 years.\nWe, we hear today, stories about the Revolutionary War and we don't relate to it\ndirectly and we don't have George Washington or the soldiers of the continental army\nto really talk about it. It would make it more immediate, it would make it not so long\ntime ago and what relevance does it have to us and I think those histories are\nimportant for that reason. Not just for to counteract the revisionists, but to allow\nanother generation to make this not be ancient history, but to pull it up into something\nthat happened to another person, who looks just like them, it's real, it happened to that\nperson that I'm looking at. In the case of my nieces, it will be more immediate than\nthat and they are women now and married and they're going to have families of their\nown very shortly and those children will grow up and hear about the events of World\nWar 2 and what happened to people, the Jews and other in that time. And I want\nthose, I want my brother's grandchildren to look at those visuals and see those visuals\nas something that happened really to them, because their father almost did not\nsurvive, which meant that those children were not going to be. And for other\nchildren, who do not have direct contact in a linear way with the events of that time, I\nthink seeing an actual film of a survivor will cause them to have more connection to\nthat than when we hear about the Revolutionary War. So I think that it is important\nfrom that point of view.",
        "Q: I do too. I want to move over to the other side.\n[end of side one, tape 2]",
        "Q: We're going to have some, just final thoughts and then Dorian has to go to work.",
        "A: She does. Well I don't know, final thoughts are kind of hard. I, I, I have a couple\nof them, I guess. I notice that both Freddy and I are doers, we're very practical\npeople. I think that that is a direct result of our early lives. We, we are, we tend, we\nare survivors in more ways than one. I am not a complainer. I tend to take\ncommand, I tend to grab ahold of my life and make things happen. It turned out I\ncouldn't get a job when I, I was always saying, you know, nobody wanted me and all\nthat and eventually I learned how to do some shorthand and___ around in a couple\nof jobs for a couple of years and it became apparent to me that I couldn't really work\nfor others, I had to work for myself and I opened up a store. I have been a retailer\nnow, on some scale or other, since 1965 and have a pretty large store right now, takes\nup about a half a block and I have 13 employees. And I find I become more bossy\nand more take charge as I go along. I, but I'm very, I am and have been very practical\nand I tend to, not kind of sit back and let life happen. I notice Freddy is the same\nway. We are more controlling and definitely tend to manipulate our lives, rather than\nto be manipulated by it and I think that's very good. In a way, we are both stronger\npeople, I think, than many of the people that I meet. Most certainly there are scars,\nnow I did not marry. I did have a relationship for 30 years with a man whom I could\nnot marry. Consequently I don't have children. He was an older man, almost twice\nmy age when we met and I knew that I should not be in that relationship, but I was\nunable to help myself, I, I, I had a nervous breakdown a couple of times when I tried,\nespecially in the early years to stop that. I lay that off directly on my early years. I\nneeded to be loved and admired by an older man and I needed that support and that\nego lift. And I, I think, that is, is a direct result of the loss of my parents. My father\nwhen I was six and my mother later, I think I needed that. I needed to be the special\nperson in somebody's life again. And that, of course, affected my personal life, even\nin the fact that, the fact that I'm a retailer, cause you know, I mean, then if you don't\nhave a normal marriage and children, then you do other things and so what I did is I\nreally filled up my life and all the little nooks and crannies so now I don't have any\ntime to myself at all. And Freddy, who does have a family and a lovely wife and\nwonderful children, well that still, he is a very closed up person. He was not invited\nto make that original tape at the Holocaust Museum, he came with me that day. His\nmemory of the early years is much more sketchy than mine and sometimes when I\ntalk, he will remember something, it's much more sketchy. He now gives talks, as a\nsurvivor, to schools in his area quite frequently. He started doing that since my tape\nwas made. But he is a much more closed person, he is emotionally, I hope he never\nhears this tape...",
        "Q: I don't think he would.",
        "A: He, he is much more closed person than I am, he, I said, like he never gives out\ncompliments or anything. He, he'll never say that he loves somebody or he, that he,\nhe's not a person who hugs and he's much more emotionally closed up. Partly he's a\nman, I'm a woman, it's, I'm, I'm, I'm more open than he is, but the fact that he is\nclosed up like that, that he's not able to express his feelings. Like I said, he did it for\nme on my 60th birthday, the window opened and I was amazed and then it closed up\nagain, see, so, but he's much more closed up and I, I, I think that's a direct result of\nour early lives, absolutely. What happens to you as a child always affects, for every\none of us and why should it not be so for us? In a way it has made me stronger,\ncertainly more self-reliant. When my mother died, in my heart I took responsibility\nfor my younger brother and maybe he did that in his heart for me too, I don't know,\nbut I did that, I took, I became a grownup and I took responsibility for maintaining\nmy life and my beliefs in a way that my mother would have wanted to and I, I, I took\non grownup responsibilities, indeed I had done that even during the war. When my\nmother got Typhus and sick and I took her out of that train from which we were\nrescued and carried her to the house and you know, we were called upon as children\nto be more grown up than children traditionally have been and I've maintained that in\nthe grown up years in a way that has made it more possible for me, let's say, to be an\nemployer than an employee. I, I have not been in the dependent stage, willingly\nand...",
        "Q: And that might include marriage as well?",
        "A: No, I will say that I always intended to marry when I was 18 and have children by\nthe time I was 20, that was my plan for my life and everything about me, mean to this\nday I'm a good cook and I'm a nester. I have had to reconfigure myself into not being\nthat, I've had to squeeze and pull and push myself into begin a career person, I was\nnot made to be that. I really should have been left to be where I was born, a Viennese\nperson, with music and dancing and husband and children, it's really what I started\nout to be and the rest of me, what I am now, I fashioned, I forced, I, it was not what I\nwas meant to be. I love opera, I subscribe, both to the city opera and to the\nmetropolitan, go a lot, I try to go to the theater. I have still friends from my early\nyears here in this country and my, from my school friends, I still maintain them and\nin general, I'm pretty content with my life. I have a nice apartment. And the man\nwith whom I had my long relationship has died and, but, I know, I suppose most\npeople have gaps in their lives, certainly my great regret is not having children, but\ngiven that as a given, then for the rest of it, I don't have too many complaints, I have\nhad cancer 14 years ago, I survived breast cancer. I had a year of chemotherapy, it\nhad spread, I'm very fortunate to have survived another, another thing besides my\nearly childhood events. I consider these years that I've had since the cancer a gift. If\nI were to die tomorrow, I would feel no anger, because I think my time was, if it was\nnot up when I was a child, in those conditions, it was up when I had cancer in the end\nof my 40's. I am 61, I think the years since my cancer are an additional boon, bonus\nand, and I really enjoy most of my life. And as long as those whom I care and love,\ncare about and love, are well, you know and as long as I am able to support myself\nand if I don't become destitute or dependent, in mentally or physically, I will go on\nbeing grateful to God for my continued existence. At the moment, my Uncle\nBenjamin died in 1957 of a heart attack, 1957 of a heart attack, yeah. He was 56\nyears old when he died. And we, by that time of course we were working and my,\nhis wife, my Lillian, Leah, my aunt Leah, she is today 85 years old, she still lives in\nKew Gardens, I spend the weekends with her, usually, in the house in Kew Gardens\nand I'm here in my apartment mostly, during the week and she's okay, she's doing\nwell mentally and physically, mostly. And her daughters, Diana, who is a painter,\nhas a studio and lives in Soho, here in New York and the other daughter, who was\ntwo when I came to this country, Vivian, has great interest in Tibetan Buddhism and\nhas spent a lot of time, both in Nepal in the east and in France and is very much\ninvolved with that and Freddy and Rachel and the girls are fine and getting married\nand the baby's expected this year and so, at the moment, I, I really count my blessings\nand I will continue to do that, every day that is given to us without major problem.",

        "Answer: Well, I'm Dorian Kurz and I came to this country in 1946, after the war,\nwith my brother, we were orphaned during the war and we were brought over here to\nAmerica by family that was living here and the first part of my history was recorded\nby the Holocaust Museum a few years ago.",
        "A: My brother's name is Alfred Kurz and we call him Freddy and I will probably be\ncalling him that in the course of this interview. And he lives in New Jersey.",
        "A: Let's see, I can't answer that specifically. I'm going to drop back from that a little\nbit. At the end of the war, we were liberated from a train that took us out of Bergen-\nBelsen and the aim of the Nazis was to destroy the train, but we were liberated before\nthat could happen, by the Russians. And that happened in a town which later on was\nin East Germany. It was in the spring, in April and eventually, it took three months\nfor the Red Cross to bring us back to Amsterdam, along with the other survivors. My\nmother was still alive and in the course of our train ride, she got typhus, which I had\nhad before that. And she was not well, even before the typhus. She survived the\ncrisis of the typhus in that little town in East Germany and when she was up and\nabout again, the Red Cross made contact with us and brought us through\nLypeseig(ph), which city still exists, back eventually into Holland. Now, a couple of\nrecollections of that time stick out very sharply. In Lypeseig(ph) my, there was a, we\nstayed in an armory of some sort, or a compound that had an armory and outside of\nthat armory, there was a machine, like a clothes wringer in appearance, except there\nwere knives in the middle. You turned some wheel, some lever and there were\nknives inside. And Freddy, my brother, who always had had investigative leanings,\nstuck his finger in there and turned the, turned the lever and cut off the tops of his\nfingers. I remember that because it was a lot of blood and a lot of hoopla and my\nmother very upset and very aggravated and they got him bandaged up and he has\nlittle bumps on three of his fingers, to the, at the top of his finger cause he cut off the\ntop of his fingers, so certainly do remember that. I remember waiting along the way\nsomewhere, in , with lots of other people, waiting for truck transport to move us from\none place to another. I had found in that little town where we were liberated, a doll\nsomebody had left behind. And for that doll, which was really my first toy in a very\nlong time and I was nine, I made little clothing out of little pieces of material and I\nmade a little cradle out of shoe box type of things and I was very attached to that little\ndoll. I put it down somewhere in the midst of that great mass of people waiting to be\ntransported and somebody took it and I cried and cried. It was a great blow.\nEventually we got back into Amsterdam, into a large barracks, I don't know where it\nwas, but you know, it's a child's recollection and I remember being in that large place\nlike, sort of like the barracks we'd had in the camps, but large and lying down and\ntaking a nap and when I woke up, at the foot of my bunk, was my oldest girlfriend,\nNomi(ph) Moskovitz(ph), with whom I grown up and whom I had not seen during\nthe intervening years. And she also, with her family, was in that displaces persons\nfacility and my mother had found her. So, a couple of those things that really stand\nup very sharply. Eventually we were out of those barracks and into our old\napartment.",
        "A: I can tell you what, what happened with Nomi(ph), I mean that's fine. I didn't, I\nsaw Nomi(ph) for a few times in the following year. She and her family also moved\nback to Amsterdam. She had two brothers, one brother and at the time before the war\nand after the war she had some more siblings, her parents had some more children\nand it was quite remarkable because her father was sent to a separate place, separate\nconcentration camp from Nomi(ph) and her mother and miraculously that family\nsurvived and was reunited after the war. I will come back, I will tell you more about\nNomi(ph) in a while. She remained in Amsterdam, eventually she was married and\nshe moved to Israel and the last time I saw Nomi(ph) was in March of 1946 and then\ndid not see her again until 1959, which was my first trip to Israel and I had that trip,\non that trip I started out going to Europe first and went through Holland and saw her\nparents and they gave me her address in Israel and I am a blonde and blue eyed and\nNomi(ph) has a dark complexion, very dark eyes and black hair and we have, we\nwere friends from the time we were in nursery school, four and I always felt, I guess\nbecause it was in Holland and I was blonde and blue eyed, that I was ordinary and\nlooked like everyone else and that she was beautiful because she was so different\nlooking, so dark and she had long black hair and I was envious of her. In 1959 when\nI had not seen her for 13 years and in that time we had both gone from being girls to\nbeing women. She had been married, I was not and I visited her in Israel, there, I got\nsuch a shock because there was this big, fat woman, very large and it was Nomi(ph)\nand we were unable to communicate on any level, almost entirely, there was some\ninanities just that went, were between us and totally, you know, but we had been sort\nof like sisters, we slept in each others house __, it was exactly like two people\nfrom other planets and I have not been in touch with her since, so that's about it. I\nwill, I will go back now to my time in, in Amsterdam. So eventually, and I don't\nknow how my mother accomplished that, we got back our apartment. At the time we\nwere arrested in the middle of the night and we moved, the apartment was taken from\nus and our furniture was done away with and I suppose there must have been some\nresettlement commission and my mother got back our apartment and we went back\ninto it, but she, my mother was really quite sick at that time already and we lived in\nthat apartment a very short time and my mother was hospitalized and...",
        "A: None of the furniture was there, no, not at all. The furniture my parents had had\nwas made in Vienna, custom made to order for my parents by a well known architect\nand none of that was there. But, my, there was some simple furniture that my mother\nhad. We were not there very long before it was impossible for my mother to continue\nas she was and she was moved to the hospital, the apartment was still ours and she\nunderwent some surgery and Freddy and I went to live with friends of my parents, I\nwill allude briefly, I mentioned those people when I made the visual tape because\nthose were the people who were in our apartment the night the Gestapo came. Those\nwere, that was the family that my mother was hiding and they had resettled after the\nwar, they were all hidden, the members of that family whose name was Roos, R-o-o-\ns. They had been in, separately under hadoken(ph) and they were reassembled after\nthe war and they were living in a little town called Rainin(ph) in Holland, about an\nhour and a half outside of Amsterdam and they lived in a house on a dike, it was a\nsmall farming town and Freddy and I went to live with them while my mother was\nnot well. Eventually my mother was brought back to the apartment and she did\nlinger until March of 1946, when she died. So for those nine months that she was ill,\nwe were most of time living with the family Roos in Rainin(ph) on the dike and I\ntherefore am not really, I, there's not a whole lot I can say about Amsterdam and what\nhappened to it. The only times we were brought in was to visit my mother and that\nnot very often, once every couple of months, she...",
        "A: She was in Amsterdam and... [ringing phone]",
        "A: That, that answer is really on so many different levels. I would tell you from\ntoday's point of view, looking back as an adult person, that I'm not, I think I'm pretty\nmentally stable, fairly so, | mean no worse than most people, but I attribute that in\nvery large part to the, to two facts. The most important is that I have a brother. I\nthink I would not really have managed without, because he was my root. In general\nI, I think today that children can survive almost anything as long as they are confident\nin the care and love of a parent. And although, I mean obviously my history, my\nchildhood was not a very good childhood, looked at it from that point of view. Still,\nif I compare myself to the children I read about in the paper who suffer abuse at the\nhands of their parents, I had a rosy childhood in comparison. Because even looking\nback from here, surely there were moments of fear and lots of horrible things that I, I\nlooked at, but I never doubted my survival and I always felt secure when my mommy\nwas there and I was fortunate in that, that mother was not an hysterical sort. She\nmade it, 1t seem okay and I came through the war never doubting that we'd come\nthrough, in fact I remember lots of talk about, you know, with my mother about after\nthe war, when my father, whom we called Poppy, would be back and we never\ndoubted that. And after the war, directly after the war, while my mother was still\nalive, we talked a great deal about when she would get better and in that year it\ncertainly began to dawn on me that she was not getting better, but it was in\nconceivable because that was grounded in my security. Now we were very lucky\nbecause we knew, Freddy and I, from a very early age on, that we had lots of family\nelsewhere, in America and my mother drilled us consistently in addresses, in\nPalestine, where her brother lived and in America, where my father's family was and\nso I guess she figured if she wasn't going to make it through, she wanted us to have a\nplace that we would go to. It was a very close family and directly after the war, of\ncourse contact was made with them again and in fact, one of my father's brothers\ncame to Amsterdam not long after the war and he got, he got a passport, he got a visa\nand he was able to come and to arrange for my mother's care and also to start to\narrange for our coming to America and so by the time I was told that my mother had\nnot long to live and by the time I, we internalized that, we knew that we were not\ngoing to be in an orphanage, for example, we knew that we were going to America\nand so we were looking forward to that. So the fact that we survived emotionally,\nfairly, fairly emotionally stable, both of us, certainly is due to the type of person my\nmother was, the fact that we had a loving relationship and the fact that we were\nconfident in that close family that we had overseas. Now, for me, I think the\nimportance of my brother really happens after that, it's after we come here. Once,\nonce my mother died and my own roots were gone, in that sense, you know my, my\nparents were gone and, and Holland was gone, even though I was here with loving\naunt and uncle, still, it and, and a loving aunt and uncle who had been very close to\nmy parents so, my parents were talked about, it wasn't like, you know, I was with\nstrange people who had no idea about my background, but still it was the fact that I\nhad a brother that gave me a feeling of belonging. With my own history, belonging\nto something that had started when I started, when I was born. And that has\nincreased 1n importance, or that did increase in importance to me, in the years that we\nwere growing up in America. I say that despite the fact that we entered a wonderful\nhome and you know, that we were cared for and loved, but, but children don't give up\nwhat's theirs easily and my background was mine. And my brother was the only one\nwho had really shared it and who, you know, we'd had the same experiences, we had\nseen the same things, the bad stuff and we were very close. Now, besides that, I was\nthe older of the two of us by 16 months and my mother would always, you know,\nblame me when we had fights, cause I was the older one, I should know better and\nshe had always made me be responsible when, when we were, for some reason, you\nknow, it was up to me, so when she died, I felt definitely a responsibility for him and\nfor us as a brother-sister team and for values such as religious observance, that we\nhad learned there, I mean I jealously guarded those parts of our background that I\nthought were important for us and that would have been important for my parents.\nAnd I spun them into a little private thing between us. And because we were very\nclose in age, we really were close personally as well, we related well. To this day\nthere's certainly no one in the world with whom I fight as much as I do with him.\nWe, we can barely be in each other's company for 10 minutes without one of us\nscreaming at the other. We certainly don't have the same points of view and we see\nlife differently and he's a man, I'm a woman, so that already is different and, but\nunderlying it, there is a very deep love and respect that goes both ways. For my 60th\nbirthday my brother gave me a surprise party 1n a restaurant here in New York and he\nmade a speech, I, he never, he never says anything nice, he never gives a compliment\nto anyone's face, he'll never say you look nice, or that's great, what you did, never.\nBut that man got up there and made a speech about me which was unbelievable. He's\na kind, he's a more closed person than I am and that was one of the few times in his\nlife ever, that the window was opened. And I didn't, I never needed those words, you\nknow, to kind of let me know that it is a two way street because he's done much more\nme in my life. We've tried to do for each other. But he's always been there for me\nand I know and I've said it many times, that if God forbid I had lost him, I, I wouldn't\nhave made it, I am sure of that.",
        "A: I'm sorry, I don't know which time you mean now?",
        "A: See again, this is not an easy answer. My mother was a very observant women in\nterms of the practice of Judaism, but she was never dogmatic. And she was very\nclever about the way she, she tried to instill that into Freddy and me. I never\nremember her saying you cannot do this on, on, on Shabbas(ph) or you can't eat this\nand that together, I never remember her saying that, but I read from a very early age\nand one day, for example, I found, I loved books, and I found a book lying around, I\nlooked at 1t and there were pictures in it and, and I tried to read it but some of the\nwords were too big and I asked about it and she said, \"Oh, well, if you want me to, I'll\nread you story.\" And you know, that was a book of bible stories. Well she did\neverything in that way, she tried to make things likable and fun, so whatever practice\nwe did, it was never onerous in any way, it was always in a good context, so I can't\neven tell you that I knew about the laws of Kashrut or the laws of, of Saturday as\nsuch, I don't know that I could have verbalized them, but I knew what we did and\ndidn't do with my mother and tried to continue to do that. Well, we grew up in, after\nthe war, first in the house of those people in, in Rainin(ph) and they were also\nobservant to a degree, but I know there was no kosher food to be had, or kosher meat\nto be had in Holland at that time, especially where we were. I cannot imagine that the\nfood that we ate after the war was, was kosher, but I don't remember being in agony\nor anything of the sort. So I know there was no meat served at the table with butter\nor milk, for example, but I don't remember ever questioning like where did, there\nwasn't that much meat, but I don't remember questioning where the meat came from,\nwe were just happy to have any sort of food. And so the people with whom we\nstayed certainly were not against observing because they had come from an observant\nbackground as well. And when I came to America, my aunt and uncle, my uncle was\nmy father's brother and my aunt, the lady who we grew up with, Lillian, she came\nfrom a very observant house, probably more so than the house that my parents had\ngrown up in and so there was no problem about observance. In the interim, between\nthe time we left Holland and the time we came to America, well, okay, I'll talk about\nthat for a little bit. I already mentioned that one of my father's brothers came over to\nHolland, and that was my Uncle Charlie and my father's, my father and his brother\nhad world wide optical business before the war and we had an office in Amsterdam\nand so he came over both to take, look after my mother and Freddy and me and also I\nthink, to see what was left from a business point of view. And he spent many, several\nmonths actually, in Holland. He was there when my mother died. And he came to\nvisit us, also stay with us in Rainin(ph), in that little town where we were, just a quick\nlittle aside there, I mean, this little town in Holland was not up to the minute in\ntechnology and the house we had really, literally was on a dike. A dike, a dike 1s\nreally a road, it's like the river ran below and then on the, as you know Holland is\nvery flat, so from the river to the land next to the river is just a flat continuation and\nthen a dike was built up high, like a wall and at the top of the wall they paved it and\nthat was a road. And then on the other side of the road there were houses, so that's\nwhere we lived. And, but there was no central heating for example and there was a\nbig pot-bellied stove in the living room, one of those black things and we fed it coal\nand wood and it heated up the living room, but the bedrooms, which were up on the\nsecond floor, didn't have any heat and anyone who's ever been in the low countries or\nin Germany in the wintertime, you know that things are very cold there, but this is\nwhat we were used to and it certainly didn't bother us, but when my Uncle Charlie\ncame to stay with us, see, that was in the middle of the winter and he, there was, it\nwas a little house and the family Roos had two boys and there was Freddy and me\nand so there were only a certain number of bedrooms and so my Uncle Charlie\nshared our bed, in a big large bed and I remember trying to sleep all night and\ncouldn't because my poor Uncle Charlie was just trying to hold onto us for warmth,\nhe was literally all night, you could hear his teeth rattling and he was physically\nshaking. And so, anyway, but he was there when my mother died and then it was\nvery hard to get, get visas to move people, including children from western Europe to\nAmerica, because everybody was trying to come to America. And my uncle with\nwhom I was going to live when I came to America, my Uncle Benjamin, who was\nanother brother of my father, in order to get Freddy and me to have a visa to come to\nAmerica, went to Washington to see President Truman and he got for us a special\npermit, read into the Congress of the United States, to give us priority to come in,\nwhich is how we managed to get in by the following August, August of '46 and while\nmy Uncle Benjamin was trying for that and my Uncle Charlie was in Europe, it was\narranged that after my mother died, that Freddy and I, in order to get a visa, should\nbe, should go to Sweden to establish residency there and from there, once we had our\nvisa, to come to the United States and eventually that is what happened. We left, we\nleft...",
        "A: I think the American consulate was open in Sweden, but the American consulate\nwas not yet open in Amsterdam and maybe because Sweden was a neutral country, I,\nI, I don't know the politics of the thing, but apparently something like that. It was\npossible to get the visa from Sweden and we got a priority because we were orphaned\nand because my Uncle Benjamin never took no for an answer on anything and just\nwent straight to the head man. He got to the outer office of President Truman and got\nto his aide and arranged for that. So my mother died in March and March of '46 and\nFreddy and I were brought to Amsterdam for the funeral and after the funeral they\ntook me to see Nomi(ph), to say good-bye to her because we knew we were going to\ngo to America and then shortly thereafter we flew to Sweden and we were taken to\nSweden by our Uncle Roos, the man whom we had been living with, he was not\nreally an uncle, he was just friends, but we called him, his name was Abraham,\nAb(ph) Roos, so he flew with us to, to Sweden, where my Uncle Charlie was and so\nwe hooked up with my Uncle Charlie there. That plane trip, going to Sweden, I\nremember very vividly because I...",
        "A: It was my first plane trip, but I was, I had a terrible case of car sickness as a child,\nI, I couldn't even get into a car without throwing up. And this was a fairly small\nplane, not a very nice day and, and, and it put me off flying for decades. That was a\nthree hour trip. All I remember is that that plane kept going up and falling down,\ngoing up and falling down. Must have hit, you know, it was a prop plane, it flew\nunder the clouds, it hit all those air pockets and went down and even though we had\nnot seen an orange in our recollection, Freddy and I, they gave out oranges on that\nplane, I filled up every little bag, just threw up that entire trip. Sat next to the man\nwho was taking us, you know, Mr. Roos and Freddy was sitting in a jump seat and at\nsome point they found Freddy trying to open up the door next to him, I remember\nthat and they rushed, they rushed him away from that little, 1t was like a parachute\nseat they had him sitting in and he was fooling around with the door. We got to\nStockholm at the end of the day, stayed in a hotel which we called the\nconteenantalb(ph), this is Hotel Continental, across from the railroad station, we got\nthere late at night and my Uncle Charlie was there and we, we, we both remember\nthis first meal that we had there because Holland was still pretty bare after the war,\nyou certainly couldn't get a whole lot of exotic food products and for us exotic was\npretty well everything, like oranges, you know, were very exotic. And so eggs were\nhard to come by and so on, so we got in there pretty late at night, I guess about 10\no'clock we, we were taken into the dining room to have a meal because we hadn't\neaten very much and so Freddy immediately ordered to eggs and so we ate supper\nand then went to bed, where Freddy threw up all night. I mean, they'd said it was\nbecause he ate too much rich food after not having had rich food for a long time, but I\ndon't know. Anyway he was sick all night. Two men, my Uncle Charlie and Ab(ph)\nRoos, trying to comfort a little boy who was throwing up all night and I'm sure they\nwere wishing that there was some woman with them who knew what to do better. I\nstayed in Stockholm for awhile. We lived with a family who's last name escapes me\nfor a couple of weeks and then my uncle, my, Ab(ph) Roos went back to Holland and\nmy Uncle Charlie arranged for Freddy and me to be moved to a boarding school for\nthe summer because he had to go back to America, my Uncle Charlie and somebody\nhad to look after us, so they put us into some boarding school in the country, in the\nwoods outside of Stockholm and we spent the summer there. The caretaker, of\ncourse all the boys were gone from that boarding school, the caretaking family was\npaid to look after us and by some stroke of fortune, they spoke German and of course\nmy, I had, I mean my parents spoke German, that was there native language so that\nwas my first language and Dutch was my second language. And so they had a\ndaughter my age, so that summer was spent, her name was Marisha(ph), Mousey and\nso that summer was spent in, in the company of that little girl. Oh, lots of things\nabout that summer, first of all my Uncle Charlie...",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: I was speaking about the things in Stockholm. Most noteworthy was, still while\nboth men were with us, my Uncle Charlie and Ab(ph) Roos, they, we all went\nwalking, I, I just remember rivers and bridges in the city of Stockholm and sunshine\nand most of all what I remember, I, what I, I guess I consider today to be\nsupermarket, there was stores that just had racks and racks of food, fruit and food,\nwhich just boggled our minds. And I must say that even today when I think about tt,\nI'm amazed at that, that in, in Europe after the war, there were countries that were\nbare of all those things and countries that just, just had it up the kazoo. I mean, we\njust hadn't seen fruit for, all over, the stores, by, by the late spring and summer of\n1946 in Sweden, perhaps they'd always had it, I don't know, but they were just full of\nit and we, we couldn't imagine that. It was an upbeat time for us, even though we\nspoke a lot about my mother and the fact that she'd died and that made us sad, but we\nwere, Freddy and I, looking forward a lot to America. And so then they moved us to\nthat boarding school. Somewhere in the course of that summer I got my first taste of\nbubble gum, tried to learn how to blow bubbles. It must have been a pretty austere\nboarding school because the shock was the first morning when we got up, we went to\nbreakfast and they served us, what seemed to me to be sour milk and what I now\nknow to be rye crisps and I couldn't eat it. By the end of the summer I liked it quite a\nlot, but it's, I, I've, I've talked to people since and that was a fairly standard Swedish\nbreakfast, which is yogurt and rye crisp but I considered it sour milk and crackers, I\nthought it was awful.",
        "A: That was in the boarding school, her family were caretakers there. Maybe while\nall the teachers and the children were gone, they were caretakers and we spent a lot of\ntime playing make believe. My Uncle Charlie had taken us on a shopping binge and\nI had noticed in a store, nightgowns, long nightgowns and you know I was 10 years\nold and they were long nightgowns with pretty little puffy sleeves and I made him\nbuy me a pink and a blue and they became princess gowns, I wore one and Mousey\nwore the other and we made Freddy be the prince. Spent a lot of time running\nthrough the woods, make believe like that. Anyway, in the course of that summer,\nour visa came through and the, Mousey's mother, the lady who spoke German and\nwith whom we were able to communicate to, brought us to Gurtaberg(ph), from\nwhere the ship we were to sail on, sailed. And the ship was the Grippsholm(ph),\nGrippsholm(ph) and so Freddy and I set sail. It was a two week trip from Sweden to\nAmerica, I don't know why is should have taken that long. We were put into separate\nstate rooms, I shared mine with three women, two upper bunks, two lower bunks and\nFreddy shared his with three men on a different deck. And that made me very\nanxious. The lady who took us to the ship had arranged for a single maiden lady to\neat her meals with us. Somewhere around the third day out there was a drill, you\nknow, in case something happened to the ship, but everybody forgot to tell me it was\na drill and so in the middle of the sirens and the whistles blowing, we were told to get\non deck and, and we were assigned to lifeboats and to my horror, we were assigned\nto different lifeboats. And I wouldn't let go of him, I was just screaming and crying.\nNobody told me that the ship wasn't going down. It was only afterwards that I\nlearned that. I, L..",
        "A: I don't remember. Somewhere I found out it wasn't for real, I guess. But I just\nremember screaming and crying a lot. I contracted a skin condition which I, _,\nwe knew if was called impetigo, it's very painful and extremely contagious and the\nfear was that I would not be allowed into America, because they, they weren't\nallowing anything contagious in. Penicillin had come on the scene not long before\nand the ship's doctor decided to give me a regimen of penicillin every three hours,\nmorning and night, so four times a day and four times at night, they would come to\nmy bunk in the ship and give me shot in my rear end. It didn't help. By the time we\ncame to America, I was still full of impetigo and eventually, unfortunately gave it to\nthe whole family in America, including the two year old child, but in order to hide the\ncondition, I was put into gloves. I mean the lady who was eating meals with us and\nwho looked after to make sure that we didn't fall off the ship I guess, took care to put\nme into a pair of gloves and when we arrived in America, I guess that we, this was\nnow August fifth, 1946. We were still among the first wave of orphaned children\nthat were allowed in after the war and I guess the, the newspapers got lists of\ncelebrities that were expected on these various ships and then would go to meet the\nship and try to get a story and so at some point that, first of all, the morning of our\narrival, lots of hoopla, everybody was saying, oh, you've got to look, there is Long\nIsland, so some people were saying they were going to live on that long island, cause\nyou could see the land mass sticking out and Freddy and I, we said, no, no, we, we're\nnot going to live on Long Island, we're living at 503 Fifth Avenue, which was the\naddress my mother had hammered into our heads, cause that was where the optical\noffice was, Kurz Optical was there, so we told everybody we were going to be living\nat 503 Fifth Avenue. Some man came up, who turned out to be a reporter and who\nwanted to take our pictures, so he cast about for an interesting shot and found the\nlifeboy, the round lifeboy that says Grippesholm(ph) on it and posed Freddy and me\nwith our faces through it and took pictures which later appeared in the New York\nTimes and which I have copies. And me wearing one glove on the impetigo hand,\nyes. My hair, which was still very short because of the lice and all, it hadn't grown\nback completely yet. I was very small, I, you know, the difference in heights, Freddy\nand me and what we were and where we got to be shortly afterward is quite dramatic\nas we, we grew a lot. When my Uncle Benjamin was allowed on board, which was\npretty early on because we were alone, two children alone, traveling, he found us\nperched on top of the railing of the ship. I mean that reporter has, had sat us the top\nof the railing of the ship, without any regard for our safety and Uncle Benjamin came\nup, gave that man a real piece of his mind. So lots of hoopla, we had a suitcase, we\ncame down off the gangplank, through that big pier, where my, two of my aunts were\nwaiting for me.",
        "A: No, it was no more Ellis Island, straight into the docks in New York?",
        "A: No, I think it was not, I think it was in the 20's or the teens, it was on one of the\nlower slips, one of the lower berths. And my father's sister, my Aunt Lola was there\nto meet us and as well as Charlie's wife Karola(ph), the three had come to meet us on\nthe ship and vividly I remember that as soon as I left that large pier, that building, my\nfirst step to the outside, I bumped into somebody who cursed me out very roundly. I\nmust have stepped on her toe or something, but. And so then we took a taxi to\nBrighton(ph) Beach, Brooklyn, where my Uncle Benjamin and my Aunt Lillian,\nwhom we call Aunt Leah, where they lived, in Brighton(ph) Beach, they lived in a\ntwo room apartment, living room and a bedroom. They had two children, Diana,\nwho's my age and Vivian who was two. And Diana was in camp, this was August\nthe fifth, she was in camp for the summer and Vivian was home, she was a little girl.",
        "A: I had not met my Uncle Benjamin, that 1s to say, now within my recollection,\nactually they had met me, but I was very small, then by the time they went to\nAmerica, I was, last time I saw them I was two and a half or something, so they knew\nme, but I didn't know them. So this was, my Uncle Benjamin had not been to\nEurope, it was my Uncle Charlie who came to Europe. My Uncle Benjamin and my\nAunt Leah, whom I lived with, who I was to live with, I had not met them. So this\nwas my first meeting with them.",
        "A: Very much so, very much so. And then you know how it is when you, when you\nenter a new family, there are, if children are especially children who are the same age\nand Diana and I are three months apart, there are lots of adjustments and\naccommodations that children have to make and there are, there is lots of power play\nthat goes on and where before Diana was queen in her own castle, except for a two\nyear old sister and you know, there were eight years between her and her sister, she\ncame back from camp to find two siblings of the same age and it was a very rough\nadjustment and there was a lot of politicking among the three of us as alliances got\npushed and pulled. And so certainly my, my feeling of needing my brother were, or\nusing him in alliances certainly, that was intensified.",
        "A: Well, yes, that, lots of things to be said about that. To our great good fortune, my\nAunt Leah had spent some years of her young womanhood in Holland, so she spoke\nDutch. I spoke German pretty fluently and indeed still do, it's a children's German. If\nyou want to engage me in a conversation about genetics, I won't do so well, but if you\nwant to talk about the ordinary, every day things, I'm pretty fluent. You know, what\nchildren tend to talk about I can do pretty well and so I didn't have a problem\ncommunicating because both Benjamin and Leah spoke German, Leah spoke Dutch.\nAnd I want to tell you that a child left to his or her own devices picks up a language\nvery quickly. I arrived here on August the fifth, I went to school at the beginning of\nSeptember and by that time I spoke English. And it's true, I mean, they got a lady to\ncome in and teach us something, but that didn't do a whole lot, the truth is...",
        "A: No. The truth is, a child that goes, it's one of the reasons I feel so very strongly\nagainst what is happening in the school system to allow children to stay in their\nnative language. A child left to his own devices picks up a language, a young child,\nvery quickly. English was my third language. I had started school in Brighton(ph)\nBeach, Brooklyn, at PS 225, with Mrs. Field, in class 5A. I will say that in the course\nof that first term, I, I got to speak English fluently. I didn't get to write it perfectly\nwell, in fact I have compositions from that first half year and the English 1s funny,\ncause I write what I hear. All of a sudden I wrote as A-I-f-e-r-s-u-d-d-e-n, all of a\nsudden. And lots of my compositions which were kept from that time are funny\nbecause you can see that I spoke it all right, I just didn't know what I was saying and\nso I wrote it. By the way, Dutch 1s a very exact language, you write exactly what you\nhear, so I tried doing that in English and of course that, it's amusing to read now. But\nanyway by the time it became apparent it was impossible in two rooms for six people\nto live, we moved to Kew Gardens and into a little house and then the second half of\nmy fifth grade I had in, I started Kew Gardens in a new school.",
        "A: In 5A. I was just going to say something about that, I, before we were deported\nto, to concentration camps, I had only had the first grade. And that was it. I think I\nhad a couple of weeks of the second grade and then after the war, after we came back\nin Rainin(ph), I, they, they kind of, I mean lots of children had, had not had proper\nschooling and I kind of had the third grade, sort of. And then we left that in the\nmiddle, see and then we came to America and in Sweden I didn't go to school of\ncourse and then, it was only over the summer, was only a few months. And then I\ncame here and they tested me and I went into the fifth grade, which was the proper\ngrade for a 10 year old to go into. And of course, education in Europe is a little\ndifferent. In first grade we had learned addition, subtraction, multiplication and\ndivision and so by the time after the war, when I was trying to play catch up in the\nthird grade, other children also did that. When I came to America, children in the\nfifth grade were about to learn long division, which I knew how to do, so they put me\ninto the fifth grade and the truth is I learned English very quickly. I mean the part of\nthe curriculum that I was backwards on was history because in America they only\nlearn history of the United States in the early grades and I knew nothing. Geography\nof the United States, course I didn't know anything about that and literature because I\nhad not read children's books, but I was a voracious reader and loved reading. So,\nwhat I'm, what I'm ending up with here, so when we moved to Kew Gardens and we\nwere registered in PS 99, I vividly remember that first morning after the, my Aunt\nLeah took us in and registered us and the principal called for some young girl who\nbrought us to our classrooms. I was brought into my 5B classroom feeling very self-\nconscious, school was more formal in those days, everybody was sitting at their seat\nwith their hands clasped and the little girl brought me in to the class and my teacher\nturned to the class and said, \"Now this 1s a little orphan girl from Europe. She doesn't\nspeak any English and I want you all to be very nice to her.\" And of course I spoke\nEnglish quite as well as anyone else, possibly with a little bit of an accent, but I had a\ndilemma because [| didn't know whether to make her into a liar or whether I should\njust keep my mouth shut and not let her know that I spoke pretty fluently.",
        "A: No, she was not Jewish, but I, but I mean she, she didn't mean this badly, she\nreally thought that I was not able to converse and she was going to try to make my\ntransition easier, but of course I spoke it fluently and I had a problem afterwards with\nhow to, how to handle that. So I went to school sketchily in my early years but it\ndidn't do me any harm and I graduated valedictorian in the eight grade.",
        "A: I, I don't think the students certainly did. At some point my teacher did, she, my\nteacher also was the quote, sewing teacher for the school and so one afternoon when\nwe had sewing, she got me aside and had me tell her the story and so I know she was\ncurious and she had me talk about it. But listen, it isn't just that those children didn't\nknow about it, people didn't talk about it here, nobody talked about it.",
        "A: In my family, my parents were part of the conversation because my father was my\nUncle Benjamin's brother and my mother and my Aunt Leah had been best friends in\nthe time they were young wives and they'd had their children together and spent a lot\nof time in each other's company, so the conversation was much about the times gone\nby. But not, they did not try to draw me out on the experiences during the war. Once\nin awhile they got into the conversation or I would mention something, but they\ndidn't try to make me talk about it. And certainly, other people, outsiders of the\nfamily, this was not a subject of conversation, first of all, many Jewish people who\nwe knew had similar histories. Everybody, I guess, had lost people. It was a subject\nvery painful for a lot of people, it was raw, it was part of their own lives, or else they\nhad lost people to these kind of things and there was I think also a feeling that they've\nbeen through enough, why should we make them talk about it. It's only really in the\n1980's that this became a subject for general conversation, it was not done. And there\nwas also a feeling, certainly in the 50's, 40's and 50's that one tried to shield children\nfrom hearing bad things, 1t wasn't like now when violence is an every day thing on\nthe TV. It would not, you, one would not have put a child in the position of telling\nother children about these experiences, it would have been deemed not proper.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I would venture...",
        "A: I would venture to say that my school in Kew Gardens was 80 percent Jewish.\nMaybe not 80 perhaps in those years it was 60 percent Jewish. We certainly\nwouldn't, my aunt and uncle would not have moved into a community that did not\nhave synagogues and you know and other Jewish children.",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. I, we were affiliated, I went to the Hebrew school after\nschool, five, four days a week. Went to the synagogue on Saturday morning, did that\neven when no one else went. Both Freddy and I did that. And Freddy was Bar\nMitzvahed at there and I became active when I was old enough to do that, _ being\na leader in the youth center and you know, it was very much a focal point of my\nexistence. I retained the observance as I thought my mother would have wanted me\nto and Freddy was a little bit more lax about that as boys are wont to do and that\ncaused me some aggravation and it was important enough for me so that when I went\nto high school, Forest Hills High School, the social life revolved around sororities,\nwhich meant Friday nights. I did not join a sorority and I was pretty well an outsider,\nI was an oddball and I had ambitions for the stage and joined play production and\neventually did get a role or two and walked from my house in Kew Gardens to those\nperformances in Forest Hills High School on Friday night and Saturday and did that\nwith a lot of trepidation. And religion has remained to this day, certainly an\nimportant thing, important core in my life.",
        "A: I pretty quickly, I pretty quickly internalized some American things that made me\nfeel good about America. For one thing, I want to remind you, that in the 1940's and\n'50's, children entered school in the morning, stood up and pledged allegiance to the\nflag every day and stood up when the flag came, when you heard the Star Spangled\nBanner and those of us, not just those of us who were refugees and came here, but\npeople of that era, to this day, are more patriotic, if such a thing 1s possible to say,\nthan young people who are growing up today. We tend to honor the flag and all that.\nIn addition to that, my Uncle Benjamin thought of America as the land of savior, you\nknow, they were, they were also refugees as was all my family, I mean we were all,\nmy whole family, there was nobody really in America, everybody was in Europe.\nAnd I have correspondence from my parents to their family and friend, hundreds of\nletters that got saved and sent and kept with my mother's artifacts, with non-Jews\nduring the war and I, I have possession of those. And I've spent really hours looking\nat those and what emerges from them is this tremendous feeling of people that are\nbound up with hundreds, a far flung family, you married and you then acquired your\nspouse\ns family as well and your spouse's spouse's. They drew in their family and then you\nbecame family with the spouse's spouse's spouse's. And so I have letters like that, the\nmiddle of a tremendous network, it was a very close merging of family and friends, I\nmean it was one thing. And so when all of that got stopped one day by that maniac in\nGermany and everybody tried to get out, those who made it and who made it here\nand who worked hard and reestablished themselves, my Uncle Benjamin came here\nwith a few dollars in his hands one day, got on the subway from Brooklyn, where he\nwas dropped off after he arrived here, took the subway, which, I mean he didn't even\nknow his way, had heard about 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue, got instruction how to\ngo there, found an office on the fifth floor walkup and opened his office and he and\nhe became a successful optical wholesaler again, you know. He considered America\nas the golden land, the land that had saved him. He considered President Truman\nsomewhere up there with the deities. And there was a lot of talk about that, I mean\nwe respected America as I did as a land that had given us, you know, a chance to\ncome and to, to work and so we were very patriotic. I remind you also that not until\n20 years later was there any criticism above the president at the time, President\nRoosevelt and the Congress for not, you know, opening up the door and saving\npeople, which of course in retrospect we all realize should have happened but at that\ntime, I mean we went, everyone, all the Jewish refugees and the non-Jewish refugees\nwho came to America after the war found this a land of opportunity and equality and\nyou know, place where you could start and didn't matter what you had been, if you\nwanted to become something you could and we were very patriotic about that and I\ninternalized that very fast. I became a citizen on my, at my own right, since I had no\nparents, so you know, I had to and I was, I was old enough so requirements for\ncitizenship for me were until I was 18 I was not a citizen so at the age of 18 I was\nsworn in, 1n Abbot's(ph) field, I went with Freddy.",
        "A: No, Freddy became a citizen in his own right when he became 18. The ceremony\nwas in Abbot's(ph) field, was crowded, crowded, it was a beautiful day, I was sworn\nin and somewhere, along with the other 20,000 people who were there, we all stood\nand we took the oath, I was very proud to do that and some reporter was roaming\naround saying, \"Anybody here have an interesting story?\" You know, but I wasn't\ngoing to push myself forward on that, but as he went past me, I said to him, \"Well, I\nwas interviewed when I came here.\" He said, \"Oh,\" and he, and he took my story, so\nI have an article about me on the day I came to the United States with picture and I\nhave an article about me on the day I became a citizen.",
        "A: No. I know it was in the spring and the sun was shining and it was Abbot's(ph)\nfield.",
        "A: Well, after high school, I went to college. For a lot of reasons I did not pursue\ngoing out of town. A lot of reasons and I applied to Queens College and I applied to\nBarnett(ph) here in New York, women's undergraduate part of Columbia University\nand I was accepted Barnard with a scholarship, a partial scholarship, Freddy was still\nin Kew Gardens, living there, his last year of high school and so I commuted. In\nthose years it was still possible to put yourself through college, a thing that is no\nlonger possible, but when I started Barnard it was 823 dollars a year. I had a 350\ndollar scholarship. I had received something called a general _ foundation\nscholarship when I graduated high school, which paid me 25 dollars a semester,\nwhich I used toward textbooks, in the plural, cause you could do that cause we went\nto use, to buy used textbooks, 1t was possible. I worked at the synagogue youth\ncenter and made money that way. I worked summers as drama counselor in camps,\nso that I got paid more than other counseloring jobs. And I took a job every single\nJune with Olsen's(ph) Temporary Service. And it was quite possible to, if you, if you\nhad your living taken care of and I was living in Kew Gardens and eating, for a\nyoung person to go to school and pay their tuition with the help of a scholarship, that\nwas quite possible. Course it would not have been possible if, if I could not have\nlived at home in, in Kew Gardens, but even the tuition, which is unthinkable today, I\nmean no young person can possibly do that, but that was possible so I went to\nBarnard and spent the four years there. Never felt myself to be very pretty...",
        "A: Certainly in high school I felt odd man out and my friends were oddballs, we, I\nwas not, I tried to belong to the in crowd, I, I never quite could. In Forest Hills High\nSchool they took, at the end of our freshman year, they, they culled out of the student\nbody of 800 I think approximately of my year, they took 36 of us whom they tested at\nthe end of the first year, based on our achievement of the first year and they put us\ntogether for all the math and science of the balance of the four years, they tried to\ngive us five years in four. And so I kind of traveled with the elite intellects of, of, of\nthe class, for those four years and I was always a studier, school didn't come easy, I, I\nalways had to work very hard, I spent a lot of hours studying, as opposed to my\nbrother. My brother used to come home and complain that every, he had too much\nwork, everything was too much work and then he'd sit down like for 15 or 20 minutes\nwith the pencil writing furiously and then one time I looked up and he was __ putting\non his sneakers and I said, \"Where are you going?\" And he said, \"I'm going to play\nbasketball in the schoolyard and I said, \"Well, you've just, you've just been\ncomplaining you have too much work , so what are you doing?\" He said, \"Well now\nI've made a schedule and what to do and I know when I'm studying for what, so now\nthis is the schedule for playing ball.\" See now, I never was able to do that, see I\nwould get nervous and bite my nails and work and study, so, there were some people\nin that group of thirty-something that they culled out, that really were extremely\ngifted in math and in science and I didn't have an easy time hanging on, but I did very\nwell in high school, I graduated the 10th, I think in, in, in the 800, I was number 10, I\nthink I had a 92.8 average or something like that, I was fine and so I had been pretty\nspoiled cause I'd done pretty well, all of my school years, I was, I was always an A\nstudent and in fact, I tell you what I remember, in the first grade, my mother made a\nbig fuss, because in Europe their marking system was to 10, I mean 100 was 10. I\nbrought back my report card in first grade, I had a 10 in everything and an eight in\npenmanship and she wouldn't let me forget that. It was only in later years that I\nfound a copy of my mother's report cards in elementary school, she was definitely a C\nstudent all the way, which I thought was quite extraordinary. But anyway, I was\nspoiled and I had, I had always had an easy time in school. I went into Barnard and I\nwas not happy. I was outclassed by a mile. Barnard had, certainly at that time, a\nlarge percentage of it's students had come from private schools. I was a product of\nthe public school system and most of it, Forest Hills High School, was definitely one\nof the top high schools in the city, but we had done things by rote. ______ you learn\nsomething, you memorized it, you took a test and you spewed it back out. I got to\ncollege, I had to write a term paper, I had never written a term paper in my life, I\ndidn't even know how to go about it. I mean, what we wrote were more like\ncompositions, but there were no term paper, a research paper? I hadn't the foggiest\nnotion. I had girls in the class who had been doing independent research at Barnard\nyou know, people who really knew what they were doing and I, I was under pressure\nto maintain my scholarship and I hadn't yet learned how to sift out the important stuff\nfrom the unimportant, so I tried very hard to keep up on all of it and you couldn't. So,\nI had no time while I was in college to learn anything. I, I just spend my time doing,\nbut not learning and I regret that a lot. I don't have good recollections of those four\nyears, they were very tense all the time. When I was growing up and I knew I\ncouldn't be an actress cause it would not work well with my, with my religious\ninclinations not to work on Saturday, I probably wouldn't have made a go of it\nanyway, but anyway, I, I, I gave up my pretensions for that, I decided to be a\nschoolteacher, I had worked with children all of my life when I could have been\nconsidered not a child. I'd done the youth service and camps and I really was very\ngood with children and I was going to be a schoolteacher. So when I came out of\nBarnard, I, I became a teacher of the fifth grade. I had done my student teaching at\nthe Dalton School and then taught fifth grade at Ridgewood, which is on the\nBrooklyn-Queens borderline. And somewhere in that first year I decided that all my\nlife I had been in a classroom. I started out on one side of the desk and now I was on\nthe other side of the desk and I was curious to see what life was like in New York as\na grown person, not in a classroom. So I decided to take a year off. I took that trip,\nthis was now, I graduated college in '58, so I taught school for '58 to summer '59 and\nI went to Europe and Israel, that was that, that summer, that trip. Freddy had\ngraduated college that year and he also, he decided not to wait, to work a year, he\ndecided to, to go to Europe that year too, we went separately. He left before me and\nhe took a ship across and then he rented a car on the continent, a little Renault\nDefeen(ph), which looks like a tin can that you can pick up. But I had already been\nworking for a year and I decided to do it, Freddy was going to stay at youth hostels\nall over and my mother's mother, my grandmother was alive in Israel still at that time\nand we decided to combine our trips, individual trips to Europe by meeting in Rome\ntowards the end of the summer and going to Israel together to visit my grandmother,\nwhom we knew, she had come to America in the intervening years to visit with my\nmother's sister, my Aunt Mary and had gone back to Israel and so we went\nindividually to Europe and Freddy, we, we went to see Freddy off on the ship on the\nday that he sailed and he also was seen off by the lady who became my sister-in-law,\nRachel and that was really when I first realized that she might very well be, become\nmy sister-in-law. And Freddy and I had agreed to give each other messages\nwhenever we were in a city, by leaving each other messages in the American Express\noffices, so that whenever we came, because that's where we picked up mail in those\nyears. If you went around with a very loose itinerary, you know, I knew I was going\nto England and then from England to Holland and from Holland to France and he had\nhis loose schedule, without knowing what hotels we were going to, but so that was\nhow people frequently communicated. And so I did that and he did that and we\nwould find messages from each other. And then I left a message for him when I got\nto Geneva. I got to Geneva on a Friday and on Saturday he appeared in my, in my\nhotel because he had gone to American Express, picked up and, and he found my\nnote and he knew where I was staying, so we decided then to travel from Switzerland\nthrough Italy to Rome together, since we were supposed to meet in Rome anyway in\na matter of two weeks. I didn't have a car and he had the Renault Defeen(ph). We\nshould have never done that, bad mistake. Because we left Geneva the next day and\ngot into a car accident almost immediately. Poor Freddy, he really felt very bad\nabout that. We were driving along on a country lane, there was a tiny little car in\nfront of us and that man suddenly made a left turn, into a field of wheat. I mean we,\nwe, we, it was just, we didn't know there was a road there, to make a left turn and we\nbanged into him with our little tin can, I was thrown up against the windshield and\nbroke my nose. Actually we didn't know I broke my nose, but I was bleeding and,\nand I said to Freddy, whose German was not terrific any more, I said, \"Don't worry\nabout it, I'll handle it.\" And out of the car, like a little circus car, came this huge man.\nAnd he spoke what is known as SwitzerDutch(ph), which is absolutely not related to\nthe German that I, I mean I couldn't understand him, he couldn't understand me, it\nwas a terrible situation. Anyway we got it sorted out, we were towed and we got into\na hotel near Lausanne and had to lay up there for three days while the car was\nrepaired. Some lady doctor came to the hotel, assured me my nose was not broken,\nbut it really was, cause I have the, I can feel it to this day. And in the course of those\nthree days, it was Freddy's birthday. We went to the top of the yungfrau(ph) together\nand we fought terribly and came evening times, I mean my brother was a 22 year old\nyoung man on the loose in Europe and he wanted to have a good time, but he felt\nresponsible for the sister so he started hanging around with me in the evening, it\ndidn't work. At three days we decided this was not good and he went his way and I\nwent my way by train and we met up in Rome, as we were planned to and then went\nto Israel happily together and then drove back afterwards to Paris and...",
        "A: It was very special, my grandmother was actually, whom we had seen a few years\nbefore that, my grandmother was living in Israel with her son, my mother's brother\nand his family, in Tel Aviv. And actually I had never met my, my mother's brother,\nmy uncle Elias(ph) and his family and so it was a very, very special 10 days that we\nwere all together. And it was my first trip to Israel and that was a exciting thing. As\nI told you, my mother had rehearsed Freddy and me in addresses, in case we were\nseparated during the war and one address was 503 Fifth Avenue and the other one\nwas 108 Benyahuda(ph) Street, which was in Tel Aviv, which was her brother. So of\ncourse my mother had told us a lot about her family there and my Uncle Elias(ph),\nher, her, her brother and his children, one of whom was close in age to Freddy and\nme. And so it was a very nice experience and the first of my visits to Israel. And\nwhen I came back to America after that summer, I told you I had decided to take\nsome time out from teaching and I decided to make myself available to the business\nworld. So, having been an academic students, not what we used to call commercial\nstudents in those days, you went to high school, you either got an academic diploma\nor a commercial diploma, I of course was academic, I had always stuck my nose up at\nthings like typing and shorthand and had a three finger method of typing my papers\nin college. So when I offered myself to the business world, you see, nobody wanted\nme. They all wanted to know what I could do. I said, \"Well what do you mean, what\nI can do, I'm intelligent, I'm a Barnard graduate, I was a teacher.\" And they would\nsay, \"Yes, yes, but what can you do, can you type? Can you do shorthand?\" Again I\nwant to tell you, this is the 50's now. Freddy went to Columbia and I went to\nBarnard. When he graduated, the recruiters came to Columbia and be interviewed by\nthe young men graduating. On my side of Broadway there was no such a thing as a\nrecruiter, our top English graduate got a scholarship to I think, secretarial school.\nWhen a girl wanted to go into publishing, she was advised she should go in as a\ntypist or secretary and work her way up. I venture to say not a boy was told that. I\nthink too, even, even at Barnard and Barnard really has a tradition of professional, of\nwomen who be, who've entered the professions, but most, most of them did not do\nthat. I mean not very many went to medical school or law school, law school\ncertainly not in those years. It's only in retrospect that I realize I should have gone to\nlaw school, a thought that never entered my mind and I probably would have been\ngood as a lawyer, because my mind works that way. But at those, in those years,\ncertainly, there were things women, professions like teaching that women thought\nabout readily and the others you didn't. We concentrated more on working and, and\ngetting married and having children and so we weren't fixated on careers for a\nlifetime, we were interested in having interesting work experiences, but not\nnecessarily lifetime careers. There was a lot of talk about teaching is a good\nprofession cause you get the summers off, you know, that kind of thing. Certainly\nthat has been a great thing of the women's movement I think, the fact that women are,\nare, are encouraged to think about working as a fulfillment of life, perhaps not all\ngood in the sense of what happens to children today, but certainly, if I think back, that\nit never dawned on my, you know, to go for... And this was from a school where\nthere was a lot of emphasis on that, the president of Barnard at the time was a woman\nwho encouraged that a lot. So...",
        "A: Well...",
        "A: Well together in the sense that, you know, if we were not going out of town, if we\nwere not going to be going out of town and staying in New York, then, in terms of\nIvy League schools or the top of the heap, there was Columbia and, and since we\nwere not going to be able to dorm, most of the people who graduated with us, if they\ndid not dorm, went on to Queen's College, you know, in their backyards and then,\nyou know, lived at home, if you're going to live at home, that was as close as we\ncame, so, yeah we were together, but that was really not because we were together,\nit's because we both were able to qualify for top schools and, and that was the top\nschool, certainly within commuting distance, I commuted every day, it was more than\nan hour each way.",
        "A: He lived at home also.",
        "A: Well he took, you see he, he, my mother had, my mother's brother in Israel,\nElias(ph) had been trained as an engineer and my mother got it into her head early on,\nshe used to tell, Freddy used to be found with hammers and nails and taking things\napart and exploring so she always said he's going to be an engineer just like her\nbrother and I guess that stuck in his mind and he in fact took a five year engineering\nprogram at Columbia and, which they were able to do in four years, he came out with\na BS instead of a BA, having done two years in the engineering school and he\ngraduated with an engineering degree as, so yes, then he graduated the year after me\nand he announced that he was going to get married to that young lady, who name is\nRachel and she 1s his wife today, they have three children, live in New Jersey, Cherry\nHill, New Jersey and that is where he has lived, really since he graduated, he, at the\nend of college the recruiters came and Freddy accepted a job with RCA which was in\nCamden, New Jersey. To my great relief because he had spend time in California\nand all that and I was terrified that he was going to move to California and I guess I\nwould have moved with him by that time. So when they were married, they moved\nin commuting distance to his work in, in, in Camden, so they moved to\nHaddenfield(ph) in the Cherry Hill area and have moved, you know, from that little\ngarden apartment into a house and then into the home that they still occupy in Cherry\nHill. They had, eventually, three children, the oldest, Natalie, who is now 30 years\nold and the two twins, who were born triplets, and were triplets for a few days and\nthose young ladies are now going to be 28 and the twins are married and Natalie will\nget married this September. They are the love of my life. My sister-in-law and my\nbrother have been very generous in letting me share 1n those children's upbringing, I,\nI did it with malice aforethought, I made them my little dumplings from the time that\nthey recognized me and have spent a lot of time with them, took them on cruises and\ntrips to the Caribbean in their growing up years and in general, you know, have\ninveigled myself into their hearts and lives, so that to this day, they are my friends\nand indeed, the oldest one, Natalie, lives in an apartment that I own not far from here,\nthe one that I lived in before I moved here. And she live on 58th Street and since she\nis now a grown woman, I have been very fortunate in having her not only live near\nme, but like me enough to make me her friend and so we, we do things together, we\ngo to the opera and the theater together and you know, I, I don't have children of my\nown, a thing that I mind a lot. And the fact that I've had these three children and my\nsister-in-law has generously allowed me to really be part of their lives and not\nresented me for that. Being an aunt, you know, it, it's like being a grandparent, I\nguess, it's the best of all possible worlds, you have none of the responsibility for\ndiscipline and all the opportunity for bribery by being nice and so, you know, if a\nmother and father are resentful, it can make that hard. Rachel and Freddy have been\nvery generous and have allowed me to do my bit with them, so that they've been as\nclose as, you know, it is possible for nieces to be.",
        "A: I always thought so, I, I never had a problem talking about it, but you know, it's\nnot something you, you didn't go around playing with your friends and say, oh by the\nway, do you know that this and this, what happened to me, I mean it was not, you\njust didn't do that. But when it came up, I, I have always considered the war years a\npart of my life in the following way, first of all, my recollection of my parents in\nintimately bound up with that. I mean I can't separate the war years from my\nrecollections of my mother and my father and so I certainly was, I guess I've made\nthat clear by now that I, I find my, my mother's memory to be a very important thing\nto me and I had no intention of glossing over her life or my recollection of her life\nand, and that's part and parcel of those years, so I have never had difficulty thinking\nback, cause I have always wanted to remember her and that's part of it and I've really\nnot ever had a problem discussing it, I've never found that I broke down or couldn't\ntalk about it in any way. I've always been able to do that, I felt, in the early years,\ncertainly in the 50's, as a child, you don't want to be different so you don't call\nattention to those kinds of things and as a, as a grown up I always try to make sure\nthat if the subject came up that I didn't bore people to tears with it or you know, had\nthem morbidly interested in me as a freak of some kind, but I never minded talking\nabout it. I always thought, you know, that that was okay.",
        "A: No, again, you asked first about my class, were there other Jews, that I, did know\nother Jews besides my family? Well, for the most part you know, people tend to\nmove where there are people like them, so I don't know where you're from but\ncertainly Jewish people tend to move to communities, especially observant Jews, tend\nto move to communities where there are other observant Jews, so we did that, that\nwas Kew Gardens. There were no other refugees from the war in my school when I\nwent to that school, not children who actually were survivors. There were children of\nchildren who were survivors, but not actual children, so Freddy and I were different\nin that way, but you know, ____ when it came to our synagogue, I guess 80 percent\nof them had fled Hitler at some point between the 30's and the 40's and so the\ndifference again was that the children in my synagogue, again were not the survivors,\nbut their, but their parents were the survivors so this wasn't strange for anyone. I\ndon't know if you know but in the Jewish religion there is a memorial prayer for the\ndead that is said on the festival holidays, on the last day of the festival holidays and it\nis traditional for the people who still have parents to not remain inside the sanctuary\nat the time that this is said, so they go out and they come back in after that prayer is\nsaid. Well I was very conscious of the fact, in the growing up years that there weren't\nany other children that hung around for that prayer. But in no other way, I think the\npeople, when we first moved in, since everybody was refugees, my family were also\nrefugees and there wasn't much made of that. Some people knew that of course I did\nnot call the adults with me mother and father or mom and dad, but aunt and uncle.\nAnd so, but there was a time when that was pretty common among survivors you\nknow, so yeah, there's, it didn't become a commonplace today, you know, when\npeople hear that I am a survivor, I, I notice their pupils dilate and they look at me\nwith a newfound interest, even people I've known. I got a call about a year ago, from\nmy accountant. I have a business in New York now and I have an accountant. When\nI started with this accountant he was a young man of no consequence. Now he's the\nbiggest accounting firm on Long Island. And I don't have day to day contact with\nhim, I work with somebody who is employed by him. Well, I got a phone call and it\nsaid, \"Miss Kurz? Hold the phone for a moment for Mr. Isrelloff(ph).\" So I got, I\nheld on the the phone and Bob Isrelloff(ph) came on. \"Hey,\" he said, \"Dorian(ph), I\njust came back from Washington, I visited the Holocaust Museum and I pushed some\nbuttons on an interacting and I was just amazed, there was a name there, Dorian(ph)\nKurz and I said to myself, well there can only be one of those and I pressed the\nbutton and there you were on the screen, I had no idea.\" Well, now Bob Isrelloff(ph)\nhasn't made a call to me in perhaps 20 years, you see, but the fact that I was one of\nthe survivors caught his interest and that has happened to me a couple of times. It 1s\nnow that people find you interesting or oddball or noteworthy, if you are a survivor.\nIn the 40's and 50's this was not noteworthy, it was more commonplace. You ask\nabout my nieces and whether they were, when they were growing up, were interested.\nI will tell you that when I was invited to do the, the history for the Holocaust\nMuseum, which I, the visual one that I gave in 1990, one of the reasons that I was\nkeen on doing it was not so much for historical reasons, because I knew there were\nmany people who could give their histories, but one of the reasons I wanted to do it\nwas because I was told I would have a copy of that tape and I wanted my brother's\nchildren to have that visual story because again, growing up, I mean children are not\nvery interested. You know, when, I was born in the year 1936. When people talk\nabout the first World War, I glaze over a little bit, it's somewhere there before I was\nborn and you know how things are before you were born, they're ancient history, they\nhave no relevance. Well, my nieces were born, not just after World War 2, but a long\ntime after World, World War 2, World War 1, what do they know one from the other\nor the Civil War, the Revolutionary War, the Crimean War, I mean it's all one to\npeople who weren't living at that time and I want them to know the story and I was\nanxious for them to have a copy of it. And, so that was definitely one of the reasons\nthat I was keen to do that visual history. And that made me think about other\nchildren who maybe didn't have an aunt or a father who were survivors, who should\nhave an opportunity, if they link in, to, to get stories, you know, even in 200 years.\nWe, we hear today, stories about the Revolutionary War and we don't relate to it\ndirectly and we don't have George Washington or the soldiers of the continental army\nto really talk about it. It would make it more immediate, it would make it not so long\ntime ago and what relevance does it have to us and I think those histories are\nimportant for that reason. Not just for to counteract the revisionists, but to allow\nanother generation to make this not be ancient history, but to pull it up into something\nthat happened to another person, who looks just like them, it's real, it happened to that\nperson that I'm looking at. In the case of my nieces, it will be more immediate than\nthat and they are women now and married and they're going to have families of their\nown very shortly and those children will grow up and hear about the events of World\nWar 2 and what happened to people, the Jews and other in that time. And I want\nthose, I want my brother's grandchildren to look at those visuals and see those visuals\nas something that happened really to them, because their father almost did not\nsurvive, which meant that those children were not going to be. And for other\nchildren, who do not have direct contact in a linear way with the events of that time, I\nthink seeing an actual film of a survivor will cause them to have more connection to\nthat than when we hear about the Revolutionary War. So I think that it is important\nfrom that point of view.",
        "A: She does. Well I don't know, final thoughts are kind of hard. I, I, I have a couple\nof them, I guess. I notice that both Freddy and I are doers, we're very practical\npeople. I think that that is a direct result of our early lives. We, we are, we tend, we\nare survivors in more ways than one. I am not a complainer. I tend to take\ncommand, I tend to grab ahold of my life and make things happen. It turned out I\ncouldn't get a job when I, I was always saying, you know, nobody wanted me and all\nthat and eventually I learned how to do some shorthand and___ around in a couple\nof jobs for a couple of years and it became apparent to me that I couldn't really work\nfor others, I had to work for myself and I opened up a store. I have been a retailer\nnow, on some scale or other, since 1965 and have a pretty large store right now, takes\nup about a half a block and I have 13 employees. And I find I become more bossy\nand more take charge as I go along. I, but I'm very, I am and have been very practical\nand I tend to, not kind of sit back and let life happen. I notice Freddy is the same\nway. We are more controlling and definitely tend to manipulate our lives, rather than\nto be manipulated by it and I think that's very good. In a way, we are both stronger\npeople, I think, than many of the people that I meet. Most certainly there are scars,\nnow I did not marry. I did have a relationship for 30 years with a man whom I could\nnot marry. Consequently I don't have children. He was an older man, almost twice\nmy age when we met and I knew that I should not be in that relationship, but I was\nunable to help myself, I, I, I had a nervous breakdown a couple of times when I tried,\nespecially in the early years to stop that. I lay that off directly on my early years. I\nneeded to be loved and admired by an older man and I needed that support and that\nego lift. And I, I think, that is, is a direct result of the loss of my parents. My father\nwhen I was six and my mother later, I think I needed that. I needed to be the special\nperson in somebody's life again. And that, of course, affected my personal life, even\nin the fact that, the fact that I'm a retailer, cause you know, I mean, then if you don't\nhave a normal marriage and children, then you do other things and so what I did is I\nreally filled up my life and all the little nooks and crannies so now I don't have any\ntime to myself at all. And Freddy, who does have a family and a lovely wife and\nwonderful children, well that still, he is a very closed up person. He was not invited\nto make that original tape at the Holocaust Museum, he came with me that day. His\nmemory of the early years is much more sketchy than mine and sometimes when I\ntalk, he will remember something, it's much more sketchy. He now gives talks, as a\nsurvivor, to schools in his area quite frequently. He started doing that since my tape\nwas made. But he is a much more closed person, he is emotionally, I hope he never\nhears this tape...",
        "A: He, he is much more closed person than I am, he, I said, like he never gives out\ncompliments or anything. He, he'll never say that he loves somebody or he, that he,\nhe's not a person who hugs and he's much more emotionally closed up. Partly he's a\nman, I'm a woman, it's, I'm, I'm, I'm more open than he is, but the fact that he is\nclosed up like that, that he's not able to express his feelings. Like I said, he did it for\nme on my 60th birthday, the window opened and I was amazed and then it closed up\nagain, see, so, but he's much more closed up and I, I, I think that's a direct result of\nour early lives, absolutely. What happens to you as a child always affects, for every\none of us and why should it not be so for us? In a way it has made me stronger,\ncertainly more self-reliant. When my mother died, in my heart I took responsibility\nfor my younger brother and maybe he did that in his heart for me too, I don't know,\nbut I did that, I took, I became a grownup and I took responsibility for maintaining\nmy life and my beliefs in a way that my mother would have wanted to and I, I, I took\non grownup responsibilities, indeed I had done that even during the war. When my\nmother got Typhus and sick and I took her out of that train from which we were\nrescued and carried her to the house and you know, we were called upon as children\nto be more grown up than children traditionally have been and I've maintained that in\nthe grown up years in a way that has made it more possible for me, let's say, to be an\nemployer than an employee. I, I have not been in the dependent stage, willingly\nand...",
        "A: No, I will say that I always intended to marry when I was 18 and have children by\nthe time I was 20, that was my plan for my life and everything about me, mean to this\nday I'm a good cook and I'm a nester. I have had to reconfigure myself into not being\nthat, I've had to squeeze and pull and push myself into begin a career person, I was\nnot made to be that. I really should have been left to be where I was born, a Viennese\nperson, with music and dancing and husband and children, it's really what I started\nout to be and the rest of me, what I am now, I fashioned, I forced, I, it was not what I\nwas meant to be. I love opera, I subscribe, both to the city opera and to the\nmetropolitan, go a lot, I try to go to the theater. I have still friends from my early\nyears here in this country and my, from my school friends, I still maintain them and\nin general, I'm pretty content with my life. I have a nice apartment. And the man\nwith whom I had my long relationship has died and, but, I know, I suppose most\npeople have gaps in their lives, certainly my great regret is not having children, but\ngiven that as a given, then for the rest of it, I don't have too many complaints, I have\nhad cancer 14 years ago, I survived breast cancer. I had a year of chemotherapy, it\nhad spread, I'm very fortunate to have survived another, another thing besides my\nearly childhood events. I consider these years that I've had since the cancer a gift. If\nI were to die tomorrow, I would feel no anger, because I think my time was, if it was\nnot up when I was a child, in those conditions, it was up when I had cancer in the end\nof my 40's. I am 61, I think the years since my cancer are an additional boon, bonus\nand, and I really enjoy most of my life. And as long as those whom I care and love,\ncare about and love, are well, you know and as long as I am able to support myself\nand if I don't become destitute or dependent, in mentally or physically, I will go on\nbeing grateful to God for my continued existence. At the moment, my Uncle\nBenjamin died in 1957 of a heart attack, 1957 of a heart attack, yeah. He was 56\nyears old when he died. And we, by that time of course we were working and my,\nhis wife, my Lillian, Leah, my aunt Leah, she is today 85 years old, she still lives in\nKew Gardens, I spend the weekends with her, usually, in the house in Kew Gardens\nand I'm here in my apartment mostly, during the week and she's okay, she's doing\nwell mentally and physically, mostly. And her daughters, Diana, who is a painter,\nhas a studio and lives in Soho, here in New York and the other daughter, who was\ntwo when I came to this country, Vivian, has great interest in Tibetan Buddhism and\nhas spent a lot of time, both in Nepal in the east and in France and is very much\ninvolved with that and Freddy and Rachel and the girls are fine and getting married\nand the baby's expected this year and so, at the moment, I, I really count my blessings\nand I will continue to do that, every day that is given to us without major problem.",
