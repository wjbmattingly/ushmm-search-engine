When used to come a\nroving circus in town or -- or -- or silent movie in town, that hall was where was showing it. So\nreally, there\u2019s five Jewish family were the key family in town. At that time they didn\u2019t feel very\nanti-Semitic because there\u2019s a close relationship with the community. Community was quite\npoor, so most of the business conducted was on credit, and all those Jews extended credit to the\nfarmer, like the flour mill that would pay more after they got the grain collected, they sold it.\nAnd then in carry -- [indecipherable] of the books, so was -- everything was going fine.

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- in the anschluss, mass emigration of Viennese Jews in Austria came to Yugoslavia.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Now, there were only two country in Europe that were taking Jews, Yugoslavia and Italy.\nYugoslavia because they thought that nothing is going to happen, and Italy done it because some\n-- for some Viennese Jews, especially I would call it aristocrat, professor, doctor and genius,\nYugoslavia is not very appealing. Italy was much more appealing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Now, I\u2019m sure you heard, you know, the part that my wife explained it to you, and you know\nwith the fi -- how Italy opened the border. Mussolini -- it was Mussolini, I want you to\nemphasize that, who was under pressure of Hitler nonstop to do something about the Jews, he\nkept putting him off. Because from day Mussolini enter in the -- in power, in October of 1928,\nthe | -- his liberation in Grand Sasso by Colonel Scorcese, German paratroopers, and then whisk\nhim back to Germany. Nobody touched a J-Jew in Italia, not a single Jew was killed. They put a\npressure on them, they made their life miserable, but was not life threatening, because Mussolini\nwas put in power by Jews. Well lots of Italian Jewish aristocrats, they were Fascists when he\ncome in power. People don\u2019t know that. So he was -- he felt obliged to them, like bonhommes,\nand all these Jews were still you have in Italy perpetuate in the dynasty in their family, but he\nwas under pressure, and he was passing the racial law to pacify --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Because original Mussolini, he had the agreement with Schuschnigg that if Hitler attack\nAustria, he is going to defend Austria. And he\u2019s a chick -- hit -- and Mussolini chickened out. He\nfigured, hey, that guys is stronger, I\u2019m not going to go with my head against the wall. And they\ngot involved in this thing. But that got Nazi in the war, it concern us as a Jewish, as a salvation.\nIf you notice, every Jew entering that passport Italy didn't stamp it. He didn\u2019t want any record\nhow many Jew he let in Italy.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Like when my wife was in the concentration camp, this was like -- first [indecipherable] to go\nhelp him that some Jews are th -- I have a concentration camp. But this concentration in\nFerramonti di Tarsia was a joke. Now, I have a friend who will live in Tarsia, and he was telling\nme story, and I unfortunately don\u2019t have his picture, Italian guard around there, there was little\nbooth where they stayed and guard, but they couldn\u2019t stay there because was -- the little grocery\nstore, with the cigarettes and the fruit and the candy. So even if it\u2019s raining, they just stay in front\nof booths, they\u2019re doing business with the people in the camp. So you come to the fence, and you\ntell the -- ah, Jojo, come here. He say, what you need? Two pack of cigarette.",
        "Q: Yeah, that was before --",
        "A: So, you know. And even in the life in the camp in itself is much completely different life\nbecause they, you know, nobody worry about the life. There were so many engineers, doctors,\nlike Evie told you, when she hurts her finger, everybody come running. That was cream de la\ncream of Vienna, mostly Vienna, in [indecipherable]. Now -- now I\u2019m going back to Yugoslavia\nand Croatia. Croatia didn\u2019t have an organized Jewish community when j -- Viennese Jews start\ncoming Croatia. So what the Croatian community in its -- in itself done -- because you have to\nremember, whole Yugoslavia had 60,000 Jews. That the more Jews in one little town in Poland,\nthe whole damn country of Croatia had -- yugo -- not Croatia, Yugoslavia. Now, Croatia would\nhave approximately 12,000 Jews, more or less. So wealthy Jews in Croatia, being they were not\norganized, each one took a family in the house for boarding and sleeping.",
        "Q: From -- from --",
        "A: From Vienna.",
        "Q: From Vienna.",
        "A: Yeah. I\u2019m talking 1938 - \u00b039. Now mine uncle [indecipherable] in business, and he couldn\u2019t\nbabysit or take care of the people in the house. He took a little hotel in Zagreb called Hotel\nAstoria, and -- and there were 22 rooms, and he put 22 Jewish family in that hotel for duration,\nfood and everything included.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: On his own, without anything to do with the community. What those poor people didn\u2019t\nrealize, that this hotel was taken lease in 1939, and the [indecipherable] lasted only til Easter of\n1941, they had to run again. So the people who choose Italy, they made a better choice.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I just want to tell you --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- amechanic behind the Croatian Jews help the Viennese Jews. Some Viennese Jews made it\nto Belgrade. Now Belgrade Serbia had a much bigger Jewish community. And Serbian people as\na overall, were less anti-Semitic --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- because King Alexander was a big friend of Jews. You -- you -- you -- I\u2019m sure you know\nwho I am talking about. King of Serbia, of Yugoslavia.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And King Staff, you know, Dr. Alkali and all these minister were mostly Jewish. So the Jews\nhad it pretty darn good from the day that Yugoslavia -- inception of Yugoslavia, til the\nYugoslavia fell apart in the whole country.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t grow up with the feelings of being Jewish and there being anti-Semitism in\nCroatia?",
        "A: I -- | -- I -- I brought up in this little community that I know that was anti-Semitism because\nyou always had -- you have it every place. If you don\u2019t have a community that\u2019s anti-Semitic -- I\nmean, I can see -- I felt 1t which 1s there, but not to the extent to be threatened.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: A matter of fact, the kids I went to the school is right now one of them is a surgeon who just\nretired in Zagreb, Croatia, every time I go over there I\u2019m his houseguest. I mean, we grew up\ntogether, we hang her up all the time. And -- and other guy was a son of the post officer\nmanager. He\u2019s living in Opatia in -- in Croatia, also. I\u2019m in -- with him in touch all the time. So I\nkeep in touch with few of them that they remain our friend, even that we couldn\u2019t -- but when\nthey came -- when we couldn\u2019t during the war. But when we come to run, the saddest part it is --\nand I\u2019m know that you\u2019ll be interested in this, when the Nazi come in, they confiscated our\nproperty, they come in April, by na -- by June all our property gone, grocery store, factory and\nall that.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: They send so-called supervisor to run -- they were totally inept. I mean, to -- one -- they sold\nwhat was on stock, they were 1 -- in heap of trouble. But to punish my father, first they send him\non a false labor in a old orchards. They had the big orchard with 4,000 trees of fruits. So all town\ncould see the Jews is coming over there, cleaning the veets and all that. And when this got old --\nand my mother was working with him, too -- then took my father to the -- ready to ship into\nconcentration camp. And they took him to Zagreb where -- to be shipped to the infamous camp\nof Jasenovac, okay? But my aunt, married to attorney in Zagreb, she and the guy -- when she was\ngoing to the [indecipherable] who was th -- at that time she didn't realize, he was a fifth column,\nthat\u2019s a -- you know what\u2019s a fifth ca -- the -- the German Nazi underground all over Europe. She\ndidn\u2019t know that, but he was [indecipherable]. And when Hitler took over, and the Nazi state of\nCroatia was created, she seeing his picture that he become police commissioner. So she call him.\nHis name was Medwid. And he told Medwid, listen, what the hell happen, I thought that you\nlove us. He said, I still love you, but that\u2019s [indecipherable] my job for me. I -- I believe in a free\nCroatia. I didn\u2019t believe the Serb that should dominate [indecipherable] okay then, I don\u2019t want\nto talk politics, I have a problem. My brother-in-law is in Zbore where they put the -- sending\npeople. Said, don\u2019t worry, I take care of it.

        "A: Yes, yes. We started already doing it in 1938, and I was very upset because I -- there\u2019s some -\n- even Berkly German toys, fantastic toys, I mean they\u2019re the best toys on eur -- 1 -- on European\nmarket. Everything disappeared in 1938. I used to like to have a little lead soldiers, I mean the\nwhole army, in trucks and all the stuff. It was not allowed in our hou -- any part to our family,\nnot even family that was bringing me toys. So the -- we did -- we were very much aware what\nwas going on. Unfortunately, didn\u2019t do nothing about it, they still kept s-same -- do business in --\nin Yugoslavia, but we knew what was going on.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Did this make you feel bad as a kid, or did you understand it?",
        "A: It made me feel bad to the point because we\u2019|l -- my dad, especially, he was very fearful, he --\nhe always wanted to get out of it for so -- like I told you before. So \u2019ve become very\nuncomfortable because my dad could not expand his business, he was holding back, while his\nbrother-in-law, my mother\u2019s wealthy brother, he was increasing it.

There\u2019s only one family, close to the railroad station, that tell us well, if\nyou have to leave, come over, we want to give you dinner before you go on the train.

They were so programmed, like the robotics today that you see. It\u2019s amazing. I mean, I\nthink they invented the robotic before their time. I mean, it is funny. A -- later on when we were\nalready liberated, I used to make fun of the damn S.S. because it\u2019s so funny. One of them is\ncoming, and you\u2019re hop, hop [indecipherable] hop, and everybody jump like a bunch of yoyos. I\nmean, I can see that later on when I was serving American army, I was laughing, said boy this\nGerman officer would die if he would come over here. He would try to run American army the\nway do that. But they were very [indecipherable]. Never question a order. I mean, they come in\nthe town, they say -- I saw in Italy, after Italy capitulated, and German took over, and then when\nthey kill two German, the partisan, they took every man they got hold of and they hang it -- them\nup on the trees, they will look like Christmas decoration.

But see, what happened in Yugoslavia, when -- when the Nazi vic -- wanted\nYugoslavia to join the non-aggression pact, and sign this thing that they would fall in line with\nthe Fascist Italy and Germany, it happen [indecipherable]. See, King Alexander was dead, now\nhis brother Paul, who was regent, because Alexander\u2019s son Petar was too young, was only 14\nyears old, so his Uncle Paul was the allegiance -- running the government, he signed that pact\nwith the Nazis.

        "A: When you enter to the joint Italian an-annexed to Italy, like Ljubljana, you know, they\nconsider part of Italy, you have it made. So our job, after they finally get in a s-s -- half safety\nzone, an occupied zone, to get to annexed zone, this was a big thr -- because we know, if we\nreach Ljubljana, we are free. And we manage again, with the help of a -- how would you call it,\nof city manager of a little community by Opatia, you know, in the northern -- little commun --\nmaybe 1200 population. My father become friend with him, he know that we are in hiding, he\nsaid listen, I will need a paper to declare us that we are resident of Grobnik and we have to go to\nbusiness to Ljubljana because we have to catch a bus.

Every head of the family got a five lira a day, wife got three lira a day, for each kids,\ntwo lira a day. So if you add it up, it was not enough for a fantastic life, but you would not be\nhungry. To give you idea how [indecipherable] to a real -- what, over 300 lira something. A rent\nwould cost you 120 lira a month, approximately in the little communities. The rest of it for your\nfood. So they give you enough money to survive.",
        "Q: Right.",

But when he -- once he becoming -- got into safety -- and even before, when we\nwere confined in Modena -- we were sent to Modena, by the way, which -- this a breadbasket of\nItaly. The most fantastic cuisine if you can ever dream. And then we [indecipherable] by this\nItalian family like I mentioned before that helped us eventually, we even -- Italian -- they -- you\nknow, this was the war. So even Italian when they want to go over there and get a supply for the\nwinter, they have to go city hall, get a permission to buy a pig.

My father went with rest Italians have on the\npermission to buy a pig. The Italian give him a pig, he had the pig butchered. We -- we were\nnever kosher, so that was no problem.

Italian everything they do they have their own political version. Even Italian communists\ngo to church. I\u2019m telling you how ridiculous it is. The red shirts and the flag in the church at the\nconfession. So they -- they modified the -- the convenient. So we go to this questura and he tell\nus, now these are the community around here. Do you have any particular town that would you\nlike to be confined? And my father say I would like to go to a little town that is not expensive,\nand that there are nice food around.

So there were five Italian cops, and they were arguing between them, we couldn\u2019t\nunderstand. Little bit, not very much. They were dickering. One guys said, let them go, why the\nhell you playing around with them? And they said no we can\u2019t help it, our duty -- well, we are --\nwe allied of Germany. Send them back to Zagreb.

I mean, they -- the movies, priest was\nshowing, you had the ping pong table, he had the basketball tab -- ev-everything what the kids in\nthis little town which we were confined, [indecipherable]. So I become, you know, with -- when\nyou are with the kids, you pick up Italian very fast. And for me is no problem to ge-get\nintegrated. A matter of fact, to a certain point, I got integrated little too much because my parents\nnoticed that I was going st -- sitting at the mass, and the one time they short of the kids, and the\npriest talked me into be -- helping serve the mass, and I come home, I could serve the mass better\nthan those Italian kids. Why? Because during the Hebrew school -- see, the -- the Testament, Old\nTestament is same. And the kids my age didn\u2019t get to New Testament yet. So what they knew, I\nalready was way ahead of them. And priest was very impressed with it. [indecipherable] told me,\nhow do you know, and he says -- I said we Jews didn\u2019t have to worry about New Testament. We\nworry only about the Old Testament.

        "Q: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s very --",
        "A: Because -- because Italian are flexible. That\u2019s a very good word to describe. Italian are\nopportunistic. Italian -- no, first time that we come to little town it says, oh, the Fascists told us\nthat you Jews were take -- taking eyes out of the kids and that\u2019s why you\u2019re confined. I said\nthat\u2019s a bubkes. That\u2019s not true. And th -- when they got acquainted with you, when they notice\non daily basis the way your people with a -- when they saw that we went, asked the farmer for\nbread, or to give us some flour, or to share us the flour, everything. We th -- it -- it was\nunbelievable, the response of the community, we feel so comfortable. Now we come to the -- the\nSeptember, or armistice, that we got so excited, and finally the war is over. At this point,\nAmericans already past Sicily, they landed on the boot of Italy, and on Calabria. And they\u2019re\nmarching their way the boot. And we are in Florence. That\u2019s like 450 miles down the boot. Lots\nof mountains. So we, a little educated, we knew what was expected that there\u2019s not going to be a\npancake, especially the German from the Brenner --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- were coming out. But when we had to run to go back when -- when the Italy collapsed, you\nknow, and when we had to run, the questura, the -- these Fascist headquarters that tell my father\npick up where you want to go, he send the word to the priest of the town telling people to get --\nhe had a -- a lot of that, because starting tomorrow Nazi are taking over, I\u2019m out of business.\n[indecipherable] ever protect him, so whatever you can do for them, do for them. Then the -- the\nAndreoli relayed this to us. Andreoli had the connection with the priest in Florence, and they call\nthat priest in the Florence, said we got these refugees here, and we\u2019re going to have to put them\nsomeplace because Americans are coming up the boot, we know that it is only a question of\ntime. Can you help us? So the priest said, I see what I can do. And sure enough [indecipherable]\nthey couldn't s -- we had only hours, said okay, tell him to go to -- to Florence, and go to such\nand such a store in piazza Pitti, you are f-familiar with Florence? In piazza Pitti, right in front of\nthe Palazzo, piazza Pitti --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It\u2019s a little leather good store.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Hamer leather goods store, and selling to -- ca -- look for Senor Torchio. Senor Torchio is\ngoing to take over from there. Now this is only two blocks from Ponte Vecchio.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Okay?",
        "Q: When Ponte Vecchio is --",
        "A: Is on the ri -- that\u2019s right. So they say we -- they send us over there, we already on next train,\nwe have a problem. We got to make to -- to Florence, and from the station to that store roof,\nmissed the -- we\u2019re -- was --",
        "Q: How do you get there?",
        "A: Yeah. We went on the foot, we didn\u2019t want -- we tried to be like 20 - 30 feet apart,\nindividually, not as a family. All these Fascist Italian with the Nazis decoration and I\u2019m talking\nhard [indecipherable] they volunteered. They were embarrassed because Italy collapsed. So we --\nfinally we made over [indecipherable] I got place for you, it\u2019s not very far. You go over there,\nand via Borgo San Jacobo, this is a street right next to Ponte Vecchio, and th-the houses all --\none was on the [indecipherable] and the other was across the street. And wa -- were called via\nBorgo San Jacobo and was going -- extending about three, four blocks. He say go and visit -- I\nforgot the number exactly, and talk to the housekeeper, who take care of palazzo. They -- the\ngarden apartment in palazzo. She was called -- so called portiniya, you know, that\u2019s a -- in\ncharge of whole building [indecipherable] whoever needs anything. Here you would call it\ndoorman, but she was not doorman. You come to this, you at s -- anyway, in this apartment was\nItalian colonel, very big Fascist, who was so ashamed that Italy collapsed, that he volunteered for\nRussian front. Now, what the Nazis did, the S.S. come, seal his apartment, because he knows\nsomebody else is going to try to rob it or take it over, some Nazi or Fascist, so nobody can touch\nit. So obercommand from deutsche politsi sealed the apartment with a seal. But she has a key\nfrom back door. So in this apartment of this Nazi, we were refuges in there with Ruza, with this\nattorney husband, my father and me. Ruza was the only versatile enough to go in the street not to\nbe s-suspected she\u2019s not Italian. She blended in perfectly and Italian was quite good. So all the\nsupply that we needed --",
        "Q: She got.",
        "A: -- was Ruza provide.",
        "Q: Your mother\u2019s there too, yes?",
        "A: Yeah, what -- this th -- oh, five of them. Big apartment. Ah, there\u2019s a radio, we were listen\nradio London, and [indecipherable]. Had everything.",
        "Q: Yeah. But you have to hide there, you have to --",
        "A: We are hiding, of course, nobody in building know we are there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t worry that some Nazi come in because it\u2019s sealed. My mother catch t-typhoid\nwhile we are here in that apartment.",
        "Q: Typhoid?",
        "A: Typhoid.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So again we go back to Mr. Torchio. He said, [indecipherable] okay, I get you a doctor. At 11\no\u2019clock at night, Italian Fascist doctor, a major with a Fascist uniform, come over to the door and\ntell to Neila Fussi, that our house ki -- was hiding at -- say you got here a Jewish family hiding,\nand she almost doody in her pants. She said yes. Say, I\u2019m a doctor so and so, that Mr. Torchio\nsend me over, you got some people sick here. So he was coming there every night, giving us\nshots, and taking care of my mother, at the risk of his own life, that\u2019s why he\u2019s coming 11\no\u2019clock at night. Stealing the serum from the military supply, til my mother got well. After the --\nfour [indecipherable] say no, it\u2019s very dangerous for me and for you, I don\u2019t want to come\nbecause somebody might follow me. You know, you never what they do [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- he said. Now, she\u2019s to the point of recovery, she\u2019s not infectious any more, so you can relax\na little bit. But one thing she is desperate is a vitamin C. Where the hell do you get vitamin C?\nAgain you go back to Mr. Torchio, to a -- and don\u2019t worry about it, he said. It\u2019s a monastery up\nthere, the hill above Florence, the nuns. They growing lemons on the tree inside monastery. Next\nday we had all the lemons and stuff that we wanted. Just to give you a little [indecipherable] this\nis absolutely mind boggling. So my mother weather this things out. Now, Americans already in\nfront of Florence. German are feeling the heat. And German Hauptcommander give the order\nthat all the streets facing the Arno River have to evacuate because there\u2019s somebody that screw\nup in [indecipherable] think American won\u2019t be able cross the arn -- Arno River. Now, the only\ncity they didn\u2019t blow up is Ponte Vecchio. Now everybody thought that Ponte Vecchio, first of\nall, Germany loved the arts, and they didn\u2019t want to destroy. It was something else, German\nengineers, they figure out Ponte Vecchio cannot hold American Tiger tanks.",
        "Q: Anyway.",
        "A: Yeah, so they will not tr -- the Americans are not stupid, is not going to close it. So when the\nAmericans -- they didn\u2019t touch it. So they left this here. With the rest of it, where we lived -- but\nit didn\u2019t blow up. They gave us four hours to move. Not us, the whole build -- now we didn\u2019t\nwant [indecipherable] no more, because now we are [indecipherable] with Italian.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: 4,000 refugee in Palazzo Pitti. Now, that\u2019s where is -- where all the art gallery be, all the fun\nstuff. Now, the shelf where used to be those expensive things, we took the picture and pile them\nagainst the wall, and those were our beds, because they were 18 inches apart. Now in the garden\nthere were two wells of water. Now, for four days, the 4,000 people only supplied the water for\nthem in this Palazzo Pitti, was this thing. No bathroom facility. But we really made that flower\ngarden really flourish. Now you --",
        "Q: Are you staying outside?",
        "A: Ob no, no. We -- we --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- we\u2019re 1-1n the -- in the garden --",
        "Q: Inside.",
        "A: -- inside, during the night, all of them in the building. Younger people, without the kids, they\nwere sl-sleeping in the garden, they didn't want to. But for us they give us, with the family, we\nwere using the shelves as a bed. Didn\u2019t have no mattress or anything, a blanket, or you coat,\nwhatever you could put under the head.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: On the fourth day, about three o\u2019clock in the morning, when they blow all the houses, and I\nhit the -- the air percussion was so strong that my head hit the bunk above it. I really -- moved\nme up [indecipherable] everybody, we know bye-bye, Germans are gone. Now here come the\nAmericans. You know how long took Americans to cross river? They brought those big\nCaterpillar bulldozer, and they fill up the Arno River in two hours. Italians -- the whole Florence\ncome to see what the hell that stupid American\u2019s doing. Like nothing. They use the ruins of the\nbuilding, they actually done him a favor. They just pushed the debris in the river. But they were\nsmart, they couldn\u2019t keep it very long, otherwise they would block the flow of the river.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: When they were on the o-other side, they cleaned it up dimen -- and then they come,\nAmerican pontoon engineer and put those temporary bridges in -- in 48 hours river was flowing\nand American was going both direction. Now come -- we report right away to American\nauthorities. And they tell us, okay, we got the camp in Rome, which all the foreign refugee, now\nquote unquote, who are awaiting repatriation to their homeland are going ahead to the camp of\nCinecitta. Now we are going to move you on the trucks partly, and partly the trains, because\nsome part the [indecipherable] train is not working. So we have to move you from Rome to\nGrosseto by truck, and then we put you on the train to Rome. We couldn\u2019t care less, we\u2019re\nsleeping the army tent, I got introduced to the corned beef, and to all the American good stuff\nwith the breakfast. Egg -- powdered eggs, the first time in my life, you ever tried them?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: You wouldn\u2019t believe it. You would -- you -- but was all kind of food you wanted. Bacon, oh\nmy God, was coming out of your ear. And you could eat as much as you want. I mean, there\u2019s\nnot such a thing you what -- what is --",
        "Q: And who was cooking? What was --",
        "A: American army.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you",
        "A: Was ya -- you -- it was just --",
        "Q: -- so you were eating with the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It was regular under tents you know, no building. When --",
        "Q: Under tents?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- it was sh -- f -- like MASH, only without the hospital in the field tent.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And -- and then they put the truck, take us to Rome. Now we arrive -- we were liberated\nsometime in the first part of the August, th -- took about, I think, one weeks journey from\nliberation to arrive in Rome. By time we arrive in the camp in Rome, Evie was there already\nbecause she was liberated four days before me. She was further down south. But that time her\nmother was working, her father was working, and in -- in order our family, which was friend of\nEvie\u2019s from V-Vienna, they were in Ferramonti. They were liberated before so they were first in\nthe camp, and that\u2019s was a mother, father, daughter and Kelmer was a son-in-law of that Winkler\nfamily. Family was Winkler and son-in-law was Kelmer. And he was a typical Jewish Viennese\nfinagler. Al-Always know his [indecipherable] to find. It took him exactly 10 days that he\nbecome a general manager of the kitchen for refugee. He spoke a little Italian, spoke a little\nGerman, he was able to get connection with Americans, say hey look, you\u2019re a guy, we need\nsomebody to run this kitchen, we got about turnover between 900 and thousand prov virtually\nevery week, and we need to put it together a staff to feed and take care of it. Now one thing you\nknow about American, they\u2019re not multi-lingual.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So they need a multi-lingual staff to take care of this [indecipherable] because there were 10 -\n15 nations. But next to us was a Italian camp, still in Cinecitta, just for Italian refugee. That\nItalian [indecipherable] took care of it. But was a big different in the food and supply what\nAmerican were taking care of in Italian [indecipherable]. So Italian refugee would be delighted\nto be in the foreign camp, but couldn\u2019t get in foreign na -- now, by the end it came they were\nlooking -- 1-1f car -- 1s approaching some kind of American holiday, I don\u2019t remember if was\nLabor day or whatever it is. And American guys the officer wanted to have a holiday. So they ma\n-- they send a feeler out, any of the refugees you know how to cook, we need a cook and a baker\nto make cakes. So I asked my mo -- my mother says how long for how long. He says, well all\ndepend how good you cook. So sh -- my mother start cooking for 30 guys. Now, Evie\u2019s mother\nwas already working for the employees of the camp. Now Kelmer, that guy who was first\narrived, he was running refugee kitchen, so I\u2019m telling you how those Jews got all situated in key\nposition. Now my mother wa -- pure accidentally because my mother was a gourmet cook and a\nbaker. So she prepared, you might think, Labor day meal what -- August was Labor day, because\nwe arrived in August. And she cook him a pishinger torte and a Dobish torte, and a Sacher torte,\na -- you name it. And the guy said -- and then say she cook him paprika golish and stuff. Sa --\nsays hey listen, we got to hook up with the girl. So she -- Mother told him, you know what? You\nhave three Slovenian guys, helpers. All of them know about cooking a little bit. I\u2019m considering\nthe deal, but I want those three guys as helpers because I cannot handle it by myself. I know\nthese guys know what they are doing, and if I give them direction [indecipherable]. She got the\njob. Now my Aunt Ruza that was liberated with us, when we come to the camp the first thing\nthey want to 1-1n -- give us injection and all the protection all diseases. But my Uncle Pawel ba --\nmy smart attorney, is like Evie\u2019s brother, no injection of me. Nobody\u2019s going to poke me with\nthe needles. Next day he left the camp to live in Rome. Found hisself a little apartment\n[indecipherable]. And they never came back to camp. Lucky for them [indecipherable] order that\nmy mother got job in the kitchen, because they never had to spend a di -- dollar for grocery.",
        "Q: Mm-hm",
        "A: They came twice a week for the food supply that you will not believe it, the shopping\n[indecipherable]. It just happened the chief of police, again a refugee, was a gradanier, Serbian\ngradanier from Belgrade, he was a royal guard, about six foot five, he becomes chief of police.\nWe become friendly with him, and that [indecipherable] our family was schlepping this stuff,\nsaid did you come for the supplies?",
        "Q: He knew.",
        "A: He not only knew it, he say that\u2019s what they have, you want me to get you Jeep to take you --\nthey were living in piazzi [indecipherable] maybe only four miles down the road from Cinecitta.",
        "Q: And Ruza is with him? Cause it --",
        "A: Yeah, Ruza is with Pawel in the apartment. Ruza was carrying, and Pawel, but some of the\nstuff is heavy, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They had to catch a streetcar to go back.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So he ask him, you want my Jeep to take you home. It was so funny. He -- Evie -- when sh --\nwhen Evie was standing next to him, he was resting his elbow over on Evie\u2019s head because she\nwas so small.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Sorry. But that\u2019s why my mother got employed in the camp in Cinecitta, and -- and we\nthought we were living like kings. Now people, who went out to Rome on their own become\nwealthy. They were dealing with gold, they were dealing with all kind of mishigosha zachen on\nthe black market. But we were content, we didn't want to take any chances, we didn\u2019t want to\nrock the boat, we were very happy and we live like king because we got those private rooms that\nused to be dressing room of the stars. Like, we were in a room that used to be dressing room\nfrom Italian actress Alida Valli, I don\u2019t know if you ever heard of her.",
        "Q: Her -- see, I don\u2019t know her --",
        "A: Okay, but --",
        "Q: -- but I know it was great film --",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: -- studio.",
        "A: -- SO we were -- and we had the running water in the bathroom, and all of that. And then I\nhooked up with Evie\u2019s brother and Heinz Winkler. That was the brother-in-law of Kelmer --\nKelmer and Mary Winkler\u2019s dau -- really, Winkler\u2019s sister.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And they become a little clique in the camp, and I thought that I had died and went to heaven,\nI love it. Four -- five Austrian Heinz\u2019s, and me --",
        "Q: And you.",
        "A: Yeah, I fell in this group. So it was four -- I couldn\u2019t speak German, except a little that I pick\nup at home. But those guys was constantly blabbering in -- in German, so I was forced to\n[indecipherable]. So we decide, look, we got these [indecipherable] Jews for the camp, at least\n20 percent of that which -- let\u2019s organize Jewish community center. Hell, the Americans have\ntheir [indecipherable] and on their own the Jewish community center is getting all kind of goods\nfrom America. So we go over there to Jewish community [indecipherable] says, my name is\nMoishka Pinsel, we would like to make a Jewish community center in the camp at Cinecitta,\nwhat can you do for us? Says, well you bring us the membership, give us the name all the kids\nyou have, and then come once a week, [indecipherable] the chocolate, and the candy, and all\ninformation you need. Said, but you got to have some kind of orth -- organization. Here -- go\nback in the camps, so I tell every brother, okay, you are going to be vice-president, you are going\nto be treasurer, so m-make a little legitimate thing. We go Italian print shop, and we go to Italian\nhaberdashery shop. We gather those -- you know, like American hats what the soldier wear?\nWith a big Magen-David with a green background, and we become a -- Jewish boys\n[indecipherable] Cinecitta. Come for the [indecipherable] Jewish -- the own special bridge, we\ncreate it. We --",

        "A: Oh yeah, sure.",

        "A: We were just the managing, see, because we are on permanent stock.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: The rest of kids were coming and going.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So they have to have a nucleus who is running the thing. And we came here with a room for\nmeetings. And we had the minutes for the meetings, because Americans are not stupid, they\nwanted the minutes from the meeting before they give us chocolate. But first time that we got\nchocolate, give us so much chocolate I tell to Winkler, my friend that\u2019s still live in Kansas City,\nsaid, \u201cListen Heinrich, we got only 32 kids, Americans give us like 100 box. Let\u2019s sell them back\nand make money [indecipherable]",

        "A: Yes. We still had the -- more than we need.",
        "Q: Where did you -- where did you money to do these hats?",

I mean that, I was in a\n-- a quartermaster. I would take a hundred pair of tee shirts, I will go to the motor pool and I will\nsay, listen, I need the Jeep, I need this, I need that. I didn\u2019t steal, I didn\u2019t get a dime. But I\nchanged the services [indecipherable]. I went to the kitchen in Tokyo and I told the chief cook, I\nsaid, you know what, I would like to come -- when I come from Tokyo, a little t-bone steak, I\nwould like it when I come at two o\u2019clock in the morning, kitchen is working all night, I don\u2019t\nwant that you give me hard feelings. But you will never have to make application for the white\npaints and the shirts, anything. You come to me, I take care of it. Pll bypass the slips altogether.\nAnd that worked for me for year and a half in Tokyo.",

And I say damn it, I went to Japan and\nKorea in the ship, I don\u2019t want to do that again. The army transport ship, you sleeping in the cots\neight high, one on top of the other. And I was stupid that I was figure I don\u2019t want to crawl up\nthere, I was going to be the bottom [indecipherable]. And the sergeant who was on top told me\nson, crawl as high as you can.

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I learned, so I said I\u2019m not going to go through this. So when I had to take a medical\nexamination to return back I said to my doctor, what can you do for me to send me back by air?\nSaid, ah, that\u2019s if you\u2019re sick, wounded, high ranking officer. So, you know sir, I know you buy\nyour uniform. How would you like to have a three pair of headquarters -- I mean lowquarter\nshoes, a couple of pair of boots, some underwear, and I gave you a uniform to put me on the air.\nSays how can you do it? I says, you put me on the air and you\u2019|l see. He says, you have a deal.\nSo he wrote a paper that severe motors -- motion sickness, that I got deathly sick. So -- but I\ndidn\u2019t trust that son of a gun, so I brought him all the left shoes, and I brought him pants but no\njackets. And I brought him shorts, but no tee-shirts.

Now, he put the manifest that I\u2019m very si -- problem\nwith sickness. He said, be sure when you arrive San Francisco, ambulance be there for you, so\nyou better be very sick. So I was there, and they sure pick me up with the orders\n[indecipherable], but when we stopped next to a telephone booth, I couldn\u2019t resist to jump to call\nhome that I\u2019m back in States.

        "A: No, I had a -- I went to Italy with Zdenko Bergl, my father, none of the family changed his\nname. We had a false name later at a certain point when we went in the hiding, when we got the\nmatter of our false paper which were issued to us during the German occupation of Italy, then I\nbecome Luigi Bianchi.",
        "Q: And was that in Florence?",

And they gave us birth benevento, which is southern Italy already in American hands.\nSo if they wanted to find out if is true or not, they couldn\u2019t. So they had the foresight when\nissuing the false paper, that they\u2019re issuing for a province there is no way the Nazi or Fascist\ncould check it out.",
        "Q: Right. But not -- not -- so this is when you were moving from Modena to Florence?",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we didn\u2019t want to press our luck to go, you know, a-around just for a walk. We just needed\nto go from point A to point B, in case you get stopped you have some kind of paper. And those\npaper were issued to us on the way to Florence.",
        "Q: Now, did you keep those papers when you were in Florence so you -- so in case --",
        "A: I keep these paper -- no, I kept them in Florence, I kept them to -- to this day, til I turn it over\nto the institute in Washington. They kept the original, they send me the photocopy.",

        "Q: And it was no --",
        "A: So it was no problem, no, no, no. Til -- til -- til the moment that the Germany took Italy over,\nwe didn\u2019t have no problem at all. We could move more -- more than you -- more than you can\neven imagine.",
        "Q: So you were outside playing, and --",
        "A: I was with the kids playing, my father was going dealing with the farmer, we\u2019re going to\nbicycle to neighboring town. Nobody ask anything. A matter of fact, when -- I\u2019m going to go\ntake you back, I suppose you know a little bit about opera.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you listen to opera. So we went to listen to him -- we went to ask can we go and listen to\nhim, he says, what do you mean if you -- give a permission? It\u2019s a law that you got to listen to\nBenjamino. They were so proud of him. So we really had a -- you know, when -- when I think at\nthe same period the Jews were dying in these concentration camp --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- it was obscene how free we were. And we felt free. We never worried one single second til\nMussolini was in power, for us. And I\u2019m quoting in power himself, because once the Italian\ngovernment failed, and the new republic si -- si -- Repubblica Sociale Italiana, become in\nformation and Hitler arrested the member of Grand Consiglio, those are the people that voted\nMussolini out of power, arrested all of them. In between him was -- between them -- I\u2019m trying\nto ration myself, so I better slow down. Between them was Galeaggo Cino, which was his --\nMussolini\u2019s son-in-law, which was married to Edda Mussolini, ex-Italian ambassador in Berlin.\nHitler hated his guts because every time come back from Berlin and told Mussolini, his father-in-\nlaw, \u201cDad, German don\u2019t know I speak fluent German. They think you are idiot. They think you\nare a patsy, they have no respect for you.\u201d And Hitler wrote that he reported that to Mussolini,\nbecause Mussolini told Hitler, you know, I -- you think I\u2019m such a joke because I got\ninformation. So didn\u2019t take Nazi very long to put together that the only person present when they\nwere making fun of him was Galeaggo Cino.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So when Italy capitulated they managed to arrest all the member. Mussolini got nothing,\nGaleaggo Cino was shot in Verona with the rest of the member of the Grand Consiglio.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And when Edda went to her father and told him listen dad, you [indecipherable] I don\u2019t want\nto ever know about you. Mussolini told Edda, my dear, I have nothing to say. And Edda didn\u2019t\nbelieve him. And when Mussolini was on the run, Edda could saved him with partisans, but she\ndidn\u2019t want to.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Because when they caught Mussolini on the run in Como, in Swiss border, the partisan got\nahold of Edda, and says, who? She told him she will never forgive him and she never did, til she\ndied.",
        "Q: Cause she thought she had --",
        "A: Yeah, now i -- 1 -- but a little interesting background because we are going ho -- more -- more\nin depth than my own pis -- personal biography, that Mussolini could have been saved, see, when\n-- when Cardinal Montini -- was Cardinal Milan at that time, later become Pope, he told Duce\ndon\u2019t leave anyplace, American be here in three days. His entourage, that was loaded with the\ngold and jewelry, they were -- they were in hurry to cross the border and go to Switzerland\nbecause they figured that\u2019s the only way they can take booty across. And they figure if you have\na Mussolini with that, you have a sure way to pass the border. Well, they didn\u2019t, because at\nZongo they caught him and all of them. But when -- Montini told him three times, Duce, don\u2019t\nleave. And I have a personal feeling if he would not run by American, I! Duce would be alive til\nhe died a natural death, because mis -- America would never kill him. But we felt very safe until\nMussolini -- the way it was.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We ne -- we never worry a single second. [indecipherable] lots anti-Semitic law, he will -- he\nwrite the story what happen in Italy, and there were unpleasant things, especially for Italian Jews,\nthey become sort of -- Italian Jew resented Mussolini more than us, because Italian Jews helped\nhim get in power, so they become very resentful. We look at from different perspective. We look\nto our savior. And they look at him and feel we were wealthy and prosperous, he took it away\nfrom us.",
        "Q: So [indecipherable]",
        "A: So it was nothing, you know, cutting -- you know, it wasn\u2019t simple solution. It was a much\nmore complicated than appear in the surface. But that\u2019s -- y -- that\u2019s -- about this period that\u2019s all\nI got to say, except if you got any questions.",

        "A: The -- the first place that we run across, and was --",
        "Q: Had you been studying for your Bar Mitzvah?",
        "A: No, no, nothing, nothing.",

        "A: It -- it was kind of winged under -- like a underground Bar Mitzvah.",
        "Q: Did you do --",
        "A: You didn\u2019t have no Torah, you didn\u2019t read, you didn\u2019t make a speech. My dear mother and\nfather, my uncle and all this the American kids do, it was nobody there. We were three poor Jews\non the run. So th --",
        "Q: So there was no rabbi?",
        "A: No -- n-no, it was no rabbi. It was a cantor that we went to visit.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: That he was in the hiding also.",
        "Q: I see. So it wasn\u2019t a real thing.",
        "A: No, no, but --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- the best we can d-do on the --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- circumstances. You know, if you will go get a bunch together Jews to go ahead, to try to\nperform a ceremony, it be just like going a open trap.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Especially where you were --",
        "A: So it was not -- it was not feasible, it was not possible. Now if that was -- if I had the Bar\nMitzvah in Ljubljana, yes, it c -- we could have pulled it off.",
        "Q: You could have.",
        "A: Oh yeah, plenty Jews in Ljubljana.",
        "Q: In Modena were there other Jews?",
        "A: In mo -- in province of Modena, yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: P-Province of Modena had approximately 250 Jewish families spread out. We -- some of\nthem from Croatia --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- some of them Austrian. Lots of them I never had the chance to meet, but yes, we do,\nbecause 1-Italian -- once 1-1 -- once Italian Jew government accepted Jews to come across, they\ndidn\u2019t send them no more in deep south. Deep south, was only camping for a month there\nbecause Mussolini wanted to go ahead and show Hitler that he put the Jews in a difficult\nposition, which was not difficult position. For a month it was in very unpleasant climate, but if\nItalian could survive there, I mean, Jews can survive also. But they put them there in the boot of\nItaly, clear in the bottom. But the rest of the Jews I would say nobody went souther than Naples.\nI mean in confinement by Italian government.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, right, right.",
        "A: I remember in -- when my Aunt original -- Ruza and Pawel, they were sent to Rovigo,\nprovince of Rovigo, which is close to Padowa, and we were sent to Modena. And then we\ndecided, why should the sister be separated? L-Listen to this, is less conceivable. So we go ahead\nand write to Rome, and say listen, my name is so and so, we appreciate very much for your help,\nbut my sister is in province Rovigo, is only hundred miles from here, why we cannot live in the\nsame town? There no problem. S-Send the paper to Ruza, move over there to Modena with your\nsister. I mean, is incredible.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Resume --",

        "Q: Right. Are you hearing what\u2019s going on in Europe? Are you hearing about death camps or\nanything?",
        "A: Not only that we -- we heard Italian propaganda because Italian press and Italian radio had\nevery hour bulletin. And one thing I like about Italian, Italian would never have a bulletin that\nsays American troops advance and we lost the Sicily. Italian rado -- radio would say something,\naccording to our established the plans of defense, we moved our defense troop on the other side\nof Straits of Messina. On the other side of -- that mean that Sicily is gone, if they moved the\ntroops on the side of Straits Messina, if you know geography. In -- or if, like for example when\nthey lost Bali, it says in Italian, [speaks Italian here]. We retire -- we retreated according\npreviously established plan. Baloney. They were after -- Mark Clark was after them til Naples,\ngoing like wildfire, then it stop. From Naples on to Rome took him five months.",

And they know that my uncle was already in Switzerland, so that sh --\nthey not worry eventually if they catch us, that he might honor our promissory loss.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- a promise in the sky. But they were more interested helping us than worry for this money.",
        "Q: And they give you 50,000 lira?",
        "A: 50,000 lira that would be money today about 12,000 bucks.",

        "A: Well, a ton of money. Can you imagine when I come to Kansas City, the minimum wage was\n75 cents. And that was before, so it was much m -- I don\u2019t know what was -- and that was 1943,\nso minimum wage in America was probably 35 cents.

He drove me from his apartment in Zagreb to the\nairport in Milan. Very few people do favors like this. Never thought of a single second, said\nwhat\u2019s the big deal? Pll drive you to the airport. And he did. And many other reasons. Whenever\nI come I stay in his house, and you have this [indecipherable] atmosphere.",

We were all big soccer fans and playing soccer and so on. And\nwhenever we go, when I return home, it\u2019s so sad, and it\u2019s so funny, and so blessing, that we go to\nthe old stomping ground that we grew up and he drives me around and say remember what we\ndid here, remember what kind of -- we pul -- we -- you reminiscing what you youth, and --",

        "A: -- I didn\u2019t miss it because all I remember 1s the -- my childhood what I have. And I was\ngrowing. I outgrew my child day -- I was become in Italy a young -- my puberty reached me. I\ndiscovered girls. And in Italy you had all kind of girls. It was completely different\n[indecipherable]. I come from a little nothing town in Croatia, Sv. Ivan Zabno, end up living in\nRome. I\u2019m going from Modena to Florence and now in Rome. Now just imagine -- now this is\none of the most sophisticate city in Europe.

I didn\u2019t have an I.D.. I used to\nride on the train with the refugee I.D. card, because that was a-after one -- years. Is very difficult\nfor somebody who didn\u2019t live in this period to -- the concept what was happen. Once Italian\ngovernment normalize and took over, this picnic was over.

        "A: The people took everything over. So really, they still didn\u2019t have nothing. First the Nazi took\nover, now the commie take it over. Now, you want me to take off from this point? My father\nrealized from the minute that we have to run, already in 1941 that it\u2019s very unlikely we going to\nsee anything for a long time, maybe never. So he made the peace of mind. He were depressed,\nyes, he know he had to start again, but the other hand, when my father was fighting for Austro\n[indecipherable] empire, he had his own business, which he lost it, because when Austria lost the\nwar, he was on the other side of the border, he did come out barehanded. That\u2019s why he had to\nwork again. He was in own -- own business. So that was second time he lost everything. So he --\nthat was like a repetition of the history. Each war costed them everything they accomplished. At\nthat time Dad was not young any more, he was already 45 - 50 years old. So the -- what --\nbeyond -- my father was very -- he always believe in real estate, so he went -- 1-it didn\u2019t upset\nhim very much. It upset my mother much more than upset my father. Now, w-while we in\nCinecitta, the yugo -- Tito send his emissary to the camp to make a speech to all the Yugoslav\nrefugees that it\u2019s time to returning home. A-And they invited all to a hall, and they went to look\nfor everybody who come from Yugoslavia, and told them the war is over, now you got a free\ncountry, it\u2019s time to come home.",

Then my father hire some tutoring for Italian and some other subject, chemistry. But\nmath, languages, history, geography, Ruza husband tutor me for my exam.",

        "Q: And you passed all those.",
        "A: Yeah, it was very tough, it was very iffy because it was lots of cramming to do, and when you\nc -- study so intensely for a short period of time -- and oh, forgot most important part, Ruza\nhusband tutor me in Latin, mandatory in Italy. Latin, oh, you had to take it first three years of\njunior high you had to -- you had so much Latin you think you want to be a priest or a\npharmacist. Because in Italy, in Europe, til 20 years ago, every prescription was in Latin.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It\u2019s not like here.",
        "Q: You had never studied Latin before.",
        "A: Never, never, so Ruza probably -- he -- he was such a fantastic innovator, that to realize that\nthese young guys, to -- to go [speaks Latin here], you know, it\u2019s a verb. That\u2019s very hard to cram\nall that you need. So he improvise kind of off color stories in Latin that he made us translate in\nItalian because he know that will sink in. Like he would say the -- I cannot tell you on camera,\nbut it was very funny story. Like, he gallo -- this 1s not off-color by the way, he [speaks Latin\nhere]. Here is the rooster sitting on a tree and saying cuckoo-re-koo. But then he come -- that\u2019s\nhow we started, then to get us more interested, he come to more color and it worked, because we\ncome intrigued, you know, what the hell it means, and -- and we managed to squeeze in -- in my\nexamina -- then when we left the camp in 1947, after three years of Cinecitta, and my father said\nlook, now you have to decide to do, and where you want to go to school. So my father left, he\nmade a couple of trips to northern Italy, to figure out where we want to stay and live in Italy, and\nhe come up with Lake Como. He said was not the big city like Milano, is not the big cit -- Rome.\nThe life [indecipherable] is happy go lucky, beautiful surroundings, sweet [indecipherable] next\ndoor. So we went over there, and I enrolled in architectural college [indecipherable] in Como.\nAnd that\u2019s when I started studying, and I went -- I was short one year when our paper come\nbecause I was trying to catch as much extra credit as I could, because I know sooner or later you\ncome for America. But I didn\u2019t manage to do them all, because I was short, I think, about four or\nfive hour of credit. And when we ask postponement for one year, American embassy told us we\ncan postpone, but you go in the bottom of the list.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And my father would not go to bottom of the list. And I was looking forward to go to the\nbottom of the list. I was not in hurry to go to America. A matter of fact, I told my father, you\nknow, you -- I\u2019m not going to States. And my father said, \u201cYou know, I want to tell you\nsomething. First of all, I want you to know you\u2019re in Italy. In Italy, til 21, \u2019m running the show.\nIf I have to go to Italian police to put you on the boat in Naples, I will do it. So don\u2019t make a\nmistake.\u201d And I know he would have done it. So I finally give in, and -- and then we went to the\nCamp Obanioli when --",
        "Q: Why didn\u2019t you want to leave?",
        "A: Because this concept of a Euforia, and a I-land of milk of honey, it was baloney. I know that\nAmerica established with the hard work. It was not such a thing as free lunch. I was smart\nenough, I was not -- I didn\u2019t have a mental delusion. I was looking for what it is. Here I was --\nmy father was working his rear end to go ahead and send me to school, my only preoccupation\nwas to make a decent grade, which I tried to do a little bit by studying, but a lot by cheating. And\nI become a expert -- 1f I would study so hard as I study how to cheat to pass a test, I'd be a\ngenius. Innovation that you -- is unbelievable. I don\u2019t know if that interested you, but I want to\ntell you, the -- my math -- can I imagine I\u2019m studying architectural engineering, I\u2019m trying to\ncheat on math. I mean to tell you, it\u2019s mind boggling. But my professor of math, he liked me a\nlot. He took such a personal interest in me, that if I would ditch classes, he would take a Como\npaper and see what movie I\u2019d be hiding, and actually after classes, he would come in the movie,\ndig me out and give me a big speech, aren\u2019t you ashamed, your father is working on the bicycle\nselling the soap from one little town to the other so you can go to the school, and -- and he\nflunked me. And he tutor me the whole summer for free. You cannot be engineer if you don\u2019t\nknow the math. Til the last test. Now, we already know we have to leave for America, so we\nfigure out I\u2019m going to get at least the paper in order so I can continue in the States to get my\ndegree. And I know I can never do it, because I know it would be a very difficult test. So the\nfriend of mine who was really [indecipherable] in math, and we had at the same time a German\ntest, so he was Italian guy who di -- his father had a visual optical audio store. So I told you what\n-- tell you what I do. You help me to get me two hearing aids, and I will help you with the\nGerman test. So he brought me bunch of wire, I sit in the last row and I run a wire through my\nsleeve, through the steam pipe down in the basement, and I had a little mike in my hand, and my\nfa -- my friend down in the boiler room. So as soon as he wrote the -- our test on the blackboard,\nI wrote it -- you know, I -- I -- whispered to my friend down in the boiler room, it took him\nexactly 10 minutes to develop the test. And I was so delighted that I copied it, now is a problem\nto get out of this gizmo that I got. So I took a knife, I cut the wire -- because I was wired clear\ndown to the basement, and once you go ahead and -- and I was so excited that I send my --\ninstead of hanging to the paper and breaking my head, blah, blah, blah, I turn it to him. And then\nmy pr -- my fres -- my professor, and he looked at me, he says, \u201cZdenko, are you sure you\u2019re\ndone?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah I\u2019m done.\u201d He se -- he let me go. Rest of them took additional hours. Now\nca -- we come back to the class and he says, \u201cYou know, guys, I\u2019m embarrassed. You took one\nhour, two hours, here Mr. Bergl, 45 minutes. Now Mr. Bergl is a smart guy, he\u2019s going to come\nto the blackboard and show us how he done it.\u201d That\u2019s the end of the show. Flunked me. There\nwere made a -- make up exam in September, and one month later, was November we were on the\nway for America. But he -- he helped me enough to pass the test. Now fast forward 25 years\nlater, \u2019m coming to Como. I invite my professor for lunch with my father and my mother. Meet\nmy wife. And my professor tell me, he says, \u201cZdenko, I\u2019m teaching there for 45 years, I know\nthe kids cheat. Please, how did you do it?\u201d And then I told him.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: 25 years later he waited to tell him how I cheated. Now I come to the States, I couldn\u2019t start\nright away back to the school because I couldn\u2019t speak English, not one word. I enroll in the\nengli -- English classes through the Jewish social services, and then the army came, and my both\n-- both folks got sick, my mother and father, and they got the co -- help through the Red Cross,\nwith the commitment that when I come up from service we will pay it back. So when I come\nback, forget about the school, I had to go work because I had about -- in 1943, I had the 5,000\ndollar worth of debt.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: So [had to go back to work, and I -- I had to choose a profession, because I didn\u2019t want to go\nhave to work some manual labor or something. So somebody suggests why don\u2019t you go in some\nhigh technical field that is growing, heating and cooling. And then I went, join the labor union,\nand went on apprenticeship program, and I made a good living doing this, was very happy with\nit. And I never turn back to --",
        "Q: The school?",
        "A: -- the school because it took me too long -- now I was already 26 years old, so I wasn\u2019t about\nto go he -- back --",
        "Q: But I suppose in some ways we\u2019re all lucky that you didn\u2019t go back to school with all your\ncheating.",
        "A: Well, to me -- to -- to -- the fact it is that I was clever enough that I realized that you want to\nbecome a good -- you had to have a -- be good with the math.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I realized that I will never be good in math. I will do -- be good in lots of things, but\nmath is not my thing. So I said why should I be a bad architect?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: You know, because there\u2019s no future in it. But they should give you one funny thing -- in the\nsame school that I went in Como, I met lots of guys til the day that I had to depart for America.\nEight months ago I\u2019m reading on my internet Como paper every night. So somebody\u2019s writing\nsomething about American who went to Como, is [indecipherable] and some of them like it. And\nI write to the Como -- to -- to -- to the newspaper, I says, you know, I was raised in Como, I went\nto the school in Como, and to me to come to Europe and not to visit Como are like going to a\ncandy store and don\u2019t buy candy. And I signed my name. Next day I get a phone call from a guy\nwho graduate from the thing, become a very famous architect in Como. He told me, \u201cZdenko,\nyou were in school with me.\u201d And I was supposed to meet him this year, I was supposed to be\nmatter of fact, this month in Italy. It didn\u2019t work out because my wife caught pneumonia this\nwinter.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So we couldn\u2019t go. But the guy -- I didn\u2019t hear from him from 1949.",
        "Q: Amazing, isn\u2019t 1t?",
        "A: And -- and he read my name, he recognized right away --",

        "A: -- he say, you know who I am, says yes. He said, my name 1s Berlusconi, and -- and I have\nmy own company, my son is working with me. He said he\u2019s also graduate techni\n[indecipherable] school, and I have a little piccolo azinda. It\u2019s like a small enterprise that we are\nrunning, me and my son. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s funny.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a great story, hopefully you\u2019ll see him.",
        "A: Ju -- yeah. So it just show you --",
        "Q: Tell me about your meeting with Evelyn in Cinecitta.",
        "A: Cinecitta.",
        "Q: Cinecitta.",
        "A: Cinecitta.",
        "Q: Cinecitta.",
        "A: Well, every -- it was a little group [indecipherable] Jewish yentas. Now you know what\u2019s a\nyenta. She\u2019s going to probably come and ask me to spell yenta. That was my mother, Winkler\u2019s\nmother, Evie\u2019s mother, and all that, that in front of the building they were living is a little park\nwith the benches. So all those ladies in their leisure time, under these pine trees, they were\nobserving the traffic, who is coming, who is coming, who is waiting, who -- who 1s cheating on\nwho. They were like a executive committee. And Evie, of course was always -- her mother keep\na very close eye on her, where she is going. And I was hanging with Evie\u2019s brother, with this\nWinkler and all of them. And my only job in Cinecitta is make to Evie miserable. And we -- like\nwe went to a beach, and Evie\u2019s laying on the beach with clothes on. I went to kiss her, she went\nballistic. And I didn\u2019t kiss her in any romantic way, I just know that she\u2019s going to be pissed, and\nit worked. And you know, as long as we were in Cinecitta, I absolutely was romantic. Only later\nwhen Evie left for America, after I was already going to school in Como, and I never thought\nthat we are going to make a connection again. It happened purely accidentally because when we\narrive in New York, week before Thanksgiving, or few days before, of 1949, Evie said that -- I\ndon\u2019t know how she tell the story how we met. The fact it is the \u201cNew York Times,\u201d ran a\npicture of my family in the front page, like an [indecipherable] with the valise, cardboard valise,\nthe refugee for Naples, because most of refugee coming to New York were from Bremenhaven.\nWe were from Naples. So they have us there, it just purely accidental. And Evie\u2019s mother saw\nthe picture, and then she start calling Jewish services, and we didn\u2019t continue for Kansas City\nbecause my Uncle Radon was living already in New York. So we were his houseguests for two\nweeks. And as soon as she find out that we are living in Manhattan, Heinz, Evie\u2019s brother come\nto pick us up and the first Thanksgiving in America, we passed it with Evie and his family. And\nthen I went to the army. Now, when I went to the army, and I didn\u2019t keep in touch with them -- I\nvisited them occasionally, New York with her brother, but nothing, nothing, nothing to do with\nEvie. When I was drafted, like year and half later, and I\u2019m in Fort Lee, Virginia, in the desert\ntraining, every weekend we go -- jumped 1n the car -- matter of fact, you know, in army post you\nhave this Saturday morning parade, and I figure a way how to beat this parade. Was a Brooklyn\nJewish kid, his name was Marda from Brooklyn, he had the car. So Marda we go to Brooklyn, I\nget a ride, he says, you get a ride if you go to the first sergeant and you get a pass for me. And I\ncome very good with the first sergeant, he -- he -- his name was Ara Bernasconi. Italian guy. So I\nwas kind of -- got thick with him, and I didn\u2019t have no problem getting passes. Problem it was\nget out of the parade Saturday morning so you could not leave til noon. And if you leave\nSaturday noon for New York, Saturday\u2019s gone. So I started a limp -- you know, during the -- I\ndon\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with the parade, it\u2019s so funny. When you go in front of the review\nstand and the guy say, eyes right, so everybody start eyes right, and you do too, I start limping.\nSo I broke the whole cadence, can you imagine? All the guys going the step, I start limping. So\nthe viewing general told the camp commander, so he said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s kid is sick, why you make him\nmarch?\u201d So he talked to my first sergeant. He said, \u201cOkay, sir, I will fix it up, I\u2019m not going to\nlet him march no more.\u201d I was out. You know?",
        "Q: So you -- so you didn\u2019t?",
        "A: Ah, yeah. And -- and I took Martin with me. So he had the car and we went every Saturday,\nalready seven o\u2019clock we were on the way to New York, through the New Jersey turnpike, wump\n-- you didn\u2019t have all the roads you have now, and it was ea -- we had to go through downtown\nWashington.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But was no problem at that time to get it.",
        "Q: So were you spending time with Heinz and then s --",
        "A: Oh, straight to -- I was more time at Evie\u2019s house than mine. Then I discover, hey this girl is\nnot bad, you know? And maybe while I had a girlfriend that I left in Italy, not that I was\nromantically involved. I was hanging out with her brother, and her mother was figure it out that\nwe would be a good match. And where I was stationed -- well, I\u2019m trying to fast forward that, I\ndon\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to get ahead myself. Evie was not interested in me, I was more\ninterested in Evie at this point. She had -- a matter of fact had a boyfriend [indecipherable]. And\nthen I had to leave. I didn\u2019t -- they send me oversea.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And in that period that I was oversea, I didn\u2019t have no contact with Evie, I didn --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t write to her?",
        "A: No, no. I -- very little contact with her brother, but -- and my friend Winkler was already in\nthe States living in Kansas City. And still I didn\u2019t come back. And soon as I come back I went --\nthere was Christmas 1943, her brother invited me for a New Year\u2019s Eve party.",
        "Q: You mean \u00b053.",
        "A: \u201953, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So I went from -- from Kansas City for New Year\u2019s Eve party, and I discover a even more\nprettier Evie. And I start giving her hard time, and try to courting, you know, la -- was a very\nhard thing going because she was not interested in me, I think she was more interest give me a\nhard time. But her mom was interested in me, and her brother was delighted. And then finally\nwent back to Kansas City, and I said, look, it\u2019s a very long distance relationship. So I start flying\nevery two weeks, TWA from Kansas City to New York. That time you had to fly by the way of\nChicago, and they had the constellation propeller plane.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: So it took you six hours. And then I -- I rushed from work, I arrived in New York\nInternational, her brother pick me up. She is watching Brooklyn Dodgers, doesn\u2019t even say hello.\nShe ignored [indecipherable] not only she didn\u2019t pick me up. I said what the hell I\u2019m doing here?\nAnd she -- I talk to [indecipherable] Carl Furillo and Roy Campanella, I -- I remember a few of\nthose names from the Brooklyn Dodgers.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She was such a baseball fan. Right now she couldn\u2019t care less, but that time she was a big fan\n[indecipherable]. But I was doing it on every two week basis, and that become very expensive. I\nwas in the hock in a matter of six months to TWA something like 3500 bucks. 1953.",
        "Q: And your intention was to see her --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and her intention was to --",
        "A: Her intention to avoid me. And I wou -- then finally when she upse -- accepted to marry me, I\nsaid we will do it down the line like 12 months, another year or some [indecipherable] two years.\nAnd I told her, you know, that will not work. You can stretch it as long as you want, but I cannot\nfly [indecipherable] to New York. And when she be -- we fast forward what that we got married\nthe following Fourth of July. And that\u2019s year -- that was the end of the picnic for Evie, then she\ngot stuck.",
        "Q: So did you just wear her down?",
        "A: I think I did to a certain point wear her down, yes. But you know what the funny thing is the -\n- when I was in Japan, and I was thinking of her because when I was [indecipherable] in\nVirginia, she was looking pretty good to me. At a certain point I write to her and say, you know,\nI would like to have with you a little more meaningful relationship. And if you keep putting off,\nyou don\u2019t have to -- I don\u2019t care. I got a different girlfriend in Italy. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: What do you think was her a-answer?",
        "Q: Go ahead, marry her.",
        "A: That\u2019s what she said. The funny part it is that we were married already three, four years, and I\nhave the picture of Italian girl in a kimono that I send her from Tokyo. And I have it in a frame\nbehind Evie picture, Evie is in the front. And she 1s living with me now already three years.",
        "Q: And she doesn\u2019t [indecipherable]",
        "A: And she doesn\u2019t know the gir -- til one day she was cleaning and dusting the picture. When\nshe found that picture behind hers, sh -- oh, that was -- I think that was the biggest fight I had\nwith her since our marriage. Really, really upset.",
        "Q: Did you remember that that picture was there?",
        "A: No, completely forgot.",
        "Q: You forgot?",
        "A: Completely forgot. Completely. But that\u2019s one of the -- you know, one th -- one of the\nepisode.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But the friendship that we develop in this group, like Winkler that I mention several time, and\nhis brother-in-law that was running the kitchen, we become such a tight group that it continue.\nBecause Winkler start working for Joint in Rome.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And we become like Elkia Eliskovich, which was general manager of Joint for Rome in Italy,\nwhich was picked up by the office in Paris, which was running whole refugee thing in Europe.\nShe liked Winkler, and she put him under her wing. She didn\u2019t know how young was the\nWinkler, but after awhile -- now I\u2019m -- I\u2019m already in Como -- and she said, \u201cYou know, Henry,\nI\u2019m go o -- I need to open office in Milan. How would you like to run my office in Milan?\u201d And\nWinkler figure I\u2019m in Como, you got a deal. And within two months Winkler and the whole\nfamily was in Como with us. And he was commuting every day to Milan.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And he is the guy who put us, you know, to go -- when the all papers come, were supposed to\ncome, he\u2019s -- I wanted to go the same place where he goes. So Winkler was -- drawed the\n[indecipherable] Kansas City. And we couldn\u2019t switch it, so we -- we both agreed to Kansas City\nand then Winkler father got sick, he couldn\u2019t leave with us at the same time. And then I brought\nhim back. I send him papers and the money to come to America in 1952, before I went to the\narmy.",
        "Q: Before you went to the army, yeah. When -- when you discovered after the war, the extent of\nthe brutality and the murder in Europe, was that -- that must have been shocking to you.",
        "A: Yes. We know that was lots of people dying, but th-the horror of the way those people were\ndeported, the -- wi -- nobody knew exactly what was going [indecipherable] war but not\ncompletely going. The thing only come out when I start meeting lots of those people who\nsurvived the camps, and their story, more than the press.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Even told the \u201cStars and Stripes,\u201d -- that was an army newspaper, they didn\u2019t co -- didn\u2019t hide\nit, they really brought the atrocity the way they were. And then yes, we were all surprised,\nbecause we couldn\u2019t believe such inhuman -- inhumanity is possible. We didn\u2019t know what\nhappened in Jasenovac.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- til after the war. We know that people got killed, but the way, I mean, not-- Croatia Nazi\nwere worse than the German Nazis. I mean, they were absolutely inhumanely vicious. Dying\nevery -- you know, you are dead, you\u2019re dead, but those guys what they done, the way they killed\nthe people is absolutely horrendous what they done.",
        "Q: Yeah. And when it -- when you thought about that, there you were living, it sounds like, a\nvery privileged, protected life --",
        "A: No question about it.",
        "Q: -- in Italy.",
        "A: No question.",
        "Q: And here -- if you had se --",
        "A: You -- the -- it cou -- would -- would boggle our mind that something possible like this to\nhappen. Even Italians -- even Italian Fascists -- Fascists, hard core Fascists couldn\u2019t believe it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: If you were not in it, you know, when German -- I believe that the German, as overall, didn\u2019t\nknow what was going in camp, to the extent that it happened. They know they were killing Jews.\nAnd they know there were camps there, even they said they didn\u2019t know. But nobody can\nimagine what is happening.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Nobody, because they ca -- they the -- at least -- at least [indecipherable] there were Jews in\ncharge of extermination of Jews. This is special group of people.",
        "Q: Do you consider yourself a survivor?",
        "A: I -- I -- I think -- I don\u2019t [indecipherable] concept to put it. Yes, I\u2019m definitely a survivor,\nprivileged survivor.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: No question about it. When I hear what happened to other people -- we had it so many close\ncalls it was really mind-boggling how come we didn't fall in the trappies of this phone call -- 1 --\nof this close call that we had. But the way I lived, the way we survived, the privileges we had.\nThe shower, warm water, food. I mean, come on --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- I mean, when I hear about the -- Evie in the caves, just few miles down the road from me,\nwhere I was leading relatively good, dangerous but good and safe -- not safe, comfortable life,\nthen you know, it\u2019s terrible thing what she went through it as a young kid.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I\u2019m never -- you know, I was never to exposed it. Not -- you know, it\u2019s a different thing\neating and eating good. And we were eating good. I mean, you know --",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t just surviving.",
        "A: No, we were not just surviving, by all means. So -- and I become such a [indecipherable]\nItalian, on a general thing, because you got a good people, a bad people in any group. But the\nItalian always -- 1-in the majority, as a people, they\u2019re unbelievable people. Italians jealous, they\nenvious people. Like if you were very wealthy in Italy, they could be jealous about your wealth.\nYou don\u2019t have nothing --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- they will give you the shirts off their back. Now you will find occasionally somebody,\nItalians are always worrying, they\u2019re always hoarding because they never think is enough. What\nhappened to Evie, when those farmer, they would like to give her food, but they figure maybe\ntomorrow they will need it, because they are not sure.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Not that they want to see her hungry, but that\u2019s how some Italian -- sometimes the Italians\nwork. Is not always even handed.",
        "Q: Right. We need to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about your parents. Did they get sick right when you went to Korea, or 1s\nthis before?",
        "A: That the only time that my father -- oh e -- oh, excuse me, you\u2019re talking about sick.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: My father got sick while I was in Korea.",
        "Q: And they both got sick at the same time?",
        "A: Yeah, m-my mother had the acute pancreitis and my father heart attack.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And my mother was fighting this cute -- acute pancreitis til the day she died. A matter of fact,\nI remember that a physician come and told us -- I almost knocked him right on his tutu -- tell me\n-- she goes tell my father -- h-he did, he said, \u201cYou know, she got maybe two, three days left.\u201d\nShe lived til she was 96.",
        "Q: Ninet -- 96 years old, she was --",
        "A: Yeah. And I say, how can you tell the heart patient --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: You see, what happened that the regular family doctor was not available. He was on a\nvacation. He was the guy who operate on her, her surgeon [indecipherable]. So the only one\navailable in Menora Hospital in Kansas City to see her, was him. But you figure he\u2019s a surgeon,\nhe should know enough about the pancreas, blah, blah. So he told her what a critical thing he did.\nAnd she use pancreatinis medicine on a regular basis, she didn\u2019t have no problem with it. So\nthat\u2019s the period, yeah, they happen -- they were sick while I was in the army --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and the -- now don\u2019t forget, once I got United States army, Joint -- Jewish welfare was\nthrough giving you support. They were obliged for five years, but once the army took over, then\nit\u2019s the Red Cross duty.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: The Red -- yeah, Red Cross is a back-up for American service, for all the branches of service.\nSo Jewish welfare didn\u2019t do nothing to -- with them no more. Then the Red Cross come in there.",
        "Q: And they helped your parents?",
        "A: Yeah. They di -- supported them til I didn -- come home. But they told me ahead that they\nwas going to expect to me at one point --",
        "Q: To pay it back.",
        "A: -- to go pay it back. They don\u2019t make any timetable, but said, you know, they helping other\npeople, whatever you give us back is going to help somebody out tomorrow. And we felt morally\nobligated to return this money.",
        "Q: Right, sure.",
        "A: And I figure longer I wait, harder it is going to be, so I figure I\u2019m going to get a good job.\nAnd I -- that -- so I picked up --",
        "Q: And that\u2019s when you went to --",
        "A: -- yeah, go in the trade, and I paid it off quite -- relatively quite fast, I paid him back within\nthree years.",
        "Q: Wow. And your father, did he maintain his health after that first heart attack?",
        "A: My father lived in -- he lived, God bless him, he had a two heart attack, he had a cancer\nsurgery and -- a-and after the surgery, he live additional 12 years.",
        "Q: Hm. And your mother lived much longer.",
        "A: My mother, yeah.",
        "Q: So you were all living together?",
        "A: We were living -- we -- I never left my p -- when -- when -- when the Nazi come to Zabno,\nmy aunt married to the doctor told my family, listen, I\u2019m protected, I\u2019m not worry. Leave\nZdenko with me. I would never left my parents for one single second. And I never said -- even\nthrough all the time I was married, that my parents live with me. I always give them the courage,\nthe honor, to say I\u2019m living with them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I give my credit to my wife. It is not easy to go ahead and live with mother-in-law as\nmany years she does. But my wife was very smart. For loss of the privacy, she ha -- got a butler\nand a cook. We left for the morning -- in the morning, we didn\u2019t make the bed, we didn\u2019t have to\nworry what is for supper. We know we are cu -- we went in a gourmet restaurant every day til\nthey were able to cook and take care of us. We didn\u2019t shop for grocery. My father does the --\neverything. If he had any wishes, if I would say listen, Mother, make me Punschtorte -- you\nknow what\u2019s a Punschtorte?",
        "Q: No.",

        "Q: So you do --",
        "A: Pish -- n-not only -- or Cremeschnitten, which are Napoleon. I mean, she was famous for it.\nThat\u2019s how she got job in the American. And she was still -- she cooked -- she died 96, but she\nwas still active in kitchen at 92.",
        "Q: No kidding?",
        "A: Yeah. So that was a payback for loss of the privacy.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Thank God our house was big enough. So, you were -- enough space.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But why my -- my wife is so brilliant that she made a mental rule, never be in kitchen\ntogether with my mother.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And when my mother was not capable no more to cook in, my wife took over cooking. She\nwas sitting in her Lazy Boy chair and observing in the kitchen, every move, to the point that Evie\ngot so upset that she closed the door, because her eyes were following every step she went.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then we had a -- as other -- as a pay -- payoff for me not going to live in New York, that\nher parents came at least twice a year. And I loved to have them, because when I -- those two\ncooks together, what I would tell my mother I would like to have a germtike cooking. You know\nwhat a germtike?",
        "Q: Mm-mm.",
        "A: That\u2019s a -- germ is a yeast.",

        "A: I like a yeast sweet, made with yeast.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And my mom -- my mother-in-law had a -- when she made something with chocolate, you\nknow you are a chocolate eater. My mother would put [indecipherable] in chocolate --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- in yeast. My mother -- when you eat, 1t was dripping on you. So I made them compete\nagainst each other, I was sitting back there and laughing. Was fantastic.",
        "Q: But that\u2019s an unusual set-up that you --",
        "A: Very unusual set-up, and it worked. I used to fight with my mother-in-law that you would not\nbelieve it, because my mother-in-law was a very strong willed person. But she was not grudge\nholding person. I could have a big screaming match and [indecipherable] said, \u201cMa, I\u2019m ready to\ngo out, you ready?\u201d In five minutes she\u2019s in the car with me. She loved to go in the car. Five\nminutes, all the argument, forget it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I loved her. She was really a remarkable woman. I -- I really loved her [indecipherable].\nAnd she would bring, you know, my nephews, with her --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- when we could not afford yet for them to fly, they would come with the Greyhound bus\nwith two kids. It\u2019s a long schlep. It is a long, believe me, but she would faithfully they would\ncome to Kansas City to visit. I mean, the kids loved it, and I loved to have them, it was really -- it\nwas very interesting arrangement, you know.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When did you retire?",
        "A: I retired about 12 years ago. But the -- to the -- you want me to tell you about the story about\nmy car.",
        "Q: Yeah, I will, but wait a second.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Before --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: When -- have you -- did you at one point decide that you would talk to kids about the\nHolocaust or not?",
        "A: To -- to my nephews, you mean?",
        "Q: Well, either to your nephews, or to schoolchildren?",
        "A: No, I -- I never discussed the Holocaust with them, and I\u2019Il tell you exactly why. We had so\nmany volunteer Polish that liked to talk about Holocaust, and we -- and I got some of friends\nwhich are Hungarians, and I know that the Hungarian Jews know very little about Holocaust.\nBecause when most of Jews who were dead, Hungarian were still in Budapest til 1945. So they\ncome on too late. It is true they paid a dear price, because Hitler had to get rid of them very fast.\nNow, the other Jews, if they young and strong, they had a chance to work in the camp, or some\nlabor. But Hungarian Jews, he was trying to kill them fast as he can because Hitler was running\nout of time. But when those Hungarian Jews who didn\u2019t go to the camp was pick up by the\nHolocaust -- Holocaust, and explained the horror of it, and didn\u2019t experience it, they are\nhypocrite. So I felt if I would go try to go ahead, how can I compare my suffering with those\npeople who come from Poland, so -- from other country, they already -- or Austria? So, it was\nnot my place to speak there. I was invited, as a matter of fact, to speak to a Jewish retire group\nnext month on 14, which are doctors and the engineers and lawyers in Kansas City, about again,\nsurvival in Italy, the Italian Alp. But that\u2019s a different chapter, because they were never -- they\nnever any -- any idea. But I would never be presumptuous enough to explain the horror of the\ncamp, because I were not there.",
        "Q: No, no, I -- I al -- I meant, would you -- were you asked to talk about Italy?",
        "A: Nobody --",
        "Q: I mean most people don\u2019t even think about Italy, right?",
        "A: No, no, nobody.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: This is what be -- upset me more than you can believe. They buried this fact, all they know\nMussolini, and the Fascist, and r -- and that\u2019s all they know. It is so much behind the surface, that\nis not fair to Italians per se, as a whole, you know, because you cannot -- you don\u2019t have a --\nyou\u2019ve got bad Jews, too, you\u2019ve got Jews who were putting other Jews in the [indecipherable]\nin the -- in the -- in the crematory. So -- but you cannot make generalize. You know, you got\nexception to every situation. I don\u2019t think the guy was shoveling body in the -- 1-in the damn h-\nhigh temperature to be burned, that he done it because he hate the Jews, he was trying to survive.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So h-he -- is all depend from what perception and what concept you are looking at it. But I\ndid -- they did ask me to speak to schoolchildren, and -- and is very interesting, and I can tell\nyou, Kansas City, I\u2019m very proud to have invitation all over. And all the right religious group,\nthey make sure that Holocaust is not forgotten. It is amazing. Right now in Kansas City we have\na third generation of Holocaust survivors speaking about it. We have -- those guys something in\ncommon with me, they were not the camp, either. But they were privileged to say my\ngrandfather. I don\u2019t have that. See, except for my -- one of my mother brothers, who got caught\nin Split, like I told you [indecipherable]",

        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: So he was alone.",
        "A: He was -- when the war finished, the only Berg] is left alive. And there were four brothers, no\nsisters, four brothers. Remarkable thing it is, by the Jewish community where I have 1-in Croatia,\nthat there were very few Jews in comparison to other countries. But th -- all very successful\nJews. I would say is, in Croatia that 80 percent of Jews were self-employed in some kind of\nbusiness, along with 20 percent working for somebody, or for some enterprise. And then a -- in\nmost of community, wherever they live, th-the excellent relationship with Jews. It was not an\nanimosity like Poland that when you go in front of church you went pah, pah, pah. That didn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] but it -- it was a very, very tight relationship, right through the whole country,\neven Bosnia. Now, you had some Jews here [indecipherable] you have in -- do you have them\nhere too?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You have a Jewish [indecipherable] in Israel. But as a whole that we could really feel? No,\nno, no.",
        "Q: Right. Were you --",
        "A: You know --",
        "Q: Yeah [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- excuse me, I want to tell you something which 1s amazing.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: And is a compliment to the Jewish race. From 1947, through 1955, now I\u2019m -- I\u2019m giving you\nthis window because 1955 include Hungarian revolution, when Hungarian Jews start coming to\nUnited States. In this period in Kansas City come 270 families. From hodgepodge of all the\ncountries. Almost all of them were self-employed. I wouldn\u2019t say more than 15 percent was in\ngroup like me, working or learning -- but not big enterprise, some more, some less. Some of\nthem immensely successful. But what I\u2019m trying to bring a point about the welfare. We all went\nto the school from first day we arrive, to learn English, working at nighttime. I restrain from any\ngroup coming in the United States want to change the system, or improve the different language\nin our educational system. I don\u2019t care from what country you come. If you want to preserve\nyour heritage, f-fine. You want to teach your kids so they are bilingual, fantastic. But don\u2019t mess\naround with a system that works. That\u2019s why we went to this school. And sa -- same Jews now,\nthey were they -- they were -- you know, I had th -- have the blessing of advanced learning,\neducation, faculty and all of them. Most Jews in Kansas City, they were so illiterate, and so\nJewish oriented, if they picked up \u201cKansas City Star\u201d in their hand, it didn\u2019t have a picture, they\nwill hold it upside down. Can I tell you more than that? Only Hebrew. And yet, every one of\ntheir kids is college graduate. From surgeons to doctor to engineers, to professional -- is absol --\nmind-boggling. So it is a land of opportunity. Those pi -- you know, those parents are so ignorant\nin comparison to their kids and grandchildren, is mind-boggling. But they were willing to work. I\ndon\u2019t care what work they performed. They were very, very successful what they were doing.\nNever on welfare. I don\u2019t know a single Jewish in Kansas City that\u2019s went on welfare. They\naccepted from Jewish community to get started only, but every one of them was very anxious to\ngo on. I don\u2019t know anybody who did not send their kids to college. I never see -- every si --\nevery one of our friends, the kids have. And some of them from prestigious universities. So it is\nsomething in willingness to work. Jews are not lazy people. And they have a hump to pick up\nand go from nothing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, even to this day, when I socialize with my friends, and I know they are much\nsmarter than they are. I mean, bias to show how much smarter I am than they are. Instead of\nbringing them down, I bring myself, lots of times to their level. I\u2019m more comfortable with it.\nAnd -- and sometime when I say something tremendously stupid, I don\u2019t want to make them feel\nthat way. I try to explain as gently as possible where they making a mistake.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I\u2019m very proud of my heritage where I am, and I cannot emphasize enough. I\u2019m not a\nvery religious person, I\u2019m not a very observant person, belong to a shul. We don\u2019t go there\n[indecipherable] not even [indecipherable] imagination as much as the shul. But we, you know,\nwith the Jewish holiday, we try to be part of it, we observe the Jewish holiday, always someplace\nfor New Year\u2019s Eve, or the other Jewish holidays. But heritage is very important. And I -- I -- I\ntell you, Evie had lots to do with it, because she come from Vienna, from different, much more\nJewish surrounding than I do. I was dabbling so much -- that\u2019s why I had such a close\nrelationship with my Gentile friend in Croatia. It was beautiful. You know, when they write to\nme for holidays, send us matches. I\u2019m sending matches all over Croatia, they love it. When the --\nwhen is a -- they don\u2019t know when holy day, when is the matches season?",
        "Q: Right. You wanted to tell us a story about bringing your Cadillac to Croatia.",

I said\none day I\u2019m going to come back and show these people the Berg] family still got something. So\nas soon -- when I go -- bought my first car, and a -- I left in 1941, and didn\u2019t return til \u201972. 31\nyears pass. And I say I have to make a big entrance when I come. I did some still\n[indecipherable] ship\u2019s traffic between New York. I had a friend who might drive my car in New\nYork, I -- my f -- parents loved to travel by ship. So they took a car with them on the ship, me\nand Evie, we flew to Genoa. We sit down in the car, I put American flag on my antenna, and I\ndrive in my hometown. Within 10 minutes the word spread, Jew is back.",
        "Q: Jew is back?",
        "A: Yeah, Jew is b -- not in a derogatory manner, you mean -- s-so they come to us, says listen,\nwe took everything away from you, you didn\u2019t have nothing. How did you do it? So I said listen,\nit\u2019s very simple. We apply to go to America. Once we arrived in New York, the Jewish\ncommittee from New York waited for us. Give us a key from the car, give us a key for the house\n[indecipherable] is in the book. They says, here with us, you\u2019re welcome to America. And the\nguy say, you kidding. I said, no, it\u2019s very simple, all you have to be Jewish, hand you everything.\nJews are waiting for you with -- to give you stuff. And the guy -- those farmer were just shaking\ntheir head. Should I tell them they arrive in America sweeping floor? Would that impress him?\nNo. And I wanted to do the impact, and it worked. And they bought it. They actually believed it.",
        "Q: Did you ever tell them that wasn\u2019t true?",
        "A: Never te -- never told them. Well, later on they could s -- draw their own conclusion through\nthe years, because I came many times back, with a little later on confusion because I didn\u2019t take\nmy car, but I rented the car, one time a Mercedes, one time a Volvo. So I come there all different\ncars in -- you know, when I came to my hometown. But this first -- I wanted to make a splash the\nfirst time I came.",
        "Q: Well, you certainly made one.",

        "Q: This was a Cadillac in 1972?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And where did you put the flag, in the front?",

        "A: Because original Mussolini, he had the agreement with Schuschnigg that if Hitler attack\nAustria, he is going to defend Austria. And he\u2019s a chick -- hit -- and Mussolini chickened out. He\nfigured, hey, that guys is stronger, I\u2019m not going to go with my head against the wall. And they\ngot involved in this thing. But that got Nazi in the war, it concern us as a Jewish, as a salvation.\nIf you notice, every Jew entering that passport Italy didn't stamp it. He didn\u2019t want any record\nhow many Jew he let in Italy.",
        "A: Like when my wife was in the concentration camp, this was like -- first [indecipherable] to go\nhelp him that some Jews are th -- I have a concentration camp. But this concentration in\nFerramonti di Tarsia was a joke. Now, I have a friend who will live in Tarsia, and he was telling\nme story, and I unfortunately don\u2019t have his picture, Italian guard around there, there was little\nbooth where they stayed and guard, but they couldn\u2019t stay there because was -- the little grocery\nstore, with the cigarettes and the fruit and the candy. So even if it\u2019s raining, they just stay in front\nof booths, they\u2019re doing business with the people in the camp. So you come to the fence, and you\ntell the -- ah, Jojo, come here. He say, what you need? Two pack of cigarette.",
        "A: So, you know. And even in the life in the camp in itself is much completely different life\nbecause they, you know, nobody worry about the life. There were so many engineers, doctors,\nlike Evie told you, when she hurts her finger, everybody come running. That was cream de la\ncream of Vienna, mostly Vienna, in [indecipherable]. Now -- now I\u2019m going back to Yugoslavia\nand Croatia. Croatia didn\u2019t have an organized Jewish community when j -- Viennese Jews start\ncoming Croatia. So what the Croatian community in its -- in itself done -- because you have to\nremember, whole Yugoslavia had 60,000 Jews. That the more Jews in one little town in Poland,\nthe whole damn country of Croatia had -- yugo -- not Croatia, Yugoslavia. Now, Croatia would\nhave approximately 12,000 Jews, more or less. So wealthy Jews in Croatia, being they were not\norganized, each one took a family in the house for boarding and sleeping.",
        "A: From Vienna.",
        "A: Yeah. I\u2019m talking 1938 - \u00b039. Now mine uncle [indecipherable] in business, and he couldn\u2019t\nbabysit or take care of the people in the house. He took a little hotel in Zagreb called Hotel\nAstoria, and -- and there were 22 rooms, and he put 22 Jewish family in that hotel for duration,\nfood and everything included.",
        "A: On his own, without anything to do with the community. What those poor people didn\u2019t\nrealize, that this hotel was taken lease in 1939, and the [indecipherable] lasted only til Easter of\n1941, they had to run again. So the people who choose Italy, they made a better choice.",
        "A: I just want to tell you --",
        "A: -- amechanic behind the Croatian Jews help the Viennese Jews. Some Viennese Jews made it\nto Belgrade. Now Belgrade Serbia had a much bigger Jewish community. And Serbian people as\na overall, were less anti-Semitic --",
        "A: -- because King Alexander was a big friend of Jews. You -- you -- you -- I\u2019m sure you know\nwho I am talking about. King of Serbia, of Yugoslavia.",
        "A: And King Staff, you know, Dr. Alkali and all these minister were mostly Jewish. So the Jews\nhad it pretty darn good from the day that Yugoslavia -- inception of Yugoslavia, til the\nYugoslavia fell apart in the whole country.",
        "A: I -- | -- I -- I brought up in this little community that I know that was anti-Semitism because\nyou always had -- you have it every place. If you don\u2019t have a community that\u2019s anti-Semitic -- I\nmean, I can see -- I felt 1t which 1s there, but not to the extent to be threatened.",
        "A: A matter of fact, the kids I went to the school is right now one of them is a surgeon who just\nretired in Zagreb, Croatia, every time I go over there I\u2019m his houseguest.

I\u2019m in -- with him in touch all the time. So I\nkeep in touch with few of them that they remain our friend, even that we couldn\u2019t -- but when\nthey came -- when we couldn\u2019t during the war. But when we come to run, the saddest part it is --\nand I\u2019m know that you\u2019ll be interested in this, when the Nazi come in, they confiscated our\nproperty, they come in April, by na -- by June all our property gone, grocery store, factory and\nall that.",
        "A: They send so-called supervisor to run -- they were totally inept. I mean, to -- one -- they sold\nwhat was on stock, they were 1 -- in heap of trouble. But to punish my father, first they send him\non a false labor in a old orchards. They had the big orchard with 4,000 trees of fruits. So all town\ncould see the Jews is coming over there, cleaning the veets and all that. And when this got old --\nand my mother was working with him, too -- then took my father to the -- ready to ship into\nconcentration camp. And they took him to Zagreb where -- to be shipped to the infamous camp\nof Jasenovac, okay?

So she call him.\nHis name was Medwid. And he told Medwid, listen, what the hell happen, I thought that you\nlove us. He said, I still love you, but that\u2019s [indecipherable] my job for me. I -- I believe in a free\nCroatia. I didn\u2019t believe the Serb that should dominate [indecipherable] okay then, I don\u2019t want\nto talk politics, I have a problem. My brother-in-law is in Zbore where they put the -- sending\npeople. Said, don\u2019t worry, I take care of it. So he say okay, tomorrow morning he 1s going to be\nout, have his family from Zabno, from my hometown come, I\u2019m gonna give them papers so they\ncan go in there to Italian border, and then clandestine over the mountain crossing with Italy, you\ncouldn\u2019t just legally cross to Italy, because that\u2019s already \u201941.

Everything disappeared in 1938. I used to like to have a little lead soldiers, I mean the\nwhole army, in trucks and all the stuff. It was not allowed in our hou -- any part to our family,\nnot even family that was bringing me toys. So the -- we did -- we were very much aware what\nwas going on. Unfortunately, didn\u2019t do nothing about it, they still kept s-same -- do business in --\nin Yugoslavia, but we knew what was going on.",
        "A: It made me feel bad to the point because we\u2019|l -- my dad, especially, he was very fearful, he --\nhe always wanted to get out of it for so -- like I told you before. So \u2019ve become very\nuncomfortable because my dad could not expand his business, he was holding back, while his\nbrother-in-law, my mother\u2019s wealthy brother, he was increasing it. Now, when it was time to go\nahead and run, and pick our marble and go, he started building a f -- mill, steel mill, steel, now\nlisten.

        "A: I mean, when they used to come bless the home for the Christian holidays, I mean, the priest\nwent first to five Jewish houses. He collected more money than whole the rest of town. So you\nsee how [indecipherable] integrated with this community.",

They were so programmed, like the robotics today that you see. It\u2019s amazing. I mean, I\nthink they invented the robotic before their time. I mean, it is funny. A -- later on when we were\nalready liberated, I used to make fun of the damn S.S. because it\u2019s so funny. One of them is\ncoming, and you\u2019re hop, hop [indecipherable] hop, and everybody jump like a bunch of yoyos. I\nmean, I can see that later on when I was serving American army, I was laughing, said boy this\nGerman officer would die if he would come over here. He would try to run American army the\nway do that. But they were very [indecipherable]. Never question a order.

        "A: When you enter to the joint Italian an-annexed to Italy, like Ljubljana, you know, they\nconsider part of Italy, you have it made. So our job, after they finally get in a s-s -- half safety\nzone, an occupied zone, to get to annexed zone, this was a big thr -- because we know, if we\nreach Ljubljana, we are free.

Every head of the family got a five lira a day, wife got three lira a day, for each kids,\ntwo lira a day. So if you add it up, it was not enough for a fantastic life, but you would not be\nhungry. To give you idea how [indecipherable] to a real -- what, over 300 lira something. A rent\nwould cost you 120 lira a month, approximately in the little communities. The rest of it for your\nfood. So they give you enough money to survive.",

        "A: That was all the [indecipherable] by the Nazi. We got back everything but the last house\nwhere was -- what my dad built for us, and we will never get back because is post office in it, to\nthis day.",
        "A: We did get the other, and we sold it.",

        "A: Yeah. And he buried it in the house, in our house, he bury it in the house. Now, that was\n1941. In 19 -- we came to Kansas City, \u201949, in 1955 - 1955, a Croatian guy -- well, I -- you\nknow, it\u2019s so difficult tell you my story in a -- in right chronological order.",

        "A: The Jewish community just send us to Kansas City, and -- and my mother said, you know,\nKansas City, I think that one guy that work for us on our brick factory, he -- he got married and\nhe went to Kansas City. And his name was Nicola Rodina. I wonder if he\u2019s living in this town.\nNow he come before the war, first World War, to marry his sweetheart, then war happen, he\ncouldn\u2019t come back to America. So he and his sweetheart live -- and he worked for my\ngrandfather and my dad til the war was over, and then after the war, around 1930, went back to\nKansas City, where he started. And he was working -- you know, Kansas City was third biggest\ncity for meat packing house, and you had the Swift, [indecipherable] Armour, all of them were in\nKansas City. So they were working because didn\u2019t need much language to be a butcher. So\nMother go over there, pick up in the telephone book [indecipherable] Rodina. And he had a son\nabout my age, and we [indecipherable] right away, and we become friend. But in 1955, this Nic\nRodina that used to work for us, goes back to Croatia for first time. And my father said, \u201cNic,\nyou want to do me a favor. In my house,\u201d and he write him -- make him a sketch of -- a\nschematic.",
        "A: \u201cIn this part I buried all of our silverware. Take a shovel, see what the hell is there.\u201d He take a\nshovel, the first time he pushed it -- because our basement by the way, it was no concrete.\nBasements are dirt.",
        "A: The first time he push a shovel in, it hit the metal box with the stuff. The first. Took him\nexactly 10 seconds to hit a spot. Right on the money. He brought all the silver. Now whatever\nwas silver was okay, but we discovered the handles, you know what I mean, it was not silver.\nKnife, and blade and the stem was silver.",
        "A: So when you brought everything -- spoons were no problem, forks were no problem.",
        "A: I\u2019m talking knife. So when he brought it to Kansas City we had the new stems put with the --\nI got -- the silver was there in Kansas City.",
        "A: -- silver yes, but [indecipherable]. So silver didn\u2019t rot, but whatever it was not --",
        "A: -- what was not silver, it rot. That was just like a little postscript to -- to the story.",
        "A: No, it wa -- I -- to me it was very clear why I was going, you know, when -- when we first\narrived and were confined in this little community of -- of si -- Concordia Santa Catarina, which\nis, you know -- Modena is a breadbasket of Italy. Wheat, grain, fruit, you name it. So they told us\nright away in -- Italian police in Ljubljana, they say hey, you guys, you got it made.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t.",
        "A: We came over there -- my dad come over there to police department. [indecipherable] say, we\nare going to send you to Italy, insi -- inside Italy, and you\u2019ll be confined to a little community.",
        "A: And they gave a whole bunch regulation, you cannot socialize with Italians, you cannot work\nover there. You have to report to the f -- fascio. This the Fascist head police once a day, head of\nthe family, so we know that you are in the town. They\u2019re not going to look for you, you better\nshow up there. And give us all these rules. And that -- that was not difficult to f -- to -- to follow.\nBut the Italian [indecipherable] people. I mean, I cannot find the words to describe my love for\nItalian, because when we arrived to the -- in Modena, and we went to questura, which is a police\nheadquarters, which in Fascist Italy -- and I\u2019m not talking regular police, I\u2019m talking Fascist\nItaly. Italian everything they do they have their own political version. Even Italian communists\ngo to church. I\u2019m telling you how ridiculous it is. The red shirts and the flag in the church at the\nconfession. So they -- they modified the -- the convenient. So we go to this questura and he tell\nus, now these are the community around here. Do you have any particular town that would you\nlike to be confined? And my father say I would like to go to a little town that is not expensive,\nand that there are nice food around. They says, I'll tell you where I\u2019m going to send you to\nConcordia sua Secchia. Secchia 1s a be -- river. Concordia on the ri -- on the Secchia river. He\nsays, fantastic bread, everything was rationed, the -- with the farmer really, your ration cards\nwould be superfluous even if you sh -- needed to go to the store, but farmer will supply whatever\nyou want over there and you can enjoy yourself. And he gave us all this rule that we go over\nthere. So when we trooped up to this lady, that she was divorced for a high ranking Italian\nofficer, she was living with a sister and a daughter. Daughter was about -- I was at that time\nalready fi 15, I think -- no, maybe 14 and a half, 15, she was 18. And so there she was looking,\noh my God, I -- she was in [indecipherable] in a sexy and all that. And then my family engaged\nher to teach me Italian. And my Uncle Pawel, and Ruza are already with us, in the same house\n[indecipherable] with them.",
        "A: Mitrani, yes.",
        "A: Andreoli Mitrani.",
        "A: Mitrani Andreoli.",
        "A: Mitrani is the woman married to the [indecipherable], Andreoli is the sister, because sister\nnever marry. So she keep the maiden name.",
        "A: You understand?",
        "A: The Italian officer was named Mitrani.",
        "A: And they had a daughter, Anna Maria, and she was teaching me Italian. And my uncle, he\nwas looking over there from the balcony when she was teaching me Italian. He says, \u201cYou know,\nZdenko, if you want to learn Italian -- I watch you from balcony, you have to stop staring at her\nbreasts. I mean, are you -- you are not paying one word of attention what the woman\u2019s teaching.\u201d\nI said, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m watching you from window [indecipherable].\u201d Said,\ndo you know any -- do you know anything what she told you? And I would ba-ba-ba, I start\n[indecipherable]. He was right.",
        "A: And that was the end of my staring. And he told her, he says, you know, you\u2019re a yu -- pretty\nyoung lady, and you want nephew to teach him Italian, dress up a little different. A young boy,\nhis hormones star -- start working, you know, make possible for him to concentrate what you are\ndoing. But was very funny, that -- that\u2019s a little --",
        "A: -- postscript into the whole story. But they took us in. Now, when --",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Nine months.",
        "A: Nine months, yes, we were hiding in a little town called Silvo, S-1-l-v-o. Real --",
        "A: Oh, yeah, this town was maybe 200 population. Is right between commune of Grobnik, that I\nmentioned before, and Shushak. Really a small town, but we -- we tried to be a -- you know, a --\na -- aS unseen as possible. So we found in a -- by -- old lady, you know, about 75 years old, she\nhad a room to rent. So my parents, they kind of crammed in there, and nobody in town know\nabout us, that we even there.",
        "A: We are hiding there because was Italian occupation there, but we\u2019re afraid if Italian get hold\nof us, they might turn us back to the Croatian Nazi because they hi -- they were sharing authority\nin that zone.",
        "A: There was not completely Italian authority.",
        "A: Well, when we were there we were aware that in order to reach a complete safety we have to\ngo in Italian zone, which is annexed.",
        "A: Not occupied.",
        "A: Quote unquote, there\u2019s a big difference annexed and occupied.",
        "A: And we know that because we\u2019ve still -- we still saw even that Italian had the final word.\nNow, if you were -- we got caught one time by Italians. See, is only [indecipherable] what Italian\ncatch you. One time they caught us, they were ready to ship us back to Zagreb and the -- and we\nwere begging, please don\u2019t send us, you know what\u2019s waiting for us. They guy say, you don\u2019t\nknow. So there were five Italian cops, and they were arguing between them, we couldn\u2019t\nunderstand. Little bit, not very much. They were dickering. One guys said, let them go, why the\nhell you playing around with them? And they said no we can\u2019t help it, our duty -- well, we are --\nwe allied of Germany. Send them back to Zagreb. So it\u2019s -- they said, you know what, let\u2019s make\na smart thing. So you want feel guilty that you didn\u2019t carry order and that I didn\u2019t carry order.\nLet\u2019s tell them that we go for lunch, and we be back in 30 minutes and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t --\nand I don\u2019t have to tell you how quick we [indecipherable]. But that\u2019s only happen in Italy. I\nmean, all the Italian with the stuff like they said, hey listen you guys, you are [indecipherable] in\nthe arrest but by the way we go for lunch, but don\u2019t go anyplace, we\u2019ll be back in 30 minutes.",
        "A: Very little.",
        "A: But -- no, but once I got in Italy, young, I couldn't go to school, so the only organized\nplayground is the church backyard. Everybody was there. I mean, they -- the movies, priest was\nshowing, you had the ping pong table, he had the basketball tab -- ev-everything what the kids in\nthis little town which we were confined, [indecipherable]. So I become, you know, with -- when\nyou are with the kids, you pick up Italian very fast. And for me is no problem to ge-get\nintegrated. A matter of fact, to a certain point, I got integrated little too much because my parents\nnoticed that I was going st -- sitting at the mass, and the one time they short of the kids, and the\npriest talked me into be -- helping serve the mass, and I come home, I could serve the mass better\nthan those Italian kids. Why? Because during the Hebrew school -- see, the -- the Testament, Old\nTestament is same. And the kids my age didn\u2019t get to New Testament yet. So what they knew, I\nalready was way ahead of them. And priest was very impressed with it. [indecipherable] told me,\nhow do you know, and he says -- I said we Jews didn\u2019t have to worry about New Testament. We\nworry only about the Old Testament. So he said, would you like to go over there and help serve\nthe mass? I said why not? What is in it for me? He says cakes and cookie and hot chocolate. I\u2019m\nin.",
        "A: Me and 2,000 other ones.",
        "A: 2,000 Jews. Even some Austrian Jews. Once you reach Ljubljana and you were Jewish, this is\nsuch a amazing thing about Fascist Italy. That they let you in, but they didn\u2019t want to know you\nwere there. Like remember in the previous segment when I told you that they give us list of do\nand don\u2019t do?",
        "A: Well, when we got over there with all these restriction, and my father\u2019s reports the first\nmorning to the -- to Fascist headquarters, said, here I am. Then he come next morning there. And\nfinally the third day the guy told him, \u201cWhy you bother me here every morning,\u201d he says. \u201cI\nknow you are here.\u201d He said, \u201cBut we supposed to,\u201d -- \u201cI know.

No American\nmovie, Italian -- Italy made lots of movies, lots of -- many of them propaganda movie and stories\nand -- and I was going to movie every sun -- when the -- owto -- if Fascist authorities saw me in\nthe movie, they wouldn\u2019t bother, they\u2019d turn around, they didn\u2019t want to see me.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No oppression.",
        "A: Because -- because Italian are flexible. That\u2019s a very good word to describe. Italian are\nopportunistic. Italian -- no, first time that we come to little town it says, oh, the Fascists told us\nthat you Jews were take -- taking eyes out of the kids and that\u2019s why you\u2019re confined. I said\nthat\u2019s a bubkes. That\u2019s not true. And th -- when they got acquainted with you, when they notice\non daily basis the way your people with a -- when they saw that we went, asked the farmer for\nbread, or to give us some flour, or to share us the flour, everything. We th -- it -- it was\nunbelievable, the response of the community, we feel so comfortable. Now we come to the -- the\nSeptember, or armistice, that we got so excited, and finally the war is over. At this point,\nAmericans already past Sicily, they landed on the boot of Italy, and on Calabria. And they\u2019re\nmarching their way the boot. And we are in Florence. That\u2019s like 450 miles down the boot. Lots\nof mountains. So we, a little educated, we knew what was expected that there\u2019s not going to be a\npancake, especially the German from the Brenner --",
        "A: -- were coming out. But when we had to run to go back when -- when the Italy collapsed, you\nknow, and when we had to run, the questura, the -- these Fascist headquarters that tell my father\npick up where you want to go, he send the word to the priest of the town telling people to get --\nhe had a -- a lot of that, because starting tomorrow Nazi are taking over, I\u2019m out of business.\n[indecipherable] ever protect him, so whatever you can do for them, do for them. Then the -- the\nAndreoli relayed this to us. Andreoli had the connection with the priest in Florence, and they call\nthat priest in the Florence, said we got these refugees here, and we\u2019re going to have to put them\nsomeplace because Americans are coming up the boot, we know that it is only a question of\ntime. Can you help us? So the priest said, I see what I can do. And sure enough [indecipherable]\nthey couldn't s -- we had only hours, said okay, tell him to go to -- to Florence, and go to such\nand such a store in piazza Pitti, you are f-familiar with Florence? In piazza Pitti, right in front of\nthe Palazzo, piazza Pitti --",
        "A: It\u2019s a little leather good store.",
        "A: Hamer leather goods store, and selling to -- ca -- look for Senor Torchio. Senor Torchio is\ngoing to take over from there. Now this is only two blocks from Ponte Vecchio.",
        "A: Okay?",
        "A: Is on the ri -- that\u2019s right. So they say we -- they send us over there, we already on next train,\nwe have a problem. We got to make to -- to Florence, and from the station to that store roof,\nmissed the -- we\u2019re -- was --",
        "A: Yeah. We went on the foot, we didn\u2019t want -- we tried to be like 20 - 30 feet apart,\nindividually, not as a family. All these Fascist Italian with the Nazis decoration and I\u2019m talking\nhard [indecipherable] they volunteered. They were embarrassed because Italy collapsed. So we --\nfinally we made over [indecipherable] I got place for you, it\u2019s not very far. You go over there,\nand via Borgo San Jacobo, this is a street right next to Ponte Vecchio, and th-the houses all --\none was on the [indecipherable] and the other was across the street. And wa -- were called via\nBorgo San Jacobo and was going -- extending about three, four blocks. He say go and visit -- I\nforgot the number exactly, and talk to the housekeeper, who take care of palazzo. They -- the\ngarden apartment in palazzo. She was called -- so called portiniya, you know, that\u2019s a -- in\ncharge of whole building [indecipherable] whoever needs anything. Here you would call it\ndoorman, but she was not doorman. You come to this, you at s -- anyway, in this apartment was\nItalian colonel, very big Fascist, who was so ashamed that Italy collapsed, that he volunteered for\nRussian front. Now, what the Nazis did, the S.S. come, seal his apartment, because he knows\nsomebody else is going to try to rob it or take it over, some Nazi or Fascist, so nobody can touch\nit. So obercommand from deutsche politsi sealed the apartment with a seal. But she has a key\nfrom back door. So in this apartment of this Nazi, we were refuges in there with Ruza, with this\nattorney husband, my father and me. Ruza was the only versatile enough to go in the street not to\nbe s-suspected she\u2019s not Italian. She blended in perfectly and Italian was quite good. So all the\nsupply that we needed --",
        "A: -- was Ruza provide.",
        "A: Yeah, what -- this th -- oh, five of them. Big apartment. Ah, there\u2019s a radio, we were listen\nradio London, and [indecipherable]. Had everything.",
        "A: We are hiding, of course, nobody in building know we are there.",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t worry that some Nazi come in because it\u2019s sealed. My mother catch t-typhoid\nwhile we are here in that apartment.",
        "A: Typhoid.",
        "A: So again we go back to Mr. Torchio. He said, [indecipherable] okay, I get you a doctor. At 11\no\u2019clock at night, Italian Fascist doctor, a major with a Fascist uniform, come over to the door and\ntell to Neila Fussi, that our house ki -- was hiding at -- say you got here a Jewish family hiding,\nand she almost doody in her pants. She said yes. Say, I\u2019m a doctor so and so, that Mr. Torchio\nsend me over, you got some people sick here. So he was coming there every night, giving us\nshots, and taking care of my mother, at the risk of his own life, that\u2019s why he\u2019s coming 11\no\u2019clock at night. Stealing the serum from the military supply, til my mother got well. After the --\nfour [indecipherable] say no, it\u2019s very dangerous for me and for you, I don\u2019t want to come\nbecause somebody might follow me. You know, you never what they do [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- he said. Now, she\u2019s to the point of recovery, she\u2019s not infectious any more, so you can relax\na little bit. But one thing she is desperate is a vitamin C. Where the hell do you get vitamin C?\nAgain you go back to Mr. Torchio, to a -- and don\u2019t worry about it, he said. It\u2019s a monastery up\nthere, the hill above Florence, the nuns. They growing lemons on the tree inside monastery. Next\nday we had all the lemons and stuff that we wanted. Just to give you a little [indecipherable] this\nis absolutely mind boggling. So my mother weather this things out. Now, Americans already in\nfront of Florence. German are feeling the heat. And German Hauptcommander give the order\nthat all the streets facing the Arno River have to evacuate because there\u2019s somebody that screw\nup in [indecipherable] think American won\u2019t be able cross the arn -- Arno River. Now, the only\ncity they didn\u2019t blow up is Ponte Vecchio. Now everybody thought that Ponte Vecchio, first of\nall, Germany loved the arts, and they didn\u2019t want to destroy. It was something else, German\nengineers, they figure out Ponte Vecchio cannot hold American Tiger tanks.",
        "A: Yeah, so they will not tr -- the Americans are not stupid, is not going to close it. So when the\nAmericans -- they didn\u2019t touch it. So they left this here. With the rest of it, where we lived -- but\nit didn\u2019t blow up. They gave us four hours to move. Not us, the whole build -- now we didn\u2019t\nwant [indecipherable] no more, because now we are [indecipherable] with Italian.",
        "A: 4,000 refugee in Palazzo Pitti. Now, that\u2019s where is -- where all the art gallery be, all the fun\nstuff. Now, the shelf where used to be those expensive things, we took the picture and pile them\nagainst the wall, and those were our beds, because they were 18 inches apart. Now in the garden\nthere were two wells of water. Now, for four days, the 4,000 people only supplied the water for\nthem in this Palazzo Pitti, was this thing. No bathroom facility. But we really made that flower\ngarden really flourish. Now you --",
        "A: Ob no, no. We -- we --",
        "A: -- we\u2019re 1-1n the -- in the garden --",
        "A: -- inside, during the night, all of them in the building. Younger people, without the kids, they\nwere sl-sleeping in the garden, they didn't want to. But for us they give us, with the family, we\nwere using the shelves as a bed. Didn\u2019t have no mattress or anything, a blanket, or you coat,\nwhatever you could put under the head.",
        "A: On the fourth day, about three o\u2019clock in the morning, when they blow all the houses, and I\nhit the -- the air percussion was so strong that my head hit the bunk above it. I really -- moved\nme up [indecipherable] everybody, we know bye-bye, Germans are gone. Now here come the\nAmericans. You know how long took Americans to cross river? They brought those big\nCaterpillar bulldozer, and they fill up the Arno River in two hours. Italians -- the whole Florence\ncome to see what the hell that stupid American\u2019s doing. Like nothing. They use the ruins of the\nbuilding, they actually done him a favor. They just pushed the debris in the river. But they were\nsmart, they couldn\u2019t keep it very long, otherwise they would block the flow of the river.",
        "A: When they were on the o-other side, they cleaned it up dimen -- and then they come,\nAmerican pontoon engineer and put those temporary bridges in -- in 48 hours river was flowing\nand American was going both direction. Now come -- we report right away to American\nauthorities. And they tell us, okay, we got the camp in Rome, which all the foreign refugee, now\nquote unquote, who are awaiting repatriation to their homeland are going ahead to the camp of\nCinecitta. Now we are going to move you on the trucks partly, and partly the trains, because\nsome part the [indecipherable] train is not working. So we have to move you from Rome to\nGrosseto by truck, and then we put you on the train to Rome. We couldn\u2019t care less, we\u2019re\nsleeping the army tent, I got introduced to the corned beef, and to all the American good stuff\nwith the breakfast. Egg -- powdered eggs, the first time in my life, you ever tried them?",
        "A: You wouldn\u2019t believe it. You would -- you -- but was all kind of food you wanted. Bacon, oh\nmy God, was coming out of your ear. And you could eat as much as you want. I mean, there\u2019s\nnot such a thing you what -- what is --",
        "A: American army.",
        "A: Was ya -- you -- it was just --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It was regular under tents you know, no building. When --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah --",
        "A: -- it was sh -- f -- like MASH, only without the hospital in the field tent.",
        "A: And -- and then they put the truck, take us to Rome. Now we arrive -- we were liberated\nsometime in the first part of the August, th -- took about, I think, one weeks journey from\nliberation to arrive in Rome. By time we arrive in the camp in Rome, Evie was there already\nbecause she was liberated four days before me. She was further down south. But that time her\nmother was working, her father was working, and in -- in order our family, which was friend of\nEvie\u2019s from V-Vienna, they were in Ferramonti. They were liberated before so they were first in\nthe camp, and that\u2019s was a mother, father, daughter and Kelmer was a son-in-law of that Winkler\nfamily. Family was Winkler and son-in-law was Kelmer. And he was a typical Jewish Viennese\nfinagler. Al-Always know his [indecipherable] to find. It took him exactly 10 days that he\nbecome a general manager of the kitchen for refugee. He spoke a little Italian, spoke a little\nGerman, he was able to get connection with Americans, say hey look, you\u2019re a guy, we need\nsomebody to run this kitchen, we got about turnover between 900 and thousand prov virtually\nevery week, and we need to put it together a staff to feed and take care of it. Now one thing you\nknow about American, they\u2019re not multi-lingual.",
        "A: So they need a multi-lingual staff to take care of this [indecipherable] because there were 10 -\n15 nations. But next to us was a Italian camp, still in Cinecitta, just for Italian refugee. That\nItalian [indecipherable] took care of it. But was a big different in the food and supply what\nAmerican were taking care of in Italian [indecipherable]. So Italian refugee would be delighted\nto be in the foreign camp, but couldn\u2019t get in foreign na -- now, by the end it came they were\nlooking -- 1-1f car -- 1s approaching some kind of American holiday, I don\u2019t remember if was\nLabor day or whatever it is. And American guys the officer wanted to have a holiday. So they ma\n-- they send a feeler out, any of the refugees you know how to cook, we need a cook and a baker\nto make cakes. So I asked my mo -- my mother says how long for how long. He says, well all\ndepend how good you cook. So sh -- my mother start cooking for 30 guys. Now, Evie\u2019s mother\nwas already working for the employees of the camp. Now Kelmer, that guy who was first\narrived, he was running refugee kitchen, so I\u2019m telling you how those Jews got all situated in key\nposition. Now my mother wa -- pure accidentally because my mother was a gourmet cook and a\nbaker. So she prepared, you might think, Labor day meal what -- August was Labor day, because\nwe arrived in August. And she cook him a pishinger torte and a Dobish torte, and a Sacher torte,\na -- you name it. And the guy said -- and then say she cook him paprika golish and stuff. Sa --\nsays hey listen, we got to hook up with the girl. So she -- Mother told him, you know what? You\nhave three Slovenian guys, helpers. All of them know about cooking a little bit. I\u2019m considering\nthe deal, but I want those three guys as helpers because I cannot handle it by myself. I know\nthese guys know what they are doing, and if I give them direction [indecipherable]. She got the\njob. Now my Aunt Ruza that was liberated with us, when we come to the camp the first thing\nthey want to 1-1n -- give us injection and all the protection all diseases. But my Uncle Pawel ba --\nmy smart attorney, is like Evie\u2019s brother, no injection of me. Nobody\u2019s going to poke me with\nthe needles. Next day he left the camp to live in Rome. Found hisself a little apartment\n[indecipherable]. And they never came back to camp. Lucky for them [indecipherable] order that\nmy mother got job in the kitchen, because they never had to spend a di -- dollar for grocery.",
        "A: They came twice a week for the food supply that you will not believe it, the shopping\n[indecipherable]. It just happened the chief of police, again a refugee, was a gradanier, Serbian\ngradanier from Belgrade, he was a royal guard, about six foot five, he becomes chief of police.\nWe become friendly with him, and that [indecipherable] our family was schlepping this stuff,\nsaid did you come for the supplies?",
        "A: He not only knew it, he say that\u2019s what they have, you want me to get you Jeep to take you --\nthey were living in piazzi [indecipherable] maybe only four miles down the road from Cinecitta.",
        "A: Yeah, Ruza is with Pawel in the apartment. Ruza was carrying, and Pawel, but some of the\nstuff is heavy, you know.",
        "A: They had to catch a streetcar to go back.",
        "A: So he ask him, you want my Jeep to take you home. It was so funny. He -- Evie -- when sh --\nwhen Evie was standing next to him, he was resting his elbow over on Evie\u2019s head because she\nwas so small.",
        "A: Sorry. But that\u2019s why my mother got employed in the camp in Cinecitta, and -- and we\nthought we were living like kings. Now people, who went out to Rome on their own become\nwealthy. They were dealing with gold, they were dealing with all kind of mishigosha zachen on\nthe black market. But we were content, we didn't want to take any chances, we didn\u2019t want to\nrock the boat, we were very happy and we live like king because we got those private rooms that\nused to be dressing room of the stars. Like, we were in a room that used to be dressing room\nfrom Italian actress Alida Valli, I don\u2019t know if you ever heard of her.",
        "A: Okay, but --",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: -- SO we were -- and we had the running water in the bathroom, and all of that. And then I\nhooked up with Evie\u2019s brother and Heinz Winkler. That was the brother-in-law of Kelmer --\nKelmer and Mary Winkler\u2019s dau -- really, Winkler\u2019s sister.",
        "A: And they become a little clique in the camp, and I thought that I had died and went to heaven,\nI love it. Four -- five Austrian Heinz\u2019s, and me --",
        "A: Yeah, I fell in this group. So it was four -- I couldn\u2019t speak German, except a little that I pick\nup at home. But those guys was constantly blabbering in -- in German, so I was forced to\n[indecipherable]. So we decide, look, we got these [indecipherable] Jews for the camp, at least\n20 percent of that which -- let\u2019s organize Jewish community center. Hell, the Americans have\ntheir [indecipherable] and on their own the Jewish community center is getting all kind of goods\nfrom America. So we go over there to Jewish community [indecipherable] says, my name is\nMoishka Pinsel, we would like to make a Jewish community center in the camp at Cinecitta,\nwhat can you do for us? Says, well you bring us the membership, give us the name all the kids\nyou have, and then come once a week, [indecipherable] the chocolate, and the candy, and all\ninformation you need. Said, but you got to have some kind of orth -- organization. Here -- go\nback in the camps, so I tell every brother, okay, you are going to be vice-president, you are going\nto be treasurer, so m-make a little legitimate thing. We go Italian print shop, and we go to Italian\nhaberdashery shop. We gather those -- you know, like American hats what the soldier wear?\nWith a big Magen-David with a green background, and we become a -- Jewish boys\n[indecipherable] Cinecitta. Come for the [indecipherable] Jewish -- the own special bridge, we\ncreate it. We --",
        "A: From -- yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure.",
        "A: We were just the managing, see, because we are on permanent stock.",
        "A: The rest of kids were coming and going.",
        "A: So they have to have a nucleus who is running the thing. And we came here with a room for\nmeetings. And we had the minutes for the meetings, because Americans are not stupid, they\nwanted the minutes from the meeting before they give us chocolate. But first time that we got\nchocolate, give us so much chocolate I tell to Winkler, my friend that\u2019s still live in Kansas City,\nsaid, \u201cListen Heinrich, we got only 32 kids, Americans give us like 100 box. Let\u2019s sell them back\nand make money [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes. We still had the -- more than we need.",
        "A: From the stuff that we sold. From the stuff that we sold, we got so much overflow of the\ngoods that --",

        "A: Yes. Right wi -- piazza Vittorio. You could sell anything piazza Vittorio. Not then, even\ntoday.",
        "A: My parents didn\u2019t know damn thing except Evie\u2019s brother know, Winkler know, I know, and\nchildren, because we have to finally [indecipherable]. We were thinking to charge a membership.\nBut how can you charge a membership to the kids who might be three days in the camp, or might\nbe three weeks in the camp?",
        "A: So we have to have a source of income.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have our own sources to go [indecipherable] with.",
        "A: So we had to come figure it out to finag [indecipherable] -- w-we did what American army\ndoes for last hundred years. You know, I learned that when I was drafted. I mean that, I was in a\n-- a quartermaster. I would take a hundred pair of tee shirts, I will go to the motor pool and I will\nsay, listen, I need the Jeep, I need this, I need that. I didn\u2019t steal, I didn\u2019t get a dime. But I\nchanged the services [indecipherable]. I went to the kitchen in Tokyo and I told the chief cook, I\nsaid, you know what, I would like to come -- when I come from Tokyo, a little t-bone steak, I\nwould like it when I come at two o\u2019clock in the morning, kitchen is working all night, I don\u2019t\nwant that you give me hard feelings. But you will never have to make application for the white\npaints and the shirts, anything. You come to me, I take care of it. Pll bypass the slips altogether.\nAnd that worked for me for year and a half in Tokyo.",
        "A: It\u2019s wa -- oh, everything is bargaining.",
        "A: A matter of fact, when it was time for me to come back to United States, and that\u2019s called\nreturn to Z.I. You know what\u2019s a Z.I.? Zone of Interior. And I say damn it, I went to Japan and\nKorea in the ship, I don\u2019t want to do that again. The army transport ship, you sleeping in the cots\neight high, one on top of the other. And I was stupid that I was figure I don\u2019t want to crawl up\nthere, I was going to be the bottom [indecipherable]. And the sergeant who was on top told me\nson, crawl as high as you can. So I\u2019m not going crazy. He says, you\u2019ll be sorry. Yeah, I was\nsorry, because everybody who got sick he would cough right down below you.",
        "A: So I learned, so I said I\u2019m not going to go through this. So when I had to take a medical\nexamination to return back I said to my doctor, what can you do for me to send me back by air?\nSaid, ah, that\u2019s if you\u2019re sick, wounded, high ranking officer. So, you know sir, I know you buy\nyour uniform. How would you like to have a three pair of headquarters -- I mean lowquarter\nshoes, a couple of pair of boots, some underwear, and I gave you a uniform to put me on the air.\nSays how can you do it? I says, you put me on the air and you\u2019|l see. He says, you have a deal.\nSo he wrote a paper that severe motors -- motion sickness, that I got deathly sick. So -- but I\ndidn\u2019t trust that son of a gun, so I brought him all the left shoes, and I brought him pants but no\njackets. And I brought him shorts, but no tee-shirts. When I saw my name on the order that I\u2019m\ngoing to States by air, I gave him the rest of it. And I flew. I fl -- descended back the air. I was so\nexcited that I was in 24 hours in California. Now, he put the manifest that I\u2019m very si -- problem\nwith sickness. He said, be sure when you arrive San Francisco, ambulance be there for you, so\nyou better be very sick. So I was there, and they sure pick me up with the orders\n[indecipherable], but when we stopped next to a telephone booth, I couldn\u2019t resist to jump to call\nhome that I\u2019m back in States.

And they gave us birth benevento, which is southern Italy already in American hands.\nSo if they wanted to find out if is true or not, they couldn\u2019t.

        "A: So it was no problem, no, no, no. Til -- til -- til the moment that the Germany took Italy over,\nwe didn\u2019t have no problem at all. We could move more -- more than you -- more than you can\neven imagine.",
        "A: I was with the kids playing, my father was going dealing with the farmer, we\u2019re going to\nbicycle to neighboring town. Nobody ask anything. A matter of fact, when -- I\u2019m going to go\ntake you back, I suppose you know a little bit about opera.",

It\u2019s a law that you got to listen to\nBenjamino. They were so proud of him. So we really had a -- you know, when -- when I think at\nthe same period the Jews were dying in these concentration camp --",
        "A: -- it was obscene how free we were. And we felt free. We never worried one single second til\nMussolini was in power, for us. And I\u2019m quoting in power himself, because once the Italian\ngovernment failed, and the new republic si -- si -- Repubblica Sociale Italiana, become in\nformation and Hitler arrested the member of Grand Consiglio, those are the people that voted\nMussolini out of power, arrested all of them. In between him was -- between them -- I\u2019m trying\nto ration myself, so I better slow down.

So didn\u2019t take Nazi very long to put together that the only person present when they\nwere making fun of him was Galeaggo Cino.",

And Edda didn\u2019t\nbelieve him. And when Mussolini was on the run, Edda could saved him with partisans, but she\ndidn\u2019t want to.",
        "A: Because when they caught Mussolini on the run in Como, in Swiss border, the partisan got\nahold of Edda, and says, who? She told him she will never forgive him and she never did, til she\ndied.",
        "A: Yeah, now i -- 1 -- but a little interesting background because we are going ho -- more -- more\nin depth than my own pis -- personal biography, that Mussolini could have been saved, see, when\n-- when Cardinal Montini -- was Cardinal Milan at that time, later become Pope, he told Duce\ndon\u2019t leave anyplace, American be here in three days. His entourage, that was loaded with the\ngold and jewelry, they were -- they were in hurry to cross the border and go to Switzerland\nbecause they figured that\u2019s the only way they can take booty across. And they figure if you have\na Mussolini with that, you have a sure way to pass the border. Well, they didn\u2019t, because at\nZongo they caught him and all of them. But when -- Montini told him three times, Duce, don\u2019t\nleave. And I have a personal feeling if he would not run by American, I! Duce would be alive til\nhe died a natural death, because mis -- America would never kill him. But we felt very safe until\nMussolini -- the way it was.",
        "A: We ne -- we never worry a single second. [indecipherable] lots anti-Semitic law, he will -- he\nwrite the story what happen in Italy, and there were unpleasant things, especially for Italian Jews,\nthey become sort of -- Italian Jew resented Mussolini more than us, because Italian Jews helped\nhim get in power, so they become very resentful. We look at from different perspective. We look\nto our savior. And they look at him and feel we were wealthy and prosperous, he took it away\nfrom us.",
        "A: So it was nothing, you know, cutting -- you know, it wasn\u2019t simple solution. It was a much\nmore complicated than appear in the surface. But that\u2019s -- y -- that\u2019s -- about this period that\u2019s all\nI got to say, except if you got any questions.",

Deep south, was only camping for a month there\nbecause Mussolini wanted to go ahead and show Hitler that he put the Jews in a difficult\nposition, which was not difficult position. For a month it was in very unpleasant climate, but if\nItalian could survive there, I mean, Jews can survive also. But they put them there in the boot of\nItaly, clear in the bottom.

On the other side of -- that mean that Sicily is gone, if they moved the\ntroops on the side of Straits Messina, if you know geography.

The German put a boxcar there, and\nwaited for the sonderais to go ahead and pick a bunch of forced labor of solely Italian guys, to\nsend them to Germany for labor camp because they were running short of labor force. But thin --\nthe --",
        "A: -- the military was 15 - 16 years old, German. So they came over there in the middle of the\nrace, they stop the race -- first when they saw the horses, and they riding on the boxcar, and then\nthey push everybody towards the exit to get the working force to go.",
        "A: Now the -- the boyfriend of -- of my -- of Neila Fussi, when he saw that there was something\ngoing on, he says, Zdenko, you are young, so probably you will get away. I\u2019m going to jump\nover the fence before everybody goes ahead to over there, and he disappeared. And he says I\u2019m\nsure they will leave you alone. But I was not sure because I was pretty good size boy. But I saw\nthe exit next to me, a woman, when she was -- while the German was talking to her, and she\nwent to the German off the [indecipherable] and the guy just kick her in her ass and pushed her\nout of the line. So when my turn come up, I turn to the German, he ask me what\u2019s your name,\nblah, blah, I say eh-eh-eh, he let me go.",
        "A: If I -- I would never think of it if I didn\u2019t see the woman who -- at the other exit. And -- and\nthat\u2019s -- after that I never left the apartment til liberation. Tha -- so -- so scared.",

And we were making goulash and the paprikash and the -- a-a-and the\nnowcurl and all -- all the home cooking because we had -- we could do -- we had the flowers, we\nhad the meet, we had the -- we had lots of veal and we had lots of pork also.

To give you\nidea, I -- I -- Zagreb from Milan is about 280 miles, and my friend didn\u2019t think a single second, I\ntell him my connection flight to Zagreb, I have to go to Milan catch flight. It was a very bad\nconnection with the train, you have to change two trains, you have to go two o\u2019clock in the\nmorning. He says, what\u2019s your problem? He drove me from his apartment in Zagreb to the\nairport in Milan. Very few people do favors like this. Never thought of a single second, said\nwhat\u2019s the big deal? Pll drive you to the airport.

And\nwhenever we go, when I return home, it\u2019s so sad, and it\u2019s so funny, and so blessing, that we go to\nthe old stomping ground that we grew up and he drives me around and say remember what we\ndid here, remember what kind of -- we pul -- we -- you reminiscing what you youth, and --",

I\u2019m going from Modena to Florence and now in Rome. Now just imagine -- now this is\none of the most sophisticate city in Europe. Is nothing that was not available in Rome, especially\nfor us that we have a -- under umbrella of American occupation.

Is very difficult\nfor somebody who didn\u2019t live in this period to -- the concept what was happen. Once Italian\ngovernment normalize and took over, this picnic was over.

What we didn\u2019t know, if we can\ngo ahead and return home, or when, because of Communist regime in -- in -- in croa -- in\nYugoslavia.",
        "A: The people took everything over. So really, they still didn\u2019t have nothing. First the Nazi took\nover, now the commie take it over. Now, you want me to take off from this point? My father\nrealized from the minute that we have to run, already in 1941 that it\u2019s very unlikely we going to\nsee anything for a long time, maybe never. So he made the peace of mind. He were depressed,\nyes, he know he had to start again, but the other hand, when my father was fighting for Austro\n[indecipherable] empire, he had his own business, which he lost it, because when Austria lost the\nwar, he was on the other side of the border, he did come out barehanded. That\u2019s why he had to\nwork again. He was in own -- own business. So that was second time he lost everything. So he --\nthat was like a repetition of the history. Each war costed them everything they accomplished. At\nthat time Dad was not young any more, he was already 45 - 50 years old. So the -- what --\nbeyond -- my father was very -- he always believe in real estate, so he went -- 1-it didn\u2019t upset\nhim very much. It upset my mother much more than upset my father. Now, w-while we in\nCinecitta, the yugo -- Tito send his emissary to the camp to make a speech to all the Yugoslav\nrefugees that it\u2019s time to returning home. A-And they invited all to a hall, and they went to look\nfor everybody who come from Yugoslavia, and told them the war is over, now you got a free\ncountry, it\u2019s time to come home.",
        "A: No -- th -- from my father went to the guy who was a colonel with a big, red star, and the --\nall this red leather as I remember like today, and he told him, \u201cDruze, Kamarade Bergl, it is your\nduty to return home.\u201d And my father tell him, \u201cDruze, Kamarade, what you going to give me\nback?\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d He said, \u201cYou come back, you will work.\u201d He said, \u201cDruze, I\ndidn\u2019t ask you if I will work.

Will you give me my property back?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t\nworry, you will work in your property.\u201d \u201cAgain you avoiding my answer.\u201d He says, \u201cDon\u2019t\nworry, we going to come pick you up next week, you all go back home, you\u2019ll be very happy.\u201d\nWell my father told him screw it, I\u2019m not going to go ahead and deal with this stuff. And when\nthey come next week to pick up people who are willing to go, my father didn\u2019t show up.",
        "A: So he send his goons with the red star, couple of soldier that he had on the truck, to look for\nmy dad. So it\u2019s -- my dad come over there, and he tell him, \u201cWhy come you\u2019re not ready to go?\u201d\nHe says, \u201cWell, first of all -- first of all, Nazis took everything from me, now you took\neverything from me. To go back to what? That you employ me in my own factory? I -- I got a\nbetter future, I -- I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d And he says, we come -- the Commie ca -- tell him,\n\u201cComrade Bergl, you see this star?

When I fought for your freedom\nas Austro-Hungarian soldier, you were not even a vision in your father\u2019s eye. So don\u2019t tell me\nwhat will fight for freedom.\u201d I said oh my God, we\u2019ll never go back home. But you know, if you\ngo back to Yugoslavia, they will arrest you.",

        "A: -- but as we -- chronologically you advance, I will bring it to this point, but I think this -- this\nhappened shortly before we left the camp, because at this point we realize that we are not going\nback home.",
        "A: And we saw the ca -- Cinecitta was not solution, and I was now behind 1-in my schooling.",
        "A: Okay, now can -- can we go back --",
        "A: The first year that I arrive in camp --",
        "A: -- that was the August of 1944. By December of 1940 minister Italian of education pass a\nspecial ruling with all the refugees who couldn\u2019t be going to school, or were forbidden going to\nschool, they can make exam no matter what level they finish when the war started, three years at\nthe time. Then my father hire some tutoring for Italian and some other subject, chemistry. But\nmath, languages, history, geography, Ruza husband tutor me for my exam.",
        "A: Yeah. He\u2019s -- he\u2019s tutor me, a f -- and Winkler, the friend that\u2019s still in Kansas City.",
        "A: He tutor us both for these subjects. And -- and the exam was to be taken not in Rome, but in\nCastel Gandolfo, this is some -- a residential [indecipherable]",
        "A: Cinecitta was much closer to Castel Gandolfo than downtown Rome. So when the man --\nwhen ministry assign us for this exam, they send us to Castel Gandolfo, and there where I took\nmy three years of my junior high, and then six months later I took what it takes to go f -- three\nadditional years.",
        "A: Yeah, it was very tough, it was very iffy because it was lots of cramming to do, and when you\nc -- study so intensely for a short period of time -- and oh, forgot most important part, Ruza\nhusband tutor me in Latin, mandatory in Italy. Latin, oh, you had to take it first three years of\njunior high you had to -- you had so much Latin you think you want to be a priest or a\npharmacist. Because in Italy, in Europe, til 20 years ago, every prescription was in Latin.",
        "A: It\u2019s not like here.",
        "A: Never, never, so Ruza probably -- he -- he was such a fantastic innovator, that to realize that\nthese young guys, to -- to go [speaks Latin here], you know, it\u2019s a verb. That\u2019s very hard to cram\nall that you need. So he improvise kind of off color stories in Latin that he made us translate in\nItalian because he know that will sink in. Like he would say the -- I cannot tell you on camera,\nbut it was very funny story. Like, he gallo -- this 1s not off-color by the way, he [speaks Latin\nhere]. Here is the rooster sitting on a tree and saying cuckoo-re-koo. But then he come -- that\u2019s\nhow we started, then to get us more interested, he come to more color and it worked, because we\ncome intrigued, you know, what the hell it means, and -- and we managed to squeeze in -- in my\nexamina -- then when we left the camp in 1947, after three years of Cinecitta, and my father said\nlook, now you have to decide to do, and where you want to go to school. So my father left, he\nmade a couple of trips to northern Italy, to figure out where we want to stay and live in Italy, and\nhe come up with Lake Como. He said was not the big city like Milano, is not the big cit -- Rome.\nThe life [indecipherable] is happy go lucky, beautiful surroundings, sweet [indecipherable] next\ndoor. So we went over there, and I enrolled in architectural college [indecipherable] in Como.\nAnd that\u2019s when I started studying, and I went -- I was short one year when our paper come\nbecause I was trying to catch as much extra credit as I could, because I know sooner or later you\ncome for America. But I didn\u2019t manage to do them all, because I was short, I think, about four or\nfive hour of credit. And when we ask postponement for one year, American embassy told us we\ncan postpone, but you go in the bottom of the list.",
        "A: And my father would not go to bottom of the list. And I was looking forward to go to the\nbottom of the list. I was not in hurry to go to America. A matter of fact, I told my father, you\nknow, you -- I\u2019m not going to States. And my father said, \u201cYou know, I want to tell you\nsomething. First of all, I want you to know you\u2019re in Italy. In Italy, til 21, \u2019m running the show.\nIf I have to go to Italian police to put you on the boat in Naples, I will do it. So don\u2019t make a\nmistake.\u201d And I know he would have done it. So I finally give in, and -- and then we went to the\nCamp Obanioli when --",
        "A: Because this concept of a Euforia, and a I-land of milk of honey, it was baloney. I know that\nAmerica established with the hard work. It was not such a thing as free lunch. I was smart\nenough, I was not -- I didn\u2019t have a mental delusion. I was looking for what it is. Here I was --\nmy father was working his rear end to go ahead and send me to school, my only preoccupation\nwas to make a decent grade, which I tried to do a little bit by studying, but a lot by cheating. And\nI become a expert -- 1f I would study so hard as I study how to cheat to pass a test, I'd be a\ngenius. Innovation that you -- is unbelievable. I don\u2019t know if that interested you, but I want to\ntell you, the -- my math -- can I imagine I\u2019m studying architectural engineering, I\u2019m trying to\ncheat on math. I mean to tell you, it\u2019s mind boggling. But my professor of math, he liked me a\nlot. He took such a personal interest in me, that if I would ditch classes, he would take a Como\npaper and see what movie I\u2019d be hiding, and actually after classes, he would come in the movie,\ndig me out and give me a big speech, aren\u2019t you ashamed, your father is working on the bicycle\nselling the soap from one little town to the other so you can go to the school, and -- and he\nflunked me. And he tutor me the whole summer for free. You cannot be engineer if you don\u2019t\nknow the math. Til the last test. Now, we already know we have to leave for America, so we\nfigure out I\u2019m going to get at least the paper in order so I can continue in the States to get my\ndegree. And I know I can never do it, because I know it would be a very difficult test. So the\nfriend of mine who was really [indecipherable] in math, and we had at the same time a German\ntest, so he was Italian guy who di -- his father had a visual optical audio store. So I told you what\n-- tell you what I do. You help me to get me two hearing aids, and I will help you with the\nGerman test. So he brought me bunch of wire, I sit in the last row and I run a wire through my\nsleeve, through the steam pipe down in the basement, and I had a little mike in my hand, and my\nfa -- my friend down in the boiler room. So as soon as he wrote the -- our test on the blackboard,\nI wrote it -- you know, I -- I -- whispered to my friend down in the boiler room, it took him\nexactly 10 minutes to develop the test. And I was so delighted that I copied it, now is a problem\nto get out of this gizmo that I got. So I took a knife, I cut the wire -- because I was wired clear\ndown to the basement, and once you go ahead and -- and I was so excited that I send my --\ninstead of hanging to the paper and breaking my head, blah, blah, blah, I turn it to him. And then\nmy pr -- my fres -- my professor, and he looked at me, he says, \u201cZdenko, are you sure you\u2019re\ndone?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah I\u2019m done.\u201d He se -- he let me go. Rest of them took additional hours. Now\nca -- we come back to the class and he says, \u201cYou know, guys, I\u2019m embarrassed. You took one\nhour, two hours, here Mr. Bergl, 45 minutes. Now Mr. Bergl is a smart guy, he\u2019s going to come\nto the blackboard and show us how he done it.\u201d That\u2019s the end of the show. Flunked me. There\nwere made a -- make up exam in September, and one month later, was November we were on the\nway for America. But he -- he helped me enough to pass the test. Now fast forward 25 years\nlater, \u2019m coming to Como. I invite my professor for lunch with my father and my mother. Meet\nmy wife. And my professor tell me, he says, \u201cZdenko, I\u2019m teaching there for 45 years, I know\nthe kids cheat. Please, how did you do it?\u201d And then I told him.",
        "A: 25 years later he waited to tell him how I cheated. Now I come to the States, I couldn\u2019t start\nright away back to the school because I couldn\u2019t speak English, not one word. I enroll in the\nengli -- English classes through the Jewish social services, and then the army came, and my both\n-- both folks got sick, my mother and father, and they got the co -- help through the Red Cross,\nwith the commitment that when I come up from service we will pay it back. So when I come\nback, forget about the school, I had to go work because I had about -- in 1943, I had the 5,000\ndollar worth of debt.",
        "A: So [had to go back to work, and I -- I had to choose a profession, because I didn\u2019t want to go\nhave to work some manual labor or something. So somebody suggests why don\u2019t you go in some\nhigh technical field that is growing, heating and cooling. And then I went, join the labor union,\nand went on apprenticeship program, and I made a good living doing this, was very happy with\nit. And I never turn back to --",
        "A: -- the school because it took me too long -- now I was already 26 years old, so I wasn\u2019t about\nto go he -- back --",
        "A: Well, to me -- to -- to -- the fact it is that I was clever enough that I realized that you want to\nbecome a good -- you had to have a -- be good with the math.",
        "A: And I realized that I will never be good in math. I will do -- be good in lots of things, but\nmath is not my thing. So I said why should I be a bad architect?",
        "A: You know, because there\u2019s no future in it. But they should give you one funny thing -- in the\nsame school that I went in Como, I met lots of guys til the day that I had to depart for America.\nEight months ago I\u2019m reading on my internet Como paper every night. So somebody\u2019s writing\nsomething about American who went to Como, is [indecipherable] and some of them like it. And\nI write to the Como -- to -- to -- to the newspaper, I says, you know, I was raised in Como, I went\nto the school in Como, and to me to come to Europe and not to visit Como are like going to a\ncandy store and don\u2019t buy candy. And I signed my name. Next day I get a phone call from a guy\nwho graduate from the thing, become a very famous architect in Como. He told me, \u201cZdenko,\nyou were in school with me.\u201d And I was supposed to meet him this year, I was supposed to be\nmatter of fact, this month in Italy. It didn\u2019t work out because my wife caught pneumonia this\nwinter.",
        "A: So we couldn\u2019t go. But the guy -- I didn\u2019t hear from him from 1949.",
        "A: And -- and he read my name, he recognized right away --",
        "A: -- he say, you know who I am, says yes. He said, my name 1s Berlusconi, and -- and I have\nmy own company, my son is working with me. He said he\u2019s also graduate techni\n[indecipherable] school, and I have a little piccolo azinda. It\u2019s like a small enterprise that we are\nrunning, me and my son. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s funny.",
        "A: Ju -- yeah. So it just show you --",
        "A: Cinecitta.",
        "A: Cinecitta.",
        "A: Well, every -- it was a little group [indecipherable] Jewish yentas. Now you know what\u2019s a\nyenta. She\u2019s going to probably come and ask me to spell yenta. That was my mother, Winkler\u2019s\nmother, Evie\u2019s mother, and all that, that in front of the building they were living is a little park\nwith the benches. So all those ladies in their leisure time, under these pine trees, they were\nobserving the traffic, who is coming, who is coming, who is waiting, who -- who 1s cheating on\nwho. They were like a executive committee. And Evie, of course was always -- her mother keep\na very close eye on her, where she is going. And I was hanging with Evie\u2019s brother, with this\nWinkler and all of them. And my only job in Cinecitta is make to Evie miserable. And we -- like\nwe went to a beach, and Evie\u2019s laying on the beach with clothes on. I went to kiss her, she went\nballistic. And I didn\u2019t kiss her in any romantic way, I just know that she\u2019s going to be pissed, and\nit worked. And you know, as long as we were in Cinecitta, I absolutely was romantic. Only later\nwhen Evie left for America, after I was already going to school in Como, and I never thought\nthat we are going to make a connection again. It happened purely accidentally because when we\narrive in New York, week before Thanksgiving, or few days before, of 1949, Evie said that -- I\ndon\u2019t know how she tell the story how we met. The fact it is the \u201cNew York Times,\u201d ran a\npicture of my family in the front page, like an [indecipherable] with the valise, cardboard valise,\nthe refugee for Naples, because most of refugee coming to New York were from Bremenhaven.\nWe were from Naples. So they have us there, it just purely accidental. And Evie\u2019s mother saw\nthe picture, and then she start calling Jewish services, and we didn\u2019t continue for Kansas City\nbecause my Uncle Radon was living already in New York. So we were his houseguests for two\nweeks. And as soon as she find out that we are living in Manhattan, Heinz, Evie\u2019s brother come\nto pick us up and the first Thanksgiving in America, we passed it with Evie and his family. And\nthen I went to the army. Now, when I went to the army, and I didn\u2019t keep in touch with them -- I\nvisited them occasionally, New York with her brother, but nothing, nothing, nothing to do with\nEvie. When I was drafted, like year and half later, and I\u2019m in Fort Lee, Virginia, in the desert\ntraining, every weekend we go -- jumped 1n the car -- matter of fact, you know, in army post you\nhave this Saturday morning parade, and I figure a way how to beat this parade. Was a Brooklyn\nJewish kid, his name was Marda from Brooklyn, he had the car. So Marda we go to Brooklyn, I\nget a ride, he says, you get a ride if you go to the first sergeant and you get a pass for me. And I\ncome very good with the first sergeant, he -- he -- his name was Ara Bernasconi. Italian guy. So I\nwas kind of -- got thick with him, and I didn\u2019t have no problem getting passes. Problem it was\nget out of the parade Saturday morning so you could not leave til noon. And if you leave\nSaturday noon for New York, Saturday\u2019s gone. So I started a limp -- you know, during the -- I\ndon\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with the parade, it\u2019s so funny. When you go in front of the review\nstand and the guy say, eyes right, so everybody start eyes right, and you do too, I start limping.\nSo I broke the whole cadence, can you imagine? All the guys going the step, I start limping. So\nthe viewing general told the camp commander, so he said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s kid is sick, why you make him\nmarch?\u201d So he talked to my first sergeant. He said, \u201cOkay, sir, I will fix it up, I\u2019m not going to\nlet him march no more.\u201d I was out. You know?",
        "A: Ah, yeah. And -- and I took Martin with me. So he had the car and we went every Saturday,\nalready seven o\u2019clock we were on the way to New York, through the New Jersey turnpike, wump\n-- you didn\u2019t have all the roads you have now, and it was ea -- we had to go through downtown\nWashington.",
        "A: But was no problem at that time to get it.",
        "A: Oh, straight to -- I was more time at Evie\u2019s house than mine. Then I discover, hey this girl is\nnot bad, you know? And maybe while I had a girlfriend that I left in Italy, not that I was\nromantically involved. I was hanging out with her brother, and her mother was figure it out that\nwe would be a good match. And where I was stationed -- well, I\u2019m trying to fast forward that, I\ndon\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to get ahead myself. Evie was not interested in me, I was more\ninterested in Evie at this point. She had -- a matter of fact had a boyfriend [indecipherable]. And\nthen I had to leave. I didn\u2019t -- they send me oversea.",
        "A: And in that period that I was oversea, I didn\u2019t have no contact with Evie, I didn --",
        "A: No, no. I -- very little contact with her brother, but -- and my friend Winkler was already in\nthe States living in Kansas City. And still I didn\u2019t come back. And soon as I come back I went --\nthere was Christmas 1943, her brother invited me for a New Year\u2019s Eve party.",
        "A: \u201953, yeah.",
        "A: So I went from -- from Kansas City for New Year\u2019s Eve party, and I discover a even more\nprettier Evie. And I start giving her hard time, and try to courting, you know, la -- was a very\nhard thing going because she was not interested in me, I think she was more interest give me a\nhard time. But her mom was interested in me, and her brother was delighted. And then finally\nwent back to Kansas City, and I said, look, it\u2019s a very long distance relationship. So I start flying\nevery two weeks, TWA from Kansas City to New York. That time you had to fly by the way of\nChicago, and they had the constellation propeller plane.",
        "A: So it took you six hours. And then I -- I rushed from work, I arrived in New York\nInternational, her brother pick me up. She is watching Brooklyn Dodgers, doesn\u2019t even say hello.\nShe ignored [indecipherable] not only she didn\u2019t pick me up. I said what the hell I\u2019m doing here?\nAnd she -- I talk to [indecipherable] Carl Furillo and Roy Campanella, I -- I remember a few of\nthose names from the Brooklyn Dodgers.",
        "A: She was such a baseball fan. Right now she couldn\u2019t care less, but that time she was a big fan\n[indecipherable]. But I was doing it on every two week basis, and that become very expensive. I\nwas in the hock in a matter of six months to TWA something like 3500 bucks. 1953.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Her intention to avoid me. And I wou -- then finally when she upse -- accepted to marry me, I\nsaid we will do it down the line like 12 months, another year or some [indecipherable] two years.\nAnd I told her, you know, that will not work. You can stretch it as long as you want, but I cannot\nfly [indecipherable] to New York. And when she be -- we fast forward what that we got married\nthe following Fourth of July. And that\u2019s year -- that was the end of the picnic for Evie, then she\ngot stuck.",
        "A: I think I did to a certain point wear her down, yes. But you know what the funny thing is the -\n- when I was in Japan, and I was thinking of her because when I was [indecipherable] in\nVirginia, she was looking pretty good to me. At a certain point I write to her and say, you know,\nI would like to have with you a little more meaningful relationship. And if you keep putting off,\nyou don\u2019t have to -- I don\u2019t care. I got a different girlfriend in Italy. [indecipherable]",
        "A: What do you think was her a-answer?",
        "A: That\u2019s what she said. The funny part it is that we were married already three, four years, and I\nhave the picture of Italian girl in a kimono that I send her from Tokyo. And I have it in a frame\nbehind Evie picture, Evie is in the front. And she 1s living with me now already three years.",
        "A: And she doesn\u2019t know the gir -- til one day she was cleaning and dusting the picture. When\nshe found that picture behind hers, sh -- oh, that was -- I think that was the biggest fight I had\nwith her since our marriage. Really, really upset.",
        "A: No, completely forgot.",
        "A: Completely forgot. Completely. But that\u2019s one of the -- you know, one th -- one of the\nepisode.",
        "A: But the friendship that we develop in this group, like Winkler that I mention several time, and\nhis brother-in-law that was running the kitchen, we become such a tight group that it continue.\nBecause Winkler start working for Joint in Rome.",
        "A: And we become like Elkia Eliskovich, which was general manager of Joint for Rome in Italy,\nwhich was picked up by the office in Paris, which was running whole refugee thing in Europe.\nShe liked Winkler, and she put him under her wing. She didn\u2019t know how young was the\nWinkler, but after awhile -- now I\u2019m -- I\u2019m already in Como -- and she said, \u201cYou know, Henry,\nI\u2019m go o -- I need to open office in Milan. How would you like to run my office in Milan?\u201d And\nWinkler figure I\u2019m in Como, you got a deal. And within two months Winkler and the whole\nfamily was in Como with us. And he was commuting every day to Milan.",
        "A: And he is the guy who put us, you know, to go -- when the all papers come, were supposed to\ncome, he\u2019s -- I wanted to go the same place where he goes. So Winkler was -- drawed the\n[indecipherable] Kansas City. And we couldn\u2019t switch it, so we -- we both agreed to Kansas City\nand then Winkler father got sick, he couldn\u2019t leave with us at the same time. And then I brought\nhim back. I send him papers and the money to come to America in 1952, before I went to the\narmy.",
        "A: Yes. We know that was lots of people dying, but th-the horror of the way those people were\ndeported, the -- wi -- nobody knew exactly what was going [indecipherable] war but not\ncompletely going. The thing only come out when I start meeting lots of those people who\nsurvived the camps, and their story, more than the press.",
        "A: Even told the \u201cStars and Stripes,\u201d -- that was an army newspaper, they didn\u2019t co -- didn\u2019t hide\nit, they really brought the atrocity the way they were. And then yes, we were all surprised,\nbecause we couldn\u2019t believe such inhuman -- inhumanity is possible. We didn\u2019t know what\nhappened in Jasenovac.",
        "A: -- til after the war. We know that people got killed, but the way, I mean, not-- Croatia Nazi\nwere worse than the German Nazis. I mean, they were absolutely inhumanely vicious. Dying\nevery -- you know, you are dead, you\u2019re dead, but those guys what they done, the way they killed\nthe people is absolutely horrendous what they done.",
        "A: No question about it.",
        "A: No question.",
        "A: You -- the -- it cou -- would -- would boggle our mind that something possible like this to\nhappen. Even Italians -- even Italian Fascists -- Fascists, hard core Fascists couldn\u2019t believe it.",
        "A: If you were not in it, you know, when German -- I believe that the German, as overall, didn\u2019t\nknow what was going in camp, to the extent that it happened. They know they were killing Jews.\nAnd they know there were camps there, even they said they didn\u2019t know. But nobody can\nimagine what is happening.",
        "A: Nobody, because they ca -- they the -- at least -- at least [indecipherable] there were Jews in\ncharge of extermination of Jews. This is special group of people.",
        "A: I -- I -- I think -- I don\u2019t [indecipherable] concept to put it. Yes, I\u2019m definitely a survivor,\nprivileged survivor.",
        "A: No question about it. When I hear what happened to other people -- we had it so many close\ncalls it was really mind-boggling how come we didn't fall in the trappies of this phone call -- 1 --\nof this close call that we had. But the way I lived, the way we survived, the privileges we had.\nThe shower, warm water, food. I mean, come on --",
        "A: -- I mean, when I hear about the -- Evie in the caves, just few miles down the road from me,\nwhere I was leading relatively good, dangerous but good and safe -- not safe, comfortable life,\nthen you know, it\u2019s terrible thing what she went through it as a young kid.",
        "A: I\u2019m never -- you know, I was never to exposed it. Not -- you know, it\u2019s a different thing\neating and eating good. And we were eating good. I mean, you know --",
        "A: No, we were not just surviving, by all means. So -- and I become such a [indecipherable]\nItalian, on a general thing, because you got a good people, a bad people in any group. But the\nItalian always -- 1-in the majority, as a people, they\u2019re unbelievable people. Italians jealous, they\nenvious people. Like if you were very wealthy in Italy, they could be jealous about your wealth.\nYou don\u2019t have nothing --",
        "A: -- they will give you the shirts off their back. Now you will find occasionally somebody,\nItalians are always worrying, they\u2019re always hoarding because they never think is enough. What\nhappened to Evie, when those farmer, they would like to give her food, but they figure maybe\ntomorrow they will need it, because they are not sure.",
        "A: Not that they want to see her hungry, but that\u2019s how some Italian -- sometimes the Italians\nwork. Is not always even handed.\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: That the only time that my father -- oh e -- oh, excuse me, you\u2019re talking about sick.",
        "A: My father got sick while I was in Korea.",
        "A: Yeah, m-my mother had the acute pancreitis and my father heart attack.",
        "A: And my mother was fighting this cute -- acute pancreitis til the day she died. A matter of fact,\nI remember that a physician come and told us -- I almost knocked him right on his tutu -- tell me\n-- she goes tell my father -- h-he did, he said, \u201cYou know, she got maybe two, three days left.\u201d\nShe lived til she was 96.",
        "A: Yeah. And I say, how can you tell the heart patient --",
        "A: You see, what happened that the regular family doctor was not available. He was on a\nvacation. He was the guy who operate on her, her surgeon [indecipherable]. So the only one\navailable in Menora Hospital in Kansas City to see her, was him. But you figure he\u2019s a surgeon,\nhe should know enough about the pancreas, blah, blah. So he told her what a critical thing he did.\nAnd she use pancreatinis medicine on a regular basis, she didn\u2019t have no problem with it. So\nthat\u2019s the period, yeah, they happen -- they were sick while I was in the army --",
        "A: -- and the -- now don\u2019t forget, once I got United States army, Joint -- Jewish welfare was\nthrough giving you support. They were obliged for five years, but once the army took over, then\nit\u2019s the Red Cross duty.",
        "A: The Red -- yeah, Red Cross is a back-up for American service, for all the branches of service.\nSo Jewish welfare didn\u2019t do nothing to -- with them no more. Then the Red Cross come in there.",
        "A: Yeah. They di -- supported them til I didn -- come home. But they told me ahead that they\nwas going to expect to me at one point --",
        "A: -- to go pay it back. They don\u2019t make any timetable, but said, you know, they helping other\npeople, whatever you give us back is going to help somebody out tomorrow. And we felt morally\nobligated to return this money.",
        "A: And I figure longer I wait, harder it is going to be, so I figure I\u2019m going to get a good job.\nAnd I -- that -- so I picked up --",
        "A: -- yeah, go in the trade, and I paid it off quite -- relatively quite fast, I paid him back within\nthree years.",
        "A: My father lived in -- he lived, God bless him, he had a two heart attack, he had a cancer\nsurgery and -- a-and after the surgery, he live additional 12 years.",
        "A: My mother, yeah.",
        "A: We were living -- we -- I never left my p -- when -- when -- when the Nazi come to Zabno,\nmy aunt married to the doctor told my family, listen, I\u2019m protected, I\u2019m not worry. Leave\nZdenko with me. I would never left my parents for one single second. And I never said -- even\nthrough all the time I was married, that my parents live with me. I always give them the courage,\nthe honor, to say I\u2019m living with them.",
        "A: And I give my credit to my wife. It is not easy to go ahead and live with mother-in-law as\nmany years she does. But my wife was very smart. For loss of the privacy, she ha -- got a butler\nand a cook. We left for the morning -- in the morning, we didn\u2019t make the bed, we didn\u2019t have to\nworry what is for supper. We know we are cu -- we went in a gourmet restaurant every day til\nthey were able to cook and take care of us. We didn\u2019t shop for grocery. My father does the --\neverything. If he had any wishes, if I would say listen, Mother, make me Punschtorte -- you\nknow what\u2019s a Punschtorte?",
        "A: That\u2019s a brandy cake that I love --",
        "A: -- also Viennese. Or make me Sacher torte, or Dobish torte, or --",
        "A: Pish -- n-not only -- or Cremeschnitten, which are Napoleon. I mean, she was famous for it.\nThat\u2019s how she got job in the American. And she was still -- she cooked -- she died 96, but she\nwas still active in kitchen at 92.",
        "A: Yeah. So that was a payback for loss of the privacy.",
        "A: Thank God our house was big enough. So, you were -- enough space.",
        "A: But why my -- my wife is so brilliant that she made a mental rule, never be in kitchen\ntogether with my mother.",
        "A: And when my mother was not capable no more to cook in, my wife took over cooking. She\nwas sitting in her Lazy Boy chair and observing in the kitchen, every move, to the point that Evie\ngot so upset that she closed the door, because her eyes were following every step she went.",
        "A: And then we had a -- as other -- as a pay -- payoff for me not going to live in New York, that\nher parents came at least twice a year. And I loved to have them, because when I -- those two\ncooks together, what I would tell my mother I would like to have a germtike cooking. You know\nwhat a germtike?",
        "A: That\u2019s a -- germ is a yeast.",
        "A: I like a yeast sweet, made with yeast.",
        "A: And my mom -- my mother-in-law had a -- when she made something with chocolate, you\nknow you are a chocolate eater. My mother would put [indecipherable] in chocolate --",
        "A: -- in yeast. My mother -- when you eat, 1t was dripping on you. So I made them compete\nagainst each other, I was sitting back there and laughing. Was fantastic.",
        "A: Very unusual set-up, and it worked. I used to fight with my mother-in-law that you would not\nbelieve it, because my mother-in-law was a very strong willed person. But she was not grudge\nholding person. I could have a big screaming match and [indecipherable] said, \u201cMa, I\u2019m ready to\ngo out, you ready?\u201d In five minutes she\u2019s in the car with me. She loved to go in the car. Five\nminutes, all the argument, forget it.",
        "A: And I loved her. She was really a remarkable woman. I -- I really loved her [indecipherable].\nAnd she would bring, you know, my nephews, with her --",
        "A: -- when we could not afford yet for them to fly, they would come with the Greyhound bus\nwith two kids. It\u2019s a long schlep. It is a long, believe me, but she would faithfully they would\ncome to Kansas City to visit. I mean, the kids loved it, and I loved to have them, it was really -- it\nwas very interesting arrangement, you know.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I retired about 12 years ago. But the -- to the -- you want me to tell you about the story about\nmy car.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: To -- to my nephews, you mean?",
        "A: No, I -- I never discussed the Holocaust with them, and I\u2019Il tell you exactly why. We had so\nmany volunteer Polish that liked to talk about Holocaust, and we -- and I got some of friends\nwhich are Hungarians, and I know that the Hungarian Jews know very little about Holocaust.\nBecause when most of Jews who were dead, Hungarian were still in Budapest til 1945. So they\ncome on too late. It is true they paid a dear price, because Hitler had to get rid of them very fast.\nNow, the other Jews, if they young and strong, they had a chance to work in the camp, or some\nlabor. But Hungarian Jews, he was trying to kill them fast as he can because Hitler was running\nout of time. But when those Hungarian Jews who didn\u2019t go to the camp was pick up by the\nHolocaust -- Holocaust, and explained the horror of it, and didn\u2019t experience it, they are\nhypocrite. So I felt if I would go try to go ahead, how can I compare my suffering with those\npeople who come from Poland, so -- from other country, they already -- or Austria? So, it was\nnot my place to speak there. I was invited, as a matter of fact, to speak to a Jewish retire group\nnext month on 14, which are doctors and the engineers and lawyers in Kansas City, about again,\nsurvival in Italy, the Italian Alp. But that\u2019s a different chapter, because they were never -- they\nnever any -- any idea. But I would never be presumptuous enough to explain the horror of the\ncamp, because I were not there.",
        "A: Nobody --",
        "A: No, no, nobody.",
        "A: This is what be -- upset me more than you can believe. They buried this fact, all they know\nMussolini, and the Fascist, and r -- and that\u2019s all they know. It is so much behind the surface, that\nis not fair to Italians per se, as a whole, you know, because you cannot -- you don\u2019t have a --\nyou\u2019ve got bad Jews, too, you\u2019ve got Jews who were putting other Jews in the [indecipherable]\nin the -- in the -- in the crematory. So -- but you cannot make generalize. You know, you got\nexception to every situation. I don\u2019t think the guy was shoveling body in the -- 1-in the damn h-\nhigh temperature to be burned, that he done it because he hate the Jews, he was trying to survive.",
        "A: So h-he -- is all depend from what perception and what concept you are looking at it. But I\ndid -- they did ask me to speak to schoolchildren, and -- and is very interesting, and I can tell\nyou, Kansas City, I\u2019m very proud to have invitation all over. And all the right religious group,\nthey make sure that Holocaust is not forgotten. It is amazing. Right now in Kansas City we have\na third generation of Holocaust survivors speaking about it. We have -- those guys something in\ncommon with me, they were not the camp, either. But they were privileged to say my\ngrandfather. I don\u2019t have that. See, except for my -- one of my mother brothers, who got caught\nin Split, like I told you [indecipherable]",
        "A: Nobody else got burned in this Holocaust.",
        "A: Now, my father\u2019s side, in Serbia, they\u2019re killing the first four days the Nazi got in Serbia.",
        "A: First four days.",
        "A: Nobody on my father\u2019s side survive. Nobody.",
        "A: Nobody. Nobody.",
        "A: He was -- when the war finished, the only Berg] is left alive. And there were four brothers, no\nsisters, four brothers. Remarkable thing it is, by the Jewish community where I have 1-in Croatia,\nthat there were very few Jews in comparison to other countries. But th -- all very successful\nJews. I would say is, in Croatia that 80 percent of Jews were self-employed in some kind of\nbusiness, along with 20 percent working for somebody, or for some enterprise. And then a -- in\nmost of community, wherever they live, th-the excellent relationship with Jews. It was not an\nanimosity like Poland that when you go in front of church you went pah, pah, pah. That didn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] but it -- it was a very, very tight relationship, right through the whole country,\neven Bosnia. Now, you had some Jews here [indecipherable] you have in -- do you have them\nhere too?",
        "A: You have a Jewish [indecipherable] in Israel. But as a whole that we could really feel? No,\nno, no.",
        "A: You know --",
        "A: -- excuse me, I want to tell you something which 1s amazing.",
        "A: And is a compliment to the Jewish race. From 1947, through 1955, now I\u2019m -- I\u2019m giving you\nthis window because 1955 include Hungarian revolution, when Hungarian Jews start coming to\nUnited States. In this period in Kansas City come 270 families. From hodgepodge of all the\ncountries. Almost all of them were self-employed. I wouldn\u2019t say more than 15 percent was in\ngroup like me, working or learning -- but not big enterprise, some more, some less. Some of\nthem immensely successful. But what I\u2019m trying to bring a point about the welfare. We all went\nto the school from first day we arrive, to learn English, working at nighttime. I restrain from any\ngroup coming in the United States want to change the system, or improve the different language\nin our educational system. I don\u2019t care from what country you come. If you want to preserve\nyour heritage, f-fine. You want to teach your kids so they are bilingual, fantastic. But don\u2019t mess\naround with a system that works. That\u2019s why we went to this school. And sa -- same Jews now,\nthey were they -- they were -- you know, I had th -- have the blessing of advanced learning,\neducation, faculty and all of them. Most Jews in Kansas City, they were so illiterate, and so\nJewish oriented, if they picked up \u201cKansas City Star\u201d in their hand, it didn\u2019t have a picture, they\nwill hold it upside down. Can I tell you more than that? Only Hebrew. And yet, every one of\ntheir kids is college graduate. From surgeons to doctor to engineers, to professional -- is absol --\nmind-boggling. So it is a land of opportunity. Those pi -- you know, those parents are so ignorant\nin comparison to their kids and grandchildren, is mind-boggling. But they were willing to work. I\ndon\u2019t care what work they performed. They were very, very successful what they were doing.\nNever on welfare. I don\u2019t know a single Jewish in Kansas City that\u2019s went on welfare. They\naccepted from Jewish community to get started only, but every one of them was very anxious to\ngo on. I don\u2019t know anybody who did not send their kids to college. I never see -- every si --\nevery one of our friends, the kids have. And some of them from prestigious universities. So it is\nsomething in willingness to work. Jews are not lazy people. And they have a hump to pick up\nand go from nothing.",
        "A: You know, even to this day, when I socialize with my friends, and I know they are much\nsmarter than they are. I mean, bias to show how much smarter I am than they are. Instead of\nbringing them down, I bring myself, lots of times to their level. I\u2019m more comfortable with it.\nAnd -- and sometime when I say something tremendously stupid, I don\u2019t want to make them feel\nthat way. I try to explain as gently as possible where they making a mistake.",

Well, later on they could s -- draw their own conclusion through\nthe years, because I came many times back, with a little later on confusion because I didn\u2019t take\nmy car, but I rented the car, one time a Mercedes, one time a Volvo. So I come there all different\ncars in -- you know, when I came to my hometown. But this first -- I wanted to make a splash the\nfirst time I came.",

        "A: Because if you compare what is any other place, you don\u2019t have perfection, you always have\nflaw. But I can go here in the streets, say what I think without worrying somebody shoot me. I\ncan go in middle of Washington and say hey, Bush stink. Try to do that -- go in Germany, in\ntoday in democratic Germany and say Helmut Schmidt stink. Go say in middle of the Rome, in\nfront of parliament that Berlusconi stink. Today, it\u2019s today.
