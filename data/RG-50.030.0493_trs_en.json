        "Q: Now, I know you\u2019re born in 1931, and you in fact, don\u2019t know your father for a\nhugely long time. Do you remember him as a kid and what sort of relationship you\nhad?",

        "A: He was a softy.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: But, my mother, she was a strict one. With him, I could get away with things, but not\nso easily with my mother. I have very fond memories of him. Sundays, we usually\nused to go out to a restaurant, my older brother, my mother, my father and I, and I\nalways ordered the same thing.",
        "Q: As your dad?",
        "A: Yes, well, we all ordered what we called \u2014 it was Latvian version of a Chateau Brion,\nbut completely different from what a Chateau Brion means over here or in France. It\nwas a Latvian version of Chateau Brion. In summers, we spent some time at the\nbeach together and we were at the Riga beaches, father came to visit. So, no, no, I\nhave a fond and very warm memories of my father, yes.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your mother. Then, I\u2019ll go back to-",
        "A: Well, my mother-",
        "Q: Her name\u2019?",
        "A: Clara, Clara Jacobson Schwab. My mother was a wonderful, wonderful person, but in\ncontrast to my father, she was very, very strict in the upbringing and well, let\u2019s say,\nmy father would say to my mother sometimes I would hear him say, \u201cWell, just leave\nhim alone.\u201d He\u2019d said. So, she would say, \u201cNo, no, no, he has to be taught his\nmanners, this and that, so on and so forth.\u201d But, I \u2014 also wonderful. Well, I wouldn\u2019t\nsay wonderful, but strict governesses particularly a German governess who taught me\na lot which I didn\u2019t like because I liked to rebel.",
        "Q: Do you get that from you father a little bit, the rebellion?",
        "A: No, I think it\u2019s more my personality, but I don\u2019t think neither my father nor my\nmother were rebellious types, no, no, and also not my brother, but I was \u2014I was a\ntalkaton. I could talk non-stop, and my mother used to tease me that I have her big\nears because I listened to things I\u2019m not supposed to listen to because everything\ninterested me. So, on my days with my mother, which was usually Wednesday, I\ncould determine what she would wear, and we would go and I would go to with her to\nmy favorite cafes and I would pretend that I was drawing doing something, but I\nwould overhear what my mother was talking with her girlfriends. So, the gossip in\ntown, et cetera, but I didn\u2019t understand much of it, but-",
        "Q: But, you took it in.",
        "A: But, I took everything in because everything was I found very interesting, very\nfascinating.",
        "Q: So, old would you have been when she took you on her little trips to the cafe?",
        "A: Oh, it started rather early because I would say about five, started five, six, seven,\neight, nine, yes because I also refused to eat for a while at home.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes, and it was a problem, but by that time I must\u2019ve been about six or seven, and I\nhad an aunt who came from Riga, who had recently left Vienna, after Hitler. Yeah,\nactually, it must\u2019ve been already \u00b038 after the Anschluss in \u201938. I must\u2019ve been about\neight. She came especially from Riga after coming back from Vienna to Riga, she\ncame especially to Libau. She said she 1s going to make from me Viennese\nsandwiches, and anything along those lines was of interest to me, and when she\nserved me on the little piece of bread, piece of Wienerschnitzel or whatever, I said,\n\u201cWell, I know what this is. It doesn\u2019t interest me.\u201d So, finally, my mother asked,\n\u201cWhat would interest you?\u201d And, I said, \u201cI would love to go to Hotel Petersburg, and\neat over there.\u201d That was a hotel in Libau, and had also a beautiful restaurant, also\nwas private rooms, et cetera, and she would take me there late in the afternoon about\nfive, five-thirty or six, and I would always have my cocoa there, hot chocolate, and\nlittle sandwiches with hard boiled egg on top of it, a small piece of tomato, and\nanchovies, and whatever I \u2014 whenever I would get it I would sort of put it into the\ncocoa, into the hot chocolate and eat it. It was what I loved, but everything \u2014 with\nanchovies with everything. Some people complained actually, and the manager of the\nhotel came and said to my mother, \u201cMrs. Dr. Schwab\u201d, that\u2019s the way we used to\naddress people, \u201cThere\u2019s some people who object to seeing your son put everything\ninto the hot chocolate and eat it then.\u201d So, we were given a separate room, and for six\nmonths, I did this, and then I started eating again. I had some sort of disorder,\nwhatever it was, I don\u2019t know, but for about six months, we went almost every single\nday to the Hotel Petersburg in Libau, and that\u2019s how I ate, and also I continued at\nhome to put everything into hot chocolate. Hot chocolate, whatever I had was hot\nchocolate sandwiches.",
        "Q: So, do you think you needed soft food? Is that why you think you-",
        "A: No, it was just tasty.",
        "Q: It was tasty.",
        "A: It was tasty, and whatever else I liked were desserts \u2014 cakes, and cakes naturally are\nfantastic. So, I remember always also during the day, et cetera, sneaking 1n sometimes\nalone or with an aunt of mine or with my governess going to a particular caf\u00e9 in\nLibau for just cakes. I just loved sweets.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting because even though your mother was very strict. She realized that she\nneeded to ask you what you wanted.",
        "A: Yes, because it was a problem, and my father also. I don\u2019t know to what extent he\nknew what to do or didn\u2019t know because in those days, actually, if a father was a\nphysician, he was not permitted to treat his son. You had to go to someone else, and\nthe pediatrician, my pediatrician, was a man by the name of Dr. Rabinovitz, who was\nthe father of the head of \u2014 later on \u2014 the head of intelligence in Israel, , and\nwhose nephew was the Israeli Ambassador here, Rabinovitz in Washington. They all\ncome from Libau, and the father, Dr. Rabinovitz was my pediatrician. So, I don\u2019t\nremember if I was taken to him for this or they just spoke over the telephone or what.\nThis, of course, I don\u2019t know, but-",
        "Q: But, you think it lasted for about six months?",
        "A: It lasted \u2014 yes, that\u2019s what my mother told me after the war when we discussed it. It\nwas, she said, many, many months probably up to about six months that we had to do\nthis.",
        "Q: Now, do you remember when you stopped using cocoa? I don\u2019t mean to drink, but to\nuse it with your food.",
        "A: Well, I would say by the time the war broke out, yes, when we didn\u2019t, yeah. And,\nactually, it was yesterday, I think, yes at the Holocaust Museum that I had some hot\nchocolate for the first time in years.",
        "Q: Was it good?",
        "A: Wonderful, I loved it. (laughs) I loved it.",
        "Q: Tell me about your brother. What was his name?",
        "A: Bernhard Boris Schwab, and for short we called him Bubt.",
        "Q: Bubi.",
        "A: Bubi, he was about eight, nine years older than I, and he \u2014 he adored me. He loved me\nvery, very much, but I was sometimes not very nice to him. I would tease him this\nand that, so on and so forth, and sometimes he got angry at me I remember, running\nafter me and sort of hitting me over my rear because I really teased him a lot. I\nremember once on a tennis court, after I annoyed him, but he was really wonderful,\nand until he was taken away, I mean, he took very, very good care of me when we\nwere just the two of us and we were alone, yes.",
        "Q: And, was he an easy going...?",
        "A: He was easy going, yes. He loved to read. He devoured reading, and it\u2019s very\ninteresting. The last two years of the Gymnasium, he remained sitting. He failed\nbecause he was interested in his own agenda just to read. He was interested, and he\njust kept on reading and didn\u2019t care about school, but this happened with me too when\nI went to school. One day, I remember coming home and declaring, \u201cI know\neverything there is to know. I know how to count to a hundred.\u201d I knew the alphabet.\n\u201cAnd, I\u2019m not going to school anymore or if I have to go to school, I will simply not\npay attention because I love to play with my games and toys, et cetera, et cetera.\u201d\nAnd, sure enough I failed every course save English because English was something -\nyou were a wizard if you learned English and very, very few people because my\nparents were brought up with French, but I was brought up with English. I had British\ntutors and so did my older brother. So, I passed only one subject.",
        "Q: English.",
        "A: English, and that was English. I remained sitting, and what was \u2014 what happened was\nwar broke out and the first thing in 1941, I thought, \u201cMy god, war broke out now. I\nwill not have to go back to school.\u201d",
        "Q: And, that was relieving to you?",
        "A: That was very \u2014 that was a relief that I would not have to go back to school.",
        "Q: Were your parents upset that you were happy about this?",
        "A: No, no, actually, I\u2019ve been thinking about it, and I don\u2019t remember having discussed\nthis with my father, but they did not seem to be perturbed or anything of the sort.",
        "Q: And, no one said to you, \u201cYou don\u2019t know everything, George, if you just can count\nto a hundred.\u201d I mean nobody \u2014 they just accepted what you said.",
        "A: They accepted what I said, and they let me play, and I played a lot. I was fortunate to\nhave a lot of toys, and I just \u2014 trains and trains, toys, all sorts of toys. I was imaging\nthat I was a general \u2014 that was already in 1939, 1940 \u2014 on the Line and a\ncousin of mine was the general of the Siegfried, yeah, he was Siegfried Lineland, and\nI was . We played war, and we had tanks and we had airplanes, and we had all\nsorts of toys. The cousin, this cousin actually is still alive. He\u2019s older than I am. He\nlives in Salzburg now. So, we often, whenever we meet, we talk about our days when\nwe used to play war.",
        "Q: Now, you were probably brought up in a fairly wealthy situation. Am I correct?",
        "A: Yes, yes, and that was also a little bit embarrassing because about \u2014 thinking about it\nin anticipation of today, about fifteen years or so ago, there was a gathering of Latian\nJews, and I, not thinking, I made the statement that I do not remember \u2014 there were\nno, I said, \u201c\u201cCategorically, there were no poor people in Libau who were Jews in\nLibau.\u201d So, they snickered at me saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t know this. You and your family\nprobably didn\u2019t know that there were poor Jews in Libau, but there were plenty of\npoor Jews in Libau.\u201d This came to me as a surprise. I should\u2019ve thought it through,\nobviously, but I had never met \u2014 let\u2019s put it this way \u2014 one who was not, well, well\nendowed from this perspective.",
        "Q: And, did you live in a big house?",
        "A: We had a large apartment, very large, probably \u2014 well, not probably, it was\nconsidered the foremost apartment building in the city, yes. It had ten rooms.",
        "Q: And, was your father\u2019s office in that building?",
        "A: In the building, yeah, in the building, yeah.",
        "Q: Did that mean that he came upstairs for lunch and you would all eat lunch together?",
        "A: Well, yes he would \u2014 what we called lunch was dinner, and in the evening was\nsupper, and we had dinner very late about two, two-thirty because my father between\nten and twelve he saw patients 1n the office, or was it nine-thirty. Then, he also made\nhouse calls. Then, he would come for lunch, go out again on house calls, and then he\nhad office hours, if memory \u2014 memory serves me right, from four to six. But, he had\nso many patients that he sometimes did not come and have supper before eight, eight-\nthirty when I did not see him because I was already in bed or whatever.",
        "Q: And, dinner when you would eat what we call lunch, but dinner in the middle of the\nday, were there a lot of conversation? Was this is a very perfunctory sort of eating?",
        "A: No, it was always interesting conversation, and when I was finally permitted to join\nthem, when I was sufficiently trained, I enjoyed it very, very much. But, then, when I\ndid sort of things that were unacceptable at the table, I was sent back.",
        "Q: And, where would be \u201cback\u201d to-?",
        "A: To my room.",
        "Q: Would you eat there?",
        "A: I would eat there with my governess.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But, when I was permitted to sit at the table \u2014 see, I try to make sure that I wouldn\u2019t\nreally spoil things because I didn\u2019t want to be sent back.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But, from time to time, I was sent back.",
        "Q: And, was this your mother making the decision?",
        "A: Mostly my mother, yes. My father thought everything was amusing. He did not\ncontradict my mother, but I remember one little incident when my father came in \u2014\nwhich very often happened. He was not there on time at two or two-thirty when we\nwould have the lunch. He came in late, and he just paced in the dining room, and my\nmother didn\u2019t talk to him and he didn\u2019t talk to my mother which was unusual, and it\nstill sticks in my mind. It happened once.",
        "Q: And, tell me about your governesses.",
        "A: Well, I had a nanny as a\u2014 when I was a very small child. She was Russian, Fanya,\nand I adored her. She was \u2014 I just could\u2019ve sold my parents. She was \u2014 she was it so\nfar as I am concerned, so far as I was concerned And then I was being prepared that\nI\u2019m going to be a big boy, and the summer we were going to spend in Riga Beach,\nand when I will come back, I will have a governess and no longer my nanya, my\nnanny, and I didn\u2019t really understand what they were saying, and we always went\nsummers to Riga spend time at the Riga beaches, to the resorts in Riga. And, when I\ncame back, she wasn\u2019t there, and I just didn\u2019t understand it. And, I remember crying,\nbut then we had engaged a German governess, Fraulein was her name. She was\nvery strict, more in my mother\u2019s tradition than in my father\u2019s tradition which was\nleisurely. My mother was much more Prussian in this sense, and the governess was\nalso in that tradition.",
        "Q: So, this was not comfortable for you.",
        "A: No, but I had no choice.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you actually complain to your mother and say, \u201cWhy are you...?\u201d",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember complaining to her. I even think I had a crush on her. She was,\nas I remember, very attractive. She probably was, I don\u2019t know, I guess must have\nbeen in her late 20s or so.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And, I thought she was very attractive, and I actually tried to behave.",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: I tried. Whether I did or not, that\u2019s something else, but she taught me so, proper table\nmanners. She taught me also had to greet people. We were also taught how to walk\nproperly. This was part of our-",
        "Q: Now, was this the major thing the governess would do was teach you how to act?",
        "A: No, also with the homework, et cetera, and we would play games together. We would\ngo out on walks and meet friends of mine, et cetera. We were there with the other\ngovernesses, yes.",
        "Q: So, did you really spend any more time with the governess than you did with your\nparents?",
        "A: Well, when I was in school, let\u2019s say I was in school \u2014 I would come home. There\nwas my governess. In the morning, no she was not a live-in governess. I got-",
        "Q: Oh, she wasn\u2019t?",
        "A: No, she was not a live-in governess. She would come in the morning, but breakfast,\nmy mother did not serve me breakfast. It was our housekeeper, and she was always\nthere when I came home or would pick me up from school, and then we would come\nhome. We would go for walks. We would do this. We would do all sort of things, yes.",
        "Q: And, given the fact that your mother wasn\u2019t working, what was she doing during the\ntime when you and your brother \u2014 when he was young enough \u2014 was being taken care\nof by a governess?",
        "A: My mother used to be a professional cellist.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. She went to the famous Riga Conservatory which was a very, very famous\nschool where as Isaac Stern once put it, you could go to any of these Russian\nviolinists, it doesn\u2019t matter who it is, they all came out from Riga, from the\nconservatory. She was playing a lot, but not professionally. Every two weeks or so,\nthere were chamber music evenings at our house. She would drag her cello, go to the\nhomes of other people where they\u2019d play, and evenings when they would go out a lot,\nthere was an opera, there was a theater in Libau. There were people who would come\nto our house for card games, kind of gin rummy that they used to play, and then there\nwere big events in the house where the men would play a game called , and the\nwomen would play gin rummy which they called in Latvia, Kunken.",
        "Q: Kunken?",
        "A: Kunken, K-u-n-k-e-n, it was a kind of gin rummy. I tried to mingle sometimes, and\nsometimes I actually succeeded and she did not say anything, but there was a very\ninteresting incident that I remember. I loved dogs, but my mother did not permit us to\nkeep dogs in the house. So, I would bring stray dogs to the house.",
        "Q: Into the house?",
        "A: Into the house.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But, we had several entrances, bring it in through the rear entrance where we had a\nvery large kitchen and a maid\u2019s room, in between the kitchen and the maid\u2019s room,\nthere was another little corridor. And, my mother hardly ever went into the kitchen.\nSo, she didn\u2019t know what was going on, and I kept the dog over there in the rear and\nwe also had a balcony. One day, there was a big card game at the house. The men\nwere in one of the living rooms what we called , and my mother and her lady\nfriends were playing canasta in the dining room, and the housekeeper came in and she\nwas not called. Instead of addressing her as Frau Doctor Schwab or Mrs. Doctor\nSchwab, \u201cIt\u2019s either the dog or me.\u201d My mother said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you mean? What do\nyou mean? What dog?\u201d \u201cWould you please mind coming into the kitchen?\u201d She got\nup, went into the kitchen and the dog went flying out. So, then, of course, I was called\nin. I said, \u201cLook, I mean\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. The dog simply followed me. I\ndidn\u2019t bring it. I had nothing to do with it.\u201d But, I loved this dog so, and this is just an\ninstant that does come back to my mind.",
        "Q: So, the dog left or did they kick it out?",
        "A: Yes, it left. No, the dog left, unfortunately, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you hear your mother play cello?",
        "A: Yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: Did you like it?",
        "A: I never liked the cello.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: No, but she also played the piano. We were forced to play the piano as children. I\npreferred to piano. I didn\u2019t like the cello. I preferred, of all the instruments, I\npreferred the violin, but my favorite instrument 1s still the piano.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And, do you still play?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: But, I was \u2014 before I hated it because I was forced to play it for something like five\nyears. My older brother, too, and my mother would sit there and listen to us play, and\ncorrect us so on and so forth, but we had teachers who taught us.",
        "Q: Now, I know a bit about why she was a disciplinarian. Being a musician, they go\ntogether in some ways.",
        "A: You may have a point, yes.",
        "Q: They\u2019re similar in some ways.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: All right, we\u2019re going to have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2",
        "Q: George, how much older was your father in relationship-",
        "A: My father was about twenty years older than my mother, and it was interesting\nbecause my father was engaged several times before he met my mother, and he came\nback \u2014 and this was in Riga, he came back from an engagement with a cousin of his\nand going back to Libau because my grandfather was at that time sick apparently.\nAnd, on the railroad station, he saw my mother with a number of other young women\nseeing off somebody on a train that was going to Germany. And, my father said to his\ncousin, \u201cThis is the woman I\u2019m going to marry.\u201d So, his cousin, whom I knew, he\ndied about twenty year ago in South Africa, said, \u201c You\u2019re crazy. You\u2019re nuts.\nYou just came from an engagement.\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t care, and I\u2019m going to go to\nthe train and I\u2019m going to sit in the same , In the same compartment with this\nman and find out who this woman is.\u201d He got onto the train, didn\u2019t go back to Libau,\ngot into the same compartment, and said apparently to my mother\u2019s brother, \u201cWho is\nthis woman?\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s my sister Clara Jacobson et cetera et cetera\u201d The next\nstation, my father got off, went back to Riga and then to Libau, and started sending\nletters to my mother, didn\u2019t know her age, and it was signed \u201cDr. Schwab.\u201d The\nappearance of Schwab is a German name. After two weeks, he senta _.",
        "Q: No kidding?",
        "A: A___.. Well, Dr. Schwab is probably Jewish, and then my parents said, and all of\nthem, the sisters, my mother was the youngest \u2014 all the sisters and brothers said,\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s take a look at him. Let\u2019s invite him and take a look at him. Let\u2019s look at\nhim.\u201d So, two weeks later, they invited him and he came to Riga, and he came in and\ngreeted everyone, and my grandparents\u2019 apparently had lined up the six sisters. There\nwere Six sisters and three brothers in the family. And, to see if my father would\nrecognize the one that he wanted. The nerve that he had, he came in, and walked over\nto my mother and gave her a kiss. And, then said, \u201cLook, I have to get some\nmedications here in Riga for my father. Would you like to accompany me?\u201d because\nhe had therea__\u2014\u2014_\u2014. It was awhat you would call here a driver _..",
        "Q: Yeah, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: A _____ in Russian, and they went out for a few hours to get the medication. They\ncame back, and my father announced that they had decided to get married. My mother\ndidn\u2019t even know anything about it, and that he will be back in two weeks, and\neverything can be ready. My mother said to me later on, she was so embarrassed to\nsay no, et cetera, that she said to her parents, \u201cYes.\u201d But, her parents kept on saying,\n\u201cLook, you don\u2019t have to go through with it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d But, she made one\ncondition to my father. He had a mustache. That he would have to-",
        "Q: Take it off?",
        "A: Take it off because she didn\u2019t like mustaches. So, what she did \u2014 they got married,\nand then he said, \u201cWell, now we\u2019ll go to Libau.\u201d So, my mother was under the\nimpression that he would stay in Riga and move in with the rest of the family because\nshe was not interested in going to Libau. And, later on when she spoke of home when\nwe lived in Libau, home to her was always Rega, which was very interesting. It was\nhome. It was a very happy marriage I must say. They adored each other. And, I must\nsay that I grew up in, despite the sternness of my mother, I grew up in a very warm\nhome.",
        "Q: So, she was affectionate as well as stern?",
        "A: Oh yes. She was affectionate, but stern. There was no nonsense. There\u2019s a right way,\nand there\u2019s a wrong way, period.",
        "Q: Now, this story that you just recounted, you heard from your mother I gather.",
        "A: Not only from my mother, but I also from the cousin from South Africa. We were\ntalking about, and he recounted it. And, also from an aunt of mine who \u2014 and some of\nmy mother\u2019s friends in New York.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Very lucky that they got along. It\u2019s a very strange story.",
        "A: Yes, but they did, and there\u2019s still a woman actually in London who 1s a very close\nfriend of one of the people who works with , very close family friend, but\nmore my brother\u2019s age than my age, who said it was an idyllic marriage.",
        "Q: It\u2019s an interesting story. So, how old was your mother when they married? Do you\nknow?",
        "A: She was around 17.",
        "Q: Really? So, she was really a kid.",
        "A: Sixteen actually, no 17, and on her 18\" birthday, my older brother was born.",
        "Q: Wow, now was that very young at that time?",
        "A: Apparently not so young I those days.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But my mother was the first of the sisters to get married. Some never got married.\nTwo of them never got married, but she was the youngest. She sort of paved the way.",
        "Q: Now, I understand you had a trolley car model?",
        "A: Well, in Libau, we had trolley cars, and I loved going in trolley cars. My life\u2019s\nambition was to become a conductor.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, and when we would go on the trains to Riga, my life\u2019s ambition was to become\nan engineer who drives a locomotive, or whatever you call them. This was my\nhorizon. And, when the planes starting flying between Riga and Libau, passenger\nplanes, I\u2019ve never been on a passenger plane Riga-Libau, I wanted to be come a pilot.\nSo, speed, in other words-",
        "Q: Is very important.",
        "A: -1s very important, and where did I get it because I saw a lot of the American movies\nin Libau where you saw in New York, bridges going up, cars, all these things. It made\na tremendous impression on me. I loved American movies. I loved Shirley Temple\nand I went around saying she was a cousin of mine. (laughs)",
        "Q: (laughs) Did anybody believe you?",
        "A: Well, these were kids. (laughs)",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting because I think that many of us, we know the movies went to Europe,\nbut it\u2019s so interesting to hear people who were living in Europe in \u201830s who actually -\nthe impression was very big.",
        "A: Yes, Bobby Breen, Tarzan movies, Bobby Breen, Shirley Temple, these were-",
        "Q: These were big things.",
        "A: These were big things for me as a child, yes.",
        "Q: Right. Did you ever want to be a doctor?",
        "A: My father said it\u2019s not good to be a doctor.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. The reason \u2014 and my mother reinforced it saying that his was called out very\noften at night, at three o\u2019clock at night, and he made these phone calls \u2014 he made\nthese house calls, sometimes at three o\u2019clock in the morning on an emergency, when I\nwould wake up and here the telephone ring, et cetera. I would wake-up. My mother\nusually accompanied him. There was a driver downstairs, and sometimes I went\nalong, and I stayed with my mother in the car and my father went in. But, I\nremember one incident with a Latvian patient, my father decided to take in the car \u2014\nthe back seat in the car with my mother and him \u2014 between my mother and him, and I\nwas in the front with the driver, and the patient was very, very sick and the patient\u2019s\nwife was also there and blamed the car.",
        "Q: For making him sick?",
        "A: For making him sick. Well, these were peasants, obviously, and this is something that\nstill sticks in my mind today.",
        "Q: I understand that you spoke German more than you spoke Latvian.",
        "A: Yes. Our \u2014 my mother tongue is German, yes.+",
        "Q: Now, can you explain why that would be since you were born and lived in Latvia?\nWhy your mother tongue would be something else?",
        "A: First of all, we lived in Courland, which was once upon a time German ___ where\nyou had the German and also subsequently the Russian aristocracy congregating over\nthere. We were products of German culture over there. So, we did not grow up with\nYiddish. In Libau, by and large, at that time I did not know of anybody speaking\nYiddish. Let\u2019s put it this way. It\u2019s only in the ghetto that I learned about that. And, I\nremember my father saying, \u201cThat Yiddish\u201d and my mother also, \u201cwas not a\nlanguage. It was a jargon.\u201d A jargon. We used the French word in German, jargon.\nAnd, language 1s something that one has to be in command of. So, the first language\nwas really German that we spoke. When I was small and my parents didn\u2019t want me\nto understand something, they spoke Russian which, of course, bothered me. So, I\npicked it up because I heard Russian being spoken all over the place. I went to\nLatvian school, and Latvian school of course we spoke Latvian. Our main\nhousekeeper, we spoke Latvian. When we had another one, Fenya, she was Russian,\nand then my father in the building had a nurse, Maria. With her, I spoke German. So,\nI grew up with all these languages, but my language number one was German. Two, I\nwould say, was probably Latvian at that time. Three, Russian, and English four,\nbecause I really liked it, and I made a point of really getting it under my belt.",
        "Q: Right. How were you when you were in school with Latvian? Was it uncomfortable\nfor you?",
        "A: Well, I remember one anti-Semitic incident. We all had uniforms, and one day I was\ncalled on to recite a poem. We had to get up. I got up. I started to read it, and the\nteacher said, \u201cYou can sit down. He reads like a Jew.\u201d I didn\u2019t think I had an accent,\nbut you didn\u2019t have to. You could be perfect and still be called a Jew for something. I\ncomplained. I went home. I complained to my father and my mother, and my father\nimmediately telephoned the director of the school. was his name. This was a\nLatvian school. He was a patient of my father\u2019s. He came to the house and\napologized to my parents that it would never happen. I was called in office. He\ndid not apologize to me. He turned the tables and said, \u201cYou have to be a good boy.\u201d\nI told this to my parents. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not going to happen again\u2019, et cetera, et\ncetera. In this class of about 25, there were three Jews, but when the teacher made\nthis remark that I read like a Jew, everyone started to laugh. It was very embarrassing\nto me, obviously, and this irked me. But, otherwise, I personally did not sense any,\nwhat we would call today, anti-Semitism. In those days, I wouldn\u2019t have known the\nterm, obviously. Next to our school was a Jewish School, and sometimes we had\nmatches \u2014 soccer matches \u2014 not soccer matches actually snowball fights. So, we the\nLatvians would fight the Jews, the Latvians school and Jews, but did not have any\novertones. It did not have any overtones.",
        "Q: And, then you considered yourself a Latvian more than you knew you were Jewish.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yes. I always knew I was Jewish. We grew up in an assimilated family. I\nknew about Passover. Once or twice I went to the synagogue with my parents in the\nHigh Holidays and I loved Passover because of the matza. The matza was what\nthey called-",
        "Q: With horseradish on it?",
        "A: No, it was cheese and egg on top, and don\u2019t ask me about menus, the finished product\nwas absolutely delicious.",
        "Q: Matza fried? Fried matza with eggs?",
        "A: It was \u2014 no, you put egg on top of the cheese and then you baked it, et cetera, and\nthen you put some cinnamon and sugar on top, and it was absolutely delicious.",
        "Q: It sounds good.",
        "A: Yeah. My mother was no good cook. She loved to bake, but had absolutely no talent\nwhen it came to cooking, and when she \u2014 I remember, this 1s an interesting incident,\nshe once cut her finger in the kitchen doing something, and my father got upset and\nsaid, \u201cIf I see you again in the kitchen, the entire staff will be fired.\u201d Your place is at\nthe cello and not in the kitchen.",
        "Q: And, you heard this?",
        "A: I heard this, yes.",
        "Q: You heard this.",
        "A: He was mad because it was a pretty bad cut. I don\u2019t know what she had done, et\ncetera, and later on when we came to the states and my mother had to cook for me,\nshe would go and buy steaks, the best steaks that she could get, and a steak \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow a couple of dollars in those days. She didn\u2019t know \u2014 she would make the steaks,\nand she said to me in the diminutive jocular, I don\u2019t know what I do, but you can play\nfootball with it because it was all to her cooking. She just did not know how to cook.",
        "Q: How to do it.",
        "A: How to do it, but when it came to baking, she loved it, and she loved to bake. But, for\ncooking, et cetera, this \u2014 speaking, coming back to what you asked me before about\nthese poor people. There was one schoolboy in my class, , and I became\nvery friendly with him, and he invited me over to his house. Not far from where we\nlived, and he lived \u2014 it must have been a very large room with his parents, a table in\nthe middle and a number of beds. We played. It must have been just underneath a roof\nbetween \u2014 I remember climbing a number of stories, a number of floors and then we\ngot into a kind of an attic. I think they must have lived in an attic, and I thought it was\nthe greatest thing because he was young and strong, and I was not. He was street-\nsmart, and I was not. And, I thought of how wonderful it is to live like this, how\nwonderful it is to be like this because I was the exact opposite, and I just enjoyed\nplaying with him, and I was invited. He died recently. He\u2019s on one of the photos that I\nhave over here. So, this is I do remember that I had this encounter.",
        "Q: And, did you go there often?",
        "A: Probably three, four times or so, maybe more, more times et cetera, but not very\noften, no.",
        "Q: Did it influence you in some way, the way he was?",
        "A: Well, it became a kind of a role model for me to be smart, to be strong, smart, this\nand that. This also reminds me about school. School \u2014 you could, if you gave some\nkids protection money, they would protect you and you could have your commandos,\nand for a centime or two or so, you could \u201cbuy your protection\u201d and they would\nbecome your protectors, and I had my allowance, whatever, maybe a quarter a week\nwhich I would spend maybe ten centimes a week to pay off these guys.",
        "Q: What would you have to be protected from?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know because there were school fights.",
        "Q: Fights.",
        "A: There were fights among the kids.",
        "Q: So, they would fight for you?",
        "A: Then they would help me. Yes, they would come to my help if need by, but I never\ngot into \u2014 I don\u2019t remember having gotten into an actual fight, but just almost\nautomatically.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you play sports?",
        "A: I used to swim and tennis, yes. These were the two things.",
        "Q: Not soccer?",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t good at soccer. I wasn\u2019t good at any of the other things, but I was good at\ntennis and I was good at swimming, yeah.",
        "Q: The friends that you had, were they more parts of the family, or where there a lot of\nfriends from school that you played with?",
        "A: Not from school. These were friends or friends of my parents and the kids with whom\nI associated with, with whom I played. My best friend was a chap by the name of\nSasha . Sashenka we used to call him. He was also a role model, and the parents\nwere the owners of most of the movie houses in Libau. So, we could sneak in back, et\ncetera, and watch then. He was very wild, and his language sometimes was off-color,\nand I would come home with the same language, and I was asked, \u201cWhere did you\nhear this word?\u201d \u201cOh, yeah, Sashenka used it, et cetera.\u201d So, for a while I was\nforbidden to see him, but the relations were soon repaired between the kids to give\nyou just an incident. He was wild. I was wild, but I always managed to play innocent.\nNothing was ever my fault. See, so.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re very clever.",
        "A: Well, I guess I had to learn.",
        "Q: When you say Sasha was wild and you were wild, what do you mean by that?",
        "A: In the middle of the city, they had a big garden where they lived, and he would throw\nstones across a wall to the neighbors aiming at people. He would instigate me to do\nthe same.",
        "Q: And, did you?",
        "A: Yes, I did, too, et cetera and of course, there were complaints. \u201cAh\u201d, I said, \u201cForget\nabout these complaints.\u201d Sometimes not using proper language. So, I came home and\nI thought, you know, that to be a wizard. Like, knowing English is to be wizard, it\u2019s a\nterm that we used in Libau was , wizard.",
        "Q:",
        "A: very actually, and yeah, so.",
        "Q: So, you liked breaking out of-",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: -the discipline.",
        "A: Oh, yes, oh, yes, I certainly did. I liked it very much, but I was always sort of put in\nmy place at a certain point.",
        "Q: But, you clearly kept both in some ways. You knew how to be very disciplined, but\nyou-",
        "A: Yes, I could \u2014 I felt comfortable\u2014 let\u2019s put it this way. I felt comfortable in home\ncircumstances with my mother\u2019s friends so on and so forth, but I also felt comfortable\nin the milieu of my Latvian friend and the impoverished, and the impoverished part.",
        "Q: But, Sasha was not.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: Sasha was-",
        "A: Sasha was-",
        "Q: In a privileged situation, too.",
        "A: Oh, yes, very privileged situation, yes, very privileged situation. Where he picked it\nup, I can\u2019t tell you. He had two older brothers, more my brother\u2019s age. Where he got\nit from, I don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s where I learned, yeah.",
        "Q: Now, when you hit \u2014 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard to know when you as a child would start\nhearing things. The Nazis take over in Germany in 1933. You\u2019re two years old. \u2019'm\nsure you\u2019re not hearing anything then.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But, suspicion is by the time 1938 hit.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I was-",
        "Q: Did you begin to hear-",
        "A: Oh, a lot. There were a lot of discussions, and I will never forget when the aunt who\ncame to Libau, she was going to make me these Viennese sandwiches so on and so\nforth, I remember still my aunt was saying to my father, the Anschluss was taking\nplace in Vienna when Hitler marched in, that Jewish women were forced to take off\ntheir furs and to wipe and polish the cars. My father said, \u201cYou\u2019re dreaming. I don\u2019t\nbelieve it. German Culture, Deutsch Couture, they wouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d And, my father,\nto an extent, was a product of German culture, and during World War I, the German\noccupation, they behaved very, very properly toward the indigenous population of\nLatvia. So, my father dismissed it.",
        "Q: Even though she had seen it.",
        "A: Even though she had seen it, he had dismissed it outright, and I remember this very\nwell, this incident.",
        "Q: So, that must have been very meaningful to you.",
        "A: Very meaningful, yes.",
        "Q: Did you wonder? Could she just see-",
        "A: No, look, I did not have an analytical mind in those days, I mean, in retrospect. Of\ncourse, I was short-sighted on my father\u2019s side, yes.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting what people will believe-",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And, what they don\u2019t believe-",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: When they\u2019re told things.",
        "A: Exactly, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, we need to stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3",
        "Q: Okay, George, besides hearing this about the Anschluss in Vienna and realizing that\nyour father just doesn\u2019t believe this, do you hear about other things going on about\ntreatment of Jews, about concentration camps?",
        "A: Not that early on the concentration camps, no. The only incident that I remember\nabout treatment of Jews was the one related to my father by my aunt.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the only one?",
        "A: That\u2019s the only one at that time, yes. I do remember very distinctly, the outbreak of\nwar in September 1939 from the radio. We had radio which we could hear the entire\nworld, and we heard the announcement from Warsaw when German bombers were\narriving and bombing and everyone was glued to the radio, and of course, the\ndiscussions why people in the Baltics were safe because we were called , sort\nof buffer states, and if the Germans were to invade, the Russians would come in.\nThey would immediately repel the Germans and vice versa, et cetera. So, that\u2019s why\nthe Baltics will remain immune to the war, and after all, as it was pointed out, and\nhere my memories were very keen because this was something new excitement. I\nliked exceptional situations, and incidentally my first book is titled, \u201cThe Challenge\nof the Exception\u201d because exception I find much more interesting than the rule, the\nnorm. This was very exciting, war. I didn\u2019t understand what it meant bombs falling,\npeople running, et cetera. This was exciting. A nine year, ten year, nine year old kid,\neight year old kid, et cetera, what did I know? I didn\u2019t realize, I mean, today I would\nsay I was a little jerk thinking about it.",
        "Q: (laughs) Right.",
        "A: And, the discussions at the dinner table, supper, centered a lot about the war and what\nwas happening, and the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of August 23\", 1939 where the two\nhave come together, and after all, Hitler and Mein Kampfe was also saying that the\nreason \u2014 one of the reasons \u2014 why Germany lost World War I, and he will never make\nthe same mistake, is fight on two fronts, and after Poland fell, I mean the war was still\non with Britain and France, even though it was a kind of a phony war during the\nwinter years until April, May 1940. So, everyone felt safe in the Baltics. We felt safe.\nNothing is going to happen to us.",
        "Q: Given you were so excited in some ways that there was a war, but death was not\nmeaningful for you at this point, of course, did you in some way hoping that it would\ncome to Latvia?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You wouldn\u2019t.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So, it was enough that it was someplace else.",
        "A: It was someplace else, yes. It was excitement, but someplace else. No, I didn\u2019t think\nSO.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re okay in 1939. It doesn\u2019t feel like anything is going to happen.",
        "A: No, no, life was beautiful.",
        "Q: Life was fine.",
        "A: Life was very, very fine, very beautiful, very exciting. I loved to go to Riga. I could\nnever understand why we lived in Libau in such a small city and not in Riga with 13\ntrolley car lines and Libau only two. More interesting cafes that in Libau, better\ngossip, I guess.",
        "Q: How do you understand your father not going and having his practice in Riga do you\nthink?",
        "A: Because the family is from Libau. My grandparents lived in Libau. We all were from\nLibau.",
        "Q: I see. So, he preferred to stay within that context.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Now, in June of 1940, the Russians occupy. Am I correct?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember the beginning of the occupation?",
        "A: Actually, I remember it very well. I was on the Riga beach with one of my aunts and\ncousins and uncle, and my mother immediately came to Riga to the beach to fetch\nme, and I was in my aunt\u2019s apartment. This was already a day or two before it\nhappened, in my aunt\u2019s apartment which was not very far from the Soviet embassy in\nRiga, and from her terrace, I could hear over the loud speaker Vishinsky, the\nnotorious Vishinsky addressing the crowd, welcoming Latvia to the Soviet Union\nbecause the Soviets came in at the invitation of the Latvians, according to him, and\nfrom the balcony, from the terrace, I could also see how the Latvians were marching\nwith big banners, and I assumed that on those banners were \u201cWelcome Russia. We\u2019re\nfinally liberated from the dictatorship of \u201d Whatever. I only saw the placards,\nbut not what was on the placards. So, these marches \u2014 yes, I, I was in Riga on that day\nand I heard his voice, Vishinsky\u2019s voice.",
        "Q: And, your impression of this? This was very impressive and interesting?",
        "A: Everyone seemed worried.",
        "Q: They were-",
        "A: Everyone seemed worried, yes, but-",
        "Q: Not you?",
        "A: Not me, no, no. I felt safe. I, some way or another, felt safe. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I never thought\nthat I had to worry about anything, let\u2019s put it this way.",
        "Q: And, when you say everyone was worried \u2014 your father, your mother, your aunt.",
        "A: Well, this was-",
        "Q: The adults?",
        "A: Yes, the adults in Riga, but my mother took me a day or two later, took me back to\nLibau, yes. So, in Libau, we went to the beach as usual, to the tennis courts still in the\nfirst few weeks, et cetera. Finally, we were permitted to talk to Russian soldiers\nbecause the Russians had established bases in Latvia already in September, October\n1939 as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, but we were not permitted to talk to\nRussians.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, but now we were permitted to talk to Russians, and I remember on the beaches,\nthe Russians, also Russian soldiers, Russian trucks on all the beaches, and we could\nget these Russian insignias what we called , et cetera. So, we begged them,\net cetera. But, soon after the occupation, we were all notified in our building where\nwe lived that we had to evacuate, and evacuate it rather rapidly because it became\neventually the headquarters of the Communist party for the Libau and the region\naround Libau, but we received an extension for a couple of months. First of all, they\nneeded my father\u2019s expertise, and we had to find a smaller apartment which turned\nout in my mother\u2019s mind to be a disaster because we had to live in six rooms. How\nare we going to manage six rooms? My God...",
        "Q: And, how many did you have before?",
        "A: About ten. How are we going to do this? I had to double up with my brother. We had\nthe same bedroom. My father was not permitted to put up \u2014 to have an office, but he\nwas permitted to see private patients because, again, of his specialty. So, he had a\nkind of a sitting room where his library was, but all the X-ray machinery,\nmachinery, all this was stored in the maid\u2019s room.",
        "Q: And, could he use it?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: He couldn\u2019t use it?",
        "A: No, because he became head of the policlinic over there at a salary and everyone\nlaughed at it in the family of something like 30 Rubles a month. We were not\ndependent obviously on the 30 Rubles a month. And, he started getting patients for\nwhich I don\u2019t think, I mean, he charged. I remember the admiral of the fleet or\nsomething along those lines, came and consulted my father and he even came to our\nhouse for dinner, the admiral, and I remember this because I admired his uniforms\nand the illustrious medals that he wore. That was in the new apartment that we had.\nIn the old apartment, we had to take in a Russian soldier. Everyone had to take in\nRussian soldiers because Libau was a major base for the Russians, and Libau had\nthree ports that never froze in the winters and that\u2019s why you had also a very big\nnaval port in Libau where part of the Russian fleet was stationed. So, it was very\nstrategic significance. Libau as a city, and that is probably why Libau was much\nbombarded by the Nazis in \u201941 when they invaded, and in \u201944 and \u201945 \u2014 and there was\na lot of fighting in and around the city, and the city was about at least 85 percent\ndestroyed in contrast to Riga which was not a strategic site, and there was relatively\nlittle fighting, and the city, by and large was preserved, is preserved.",
        "Q: And, when this Russian soldier came into the original apartment, he lived in a room\nor what?",
        "A: He lived in a room, yes. He came, but sometimes drunk, had very curious habits, not\nwashing himself, but spraying himself with a kind of an autocologne that smelled\nterribly, but this was common apparently among the Russian soldiers. Different\nculture- different habits, et cetera, and people used to laugh. I remember my parents \u2014\nthe Russians loved music, and they would go to the opera, an in those days when you\nwent to the opera very often you put on a tuxedo and long dress so on and so forth.\nSo, the Russians wanted to show how well they can dress. So, some of the women \u2014\nthe wives of the officers came in long nightgowns.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, and I remember snickers about this. I certainly do remember this, but then they\ndistinguished you had still officers from the old Czarist days, and this I remember my\nparents saying what a difference it makes from these , | mean the ordinary,\nfrom the old days. The aristocrats versus ___. Youcan See, of course, immediately\nthe difference. Or, if they try to be like the aristocrats, you just have to scratch a little\nbit and you saw where they came from.",
        "Q: Now, do you remember this soldier? Was he \u2014 did he have any relationship with you\nor not?",
        "A: He was very friendly, very friendly. He would come. He would sleep. He would\nleave, but this was his room. He had the keys to the apartment.",
        "Q: So, he didn\u2019t eat at your house?",
        "A: This I don\u2019t recollect. I don\u2019t recollect him eating in the house. Maybe in the kitchen\nor so. I don\u2019t recollect this in the dining room. I don\u2019t recollect this, but we also had\nto \u2014 we could no longer have sleep-ins.",
        "Q: What does that - Do you mean with other people coming in?",
        "A: Well sleep-ins, I mean, because nobody was permitted to be a housekeeper.",
        "Q: Ah, I see what you mean, right. So, you don\u2019t have a housekeeper.",
        "A: No more staff, no, but a woman Fenya, this woman who didn\u2019t sleep-in but always\ncome in to work. She kept on coming to clean up the apartment.",
        "Q: And, that was okay?",
        "A: That was still okay, yes.",
        "Q: So, who started cooking, your mother?",
        "A: Good question. I remember one incident \u2014 no, I think 1t was Stepha, no, Fenya who\ndid some of the cooking, but I remember one incident in the morning when we lived\nin the new apartment, and I had to go to school, my mother would prepare the\nbreakfast for me and said, \u201cLet\u2019s do it very, very quickly, and we\u2019ll eat in the\nkitchen.\u201d And, I said to her, \u201cI\u2019m not a maid.\u201d",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, I said to her, and I remember that very distinctly, and my mother reminded me\nof this after the war. It seemed funny to eat in the kitchen, and this brings back a very\nfunny story. My father had a cousin in Libau, Rabinovitz, whose two sons\nlived here in the United States. One son used to accompany a musician. He had\nCarnegie Hall in 1925 so on and so forth until died, I think in 1929 if my\nmemory serves me right. And, then he became a big here in Hollywood\nplaying behind mostly the piano. And, in 1936 or 1937, he came to Libau and begged\nhis mother to come and live with him in Hollywood, leave Latvia, and he said,\n\u201cMother, I\u2019m going to build you a house with a Hollywood kitchen where you can eat\nin the kitchen.\u201d She said, \u201cEat in the kitchen? For this I should move to America?\u201d To\ngive you just an anecdote, but the mentality.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. \u201cEat in the kitchen? For this I should move to America?\u201d",
        "Q: Funny.",
        "A: Yeah, and that reminded me of my little incident.",
        "Q: Yes, and you were a kid?",
        "A: I was a kid, yeah.",
        "Q: Right. So is there a significant change when you had to move to the smaller\napartment, or do things pretty much stay okay?",
        "A: Well, 1t was much, much smaller the apartment. My father was working. He saw\nprivate patients, but could not use his X-rays or his laboratory, et cetera. That was all\ngone. Did we starve? Food became more scarce. Let\u2019s say a person could not buy\nmore than, let\u2019s say a pound of sugar per month. I\u2019m thinking of an arbitrary-",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -figure, but I do remember if we wanted to have meat, it also became scarce, and our\nnew apartment was not far from the marketplace, and every person could buy so\nmuch and so much meat. So, I went online to buy a pound or a kilo or half a kilo, I\ndon\u2019t remember, and I paid. So, we had \u2014 and, my mother went online. So, that\nbetween the two of us, we were able to buy enough for a sumptuous meal. To give\nyou just one idea.",
        "Q: So, there wasn\u2019t a restriction in terms of a family. It was a restriction per person.",
        "A: It was. I remember this very distinctly, yes, per person. So, therefore, my mother went\nprobably an hour later or so, and I went at nine. I don\u2019t know what time it was, at ten\nor she went at twelve, whatever.",
        "Q: But, none of these restrictions were because you were Jewish?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: This is-",
        "A: Everyone.",
        "Q: Everybody\u2019s in the same situation.",
        "A: Yes, everybody\u2019s in the same situation, yes. Everybody was in the same situation.",
        "Q: Now, are you beginning \u2014 forget the Jewishness part for a moment \u2014 but, are you\nbeginning to feel the harshness of what war means, and what occupation means, or is\nthis you think because they\u2019re communists and so-",
        "A: They\u2019re communists and we were vitriolicly anti-communist, and in my class, almost\neveryone joined the Communist Pioneers. I did not because we belonged to the\n\u201cBourgeois Class\u201d and we were \u2014 the class was being lambasted all the time. And, we\nwere scared, but nothing seemed to happen, nothing happened until one week before\nthe outbreak of the war.",
        "Q: In 1941?",
        "A: \"41, exactly one week before the outbreak of the war, on Sunday, suddenly Russian\ntrucks appeared all over the city telling you you have to pack your things and leave.\nWe'll take you to Russia. We didn\u2019t know whether we would be taken, too, but a lot\nof the well-to-do people, a lot of the Jews, also Latvians, but proportionally more\nJews than Latvians, were taken and shipped off to Siberia and to that part of the world\nin cattle cars, and this was just one week, exactly the Sunday before the outbreak of\nthe war between Russia and Germany.",
        "Q: Now, when you say that you were \u2014 and I\u2019m assuming you mean the family \u2014 was\nvitriolicly anti-Communist, is that what you believed about the Communists or is that\nbecause the Communists saw you as Bourgeois and would not accept you? Or, was it\nboth?",
        "A: I think it was both. I think it was both. Again, I can\u2019t be a hundred percent certain, but\nI just know we were anti-Communist, and it was my decision not to join the youth\nmovement. Again, my parents didn\u2019t say anything that I had to or so. My father felt\nprobably significantly secure again because of his specialty as a gastroenterologist,\nnot to be too worried, but still, and also the fact that he had prominent Russians now\nfrom the Russian Army and the Russian Navy as patients.",
        "Q: And, let me ask you something \u2014 1s part of the reason also that you didn\u2019t want to join\nnot just ideological but the fact that they were also very disciplined and you were\ngoing to be indoctrinated on certain things, or you just didn\u2019t agree with them?",
        "A: I just didn\u2019t agree with them, and I didn\u2019t \u2014 at that time, I tried to intuit myself into\nthat situation. At that time, I simply thought that Communism was wrong. Why? I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: See? Of course, we were chased out of our apartment, but in contrast to the other\nones, we were permitted to stay there another month or two, but I do remember my\nmother complaining, \u201cHow are we ever going to live in a six room apartment?\u201d",
        "Q: Right. That included a kitchen, right? (laughs)",
        "A: It was the library, living room, dining room, two bedrooms, I had to double up with\nmy brother, and in order to get into the \u2014 not into the, we had different \u2014 the toilet was\nin a different part of the apartment from the bathroom, and my parents to take a bath,\nthey had to go through our bedroom, my brother\u2019s and my bedroom. So, there was not\nthis privacy. So, wait a second, in Europe we don\u2019t call the kitchen a room, or the\nmaid\u2019s room.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: No, so, actually to us, the library, living room, dining room, two bedrooms \u2014 five, and\nthere was a kitchen \u2014 six, and the maid\u2019s room, actually seven, seven rooms, but it\nwas \u2014 and the rooms were much smaller than we had originally. A little footnote\nabout this. I was persuaded by \u2014 I don\u2019t know if the name means anything \u2014 Per\nAhlmark, Per Ahlmark former Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, played a very big\nrole in Jewish life since the \u201870s, \u201880s \u2014 very pro-Israel, very pro-Jewish, convinced\nElie to go back tos and accompanied Elie to \u2014_ and wrote about it for the\nSwedish press. It was he who persuaded me to go back and accompanied me too, and\nwrote a series of articles in the Swedish press about my return to Libau. Before we\nwent into any of my apartments where I lived in Riga and Libau in 1990. We had the\nPresident\u2019s car and one his \u2014 another one his drivers, and also one of his deputies so\nwe could get into any apartment. I said, \u201cPer, before we go into any of these\napartments, from the outside I will tell you exactly the layout so you will not think\nthat I\u2019m imaging or inventing certain things.\u201d Later on he told me, \u201cGeorge, I\u2019ve\nnever seen anybody who has such a memory\u201d, because I was precise on every single\nissue. For example, before I went into the apartment, I said to him, \u201cWe had central\nheating.\u201d You see? And, I told him exactly where it is, and I showed it to him which\nwas still preserved. In Riga too where I used to stay with my aunt in a very luxurious,\nlarge apartments. At that time in 1990, my aunts, she was the only person. She had an\natrium apartment. There were about three or four families living, and I showed him in\nthe room where I used to sleep, et cetera, dining room, living room, sitting room,\nlibrary, et cetera. He said, \u201cYou know this memory\u2019s absolutely\u201d because, I found \u2014\neverything I found to be fascinating, the big world. Now, I heard these talks about\nwhen my parents talked when they were in Paris and Berlin and went to the cabarets,\nthis and that. That\u2019s what I wanted to do, and my aunt with whom I stayed, she was\nmarried to the Chinese envoy to Germany who died in 1935. Whose father was\nalready ambassador in the days of Bismarck, the Germany, and when she would talk\n\u2014and so I always thought of foreign policy. I didn\u2019t know what it was, but the\nlifestyle, I just loved it. I ate it all up, et cetera. The diplomatic life, what my mother\nwould tell me about when they were in Berlin in the \u201820s, what was going on so on\nand so forth. For example, my mother loved to go in the subways. She said, \u201cI came\nhere in order to see Berlin.\u201d My father had lived in Berlin because he had studied\nthere. \u201cI want to see Berlin. I go by bus.\u201d My aunt said, \u201cBut you have my car with a\ndriver. What\u2019s the matter with you, Clara?\u201d My mother said, \u201cNo, I am going to go in\nthe subway. I am going to go in the elevator. I\u2019m going to go in the buses. I want\u201d\nShe looked at her as if she was crazy, and it turned out later on, and my aunt told me\nthat my mother knew Berlin better than she knew it.",
        "Q: She did.",
        "A: Yes, because this aunt had survived and died in Riga about 20 years ago.",
        "Q: But, your memory of some of the details of what an apartment looks like is \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow. It doesn\u2019t seem typical to me that you as such a young child would have such\nvery vivid memory of these rooms and the layout.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s really something.",
        "A: And, Per, as I said, who is very often speaks at Jewish events in the United States and\nin Israel, as I said, and very close to Ellie, and he comes with me all the time, every\ntime I go back to Latvia, or almost every time. He has been with me.",
        "Q: And 1990 was the first time?",
        "A: 1990 was the first time, yes, and I think we had sent you some \u2014 Sheila sent you some\nmaterial on this.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Of my first visit, how Per convinced me to go.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s Per.",
        "Q: Yes. OOkay, we\u2019re going to have to change the tape again.\nEnd of Tape 3\nTape 4",
        "Q: George, just to go back for a moment, you\u2019ve referred to someone named Elie quite\noften. So, I assume you\u2019re meaning Elie Wiesel",
        "A: Correct, Elie Wiesel.",
        "Q: Because otherwise some people may not know who it is. Did you go to school when\nthe Russians were occupying?",
        "A: Yes, and it was for one year, but I still went to school, and that\u2019s when I really failed\nall the subjects.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s when you failed?",
        "A: Yeah, and war was kind of a relief for me when it broke out. The first thing that came\nto my mind is, \u201cI will no longer have to go to school.\u201d",
        "Q: To school.",
        "A: Yeah. Wait a second. Yeah, that was the year.",
        "Q: That was the year.",
        "A: That was the year.",
        "Q: Did your father have to acquire some military status during this period of time when\nthe Russians came?",
        "A: Not in uniform, but when the war broke out, we could not run to Russia because it\nwould have been considered desertion. It was considered that he had to be on the spot\nfor his duties.",
        "Q: So, does this mean that when people were told they could leave Latvia a couple of\nweeks or a week before-",
        "A: No, the week before the outbreak of the war, these were the so-called \u201cmass\ndeportations\u201d",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You could\u2019ve left then?",
        "A: With the mass deportations? No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No. These were forced deportations. The trucks arrived. \u201cFamily X \u2014 we\u2019re looking\nfor A, B, C, D\u2014 Family X you have to be packed what you can carry with you in two\nhours, and we\u2019re taking you to Russia to work, work camp. You\u2019re a Bourgeoisie.\nThat is you belong to the Bourgeois class.\u201d And, that was that. And, proportionally\nmany more Jews were sent out than Latvians because he Jews were in certain of the\nprofessions, and also in many of the businesses.",
        "Q: I see, and that was your father\u2019s status as being a doctor?",
        "A: That was our interpretation at the time.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: That was our interpretation.",
        "Q: And, what is the major religion in Latvia.",
        "A: Lutheran.",
        "Q: Lutheran?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Huh. Now, is your brother taken in to be part of the army? I mean, he\u2019s now what 18\nyears, 19 years old?",
        "A: He just graduated gymnasium, and before the war the talk was after he would\ngraduate gymnasium, of course, you couldn\u2019t send him to Germany to study at the\nuniversity. So, they were going to send him to England. Why to England especially\nCambridge? Chemistry. He had some inclination in that direction. So, they figured\nthat he would end up in England studying Chemistry. My mother later on told me that\nbefore Hitler came to power, it was assumed that we would \u2014 the kids \u2014 would study\nat one of the German universities.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But, certainly, England, the talk of England came in only later on when Hitler was\nalready in power that they would not be able to send him to study in Germany.",
        "Q: Now, during the Russian occupation, though, your father isn\u2019t earning a lot of money,\nreally. The money that he has possessed, that the family had, was not confiscated as\nfar as you know.",
        "A: Well, my mother told me that we had withdrawn a large sum of money before the\nRussian occupation occurred from the bank, a considerable amount, but not\neverything should be suspicious, so only a part. And, we were able to exchange some\nof it into Rubles, but there were price controls in the Russian period. So, if you made\n30 Rubles, you had to pay the rent maybe with three Rubles or four Rubles, but\nmoney was not an issue and wasn\u2019t \u2014 and I remember the snickers about the 30\nRubles that he was making, or 35 Rubles perhaps, but it was very low. It was in the\n30s I remember, but it didn\u2019t matter to us personally.",
        "Q: Right. So, are you \u2014 1s there any apprehension that there\u2019s going to be a war coming\nto Latvia, that the Germans will do something that this won\u2019t stay-",
        "A: No, no because according to the Ribbentrop Molotov Pact, Latvia and Estonia and a\ngood part of Lithuania fell under the Russian sphere of influence and subsequently\noccupation, and that Germans would not dare attack Russia. This behemoth for as\nlong as the war still is going on in the West. So, there were no fears of war.",
        "Q: So, this deportation, this mass forced deportation, you think it had nothing to do with\nthe Russians thinking there\u2019s going to be a war. They just did it.",
        "A: That\u2019s a very good question, and that\u2019s still being speculated about. Stalin and\nMolotov were convinced, and I\u2019m not talking now as a child. I\u2019m talking about with\nmy knowledge as an academic, where convinced that there would be no war with\nRussia \u2014 with Germany at this time. The lower downs believed that there will be\nbecause the Germans were sending spy planes all the time. In fact, the week before \u2014\ntwo weeks before the outbreak or three weeks before the outbreak, we could see\nplanes very, very high up.",
        "Q: And, could you see them?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You could?",
        "A: You could see them, yes which we assumed were not Russian planes.",
        "Q: But, nevertheless, you weren\u2019t \u2014 the people you were around were not suspicious.\nYou wouldn\u2019t be.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You were too young.",
        "A: We were not suspicious. That was elsewhere, the war, not \u2014 it would not come to the\nBaltics. We did not like the Russians, but in comparison, of course, the Russians were\nthe lesser evils.",
        "Q: They still were the lesser evils even to you.",
        "A: Yes. Well, the point is, later on in comparison to the Nazis.",
        "Q: Ah, okay.",
        "A: Yeah, but we were, the family was together. We really did not starve. We were not\nsent out. Friends of ours were deported, yes, but my aunts and uncles in Riga were\nnot deported. So, by and large, by and large, we were satisfied. Of course, the press\nwas a controlled press. My parents now spoke much more often in Russian in front of\nme for fear that I should not go to school and say something anti-Communist, and\nthen be arrested because a child had said something. I sensed it of course, and I\nresented the fact that my parents did not trust me, and that was probably one of the\nreasons I did not join the Russian Youth Movement, the Young Pioneers because\neverything was now hush-hush at home for fear that I may squeal because I was a\nchild.",
        "Q: Right. So, you think you didn\u2019t join partly because you felt?",
        "A: Yes, because I was vitriolicly anti-Communist like my parents, and I sensed it at\nhome, what I overheard, what I understood from their Russian, et cetera, I kept my\nmouth shut, but nevertheless, they had to be cautious. I understand. I understand it\nnow. I didn\u2019t understand it at the time obviously.",
        "Q: Now, what language were you speaking in primarily now since before the Russians\ncome you\u2019re speaking primarily German.",
        "A: I continued to speak German with my parents, yes.",
        "Q: You did? With you parents?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And in the street, with the kids?",
        "A: It was Latvian.",
        "Q: Was it Latvian?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And, could you speak a little Russian with the Russian soldiers that you-",
        "A: Yes, oh, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And, this is not a harsh occupation except for the forced? Or was it a harsh, maybe it\nwas?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it was a harsh occupation before the deportations. Freedom of the press,\nof course, was curtailed. Harsh from the viewpoint of physical harm, no, until the\ndeportation, yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I\u2019ve read that people were arrested for anti-Communist, anti-Bolshevik statements, so\non and so forth. Yes, we heard about this, but the immediate circle, our immediate\ncircle, as I understood it at the time, was not affected.",
        "Q: Something radically different happens in 1941, however.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember the move into Latvia by the Germans?",
        "A: Very well, I remember the outbreak of the war very well. Actually, what happened,\nthe war, the Germans invaded on a Sunday morning, early morning. Saturday night,\nmy parents went to sleep only at three or four because they played cards at our house.\nThere were about six or seven ladies played Gin Rummy, I mean Kunken, and\nsuddenly early in the morning, there was lots of noise, bombs being dropped et cetera\non that Sunday morning, June 22\", of \u2019\u00b041, and now we had a terrace in the rear, a\nbalcony not a terrace, actually only a balcony. And, we all went out to see what\nhappened, and we saw German planes, , flying very low where we could even\nsay hello to the pilots and they sort of winked back at us because it was very low,\nbombing certain parts. We didn\u2019t know what was happening. We turned on the radio,\nno news. The news about the outbreak of the war did not come for hours because the\nRussians were taken by surprise. They didn\u2019t know. Subsequently, I read in the\nhistory books that Stalin thought that 1t was not Hitler behind this, the went\nbehind Hitler\u2019s back because Stalin and Molotov were convinced that the Germans\nwere not going to invade, and now suddenly, they did invade. So, the bombings \u2014 this\nwas very exciting. Again, our building was not hit. It was someplace in the center of\nthe city. I did not immediately see any ruins, but as the Germans were moving closer,\nthey occupied Libau one week after the outbreak of the war. My father took us to the\nhospital which was a little bit outside of the city in a safer neighborhood, and we\nstayed there for a couple of days until the Germans came in. But, during the\nbombardment, we also stayed one night in a basement in the center of the city in a\nkind of a policlinic, a small hospital, and there I saw a lot of the destruction already,\nand that became to dangerous to stay there in the center of the city because this was\nbeing bombarded by the German Navy and subsequently by the Army. So, we moved\nto the larger hospital outside the city \u2014 well, it still was in the city district, but in the\nresidential area right near the beach, and I distinctly remember when the Germans\narrived, the Latvian doctors asked my father to accompany them to \u201cwelcome the\nGermans\u201d with roses, et cetera, and my father went and asked about the Jews and the\nLieutenant in the car, and I remember him coming back saying the Jews have nothing\nto worry about. We now have a common foe, and we must fight this common foe and\nthe Jews are part of this war. In the naivety, fighting if you fight together we\u2019re\ncivilized Germans, not racists, et cetera. Like in World War I, if you fight\nCommunism, fine and good, and he was sort of assured, and in a certain naivety, he\nbelieved and made us rather believe that we have nothing to worry about, or maybe\nhe just wanted to keep us calm as could be the case.",
        "Q: So, how did you feel that he asked the Germans this question?",
        "A: He came back.",
        "Q: And he told you what he asked them?",
        "A: Yeah, he told us and my brother, my mother and me et cetera, yes, and we all\nlistened, et cetera. There was a kind of a command car that appeared and he was part\nof the welcoming committee that he was asked to participate, and in this context he\nasked about the Jewish question, and he was assured by this officer.",
        "Q: That everything would be okay.",
        "A: That, Yeah.",
        "Q: Is this as if your father either knew nothing or paid no attention to what was\nhappening to Jews in Germany\u201d? Did you have any idea?",
        "A: Originally, I\u2019m convinced. Again, this is my interpretation that he did not genuinely\nbelieve my aunt when she said-",
        "Q: What had happened.",
        "A: -what had happened with the Germans with the Jewish women polishing the cars with\nfurs. Later on, my interpretation again, is that he did not want to worry the family. So,\nhe always looked at the glass half full rather than half empty. That\u2019s my\ninterpretation.",
        "Q: Is it possible that he never asked the Germans this? He simply told you this so you\u2019d\nfeel okay.",
        "A: I would \u2014 it could very well be the case. It could very well be the case, and then\nafterwards the same day, we took our baggage and we walked back to the apartment,\nand the house was still standing and we saw the German occupiers on the street and\nthey left us alone. We left them alone. I remember staring at them, and then we went\nback to the apartment.",
        "Q: The same apartment, the smaller apartment?",
        "A: Yes, but in the meantime we had also heard that a number of Jews were shot by\nLatvians because the Latvians were also vitriolicly anti-Communist, and in some of\nthe German propaganda that leaked through, I guess, the Germans equated\nBolshevism with Judaism so on and so forth. So, apparently, some people were shot\neven before, just before the German occupation took place in Libau.",
        "Q: So, how long is it when things become rougher and it\u2019s no longer the same life for\nyou?",
        "A: Almost immediately.",
        "Q: Almost immediately?",
        "A: Almost immediately. I remember my father having to go to a gathering place every\nmorning to be assigned for work. My father wore his red cross arm band. My brother\ngoing to work. A cousin of mine was shot dead by the Germans apparently, he had\njust married a Latvian girl before. She was pregnant, but I was lead to understand that\nShe also had a lover, and I was lead to understand that she denounced him as a Jew\nand he was shot and my father was called on to go to the cemetery to identify the\nbody, and he came back to the house and I was there, pale saying, \u201cYes it was\nwho was shot dead.\u201d He identified the body, and that was about a week to ten days\nafter the occupation, and it was not long thereafter when my father was arrested,\ntortured and killed, yes. So, we immediately began to feel it, almost immediately,\nwithin days I would say, yes.",
        "Q: And, when you saw that your father coming back, it must have been very shocking to\nyou to see him looking-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: He must have looked awful.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Then, I no longer thought in terms of me and the IJ, et cetera. I\nbegan thinking in terms of the larger picture that is our fate, no longer my school. I\nmean, this became irrelevant. It was not even a footnote in my life. Now, the issue\nbecame life and death.",
        "Q: And, you\u2019re ten years old.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: About ten.",
        "A: Yeah. Nine and a half at the time now.",
        "Q: So, the quick relief of \u201cI don\u2019t have to go to school.\u201d",
        "A: Oh, that-",
        "Q: Was all finished.",
        "A: That was finished. That was finished, yes.",
        "Q: So, do you have trouble sleeping now when you\u2019re-",
        "A: Now?",
        "Q: No, I don\u2019t mean now. I\u2019m sorry, now meaning at the point.",
        "A: At the point, I don\u2019t remember having trouble sleeping. I slept. I lead an active life in\nso far as I kept up with the news, the latest news, what\u2019s happening all the gossip, the\ndangers, by the time the evening came around, I assume I was exhausted. I was still a\nkid. So, I seemed to sleep very well. My mother was assigned to go to work, and\nsometimes she was able to take me with her. This was she was kind of a seamstress,\nironing. I remember her doing working in, I guess it must have been a laundry. If I\nthink of it today, for the German Air Force in Libau. She was, and then at a certain\npoint, she became the housekeeper, maid for the mistress, for the Latvian mistress for\nthe head of the in Libau, and my mother knew her from before the war because\nthey used to meet at the same hairdressers called Mary\u2019s. I still remember. This\nmistress apparently had a liking, took a liking to my mother, and sent a long to the\nghetto, but this was already in the ghetto period. But, before the ghetto period already,\nextra food and when she knew that things were going to happen to Jews, she would\ntell my mother, \u201cYou better bring George with you to the apartment.\u201d So, I would\nstay for the day at the apartment safe when my mother was cleaning or whatever, yes.\nBut, things became in a sense chaotic, but there was within this chaos, there was still\norder.",
        "Q: How \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether at the time you would know, but perhaps only\nafterwards when you talked with your mother, how did she take to doing this? She\nwas never doing this sort of work in the house. So, all of a sudden, she\u2019s acting as\nsomeone\u2019s maid and she\u2019s ironing and she\u2019s-",
        "A: She said to me circumstances dictate what you have to do. She took it very stoically.\nShe took it very \u2014 but, she \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen my mother in tears before. I\u2019ve never\nseen my mother in a state of hysteria. When my father was arrested, she ran all over\nthe place to her Latvian colleagues who did not raise a finger for my late father. Some\nof the Latvian doctors, I guess you know jealousy, professional jealousy whatever,\nbut nothing unusual. They didn\u2019t raise a finger even though it was an issue of life and\ndeath. She went to the pleading for my father. She left no stone unturned, and\nat a certain point was told by the man who really killed my father that he\u2019ll be\nreleased but a wound has to heal, that guy apparently knocked out one of his eyes,\nand was told that they really needed him because of his specialty, but the wound\nnever healed. So, they didn\u2019t want to release him in that condition. So, they decided\nto shoot him instead.",
        "Q: And, that you heard later?",
        "A: That I heard later, but a patient, a Latvian patient of my father\u2019s came with the news\nthat his eye was knocked out. He heard it from I guess a Latvian guard in the prison\nor whatever, and I\u2019ve also heard it from his fellow prison inmates, Jews who were\nlater on liberated or I saw later, what happened to my father because they were\neyewitnesses.",
        "Q: Do you remember the day your father was arrested or weren\u2019t you home?",
        "A: He didn\u2019t come home. It was toward the end of July 1941, yeah.",
        "Q: So, he was working in the hospital?",
        "A: He was not working 1n the hospital at that time, no.",
        "Q: Or, he was doing forced labor, I guess.",
        "A: Yes, but as a doctor, as a doctor he was doing this. This was the end of July, and then\nhe was shot.",
        "Q: So, how did you understand this as a young child?",
        "A: Horrified, absolutely horrified, and you didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t understand. I didn\u2019t\nunderstand why we had to suffer simply because being Jewish. I hardly knew what it\nmeant before the war. As I said, I knew I was a Jew. I knew about Matza, Passover,\nabout certain High Holidays, or when my mother and father fasted, or turning on\ncandles commemorating the dead, et cetera, but otherwise I really did not know much\nabout the significance.",
        "Q: So, there\u2019s no logic here for you. I mean, nothing makes-",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And, even if the-",
        "A: What the logic was I\u2019m suffering because I\u2019m a Jew, but I didn\u2019t understand why I\nhad to suffer because I\u2019m a Jew.",
        "Q: Right. Then, how do you understand death and murder?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t analyze it. I did not, but I remember later on thinking \u2014 initially, I did not\nwant to die, but later on after Stalingrad, et cetera, I did not mind. I thought myself\nbecause I know that the Germans are going to be defeated.",
        "Q: So, you didn\u2019t mind the thought that you might die?",
        "A: Yeah, I did no longer mind it.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: To see Germany destroyed, that was it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. Because I remember in the severe winter, well \u2014 I remember in maybe it\u2019s later\nit\u2019s been cut now.",
        "Q: No, you have another minute.",
        "A: I remember it was a very severe winter, 1941-42, where I got frostbite in Libau,\nfrostbite on my toes and my fingers, thinking perhaps if the Germans would win the\nwar, there would no longer be a reason to punish Jews for whatever reason, and\nthings would get better. So, for a moment, I even thought, however perverse it may\nsound today, but as a child, perhaps the Germans should win and then we will be\nrelieved of this misery, of this uncertainty.",
        "Q: So, confusion reigns in some ways.",
        "A: Confusion reigns, but death was there.",
        "Q: Yeah. Okay, think we have to stop now.\nEnd of Tape 4\nTape 5",
        "Q: Okay, George, I understand that you know something about the circumstances under\nwhich your father was arrested at the marketplace. Am I correct?",
        "A: Yes, he went to work to the gathering place in Libau where the Jews were gathered\nand then the Germans would transport them to their outfits, and he saw the\ntrucks approaching, and he began to make signs to the people on the square, in other\nwords, to disperse, and this was noticed by the SS people, and they beat him up\nterribly and threw him onto one of the trucks, and he among others were taken to the\nprison. That\u2019s where he continued to be tortured. That\u2019s where apparently his eye was\nknocked out, and apparently he was going around looking for his eye, et cetera, and\ncouldn\u2019t find it, and begged \u2014 this is from eye witnesses that we have \u2014 begged to be\nshot, but they kept him alive.",
        "Q: Tell me how you remember your mother was during this period.",
        "A: She \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen her before crying or being hysterical.",
        "Q: But she was?",
        "A: She was absolutely hysterical when it happened. She would say our our dad, our\ndaddy, how are we going on from here? We must do everything possible to rescue\nhim, and she started running around and we still had some hidden diamonds and gold\ncoins so on and so forth, and she bribed some of the Latvian colleagues especially one\nwho used to be a neighbor of ours, Dr. , aneighbor of ours when we lived in\nthe \u2014 before the Russians came in, in the same. There were two apartments to the\nsame floor and he lived in one of them. And, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d She\nwent to some other Latvian colleagues. They said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s really nothing we\ncan do or help or say.\u201d She then went to the , but I don\u2019t think she did give\nanything to the people in terms of gold coins or diamonds, et cetera. It would\u2019ve\nbeen much too dangerous, and there was this one person who apparently knocked out\nmy father\u2019s eye, Handtke who was tried after World War II in Hamburg where\napparently I have the transcripts where this whole issue was brought up. He defended\nhimself. I don\u2019t remember the details from the transcripts, and he finally said to my\nmother after several days, \u201cYes, we\u2019re going to release your husband once the\nwound\u201d some sort of wound \u201che has will be healed, but the wound never healed so\nthey decided to shoot him instead.\u201d",
        "Q: And, how long did it take before she found out that he was dead?",
        "A: The first news as I remember, came from a former Latvian patient of my father\u2019s who\ncame to visit us with the news that he had heard, and then also some of the people\nwho were arrested together with him, some of them were released who saw it, and\nothers were also shot relatively speaking at the same time.",
        "Q: And, did your mother then become very practical about trying to figure out how to\nhelp the three of you survive together?",
        "A: She relied heavily on my older brother who had leadership qualities which she did not\nreally, nor of course I, as a child. So, she relied very much on my brother, and\ntogether with whatever help I could give, we manipulated the situation to the best of\nour knowledge.",
        "Q: Your brother is about twenty years old in 1941. Am I correct?",
        "A: He was about nineteen.",
        "Q: Nineteen?",
        "A: Nineteen, yes.",
        "Q: And, your mother, must have been-",
        "A: In \u00b041, she was born in 1903. Thirty, 23, 33, 43 \u2014 38.",
        "Q: Thirty-eight?",
        "A: Thirty-eight.",
        "Q: So, very young woman.",
        "A: Yeah, and she was obviously spoiled from her old home, and my father spoiled her\nvery much. So, she was not very street smart or anything of the sort, but it 1s\nsometimes the circumstances that forge an individual, yes.",
        "Q: So, does she now go to work?",
        "A: Yes, was forced to go-",
        "Q: Was forced, right.",
        "A: To go to work, and then after working for a while with the Air Force in Libau, -\nLibau, that\u2019s where the was, the war port, where I occasionally went along.\nThen, she was taken by the former mistress \u2014 by the mistress, the then mistress of the\nhead of the Gestapo, this Latvian woman, her name was Mrs. Krohnberg and I was\nled to understand that after the war, she managed to get to Canada and she died in\nCanada about ten, fifteen years ago or so.",
        "Q: Kronberg",
        "A: Krohnberg, in Latvian I guess it would, the husband would be the Krohnbergs in\nLatvian it would be Krohnberga, for the woman.",
        "Q: Now, is this before the ghetto?",
        "A: This was before the ghetto, yes.",
        "Q: In Libau.",
        "A: In Libau. Yes.",
        "Q: So, your mother has a couple of jobs, and are you still living in that smaller\napartment?",
        "A: No, in the meantime, several times we had to move. We moved in to one apartment\nnear my school for a short time. Let me get the sequence straight. Oh, my \u2014 we\nmoved into the servant quarters of the Kessel Villa, K-e-s-s-e-l, because my brother\nmarried the daughter, but this was already a war marriage, had no legal validity to the\nbest of my knowledge. So, the front part was occupied, the main part of the villa was\noccupied by Mrs. Stein who was Latvian. Her husband was Jewish. So, she lived\nthere with a daughter, and Mr. Stein, the Kessel\u2019s \u2014 the husband was already killed,\nMrs. Kessel and her two daughters, and my brother and I and my mother, we lived\nbehind the building what used to be known as the servant\u2019s quarters. We lived there\nfor a while until we had to move from there and moved to another quarter which was\nnear my school where we were in three rooms \u2014 one, two, three. We were one \u2014 my\nbrother and his newly acquired wife, myself \u2014 we lived, slept in one room. My mother\nslept in another room, another woman \u2014 Mrs. Boop slept in a room that was in Mrs.\nBoop\u2019s apartment. Yes, she was killed during the war, and two young women slept in\nanother room. So we were about six or seven people in this small apartment of about\nfour or five rooms, excluding the kitchen. And, from there, well an announcement\ncame that we will be moved to a ghetto \u2014 we\u2019ll have to move to a ghetto which is in a\npart of Libau, a section of Libau that I did not know very well, and there in the ghetto\nthis was in the summer of \u201943, we were assigned to a flat in a basement that had a\nkind of an outhouse, the toilet was a few steps \u2014 we had to go about five or six steps,\nright off the entrance, rear entrance of the building, and there including the kitchen\nthere were one, two, three rooms. So, two rooms and where people could sleep. In\nthese two rooms, my brother and his wife, and my mother and I slept, in this\nbasement apartment, and in the other room there were about four people who slept,\nand we shared the same toilet. We shared the bathroom, the bathing facilities, and we\nmade the best of this situation. I was working for a while in the ghetto in the garden,\nvegetable garden, and then I was \u201casked, invited\u201d to become the commandant\u2019s\nrunner in the Libau ghetto. The commandant was not a bad person actually, Kerscher.\nHe closed his eyes to many things especially when people brought 1n some extra food\nto the ghetto. He did not make a big deal out of it, but of course, we also managed to\ngive him things that is not only the Schwabs but other people with means before the\nwar who had saved a gold coin here, a diamond there, a fur coat, whatever, gave it to\nhim, and this reminds me even before we moved into the ghetto, there were\ncollections of gold coins. This in order to try to release Jews from the prison to bribe\nthe Germans, et cetera. So, this was \u2014 I remember people coming around for specific\narrests that were made and collecting, because we were told if we gathered this and\nthis and this and this, we would be able to get that person out of prison and so on and\nso forth. But, this brings me back to before the ghetto, way before the ghetto.\nImmediately after the revolution in 1917, Lenin needed hard currency, and opened up\nthe palaces. You could buy everything and anything for very little money. And, we\nhad antique \u2014 an antique for example living room that came from one of the Czarist\npalaces. We had a chandelier a cobalt with gold chandelier that came from one of the\npalaces that my grandparents bought and some of it gave to my father as a gift after\nWorld War I, immediately, and some that my father bought including some art works\nfrom famous Russian artists that he bought when he was serving in Russia, and right\nafter the revolution that he bought and brought it back to Latvia. So, in addition to the\nPersian carpets and the Grand piano, et cetera, this was very exclusive furniture that\nwe had from Czarist palaces including a number of chandeliers. I remember two in\nparticular, and all this was taken by the Germans before we came even to the ghetto.\nAnd, not only the German , but also the German Navy. There was a certain\nInspector Ulmann of the German Navy. Incidentally, the old \u2014 where we lived before\nWorld War I, the building that became the headquarters of the Communist Party\nduring World War II became the headquarters of the German Navy for the region,\nand this Inspector Ulmann came very often to our apartment, and with a crew would\ntake a lot of the things from the apartment, and then of course, we also had people\nfrom the \u2014__s coming with their crews to take, and there was one guy fromthe\nby the name of Strott, S-t-r-o-t-t, who was a collector of stamps, and my late brother\nhad a huge stamp collection and he traded stamps with all over the world. There was\nactually an exhibition here in Philadelphia in memoriam for my brother, a big stamp\ncollection, where it is all described and I have a photograph with my late mother, still.\nShe was already sick and we went to Philadelphia. This must have be in 1963, when\nthere was this big exhibition in Philadelphia. And, he took, and I\u2019m sure he took it for\nhimself because he was an art collector, and then we had to two Leica cameras, one\nGerman and one Russian Leica, I remember, and we gave one of them to one of the\nLatvians who came to the house to look for things. I think, and I would have to\nestablish this, I\u2019m not sure, but one of the Latvians was a notorious murderer by the\nname of Cukurs. He had several fingers missing. I don\u2019t know how come, but I\nremember fingers were missing, and for some reason I associate him with the name\nCukurs who was a deputy to Arias, the famous Arias, commander of Latvians who\nkilled Jews with a vengeance. And, this man with the fingers came and looked for\nthings, and I remember very distinctly my mother giving him one of the Leicas\nbecause we had two still hidden in the apartment. This is when we were still living in\nthe apartment to which we moved during the Russian period.",
        "Q: The smaller.",
        "A: Yes, the smaller apartment. So, these are some of the things that suddenly come back\nabout the furniture so on and so forth. Now, how did we get up to this question?",
        "Q: You went back from the ghetto, but I would like to stay in this period for a moment,\nand ask you what was probably a peculiar question. Was there anything like a funeral\nfor your father?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "A: No, we never saw him again.",
        "Q: Because you never-",
        "A: Nothing, never saw him, no, no.",
        "Q: So, did your mother go into mourning in some way?",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t mourn in the sense in those days you would wear black for a whole\nyear, et cetera. This you couldn\u2019t do. There was no way of doing it. You had to go in\nthe morning to work whatever, and then they would come back and in the evening\nhoping to find me still there, alive, et cetera. So-",
        "Q: So, there\u2019s really no time for any-",
        "A: Shiva or so on, no.",
        "Q: There\u2019s no way to do that.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember \u2014 we didn\u2019t even know exactly the date, but this was irrelevant,\nbut I don\u2019t remember a Shiva.",
        "Q: And, do you remember yourself responding in way like your mother because you lost\nyour father, or did you not understand what it really meant to lose your father?",
        "A: I understood. I missed him very much, but I didn\u2019t understand what it meant that he\nwas shot, but then I had some sort of an inkling because when he came home from the\ncemetery where he identified my cousin that the person was suddenly dead, and my\nfather was arrested. What I couldn\u2019t understand 1s that I\u2019Il never see him again. This I\ndo remember, that I may never see him again. This I do remember very, very\ndistinctly, yeah.",
        "Q: How did you \u2014 was there a notice to go into the ghetto?",
        "A: Yes the bekantmachung",
        "Q: And, what is that?",
        "A: The bekantmachung means a kind of an announcement.",
        "Q: So, it was a public announcement?",
        "A: It was a public announcement.",
        "Q: Like a poster?",
        "A: Yes, yes, by that and that date we had to move in, and then we were assigned the\nliving quarters.",
        "Q: So, do you even as a child begin to feel that your life 1s getting more and more\nconstricted, or you have no-",
        "A: Oh, yes, not only this, but I was at a certain point coming to this, even going back\nbefore the ghetto when we had to wear the yellow star and had to deliver our radios\nand other things right after the occupation, and we were not permitted to go on the\nsidewalks as Jews. We could only go right off the sidewalk, and I remember it was in\nthe winter, going and a fellow student, a girl, came in my direction. We were in the\nsame class, and we walked and I wanted to say hello to her, and it happened to be a\ngirl I fancied as a child. Veltina was her name. She sort of looked away, and I felt\nembarrassed that I was a Jew, that I had to wear this and I could not go on the\nsidewalk. It was something strange. Why should I feel embarrassed? But, I remember\nfeeling embarrassed that I am who I am. It\u2019s a very strange sensation that I had, just\nas strange as the same winter when I thought maybe a German victory would be\nhelpful to us. Let the Germans win. Logical, perhaps for a child, but for an adult,\nobviously not.",
        "Q: Did you ever say anything to your mother or your brother that you were embarrassed,\nfelt ashamed?",
        "A: Not in this context, in a different context. The children in the ghetto didn\u2019t like to play\nwith me because I didn\u2019t speak Yiddish. I spoke German, and they used to call me\nkind of a yeke. I did not speak it, and I remember going to my mother crying saying,\n\u201cThe children don\u2019t want to play with me because I don\u2019t speak Yiddish\u2019, and I\nremember my mother saying to me, \u201cGeorge, there\u2019s really nothing I can do about it.\nI don\u2019t speak Yiddish either. We have to make the best of the situation.\u201d And, it 1s in\nthis context that I began to acquire Yiddish because this became the lingual the\naccepted language in camp, et cetera.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So, just like I acquired Russian, I acquired a smattering of Yiddish.",
        "Q: The Jews that you are meeting in the ghetto, were they not of your economic class\nbecause the Russians had sent out most of the Bourgeois?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t send out most of the Bourgeois. They sent out a good number, but I\nassume, but in those days I didn\u2019t think in terms of classes, et cetera. I didn\u2019t think in\nterms \u2014 I didn\u2019t think in these terms, but in retrospect, I would say that they came\nfrom a milieu from which I did not come, period. I mean, that\u2019s how I would put it\nnow.",
        "Q: And, did that make you feel uncomfortable because they were so dissimilar in terms\nof background?",
        "A: No, I felt \u2014 I felt bad that they would not accept me and at the same time, I was\nenvious because they were stronger than I was. They were better athletes than I was.\nIn many ways, they were far superior to me. So, I was envious actually, and they\nspoke Yiddish which I did not. So, I was envious too. But, as a child, you can acquire\nlanguage very easily. So-",
        "Q: So, how quickly did you acquire Yiddish?",
        "A: I guess I still probably have a vocabulary of about 150 or 200 words. So, I could get\nby. In other words, with my limited vocabulary, I could get by, and but also\ninteresting because the Yiddish we speak in the Baltic countries is different from the\nPolish Yiddish. For example, I\u2019m now the Vice President of the Sholom Aleichem\nFoundation even though my Yiddish is almost non-existent as is Belle Kaufman\u2019s\nYiddish almost non-existent, the granddaughter of Sholom Aleichem, who 1s still\nalive at 93 and is our Chairman. When we have the annual meetings of the Sholom\nAleichem meetings in New York commemorating his death because it\u2019s according to\nhis will, when some of the Yiddish actors read his writings in the Polish Yiddish\nespecially in the . Yiddish, I don\u2019t understand 95 percent. If somebody reads it\nwith a Baltic accent, not an accent, but pronunciation, I understand fifty percent\nbecause the Yiddish is more akin to the German. To give you just one example, when\nyou say \u2014 in German you say , 1n the Baltic Yiddish it would be _, and in the\nYiddish it would be ,",
        "Q: So, it\u2019s quite different?",
        "A: Quite different. So, I just I have difficulties with this, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you mother learn Yiddish in the ghetto also?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. This was not a problem for her. It was a problem\nfor-",
        "Q: For you.",
        "A: For me, yes.",
        "Q: I think we need to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape 5\nTape 6",
        "Q: George, let me just go way back for a second just so we get a context for your family.\nI assume that your father did not become very wealthy because he was a doctor in\nLativa, that there was money in the family before.",
        "A: Yes, there was money in the family before, but he also did very well, and I remember\nmy mother telling me that he would come home and take out from his pockets lots of\nmoney saying, \u201cYou have brought me a lot of luck, Clairehen, Claire. Look how well\nI\u2019m doing in my practice.\u201d So, independently of his parents, but my grandfather was a\nbig merchant in the grains \u2014 import and export \u2014 and, we had at least one warehouse\nthat I was aware of with elevators in front of it, railroad tracks, right at the pier,\nbecause he exported a lot to England and elsewhere, but one of my relatives told me\nthat we had another warehouse on the other side of the pier exactly facing it. This I\ndon\u2019t know. Maybe they sold it very early on, but I only knew of the other one\nbecause it was not sold until the late \u201830s, the other one. So, maybe the first one they\ndidn\u2019t bother talking about. But, I did not know until I heard about it over here that\nthere was a second one. Also, to give you a little background, what I found out over\nhere is that when the governor of St. Petersburg came to Libau, he would always\ncome to Libau and play bridge with my grandfather, and they were very good friends,\nbut I would think that the big money came from my grandfather. But, my father did\nvery well in his practice, in his practice, yes.",
        "Q: And, was your mother\u2019s family a well-to-do family also?",
        "A: Not as well-off as my father\u2019s family, but in the six sisters, three brothers, they all\nwent to universities, the three brothers. The six sisters all went to gymnasium, and\nthere you had to pay in those days and music conservatory. My grandfather owned an\nupscale delicatessen store, and my mother tells me he brought home the most\ndelicious things everyday from the delicatessen something like in Paris, and my\ngrandmother, the big money apparently came from my grandmother who came from\nthe Russian city of and her maiden name was . She came from a very,\nvery well-to-do family, and each daughter, and there was a large family, each\ndaughter received a house or a villa as a dowry.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Yeah, so, and she had six sisters and three brothers and all were educated this and that\nso, you had to have some means in order to do this.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And, in my father\u2019s family, the mother of my cousin over here studied at the\nUniversity of Geneva in those days before World War I, and Grenoble in France.",
        "Q: Interesting. It seemed important to get a bit of that background which we didn\u2019t get\nbefore. Now, let\u2019s go back to this not so great situation in the ghetto. How did you\nbecome a runner for the commandant? Do you know?",
        "A: My German was good.",
        "Q: Clearly.",
        "A: Yes, it was my native tongue, maybe I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s an interpretation. Maybe this\nwas one reason why I was \u201cinvited\u201d to become his runner. A second reason perhaps,\nit\u2019s my interpretation again is because I came from a certain background. I don\u2019t\nknow if this played a role, but in addition to being a runner for him - when I would\nhave to, when I would get a pass that nothing should happen to me while I brng a\nwatch which was repaired in the ghetto to, let\u2019s say to or to SS who\nwas the head of the SS in Libau or to Inspector of the . So, and I could\ncommunicate with the staff over there whatever it is in German. Perhaps this 1s a\nreason, but again, as I said before, it\u2019s pure speculation and I do not know the facts.",
        "Q: So, the job that you had to be a runner was primarily going from inside the ghetto\noutside delivering.",
        "A: And, also keeping count of the inmates. When we moved into the ghetto, we had\nsomething like 823 people survived out of community of close to 8,000. And, when \u2014\nin the morning when they left, they were given a tag, a metal tag so I had to give them\nthe metal tags as they went out to work in columns, and in the late afternoon, I had to\ncollect these tags and hang them up. So, I remember the numbers, and you could see\nimmediately if somebody escaped or what. The number, you associated that with a\nname, and that is how you kept tabs.",
        "Q: And, did you have to write down the person to whom you gave the number?",
        "A: No, everyone had his number or her number.",
        "Q: I see. So, that was their number.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was this like? You were a kid doing this work for this German.",
        "A: You didn\u2019t think along those lines. You thought about how to survive in this milieu.\nAt times, we had basketball games arranged. There was a school for children which I\nattended on occasion. It didn\u2019t last very long because we were not very long in the\nghetto. But, by and large, there wasn\u2019t much time for self-reflection. At least, I do\nnot recollect. I do recollect being concerned on how to survive, and under the\ncircumstances, we were still lucky because I had my mother and I had my brother.\nWe lost our father, but there were others who had lost more than just a brother and a\nfather, et cetera. So, in the circumstances, I \u2014 I still felt \u201cgood that I had my brother\nand my mother\u2019.",
        "Q: And, they, I\u2019m assuming, were also working.",
        "A: Working, yes, my mother was working for the ;",
        "Q: Oh, that was where she was working for the ?",
        "A: Yes, and my \u2014 well, she was already working for the way back in 41.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But, for a short time between let\u2019s say August and September and October when she\nwas working for the Air Force because when the big action came, she was already\nworking and December was a very big action, she was already working for the\nmistress because she had the letter from the that we can not be touched. 1S\nwhat we called...",
        "Q: That December of \u00b041.",
        "A: Yeah, \u201941, that was December yeah, were thousands were rounded up and killed in",
        "Q: So, after that there was about a thousand Jews left, I think, or maybe 900 Jews.",
        "A: Well, when we moved into the ghetto in \u201943 there were about 820, yes. I remember\nbecause I was in charge of the big board with the tags. So, I knew how many Jews\ncame into the ghetto and how many-",
        "Q: How many\u201d",
        "A: Yeah, and who stayed in the ghetto because those who stayed in the ghetto I did not\ngive a tag in the morning. So, you could see the people for illness or whatever.",
        "Q: Right. How long are you there in the ghetto?",
        "A: From the summer of \u201943 until \u2014 wait a second \u2014 no, \u201942, summer of \u201942 to October\n\"43 because Yom Kippur was very late that year, and we were shipped to Riga the\nnight of Yom Kippur and there was a song composed by one of the inmates \u201cYom\nKippur Bai Nicht, Als Men Sogt Den Malchet, Gebracht Uns Aher In Kazet\u201d",
        "Q: Could you translate that?",
        "A: Yom Kippur Bai Nicht \u2014 in the eve of Yom Kipper, when one says the Malchet, the\nprayer, Gebracht Uns Aher \u2014 we were brought to Kaiserwald. It\u2019s a very loose\ntranslation from Yiddish.",
        "Q: When you picture being in the ghetto 1n that period of time, do you remember\nwhether people who \u2014 how were people with each other?",
        "A: I must say that with very few exceptions, they were very civil, very polite, but this\nwas our general upbringing in Libau. Later on, I met types I never met before, but in\nLibau, I had not met types, such types before. So, among ourselves, we were very\npolite. We were very well behaved to the best of our ability, and this goes also for the\n\u201cless fortunate\u201d people because I think that even the less fortunate people before the\nwar, there was a common level of behavior that embraced the, I would say, what I\nknew of the Jewish community, but as I proven wrong about saying that there were\nno poor Jews in Latvia, maybe I just didn\u2019t was not in touch with other elements. But,\nafter the war and during the war when I spent with many of them from many other\nlevels, I would say that there was very civilized and \u2014 under the worse circumstances-\ncivilized and cultured approach to things, to human beings, to fellow human beings,\net cetera. You rarely heard of a Libau Jew stealing something from another Libau\nJew, rarely. There were exceptions, and they were caught ant they were punished.\nThis even went on later when we were in the concentration camp. Among ourselves\nwe were very civil, and it didn\u2019t matter whether \u2014 from which class you came. At\nleast, I had not encountered this, and I\u2019m speaking now - strictly speaking from my\nperspective.",
        "Q: And, the _ in the ghetto in Libau, did you know those people?",
        "A: Yes, Mr. Israelit and Mr. Kaganski who was an attorney. I told you the woman in\nCalifornia who should be interviewed, his wife. Yes, I knew them. Mr. Israelit, he\nwas a banker before World War II. He spoke broken German, but was a very nice\nman. I knew his daughter. She was a classmate of my brother\u2019s in the Jewish\ngymnasium. I knew other members of the family, very dignified family. He was the\nnumber one person, and the number two person was this Mr. Kaganski, highly\neducated, very cultured, spoke a very, very good German, very handsome man. We\nhad no problems with our leadership, and I hadn\u2019t heard major complaints about them\nfrom any of the ghetto inmates.",
        "Q: Was there Jewish police also?",
        "A: There was a kind of a Jewish police, but of course they didn\u2019t have weapons or\nanything of the sort, and it was, I believe, this Jewish police had caught two thieves\nstealing things from the store in the ghetto, some bread or so, and they were\nincarcerated, and I just don\u2019t remember know what their fate was. I believe they were\nshot for what they had done. But, this was such a rare exception. It was an exception\nthat this should happen among us Libau Jews. This was sort of almost unheard of.",
        "Q: And, what rumors are you hearing about what\u2019s going on? Through 1942, there\u2019s a\nhuge number of Jews between \u00b041 and the end of \u201942 that are killed that are\nmassacred.",
        "A: Yes, we heard vague stories, but we did not know details, but what we did know,\nthere were technicians among the former Libau Jews who were technicians already\nthen, and they managed some way or other to construct a radio. So, we knew what\nwas going on in the world. We heard about the German defeats at the front, which\nwas wonderful news to us and gave us inspiration, and when we didn\u2019t hear good\nnews or anything, we used to talk about the one says rumors. Rumors about\nhis, et cetera. What are your source? agency says it\u2019s a\nrumor, but it was known as ,",
        "Q: So, were you under the impression, were people under the impression between these\nrumors that one says ant the radio reports that the Nazis were going to lose soon? Was\nthat-",
        "A: Not soon, but that they were going to lose. This was a foregone conclusion after\nespecially Stalingrad, after January 42, and then of course, we heard about the\nfamous Battle of Kursk a tank battle which was later where the Germans were\ndecisively defeated. And, of course in Stalingrad where the German Field Marshal\ngave up, surrendered with something like 90,000 troops. This was vitamins to us,\nreally. I mean we couldn\u2019t have been happier. And, then we also heard about some\nBritish general that was Montgomery chasing the Germans all over Africa until they\nwere thrown out of Africa. This, of course, was very good news, and that the\nGermans were having \u2014 were being beaten not only in the Stalingrad front, but in\nmany parts of the Soviet Union.",
        "Q: So, tell me how you remember who you were? You\u2019re ten, eleven years old, in 1943\nyou're twelve, right? Because you were born in 1931.",
        "A: Yeah, but I was born late.",
        "Q: Late.",
        "A: Yes, so eleven and a half or so, something to that effect.",
        "Q: So, are you more grown up?",
        "A: Well.",
        "Q: Because, you\u2019re still a kid.",
        "A: I\u2019m still a kid. The fact that I didn\u2019t have to study was- (laughs)",
        "Q: I know. (laughs) You thought this was a great-",
        "A: This was a great boom. What did I feel? The essential thing in \u201942-\u201943 when we were\nin the ghetto. It was a, relatively speaking, stable period. We came in 800 some odd\npeople, and we were taken to the concentration camp, roughly the same number. So,\nthere were few killings between the period between the time we got into the ghetto\nand went to Riga Kaiserwald to the concentration camp, but it was still the fear\neveryday.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: You don\u2019t know what to expect, and you always had to be on the lookout, and\nincidentally, something very interesting. Across the street from one of the streets in\nthe ghetto, you had buildings where there were lots and lots of Russian POWs, and\nthey were begging for bread. They had it much worse than we, and we were able to\nthrow them some bread because in the ghetto we still did not really starve.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you that.",
        "A: Yes, we really did not, at least, I don\u2019t think we starved, no because from with our\nLatvian people, we could deal for this. We could get that, and we still had a diamond\nhere, a dollar there, so on and so forth. We could still do business, so to speak. We\ncould still bring in. So, I do not really remember starving. That we had our pre-World\nWar food obviously is not the case or even the food that we had during the Russian\nperiod, but we had enough bread. We had some butter. We had sometimes a piece of\nsalami. We had even sometimes I got hot chocolate. So, I don\u2019t remember starving in\nthe ghetto, let\u2019s put it this way.",
        "Q: But, you remember these Russian POWs starving.",
        "A: Yes, and how we threw bread over the fence. Yes, I do this. I do remember this very\ndistinctly, yes. They were much, much worse off than we were at this particular\nmoment.",
        "Q: And, do you feel as if you lost your childhood, that you respond in some more adult\nway because you had no opportunity to really be a child except perhaps playing some\ngames?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t think in these terms that ve lost my childhood. At that age, I don\u2019t think that\nyou think along these lines, but what is interesting, I think, and I often think about it,\nhow I survived because later on I had to witness hangings so on and so forth because\nI\u2019ve never really seen anybody hang, but this goes to late \u201944 early \u00b045 in Stolp\n. To me, this was a kind of theater. I was observing. I was living. If I were\nto put in today\u2019s terms, I was \u2014 I was an actor in a theater. I was living something\nwhich was not real, and yet it was very real. I was an actor, and at the same time, I\nfelt that I was a spectator, and whatever was going on was interesting to me for better\nor for worse. It was something of an experience \u2014 warped in today\u2019s terms, I would\nsay yes, but again from a child who is ten, eleven, twelve, et cetera, it\u2019s a different\nbecause \u2014 but, this was really my personality before the war. Everything seemed to\ninterest me except school.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if I answered your question.",
        "Q: No, it\u2019s an interesting answer because there\u2019s some ways in which that may account\nfor how good your memory is because you\u2019re observing so much-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And so hard.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And, it\u2019s a kind of schizophrenia.",
        "A: Oh, I wouldn\u2019t be myself.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t mean in mental illness terms.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But, a kind of distance.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Do you think your mother and brother was doing the same thing or wouldn\u2019t you\nknow?",
        "A: I really couldn\u2019t answer because I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Because, I\u2019m just trying to get, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s interesting to try to figure out\nwho you really \u2014 I mean, I can\u2019t see who you were at the age of ten looking at you\nnow, you know, as you speak.

        "Q: With a ten year old child, it\u2019s difficult to visualize a ten year old child, and to try to\nfigure out who he is in those moments, and it must be difficult for you to even explain\nit, but I think-",
        "A: It is difficult, but to me it was a big spectacle that in a strange, I would say today, in a\nwarped way was interesting to observe, and at the same time, I was part of the action\nthat is part of the theater, watching out, when will I be next to be shot?",
        "Q: And, you did think that, \u201cWhen will I be next?\u201d",
        "A: Yeah, because everyone thought so, \u201cwhat will the next day bring?\u201d \u201cWhat will the\nnext minute bring?\u201d yes.",
        "Q: So, in those circumstances you slept okay, too. You didn\u2019t have nightmares. You\ndidn\u2019t have-",
        "A: No, I did not begin to have nightmares until after the war.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember-",
        "Q: When it was safer.",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: When it was safer.",
        "A: When it was safer, yes. I don\u2019t remember having nightmares in the Libau ghetto, no",
        "Q: And, when you were going \u2014 when the Libau ghetto was then liquidated and you were\nthen sent to Kaiserwald, everybody went, the 800 some odd people went, do you\nthink?",
        "A: Some people escaped from the ghetto, and were hidden by Latvians who we call now\nthe Righteous Gentiles, and most of them survived the war.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. Most of the others were sent to the Riga concentration camp, Yom Kippur at\nnight, 1943, and we were taken to the cargo terminal and in cattle cars we were\nshoved in and interestingly, we were told we were going to Riga. And, Riga just rang\na bell, something clicked. I loved Riga before the war. The the commotion in\nRiga, it was a big city for me in contrast to Libau which was sort of a sleepy, smaller\ncity of some 70,000 inhabitants. Riga at that time had close to half a million people. It\nwas the city of my dreams as a child. So, I imagined Riga when I was being\ntransported, I was thinking of the Riga beaches, the summers we spent there. I was\nthinking of my aunt\u2019s apartment, the parties. I was thinking of the cafes, of the Riga\nZoo, wonderful, wonderful memories. And, then we were told we were coming to\nKaiserwald. Kaiserwald was the most exclusive suburb in Riga at this time.\nKaiserwald means the Forest of the Kaiser. And, one of my aunts and my granddad\nhad a beautiful villa there, Kaiserwald, gorgeous. So, I thought, \u201cKaiserwald, well,\nwho knows?\u201d et cetera. In a sense, I mean, obviously here we were in a cattle car, and\nat the same time I was daydreaming about the beautiful life that I lived in Riga.\n(laughs)",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Which is very strange, but I remember this very, very distinctly, and looking forward\nto going to Riga.",
        "Q: We have to stop the tape. Is it okay?\nEnd of Tape 6\nTape 7",
        "Q: George, can you tell us what it was that you brought with you? Did you have\nluggage? Did you have special clothes?",
        "A: We were told that we could take with us what we could carry. So, I still \u2014 we still had\nour pre-war clothes. We were dressed warmly.",
        "Q: Was it cold?",
        "A: October, it was beginning to get cold, yes. So, we were always prepared. I remember\nmother saying it\u2019s better warmer because we could always take off. So, we were very\nwarmly dressed. We each had a suitcase and some other things so on and so forth. So,\nwe were transported, and I remember we arrived in Riga. It was still dark, probably\nvery early in the morning next day. Suddenly, the doors were slid open. SS men\nbeginning to scream and also some of the non-Jewish prisoners in very strange garb,\nnamely in concentration camp garb screaming, \u201cOut, out with you dirty Jews, out!\u201d\nAnd, beating us, beating us like crazy, and then we had to run from \u2014 which wasn\u2019t\nvery far, maybe fifty or sixty yards \u2014 to the camp from the railroad track. And, there\nwe were told to throw all the luggage and to take off the coat, and throw it on a pile,\nand my mother didn\u2019t want to do it, and I remember saying to my mother, \u201cBut,\nmother we\u2019re told that we\u2019re going to get it back. So, let\u2019s put it there.\u201d What do you\nexpect of an eleven year old kid? That\u2019s what we were told, and I believed. So,\nreluctantly, my mother and my brother also took off the coat, and inside of course,\nwere diamonds and some gold coins whatever. And, needless to say, we never saw\nthe coats again. Then we were chased into a barrack, and next day, we were\n\u2018\u201cdeloused\u201d but we didn\u2019t have any lice in Libau, and we went through a shower, and\ncoming out of the shower, we no longer had our old clothes. We were given new\nclothes that didn\u2019t fit me. I got a coat that came down to here. I received some\nwooden shoes. What do they call them?",
        "Q: Clogs.",
        "A: Clogs.",
        "Q: Wooden clogs, yeah.",
        "A: Clogs, some sort of a shirt, et cetera - not as yet concentration camp garb. And,\neverything was quick, quick, and you had these especially some Polish and also very\nnotorious German criminal , some of the Polish criminals, , beating us\ntogether with the Germans beating us to run here and there, and then we were directed\nto a certain barrack where we\u2019re going to sleep now. I\u2019d never seen before bunk beds\nwith straw mattresses and straw pillow, and at night I remember, the straw would\ncome out and it was very \u2014 there were no sheets or anything of the sort, a kind of a\nblanket even in the winter. It was very cold which as an ordeal especially for me who\n\u2014 for everyone who had not experienced anything of the sort because until then, let\u2019s\nput it this way, in comparison to the Libau ghetto, Riga was \u2014 Riga Kaiserwald was\nhell, and the Libau ghetto was, in comparison, paradise. The beatings, the screamings,\nAppel, for the first time I heard the word Appel, the count, in the morning, and to\nmake sure that I look older, et cetera, at the count, I always scratched together the\nsand and stood on my toes to be taller than usual. So, and I was a little bit taller than\nthe rest of the kids in my age group. That was probably one of the reasons why I was\nnot immediately selected for being shot. My brother after a few days was taken to a\nkaisernierung, to a camp outside the camp where he worked in their reichsbarn which\nhad happened to be a very good kaisernierung. The people were treated relatively\nwell. My mother was assigned to a job in the concentration camp, in the tanklager,\nand sometimes she managed to convince, I don\u2019t know how that I go with her to the\ntanklager, not to remain in camp because if you remain in camp you never know what\ncan happen. There were safer days. There were less safer days. It was a very, very\nsevere winter, the winter of \u201943 again in \u201944, and we were working on this tanklager\nagain, in constructing railroad trucks, and there were a lot of the-",
        "Q: Railroad tracks?",
        "A: Yes, railroad tracks, sorry, tracks because it was \u2014 you had a lot of gasoline storage et\ncetera, and trains came in where you loaded the gasoline, et cetera, for the Air Force,\nfor the Navy et cetera, and so it was a storage, a dump, and also part of the tanklager\nwas also a repair shop for German cars or whatever, but I was working a lot outside\nbuilding and repairing of the tracks, railroad tracks.",
        "Q: Is this when you were still in Kaiserwald or when you joined your brother?",
        "A: No, that\u2019s still in Kaiserwald. I did not join my brother until probably it was, must\nhave been November or so.",
        "Q: The following-",
        "A: Well.",
        "Q: Oh no-",
        "A: A month or two months later, or maybe even three months later.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. When you get into the camp, are you separated from your\nbrother and your mother?",
        "A: I was together with my brother for the first three days until he was taken to this\nkaisernierung and I was alone. My mother was on the woman\u2019s side, and there was a\nfence between the woman\u2019s camp, but I could see my mother almost anytime \u2014 in the\nmorning before work or when she would come back because you could see the\nwomen\u2019s camp. It was just \u2014 the distance was like from here to the camera. So, it\u2019s\njust a few feet.",
        "Q: Did you talk to each other?",
        "A: Oh, across the fence.",
        "Q: And that was okay?",
        "A: That was okay. In the mornings, I remember I was starved all ready, but I didn\u2019t\nsuffer all that much from hunger, but I remember I would say to my mother,\n\u2018\u201cMomika, I\u2019m so hungry.\u201d So, she would give me her portion. I said, \u201cBut, did you\neat?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I am full.\u201d She would say, but she was not, but she threw me her\nportion because in the mornings we would receive moldy bread, some sugar, some\nkind of a marmalade, and this was very bad because \u2014 this was bad because we all got\ndiarrhea from it, and a kind of a coffee that didn\u2019t taste like coffee at least to me as a\nchild. It was terrible, but it wasn\u2019t enough for me. So, I asked my mother, and she\nvery often was able to throw me her portion, and I ate, and I remember at that time,\nthere was a Mr. Kaufman who was a friend from before the war. And, I went to him\nand I said to him in German, \u201cMr. Kaufman, do you happen to have a slice of bread?\nI\u2019m very, very hungry.\u201d He said to me, \u201cGeorge, I wish I had I could give you, but I\ndon\u2019t.\u201d And, Pll never forget this. He died in New York. He was the first chairman of\nthe Jewish Survivors of Latvia, and he always remembered this, and I remember this\nparticular incident as well. But, it was done still. It was still Herr Kaufman, Mr.\nKaufman that I addressed him. It was not Max or sort of the way we\u2019re accustomed to\nhere. Yes, and then, interestingly enough in this Tanklager, which was a tough place,\nthere was a German guard by the name of Hoffmann, the beast par excellence, beat\nthe Jews like anything. He came I think from Romania or some place from that area,\nbut he liked my mother, and would always address her as Frau Dr. Schwab, and when\nhe was patrolling, he would say, \u201cYou can go into this shack\u201d where there was a stove\nand what we confiscated. We used to call it organizier, we organized something. We\nstole something \u2014 potatoes so we could slice and put it against the oven and roast\npotatoes. That became a delicacy. So, and he permitted me to go with my mother. So,\nwe could go in. We could warm-up, et cetera. We would have our potato so on and so\nforth. One day, we were marching toward the Tanklager again in the winter, and my\nmother told me she had a terrible case of diarrhea and she doesn\u2019t know what to do.\nin German. She went over to him and said, \u201cI really have to step out.\u201d He said,\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d He slowed down the column, permitted my mother to attend to what she\nhad, and then she rejoined the column. Why did he do it? I don\u2019t know. My mother\nwas gold blonde, very fair skinned, bluish-grey eyes, looked like a thousand Aryans.\nActually, she was told and that was still going back now in Libau, if she wanted to be\nsaved to be taken to Germany, she could be saved. She said, \u201cI\u2019Il be delighted if I can\nbring my sons with me.\u201d They said, \u201cNo, you can not.\u201d Then, she said, \u201cThen I stay\nwith my sons.\u201d And, that was still in Libau, because they distinguished sometimes the\ngenotype from the phenotype, genetically Jewish versus the appearance, and if your\nappearance was \u201cAryan\u201d especially Nordic, which my mother was, then you could\nmanipulate, but she was actually asked.",
        "Q: She was asked?",
        "A: Yeah, and there are other incidents like this after the war, immediately where people\nin Berlin did not think that she was Jewish because the way she looked when she\ncame to look for me, but maybe when we go into this, we can discuss it later.",
        "Q: Now, is your brother living in this outer camp?",
        "A: Yes, he was living in this outer camp, and sometimes there was communication and\nyoucould __ had little pieces of paper or whatever, and you could communicate.\nAnd, he communicated with my mother that it 1s possible to bribe the commandant\nKohler of the reichsbahn where my brother was at to bring her and me to the\nreichsbahn, and my mother said yes she is going to send for some gold coins and fur\ncoats. It was something in because certain of the things we managed to give to a\nLatvian patient of my father\u2019s who was a head of a bank by the name of Abelit. His\nname was Abelit, and he did come through, this Abelit, and sent the things to Kohler\nand Kohler instructed my brother to get a message to me that I should be in the camp\non those three days and he will send a car for me. And, indeed, but not for my mother,\nbut for me. And, my mother said, \u201cAbsolutely you go. It\u2019s and don\u2019t worry about\nme. I'll be all right.\u201d So, I went and joined my brother, but I was not the only one in\nthe car. There was apparently a few more who had similar deals because he could be\nbribed. He was one who could be bribed. And, then my mother, we learned later, also\nwent to an out camp to work camp called the SS , the SS vegetable garden\nfor the SS et cetera. So, that\u2019s where she was, and then I saw my mother very briefly.\nWe had word that she would passing the reichsbahn. I don\u2019t know how we got the\nword, through whom, but that at that time was a convoy that we should be at the gate\nor whatever, and we actually saw our mother for maybe two minutes. We were just\nable to-",
        "Q: And, did she see you as well?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: She did?",
        "A: Yeah. When I came to the reichsbahn it was in comparison to Kaiserwald, paradise.\nThe food was slightly better, no beatings. I had an attack, I suffered appendicitis. I\nwas there in the camp hospital for a couple of days until I got better. Incidentally, I\nwas also in the Kaiserwald, had an attack there. And, a colleague of my father\u2019s, Dr.\nSik in Libau was the head of the hospital over there. He said, \u201cGeorge, I'll take you\ninto the hospital.\u201d And, he kept me there. On the third day, he said, \u201cGeorge, you\nbetter disappear because there\u2019s going to be inspection today and we don\u2019t know what\ncan happen. Do the best you can. Nothing is going to happen to you. Try not to work\ntoo hard or bend too hard.\u201d And, I left, and sure enough some of the sick ones were\ntaken away and shot. But, the reichsbahn in comparison was not all that bad, food-\nwise.",
        "Q: Who ran it?",
        "A: It was run by the German reichsbahn, railroad.",
        "Q: So, they-",
        "A: And, the commandant, you could \u2014 you could talk to him. He could also scream.",
        "Q: You could scream?",
        "A: He could scream.",
        "Q: He could scream.",
        "A: He could scream, yes, but by and large, I don\u2019t remember major beatings or so, for\nexample in the Kaiserwald, I remember having received once a smack in my face\nfrom the commandant Oberstrumbahnfuhrer Sauer. I saw stars in front of me. I was\nsupposed to clear the snow from the walkway, and I perhaps didn\u2019t do it as quickly.\nSo, he came out and said to me, \u201cHey, you Jew boy, why aren\u2019t you working?\u201d I said,\n\u201cT\u2019m working,\u2019 And, he slapped me. I fell maybe ten feet away from the slap, and I\njust stars in front of my eyes. This did not \u2014 was not the case in the reichsbahn, and in\nthe reichsbahn what was my task, I began to \u201chelp my brother\u2019 he was an auto\nelectrician. He knew about a car electrician as much as I know about the Chinese\nlanguage, and I was his assistant, and what we did, what we all did for example when\nwe had to screw in something, we would screw it in not all the way. It was our way\nof, \u201csabotaging\u201d the German war effort. We would always try to do things not a\nhundred percent, eighty percent. Hopefully, something will go wrong. But, when an\nSS man would come, and inspect, go around the big halls and inspect somebody\nwould scream out ; meant six. For some reason, I don\u2019t know why\nsix which meant inspector be careful. So, we all immediately-",
        "Q: Got very serious.",
        "A: -got very seriously this and that running around, this was a code word.",
        "Q: Did anybody ever get caught for not doing things right?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember this. I don\u2019t remember this, and then we had a wonderful Jewish\ncouple, German Jewish couple who were working there too, and he and his wife were\nthe elders of this kasernierung Steinhart, Edith Steinhart. I forget his first name. They\nwere lovely, lovely people, and they were so to speak belonged to the German Jewish\ngroup in the camp, but were very good towards us. There was a couple from Vienna,\nlovely people, Maier was their name. Mr. and Mrs. Maier I remember, lovely, lovely\npeople from Vienna. There were two German Jewish couples who were a little bit on\nthe rough side, who became much rougher in Stolp, more to say about it. So, one was\nKentcourik from Lubek the other was Grunwald, or Greenwald also from Germany,\nbut I don\u2019t remember from what part of Germany. And suddenly, we knew that the\nRussians were advancing in the direction of Riga in the late spring of 1944. Suddenly,\nwe come to the camp, return from our work which was only may about 200 yards\nfrom where we were living, and that we all had to appear at an . That was in\nJuly 1944, and there was this SS doctor from the camp, Krebsbach and his deputy,\nWisner and Kohler standing and we\u2019re in this large hall and we were told to get\nundressed, get in line, and then there was a selection \u2014 left, right, left, right, left, right.\nMy brother was sent to the left, and I was sent to the right. But, my brother said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Kohler is there. He knows what we have done.\u201d So on and so forth,\n\u201cwe can do more, don\u2019t worry.\u201d My brother was sent to the left. I was sent to the\nright, and I never saw my brother again. My mother saw him still in Kaiserwald, and\nknew that he would be shot, and he said to my mother, \u201cDon\u2019t worry mother. We\u2019re\ngoing to take some of the Germans and Latvians, our shooters with us.\u201d\u201d My mother\nfelt that she could have rescued him and begged him to come to the fence, but he\nwouldn\u2019t come. He didn\u2019t want to upset my mother. So, he didn\u2019t come to the fence\nto see her again, and that was the last we heard of him.",
        "Q: So, he was sent back to Kaiserwald, and then they were going to shoot them?",
        "A: Yes, and then from Kaiserwald, they were taken the Rumbala forest where they were\nkilled, yes.",
        "Q: Shot?",
        "A: Yes, but it must have been at the very end of July or the very beginning of August,\n1944. The ones who survived, I came back to the barracks, we came back to the\nbarracks, and I kept on \u2014 my brother was sleeping in the bunk bed next to mine. I\nsaid, \u201cBubbi, Bubbi, where are you? Bubbi, Bubbi, where are you?\u201d And, I had a\nhunch that this was it. That I wouldn\u2019t see him again, and he was taken probably to be\nshot, and I was alone now. It was at this stage that Julius Goldberg, who was in the\nsame barrack, et cetera, he said, \u201cGeorge, Ill take care of you. For as long as I will\nlive, you will live.\u201d And, Julius Goldberg was strong like an ox, very athletic, a\nyachtsman before the war, very handsome fellow, at that time probably in his late 20s\nI would think. But, he slept over there, and I slept over here, and fine. A week later,\nwe were taken to a ship. We were being evacuated because the Russians were coming\nclose. We were being evacuated, boarded the ship. That\u2019s when we were taken to\nStutthof in August 1944. And, it was a, I guess a troop carrier, what, I don\u2019t\nremember what it was before the war. Maybe it was a liner or so, but at that stage of\nthe game there were bunks all over the place, troop carrier, I guess. It was full of\nconcentration camp inmates. So, I was looking. Maybe I would see Bubi. Maybe I\nwould see my mother. And, we already had concentration camp garb by that-",
        "Q: You mean striped uniforms.",
        "A: Striped uniforms, and I was looking up, and a woman was looking down without hair.\nI didn\u2019t know who it was without hair, and suddenly I heard a familiar voice saying,\n\u201cGeorgenka.\u201d My mother\u2019s voice. She was looking down. She was without hair. They\nhad taken her and shaved her hair, and there was my mother. So, for the next three\ndays we could see each other on the ship, and the interesting thing is that while we\nwere going through the bay of Riga, the Russians were shooting at the ship, but\nmissing us by a hundred or two hundred yards, and we just sailed through it, and the\nartillery shells would fall, go over the ship, fall on the other side maybe a couple of\nhundred yards from it, and we finally arrived near Danzig. We were put on the little\nrailroad cars. What do they call them? The schmalspurbahn, the German. It\u2019s not the\nregular, it\u2019s-",
        "Q: Were they half cars?",
        "A: Half cars, and not as wide. The railroad tracks were not as wide \u2014 lorries, kind of\nlorries, it\u2019s almost a sort of a choo-choo train, et cetera. So, we were transported to\nStutthof in August. That was Kaiserwald, however bad it was, was paradise in\ncomparison to Stutthof. We were beaten. We had to work also on the railroad tracks\nover there, not far from the gas chamber and crematorium we saw. We already knew\nwhat it was. The chimney burning all the time, burning the bodies. So, we knew and\nthe issue was how to survive there. Food was almost non-existent. We were all\nemaciated. We were all starving, but and I no longer saw my mother. I no longer saw\nmy mother.",
        "Q: I\u2019m afraid we have to stop there and change the tape.\nEnd of Tape 7\nTape 8",
        "Q: George, we ended with your saying that you no longer were able to see your mother\nand coming into Stutthof, the Kaiserwald was paradise in comparison with Stutthof.\nSo, could you explain what was going on?",
        "A: Well, the beatings were almost non-stop now. The food was even worse than in\nKaiserwald. When we worked on the tracks, we were beaten all the time by the\nGermans and by the non-Jewish couples, even though I learned what a louse means in\nKaiserwald, and began the practice of delousing myself \u2014 the hair and over here and\nso call in the garb that we had. Now, we were full of lice in Stutthof. The facilities\nwere terrible. Sanitary facilities in Kaiserwald were also bad. For example, the toilet\nwas a kind of an outhouse. It was a square pit, and was \u2014 on top of this what was\nconstructed were columns. Columns was a wooden \u201cbench\u201d maybe six or eight inches\nand you would have to lift yourself up, that I never fell into the pit was a miracle, and\nincidentally, there were some kapos that were so bad that they were thrown into the\npit by the Jews, non-Jewish couples. But, in Stutthof it all over shadowed Kaiserwald\nfrom every point of view, especially the beatings. Now, the interesting part was that\nthe reichsbahn requested that the same people be spent to Stolp. So, I was part of it.",
        "Q: So, you got out of -",
        "A: I got of Stutthof.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something, George, when you say \u2014 what were they beating you\nwith? Do you remember?",
        "A: First of all, they would slap you, but then they also had whips \u2014 whips. They would\nbeat you like you would beat a wild horse when you want them to run or something to\nthat effect. It didn\u2019t matter if you were young or old, et cetera, and the infirm were\nimmediately taken after the appel to be shot, cremated.",
        "Q: And, how were you strong enough to withstand this kind of treatment?",
        "A: I always made myself older, and I always made myself taller, and this was street\nsmartness in a sense. Now, why was my brother taken?",
        "Q: And, not you?",
        "A: And, not me. Again, I resorted to the same tactic, but my brother used eyeglasses, and\nanybody who needed eye et cetera was already concerned infirmed, which we did not\nknow, or he would\u2019ve hidden the eyeglasses. So, he was taken. I did not need\neyeglasses. Yes, I was emaciated, but everyone was emaciated, and however much I\nsuffered from hunger pains, I suffered less than others because my father as a\ngastroenterologist, et cetera never permitted us to eat huge portions of anything, never\npermitted us too much, too many of the fatty things. In between meals, we could have\na fruit or something. He was strict about that \u2014 a fruit or so, but no as we\nwould call it, maybe a piece of this or that, et cetera nothing. A meal is a meal. That\u2019s\nwhen we can eat, but everything in moderate proportion.",
        "Q: So, this was helpful to you?",
        "A: This was very helpful because I could never gorge myself with food, because many of\nthe people and that\u2019s what I first learned \u2014 poor people gorge themselves very often\nbelieving that they had to put on layers of fat that would protect them from the natural\n\u2014 from the winters or whatever, and this I only learned subsequently. I was not\nconscious of it before the war, but only after the war people talked about the food\nhabits in the camps, and those were my habits. However hungry I was, as I said\nbefore, I was not that hungry. The day of liberation, as Pll tell you a little later, I\nmistook soap for bread and I started to eat soap, but this was already on the day of\nliberation which is still to come.",
        "Q: So, are you in Stutthof for like a month, two months?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Not even that long?",
        "A: Not even that long, probably not more than ten days or so the first time around.",
        "Q: Now, you turn 13.",
        "A: I turned-",
        "Q: In 19-",
        "A: Later on, I guess in 19- wait a second. I had a birthday I remember, and this was in\n1944, was I 13 in 1944? I guess so, but this was in November, much later. I was still\nnow 12 in Stutthof.",
        "Q: So, when is there this sort of semi-Bar Mitzvah party?",
        "A: That was in \u2014 that was later. That was in November.",
        "Q: In 19-",
        "A: \"44,",
        "Q: 1944. So, we\u2019re still in 1944.",
        "A: Yes, we\u2019re still in 1944, in August, 1944. And, suddenly we were transported from\nStutthof to Stolp.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: In passenger cars, railroad cars.",
        "Q: Passenger cars?",
        "A: Yes, and the feeling was that the Nazis didn\u2019t want to show to their own people that\nyou transport prisoners \u2014 this was our interpretation \u2014 prisoners in cattle cars. That\nwas our interpretation. Whether this is true or not, I don\u2019t know. And, that turned out\nto be a work camp, living right on the premises in the reichsbahn right near the\nrailroad, the main railroad station there. There I became a carpenter, and I know as\nmuch about carpentry as I know about Chinese hieroglyphics. That I didn\u2019t chop off a\nfinger or something or other is still one of those miracles because I have no sense for\nthese things.",
        "Q: So, what was your job?",
        "A: Helping to repair cattle cars, transportation, et cetera. Sometimes you needed a board,\nso you had to do this. You do that. Don\u2019t ask me what somehow or another, and\nmanaged to do what was expected.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t building furniture.",
        "A: No, no, no I wasn\u2019t building furniture. I was not an artist, along those lines. No. I was\na plain, plain worker.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The food was manageable over there, and people who worked right near the tracks\nwere able to organize sometimes potatoes, carrots, because they would fall off from\nthe railroad tracks and smuggled into the camps and you could begin to trade a little\nbit here and there. So, you could augment the poor food that we got with some of the\nextras, but a few months later, some people did the same thing, organize some food,\nand they were caught by the Germans. And, now, the Germans wanted to teach us a\nlesson that theft 1s punishable. And, what they did was hang the people, and we were\nforced to march to see the hanging, and then march around the hangers to see them.\nHow did I survive this one? When it was announced hanging people, I didn\u2019t\nunderstand what it means, how a person can hang. Again, it became interesting to me\nto look at the person hanging. I didn\u2019t understand that this is involved with death. I\ndid not put two and two together. How can a person hang? And, only while hanging\ndid I realize that the person was hanged and it meant actual death. I did not connect\nthis before. So, to me again, it was a kind of a spectacle. Theater of the Absurd, if you\nwant to call it, or something along those lines. Sick! But I remember the context very\nwell because I think about it and how could I have reacted the way I reacted? And,\nmy answer 1s, folly of youth, did not understand, and number two, and perhaps even\nmore important than this, curiosity because everything interested me especially that\nwhat I didn\u2019t understand. And, this happened three, four months before our liberation\nwhen the Russians were already on German soil, and also during this period in Stolp,\nthe German Jewish couples began to behave atrociously to the Eastern European\nJews. When somebody was caught organizing something internally or so, he had to\nreceive twenty lashes, and the German Jewish couples were only delighted to mete\nout the punishment. One of them was Kentcourik who was particularly brutal. For\nsome reason or other, both of these couples Greenwald and Kentcourik liked me,\nmaybe because I spoke their type of German, and left me pretty much alone this and\nthat and were actually nice, but they were absolute \u2014 excuse me for using the term\nhere \u2014 bastards. And, I\u2019m jumping now forward for a minute. I was in the same\nhospital, after, right after the war as Kentcourik, and I came out of the hospital and\nwas brought back by the British to the rehabilitation, to the rehabilitation barrack in\nthe DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein with one of the British Red Cross cars,\nambulance cars, and Kentcourik \u2014 I informed the other guys who were there, fellows,\nmany of them that I was liberated with that Kentcourik was coming out. \u201cOh,\nKentcourik is coming out. We\u2019ll beat the hell out of him,\u201d and Kentcourik came in\nthinking that\u2019s he\u2019s coming 1n as a great hero, and chairs flew into his face, this and\nthat, so on and so forth. He was taken back to the hospital seriously injured. He\nsurvived this, and after the war he had two daughters, moved with his two daughters\nto Lubeck where he died subsequently, but I don\u2019t remember what happened to his\nother one, Grunwald, but that was the fate of this German Jewish couple Kentcourik.",
        "Q: George, when you\u2019re walking around, how long did they make you walk around these\npeople who were hung? Just once? Twice?",
        "A: No, no, no, we were standing at attention walking, I would say about for an hour or\nSO.",
        "Q: So, it\u2019s a long time.",
        "A: Yeah, for us to be taught a lesson. So, they were hanging there.",
        "Q: Do you think you also took this kind of position \u2014 not just, that it wasn\u2019t just curiosity\nand interest in something new \u2014 and ignorance because you were a kid, but also a way\nto protect yourself? Or was that-",
        "A: You can interpret it as such. It was a protective mechanism perhaps. You could \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t think along these lines, but I can see this, yes, I can see this.",
        "Q: Was there-",
        "A: But, not conscious.",
        "Q: Yes, I understand.",
        "A: There was no conscious.",
        "Q: That I understand, and was there an affect after looking at this for an hour that broke\nthis sort of curiosity?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve been thinking about it ever since this particular episode. Hanging, et cetera,\nand when I watch the History Channel, and I see some of the \u2014 some of the things\nwhen Mussolini was hung with Clara Petacci, and how they used to hang Russian\nprisoners, the German and so on and so forth, this always comes back to me, this\nscene of how I had to watch these people being hanged. It\u2019s something that stays with\nme.",
        "Q: Stays with you.",
        "A: Yes. Well, I guess you can interpret my reactions to many of the things in\npsychological terms as self-protection et cetera. The whole approach being the theater\nof the absurd, but looking at it with today\u2019s vocabulary and understanding et cetera,\nbut at the time, of course, I did not-",
        "Q: Right, you didn\u2019t have that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t have this vocabulary and know this understanding.",
        "Q: But, it must have been scary. At some point it had to be horribly scary.",
        "A: Absolutely because I could be next. Yes, you never knew. Yeah, and, in Stolp I was\nsleeping in a bunk right next to Julius Goldberg. Again, everything straw, this and\nthat, lice, delousing was an every evening activity. Bathroom facility better than\nStutthof and Riga, but still \u2014 there was water. You could wash yourself in the barrack\nwhich was a converted \u2014 the barrack was actually not a true barrack. It was for a\nsteam engine that was converted into a kind of a barrack where we could sleep, bunk\nbeds. And, then, the Russians were coming very close and they were going to\nevacuate us, but before then, about the Bar Mitzvah. It was Eugenia Goldberg who\nwas a nurse, and persuaded the SS woman to let her do something for me. And, she\n\u201cbaked\u201d something from potatoes which was the most delicious thing I thought I'd\never eaten because I was so starved \u2014 a kind of a potato pie. She explained it to Sheila\nRobbins, maybe she would be able to explain it to you what it was, and then the SS\nwoman was present. I was permitted to come in from the man\u2019s quarter including\nJulius Goldberg, her husband.",
        "Q: Oh, it is the husband. They are related. That\u2019s what I was going to ask you.",
        "A: Yes, yes, that was a wife.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Wonderful, wonderful woman, and songs were sung by inmates including one of the\nsongs sung in English, Lambeth Walk, I remember and the SS woman actually\nenjoying it too.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. It was \u201cvery festive\u201d under the circumstances.",
        "Q: That\u2019s quite extraordinary.",
        "A: Extraordinary, yeah. So-",
        "Q: So this was your 13\".",
        "A: Yes, I guess it was, yes. It was my Bar Mitzvah I guess, end of \u201944. I\u2019m confused\nwith the dates sometimes a little because sometimes I was made older, sometimes I\nwas made younger. So, I have to think about. It was nothing unusual in those\ncircumstances.",
        "Q: But it was in Stolp",
        "A: It was in Stolp, yes. Now, it was not long thereafter, a couple of months actually, I\nthink it was in March, beginning of March or end of February when we were sort of\ndumped into cattle cars again, and we were returning to Stutthof But, because the\nRussians were already nearby and my mother was already liberated nearby which I\ndidn\u2019t know. I found this out only after I met her, we spent about a week in these\ncattle cars with hardly any food, no facilities to speak of, 1n the corners we had where\nthe stench was absolutely incredible. Finally, we came to Danzig and we didn\u2019t\nmanage to get to Stutthof and we were brought to another small camp Burggraben,\nand we marched. It was a long march from Danzig to Burggraben. It was very cold, I\nremember. It was about easily, easily ten, twelve miles in our circumstance to march.\nWe arrived in Burggrabben. It was knee deep in mud. There were no German guards.\nIt was no man\u2019s land between the Russian front and the German front. The Russians\nwould shoot their artillery across our heads, and the Germans would shoot their\nartillery across our heads.",
        "Q: And, you\u2019re in the middle.",
        "A: And we were in the middle. For about a week to ten days I would say with hardly any\nfood, hardly anything to drink.",
        "Q: You were just sitting there?",
        "A: Sitting there.",
        "Q: Watching?",
        "A: Watching what was happening. Watching what was happening. Suddenly, German\ntrucks appeared. This was in March \u201945. We\u2019re hauled to those German trucks, and\nthey took us to Stutthof back.",
        "Q: Oh, you did get to Stutthof.",
        "A: Yeah, the second time. Now, Stutthof the first time was paradise in comparison to\nStutthof the second time. Rampant typhoid, hardly any food, Russian plans attacking\nus, didn\u2019t know that it was probably a camp or so. The ovens burning all the time,\nhardly anything to eat, people dying left and right, being shot left and right, Germans\nunleashing their dogs, police dogs. And, the police dogs biting people including\nJulius Goldberg was bitten like mad. His feet swelled up, and we were there for about\ntwo weeks, maybe a little longer give or take a week or so when suddenly the order\ncame, \u201cEvacuation.\u201d We\u2019re going to be evacuated by boat. And, again, we were\nhauled off in these mini-train, these mini-railroad tracks, not the regular ones to\nbarges in Danzig, or near Danzig, barges. And, then we were taken on these barges on\nthe high seas \u2014 the Baltic, the North Sea. For the trip, we received a loaf of bread and\nsome water. That was it because we subsisted on sea water during the trip, salt water.\nSS Guards were guarding us, and if you had to step out, you had to do it over the\nrailing and into the water on these barges, and you could see the SS Guards pushing\npeople with their shoes into the Baltic or into the North Sea. I remember very\ndistinctly I suddenly saw a German coming, passing me. I thought, well, this was my\nend, but it passed me and didn\u2019t do anything. And, we were down, et cetera. To climb\nup we had no strength left or anything of the sort, but Julius despite his illness, I mean\nhe was as strong as a bull. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my life. And, suddenly\nwe were told that we had arrived in Hamburg, but I don\u2019t think it was Hamburg, but\nthis 1s what I remember, and that we had to get out very quickly for Hamburg because\nthe Americans were in Hamburg. It was actually the Brits, not the Americans, and\nthen, we were taken back to the high seas, and at night the German guards abandoned\nus, and we were told that we were in minefields.",
        "Q: On the high seas?",
        "A: On the high seas, minefields, abandoned and we didn\u2019t know what to do. On our\nbarges, were Norwegian POWs, and they collected the blankets we had still from the\ncamp, and made sails out of them. And, came close to, very close to the shore that we\nlater learned was Neustadt in Holstein, about 25 miles or kilometers from Lubek, and\nthe decision was made \u2014 this was about four o\u2019clock in the morning, five o\u2019clock in\nthe morning, May the third \u2014 that we would wade to shore and walk in the direction\nof Hamburg where the Americans are, and we\u2019ll be liberated. Julius was immediately\nfor wading and was taking me along. I said, \u201cJulius please, please let me die. I have\nno strength. Please leave me alone!\u201d I remember Julius was stone. He said, \u201cNope,\nyou\u2019re coming with me\u2019, and took me by the collar and dragged me. We had to go\ndown, and actually in this very cold May in the North Sea, early morning, and I knew\na little bit how to swim from the Baltic. I grew up on the shores of the Baltic. I knew,\net cetera, but I had no difficulties wading to shore, and we all lined up and people\ntook a long time because there were several barges of people, and there were people\nstill there who didn\u2019t want to leave, and left very slowly, and suddenly, units of the\nGerman Navy arrive because it turned out that this was a U-boat school in Neustadt in\nHolstein, a huge U-boat school. Units of the German Navy arrived.",
        "Q: Okay, I\u2019ve got to - Hold that thought because we have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape 8\nTape 9",
        "Q: George, I want to go back to your scene with Goldberg. This 1s the first time that\nyou \u2019ve said, \u201cI want to die. Leave me alone.\u201d You\u2019ve never indicated in any of the\nways you told your story that you wanted to die. Why now?",
        "A: By now, I really felt totally, completely, totally exhausted \u2014 completely and totally\nstarved because we were subsisting on sea water. How long can you subsist on sea\nwater? I just wanted to sleep because we were crowded in like herring, but he\nwouldn\u2019t let go of me.",
        "Q: That\u2019s really something.",
        "A: Yeah, and then when we finally waded there, when the German troops arrived from\nthe __i marina, from the naval units, they started shooting at random. People were\nstill on the barges, wading toward the shore. People who were sitting, who were too\nweak to get up were shot immediately. It was the day of liberation, incidentally. And,\nnow another march. We were going to march someplace, and I said to Julius, again,\n\u201cJulius, please leave me alone! I want to die.\u201d And, he was all swollen from the dog\nwhere he was bitten. He said, \u201cNo\u201d, and again he pushed me. And, the march was not\na long one, a couple of miles, and we arrived at this huge complex, a German U-boat\nschool. There was a huge soccer field, and there were thousands and thousands of\npeople there from other camps. And, we were told that there is a ship by the name of\nCap Arcorna that we\u2019re going to be put on that ship, and we will sale for I don\u2019t\nremember where. I was semi-delirious and I was really starved, and in the shuffle in\nthese thousands of people, I lost Julius. I wandered around. British planes were\noverhead and shooting, and the Cap Arcona was offshore, but there was another ship,\nthe Athens, and we were supposed to line up and get onto the Athens to be taken to\nthe Cap Arcorna. And, I wandered around still, and suddenly, I see a pile of things,\nand I was in a delirious state by then, a German guard looking at it, guns \u2014 all sorts of\nthings, and saw there what I would call today \u2014 it was soap, but I mistook it for bread.\nI picked it up and I started to eat it, and I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t bite it. I couldn\u2019t eat it.\nIt didn\u2019t taste like bread. So, I threw it away, and I walked over to the guard and said\nto him, \u201cMay I have a slice of bread?\u201d He said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you walk over to this\ntank? This is a British tank. You have been liberated, walk over and you'll get\nsomething.\u201d So, I walked over to the tank. The British, I decided to speak English, I\nsaid, \u201cI\u2019m very, very hungry. Can I please have a slice of bread?\u201d So, they gave me\nthese cookies, a number of cookies to eat because they didn\u2019t have bread, but it was\nsome sort of cookies.",
        "Q: Cookies or cracker?",
        "A: Crackers.",
        "Q: Was it a cracker?",
        "A: Those were crackers rather, not cookies, you\u2019re right, crackers. And, we were free,\nand I saw the Athens there. In the meantime, just then, the Cap Arcorna was sunk by\nthe British. Most of the people drowned, most of the prisoners drowned. A few\nsurvived included Sam Bressler and his father \u2014__. And, some way or other, I saw\nJulius again, and I saw people stealing goods from the German storage places, food.\nThey had huge gallons of marmalade, I guess for the soldiers, for the Naval people\nwhatever, and people hauling, people eating all over. Many died by overeating\nimmediately.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Immediately, I was too weak to even carry that much, but Julius and I and some\nothers went into a barrack and took over the rooms. The bunk beds was clean,\neverything. And, that\u2019s where we decided we\u2019re going to be for the night, and we\nwere basically free, but it didn\u2019t mean anything to me being free. I did receive some\ncrackers, something else, et cetera. So, my basic hunger was to an extent satiated, and\nthen I went out myself and I organized something also one of those cans I managed to\nbring back. Suddenly, there\u2019s a knock on the door and several Poles walked in,\nlooked around, and said among themselves, and by then I knew some Polish because I\nlived with Poles at the camps, \u201cThis is our place and out you Jew! Out! You out!\u201d He\ndidn\u2019t say Jews, and the Jews said, \u201cYou better get out or else.\u201d And, Julius was in\nthe forefront as sick as he was. Those days are over. They left quietly, and we stayed\nthere. Now, while we were still on the barges, we heard the best news of all that\nHitler was killed fighting the Russians. He was killed in Berlin. It was very, very late\nApril. It must have been about the 29\" or 30\" of April, just a few days before we\nwere liberated. We were liberated on the third of May by the British. And, the day\nGermany officially capitulated, I collapsed out of total weakness and I was taken to\nthe hospital in Neustadt in Holstein. The many, many other prisoners from Libau,\nfrom Riga, from German Jews that I met subsequently, Czech Jews, so on and so\nforth were all there, and I stayed for a good number of weeks. I think four or six\nweeks I stayed there.",
        "Q: Did you also collapse because of the appendix?",
        "A: No, it had nothing to do.",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "A: The appendix was finally taken out in Hamburg, September or October 1945. I had an\nattack, but by then I was already on the Warburg Estate in _. No, it was general\nweakness. I luckily did not suffer from diphtheria, typhoid or any of these illnesses\nbecause as soon as the Germans occupied Libau, my father said I\u2019m going to give you\ncertain injections against certain illnesses. These were not only injections over a\nnumber of days, I remember once he cut something. It was a kind of a special type of\na razor, and he had something \u2014 there was something on the razor, and that was\nenough. I guess it was against typhoid or something or other, and then several other\nthings, and my mother escaped all of this, and I escaped all of this. I didn\u2019t have\ntyphoid. I didn\u2019t have diphtheria, and some of the other illnesses associated, but\nespecially typhoid and diphtheria.",
        "Q: It\u2019s quite extraordinary.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, he must have had some suspicion.",
        "A: He must have had some-",
        "Q: That it was not going to be good.",
        "A: So, he wanted to make sure at least to immunize us as best as he could.",
        "Q: Did he immunize himself as far as you remember?",
        "A: I would think so, but I don\u2019t know. I would think so, yes. He immunized the rest of\nthe family. So, why shouldn\u2019t he immunize himself? So, this was basically the\nliberation.",
        "Q: It doesn\u2019t feel like liberation.",
        "A: Which doesn\u2019t feel like liberation, and yet I was liberated.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, and thanks for Julius. If not for Julius, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019 ve made it.",
        "Q: It sounds like it. It sounds like you would\u2019ve just dropped.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And, what do you think made \u2014 because he promised you he\u2019d take care of you?",
        "A: He promised me that-",
        "Q: He would take care of you.",
        "A: Yes, and this was nothing uncommon when a kid was left alone. An older person\nwould sort of volunteer.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: To do it.",
        "Q: And how old was he do you think?",
        "A: Julius at that time was probably mid or late twenties.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And he had a wife.",
        "A: Yeah, that was Eugenia.",
        "Q: Right, and did she survive?",
        "A: She survived. She\u2019s still living in Israel.",
        "Q: She is now?",
        "A: Yes, she\u2019s still living in Israel \u2014 wonderful, wonderful person.",
        "Q: When do you go to Warburg Estate in Hamburg, and you don\u2019t know yet. The first\nfew months you don\u2019t know whether your mother\u2019s alive, right.",
        "A: No, I had a feeling that she\u2019s alive, but where, what, when, et cetera, no. Before I go\nto the Warburg Estate, a group of Russian officers arrived with British officers trying\nto convince me to go back to Latvia, go back to Latvia, go back to the Soviet Union,\net cetera. The answer \u2014 my answer was a categorical no because we made a pact, a\nfamily, never go east, go back. You go. We have relatives in England, the United\nStates, and we\u2019re given a name so on and so forth to remember, but never go back,\nand I said, \u201cCategorically, I\u2019m not going back.\u201d The British officers still tried to\nconvince me to go back, and a good number did go back. Some of them are now in\nIsrael. After horror \u2014 after spending horrible times in the Soviet Union in Latvia until\nthe \u201870s, and I refused to go back. Then, the Brits became suspicious of me that I\nwasn\u2019t Jewish, despite the fact that I\u2019m circumcised, and put me, brought me, took me\nto a Latvian children\u2019s home where only Latvian was spoken, where some of the\nleaders were former patients of my father, where they talked about Tievzeme in\nLatvian, the Fatherland, how eventually we\u2019ll all go back to the Fatherland, et cetera,\nbut this was a little bit strange to me because we had Latvian guards. Some of the\nLatvians were innocuous. Others were horrible. I believe this guy Cukurs, especially\nCukurs. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable there. They also wanted to introduce me \u2014 they had\nwith a woman. This was in . She wanted to introduce me to General Dankers\nwho apparently knew my father. General Dankers was one of the sympathizers, Nazi\nsympathizers who managed to get to Lubek. He headed Latvian troops, so on and so\nforth. But, which I did not know exactly, but General Dankers just didn\u2019t sound right\nthat I should meet him. In Lubek, she wanted to take me because apparently he knew\nmy father, but when we needed the Latvians, they didn\u2019t come through those who\nwere in the position to come through. One day, when the head, this woman, went to\nLubek for a day or so, I decided to run away, and I ran away and I ran all the way to\nthe DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein. the DP Camp.\u201d But, this was a second\ntime around, not the first time. The first time I was brought back to the \u2014 I\u2019m sorry.\nThis was the second time around because the first time after a few days I had a\nrelapse, and I was taken back to the hospital for another twelve days. The second\ntime, it was when they took me to the Latvian children\u2019s home, and after a few\nweeks, I ran away. I came to the camp which was in this U-boat school, and I went to\nthe bunk where I had originally brought back, the rehabilitation bunk, and I\u2019ve got a\nbed so on and so forth, and what were the people doing? Playing poker. Playing\npoker. Playing \u2014 what you call it? They call 1t 21? \u2014 Blackjack, blackjack, and making\npiles of money. In those days, the exchange rate was one dollar to 600 Marks, and I\ndon\u2019t know how I got a few Marks to play also. I figured, \u201cWhy not?\u201d And, I had a\nvery good memory, and after a few days, I saw this and I knew every card that had\ngone out and so on and so forth. I began to play, and I piled in tens of thousands of\nMarks which translates into dollars, maybe it was twenty or twenty-five dollars, but\nin Marks, it sounded enormous amount, and then I decided that it\u2019s time for me to see\nthe world.",
        "Q: And, you\u2019re what? 14?",
        "A: No, thirteen.",
        "Q: Thirteen? Okay.",
        "A: To see the world. I had plenty of money because the official rate if you went to a\nrailroad station was still actually two or three Marks or four Marks for a ticket let\u2019s\nsay to go to Hamburg. Now, I\u2019m an adult. I\u2019ve seen it all I felt. I would love to live\nthe life my aunts, my uncles, and my parents. To see the world \u2014 Berlin, Paris, night\nclubs, dancing, et cetera, that part of the world, and Neustadt was just a DP camp. So,\nI packed a few things that I had with my money, maybe by that time twenty, thirty\nthousand Marks which for Germans was an awful lot of money, got it all, and I\ndecided to go to Hamburg. The reason being that we were told that we also had\nfamily in Germany, part of the family came from Hamburg, and part of the family\ncame from Dresden. And, obviously, I didn\u2019t find anybody in Hamburg, and I didn\u2019t\nexpect to find, but at least I got to Hamburg. I didn\u2019t think it through would I go to a\nhotel? Do I need this? Do I need that? Et cetera, no.",
        "Q: And, how did you get there? By train?",
        "A: By train.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That was not a problem. I bought my ticket. I went to Hamburg, and I remembered\ngoing to a police station saying, \u201cI looked for so and so.\u201d I spoke German, and I\ndidn\u2019t know. So, I was taken to the Warburg Estate in , a Suburb of Hamburg\nwhich the Warburg family had temporarily given over to \u2014 I guess there\u2019s a joint\ndistribution committee of the American Relief Unit to turn it into a children\u2019s home,\njust a small children\u2019s home. I arrived there, and I was told, \u201cYes, I belong there.\u201d So,\nthat\u2019s how I arrived. It must have been late summer or early fall. I remember a few\nweeks later, getting an attack, appendix attack. I was operated on. I was all alone. I\nwas scared, in the Altona Hospital in Hamburg. I spoke German. I told them that my\nfather was a gastroenterologist. I spoke German to them. They were very nice to me,\nbut I was still very much afraid. They were Germans. You don\u2019t know what they can\ndo to me. I thought at that time, and I always reacted very poorly to ether, and I\nremember throwing off the mask in those days, but before the war my tonsils were\nremoved also under ether and I reacted very poorly in Riga, and I threw off the mask,\nwhich I did again, but next thing I knew I came out of the operation all right. I stayed\nfor a number of days in the hospital. When I was brought back for further recovery to\nthe estate. Now came the issue \u2014 there were several issues. First of all, to find mother,\nand then I wanted to go to Palestine because there were people from the Jewish\nBrigade in uniform and out of uniform, legally and illegally, Hamburg to train us. Not\nonly to teach us Hebrew, the history of Israel, the history of Palestine, Jewish History,\nalso Hebrew, mathematics, so on and so forth, but prepare also for Aliyjah Bet which\nwas illegal immigration. And, the war to an extent, it\u2019s only in retrospect that\nradicalized me. Why did I suffer? I suffered because I\u2019m a Jew. Is there anything\nreally to be ashamed of being a Jew? No, I was ashamed when I met the girl that I\nfancied on the street, and, you know, shame came over me that I could not really talk\nand I really felt inferior which I never did before. But, this was a kind of a reaction I\nguess to my timidity at the time to having felt ashamed that I reacted the way I did,\nand was prepared to go to Palestine, prepared to take up a gun against the British\nbecause they were so horrible also to the Jews not permitting the Jews to come in,\ngiving maybe 1,500 certificates a month, and there were hundreds and hundreds of\nthousands and Jews who wanted to move to Palestine, so on and so forth, but this\ncomes a little later. When it\u2019s all started, and my mother and brother, especially my\nmother said, \u201cYou go west, never go east.\u201d You must remember your relatives in\nAmerica, and in England. In London, remember your Uncle Robert, Robert Schwab. I\nsaid, \u201cYes, of course. He visited us in Libau. I remember him well.\u2019\u201d\u2019 Remember to\nwrite simply Robert Schwab, Director Shell Oil, London, England it will arrive\nbecause he was one of the heads of Shell Oil, but I had forgotten that he was the\ndirector of Shell Oil. So, I wrote, \u201cRobert Schwab, London, England.\u201d It all went\nthrough military mail because you could not write. It went through the Joint\nDistribution Committee. It never arrived. To my cousin in Salt Lake City, I wrote,\n\u201cMr. David Alder.\u201d He was married to my cousin Anna Alder, who\u2019s in this\nphotograph who went to America, and there I wrote to Mr. David Alder, Director\nShell Oil, but he was not Director of Shell Oil, and it arrived to the local manager of\nShell Oil in Salt Lake City, letter after letter. He disregarded it, but one day he\ndecided to look up in the phone book in Salt Lake City who this David Alder was. It\nturned out that he was the owner of an insurance company in Salt Lake City, David\nAlder Insurance Company. So, he called David Alder and asked him, \u201cDoes the name\nGeorge Schwab mean anything to you?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, he is my wife\u2019s cousin.\u201d So,\nthis was a first contact. I wrote to my other cousin in West Hartford, Broskin, it never\narrived because it was just Dr. and Mrs. Broskin, Hartford, Connecticut. It never\narrived. But, this man, this one man, immediately contacted my uncle in London and\ncontacted his sister, his wife\u2019s sister in Hartford, Connecticut. So, they were already\nnow in touch, but my mother knew to write the correct. So, she independently got in\ntouch, and this way we connected. We were able to speak on the phone, on the\nmilitary phone once a week.",
        "Q: And, she was where?",
        "A: She was liberated in Lauenburg, it is on the map over there, already in March, and she\nworked as a nurse in the Russian hospital. Then, she heard later on in May or June\nthat there are a lot of Jews in Lodz, and maybe I am one of those who she could find\nin Lodz or get some information. Turns out that she arrives in Lodz, gets off a trolley\ncar and somebody says, \u201cFrau Dr. Schwab in German. Frau Dr. Schwab. Frau Dr.\nSchwab.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, who was it?\u201d It\u2019s is Mrs. Dorbian the son comes now several\ntimes had come to Latvia. He\u2019s my age. We were together in . It was his\nmother. \u201cDo you know that George is alive in the British zone?\u201d She didn\u2019t ask,\n\u201cWhere? When?\u201d She was so overwhelmed, she ran back to Lauenburg, picked up\nher few things that she had, and went to Berlin almost penniless, comes to Berlin and\nBerlin was a second home to her because she had been very often to Berlin before the\nwar especially in the \u201820s and early \u201830s. And, decided she was going to go to the\nJoint Distribution Committee. She went to the Joint Distribution Committee. They\nwanted to test her, \u201cWho is she?\u201d She didn\u2019t speak Yiddish. She looked like a\nthousand percent Aryan. So, they were suspicious because many wanted to do things,\nand she got away with no results, but she went back to the Joint several times, and\nthen there was a woman who said to her, \u201cYou know Mrs. Schwab, I believe your\nstory. I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d And, with the help of this person, she was able to write\nto the United States because again, everything had to go through military mail, and\nthrough them she found out where I am which the Joint was able to connect me then\nby telephone to my mother because the Warburgs, the Joint Distribution Committee\nand the American and the English Relief Unit were sort of the heads of the so-called\nchildren\u2019s home in the Warburg estate, were able to connect once a week. My mother\nwent to the Joint in Berlin, and I was, of course at the Warburg Estate, and it was pre-\narranged what time we would be talking. So, we started to talk, and in those days, it\nwas not easy to go from Hamburg from the British zone to Berlin because you had to\ngo to the British Sector or the American sector because we had to go by way of the\nSoviet zone, and it took months before I was brought to Berlin. But, in the meantime,\nwhen my relatives found out that I was alive, they started bombarding me with\npackages and money, and every single letter was five dollars, ten dollars, twenty\ndollars. Sometimes I received a package a day. I didn\u2019t know what to do with\ncigarettes and coffee, but they wrote me they coffee and the cigarettes are not for you,\nbut we\u2019ve been led to understand that there\u2019s a lot you can do with it in Germany. So,\nthat\u2019s for that purpose. Now, it may sound very funny, but it\u2019s true. I felt that I was\nnow an independent young man. I\u2019ve gone through the camps. I\u2019m going to live the\nlife of my parents, aunts and uncles. I am rich. I have now all this coffee, et cetera,\nand among other things, I managed to get myself a driver with his car. He came to the\nWarburg Estate. He always picked me up whenever I needed or wanted. I had my\nwine table in the Alhambra in the , It was a kind of a red light district I went to in\nthe evenings. For two cigarettes, I could get it at my age because it was my card\nI\u2019 dentitie.\nEnd of Tape 9\nTape 10",
        "Q: Okay, George, so you\u2019re now describing yourself as the reincarnation of that little kid\nwho knows everything. Now, you\u2019re a big person and you\u2019re all of what? Fourteen?",
        "A: Not yet.",
        "Q: Not yet fourteen.",
        "A: Not yet fourteen.",
        "Q: So, you have money?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You have \u2014 what made you go get a car and a driver? I mean, where does that come\nfrom? Is that really-",
        "A: Yes, I don\u2019t know how come that I got that driver with that car. I don\u2019t remember, but\nthey used to come around to Hamburg to , and they had a car, and I started out\nby saying, \u201cI'll give you a pack of cigarettes if you can drive me here or there.\u201d And,\nthen they offered that anytime I wanted, I could have the car with a driver. There\nwere two brothers, and they owned a factory on the other side of Hamburg, in\nHarburg with 200 people working, and they offered me, incidentally, to buy the\nfactory for ten pounds of coffee and 40,000 cigarettes.",
        "Q: That you should buy it?",
        "A: Yes. So, I figured, \u201cWhat do I need a factory for?\u201d",
        "Q: Oh, really.",
        "A: Yes, I did, ten pounds. I mean, I didn\u2019t have at that moment, neither 10,000 \u2014 40,000\ncigarettes. Which meant, I don\u2019t know, 400 or 4,000 packs of cigarettes and ten\npounds of coffee. First of all, I didn\u2019t have it. I had maybe a thousand cigarettes or\nmaybe two pounds of coffee, which was a lot in Germany at that time, but then I\nfigured, \u201cWell, I could ask my aunt, but what am I going to do? I want to have a good\ntime.\u201d And, I had now access to the Alhambra. With two cigarettes, you could get in\nany place.",
        "Q: And, your age, it didn\u2019t matter?",
        "A: It didn\u2019t matter with two cigarettes. That\u2019s what we called a Carte D\u2019identite, and\nidentification card.",
        "Q: And, you had your own table?",
        "A: I had my own wine table there, and it was very interesting, fascinating because you\nhad a kind of a telegraph system there with tubes. If you sat at table fifteen, and you\nwanted to dance with somebody at table eighteen, you wrote a little bit, \u201cLet us meet\nin the center of the dance floor, fifteen.\u201d And, I just had to write \u201cEighteen\u201d and it\nwould arrive by tube, and then we would meet or something or other. I knew about as\nmuch about dancing as I know about the ballet dancing (laughs), but I learned, et\ncetera, and because one of the things that I remembered very well became the rage in\nLatvia before the war in the late \u201830s was the Tango, and a particular type of Tango\nNaturno. It was one dance, and the Lambeth walk. People went crazy tangoing and\nLambeth walking. So, I was sort of going to live their lives.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: There\u2019s a German expression Kleiner Mann Was Nun? It was a novel written by, I\nforget the author\u2019s name, \u201csmall man, what now?\u201d In other words, looking at it in\ntoday\u2019s terms, at that time, I didn\u2019t know about the author nor about the novel Kleiner\nMann Was Nun, and I in the evenings were not really supervised as much at the\nWarburg Estate. As long as we were there in the morning for hitamulut is what they\ncalled it in Hebrew, the exercises, callisthenic exercises, appearing in class, doing\nsome homework. We didn\u2019t take studies very seriously. Much more interesting was\nwhen we learned a little about how to smuggle arms, and this and preparing for Aliyah\nBet, not to sit with this dry stuff mathematics or, so, who needed it. Anyways, in the\nmeantime, Julius Goldberg met up with his wife. She was liberated in Cologne \u2014 in\nKiel, sorry, in Kiel. And, she was in one of the barges that didn\u2019t come to Neustadt in\nHolstein but went to Kiel. And, then he became Norbert Wollheim\u2019s driver. Norbert\nWollheim became the head of the Jews of the British Zone. And, Norbert was\nheadquartered in Lubek, Germany, and Julius would drive him when he had to go to\nKiel, to Hamburg, orto _. So, usually when Julius had to drive himto _, he\nhad to go by way of Hamburg. So, Julius would come to swith Wollheim, pick\nme up, take me to to the DP camp where I met Yosele for the first time, Yosele\nRosensaft, Manachem\u2019s father, for the first time. That was in \u201945 still. And, then\nwould drive me back either to or at times take me all the way to Lubek where I stayed\nat the Wollheim home with his first wife, beautiful woman incidentally, and that\u2019s\nhow I reconnected with Julius. This is how I reconnected with Eugenia. They were\nliving in a DP camp in Kiel at the time, and I visited them also in Kiel if Juluis picked\nme up. I saw Eugenia for the first time since the liberation. And, in the meantime in\nHamburg, I did this. I did that.",
        "Q: Are you still playing cards?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t play cards. I didn\u2019t need to. I made my money in Neustadt in Holstein\nplaying cards.",
        "Q: That was enough?",
        "A: It was enough. I had plenty of money.",
        "Q: And, are you still getting money from relatives?",
        "A: Yes, getting money in every single envelope, I had at any time, I had at least a\nhundred dollars in cash.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: At any time because in every single envelope there\u2019s five dollars, ten dollars,\nsometimes twenty dollars coming from especially from my cousins in West Hartford\nand Salt Lake City, and sometimes I would get two or three letters a day \u2014 a week\nfrom each of them. In every envelope, there was five dollars or ten dollars or twenty\ndollars.",
        "Q: Do you have a lot of self-confidence now?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You do?",
        "A: Very much so.",
        "Q: You feel very sure of yourself as a kid there, right?",
        "A: As a kid.",
        "Q: I\u2019m not talking about right now.",
        "A: Oh, I thought right now.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Ah?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t think of it in those terms, but the answer is yes.",
        "Q: Because you seem to have a way of getting around and figuring out things and...",
        "A: Yes, because I was living the life of my parents and my relatives.",
        "Q: Do you take any \u2014 do any of the other kids do what you\u2019re doing that you\u2019re with? Or\nare you alone?",
        "A: I was pretty much alone.",
        "Q: You were pretty much alone?",
        "A: I was pretty much alone.",
        "Q: I have tell you, I can barely fantasize it at your age.",
        "A: No, I was pretty much alone, yes. I have a photograph with my drivers in Hamburg.",
        "Q: Yes, we\u2019ll show that.",
        "A: You have them.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So, what was your question?",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s a kind of self-confidence. It\u2019s not clear to me exactly where it\ncomes from, but you obviously have a fantasy of what life ought to be.",
        "A: Just fantasy as it was.",
        "Q: And, you wanted to live it.",
        "A: I was living a fantasy, but I fanaticized before the war because I found it very, very\nexciting when they talked about when my mother and father were for the first time in\nParis in 1928 at Maxime\u2019s when the dinners my parents attended in the private home,\nthe private residence of my aunt in Berlin, for the diplomatic core, where Hindenburg\nwould say to my aunt, \u201cYou are my Garbo. You have to sit next to me.\u201d et cetera. She\nwas very strikingly beautiful woman. She basically looked like Garbo, and the whole\nlifestyle that we lived was a kind of a fairy tale which I never lived again because I\ndidn\u2019t have any means. But, as a child I at least fanaticized right after the war and\nwhatever I could, I did. Then, came the day when I was brought to Berlin to meet my\nmother.",
        "Q: Wait a second, on the telephone didn\u2019t you ask her about nightclubs in Berlin?",
        "A: No, it was \u2014 that is coming. I\u2019m coming to this one. In the car, I was taking by the\nJoint finally in May 1946 to Berlin. I was thinking, \u201cDo I really want to go and meet\nmy mother?\u201d",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: Am I going to live the old lifestyle again with governesses who are rigid \u2014 a certain\nrigid approach? Because now I\u2019m a man of the world. I had my own car. I had\nmoney. I was able to do as I pleased. I\u2019m not so sure that I want to see my mother\nagain especially if she would insist on the same type of rigidity, not the walls, but\nrigidity to which I was accustomed to. So, when we arrived finally late in the evening,\nmy mother lived privately, not in a DP camp, we lived privately in Berlin, I was\nbrought up and the person \u2014 her name was Selma from the Joint Distribution\nCommittee from the Bronx, lovely, lovely woman \u2014 and I saw my mother, and I gave\nher pro forma, a kiss, and she gave me pro forma, a kiss, and the first thing I asked\nher was, \u201cTell me, mother, what is the nightclub situation like in Berlin?\u201d I wanted to\nshow her who am I. She looked at me and said, \u201cThat\u2019s a very interesting question\nthat you\u2019re posing. Did you know that until now, I was here all alone in Berlin, but\nnow that you are, we\u2019ll be able to explore it together.\u201d She disarmed me on the spot,\nand I was satisfied with the answer and was looking forward to a life in Berlin.",
        "Q: So, did it turn out to meet the fantasy?",
        "A: It turned out, yes, but rather than going to nightclubs, we went to some very\ninteresting cafes. We didn\u2019t go to a cabaret. I don\u2019t remember, no, because I don\u2019t\nthink I could get in in those days, but I dragged my mother literally to two to three\nmovies a day, two to three movies.",
        "Q: A day?",
        "A: A day, sometimes from on movie out into the second. Later on in New York, my\nmother said, \u201cWell, when you came and you had a problem.\u201d But, she was really\nwonderful. For example, she decided to sleep with me in the same room. I had\nnightmares, and she would jump up and calm me down from the nightmares,\n\u201cEverything is fine, George, we\u2019re together.\u201d And, I went back to sleep, but lasted for\nmonths and months and months. And, then she said, \u201cGeorge, I'll do everything\npossible in my life to make life as wonderful for you as possible for you to forget\nthese horrible years.\u201d And, she did it. But, then when she saw that she had a problem,\nshe said, \u201cGeorge, let\u2019s go, there\u2019s a DP camp. There\u2019s some sort of a school, and you\nmay meet interesting people there.\u201d And, I was always interested in meeting\ninteresting people. I didn\u2019t cherish the idea of a school, but let\u2019s go and look at this.\nAnd, lo and behold, I went to this school where Renia was my classmate. I was the\nyoungest in my class.",
        "Q: Schlachtensee.",
        "A: Schlachtensee, exactly, I traveled everyday by elevated from where we lived privately\nin Berlin to Schlachtensee camp and then I went back because in Hamburg, we were\nall juvenile delinquents, and we didn\u2019t take classes all that seriously \u2014 spitballs. We\nused to shoot spitballs at the teachers. So, I thought we\u2019d do the same in Berlin which\nto an extent we did. We were not , and didn\u2019t have schooling for how many\nyears? Four or five years. I was a semi-literate buffoon with high falooting ideas.",
        "Q: You lived a very brutal life.",
        "A: I lived a very brutal life, yes. That is true, but there were some very attractive girls in\nthe other class including Renia, and her two girlfriends, Tunia and Rachelka\nFeigenbaum.",
        "Q: And, Renia, Chris\u2019s-",
        "A: Chris\u2019s sister.",

        "A: Three, four years older than me.",
        "Q: I thought it was less.",
        "A: No, and I was the youngest, and they used to go the to all these places, and I\nwanted to tag along because after all, I have from the basis of my experiences, and\nRenia would dismiss me as this little jerk schnesel, \u201cHe wants to go with us.\u201d And,\nthe other young ladies, attractive young women laughed at me, and I felt very\ninsulted, and I say to Renia even now, \u201cTI still haven\u2019t forgiven you.\u201d (laughs) We\nhave a good laugh over it, but at that time, I took it very, very seriously. They just sort\nof dismissed me as, \u201cThis little jerk wants to join us ladies\u201d going to the , going\nto the Fifth Avenue of Berlin, to the exclusive places where they went, et cetera, as if\nI was a zero, so to speak.",
        "Q: Did you and your mother talk about what had happened to each of you when you\nseparated?",
        "A: Over the years, yes, we talked a lot.",

        "A: Not at the beginning. She wanted me \u2014 she desperately wanted me to forget, to\ninvolve me in other things, to involve me in other things.",
        "Q: She was really smart with you, wasn\u2019t she?",
        "A: Yes, she disarmed me and she became more like a pal going with me to the movies.\nLater on in New York, she would say, \u201cI thought I was going out of my mind at\ntimes\u201d, she would say to me. So, but, these were also formative years. These were\nalso the years, where I became very much involved in betar. I don\u2019t know if you\nknow anything about betar, the revisionist outfit. I went in eventually to the Stern\ngang. I was really radicalized, but this 1s a chapter in itself post World War II.",
        "Q: And, I think we want to take a break now. Did you like being in classes with the\nJewish Brigade?",
        "A: Yes because there are certain things I learned which I did not know before \u2014 the\ngeography of Palestine, the history, the Alijah bet, the British policies towards the\nJews, the which I did not know anything about in Russia that led to the\nestablishment of the first _, the first among others, how the Jews turned this\nwasteland into a thriving community. We saw pictures of Tel Aviv, wonderful, and I\nwas very anxious to go to a warm climate because during the war in the winter years\nwhen it was freezing cold, I swore to myself that if I were ever to survive, I will go\nand live in a country that has a warm climate. Never again do I want to experience\nwinter, and here I am in New York.",
        "Q: You are, right? (laughs)",
        "A: Yes, and then of course we began to study Hebrew, too, and I picked up a smattering\nof Hebrew, the alphabet, sentences here, sentences there, so on and so forth, which\nwas good because later on I joined the Stern, and then I studied in Israel for a while in\nthe early \u201850s.",
        "Q: Did you want to go to Palestine?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Before leaving Europe and you wanted to go directly to Palestine.",
        "A: I wanted to go directly to Palestine, if need be, fight. I wanted to \u2014 we were being\nprepared in Hamburg for Alijah Bet, illegal immigration because of the-",
        "Q: And, you were being trained to fight.",
        "A: We were being, not as yet trained to fight, but we did smuggle some radios, this and\nthat that we managed to pick up. Nothing very dangerous so far as guns or so, not at\nthis stage of the game, a little later, yes.",
        "Q: And, does your mother know that you\u2019re doing this?",
        "A: My mother didn\u2019t know a thing.",
        "Q: She-",
        "A: No, she was in Berlin.",
        "Q: So, this is before.",
        "A: This is before, yes.",
        "Q: This is in",
        "A: Yes, this is in ,",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, life on the estate was wonderful. We had socials. I was always looking forward to\nthe socials, the dances, and with certainly what they call in Hebrew , the folk\ndances where the girl has to come and pick you up rather than you to the girl, which I\nliked very much, and I \u2014 no it was very nice, actually.",
        "Q: So, when you went to Berlin, and you\u2019re going to the school Schlachtensee-",
        "A: Schlachtensee",
        "Q: Schlachtensee, do you still want to go to Palestine? Or are you giving that up a little\nbit?",
        "A: I am \u2014 my mother began to talk to me, and she always said even out of context to me\na man without an education is no man. It didn\u2019t register very much. I thought myself\nof being highly educated.",
        "Q: Right of course.",
        "A: The illiterate that I was, and then she loved to read books, and she would say to me,\n\u201cT don\u2019t understand George, how anybody can go through life without reading a\nbook.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested, period. I wasn\u2019t interested in studying. I wasn\u2019t\ninterested in reading. I was interested in enjoying life, what life has to offer. Then,\nshe said, \u201cLook, until age 21, I\u2019m in charge of you\u201d, but she didn\u2019t put it \u2014 she put it\nin very diplomatic, polite language, \u201cand before you can make up in your mind if you\nwant to go to Israel, but I want you to come with me to America where you can get an\neducation. Here in Europe, and you see what Europe 1s like, we will be lost. There\u2019s\nan opportunity. At least you\u2019ll get an education.\u201d And \u201cWhere are going to in\nAmerica?\u201d She said, \u201cNew York.\u201d Well, New York was interesting. I remembered the\nfilms, the speed, the size, the skyscrapers, some of the films. The idea was intriguing\nprovided, of course, that eventually I can go to Palestine, to fight 1f need be. She said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, after 21.\u201d In the meantime, she would have me, obviously, for six, seven\nyears, I guess to brainwash me. So, we decided that we would go to America, and my\ncousins provided the visas, and actually they paid for us to go second class, business\nclass on either the Queen Mary or the Queen Elizabeth, and the Joint promised that\ntickets would be issued for us for to go on the Queen Mary or Queen Elizabeth. We\nwould go by way of Paris to Marseilles \u2014 yeah, Marseilles I think it was \u2014\nembarkation and \u2014 no, not Mar \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the port, and the Joint \u201cpocketed\u201d\nthe money.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, but my cousin said later on, \u201cLet\u2019s forget. They used it for others.\u201d And, we\nwent on the SS Marine Perch which was a troop carrier. That was in March 1947. We\nleft Berlin together with the Lermans.",
        "Q: This is Miles Lerman.",
        "A: Chris Lerman.",
        "Q: And Renia Laks, who is the sister of Chris.",
        "A: Chris\u2019s yeah, and my mother and I. We all went together to Bremin. We all sort of\nlived together. Aboard ship, Miles and I, we were bunking together, and my mother\nwas bunking with Renia and Chris. So, the twelve days, we were also together aboard\nship, and then we landed in New York. And, I was very disappointed because I was\ntold in Berlin, the night before, you can already see the lights of New York. So, the\nnight before, I stood on the deck looking for the lights of New York, and I didn\u2019t see\nany. It was a clear night, and I believed it, and then we docked on 42\u2122 or was it 44\"\nStreet and Twelfth Avenue, and these were shacks. I was so disappointed, and it was\na misty morning. I didn\u2019t see any skyscrapers. I just saw the West Side Highway. This\nwas my first shock of the new world.",
        "Q: You thought it was all a fake.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t think it was a fake, \u201c\u201cWhere is it?\u201d et cetera, and we were awaited there\nby some relatives who took us to Brooklyn actually, Borough Park where we stayed\nfor six weeks, and my mother didn\u2019t like it. So, we moved to Manhattan. But, I loved\nit in Brooklyn in the meantime. I was registered there in the New Utrecht High\nSchool in Bensonhurst, and there I fell into an interesting group of Jewish activists, so\non and so forth, and one thing led to the other, but this is now coming to the United\nStates, already in the United States.",
        "Q: Brooklyn doesn\u2019t have many skyscrapers in comparison with Manhattan.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Brooklyn didn\u2019t have any. There was a Hotel St George, I think that was\nabout twelve or fifteen stories, but nothing like the Empire State Building.",
        "Q: How was your English then? Was that okay?",
        "A: Pretty good. It wasn\u2019t good, but I would say it was pretty good. I understood,\nsometimes. That\u2019s an interesting story about going to school. It was obligatory of us\nto get a high school degree, and I lived in the district in New Utrecht, and it was an\nuncle by marriage that took me to New Utrecht, to Brooklyn, and in Bensonhurst, and\nI was overwhelmed by the most gorgeous teachers in the world who looked to me like\nseventeen, eighteen, but where actually \u2014 they were actually seventeen, eighteen, but I\nfigured they must be in their late 20s or 30s because they had manicured nails. In\nEurope, this was forbidden for students. No lipstick permitted, no powder, no\nmascara, or anything. So, I thought that they were all teachers. I said, \u201cMy god, this 1s\ngoing to be interesting.\u201d",
        "Q: And?",
        "A: And I registered. I was registered and I started only to find out that they were all\nstudents, wonderful, one more gorgeous than the other, especially the Italian girls.\nThey were young, they\u2019re absolutely gorgeous, and I skipped a lot of grades. Hebrew\nfrom - they tested me and put me immediately into Hebrew six, the last semester. So,\nI got credits as a foreign language. English, I started with English one. They put me in\nthe most fundamental course, but was transferred shortly thereafter to English three.\nSo, I managed to skip a number of grades. History \u2014 World War II history, I didn\u2019t\nread about it, but I knew more than the kids 1n class. In short, I graduated high school,\nwhich I would have never been able to do in the gymnasium in less than two years,\nNew Utrecht High School. To my mother, this was heaven. At least, I have a degree\nnow. Now, let\u2019s see where we go from here.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape 10\nTape 11",
        "Q: Okay, just a couple of things about what people\u2019s impressions of Europeans were like\nwhen you came. So, the people thought that you lived a very primitive life, I gather.",
        "A: Yes. First of all, I heard the first time the term \u201ccoot\u201d\u2019",
        "Q: \u201cCoot\u201d",
        "A: \u201cCoot\u201d and I came home to my uncle and aunt, and I said, \u201cThe girls say that \u2019'm a\ncoot. What does it mean?\u201d Cute, but as I understand it, and never knew the word cute,\nthat I was cute. They thought I was cute, et cetera.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s nice. That must have made you feel very good.",
        "A: Yes, I was delighted, and I sort of reciprocated. I don\u2019t know what term I used, but\nthen it was very interesting. I had a science teacher who in one day said, \u201cLook how\nadvanced we are and how backward Europe is. In Europe, the people don\u2019t even have\neyeglasses.\u201d I raised my hand and said, \u201cNot so, my brother wore eyeglasses. There\nwere eyeglasses. I saw many people with eyeglasses.\u201d \u201cOh, you\u2019re dreaming.\nCertainly not in those days before the war, maybe now here and there, but there were\nno such things as eyeglasses.\u201d And, he had eyeglasses and some of the students had\neyeglasses. We have eyeglasses. Then I remember some of the friends that I made\nover there, I visited their homes in Bensonhurst and in Borough Park, and they said to\nme, \u201cLook electricity.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d And, they were surprised that I was nonplussed\nby it because they said, \u201cIn Europe, you don\u2019t have this.\u201d I said, \u201cWe had electricity.\u201d\nSo, they were thinking that I was spinning, or running water or things like these, and\nwhen they asked me how I lived, and originally when I explained, they thought that I\nwas fibbing. So, I decided to shut up, and just listen and not say anything because\nwhat I encountered here were I guess middle class people who had no inkling what\nanother type of lifestyle may be, and my mother did the same. Only among her\nfriends, she had plenty of friends here from pre-war Europe, we knew at our homes,\nthe homes of my relatives, et cetera where the surroundings were sumptuous. So, in\nthis milieu, I kept my mouth shut because they just didn\u2019t believe me.",
        "Q: Did your mother speak English when she came here?",
        "A: Her English was not as good as mine because she grew up with French, and English,\nshe did not participate directly in the tutorials that my brother and I had in Libau, but\nshe was a voracious reader, started immediately to read the newspapers, started\nimmediately to read some of the easy novels, English novels, and picked it up, picked\nit up.",
        "Q: Did she play cello when she came here?",
        "A: No, she actually thought of getting a job at Radio City Music Hall because the person\nat that time, his nickname was Pipke. He was a friend of the family way back in\nLatvia. What was his name, and he was the head of the music of the orchestra in\nRadio City Music Hall. He converted \u2014_ and my aunt, I remember, telling the story\nbefore the war, and I saw Pipke in a train going from Berlin to wherever she was\ngoing, and suddenly Pipke is there with a big cross, and I said, \u201cPipke, what are you\ndoing with this cross?\u201d And, he said, \u201cWell, this and that. So on and so forth, et\ncetera, et cetera.\u201d But, my mother went to see him, and he knew that my mother\nplayed, but she said, \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t play for years. It could take me\u201d et cetera, and\nthen he said, \u201cI can offer you something for maybe thirty dollars a month in those\ndays or so. She figured because we were living on an allowance from the Joint at that\ntime, and my mother didn\u2019t want to keep on getting money from my relatives. She\nwanted to be independent and we did not \u2014 later on we found some moneys back that\nwe had in Europe, but it was a few years later. So, it was tough, but she said for thirty\ndollars, I can\u2019t make ends meet, et cetera. So, she declined, and I guess he was just as\nhappy that she declined. I assume, but he was prepared to give here \u2014 but, she had a\nvery rare cello, my mother, by name \u2014 by a man named Schweitzer who did many,\nmany cellos, but only two cellos for women, and my mother had one cello of the two\nwhich were taken by the Germans, and she got it from my grandparents when she\nbegan the music conservatory, this cello. I often claimed, and I don\u2019t know if I'll ever\nsee anything by it, but the Germans confiscated this as well, this cello.",
        "Q: So, did she end up working?",
        "A: Yes, she actually for a while, she always loved to stitch maybe a pillow or something,\nand she was offered something if she wanted to do even at home, if she wants to do\nsome stitching on men\u2019s jackets, working piece work. So, she took this and made\nsometimes a hundred dollars a week, which was a lot of money in those days in the\nlate \u201840s, but once we started finding some of our funds back, not the major ones, et\ncetera. So, things began to be easier. The first couple of years were difficult years,\nyes.",
        "Q: But, then it got easier?",
        "A: Then it got easier.",
        "Q: When did you join the betar?",
        "A: Through the friends that I made in, at Utrecht, New Utrecht. It was a very heavily\nJewish group over there, quite radical, that accorded with my tastes, and I became\nvery active in betar in the Borough Park Chapter, and then the issue became whether\ntojoin___ or the Stern, and there was a tremendous discord over one issue \u2014 the\nbombing of the King David Hotel. The issue was to forewarn the British or not\nforewarn the British. insisted that 1t was right to forewarn the British even if\nthey would not take the warning seriously. As it happened in the case of the King\nDavid Hotel, but so that the innocents will not suffer. The Sternists argued that all\nBrits are our enemies, look what they\u2019re doing to us, hardly permitting any Jews to\nmigrate to Palestine, and we are not going to forewarn the Brits. And, I was so\nradicalized over the issue of Jewishness, even though I knew relatively little what it\nmeant, that I joined Stern, and there we seriously trained for all sorts of things\nincluding assassination. Interesting, before I quit Stern, that was a chapter 1n itself\nbecause I was nearly shot for it \u2014 before I quit Stern, we were going to assassinate Sir\nGladywn Jebb. Sir Gladywn Jebb at that time with a British rep at Lake Success at\n_____. Why were we going to assassinate him, like we assassinated Lloyd Moyne in\nEgypt in 1944? Assassinated Bernadotte? Because, not because he was not a nice\nperson. He was actually a very nice person, but he represented Britain, Britain\u2019s\npolicies toward the Jews in Palestine. So, he was a target, but for various reasons, I\nquit the Stern group. There was a court proceeding.",
        "Q: You were court marshaled?",
        "A: In a sense, yes, court marshaled for quitting, so on and so forth. But \u2014 and we were\ntrained here on a farm in Jersey. Does the name Josephson mean anything to you?\nJosephson wrote the book, \u201cThe Robber Baron\u2019s\u2019\u2019, his brother, I think it was Murray,\nbrother\u2019s name, prominent Wall Street lawyer, and his wife. They let us \u2014 their estate\ngave us for basic training. We were trained by Sternists hiding here in the United\nStates. The Brits put the price 5,000 pounds in those days, for their heads, and we\nwere trained. We smuggled arms, ammunitions. We learned assassination tactics. We\nlearned all sorts of things on the estate. The FBI and together with Scotland Yard\nbegan to discover what we were doing. So, we had to empty out or __s~ what we\ncalled storage place of guns, ammunitions, in the Lower Eastside. We dumped it all in\nthe East River. Some of my colleagues were caught. I was not caught dumping some\nof the stuff in East River. But, an interesting incident happened that affected me very\ngreatly. Our headquarters was on Second Avenue, around Eleventh Street, 149\nSecond Avenue, and there wasa___ right nearby, a little sort of a synagogue which\na where students could study the _, and I went there in order to say kaddish for\nmy father, and I come in and the Rabbi said, I said to the Rabbi, \u201cCan you please help\nme? I don\u2019t know how to put on __, how to put on all the rest. I want to say\nkaddish for my father.\u201d \u201cWhat happened to your father?\u201d \u201cHe was killed during the\nwar.\u201d He said, \u201cThey were right to kill your father for not having taught you the\nJewish ways.\u201d That turned me off. I go now, Yom Kippur, once a year to say kaddish\nto a synagogue, but otherwise I don\u2019t go. It\u2019s wrong maybe because of one stupid\nRabbi having said this, but it affected me emotionally very, very much, this little\nincident. It wasn\u2019t so much a little incident.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a big incident.",
        "A: It was a very big incident, and it was right near our headquarters here in New York on\nSecond Avenue I remember, but the reason I decided to quit Stern because after the\nState of Israel was created, established, Stern decided not to disband, continue as an\nunderground movement. Arrogated to itself the right to kill fellow Jews, if they,\nespecially the leaders, if they did not agree to the idea of the Shtei gadot |\u2019jardein\nmeaning two sides of the Jordan, but it\u2019s the old tradition of Palestine.",
        "Q: Greater Palestine.",
        "A: Greater Palestine, and that was can assassinate those Jews, and after having suffered\nwhat I have suffered, et cetera, kill a fellow Jew? As young as I was, I had enough\nbrain, and as uneducated as I still was, I had enough brain to say, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sit\nright.\u201d \u2014 was reason number one. Number two, after the state of Israel was declared to\nbe a sovereign state, the ideological head, somebody by the name of ___ who\nentered parliament in Israel, too at the time, took us into a Marxist-Leninist mode that\nthis is something that we should strive for, we must strive for. It is the ideal world. By\nhaving lived in a Marxist-Leninist Totalitarian System, even if I didn\u2019t understand it\nvery much, and the hush-hush talks et cetera so that I shouldn\u2019t understand, this also\ndid not sit right. So, at a certain moment, I decided to quit because the movement had\nbecome my life.",
        "Q: It had?",
        "A: It had where we used to clean our arms and ammunition in my apartment, in my\nroom, and my mother happened to be home and suddenly knocked at the door, and\nsaid, \u201cGeorge, may I please see you?\u201d And, I came out, and she said, \u201cWhat are you\ndoing there?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re just playing some games.\u201d \u201cAre you doing\nsomething with arms, revolvers or so?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, mother.\u201d She said, \u201cYou know,\nmy suggestion is at least close the window so the neighbors shouldn\u2019t hear what\nyou\u2019re doing.\u201d So, she knew suddenly what it was all about, and I told my mother that\nwhen I\u2019m going to be 21, I\u2019ll go to Palestine to fight. She said, \u201cWhen you\u2019ll be 21,\nwe'll talk about it, but in the meantime you must also get your education.\u201d So, I was\ncombining the two. Anyways, there was a court marshal of me in a basement on\nFifty-First Street, Thirteenth Avenue in Borough Park basement, where I was\nthreatened with my life if ever I were to give up the idea of the two sides of the\nJordan, traditional Palestine, if ever I were to approach another member of the Stern\ngroup that I knew, if ever I were to disclose anything that transpired here in the\nUnited States, and our cell structure, so on and so forth. I promised, of course, I\nwouldn\u2019t do anything of the sort, and they said, \u201cFine, these are our warnings.\u201d And,\nthis came to me as a terrible shock because the movement had become my life, and\nmy closest friends I could no longer see, spend time with, or even talk, and I\nremember traveling to Brooklyn every morning going to New Utrecht from\nManhattan because I loved Brooklyn, and from time to time I would see some on the\nsubway, my buddies, they looked away as if I was a traitor. The way the girl looked\naway when I had the star, and that affected me enormously because the movement\nwas part of my life. This withdrawal, for six months I had difficulty sleeping I\nremember, and then it went on. In the meantime, I entered college which I wasn\u2019t\nvery much interested, but the Stern group said that we had to go to City College,\nwhy? In those days, City College was excellent, because you had a special professor\nthere, Hans Cohen, the father of the study of nationalism, et cetera, and he was\nteaching there, and some other courses, but especially nationalism, what it\u2019s all about\n\u2014 implications, et cetera, et cetera. So, I took the exam and I managed to get in. It was\nan eight hour entrance exam in those days, very tough, but I managed to get in, and I\nworked at the same time to help out. I didn\u2019t want \u2014 I knew that my mother was\nstruggling even though she never said a word, et cetera. So, I wanted to make some\nmoney on the side. So, I worked in the library. I worked as a runner for a friend of\nmine, here in the jewelry district who opened a business. So, I managed some way or\nother always to earn between ten and twenty dollars a week on top of studying et\ncetera. So, but I did not have to depend on my mother\u2019s meager income. Then, I \u2014 at\nthe beginning, it didn\u2019t interest me very much, the studies, but suddenly, something\nclicked and I began to read voraciously because my mother kept on saying always,\n\u201cYou know, a man for me, is not a man without an education.\u201d And would say to me,\n\u201cHow can one really live a life without reading a good book.\u201d The literature Pushkin,\nLermantov, Thomas Mann et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is part of life.\u201d Because\nthey used to discuss it at dinner tables as a child. It didn\u2019t interest me. Characters,\nwho cared? The character\u2019s in a book. Ideas were ridiculous. But, suddenly,\nsomething snapped, and I couldn\u2019t stop reading, and I began to read a lot, day and\nnight, and what interested me particularly was a history of World War II, and one\nthing led to the other, led also to literature, led to philosophy, led to even an interest\nin the sciences. For a while, I thought of studying medicine. I met a young woman\nwho was going to study medicine. Her father was a doctor. She was interested in\nmedicine. So, I figured I would also take some courses, and I took courses along\nthose lines, but I reacted very poorly to formaldehyde. Pus developed under my eyes\nand we had to dissect pigs and rats, and from all the formaldehyde, I began to get\nrashes here on the side. So, I really had trouble, not that medicine interested me, but I\ndecided to have something in common with the woman that I thought I fancied. But,\nso much the better that I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: So, you got yourself a PhD in Political Theory, yes.",
        "A: Well, first, yes, Political Theory because I majored originally in history, then Political\nScience, and then PhD, actually PhD in Political Science because I had majored in\nHistory and I always felt when I became already sort of semi-educated that you can\u2019t\nbe a good Political Scientist without a thorough knowledge of History especially the\nWestern Tradition from Antiquity to the Present, and you could not be a good\nhistorian, without an understanding of political relations between and among states,\nand international relations, so on and so forth.",
        "Q: So, this must have made your mother really happy.",
        "A: She unfortunately didn\u2019t live to see that I got because my first PhD was rejected as a\ndissertation, which subsequently was published and is now cited all over the world,\nand opened up an entirely new field of study in the English speaking world. So, I had\nto write a second dissertation, and that hurts me very, very much that my mother did\nnot see the success subsequently. The second PhD got me into foreign policy.",

        "Q: That\u2019s really something.",

        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Now, during the Russian occupation, though, your father isn\u2019t earning a lot of money,\nreally. The money that he has possessed, that the family had, was not confiscated as\nfar as you know.",
        "Q: Right. So, are you \u2014 1s there any apprehension that there\u2019s going to be a war coming\nto Latvia, that the Germans will do something that this won\u2019t stay-",
        "Q: So, this deportation, this mass forced deportation, you think it had nothing to do with\nthe Russians thinking there\u2019s going to be a war. They just did it.",

        "Q: You could?",

        "Q: You did? With you parents?",

        "Q: How \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether at the time you would know, but perhaps only\nafterwards when you talked with your mother, how did she take to doing this?

Yeah,\nactually, it must\u2019ve been already \u00b038 after the Anschluss in \u201938. I must\u2019ve been about\neight. She came especially from Riga after coming back from Vienna to Riga, she\ncame especially to Libau. She said she 1s going to make from me Viennese\nsandwiches, and anything along those lines was of interest to me, and when she\nserved me on the little piece of bread, piece of Wienerschnitzel or whatever, I said,\n\u201cWell, I know what this is. It doesn\u2019t interest me.\u201d So, finally, my mother asked,\n\u201cWhat would interest you?\u201d And, I said, \u201cI would love to go to Hotel Petersburg, and\neat over there.\u201d That was a hotel in Libau, and had also a beautiful restaurant, also\nwas private rooms, et cetera, and she would take me there late in the afternoon about\nfive, five-thirty or six, and I would always have my cocoa there, hot chocolate, and\nlittle sandwiches with hard boiled egg on top of it, a small piece of tomato, and\nanchovies, and whatever I \u2014 whenever I would get it I would sort of put it into the\ncocoa, into the hot chocolate and eat it. It was what I loved, but everything \u2014 with\nanchovies with everything. Some people complained actually, and the manager of the\nhotel came and said to my mother, \u201cMrs. Dr. Schwab\u201d, that\u2019s the way we used to\naddress people, \u201cThere\u2019s some people who object to seeing your son put everything\ninto the hot chocolate and eat it then.\u201d So, we were given a separate room, and for six\nmonths, I did this, and then I started eating again. I had some sort of disorder,\nwhatever it was, I don\u2019t know, but for about six months, we went almost every single\nday to the Hotel Petersburg in Libau, and that\u2019s how I ate, and also I continued at\nhome to put everything into hot chocolate. Hot chocolate, whatever I had was hot\nchocolate sandwiches.",
        "A: No, it was just tasty.",
        "A: It was tasty, and whatever else I liked were desserts \u2014 cakes, and cakes naturally are\nfantastic. So, I remember always also during the day, et cetera, sneaking 1n sometimes\nalone or with an aunt of mine or with my governess going to a particular caf\u00e9 in\nLibau for just cakes. I just loved sweets.",
        "A: Yes, because it was a problem, and my father also. I don\u2019t know to what extent he\nknew what to do or didn\u2019t know because in those days, actually, if a father was a\nphysician, he was not permitted to treat his son. You had to go to someone else, and\nthe pediatrician, my pediatrician, was a man by the name of Dr. Rabinovitz, who was\nthe father of the head of \u2014 later on \u2014 the head of intelligence in Israel, , and\nwhose nephew was the Israeli Ambassador here, Rabinovitz in Washington. They all\ncome from Libau, and the father, Dr. Rabinovitz was my pediatrician.

        "A: It lasted \u2014 yes, that\u2019s what my mother told me after the war when we discussed it. It\nwas, she said, many, many months probably up to about six months that we had to do\nthis.",
        "A: Well, I would say by the time the war broke out, yes, when we didn\u2019t, yeah. And,\nactually, it was yesterday, I think, yes at the Holocaust Museum that I had some hot\nchocolate for the first time in years.",

I would tease him this\nand that, so on and so forth, and sometimes he got angry at me I remember, running\nafter me and sort of hitting me over my rear because I really teased him a lot. I\nremember once on a tennis court, after I annoyed him, but he was really wonderful,\nand until he was taken away, I mean, he took very, very good care of me when we\nwere just the two of us and we were alone, yes.",
        "A: He was easy going, yes. He loved to read. He devoured reading, and it\u2019s very\ninteresting. The last two years of the Gymnasium, he remained sitting. He failed\nbecause he was interested in his own agenda just to read. He was interested, and he\njust kept on reading and didn\u2019t care about school, but this happened with me too when\nI went to school. One day, I remember coming home and declaring, \u201cI know\neverything there is to know. I know how to count to a hundred.\u201d I knew the alphabet.\n\u201cAnd, I\u2019m not going to school anymore or if I have to go to school, I will simply not\npay attention because I love to play with my games and toys, et cetera, et cetera.\u201d\nAnd, sure enough I failed every course save English because English was something -\nyou were a wizard if you learned English and very, very few people because my\nparents were brought up with French, but I was brought up with English. I had British\ntutors and so did my older brother. So, I passed only one subject.",
        "A: English, and that was English. I remained sitting, and what was \u2014 what happened was\nwar broke out and the first thing in 1941, I thought, \u201cMy god, war broke out now. I\nwill not have to go back to school.\u201d",
        "A: That was very \u2014 that was a relief that I would not have to go back to school.",

        "A: They accepted what I said, and they let me play, and I played a lot. I was fortunate to\nhave a lot of toys, and I just \u2014 trains and trains, toys, all sorts of toys. I was imaging\nthat I was a general \u2014 that was already in 1939, 1940 \u2014 on the Line and a\ncousin of mine was the general of the Siegfried, yeah, he was Siegfried Lineland, and\nI was . We played war, and we had tanks and we had airplanes, and we had all\nsorts of toys. The cousin, this cousin actually is still alive. He\u2019s older than I am. He\nlives in Salzburg now. So, we often, whenever we meet, we talk about our days when\nwe used to play war.",
        "A: Yes, yes, and that was also a little bit embarrassing because about \u2014 thinking about it\nin anticipation of today, about fifteen years or so ago, there was a gathering of Latian\nJews, and I, not thinking, I made the statement that I do not remember \u2014 there were\nno, I said, \u201c\u201cCategorically, there were no poor people in Libau who were Jews in\nLibau.\u201d So, they snickered at me saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t know this. You and your family\nprobably didn\u2019t know that there were poor Jews in Libau, but there were plenty of\npoor Jews in Libau.\u201d This came to me as a surprise. I should\u2019ve thought it through,\nobviously, but I had never met \u2014 let\u2019s put it this way \u2014 one who was not, well, well\nendowed from this perspective.",
        "A: We had a large apartment, very large, probably \u2014 well, not probably, it was\nconsidered the foremost apartment building in the city, yes. It had ten rooms.",

        "A: Well, yes he would \u2014 what we called lunch was dinner, and in the evening was\nsupper, and we had dinner very late about two, two-thirty because my father between\nten and twelve he saw patients 1n the office, or was it nine-thirty. Then, he also made\nhouse calls. Then, he would come for lunch, go out again on house calls, and then he\nhad office hours, if memory \u2014 memory serves me right, from four to six. But, he had\nso many patients that he sometimes did not come and have supper before eight, eight-\nthirty when I did not see him because I was already in bed or whatever.",
        "A: No, it was always interesting conversation, and when I was finally permitted to join\nthem, when I was sufficiently trained, I enjoyed it very, very much. But, then, when I\ndid sort of things that were unacceptable at the table, I was sent back.",
        "A: To my room.",
        "A: I would eat there with my governess.",
        "A: But, when I was permitted to sit at the table \u2014 see, I try to make sure that I wouldn\u2019t\nreally spoil things because I didn\u2019t want to be sent back.",
        "A: But, from time to time, I was sent back.",
        "A: Mostly my mother, yes. My father thought everything was amusing. He did not\ncontradict my mother, but I remember one little incident when my father came in \u2014\nwhich very often happened. He was not there on time at two or two-thirty when we\nwould have the lunch. He came in late, and he just paced in the dining room, and my\nmother didn\u2019t talk to him and he didn\u2019t talk to my mother which was unusual, and it\nstill sticks in my mind. It happened once.",
        "A: Well, I had a nanny as a\u2014 when I was a very small child. She was Russian, Fanya,\nand I adored her. She was \u2014 I just could\u2019ve sold my parents. She was \u2014 she was it so\nfar as I am concerned, so far as I was concerned And then I was being prepared that\nI\u2019m going to be a big boy, and the summer we were going to spend in Riga Beach,\nand when I will come back, I will have a governess and no longer my nanya, my\nnanny, and I didn\u2019t really understand what they were saying, and we always went\nsummers to Riga spend time at the Riga beaches, to the resorts in Riga. And, when I\ncame back, she wasn\u2019t there, and I just didn\u2019t understand it. And, I remember crying,\nbut then we had engaged a German governess, Fraulein was her name. She was\nvery strict, more in my mother\u2019s tradition than in my father\u2019s tradition which was\nleisurely. My mother was much more Prussian in this sense, and the governess was\nalso in that tradition.",
        "A: No, but I had no choice.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember complaining to her. I even think I had a crush on her. She was,\nas I remember, very attractive. She probably was, I don\u2019t know, I guess must have\nbeen in her late 20s or so.",
        "A: And, I thought she was very attractive, and I actually tried to behave.",
        "A: I tried. Whether I did or not, that\u2019s something else, but she taught me so, proper table\nmanners. She taught me also had to greet people. We were also taught how to walk\nproperly. This was part of our-",
        "A: No, also with the homework, et cetera, and we would play games together. We would\ngo out on walks and meet friends of mine, et cetera. We were there with the other\ngovernesses, yes.",
        "A: Well, when I was in school, let\u2019s say I was in school \u2014 I would come home. There\nwas my governess. In the morning, no she was not a live-in governess. I got-",
        "A: No, she was not a live-in governess. She would come in the morning, but breakfast,\nmy mother did not serve me breakfast. It was our housekeeper, and she was always\nthere when I came home or would pick me up from school, and then we would come\nhome. We would go for walks. We would do this. We would do all sort of things, yes.",
        "A: My mother used to be a professional cellist.",
        "A: Yeah. She went to the famous Riga Conservatory which was a very, very famous\nschool where as Isaac Stern once put it, you could go to any of these Russian\nviolinists, it doesn\u2019t matter who it is, they all came out from Riga, from the\nconservatory. She was playing a lot, but not professionally. Every two weeks or so,\nthere were chamber music evenings at our house. She would drag her cello, go to the\nhomes of other people where they\u2019d play, and evenings when they would go out a lot,\nthere was an opera, there was a theater in Libau. There were people who would come\nto our house for card games, kind of gin rummy that they used to play, and then there\nwere big events in the house where the men would play a game called , and the\nwomen would play gin rummy which they called in Latvia, Kunken.",
        "A: Kunken, K-u-n-k-e-n, it was a kind of gin rummy. I tried to mingle sometimes, and\nsometimes I actually succeeded and she did not say anything, but there was a very\ninteresting incident that I remember. I loved dogs, but my mother did not permit us to\nkeep dogs in the house. So, I would bring stray dogs to the house.",
        "A: Into the house.",
        "A: But, we had several entrances, bring it in through the rear entrance where we had a\nvery large kitchen and a maid\u2019s room, in between the kitchen and the maid\u2019s room,\nthere was another little corridor. And, my mother hardly ever went into the kitchen.\nSo, she didn\u2019t know what was going on, and I kept the dog over there in the rear and\nwe also had a balcony. One day, there was a big card game at the house. The men\nwere in one of the living rooms what we called , and my mother and her lady\nfriends were playing canasta in the dining room, and the housekeeper came in and she\nwas not called. Instead of addressing her as Frau Doctor Schwab or Mrs. Doctor\nSchwab, \u201cIt\u2019s either the dog or me.\u201d My mother said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you mean? What do\nyou mean? What dog?\u201d \u201cWould you please mind coming into the kitchen?\u201d She got\nup, went into the kitchen and the dog went flying out. So, then, of course, I was called\nin. I said, \u201cLook, I mean\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. The dog simply followed me. I\ndidn\u2019t bring it. I had nothing to do with it.\u201d But, I loved this dog so, and this is just an\ninstant that does come back to my mind.",
        "A: Yes, it left. No, the dog left, unfortunately, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes.",
        "A: I never liked the cello.",
        "A: No, but she also played the piano. We were forced to play the piano as children. I\npreferred to piano. I didn\u2019t like the cello. I preferred, of all the instruments, I\npreferred the violin, but my favorite instrument 1s still the piano.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: But, I was \u2014 before I hated it because I was forced to play it for something like five\nyears. My older brother, too, and my mother would sit there and listen to us play, and\ncorrect us so on and so forth, but we had teachers who taught us.",

        "A: My father was about twenty years older than my mother, and it was interesting\nbecause my father was engaged several times before he met my mother, and he came\nback \u2014 and this was in Riga, he came back from an engagement with a cousin of his\nand going back to Libau because my grandfather was at that time sick apparently.\nAnd, on the railroad station, he saw my mother with a number of other young women\nseeing off somebody on a train that was going to Germany. And, my father said to his\ncousin, \u201cThis is the woman I\u2019m going to marry.\u201d So, his cousin, whom I knew, he\ndied about twenty year ago in South Africa, said, \u201c You\u2019re crazy.

After two weeks, he senta _.",
        "A: A___.. Well, Dr. Schwab is probably Jewish, and then my parents said, and all of\nthem, the sisters, my mother was the youngest \u2014 all the sisters and brothers said,\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s take a look at him. Let\u2019s invite him and take a look at him. Let\u2019s look at\nhim.\u201d So, two weeks later, they invited him and he came to Riga, and he came in and\ngreeted everyone, and my grandparents\u2019 apparently had lined up the six sisters. There\nwere Six sisters and three brothers in the family. And, to see if my father would\nrecognize the one that he wanted. The nerve that he had, he came in, and walked over\nto my mother and gave her a kiss. And, then said, \u201cLook, I have to get some\nmedications here in Riga for my father. Would you like to accompany me?\u201d because\nhe had therea__\u2014\u2014_\u2014. It was awhat you would call here a driver _..",
        "A: A _____ in Russian, and they went out for a few hours to get the medication. They\ncame back, and my father announced that they had decided to get married. My mother\ndidn\u2019t even know anything about it, and that he will be back in two weeks, and\neverything can be ready. My mother said to me later on, she was so embarrassed to\nsay no, et cetera, that she said to her parents, \u201cYes.\u201d But, her parents kept on saying,\n\u201cLook, you don\u2019t have to go through with it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d But, she made one\ncondition to my father. He had a mustache. That he would have to-",
        "A: Take it off because she didn\u2019t like mustaches. So, what she did \u2014 they got married,\nand then he said, \u201cWell, now we\u2019ll go to Libau.\u201d So, my mother was under the\nimpression that he would stay in Riga and move in with the rest of the family because\nshe was not interested in going to Libau. And, later on when she spoke of home when\nwe lived in Libau, home to her was always Rega, which was very interesting. It was\nhome. It was a very happy marriage I must say. They adored each other. And, I must\nsay that I grew up in, despite the sternness of my mother, I grew up in a very warm\nhome.",
        "A: Oh yes. She was affectionate, but stern. There was no nonsense. There\u2019s a right way,\nand there\u2019s a wrong way, period.",
        "A: Not only from my mother, but I also from the cousin from South Africa. We were\ntalking about, and he recounted it. And, also from an aunt of mine who \u2014 and some of\nmy mother\u2019s friends in New York.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, but they did, and there\u2019s still a woman actually in London who 1s a very close\nfriend of one of the people who works with , very close family friend, but\nmore my brother\u2019s age than my age, who said it was an idyllic marriage.",
        "A: She was around 17.",
        "A: Sixteen actually, no 17, and on her 18\" birthday, my older brother was born.",
        "A: Apparently not so young I those days.",
        "A: But my mother was the first of the sisters to get married. Some never got married.\nTwo of them never got married, but she was the youngest. She sort of paved the way.",
        "A: Well, in Libau, we had trolley cars, and I loved going in trolley cars. My life\u2019s\nambition was to become a conductor.",
        "A: Yeah, and when we would go on the trains to Riga, my life\u2019s ambition was to become\nan engineer who drives a locomotive, or whatever you call them. This was my\nhorizon. And, when the planes starting flying between Riga and Libau, passenger\nplanes, I\u2019ve never been on a passenger plane Riga-Libau, I wanted to be come a pilot.\nSo, speed, in other words-",
        "A: -1s very important, and where did I get it because I saw a lot of the American movies\nin Libau where you saw in New York, bridges going up, cars, all these things. It made\na tremendous impression on me. I loved American movies. I loved Shirley Temple\nand I went around saying she was a cousin of mine. (laughs)",
        "A: Well, these were kids. (laughs)",
        "A: Yes, Bobby Breen, Tarzan movies, Bobby Breen, Shirley Temple, these were-",
        "A: These were big things for me as a child, yes.",
        "A: My father said it\u2019s not good to be a doctor.",
        "A: Yeah. The reason \u2014 and my mother reinforced it saying that his was called out very\noften at night, at three o\u2019clock at night, and he made these phone calls \u2014 he made\nthese house calls, sometimes at three o\u2019clock in the morning on an emergency, when I\nwould wake up and here the telephone ring, et cetera. I would wake-up. My mother\nusually accompanied him. There was a driver downstairs, and sometimes I went\nalong, and I stayed with my mother in the car and my father went in. But, I\nremember one incident with a Latvian patient, my father decided to take in the car \u2014\nthe back seat in the car with my mother and him \u2014 between my mother and him, and I\nwas in the front with the driver, and the patient was very, very sick and the patient\u2019s\nwife was also there and blamed the car.",
        "A: For making him sick. Well, these were peasants, obviously, and this is something that\nstill sticks in my mind today.",
        "A: Yes. Our \u2014 my mother tongue is German, yes.+",
        "A: First of all, we lived in Courland, which was once upon a time German ___ where\nyou had the German and also subsequently the Russian aristocracy congregating over\nthere. We were products of German culture over there. So, we did not grow up with\nYiddish. In Libau, by and large, at that time I did not know of anybody speaking\nYiddish. Let\u2019s put it this way. It\u2019s only in the ghetto that I learned about that. And, I\nremember my father saying, \u201cThat Yiddish\u201d and my mother also, \u201cwas not a\nlanguage. It was a jargon.\u201d A jargon. We used the French word in German, jargon.\nAnd, language 1s something that one has to be in command of. So, the first language\nwas really German that we spoke. When I was small and my parents didn\u2019t want me\nto understand something, they spoke Russian which, of course, bothered me. So, I\npicked it up because I heard Russian being spoken all over the place. I went to\nLatvian school, and Latvian school of course we spoke Latvian. Our main\nhousekeeper, we spoke Latvian. When we had another one, Fenya, she was Russian,\nand then my father in the building had a nurse, Maria. With her, I spoke German. So,\nI grew up with all these languages, but my language number one was German. Two, I\nwould say, was probably Latvian at that time. Three, Russian, and English four,\nbecause I really liked it, and I made a point of really getting it under my belt.",
        "A: Well, I remember one anti-Semitic incident. We all had uniforms, and one day I was\ncalled on to recite a poem. We had to get up. I got up. I started to read it, and the\nteacher said, \u201cYou can sit down. He reads like a Jew.\u201d I didn\u2019t think I had an accent,\nbut you didn\u2019t have to. You could be perfect and still be called a Jew for something. I\ncomplained. I went home. I complained to my father and my mother, and my father\nimmediately telephoned the director of the school. was his name. This was a\nLatvian school. He was a patient of my father\u2019s. He came to the house and\napologized to my parents that it would never happen. I was called in office. He\ndid not apologize to me. He turned the tables and said, \u201cYou have to be a good boy.\u201d\nI told this to my parents. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not going to happen again\u2019, et cetera, et\ncetera. In this class of about 25, there were three Jews, but when the teacher made\nthis remark that I read like a Jew, everyone started to laugh. It was very embarrassing\nto me, obviously, and this irked me. But, otherwise, I personally did not sense any,\nwhat we would call today, anti-Semitism. In those days, I wouldn\u2019t have known the\nterm, obviously. Next to our school was a Jewish School, and sometimes we had\nmatches \u2014 soccer matches \u2014 not soccer matches actually snowball fights. So, we the\nLatvians would fight the Jews, the Latvians school and Jews, but did not have any\novertones. It did not have any overtones.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yes. I always knew I was Jewish. We grew up in an assimilated family. I\nknew about Passover. Once or twice I went to the synagogue with my parents in the\nHigh Holidays and I loved Passover because of the matza. The matza was what\nthey called-",
        "A: No, it was cheese and egg on top, and don\u2019t ask me about menus, the finished product\nwas absolutely delicious.",
        "A: It was \u2014 no, you put egg on top of the cheese and then you baked it, et cetera, and\nthen you put some cinnamon and sugar on top, and it was absolutely delicious.",
        "A: Yeah. My mother was no good cook. She loved to bake, but had absolutely no talent\nwhen it came to cooking, and when she \u2014 I remember, this 1s an interesting incident,\nshe once cut her finger in the kitchen doing something, and my father got upset and\nsaid, \u201cIf I see you again in the kitchen, the entire staff will be fired.\u201d Your place is at\nthe cello and not in the kitchen.",
        "A: I heard this, yes.",
        "A: He was mad because it was a pretty bad cut. I don\u2019t know what she had done, et\ncetera, and later on when we came to the states and my mother had to cook for me,\nshe would go and buy steaks, the best steaks that she could get, and a steak \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow a couple of dollars in those days. She didn\u2019t know \u2014 she would make the steaks,\nand she said to me in the diminutive jocular, I don\u2019t know what I do, but you can play\nfootball with it because it was all to her cooking. She just did not know how to cook.",
        "A: How to do it, but when it came to baking, she loved it, and she loved to bake. But, for\ncooking, et cetera, this \u2014 speaking, coming back to what you asked me before about\nthese poor people. There was one schoolboy in my class, , and I became\nvery friendly with him, and he invited me over to his house. Not far from where we\nlived, and he lived \u2014 it must have been a very large room with his parents, a table in\nthe middle and a number of beds. We played. It must have been just underneath a roof\nbetween \u2014 I remember climbing a number of stories, a number of floors and then we\ngot into a kind of an attic. I think they must have lived in an attic, and I thought it was\nthe greatest thing because he was young and strong, and I was not. He was street-\nsmart, and I was not. And, I thought of how wonderful it is to live like this, how\nwonderful it is to be like this because I was the exact opposite, and I just enjoyed\nplaying with him, and I was invited. He died recently. He\u2019s on one of the photos that I\nhave over here. So, this is I do remember that I had this encounter.",
        "A: Probably three, four times or so, maybe more, more times et cetera, but not very\noften, no.",
        "A: Well, it became a kind of a role model for me to be smart, to be strong, smart, this\nand that. This also reminds me about school. School \u2014 you could, if you gave some\nkids protection money, they would protect you and you could have your commandos,\nand for a centime or two or so, you could \u201cbuy your protection\u201d and they would\nbecome your protectors, and I had my allowance, whatever, maybe a quarter a week\nwhich I would spend maybe ten centimes a week to pay off these guys.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know because there were school fights.",
        "A: There were fights among the kids.",
        "A: Then they would help me. Yes, they would come to my help if need by, but I never\ngot into \u2014 I don\u2019t remember having gotten into an actual fight, but just almost\nautomatically.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I used to swim and tennis, yes. These were the two things.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t good at soccer. I wasn\u2019t good at any of the other things, but I was good at\ntennis and I was good at swimming, yeah.",
        "A: Not from school. These were friends or friends of my parents and the kids with whom\nI associated with, with whom I played. My best friend was a chap by the name of\nSasha . Sashenka we used to call him. He was also a role model, and the parents\nwere the owners of most of the movie houses in Libau. So, we could sneak in back, et\ncetera, and watch then. He was very wild, and his language sometimes was off-color,\nand I would come home with the same language, and I was asked, \u201cWhere did you\nhear this word?\u201d \u201cOh, yeah, Sashenka used it, et cetera.\u201d So, for a while I was\nforbidden to see him, but the relations were soon repaired between the kids to give\nyou just an incident. He was wild. I was wild, but I always managed to play innocent.\nNothing was ever my fault. See, so.",
        "A: Well, I guess I had to learn.",
        "A: In the middle of the city, they had a big garden where they lived, and he would throw\nstones across a wall to the neighbors aiming at people. He would instigate me to do\nthe same.",
        "A: Yes, I did, too, et cetera and of course, there were complaints. \u201cAh\u201d, I said, \u201cForget\nabout these complaints.\u201d Sometimes not using proper language. So, I came home and\nI thought, you know, that to be a wizard. Like, knowing English is to be wizard, it\u2019s a\nterm that we used in Libau was , wizard.",
        "A: very actually, and yeah, so.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Oh, yes, oh, yes, I certainly did. I liked it very much, but I was always sort of put in\nmy place at a certain point.",
        "A: Yes, I could \u2014 I felt comfortable\u2014 let\u2019s put it this way. I felt comfortable in home\ncircumstances with my mother\u2019s friends so on and so forth, but I also felt comfortable\nin the milieu of my Latvian friend and the impoverished, and the impoverished part.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: Sasha was-",
        "A: Oh, yes, very privileged situation, yes, very privileged situation. Where he picked it\nup, I can\u2019t tell you. He had two older brothers, more my brother\u2019s age. Where he got\nit from, I don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s where I learned, yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I was-",
        "A: Oh, a lot. There were a lot of discussions, and I will never forget when the aunt who\ncame to Libau, she was going to make me these Viennese sandwiches so on and so\nforth, I remember still my aunt was saying to my father, the Anschluss was taking\nplace in Vienna when Hitler marched in, that Jewish women were forced to take off\ntheir furs and to wipe and polish the cars. My father said, \u201cYou\u2019re dreaming. I don\u2019t\nbelieve it. German Culture, Deutsch Couture, they wouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d And, my father,\nto an extent, was a product of German culture, and during World War I, the German\noccupation, they behaved very, very properly toward the indigenous population of\nLatvia. So, my father dismissed it.",
        "A: Even though she had seen it, he had dismissed it outright, and I remember this very\nwell, this incident.",
        "A: Very meaningful, yes.",
        "A: No, look, I did not have an analytical mind in those days, I mean, in retrospect. Of\ncourse, I was short-sighted on my father\u2019s side, yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Exactly, yeah.\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3",
        "A: Not that early on the concentration camps, no. The only incident that I remember\nabout treatment of Jews was the one related to my father by my aunt.",
        "A: That\u2019s the only one at that time, yes. I do remember very distinctly, the outbreak of\nwar in September 1939 from the radio. We had radio which we could hear the entire\nworld, and we heard the announcement from Warsaw when German bombers were\narriving and bombing and everyone was glued to the radio, and of course, the\ndiscussions why people in the Baltics were safe because we were called , sort\nof buffer states, and if the Germans were to invade, the Russians would come in.\nThey would immediately repel the Germans and vice versa, et cetera. So, that\u2019s why\nthe Baltics will remain immune to the war, and after all, as it was pointed out, and\nhere my memories were very keen because this was something new excitement. I\nliked exceptional situations, and incidentally my first book is titled, \u201cThe Challenge\nof the Exception\u201d because exception I find much more interesting than the rule, the\nnorm. This was very exciting, war. I didn\u2019t understand what it meant bombs falling,\npeople running, et cetera. This was exciting. A nine year, ten year, nine year old kid,\neight year old kid, et cetera, what did I know? I didn\u2019t realize, I mean, today I would\nsay I was a little jerk thinking about it.",
        "A: And, the discussions at the dinner table, supper, centered a lot about the war and what\nwas happening, and the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of August 23\", 1939 where the two\nhave come together, and after all, Hitler and Mein Kampfe was also saying that the\nreason \u2014 one of the reasons \u2014 why Germany lost World War I, and he will never make\nthe same mistake, is fight on two fronts, and after Poland fell, I mean the war was still\non with Britain and France, even though it was a kind of a phony war during the\nwinter years until April, May 1940. So, everyone felt safe in the Baltics. We felt safe.\nNothing is going to happen to us.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It was someplace else, yes. It was excitement, but someplace else. No, I didn\u2019t think\nSO.",
        "A: No, no, life was beautiful.",
        "A: Life was very, very fine, very beautiful, very exciting. I loved to go to Riga. I could\nnever understand why we lived in Libau in such a small city and not in Riga with 13\ntrolley car lines and Libau only two. More interesting cafes that in Libau, better\ngossip, I guess.",
        "A: Because the family is from Libau. My grandparents lived in Libau. We all were from\nLibau.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Actually, I remember it very well. I was on the Riga beach with one of my aunts and\ncousins and uncle, and my mother immediately came to Riga to the beach to fetch\nme, and I was in my aunt\u2019s apartment. This was already a day or two before it\nhappened, in my aunt\u2019s apartment which was not very far from the Soviet embassy in\nRiga, and from her terrace, I could hear over the loud speaker Vishinsky, the\nnotorious Vishinsky addressing the crowd, welcoming Latvia to the Soviet Union\nbecause the Soviets came in at the invitation of the Latvians, according to him, and\nfrom the balcony, from the terrace, I could also see how the Latvians were marching\nwith big banners, and I assumed that on those banners were \u201cWelcome Russia. We\u2019re\nfinally liberated from the dictatorship of \u201d Whatever. I only saw the placards,\nbut not what was on the placards. So, these marches \u2014 yes, I, I was in Riga on that day\nand I heard his voice, Vishinsky\u2019s voice.",
        "A: Everyone seemed worried.",
        "A: Everyone seemed worried, yes, but-",
        "A: Not me, no, no. I felt safe. I, some way or another, felt safe. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I never thought\nthat I had to worry about anything, let\u2019s put it this way.",
        "A: Well, this was-",
        "A: Yes, the adults in Riga, but my mother took me a day or two later, took me back to\nLibau, yes. So, in Libau, we went to the beach as usual, to the tennis courts still in the\nfirst few weeks, et cetera. Finally, we were permitted to talk to Russian soldiers\nbecause the Russians had established bases in Latvia already in September, October\n1939 as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, but we were not permitted to talk to\nRussians.",
        "A: Yeah, but now we were permitted to talk to Russians, and I remember on the beaches,\nthe Russians, also Russian soldiers, Russian trucks on all the beaches, and we could\nget these Russian insignias what we called , et cetera. So, we begged them,\net cetera. But, soon after the occupation, we were all notified in our building where\nwe lived that we had to evacuate, and evacuate it rather rapidly because it became\neventually the headquarters of the Communist party for the Libau and the region\naround Libau, but we received an extension for a couple of months. First of all, they\nneeded my father\u2019s expertise, and we had to find a smaller apartment which turned\nout in my mother\u2019s mind to be a disaster because we had to live in six rooms. How\nare we going to manage six rooms? My God...",
        "A: About ten. How are we going to do this? I had to double up with my brother. We had\nthe same bedroom. My father was not permitted to put up \u2014 to have an office, but he\nwas permitted to see private patients because, again, of his specialty. So, he had a\nkind of a sitting room where his library was, but all the X-ray machinery,\nmachinery, all this was stored in the maid\u2019s room.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, because he became head of the policlinic over there at a salary and everyone\nlaughed at it in the family of something like 30 Rubles a month. We were not\ndependent obviously on the 30 Rubles a month. And, he started getting patients for\nwhich I don\u2019t think, I mean, he charged. I remember the admiral of the fleet or\nsomething along those lines, came and consulted my father and he even came to our\nhouse for dinner, the admiral, and I remember this because I admired his uniforms\nand the illustrious medals that he wore. That was in the new apartment that we had.\nIn the old apartment, we had to take in a Russian soldier. Everyone had to take in\nRussian soldiers because Libau was a major base for the Russians, and Libau had\nthree ports that never froze in the winters and that\u2019s why you had also a very big\nnaval port in Libau where part of the Russian fleet was stationed. So, it was very\nstrategic significance. Libau as a city, and that is probably why Libau was much\nbombarded by the Nazis in \u201941 when they invaded, and in \u201944 and \u201945 \u2014 and there was\na lot of fighting in and around the city, and the city was about at least 85 percent\ndestroyed in contrast to Riga which was not a strategic site, and there was relatively\nlittle fighting, and the city, by and large was preserved, is preserved.",
        "A: He lived in a room, yes. He came, but sometimes drunk, had very curious habits, not\nwashing himself, but spraying himself with a kind of an autocologne that smelled\nterribly, but this was common apparently among the Russian soldiers. Different\nculture- different habits, et cetera, and people used to laugh. I remember my parents \u2014\nthe Russians loved music, and they would go to the opera, an in those days when you\nwent to the opera very often you put on a tuxedo and long dress so on and so forth.\nSo, the Russians wanted to show how well they can dress. So, some of the women \u2014\nthe wives of the officers came in long nightgowns.",
        "A: Yeah, and I remember snickers about this. I certainly do remember this, but then they\ndistinguished you had still officers from the old Czarist days, and this I remember my\nparents saying what a difference it makes from these , | mean the ordinary,\nfrom the old days. The aristocrats versus ___. Youcan See, of course, immediately\nthe difference. Or, if they try to be like the aristocrats, you just have to scratch a little\nbit and you saw where they came from.",
        "A: He was very friendly, very friendly. He would come. He would sleep. He would\nleave, but this was his room. He had the keys to the apartment.",
        "A: This I don\u2019t recollect. I don\u2019t recollect him eating in the house. Maybe in the kitchen\nor so. I don\u2019t recollect this in the dining room. I don\u2019t recollect this, but we also had\nto \u2014 we could no longer have sleep-ins.",
        "A: Well sleep-ins, I mean, because nobody was permitted to be a housekeeper.",
        "A: No more staff, no, but a woman Fenya, this woman who didn\u2019t sleep-in but always\ncome in to work. She kept on coming to clean up the apartment.",
        "A: That was still okay, yes.",
        "A: Good question. I remember one incident \u2014 no, I think 1t was Stepha, no, Fenya who\ndid some of the cooking, but I remember one incident in the morning when we lived\nin the new apartment, and I had to go to school, my mother would prepare the\nbreakfast for me and said, \u201cLet\u2019s do it very, very quickly, and we\u2019ll eat in the\nkitchen.\u201d And, I said to her, \u201cI\u2019m not a maid.\u201d",
        "A: Yeah, I said to her, and I remember that very distinctly, and my mother reminded me\nof this after the war. It seemed funny to eat in the kitchen, and this brings back a very\nfunny story. My father had a cousin in Libau, Rabinovitz, whose two sons\nlived here in the United States. One son used to accompany a musician. He had\nCarnegie Hall in 1925 so on and so forth until died, I think in 1929 if my\nmemory serves me right. And, then he became a big here in Hollywood\nplaying behind mostly the piano. And, in 1936 or 1937, he came to Libau and begged\nhis mother to come and live with him in Hollywood, leave Latvia, and he said,\n\u201cMother, I\u2019m going to build you a house with a Hollywood kitchen where you can eat\nin the kitchen.\u201d She said, \u201cEat in the kitchen? For this I should move to America?\u201d To\ngive you just an anecdote, but the mentality.",
        "A: Yeah. \u201cEat in the kitchen? For this I should move to America?\u201d",
        "A: Yeah, and that reminded me of my little incident.",
        "A: I was a kid, yeah.",
        "A: Well, 1t was much, much smaller the apartment. My father was working. He saw\nprivate patients, but could not use his X-rays or his laboratory, et cetera. That was all\ngone. Did we starve? Food became more scarce. Let\u2019s say a person could not buy\nmore than, let\u2019s say a pound of sugar per month. I\u2019m thinking of an arbitrary-",
        "A: -figure, but I do remember if we wanted to have meat, it also became scarce, and our\nnew apartment was not far from the marketplace, and every person could buy so\nmuch and so much meat. So, I went online to buy a pound or a kilo or half a kilo, I\ndon\u2019t remember, and I paid. So, we had \u2014 and, my mother went online. So, that\nbetween the two of us, we were able to buy enough for a sumptuous meal. To give\nyou just one idea.",
        "A: It was. I remember this very distinctly, yes, per person. So, therefore, my mother went\nprobably an hour later or so, and I went at nine. I don\u2019t know what time it was, at ten\nor she went at twelve, whatever.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Everyone.",
        "A: Yes, everybody\u2019s in the same situation, yes. Everybody was in the same situation.",
        "A: They\u2019re communists and we were vitriolicly anti-communist, and in my class, almost\neveryone joined the Communist Pioneers. I did not because we belonged to the\n\u201cBourgeois Class\u201d and we were \u2014 the class was being lambasted all the time. And, we\nwere scared, but nothing seemed to happen, nothing happened until one week before\nthe outbreak of the war.",
        "A: \"41, exactly one week before the outbreak of the war, on Sunday, suddenly Russian\ntrucks appeared all over the city telling you you have to pack your things and leave.\nWe'll take you to Russia. We didn\u2019t know whether we would be taken, too, but a lot\nof the well-to-do people, a lot of the Jews, also Latvians, but proportionally more\nJews than Latvians, were taken and shipped off to Siberia and to that part of the world\nin cattle cars, and this was just one week, exactly the Sunday before the outbreak of\nthe war between Russia and Germany.",
        "A: I think it was both. I think it was both. Again, I can\u2019t be a hundred percent certain, but\nI just know we were anti-Communist, and it was my decision not to join the youth\nmovement. Again, my parents didn\u2019t say anything that I had to or so. My father felt\nprobably significantly secure again because of his specialty as a gastroenterologist,\nnot to be too worried, but still, and also the fact that he had prominent Russians now\nfrom the Russian Army and the Russian Navy as patients.",
        "A: I just didn\u2019t agree with them, and I didn\u2019t \u2014 at that time, I tried to intuit myself into\nthat situation. At that time, I simply thought that Communism was wrong. Why? I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "A: See? Of course, we were chased out of our apartment, but in contrast to the other\nones, we were permitted to stay there another month or two, but I do remember my\nmother complaining, \u201cHow are we ever going to live in a six room apartment?\u201d",
        "A: It was the library, living room, dining room, two bedrooms, I had to double up with\nmy brother, and in order to get into the \u2014 not into the, we had different \u2014 the toilet was\nin a different part of the apartment from the bathroom, and my parents to take a bath,\nthey had to go through our bedroom, my brother\u2019s and my bedroom. So, there was not\nthis privacy. So, wait a second, in Europe we don\u2019t call the kitchen a room, or the\nmaid\u2019s room.",
        "A: No, so, actually to us, the library, living room, dining room, two bedrooms \u2014 five, and\nthere was a kitchen \u2014 six, and the maid\u2019s room, actually seven, seven rooms, but it\nwas \u2014 and the rooms were much smaller than we had originally. A little footnote\nabout this. I was persuaded by \u2014 I don\u2019t know if the name means anything \u2014 Per\nAhlmark, Per Ahlmark former Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, played a very big\nrole in Jewish life since the \u201870s, \u201880s \u2014 very pro-Israel, very pro-Jewish, convinced\nElie to go back tos and accompanied Elie to \u2014_ and wrote about it for the\nSwedish press. It was he who persuaded me to go back and accompanied me too, and\nwrote a series of articles in the Swedish press about my return to Libau. Before we\nwent into any of my apartments where I lived in Riga and Libau in 1990. We had the\nPresident\u2019s car and one his \u2014 another one his drivers, and also one of his deputies so\nwe could get into any apartment. I said, \u201cPer, before we go into any of these\napartments, from the outside I will tell you exactly the layout so you will not think\nthat I\u2019m imaging or inventing certain things.\u201d Later on he told me, \u201cGeorge, I\u2019ve\nnever seen anybody who has such a memory\u201d, because I was precise on every single\nissue. For example, before I went into the apartment, I said to him, \u201cWe had central\nheating.\u201d You see? And, I told him exactly where it is, and I showed it to him which\nwas still preserved. In Riga too where I used to stay with my aunt in a very luxurious,\nlarge apartments. At that time in 1990, my aunts, she was the only person. She had an\natrium apartment. There were about three or four families living, and I showed him in\nthe room where I used to sleep, et cetera, dining room, living room, sitting room,\nlibrary, et cetera. He said, \u201cYou know this memory\u2019s absolutely\u201d because, I found \u2014\neverything I found to be fascinating, the big world. Now, I heard these talks about\nwhen my parents talked when they were in Paris and Berlin and went to the cabarets,\nthis and that. That\u2019s what I wanted to do, and my aunt with whom I stayed, she was\nmarried to the Chinese envoy to Germany who died in 1935. Whose father was\nalready ambassador in the days of Bismarck, the Germany, and when she would talk\n\u2014and so I always thought of foreign policy. I didn\u2019t know what it was, but the\nlifestyle, I just loved it. I ate it all up, et cetera. The diplomatic life, what my mother\nwould tell me about when they were in Berlin in the \u201820s, what was going on so on\nand so forth. For example, my mother loved to go in the subways. She said, \u201cI came\nhere in order to see Berlin.\u201d My father had lived in Berlin because he had studied\nthere. \u201cI want to see Berlin. I go by bus.\u201d My aunt said, \u201cBut you have my car with a\ndriver. What\u2019s the matter with you, Clara?\u201d My mother said, \u201cNo, I am going to go in\nthe subway. I am going to go in the elevator. I\u2019m going to go in the buses. I want\u201d\nShe looked at her as if she was crazy, and it turned out later on, and my aunt told me\nthat my mother knew Berlin better than she knew it.",
        "A: Yes, because this aunt had survived and died in Riga about 20 years ago.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And, Per, as I said, who is very often speaks at Jewish events in the United States and\nin Israel, as I said, and very close to Ellie, and he comes with me all the time, every\ntime I go back to Latvia, or almost every time. He has been with me.",
        "A: 1990 was the first time, yes, and I think we had sent you some \u2014 Sheila sent you some\nmaterial on this.",
        "A: Of my first visit, how Per convinced me to go.",
        "A: That\u2019s Per.\nEnd of Tape 3\nTape 4",
        "A: Correct, Elie Wiesel.",
        "A: Yes, and it was for one year, but I still went to school, and that\u2019s when I really failed\nall the subjects.",
        "A: Yeah, and war was kind of a relief for me when it broke out. The first thing that came\nto my mind is, \u201cI will no longer have to go to school.\u201d",
        "A: Yeah. Wait a second. Yeah, that was the year.",
        "A: That was the year.",
        "A: Not in uniform, but when the war broke out, we could not run to Russia because it\nwould have been considered desertion. It was considered that he had to be on the spot\nfor his duties.",
        "A: No, the week before the outbreak of the war, these were the so-called \u201cmass\ndeportations\u201d",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: With the mass deportations? No.",
        "A: No. These were forced deportations. The trucks arrived. \u201cFamily X \u2014 we\u2019re looking\nfor A, B, C, D\u2014 Family X you have to be packed what you can carry with you in two\nhours, and we\u2019re taking you to Russia to work, work camp. You\u2019re a Bourgeoisie.\nThat is you belong to the Bourgeois class.\u201d And, that was that. And, proportionally\nmany more Jews were sent out than Latvians because he Jews were in certain of the\nprofessions, and also in many of the businesses.",
        "A: That was our interpretation at the time.",
        "A: That was our interpretation.",
        "A: Lutheran.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He just graduated gymnasium, and before the war the talk was after he would\ngraduate gymnasium, of course, you couldn\u2019t send him to Germany to study at the\nuniversity. So, they were going to send him to England. Why to England especially\nCambridge? Chemistry. He had some inclination in that direction. So, they figured\nthat he would end up in England studying Chemistry. My mother later on told me that\nbefore Hitler came to power, it was assumed that we would \u2014 the kids \u2014 would study\nat one of the German universities.",
        "A: But, certainly, England, the talk of England came in only later on when Hitler was\nalready in power that they would not be able to send him to study in Germany.",
        "A: Well, my mother told me that we had withdrawn a large sum of money before the\nRussian occupation occurred from the bank, a considerable amount, but not\neverything should be suspicious, so only a part. And, we were able to exchange some\nof it into Rubles, but there were price controls in the Russian period. So, if you made\n30 Rubles, you had to pay the rent maybe with three Rubles or four Rubles, but\nmoney was not an issue and wasn\u2019t \u2014 and I remember the snickers about the 30\nRubles that he was making, or 35 Rubles perhaps, but it was very low. It was in the\n30s I remember, but it didn\u2019t matter to us personally.",
        "A: No, no because according to the Ribbentrop Molotov Pact, Latvia and Estonia and a\ngood part of Lithuania fell under the Russian sphere of influence and subsequently\noccupation, and that Germans would not dare attack Russia. This behemoth for as\nlong as the war still is going on in the West. So, there were no fears of war.",
        "A: That\u2019s a very good question, and that\u2019s still being speculated about. Stalin and\nMolotov were convinced, and I\u2019m not talking now as a child. I\u2019m talking about with\nmy knowledge as an academic, where convinced that there would be no war with\nRussia \u2014 with Germany at this time. The lower downs believed that there will be\nbecause the Germans were sending spy planes all the time. In fact, the week before \u2014\ntwo weeks before the outbreak or three weeks before the outbreak, we could see\nplanes very, very high up.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: You could see them, yes which we assumed were not Russian planes.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: We were not suspicious. That was elsewhere, the war, not \u2014 it would not come to the\nBaltics. We did not like the Russians, but in comparison, of course, the Russians were\nthe lesser evils.",
        "A: Yes. Well, the point is, later on in comparison to the Nazis.",
        "A: Yeah, but we were, the family was together. We really did not starve. We were not\nsent out. Friends of ours were deported, yes, but my aunts and uncles in Riga were\nnot deported. So, by and large, by and large, we were satisfied. Of course, the press\nwas a controlled press. My parents now spoke much more often in Russian in front of\nme for fear that I should not go to school and say something anti-Communist, and\nthen be arrested because a child had said something. I sensed it of course, and I\nresented the fact that my parents did not trust me, and that was probably one of the\nreasons I did not join the Russian Youth Movement, the Young Pioneers because\neverything was now hush-hush at home for fear that I may squeal because I was a\nchild.",
        "A: Yes, because I was vitriolicly anti-Communist like my parents, and I sensed it at\nhome, what I overheard, what I understood from their Russian, et cetera, I kept my\nmouth shut, but nevertheless, they had to be cautious. I understand. I understand it\nnow. I didn\u2019t understand it at the time obviously.",
        "A: I continued to speak German with my parents, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was Latvian.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, oh, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it was a harsh occupation before the deportations. Freedom of the press,\nof course, was curtailed. Harsh from the viewpoint of physical harm, no, until the\ndeportation, yeah.",
        "A: I\u2019ve read that people were arrested for anti-Communist, anti-Bolshevik statements, so\non and so forth. Yes, we heard about this, but the immediate circle, our immediate\ncircle, as I understood it at the time, was not affected.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Very well, I remember the outbreak of the war very well. Actually, what happened,\nthe war, the Germans invaded on a Sunday morning, early morning. Saturday night,\nmy parents went to sleep only at three or four because they played cards at our house.\nThere were about six or seven ladies played Gin Rummy, I mean Kunken, and\nsuddenly early in the morning, there was lots of noise, bombs being dropped et cetera\non that Sunday morning, June 22\", of \u2019\u00b041, and now we had a terrace in the rear, a\nbalcony not a terrace, actually only a balcony. And, we all went out to see what\nhappened, and we saw German planes, , flying very low where we could even\nsay hello to the pilots and they sort of winked back at us because it was very low,\nbombing certain parts. We didn\u2019t know what was happening. We turned on the radio,\nno news. The news about the outbreak of the war did not come for hours because the\nRussians were taken by surprise. They didn\u2019t know. Subsequently, I read in the\nhistory books that Stalin thought that 1t was not Hitler behind this, the went\nbehind Hitler\u2019s back because Stalin and Molotov were convinced that the Germans\nwere not going to invade, and now suddenly, they did invade. So, the bombings \u2014 this\nwas very exciting. Again, our building was not hit. It was someplace in the center of\nthe city. I did not immediately see any ruins, but as the Germans were moving closer,\nthey occupied Libau one week after the outbreak of the war. My father took us to the\nhospital which was a little bit outside of the city in a safer neighborhood, and we\nstayed there for a couple of days until the Germans came in. But, during the\nbombardment, we also stayed one night in a basement in the center of the city in a\nkind of a policlinic, a small hospital, and there I saw a lot of the destruction already,\nand that became to dangerous to stay there in the center of the city because this was\nbeing bombarded by the German Navy and subsequently by the Army. So, we moved\nto the larger hospital outside the city \u2014 well, it still was in the city district, but in the\nresidential area right near the beach, and I distinctly remember when the Germans\narrived, the Latvian doctors asked my father to accompany them to \u201cwelcome the\nGermans\u201d with roses, et cetera, and my father went and asked about the Jews and the\nLieutenant in the car, and I remember him coming back saying the Jews have nothing\nto worry about. We now have a common foe, and we must fight this common foe and\nthe Jews are part of this war. In the naivety, fighting if you fight together we\u2019re\ncivilized Germans, not racists, et cetera. Like in World War I, if you fight\nCommunism, fine and good, and he was sort of assured, and in a certain naivety, he\nbelieved and made us rather believe that we have nothing to worry about, or maybe\nhe just wanted to keep us calm as could be the case.",
        "A: He came back.",
        "A: Yeah, he told us and my brother, my mother and me et cetera, yes, and we all\nlistened, et cetera. There was a kind of a command car that appeared and he was part\nof the welcoming committee that he was asked to participate, and in this context he\nasked about the Jewish question, and he was assured by this officer.",
        "A: That, Yeah.",
        "A: Originally, I\u2019m convinced. Again, this is my interpretation that he did not genuinely\nbelieve my aunt when she said-",
        "A: -what had happened with the Germans with the Jewish women polishing the cars with\nfurs. Later on, my interpretation again, is that he did not want to worry the family. So,\nhe always looked at the glass half full rather than half empty. That\u2019s my\ninterpretation.",
        "A: I would \u2014 it could very well be the case. It could very well be the case, and then\nafterwards the same day, we took our baggage and we walked back to the apartment,\nand the house was still standing and we saw the German occupiers on the street and\nthey left us alone. We left them alone. I remember staring at them, and then we went\nback to the apartment.",
        "A: Yes, but in the meantime we had also heard that a number of Jews were shot by\nLatvians because the Latvians were also vitriolicly anti-Communist, and in some of\nthe German propaganda that leaked through, I guess, the Germans equated\nBolshevism with Judaism so on and so forth. So, apparently, some people were shot\neven before, just before the German occupation took place in Libau.",
        "A: Almost immediately.",
        "A: Almost immediately. I remember my father having to go to a gathering place every\nmorning to be assigned for work. My father wore his red cross arm band. My brother\ngoing to work. A cousin of mine was shot dead by the Germans apparently, he had\njust married a Latvian girl before. She was pregnant, but I was lead to understand that\nShe also had a lover, and I was lead to understand that she denounced him as a Jew\nand he was shot and my father was called on to go to the cemetery to identify the\nbody, and he came back to the house and I was there, pale saying, \u201cYes it was\nwho was shot dead.\u201d He identified the body, and that was about a week to ten days\nafter the occupation, and it was not long thereafter when my father was arrested,\ntortured and killed, yes. So, we immediately began to feel it, almost immediately,\nwithin days I would say, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Then, I no longer thought in terms of me and the IJ, et cetera. I\nbegan thinking in terms of the larger picture that is our fate, no longer my school. I\nmean, this became irrelevant. It was not even a footnote in my life. Now, the issue\nbecame life and death.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. Nine and a half at the time now.",
        "A: Oh, that-",
        "A: That was finished. That was finished, yes.",
        "A: Now?",
        "A: At the point, I don\u2019t remember having trouble sleeping. I slept. I lead an active life in\nso far as I kept up with the news, the latest news, what\u2019s happening all the gossip, the\ndangers, by the time the evening came around, I assume I was exhausted. I was still a\nkid. So, I seemed to sleep very well. My mother was assigned to go to work, and\nsometimes she was able to take me with her. This was she was kind of a seamstress,\nironing. I remember her doing working in, I guess it must have been a laundry. If I\nthink of it today, for the German Air Force in Libau. She was, and then at a certain\npoint, she became the housekeeper, maid for the mistress, for the Latvian mistress for\nthe head of the in Libau, and my mother knew her from before the war because\nthey used to meet at the same hairdressers called Mary\u2019s. I still remember. This\nmistress apparently had a liking, took a liking to my mother, and sent a long to the\nghetto, but this was already in the ghetto period. But, before the ghetto period already,\nextra food and when she knew that things were going to happen to Jews, she would\ntell my mother, \u201cYou better bring George with you to the apartment.\u201d So, I would\nstay for the day at the apartment safe when my mother was cleaning or whatever, yes.\nBut, things became in a sense chaotic, but there was within this chaos, there was still\norder.",
        "A: She said to me circumstances dictate what you have to do. She took it very stoically.\nShe took it very \u2014 but, she \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen my mother in tears before. I\u2019ve never\nseen my mother in a state of hysteria. When my father was arrested, she ran all over\nthe place to her Latvian colleagues who did not raise a finger for my late father. Some\nof the Latvian doctors, I guess you know jealousy, professional jealousy whatever,\nbut nothing unusual. They didn\u2019t raise a finger even though it was an issue of life and\ndeath. She went to the pleading for my father. She left no stone unturned, and\nat a certain point was told by the man who really killed my father that he\u2019ll be\nreleased but a wound has to heal, that guy apparently knocked out one of his eyes,\nand was told that they really needed him because of his specialty, but the wound\nnever healed. So, they didn\u2019t want to release him in that condition. So, they decided\nto shoot him instead.",
        "A: That I heard later, but a patient, a Latvian patient of my father\u2019s came with the news\nthat his eye was knocked out. He heard it from I guess a Latvian guard in the prison\nor whatever, and I\u2019ve also heard it from his fellow prison inmates, Jews who were\nlater on liberated or I saw later, what happened to my father because they were\neyewitnesses.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t come home. It was toward the end of July 1941, yeah.",
        "A: He was not working 1n the hospital at that time, no.",
        "A: Yes, but as a doctor, as a doctor he was doing this. This was the end of July, and then\nhe was shot.",
        "A: Horrified, absolutely horrified, and you didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t understand. I didn\u2019t\nunderstand why we had to suffer simply because being Jewish. I hardly knew what it\nmeant before the war. As I said, I knew I was a Jew. I knew about Matza, Passover,\nabout certain High Holidays, or when my mother and father fasted, or turning on\ncandles commemorating the dead, et cetera, but otherwise I really did not know much\nabout the significance.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: What the logic was I\u2019m suffering because I\u2019m a Jew, but I didn\u2019t understand why I\nhad to suffer because I\u2019m a Jew.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t analyze it. I did not, but I remember later on thinking \u2014 initially, I did not\nwant to die, but later on after Stalingrad, et cetera, I did not mind. I thought myself\nbecause I know that the Germans are going to be defeated.",
        "A: Yeah, I did no longer mind it.",
        "A: To see Germany destroyed, that was it.",
        "A: Yeah. Because I remember in the severe winter, well \u2014 I remember in maybe it\u2019s later\nit\u2019s been cut now.",
        "A: I remember it was a very severe winter, 1941-42, where I got frostbite in Libau,\nfrostbite on my toes and my fingers, thinking perhaps if the Germans would win the\nwar, there would no longer be a reason to punish Jews for whatever reason, and\nthings would get better. So, for a moment, I even thought, however perverse it may\nsound today, but as a child, perhaps the Germans should win and then we will be\nrelieved of this misery, of this uncertainty.",
        "A: Confusion reigns, but death was there.\nEnd of Tape 4\nTape 5",
        "A: Yes, he went to work to the gathering place in Libau where the Jews were gathered\nand then the Germans would transport them to their outfits, and he saw the\ntrucks approaching, and he began to make signs to the people on the square, in other\nwords, to disperse, and this was noticed by the SS people, and they beat him up\nterribly and threw him onto one of the trucks, and he among others were taken to the\nprison. That\u2019s where he continued to be tortured. That\u2019s where apparently his eye was\nknocked out, and apparently he was going around looking for his eye, et cetera, and\ncouldn\u2019t find it, and begged \u2014 this is from eye witnesses that we have \u2014 begged to be\nshot, but they kept him alive.",
        "A: She \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen her before crying or being hysterical.",
        "A: She was absolutely hysterical when it happened. She would say our our dad, our\ndaddy, how are we going on from here? We must do everything possible to rescue\nhim, and she started running around and we still had some hidden diamonds and gold\ncoins so on and so forth, and she bribed some of the Latvian colleagues especially one\nwho used to be a neighbor of ours, Dr. , aneighbor of ours when we lived in\nthe \u2014 before the Russians came in, in the same. There were two apartments to the\nsame floor and he lived in one of them. And, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d She\nwent to some other Latvian colleagues. They said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s really nothing we\ncan do or help or say.\u201d She then went to the , but I don\u2019t think she did give\nanything to the people in terms of gold coins or diamonds, et cetera. It would\u2019ve\nbeen much too dangerous, and there was this one person who apparently knocked out\nmy father\u2019s eye, Handtke who was tried after World War II in Hamburg where\napparently I have the transcripts where this whole issue was brought up. He defended\nhimself. I don\u2019t remember the details from the transcripts, and he finally said to my\nmother after several days, \u201cYes, we\u2019re going to release your husband once the\nwound\u201d some sort of wound \u201che has will be healed, but the wound never healed so\nthey decided to shoot him instead.\u201d",
        "A: The first news as I remember, came from a former Latvian patient of my father\u2019s who\ncame to visit us with the news that he had heard, and then also some of the people\nwho were arrested together with him, some of them were released who saw it, and\nothers were also shot relatively speaking at the same time.",
        "A: She relied heavily on my older brother who had leadership qualities which she did not\nreally, nor of course I, as a child. So, she relied very much on my brother, and\ntogether with whatever help I could give, we manipulated the situation to the best of\nour knowledge.",
        "A: He was about nineteen.",
        "A: Nineteen, yes.",
        "A: In \u00b041, she was born in 1903. Thirty, 23, 33, 43 \u2014 38.",
        "A: Thirty-eight.",
        "A: Yeah, and she was obviously spoiled from her old home, and my father spoiled her\nvery much. So, she was not very street smart or anything of the sort, but it 1s\nsometimes the circumstances that forge an individual, yes.",
        "A: Yes, was forced to go-",
        "A: To go to work, and then after working for a while with the Air Force in Libau, -\nLibau, that\u2019s where the was, the war port, where I occasionally went along.\nThen, she was taken by the former mistress \u2014 by the mistress, the then mistress of the\nhead of the Gestapo, this Latvian woman, her name was Mrs. Krohnberg and I was\nled to understand that after the war, she managed to get to Canada and she died in\nCanada about ten, fifteen years ago or so.",
        "A: Krohnberg, in Latvian I guess it would, the husband would be the Krohnbergs in\nLatvian it would be Krohnberga, for the woman.",
        "A: This was before the ghetto, yes.",
        "A: In Libau. Yes.",
        "A: No, in the meantime, several times we had to move. We moved in to one apartment\nnear my school for a short time. Let me get the sequence straight. Oh, my \u2014 we\nmoved into the servant quarters of the Kessel Villa, K-e-s-s-e-l, because my brother\nmarried the daughter, but this was already a war marriage, had no legal validity to the\nbest of my knowledge. So, the front part was occupied, the main part of the villa was\noccupied by Mrs. Stein who was Latvian. Her husband was Jewish. So, she lived\nthere with a daughter, and Mr. Stein, the Kessel\u2019s \u2014 the husband was already killed,\nMrs. Kessel and her two daughters, and my brother and I and my mother, we lived\nbehind the building what used to be known as the servant\u2019s quarters. We lived there\nfor a while until we had to move from there and moved to another quarter which was\nnear my school where we were in three rooms \u2014 one, two, three. We were one \u2014 my\nbrother and his newly acquired wife, myself \u2014 we lived, slept in one room. My mother\nslept in another room, another woman \u2014 Mrs. Boop slept in a room that was in Mrs.\nBoop\u2019s apartment. Yes, she was killed during the war, and two young women slept in\nanother room. So we were about six or seven people in this small apartment of about\nfour or five rooms, excluding the kitchen. And, from there, well an announcement\ncame that we will be moved to a ghetto \u2014 we\u2019ll have to move to a ghetto which is in a\npart of Libau, a section of Libau that I did not know very well, and there in the ghetto\nthis was in the summer of \u201943, we were assigned to a flat in a basement that had a\nkind of an outhouse, the toilet was a few steps \u2014 we had to go about five or six steps,\nright off the entrance, rear entrance of the building, and there including the kitchen\nthere were one, two, three rooms. So, two rooms and where people could sleep. In\nthese two rooms, my brother and his wife, and my mother and I slept, in this\nbasement apartment, and in the other room there were about four people who slept,\nand we shared the same toilet. We shared the bathroom, the bathing facilities, and we\nmade the best of this situation. I was working for a while in the ghetto in the garden,\nvegetable garden, and then I was \u201casked, invited\u201d to become the commandant\u2019s\nrunner in the Libau ghetto. The commandant was not a bad person actually, Kerscher.\nHe closed his eyes to many things especially when people brought 1n some extra food\nto the ghetto. He did not make a big deal out of it, but of course, we also managed to\ngive him things that is not only the Schwabs but other people with means before the\nwar who had saved a gold coin here, a diamond there, a fur coat, whatever, gave it to\nhim, and this reminds me even before we moved into the ghetto, there were\ncollections of gold coins. This in order to try to release Jews from the prison to bribe\nthe Germans, et cetera. So, this was \u2014 I remember people coming around for specific\narrests that were made and collecting, because we were told if we gathered this and\nthis and this and this, we would be able to get that person out of prison and so on and\nso forth. But, this brings me back to before the ghetto, way before the ghetto.\nImmediately after the revolution in 1917, Lenin needed hard currency, and opened up\nthe palaces. You could buy everything and anything for very little money. And, we\nhad antique \u2014 an antique for example living room that came from one of the Czarist\npalaces. We had a chandelier a cobalt with gold chandelier that came from one of the\npalaces that my grandparents bought and some of it gave to my father as a gift after\nWorld War I, immediately, and some that my father bought including some art works\nfrom famous Russian artists that he bought when he was serving in Russia, and right\nafter the revolution that he bought and brought it back to Latvia. So, in addition to the\nPersian carpets and the Grand piano, et cetera, this was very exclusive furniture that\nwe had from Czarist palaces including a number of chandeliers. I remember two in\nparticular, and all this was taken by the Germans before we came even to the ghetto.\nAnd, not only the German , but also the German Navy. There was a certain\nInspector Ulmann of the German Navy. Incidentally, the old \u2014 where we lived before\nWorld War I, the building that became the headquarters of the Communist Party\nduring World War II became the headquarters of the German Navy for the region,\nand this Inspector Ulmann came very often to our apartment, and with a crew would\ntake a lot of the things from the apartment, and then of course, we also had people\nfrom the \u2014__s coming with their crews to take, and there was one guy fromthe\nby the name of Strott, S-t-r-o-t-t, who was a collector of stamps, and my late brother\nhad a huge stamp collection and he traded stamps with all over the world. There was\nactually an exhibition here in Philadelphia in memoriam for my brother, a big stamp\ncollection, where it is all described and I have a photograph with my late mother, still.\nShe was already sick and we went to Philadelphia. This must have be in 1963, when\nthere was this big exhibition in Philadelphia. And, he took, and I\u2019m sure he took it for\nhimself because he was an art collector, and then we had to two Leica cameras, one\nGerman and one Russian Leica, I remember, and we gave one of them to one of the\nLatvians who came to the house to look for things. I think, and I would have to\nestablish this, I\u2019m not sure, but one of the Latvians was a notorious murderer by the\nname of Cukurs. He had several fingers missing. I don\u2019t know how come, but I\nremember fingers were missing, and for some reason I associate him with the name\nCukurs who was a deputy to Arias, the famous Arias, commander of Latvians who\nkilled Jews with a vengeance. And, this man with the fingers came and looked for\nthings, and I remember very distinctly my mother giving him one of the Leicas\nbecause we had two still hidden in the apartment. This is when we were still living in\nthe apartment to which we moved during the Russian period.",
        "A: Yes, the smaller apartment. So, these are some of the things that suddenly come back\nabout the furniture so on and so forth. Now, how did we get up to this question?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, we never saw him again.",
        "A: Nothing, never saw him, no, no.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t mourn in the sense in those days you would wear black for a whole\nyear, et cetera. This you couldn\u2019t do. There was no way of doing it. You had to go in\nthe morning to work whatever, and then they would come back and in the evening\nhoping to find me still there, alive, et cetera. So-",
        "A: Shiva or so on, no.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember \u2014 we didn\u2019t even know exactly the date, but this was irrelevant,\nbut I don\u2019t remember a Shiva.",
        "A: I understood. I missed him very much, but I didn\u2019t understand what it meant that he\nwas shot, but then I had some sort of an inkling because when he came home from the\ncemetery where he identified my cousin that the person was suddenly dead, and my\nfather was arrested. What I couldn\u2019t understand 1s that I\u2019Il never see him again. This I\ndo remember, that I may never see him again. This I do remember very, very\ndistinctly, yeah.",
        "A: Yes the bekantmachung",
        "A: The bekantmachung means a kind of an announcement.",
        "A: It was a public announcement.",
        "A: Yes, yes, by that and that date we had to move in, and then we were assigned the\nliving quarters.",
        "A: Oh, yes, not only this, but I was at a certain point coming to this, even going back\nbefore the ghetto when we had to wear the yellow star and had to deliver our radios\nand other things right after the occupation, and we were not permitted to go on the\nsidewalks as Jews. We could only go right off the sidewalk, and I remember it was in\nthe winter, going and a fellow student, a girl, came in my direction. We were in the\nsame class, and we walked and I wanted to say hello to her, and it happened to be a\ngirl I fancied as a child. Veltina was her name. She sort of looked away, and I felt\nembarrassed that I was a Jew, that I had to wear this and I could not go on the\nsidewalk. It was something strange. Why should I feel embarrassed? But, I remember\nfeeling embarrassed that I am who I am. It\u2019s a very strange sensation that I had, just\nas strange as the same winter when I thought maybe a German victory would be\nhelpful to us. Let the Germans win. Logical, perhaps for a child, but for an adult,\nobviously not.",
        "A: Not in this context, in a different context. The children in the ghetto didn\u2019t like to play\nwith me because I didn\u2019t speak Yiddish. I spoke German, and they used to call me\nkind of a yeke. I did not speak it, and I remember going to my mother crying saying,\n\u201cThe children don\u2019t want to play with me because I don\u2019t speak Yiddish\u2019, and I\nremember my mother saying to me, \u201cGeorge, there\u2019s really nothing I can do about it.\nI don\u2019t speak Yiddish either. We have to make the best of the situation.\u201d And, it 1s in\nthis context that I began to acquire Yiddish because this became the lingual the\naccepted language in camp, et cetera.",
        "A: So, just like I acquired Russian, I acquired a smattering of Yiddish.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t send out most of the Bourgeois. They sent out a good number, but I\nassume, but in those days I didn\u2019t think in terms of classes, et cetera. I didn\u2019t think in\nterms \u2014 I didn\u2019t think in these terms, but in retrospect, I would say that they came\nfrom a milieu from which I did not come, period. I mean, that\u2019s how I would put it\nnow.",
        "A: No, I felt \u2014 I felt bad that they would not accept me and at the same time, I was\nenvious because they were stronger than I was. They were better athletes than I was.\nIn many ways, they were far superior to me. So, I was envious actually, and they\nspoke Yiddish which I did not. So, I was envious too. But, as a child, you can acquire\nlanguage very easily. So-",
        "A: I guess I still probably have a vocabulary of about 150 or 200 words. So, I could get\nby. In other words, with my limited vocabulary, I could get by, and but also\ninteresting because the Yiddish we speak in the Baltic countries is different from the\nPolish Yiddish. For example, I\u2019m now the Vice President of the Sholom Aleichem\nFoundation even though my Yiddish is almost non-existent as is Belle Kaufman\u2019s\nYiddish almost non-existent, the granddaughter of Sholom Aleichem, who 1s still\nalive at 93 and is our Chairman. When we have the annual meetings of the Sholom\nAleichem meetings in New York commemorating his death because it\u2019s according to\nhis will, when some of the Yiddish actors read his writings in the Polish Yiddish\nespecially in the . Yiddish, I don\u2019t understand 95 percent. If somebody reads it\nwith a Baltic accent, not an accent, but pronunciation, I understand fifty percent\nbecause the Yiddish is more akin to the German. To give you just one example, when\nyou say \u2014 in German you say , 1n the Baltic Yiddish it would be _, and in the\nYiddish it would be ,",
        "A: Quite different. So, I just I have difficulties with this, yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. This was not a problem for her. It was a problem\nfor-",
        "A: For me, yes.\nTape 6",
        "A: Yes, there was money in the family before, but he also did very well, and I remember\nmy mother telling me that he would come home and take out from his pockets lots of\nmoney saying, \u201cYou have brought me a lot of luck, Clairehen, Claire. Look how well\nI\u2019m doing in my practice.\u201d So, independently of his parents, but my grandfather was a\nbig merchant in the grains \u2014 import and export \u2014 and, we had at least one warehouse\nthat I was aware of with elevators in front of it, railroad tracks, right at the pier,\nbecause he exported a lot to England and elsewhere, but one of my relatives told me\nthat we had another warehouse on the other side of the pier exactly facing it. This I\ndon\u2019t know. Maybe they sold it very early on, but I only knew of the other one\nbecause it was not sold until the late \u201830s, the other one. So, maybe the first one they\ndidn\u2019t bother talking about. But, I did not know until I heard about it over here that\nthere was a second one. Also, to give you a little background, what I found out over\nhere is that when the governor of St. Petersburg came to Libau, he would always\ncome to Libau and play bridge with my grandfather, and they were very good friends,\nbut I would think that the big money came from my grandfather. But, my father did\nvery well in his practice, in his practice, yes.",
        "A: Not as well-off as my father\u2019s family, but in the six sisters, three brothers, they all\nwent to universities, the three brothers. The six sisters all went to gymnasium, and\nthere you had to pay in those days and music conservatory. My grandfather owned an\nupscale delicatessen store, and my mother tells me he brought home the most\ndelicious things everyday from the delicatessen something like in Paris, and my\ngrandmother, the big money apparently came from my grandmother who came from\nthe Russian city of and her maiden name was . She came from a very,\nvery well-to-do family, and each daughter, and there was a large family, each\ndaughter received a house or a villa as a dowry.",
        "A: Yeah, so, and she had six sisters and three brothers and all were educated this and that\nso, you had to have some means in order to do this.",
        "A: And, in my father\u2019s family, the mother of my cousin over here studied at the\nUniversity of Geneva in those days before World War I, and Grenoble in France.",
        "A: My German was good.",
        "A: Yes, it was my native tongue, maybe I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s an interpretation. Maybe this\nwas one reason why I was \u201cinvited\u201d to become his runner. A second reason perhaps,\nit\u2019s my interpretation again is because I came from a certain background. I don\u2019t\nknow if this played a role, but in addition to being a runner for him - when I would\nhave to, when I would get a pass that nothing should happen to me while I brng a\nwatch which was repaired in the ghetto to, let\u2019s say to or to SS who\nwas the head of the SS in Libau or to Inspector of the . So, and I could\ncommunicate with the staff over there whatever it is in German. Perhaps this 1s a\nreason, but again, as I said before, it\u2019s pure speculation and I do not know the facts.",
        "A: And, also keeping count of the inmates. When we moved into the ghetto, we had\nsomething like 823 people survived out of community of close to 8,000. And, when \u2014\nin the morning when they left, they were given a tag, a metal tag so I had to give them\nthe metal tags as they went out to work in columns, and in the late afternoon, I had to\ncollect these tags and hang them up. So, I remember the numbers, and you could see\nimmediately if somebody escaped or what. The number, you associated that with a\nname, and that is how you kept tabs.",
        "A: No, everyone had his number or her number.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: You didn\u2019t think along those lines. You thought about how to survive in this milieu.\nAt times, we had basketball games arranged. There was a school for children which I\nattended on occasion. It didn\u2019t last very long because we were not very long in the\nghetto. But, by and large, there wasn\u2019t much time for self-reflection. At least, I do\nnot recollect. I do recollect being concerned on how to survive, and under the\ncircumstances, we were still lucky because I had my mother and I had my brother.\nWe lost our father, but there were others who had lost more than just a brother and a\nfather, et cetera. So, in the circumstances, I \u2014 I still felt \u201cgood that I had my brother\nand my mother\u2019.",
        "A: Working, yes, my mother was working for the ;",
        "A: Yes, and my \u2014 well, she was already working for the way back in 41.",
        "A: But, for a short time between let\u2019s say August and September and October when she\nwas working for the Air Force because when the big action came, she was already\nworking and December was a very big action, she was already working for the\nmistress because she had the letter from the that we can not be touched. 1S\nwhat we called...",
        "A: Yeah, \u201941, that was December yeah, were thousands were rounded up and killed in",
        "A: Well, when we moved into the ghetto in \u201943 there were about 820, yes. I remember\nbecause I was in charge of the big board with the tags. So, I knew how many Jews\ncame into the ghetto and how many-",
        "A: Yeah, and who stayed in the ghetto because those who stayed in the ghetto I did not\ngive a tag in the morning. So, you could see the people for illness or whatever.",
        "A: From the summer of \u201943 until \u2014 wait a second \u2014 no, \u201942, summer of \u201942 to October\n\"43 because Yom Kippur was very late that year, and we were shipped to Riga the\nnight of Yom Kippur and there was a song composed by one of the inmates \u201cYom\nKippur Bai Nicht, Als Men Sogt Den Malchet, Gebracht Uns Aher In Kazet\u201d",
        "A: Yom Kippur Bai Nicht \u2014 in the eve of Yom Kipper, when one says the Malchet, the\nprayer, Gebracht Uns Aher \u2014 we were brought to Kaiserwald. It\u2019s a very loose\ntranslation from Yiddish.",
        "A: I must say that with very few exceptions, they were very civil, very polite, but this\nwas our general upbringing in Libau. Later on, I met types I never met before, but in\nLibau, I had not met types, such types before. So, among ourselves, we were very\npolite. We were very well behaved to the best of our ability, and this goes also for the\n\u201cless fortunate\u201d people because I think that even the less fortunate people before the\nwar, there was a common level of behavior that embraced the, I would say, what I\nknew of the Jewish community, but as I proven wrong about saying that there were\nno poor Jews in Latvia, maybe I just didn\u2019t was not in touch with other elements. But,\nafter the war and during the war when I spent with many of them from many other\nlevels, I would say that there was very civilized and \u2014 under the worse circumstances-\ncivilized and cultured approach to things, to human beings, to fellow human beings,\net cetera. You rarely heard of a Libau Jew stealing something from another Libau\nJew, rarely. There were exceptions, and they were caught ant they were punished.\nThis even went on later when we were in the concentration camp. Among ourselves\nwe were very civil, and it didn\u2019t matter whether \u2014 from which class you came. At\nleast, I had not encountered this, and I\u2019m speaking now - strictly speaking from my\nperspective.",
        "A: Yes, Mr. Israelit and Mr. Kaganski who was an attorney. I told you the woman in\nCalifornia who should be interviewed, his wife. Yes, I knew them. Mr. Israelit, he\nwas a banker before World War II. He spoke broken German, but was a very nice\nman. I knew his daughter. She was a classmate of my brother\u2019s in the Jewish\ngymnasium. I knew other members of the family, very dignified family. He was the\nnumber one person, and the number two person was this Mr. Kaganski, highly\neducated, very cultured, spoke a very, very good German, very handsome man. We\nhad no problems with our leadership, and I hadn\u2019t heard major complaints about them\nfrom any of the ghetto inmates.",
        "A: There was a kind of a Jewish police, but of course they didn\u2019t have weapons or\nanything of the sort, and it was, I believe, this Jewish police had caught two thieves\nstealing things from the store in the ghetto, some bread or so, and they were\nincarcerated, and I just don\u2019t remember know what their fate was. I believe they were\nshot for what they had done. But, this was such a rare exception. It was an exception\nthat this should happen among us Libau Jews. This was sort of almost unheard of.",
        "A: Yes, we heard vague stories, but we did not know details, but what we did know,\nthere were technicians among the former Libau Jews who were technicians already\nthen, and they managed some way or other to construct a radio. So, we knew what\nwas going on in the world. We heard about the German defeats at the front, which\nwas wonderful news to us and gave us inspiration, and when we didn\u2019t hear good\nnews or anything, we used to talk about the one says rumors. Rumors about\nhis, et cetera. What are your source? agency says it\u2019s a\nrumor, but it was known as ,",
        "A: Not soon, but that they were going to lose. This was a foregone conclusion after\nespecially Stalingrad, after January 42, and then of course, we heard about the\nfamous Battle of Kursk a tank battle which was later where the Germans were\ndecisively defeated. And, of course in Stalingrad where the German Field Marshal\ngave up, surrendered with something like 90,000 troops. This was vitamins to us,\nreally. I mean we couldn\u2019t have been happier. And, then we also heard about some\nBritish general that was Montgomery chasing the Germans all over Africa until they\nwere thrown out of Africa. This, of course, was very good news, and that the\nGermans were having \u2014 were being beaten not only in the Stalingrad front, but in\nmany parts of the Soviet Union.",
        "A: Yeah, but I was born late.",
        "A: Yes, so eleven and a half or so, something to that effect.",
        "A: Well.",
        "A: I\u2019m still a kid. The fact that I didn\u2019t have to study was- (laughs)",
        "A: This was a great boom. What did I feel? The essential thing in \u201942-\u201943 when we were\nin the ghetto. It was a, relatively speaking, stable period. We came in 800 some odd\npeople, and we were taken to the concentration camp, roughly the same number. So,\nthere were few killings between the period between the time we got into the ghetto\nand went to Riga Kaiserwald to the concentration camp, but it was still the fear\neveryday.",
        "A: You don\u2019t know what to expect, and you always had to be on the lookout, and\nincidentally, something very interesting. Across the street from one of the streets in\nthe ghetto, you had buildings where there were lots and lots of Russian POWs, and\nthey were begging for bread. They had it much worse than we, and we were able to\nthrow them some bread because in the ghetto we still did not really starve.",
        "A: Yes, we really did not, at least, I don\u2019t think we starved, no because from with our\nLatvian people, we could deal for this. We could get that, and we still had a diamond\nhere, a dollar there, so on and so forth. We could still do business, so to speak. We\ncould still bring in. So, I do not really remember starving. That we had our pre-World\nWar food obviously is not the case or even the food that we had during the Russian\nperiod, but we had enough bread. We had some butter. We had sometimes a piece of\nsalami. We had even sometimes I got hot chocolate. So, I don\u2019t remember starving in\nthe ghetto, let\u2019s put it this way.",
        "A: Yes, and how we threw bread over the fence. Yes, I do this. I do remember this very\ndistinctly, yes. They were much, much worse off than we were at this particular\nmoment.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t think in these terms that ve lost my childhood. At that age, I don\u2019t think that\nyou think along these lines, but what is interesting, I think, and I often think about it,\nhow I survived because later on I had to witness hangings so on and so forth because\nI\u2019ve never really seen anybody hang, but this goes to late \u201944 early \u00b045 in Stolp\n. To me, this was a kind of theater. I was observing. I was living. If I were\nto put in today\u2019s terms, I was \u2014 I was an actor in a theater. I was living something\nwhich was not real, and yet it was very real. I was an actor, and at the same time, I\nfelt that I was a spectator, and whatever was going on was interesting to me for better\nor for worse. It was something of an experience \u2014 warped in today\u2019s terms, I would\nsay yes, but again from a child who is ten, eleven, twelve, et cetera, it\u2019s a different\nbecause \u2014 but, this was really my personality before the war. Everything seemed to\ninterest me except school.",

        "A: What a ten year old child-",
        "A: It is difficult, but to me it was a big spectacle that in a strange, I would say today, in a\nwarped way was interesting to observe, and at the same time, I was part of the action\nthat is part of the theater, watching out, when will I be next to be shot?",
        "A: Yeah, because everyone thought so, \u201cwhat will the next day bring?\u201d \u201cWhat will the\nnext minute bring?\u201d yes.",

        "A: What?",
        "A: When it was safer, yes. I don\u2019t remember having nightmares in the Libau ghetto, no",
        "A: Some people escaped from the ghetto, and were hidden by Latvians who we call now\nthe Righteous Gentiles, and most of them survived the war.",
        "A: Yes. Most of the others were sent to the Riga concentration camp, Yom Kippur at\nnight, 1943, and we were taken to the cargo terminal and in cattle cars we were\nshoved in and interestingly, we were told we were going to Riga. And, Riga just rang\na bell, something clicked. I loved Riga before the war. The the commotion in\nRiga, it was a big city for me in contrast to Libau which was sort of a sleepy, smaller\ncity of some 70,000 inhabitants. Riga at that time had close to half a million people. It\nwas the city of my dreams as a child. So, I imagined Riga when I was being\ntransported, I was thinking of the Riga beaches, the summers we spent there. I was\nthinking of my aunt\u2019s apartment, the parties. I was thinking of the cafes, of the Riga\nZoo, wonderful, wonderful memories. And, then we were told we were coming to\nKaiserwald. Kaiserwald was the most exclusive suburb in Riga at this time.\nKaiserwald means the Forest of the Kaiser. And, one of my aunts and my granddad\nhad a beautiful villa there, Kaiserwald, gorgeous. So, I thought, \u201cKaiserwald, well,\nwho knows?\u201d et cetera. In a sense, I mean, obviously here we were in a cattle car, and\nat the same time I was daydreaming about the beautiful life that I lived in Riga.\n(laughs)",
        "A: Which is very strange, but I remember this very, very distinctly, and looking forward\nto going to Riga.\nEnd of Tape 6\nTape 7",
        "A: We were told that we could take with us what we could carry. So, I still \u2014 we still had\nour pre-war clothes. We were dressed warmly.",
        "A: October, it was beginning to get cold, yes. So, we were always prepared. I remember\nmother saying it\u2019s better warmer because we could always take off. So, we were very\nwarmly dressed. We each had a suitcase and some other things so on and so forth. So,\nwe were transported, and I remember we arrived in Riga. It was still dark, probably\nvery early in the morning next day. Suddenly, the doors were slid open. SS men\nbeginning to scream and also some of the non-Jewish prisoners in very strange garb,\nnamely in concentration camp garb screaming, \u201cOut, out with you dirty Jews, out!\u201d\nAnd, beating us, beating us like crazy, and then we had to run from \u2014 which wasn\u2019t\nvery far, maybe fifty or sixty yards \u2014 to the camp from the railroad track. And, there\nwe were told to throw all the luggage and to take off the coat, and throw it on a pile,\nand my mother didn\u2019t want to do it, and I remember saying to my mother, \u201cBut,\nmother we\u2019re told that we\u2019re going to get it back. So, let\u2019s put it there.\u201d What do you\nexpect of an eleven year old kid? That\u2019s what we were told, and I believed. So,\nreluctantly, my mother and my brother also took off the coat, and inside of course,\nwere diamonds and some gold coins whatever. And, needless to say, we never saw\nthe coats again. Then we were chased into a barrack, and next day, we were\n\u2018\u201cdeloused\u201d but we didn\u2019t have any lice in Libau, and we went through a shower, and\ncoming out of the shower, we no longer had our old clothes. We were given new\nclothes that didn\u2019t fit me. I got a coat that came down to here. I received some\nwooden shoes. What do they call them?",
        "A: Clogs.",
        "A: Clogs, some sort of a shirt, et cetera - not as yet concentration camp garb. And,\neverything was quick, quick, and you had these especially some Polish and also very\nnotorious German criminal , some of the Polish criminals, , beating us\ntogether with the Germans beating us to run here and there, and then we were directed\nto a certain barrack where we\u2019re going to sleep now. I\u2019d never seen before bunk beds\nwith straw mattresses and straw pillow, and at night I remember, the straw would\ncome out and it was very \u2014 there were no sheets or anything of the sort, a kind of a\nblanket even in the winter. It was very cold which as an ordeal especially for me who\n\u2014 for everyone who had not experienced anything of the sort because until then, let\u2019s\nput it this way, in comparison to the Libau ghetto, Riga was \u2014 Riga Kaiserwald was\nhell, and the Libau ghetto was, in comparison, paradise. The beatings, the screamings,\nAppel, for the first time I heard the word Appel, the count, in the morning, and to\nmake sure that I look older, et cetera, at the count, I always scratched together the\nsand and stood on my toes to be taller than usual. So, and I was a little bit taller than\nthe rest of the kids in my age group. That was probably one of the reasons why I was\nnot immediately selected for being shot. My brother after a few days was taken to a\nkaisernierung, to a camp outside the camp where he worked in their reichsbarn which\nhad happened to be a very good kaisernierung. The people were treated relatively\nwell. My mother was assigned to a job in the concentration camp, in the tanklager,\nand sometimes she managed to convince, I don\u2019t know how that I go with her to the\ntanklager, not to remain in camp because if you remain in camp you never know what\ncan happen. There were safer days. There were less safer days. It was a very, very\nsevere winter, the winter of \u201943 again in \u201944, and we were working on this tanklager\nagain, in constructing railroad trucks, and there were a lot of the-",
        "A: Yes, railroad tracks, sorry, tracks because it was \u2014 you had a lot of gasoline storage et\ncetera, and trains came in where you loaded the gasoline, et cetera, for the Air Force,\nfor the Navy et cetera, and so it was a storage, a dump, and also part of the tanklager\nwas also a repair shop for German cars or whatever, but I was working a lot outside\nbuilding and repairing of the tracks, railroad tracks.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s still in Kaiserwald. I did not join my brother until probably it was, must\nhave been November or so.",
        "A: Well.",
        "A: A month or two months later, or maybe even three months later.",
        "A: I was together with my brother for the first three days until he was taken to this\nkaisernierung and I was alone. My mother was on the woman\u2019s side, and there was a\nfence between the woman\u2019s camp, but I could see my mother almost anytime \u2014 in the\nmorning before work or when she would come back because you could see the\nwomen\u2019s camp. It was just \u2014 the distance was like from here to the camera. So, it\u2019s\njust a few feet.",
        "A: Oh, across the fence.",
        "A: That was okay. In the mornings, I remember I was starved all ready, but I didn\u2019t\nsuffer all that much from hunger, but I remember I would say to my mother,\n\u2018\u201cMomika, I\u2019m so hungry.\u201d So, she would give me her portion. I said, \u201cBut, did you\neat?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I am full.\u201d She would say, but she was not, but she threw me her\nportion because in the mornings we would receive moldy bread, some sugar, some\nkind of a marmalade, and this was very bad because \u2014 this was bad because we all got\ndiarrhea from it, and a kind of a coffee that didn\u2019t taste like coffee at least to me as a\nchild. It was terrible, but it wasn\u2019t enough for me. So, I asked my mother, and she\nvery often was able to throw me her portion, and I ate, and I remember at that time,\nthere was a Mr. Kaufman who was a friend from before the war. And, I went to him\nand I said to him in German, \u201cMr. Kaufman, do you happen to have a slice of bread?\nI\u2019m very, very hungry.\u201d He said to me, \u201cGeorge, I wish I had I could give you, but I\ndon\u2019t.\u201d And, Pll never forget this. He died in New York. He was the first chairman of\nthe Jewish Survivors of Latvia, and he always remembered this, and I remember this\nparticular incident as well. But, it was done still. It was still Herr Kaufman, Mr.\nKaufman that I addressed him. It was not Max or sort of the way we\u2019re accustomed to\nhere. Yes, and then, interestingly enough in this Tanklager, which was a tough place,\nthere was a German guard by the name of Hoffmann, the beast par excellence, beat\nthe Jews like anything. He came I think from Romania or some place from that area,\nbut he liked my mother, and would always address her as Frau Dr. Schwab, and when\nhe was patrolling, he would say, \u201cYou can go into this shack\u201d where there was a stove\nand what we confiscated. We used to call it organizier, we organized something. We\nstole something \u2014 potatoes so we could slice and put it against the oven and roast\npotatoes. That became a delicacy. So, and he permitted me to go with my mother. So,\nwe could go in. We could warm-up, et cetera. We would have our potato so on and so\nforth. One day, we were marching toward the Tanklager again in the winter, and my\nmother told me she had a terrible case of diarrhea and she doesn\u2019t know what to do.\nin German. She went over to him and said, \u201cI really have to step out.\u201d He said,\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d He slowed down the column, permitted my mother to attend to what she\nhad, and then she rejoined the column. Why did he do it? I don\u2019t know. My mother\nwas gold blonde, very fair skinned, bluish-grey eyes, looked like a thousand Aryans.\nActually, she was told and that was still going back now in Libau, if she wanted to be\nsaved to be taken to Germany, she could be saved. She said, \u201cI\u2019Il be delighted if I can\nbring my sons with me.\u201d They said, \u201cNo, you can not.\u201d Then, she said, \u201cThen I stay\nwith my sons.\u201d And, that was still in Libau, because they distinguished sometimes the\ngenotype from the phenotype, genetically Jewish versus the appearance, and if your\nappearance was \u201cAryan\u201d especially Nordic, which my mother was, then you could\nmanipulate, but she was actually asked.",
        "A: Yeah, and there are other incidents like this after the war, immediately where people\nin Berlin did not think that she was Jewish because the way she looked when she\ncame to look for me, but maybe when we go into this, we can discuss it later.",
        "A: Yes, he was living in this outer camp, and sometimes there was communication and\nyoucould __ had little pieces of paper or whatever, and you could communicate.\nAnd, he communicated with my mother that it 1s possible to bribe the commandant\nKohler of the reichsbahn where my brother was at to bring her and me to the\nreichsbahn, and my mother said yes she is going to send for some gold coins and fur\ncoats. It was something in because certain of the things we managed to give to a\nLatvian patient of my father\u2019s who was a head of a bank by the name of Abelit. His\nname was Abelit, and he did come through, this Abelit, and sent the things to Kohler\nand Kohler instructed my brother to get a message to me that I should be in the camp\non those three days and he will send a car for me. And, indeed, but not for my mother,\nbut for me. And, my mother said, \u201cAbsolutely you go. It\u2019s and don\u2019t worry about\nme. I'll be all right.\u201d So, I went and joined my brother, but I was not the only one in\nthe car. There was apparently a few more who had similar deals because he could be\nbribed. He was one who could be bribed. And, then my mother, we learned later, also\nwent to an out camp to work camp called the SS , the SS vegetable garden\nfor the SS et cetera. So, that\u2019s where she was, and then I saw my mother very briefly.\nWe had word that she would passing the reichsbahn. I don\u2019t know how we got the\nword, through whom, but that at that time was a convoy that we should be at the gate\nor whatever, and we actually saw our mother for maybe two minutes. We were just\nable to-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. When I came to the reichsbahn it was in comparison to Kaiserwald, paradise.\nThe food was slightly better, no beatings. I had an attack, I suffered appendicitis. I\nwas there in the camp hospital for a couple of days until I got better. Incidentally, I\nwas also in the Kaiserwald, had an attack there. And, a colleague of my father\u2019s, Dr.\nSik in Libau was the head of the hospital over there. He said, \u201cGeorge, I'll take you\ninto the hospital.\u201d And, he kept me there. On the third day, he said, \u201cGeorge, you\nbetter disappear because there\u2019s going to be inspection today and we don\u2019t know what\ncan happen. Do the best you can. Nothing is going to happen to you. Try not to work\ntoo hard or bend too hard.\u201d And, I left, and sure enough some of the sick ones were\ntaken away and shot. But, the reichsbahn in comparison was not all that bad, food-\nwise.",
        "A: It was run by the German reichsbahn, railroad.",
        "A: And, the commandant, you could \u2014 you could talk to him. He could also scream.",
        "A: He could scream.",
        "A: He could scream, yes, but by and large, I don\u2019t remember major beatings or so, for\nexample in the Kaiserwald, I remember having received once a smack in my face\nfrom the commandant Oberstrumbahnfuhrer Sauer. I saw stars in front of me. I was\nsupposed to clear the snow from the walkway, and I perhaps didn\u2019t do it as quickly.\nSo, he came out and said to me, \u201cHey, you Jew boy, why aren\u2019t you working?\u201d I said,\n\u201cT\u2019m working,\u2019 And, he slapped me. I fell maybe ten feet away from the slap, and I\njust stars in front of my eyes. This did not \u2014 was not the case in the reichsbahn, and in\nthe reichsbahn what was my task, I began to \u201chelp my brother\u2019 he was an auto\nelectrician. He knew about a car electrician as much as I know about the Chinese\nlanguage, and I was his assistant, and what we did, what we all did for example when\nwe had to screw in something, we would screw it in not all the way. It was our way\nof, \u201csabotaging\u201d the German war effort. We would always try to do things not a\nhundred percent, eighty percent. Hopefully, something will go wrong. But, when an\nSS man would come, and inspect, go around the big halls and inspect somebody\nwould scream out ; meant six. For some reason, I don\u2019t know why\nsix which meant inspector be careful. So, we all immediately-",
        "A: -got very seriously this and that running around, this was a code word.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember this. I don\u2019t remember this, and then we had a wonderful Jewish\ncouple, German Jewish couple who were working there too, and he and his wife were\nthe elders of this kasernierung Steinhart, Edith Steinhart. I forget his first name. They\nwere lovely, lovely people, and they were so to speak belonged to the German Jewish\ngroup in the camp, but were very good towards us. There was a couple from Vienna,\nlovely people, Maier was their name. Mr. and Mrs. Maier I remember, lovely, lovely\npeople from Vienna. There were two German Jewish couples who were a little bit on\nthe rough side, who became much rougher in Stolp, more to say about it. So, one was\nKentcourik from Lubek the other was Grunwald, or Greenwald also from Germany,\nbut I don\u2019t remember from what part of Germany. And suddenly, we knew that the\nRussians were advancing in the direction of Riga in the late spring of 1944. Suddenly,\nwe come to the camp, return from our work which was only may about 200 yards\nfrom where we were living, and that we all had to appear at an . That was in\nJuly 1944, and there was this SS doctor from the camp, Krebsbach and his deputy,\nWisner and Kohler standing and we\u2019re in this large hall and we were told to get\nundressed, get in line, and then there was a selection \u2014 left, right, left, right, left, right.\nMy brother was sent to the left, and I was sent to the right. But, my brother said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Kohler is there. He knows what we have done.\u201d So on and so forth,\n\u201cwe can do more, don\u2019t worry.\u201d My brother was sent to the left. I was sent to the\nright, and I never saw my brother again. My mother saw him still in Kaiserwald, and\nknew that he would be shot, and he said to my mother, \u201cDon\u2019t worry mother. We\u2019re\ngoing to take some of the Germans and Latvians, our shooters with us.\u201d\u201d My mother\nfelt that she could have rescued him and begged him to come to the fence, but he\nwouldn\u2019t come. He didn\u2019t want to upset my mother. So, he didn\u2019t come to the fence\nto see her again, and that was the last we heard of him.",
        "A: Yes, and then from Kaiserwald, they were taken the Rumbala forest where they were\nkilled, yes.",
        "A: Yes, but it must have been at the very end of July or the very beginning of August,\n1944. The ones who survived, I came back to the barracks, we came back to the\nbarracks, and I kept on \u2014 my brother was sleeping in the bunk bed next to mine. I\nsaid, \u201cBubbi, Bubbi, where are you? Bubbi, Bubbi, where are you?\u201d And, I had a\nhunch that this was it. That I wouldn\u2019t see him again, and he was taken probably to be\nshot, and I was alone now. It was at this stage that Julius Goldberg, who was in the\nsame barrack, et cetera, he said, \u201cGeorge, Ill take care of you. For as long as I will\nlive, you will live.\u201d And, Julius Goldberg was strong like an ox, very athletic, a\nyachtsman before the war, very handsome fellow, at that time probably in his late 20s\nI would think. But, he slept over there, and I slept over here, and fine. A week later,\nwe were taken to a ship. We were being evacuated because the Russians were coming\nclose. We were being evacuated, boarded the ship. That\u2019s when we were taken to\nStutthof in August 1944. And, it was a, I guess a troop carrier, what, I don\u2019t\nremember what it was before the war. Maybe it was a liner or so, but at that stage of\nthe game there were bunks all over the place, troop carrier, I guess. It was full of\nconcentration camp inmates. So, I was looking. Maybe I would see Bubi. Maybe I\nwould see my mother. And, we already had concentration camp garb by that-",
        "A: Striped uniforms, and I was looking up, and a woman was looking down without hair.\nI didn\u2019t know who it was without hair, and suddenly I heard a familiar voice saying,\n\u201cGeorgenka.\u201d My mother\u2019s voice. She was looking down. She was without hair. They\nhad taken her and shaved her hair, and there was my mother. So, for the next three\ndays we could see each other on the ship, and the interesting thing is that while we\nwere going through the bay of Riga, the Russians were shooting at the ship, but\nmissing us by a hundred or two hundred yards, and we just sailed through it, and the\nartillery shells would fall, go over the ship, fall on the other side maybe a couple of\nhundred yards from it, and we finally arrived near Danzig. We were put on the little\nrailroad cars. What do they call them? The schmalspurbahn, the German. It\u2019s not the\nregular, it\u2019s-",
        "A: Half cars, and not as wide. The railroad tracks were not as wide \u2014 lorries, kind of\nlorries, it\u2019s almost a sort of a choo-choo train, et cetera. So, we were transported to\nStutthof in August. That was Kaiserwald, however bad it was, was paradise in\ncomparison to Stutthof. We were beaten. We had to work also on the railroad tracks\nover there, not far from the gas chamber and crematorium we saw. We already knew\nwhat it was. The chimney burning all the time, burning the bodies. So, we knew and\nthe issue was how to survive there. Food was almost non-existent. We were all\nemaciated. We were all starving, but and I no longer saw my mother. I no longer saw\nmy mother.\nEnd of Tape 7\nTape 8",
        "A: Well, the beatings were almost non-stop now. The food was even worse than in\nKaiserwald. When we worked on the tracks, we were beaten all the time by the\nGermans and by the non-Jewish couples, even though I learned what a louse means in\nKaiserwald, and began the practice of delousing myself \u2014 the hair and over here and\nso call in the garb that we had. Now, we were full of lice in Stutthof. The facilities\nwere terrible. Sanitary facilities in Kaiserwald were also bad. For example, the toilet\nwas a kind of an outhouse. It was a square pit, and was \u2014 on top of this what was\nconstructed were columns. Columns was a wooden \u201cbench\u201d maybe six or eight inches\nand you would have to lift yourself up, that I never fell into the pit was a miracle, and\nincidentally, there were some kapos that were so bad that they were thrown into the\npit by the Jews, non-Jewish couples. But, in Stutthof it all over shadowed Kaiserwald\nfrom every point of view, especially the beatings. Now, the interesting part was that\nthe reichsbahn requested that the same people be spent to Stolp. So, I was part of it.",
        "A: I got of Stutthof.",
        "A: First of all, they would slap you, but then they also had whips \u2014 whips. They would\nbeat you like you would beat a wild horse when you want them to run or something to\nthat effect. It didn\u2019t matter if you were young or old, et cetera, and the infirm were\nimmediately taken after the appel to be shot, cremated.",
        "A: I always made myself older, and I always made myself taller, and this was street\nsmartness in a sense. Now, why was my brother taken?",
        "A: And, not me. Again, I resorted to the same tactic, but my brother used eyeglasses, and\nanybody who needed eye et cetera was already concerned infirmed, which we did not\nknow, or he would\u2019ve hidden the eyeglasses. So, he was taken. I did not need\neyeglasses. Yes, I was emaciated, but everyone was emaciated, and however much I\nsuffered from hunger pains, I suffered less than others because my father as a\ngastroenterologist, et cetera never permitted us to eat huge portions of anything, never\npermitted us too much, too many of the fatty things. In between meals, we could have\na fruit or something. He was strict about that \u2014 a fruit or so, but no as we\nwould call it, maybe a piece of this or that, et cetera nothing. A meal is a meal. That\u2019s\nwhen we can eat, but everything in moderate proportion.",
        "A: This was very helpful because I could never gorge myself with food, because many of\nthe people and that\u2019s what I first learned \u2014 poor people gorge themselves very often\nbelieving that they had to put on layers of fat that would protect them from the natural\n\u2014 from the winters or whatever, and this I only learned subsequently. I was not\nconscious of it before the war, but only after the war people talked about the food\nhabits in the camps, and those were my habits. However hungry I was, as I said\nbefore, I was not that hungry. The day of liberation, as Pll tell you a little later, I\nmistook soap for bread and I started to eat soap, but this was already on the day of\nliberation which is still to come.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Not even that long, probably not more than ten days or so the first time around.",
        "A: I turned-",
        "A: Later on, I guess in 19- wait a second. I had a birthday I remember, and this was in\n1944, was I 13 in 1944? I guess so, but this was in November, much later. I was still\nnow 12 in Stutthof.",
        "A: That was in \u2014 that was later. That was in November.",
        "A: \"44,",
        "A: Yes, we\u2019re still in 1944, in August, 1944. And, suddenly we were transported from\nStutthof to Stolp.",
        "A: In passenger cars, railroad cars.",
        "A: Yes, and the feeling was that the Nazis didn\u2019t want to show to their own people that\nyou transport prisoners \u2014 this was our interpretation \u2014 prisoners in cattle cars. That\nwas our interpretation. Whether this is true or not, I don\u2019t know. And, that turned out\nto be a work camp, living right on the premises in the reichsbahn right near the\nrailroad, the main railroad station there. There I became a carpenter, and I know as\nmuch about carpentry as I know about Chinese hieroglyphics. That I didn\u2019t chop off a\nfinger or something or other is still one of those miracles because I have no sense for\nthese things.",
        "A: Helping to repair cattle cars, transportation, et cetera. Sometimes you needed a board,\nso you had to do this. You do that. Don\u2019t ask me what somehow or another, and\nmanaged to do what was expected.",
        "A: No, no, no I wasn\u2019t building furniture. I was not an artist, along those lines. No. I was\na plain, plain worker.",
        "A: The food was manageable over there, and people who worked right near the tracks\nwere able to organize sometimes potatoes, carrots, because they would fall off from\nthe railroad tracks and smuggled into the camps and you could begin to trade a little\nbit here and there. So, you could augment the poor food that we got with some of the\nextras, but a few months later, some people did the same thing, organize some food,\nand they were caught by the Germans. And, now, the Germans wanted to teach us a\nlesson that theft 1s punishable. And, what they did was hang the people, and we were\nforced to march to see the hanging, and then march around the hangers to see them.\nHow did I survive this one? When it was announced hanging people, I didn\u2019t\nunderstand what it means, how a person can hang. Again, it became interesting to me\nto look at the person hanging. I didn\u2019t understand that this is involved with death. I\ndid not put two and two together. How can a person hang? And, only while hanging\ndid I realize that the person was hanged and it meant actual death. I did not connect\nthis before. So, to me again, it was a kind of a spectacle. Theater of the Absurd, if you\nwant to call it, or something along those lines. Sick! But I remember the context very\nwell because I think about it and how could I have reacted the way I reacted? And,\nmy answer 1s, folly of youth, did not understand, and number two, and perhaps even\nmore important than this, curiosity because everything interested me especially that\nwhat I didn\u2019t understand. And, this happened three, four months before our liberation\nwhen the Russians were already on German soil, and also during this period in Stolp,\nthe German Jewish couples began to behave atrociously to the Eastern European\nJews. When somebody was caught organizing something internally or so, he had to\nreceive twenty lashes, and the German Jewish couples were only delighted to mete\nout the punishment. One of them was Kentcourik who was particularly brutal. For\nsome reason or other, both of these couples Greenwald and Kentcourik liked me,\nmaybe because I spoke their type of German, and left me pretty much alone this and\nthat and were actually nice, but they were absolute \u2014 excuse me for using the term\nhere \u2014 bastards. And, I\u2019m jumping now forward for a minute. I was in the same\nhospital, after, right after the war as Kentcourik, and I came out of the hospital and\nwas brought back by the British to the rehabilitation, to the rehabilitation barrack in\nthe DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein with one of the British Red Cross cars,\nambulance cars, and Kentcourik \u2014 I informed the other guys who were there, fellows,\nmany of them that I was liberated with that Kentcourik was coming out. \u201cOh,\nKentcourik is coming out. We\u2019ll beat the hell out of him,\u201d and Kentcourik came in\nthinking that\u2019s he\u2019s coming 1n as a great hero, and chairs flew into his face, this and\nthat, so on and so forth. He was taken back to the hospital seriously injured. He\nsurvived this, and after the war he had two daughters, moved with his two daughters\nto Lubeck where he died subsequently, but I don\u2019t remember what happened to his\nother one, Grunwald, but that was the fate of this German Jewish couple Kentcourik.",
        "A: No, no, no, we were standing at attention walking, I would say about for an hour or\nSO.",
        "A: Yeah, for us to be taught a lesson. So, they were hanging there.",
        "A: You can interpret it as such. It was a protective mechanism perhaps. You could \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t think along these lines, but I can see this, yes, I can see this.",
        "A: But, not conscious.",
        "A: There was no conscious.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve been thinking about it ever since this particular episode. Hanging, et cetera,\nand when I watch the History Channel, and I see some of the \u2014 some of the things\nwhen Mussolini was hung with Clara Petacci, and how they used to hang Russian\nprisoners, the German and so on and so forth, this always comes back to me, this\nscene of how I had to watch these people being hanged. It\u2019s something that stays with\nme.",
        "A: Yes. Well, I guess you can interpret my reactions to many of the things in\npsychological terms as self-protection et cetera. The whole approach being the theater\nof the absurd, but looking at it with today\u2019s vocabulary and understanding et cetera,\nbut at the time, of course, I did not-",
        "A: I don\u2019t have this vocabulary and know this understanding.",
        "A: Absolutely because I could be next. Yes, you never knew. Yeah, and, in Stolp I was\nsleeping in a bunk right next to Julius Goldberg. Again, everything straw, this and\nthat, lice, delousing was an every evening activity. Bathroom facility better than\nStutthof and Riga, but still \u2014 there was water. You could wash yourself in the barrack\nwhich was a converted \u2014 the barrack was actually not a true barrack. It was for a\nsteam engine that was converted into a kind of a barrack where we could sleep, bunk\nbeds. And, then, the Russians were coming very close and they were going to\nevacuate us, but before then, about the Bar Mitzvah. It was Eugenia Goldberg who\nwas a nurse, and persuaded the SS woman to let her do something for me. And, she\n\u201cbaked\u201d something from potatoes which was the most delicious thing I thought I'd\never eaten because I was so starved \u2014 a kind of a potato pie. She explained it to Sheila\nRobbins, maybe she would be able to explain it to you what it was, and then the SS\nwoman was present. I was permitted to come in from the man\u2019s quarter including\nJulius Goldberg, her husband.",
        "A: Yes, yes, that was a wife.",
        "A: Wonderful, wonderful woman, and songs were sung by inmates including one of the\nsongs sung in English, Lambeth Walk, I remember and the SS woman actually\nenjoying it too.",
        "A: Yeah. It was \u201cvery festive\u201d under the circumstances.",
        "A: Extraordinary, yeah. So-",
        "A: Yes, I guess it was, yes. It was my Bar Mitzvah I guess, end of \u201944. I\u2019m confused\nwith the dates sometimes a little because sometimes I was made older, sometimes I\nwas made younger. So, I have to think about. It was nothing unusual in those\ncircumstances.",
        "A: It was in Stolp, yes. Now, it was not long thereafter, a couple of months actually, I\nthink it was in March, beginning of March or end of February when we were sort of\ndumped into cattle cars again, and we were returning to Stutthof But, because the\nRussians were already nearby and my mother was already liberated nearby which I\ndidn\u2019t know. I found this out only after I met her, we spent about a week in these\ncattle cars with hardly any food, no facilities to speak of, 1n the corners we had where\nthe stench was absolutely incredible. Finally, we came to Danzig and we didn\u2019t\nmanage to get to Stutthof and we were brought to another small camp Burggraben,\nand we marched. It was a long march from Danzig to Burggraben. It was very cold, I\nremember. It was about easily, easily ten, twelve miles in our circumstance to march.\nWe arrived in Burggrabben. It was knee deep in mud. There were no German guards.\nIt was no man\u2019s land between the Russian front and the German front. The Russians\nwould shoot their artillery across our heads, and the Germans would shoot their\nartillery across our heads.",
        "A: And we were in the middle. For about a week to ten days I would say with hardly any\nfood, hardly anything to drink.",
        "A: Sitting there.",
        "A: Watching what was happening. Watching what was happening. Suddenly, German\ntrucks appeared. This was in March \u201945. We\u2019re hauled to those German trucks, and\nthey took us to Stutthof back.",
        "A: Yeah, the second time. Now, Stutthof the first time was paradise in comparison to\nStutthof the second time. Rampant typhoid, hardly any food, Russian plans attacking\nus, didn\u2019t know that it was probably a camp or so. The ovens burning all the time,\nhardly anything to eat, people dying left and right, being shot left and right, Germans\nunleashing their dogs, police dogs. And, the police dogs biting people including\nJulius Goldberg was bitten like mad. His feet swelled up, and we were there for about\ntwo weeks, maybe a little longer give or take a week or so when suddenly the order\ncame, \u201cEvacuation.\u201d We\u2019re going to be evacuated by boat. And, again, we were\nhauled off in these mini-train, these mini-railroad tracks, not the regular ones to\nbarges in Danzig, or near Danzig, barges. And, then we were taken on these barges on\nthe high seas \u2014 the Baltic, the North Sea. For the trip, we received a loaf of bread and\nsome water. That was it because we subsisted on sea water during the trip, salt water.\nSS Guards were guarding us, and if you had to step out, you had to do it over the\nrailing and into the water on these barges, and you could see the SS Guards pushing\npeople with their shoes into the Baltic or into the North Sea. I remember very\ndistinctly I suddenly saw a German coming, passing me. I thought, well, this was my\nend, but it passed me and didn\u2019t do anything. And, we were down, et cetera. To climb\nup we had no strength left or anything of the sort, but Julius despite his illness, I mean\nhe was as strong as a bull. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my life. And, suddenly\nwe were told that we had arrived in Hamburg, but I don\u2019t think it was Hamburg, but\nthis 1s what I remember, and that we had to get out very quickly for Hamburg because\nthe Americans were in Hamburg. It was actually the Brits, not the Americans, and\nthen, we were taken back to the high seas, and at night the German guards abandoned\nus, and we were told that we were in minefields.",
        "A: On the high seas, minefields, abandoned and we didn\u2019t know what to do. On our\nbarges, were Norwegian POWs, and they collected the blankets we had still from the\ncamp, and made sails out of them. And, came close to, very close to the shore that we\nlater learned was Neustadt in Holstein, about 25 miles or kilometers from Lubek, and\nthe decision was made \u2014 this was about four o\u2019clock in the morning, five o\u2019clock in\nthe morning, May the third \u2014 that we would wade to shore and walk in the direction\nof Hamburg where the Americans are, and we\u2019ll be liberated. Julius was immediately\nfor wading and was taking me along. I said, \u201cJulius please, please let me die. I have\nno strength. Please leave me alone!\u201d I remember Julius was stone. He said, \u201cNope,\nyou\u2019re coming with me\u2019, and took me by the collar and dragged me. We had to go\ndown, and actually in this very cold May in the North Sea, early morning, and I knew\na little bit how to swim from the Baltic. I grew up on the shores of the Baltic. I knew,\net cetera, but I had no difficulties wading to shore, and we all lined up and people\ntook a long time because there were several barges of people, and there were people\nstill there who didn\u2019t want to leave, and left very slowly, and suddenly, units of the\nGerman Navy arrive because it turned out that this was a U-boat school in Neustadt in\nHolstein, a huge U-boat school. Units of the German Navy arrived.\nEnd of Tape 8\nTape 9",
        "A: By now, I really felt totally, completely, totally exhausted \u2014 completely and totally\nstarved because we were subsisting on sea water. How long can you subsist on sea\nwater? I just wanted to sleep because we were crowded in like herring, but he\nwouldn\u2019t let go of me.",
        "A: Yeah, and then when we finally waded there, when the German troops arrived from\nthe __i marina, from the naval units, they started shooting at random. People were\nstill on the barges, wading toward the shore. People who were sitting, who were too\nweak to get up were shot immediately. It was the day of liberation, incidentally. And,\nnow another march. We were going to march someplace, and I said to Julius, again,\n\u201cJulius, please leave me alone! I want to die.\u201d And, he was all swollen from the dog\nwhere he was bitten. He said, \u201cNo\u201d, and again he pushed me. And, the march was not\na long one, a couple of miles, and we arrived at this huge complex, a German U-boat\nschool. There was a huge soccer field, and there were thousands and thousands of\npeople there from other camps. And, we were told that there is a ship by the name of\nCap Arcorna that we\u2019re going to be put on that ship, and we will sale for I don\u2019t\nremember where. I was semi-delirious and I was really starved, and in the shuffle in\nthese thousands of people, I lost Julius. I wandered around. British planes were\noverhead and shooting, and the Cap Arcona was offshore, but there was another ship,\nthe Athens, and we were supposed to line up and get onto the Athens to be taken to\nthe Cap Arcorna. And, I wandered around still, and suddenly, I see a pile of things,\nand I was in a delirious state by then, a German guard looking at it, guns \u2014 all sorts of\nthings, and saw there what I would call today \u2014 it was soap, but I mistook it for bread.\nI picked it up and I started to eat it, and I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t bite it. I couldn\u2019t eat it.\nIt didn\u2019t taste like bread. So, I threw it away, and I walked over to the guard and said\nto him, \u201cMay I have a slice of bread?\u201d He said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you walk over to this\ntank? This is a British tank. You have been liberated, walk over and you'll get\nsomething.\u201d So, I walked over to the tank. The British, I decided to speak English, I\nsaid, \u201cI\u2019m very, very hungry. Can I please have a slice of bread?\u201d So, they gave me\nthese cookies, a number of cookies to eat because they didn\u2019t have bread, but it was\nsome sort of cookies.",
        "A: Crackers.",
        "A: Those were crackers rather, not cookies, you\u2019re right, crackers. And, we were free,\nand I saw the Athens there. In the meantime, just then, the Cap Arcorna was sunk by\nthe British. Most of the people drowned, most of the prisoners drowned. A few\nsurvived included Sam Bressler and his father \u2014__. And, some way or other, I saw\nJulius again, and I saw people stealing goods from the German storage places, food.\nThey had huge gallons of marmalade, I guess for the soldiers, for the Naval people\nwhatever, and people hauling, people eating all over. Many died by overeating\nimmediately.",
        "A: Immediately, I was too weak to even carry that much, but Julius and I and some\nothers went into a barrack and took over the rooms. The bunk beds was clean,\neverything. And, that\u2019s where we decided we\u2019re going to be for the night, and we\nwere basically free, but it didn\u2019t mean anything to me being free. I did receive some\ncrackers, something else, et cetera. So, my basic hunger was to an extent satiated, and\nthen I went out myself and I organized something also one of those cans I managed to\nbring back. Suddenly, there\u2019s a knock on the door and several Poles walked in,\nlooked around, and said among themselves, and by then I knew some Polish because I\nlived with Poles at the camps, \u201cThis is our place and out you Jew! Out! You out!\u201d He\ndidn\u2019t say Jews, and the Jews said, \u201cYou better get out or else.\u201d And, Julius was in\nthe forefront as sick as he was. Those days are over. They left quietly, and we stayed\nthere. Now, while we were still on the barges, we heard the best news of all that\nHitler was killed fighting the Russians. He was killed in Berlin. It was very, very late\nApril. It must have been about the 29\" or 30\" of April, just a few days before we\nwere liberated. We were liberated on the third of May by the British. And, the day\nGermany officially capitulated, I collapsed out of total weakness and I was taken to\nthe hospital in Neustadt in Holstein. The many, many other prisoners from Libau,\nfrom Riga, from German Jews that I met subsequently, Czech Jews, so on and so\nforth were all there, and I stayed for a good number of weeks. I think four or six\nweeks I stayed there.",
        "A: No, it had nothing to do.",
        "A: The appendix was finally taken out in Hamburg, September or October 1945. I had an\nattack, but by then I was already on the Warburg Estate in _. No, it was general\nweakness. I luckily did not suffer from diphtheria, typhoid or any of these illnesses\nbecause as soon as the Germans occupied Libau, my father said I\u2019m going to give you\ncertain injections against certain illnesses. These were not only injections over a\nnumber of days, I remember once he cut something. It was a kind of a special type of\na razor, and he had something \u2014 there was something on the razor, and that was\nenough. I guess it was against typhoid or something or other, and then several other\nthings, and my mother escaped all of this, and I escaped all of this. I didn\u2019t have\ntyphoid. I didn\u2019t have diphtheria, and some of the other illnesses associated, but\nespecially typhoid and diphtheria.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: He must have had some-",
        "A: So, he wanted to make sure at least to immunize us as best as he could.",
        "A: I would think so, but I don\u2019t know. I would think so, yes. He immunized the rest of\nthe family. So, why shouldn\u2019t he immunize himself? So, this was basically the\nliberation.",
        "A: Which doesn\u2019t feel like liberation, and yet I was liberated.",
        "A: Yeah, and thanks for Julius. If not for Julius, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019 ve made it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: He promised me that-",
        "A: Yes, and this was nothing uncommon when a kid was left alone. An older person\nwould sort of volunteer.",
        "A: To do it.",
        "A: Julius at that time was probably mid or late twenties.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, that was Eugenia.",
        "A: She survived. She\u2019s still living in Israel.",
        "A: Yes, she\u2019s still living in Israel \u2014 wonderful, wonderful person.",
        "A: No, I had a feeling that she\u2019s alive, but where, what, when, et cetera, no. Before I go\nto the Warburg Estate, a group of Russian officers arrived with British officers trying\nto convince me to go back to Latvia, go back to Latvia, go back to the Soviet Union,\net cetera. The answer \u2014 my answer was a categorical no because we made a pact, a\nfamily, never go east, go back. You go. We have relatives in England, the United\nStates, and we\u2019re given a name so on and so forth to remember, but never go back,\nand I said, \u201cCategorically, I\u2019m not going back.\u201d The British officers still tried to\nconvince me to go back, and a good number did go back. Some of them are now in\nIsrael. After horror \u2014 after spending horrible times in the Soviet Union in Latvia until\nthe \u201870s, and I refused to go back. Then, the Brits became suspicious of me that I\nwasn\u2019t Jewish, despite the fact that I\u2019m circumcised, and put me, brought me, took me\nto a Latvian children\u2019s home where only Latvian was spoken, where some of the\nleaders were former patients of my father, where they talked about Tievzeme in\nLatvian, the Fatherland, how eventually we\u2019ll all go back to the Fatherland, et cetera,\nbut this was a little bit strange to me because we had Latvian guards. Some of the\nLatvians were innocuous. Others were horrible. I believe this guy Cukurs, especially\nCukurs. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable there. They also wanted to introduce me \u2014 they had\nwith a woman. This was in . She wanted to introduce me to General Dankers\nwho apparently knew my father. General Dankers was one of the sympathizers, Nazi\nsympathizers who managed to get to Lubek. He headed Latvian troops, so on and so\nforth. But, which I did not know exactly, but General Dankers just didn\u2019t sound right\nthat I should meet him. In Lubek, she wanted to take me because apparently he knew\nmy father, but when we needed the Latvians, they didn\u2019t come through those who\nwere in the position to come through. One day, when the head, this woman, went to\nLubek for a day or so, I decided to run away, and I ran away and I ran all the way to\nthe DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein. the DP Camp.\u201d But, this was a second\ntime around, not the first time. The first time I was brought back to the \u2014 I\u2019m sorry.\nThis was the second time around because the first time after a few days I had a\nrelapse, and I was taken back to the hospital for another twelve days. The second\ntime, it was when they took me to the Latvian children\u2019s home, and after a few\nweeks, I ran away. I came to the camp which was in this U-boat school, and I went to\nthe bunk where I had originally brought back, the rehabilitation bunk, and I\u2019ve got a\nbed so on and so forth, and what were the people doing? Playing poker. Playing\npoker. Playing \u2014 what you call it? They call 1t 21? \u2014 Blackjack, blackjack, and making\npiles of money. In those days, the exchange rate was one dollar to 600 Marks, and I\ndon\u2019t know how I got a few Marks to play also. I figured, \u201cWhy not?\u201d And, I had a\nvery good memory, and after a few days, I saw this and I knew every card that had\ngone out and so on and so forth. I began to play, and I piled in tens of thousands of\nMarks which translates into dollars, maybe it was twenty or twenty-five dollars, but\nin Marks, it sounded enormous amount, and then I decided that it\u2019s time for me to see\nthe world.",
        "A: No, thirteen.",
        "A: To see the world. I had plenty of money because the official rate if you went to a\nrailroad station was still actually two or three Marks or four Marks for a ticket let\u2019s\nsay to go to Hamburg. Now, I\u2019m an adult. I\u2019ve seen it all I felt. I would love to live\nthe life my aunts, my uncles, and my parents. To see the world \u2014 Berlin, Paris, night\nclubs, dancing, et cetera, that part of the world, and Neustadt was just a DP camp. So,\nI packed a few things that I had with my money, maybe by that time twenty, thirty\nthousand Marks which for Germans was an awful lot of money, got it all, and I\ndecided to go to Hamburg. The reason being that we were told that we also had\nfamily in Germany, part of the family came from Hamburg, and part of the family\ncame from Dresden. And, obviously, I didn\u2019t find anybody in Hamburg, and I didn\u2019t\nexpect to find, but at least I got to Hamburg. I didn\u2019t think it through would I go to a\nhotel? Do I need this? Do I need that? Et cetera, no.",
        "A: By train.",
        "A: That was not a problem. I bought my ticket. I went to Hamburg, and I remembered\ngoing to a police station saying, \u201cI looked for so and so.\u201d I spoke German, and I\ndidn\u2019t know. So, I was taken to the Warburg Estate in , a Suburb of Hamburg\nwhich the Warburg family had temporarily given over to \u2014 I guess there\u2019s a joint\ndistribution committee of the American Relief Unit to turn it into a children\u2019s home,\njust a small children\u2019s home. I arrived there, and I was told, \u201cYes, I belong there.\u201d So,\nthat\u2019s how I arrived. It must have been late summer or early fall. I remember a few\nweeks later, getting an attack, appendix attack. I was operated on. I was all alone. I\nwas scared, in the Altona Hospital in Hamburg. I spoke German. I told them that my\nfather was a gastroenterologist. I spoke German to them. They were very nice to me,\nbut I was still very much afraid. They were Germans. You don\u2019t know what they can\ndo to me. I thought at that time, and I always reacted very poorly to ether, and I\nremember throwing off the mask in those days, but before the war my tonsils were\nremoved also under ether and I reacted very poorly in Riga, and I threw off the mask,\nwhich I did again, but next thing I knew I came out of the operation all right. I stayed\nfor a number of days in the hospital. When I was brought back for further recovery to\nthe estate. Now came the issue \u2014 there were several issues. First of all, to find mother,\nand then I wanted to go to Palestine because there were people from the Jewish\nBrigade in uniform and out of uniform, legally and illegally, Hamburg to train us. Not\nonly to teach us Hebrew, the history of Israel, the history of Palestine, Jewish History,\nalso Hebrew, mathematics, so on and so forth, but prepare also for Aliyjah Bet which\nwas illegal immigration. And, the war to an extent, it\u2019s only in retrospect that\nradicalized me. Why did I suffer? I suffered because I\u2019m a Jew. Is there anything\nreally to be ashamed of being a Jew? No, I was ashamed when I met the girl that I\nfancied on the street, and, you know, shame came over me that I could not really talk\nand I really felt inferior which I never did before. But, this was a kind of a reaction I\nguess to my timidity at the time to having felt ashamed that I reacted the way I did,\nand was prepared to go to Palestine, prepared to take up a gun against the British\nbecause they were so horrible also to the Jews not permitting the Jews to come in,\ngiving maybe 1,500 certificates a month, and there were hundreds and hundreds of\nthousands and Jews who wanted to move to Palestine, so on and so forth, but this\ncomes a little later. When it\u2019s all started, and my mother and brother, especially my\nmother said, \u201cYou go west, never go east.\u201d You must remember your relatives in\nAmerica, and in England. In London, remember your Uncle Robert, Robert Schwab. I\nsaid, \u201cYes, of course. He visited us in Libau. I remember him well.\u2019\u201d\u2019 Remember to\nwrite simply Robert Schwab, Director Shell Oil, London, England it will arrive\nbecause he was one of the heads of Shell Oil, but I had forgotten that he was the\ndirector of Shell Oil. So, I wrote, \u201cRobert Schwab, London, England.\u201d It all went\nthrough military mail because you could not write. It went through the Joint\nDistribution Committee. It never arrived. To my cousin in Salt Lake City, I wrote,\n\u201cMr. David Alder.\u201d He was married to my cousin Anna Alder, who\u2019s in this\nphotograph who went to America, and there I wrote to Mr. David Alder, Director\nShell Oil, but he was not Director of Shell Oil, and it arrived to the local manager of\nShell Oil in Salt Lake City, letter after letter. He disregarded it, but one day he\ndecided to look up in the phone book in Salt Lake City who this David Alder was. It\nturned out that he was the owner of an insurance company in Salt Lake City, David\nAlder Insurance Company. So, he called David Alder and asked him, \u201cDoes the name\nGeorge Schwab mean anything to you?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, he is my wife\u2019s cousin.\u201d So,\nthis was a first contact. I wrote to my other cousin in West Hartford, Broskin, it never\narrived because it was just Dr. and Mrs. Broskin, Hartford, Connecticut. It never\narrived. But, this man, this one man, immediately contacted my uncle in London and\ncontacted his sister, his wife\u2019s sister in Hartford, Connecticut. So, they were already\nnow in touch, but my mother knew to write the correct. So, she independently got in\ntouch, and this way we connected. We were able to speak on the phone, on the\nmilitary phone once a week.",
        "A: She was liberated in Lauenburg, it is on the map over there, already in March, and she\nworked as a nurse in the Russian hospital. Then, she heard later on in May or June\nthat there are a lot of Jews in Lodz, and maybe I am one of those who she could find\nin Lodz or get some information. Turns out that she arrives in Lodz, gets off a trolley\ncar and somebody says, \u201cFrau Dr. Schwab in German. Frau Dr. Schwab. Frau Dr.\nSchwab.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, who was it?\u201d It\u2019s is Mrs. Dorbian the son comes now several\ntimes had come to Latvia. He\u2019s my age. We were together in . It was his\nmother. \u201cDo you know that George is alive in the British zone?\u201d She didn\u2019t ask,\n\u201cWhere? When?\u201d She was so overwhelmed, she ran back to Lauenburg, picked up\nher few things that she had, and went to Berlin almost penniless, comes to Berlin and\nBerlin was a second home to her because she had been very often to Berlin before the\nwar especially in the \u201820s and early \u201830s. And, decided she was going to go to the\nJoint Distribution Committee. She went to the Joint Distribution Committee. They\nwanted to test her, \u201cWho is she?\u201d She didn\u2019t speak Yiddish. She looked like a\nthousand percent Aryan. So, they were suspicious because many wanted to do things,\nand she got away with no results, but she went back to the Joint several times, and\nthen there was a woman who said to her, \u201cYou know Mrs. Schwab, I believe your\nstory. I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d And, with the help of this person, she was able to write\nto the United States because again, everything had to go through military mail, and\nthrough them she found out where I am which the Joint was able to connect me then\nby telephone to my mother because the Warburgs, the Joint Distribution Committee\nand the American and the English Relief Unit were sort of the heads of the so-called\nchildren\u2019s home in the Warburg estate, were able to connect once a week. My mother\nwent to the Joint in Berlin, and I was, of course at the Warburg Estate, and it was pre-\narranged what time we would be talking. So, we started to talk, and in those days, it\nwas not easy to go from Hamburg from the British zone to Berlin because you had to\ngo to the British Sector or the American sector because we had to go by way of the\nSoviet zone, and it took months before I was brought to Berlin. But, in the meantime,\nwhen my relatives found out that I was alive, they started bombarding me with\npackages and money, and every single letter was five dollars, ten dollars, twenty\ndollars. Sometimes I received a package a day. I didn\u2019t know what to do with\ncigarettes and coffee, but they wrote me they coffee and the cigarettes are not for you,\nbut we\u2019ve been led to understand that there\u2019s a lot you can do with it in Germany. So,\nthat\u2019s for that purpose. Now, it may sound very funny, but it\u2019s true. I felt that I was\nnow an independent young man. I\u2019ve gone through the camps. I\u2019m going to live the\nlife of my parents, aunts and uncles. I am rich. I have now all this coffee, et cetera,\nand among other things, I managed to get myself a driver with his car. He came to the\nWarburg Estate. He always picked me up whenever I needed or wanted. I had my\nwine table in the Alhambra in the , It was a kind of a red light district I went to in\nthe evenings. For two cigarettes, I could get it at my age because it was my card\nI\u2019 dentitie.\nEnd of Tape 9\nTape 10",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I don\u2019t know how come that I got that driver with that car. I don\u2019t remember, but\nthey used to come around to Hamburg to , and they had a car, and I started out\nby saying, \u201cI'll give you a pack of cigarettes if you can drive me here or there.\u201d And,\nthen they offered that anytime I wanted, I could have the car with a driver. There\nwere two brothers, and they owned a factory on the other side of Hamburg, in\nHarburg with 200 people working, and they offered me, incidentally, to buy the\nfactory for ten pounds of coffee and 40,000 cigarettes.",
        "A: Yes. So, I figured, \u201cWhat do I need a factory for?\u201d",
        "A: Yes, I did, ten pounds. I mean, I didn\u2019t have at that moment, neither 10,000 \u2014 40,000\ncigarettes. Which meant, I don\u2019t know, 400 or 4,000 packs of cigarettes and ten\npounds of coffee. First of all, I didn\u2019t have it. I had maybe a thousand cigarettes or\nmaybe two pounds of coffee, which was a lot in Germany at that time, but then I\nfigured, \u201cWell, I could ask my aunt, but what am I going to do? I want to have a good\ntime.\u201d And, I had now access to the Alhambra. With two cigarettes, you could get in\nany place.",
        "A: It didn\u2019t matter with two cigarettes. That\u2019s what we called a Carte D\u2019identite, and\nidentification card.",
        "A: I had my own wine table there, and it was very interesting, fascinating because you\nhad a kind of a telegraph system there with tubes. If you sat at table fifteen, and you\nwanted to dance with somebody at table eighteen, you wrote a little bit, \u201cLet us meet\nin the center of the dance floor, fifteen.\u201d And, I just had to write \u201cEighteen\u201d and it\nwould arrive by tube, and then we would meet or something or other. I knew about as\nmuch about dancing as I know about the ballet dancing (laughs), but I learned, et\ncetera, and because one of the things that I remembered very well became the rage in\nLatvia before the war in the late \u201830s was the Tango, and a particular type of Tango\nNaturno. It was one dance, and the Lambeth walk. People went crazy tangoing and\nLambeth walking. So, I was sort of going to live their lives.",
        "A: There\u2019s a German expression Kleiner Mann Was Nun? It was a novel written by, I\nforget the author\u2019s name, \u201csmall man, what now?\u201d In other words, looking at it in\ntoday\u2019s terms, at that time, I didn\u2019t know about the author nor about the novel Kleiner\nMann Was Nun, and I in the evenings were not really supervised as much at the\nWarburg Estate. As long as we were there in the morning for hitamulut is what they\ncalled it in Hebrew, the exercises, callisthenic exercises, appearing in class, doing\nsome homework. We didn\u2019t take studies very seriously. Much more interesting was\nwhen we learned a little about how to smuggle arms, and this and preparing for Aliyah\nBet, not to sit with this dry stuff mathematics or, so, who needed it. Anyways, in the\nmeantime, Julius Goldberg met up with his wife. She was liberated in Cologne \u2014 in\nKiel, sorry, in Kiel. And, she was in one of the barges that didn\u2019t come to Neustadt in\nHolstein but went to Kiel. And, then he became Norbert Wollheim\u2019s driver. Norbert\nWollheim became the head of the Jews of the British Zone. And, Norbert was\nheadquartered in Lubek, Germany, and Julius would drive him when he had to go to\nKiel, to Hamburg, orto _. So, usually when Julius had to drive himto _, he\nhad to go by way of Hamburg. So, Julius would come to swith Wollheim, pick\nme up, take me to to the DP camp where I met Yosele for the first time, Yosele\nRosensaft, Manachem\u2019s father, for the first time. That was in \u201945 still. And, then\nwould drive me back either to or at times take me all the way to Lubek where I stayed\nat the Wollheim home with his first wife, beautiful woman incidentally, and that\u2019s\nhow I reconnected with Julius. This is how I reconnected with Eugenia. They were\nliving in a DP camp in Kiel at the time, and I visited them also in Kiel if Juluis picked\nme up. I saw Eugenia for the first time since the liberation. And, in the meantime in\nHamburg, I did this. I did that.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t play cards. I didn\u2019t need to. I made my money in Neustadt in Holstein\nplaying cards.",
        "A: It was enough. I had plenty of money.",
        "A: Yes, getting money in every single envelope, I had at any time, I had at least a\nhundred dollars in cash.",
        "A: At any time because in every single envelope there\u2019s five dollars, ten dollars,\nsometimes twenty dollars coming from especially from my cousins in West Hartford\nand Salt Lake City, and sometimes I would get two or three letters a day \u2014 a week\nfrom each of them. In every envelope, there was five dollars or ten dollars or twenty\ndollars.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Very much so.",
        "A: As a kid.",
        "A: Oh, I thought right now.",
        "A: Ah?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t think of it in those terms, but the answer is yes.",
        "A: Yes, because I was living the life of my parents and my relatives.",
        "A: I was pretty much alone.",
        "A: I was pretty much alone.",
        "A: No, I was pretty much alone, yes. I have a photograph with my drivers in Hamburg.",
        "A: You have them.",
        "A: So, what was your question?",
        "A: Just fantasy as it was.",
        "A: I was living a fantasy, but I fanaticized before the war because I found it very, very\nexciting when they talked about when my mother and father were for the first time in\nParis in 1928 at Maxime\u2019s when the dinners my parents attended in the private home,\nthe private residence of my aunt in Berlin, for the diplomatic core, where Hindenburg\nwould say to my aunt, \u201cYou are my Garbo. You have to sit next to me.\u201d et cetera. She\nwas very strikingly beautiful woman. She basically looked like Garbo, and the whole\nlifestyle that we lived was a kind of a fairy tale which I never lived again because I\ndidn\u2019t have any means. But, as a child I at least fanaticized right after the war and\nwhatever I could, I did. Then, came the day when I was brought to Berlin to meet my\nmother.",
        "A: No, it was \u2014 that is coming. I\u2019m coming to this one. In the car, I was taking by the\nJoint finally in May 1946 to Berlin. I was thinking, \u201cDo I really want to go and meet\nmy mother?\u201d",
        "A: Am I going to live the old lifestyle again with governesses who are rigid \u2014 a certain\nrigid approach? Because now I\u2019m a man of the world. I had my own car. I had\nmoney. I was able to do as I pleased. I\u2019m not so sure that I want to see my mother\nagain especially if she would insist on the same type of rigidity, not the walls, but\nrigidity to which I was accustomed to. So, when we arrived finally late in the evening,\nmy mother lived privately, not in a DP camp, we lived privately in Berlin, I was\nbrought up and the person \u2014 her name was Selma from the Joint Distribution\nCommittee from the Bronx, lovely, lovely woman \u2014 and I saw my mother, and I gave\nher pro forma, a kiss, and she gave me pro forma, a kiss, and the first thing I asked\nher was, \u201cTell me, mother, what is the nightclub situation like in Berlin?\u201d I wanted to\nshow her who am I. She looked at me and said, \u201cThat\u2019s a very interesting question\nthat you\u2019re posing. Did you know that until now, I was here all alone in Berlin, but\nnow that you are, we\u2019ll be able to explore it together.\u201d She disarmed me on the spot,\nand I was satisfied with the answer and was looking forward to a life in Berlin.",
        "A: It turned out, yes, but rather than going to nightclubs, we went to some very\ninteresting cafes. We didn\u2019t go to a cabaret. I don\u2019t remember, no, because I don\u2019t\nthink I could get in in those days, but I dragged my mother literally to two to three\nmovies a day, two to three movies.",
        "A: A day, sometimes from on movie out into the second. Later on in New York, my\nmother said, \u201cWell, when you came and you had a problem.\u201d But, she was really\nwonderful. For example, she decided to sleep with me in the same room. I had\nnightmares, and she would jump up and calm me down from the nightmares,\n\u201cEverything is fine, George, we\u2019re together.\u201d And, I went back to sleep, but lasted for\nmonths and months and months. And, then she said, \u201cGeorge, I'll do everything\npossible in my life to make life as wonderful for you as possible for you to forget\nthese horrible years.\u201d And, she did it. But, then when she saw that she had a problem,\nshe said, \u201cGeorge, let\u2019s go, there\u2019s a DP camp. There\u2019s some sort of a school, and you\nmay meet interesting people there.\u201d And, I was always interested in meeting\ninteresting people. I didn\u2019t cherish the idea of a school, but let\u2019s go and look at this.\nAnd, lo and behold, I went to this school where Renia was my classmate. I was the\nyoungest in my class.",
        "A: Schlachtensee, exactly, I traveled everyday by elevated from where we lived privately\nin Berlin to Schlachtensee camp and then I went back because in Hamburg, we were\nall juvenile delinquents, and we didn\u2019t take classes all that seriously \u2014 spitballs. We\nused to shoot spitballs at the teachers. So, I thought we\u2019d do the same in Berlin which\nto an extent we did. We were not , and didn\u2019t have schooling for how many\nyears? Four or five years. I was a semi-literate buffoon with high falooting ideas.",
        "A: I lived a very brutal life, yes. That is true, but there were some very attractive girls in\nthe other class including Renia, and her two girlfriends, Tunia and Rachelka\nFeigenbaum.",

        "A: No, and I was the youngest, and they used to go the to all these places, and I\nwanted to tag along because after all, I have from the basis of my experiences, and\nRenia would dismiss me as this little jerk schnesel, \u201cHe wants to go with us.\u201d And,\nthe other young ladies, attractive young women laughed at me, and I felt very\ninsulted, and I say to Renia even now, \u201cTI still haven\u2019t forgiven you.\u201d (laughs) We\nhave a good laugh over it, but at that time, I took it very, very seriously. They just sort\nof dismissed me as, \u201cThis little jerk wants to join us ladies\u201d going to the , going\nto the Fifth Avenue of Berlin, to the exclusive places where they went, et cetera, as if\nI was a zero, so to speak.",
        "A: Over the years, yes, we talked a lot.",
        "A: Not at the beginning. She wanted me \u2014 she desperately wanted me to forget, to\ninvolve me in other things, to involve me in other things.",
        "A: Yes, she disarmed me and she became more like a pal going with me to the movies.\nLater on in New York, she would say, \u201cI thought I was going out of my mind at\ntimes\u201d, she would say to me. So, but, these were also formative years. These were\nalso the years, where I became very much involved in betar. I don\u2019t know if you\nknow anything about betar, the revisionist outfit. I went in eventually to the Stern\ngang. I was really radicalized, but this 1s a chapter in itself post World War II.",
        "A: Yes because there are certain things I learned which I did not know before \u2014 the\ngeography of Palestine, the history, the Alijah bet, the British policies towards the\nJews, the which I did not know anything about in Russia that led to the\nestablishment of the first _, the first among others, how the Jews turned this\nwasteland into a thriving community. We saw pictures of Tel Aviv, wonderful, and I\nwas very anxious to go to a warm climate because during the war in the winter years\nwhen it was freezing cold, I swore to myself that if I were ever to survive, I will go\nand live in a country that has a warm climate. Never again do I want to experience\nwinter, and here I am in New York.",
        "A: Yes, and then of course we began to study Hebrew, too, and I picked up a smattering\nof Hebrew, the alphabet, sentences here, sentences there, so on and so forth, which\nwas good because later on I joined the Stern, and then I studied in Israel for a while in\nthe early \u201850s.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I wanted to go directly to Palestine, if need be, fight. I wanted to \u2014 we were being\nprepared in Hamburg for Alijah Bet, illegal immigration because of the-",
        "A: We were being, not as yet trained to fight, but we did smuggle some radios, this and\nthat that we managed to pick up. Nothing very dangerous so far as guns or so, not at\nthis stage of the game, a little later, yes.",

        "A: So, life on the estate was wonderful. We had socials. I was always looking forward to\nthe socials, the dances, and with certainly what they call in Hebrew , the folk\ndances where the girl has to come and pick you up rather than you to the girl, which I\nliked very much, and I \u2014 no it was very nice, actually.",
        "A: Schlachtensee",
        "A: I am \u2014 my mother began to talk to me, and she always said even out of context to me\na man without an education is no man. It didn\u2019t register very much. I thought myself\nof being highly educated.",
        "A: The illiterate that I was, and then she loved to read books, and she would say to me,\n\u201cT don\u2019t understand George, how anybody can go through life without reading a\nbook.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested, period. I wasn\u2019t interested in studying. I wasn\u2019t\ninterested in reading. I was interested in enjoying life, what life has to offer. Then,\nshe said, \u201cLook, until age 21, I\u2019m in charge of you\u201d, but she didn\u2019t put it \u2014 she put it\nin very diplomatic, polite language, \u201cand before you can make up in your mind if you\nwant to go to Israel, but I want you to come with me to America where you can get an\neducation. Here in Europe, and you see what Europe 1s like, we will be lost. There\u2019s\nan opportunity. At least you\u2019ll get an education.\u201d And \u201cWhere are going to in\nAmerica?\u201d She said, \u201cNew York.\u201d Well, New York was interesting. I remembered the\nfilms, the speed, the size, the skyscrapers, some of the films. The idea was intriguing\nprovided, of course, that eventually I can go to Palestine, to fight 1f need be. She said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, after 21.\u201d In the meantime, she would have me, obviously, for six, seven\nyears, I guess to brainwash me. So, we decided that we would go to America, and my\ncousins provided the visas, and actually they paid for us to go second class, business\nclass on either the Queen Mary or the Queen Elizabeth, and the Joint promised that\ntickets would be issued for us for to go on the Queen Mary or Queen Elizabeth. We\nwould go by way of Paris to Marseilles \u2014 yeah, Marseilles I think it was \u2014\nembarkation and \u2014 no, not Mar \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the port, and the Joint \u201cpocketed\u201d\nthe money.",
        "A: Yeah, but my cousin said later on, \u201cLet\u2019s forget. They used it for others.\u201d And, we\nwent on the SS Marine Perch which was a troop carrier. That was in March 1947. We\nleft Berlin together with the Lermans.",
        "A: Chris Lerman.",
        "A: Chris\u2019s yeah, and my mother and I. We all went together to Bremin. We all sort of\nlived together. Aboard ship, Miles and I, we were bunking together, and my mother\nwas bunking with Renia and Chris. So, the twelve days, we were also together aboard\nship, and then we landed in New York. And, I was very disappointed because I was\ntold in Berlin, the night before, you can already see the lights of New York. So, the\nnight before, I stood on the deck looking for the lights of New York, and I didn\u2019t see\nany. It was a clear night, and I believed it, and then we docked on 42\u2122 or was it 44\"\nStreet and Twelfth Avenue, and these were shacks. I was so disappointed, and it was\na misty morning. I didn\u2019t see any skyscrapers. I just saw the West Side Highway. This\nwas my first shock of the new world.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t think it was a fake, \u201c\u201cWhere is it?\u201d et cetera, and we were awaited there\nby some relatives who took us to Brooklyn actually, Borough Park where we stayed\nfor six weeks, and my mother didn\u2019t like it. So, we moved to Manhattan. But, I loved\nit in Brooklyn in the meantime. I was registered there in the New Utrecht High\nSchool in Bensonhurst, and there I fell into an interesting group of Jewish activists, so\non and so forth, and one thing led to the other, but this is now coming to the United\nStates, already in the United States.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Brooklyn didn\u2019t have any. There was a Hotel St George, I think that was\nabout twelve or fifteen stories, but nothing like the Empire State Building.",
        "A: Pretty good. It wasn\u2019t good, but I would say it was pretty good. I understood,\nsometimes. That\u2019s an interesting story about going to school. It was obligatory of us\nto get a high school degree, and I lived in the district in New Utrecht, and it was an\nuncle by marriage that took me to New Utrecht, to Brooklyn, and in Bensonhurst, and\nI was overwhelmed by the most gorgeous teachers in the world who looked to me like\nseventeen, eighteen, but where actually \u2014 they were actually seventeen, eighteen, but I\nfigured they must be in their late 20s or 30s because they had manicured nails. In\nEurope, this was forbidden for students. No lipstick permitted, no powder, no\nmascara, or anything. So, I thought that they were all teachers. I said, \u201cMy god, this 1s\ngoing to be interesting.\u201d",
        "A: And I registered. I was registered and I started only to find out that they were all\nstudents, wonderful, one more gorgeous than the other, especially the Italian girls.\nThey were young, they\u2019re absolutely gorgeous, and I skipped a lot of grades. Hebrew\nfrom - they tested me and put me immediately into Hebrew six, the last semester. So,\nI got credits as a foreign language. English, I started with English one. They put me in\nthe most fundamental course, but was transferred shortly thereafter to English three.\nSo, I managed to skip a number of grades. History \u2014 World War II history, I didn\u2019t\nread about it, but I knew more than the kids 1n class. In short, I graduated high school,\nwhich I would have never been able to do in the gymnasium in less than two years,\nNew Utrecht High School. To my mother, this was heaven. At least, I have a degree\nnow. Now, let\u2019s see where we go from here.\nEnd of Tape 10\nTape 11",
        "A: Yes. First of all, I heard the first time the term \u201ccoot\u201d\u2019",
        "A: \u201cCoot\u201d and I came home to my uncle and aunt, and I said, \u201cThe girls say that \u2019'm a\ncoot. What does it mean?\u201d Cute, but as I understand it, and never knew the word cute,\nthat I was cute. They thought I was cute, et cetera.",
        "A: Yes, I was delighted, and I sort of reciprocated. I don\u2019t know what term I used, but\nthen it was very interesting. I had a science teacher who in one day said, \u201cLook how\nadvanced we are and how backward Europe is. In Europe, the people don\u2019t even have\neyeglasses.\u201d I raised my hand and said, \u201cNot so, my brother wore eyeglasses. There\nwere eyeglasses. I saw many people with eyeglasses.\u201d \u201cOh, you\u2019re dreaming.\nCertainly not in those days before the war, maybe now here and there, but there were\nno such things as eyeglasses.\u201d And, he had eyeglasses and some of the students had\neyeglasses. We have eyeglasses. Then I remember some of the friends that I made\nover there, I visited their homes in Bensonhurst and in Borough Park, and they said to\nme, \u201cLook electricity.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d And, they were surprised that I was nonplussed\nby it because they said, \u201cIn Europe, you don\u2019t have this.\u201d I said, \u201cWe had electricity.\u201d\nSo, they were thinking that I was spinning, or running water or things like these, and\nwhen they asked me how I lived, and originally when I explained, they thought that I\nwas fibbing. So, I decided to shut up, and just listen and not say anything because\nwhat I encountered here were I guess middle class people who had no inkling what\nanother type of lifestyle may be, and my mother did the same. Only among her\nfriends, she had plenty of friends here from pre-war Europe, we knew at our homes,\nthe homes of my relatives, et cetera where the surroundings were sumptuous. So, in\nthis milieu, I kept my mouth shut because they just didn\u2019t believe me.",
        "A: Her English was not as good as mine because she grew up with French, and English,\nshe did not participate directly in the tutorials that my brother and I had in Libau, but\nshe was a voracious reader, started immediately to read the newspapers, started\nimmediately to read some of the easy novels, English novels, and picked it up, picked\nit up.",
        "A: No, she actually thought of getting a job at Radio City Music Hall because the person\nat that time, his nickname was Pipke. He was a friend of the family way back in\nLatvia. What was his name, and he was the head of the music of the orchestra in\nRadio City Music Hall. He converted \u2014_ and my aunt, I remember, telling the story\nbefore the war, and I saw Pipke in a train going from Berlin to wherever she was\ngoing, and suddenly Pipke is there with a big cross, and I said, \u201cPipke, what are you\ndoing with this cross?\u201d And, he said, \u201cWell, this and that. So on and so forth, et\ncetera, et cetera.\u201d But, my mother went to see him, and he knew that my mother\nplayed, but she said, \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t play for years. It could take me\u201d et cetera, and\nthen he said, \u201cI can offer you something for maybe thirty dollars a month in those\ndays or so. She figured because we were living on an allowance from the Joint at that\ntime, and my mother didn\u2019t want to keep on getting money from my relatives. She\nwanted to be independent and we did not \u2014 later on we found some moneys back that\nwe had in Europe, but it was a few years later. So, it was tough, but she said for thirty\ndollars, I can\u2019t make ends meet, et cetera. So, she declined, and I guess he was just as\nhappy that she declined. I assume, but he was prepared to give here \u2014 but, she had a\nvery rare cello, my mother, by name \u2014 by a man named Schweitzer who did many,\nmany cellos, but only two cellos for women, and my mother had one cello of the two\nwhich were taken by the Germans, and she got it from my grandparents when she\nbegan the music conservatory, this cello. I often claimed, and I don\u2019t know if I'll ever\nsee anything by it, but the Germans confiscated this as well, this cello.",
        "A: Yes, she actually for a while, she always loved to stitch maybe a pillow or something,\nand she was offered something if she wanted to do even at home, if she wants to do\nsome stitching on men\u2019s jackets, working piece work. So, she took this and made\nsometimes a hundred dollars a week, which was a lot of money in those days in the\nlate \u201840s, but once we started finding some of our funds back, not the major ones, et\ncetera. So, things began to be easier. The first couple of years were difficult years,\nyes.",
        "A: Then it got easier.",
        "A: Through the friends that I made in, at Utrecht, New Utrecht. It was a very heavily\nJewish group over there, quite radical, that accorded with my tastes, and I became\nvery active in betar in the Borough Park Chapter, and then the issue became whether\ntojoin___ or the Stern, and there was a tremendous discord over one issue \u2014 the\nbombing of the King David Hotel. The issue was to forewarn the British or not\nforewarn the British. insisted that 1t was right to forewarn the British even if\nthey would not take the warning seriously. As it happened in the case of the King\nDavid Hotel, but so that the innocents will not suffer. The Sternists argued that all\nBrits are our enemies, look what they\u2019re doing to us, hardly permitting any Jews to\nmigrate to Palestine, and we are not going to forewarn the Brits. And, I was so\nradicalized over the issue of Jewishness, even though I knew relatively little what it\nmeant, that I joined Stern, and there we seriously trained for all sorts of things\nincluding assassination. Interesting, before I quit Stern, that was a chapter 1n itself\nbecause I was nearly shot for it \u2014 before I quit Stern, we were going to assassinate Sir\nGladywn Jebb. Sir Gladywn Jebb at that time with a British rep at Lake Success at\n_____. Why were we going to assassinate him, like we assassinated Lloyd Moyne in\nEgypt in 1944? Assassinated Bernadotte? Because, not because he was not a nice\nperson. He was actually a very nice person, but he represented Britain, Britain\u2019s\npolicies toward the Jews in Palestine. So, he was a target, but for various reasons, I\nquit the Stern group. There was a court proceeding.",
        "A: In a sense, yes, court marshaled for quitting, so on and so forth. But \u2014 and we were\ntrained here on a farm in Jersey. Does the name Josephson mean anything to you?\nJosephson wrote the book, \u201cThe Robber Baron\u2019s\u2019\u2019, his brother, I think it was Murray,\nbrother\u2019s name, prominent Wall Street lawyer, and his wife. They let us \u2014 their estate\ngave us for basic training. We were trained by Sternists hiding here in the United\nStates. The Brits put the price 5,000 pounds in those days, for their heads, and we\nwere trained. We smuggled arms, ammunitions. We learned assassination tactics. We\nlearned all sorts of things on the estate. The FBI and together with Scotland Yard\nbegan to discover what we were doing. So, we had to empty out or __s~ what we\ncalled storage place of guns, ammunitions, in the Lower Eastside. We dumped it all in\nthe East River. Some of my colleagues were caught. I was not caught dumping some\nof the stuff in East River. But, an interesting incident happened that affected me very\ngreatly. Our headquarters was on Second Avenue, around Eleventh Street, 149\nSecond Avenue, and there wasa___ right nearby, a little sort of a synagogue which\na where students could study the _, and I went there in order to say kaddish for\nmy father, and I come in and the Rabbi said, I said to the Rabbi, \u201cCan you please help\nme? I don\u2019t know how to put on __, how to put on all the rest. I want to say\nkaddish for my father.\u201d \u201cWhat happened to your father?\u201d \u201cHe was killed during the\nwar.\u201d He said, \u201cThey were right to kill your father for not having taught you the\nJewish ways.\u201d That turned me off. I go now, Yom Kippur, once a year to say kaddish\nto a synagogue, but otherwise I don\u2019t go. It\u2019s wrong maybe because of one stupid\nRabbi having said this, but it affected me emotionally very, very much, this little\nincident. It wasn\u2019t so much a little incident.",
        "A: It was a very big incident, and it was right near our headquarters here in New York on\nSecond Avenue I remember, but the reason I decided to quit Stern because after the\nState of Israel was created, established, Stern decided not to disband, continue as an\nunderground movement. Arrogated to itself the right to kill fellow Jews, if they,\nespecially the leaders, if they did not agree to the idea of the Shtei gadot |\u2019jardein\nmeaning two sides of the Jordan, but it\u2019s the old tradition of Palestine.",
        "A: Greater Palestine, and that was can assassinate those Jews, and after having suffered\nwhat I have suffered, et cetera, kill a fellow Jew? As young as I was, I had enough\nbrain, and as uneducated as I still was, I had enough brain to say, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sit\nright.\u201d \u2014 was reason number one. Number two, after the state of Israel was declared to\nbe a sovereign state, the ideological head, somebody by the name of ___ who\nentered parliament in Israel, too at the time, took us into a Marxist-Leninist mode that\nthis is something that we should strive for, we must strive for. It is the ideal world. By\nhaving lived in a Marxist-Leninist Totalitarian System, even if I didn\u2019t understand it\nvery much, and the hush-hush talks et cetera so that I shouldn\u2019t understand, this also\ndid not sit right. So, at a certain moment, I decided to quit because the movement had\nbecome my life.",
        "A: It had where we used to clean our arms and ammunition in my apartment, in my\nroom, and my mother happened to be home and suddenly knocked at the door, and\nsaid, \u201cGeorge, may I please see you?\u201d And, I came out, and she said, \u201cWhat are you\ndoing there?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re just playing some games.\u201d \u201cAre you doing\nsomething with arms, revolvers or so?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, mother.\u201d She said, \u201cYou know,\nmy suggestion is at least close the window so the neighbors shouldn\u2019t hear what\nyou\u2019re doing.\u201d So, she knew suddenly what it was all about, and I told my mother that\nwhen I\u2019m going to be 21, I\u2019ll go to Palestine to fight. She said, \u201cWhen you\u2019ll be 21,\nwe'll talk about it, but in the meantime you must also get your education.\u201d So, I was\ncombining the two. Anyways, there was a court marshal of me in a basement on\nFifty-First Street, Thirteenth Avenue in Borough Park basement, where I was\nthreatened with my life if ever I were to give up the idea of the two sides of the\nJordan, traditional Palestine, if ever I were to approach another member of the Stern\ngroup that I knew, if ever I were to disclose anything that transpired here in the\nUnited States, and our cell structure, so on and so forth. I promised, of course, I\nwouldn\u2019t do anything of the sort, and they said, \u201cFine, these are our warnings.\u201d And,\nthis came to me as a terrible shock because the movement had become my life, and\nmy closest friends I could no longer see, spend time with, or even talk, and I\nremember traveling to Brooklyn every morning going to New Utrecht from\nManhattan because I loved Brooklyn, and from time to time I would see some on the\nsubway, my buddies, they looked away as if I was a traitor. The way the girl looked\naway when I had the star, and that affected me enormously because the movement\nwas part of my life. This withdrawal, for six months I had difficulty sleeping I\nremember, and then it went on. In the meantime, I entered college which I wasn\u2019t\nvery much interested, but the Stern group said that we had to go to City College,\nwhy? In those days, City College was excellent, because you had a special professor\nthere, Hans Cohen, the father of the study of nationalism, et cetera, and he was\nteaching there, and some other courses, but especially nationalism, what it\u2019s all about\n\u2014 implications, et cetera, et cetera. So, I took the exam and I managed to get in. It was\nan eight hour entrance exam in those days, very tough, but I managed to get in, and I\nworked at the same time to help out. I didn\u2019t want \u2014 I knew that my mother was\nstruggling even though she never said a word, et cetera. So, I wanted to make some\nmoney on the side. So, I worked in the library. I worked as a runner for a friend of\nmine, here in the jewelry district who opened a business. So, I managed some way or\nother always to earn between ten and twenty dollars a week on top of studying et\ncetera. So, but I did not have to depend on my mother\u2019s meager income. Then, I \u2014 at\nthe beginning, it didn\u2019t interest me very much, the studies, but suddenly, something\nclicked and I began to read voraciously because my mother kept on saying always,\n\u201cYou know, a man for me, is not a man without an education.\u201d And would say to me,\n\u201cHow can one really live a life without reading a good book.\u201d The literature Pushkin,\nLermantov, Thomas Mann et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is part of life.\u201d Because\nthey used to discuss it at dinner tables as a child. It didn\u2019t interest me. Characters,\nwho cared? The character\u2019s in a book. Ideas were ridiculous. But, suddenly,\nsomething snapped, and I couldn\u2019t stop reading, and I began to read a lot, day and\nnight, and what interested me particularly was a history of World War II, and one\nthing led to the other, led also to literature, led to philosophy, led to even an interest\nin the sciences. For a while, I thought of studying medicine. I met a young woman\nwho was going to study medicine. Her father was a doctor. She was interested in\nmedicine. So, I figured I would also take some courses, and I took courses along\nthose lines, but I reacted very poorly to formaldehyde. Pus developed under my eyes\nand we had to dissect pigs and rats, and from all the formaldehyde, I began to get\nrashes here on the side. So, I really had trouble, not that medicine interested me, but I\ndecided to have something in common with the woman that I thought I fancied. But,\nso much the better that I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Well, first, yes, Political Theory because I majored originally in history, then Political\nScience, and then PhD, actually PhD in Political Science because I had majored in\nHistory and I always felt when I became already sort of semi-educated that you can\u2019t\nbe a good Political Scientist without a thorough knowledge of History especially the\nWestern Tradition from Antiquity to the Present, and you could not be a good\nhistorian, without an understanding of political relations between and among states,\nand international relations, so on and so forth.",
        "A: She unfortunately didn\u2019t live to see that I got because my first PhD was rejected as a\ndissertation, which subsequently was published and is now cited all over the world,\nand opened up an entirely new field of study in the English speaking world. So, I had\nto write a second dissertation, and that hurts me very, very much that my mother did\nnot see the success subsequently. The second PhD got me into foreign policy.",
        "A: American Foreign Policy with the late Hans Morgenthau. So, and which I have been\nnow President for the last twelve or thirteen years, but I was one of the founders, yes.",
        "A: Sixty-four yes, a Latvian Jewish girl who lived in Sweden during the war. Her maiden\nname was , a prominent Jew in Sweden, head of the Well Jewish Congress in\nSweden, who opened negations with Himler, and as a result was able to rescue\nJews from Concentration Camp . You know the story, and then made\nsome deals with Himler over not blowing up camps in the west, especially\nwhich was successful negotiations. So, he made a contribution to\nhistory, especially Jewish history, no question about it.",
        "A: Triplets, triplet sons. We had a fourth one that unfortunately didn\u2019t make it. So, yes,\nand they\u2019re all thank God, healthy and successful. So, I really can\u2019t complain. I count\nmy blessings.",
