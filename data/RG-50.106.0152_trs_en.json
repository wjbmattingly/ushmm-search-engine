        "Question: This is United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Halina Peabody, conducted by Esther Finder, on June 3, 2002, in\nRockville, Maryland. This interview is part of the museum\u2019s project to interview\nHolocaust survivors and witnesses who are also volunteers with the museum. This\nis a follow-up interview that will focus on Halina Peabody\u2019s post-Holocaust\nexperiences. In preparation for this interview, I listened to the interview conducted\nwith the Survivor\u2019s of the Shoah Visual History Foundation on October 25\", 1996.\nI will not ask you to repeat everything you said in that interview. Instead, I will use\nthis interview as an opportunity to follow up on that interview and focus on your\npost-Holocaust experiences. This is tape number one, side A. What was your name\nat birth?",
        "Answer: Halina Janna Litman, L-i-t-m-a-n.",
        "Q: And when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Krak\u00e9w on December 12\", 1932.",
        "Q: Were you known by any other names during the war?",
        "A: Yes, I had to assume a name, a Catholic name by the name of Halina Litinska.",
        "Q: And how old were you at the end of the war?",
        "A: I was 13.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "Q: What can you tell me about the day that you realized that you were no longer\nunder Nazi control?",
        "A: That day was a very difficult day in our lives because my mother, who was\nworking for the German army, got up in the morning and thought -- it was very\nquiet out there, we were -- we knew that the -- the Russians were coming closer. We\ndidn\u2019t know where they were and the quiet was just eerie. And she didn\u2019t know\nwhether to go to -- to her job or not. And we were standing talking about it and\nsuddenly a hand grenade split over the -- the house, which I didn\u2019t know at the time,\nand I s -- hit my hand. I didn\u2019t know what happened, I started screaming like\nMother, Mother, my hand. And she realized that I was wounded, and everything\nwent black, we didn\u2019t know what was happening. The house sort of was coming\ndown. And she grabbed my sister, who was only a few years old, and took her in the\narms and grabbed me by the hand and we got out of the house. And my hand was\nbleeding and there was not a soul in the street. She tried to get somebody to pick us\nup, but nobody would. So I just had to hold her hand and we walked to the hospital,\nwhich was at the end of the street. At that time somebody came out of the hospital,\npicked me up and dragged me off -- took me to the hospital. And -- where they\nexamined my hand. My thumb was cut off, was hanging on a piece of skin, and my\nlittle finger was ha -- half cut. My inside of the hand was a complete mess, it was\nJune 3, 2002\njust completely open. And they -- there was no penicillin, so they had to sort of\nclean it as best as they could. They told my mother my ha -- my arm might have to\nbe cut off because of the infection that they expected. And they just put us all up in\none bed in the hospital. So that was my day of liberation.",
        "Q: When was this? Do you happen to know the date?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but it was spring or summer because we -- it was warm. We\nwalked on the streets and I remember the sun was shining.",
        "Q: Was this 1945?",
        "A: I believe it was.",
        "Q: And where were you?",
        "A: We were in Jaroslaw, which is not too far from Krakow, which is not our\nhometown, but where we went as Catholics because nobody knew us there and it\nwas sort of on the way to Krakow. I guess my mother was trying to be close, but\nnot too close, in case she needed to look up somebody, or -- I don\u2019t know why,\nreally, but that\u2019s where we -- we spent the war.",
        "Q: Can you tell me the names of your mother and your sister and how old your\nsister was?\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Olga. My sister\u2019s name was Eva, which she kept even\nas a Catholic. And she was born in June 30, 1939. So she must have been like\nalmost six years old.",
        "Q: Who were your liberators?",
        "A: Well, they had to have been Russian, which my mother referred to as not\nliberators, but occupiers, again. But at least they weren't killing us any more.\nAlthough there was a pogrom she told me, and she refused to let me speak my\nname. I still had to use the Catholic name because she said they\u2019re going to kill us.",
        "Q: Did you see any other Jewish survivors at the end of the war?",
        "A: Not at that point. Not -- not til much later.",
        "Q: What did being free of the Germans mean to you?",
        "A: Well, it meant a great frustration because I wanted to say who I was and I\ncouldn\u2019t. And there I was with my hand in a -- on the -- on the railing for two\nmonths, and my mother in the meantime -- well, they had to put it on a rail because\nthey -- the hand was -- was going to grow in such a way that I wouldn\u2019t be able to\nstraighten it. It -- it -- it bent like that. If you -- if -- the nuns really saved my hand,\nbecause they kept on stretching and stretching. And my mother, in the meantime,\nwas diagnosed with cancer. And so -- they didn\u2019t -- they weren\u2019t even sure a\nhundred percent if it was cancer, but there was a lump. And they felt that, you\nJune 3, 2002\nknow, they didn\u2019t want us to be orphans, they said, and they told me to go and\nconvince her to have the -- the breast off. So on top of everything else, she had to\nhave her breast off and she had this operation. And we discovered that the lady with\nwhom we had been living during the war was killed by the same hand grenade that -\n- that hit me. So we had no -- no room, no place to go, although the neighbor next\ndoor took us in. So my mother spent th-the -- sort of the d-days before she got the\noperation between the hospital and home and with my sister. And then after she was\noperated on, she was also in the hospital. I guess my sister was with the lady\nsometime and sometimes with us in the hospital.",
        "Q: Were you a witness to any acts of retaliation or retribution against people who\nhad helped the Nazis?",
        "A: Not personally, but when we already lived in London, we had a couple living in\nthe house, we used to rent out hou -- rooms. And one of the guys was all broken up\nand beaten up and my father said that it was because he was a collaborator, that he -\n- he got beaten up. But not of my own eyes or experience.",
        "Q: Did you yourself, even though you were a child, want revenge?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what I wanted. I was too miserable and too weak to think about\nanything. My hand was occupying my -- my thoughts. Re-Reuniting with my father\nafter so many years and not knowing him and not knowing, you know, how to\nJune 3, 2002\nbehave. It was a strange world all of a sudden. I really didn\u2019t think about it, I\nremember Mother saying that no matter what they will -- what kind of sentences\nthey\u2019ll give the Germans is not enough and there is just no kind of punishment that\ncould punish them for what they\u2019ve done.",
        "Q: You mentioned a reunion with your father. Did that come immediately after the\nwar?",
        "A: No. After the war we knew he was alive because my mother got a Red Cross\ntelegram. That is, she didn't get it directly, the people who never survived to tell us\nanything about what went on, but were killed by the Germans, sent us a letter that\nthere was a communication from my father through the Red Cross that he was alive\nin Palestine with his sister. So we knew he was alive. We had no idea where\nexactly he was, but after the war there were announcements all over the place, and\nmy mother put announcements in the radio. And they found him in Palestine. And\nthat\u2019s why he contacted us. He sent my cousin, his nephew who was in the British\narmy in Palestine to Poland to get us out and to put us in touch with the Jewish\nagency, and that\u2019s how we reunited. We reunited with him somewhere near\nMunich, after we crossed the Brenner Pass. He came to get us.",
        "Q: Do you know when that was?\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure, but 1t was somewhere -- probably before April 1946. Probably\nMarch. March, April \u201946 because by April I was 1n the -- in -- in the DP camp in --\nin Italy, and I know he didn\u2019t stay very long because he had to report back to the\narmy.",
        "Q: What was he doing in the army\u201d?",
        "A: Well, he was part of the General Anders, the Polish army that fought along with\nthe British army against the Germans. And apparently Stalin made this agreement\nat Yalta that they would let out the prisoners, all the prisoners out. However, he\ntells us that he had to run away and -- and found -- find a way to get out with the\nPolish army. He was in Siberia.",
        "Q: Did you make any attempts to find other relatives or friends?",
        "A: Yes, we did. My mother went to Krak\u00e9w and found that there was no sign of\nour grandparents. We did find that my uncle, my father\u2019s brother survived\nAuschwitz. And we kept missing him. We kept trying to find him and we didn\u2019t\nknow where he was exactly, but we knew he was alive. He lost his wife and\ndaughter, who was exactly my age. And he was the only one that survived in\nPoland. The others -- whoever -- whoever else was in Poland did not survive, in\nmy family, but my aunt, uncle and cousin who were taken to Russia, to Siberia,\nJune 3, 2002\nalso survived. My uncle died in [indecipherable] on the way out already of Russia,\nbut my aunt and cousin lived in England with us afterwards.",
        "Q: Did you go back to your pre-war home?",
        "A: I could not. It\u2019s in Russia -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s in Ukraine now, it\u2019s in Zaleszezyki,\nwhich is on the frontier of Romania. At the time, it was Poland. Now it\u2019s Ukraine\nand they tell me it\u2019s much too dangerous. They still would like to kill us all.",
        "Q: When did you realize the full extent of the genocide? When did -- you know, it --\nwhen did it all come together for you?",
        "A: Strangely enough it came to me when I was watching \u201cWorld at War\u201d with\nLawrence Olivier. I had never really thought about it. I guess I was too young and\ntoo concentrated on my own problems. But when I saw that program, it struck me\nand it really hit me very, very hard.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: I think I was already -- I don\u2019t know, it has to be in England, or maybe even in\nthe States. It was a -- much, much later.",
        "Q: After your liberation, when you st-started moving to different places, did you\nhave much contact with other survivors?",
        "A: Personally, no. My mother went to Krakow and tried to track, as I said,\neverybody down. There was no room for us in Krakow, so she found a -- a small\nJune 3, 2002\nplace to live in, very close to one of the village near Krakow. Again they asked her\ndirectly if she was Polish, meaning was she Jewish and she had to say she was\nPolish. So again we were under the assumed names, and again we had to cover up. I\nwent to school there. It was very strange, I was the only one who could read and\nwrite. And my mother went to the Jewish agency, and strangely enough, I don\u2019t\nknow why it is, but she only registered herself as being alive, never put the children\ndown. They were very surprised that she had two children, that she managed to\nsurvive with two children. I never went to the Jewish com -- agency, as far as I\nremember, I think she went by herself, but I may have forgotten. Very -- something\nvery strange happened there because an old friend of hers who was remarried to a\nCatholic man and had big cross on her breast, said to her that my hand happened\nbecause I became a Catholic without being baptized. I\u2019ve never -- never forgotten\nthat, my mother was absolutely infuriated and sort of stuck in my mind that some of\nus were not perfect.",
        "Q: How long was it before you were able to -- to freely admit that you were really\nJewish, and use your own name?",
        "A: Well, it was when we manage -- when we finally got into the Jewish agency\ngroups and everybody was Jewish. However, there was another little wrinkle. They\nthought we were not Jewish and they tried to say that my mother was trying to get\nJune 3, 2002\nout of Poland under the guise of being Jewish and that she really wasn't, and we\nwere not. So she had to try to convince them that she really was Jewish. And there\nwe were, you know, trying to convince them we are Jewish. And finally -- all she\nwould say was that my -- her husband\u2019s name was Isaac. And finally some people\nwho knew us from Krakow did sign that -- sign off on us, that we were legitimate.",
        "Q: You said you were with the Jewish agency groups. Where were you exactly?\nCan you clarify that?",
        "A: Yes, we were in sort of group homes, they -- they had us in groups and they were\ngoing to transport us out one -- one group at a time. It was somewhere near\nKrakow, I -- I don\u2019t know, 1s closer to the German border. And what happens was -\n- was that they took one group after a time, they took pregnant and old -- elderly\npeople first. The Russians had a sort of agreement that they would let us through,\nbut they liked to be paid on the border, so they always had prepared money and\nthere was a Polish guy, then a Russian guy, then they kind of closed their eyes to us,\nbut -- but you had to still pay your way through. The first lorry that went out got\ncaught, and apparently they were put back into some other camp and then they were\nlet go. They didn\u2019t really want to keep us, but the second one went through and the\nproblem was that before we got onto the truck, they attacked us at night, the Polish\nmilitia. And they wanted t-to -- to probably rape an-and steal from us, I don\u2019t know.\nJune 3, 2002\nWe had to stand there and scream on top of our lungs in order for them to go away.\nWe were lucky that they in -- in the end they went. In the morning they turned up\nand said, oh, what was the problem, we heard there were noises. But we knew\nexactly what it was, so we were just looking forward to getting out. It was a very\nstrange, very strange time. Strange time. The last -- the -- when we ca -- got out, we\n-- they put us out wha -- three kilometers past the frontier. Once my mother gave up\nher watch because the Russians wanted watches in addition to whatever they got.\nAnd then another guy gave his watch up. So we got through and then the German\nrefused to sell us tickets. We were supposed to buy tickets in the train and then get\nto Berlin on our own accord. And the leaders went to buy tickets and the Germans\ndidn\u2019t want to sell them to us because we were Jews. I don\u2019t know what they did in\nthe end, but we did get on the train and we did get to Berlin. We were in the\nRussian sector first and they tried to also establish that we were Jewish. They took\ntwo or three people and had them sign their name in Hebrew. And the -- then they\ncame back and it was okay. We went from there to the British section and then to\nthe American section, we were kind of carted around. And in the end they sent us\non to DP camp in Italy.",
        "Q: Do you remember the name of the DP camp?\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: Yes, it was -- there were two near Ancona, there was Trani and Barletta. And\nwe did not spend much time there, but have quite nice memories. I remember the\nmusic. And well, I -- as I said, we were young and we wanted -- we were happy to\nbe alive. It was a -- it was a better time. The weather was beautiful, we had food,\nand my father told them explicitly to keep us there as long as possible, to have us\nrecover in the nice weather and the good food. My father, who was a dentist, had\nprivilege in the hospital there and so we used to go and have our meals at the\nhospital. My mother taught us to swim there in the -- in the gorgeous sea, you\nknow, and we had a very pleasant time. The food was marvelous, the -- the -- the\ncherries particularly, just absolutely wonderful. And the ice cream, I\u2019ve never tasted\n-- maybe because it was after the war and we were so hungry, but never tasted\nanything like it. And it was -- it was very pleasant pastime. Unfortunately, because\nmy father asked them to send us late -- last, they sent us first to England, because\nwe chose -- my father and my mother decided that out of the choices, Palestine or\nEngland, we should go to England. So they sent us 1n a very cold time to England.\nIt was not -- not a very happy experience to begin with.",
        "Q: Stay with me for just a minute in the DP camp. Can you tell me a little bit about\nthe conditions there with respect to housing and work and education opportunities.\nCan you talk a little bit about that?\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: We were there only two months, and we -- we were just there, I think, for\nsleeping, because we spent most of that time in the hos -- near the hospital and --\nand on the beach. We didn\u2019t have much education, no there was no education, I\nmean, there was nothing going on. At the time it was not organized for that yet.\nVery early, I think.",
        "Q: Do you know when?",
        "A: I don\u2019t, I\u2019m afraid. But as I said, I found that we were there in 19 -- in -- in April\n1946, so that -- that\u2019s the date that I have because I found some document that states\nApril \u201946, we were there.",
        "Q: Did you have any trouble letting go of some of the behaviors you had to use to\nsurvive during the war, like you know, did you have any trouble with your name or\nwith anything else?",
        "A: I didn't have any na -- trouble with my name. I do remember when we first found\nFather and we -- he ha -- he brought a -- a chauffeur and a Mercedes and we\ntraveled through -- through part of Italy and at one point we got off and went into\nsome side -- side -- what do they call it, the gardens. And we found these beautiful\nred cherries and we picked up some and we came -- came to -- back to the car and\nhe almost killed us. I mean, he was furious. He told us no more stealing. We were\nJune 3, 2002\nso used to do that during the war in order to survive. So that stands out in my mind.\nWhat was the other question?",
        "Q: Do you have any trouble, you know, just identifying yourself as a Jew at this\npoint?",
        "A: No, not I, but my sister. My sister, who did not know she was Jewish, because\nwe couldn\u2019t tell her, she was too young. When my cousin from Palestine came,\neven though he didn\u2019t look that Jewish, she immediately recognized that he had a\nlong nose, and she said, Arayed, you\u2019re Jewish, but you\u2019re nice. And he said, but\nyou\u2019re Jewish too. And she said absolutely not. She would not believe him. And it\ntook her quite awhile before she accepted it, but I had no trouble, no. I just kept\ngoing to church, though. I was so used to it, I kept going to church until they\nstopped me.",
        "Q: What did going to church give you?",
        "A: Oh, just being with friends on Sunday. I mean, that was the only recreation we\nhad during the war, you know, the only time that you dressed a little bit, whatever\nyou had and it was a social occasion, so it was very hard to -- you know, not to do\nit. Everybody else was Catholic. Most of the people we were with was -- are, you\nknow, officer\u2019s families. So that was something that I -- I missed.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "Q: Can you remember the very first time after the war that you felt free enough to\nadmit that you\u2019re a Jew to somebody in public?",
        "A: Not until we left Poland. Not in Poland, but once we left Poland, then yes. And\nI was very -- I was very happy about be-being able to admit it, but I wasn\u2019t proud of\nit until I lived in Israel.",
        "Q: What steps did you and your family take to rebuild your life? For example, were\nyou able to get any rehabilitation for your hand?",
        "A: There was no such thing as rehabilitation for anything in those days as far as I\nknow. What I did get was some help from the teachers, who tried to accommodate\nmy -- both the lack of no -- knowing English and my lack of thumb, to do subjects\nthat would make it easier for me. And that\u2019s why they immediately switched me to\ncommercial subjects like shorthand, which meant that I didn\u2019t have to spell, and\ntyping, which means I learned how to spell by copying. And then also arranged for\nme -- showed me how to use my fingers so that I wouldn\u2019t need the thumb or the\nlittle finger, so that I could type. And I did type over a hundred words a minute at\none point, so I -- I did pretty well on that. And I also found that I could knit, which I\ncould before the war, before I lost my thumb. And whatever I could do before,\nincluding even cutting my cuticles, I found I could do. At one point they decided\nthey wanted to help me and they got me to a doctor and the doctor was going to try\nJune 3, 2002\nto do something with my hand, they wanted to adjust my -- one of my fingers so\nthat I could use it as a thumb. I don\u2019t know, it was -- it was a very difficult situation.\nMy mother didn\u2019t know what to tell me cause she was in such pain about this, and\nw -- I ended up being in the hospital and already the -- getting the first shot before\nthe anesthesia and I said no, I don\u2019t want to do it, and I just got out. And I said I --\nyou know, I just got off the bed and -- and thanked them and -- and never tried that\none again. I felt that it was just too difficult and I\u2019m glad I did because my instinct\njust told me not to. But other than that my rehabilitation was mainly my own doing.\nThe other thing I did was play table tennis, which meant that I was easier with the\ncompany I was in. I liked the company of boys, which was easier [indecipherable]\nto play table tennis. And plus, when you play a -- a sport like table tennis or any\nother sport, you have no time to think of your hand. You know, I used to stand with\nmy hand in the back so that it doesn\u2019t show. But when you play, you know, you\nhave to serve, you have to put your ball up and -- and you -- you have to look at the\nball, so you don\u2019t have time for the hand. And that, I think, is my cure. That was my\ncure.",
        "Q: Where were you that they were teaching you English?",
        "A: I was in England. Yeah, my father, as I said, decided to go to England, and\nafter spending about a year in Liverpool in a camp, we -- also they taught -- tried to\nJune 3, 2002\nteach us English there. They taught us and -- and I was sent to a school in\nUlverston, which was a little way away -- away, and I was surprised how well I\nwas doing until I learned it was a technical school. But anyway, my English started\ngetting slowly better, you know, you\u2019re like -- 13 and a half I was by then. My sister\nhad no problem whatsoever, but I had troubles. I was reading Polish books and\nknitting in school, but they didn\u2019t mind. They let me -- they let me do what I needed\nto and I did math. So that\u2019s how I started learning English.",
        "Q: You mentioned a camp in Liverpool, can you elaborate?|",
        "A: I -- it was a military -- I mean, it was for m -- for officer\u2019s families. The English\nwere very nice to us, but it was such a hard time at the time because they were so\nworn out themselves that r-rationed food was very scarce. They gave us what they\ngave to th -- to their own, but 1t was -- we were always hungry. And, as I said, we\nhad heating only a -- a couple of hours a day. We were in barracks, you know, it\nwas beds, stacked beds, and did our best that we could. We go to Liverpool with\nour ration cards and get some bit of clothing here and there, but mainly we lived on\nkippers, because you know, we were hungry for meat and meat was very scarce. So\nthe kippers were the only ones that you could get without rationing. I don\u2019t think\nI\u2019ve ever seen a kipper since, because I can\u2019t stand it. But mainly that\u2019s wh-what we\nate as -- as protein.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "Q: During that period of time, were you aware of the events that were unfolding in\nPalestine?",
        "A: No, not at all. I -- | hardly knew what Palestine was all about. I had very little\nknowledge about that. It was not until they declared the state of Israel that I\nremember my father coming in with absolutely shining eyes and saying, we have a\ncountry. And that was when I really paid attention.",
        "Q: Did you follow the Nuremberg Trials?",
        "A: Not really. I guess I was too busy with my own problems again, but I remember\nmy mother tell -- saying that there was no punishment that she could think of that\nwould be enough for them, so there was a lot anger. But as I said, I -- I was too busy\nwith doing other things and I was just too young to -- to think about it.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in England?",
        "A: Some. Not very overt, but P\u2019ll never forget when I applied for a job at the\nautomobile association in London. The personnel officer asked me what religion I\nwas, she said I didn\u2019t have to say. But I wanted to, at that time I felt I needed to say\nwho I was, so I said Jewish. And she said to me, we don\u2019t ma -- mind Jews, but you\ncan\u2019t have Jewish holidays off. And I was so stung by it. Now, I\u2019m not religious,\nbut it stung me, I\u2019ve never forgotten it. I did get the job. I did very well there, too,\nbut I\u2019ve never forgotten that.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "Q: Did the people in England ask you about your wartime experiences? And if they\ndid, what did you tell them?",
        "A: Not really. Not -- people were not very interested. There were a lot of refugees\nand nobody was really curious about u -- me as far as I knew. They were very\nhelpful. The English are very -- how can I put it? They don\u2019t -- they don\u2019t question\nyou, they don\u2019t ask you things like that. They were very quiet about it and they\nknew, but they didn't really know. But they didn\u2019t want to. So they were very nice,\nas I said, they put themselves out, they tried to help me in school. They gave me\nsecondhand clothing which they said would be for somebody in the camp, which\nthey meant for me. But other than that, no.",

        "Q: -- the interview with Halina Peabody. This is tape number one, side B. And I\nwas asking you about your time in England and you said that this -- the British\ndidn\u2019t ask you much about your wartime experiences. Did anybody ask you about\nyour hand?\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: Not really, they didn\u2019t. They were too polite. The British are like that. They just\ndon\u2019t ask you. But as I said, they were very nice and helped me a lot in other ways,\nbut never asked me anything about my hand.",
        "Q: Were you happy there?",
        "A: No. No, I was very miserable. Look, I didn\u2019t know the language, I had my hand\nto cover up all the time. That was before I was playing table tennis, and it -- it was a\nmiserable time. The weather is miserable in England. It was cold, I was always\ncold, and rainy. I didn\u2019t have enough clothes really and it was hard getting used to\nbeing a family with Father again. We were so used to being with just Mother and\nplus, during the war I was the -- the s -- the second partner, you know, and then\nafter the war I was a child again. It was very uncomfortable. And we struggled,\nbecause when they decided to come to London, we bought a house. The way you\nbought a house that time, all the refugees wanted a house to have roots, but you\nlived in a -- one level and you rented out the rooms at the top so that you could pay\nthe mortgage. So it was a hard life. And my mother didn\u2019t realize that by law I had\nto go to school, so before we came to London, she and my sister went first to look\nfor the house and she broke down in one of the schools because they said that they\nhad no room for me. And -- and th-the director took pity on her and said he s -- he\u2019Il\nsend her to another school in Fulham, which is southwest London, where they did\nJune 3, 2002\naccept me. It was a very nice -- it was actually a girls\u2019 school. And the\nheadmistress, Dr. Toms, I\u20191l never forget. She was a very -- very lovely lady. And\nso they accepted me there, but when they moved to the house -- when we went to\n[indecipherable] London, she insisted I continue going to s -- to Fulham, which\nmeant about an hour on the underground every day, cause she was so afraid that\nthey -- I wouldn\u2019t get education. So it was a hard time. I liked school, and they\nweren't having any -- any excuses there, you know. I said I didn\u2019t know enough\nEnglish to do my homework and they said never mind, just keep trying. So I ended\nup really doing just as well as any other, and as I said, because I was on commercial\nsubjects, I did pretty well. In fact, I did -- I think I was one of the first pupils in -- in\nschool that passed the shorthand test. So I was happy in that, from that point of\nview, but living at home was difficult. We -- as I said, we struggled every week,\nthere was not enough money for anything. My father was able to practice dentistry\nin -- in the army, but not in England. He wasn\u2019t -- his -- his education wasn\u2019t a-a-\napparently sufficient, so he was a difficult situation too. So it was not -- not an easy\ntime at all. My mother was miserable. She felt very much an incomplete person\nbecause of her operation for cancer. And she was very, very unhappy and that made\nme unhappy because, you know, I loved my mother very much. I did realize what\nJune 3, 2002\nshe did for us during the war, I mean, she just absolutely used up every inch of her\nstrength and I think she didn't have much strength left in her to fight.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in England?",
        "A: About 11 years. I stayed from when we arrived to 1957 and my mother died in\n1954 and -- \u00b053 - \u201954 -- 1953 was the first time that I went to Israel for the\nMaccabiah with my table tennis. I joined the Maccabee club in London and\nbecame very good at it and we represented England in the Maccabiah games. That\nwas the happiest trip in time I\u2019ve ever had, I -- you know the ship, the old, old ship\nthat was horrible, that was such -- I had such a wonderful time and we stood on the\n-- on the ship all night coming through to Haifa and Ill never forget that\nexperience. So in 1953 was my first trip to Israel. And unfortunately my mother\ncame down with cancer when I got back and in 1957, I left England for good, but\nuntil then I lived in England.",
        "Q: And where did you go when you left England?",
        "A: To Israel, to the second Maccabiah, where there was some family. We had the\nfamily that emigrated to -- to Palestine in 1932, my father\u2019s sister and her four\nchildren. There were just grandchildren there by then already, and I had friends. The\none couple that survived that we knew from before the war in Haifa. And I had the\nmost wonderful time there. And there was another woman who was my age, whose\nJune 3, 2002\nparents knew my parents. And we were in touch, so I had friends in both Haifa and\nTel Aviv, and it -- I felt so much at home. I mean, it was just wonderful.",
        "Q: When you moved to Israel, what were your expectations as to what you would\ndo there?",
        "A: I was hoping to get a job, just to be able to stay and that was my primary\nconcern, and I knew I couldn\u2019t just stay with my friends forever, and my aunt, so I\nstart looking for a job. And because I spoke and -- and -- and was educated in\nEngland, I found a job in Haifa, which was near Haifa, actually. Haifa refineries,\nwhich belonged to British petroleum, and they grabbed me because I was British\neducated. So I had no problem and I got into a -- a hostel, there were lovely youth\nhostels there. And started working there and lived there for many years, until they\nsold the refineries. And then they tried to teach us Hebrew, I didn\u2019t do very well. I\ndid speak, but I didn\u2019t write or read and I couldn\u2019t work in the language. So I started\nlooking in Tel Aviv, and I had two offers. One was from the Wisotsky tea; they\nwould have taught me better Hebrew, and then there was the American embassy in\nTel Aviv, and that was more glamorous. Even though the-they offered a lower\nsalary, I decided that that was the place for me. So I took the job at the American\nembassy and moved to Tel Aviv.",
        "Q: And what was your social life like?\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: Well, my social life was -- was good. I had lots of different boyfriends and I was\ntrying very hard to settle down, but it wasn\u2019t easy. Never easy. I was not so young\nany more, I was in my late 20\u2019s. For me I thought that was very late. I missed my\nboat. So I -- I had some friends in Haifa and lots of girlfriends, that was easy. And\nwe had a good time. And -- and then in the embassy there was some very interesting\nand attractive young men, so that\u2019s how my social life was pretty good there.",
        "Q: Did the Israelis ask you about your wartime experiences, and -- and what did you\ntell them?",
        "A: Not really. I don\u2019t recall them. I tried to tell them about my hand, I was always\nwarning people about my hand because I was still at the point where I thought I had\nto warn them so that people wouldn\u2019t get a shock. And I remember one young man\nwho tried to grab my hand, and I said don\u2019t, you\u2019Il be sorry. And he insisted and\nthen I could see him going absolutely stiff and -- and -- and -- and surprised. And\nthat was a terrible experience. And so I -- I tried to warn people about that, but not -\n- not -- about the rest of the experiences, nobody really wanted to know. They all be\n-- they were busy themselves, you know, building up the country and my family\nwould not speak any Polish, they said that that was not the language that they\nwanted to use. And so we spoke English actually [indecipherable] until I learned\nenough Hebrew to speak with them.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "Q: Did you get a sense from the Israelis that you socialized with and spent time with\nof what their reaction to the Holocaust was? Did they ever speak about that with\nyou?",
        "A: Not then, but later on I\u2019ve heard remarks like, you know, we got to get on with\nour lives, you know, this was then, this is now, we\u2019ve got a new fight on our hands.\nThey really didn't want to get involved. Of course, the Eichmann trial came\nafterwards and that really became a big, big thing in Israel and a lot of people --\nwell, a lot of people fainted, a lot of people had heart attacks, because it all brought\nit back and there were witnesses that had to appear. And I remember then that there\nwas some more interest in it, and most of the people didn't want to know, tried not\nto think about it, but you could not help it, it just floated back and flooded you with\nmemories.",
        "Q: Did you ever serve in the army or were you ever asked to serve?",
        "A: I was about to be asked and then I got married. So as a married person I did not\nhave to go into the army. I have a feeling that if had gone, because of my hand I\nwould not have been on the front lines anyway, but I was afraid. I didn\u2019t want to go\ninto the army. I didn\u2019t get married for that reason, but I did -- I did li -- like the idea\nnot having to go into the army.",
        "Q: So tell me about getting married and who you married.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: Well, I married a guy who worked for the U.S. Information Agency, and who\nwas Bulgarian and was very, very -- how can I put it? Very important in the USIS,\nhe was the head of the local people and he did a very good job, spoke beautiful\nEnglish, so I had no problem, but he was a Sephardic Jew. So that was a little\nproblem for my family, they didn't like the idea very much, but well it was, as I\nsaid, it was a different time in -- in everybody\u2019s life and everybody was mingling by\nthen. And his mother was very, very lovely, I remember that. And his father was a\nlittle bit strange, was very autocratic. I didn\u2019t like that, but I wasn\u2019t marrying the\nfamily. And I met him at the embassy and we got married at the em -- well,\nactually, at the embassy.",
        "Q: When you think back on your time in Israel, what come to mind?",
        "A: It comes -- what comes to mind in mainly that I loved Israel and I still do. It\u2019s\nmy place, it\u2019s my country and even though I don\u2019t live there, it\u2019s the most important\nthing in my life is that Israel survives. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m so proud of, and \u2019'm\n-- I\u2019m just so worried about all the time, and there\u2019s always been problems there, as\nyou know. So it\u2019s so difficult to now accept the fact that we\u2019re still again at war,\nand more and more killings and more killings and I feel haunted -- ho-hounded. It\u2019s\nlike it\u2019s never ends. I was just go -- getting over the Holocaust and here we are\nagain, another Holocaust. And it\u2019s frightening what\u2019s written in the papers, that they\nJune 3, 2002\nwant to demolish us again and that the Arabs are against us and that we may not\nsurvive. I just hope not to live that long to see that. But I do believe it will survive,\nand I think that the spirit of the people and the strength of Israel is such that there\u2019s\njust no way that they can finish them off.",
        "Q: When did you leave Israel and why?",
        "A: I left Israel in 1968, and the reason for that was that my husband was, as I said\nin the U.S. Information Agency, and he wanted, for his own career development,\nwanted to go and expand a little. Israel is a small country. He felt that in his\nprofession, he needed a little more air. So we thought we\u2019d come for a year, at least\nthat was the plan. We rented our apartment and came with the best hope. He also\nwanted to go to school if possible, and I was supposed to go to work. My son was\nthen five and a half, so he was going to go to kindergarten. And that\u2019s how we\nplanned it. We got to Washington, but by the time we got to Washington he got an\noffer from the Hoover Institute, which is near Stamford University in California.\nSo in the end we went out to Palo Alto and that\u2019s where we spent two and a half\nyears and -- and he actually did some very good work at the Hoover Institute. He\nwas the first Israeli to work there and the local Jewish community was very nice to\nus and very interested in what we were about and wanted to know more about us.\nThis was part of the Jewish community that was never very much involved with\nJune 3, 2002\nIsrael and that was a time that they suddenly awa -- awoke to the fact that Israel\nwas something that would be of interest to them. And so we had a very, very nice\nsocial life there. And he did very well. He did very well, but then he changed, he\nwent to work for San Francisco Examiner, and after awhile he felt that the only\nway to complete his rise in the -- in the profession, he had to come east. So that\u2019s --\nafter two and a half years we moved back to Washington and he went to work for\nVoice of America.",
        "Q: You said your husband was from Bulgaria, is he also a survivor?",
        "A: Yes, but Bulgarian Jewry was not killed, only -- only the other areas, I think the -\n- the Bulgaria proper, the king would not let anybody be killed. They put them in\ncamps, they told them to give up all their goods, gold, silver, money, whatever,\nproperty. But they never killed anybody. And so they survived as a -- as a\ncommunity and the whole community after the war, immigrated to Israel.",
        "Q: Can you tell me your husband\u2019s name and also your son\u2019s name?",
        "A: My husband\u2019s name is Norbert Yasharoff, and I have two sons. One is Dov\nYasharoff and one is Joe, or Yosi Yasharoff.",
        "Q: Before you came to the United States, what were your expectations of\nAmerica?\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: Well, I was a little worried. I was happy that they spoke English. I thought they\nwere supposed to speak English anyway. It didn\u2019t turn out completely correct, but --\nand I was a little concerned, I -- you know, it -- I heard about the United States for\nthe first time in more detail when I worked for the American embassy where I also\nworked. I forgot to tell you. Oh yes, I did tell you. And it was frightening, was a\nlong way away. It was a long, long way away and I thought that 1t was going to be\nstrange, but I saw the Hollywood films and I thought that couldn\u2019t be like that.\nTurned out it was, almost, you know, and people had three cars in the family, I\nthought they were lying, but that\u2019s how it 1s, they do. We do. And the thing that\nstruck me about the United States was how beautiful it was. And they never --\nAmericans who travel abroad never tell you how beautiful America is, they just\ncomplain. And the vastness of it. Th-The -- the size, th-the width and th-the breadth\nof it, 1t\u2019s just amazing because we come from Europe, small countries, you know,\nyou go for a few ki-kilometers and you\u2019re at the border of one country and another\ncountry. And in the States you can travel for days and days and days and you can\nstill be in the same country. And also the fact that whether it\u2019s pal -- Palo Alto or\nWashington, you can go to a store and get the same product, which is -- as I said, it\nwas kind of strange for me, I d -- not -- not expected that. Life was very nice, all the\nmachines that I never would have thought of. Never dreamt I would have a car, that\nJune 3, 2002\nmy most valued possession. And altogether the Americans are much nicer than the\nBritish, they\u2019re much friendlier. And it\u2019s easy to make yourself a little niche and to\nlive happily in your corner. It\u2019s true there\u2019s a lot of other problems in the States, but\nyou don\u2019t have to be involved. In the smaller country I think you -- you -- you --\nwilly nilly you\u2019ve got to be involved. But in the United States, you live in beautiful\nBethesda or beautiful Palo Alto and you can forget about the other parts. Not nice\nmaybe, but after what we\u2019ve been through we felt very -- I felt very relieved and --\nand I needed the rest from all the problems. So that was nice. We had other\nstruggles because we had, obviously, to make a living, and my son went to school,\nand that was alright. He learned English very, very fast, so that was not a problem.\nBut life was not easy, but it was more comfortable.",
        "Q: Did any Americans ask you about your Holocaust experiences, or your hand, or\nanything else, and what did you tell them?",
        "A: Yeah, the Americans did, especially, you know, when I first got to Palo Alto\nthey did. I told them my story, they want to know about my hand, yes. And I told\nthem. In fact, in Palo Alto our group of friends were -- were doctors and one of\nthem was a plastic surgeon. And that was the other time when they -- he offered to\ndo something on my hand. And it was going to be a very interesting project, he was\ngoing to do it for free. He was going to si -- take my little -- what was left of my\nJune 3, 2002\nlittle finger and transplant it to make a thumb out of it, and then cover my -- all the\ninside of the hand, the palm. It was going to take a couple of years to do it because I\nhad to -- it was grafting -- grafting was going to take all this time and I was not\ngoing to be able to do anything at home. My husband was not at all for it. But even\nI felt that I -- I said to him, if he could give me back my hand as it was, I would do\nit, but not if it\u2019s going to give me something else new to -- to get used to and to\nlearn how to use. It\u2019s been too long that I\u2019ve known how to use my hand as it is. I\u2019m\nnot suffering. I probably can\u2019t play the piano, but that\u2019s about all I can think that I\ncan\u2019t do. So at that point in my -- in my life, was not worth it and I backed out. But\nhe did try. And I did tell people. They listened to the story, they weren't -- 1t wasn\u2019t\ngoi -- a big deal, but -- but I did tell them the story, yes.",
        "Q: Were you able to get any additional education in the United States?",
        "A: Not really, I went to work. I had to work. I did learn a lot on the jobs. I really\nlearned a lot on the jobs and I went -- got better and better jobs in the office, and yes\n-- and I -- I -- I did very well, I got to be administration director and hired and fired\npeople, and that was good, I just wished that I\u2019d gone back to school, but I had a\nchild and I had to babysit him, sort of thing and my husband just didn\u2019t want to do\nthat for me so I missed out -- out on that a little bit.",
        "Q: How many children do you have?\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: I have two sons.",
        "Q: And the second one\u2019s name 1s?",
        "A: Dov. Dov and Joseph.",
        "Q: Wa -- one was born in Israel and the other one was born in the States, am I\nunderstanding it?",
        "A: No. I mean, my first child Dov was born in Israel and he has Down\u2019s syndrome.\nAnd he is the one who is now in a -- in a special school, it\u2019s a special place in\nEngland. And my second son was born in Reading, England because mainly, my\nhusband had an offer to go to try for the BBC job at the time I was pregnant, and I\nwas only too pleased to get out because I was still worried about my birth, because\nof the first experience, that I wanted to be everything different and every --\nsomewhere else. So we agreed to go for a year to England and that\u2019s where I gave\nbirth to Joe, in Reading, England.",
        "Q: Have you spoken to your son about your experiences during the war?",
        "A: Oh yes. Never, never kept it from him. It wasn\u2019t much of interest to him perhaps\nto begin with, but then he started when he was in school, he did a paper, he\ninterviewed me and did a paper on me, so he was always aware of -- of my\nexperiences. And asked them questions definitely, but 1t was never a secret, so I\ndon\u2019t think he ever felt that he had to pry things out of me. If he asked I answered. I\nJune 3, 2002\nhad nothing really dramatic to tell him except the horror of the whole thing, but I\nwasn\u2019t in a camp, I wasn\u2019t tortured. My hand happened, but it happened, it didn\u2019t --\nwasn\u2019t somebody, you know, cutting me up. So my -- I always felt that my story\nwas not too horrifying for anybody to listen to.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit about his education, what he does today?",
        "A: Joe was -- well, he was kindergarten age when he came here and he went\nstraight to school, through school and he got a Bachelor\u2019s from Maryland,\nUniversity of Maryland. Took him a little longer than he should have, but he did it\nhaving a job already. He worked for Fox sports for 15 years, I think. And now he\u2019s\nwith Comcast. He does producing and he\u2019s a -- what\u2019s called assignment\nmanagement for Comcast in Washington, D.C..",
        "Q: You haven\u2019t said much about your sister. Can you tell me a little about her?",
        "A: Oh yes, my sister, my sweet little sister, she was a baby two months old when\nthe war broke out and my mother and I always took care of her. And she was very,\nvery ill during the war. In fact, my mother thought she would not survive even after\nthe war, because she was -- she was like skin and bones. The doctor said that she\nwouldn\u2019t live, but thank God, she\u2019s a very healthy girl now. She\u2019s had five children.\nShe is a lovely lady, bit of a flirt. She lives in London, and -- with her husband. She\n-- unfortunately her firstborn son was killed when he was about 12 and a half years\nJune 3, 2002\nold, he fell under a car, it was a freak accident. Terrible, terrible accident. But she --\nshe went ahead and had another one, and it was another boy, so she has two girls\nand two boys and got a little granddaughter now. Wonderful to have a sister. And\nall -- all through the war we -- we took care of her, and well, she turned out okay.\nAnd very, very pro-Jewish now, and spend time in Israel, and -- both her husband\nand she -- she -- there\u2019s no problem being Jewish any more.",
        "Q: Are you more religiously Jewish now than your family was before the war?",
        "A: My family was not religious at all before the war. That\u2019s the problem and I really\nnever -- we never had any holidays at home, we never did anything like that, but I\ndid know I was Jewish. And it was very upsetting to me to have to say that I wasn\u2019t,\nand I was very happy to come back to it, but I am not religious. And having lived in\nIsrael, I feel I have somehow become Jewish and I can -- I don\u2019t have to feel guilty\nabout that any more. But I do not like rituals. And I do feel very close to the Jews,\nto my brethren. I don\u2019t mind going to the synagogue, but I don\u2019t like preaching and\nI don\u2019t like rituals, so it\u2019s a bit of a tug of war within me.",
        "Q: During your time in this country, the United States has gone through some\nchanges, let\u2019s put it that way. What were your thoughts, given your background,\nwhen United States was in conflict with the Soviet Union?\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: Well, we were all afraid. We were afraid of the Soviet Union. We knew that\nthey wouldn\u2019t le-leave voluntarily, wouldn\u2019t give up places voluntarily. When they\nwalked into Poland my mother said, they are not leaving. She knew. I mean, again I\nhave to quote her because I was too young to understand. And we were afraid when\nKennedy gave the ultimatum about removing the missiles in Cuba. My husband\nsaid it was a terrible thing. I didn\u2019t know what to think. I know I was afraid. I didn\u2019t\nexpect the outcome as it -- 1t was when the wa -- Berlin wall fell down. And the\nonly thing I have to say about that is I was afraid about Germany getting too strong\nagain, when the wa-wa-wall came down. That was -- I knew definitely that I was\nafraid. And I was afraid of Russia, yes. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a -- still afraid, because they are\nnot in a very good situation and there\u2019s too much crime there. The world 1s a very,\nvery shaky place, an-and -- and every way you look, it\u2019s not safe.",
        "Q: Were you aware of some of the events in the Civil Rights movement when you\nfirst came here?",
        "A: Not really. The only one if I have is that the Jews helped the Civil Rights, I do\nknow that. And then we got kicked in the teeth and they didn\u2019t really appreciate it\nand there was a lot of anti-Semitism coming from the black community, which hurt,\nbecause they\u2019re always trying to help others who are in the bad situation and\nJune 3, 2002\nunfortunately don\u2019t get any thanks for it. And so I\u2019m not too keen on -- on that\nblack community for that reason.",
        "Q: The United States was also involved in a war in Vietnam. Do you have any\nrecollections on -- on what that meant to you, having gone through a war yourself?",
        "A: The recolatio -- recollections I have is because we both worked with American\nembassy. The Americans were trying to -- to promote and to present the side on\nVietnam war to the Israelis. And I believed what I heard. I did not really have my\nown opinion since I wasn\u2019t living in the States at the time. And later on I\nunderstood, but at the time I was all for what the American was doing -- what the\nAmericans were doing and I thought communism was a great, great threat. So at the\ntime yes, I did believe that, but now I realize that it wasn\u2019t so, that there was a\ndifferent way to deal with it, that it should have been.

        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Halina Peabody. This is tape number two, side\nA, and you were telling me about some of the experiences in this country, and we\nhad talked about Vietnam. I wanted to ask you if you had any experience with any\nanti-Semitism in the United States?",
        "A: Not really. Iam quite aware of the fact that Jews are not loved everywhere, but\nnot really. I have not come across anybody specifically not liking me because I was\nJewish. I had a couple experiences -- well, I had a very cute experiences at work\nwhere a lady was mad, a -- a colleague was mad at somebody because they was --\nkept bugging her on the phone and she slammed the phone down saying, that Jew.\nAnd then looked at me and, oh Halina, I didn't mean it, I didn\u2019t mean it. And then\ntwo weeks later she said, you know, I\u2019ve got to go have an operation, I have a\nwonderful Jewish doctor. So that was -- but from then on, you know, I understood\nwhere -- she was a redneck, so I -- I -- I guess that that was part of it. I know there\nare people who are not particularly keen on Jews, but we have lots of friends who\nare not Jewish and who like us, so n-n-no -- no other problems.",

        "A: Yes. I got divorced in 1972, I believe. We had problems for awhile, and hoping\nthat the United States will help us, but -- moving away from families, but it didn\u2019t\nwork. So when my husband decided to go abroad on a mission, he went -- he went\ninto the foreign service. And that was the time when we really broke up, because he\nwas going to Yugoslavia then, and there was no American school in Yugoslavia, so\nit would have meant that I had to send my son to an American school in Italy or in\nIsrael and I would have to go to Yugoslavia with him and I certainly couldn\u2019t --\ncouldn\u2019t have done that. So that was the breaking point, and so we divorced. And he\nwent off to Yugoslavia and I stayed here with my son, and eventually met\nsomebody very nice, name of Richard Peabody, whose mother happens to be\nJewish, in fact. And so I wasn\u2019t so worried, because being from Poland and having\nheard that you should not marry out of your religion even if you\u2019re not religious, I\nfigured he couldn\u2019t call me a dirty Jew anyway, because he was one, technically\nanyway. And we\u2019ve been married for the last 20 years, very happily and I hope we\ncontinue for another 20.",
        "Q: Please tell me about the work that you do for the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum.",
        "A: Well, I do whatever they need. I am working mostly in the office because they\ndidn\u2019t -- they were supposed to put me on Polish translations, but they don\u2019t happen\nJune 3, 2002\nto need any work there. So I work in Martin Goldman\u2019s office, who is the Director\nof Survivor Affairs, and I also joined the circle for -- writer\u2019s circle there, I\u2019m trying\nto put my story down from the war, which is very, very difficult for me, but I like\nthe people there and I feel very comfortable. And when I came to the point where I\nfelt I wanted to volunteer somewhere, I went around and I thought, where would I\ndo best? And I thought, well where would I do best, th-the only place I could so is\nthe U.S. Holocaust Museum cause that\u2019s where I belong.

        "Q: What\u2019s your reaction to the resurgence of interest in the Holocaust in recent\nyears?",

And I\u2019m -- I\u2019m\npleased to tell my story. It does hurt, and it does exhaust me, but I feel very much\nobligated any time I\u2019m asked, to tell it. And I do keep telling it. I\u2019ve got a button, if\nyou push it\u2019ll just come out. I\u2019ve talked to a couple of schools here and there and I\nalways feel that perhaps my story is not sufficiently big to -- to -- to -- just for the\nwhole lecture, so I always like to take somebody else with me, and -- but I have no\nproblem in telling it, and -- and I do. And if they help me to tell it better, perhaps I\nwould do better job at it. So maybe the museum can do that for me.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "Q: In your opinion, do you think the American Jewish community might ever be in\ndanger because of skinheads or neo-Nazis?",
        "A: Yes. I think that we are all always in danger. We always have to watch and we\nalways have to worry. I think that the ameri -- America is the safest place for Jews\nright now, but I certainly don\u2019t feel completely safe anywhere in the world,\nespecially now.",
        "Q: Would you like to elaborate on that?",
        "A: Well, because the Arabs are attacking Israel and because the Moslems\n[indecipherable] I do believe that the whole world is in danger, but I don\u2019t think\npeople understand that they\u2019re starting with the Jews just like Hitler did. Hitler\nwasn\u2019t going to just kill the Jews, he was going to kill Slavs, and whoever else, to\nmake a perfect race. The Moslem wants every -- want everybody to be Moslem, and\nbe an -- just like the Al-Qaida in Afghanistan. So I don\u2019t think people realize the\ndanger, but I do, because we\u2019ve been through it and we know what it -- what it can\ncreate. And if America backs off, 1t\u2019s going to be very, very bad for the world. I\njust hope that they\u2019re strong enough and that they will continue rooting them out\nand somehow manage to turn the world around, keep the democracies.",

        "A: Well, I had nightmares. I was running with my son, I was hiding and -- and --\nand trying to find a safe place. Mainly, I couldn\u2019t tell you how proud I was that\nthey\u2019ve always won, tha -- how strong they were. And that gives me courage to\nthink that they will survive no matter what. There\u2019ll be pain, there are killings, there\nare murders, we lose people. But we manage to recreate and somehow continue, and\nI hope that that will continue forever, so that my children can also see Israel and --\nand -- and grad -- great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.",
        "Q: Have you ever regretted having left Israel?",
        "A: Yes, I have. I -- I loved living in Israel. I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve regretted 1t many, many\nways, but I find life so much easier here. I a -- you know, I -- I suppose in my old\nage, I would be -- find it rather hard to go back -- especially I wouldn\u2019t go back\ncause my son is here an-and his life is here, that I -- that I would never go back to\nIsrael for that reason, but when we left, yes, I do regret. ve never felt as happy\nand as free and at home as I felt in Israel. But again, you know, for selfish reasons I\nguess I\u2019m -- I\u2019m comfortable here. So one has to make accommodations.",
        "Q: How do you think your Holocaust experience influenced the choices that you\nmade over the years?",
        "A: I think my main reason, my main choice was to take care of th -- my kids. I think\nthat this is what my mother taught me by doing what she did during the war, by\nJune 3, 2002\nputting herself out and letting anything happen just as long as she could save her\nkids, transferred it to me. So I would do the same for my kids and my grandchild\nand those are the choices I\u2019ve made, always whatever\u2019s goos -- good for my\nchildren. Other than that, I have enjoyed having a lot of things that I was not\nallowed to have during childhood. I missed a lot of things by -- by being during the\nwar and running for my life and wanted to give it to my grandchildren as much as\npossible. I think that was -- that\u2019s my main -- my main outcome of the -- of the\nexperiences.",
        "Q: You mentioned that during the time that Israel was at war you had nightmares.\nHave you had any other recurring nightmares since -- since the Shoah?",
        "A: Not really. I -- ?ve not had many nightmares, no. I happen to be quite healthy, I\nthink, in that respect. I don\u2019t dream, I sleep very well. So perhaps I did the right\nthings. I didn't -- I don\u2019t feel guilty about anything. I -- I -- \u2019 ve often wondered why\nI don\u2019t feel guilty like some people, that others didn\u2019t survive and we did. I am\nasking the question why I survived and the others didn\u2019t, but I don\u2019t feel guilty. I\nthink that everybody tried their best and luck was with us and God was with us.\nThat\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know what else I can think about that, but that\u2019s my reaction.",

And that\u2019s another group that I love dearly and\neverybody there is my best friend and -- and I wouldn\u2019t never leave that group. This\nis my -- this is my -- how can I say it?

        "A: They are called hidden children, yes.",
        "Q: Thank you for clarifying that. What has been your best surprise about life in\nAmerica?",
        "A: The comforts, the ease of living, the fact that if you work hard anybody can\nreally have a wonderful life here. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m finally getting to, a\nwonderful life, and I\u2019m hoping it\u2019Il last for a very long time.

I\u2019m hoping\nthat I can achieve all the little things, all my little dreams. Practical things, you\nknow. Making a nice home, having practical and -- and -- and material things,\nbecause that\u2019s all I -- I can do now. I am -- you know, almost 70 years old, so I want\nto travel a little bit, and as long as I can see my family in London, my son, my\nJune 3, 2002\nsister, her kids.

        "A: Oh, that was very traumatic, that brought me right back to where I came from,\nfrom the Holocaust. That ruined my -- my -- my quiet. I was feeling very\ncomfortable and quiet and I\u2019m no longer so. Since then I have been in turmoil. And\nthe longer it goes on after, the aftermath, the worse it gets.

        "A: We were in Jaroslaw, which is not too far from Krakow, which is not our\nhometown, but where we went as Catholics because nobody knew us there and it\nwas sort of on the way to Krakow. I guess my mother was trying to be close, but\nnot too close, in case she needed to look up somebody, or -- I don\u2019t know why,\nreally, but that\u2019s where we -- we spent the war.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Olga. My sister\u2019s name was Eva, which she kept even\nas a Catholic. And she was born in June 30, 1939. So she must have been like\nalmost six years old.",
        "A: Well, they had to have been Russian, which my mother referred to as not\nliberators, but occupiers, again. But at least they weren't killing us any more.\nAlthough there was a pogrom she told me, and she refused to let me speak my\nname. I still had to use the Catholic name because she said they\u2019re going to kill us.",
        "A: Not at that point. Not -- not til much later.",
        "A: Well, it meant a great frustration because I wanted to say who I was and I\ncouldn\u2019t. And there I was with my hand in a -- on the -- on the railing for two\nmonths, and my mother in the meantime -- well, they had to put it on a rail because\nthey -- the hand was -- was going to grow in such a way that I wouldn\u2019t be able to\nstraighten it. It -- it -- it bent like that. If you -- if -- the nuns really saved my hand,\nbecause they kept on stretching and stretching. And my mother, in the meantime,\nwas diagnosed with cancer. And so -- they didn\u2019t -- they weren\u2019t even sure a\nhundred percent if it was cancer, but there was a lump. And they felt that, you\nJune 3, 2002\nknow, they didn\u2019t want us to be orphans, they said, and they told me to go and\nconvince her to have the -- the breast off. So on top of everything else, she had to\nhave her breast off and she had this operation. And we discovered that the lady with\nwhom we had been living during the war was killed by the same hand grenade that -\n- that hit me. So we had no -- no room, no place to go, although the neighbor next\ndoor took us in. So my mother spent th-the -- sort of the d-days before she got the\noperation between the hospital and home and with my sister. And then after she was\noperated on, she was also in the hospital. I guess my sister was with the lady\nsometime and sometimes with us in the hospital.",
        "A: Not personally, but when we already lived in London, we had a couple living in\nthe house, we used to rent out hou -- rooms. And one of the guys was all broken up\nand beaten up and my father said that it was because he was a collaborator, that he -\n- he got beaten up. But not of my own eyes or experience.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what I wanted. I was too miserable and too weak to think about\nanything. My hand was occupying my -- my thoughts. Re-Reuniting with my father\nafter so many years and not knowing him and not knowing, you know, how to\nJune 3, 2002\nbehave. It was a strange world all of a sudden. I really didn\u2019t think about it, I\nremember Mother saying that no matter what they will -- what kind of sentences\nthey\u2019ll give the Germans is not enough and there is just no kind of punishment that\ncould punish them for what they\u2019ve done.",
        "A: No. After the war we knew he was alive because my mother got a Red Cross\ntelegram. That is, she didn't get it directly, the people who never survived to tell us\nanything about what went on, but were killed by the Germans, sent us a letter that\nthere was a communication from my father through the Red Cross that he was alive\nin Palestine with his sister. So we knew he was alive. We had no idea where\nexactly he was, but after the war there were announcements all over the place, and\nmy mother put announcements in the radio. And they found him in Palestine. And\nthat\u2019s why he contacted us. He sent my cousin, his nephew who was in the British\narmy in Palestine to Poland to get us out and to put us in touch with the Jewish\nagency, and that\u2019s how we reunited. We reunited with him somewhere near\nMunich, after we crossed the Brenner Pass. He came to get us.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure, but 1t was somewhere -- probably before April 1946. Probably\nMarch. March, April \u201946 because by April I was 1n the -- in -- in the DP camp in --\nin Italy, and I know he didn\u2019t stay very long because he had to report back to the\narmy.",
        "A: Well, he was part of the General Anders, the Polish army that fought along with\nthe British army against the Germans. And apparently Stalin made this agreement\nat Yalta that they would let out the prisoners, all the prisoners out. However, he\ntells us that he had to run away and -- and found -- find a way to get out with the\nPolish army. He was in Siberia.",
        "A: Yes, we did. My mother went to Krak\u00e9w and found that there was no sign of\nour grandparents. We did find that my uncle, my father\u2019s brother survived\nAuschwitz. And we kept missing him. We kept trying to find him and we didn\u2019t\nknow where he was exactly, but we knew he was alive. He lost his wife and\ndaughter, who was exactly my age. And he was the only one that survived in\nPoland. The others -- whoever -- whoever else was in Poland did not survive, in\nmy family, but my aunt, uncle and cousin who were taken to Russia, to Siberia,\nJune 3, 2002\nalso survived. My uncle died in [indecipherable] on the way out already of Russia,\nbut my aunt and cousin lived in England with us afterwards.",
        "A: I could not. It\u2019s in Russia -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s in Ukraine now, it\u2019s in Zaleszezyki,\nwhich is on the frontier of Romania. At the time, it was Poland. Now it\u2019s Ukraine\nand they tell me it\u2019s much too dangerous. They still would like to kill us all.",
        "A: Strangely enough it came to me when I was watching \u201cWorld at War\u201d with\nLawrence Olivier. I had never really thought about it. I guess I was too young and\ntoo concentrated on my own problems. But when I saw that program, it struck me\nand it really hit me very, very hard.",
        "A: I think I was already -- I don\u2019t know, it has to be in England, or maybe even in\nthe States. It was a -- much, much later.",
        "A: Personally, no. My mother went to Krakow and tried to track, as I said,\neverybody down. There was no room for us in Krakow, so she found a -- a small\nJune 3, 2002\nplace to live in, very close to one of the village near Krakow. Again they asked her\ndirectly if she was Polish, meaning was she Jewish and she had to say she was\nPolish. So again we were under the assumed names, and again we had to cover up. I\nwent to school there. It was very strange, I was the only one who could read and\nwrite. And my mother went to the Jewish agency, and strangely enough, I don\u2019t\nknow why it is, but she only registered herself as being alive, never put the children\ndown. They were very surprised that she had two children, that she managed to\nsurvive with two children. I never went to the Jewish com -- agency, as far as I\nremember, I think she went by herself, but I may have forgotten. Very -- something\nvery strange happened there because an old friend of hers who was remarried to a\nCatholic man and had big cross on her breast, said to her that my hand happened\nbecause I became a Catholic without being baptized. I\u2019ve never -- never forgotten\nthat, my mother was absolutely infuriated and sort of stuck in my mind that some of\nus were not perfect.",
        "A: Well, it was when we manage -- when we finally got into the Jewish agency\ngroups and everybody was Jewish. However, there was another little wrinkle. They\nthought we were not Jewish and they tried to say that my mother was trying to get\nJune 3, 2002\nout of Poland under the guise of being Jewish and that she really wasn't, and we\nwere not. So she had to try to convince them that she really was Jewish. And there\nwe were, you know, trying to convince them we are Jewish. And finally -- all she\nwould say was that my -- her husband\u2019s name was Isaac. And finally some people\nwho knew us from Krakow did sign that -- sign off on us, that we were legitimate.",
        "A: Yes, we were in sort of group homes, they -- they had us in groups and they were\ngoing to transport us out one -- one group at a time. It was somewhere near\nKrakow, I -- I don\u2019t know, 1s closer to the German border. And what happens was -\n- was that they took one group after a time, they took pregnant and old -- elderly\npeople first. The Russians had a sort of agreement that they would let us through,\nbut they liked to be paid on the border, so they always had prepared money and\nthere was a Polish guy, then a Russian guy, then they kind of closed their eyes to us,\nbut -- but you had to still pay your way through. The first lorry that went out got\ncaught, and apparently they were put back into some other camp and then they were\nlet go. They didn\u2019t really want to keep us, but the second one went through and the\nproblem was that before we got onto the truck, they attacked us at night, the Polish\nmilitia. And they wanted t-to -- to probably rape an-and steal from us, I don\u2019t know.\nJune 3, 2002\nWe had to stand there and scream on top of our lungs in order for them to go away.\nWe were lucky that they in -- in the end they went. In the morning they turned up\nand said, oh, what was the problem, we heard there were noises. But we knew\nexactly what it was, so we were just looking forward to getting out. It was a very\nstrange, very strange time. Strange time. The last -- the -- when we ca -- got out, we\n-- they put us out wha -- three kilometers past the frontier. Once my mother gave up\nher watch because the Russians wanted watches in addition to whatever they got.\nAnd then another guy gave his watch up. So we got through and then the German\nrefused to sell us tickets. We were supposed to buy tickets in the train and then get\nto Berlin on our own accord. And the leaders went to buy tickets and the Germans\ndidn\u2019t want to sell them to us because we were Jews. I don\u2019t know what they did in\nthe end, but we did get on the train and we did get to Berlin. We were in the\nRussian sector first and they tried to also establish that we were Jewish. They took\ntwo or three people and had them sign their name in Hebrew. And the -- then they\ncame back and it was okay. We went from there to the British section and then to\nthe American section, we were kind of carted around. And in the end they sent us\non to DP camp in Italy.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: Yes, it was -- there were two near Ancona, there was Trani and Barletta. And\nwe did not spend much time there, but have quite nice memories. I remember the\nmusic. And well, I -- as I said, we were young and we wanted -- we were happy to\nbe alive. It was a -- it was a better time. The weather was beautiful, we had food,\nand my father told them explicitly to keep us there as long as possible, to have us\nrecover in the nice weather and the good food. My father, who was a dentist, had\nprivilege in the hospital there and so we used to go and have our meals at the\nhospital. My mother taught us to swim there in the -- in the gorgeous sea, you\nknow, and we had a very pleasant time. The food was marvelous, the -- the -- the\ncherries particularly, just absolutely wonderful. And the ice cream, I\u2019ve never tasted\n-- maybe because it was after the war and we were so hungry, but never tasted\nanything like it. And it was -- it was very pleasant pastime. Unfortunately, because\nmy father asked them to send us late -- last, they sent us first to England, because\nwe chose -- my father and my mother decided that out of the choices, Palestine or\nEngland, we should go to England. So they sent us 1n a very cold time to England.\nIt was not -- not a very happy experience to begin with.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: We were there only two months, and we -- we were just there, I think, for\nsleeping, because we spent most of that time in the hos -- near the hospital and --\nand on the beach. We didn\u2019t have much education, no there was no education, I\nmean, there was nothing going on. At the time it was not organized for that yet.\nVery early, I think.",
        "A: I don\u2019t, I\u2019m afraid. But as I said, I found that we were there in 19 -- in -- in April\n1946, so that -- that\u2019s the date that I have because I found some document that states\nApril \u201946, we were there.",
        "A: I didn't have any na -- trouble with my name. I do remember when we first found\nFather and we -- he ha -- he brought a -- a chauffeur and a Mercedes and we\ntraveled through -- through part of Italy and at one point we got off and went into\nsome side -- side -- what do they call it, the gardens. And we found these beautiful\nred cherries and we picked up some and we came -- came to -- back to the car and\nhe almost killed us. I mean, he was furious. He told us no more stealing. We were\nJune 3, 2002\nso used to do that during the war in order to survive. So that stands out in my mind.\nWhat was the other question?",
        "A: No, not I, but my sister. My sister, who did not know she was Jewish, because\nwe couldn\u2019t tell her, she was too young. When my cousin from Palestine came,\neven though he didn\u2019t look that Jewish, she immediately recognized that he had a\nlong nose, and she said, Arayed, you\u2019re Jewish, but you\u2019re nice. And he said, but\nyou\u2019re Jewish too. And she said absolutely not. She would not believe him. And it\ntook her quite awhile before she accepted it, but I had no trouble, no. I just kept\ngoing to church, though. I was so used to it, I kept going to church until they\nstopped me.",
        "A: Oh, just being with friends on Sunday. I mean, that was the only recreation we\nhad during the war, you know, the only time that you dressed a little bit, whatever\nyou had and it was a social occasion, so it was very hard to -- you know, not to do\nit. Everybody else was Catholic. Most of the people we were with was -- are, you\nknow, officer\u2019s families. So that was something that I -- I missed.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: Not until we left Poland. Not in Poland, but once we left Poland, then yes. And\nI was very -- I was very happy about be-being able to admit it, but I wasn\u2019t proud of\nit until I lived in Israel.",
        "A: There was no such thing as rehabilitation for anything in those days as far as I\nknow. What I did get was some help from the teachers, who tried to accommodate\nmy -- both the lack of no -- knowing English and my lack of thumb, to do subjects\nthat would make it easier for me. And that\u2019s why they immediately switched me to\ncommercial subjects like shorthand, which meant that I didn\u2019t have to spell, and\ntyping, which means I learned how to spell by copying. And then also arranged for\nme -- showed me how to use my fingers so that I wouldn\u2019t need the thumb or the\nlittle finger, so that I could type. And I did type over a hundred words a minute at\none point, so I -- I did pretty well on that. And I also found that I could knit, which I\ncould before the war, before I lost my thumb. And whatever I could do before,\nincluding even cutting my cuticles, I found I could do. At one point they decided\nthey wanted to help me and they got me to a doctor and the doctor was going to try\nJune 3, 2002\nto do something with my hand, they wanted to adjust my -- one of my fingers so\nthat I could use it as a thumb. I don\u2019t know, it was -- it was a very difficult situation.\nMy mother didn\u2019t know what to tell me cause she was in such pain about this, and\nw -- I ended up being in the hospital and already the -- getting the first shot before\nthe anesthesia and I said no, I don\u2019t want to do it, and I just got out. And I said I --\nyou know, I just got off the bed and -- and thanked them and -- and never tried that\none again. I felt that it was just too difficult and I\u2019m glad I did because my instinct\njust told me not to. But other than that my rehabilitation was mainly my own doing.\nThe other thing I did was play table tennis, which meant that I was easier with the\ncompany I was in. I liked the company of boys, which was easier [indecipherable]\nto play table tennis. And plus, when you play a -- a sport like table tennis or any\nother sport, you have no time to think of your hand. You know, I used to stand with\nmy hand in the back so that it doesn\u2019t show. But when you play, you know, you\nhave to serve, you have to put your ball up and -- and you -- you have to look at the\nball, so you don\u2019t have time for the hand. And that, I think, is my cure. That was my\ncure.",
        "A: I was in England. Yeah, my father, as I said, decided to go to England, and\nafter spending about a year in Liverpool in a camp, we -- also they taught -- tried to\nJune 3, 2002\nteach us English there. They taught us and -- and I was sent to a school in\nUlverston, which was a little way away -- away, and I was surprised how well I\nwas doing until I learned it was a technical school. But anyway, my English started\ngetting slowly better, you know, you\u2019re like -- 13 and a half I was by then. My sister\nhad no problem whatsoever, but I had troubles. I was reading Polish books and\nknitting in school, but they didn\u2019t mind. They let me -- they let me do what I needed\nto and I did math. So that\u2019s how I started learning English.",
        "A: I -- it was a military -- I mean, it was for m -- for officer\u2019s families. The English\nwere very nice to us, but it was such a hard time at the time because they were so\nworn out themselves that r-rationed food was very scarce. They gave us what they\ngave to th -- to their own, but 1t was -- we were always hungry. And, as I said, we\nhad heating only a -- a couple of hours a day. We were in barracks, you know, it\nwas beds, stacked beds, and did our best that we could. We go to Liverpool with\nour ration cards and get some bit of clothing here and there, but mainly we lived on\nkippers, because you know, we were hungry for meat and meat was very scarce. So\nthe kippers were the only ones that you could get without rationing. I don\u2019t think\nI\u2019ve ever seen a kipper since, because I can\u2019t stand it. But mainly that\u2019s wh-what we\nate as -- as protein.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: No, not at all. I -- | hardly knew what Palestine was all about. I had very little\nknowledge about that. It was not until they declared the state of Israel that I\nremember my father coming in with absolutely shining eyes and saying, we have a\ncountry. And that was when I really paid attention.",
        "A: Not really. I guess I was too busy with my own problems again, but I remember\nmy mother tell -- saying that there was no punishment that she could think of that\nwould be enough for them, so there was a lot anger. But as I said, I -- I was too busy\nwith doing other things and I was just too young to -- to think about it.",
        "A: Some. Not very overt, but P\u2019ll never forget when I applied for a job at the\nautomobile association in London. The personnel officer asked me what religion I\nwas, she said I didn\u2019t have to say. But I wanted to, at that time I felt I needed to say\nwho I was, so I said Jewish. And she said to me, we don\u2019t ma -- mind Jews, but you\ncan\u2019t have Jewish holidays off. And I was so stung by it. Now, I\u2019m not religious,\nbut it stung me, I\u2019ve never forgotten it. I did get the job. I did very well there, too,\nbut I\u2019ve never forgotten that.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: Not really. Not -- people were not very interested. There were a lot of refugees\nand nobody was really curious about u -- me as far as I knew. They were very\nhelpful. The English are very -- how can I put it? They don\u2019t -- they don\u2019t question\nyou, they don\u2019t ask you things like that. They were very quiet about it and they\nknew, but they didn't really know. But they didn\u2019t want to. So they were very nice,\nas I said, they put themselves out, they tried to help me in school. They gave me\nsecondhand clothing which they said would be for somebody in the camp, which\nthey meant for me. But other than that, no.",
        "A: Not really, they didn\u2019t. They were too polite. The British are like that. They just\ndon\u2019t ask you. But as I said, they were very nice and helped me a lot in other ways,\nbut never asked me anything about my hand.",
        "A: No. No, I was very miserable. Look, I didn\u2019t know the language, I had my hand\nto cover up all the time. That was before I was playing table tennis, and it -- it was a\nmiserable time. The weather is miserable in England. It was cold, I was always\ncold, and rainy. I didn\u2019t have enough clothes really and it was hard getting used to\nbeing a family with Father again. We were so used to being with just Mother and\nplus, during the war I was the -- the s -- the second partner, you know, and then\nafter the war I was a child again. It was very uncomfortable. And we struggled,\nbecause when they decided to come to London, we bought a house. The way you\nbought a house that time, all the refugees wanted a house to have roots, but you\nlived in a -- one level and you rented out the rooms at the top so that you could pay\nthe mortgage. So it was a hard life. And my mother didn\u2019t realize that by law I had\nto go to school, so before we came to London, she and my sister went first to look\nfor the house and she broke down in one of the schools because they said that they\nhad no room for me. And -- and th-the director took pity on her and said he s -- he\u2019Il\nsend her to another school in Fulham, which is southwest London, where they did\nJune 3, 2002\naccept me. It was a very nice -- it was actually a girls\u2019 school. And the\nheadmistress, Dr. Toms, I\u20191l never forget. She was a very -- very lovely lady. And\nso they accepted me there, but when they moved to the house -- when we went to\n[indecipherable] London, she insisted I continue going to s -- to Fulham, which\nmeant about an hour on the underground every day, cause she was so afraid that\nthey -- I wouldn\u2019t get education. So it was a hard time. I liked school, and they\nweren't having any -- any excuses there, you know. I said I didn\u2019t know enough\nEnglish to do my homework and they said never mind, just keep trying. So I ended\nup really doing just as well as any other, and as I said, because I was on commercial\nsubjects, I did pretty well. In fact, I did -- I think I was one of the first pupils in -- in\nschool that passed the shorthand test. So I was happy in that, from that point of\nview, but living at home was difficult. We -- as I said, we struggled every week,\nthere was not enough money for anything. My father was able to practice dentistry\nin -- in the army, but not in England. He wasn\u2019t -- his -- his education wasn\u2019t a-a-\napparently sufficient, so he was a difficult situation too. So it was not -- not an easy\ntime at all. My mother was miserable. She felt very much an incomplete person\nbecause of her operation for cancer. And she was very, very unhappy and that made\nme unhappy because, you know, I loved my mother very much. I did realize what\nJune 3, 2002\nshe did for us during the war, I mean, she just absolutely used up every inch of her\nstrength and I think she didn't have much strength left in her to fight.",
        "A: About 11 years. I stayed from when we arrived to 1957 and my mother died in\n1954 and -- \u00b053 - \u201954 -- 1953 was the first time that I went to Israel for the\nMaccabiah with my table tennis. I joined the Maccabee club in London and\nbecame very good at it and we represented England in the Maccabiah games. That\nwas the happiest trip in time I\u2019ve ever had, I -- you know the ship, the old, old ship\nthat was horrible, that was such -- I had such a wonderful time and we stood on the\n-- on the ship all night coming through to Haifa and Ill never forget that\nexperience. So in 1953 was my first trip to Israel. And unfortunately my mother\ncame down with cancer when I got back and in 1957, I left England for good, but\nuntil then I lived in England.",
        "A: To Israel, to the second Maccabiah, where there was some family. We had the\nfamily that emigrated to -- to Palestine in 1932, my father\u2019s sister and her four\nchildren. There were just grandchildren there by then already, and I had friends. The\none couple that survived that we knew from before the war in Haifa. And I had the\nmost wonderful time there. And there was another woman who was my age, whose\nJune 3, 2002\nparents knew my parents. And we were in touch, so I had friends in both Haifa and\nTel Aviv, and it -- I felt so much at home. I mean, it was just wonderful.",
        "A: I was hoping to get a job, just to be able to stay and that was my primary\nconcern, and I knew I couldn\u2019t just stay with my friends forever, and my aunt, so I\nstart looking for a job. And because I spoke and -- and -- and was educated in\nEngland, I found a job in Haifa, which was near Haifa, actually. Haifa refineries,\nwhich belonged to British petroleum, and they grabbed me because I was British\neducated. So I had no problem and I got into a -- a hostel, there were lovely youth\nhostels there. And started working there and lived there for many years, until they\nsold the refineries. And then they tried to teach us Hebrew, I didn\u2019t do very well. I\ndid speak, but I didn\u2019t write or read and I couldn\u2019t work in the language. So I started\nlooking in Tel Aviv, and I had two offers. One was from the Wisotsky tea; they\nwould have taught me better Hebrew, and then there was the American embassy in\nTel Aviv, and that was more glamorous. Even though the-they offered a lower\nsalary, I decided that that was the place for me. So I took the job at the American\nembassy and moved to Tel Aviv.",
        "A: Well, my social life was -- was good. I had lots of different boyfriends and I was\ntrying very hard to settle down, but it wasn\u2019t easy. Never easy. I was not so young\nany more, I was in my late 20\u2019s. For me I thought that was very late. I missed my\nboat. So I -- I had some friends in Haifa and lots of girlfriends, that was easy. And\nwe had a good time. And -- and then in the embassy there was some very interesting\nand attractive young men, so that\u2019s how my social life was pretty good there.",
        "A: Not really. I don\u2019t recall them. I tried to tell them about my hand, I was always\nwarning people about my hand because I was still at the point where I thought I had\nto warn them so that people wouldn\u2019t get a shock. And I remember one young man\nwho tried to grab my hand, and I said don\u2019t, you\u2019Il be sorry. And he insisted and\nthen I could see him going absolutely stiff and -- and -- and -- and surprised. And\nthat was a terrible experience. And so I -- I tried to warn people about that, but not -\n- not -- about the rest of the experiences, nobody really wanted to know. They all be\n-- they were busy themselves, you know, building up the country and my family\nwould not speak any Polish, they said that that was not the language that they\nwanted to use. And so we spoke English actually [indecipherable] until I learned\nenough Hebrew to speak with them.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: Not then, but later on I\u2019ve heard remarks like, you know, we got to get on with\nour lives, you know, this was then, this is now, we\u2019ve got a new fight on our hands.\nThey really didn't want to get involved. Of course, the Eichmann trial came\nafterwards and that really became a big, big thing in Israel and a lot of people --\nwell, a lot of people fainted, a lot of people had heart attacks, because it all brought\nit back and there were witnesses that had to appear. And I remember then that there\nwas some more interest in it, and most of the people didn't want to know, tried not\nto think about it, but you could not help it, it just floated back and flooded you with\nmemories.",
        "A: I was about to be asked and then I got married. So as a married person I did not\nhave to go into the army. I have a feeling that if had gone, because of my hand I\nwould not have been on the front lines anyway, but I was afraid. I didn\u2019t want to go\ninto the army. I didn\u2019t get married for that reason, but I did -- I did li -- like the idea\nnot having to go into the army.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: Well, I married a guy who worked for the U.S. Information Agency, and who\nwas Bulgarian and was very, very -- how can I put it? Very important in the USIS,\nhe was the head of the local people and he did a very good job, spoke beautiful\nEnglish, so I had no problem, but he was a Sephardic Jew. So that was a little\nproblem for my family, they didn't like the idea very much, but well it was, as I\nsaid, it was a different time in -- in everybody\u2019s life and everybody was mingling by\nthen. And his mother was very, very lovely, I remember that. And his father was a\nlittle bit strange, was very autocratic. I didn\u2019t like that, but I wasn\u2019t marrying the\nfamily. And I met him at the embassy and we got married at the em -- well,\nactually, at the embassy.",
        "A: It comes -- what comes to mind in mainly that I loved Israel and I still do. It\u2019s\nmy place, it\u2019s my country and even though I don\u2019t live there, it\u2019s the most important\nthing in my life is that Israel survives. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m so proud of, and \u2019'm\n-- I\u2019m just so worried about all the time, and there\u2019s always been problems there, as\nyou know. So it\u2019s so difficult to now accept the fact that we\u2019re still again at war,\nand more and more killings and more killings and I feel haunted -- ho-hounded. It\u2019s\nlike it\u2019s never ends. I was just go -- getting over the Holocaust and here we are\nagain, another Holocaust. And it\u2019s frightening what\u2019s written in the papers, that they\nJune 3, 2002\nwant to demolish us again and that the Arabs are against us and that we may not\nsurvive. I just hope not to live that long to see that. But I do believe it will survive,\nand I think that the spirit of the people and the strength of Israel is such that there\u2019s\njust no way that they can finish them off.",
        "A: I left Israel in 1968, and the reason for that was that my husband was, as I said\nin the U.S. Information Agency, and he wanted, for his own career development,\nwanted to go and expand a little. Israel is a small country. He felt that in his\nprofession, he needed a little more air. So we thought we\u2019d come for a year, at least\nthat was the plan. We rented our apartment and came with the best hope. He also\nwanted to go to school if possible, and I was supposed to go to work. My son was\nthen five and a half, so he was going to go to kindergarten. And that\u2019s how we\nplanned it. We got to Washington, but by the time we got to Washington he got an\noffer from the Hoover Institute, which is near Stamford University in California.\nSo in the end we went out to Palo Alto and that\u2019s where we spent two and a half\nyears and -- and he actually did some very good work at the Hoover Institute. He\nwas the first Israeli to work there and the local Jewish community was very nice to\nus and very interested in what we were about and wanted to know more about us.\nThis was part of the Jewish community that was never very much involved with\nJune 3, 2002\nIsrael and that was a time that they suddenly awa -- awoke to the fact that Israel\nwas something that would be of interest to them. And so we had a very, very nice\nsocial life there. And he did very well. He did very well, but then he changed, he\nwent to work for San Francisco Examiner, and after awhile he felt that the only\nway to complete his rise in the -- in the profession, he had to come east. So that\u2019s --\nafter two and a half years we moved back to Washington and he went to work for\nVoice of America.",
        "A: Yes, but Bulgarian Jewry was not killed, only -- only the other areas, I think the -\n- the Bulgaria proper, the king would not let anybody be killed. They put them in\ncamps, they told them to give up all their goods, gold, silver, money, whatever,\nproperty. But they never killed anybody. And so they survived as a -- as a\ncommunity and the whole community after the war, immigrated to Israel.",
        "A: My husband\u2019s name is Norbert Yasharoff, and I have two sons. One is Dov\nYasharoff and one is Joe, or Yosi Yasharoff.",
        "A: Well, I was a little worried. I was happy that they spoke English. I thought they\nwere supposed to speak English anyway. It didn\u2019t turn out completely correct, but --\nand I was a little concerned, I -- you know, it -- I heard about the United States for\nthe first time in more detail when I worked for the American embassy where I also\nworked. I forgot to tell you. Oh yes, I did tell you. And it was frightening, was a\nlong way away. It was a long, long way away and I thought that 1t was going to be\nstrange, but I saw the Hollywood films and I thought that couldn\u2019t be like that.\nTurned out it was, almost, you know, and people had three cars in the family, I\nthought they were lying, but that\u2019s how it 1s, they do. We do. And the thing that\nstruck me about the United States was how beautiful it was. And they never --\nAmericans who travel abroad never tell you how beautiful America is, they just\ncomplain. And the vastness of it. Th-The -- the size, th-the width and th-the breadth\nof it, 1t\u2019s just amazing because we come from Europe, small countries, you know,\nyou go for a few ki-kilometers and you\u2019re at the border of one country and another\ncountry. And in the States you can travel for days and days and days and you can\nstill be in the same country. And also the fact that whether it\u2019s pal -- Palo Alto or\nWashington, you can go to a store and get the same product, which is -- as I said, it\nwas kind of strange for me, I d -- not -- not expected that. Life was very nice, all the\nmachines that I never would have thought of. Never dreamt I would have a car, that\nJune 3, 2002\nmy most valued possession. And altogether the Americans are much nicer than the\nBritish, they\u2019re much friendlier. And it\u2019s easy to make yourself a little niche and to\nlive happily in your corner. It\u2019s true there\u2019s a lot of other problems in the States, but\nyou don\u2019t have to be involved. In the smaller country I think you -- you -- you --\nwilly nilly you\u2019ve got to be involved. But in the United States, you live in beautiful\nBethesda or beautiful Palo Alto and you can forget about the other parts. Not nice\nmaybe, but after what we\u2019ve been through we felt very -- I felt very relieved and --\nand I needed the rest from all the problems. So that was nice. We had other\nstruggles because we had, obviously, to make a living, and my son went to school,\nand that was alright. He learned English very, very fast, so that was not a problem.\nBut life was not easy, but it was more comfortable.",
        "A: Yeah, the Americans did, especially, you know, when I first got to Palo Alto\nthey did. I told them my story, they want to know about my hand, yes. And I told\nthem. In fact, in Palo Alto our group of friends were -- were doctors and one of\nthem was a plastic surgeon. And that was the other time when they -- he offered to\ndo something on my hand. And it was going to be a very interesting project, he was\ngoing to do it for free. He was going to si -- take my little -- what was left of my\nJune 3, 2002\nlittle finger and transplant it to make a thumb out of it, and then cover my -- all the\ninside of the hand, the palm. It was going to take a couple of years to do it because I\nhad to -- it was grafting -- grafting was going to take all this time and I was not\ngoing to be able to do anything at home. My husband was not at all for it. But even\nI felt that I -- I said to him, if he could give me back my hand as it was, I would do\nit, but not if it\u2019s going to give me something else new to -- to get used to and to\nlearn how to use. It\u2019s been too long that I\u2019ve known how to use my hand as it is. I\u2019m\nnot suffering. I probably can\u2019t play the piano, but that\u2019s about all I can think that I\ncan\u2019t do. So at that point in my -- in my life, was not worth it and I backed out. But\nhe did try. And I did tell people. They listened to the story, they weren't -- 1t wasn\u2019t\ngoi -- a big deal, but -- but I did tell them the story, yes.",
        "A: Not really, I went to work. I had to work. I did learn a lot on the jobs. I really\nlearned a lot on the jobs and I went -- got better and better jobs in the office, and yes\n-- and I -- I -- I did very well, I got to be administration director and hired and fired\npeople, and that was good, I just wished that I\u2019d gone back to school, but I had a\nchild and I had to babysit him, sort of thing and my husband just didn\u2019t want to do\nthat for me so I missed out -- out on that a little bit.\nJune 3, 2002",

        "A: No. I mean, my first child Dov was born in Israel and he has Down\u2019s syndrome.\nAnd he is the one who is now in a -- in a special school, it\u2019s a special place in\nEngland. And my second son was born in Reading, England because mainly, my\nhusband had an offer to go to try for the BBC job at the time I was pregnant, and I\nwas only too pleased to get out because I was still worried about my birth, because\nof the first experience, that I wanted to be everything different and every --\nsomewhere else. So we agreed to go for a year to England and that\u2019s where I gave\nbirth to Joe, in Reading, England.",
        "A: Oh yes. Never, never kept it from him. It wasn\u2019t much of interest to him perhaps\nto begin with, but then he started when he was in school, he did a paper, he\ninterviewed me and did a paper on me, so he was always aware of -- of my\nexperiences. And asked them questions definitely, but 1t was never a secret, so I\ndon\u2019t think he ever felt that he had to pry things out of me. If he asked I answered. I\nJune 3, 2002\nhad nothing really dramatic to tell him except the horror of the whole thing, but I\nwasn\u2019t in a camp, I wasn\u2019t tortured. My hand happened, but it happened, it didn\u2019t --\nwasn\u2019t somebody, you know, cutting me up. So my -- I always felt that my story\nwas not too horrifying for anybody to listen to.",

        "A: Oh yes, my sister, my sweet little sister, she was a baby two months old when\nthe war broke out and my mother and I always took care of her. And she was very,\nvery ill during the war. In fact, my mother thought she would not survive even after\nthe war, because she was -- she was like skin and bones.

And it was very upsetting to me to have to say that I wasn\u2019t,\nand I was very happy to come back to it, but I am not religious. And having lived in\nIsrael, I feel I have somehow become Jewish and I can -- I don\u2019t have to feel guilty\nabout that any more. But I do not like rituals. And I do feel very close to the Jews,\nto my brethren. I don\u2019t mind going to the synagogue, but I don\u2019t like preaching and\nI don\u2019t like rituals, so it\u2019s a bit of a tug of war within me.\nJune 3, 2002",
        "A: Well, we were all afraid. We were afraid of the Soviet Union. We knew that\nthey wouldn\u2019t le-leave voluntarily, wouldn\u2019t give up places voluntarily. When they\nwalked into Poland my mother said, they are not leaving. She knew. I mean, again I\nhave to quote her because I was too young to understand. And we were afraid when\nKennedy gave the ultimatum about removing the missiles in Cuba. My husband\nsaid it was a terrible thing. I didn\u2019t know what to think. I know I was afraid. I didn\u2019t\nexpect the outcome as it -- 1t was when the wa -- Berlin wall fell down. And the\nonly thing I have to say about that is I was afraid about Germany getting too strong\nagain, when the wa-wa-wall came down. That was -- I knew definitely that I was\nafraid. And I was afraid of Russia, yes. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a -- still afraid, because they are\nnot in a very good situation and there\u2019s too much crime there.

        "A: Not really. The only one if I have is that the Jews helped the Civil Rights, I do\nknow that. And then we got kicked in the teeth and they didn\u2019t really appreciate it\nand there was a lot of anti-Semitism coming from the black community, which hurt,\nbecause they\u2019re always trying to help others who are in the bad situation and\nJune 3, 2002\nunfortunately don\u2019t get any thanks for it.

        "A: The recolatio -- recollections I have is because we both worked with American\nembassy. The Americans were trying to -- to promote and to present the side on\nVietnam war to the Israelis. And I believed what I heard. I did not really have my\nown opinion since I wasn\u2019t living in the States at the time. And later on I\nunderstood, but at the time I was all for what the American was doing -- what the\nAmericans were doing and I thought communism was a great, great threat. So at the\ntime yes, I did believe that, but now I realize that it wasn\u2019t so, that there was a\ndifferent way to deal with it, that it should have been.

I had a couple experiences -- well, I had a very cute experiences at work\nwhere a lady was mad, a -- a colleague was mad at somebody because they was --\nkept bugging her on the phone and she slammed the phone down saying, that Jew.\nAnd then looked at me and, oh Halina, I didn't mean it, I didn\u2019t mean it. And then\ntwo weeks later she said, you know, I\u2019ve got to go have an operation, I have a\nwonderful Jewish doctor. So that was -- but from then on, you know, I understood\nwhere -- she was a redneck, so I -- I -- I guess that that was part of it. I know there\nare people who are not particularly keen on Jews, but we have lots of friends who\nare not Jewish and who like us, so n-n-no -- no other problems.",
        "A: Yes. I got divorced in 1972, I believe. We had problems for awhile, and hoping\nthat the United States will help us, but -- moving away from families, but it didn\u2019t\nwork. So when my husband decided to go abroad on a mission, he went -- he went\ninto the foreign service. And that was the time when we really broke up, because he\nwas going to Yugoslavia then, and there was no American school in Yugoslavia, so\nit would have meant that I had to send my son to an American school in Italy or in\nIsrael and I would have to go to Yugoslavia with him and I certainly couldn\u2019t --\ncouldn\u2019t have done that. So that was the breaking point, and so we divorced. And he\nwent off to Yugoslavia and I stayed here with my son, and eventually met\nsomebody very nice, name of Richard Peabody, whose mother happens to be\nJewish, in fact. And so I wasn\u2019t so worried, because being from Poland and having\nheard that you should not marry out of your religion even if you\u2019re not religious, I\nfigured he couldn\u2019t call me a dirty Jew anyway, because he was one, technically\nanyway. And we\u2019ve been married for the last 20 years, very happily and I hope we\ncontinue for another 20.",

I\u2019ve got a button, if\nyou push it\u2019ll just come out. I\u2019ve talked to a couple of schools here and there and I\nalways feel that perhaps my story is not sufficiently big to -- to -- to -- just for the\nwhole lecture, so I always like to take somebody else with me, and -- but I have no\nproblem in telling it, and -- and I do.
