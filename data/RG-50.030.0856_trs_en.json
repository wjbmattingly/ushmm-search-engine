And the family was quite religious, and they would go to church, we would\ngo to church on Sundays. Not every Sunday though. I don\u2019t remember. And she was\n\u2014 she wore long clothes.

        "Q: Well, it sounds very nice, it sounds very warm.",
        "A: Yes. The family was very close. They visited on the holidays, they visited each\nother in other farms. And it was a good time, I mean. My father, as they say, was\nsent to \u2014 to the \u2014 to school, and then he went to the 1918 Lithuanian independence,\nhe fought with the Lithuanian\u2019s army, the partisans. And then he worked \u2014 he was\nin the army, and then he was \u2014 so he did not farm.",

And since then later on, when I was now nine, te \u2014 eight, nine,\nI used to take books out of the libraries, since my mother ended up working in the\nlibrary there in \u2014 in Skarviskes(ph).",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: In Jaimalas(ph) actually, in Jaimalas(ph). I would go and take books out, and\nsometimes I would take books out that were not appropriate to my age, and I would\nread them, hiding.",
        "Q: Oh really?",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "Q: So he was translated into Lithuanian?",
        "A: He was translated into Lithuanian, he was quite popular, and I read the books, I\nremember. We used to play Indians.",
        "Q: Did you? Well, it\u2019s interesting, because a whole generation of people \u2014 I have\nheard him mentioned before by some of the people I\u2019ve interviewed who are from\nGermany, and they would remember Karl May, reading him as they were growing\nup, as well. And we never heard of \u2014 here in the United States, it was not part of\nour childhood, not part of the books that we would remember, you know. Let\u2019s turn\na little bit now to your father and your mother. You say your father was \u2014 was\nfighting in the 1918 war for independence, 1s that right?",
        "A: That\u2019s what I understand, 1915 - 1918.December 10, 2015",

        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. It was of value for them. How do you \u2014",
        "A: They weren\u2019t \u2014 they weren\u2019t marching anywhere, but they certainly \u2014",
        "Q: How would you desc \u2014 you know, when someone says someone 1s nationalistic,\ndifferent images come to mind.",
        "A: What images \u2014",
        "Q: How would it express itself?",
        "A: Okay. They liked the fact that there were Lithuanian schools, that their children\nwere taught Lithuanian reading and writing, because rem \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\nknow it, but under the tsar\u2019s occupation, it was forbidden to print books in\nLithuanian.",
        "Q: And they all remembered this, then?",
        "A: I remember the stories about it, I mean \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.December 10, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 it was before my time, but I remember people talking about \u2014 the stories about\nit, that you had. And we were even taught it, explained to us that they used to print\nbooks in Lithuanian, across the border in Prussia, and smuggle them into\nLithuania. And that\u2019s how they had books, Lithuanian books in their villages.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And you could be punished very severely by the tsar\u2019s agents if they found out\nthat you had Lithuanian books. But \u2014 so, there was this feeling that now they cannot\ntell us. We have our own books, our own government. I don\u2019t think anybody was\ntoo interested in how the government ran, or what was happening. They \u2014 their lives\nconcentrated on their farm, on their families, on the weather.",
        "Q: Cause this \u2014 it affects the farm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s it. But, as I say, they would not have \u2014 they would never have welp \u2014\nwelcomed any foreign country taking Lithuania over.",
        "Q: Well, some people will call that patriotic, not necessarily nationalist. That\ndefinition of it, that people find themselves to be patriots of their own country, and\nwilling to defend it.",
        "A: Well, defend it \u2014 it\u2019s interesting how it happened, from what I remember.December 10, 2015",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Again, keeping in mind that I was now talking about the first thing that happened\nwas the Russians coming in.",
        "Q: Are we talking now about World War II, or World War I?",
        "A: Two.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I-I in \u20141n 1918, Lithuania became separate. The Russian \u2014 the tsars were\ndefeated. The \u2014 now I\u2019m talking because I learned about it, not because \u2014 1t was\nmuch discussed in my family, because that was way before.",
        "Q: Got it.",
        "A: Nobody would sit down and \u2014 we didn\u2019t have TV or radios. We did have a radio.\nNobody listened to it so much, except operas. But what I learned later on, after the\ncommunists took over Russia government, and then stopped a war, Lithuanians\ndeclared independence.",
        "Q: We\u2019re talking 1917 - 1918.",
        "A: 1917-1918.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: 1918. And my father fought then.",
        "Q: Got it.\nDecember 10, 2015",
        "A: To get that \u2014 everybody out of Lithuania, he was in the army then.",
        "Q: So, what year was he born, do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Hm\u2019?",
        "Q: What year was your father born?",
        "A: What year was my father born? I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know. Okay.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Do you know how old \u2014",
        "A: He must have been then \u2014 he must have been then in his early 20s.",
        "Q: When \u2014 in \u2014 so, in 1917 - 1918?",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Okay. So he would have been born in the 1890s.",
        "A: Probably.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. And tell me a little bit about how did your parents meet? Do you\nknow about this?",
        "A: I have heard \u2014 I have heard about it. I don\u2019t know quite how it happened, but my\nmother used to tell stories that she m \u2014 they \u2014 they met somewhere no-not in \u2014 not\nwhere the farms were.",
        "Q: Okay.December 10, 2015",
        "A: Not in Jaimalas(ph). Somewhere \u2014 I\u2019m trying to remember. Where could have it\nbeen? Panev\u00e9zys maybe \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 or Kupishkis. Anyway, my father showed up there. My mother was in \u2014 lived\nin that area, and she actually was dating somebody, and that friend of hers was not \u2014\nshe found out he was cheating on her. Again, my mother tells the story. And so, she\ngot mad at him and married my father, to spite him.",
        "Q: So your father was a \u2014 a rebound?",
        "A: He was a rebound, and it was not a happy marriage.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: It was not a happy marriage.",
        "Q: In what ways?",
        "A: Well, my mother felt that my fath-father never accomplished much, that he was\nnot ambitious enough, that he was sort of happy-go-lucky person, and that she made\na mistake marrying him.",
        "Q: Did you children used to hear that?",
        "A: She would talk about it to her friends, and I would hear that.",
        "Q: I see.December 10, 2015",
        "A: She did not talk it \u2014 about it to me, or \u2014 or any of us children, but she would talk\nto her friends about it. And \u2014 sometimes \u2014 and \u2014 and that\u2019s how I heard about it.",
        "Q: Did they argue?",
        "A: Yes, they argued. What did they argue about? Money. I think my father probably\nhad a relationship with somebody, and my mother just simply did not have much\nrespect for my father.",
        "Q: Ooh.",
        "A: They just \u2014 it j \u2014 it just was not a happy couple.",
        "Q: Where \u2014 was the atmosphere then, much different in your home \u2014",
        "A: It was not happy atmosphere in my house, no.",
        "Q: Yeah. But it \u2014 so it\u2019s a big contrast to when you would go spend the summer in\nyour grandmother and uncle\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They do not abuse each other openly, or in front of us, and was not much\narguing. But they just was \u2014 I think in some ways, my father loved my mother, but\nhe just never measured up to her expectations.",
        "Q: Now, you described what she thought of him, what did \u2014 how would you\ncharacterize your parents\u2019 personalities?December 10, 2015",
        "A: He was \u2014 my father was easygoing, I would say. And I think he really loved my\nmother. It\u2019s just that she did not really love him, and he could just not measure up to\nwhat she expected of him.",
        "Q: That\u2019s pretty harsh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s pretty harsh.",
        "A: Yeah. So it was not \u2014 it was not a happy marriage. And they were both very\ncaring, as far as we were concerned, the children. But \u2014",
        "Q: Were you closer to one, or to the other?",
        "A: I think as a little girl, I probably leaned more \u2014 more towards my mother, but not\nreally, because they were wise enough to never, in front of us, bring their troubles,\nbring their dis-disputes, and try to tell us, oh, he is not good, or she is not good.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They never did that.",
        "Q: Okay. So it would be what you had overheard, and just the general sense \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s what I were \u2014 that\u2019s what I overhear, that he is not ambitious enough, that\nhe is not really supporting his family the way he should, that he is not working hard\nenough. Mostly that was coming from my mother. I never, ever heard my father\ntalking against my mother, never.December 10, 2015",
        "Q: What kind of personality did your mother have?",
        "A: My mother?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Hard.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Tough.",
        "Q: How did that express itself?",
        "A: Well, my father was much more open and loving and fun, where I don\u2019t\nremember my mother playing with us much. I mean, she made sure that we looked\nas good as possible. When you see that photograph, we are wearing beautiful, red\nvelvet outfits, with my brother. I remember the \u2014 they would \u2014 expected me to do\nwell in school, when I started going to school. But I would say my mother was not\nvery affectionate, whereas my father was. My \u2014 my father would not \u2014 would \u2014 was\nnot much of a disciplinary person, and he was not much of a \u2014 he was very\neasygoing.",
        "Q: So in some ways, all of this fell to your mother. She \u2014 she \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 needed \u2014 she had to do all of the hard work.",
        "A: Yes, yes, she did.December 10, 2015",
        "Q: Tell me \u2014",
        "A: And she got that \u2014 she got that job. She did not work all the time, as I remember,\nbut she did get a job running that library, because they did need the income.",
        "Q: Got it. Tell me how that library looked. Can you describe the building?",
        "A: The library?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Sure. I loved that library. I still love libraries, though I can\u2019t read now without\nmy g\u2014 machine. And it was on a corner of street, and market square, in the middle\nof the \u2014 of that town, there was a square where the \u2014 they would hold market days.\nThey would have a market day, and the farmers from the area would come and sell\neggs, they sometimes had animals to sell to other farmers, even horses. And they\nwould sell all kinds of farm produce, garden stuff. And on that square \u2014 I mean, on\nthat open place, there was a Jewish bakery at one \u2014 on one side, I remember, and on\nthe other side, on the corner was the library. Steps in, one story. My mother\u2019s desk\nthere, and bookcases in the \u2014 in the room. I don\u2019t think there was a \u2014 there were \u2014\nwas no second floor.",
        "Q: Okay, so was one room library.",
        "A: Yeah, but fairly large room.",
        "Q: Okay.December 10, 2015",
        "A: I mean like the whole floor.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And you could \u2014 you took the books out and brought it to their desk, and how\nshe marked them, maybe wrote it in by hand. That so and so took this book.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I-I think so, because I would take them out whatever I \u2014 whenever I decided\nto go and browse around. So that was my [indecipherable]. And I remember I\nwould ask my mother to give me 10 cents, and I would go to the Jewish bakery, and\nbuy a sweet.",
        "Q: Oh. What ki \u2014 do you had \u2014 did you have a favorite sweet?",
        "A: I know exactly what kind of a sweet. It\u2019s a \u2014 made from what we call now\ngingerbre \u2014 bread. But it was made in a shape of a mushroom, and it had icing on\ntop. And that\u2019s what I will get. That was my sweet. And it was \u2014 you know, it was\nvery eas \u2014 easy life. There was no other buildings in town that I remember, down,\naway from there, was a very nice Lutheran church.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about Jaimalai(ph) now?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And Jaimalai(ph), can you f\u2014 can you place it for me geographically? You said\nit was close to the Latvian border?December 10, 2015",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And would it have been in Samogitia Zemaitija, or would it have been in\nAukStaitija?",
        "A: I think it was farther west. I think it\u2019s must be AukStaitija.",
        "Q: You think it\u2019s AukStaitija? Okay. We\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll eventually take a look on the\nmap and see.",
        "A: Yeah, uh-huh.",
        "Q: Was it a large town?",
        "A: No, small town.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I te\u2014 when I st-started reading, really continued reading as an adult, and started\nreading Chekhov, it reminded me of some of Chekov\u2019s stories.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Your town, Jaimalai(ph).",
        "A: Yeah. Little, provincial town. Was nothing there. Had a train station, but that\nwas about it. I mean, there were no \u2014 the big \u2014 the big heads in that town were the\nmayor \u2014 I used to play with the daughter, mayor\u2019s daughter now and then, and I\nused to go to her house to play, too, and she had a very fancy house. And then thereDecember 10, 2015\nwas the chief of police. The wife of the chief of police was my \u2014 my sister\u2019s\ngodmother. And for \u2014 I remember one Christmas, she gave my sister this beautiful\ndoll that had eyes that closed up. And I never had anything like that, so I was very\njealous. I was very jealous of my sister to begin with.",
        "Q: And why 1s that?",
        "A: Because everybody said, oh what a beautiful child, oh my gosh. And up to then,\neverybody said I was beautiful. My sister arrived, suddenly she was beautiful.",
        "Q: The nerve. The nerve.",
        "A: The nerve, exactly. So who is she, this little, bitty thing?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So actually, it took us a very long time, though she, when she was growing up,\nshe said she adored me.",

        "A: Yeah, she had this doll, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: In \u2014 you mentioned the Jewish bakery where you would get some sweets, and\nthat brings me to a question that I had. In Plung\u00e9, where \u2014 when you would visit\nyour \u2014 well, it was outside of Plung\u00e9, but when you would visit your grandmother\nBarbara, and your father\u2019s family, was it all Lithuanian, or were there other\npeoples?",

I don\u2019t \u2014 I think somebody arrived in that town, and he\nhad a position as a banker maybe, or even a lawyer, and I remember my mother\nsaid, well, I \u2014 she had a dinner party, and she had this man included with her\nfriends. And she said, and I served pork. She said, I did not know he was Jewish, I\nserved pork. But she said, well, he ate it.",

        "A: And it probably was garlic.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: Spices that we did not use. We lived in rented apartments in Jaimalas(ph), we\ndid not have a house. We lived in an attractive rented apartment, and then we left\nthat, I think when the Russians came. I don\u2019t \u2014 something went on in the family, I\ndon\u2019t know, but we moved out of there and moved in sort of very rundown place, I\nwould even say.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: There was \u2014 at least for a while, we did. And we hardly ever but \u2014 ever used it. I\ncouldn\u2019t call anybody, I think. The farms did not have telephones. Post office,\npolice office, a-and to me the police seemed to be \u2014 chief of police seemed to be\nmuch bigger shot than my father. I don\u2019t know why. I think maybe they lived\nsomewhat better than \u2014 than my family. I don\u2019t think they had any children. The\ntownspeople basically had their friendships in their own social class. They had their\njobs. There were no demonstrations of any kind.",
        "Q: No political demonstrations.",

        "A: That there would be a parade, my father would be dressed in his uniform, and\nmaybe even carry the s-sword. I don\u2019t remember, but it was definitely \u2014 the schools\nwould be closed, and there would be sp \u2014 speeches, and very often cold, and\nmiserable.",
        "Q: Yes.",

        "A: We were not a very religious family.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Sometimes \u2014 all the children were baptized. I was prepared to go to communion,\nfirst communion, and I remember my mother had a very pretty white dress made for\nme, but no sleeves. Just little straps, flowers. And \u2014 but there was no celebration at\nhome at all for that. And my father did not live with us any more.",
        "Q: Oh, so did your fa \u2014 parents sep \u2014",
        "A: My father, at one point, I can\u2019t quite remember, got a job somewhere else. That\nmust have been when the Russians came, or maybe even before that. But he moved\nout into an ad-adjoining town, and had a job there. And he would come and visit us.December 10, 2015\nBut my mother was basically in charge of the family, and pretty much probably, of\nfamily finances. So he did go into [indecipherable] some way, I unders \u2014 my\nunderstanding was. And \u2014",
        "Q: It sounds like a separation.",
        "A: Yeah, kind of. And then, as far as the town goes, there were no cars. Everybody\nwould come and went there with sleighs, horses and sleighs. And we kids would\nlove to run after the sleighs, get hold of the back of the sleigh and go for a ride,\nwhich was very dangerous, because you could fall down and be trampled by other\nhorses, so you had \u2014 you were not allowed to do it, you had to sneak out to do it.\nAnd was very safe. I mean, I was never afraid that somebody will steal something\nfrom me, or beat me up, or what \u2014",
        "Q: Did people talk about political things? Did they talk about what was go \u2014",
        "A: I am sure that some of them did. Nobody talked in my family much about\npolitical things.",
        "Q: What was your father\u2019s job at the \u2014 when he was border police? What did that\ninvolve?",
        "A: That involved, as all borders have, patrols. At least at that time, I\u2019m sure they do\nnow. And he was in charge of that \u2014 of a stretch of a border, in charge of the patrols.\nI guess he would ride out. He had a beautiful horse, I remember that. Lila was herDecember 10, 2015\nname. And he would ride out there and check on the patrols, I suppose. I think now\nand then, maybe every six months, or once a year, some kind of a superiors would\narrive, and he had prison documents. I remember it because my mother would fill\nthese documents out for him at the last minute, so everything looked okay. That\u2019s\nwhat I understood.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But he didn\u2019t have to be out there anywhere \u2014 or every day, all day, or what.",
        "Q: Did he have an office?",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t have any office.",

        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So before he found a job in another town, he hung around the house?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Or he was away, inspecting the borders.",
        "Q: Okay. Did you ever join him doing that?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.December 10, 2015",
        "A: But I remember him bringing in er \u2014 in spring bringing a packet made of birch\nbark, full with first wild strawberries.",
        "Q: Oh, that must have been nice.",
        "A: Tiny little strawberries, they are [indecipherable]",

        "A: Zemuog\u00e9s.",
        "Q: Yeah. When you used to visit your grandmother, how did you get there?",
        "A: Horses. Someone from the farm would come and pick us up.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And then bring you there.",
        "A: That\u2019s the way they picked us up. When my mother \u2014 I mean, my father came to\nJaimalas(ph), showed up in Jaimalas(ph) because, from what I hear, there were\nrumors that he\u2019s run \u2014 ran away, and he was afraid that they will \u2014 family will be\npunished, so he showed up. And then there were rumors going on that things are not\ngoing to be good. Something\u2019s going to happen. So \u2014",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking now at what point? Still \u2014",
        "A: 738.",

        "Q: Really? So when he was living far away, you know \u2014 not far away, in the\nadjoining town \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 but separately \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 there \u2014 there were rumors going on that things were not going to be good?",
        "A: The Russians were there.",
        "Q: Oh, so that\u2019s already when the Russians were there.",
        "A: Yeah, the Russians were \u2014 the communist regime was already there.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I can tell you about what I know about them.",

        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: \u2014 let\u2019s \u2014 you started to talk about the Soviet occupation, and before we get into\nwhat happened during it, I\u2019d like to step back just before, and ask about when did\nthings change, and how did things change? That is, here you live in independent\nLithuania. By 1938, you\u2019re already a nine year old girl. And August 7\", if youDecember 10, 2015\nwere born, in 1938, you\u2019d be nine and August 7\", 1939, you\u2019d be 10.

        "A: Right, right, right.",
        "Q: And I\u2019m sure that nobody \u2014 but I\u2019m leading you here, maybe it\u2019s true that people\ndid know about it, but from what I have heard, most people didn\u2019t know about this\npact that they had signed.",
        "A: I have no idea because, as I say, we did not discuss family \u2014 in my family,\npolitics or \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014I think in \u2014 in \u2014I\u2014 I\u2019m sure that some people who followed, knew about that,\nbut we did not listen to the radio.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We had no information, and I never heard about anything. I just knew that the\nRussians took over Lithuania, and that our President Smetona ran away. And there\nwas some kind of \u2014 some gossip going around, no fight, nothing, he just left. Which\nwas a disgrace.",
        "Q: Okay. So \u2014",
        "A: There \u2014 there were even some \u2014 some little songs [indecipherable] made about\nSmetona running away.December 10, 2015",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. So that was something that was \u2014",
        "A: That was already when the Germans came in.",
        "Q: I see. Okay \u2014",
        "A: But first we have to deal with the Russians. So what I heard about Russian\noccupation, I had not \u2014 in Jaimalas(ph), I haven\u2019t seen any police, or \u2014 I mean,\nsoldiers coming in, or anything. The library was running like it did before, no\nchange.",
        "Q: What about school?",
        "A: Huh?December 10, 2015",
        "Q: What about school?",
        "A: Schools were running, however they brought in an organization called\n[indecipherable] pioneers.",
        "Q: Okay. So the \u2014 did your teachers change? Did new teachers come in?",
        "A: No, the same teachers. And I think there could have been classes about\ncommunism, and how the common man was \u2014 there were \u2014 there were probably\nsome people in town who liked the idea that 1t was \u2014 everybody\u2019s going to be equal\ntype of a thing, but I don\u2019t know. I do know that the farmers were very concerned,\nbecause they were required by the gub \u2014 by the government now, to deliver so much\nfood, grains of all kinds, maybe even animals to their government. For which they\ngot paid, but very little. So slowly \u2014 you know, depending how much land you had,\nit looked like slowly you will have to sell it \u2014 to leave it, because you will not able\nto \u2014 to have enough to deliver to the government. And after that, they would start\nbuilding kolhauses(ph). Kolhauses(ph) is a farm that the land belongs to the state,\nand everybody works there, for the state. So that was going along, and \u2014 but as far\nas my life, or I would say, my mother\u2019s life, did not change. She still worked in the\nlibrary. I still went to school.",
        "Q: Your father still did his job?December 10, 2015",
        "A: My father just was nowhere to be seen. He ha \u2014 I don\u2019t even know if he had a\njob of any sort.",
        "Q: He just wasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: He wasn\u2019t there. I do remember that once he showed up to \u2014 just to make sure\nthat everybody saw him, that he was still alive, and there, and \u2014 and then di \u2014\ndisappeared again. And then just before the deport \u2014 huge deportation was staged,\nhe came home, and I have a feeling that the people knew, or sensed, or heard\nsomething, that something is going to happen. So, my father or my mother, I\u2019m not\nsure who, got in touch with my \u2014 my uncles, and they came, and they picked us\nthree up.",

I believe there were also rumors that \u2014 I mean, the Russians,\nor the \u2014 the Soviets started demanding more and more from the farmers. They\nprobably demanded something from the stores \u2014 store owners, or other people. It\njust \u2014 obviously that the population was feeling uneasy.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: The week later, the war started, yes. So we were taken out to the farms, and I ha\n\u2014 so the \u2014 I think the population felt that some \u2014 there were rumors, there were\nprobably spies, there were some kind of information floating around that the Soviets\nwill be pushed out, an-and the Germans will come and push the germ \u2014 the Soviets\nout, and everybody felt ve \u2014 I think most people probably felt oh well, that\u2019s good.December 10, 2015\nLet\u2019s get rid of the Soviets. At least the Germans are religious. So that was it. So\nwhen they took us to the farm, I did not think anything of it. Now, I tell you the one\nthing. Once I \u2014 once we got there, after staying with my uncles for about a week, we\nwere taken away from my uncles, our uncles distributed the three of us to different\nfarmers around.",
        "Q: Family members, or not?",
        "A: No, not even family members. I don\u2019t know where my brother was, or my sister.\nI know that I was with some people who I could have met, but they were not family\nmembers, and I just stayed there, and I did not know why. I thought maybe because\nthe war was coming, because at one point, the family had even a \u2014 a kind of earth\ntunnel built, or something, that you could go in, if the bombs start falling, if they\nstart shooting around.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about this family that you were with?",
        "A: No, don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t even remember their name.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But, you know, they were kind to me, they were good to me. They did not \u2014 they\ndid not tell me what was going on, they just said, you know, my brother was\nsomewhere else. I wanted to be with my brother and sister, mainly my brother.",
        "Q: Yeah.December 10, 2015",
        "A: And I \u2014 IJ-I just didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: So that was the one unusual thing. It was not unusual that you would go with\nyour uncles to the farms, but it was unusual that you\u2019d be split up.",
        "A: That we were taken from my uncles, to the different farms.",
        "Q: So \u2014",
        "A: And then, at one point, when the Germans came, we were taken to another farm,\nanother uncle. And finally, we were \u2014 all three of us got to gi \u2014 together again.",

You had to send through some kind\nof organization that was connected with the Soviet regime, that would allow the\nstuff to go in. We send, basically, yard goods, of all kinds, so she could trade them\nfor food. She had acquired a tiny house in that town, that belonged, actually, to my\naunt \u2014 to my took \u2014 to Ona(ph), my father\u2019s sister.",

        "A: Some. Some. She \u2014 she arrived in Chicago \u2014 I then lived in Columbia,\nMissouri, and I came to Chicago with my three children, and stayed at my sister\u2019s.\nMy brother came in. He lived down in Kansas | \u2014 I think in Kansas already. And\nhis wife, and we all went to the airport to meet her. I remember it was \u2014 must have\nbeen close to Christmas. I stayed there for a while, and then I went to the apartment,December 10, 2015\nbecause my baby was sick, and I couldn\u2019t stay out there. I had to go then \u2014 to my \u2014\nto the apartment. So, this is what my sisters told me, she said, when she got off \u2014\nout of the plane, we somehow, all of us recognized her. But we also knew that once\nshe was able to fly out of Russia, and fly to Switzerland, that when she got to\nSwitzerland, we knew she was safe. So that\u2019s \u2014 what she told about the camps, she\nsaid actually, first she was kept in prison, and was interrogated, and was badly\nbeaten up, and they wanted to get names of other partisans, partisans that were\ninvolved. And she said she didn\u2019t tell them anything. So she then ended in camps\nway out the Altai mountains. And it was very difficult. She had had, at one point,\nsome training as a nurse. So for a while, she actually helped out in one camp, as a\nnurse, and she caught TB. She almost died. And then they \u2014 they worked in the\nfields, and she said sometimes the peasants from the area would leave packages of\nfood in the fields for them, for the prisoners, because they knew they were starving.\nShe said by that time, a cat appeared in the camp. We knew that we lived much\nbetter, because nobody ate the cat.",

        "A: And of course, she did not get anything \u2014 didn\u2019t hear anything from us, from \u2014\nabout her family. And then she served 15 years, as she was required apparently, her\npunishment was to serve 15 years, so she did. And then they said, the authorities\ntold her that she can stay if she wants to, and work as an \u2014 a nurse, or so \u2014 and they\nwill pay her. But she said no, she wanted to go back home. And so she \u2014 she went\nback ho \u2014 back to Lithuania.",
        "Q: So that \u2014 if she w \u2014 was there for 15 years, that means it would have been 1956\nthat she would have been released from her servitude.",

        "Q: And \u2014 and went back to Lithuania in the mid-50s, or right after that.",

        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember that. I don\u2019t remember that. I knew that she\nwas ni\u2014 not a happy women when she \u2014 when I was growing up, but partly was \u2014\nthat was sort of that she and Father did not get along. But no, you know, I really\ndon\u2019t remember my mother laughing, smile, or really meeting anybody with great\njoy. It just \u2014 there was something in her character that \u2014 of course the deportation,\nand the \u2014 the arrests and all that, were difficult, but some of that inner sadness was\nalways there, and I don\u2019t know what for. Now my father was very different.",

        "A: Yeah, yeah.December 10, 2015",
        "Q: Yeah. Thank you for sharing this. I think we\u2019ll take a break now. [break]\nAll right. So, before the break, we were talking about what had happened your \u2014\nwith your mother, what her destiny was, and one thing that I wanted to see if we\ncould bring some clarity to, would have been, what was the reason for her\ndeportation? Why would she have been taken? Can you supply any explanation for\nthat?",
        "A: I do not have any specific informations. What I heard people talking about, that\nthere were more people \u2014 she was not the only one from the town that was taken,\nthere were more people taken from that town. I think the mayor of the town, and his\nfamily. And 1-1f it \u2014 it\u2019s strange \u2014 strange coincidence, one of the daughters, small\ndaughter of that family, was staying with her grandparents in the village, and she\nwas left.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So everybody was taken in the family, but her. And she grew up and actually\ncame to United States. And from the people there was a feeling that they were\ntrying to pick up better educated people, and probably people that might have been\na problem. I had never heard anything said that my mother would have been picked\nup because of my father. I haven\u2019t heard that at all.December 10, 2015",
        "Q: Why would she then, have been picked up? If not because of your father, what\nwould be the \u2014 the reason?",
        "A: But I think it\u2019s nobody was given any reason. They just showed up and said you\nare going, period. That is my understanding. There were all these people, they\u2019re\ntaken from \u2014 from this town, and it was a massive deportation all across the\ncountry. People were taken from other cities, too, and shipped straight out to \u2014 to \u2014\nto Soviet Union. And much later on, one of my uncles and his family were\ndeported. That was during the 40s.",
        "Q: After the war?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes. When the Russians stayed in Lithuania.",
        "Q: Okay. So there was no \u2014 your mother had a feeling \u2014",
        "A: There was no \u2014 there was no specific charge. It was not like somebody showed\nup and said okay, you\u2019ve wrote this pamphlet, or your belong to this group, and\nthat\u2019s why you will have to go.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They \u2014 from what happened to my mother probably happened to very many\npeople. Very often I heard those stories that they separated small children from their\nDecember 10, 2015\nparents, and some of these very tiny children were given away to Russian families\nto raise.",
        "Q: Oh really?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if that is true. I really don\u2019t know. And as far as I was concerned,\nthe way I found out, I told you how I found out about it, nobody ever explained to\nme why she was taken. He just said there were a pla \u2014 many other people taken.",
        "Q: Do you remember missing her?",
        "A: Oh, I miss her terribly. The \u2014 everybody \u2014 I mean, my sister was tiny still, she\nwas seven years \u2014 she\u2019s seven years younger. So my sister, she said that \u2014 she told\nme much later, now actually, that for a long time she thought maybe she did\nsomething, that\u2019s why the mother was gone.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And it\u2019s just one of these things that happened. And, in a strange way though,\nnow of course, I would question it \u2014 if anything that \u2014 like that would happen, or\nsimilar, I would be questioning everywhere. But at that time I was small, the war\nwas going on, and nobody \u2014 and never asked any questions. I never asked any\nquestions, and nobody explained to me.",
        "Q: So, your \u2014 at that \u2014 even up until the time your mother was taken, you had never\nseen any Soviet soldiers?\nDecember 10, 2015",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. But soon after that, there was a German attack, a Nazi attack on the Soviet\nUnion, and now Lithuania was a part of the Soviet Union. How did that \u2014 how did\nyou ex \u2014 do you remember that happening?",
        "A: I was then not staying with my fa \u2014 with any of my family. We were separated,\nthe three children, and I was staying with some other people. And then eventually\nheard that the Russians left, and the Germans came, and as far as I was concerned,\nand the people around me were glad to see Germans, because the Russians were\nbeginning to confiscate the farms, and impose all kinds of restrictions like that. And\nthe times in the country became more difficult. So they thought well, occupation \u2014\nat least some of them would say, well, at least they believe in God.",
        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "A: So.",
        "Q: You remember hearing that?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Di-",
        "A: I remember hearing that. However, did I tell you the little ditty that was passed\naround?",
        "Q: Tell me again. If it\u2019s the same one, we\u2019ll find out.\nDecember 10, 2015",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: [speaks Lithuanian]",
        "Q: Okay, it starts out with \u2014 and it\u2019s a variation of what you told me before, which\nIs \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 neither Berlin, nor Moscow is dear to me. For me, one is black as the devil,\nthe other one is as brown \u2014",
        "A: Brown.",
        "Q: \u2014 as a dog.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes. So, you eventually do get reunited with your brother and your sister?",
        "A: Eventually they \u2014 we were all brought together, first on the farms.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: On my uncle\u2019s farm, we all came together.",
        "Q: Was this your Uncle Danielas(ph), or another uncle?",

        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Otherwise we all would have been picked up.",
        "Q: I see. But your mother had also been sleeping somewhere else.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 so she went to church a lot, and she took us Sundays to church. I did not\nhave many friends. I made \u2014 I did not know anything about the town. I did not\nknow anybody, but met a few people in school, in my class. One of my classmates\nsometimes would come and play with me in our house.",
        "Q: What did \u2014 was your house better than it had been in Jaimandas(ph), where you\nlived?December 10, 2015",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: In what way\u2019?",
        "A: It had more room, and it was better furnished. We had a garden, and a flower\ngarden.",
        "Q: Did you rent it from somebody?",
        "A: I assume so.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think we owned it.",
        "Q: And \u2014",

        "Q: But it was burned down.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t there any longer.",
        "Q: Okay. Did your father ever explain, or ec \u2014 or just describe how he got this job,\nfrom Jaimalas(ph) to Sven\u00e9ionys.\nDecember 10, 2015",
        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: Cause it\u2019s quite distance \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s quite far across the country.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And he was not working at \u2014 well, in my mind, I assumed that we have\na Lithuanian government now.",
        "Q: That was your assumption at the time?",
        "A: Yes. That the Russians have left. And so the Germans were there, but then \u2014 in\nthe country, but they were there to kind of protect us from Russians. And I \u2014 if I\ndon\u2019t re \u2014 I don\u2019t remember why, but I do think there was some quasi-Lithuanian\ngovernment. How real, how unreal, or am I imagining it, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Iremember my school that I liked. The children were friendly. I also remember\nthat there was a \u2014 a Polish population in town.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And was this something new for you?",
        "A: That was something new to me.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But there was a Polish population in school also, and at one point, I think there\nwere classes in school, were given in Polish.",
        "Q: Did you ever go to any of those classes?",
        "A: No.December 10, 2015",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were discontinued. Everything was in Lithuanian. What ha \u2014\nsay \u2014 what \u2014 if you know Lithuanian history, that part of Lithuania, Vilnius and all\naround there, at one point it was in Polish hands. After 1918, the Poles, they \u2014 they\nwere there, and the Lithuanians could not get the land back. So only when the \u2014 first\nthe Russians, the communists came to Lithuania, they brought this country, these\nparts of Lithuania, back to the Lithuanian Republic then. And the Germans also\nhad it all in the Lithuanian Republic. Actually, when my father was working in\nSvent\u00e9ionys, we have gone to Vilnius, excuse me, to visit with some priest that my\nsis \u2014 my aunt knew.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Was that the first time you were in Vilnius ever?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And do you remember any impressions from that visit?",
        "A: Churches, basically.",
        "Q: There are a lot of churches there.",
        "A: Yes. And knowing my aunt, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We went to churches.December 10, 2015",
        "Q: Okay. So \u2014 so within a number of months, actually one could say rather quickly,\nyour life really turns upside-down, but then gets resettled halfway across the\ncountry.",
        "A: You know, in \u2014 again, if I think about it now, it\u2019s very unsettling. However, I\nwas small, I was still very young, and I wasn\u2019t the only one who was being resettled\neverywhere, up and down. It was \u2014 the whole country was being resettled up \u2014 up\nand down. There \u2014 there was no \u2014 it was not unusual to have to move, and start\nsomewhere else, and I really didn\u2019t have a place, some [indecipherable]. My\nmother was taken, so in Jaimalas(ph) there was nothing for me, anybody else. And\n\u2014 well, the farms, my uncles\u2019 farms were okay, but I had to go to school, so I will\nnot have stayed in the village anyway. And I had never been there in winter, so \u2014 so\nmoving to another city, and a\u2014 another town, and another apartment wasn\u2019t\nsomething that was dra-dramatic for a \u2014 that si \u2014 the \u2014 the har \u2014 hurtful thing was\nthat my mother wasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: You missed her.",
        "A: That was difficult.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And though I liked my aunt, I never \u2014 somehow I \u2014 in my silly, little mind, I \u2014 I\nfelt that my mother was more worldly, more sophisticated.December 10, 2015",
        "Q: Was she, in actuality?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: So \u2014",
        "A: That my aunt was this very religious, country woman, and though she was kind\nenough \u2014 she was a good woman.",
        "Q: Yes, but she wasn\u2019t your mother.",
        "A: Yeah. I was \u2014 somehow I \u2014 I had warmer memories of my grandmother. We\nreally liked my gra \u2014 were very close to my grandmother.",
        "Q: Yeah. Your father would \u2014 did he have an office that he went to?",
        "A: No. Yes, he had an office.",
        "Q: He had an office. Did you ever visit him there?",
        "A: No. I never went there. I never went there, I never saw any Germans around,\nsoldiers. I \u2014 I\u2014 we knew very few people in town. Actually, when I think of it, I\ndon\u2019t remember see anybody that we knew, except people through\n[indecipherable] from my aunt, that in \u2014 at the church. And I remember that the\npriest tha-that parish priest would give huge, very elaborate Easter breakfast at that\nparish, and invite some people.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I went to church a great deal, and was involved with the church ceremonies.\nDecember 10, 2015",
        "Q: Did you get communion, first communion? Oh, that was before already.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you get confirmed?",
        "A: Yes, in Vilnius.",
        "Q: In Vilnius, you got confirmation in Vilnius.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay. Now, was the \u2014 in some ways what you\u2019re describing to me sounds not\nunusual, because up until the \u2014 those changes, in 1939, to 1941, this was Poland,\nthis was not Lithuania.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So it was a new ni \u2014 it was new territory for a Lithuanian administration. Were\nthere other Lithuanians in Sven\u00e9ionys, or was \u2014 were they a minority?",
        "A: Everybody spoke Lithuanian. We \u2014 if you went to the store, or if you went to a\nrestaurant, which we sometimes did, everybody spoke Lithuanian.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And whoever \u2014 in school, whoever was in school with me, spoke Lithuanian.",
        "Q: Now, you said though that you did know that there were Polish children in your\nschool, and for a little while there were classes in Polish.",
        "A: Not after we came.December 10, 2015",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: Before.",
        "Q: Before.",
        "A: Before we came, they spoke \u2014 they had Polish, but when we came there, when\nthe Lithuanians had hold of these parts, and then the school was only Lithuanian.",
        "Q: Did Polish children, however, attend it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if they were Polish or not. They all spoke Lithuanian.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I did not meet anybody in school that spoke Polish.",
        "Q: I see. One of the reasons I ask is because in Poland itself, German \u2014 during\nGerman occupation, education was severely restricted for Poles. Severely. In some\nways, outride forbidden.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And some places, only up until certain grades. So maybe children went to school\nwho were \u2014 Polish children went to school, and were able to continue school, but\nonly if they did it in Lithuanian.",
        "A: Probably, because the por \u2014 as far \u2014 from what I know, our education was not\nrestricted in any way.",
        "Q: Okay.December 10, 2015",
        "A: But then, again, there was this \u2014 Germans, from talks around, had something\nagainst the Slavs. And Poles were Slavs, and the Lithuanians were not. So I think\nwe might have gotten some preferential treatment.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: It\u2019s possible. Again, I just heard it as hi \u2014 as gossips, sometimes, a-among some\nad-adults.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But when we came there, didn\u2019t know anybody.",
        "Q: Okay. Now \u2014",
        "A: And we just moved into the apartment. I was taking piano lessons.",
        "Q: From whom?",
        "A: I do know that as time went on, things became more difficult. For example, food\nbecame scarce. You could not get meat, or you got very little meat. But we had\nrabbits, we kept rabbits, and hens, and I think even geese. And a\u2014 I ne \u2014I don\u2019t\nremember ever going to the store to shop. Whatever was bought, my Aunt Oda(ph)\nprobably went and shopped.",
        "Q: So in some ways it sounds like you were quite sheltered, you know, as children.",
        "A: Yeah.December 10, 2015",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t \u2014 1t was \u2014 would that be true, that you were kind of sheltered from\nthe chores of everyday \u2014",
        "A: Yes. I never was asked to do anything. I did not have to make beds, I did not\nhave to \u2014 to help in the kitchen.",
        "Q: And you were the oldest, so \u2014",
        "A: And I was the oldest, yes. No.",
        "Q: Was your father still as easygoing as he had been before?",
        "A: There were times when he would disappear for a couple days or so. There were\ntimes that he would be drunk.",
        "Q: Oh really? Had you ever seen him drunk before?",
        "A: No. There were times \u2014 well, if he was drunk, he was loud, he talked loud. He\nnever talked politics of any sort.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did his manner change, to you, or to the others?",
        "A: Towards us? No. No.",
        "Q: Did he \u2014",
        "A: He was always very gentle with us, and in some ways I felt he was unusually\nproud of me, because he thought I was very smart, and he thought that to the very\nend of his life, which is interesting.",
        "Q: It\u2019s important for a child.December 10, 2015",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s very important for a child to feel that from their parent.",
        "A: So to \u2014 Rita, my sister \u2014 Gerda(ph) my sister was considered very pretty. I was\ndefinitely the smart one.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And there wasn\u2019t much shopping of any kind. I think whatever clothes we had,\nthey were made over, changed. But \u2014",
        "Q: Did you make any new friends in Sven\u00e9ionys?",
        "A: I did. I had \u2014 especially one \u2014 one girl who lived out of town, and she would\nsometimes after school come to my house and stay with me, and we would play.",
        "Q: And she was somebody you had met from school?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember her name.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That was also just for a short while. When I think of it now, and knowing the\nhistory of my father there, I can see that some people probably were avoiding us. I\nmean, that\u2019s what I read into it now. At that time, I had no idea. We were in a place\nDecember 10, 2015\nwhere I was not familiar. I did not know the place, I did not know the people, I was\nin a new school. I did pretty well in school.",
        "Q: Well, you mentioned knowing now about \u2014 about the \u2014 such things. When did\nyou find out, and what did you find out?",
        "A: Rita\u2019s book.",
        "Q: So, your daughter recently wrote a book.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That was published less than three \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 months ago \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 in September 2015.",
        "A: Yeah, yes.",
        "Q: And before then, what had you known about your father\u2019s work? We\u2019 I] talk\nabout what you learned, but I want to find out what you knew.",
        "A: Yeah, what I knew about him. Okay, there \u2014 let\u2019s see, how long a time was it\nthat the Germans were there, and then the Russians came back?",
        "Q: I think it was from \u201941 to \u00b044.",
        "A: Three years.\nDecember 10, 2015",
        "Q: At least, mm-hm.",
        "A: Three years. Okay, so when \u2014 at one point, I remember that my father was \u2014 let\u2019s\nsee \u2014 yes. We left Sven\u00e9ionys, and moved to \u2014 where did it \u2014 Kupishkis.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because my father was arrested. I was on the farms. I and my brother were on\nthe farms with our uncles, and my grandmother was in the apartment in\nSvent\u00e9ionys, and my uncles went and picked her up. I think also in that period, that\nsummer, at one point, before our uncles, before I went to our farms, we were taken\nout of town. Now who took us, I don\u2019t remember. And we were placed somewhere\nin a very wooded place, somewhere in the woods, by some family, for a few weeks\nor a month or so. I\u2019m not sure how long. But then we all come together \u2014 I\u2019m\ntalking children \u2014 and we all left for my uncles\u2019 farms. And then, while there, at the\nend of the summer, time came to go to school, and my uncles rented an apartment\nfor my aunt and the three of us in Kupishkis, so that we could go to school.",
        "Q: So it was another new school?",
        "A: That was another new school. And I haven\u2019t lived in Kupishkis before. I didn\u2019t\neven \u2014 was not [indecipherable]. So I went to school there, and when I were \u2014 were\n\u2014 when we were in Kupishkis, we heard that my father was in prison. No, we \u2014\nbefore we came to Kupishkis, we were still at my uncles\u2019 farms, we heard that my\nDecember 10, 2015\nfather was arrested. He was in prison in Vilnius. And so my uncles found out about\nit. How, I don\u2019t know. I remember thinking that it was so unfair. The Russians took\nmy mother, and the Germans put my father in jail. And the school started, we\nmoved to shi \u2014 to Kupishkis, and there was a break in the fall, there was some kind\nof a holiday, and my aunt was ready to go to Vilnius, visit her father, and I was\ngoing to go with her. And just before we left, we received information that he was\nreleased.",
        "Q: I see. So \u2014",
        "A: So he was released, he came to Kupishkis to see us, and then went to\nPanev\u00e9zys, where he was employed again.",
        "Q: So he never went back to Sven\u00e9ionys?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Never went \u2014",
        "Q: And do you \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 back to Sven\u00e9ionys.",
        "Q: \u2014 do you remember what month \u2014 oh, what time \u2014 what year it was that he was\narrested?December 10, 2015",
        "A: The only way \u2014 I think after two \u2014 we mu \u2014 I must have spent two years in a\nschool in Sven\u00e9ionys.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And it would have happened in the summer bef \u2014 after that.",
        "Q: So it would be the summer of \u201943?",
        "A: Probably, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. Now, when you moved to Sven\u00e9ionys, you mentioned that there was \u2014 it\neh \u2014 first of all, it was part of Poland. There were many Polish people.",
        "A: I did not really even know that.",
        "Q: I know, I know.",
        "A: Yeah. I just knew that there were Poles living there.",
        "Q: Did you see \u2014",
        "A: And I know from the history \u2014 by then I knew that there \u2014 because I le-learned\nsome history and geography, that Vilnius, and the part around Vilnius, after 1918\nwas left for the Poles. But as soon as the first communist occupation took place, that\npart of Lithuania was put back to Lithuania.",
        "Q: So some could say that was something that was advantageous \u2014",
        "A: Yes [indecipherable] \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 for [indecipherable]December 10, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 advantageous, you know. Yes, everybody \u2014 Lithuanians felt good. We have\nour land back.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I see. Now, from what I understand about Sven\u00e9ionys, it had not only a\nPolish population, but also a Jewish population before the war. When you went\nthere, when you lived there, do you remember any Jewish shops, do you remember\nany Jewish people? Do you remember seeing anything on the streets, anybody on\nthe streets?",
        "A: No. And if \u2014 I mean, if they \u2014 unless they were dressed differently, or went to s \u2014\nif they \u2014 I don\u2019t remember seeing a synagogue. I did not remember hearing any\nJews in the stores. Just on di\u2014 didn\u2019t see any Jews. No \u2014 no Jews ever came to our\nhouse, and I don\u2019t remember seeing any Jewish children in school. But then that\u2019s\nnot surprising because when I was in \u2014 in Svention\u00e9liai, I did not know if there\nwere any Jewish children in my school.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They would not necessarily would have announced themselves as Jewish, or try\nto stand out.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you, as children, know what was happening to the Jews of the\ncountry?December 10, 2015",
        "A: No. No. I don\u2019t know, it might have been discussed among my \u2014 my family, like\nmy uncles and my au \u2014 my grandmother, or even my aunt who lived with us. But\nthey never tried to tell us anything about it \u2014 about the fate of the Jews, or did we\nask? Now, why didn\u2019t we ask? Perhaps we were scared.",
        "Q: Why would you be scared?",
        "A: If people are being arrested, you are scared. If you are small, and people are\nbeing arrested, especially if they were people that you knew \u2014 though I did not\nknow any Jews \u2014 I knew Jews in \u2014 in Jaimalas(ph), as store owners. But in\nSventionys, when we moved into Sventionys, I did not meet any Jews. And I \u2014I\nmean, I know what happened, but by the \u2014 when we arrived there, I would now\nthink that by then the Jews must have been rounded up and moved out of town.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because I know that Germans required that they wear \u2014 wore a yellow star. Now\nwhere did I find that out? Was it there, or much later? Probably still in Lithuania,\nbut I never saw anybody wearing it.",
        "Q: Did you ever see somebody wearing ribbons?",
        "A: A what?",
        "Q: Ribbons of some kind.",
        "A: No.\n100December 10, 2015",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: That would mark them as Jewish? No.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t think I met any Jews there, or knew what ha \u2014 was happening to\nthe Jews.",
        "Q: Would you have ever thought at that time that your father might have had\nsomething to do with it?",
        "A: No. I had \u2014 my \u2014 this is \u2014 sounds very stupid, but I had no 1\u2014 not really knew\nwhat my father\u2019s job involved.",
        "Q: That\u2019s not stupid, you were a child.",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 yeah, well, it was security police, or \u2014 there were plenty of reasons to \u2014 to\nwant to be secure. I do remember an incident, because it was so talked about that,\nvery much, at that time. That there was a \u2014 an incident where a German \u2014 two\nGermans were in car, driving somewhere, not too far from Sven\u00e9ionys somewhere.\nAnd they had a translator, a woman. I assume she was a Lithuanian woman. And\nshe was connected with the partisans. We knew there were partisans in the woods.\nAnd she asked the Germans to stop the car because she needed to go to the woodsDecember 10, 2015\nto relieve herself. They stopped the car, and the partisans shot them. And then she\nwas arrested. The Germans picked her up, and I remember that there was \u2014 that\nthere were some German nat \u2014 Wehrmacht, with the brown shirts, had appeared in\ntown, ka \u2014 even were in our house, talking to \u2014 to my father, and I remember my\nfather making a remark to somebody that she would be better off dead. And I\nremember then hearing something that people were \u2014 were shocked because of this.\nI remember that they picked maybe that incident, or some other incident, the\nGermans picked up some \u2014 a couple men that \u2014 they were not Jews, I think they\nwere Poles, maybe Lithuanians, and shot them on \u2014 they took them to Jewish\ncemetery and shot them there, though they were not Jewish. And I remember I was\nvery \u2014 I was afraid. But then I don\u2019t know where they were buried, or not buried, or\nwhat \u2014 or what they were shot for, but I was afraid. And then the Germans kind of\ndisappeared again. There was not \u2014 I did not feel a strong German presence in this \u2014\nin Sven\u00e9ionys, because if you walked to school, if you walked to town, you didn\u2019t\nsee them.",
        "Q: Now, did you feel safe?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Did you feel safe? Given what you\u2019re describing to me, that doesn\u2019t sound \u2014",
        "A: No.December 10, 2015",
        "Q: \u2014 like an easy thing to answer.",
        "A: No. You didn\u2019t. When this \u2014 things \u2014 things go like that, you don\u2019t feel safe. You\ndon\u2019t feel safe anywhere. So there were times in my very young life, where I was \u2014\nI mean, just the fact that my father was then arrested \u2014",
        "Q: Did you ever find out what for?",
        "A: No. One did not ask. I mean, these things were \u2014 people were arrested. So, the\ngovernment, whoever they are at that point, has something against you, so they\narrested you. Why? Who knows? The whole system of justice was non-existent. It\nwas on on the whim of the government that was, at that time, 1n power. That\u2019s it.\nThey did not have to give any excuses or explanations. You could have been picked\nup walking down the street, and hauled off.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So \u2014",
        "A: Because it happened. Look, when my mother was taken away, there were\nthousands of people taken away. So \u2014",
        "Q: So it wouldn\u2019t have occurred to ask why. Is that what you\u2019re saying?",
        "A: No. Didn\u2019t even occur to ask me why.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, now \u2014",
        "A: You know what? And also then, whatever was happening to the Jews at that\ntime, had I even known about it, that they were being arrested and hauled off, itDecember 10, 2015\nwould be just another thing happening. Can you \u2014 another crazy thing happening.\nScary. It\u2019s a very hard life. Very difficult time. It\u2019s interesting when I think about it,\nheck, here Iam. Wonder of wonders. I don\u2019t even lock my door. I did for a long\ntime, in my life. I did not feel safe. And then, you know, then we \u2014 we were in DP\ncamps.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll talk about this.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But I want to \u2014 I want to still stay with this [indecipherable]",
        "A: Stay with th \u2014 with this \u2014 with this period in our life.",
        "Q: Yeah. Now, at this point, Ill interject this \u2014 how it even is that we come to speak\nwith you today. And that\u2019s by mentioning the book that your daughter wrote, your\ndaughter Rita Gabis wrote a book that was published two, three months ago, called\n\u201cGuest at the Shooter\u2019s Banquet.\u201d And in it she describes her journey to find out\nmore about what your father\u2019s role had been during World War II. In a way, to find\nout who he was. More of who he was. And I\u2019ve read the book, and in it I also read\nthat you did not want to know until it was finished. You were going to read it, but\nnot until it was finished, as to what her progress was. Have I \u2014 am I accurate in\nsaying that, or were you involved in her research work?",
        "A: About what, the book?\n104December 10, 2015",
        "Q: About the book, about what she was doing, about her \u2014",
        "A: No, I was not at all involved.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No. The only \u2014 she came here once, with her husband, and my sister was here,\nand we had one conversation where I think she wa \u2014 she was in the process of\ngetting the book going. About our life in Sven\u00e9ionys, and what do we remember of\nthe war, and that period. And she did not feel that we gave her a very satisfactory\nanswers, that we knew enough about it. And it\u2019s true, you know. When you think of\nthis \u2014 if this \u2014 something like that started happening here, you would be up in arms.\nBut I was this young child, the country was up and down, first one invasion, then\nthe other invasion. There was no stable government of any sort. Nobody even\ntaught us about any government, stable or otherwise. So you just kind of stay with\nyour family, and mind your business, and you don\u2019t need to ask any questions. The\nrest was not up to us. The only thing I can say is, what you hear, what you\noverheard.",
        "Q: Now, since then \u2014 you\u2019ve read the book, is that correct?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What is it that you learned, that you didn\u2019t know before?December 10, 2015",
        "A: I thought she did a very good job writing the book. I thought she \u2014 not only she\nwrote a beautiful book \u2014 she\u2019s a very good writer \u2014 but also, she did as much\nresearch as was needed, and she wrote about things that I am \u2014 truly believe\nhappened.",
        "Q: So \u2014 and these things involve some very bitter and very tough \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 and one could say brutal \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 events.",
        "A: And I can under \u2014 I expect her \u2014 I won\u2019t say interpretation, because it\u2019s not\ninterpretation, it\u2019s a fact \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 that was going on. And now, knowing my father, as a grown person, though I\nalways have been his favorite child, and I love him dearly, I know that he was a\nvain man. I don\u2019t think he was a mean man, or a\u2014 a cruel man. But I think he was\nvain, and I think he could have easily fallen into a place where he will do things to\npromote himself. Now, how far he will go with that \u2014 as the book says, he went\npretty far. Just about as far as you can go. But then, none of that was ever discussed\n106December 10, 2015\nat the household. Never. And I have no \u2014 I really had no idea what a social \u2014 what a\nchief of security would do, because I never heard of that title.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Never met anybody who was a chief of police \u2014 of security police.",
        "Q: But as \u2014 as Rita writes, it did involve sending out orders to round up Jews. It did\ninvolve making sure they were brought to certain places.",
        "A: And, you know, if I had stayed, let\u2019s say, in Jaimalas(ph), where I knew that\nJews lived there, and where they lived, now, if th \u2014 I was \u2014 had I stayed there, and\nknow that they disappeared, I would have been more curious. Then I would have\nknown that something is happening, and what is happening.",
        "Q: Someone was there, and now they\u2019re gone.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, that they were arrested or taken away. The \u2014 the talk would be right\nthere about it. I was in \u2014 in a city and town that was larger. I had never been there. I\nnever knew there were any Jews there.",
        "Q: And the only thing you see from your father is that sometimes he gets drunk, that\nhe didn\u2019t before.",
        "A: Yeah, but then that\u2019s also \u2014 my father liked to drink now and then. He never was\nthe \u2014 a man who would sit down and get drunk by himself. But he would love \u2014 he\nloved company, and he would go \u2014 they would go out and they would drink atDecember 10, 2015\nsomebody\u2019s house usually, very seldom in taverns, or something \u2014 such thing.\nSomebody\u2019s house, usually. Our house, too.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 when you read \u2014 when you read what Rita discovered, what she wrote \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 she interviewed some of the Jewish survivors from Sventionys \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 she interviewed some of the relatives of the Poles who were shot, as a reprisal",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 for the killing of these two Germans. Did she present to you a man who was a\nstranger to you, as a father, or was it someone you knew, but you didn\u2019t know these\nthings about him?",
        "A: I obviously did not know what\u2019s going on. I did not know what was going on\nwith the Jews, and I did not know what my father\u2019s part was in it. After everything\nwas over, and I was learning history later on, and I was learning what happened,\nand thinking of my father in his \u2014 his place there, I can easily understand that she\ncould \u2014 that that could have happened. It did not take me by oh no, my daddy would\nnever do something like that, no.",
        "Q: Yeah. Okay. Okay.\n108\nDecember 10, 2015",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: We'll talk about DP life, but at this point I want to jump ahead \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 because there\u2019s another unusual wrinkle to this story, is that after you come to\nthe United States, you meet and you marry somebody who is Jewish.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about that, how you met, how you married \u2014",
        "A: I was his student.",
        "Q: Oh really?",
        "A: Yeah. Easy. Easy.",
        "Q: What did he teach?",
        "A: Administra\u2014 government. I couldn\u2019t have cared anything about the United\nStates government. Never knew about any government, cared less. Stanley would\ntell me what will be on the test [indecipherable] you should study this and this. I\nwould go there and think \u2014 I got Cs.",
        "Q: He gave you Cs.",
        "A: And a husband. It wasn\u2019t bad deal.",
        "Q: What was the name of your husband? Your firs\u2014",
        "A: Stanley.\n109December 10, 2015",
        "Q: Stanley.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Stanley was his first name?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Last name Gabis?",
        "A: Yeah, Gabis.",
        "Q: Gabis.",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were \u2014 his grandparents came from \u2014 somewhere from Russia\nor Belarus, somewhere \u2014 from somewhere there. And we were married in Chicago,\nin a little Lutheran chapel on the University of Chicago grounds, because Stanley\nknew the minister. And I wanted to be married in church, I did not want to go just to\nthe town hall and sign papers. I wanted to wear a white dress and things like that.\nThe whole works.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And Stanley had no religious traditions. His mother had no religious traditions,\nand I did not have any Christian traditions beside \u2014 I did have a Christmas tree up,\nbut that was about it. And so, it did not even occur to me that there is something\nstrange that I marry a Jew.",

In my case, my mother was gone, my\nvery religious aunt was raising me, which I wasn\u2019t so enthralled about. We were in\nSventionys, we had to leave there and hide. We \u2014 then my father was arrested. I\n112\nDecember 10, 2015\nmean, it just one thing after another. And you somehow plowed through it all. Then\nwe left Lithuania in a hurry, hiding.",

I know he had an\noffice somewhere, and he had \u2014 he did not wear any uniforms, and he had a small\napartment in Panev\u00e9zys. And I remember going over and spending a day or two\nthere. I had taken a train from Kupishkis to Panev\u00e9zys and back, but he never told\nme what he was doing. He was working for \u2014 for the \u2014 for something.",

        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t sure. I knew he was not working in a store, selling something. I\nknew he\u2019d have to do something more likely with the \u2014 maybe the police, maybe\nthe army, or government, maybe? Do not know. And meanwhile, in Kupishkis,\nthings were going on a very even keel. Nothing important was happening. It was\ndifficult, there were shortages. And I remember for some crazy reason, I wanted to\nget a little goat. I set my heart on getting a little goat. So guess what? My\ngrandmother, or my aunt were able to get a pound of bacon. And for that pound of\nbacon, I got myself a goat.",

        "Q: She knew she was your goat.",

Anyway, there is a\npath in between, and my brother would go in the woods, and would go, making a lot\nof noise, to chase the deer out to \u2014 towards my father. And one day when we were\nout there, we found this package dropped, like a fairly large thing, lying in the\nwoods.",
        "Q: A package wrapped?",
        "A: Which looked like it had a parachute on it. So we called my father, we picked\nthis thing up, brought it to the farm, and my father opened it up with the farmer.\nThere was a lot of money there. Deutschmarks.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And apparently what it was, probably it was a drop for Russians partisans, that\nmust have been hiding in the woods. I was scared.

        "Q: Mm-hm. I see. Now, from what I understand about Sven\u00e9ionys, it had not only a\nPolish population, but also a Jewish population before the war.

        "Q: Did you feel safe? Given what you\u2019re describing to me, that doesn\u2019t sound \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 like an easy thing to answer.",
        "Q: Did you ever find out what for?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So \u2014",

In a way, to find\nout who he was. More of who he was. And I\u2019ve read the book, and in it I also read\nthat you did not want to know until it was finished. You were going to read it, but\nnot until it was finished, as to what her progress was. Have I \u2014 am I accurate in\nsaying that, or were you involved in her research work?",
        "Q: About the book, about what she was doing, about her \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Now, since then \u2014 you\u2019ve read the book, is that correct?",

        "Q: But as \u2014 as Rita writes, it did involve sending out orders to round up Jews. It did\ninvolve making sure they were brought to certain places.",
        "Q: Someone was there, and now they\u2019re gone.",
        "Q: And the only thing you see from your father is that sometimes he gets drunk, that\nhe didn\u2019t before.",

        "Q: It was \u2014 it didn\u2019t come up?",
        "Q: Is that what you\u2019re saying? Okay. Well, there are a lot of people who have told\nme, that after the war was over, they just didn\u2019t talk about what they had gone\nthrough. These are people who were also Jewish \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s go back to that, because as I said, I jumped ahead.",
        "Q: And I do want to go back to what life was like after Sven\u00e9ionys, when your\nfather is released, and you all move to Panev\u00e9zys. That\u2019s 1943 \u2014 \u00b044.",

        "A: What images \u2014",
        "A: Okay. They liked the fact that there were Lithuanian schools, that their children\nwere taught Lithuanian reading and writing, because rem \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\nknow it, but under the tsar\u2019s occupation, it was forbidden to print books in\nLithuanian.",
        "A: I remember the stories about it, I mean \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was before my time, but I remember people talking about \u2014 the stories about\nit, that you had. And we were even taught it, explained to us that they used to print\nbooks in Lithuanian, across the border in Prussia, and smuggle them into\nLithuania. And that\u2019s how they had books, Lithuanian books in their villages.",
        "A: And you could be punished very severely by the tsar\u2019s agents if they found out\nthat you had Lithuanian books. But \u2014 so, there was this feeling that now they cannot\ntell us. We have our own books, our own government. I don\u2019t think anybody was\ntoo interested in how the government ran, or what was happening. They \u2014 their lives\nconcentrated on their farm, on their families, on the weather.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s it. But, as I say, they would not have \u2014 they would never have welp \u2014\nwelcomed any foreign country taking Lithuania over.",

        "A: Again, keeping in mind that I was now talking about the first thing that happened\nwas the Russians coming in.",
        "A: Two.",
        "A: I-I in \u20141n 1918, Lithuania became separate. The Russian \u2014 the tsars were\ndefeated. The \u2014 now I\u2019m talking because I learned about it, not because \u2014 1t was\nmuch discussed in my family, because that was way before.",
        "A: Nobody would sit down and \u2014 we didn\u2019t have TV or radios. We did have a radio.\nNobody listened to it so much, except operas. But what I learned later on, after the\ncommunists took over Russia government, and then stopped a war, Lithuanians\ndeclared independence.",

        "A: Not in Jaimalas(ph). Somewhere \u2014 I\u2019m trying to remember. Where could have it\nbeen? Panev\u00e9zys maybe \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 or Kupishkis. Anyway, my father showed up there. My mother was in \u2014 lived\nin that area, and she actually was dating somebody, and that friend of hers was not \u2014\nshe found out he was cheating on her. Again, my mother tells the story. And so, she\ngot mad at him and married my father, to spite him.",
        "A: He was a rebound, and it was not a happy marriage.",
        "A: It was not a happy marriage.",

        "A: Yes, they argued. What did they argue about? Money. I think my father probably\nhad a relationship with somebody, and my mother just simply did not have much\nrespect for my father.",

And that\u2019s what I will get. That was my sweet. And it was \u2014 you know, it was\nvery eas \u2014 easy life.

And she said, and I served pork. She said, I did not know he was Jewish, I\nserved pork. But she said, well, he ate it.",

And he was in charge of that \u2014 of a stretch of a border, in charge of the patrols.\nI guess he would ride out. He had a beautiful horse, I remember that. Lila was herDecember 10, 2015\nname. And he would ride out there and check on the patrols, I suppose. I think now\nand then, maybe every six months, or once a year, some kind of a superiors would\narrive, and he had prison documents. I remember it because my mother would fill\nthese documents out for him at the last minute, so everything looked okay. That\u2019s\nwhat I understood.",

I do know that the farmers were very concerned,\nbecause they were required by the gub \u2014 by the government now, to deliver so much\nfood, grains of all kinds, maybe even animals to their government. For which they\ngot paid, but very little. So slowly \u2014 you know, depending how much land you had,\nit looked like slowly you will have to sell it \u2014 to leave it, because you will not able\nto \u2014 to have enough to deliver to the government. And after that, they would start\nbuilding kolhauses(ph). Kolhauses(ph) is a farm that the land belongs to the state,\nand everybody works there, for the state.

And then just before the deport \u2014 huge deportation was staged,\nhe came home, and I have a feeling that the people knew, or sensed, or heard\nsomething, that something is going to happen.

        "A: So we did.",

        "A: The week later, the war started, yes. So we were taken out to the farms, and I ha\n\u2014 so the \u2014 I think the population felt that some \u2014 there were rumors, there were\nprobably spies, there were some kind of information floating around that the Soviets\nwill be pushed out, an-and the Germans will come and push the germ \u2014 the Soviets\nout, and everybody felt ve \u2014 I think most people probably felt oh well, that\u2019s good.December 10, 2015\nLet\u2019s get rid of the Soviets. At least the Germans are religious. So that was it. So\nwhen they took us to the farm, I did not think anything of it. Now, I tell you the one\nthing. Once I \u2014 once we got there, after staying with my uncles for about a week, we\nwere taken away from my uncles, our uncles distributed the three of us to different\nfarmers around.",
        "A: No, not even family members. I don\u2019t know where my brother was, or my sister.\nI know that I was with some people who I could have met, but they were not family\nmembers, and I just stayed there, and I did not know why. I thought maybe because\nthe war was coming, because at one point, the family had even a \u2014 a kind of earth\ntunnel built, or something, that you could go in, if the bombs start falling, if they\nstart shooting around.",
        "A: No, don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t even remember their name.",
        "A: But, you know, they were kind to me, they were good to me. They did not \u2014 they\ndid not tell me what was going on, they just said, you know, my brother was\nsomewhere else. I wanted to be with my brother and sister, mainly my brother.",

We were walking little paths\nthrough their farmland, and someone was working on the land. I don\u2019t know, my\naunt knew him, and they start to talk, and they start to talk and the man said, I hear\nthat Poroniena(ph) was taken away. And my aunt said, shh, don\u2019t say anything,\nbecause I did not know. And then when we walked away, I asked her. I said, what\nhappened? And then she told me that my mother was deported. And that \u2014December 10, 2015",

Somehow,\nthere were some relatives, or people from the same village, here in United States,\nand they have seen my father and us, because we were in New Jersey for a little\nwhile. And they have written to their friends, their family in Lithuania, telling\nthem, well, we saw Poronus(ph) and his family here in \u2014 in \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in United States, and they told my mother. That\u2019s how she found out that we\nwere alive, because when she came to Lithuania, they did not know if we were\nalive or dead. And then she managed through \u2014 because my \u2014 my aunt was writing\nletters to Lithuania, through family members, she found our addresses in lith \u2014 in\ngi \u2014 in United States. And I was living then in \u2014 in Chicago.",

I know\n\u2014 I saw her for the first time again in \u2014 49 years ago, but we first heard from her, I\nhad two children, I did not have David. So, she wrote to us, and I wr-wrote to her.\nAnd then Gerda(ph) and I kept sending presents to her. She lived in \u2014 where did\nshe live? Plung\u00e9.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: She lived in Plung\u00e9, and Gerda(ph) and I kept sending \u2014 we were \u2014 the \u2014 at the\nbeginning was very difficult to send anything. You had to send through some kind\nof organization that was connected with the Soviet regime, that would allow the\nstuff to go in. We send, basically, yard goods, of all kinds, so she could trade them\nfor food. She had acquired a tiny house in that town, that belonged, actually, to my\naunt \u2014 to my took \u2014 to Ona(ph), my father\u2019s sister.",
        "A: She acquired that house. And she \u2014 she would request all kinds of very fancy\ngoods, so we would send it to her, and she would exchange them. She worked also\nin a parish, I think there, as a head cook, or \u2014 I\u2014 I \u2014 it\u2019s something \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah. And \u2014 but she basically lived of what we sent her. And she started bribing\nthe authorities, applying \u2014 trying to apply for a visa to get out, and go to la \u2014 to go\nto United States.",
        "A: No, no. And \u2014",
        "A: How she lived in there \u2014 when she was deported?",
        "A: Some. Some. She \u2014 she arrived in Chicago \u2014 I then lived in Columbia,\nMissouri, and I came to Chicago with my three children, and stayed at my sister\u2019s.\nMy brother came in. He lived down in Kansas | \u2014 I think in Kansas already. And\nhis wife, and we all went to the airport to meet her. I remember it was \u2014 must have\nbeen close to Christmas. I stayed there for a while, and then I went to the apartment,December 10, 2015\nbecause my baby was sick, and I couldn\u2019t stay out there. I had to go then \u2014 to my \u2014\nto the apartment. So, this is what my sisters told me, she said, when she got off \u2014\nout of the plane, we somehow, all of us recognized her. But we also knew that once\nshe was able to fly out of Russia, and fly to Switzerland, that when she got to\nSwitzerland, we knew she was safe. So that\u2019s \u2014 what she told about the camps, she\nsaid actually, first she was kept in prison, and was interrogated, and was badly\nbeaten up, and they wanted to get names of other partisans, partisans that were\ninvolved. And she said she didn\u2019t tell them anything. So she then ended in camps\nway out the Altai mountains. And it was very difficult. She had had, at one point,\nsome training as a nurse. So for a while, she actually helped out in one camp, as a\nnurse, and she caught TB. She almost died. And then they \u2014 they worked in the\nfields, and she said sometimes the peasants from the area would leave packages of\nfood in the fields for them, for the prisoners, because they knew they were starving.\nShe said by that time, a cat appeared in the camp. We knew that we lived much\nbetter, because nobody ate the cat.",
        "A: Hm\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah.December 10, 2015",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And of course, she did not get anything \u2014 didn\u2019t hear anything from us, from \u2014\nabout her family. And then she served 15 years, as she was required apparently, her\npunishment was to serve 15 years, so she did. And then they said, the authorities\ntold her that she can stay if she wants to, and work as an \u2014 a nurse, or so \u2014 and they\nwill pay her. But she said no, she wanted to go back home. And so she \u2014 she went\nback ho \u2014 back to Lithuania.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right after that, she went directly to Lithuania, and stayed in Plung\u00e9 because\nher sister \u2014 one of her sisters lived there, or close by. And anyway, she was \u2014 she\nwas given housing.",
        "A: By her own sister.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: She lived with my sister.",
        "A: With Gerda(ph), yes, in Chicago. And to describe my mother, she was very\nthin, somewhat gray, and I mean, she was emaciated, she was very thin. Gerda(ph)\ntook her to the doctors, and she s \u2014 they said, well, if we did not know that she\u2019s\nliving with you, with th \u2014 we think that she was being starved. But she was not\nhappy. I think what she missed, she missed having her own place. She did not like\nliving with Gerda(ph), she did not like living with me.",
        "A: She lived, at the end, with my father, and she died in Kansas, with my father and\nmy brother, my brother had both of them. And she went there because she \u2014 she\nlived in Chicago with my sister, and my sister, they had bought a house in Park\nRidge, the same house that they are in now. And she had broken her hip, and she\ncould not climb the stairs, and there was no way for her sleep downstairs, so my\nbrother took her because they had a one floor e \u2014 floor house, sort of little shack in\nKansas.December 10, 2015",
        "A: No, nothing.",
        "A: A complete stranger, mm-hm. And very unhappy woman. Very unhappy\nwoman. No matter what you did for her, and how it went, nothing really pleased\nher.",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember that. I don\u2019t remember that. I knew that she\nwas ni\u2014 not a happy women when she \u2014 when I was growing up, but partly was \u2014\nthat was sort of that she and Father did not get along. But no, you know, I really\ndon\u2019t remember my mother laughing, smile, or really meeting anybody with great\njoy. It just \u2014 there was something in her character that \u2014 of course the deportation,\nand the \u2014 the arrests and all that, were difficult, but some of that inner sadness was\nalways there, and I don\u2019t know what for. Now my father was very different.",
        "A: So she \u2014 she died in Kansas, where in she \u2014 my brother called me, it was right at\nNew Year\u2019s, I don\u2019t remember how many years ago, but he called me and he said\nthat Mother had to go into the hospital. And I called her and talked with her in theDecember 10, 2015\nhospital, and she said, oh, I am feeling \u2014 I don\u2019t feel bad. So that was okay. There 1s\nsomebody here who can speak \u2014 her English was not good, not very good, but she\nsays somebody here can speak Polish. And she knew Polish, and of course she\nknew Russian. And so she said was very good. And she died next day.",
        "A: Maybe 10, I think. She was 80 when she died, I know that.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I flew out to Kansas for the mer \u2014 burial. And now, my father is dead, and my\nmother is dead, they are both \u2014 and my brother is dead, and all three of them are\nburied in Kansas, on this sweeping hill, and you can see as far as your eye goes.",
        "A: Hm\u2019?",
        "A: Very good resting place, very quiet. Very good resting place, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.December 10, 2015",
        "A: I do not have any specific informations. What I heard people talking about, that\nthere were more people \u2014 she was not the only one from the town that was taken,\nthere were more people taken from that town. I think the mayor of the town, and his\nfamily. And 1-1f it \u2014 it\u2019s strange \u2014 strange coincidence, one of the daughters, small\ndaughter of that family, was staying with her grandparents in the village, and she\nwas left.",
        "A: So everybody was taken in the family, but her. And she grew up and actually\ncame to United States. And from the people there was a feeling that they were\ntrying to pick up better educated people, and probably people that might have been\na problem. I had never heard anything said that my mother would have been picked\nup because of my father. I haven\u2019t heard that at all.December 10, 2015",
        "A: But I think it\u2019s nobody was given any reason. They just showed up and said you\nare going, period. That is my understanding. There were all these people, they\u2019re\ntaken from \u2014 from this town, and it was a massive deportation all across the\ncountry. People were taken from other cities, too, and shipped straight out to \u2014 to \u2014\nto Soviet Union. And much later on, one of my uncles and his family were\ndeported. That was during the 40s.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. When the Russians stayed in Lithuania.",
        "A: There was no \u2014 there was no specific charge. It was not like somebody showed\nup and said okay, you\u2019ve wrote this pamphlet, or your belong to this group, and\nthat\u2019s why you will have to go.",
        "A: They \u2014 from what happened to my mother probably happened to very many\npeople. Very often I heard those stories that they separated small children from their\nDecember 10, 2015\nparents, and some of these very tiny children were given away to Russian families\nto raise.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if that is true. I really don\u2019t know. And as far as I was concerned,\nthe way I found out, I told you how I found out about it, nobody ever explained to\nme why she was taken. He just said there were a pla \u2014 many other people taken.",
        "A: Oh, I miss her terribly. The \u2014 everybody \u2014 I mean, my sister was tiny still, she\nwas seven years \u2014 she\u2019s seven years younger. So my sister, she said that \u2014 she told\nme much later, now actually, that for a long time she thought maybe she did\nsomething, that\u2019s why the mother was gone.",
        "A: And it\u2019s just one of these things that happened. And, in a strange way though,\nnow of course, I would question it \u2014 if anything that \u2014 like that would happen, or\nsimilar, I would be questioning everywhere. But at that time I was small, the war\nwas going on, and nobody \u2014 and never asked any questions. I never asked any\nquestions, and nobody explained to me.\nDecember 10, 2015",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I was then not staying with my fa \u2014 with any of my family. We were separated,\nthe three children, and I was staying with some other people. And then eventually\nheard that the Russians left, and the Germans came, and as far as I was concerned,\nand the people around me were glad to see Germans, because the Russians were\nbeginning to confiscate the farms, and impose all kinds of restrictions like that. And\nthe times in the country became more difficult. So they thought well, occupation \u2014\nat least some of them would say, well, at least they believe in God.",
        "A: So.",

        "A: You know, in \u2014 again, if I think about it now, it\u2019s very unsettling. However, I\nwas small, I was still very young, and I wasn\u2019t the only one who was being resettled\neverywhere, up and down. It was \u2014 the whole country was being resettled up \u2014 up\nand down. There \u2014 there was no \u2014 it was not unusual to have to move, and start\nsomewhere else, and I really didn\u2019t have a place, some [indecipherable]. My\nmother was taken, so in Jaimalas(ph) there was nothing for me, anybody else. And\n\u2014 well, the farms, my uncles\u2019 farms were okay, but I had to go to school, so I will\nnot have stayed in the village anyway. And I had never been there in winter, so \u2014 so\nmoving to another city, and a\u2014 another town, and another apartment wasn\u2019t\nsomething that was dra-dramatic for a \u2014 that si \u2014 the \u2014 the har \u2014 hurtful thing was\nthat my mother wasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: That was difficult.",
        "A: And though I liked my aunt, I never \u2014 somehow I \u2014 in my silly, little mind, I \u2014 I\nfelt that my mother was more worldly, more sophisticated.December 10, 2015",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: That my aunt was this very religious, country woman, and though she was kind\nenough \u2014 she was a good woman.",
        "A: Yeah. I was \u2014 somehow I \u2014 I had warmer memories of my grandmother. We\nreally liked my gra \u2014 were very close to my grandmother.",
        "A: No. Yes, he had an office.",
        "A: No. I never went there. I never went there, I never saw any Germans around,\nsoldiers. I \u2014 I\u2014 we knew very few people in town. Actually, when I think of it, I\ndon\u2019t remember see anybody that we knew, except people through\n[indecipherable] from my aunt, that in \u2014 at the church. And I remember that the\npriest tha-that parish priest would give huge, very elaborate Easter breakfast at that\nparish, and invite some people.",
        "A: And I went to church a great deal, and was involved with the church ceremonies.\nDecember 10, 2015",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, in Vilnius.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Everybody spoke Lithuanian. We \u2014 if you went to the store, or if you went to a\nrestaurant, which we sometimes did, everybody spoke Lithuanian.",
        "A: And whoever \u2014 in school, whoever was in school with me, spoke Lithuanian.",
        "A: Not after we came.December 10, 2015",
        "A: Before.",
        "A: Before we came, they spoke \u2014 they had Polish, but when we came there, when\nthe Lithuanians had hold of these parts, and then the school was only Lithuanian.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if they were Polish or not. They all spoke Lithuanian.",
        "A: I did not meet anybody in school that spoke Polish.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Probably, because the por \u2014 as far \u2014 from what I know, our education was not\nrestricted in any way.",
        "A: But then, again, there was this \u2014 Germans, from talks around, had something\nagainst the Slavs. And Poles were Slavs, and the Lithuanians were not. So I think\nwe might have gotten some preferential treatment.",
        "A: It\u2019s possible. Again, I just heard it as hi \u2014 as gossips, sometimes, a-among some\nad-adults.",
        "A: But when we came there, didn\u2019t know anybody.",
        "A: And we just moved into the apartment. I was taking piano lessons.",
        "A: I do know that as time went on, things became more difficult. For example, food\nbecame scarce. You could not get meat, or you got very little meat. But we had\nrabbits, we kept rabbits, and hens, and I think even geese. And a\u2014 I ne \u2014I don\u2019t\nremember ever going to the store to shop. Whatever was bought, my Aunt Oda(ph)\nprobably went and shopped.",
        "A: Yeah.December 10, 2015",
        "A: Yes. I never was asked to do anything. I did not have to make beds, I did not\nhave to \u2014 to help in the kitchen.",
        "A: And I was the oldest, yes. No.",
        "A: There were times when he would disappear for a couple days or so. There were\ntimes that he would be drunk.",
        "A: No. There were times \u2014 well, if he was drunk, he was loud, he talked loud. He\nnever talked politics of any sort.",
        "A: Towards us? No. No.",
        "A: He was always very gentle with us, and in some ways I felt he was unusually\nproud of me, because he thought I was very smart, and he thought that to the very\nend of his life, which is interesting.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: So to \u2014 Rita, my sister \u2014 Gerda(ph) my sister was considered very pretty. I was\ndefinitely the smart one.",
        "A: And there wasn\u2019t much shopping of any kind. I think whatever clothes we had,\nthey were made over, changed. But \u2014",
        "A: I did. I had \u2014 especially one \u2014 one girl who lived out of town, and she would\nsometimes after school come to my house and stay with me, and we would play.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember her name.",
        "A: That was also just for a short while. When I think of it now, and knowing the\nhistory of my father there, I can see that some people probably were avoiding us. I\nmean, that\u2019s what I read into it now. At that time, I had no idea. We were in a place\nDecember 10, 2015\nwhere I was not familiar. I did not know the place, I did not know the people, I was\nin a new school. I did pretty well in school.",
        "A: Rita\u2019s book.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, what I knew about him. Okay, there \u2014 let\u2019s see, how long a time was it\nthat the Germans were there, and then the Russians came back?",
        "A: Three years.\nDecember 10, 2015",
        "A: Three years. Okay, so when \u2014 at one point, I remember that my father was \u2014 let\u2019s\nsee \u2014 yes. We left Sven\u00e9ionys, and moved to \u2014 where did it \u2014 Kupishkis.",
        "A: Because my father was arrested. I was on the farms. I and my brother were on\nthe farms with our uncles, and my grandmother was in the apartment in\nSvent\u00e9ionys, and my uncles went and picked her up. I think also in that period, that\nsummer, at one point, before our uncles, before I went to our farms, we were taken\nout of town. Now who took us, I don\u2019t remember. And we were placed somewhere\nin a very wooded place, somewhere in the woods, by some family, for a few weeks\nor a month or so. I\u2019m not sure how long. But then we all come together \u2014 I\u2019m\ntalking children \u2014 and we all left for my uncles\u2019 farms. And then, while there, at the\nend of the summer, time came to go to school, and my uncles rented an apartment\nfor my aunt and the three of us in Kupishkis, so that we could go to school.",
        "A: That was another new school. And I haven\u2019t lived in Kupishkis before. I didn\u2019t\neven \u2014 was not [indecipherable]. So I went to school there, and when I were \u2014 were\n\u2014 when we were in Kupishkis, we heard that my father was in prison. No, we \u2014\nbefore we came to Kupishkis, we were still at my uncles\u2019 farms, we heard that my\nDecember 10, 2015\nfather was arrested. He was in prison in Vilnius. And so my uncles found out about\nit. How, I don\u2019t know. I remember thinking that it was so unfair. The Russians took\nmy mother, and the Germans put my father in jail. And the school started, we\nmoved to shi \u2014 to Kupishkis, and there was a break in the fall, there was some kind\nof a holiday, and my aunt was ready to go to Vilnius, visit her father, and I was\ngoing to go with her. And just before we left, we received information that he was\nreleased.",
        "A: So he was released, he came to Kupishkis to see us, and then went to\nPanev\u00e9zys, where he was employed again.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Never went \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 back to Sven\u00e9ionys.",
        "A: The only way \u2014 I think after two \u2014 we mu \u2014 I must have spent two years in a\nschool in Sven\u00e9ionys.",
        "A: And it would have happened in the summer bef \u2014 after that.",
        "A: Probably, yeah.",
        "A: I did not really even know that.",
        "A: Yeah. I just knew that there were Poles living there.",
        "A: And I know from the history \u2014 by then I knew that there \u2014 because I le-learned\nsome history and geography, that Vilnius, and the part around Vilnius, after 1918\nwas left for the Poles. But as soon as the first communist occupation took place, that\npart of Lithuania was put back to Lithuania.",
        "A: Yes [indecipherable] \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 advantageous, you know. Yes, everybody \u2014 Lithuanians felt good. We have\nour land back.",
        "A: No. And if \u2014 I mean, if they \u2014 unless they were dressed differently, or went to s \u2014\nif they \u2014 I don\u2019t remember seeing a synagogue. I did not remember hearing any\nJews in the stores. Just on di\u2014 didn\u2019t see any Jews. No \u2014 no Jews ever came to our\nhouse, and I don\u2019t remember seeing any Jewish children in school. But then that\u2019s\nnot surprising because when I was in \u2014 in Svention\u00e9liai, I did not know if there\nwere any Jewish children in my school.",
        "A: They would not necessarily would have announced themselves as Jewish, or try\nto stand out.",
        "A: No. No. I don\u2019t know, it might have been discussed among my \u2014 my family, like\nmy uncles and my au \u2014 my grandmother, or even my aunt who lived with us. But\nthey never tried to tell us anything about it \u2014 about the fate of the Jews, or did we\nask? Now, why didn\u2019t we ask? Perhaps we were scared.",
        "A: If people are being arrested, you are scared. If you are small, and people are\nbeing arrested, especially if they were people that you knew \u2014 though I did not\nknow any Jews \u2014 I knew Jews in \u2014 in Jaimalas(ph), as store owners. But in\nSventionys, when we moved into Sventionys, I did not meet any Jews. And I \u2014I\nmean, I know what happened, but by the \u2014 when we arrived there, I would now\nthink that by then the Jews must have been rounded up and moved out of town.",
        "A: Because I know that Germans required that they wear \u2014 wore a yellow star. Now\nwhere did I find that out? Was it there, or much later? Probably still in Lithuania,\nbut I never saw anybody wearing it.",
        "A: A what?",
        "A: No.\n100December 10, 2015",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t think I met any Jews there, or knew what ha \u2014 was happening to\nthe Jews.",
        "A: No. I had \u2014 my \u2014 this is \u2014 sounds very stupid, but I had no 1\u2014 not really knew\nwhat my father\u2019s job involved.",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 yeah, well, it was security police, or \u2014 there were plenty of reasons to \u2014 to\nwant to be secure. I do remember an incident, because it was so talked about that,\nvery much, at that time. That there was a \u2014 an incident where a German \u2014 two\nGermans were in car, driving somewhere, not too far from Sven\u00e9ionys somewhere.\nAnd they had a translator, a woman. I assume she was a Lithuanian woman. And\nshe was connected with the partisans. We knew there were partisans in the woods.\nAnd she asked the Germans to stop the car because she needed to go to the woodsDecember 10, 2015\nto relieve herself. They stopped the car, and the partisans shot them. And then she\nwas arrested. The Germans picked her up, and I remember that there was \u2014 that\nthere were some German nat \u2014 Wehrmacht, with the brown shirts, had appeared in\ntown, ka \u2014 even were in our house, talking to \u2014 to my father, and I remember my\nfather making a remark to somebody that she would be better off dead. And I\nremember then hearing something that people were \u2014 were shocked because of this.\nI remember that they picked maybe that incident, or some other incident, the\nGermans picked up some \u2014 a couple men that \u2014 they were not Jews, I think they\nwere Poles, maybe Lithuanians, and shot them on \u2014 they took them to Jewish\ncemetery and shot them there, though they were not Jewish. And I remember I was\nvery \u2014 I was afraid. But then I don\u2019t know where they were buried, or not buried, or\nwhat \u2014 or what they were shot for, but I was afraid. And then the Germans kind of\ndisappeared again. There was not \u2014 I did not feel a strong German presence in this \u2014\nin Sven\u00e9ionys, because if you walked to school, if you walked to town, you didn\u2019t\nsee them.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: No.December 10, 2015",
        "A: No. You didn\u2019t. When this \u2014 things \u2014 things go like that, you don\u2019t feel safe. You\ndon\u2019t feel safe anywhere. So there were times in my very young life, where I was \u2014\nI mean, just the fact that my father was then arrested \u2014",
        "A: No. One did not ask. I mean, these things were \u2014 people were arrested. So, the\ngovernment, whoever they are at that point, has something against you, so they\narrested you. Why? Who knows? The whole system of justice was non-existent. It\nwas on on the whim of the government that was, at that time, 1n power. That\u2019s it.\nThey did not have to give any excuses or explanations. You could have been picked\nup walking down the street, and hauled off.",
        "A: Because it happened. Look, when my mother was taken away, there were\nthousands of people taken away. So \u2014",
        "A: No. Didn\u2019t even occur to ask me why.",
        "A: You know what? And also then, whatever was happening to the Jews at that\ntime, had I even known about it, that they were being arrested and hauled off, itDecember 10, 2015\nwould be just another thing happening. Can you \u2014 another crazy thing happening.\nScary. It\u2019s a very hard life. Very difficult time. It\u2019s interesting when I think about it,\nheck, here Iam. Wonder of wonders. I don\u2019t even lock my door. I did for a long\ntime, in my life. I did not feel safe. And then, you know, then we \u2014 we were in DP\ncamps.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Stay with th \u2014 with this \u2014 with this period in our life.",
        "A: About what, the book?\n104December 10, 2015",
        "A: No, I was not at all involved.",
        "A: No. The only \u2014 she came here once, with her husband, and my sister was here,\nand we had one conversation where I think she wa \u2014 she was in the process of\ngetting the book going. About our life in Sven\u00e9ionys, and what do we remember of\nthe war, and that period. And she did not feel that we gave her a very satisfactory\nanswers, that we knew enough about it. And it\u2019s true, you know. When you think of\nthis \u2014 if this \u2014 something like that started happening here, you would be up in arms.\nBut I was this young child, the country was up and down, first one invasion, then\nthe other invasion. There was no stable government of any sort. Nobody even\ntaught us about any government, stable or otherwise. So you just kind of stay with\nyour family, and mind your business, and you don\u2019t need to ask any questions. The\nrest was not up to us. The only thing I can say is, what you hear, what you\noverheard.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I thought she did a very good job writing the book. I thought she \u2014 not only she\nwrote a beautiful book \u2014 she\u2019s a very good writer \u2014 but also, she did as much\nresearch as was needed, and she wrote about things that I am \u2014 truly believe\nhappened.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And I can under \u2014 I expect her \u2014 I won\u2019t say interpretation, because it\u2019s not\ninterpretation, it\u2019s a fact \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that was going on. And now, knowing my father, as a grown person, though I\nalways have been his favorite child, and I love him dearly, I know that he was a\nvain man. I don\u2019t think he was a mean man, or a\u2014 a cruel man. But I think he was\nvain, and I think he could have easily fallen into a place where he will do things to\npromote himself. Now, how far he will go with that \u2014 as the book says, he went\npretty far. Just about as far as you can go. But then, none of that was ever discussed\n106December 10, 2015\nat the household. Never. And I have no \u2014 I really had no idea what a social \u2014 what a\nchief of security would do, because I never heard of that title.",
        "A: Never met anybody who was a chief of police \u2014 of security police.",
        "A: And, you know, if I had stayed, let\u2019s say, in Jaimalas(ph), where I knew that\nJews lived there, and where they lived, now, if th \u2014 I was \u2014 had I stayed there, and\nknow that they disappeared, I would have been more curious. Then I would have\nknown that something is happening, and what is happening.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, that they were arrested or taken away. The \u2014 the talk would be right\nthere about it. I was in \u2014 in a city and town that was larger. I had never been there. I\nnever knew there were any Jews there.",
        "A: Yeah, but then that\u2019s also \u2014 my father liked to drink now and then. He never was\nthe \u2014 a man who would sit down and get drunk by himself. But he would love \u2014 he\nloved company, and he would go \u2014 they would go out and they would drink atDecember 10, 2015\nsomebody\u2019s house usually, very seldom in taverns, or something \u2014 such thing.\nSomebody\u2019s house, usually.

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I obviously did not know what\u2019s going on. I did not know what was going on\nwith the Jews, and I did not know what my father\u2019s part was in it. After everything\nwas over, and I was learning history later on, and I was learning what happened,\nand thinking of my father in his \u2014 his place there, I can easily understand that she\ncould \u2014 that that could have happened. It did not take me by oh no, my daddy would\nnever do something like that, no.",

And we were married in Chicago,\nin a little Lutheran chapel on the University of Chicago grounds, because Stanley\nknew the minister.

        "A: So he said okay. So this \u2014 this minster said he will have a \u2014 he will marry us, and\nwe were married, and [break, phone ringing] Okay?\n110December 10, 2015",
        "A: I think my father was a bit \u2014 kind of the \u2014 he would have loved to have me marry\na Lithuanian. I mean, that was his choice. If it was not Lithuanian, I don\u2019t think he\ncared.",
        "A: And Stanley had no religious traditions. His mother had no religious traditions,\nand I did not have any Christian traditions beside \u2014 I did have a Christmas tree up,\nbut that was about it. And so, it did not even occur to me that there is something\nstrange that I marry a Jew.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: He was very \u2014 as I say, he \u2014 he would have preferred me that I married a\nLithuanian. The language, the history, the traditions. That he was a Jew, and he was\nnot a Lithuanian.

I had taken a train from Kupishkis to Panev\u00e9zys and back, but he never told\nme what he was doing. He was working for \u2014 for the \u2014 for something.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t sure. I knew he was not working in a store, selling something. I\nknew he\u2019d have to do something more likely with the \u2014 maybe the police, maybe\nthe army, or government, maybe? Do not know. And meanwhile, in Kupishkis,\nthings were going on a very even keel. Nothing important was happening. It was\ndifficult, there were shortages. And I remember for some crazy reason, I wanted to\nget a little goat. I set my heart on getting a little goat. So guess what? My\ngrandmother, or my aunt were able to get a pound of bacon. And for that pound of\nbacon, I got myself a goat.",
        "A: I did. I would walk around the town with a goat.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. And I would sometimes let her come into the house.",
        "A: She would slide on the floor. And if I left her outside, sometimes if she was\nloose, she would climb up the sand \u2014 sand hill \u2014 sand pile in front of our kitchen\nwindow and stand there and go mah, mah. [inaudible] So \u2014",
        "A: She was my go \u2014 my goat, yes. And when we left, I left my goat.",

        "A: And so my aunt, the three of us \u2014 how did we leave Kupishkis? I guess we took\na train to Panev\u00e9zys.",
        "A: Where did my father go? Maybe he was with us. Anyway, we ended up\nsomewhere in the west of Lithuania, not too far from the Baltic.",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 no, no, it was farther south. Some little \u2014 actually, some farmers that had a\nfarm and had a house and had a place way in the woods, and my father was there,\nand we stayed there for several months, I think. And I remember they \u2014 my father\nwould go hunting to get a deer, and my brother and I would go in the woods with\nhim, and we would \u2014 woods are separated in squares, I think. Anyway, there is a\npath in between, and my brother would go in the woods, and would go, making a lot\nof noise, to chase the deer out to \u2014 towards my father. And one day when we were\nout there, we found this package dropped, like a fairly large thing, lying in the\nwoods.",
        "A: Which looked like it had a parachute on it. So we called my father, we picked\nthis thing up, brought it to the farm, and my father opened it up with the farmer.\nThere was a lot of money there. Deutschmarks.",
        "A: And apparently what it was, probably it was a drop for Russians partisans, that\nmust have been hiding in the woods. I was scared. I really was scared then, 1n thatDecember 10, 2015\nplace. But shortly after that, divided the money, and we all loaded up a\u2014a ve\u2014a\ncart, and left for \u2014 left for Germany.",
        "A: Yes. We could go, we \u2014 not too far.",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "A: We \u2014 we were farther away from the sea.",
        "A: We crossed into Prussia. We crossed \u2014 we crossed the Nemunas \u2014",
        "A: \u20141n the evening. I still remember. My sister remembers me saying, oh what a\nbeautiful sunset over the river, that I wish it were not war. But \u2014 and the Russians\nreally were right on our tails.",
        "A: There were \u2014 after we crossed, there were a lot of people going. We had \u2014\nactually we had a bit of a problem crossing the bridge, because by then \u2014 we called\nthem the Brownshirts, who are crossing, and were pushing people away. But we\n117\nDecember 10, 2015\nsomehow happened to get aco \u2014 we were able to get across. After us, they \u2014 when\nwe crossed, they already had put explosives under the bridge, and they blew the\nbridge up soon after we went across, to slow down the Russians.",
        "A: So that was my life. I don\u2019t want to think about it.",
        "A: Have you wondered \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 why people don\u2019t want to sit and remember, the glorious days of my\nchildhood? No, thank you. I \u2014 I will be thinking of my glorious old age.",
        "A: And my little dog.",

        "A: Ona(ph) was with us, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Off we went. And by then \u2014 I remember that day. We would see German soldiers\nleaving for the front, and then later on we will see bloody German soldier \u2014\n119December 10, 2015\nsoldiers, going back. And we had \u2014 then we finally reached some town. I forget \u2014 it\nwas not Konigsberg, it was farther w \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 west.",
        "A: No, farther east. And we got somewhere, there was a railroad station. Oh, we\nwere in Gorlitz. Somehow we got there.",
        "A: How, I don\u2019t know. Anyway, we got on a train. We put all our packages to be\nsent, and my father had decided that we \u2014 we will go as far south as we can, so that\nthe Russians \u2014 when the Russians \u2014 when the war is over, which he was certain it\nwill be over very soon, that we would not be in the Soviet zone, but in the American\nzone. So we did. We went all the way to Bavaria.",

        "A: By train, yes. We went by train.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. It must have taken some time. I think we s \u2014 did we sleep\nsomewhere? We had money, remember, but nobody wanted any money by then.",
        "A: No, it was not worth anything. So, my father arranged it \u2014 he got a job working\non a farm in Bavaria, in Bad Bruhn(ph). Little village in Bavaria, on top of a ha \u2014\nsome \u2014 one of the hills, beautiful. I li \u2014 I lived in \u2014 the word slips me. In the parish\nhouse.",
        "A: There was a Lithuanian priest there, because the German priest was ill, and he\nwas in a sanitary. And his sister was a housekeeper. She was a good woman. Is \u2014 I\neven slept with her into a hu \u2014 in a huge, huge feather bed. The food was scarce.\nThere really wasn\u2019t that much. None of us were fat. And we stayed there til my\nfather worked on the farm. You couldn\u2019t see any men, there were only very old\nmen, or little boys. All other men were out in the fr \u2014 at the farm.",
        "A: Bad Brunn(ph).",
        "A: It\u2019s not far from Ingolstadt.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And Ingolstadt is not all that far from Munich. We would hear, in daytime,\nAmerican planes flying, lining up on top of our mount \u2014 hill, because our church\nwas a tall church, and they would line up there, and go and drop bombs on Munich.\nSo, we stayed there til the end of the war, and the way the end of the war came for\nme, it was like this. I was in the garden, looking for the first flowers, and I saw a\nJeep driving out of [break] \u2014 soup kitchen there, we had our choir where we sang.\nWe made \u2014 we put up plays, we \u2014 we lived a good life.",
        "A: All lithu \u2014 they tried \u2014 when they bil \u2014 when they organized the DP camps, very\ncleverly they tried to put the same nationalities together. So in that camp, there was\njust Lithuanians.",

        "A: We didn\u2019t want to go back.",
        "A: There was. The Russians send some kind of a delegation, where they\ninterviewed every single one of us, asking why did we stay here, and what brought\nus here. And we said, our teachers told us, just tell them your parents came and \u2014\nand so you went, you don\u2019t have any idea why. Which we did. And they all went\naway. They didn\u2019t take any \u2014 they couldn\u2019t take anybody.",
        "A: Under Soviet \u2014 yeah, they would have loved to get us back, I think, but they\ncouldn\u2019t.",

Truman helped take it \u2014 to take the\nrefugees into United States. Truman [indecipherable]. But you had to have\nassurances that you will have a job when you come. And my aunt, through the\nchurch, managed to come to United States, and she ended up in Jamesburg, NewDecember 10, 2015\nJersey. And from there, there were various possibilities. Some of us went to\nCanada, some of us went to Australia. I wanted to go to Australia, because it was\na long ride, and I thought that would be interesting to go. But I ended up in United\nStates. Came on General Hershey\u2019s boat.",

But my father had to get permission, and had to have some kind\nof a job guarantee also, and a permission to emigrate. So \u2014 and I \u2014 I was \u2014 as far as I\nwas concerned, I was in no hurry to go anywhere. I have \u2014",
        "A: I finish gymnasium, I moved into Ingolstadt, and I lived in a camp there.",
        "A: First, yeah we all [indecipherable] my aunt was already in United States. The\nthree of us and my father, they stopped us in Bremenhaven(ph). We stayed in a\ncamp there for a while, for a little while. And then they put us on General Hershey,\nand we all came to United States.",
        "A: Hm\u2019?",
        "A: Yes. I remember I did not know English, but I remember the cook on the boat.\nHe was telling us, oh, you will see, you will see. When you come close to United\nStates, you'll see this lady standing there, and she will say welcome, welcome.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember passing her. But we ended up in \u2014 in New York, and we\nwaited, and we waited, and we waited. And then \u2014 with all our belongings, which\nwere nothing, and then my aunt had sen \u2014 asked the son of the family that she\nworked for \u2014 it was actually a tavern there that she worked for, for that family in the\nkitchen. And she had the room there. She asked the son to come to New York and\nmeet us. So she \u2014 he finally found us there, and decided that we must be it. So sheDecember 10, 2015\npicked my father and the three of us up, and brought us to New Jersey, to\nJamesburg. And here we are.",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 not really all that much, because so many things were going on. She\nwas not there with us. Haven\u2019t heard from her, or about her, for all these years by\nnow.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t know if she was alive or not. She did not know if we were alive or not\neither. So \u2014",
        "A: Oh, because I travel on my own. I worked there \u2014 my first job was to work as a\nlive-in maid in New Brunswick, for a nice, little Jewish family. They had one son,\nAlan, who was six. And she was pregnant again, and she keep having miscarriages.\nSo she was advised by her doctors that she should not do anything. If she gets\npregnant, she practically go to bed and stay there.",
        "A: So they decided they have to hire somebody to live there and do work. They\nhired me. This young man who picked us up, drove me there, and I didn\u2019t \u2014 I do not\nknow English, and when they asked him what my name was, he said Gloria. So I\nwas Gloria. Oh boy, oh boy.",
        "A: I went back to Lithuania when I was married already.",
        "A: My son was 19.",
        "A: Seventies, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, Gerda(ph) and I, we both went back.",
        "A: It was still under Gorbachev.",
        "A: Uh-huh. The first time.",
        "A: Yeah.December 10, 2015",
        "A: When \u2014 you \u2014 you mean when I was \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Nobody told me anything.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t ask anything either.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. I mean, I knew what happened to the Jews in Lithuania, like what happened\nto the Jews everywhere, in Germany, and \u2014 and in \u2014 in France. Everywhere there\nwas \u2014 the Germans went. I knew that. What my father\u2019s role was in this, I had no\nclue. I did not think he was working for th \u2014 for the \u2014 for the Germans. So \u2014 soDecember 10, 2015\nSaugumo policija, security police, well, I did not know that was the German\nposition. I hardly ever saw Germans around.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t even see many Germans around in town. Very few. And when we got to\nGermany \u2014 oh, I tell you one thing, that probably be interesting. When we first\nmoved to Germany and got to Germany, in the south, and we were there in the s \u2014\nfirst we were in mul \u2014 was it Mulba(ph)? We stayed in some little hotel. And we\nhad these [indecipherable] cards, and we could buy food in the restaurant there, but\nthey \u2014 all they served you, there was just watery soup basically, that\u2019s it. And so my\nbrother and I, we take our marks, and would march out into the villages outside, and\nwe learned \u2014 we wanted to buy bread. We would say brot kaufen. Brot kaufen. It\nwas late fall, and I remembered the ground would be covered with beautiful pears\nthat just dropped off the trees. And the farmers will come out and bring big half\nloafs of this beautiful bread, and sometimes even \u2014 even some smoked meat. And\nwe could take as many pears as we wanted, and we would want to pay with our\nstupid marks, and they all said, no, no. They wouldn\u2019t take any money from us. But\nthat was something that I learned, being in Germany.\n129December 10, 2015",
        "A: I think they just saw two bedraggled \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. Asking for bread. They did not know if we had deutschemarks, or did not\nhave, how much it was, what were they worth, if anything, by then. So \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That I would like to say? [technical interruption]",
        "A: Well \u2014 [phone ringing][break] It sounds \u2014 when I tell you that, 1t sounds \u2014 it\u2019s\nsuch a remarkable, big story. Actually, very ordinary. In the li \u2014 in the times that I\nlived, it\u2019s nothing unusual. In the places that I lived. In the places that I came from,\nand the times that I lived. There are hundreds of s \u2014 of stories like mine. I don\u2019t\nknow how it all ended up for them, but I think most of us ended up somewhere in\nthe west. And did good \u2014 had good lives. And for myself, when I think, I had a very\ngood life. I mean, I had some hardships, and so on. When you are young, things are\neasy. Fortunately, I did not have any serious illnesses, and we were never wealthy,December 10, 2015\nbut we were never poor-poor. And the fact that I cannot see that much now, but I\nlive here, and I have a great deal of help.",
        "A: Perhaps. I think all our past influence our presents, to some extent. I don\u2019t think\nof it. Now and then if I am \u2014 if I \u2014 my brother is dead now, but when my brother\nwas alive, we would remember. And now and then, when I\u2019m with my sister, we\nsometimes talk about things. But then again, there is a seven year difference. But\nnow and then we can speak about the time in Germany, and how it was. Or how it\nwas when we first came here, to United States. That was an interesting thing, too. I\nmean, came here and no language. Gloria.",
        "A: And my sister went to high school here, she finished high school here. But I\ndon\u2019t think of my life as something extraordinary, or something greatly difficult, or\ntragic in any sense. It just what it was. I consider myself very lucky that I am here \u2014\nthe heat is coming on \u2014 that I have this house, that I am able to take care of this\nhouse. And that I know good people around me, and that Lithuania is free. I know\nthat they probably are fighting about the government all the time, but \u2014\n131December 10, 2015",
        "A: It\u2019s their choice. [indecipherable] is great friends now with a Jewish man, and I\nthink they will marry this spring, coming year. She changed her name to re \u2014 to\nRachel(ph), and I kind of think of her as Rachel(ph). She used to be dark \u2014 she had\ndark, curly hair, and now it\u2019s blonde and straight, very fashionable. She is nowhere\nas curious or interested, or searching as Rita is. David is doing okay, he works for a\nunivers \u2014 Boston University. He\u2019s saving his money so he could retire and come\nlive on the island.",
        "A: Yeah. And I really, in many things that happened to me, I could have ended, oh\nGod knows where.",
        "A: But there was a great deal of luck. I was able \u2014 we were able to get out of\nLithuania when we got out, and we were lucky enough to come to this country\nwhen we did. I had a good marriage, and ending up on this island, in this house, is\nnot bad.",
