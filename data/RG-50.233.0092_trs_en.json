        "MORGENSTERN, Abraham\nRG-50*233.0092\nOne audio cassette\nABSTRACT\nAbraham Morgenstern was born to Russian Jewish parents who had moved to Lublin,\nPoland around 1921. He was reared in a contemporary religious family, and attended\nPolish public school and a Jewish school. He graduated from business school at 16 just\nbefore war broke out in 1939. That year, the Russians took over his town, which\nprotected them for a short time.\nAfter the Germans invaded Poland, they shot about 99 percent, some 150 of Lublin\u2019s\nbest- educated, professional Jews.\nAbe asserts that no Jews in Lublin tried to escape. Lublin\u2019s two ghettos were established\non April 1, 1942, and the Morgensterns were moved into one of them that month. Food\nbecame very scarce.\nAbe\u2019 father and sister perished during the first of four actions. Abe says that no Jews\nfrom his area were taken to concentration camps; they were shot in the woods and put\ninto mass graves.\nAbe does not provide many details about how he and his mother survived, except to say\nthat she bribed some people. He refers the interviewer to an unnamed book he wrote.\nAbe mentions labor camps, one in Kamionka. One was burned down, killing the camp\ninmates. Abe reported a few times to the Judenrat, which took him to work temporarily at\na factory and then at a camp. But eventually, he says, \u201cI just stayed home.\u201d\nToward the end of the war, Abe and eight others dug a hole where they hid until Russian\ntroops found them; about two weeks after the Russians had liberated the area.\nAfter the war, he and his mother immigrated to Italy. They had planned to go to Palestine\nwhere they had relatives, but did not go because they did not know the relatives\u2019 names\nor addresses.\nAbe says that of Lublin\u2019s estimated 10,000 Jews, only about 200 survived -- 50 or 60 in\nthe city, and about 150 who had escaped to Russia.\nA: The minute they came to that city going to Poland already in 1921, I think that\u2019s\nwhere they smuggled the border from Russia to Poland and my father met quite a\nfew people that he knew from before that already came ahead of him to that city,\nand he found some cousins and whatever. He also, I guess, was offered a\nposition, a good position. He managed a flourmill, and my mother got pregnant\nand so there was an excuse not to go. Then when I came already, my father didn\u2019t\nfeel like leaving. He was a little established already and he felt good there. He had\na lot of people that he knew and it was a nice town, a religious town and that\u2019s\nhow we stuck there.",
        "Q: Was your family observant, religious?",
        "A: 99% of the Jewish people were orthodox. There was no other section that didn\u2019t,\nonly orthodox. Some were modern, some were old-time religious but my father\nhad no beard and he was --. In that mill, as I say, later when I was growing up, he\nwas traveling to villages and little towns buying grains from the peasants. Then\nhe was giving them to the casino and that\u2019s how he made his living at that time. I\nwent to public school and in the afternoon I went to cheder which was a Jewish\nschool. Then later on when I was like 11, 12, 13, I went to Hebrew School in the\nafternoon for two, three years. We learned other subjects too beside Hebrew.",
        "Q: You went to that school solely, you didn\u2019t go to the public school any more?",
        "A: Yes, yes. I said I went to the public school till I was 13 and finished. Up there\nyou go seven years public school. I finished public school in 1936. There were\ntwo higher schools after that. One was the gymnasium they called it which was\nrun by the state, and the other one was business school. It was also -- it wasn\u2019t run\nby the state, it was private but they were on the same level. You had to wear\nuniforms and you had to get exams before being admitted. I went three years\nthere and I graduated in 1939. There, besides all the other subjects, you learned --\nthey also taught me German. I took German language. You could take French or\nGerman. I choose German so I\u2019m familiar with the German language too.",
        "Q: What did you speak in your home?",
        "A: Polish.",
        "Q: Polish?",
        "A: Yes. I didn\u2019t learn Yiddish till almost the wartime. I knew it from the people\nspeaking all around but I never spoke it and all my friends, we always spoke\nPolish with all my friends. In the cheder, what we went when I was small yet, I\ncould speak to the teacher in Yiddish that time but we never spoke --. As a matter\nof fact my parents in the beginning, even later, they spoke Russian between\nthemselves too because they were from Russia. But my mother wanted me to\nknow the Polish language so she spoke Polish to me and my sister.",
        "Q: You had just one sister?",
        "A: Yes, one sister, two years younger, yes. As I said, you asked me about religious;\nmy father traveled most of the week, he was in other towns but he make sure he\ncomes back Friday afternoon to make Shabbos home and he went to the shul\nSaturday. He took me most of the time to shul, I remember, and holidays no\nquestion about it. On a Saturday most of the business people were Jews in the\ncity. Very few gentiles had businesses, some had but the majority was Jewish.\nCome Saturday, the stores were closed up. It may be singles, Jewish stores, they\nwere open like candy stores, or a drugstore or something like that. The rest was\nshut up completely. Some were open Sundays; they allowed some stores to be\nopened Sundays, holidays and Saturdays everybody closed. Even the people that\nonly went to the synagogue on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, they still\nobserved the holidays.",
        "Q: Did you live right in the city, right in the town?",
        "A: We lived in quite a few places. Me and my family didn\u2019t own a house so we had -\n- we\u2019re renters. I guess we rented wherever was convenient, wherever the job\nwas. Then when I guess they wanted more money or whatever, the family wanted\na bigger place, we had to move. I remember moving like three or four times,\ndifferent places. From one end of the city to the middle city, to the outskirts,\nwhatever.",
        "Q: I see. Did your mother work?",
        "A: No. Women didn\u2019t work before. My mother always stayed home.",
        "Q: Did you ever work with your father at all? Did you ever --?",
        "A: He used to take me sometimes on a trip. My father used to own one of these\nhorse and carriages like you see in Central Park or something like that for\npleasure. He used to keep it at somebody\u2019s stable but when he went out of town\nhe used to go with -- he used to rent a drive of it with a horse and carriage that\nyou could bring the grain back on that. It was like a commercial type horse and\nbuggy, not a pleasure. As far as taking me, he\u2019d take me -- most of the time he\nwould take me -- he went to a place where we had some kind of relations, distant,\nwhatever, my father knew. He would leave me there for the day, with his\nbusiness and I would be there with other youngsters for me. Distant, distant\nrelatives or acquaintances whatever. As far as working, I did not work but upon\nthe graduation of the business school in 1939, my father took me to that flourmill\nwhere he used to manage before Even though he was out already, maybe ten\nyears out of that place, no not ten years, maybe seven or so, he took me to the\noffice there. He knew the people, the accountants in the office and the managers\nand they interviewed me and they gave me a test and they hired me as of the first\nof September. I had a position in the bookkeeper\u2019s office there. I was very\nhappy, I didn\u2019t have to -- in other words I got it through my father. I didn\u2019t get it\non my own because I was green at that time, 16 years.",
        "Q: Was this a Jewish firm?",
        "A: Yes, yes. It was a big mill, a very large mill, exported flour all over the world.\nThere were two mills in the city, both Jewish, different ends of the town. The\nmills are there today, they\u2019re there today, the mills are there.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, of course, sure. They employed a lot of people.",
        "Q: At this point, your father was more of an independent? He was more of a\nmerchant, a grain merchant?",
        "A: He was self-employed. When he left -- the reason he left the mill there, it was\nsold. The people that they sold the mill, the owners came from Lvov, you\u2019re\nfamiliar with this city, probably you\u2019 ve read about it, it was a big city in the\nUkraine. So the new owners came and I don\u2019t know whether they let him go or it\nwas -- I don\u2019t know the details, I never asked. But since then he didn\u2019t work there\nbut he was very friendly with the people, even with the new owners. The people,\nthey sold the mill, opened up a new one at the other end of the town, somehow.\nThey built a new one or they built and then they sold it, whatever it was, I don\u2019t\nknow. He knew the people there and that\u2019s how he got me the job. Of course, I\nnever got the chance to put in one day\u2019s work because the first of September I had\nto report, that\u2019s when it happened.",
        "Q: Right, right. What happened on that day in your town?",
        "A: In our town, what it happened they -- the day before they proclaimed a general\nmobilization. It was very touch-and-go for the last few weeks there before that\ndate. It was the German propaganda and Hitler\u2019s speeches, you know, was\nbroadcast all over. They demanded Danzig, it\u2019s a port city there. They gave in to\nthis and he demanded something else after that. They knew that they cannot get\nout of it, he\u2019s going to attack sooner or later. The minute that they declared the\nmobilization, it was a Friday night or something, the next day or so they declared\nwar. Germany declared, they attacked first and then they declared.",
        "Q: During the mobilization, what did they expect from everybody?",
        "A: The people had to report to their points. Whoever was 21 years old had to report,\nmobilize. There was a general mobilization and all doctors, dentists were\nmobilized and put into uniform right away and sent to different parts of Poland.\nThey did it quick but our city was not -- was at the other end -- was at the eastern\nend of Poland. So it was not attacked, was not attacked by the Germans, they\nconcentrated a little bit the other way, the western part, that\u2019s where they attacked\nfrom, the western part. It dragged on like this for about two weeks. People\nstarted to evacuate from Warsaw and Lodz (?) and different cities. We used to\nsee a lot of cars coming through with people in it. On top of the\nRomanian border. We were very close to the Romanian and Russian border, was\nlike 30 kilometers or something to the Romanian border, or 35, just nothing.\nThey all had cars, most of them with cars, people, not only Polish people, Jewish\npeople too, they had means and they didn\u2019t want to be caught. They figured\nthey\u2019ll go to Romania and Romania was independent and from there they would -\n-. Actually, they did and people that went to Romania, they wound up in\nEngland. All the Polish escapees wound up in England.",
        "Q: It was the way to go, even to Palestine, that route.",
        "A: To Palestine, you couldn\u2019t go because the British wouldn\u2019t let them go.",
        "Q: The mandate had --?",
        "A: They wouldn\u2019t let go but the English government would let the Polish people\ncome into England. They went -- it\u2019s a long way around but that\u2019s how they\nmanaged.",
        "Q: Did your father ever think about leaving?",
        "A: No, at that time, why? Where would we go? First of all, we had no means of\ntransportation, where you going to go. It was a city of nine to ten thousand Jews\nand nobody tried to escape, actually nobody. Some Polish people did, officers\nevacuated some families and police, almost to the last day, the police, the firemen,\nthey stayed will the last day. Almost the last day, they evacuated. What\nhappened between those two weeks, it took about two weeks till the 17\" of\nSeptember; it was a Sunday morning and Germany was successful in occupying\nalready quite a bit of -- most of -- about two-thirds of Poland. I think the only\nplace that still was not occupied was Warsaw. They lasted almost a month.\nSomebody, I guess rumors started to fly or somebody knew already, they said\nwithin a few hours the Russian army is going to be here. It didn\u2019t take long, an\nhour or two and we heard shelling or something. They were going, the Russian\narmy was advancing and just shooting so that the people don\u2019t attack them. They\ndidn\u2019t know who the Polish army is still there or the police, they had no idea.\nThey were just like shelling like over the cities to announce that they are here.\nWhoever didn\u2019t escape yet from the government tried to get out. But there was no\nfighting, there was no damage. It was very festive when they actually showed up.\nTheir tanks and the artillery, the cavalry; actually the whole town went out to\ngreet them in the streets, special there was a lot of -- not only Jewish people but\nsome Poles too that they were socialists or communists or whatever. There was\nno communist Party, it was illegal but there were people that believe in socialism\nand they were the first ones to greet the soldiers and run the city right from the\nbeginning.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure your father and mother weren\u2019t among them?",
        "A: No, no. My father never mixed in politics. That\u2019s how it started. Once the\nRussians went by -- they went by and the next day they send in people to run the\ncity. The mayor became one of the -- our own people sitting in jail in the other\npart of Poland, in the north somewhere belonging to the communist party. They\ncame back, they let out the prisons from there. They came back to the city, one of\nthem became a mayor. He rode a horse and became a mayor. They figured he\nwas a man that was way back, a card member, he sat in jail. So they gave him the\nhonor of being a mayor but not for long, a week or two, then they appointed their\nown; they brought in their own people to manage the city. A little bit later, they\nbrought their families and they took over the buildings where the Polish officers\nused to live with their families which was evacuated already and they settled\nthere. Later on they even took over Jewish apartments and they settled the\nRussians and things like that. They nationalized the buildings and everything.",
        "Q: What was the first effect on your family or yourself?",
        "A: Well the effect was positive. First of all, my parents come from Russia and with\nthe Russian army, they could communicate and then they started to organize\ndifferent businesses, everything under the government control. They were\nlooking for anybody with managerial experience and my father was pulled in right\naway in a good position.",
        "Q: He had experience and he could speak Russian?",
        "A: Experience and he went into a grain concern that the Ukrainians had established.\nA grain concern and they knew about him and they took him in to manage a\ncertain thing. Then he took me into the office and that\u2019s how I got a job. I worked\nthere almost two years in the bookkeeping department.",
        "Q: Was that also a positive experience?",
        "A: Yes, very positive because they treated the Jews very nicely. You know the\nRussian authorities at that time, most of the occupiers. The officers, the big and\neven the private people that were brought in, a big majority were Jewish people\nfrom Russia. It was a very positive thing for the Jewish people. It was very\npositive for the Ukrainian but it was not so positive for the Poles. Poles were\nlooked a little bit down because the Russians said that they came to liberate us\nfrom the Polish yoke or whatever. So the Poles had a difficulty of getting a good\nposition. Also then a couple of months later, they established everybody from 16\nyears and a half had to get a passport, the Russian passports with pictures. We\nhad to go to register. People went to register according to their professions,\nwhatever they did. If anybody owned a business before, they marked on the\npassport that this man is a businessman or if he had a son over 16, the son would\nbe marked son of a businessman. With that passport you couldn\u2019t land a good\nposition already because you were considered a capitalist. That\u2019s how they\nmarked the passports. Also you had to put your nationality, Jew, Pole or\nUkrainian They had in their passports what it was, even till today. All my friends\nthat their parents were in business and they had problems getting jobs. Being that\nmy father was not marked as a businessman on his passport, he was, through him\nI was able to get in a few of my friends to that concern too.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about being indoctrinated about communism?",
        "A: Oh yes, sure, of course. They had lectures, public lecture forums that you go. At\nthat time already it was a few months after they established already their rule. As\na matter of fact, they have it in the book. One of the lectures that I remember, we\nworked in the grain concern. Most of the grains were being shipped to Germany.\nAt that time already, Germany took two-thirds of Poland and they took one-third.\nThey divided between themselves. But at that time already there was a little\nfriction between both of them somehow. There were not such good relations and\nyet they were shipping all the grains out to them. I remember asking that question\nto one of the officers that was giving the lecture. They had special propaganda\nmen that worked in uniform and they were lecturers, special lectures. I asked\nhim, how could we ship to them the grains that being they\u2019re already trying to tell\nus that they\u2019re not friends, they\u2019re like enemies. They\u2019re trying to build up their\nthing against us or whatever. He says, no we have to buy time and the amounts\nthat we give them are negligible but from our concern most of them went there.\nHe says we have to buy time to be prepared. They were preparing the building\nairfield outside the city.",
        "Q: The Russians were?",
        "A: Yeah. The Russians were. I was roped in to go to that airfield on my vacation to\nwork there.",
        "Q: What was the feeling in the town at that time? Was it that things are stable or --?",
        "A: It was a stable feeling, it was stable. They opened up a Jewish gymnasium what it\nwasn\u2019t before. Before it was like a public; they opened up a separate Jewish\ngymnasium with Jewish language, Hebrew, Jewish and most of the Jewish kids\nthat want to go to a gymnasium would go into that gymnasium. The Poles already\nhad no gymnasium no more. The Ukrainians did have their Ukrainian\ngymnasium, the Poles had no gymnasium. That\u2019s how they were treated.",
        "Q: Really lost those --?",
        "A: Yes, they were really mad at the Poles. Didn\u2019t let us forget; they thought that\nbecause the Jews were more favored than them, they thought that they had to pay\nus back later. It\u2019s one of the reasons they claimed that we were patsies with the\nRussians and most we are communists.",
        "Q: What about when you had to go build the airfield?",
        "A: Well, it happened already very close to the June \u201941 when Russia was attacked. I\nhad my vacation in May.",
        "Q: You thought, you had your vacation!",
        "A: I thought, right. I had a vacation in 1940, I had one vacation for two weeks. But\nin 1941, I was scheduled to go to a --. They had special places where they sent\npeople that worked nice in the offices, they worked good and they deserved a\nlittle break, they would send them paid vacations to a place where it\u2019s like a resort\narea. I was scheduled to go on my two weeks to that resort area. Here like a\nweek before it, a week before my vacation, I was called into the office of the\ndirector and he said, he says, I know that you must realize that how we are trying\nup an army and we have to get prepared because the Germans keep saying they\u2019re\ngoing to attack us and they built up a very big might against us. Everybody has to\nsacrifice and being I\u2019m a good citizen or whatever, each office has to concentrate\nto the building of the airfield. Being that they cannot spare nobody from the\noffice because it\u2019s a busy concern when my vacation comes up, that I should\nvolunteer to g to that airfield. He says you\u2019re going to get paid for your vacation,\nyou\u2019re going to get paid for there. But this was like six or seven kilometers out of\nthe city with no transportation but I had no choice. You couldn\u2019t say no.",
        "Q: No choice but to volunteer?",
        "A: Right, no choice but to volunteer. Otherwise I\u2019d be fired or whatever and I went\nthere to the airfield place. They interviewed me and they said okay, whatever that\nday was. Next Monday you\u2019re starting, have to be there six o\u2019clock in the\nmorning. It was, I don\u2019t remember how I got there the first day, I really don\u2019t\nremember. My father had somebody drive me most of the time. I know I walked\none time. I walked. They took me up there and they had mobilized all the\npeasants from the vicinity, all around from that area, mobilized under duress.\nOtherwise they didn\u2019t get even paid. Whoever had a horse and buggy was\nmobilized and they had to transport all kinds of materials from the warehouses\nand back to that place where they\u2019re building the airport. They had engineers,\nthey had a lot of Russians and they were walking on the ground and it was just a\nbig, big field, a tremendous field. From scratch they had to stop and build that\nairport. I was there two weeks and I think the second or the third day, I got\nacquainted with a Russian fellow that he was in the Russian army but he was in\ncivilian clothes. He was something, a demolition expert or whatever and he was\nworking underground something. He had a truck, he was driving a truck, they run\nthe little trucks or something We got acquainted and he says; I said I would like -\n-. I walked home, that\u2019s what it was, the first day I walked home. Quite a bit to\nwalk, an hour and a half or whatever I don\u2019t remember, an hour or more. He said\n-- | invited him. If you want to come to the house, you can have supper with us,\nfigured he\u2019ll give me a ride which he did. I says you come to the house and you\ncan even stay there overnight. In the morning you'll come back.",
        "Q: You\u2019re still living with your parents and sister?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Unannounced he brought me home. I introduced him and he was a nice\nfellow. He had supper with us and he slept one night and in the morning, he went\nback with the truck. That\u2019s how we were going every day. So it turned out to be\nnot bad for me; you know I had transportation. Otherwise, I probably wouldn\u2019t be\ncoming home every day, I\u2019d probably sleep there somewhere. The two weeks\nwent by, two weeks went up. I went back and somebody else\u2019s vacation came up\nand they sent him.",
        "Q: What did you do at the airfield? Was it labor?",
        "A: No, no. It was office work. What I actually did, the peasants were hauling sand.\nFrom wherever they were bringing the sand here somehow and I had to give them\nreceipts for how much sand they had to bring a full load of sand and I gave them\nthe receipts for the loads. I had to go check if they didn\u2019t lose on the way half or\nwhatever. I gave them receipts. They were lined up for stretches and stretches of\nthose things from morning until the night. They were working around the clock;\nthey had two shifts from six to six. My shift was from six in the morning until six\nat night.",
        "Q: The receipts were just to show that they had done this?",
        "A: They had done this and with those receipts they were promised they would get\npaid eventually. They never did.\nQ> __Isee. Because it was too late?",
        "A: Even so, they never had intentions of honoring them.",
        "Q: And then what? After you went back tothe  ?",
        "A: I went back to the --. Then June 21, Germany attacked. They attacked the --.",
        "Q: Did you know, did you have the feeling that this was going to occur?",
        "A: No way, no way. As a matter of fact I went to the beach that Sunday. The beach\nwas empty and I couldn\u2019t understand why there was almost nobody there. Very\nfew -- I usually meet my friends there; we play cards, whatever.",
        "Q: This was on the lake?",
        "A: No, it was on a river, river. We had beaches by the river. It\u2019s a nice story; I go\ninto detail actually.",
        "Q: I look forward to it. What was the first clue that there was an invasion?",
        "A: The first clue was that I usually meet my friends like I got up in the morning. We\nhad no radio in the house. Very few people had radios; telephones, only doctors\nand professionals would have a telephone. Got up at eight o\u2019clock, it was a nice\nsunny day and I went to the beach, a 15 or 20 minutes walk and I went to the\nbeach. Close to nine o\u2019clock usually my friends would show up already and\nnobody\u2019s there. Here and there, there\u2019s somebody there, you know. Go for a\nswim by yourself, how much can you be in the water by yourself. I go out just\nwaiting for people to show up so we usually play cards. Then somebody around\nten o\u2019clock, somebody shows up. He says what are you people doing here? Don\u2019t\nyou know there\u2019s a war? That\u2019s how I found out. Actually they bombed already\ncities at four o\u2019clock in the morning. Four o\u2019clock in the morning, Kiev was\nbombed, Lvov, other cities, Vilna, quite a few cities were bombed. Our city was\nbombed too but a little bit later, they bombed our city. That\u2019s how I found out.",
        "Q: Were you mobilized or --?",
        "A: Well, in 1941 people one year older than me were mobilized in 1941. Their year\nwas called. Whoever was born in 1922, was 19 years old, they were mobilized\nlike in March and April already, they went to be inducted. At that time when the\nwar broke out, they didn\u2019t mobilize any more except whoever was still around\nwho was not sent away to the points where they train you, they would send them\nright away. Again it was two weeks till the Germans came and they started to\nevacuate. The first week was normal. They attacked but they were holding their\nground for the first four or five days or something. But then they broke through\nthe lines and it was disaster. The first week we were still going into the office and\nthen some of the Russian directors were evacuating their families already,\nmobilizing some cars or trucks if they had. In our concern too, the director was\ntaking trucks and horse and buggies, putting furniture and stuff and sending\nfamily back to Russia. We were just standing there. The Jewish people started\nthinking about the evacuation because whoever was in the police, or whoever was\ncommunist or something, they didn\u2019t want to take chances. I think the second\nweek already, it was like they were running. Soldiers were coming back\nfrom the fronts in trucks full with soldiers. People tried to get rides with them;\nsome did, some couldn\u2019t succeed. Again my family wouldn\u2019t think of running;\nnot only mine, the majority didn\u2019t think of anything. Even though we knew that\nthe Germans, they\u2019re against the Jews but nobody thought of something\nhappening whatever happened.",
        "Q: Had you heard any stories about Germans?",
        "A: Of course we heard. We heard stories from the other parts of Poland what they\nwere two years already there. That they mobilized some people to camps, labor\ncamps. They worked them for nothing; some guys, sometimes they cut\nsomebody\u2019s beard off and things like that. There was no concentration camps,\nthere was no -- at that time there was no extermination, nobody even thought\nabout it in 1941. After they attacked Russia, they started there too, they started to\ndo.",
        "Q: Were there refugees coming through your city?",
        "A: Oh yes. We had German refugees; they were coming in 1938 yet. Germany\nthrew out Jewish people that their ancestry was from Poland. They brought them\nup to a Polish border station and left them there. Then different communities\ntried to absorb some of them even though it was in the west part of Poland, some\nwound up by us. Most of them had some family or some relations, they came\nhere but some didn\u2019t. Some were trying to actually work their way to get into\nRussia. They figure they go to the eastern part of Poland, maybe they\u2019ll be able to\nget across the border to Russia. We had quite a few refugees here. Again, that\nwas the worst thing that happened to them. They threw them out of Germany.",
        "Q: Right, right. You see trucks with Russian soldiers going through and kind of\nfleeing --?",
        "A: Civilian Russians, civilians too evacuating. It was the second week all civilians,\nRussians with their families were evacuating --?",
        "Q: Then your city was bombed, soon after that?",
        "A: The city was bombed right at the end of the evacuation when the German planes\nand the Russian planes were still fighting each other.",
        "Q: Do you remember seeing planes flying overhead?",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t stick my nose out. We were sitting in the basements because they\nwere shelling. Before the Germans came there were a few nights, there was\ntremendous shelling. There were -- opposite sides -- shells were flying all\nthrough the night. The whole house shook every time. Nobody put their head\nout. As a matter of fact, wherever we lived at the time, there was a lot of gentile\npeople lived there in that section. In that cellar, there was mostly gentile people\nthere. But nobody would stick their head out. I had a chance to go there --= [Il\njust make it short. The fellow that I acquainted at the airfield, the second week of\nthe evacuation, a tank pulls up in front of our house. Everybody got scared in the\nneighborhood, a tank, what\u2019s a tank doing here? A Russian tank pulled up. A\nguy comes out and goes up to our house. That\u2019s the fellow, he came with a tank.\nHe came to take me with us. He says we are evacuating, the Germans are going\nto be here any day and come with me, I'll take you back to Russia. You might be\nin trouble here, you know, the Jewish people won\u2019t have it so good. There was a\ndiscussion between my father and my mother, should they go, should they not go.\nI was like, I had nothing to say probably but I didn\u2019t want to go. I know I didn\u2019t\nwant to go. I wasn\u2019t ready yet to be on my own. They decided not to let me go,\nmy mother especially, they don\u2019t want to let me go. He left and also at the same\ntime, maybe a day different, quite a few youngsters a little bit older than me,\nmaybe a year or two older from the neighborhood, walked out from their homes.\nSaid goodbyes and they all wear these knapsacks on them and they said whoever\nwants to join them, they\u2019re going. They\u2019re going to try to reach Russia. They\nwent out, on the outskirts and that\u2019s all we saw of them. But about two or three\ndays later, they came back. They came back, they couldn\u2019t get rides with nobody\nand they couldn\u2019t go by foot. They all came back. Then this fellow came with\nthe tank, he didn\u2019t go to Russia either.",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No, I met him later, that\u2019s a story besides. They didn\u2019t -- they told him to stay\nback and he posed as a Ukrainian. Just met him by chance on the street. I was in\na march for labor, something during the German occupation, and I met him on the\nstreet. He wouldn\u2019t look at me, we just looked at each other and then he put his\nhead down. He didn\u2019t want to -- I was marching in a group so of course, I\ncouldn\u2019t say nothing. Then when we were marched back, he was waiting there in\na corner and he came over to me. He said something, you know I\u2019m here and\nnobody knows, nobody is supposed to know who I am. He says I was on my way,\nthey send me back.",
        "Q: When did the first German forces enter your town?",
        "A: I think it was like July 7 or 6. I have the date in the book exactly. From the 21\u201c\nof June till July 6 or 7.",
        "Q: What was the first appearance of the German occupation?",
        "A: Well, first of all, again, it was a Sunday, the Germans came in. We were not in\nthe street; we were in the basement all night. In the morning we went back to the\nrooms and then one of the neighbors came in. She says the Germans are in town\nalready and you better don\u2019t dare to go out on the street. They\u2019re catching Jews\nor whatever. Of course we didn\u2019t. A little bit later, there was a knock on the\ndoor, the same day, and it was in the afternoon, early in the afternoon. Two\nUkrainian policemen were there; there were no Ukrainian police before, all of a\nsudden, there\u2019s Ukrainian police, uniforms and rifles. We didn\u2019t know at the time\nbut that day also they proclaimed independent Ukraine with the capitol in Lvov.\nThe Germans let them have an independent Ukraine. They had prepared already,\nevidently they were prepared for that. They had uniforms already. So they came\nand they came into the house and they took my father out.",
        "Q: Did they give a reason?",
        "A: Yes, they need him for work. My mother was pleading and crying and pleading.\nWe didn\u2019t live in the city, we lived outside. It wasn\u2019t a Jewish section at all.\nThey had plenty, there were sections where there were a lot of Jews and why they\ncame here, they had to cross a bridge --. The minute they knocked on the door,\nme and my sister, we were hiding under the bed or somewheres in the bedroom\nand they took my father. My mother was crying and of course we thought he\u2019 Il\nnever come back. He didn\u2019t show up till late in the evening, he came back which\nit was like a miracle too. He says they did take him to work something by the\nriver, whatever he had to do. Him and whoever else they caught. He says they\ndidn\u2019t beat him and when they finished whatever they were doing; they let him\ngo. It was the first experience. Second experience with the Germans, the next\nday already.. We didn\u2019t go any more in the basement because there was no more\nshelling already so we stayed in the room. We still didn\u2019t dare to go in the street.\nNow I don\u2019t remember if it was the second day or the third day, a lot of German\ncars, motorcycles pulled up in our street. They stopped on the street and some of\nthem came into the -- we had like a yard in the front and they put in their\nmotorcycles in the yard. They were knocking on the doors; evidently they were\nshown where Jews lived. They were not youngsters, they were officers, elderly\nguys and they were from the army. Evidently they were asking where Jews are\nliving not because -- we didn\u2019t know, the minute we saw these things we tried to\nrun down the basement over there by that time. But my mother stayed out and\nwhat they were looking for, they were looking for Jewish people in order to\ncommunicate. Because they couldn\u2019t communicate with the other people and\nmost of the Jews knew German somehow because the Yiddish and German is\nvery similar. They stopped for a rest and they had all kinds of provisions with\nthem and they want us to cook. They want the women to cook for them the stuff\nand they should have their break and eat and then they go further. That\u2019s what\nhappened.",
        "Q: Who cooked for them?",
        "A: My mother and then there was another family there, you know. So that\u2019s what\nthey came for.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t ask any questions of you?",
        "A: No, no. They just ate. She cooked the meal; they gave some to us. I think they\ngave my mother some stuff what they had and then they went on their way.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s flip the tape over.\nEND OF SIDE A (ONLY ONE TAPE)",
        "A: It was the first time we saw the German soldiers. Otherwise, we didn\u2019t stick our\nhead out.",
        "Q: Again your father hadn\u2019t been harassed again, just that once?",
        "A: No. Well, then the holidays came in and we -- of course we couldn\u2019t go anywhere\nto pray. We started from the neighborhood. We gathered some people and we\nmade like a little gathering in our house.",
        "Q: This was like Rosh Hashanah?",
        "A: This was already Yom Kippur. Rosh Hashanah we didn\u2019t pray because it was that\ntime when it happened that they --. We prayed there, people prayed there. All of\na sudden somebody came in the neighborhood and said that Ukrainian police is\ncoming. They see Ukrainian police coming up the street. Everybody ran, you\nknow, they took off the prayer shawl and went to their homes. Some from a little\nfurther away, they had to stay, disperse a little bit. That\u2019s what they were\ncoming, to check if Jewish people praying.",
        "Q: Had there been some decree that Jews weren\u2019t allowed to pray?",
        "A: There were a lot of decrees but this was right -- was only a day or two away or\nthree from where they -- we didn\u2019t even go out nothing. Then there were decrees,\na lot of decrees. I think within the first week they started decrees. First the Jews\nhad to register. They imposed the Jewish community leadership. Otherwise they\ncame to the -- there was a Jewish vice-mayor. The vice-mayor was Jewish, he\nwas a lawyer. They came to him and they said you better organize a Jewish\ncommunity.",
        "Q: The Ukrainian police?",
        "A: No, no, the Germans, already the Germans came. There was a building from the\nJewish community and they found out who was the vice-mayor. They came to\nthe leader\u2019s house and they says we want in 24 hours we want a Jewish\ncommunity leadership so we can communicate and give directions, whatever.\nThey had a problem to organize it because people didn\u2019t want to serve on it\nvoluntarily. They don\u2019t want to be involved with the Germans at all. Because\nyou expose yourself once you did. This vice-mayor tried to get some of his\nfriends and acquaintances and little by little they organized a community\nleadership. Then the Germans had proclaimed announcements all over the town\nthat --.",
        "Q: Posters?",
        "A: Posters, yes, that we had no announcing on the radio. There was no such thing.\nThey had special places with their posters and that\u2019s how you announced\neverything. Every street had different places where they announced what\u2019s going\non and that the Jewish people have to register at the community center in order to\nreceive food stamps, rations, food rations; otherwise you have to be registered.\nThere was no kind of register, you would not receive rations. They didn\u2019t say you\nwould be punished or something just have to register. The same thing, the gentile\npopulation had an announcement. They have to register in their places wherever\nso most of the people went to register. When you registered, I didn\u2019t go, my\nfather went and he registered. They asked him his profession from before and\naddress and everything and he registered. Then I think a week or two later you\nhad to go and pick up the rations. It was very small rations that they gave you.\nWhatever they gave, the Jews got half of it. Then every day different posters. If\nanyone has a radio, he has to turn it in. Anybody has a telephone, he has to turn it\nin. You cannot walk on the sidewalk, any Jew cannot walk on the sidewalk.\nEvery Jew must have an armband with the Star of David, a white armband with a\nblue Star of David. It has to be so many centimeters, ten or whatever and it has to\nbe worn on the left arm. Again, different -- no Jew can have a business. If he has\na business, he has to take in a gentile partner but at that time already the Russians\ntook the businesses away and there wasn\u2019t that many. They still had businesses,\nthere were some their stores were nationalized so they were talking about these\nstores; where the people worked for the Russians but it was their own from\nbefore. They had to take in a partner, an Ukrainian partner -- was only the\nbeginning. Then the Ukrainian took it right over.",
        "Q: Over how many weeks did these decrees pass?",
        "A: It was maybe the second week the Germans were already here. Right after the\nsecond week or so or the end of the first week, something like that. It was very\nfast, very fast. You could not own a bicycle. Jews cannot own a bicycle. Then\nagain you could not be found in a gentile\u2019s house. You cannot marry a gentile.\nAll kinds of laws; every day a few different things like that. It was very\nrestricted.",
        "Q: Do you remember your family turning in anything in particular?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, sure. It was later, we had to turn in fur. That was November,\nDecember, they announce on posters that every Jewish family has to turn in all\ntheir fur. They have to bring it into the Jewish community so they can collect it\nfor the German army. They were fighting already in Russia, they got stuck for the\nwinter. They needed that and of course, in those days you could see a lot of\nsmoke going through the chimneys. We were burning fur but everybody had to\nturn something in because they knew every family has fur. We buried some in the\nyard.",
        "Q: Some furs?",
        "A: My father buried some fur, yes. Because he didn\u2019t want to give it away --\nprobably still there today. Whatever we turned in, my mother had a nice fur coat,\nI think it\u2019s in that book, in the picture but she had given it away already a little bit\nbefore that to one of the Ukrainians that worked with my father before. He took\nme in for like two or three nights to stay over his house because I had to report to\ngo to a camp for labor already. My mother wouldn\u2019t let me go and my father took\nme there. They kept me like two, three days and she promised them a fur coat so\nmy father brought her fur coat there. That was before we knew that we had to\ngive away fur coats.",
        "Q: Was there a marked change in the Ukrainians themselves? Before when the\nRussians were occupying the area, the Jews and the Ukrainians were getting\nalong?",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: But at another part, the police, the collaborators --?",
        "A: At that time, even the Poles which were also not favorites by the Germans, the\nUkrainians were. The Poles were not favored. Not only the Ukrainians didn\u2019t\nwant to look at us, or anything to do with us, but even the Poles didn\u2019t want\nanything to do with us. They wouldn\u2019t help us, just the opposite. They were glad\nthat you\u2019re getting paid back what the Russians did to us. I had friends from\nschool, that we were very friendly used to go to each other\u2019s house, saw him on\nthe street, he looked the other way.",
        "Q: Did you get your armband from the Jewish community center?",
        "A: No, no. Everybody made their own. Some tailors made extra money on it for a\ndollar or two, whatever. They used to make it, to buy, most people made their\nown. It had to be uniform. It had to be a certain standard, white and blue that was\nthe color.",
        "Q: At what point was there a ghetto established?",
        "A: The ghetto was established April 1, 1942.",
        "Q: Was there anything else significant that happened between that time?",
        "A: Oh, yes, a lot of things happened. You know again it\u2019s with our registration.\nWhen we registered for the food rations, the Jewish community building had a list\nof everybody. There were some people they didn\u2019t register. The only people they\ndid not register were the ones, we found out later, they couldn\u2019t make it to Russia.\nThey came back and they were members of Communist Youth or somewhere.\nOne guy was a policeman for the Russians so they didn\u2019t want to be exposed at\nall. They were in hiding like and they didn\u2019t register. Because they didn\u2019t want\nanybody to know that they are here because otherwise the German, the first thing\nthey would call to them. They were part of the Russian establishment. So with\nthose names and addresses and the lists of the professions, what happened in\nOctober, I think one day it was in October, we woke up in the morning and we\nfound out that during the night, the Germans came and took away 150 people. I\nthink it was in August, I\u2019m not sure. In the book I have it exactly, it might have\nbeen August. I think it was in August; they came one night and they took out 150\nfrom different addresses, 150 people, doctors, lawyers, accountants. They\ntold the families they taking them to work and the next day the peasants told us\nthey took them to a forest outside the city and they were shot. This took away the\nleadership, the intelligentsia; it was the people that they could be a potential\nleadership or something, that knocked out 99%. They left a few single doctors,\nsurgeons, they left a few. Like lawyers, 1t was only the vice-mayor that he was\nthe chief of the -- they called it Judenrat at that time. I don\u2019t think there was any\nother lawyers left that I recall. With one shot they knocked out the cream of the\npopulation. They organized in October, they organized a certain amount of\npeople to go from the city to a labor camp, somewhere 80 kilometers away or\nwhatever. We didn\u2019t know at that time where. Of course, they came and brought\n-- no, they got our name too. We had a notice that I had to report next day to the\nJudenrat to go to that camp. Again, you know, was in the house between my\nmother and father. My mother didn\u2019t want me to let me go; my father said well\nPll have to go. In the meantime they are preparing a knapsack for me with food\nand clothing whatever. They didn\u2019t know for how long; I think they said for three\nmonths. Then you\u2019ll come back and other people will take your place. The\ndecision was finally that no, I should not go. That\u2019s when I went to that\nUkrainian\u2019s house where I stayed two or three nights. It was my mother\u2019s idea.\nMy father was -- he didn\u2019t, he couldn\u2019t decide one way or the other. It was just a\nplain labor camp, they didn\u2019t shoot people there but a lot of youngsters died there;\na lot of men died because it was very hard labor, very hard. The work they were\ndoing had nothing to do with labor. They were moving tremendous sizes blocks\nor stones or whatever from one place to another, up a mountain, down a\nmountain. It was in the winter, people came back frozen. They were lucky they\ncame back frozen because they were bought from the families. They went and\npaid up some money to the Judenrat and they were able to send a certain amount\nback. Then the Judenrat sent other people there, mobilized other people. They\ndidn\u2019t want to go, they came to the house, it was Jewish police already, and they\ntook them. There was no question, there was no place where to run. These\npeople they came back, one of my friends came back and he had one of his toes\nfrozen up completely, more than one.",
        "Q: Did your father ever get called for labor?",
        "A: No, my father -- they called a certain amount of age groups. Like from 18 to 30\nor something like that -- my father at that time was already fifty --, was born in\n1890, so he was already 52 years old, 51. They wouldn\u2019t call him; they first\ncalled the people that could do labor.",
        "Q: So the ghetto was formed -- so up to that point you managed to avoid having to go\nto any camps?",
        "A: Up to that point, yes. That camp was eventually liquidated, burned with people in\nit.",
        "Q: What was the name of that camp, do you know?",
        "A: Yes, there were two. One was in Kamunka and the other was Boogerkey. It was\nin the same state like but it was a good couple hours traveling by horse and buggy\nif not more.",
        "Q: So a typical day for you was --?",
        "A: My day?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t go no place. I had to report to the Judenrat once a week for labor there.\nThey took me wherever they assigned me to go, to a factory or something. Very\nfew times that I reported but I had no choice because otherwise they would take\nme. From there they would take me to the camp but once they were taken October\nto camp already, I didn\u2019t report after that, I just stayed home.",
        "Q: I see. What was --?",
        "A: They also took women. They took my sister a few times to work. There was\nquite a -- this city was like a county seat. All the main offices from the German\nauthorities were in that city, not in the other cities, was in that state like in that\npart of the county. They had police, they had Gestapo, they had zonderdees, they\nhad all kinds of different civilian authorities. All these people needed labor for\nnothing. They were taking some to clean homes, offices for the Germans; they\nwere taking women, young girls or women. To do heavier labor, they would take\nmen. If some factory was short of some kind of labor, they\u2019d tell the Judenrat, I\nneed 50 people today, I need 30 people today and they would have to supply.\nQ Was there any violence at that time against Jews?",
        "A: Well, there was, but again it was on a very small scale. The Germans used to\ncome at night even though there was no ghetto yet but they used to come in the\nJewish section. They would come to a certain house and take away the silverware\nand other things. They would just come and take it. Some would walk in dogs\nand they would see a Jew with a beard, they would let the dog go and sic him or\nthey\u2019d catch one, they\u2019d cut his beard off in the street. They wanted to beat\nsomebody, there were cases where some people were beaten up. That\u2019s why I\ntried not to be on the street at all, not to show myself. Being we lived outside, we\ndidn\u2019t live in the middle of the town, I could do it. People that live in the town\nhad no choice because the police were there, the others were there and that\u2019s\nwhere they were walking, day and night. They also had the -- 1t was something\nlike nobody could have a radio. They went into one house and they spotted a\nradio. So they took the whole family. First the man that had the radio went away,\nthey found a radio, he went out, he went away. They said if they don\u2019t find him,\nthe Jewish community would not find that man, they would kill the people from\nthe house, this family. I don\u2019t recall already what happened, did they shot the\nwhole family or did they got the man back because word came to him about how\nthey\u2019re going to kill the family. Also later, with the fur, they caught some fur in\nsomebody\u2019s house and they killed the family, the whole family. But on a scale\nlike, a big scale, no, not yet.",
        "Q: The ghetto was formed in April?\nA The ghetto was formed in April, yes.",
        "Q: How did that come about?",
        "A: Well they hung out posters a few weeks before that, I think it was the first week\nof March or something, that by April 1\u2018 all the Jews from surrounding streets\nwhich are not on the map and they included the map where the ghetto would be,\nhave to be out. If they wouldn\u2019t be out, they would be shot. Everything was\nunder the threat of being shot. The same thing to the gentiles. If they lived in the\nparts where there\u2019s going to be the ghetto on those streets and if they\u2019re found\nthere after the 1\u2018, they would be shot. The majority of movement was from the\noutskirts in, not from the ghetto out because very few gentiles lived in the middle\nof the town; the majority was Jewish. But some of them did leave there to go out,\nfind a place or whatever.",
        "Q: So you had to leave your home, I guess?",
        "A: We had to leave our home, yes. We left our home and my father had an\nacquaintance that lived in the part that was going to be the ghetto. He let us have\none room. He says we could use the kitchen together with his wife or whatever,\nsomething like that. Of course we had so much belongings and furniture that we\ncouldn\u2019t put it there. We had to put it in his basement, everything went in the\nbasement.",
        "Q: You were able to take most of your things?",
        "A: Yeah, you could take anything you wanted if you had where to put it.",
        "Q: You, your mother, father and sister shared a room?",
        "A: We shared a room, one room. It was like about three or four families in that\nbuilding or something like that. Was a one-story building and a family in the\nbasement living too.",
        "Q: Was this ghetto barricaded in any way?",
        "A: No, actually they had two ghettos. Our ghetto was on the small part, it was a very\nsmall section of the ghetto. It was maybe, maybe a fourth of the size of the main\nghetto. What I say main ghetto is, there were separated by one of the main streets\nof the city. That side was separated and there was a main street running through\nthe town from one end to the other, to the railroad station. The majority was on\nthe right side of that thing and we were on the left side. Of course, we could not\ngo from one to the other except during the day, certain hours. We were not\nallowed to be from six o\u2019clock on or five, I think from six o\u2019clock on, we were\nnot allowed to be on the street at all. It was a curfew like for the Jewish people,\nyou could not be on the street. If they caught you on the street you could be shot.\nIn order to cross from one ghetto to the other, also you expose yourself because\nthere was the main street. There could be German traffic, it could be Ukrainian\npolice traffic and very seldom did I venture from here to there except on a\nSunday. On a Sunday, the Germans did their thing home and it was like a -- there\nwas no business going on like that. I ventured on a Sunday to the main ghetto and\nI had a lot of friends there and on the streets and so on.",
        "Q: You would still report to the Judenrat office to get rations?",
        "A: No, no. Well rations were given till the ghetto. Like in the beginning there were\nrations going on. When the ghetto was established there was no rations for Jews,\nthey did away with rations.",
        "Q: So food became relatively scarce?",
        "A: Oh, food became a very difficult thing for some people, yes. People had to trade\nwhatever they had, their belongings; would go to the edge of the ghetto and trade\nwith the gentiles and all that. They would come to the fence and barter this for\nthat but most of the people still had something. But then after April 1*', they\nstarted to bring into the ghetto, people from surrounding communities, from little\nvillages, not little villages where the Jews were killed already, from little towns.\nThey didn\u2019t want little ghettos in each town. Their plan was to concentrate in\nbiggest cities so they can get to them better. They brought in more people and\nthat made it worse. Not only just with food, there\u2019s no place where to stay.\nPeople slept in hallways; it was a pity for those people that they came from\noutside. We were in already there with people, more or less established. But it\ndidn\u2019t last that long. It lasted till August and they liquidated, they made actions,\nthey started actions.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the actions?",
        "A: Well, again it\u2019s -- if I have to tell you details, it would take a long time and you\u2019re\nprobably going to pick something what you want from the book. I have it detailed\nexactly and it\u2019s a fast reading book, no matter what and it\u2019s also not so pleasant. I\nalso have an account that I copied from the Memorial Book from one girl that she\nlives in Brooklyn. She was actually caught on the train the same day when my\nsister and father, we were all taken out together from the house. But it\u2019s a long\nstory and I don\u2019t know if you want to -- specially if you\u2019re going to have there\nexactly.",
        "Q: Right, right. You eventually were deported, the ghetto was liquidated?",
        "A: No, no, I wasn\u2019t deported. From our territories they did not take any to\nconcentration camps. If they would have taken maybe some people would have\nremained, people that could have lasted or were strong enough to survive. But\nthey did not take to any concentration camps. They killed them right there on the\nspot and they had special woods, on the airfield where the airfield was built, they\nmade mass graves there, you know.",
        "Q: How did you manage to avoid the --?",
        "A: Again, it\u2019s a detailed story.",
        "Q: I see. Ill get that from the book.",
        "A: Mostly it\u2019s my mother had a big part in it too. Probably if not for her, I don\u2019t think\nI would be able to manage. She got into a few different situations where she\nknew some people and we bought our way out or something like that. Otherwise\nI\u2019d probably be there, you know.",
        "Q: Had you heard about the Anslagrupen?",
        "A: Of course, of course we heard about it. They were doing it; there were rumors\njust before our actions. There were rumors that they were doing it in the Russian\nterritory. Right over the border was Russia where they\u2019re going with those trucks\nand they put the exhaust systems and they take the people. By the time they come\nto where they tell them they take them, they\u2019re half dead.",
        "Q: What about liberation for you?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s -- I was liberated by the Russian soldiers but actually taken out of a\ngrave. Not just me, about eight people, we dug a grave.",
        "Q: It\u2019s incredible. You dug a grave?",
        "A: No, we dug a place to hide. We had a place to hide before for a couple weeks and\nthen we had to come out toward the end when the Germans were retreating. We\nknew it\u2019s a matter of days, we were in the open all the time. I was in the open\nmost of the time, on a farm. We tried to find a place to hide between when the\nfronts are going to go through. We were discovered in one place; we didn\u2019t want\nto be there. We dug a place where we thought nobody would be looking; then\nwent in there. The next day after we went in there, the Russians came through\nand we did not know for two weeks. We did not know. The city was liberated\nalready for ten days or something like that.",
        "Q: You were still --?",
        "A: We were still there. We had prepared food and water. Then we had to go for\nwater more. It\u2019s a --.",
        "Q: Very compelling.",
        "A: Finally we came out of the hole and the soldiers were crying. Was a Jewish\nofficer and a few Russian soldiers; they were crying. Somebody came with them\nthat knew that we are there but they didn\u2019t know exactly where. He came and he\nwas a few hours there trying to find us in which spot. It was dangerous for them\nto be there because again, the place where I was on that farm in the village, 1t was\nthe center of the Ukrainian nationalists. They were fighting the Russians and the\nGermans because the independent Ukraine lasted only three months. After that,\nthe Germans annulled it. They were already against the Germans and special for\nthe Russians, they were against the Russians. It\u2019s a story, the liberation itself. It\u2019s\na separate chapter.",
        "Q: How long did you remain in your town after ?",
        "A: Not too long. First of all whoever we knew, the gentile people didn\u2019t -- they were\nnot so happy we even came, to see anybody survive. We had like I say about ten\nthousand Jewish people in this city before and there was about 50 or 60 survived\nfrom the German occupation. Some survived that they went to Russia; they\nmanaged to get there. Some survived, maybe 150 or so. But the few that\nsurvived, we didn\u2019t want to be there because everything was against us. I\nmanaged to get a job back in the same concern; the Russians came back, the\nconcern opened up and I met somebody that worked from before, just one person.\nShe was happy to see me, it was a Russian woman, very happy to see me. But\nthen again it was a problem with the army and I didn\u2019t want to leave my mother\nalone.",
        "Q: Your mother survived?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Your father?",
        "A: My father and my sister went in the first action. They had four. We went through\ntwo actions, in August and October. December 1*' we were already out of the\ncity. We went to a small village, a farm.",
        "Q: You were in labor there?",
        "A: Well, it was wintertime, there was no work. But in the spring, they kept us to\nwork on that farm. From that farm I went to another farm. Right after I left the\nfarm, people were killed on that farm.",
        "Q: This is where you were carrying your sacks with pictures?",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: I remember from some of the photographs in the book where in Italy --?",
        "A: I'll show you some. As I say, very few pictures that I was able to save but they\nwere in my pocket. Some of the pictures, this is my father, this is my sister. See\nthis picture was in my wallet. This picture I got -- this was also in the wallet.\nThis is from Italy. Let\u2019s see, these I made copies of them. This is my father.\nThis is a picture of my -- I played in a band, a school band.",
        "Q: What instrument is this?",
        "A: It\u2019s like a mandolin type or a lyca type. This is Italy.",
        "Q: So your plan was to go to Palestine?",
        "A: Yes, of course, of course. We had no names or addresses, nothing. We had\nfamily here but I had nothing.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t know where they were?",
        "A: Didn\u2019t know where they were, didn\u2019t know their names, nothing. Again yes.\nThis is -- my mother from her young years yet, okay, it\u2019s from Russia yet that\npicture. Here we had a protest in Bari. Did you ever hear of Bari?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: I was there maybe a year or more. That time we protested against Bevin. He was\na foreign minister from England and he\u2019s the one that was catching the people that\ntried to get into Palestine, put them in Cyprus in camps.",
        "Q: Right, we were hearing about that, yes.",
        "A: So we were protesting, I think he was in Italy at that time. This is in Italy, a\npicture. This friend here he was one in that labor camp that I was telling you\nabout, he\u2019s in Israel. This is my mother\u2019s picture. That\u2019s the fur coat what she\nhad that I was telling you.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the one she traded away\u201d?",
        "A: She didn\u2019t trade it, she just gave it away because they took me for two, three\nnights there. These are people that came to visit us from Russia in 1940, they\ncame to visit. They went to a resort place and my mother and my sister went\nthere. That\u2019s my mother and that\u2019s my sister and they met the family there.\nThat\u2019s my father\u2019s sister, they were from Kiev, they came to visit us. Let\u2019s see.\nThat\u2019s my mother and father. I think that\u2019s the first picture they took in the city\nwhen I was born.",
        "Q: Your mother\u2019s very pretty.",
        "A: This is my business school picture.",
        "Q: You were bookkeeping then? Is that what you considered yourself?",
        "A: Yeah, we were studying there for accountancy and I graduated, I had my diploma.\nI had a picture of all the graduates, that went too with the sack. That\u2019s a cousin\nfrom Kiev and this is my sister. I don\u2019t know how it wound up that this was in a\ndifferent place. As I said I had two sacks actually. This wound up in the other\nsack. They\u2019re not even my family; they\u2019re somebody\u2019s family that we knew and\nthe family is here. There is a sister to that woman and we made copies, we gave\nthem. Here\u2019s my father and my sister; the picture\u2019s taken, I don\u2019t know, 1933 or\n4. I think I sent this picture also. I gave one of these pictures, made copies, they\nshould have it here.",
        "Q: Ben Liss?",
        "A: He should have it there. If you want to take an extra one, I have it, you can have\nan extra one. This is my sister, that\u2019s a friend at the Jewish gymnasium. The\nRussians came in 1939, they set the Jewish gymnasium. I made copies for that\nreason to --. That\u2019s why you have these, you saw that . I should have that\ntoo and I think I sent this here. I sent a copy of that and that\u2019s a copy of my sister.",
        "Q: Your mother and father?",
        "A: My sister. I think I sent from my mother and me later too. I sent pictures, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Pll check with Ben Liss. If I can\u2019t get them from you, will I be able to borrow\nphotos for copies?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Now here again this is in the resort area; my sister and my cousin\nfrom Kiev. This is in Romania.\n(TAPE ENDS AT THIS POINT.)\n"

        "MORGENSTERN, Abraham\nRG-50*233.0092\nOne audio cassette\nABSTRACT\nAbraham Morgenstern was born to Russian Jewish parents who had moved to Lublin,\nPoland around 1921. He was reared in a contemporary religious family, and attended\nPolish public school and a Jewish school. He graduated from business school at 16 just\nbefore war broke out in 1939. That year, the Russians took over his town, which\nprotected them for a short time.\nAfter the Germans invaded Poland, they shot about 99 percent, some 150 of Lublin\u2019s\nbest- educated, professional Jews.\nAbe asserts that no Jews in Lublin tried to escape. Lublin\u2019s two ghettos were established\non April 1, 1942, and the Morgensterns were moved into one of them that month. Food\nbecame very scarce.\nAbe\u2019 father and sister perished during the first of four actions. Abe says that no Jews\nfrom his area were taken to concentration camps; they were shot in the woods and put\ninto mass graves.\nAbe does not provide many details about how he and his mother survived, except to say\nthat she bribed some people. He refers the interviewer to an unnamed book he wrote.\nAbe mentions labor camps, one in Kamionka. One was burned down, killing the camp\ninmates. Abe reported a few times to the Judenrat, which took him to work temporarily at\na factory and then at a camp. But eventually, he says, \u201cI just stayed home.\u201d\nToward the end of the war, Abe and eight others dug a hole where they hid until Russian\ntroops found them; about two weeks after the Russians had liberated the area.\nAfter the war, he and his mother immigrated to Italy. They had planned to go to Palestine\nwhere they had relatives, but did not go because they did not know the relatives\u2019 names\nor addresses.\nAbe says that of Lublin\u2019s estimated 10,000 Jews, only about 200 survived -- 50 or 60 in\nthe city, and about 150 who had escaped to Russia.\nA: The minute they came to that city going to Poland already in 1921, I think that\u2019s\nwhere they smuggled the border from Russia to Poland and my father met quite a\nfew people that he knew from before that already came ahead of him to that city,\nand he found some cousins and whatever. He also, I guess, was offered a\nposition, a good position. He managed a flourmill, and my mother got pregnant\nand so there was an excuse not to go. Then when I came already, my father didn\u2019t\nfeel like leaving. He was a little established already and he felt good there. He had\na lot of people that he knew and it was a nice town, a religious town and that\u2019s\nhow we stuck there.",
        "A: 99% of the Jewish people were orthodox. There was no other section that didn\u2019t,\nonly orthodox. Some were modern, some were old-time religious but my father\nhad no beard and he was --. In that mill, as I say, later when I was growing up, he\nwas traveling to villages and little towns buying grains from the peasants. Then\nhe was giving them to the casino and that\u2019s how he made his living at that time. I\nwent to public school and in the afternoon I went to cheder which was a Jewish\nschool. Then later on when I was like 11, 12, 13, I went to Hebrew School in the\nafternoon for two, three years. We learned other subjects too beside Hebrew.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I said I went to the public school till I was 13 and finished. Up there\nyou go seven years public school. I finished public school in 1936. There were\ntwo higher schools after that. One was the gymnasium they called it which was\nrun by the state, and the other one was business school. It was also -- it wasn\u2019t run\nby the state, it was private but they were on the same level. You had to wear\nuniforms and you had to get exams before being admitted. I went three years\nthere and I graduated in 1939. There, besides all the other subjects, you learned --\nthey also taught me German. I took German language. You could take French or\nGerman. I choose German so I\u2019m familiar with the German language too.",
        "A: Polish.",
        "A: Yes. I didn\u2019t learn Yiddish till almost the wartime. I knew it from the people\nspeaking all around but I never spoke it and all my friends, we always spoke\nPolish with all my friends. In the cheder, what we went when I was small yet, I\ncould speak to the teacher in Yiddish that time but we never spoke --. As a matter\nof fact my parents in the beginning, even later, they spoke Russian between\nthemselves too because they were from Russia. But my mother wanted me to\nknow the Polish language so she spoke Polish to me and my sister.",
        "A: Yes, one sister, two years younger, yes. As I said, you asked me about religious;\nmy father traveled most of the week, he was in other towns but he make sure he\ncomes back Friday afternoon to make Shabbos home and he went to the shul\nSaturday. He took me most of the time to shul, I remember, and holidays no\nquestion about it. On a Saturday most of the business people were Jews in the\ncity. Very few gentiles had businesses, some had but the majority was Jewish.\nCome Saturday, the stores were closed up. It may be singles, Jewish stores, they\nwere open like candy stores, or a drugstore or something like that. The rest was\nshut up completely. Some were open Sundays; they allowed some stores to be\nopened Sundays, holidays and Saturdays everybody closed. Even the people that\nonly went to the synagogue on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, they still\nobserved the holidays.",
        "A: We lived in quite a few places. Me and my family didn\u2019t own a house so we had -\n- we\u2019re renters. I guess we rented wherever was convenient, wherever the job\nwas. Then when I guess they wanted more money or whatever, the family wanted\na bigger place, we had to move. I remember moving like three or four times,\ndifferent places. From one end of the city to the middle city, to the outskirts,\nwhatever.",
        "A: No. Women didn\u2019t work before. My mother always stayed home.",
        "A: He used to take me sometimes on a trip. My father used to own one of these\nhorse and carriages like you see in Central Park or something like that for\npleasure. He used to keep it at somebody\u2019s stable but when he went out of town\nhe used to go with -- he used to rent a drive of it with a horse and carriage that\nyou could bring the grain back on that. It was like a commercial type horse and\nbuggy, not a pleasure. As far as taking me, he\u2019d take me -- most of the time he\nwould take me -- he went to a place where we had some kind of relations, distant,\nwhatever, my father knew. He would leave me there for the day, with his\nbusiness and I would be there with other youngsters for me. Distant, distant\nrelatives or acquaintances whatever. As far as working, I did not work but upon\nthe graduation of the business school in 1939, my father took me to that flourmill\nwhere he used to manage before Even though he was out already, maybe ten\nyears out of that place, no not ten years, maybe seven or so, he took me to the\noffice there. He knew the people, the accountants in the office and the managers\nand they interviewed me and they gave me a test and they hired me as of the first\nof September. I had a position in the bookkeeper\u2019s office there. I was very\nhappy, I didn\u2019t have to -- in other words I got it through my father. I didn\u2019t get it\non my own because I was green at that time, 16 years.",
        "A: Yes, yes. It was a big mill, a very large mill, exported flour all over the world.\nThere were two mills in the city, both Jewish, different ends of the town. The\nmills are there today, they\u2019re there today, the mills are there.",
        "A: Yeah, of course, sure. They employed a lot of people.",
        "A: He was self-employed. When he left -- the reason he left the mill there, it was\nsold. The people that they sold the mill, the owners came from Lvov, you\u2019re\nfamiliar with this city, probably you\u2019 ve read about it, it was a big city in the\nUkraine. So the new owners came and I don\u2019t know whether they let him go or it\nwas -- I don\u2019t know the details, I never asked. But since then he didn\u2019t work there\nbut he was very friendly with the people, even with the new owners. The people,\nthey sold the mill, opened up a new one at the other end of the town, somehow.\nThey built a new one or they built and then they sold it, whatever it was, I don\u2019t\nknow. He knew the people there and that\u2019s how he got me the job. Of course, I\nnever got the chance to put in one day\u2019s work because the first of September I had\nto report, that\u2019s when it happened.",
        "A: In our town, what it happened they -- the day before they proclaimed a general\nmobilization. It was very touch-and-go for the last few weeks there before that\ndate. It was the German propaganda and Hitler\u2019s speeches, you know, was\nbroadcast all over. They demanded Danzig, it\u2019s a port city there. They gave in to\nthis and he demanded something else after that. They knew that they cannot get\nout of it, he\u2019s going to attack sooner or later. The minute that they declared the\nmobilization, it was a Friday night or something, the next day or so they declared\nwar. Germany declared, they attacked first and then they declared.",
        "A: The people had to report to their points. Whoever was 21 years old had to report,\nmobilize. There was a general mobilization and all doctors, dentists were\nmobilized and put into uniform right away and sent to different parts of Poland.\nThey did it quick but our city was not -- was at the other end -- was at the eastern\nend of Poland. So it was not attacked, was not attacked by the Germans, they\nconcentrated a little bit the other way, the western part, that\u2019s where they attacked\nfrom, the western part. It dragged on like this for about two weeks. People\nstarted to evacuate from Warsaw and Lodz (?) and different cities. We used to\nsee a lot of cars coming through with people in it. On top of the\nRomanian border. We were very close to the Romanian and Russian border, was\nlike 30 kilometers or something to the Romanian border, or 35, just nothing.\nThey all had cars, most of them with cars, people, not only Polish people, Jewish\npeople too, they had means and they didn\u2019t want to be caught. They figured\nthey\u2019ll go to Romania and Romania was independent and from there they would -\n-. Actually, they did and people that went to Romania, they wound up in\nEngland. All the Polish escapees wound up in England.",
        "A: To Palestine, you couldn\u2019t go because the British wouldn\u2019t let them go.",
        "A: They wouldn\u2019t let go but the English government would let the Polish people\ncome into England. They went -- it\u2019s a long way around but that\u2019s how they\nmanaged.",
        "A: No, at that time, why? Where would we go? First of all, we had no means of\ntransportation, where you going to go. It was a city of nine to ten thousand Jews\nand nobody tried to escape, actually nobody. Some Polish people did, officers\nevacuated some families and police, almost to the last day, the police, the firemen,\nthey stayed will the last day. Almost the last day, they evacuated. What\nhappened between those two weeks, it took about two weeks till the 17\" of\nSeptember; it was a Sunday morning and Germany was successful in occupying\nalready quite a bit of -- most of -- about two-thirds of Poland. I think the only\nplace that still was not occupied was Warsaw. They lasted almost a month.\nSomebody, I guess rumors started to fly or somebody knew already, they said\nwithin a few hours the Russian army is going to be here. It didn\u2019t take long, an\nhour or two and we heard shelling or something. They were going, the Russian\narmy was advancing and just shooting so that the people don\u2019t attack them. They\ndidn\u2019t know who the Polish army is still there or the police, they had no idea.\nThey were just like shelling like over the cities to announce that they are here.\nWhoever didn\u2019t escape yet from the government tried to get out. But there was no\nfighting, there was no damage. It was very festive when they actually showed up.\nTheir tanks and the artillery, the cavalry; actually the whole town went out to\ngreet them in the streets, special there was a lot of -- not only Jewish people but\nsome Poles too that they were socialists or communists or whatever. There was\nno communist Party, it was illegal but there were people that believe in socialism\nand they were the first ones to greet the soldiers and run the city right from the\nbeginning.",
        "A: No, no. My father never mixed in politics. That\u2019s how it started. Once the\nRussians went by -- they went by and the next day they send in people to run the\ncity. The mayor became one of the -- our own people sitting in jail in the other\npart of Poland, in the north somewhere belonging to the communist party. They\ncame back, they let out the prisons from there. They came back to the city, one of\nthem became a mayor. He rode a horse and became a mayor. They figured he\nwas a man that was way back, a card member, he sat in jail. So they gave him the\nhonor of being a mayor but not for long, a week or two, then they appointed their\nown; they brought in their own people to manage the city. A little bit later, they\nbrought their families and they took over the buildings where the Polish officers\nused to live with their families which was evacuated already and they settled\nthere. Later on they even took over Jewish apartments and they settled the\nRussians and things like that. They nationalized the buildings and everything.",
        "A: Well the effect was positive. First of all, my parents come from Russia and with\nthe Russian army, they could communicate and then they started to organize\ndifferent businesses, everything under the government control. They were\nlooking for anybody with managerial experience and my father was pulled in right\naway in a good position.",
        "A: Experience and he went into a grain concern that the Ukrainians had established.\nA grain concern and they knew about him and they took him in to manage a\ncertain thing. Then he took me into the office and that\u2019s how I got a job. I worked\nthere almost two years in the bookkeeping department.",
        "A: Yes, very positive because they treated the Jews very nicely. You know the\nRussian authorities at that time, most of the occupiers. The officers, the big and\neven the private people that were brought in, a big majority were Jewish people\nfrom Russia. It was a very positive thing for the Jewish people. It was very\npositive for the Ukrainian but it was not so positive for the Poles. Poles were\nlooked a little bit down because the Russians said that they came to liberate us\nfrom the Polish yoke or whatever. So the Poles had a difficulty of getting a good\nposition. Also then a couple of months later, they established everybody from 16\nyears and a half had to get a passport, the Russian passports with pictures. We\nhad to go to register. People went to register according to their professions,\nwhatever they did. If anybody owned a business before, they marked on the\npassport that this man is a businessman or if he had a son over 16, the son would\nbe marked son of a businessman. With that passport you couldn\u2019t land a good\nposition already because you were considered a capitalist. That\u2019s how they\nmarked the passports. Also you had to put your nationality, Jew, Pole or\nUkrainian They had in their passports what it was, even till today. All my friends\nthat their parents were in business and they had problems getting jobs. Being that\nmy father was not marked as a businessman on his passport, he was, through him\nI was able to get in a few of my friends to that concern too.",
        "A: Oh yes, sure, of course. They had lectures, public lecture forums that you go. At\nthat time already it was a few months after they established already their rule. As\na matter of fact, they have it in the book. One of the lectures that I remember, we\nworked in the grain concern. Most of the grains were being shipped to Germany.\nAt that time already, Germany took two-thirds of Poland and they took one-third.\nThey divided between themselves. But at that time already there was a little\nfriction between both of them somehow. There were not such good relations and\nyet they were shipping all the grains out to them. I remember asking that question\nto one of the officers that was giving the lecture. They had special propaganda\nmen that worked in uniform and they were lecturers, special lectures. I asked\nhim, how could we ship to them the grains that being they\u2019re already trying to tell\nus that they\u2019re not friends, they\u2019re like enemies. They\u2019re trying to build up their\nthing against us or whatever. He says, no we have to buy time and the amounts\nthat we give them are negligible but from our concern most of them went there.\nHe says we have to buy time to be prepared. They were preparing the building\nairfield outside the city.",
        "A: Yeah. The Russians were. I was roped in to go to that airfield on my vacation to\nwork there.",
        "A: It was a stable feeling, it was stable. They opened up a Jewish gymnasium what it\nwasn\u2019t before. Before it was like a public; they opened up a separate Jewish\ngymnasium with Jewish language, Hebrew, Jewish and most of the Jewish kids\nthat want to go to a gymnasium would go into that gymnasium. The Poles already\nhad no gymnasium no more. The Ukrainians did have their Ukrainian\ngymnasium, the Poles had no gymnasium. That\u2019s how they were treated.",
        "A: Yes, they were really mad at the Poles. Didn\u2019t let us forget; they thought that\nbecause the Jews were more favored than them, they thought that they had to pay\nus back later. It\u2019s one of the reasons they claimed that we were patsies with the\nRussians and most we are communists.",
        "A: Well, it happened already very close to the June \u201941 when Russia was attacked. I\nhad my vacation in May.",
        "A: I thought, right. I had a vacation in 1940, I had one vacation for two weeks. But\nin 1941, I was scheduled to go to a --. They had special places where they sent\npeople that worked nice in the offices, they worked good and they deserved a\nlittle break, they would send them paid vacations to a place where it\u2019s like a resort\narea. I was scheduled to go on my two weeks to that resort area. Here like a\nweek before it, a week before my vacation, I was called into the office of the\ndirector and he said, he says, I know that you must realize that how we are trying\nup an army and we have to get prepared because the Germans keep saying they\u2019re\ngoing to attack us and they built up a very big might against us. Everybody has to\nsacrifice and being I\u2019m a good citizen or whatever, each office has to concentrate\nto the building of the airfield. Being that they cannot spare nobody from the\noffice because it\u2019s a busy concern when my vacation comes up, that I should\nvolunteer to g to that airfield. He says you\u2019re going to get paid for your vacation,\nyou\u2019re going to get paid for there. But this was like six or seven kilometers out of\nthe city with no transportation but I had no choice. You couldn\u2019t say no.",
        "A: Right, no choice but to volunteer. Otherwise I\u2019d be fired or whatever and I went\nthere to the airfield place. They interviewed me and they said okay, whatever that\nday was. Next Monday you\u2019re starting, have to be there six o\u2019clock in the\nmorning. It was, I don\u2019t remember how I got there the first day, I really don\u2019t\nremember. My father had somebody drive me most of the time. I know I walked\none time. I walked. They took me up there and they had mobilized all the\npeasants from the vicinity, all around from that area, mobilized under duress.\nOtherwise they didn\u2019t get even paid. Whoever had a horse and buggy was\nmobilized and they had to transport all kinds of materials from the warehouses\nand back to that place where they\u2019re building the airport. They had engineers,\nthey had a lot of Russians and they were walking on the ground and it was just a\nbig, big field, a tremendous field. From scratch they had to stop and build that\nairport. I was there two weeks and I think the second or the third day, I got\nacquainted with a Russian fellow that he was in the Russian army but he was in\ncivilian clothes. He was something, a demolition expert or whatever and he was\nworking underground something. He had a truck, he was driving a truck, they run\nthe little trucks or something We got acquainted and he says; I said I would like -\n-. I walked home, that\u2019s what it was, the first day I walked home. Quite a bit to\nwalk, an hour and a half or whatever I don\u2019t remember, an hour or more. He said\n-- | invited him. If you want to come to the house, you can have supper with us,\nfigured he\u2019ll give me a ride which he did. I says you come to the house and you\ncan even stay there overnight. In the morning you'll come back.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Unannounced he brought me home. I introduced him and he was a nice\nfellow. He had supper with us and he slept one night and in the morning, he went\nback with the truck. That\u2019s how we were going every day. So it turned out to be\nnot bad for me; you know I had transportation. Otherwise, I probably wouldn\u2019t be\ncoming home every day, I\u2019d probably sleep there somewhere. The two weeks\nwent by, two weeks went up. I went back and somebody else\u2019s vacation came up\nand they sent him.",
        "A: No, no. It was office work. What I actually did, the peasants were hauling sand.\nFrom wherever they were bringing the sand here somehow and I had to give them\nreceipts for how much sand they had to bring a full load of sand and I gave them\nthe receipts for the loads. I had to go check if they didn\u2019t lose on the way half or\nwhatever. I gave them receipts. They were lined up for stretches and stretches of\nthose things from morning until the night. They were working around the clock;\nthey had two shifts from six to six. My shift was from six in the morning until six\nat night.",
        "A: They had done this and with those receipts they were promised they would get\npaid eventually. They never did.\nQ> __Isee. Because it was too late?",
        "A: Even so, they never had intentions of honoring them.",
        "A: I went back to the --. Then June 21, Germany attacked. They attacked the --.",
        "A: No way, no way. As a matter of fact I went to the beach that Sunday. The beach\nwas empty and I couldn\u2019t understand why there was almost nobody there. Very\nfew -- I usually meet my friends there; we play cards, whatever.",
        "A: No, it was on a river, river. We had beaches by the river. It\u2019s a nice story; I go\ninto detail actually.",
        "A: The first clue was that I usually meet my friends like I got up in the morning. We\nhad no radio in the house. Very few people had radios; telephones, only doctors\nand professionals would have a telephone. Got up at eight o\u2019clock, it was a nice\nsunny day and I went to the beach, a 15 or 20 minutes walk and I went to the\nbeach. Close to nine o\u2019clock usually my friends would show up already and\nnobody\u2019s there. Here and there, there\u2019s somebody there, you know. Go for a\nswim by yourself, how much can you be in the water by yourself. I go out just\nwaiting for people to show up so we usually play cards. Then somebody around\nten o\u2019clock, somebody shows up. He says what are you people doing here? Don\u2019t\nyou know there\u2019s a war? That\u2019s how I found out. Actually they bombed already\ncities at four o\u2019clock in the morning. Four o\u2019clock in the morning, Kiev was\nbombed, Lvov, other cities, Vilna, quite a few cities were bombed. Our city was\nbombed too but a little bit later, they bombed our city. That\u2019s how I found out.",
        "A: Well, in 1941 people one year older than me were mobilized in 1941. Their year\nwas called. Whoever was born in 1922, was 19 years old, they were mobilized\nlike in March and April already, they went to be inducted. At that time when the\nwar broke out, they didn\u2019t mobilize any more except whoever was still around\nwho was not sent away to the points where they train you, they would send them\nright away. Again it was two weeks till the Germans came and they started to\nevacuate. The first week was normal. They attacked but they were holding their\nground for the first four or five days or something. But then they broke through\nthe lines and it was disaster. The first week we were still going into the office and\nthen some of the Russian directors were evacuating their families already,\nmobilizing some cars or trucks if they had. In our concern too, the director was\ntaking trucks and horse and buggies, putting furniture and stuff and sending\nfamily back to Russia. We were just standing there. The Jewish people started\nthinking about the evacuation because whoever was in the police, or whoever was\ncommunist or something, they didn\u2019t want to take chances. I think the second\nweek already, it was like they were running. Soldiers were coming back\nfrom the fronts in trucks full with soldiers. People tried to get rides with them;\nsome did, some couldn\u2019t succeed. Again my family wouldn\u2019t think of running;\nnot only mine, the majority didn\u2019t think of anything. Even though we knew that\nthe Germans, they\u2019re against the Jews but nobody thought of something\nhappening whatever happened.",
        "A: Of course we heard. We heard stories from the other parts of Poland what they\nwere two years already there. That they mobilized some people to camps, labor\ncamps. They worked them for nothing; some guys, sometimes they cut\nsomebody\u2019s beard off and things like that. There was no concentration camps,\nthere was no -- at that time there was no extermination, nobody even thought\nabout it in 1941. After they attacked Russia, they started there too, they started to\ndo.",
        "A: Oh yes. We had German refugees; they were coming in 1938 yet. Germany\nthrew out Jewish people that their ancestry was from Poland. They brought them\nup to a Polish border station and left them there. Then different communities\ntried to absorb some of them even though it was in the west part of Poland, some\nwound up by us. Most of them had some family or some relations, they came\nhere but some didn\u2019t. Some were trying to actually work their way to get into\nRussia. They figure they go to the eastern part of Poland, maybe they\u2019ll be able to\nget across the border to Russia. We had quite a few refugees here. Again, that\nwas the worst thing that happened to them. They threw them out of Germany.",
        "A: Civilian Russians, civilians too evacuating. It was the second week all civilians,\nRussians with their families were evacuating --?",
        "A: The city was bombed right at the end of the evacuation when the German planes\nand the Russian planes were still fighting each other.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t stick my nose out. We were sitting in the basements because they\nwere shelling. Before the Germans came there were a few nights, there was\ntremendous shelling. There were -- opposite sides -- shells were flying all\nthrough the night. The whole house shook every time. Nobody put their head\nout. As a matter of fact, wherever we lived at the time, there was a lot of gentile\npeople lived there in that section. In that cellar, there was mostly gentile people\nthere. But nobody would stick their head out. I had a chance to go there --= [Il\njust make it short. The fellow that I acquainted at the airfield, the second week of\nthe evacuation, a tank pulls up in front of our house. Everybody got scared in the\nneighborhood, a tank, what\u2019s a tank doing here? A Russian tank pulled up. A\nguy comes out and goes up to our house. That\u2019s the fellow, he came with a tank.\nHe came to take me with us. He says we are evacuating, the Germans are going\nto be here any day and come with me, I'll take you back to Russia. You might be\nin trouble here, you know, the Jewish people won\u2019t have it so good. There was a\ndiscussion between my father and my mother, should they go, should they not go.\nI was like, I had nothing to say probably but I didn\u2019t want to go. I know I didn\u2019t\nwant to go. I wasn\u2019t ready yet to be on my own. They decided not to let me go,\nmy mother especially, they don\u2019t want to let me go. He left and also at the same\ntime, maybe a day different, quite a few youngsters a little bit older than me,\nmaybe a year or two older from the neighborhood, walked out from their homes.\nSaid goodbyes and they all wear these knapsacks on them and they said whoever\nwants to join them, they\u2019re going. They\u2019re going to try to reach Russia. They\nwent out, on the outskirts and that\u2019s all we saw of them. But about two or three\ndays later, they came back. They came back, they couldn\u2019t get rides with nobody\nand they couldn\u2019t go by foot. They all came back. Then this fellow came with\nthe tank, he didn\u2019t go to Russia either.",
        "A: No, I met him later, that\u2019s a story besides. They didn\u2019t -- they told him to stay\nback and he posed as a Ukrainian. Just met him by chance on the street. I was in\na march for labor, something during the German occupation, and I met him on the\nstreet. He wouldn\u2019t look at me, we just looked at each other and then he put his\nhead down. He didn\u2019t want to -- I was marching in a group so of course, I\ncouldn\u2019t say nothing. Then when we were marched back, he was waiting there in\na corner and he came over to me. He said something, you know I\u2019m here and\nnobody knows, nobody is supposed to know who I am. He says I was on my way,\nthey send me back.",
        "A: I think it was like July 7 or 6. I have the date in the book exactly. From the 21\u201c\nof June till July 6 or 7.",
        "A: Well, first of all, again, it was a Sunday, the Germans came in. We were not in\nthe street; we were in the basement all night. In the morning we went back to the\nrooms and then one of the neighbors came in. She says the Germans are in town\nalready and you better don\u2019t dare to go out on the street. They\u2019re catching Jews\nor whatever. Of course we didn\u2019t. A little bit later, there was a knock on the\ndoor, the same day, and it was in the afternoon, early in the afternoon. Two\nUkrainian policemen were there; there were no Ukrainian police before, all of a\nsudden, there\u2019s Ukrainian police, uniforms and rifles. We didn\u2019t know at the time\nbut that day also they proclaimed independent Ukraine with the capitol in Lvov.\nThe Germans let them have an independent Ukraine. They had prepared already,\nevidently they were prepared for that. They had uniforms already. So they came\nand they came into the house and they took my father out.",
        "A: Yes, they need him for work. My mother was pleading and crying and pleading.\nWe didn\u2019t live in the city, we lived outside. It wasn\u2019t a Jewish section at all.\nThey had plenty, there were sections where there were a lot of Jews and why they\ncame here, they had to cross a bridge --. The minute they knocked on the door,\nme and my sister, we were hiding under the bed or somewheres in the bedroom\nand they took my father. My mother was crying and of course we thought he\u2019 Il\nnever come back. He didn\u2019t show up till late in the evening, he came back which\nit was like a miracle too. He says they did take him to work something by the\nriver, whatever he had to do. Him and whoever else they caught. He says they\ndidn\u2019t beat him and when they finished whatever they were doing; they let him\ngo. It was the first experience. Second experience with the Germans, the next\nday already.. We didn\u2019t go any more in the basement because there was no more\nshelling already so we stayed in the room. We still didn\u2019t dare to go in the street.\nNow I don\u2019t remember if it was the second day or the third day, a lot of German\ncars, motorcycles pulled up in our street. They stopped on the street and some of\nthem came into the -- we had like a yard in the front and they put in their\nmotorcycles in the yard. They were knocking on the doors; evidently they were\nshown where Jews lived. They were not youngsters, they were officers, elderly\nguys and they were from the army. Evidently they were asking where Jews are\nliving not because -- we didn\u2019t know, the minute we saw these things we tried to\nrun down the basement over there by that time. But my mother stayed out and\nwhat they were looking for, they were looking for Jewish people in order to\ncommunicate. Because they couldn\u2019t communicate with the other people and\nmost of the Jews knew German somehow because the Yiddish and German is\nvery similar. They stopped for a rest and they had all kinds of provisions with\nthem and they want us to cook. They want the women to cook for them the stuff\nand they should have their break and eat and then they go further. That\u2019s what\nhappened.",
        "A: My mother and then there was another family there, you know. So that\u2019s what\nthey came for.",
        "A: No, no. They just ate. She cooked the meal; they gave some to us. I think they\ngave my mother some stuff what they had and then they went on their way.\nEND OF SIDE A (ONLY ONE TAPE)",
        "A: It was the first time we saw the German soldiers. Otherwise, we didn\u2019t stick our\nhead out.",
        "A: No. Well, then the holidays came in and we -- of course we couldn\u2019t go anywhere\nto pray. We started from the neighborhood. We gathered some people and we\nmade like a little gathering in our house.",
        "A: This was already Yom Kippur. Rosh Hashanah we didn\u2019t pray because it was that\ntime when it happened that they --. We prayed there, people prayed there. All of\na sudden somebody came in the neighborhood and said that Ukrainian police is\ncoming. They see Ukrainian police coming up the street. Everybody ran, you\nknow, they took off the prayer shawl and went to their homes. Some from a little\nfurther away, they had to stay, disperse a little bit. That\u2019s what they were\ncoming, to check if Jewish people praying.",
        "A: There were a lot of decrees but this was right -- was only a day or two away or\nthree from where they -- we didn\u2019t even go out nothing. Then there were decrees,\na lot of decrees. I think within the first week they started decrees. First the Jews\nhad to register. They imposed the Jewish community leadership. Otherwise they\ncame to the -- there was a Jewish vice-mayor. The vice-mayor was Jewish, he\nwas a lawyer. They came to him and they said you better organize a Jewish\ncommunity.",
        "A: No, no, the Germans, already the Germans came. There was a building from the\nJewish community and they found out who was the vice-mayor. They came to\nthe leader\u2019s house and they says we want in 24 hours we want a Jewish\ncommunity leadership so we can communicate and give directions, whatever.\nThey had a problem to organize it because people didn\u2019t want to serve on it\nvoluntarily. They don\u2019t want to be involved with the Germans at all. Because\nyou expose yourself once you did. This vice-mayor tried to get some of his\nfriends and acquaintances and little by little they organized a community\nleadership. Then the Germans had proclaimed announcements all over the town\nthat --.",
        "A: Posters, yes, that we had no announcing on the radio. There was no such thing.\nThey had special places with their posters and that\u2019s how you announced\neverything. Every street had different places where they announced what\u2019s going\non and that the Jewish people have to register at the community center in order to\nreceive food stamps, rations, food rations; otherwise you have to be registered.\nThere was no kind of register, you would not receive rations. They didn\u2019t say you\nwould be punished or something just have to register. The same thing, the gentile\npopulation had an announcement. They have to register in their places wherever\nso most of the people went to register. When you registered, I didn\u2019t go, my\nfather went and he registered. They asked him his profession from before and\naddress and everything and he registered. Then I think a week or two later you\nhad to go and pick up the rations. It was very small rations that they gave you.\nWhatever they gave, the Jews got half of it. Then every day different posters. If\nanyone has a radio, he has to turn it in. Anybody has a telephone, he has to turn it\nin. You cannot walk on the sidewalk, any Jew cannot walk on the sidewalk.\nEvery Jew must have an armband with the Star of David, a white armband with a\nblue Star of David. It has to be so many centimeters, ten or whatever and it has to\nbe worn on the left arm. Again, different -- no Jew can have a business. If he has\na business, he has to take in a gentile partner but at that time already the Russians\ntook the businesses away and there wasn\u2019t that many. They still had businesses,\nthere were some their stores were nationalized so they were talking about these\nstores; where the people worked for the Russians but it was their own from\nbefore. They had to take in a partner, an Ukrainian partner -- was only the\nbeginning. Then the Ukrainian took it right over.",
        "A: It was maybe the second week the Germans were already here. Right after the\nsecond week or so or the end of the first week, something like that. It was very\nfast, very fast. You could not own a bicycle. Jews cannot own a bicycle. Then\nagain you could not be found in a gentile\u2019s house. You cannot marry a gentile.\nAll kinds of laws; every day a few different things like that. It was very\nrestricted.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, sure. It was later, we had to turn in fur. That was November,\nDecember, they announce on posters that every Jewish family has to turn in all\ntheir fur. They have to bring it into the Jewish community so they can collect it\nfor the German army. They were fighting already in Russia, they got stuck for the\nwinter. They needed that and of course, in those days you could see a lot of\nsmoke going through the chimneys. We were burning fur but everybody had to\nturn something in because they knew every family has fur. We buried some in the\nyard.",
        "A: My father buried some fur, yes. Because he didn\u2019t want to give it away --\nprobably still there today. Whatever we turned in, my mother had a nice fur coat,\nI think it\u2019s in that book, in the picture but she had given it away already a little bit\nbefore that to one of the Ukrainians that worked with my father before. He took\nme in for like two or three nights to stay over his house because I had to report to\ngo to a camp for labor already. My mother wouldn\u2019t let me go and my father took\nme there. They kept me like two, three days and she promised them a fur coat so\nmy father brought her fur coat there. That was before we knew that we had to\ngive away fur coats.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: At that time, even the Poles which were also not favorites by the Germans, the\nUkrainians were. The Poles were not favored. Not only the Ukrainians didn\u2019t\nwant to look at us, or anything to do with us, but even the Poles didn\u2019t want\nanything to do with us. They wouldn\u2019t help us, just the opposite. They were glad\nthat you\u2019re getting paid back what the Russians did to us. I had friends from\nschool, that we were very friendly used to go to each other\u2019s house, saw him on\nthe street, he looked the other way.",
        "A: No, no. Everybody made their own. Some tailors made extra money on it for a\ndollar or two, whatever. They used to make it, to buy, most people made their\nown. It had to be uniform. It had to be a certain standard, white and blue that was\nthe color.",
        "A: The ghetto was established April 1, 1942.",
        "A: Oh, yes, a lot of things happened. You know again it\u2019s with our registration.\nWhen we registered for the food rations, the Jewish community building had a list\nof everybody. There were some people they didn\u2019t register. The only people they\ndid not register were the ones, we found out later, they couldn\u2019t make it to Russia.\nThey came back and they were members of Communist Youth or somewhere.\nOne guy was a policeman for the Russians so they didn\u2019t want to be exposed at\nall. They were in hiding like and they didn\u2019t register. Because they didn\u2019t want\nanybody to know that they are here because otherwise the German, the first thing\nthey would call to them. They were part of the Russian establishment. So with\nthose names and addresses and the lists of the professions, what happened in\nOctober, I think one day it was in October, we woke up in the morning and we\nfound out that during the night, the Germans came and took away 150 people. I\nthink it was in August, I\u2019m not sure. In the book I have it exactly, it might have\nbeen August. I think it was in August; they came one night and they took out 150\nfrom different addresses, 150 people, doctors, lawyers, accountants. They\ntold the families they taking them to work and the next day the peasants told us\nthey took them to a forest outside the city and they were shot. This took away the\nleadership, the intelligentsia; it was the people that they could be a potential\nleadership or something, that knocked out 99%. They left a few single doctors,\nsurgeons, they left a few. Like lawyers, 1t was only the vice-mayor that he was\nthe chief of the -- they called it Judenrat at that time. I don\u2019t think there was any\nother lawyers left that I recall. With one shot they knocked out the cream of the\npopulation. They organized in October, they organized a certain amount of\npeople to go from the city to a labor camp, somewhere 80 kilometers away or\nwhatever. We didn\u2019t know at that time where. Of course, they came and brought\n-- no, they got our name too. We had a notice that I had to report next day to the\nJudenrat to go to that camp. Again, you know, was in the house between my\nmother and father. My mother didn\u2019t want me to let me go; my father said well\nPll have to go. In the meantime they are preparing a knapsack for me with food\nand clothing whatever. They didn\u2019t know for how long; I think they said for three\nmonths. Then you\u2019ll come back and other people will take your place. The\ndecision was finally that no, I should not go. That\u2019s when I went to that\nUkrainian\u2019s house where I stayed two or three nights. It was my mother\u2019s idea.\nMy father was -- he didn\u2019t, he couldn\u2019t decide one way or the other. It was just a\nplain labor camp, they didn\u2019t shoot people there but a lot of youngsters died there;\na lot of men died because it was very hard labor, very hard. The work they were\ndoing had nothing to do with labor. They were moving tremendous sizes blocks\nor stones or whatever from one place to another, up a mountain, down a\nmountain. It was in the winter, people came back frozen. They were lucky they\ncame back frozen because they were bought from the families. They went and\npaid up some money to the Judenrat and they were able to send a certain amount\nback. Then the Judenrat sent other people there, mobilized other people. They\ndidn\u2019t want to go, they came to the house, it was Jewish police already, and they\ntook them. There was no question, there was no place where to run. These\npeople they came back, one of my friends came back and he had one of his toes\nfrozen up completely, more than one.",
        "A: No, my father -- they called a certain amount of age groups. Like from 18 to 30\nor something like that -- my father at that time was already fifty --, was born in\n1890, so he was already 52 years old, 51. They wouldn\u2019t call him; they first\ncalled the people that could do labor.",
        "A: Up to that point, yes. That camp was eventually liquidated, burned with people in\nit.",
        "A: Yes, there were two. One was in Kamunka and the other was Boogerkey. It was\nin the same state like but it was a good couple hours traveling by horse and buggy\nif not more.",
        "A: My day?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t go no place. I had to report to the Judenrat once a week for labor there.\nThey took me wherever they assigned me to go, to a factory or something. Very\nfew times that I reported but I had no choice because otherwise they would take\nme. From there they would take me to the camp but once they were taken October\nto camp already, I didn\u2019t report after that, I just stayed home.",
        "A: They also took women. They took my sister a few times to work. There was\nquite a -- this city was like a county seat. All the main offices from the German\nauthorities were in that city, not in the other cities, was in that state like in that\npart of the county. They had police, they had Gestapo, they had zonderdees, they\nhad all kinds of different civilian authorities. All these people needed labor for\nnothing. They were taking some to clean homes, offices for the Germans; they\nwere taking women, young girls or women. To do heavier labor, they would take\nmen. If some factory was short of some kind of labor, they\u2019d tell the Judenrat, I\nneed 50 people today, I need 30 people today and they would have to supply.\nQ Was there any violence at that time against Jews?",
        "A: Well, there was, but again it was on a very small scale. The Germans used to\ncome at night even though there was no ghetto yet but they used to come in the\nJewish section. They would come to a certain house and take away the silverware\nand other things. They would just come and take it. Some would walk in dogs\nand they would see a Jew with a beard, they would let the dog go and sic him or\nthey\u2019d catch one, they\u2019d cut his beard off in the street. They wanted to beat\nsomebody, there were cases where some people were beaten up. That\u2019s why I\ntried not to be on the street at all, not to show myself. Being we lived outside, we\ndidn\u2019t live in the middle of the town, I could do it. People that live in the town\nhad no choice because the police were there, the others were there and that\u2019s\nwhere they were walking, day and night. They also had the -- 1t was something\nlike nobody could have a radio. They went into one house and they spotted a\nradio. So they took the whole family. First the man that had the radio went away,\nthey found a radio, he went out, he went away. They said if they don\u2019t find him,\nthe Jewish community would not find that man, they would kill the people from\nthe house, this family. I don\u2019t recall already what happened, did they shot the\nwhole family or did they got the man back because word came to him about how\nthey\u2019re going to kill the family. Also later, with the fur, they caught some fur in\nsomebody\u2019s house and they killed the family, the whole family. But on a scale\nlike, a big scale, no, not yet.\nA The ghetto was formed in April, yes.",
        "A: Well they hung out posters a few weeks before that, I think it was the first week\nof March or something, that by April 1\u2018 all the Jews from surrounding streets\nwhich are not on the map and they included the map where the ghetto would be,\nhave to be out. If they wouldn\u2019t be out, they would be shot. Everything was\nunder the threat of being shot. The same thing to the gentiles. If they lived in the\nparts where there\u2019s going to be the ghetto on those streets and if they\u2019re found\nthere after the 1\u2018, they would be shot. The majority of movement was from the\noutskirts in, not from the ghetto out because very few gentiles lived in the middle\nof the town; the majority was Jewish. But some of them did leave there to go out,\nfind a place or whatever.",
        "A: We had to leave our home, yes. We left our home and my father had an\nacquaintance that lived in the part that was going to be the ghetto. He let us have\none room. He says we could use the kitchen together with his wife or whatever,\nsomething like that. Of course we had so much belongings and furniture that we\ncouldn\u2019t put it there. We had to put it in his basement, everything went in the\nbasement.",
        "A: Yeah, you could take anything you wanted if you had where to put it.",
        "A: We shared a room, one room. It was like about three or four families in that\nbuilding or something like that. Was a one-story building and a family in the\nbasement living too.",
        "A: No, actually they had two ghettos. Our ghetto was on the small part, it was a very\nsmall section of the ghetto. It was maybe, maybe a fourth of the size of the main\nghetto. What I say main ghetto is, there were separated by one of the main streets\nof the city. That side was separated and there was a main street running through\nthe town from one end to the other, to the railroad station. The majority was on\nthe right side of that thing and we were on the left side. Of course, we could not\ngo from one to the other except during the day, certain hours. We were not\nallowed to be from six o\u2019clock on or five, I think from six o\u2019clock on, we were\nnot allowed to be on the street at all. It was a curfew like for the Jewish people,\nyou could not be on the street. If they caught you on the street you could be shot.\nIn order to cross from one ghetto to the other, also you expose yourself because\nthere was the main street. There could be German traffic, it could be Ukrainian\npolice traffic and very seldom did I venture from here to there except on a\nSunday. On a Sunday, the Germans did their thing home and it was like a -- there\nwas no business going on like that. I ventured on a Sunday to the main ghetto and\nI had a lot of friends there and on the streets and so on.",
        "A: No, no. Well rations were given till the ghetto. Like in the beginning there were\nrations going on. When the ghetto was established there was no rations for Jews,\nthey did away with rations.",
        "A: Oh, food became a very difficult thing for some people, yes. People had to trade\nwhatever they had, their belongings; would go to the edge of the ghetto and trade\nwith the gentiles and all that. They would come to the fence and barter this for\nthat but most of the people still had something. But then after April 1*', they\nstarted to bring into the ghetto, people from surrounding communities, from little\nvillages, not little villages where the Jews were killed already, from little towns.\nThey didn\u2019t want little ghettos in each town. Their plan was to concentrate in\nbiggest cities so they can get to them better. They brought in more people and\nthat made it worse. Not only just with food, there\u2019s no place where to stay.\nPeople slept in hallways; it was a pity for those people that they came from\noutside. We were in already there with people, more or less established. But it\ndidn\u2019t last that long. It lasted till August and they liquidated, they made actions,\nthey started actions.",
        "A: Well, again it\u2019s -- if I have to tell you details, it would take a long time and you\u2019re\nprobably going to pick something what you want from the book. I have it detailed\nexactly and it\u2019s a fast reading book, no matter what and it\u2019s also not so pleasant. I\nalso have an account that I copied from the Memorial Book from one girl that she\nlives in Brooklyn. She was actually caught on the train the same day when my\nsister and father, we were all taken out together from the house. But it\u2019s a long\nstory and I don\u2019t know if you want to -- specially if you\u2019re going to have there\nexactly.",
        "A: No, no, I wasn\u2019t deported. From our territories they did not take any to\nconcentration camps. If they would have taken maybe some people would have\nremained, people that could have lasted or were strong enough to survive. But\nthey did not take to any concentration camps. They killed them right there on the\nspot and they had special woods, on the airfield where the airfield was built, they\nmade mass graves there, you know.",
        "A: Again, it\u2019s a detailed story.",
        "A: Mostly it\u2019s my mother had a big part in it too. Probably if not for her, I don\u2019t think\nI would be able to manage. She got into a few different situations where she\nknew some people and we bought our way out or something like that. Otherwise\nI\u2019d probably be there, you know.",
        "A: Of course, of course we heard about it. They were doing it; there were rumors\njust before our actions. There were rumors that they were doing it in the Russian\nterritory. Right over the border was Russia where they\u2019re going with those trucks\nand they put the exhaust systems and they take the people. By the time they come\nto where they tell them they take them, they\u2019re half dead.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s -- I was liberated by the Russian soldiers but actually taken out of a\ngrave. Not just me, about eight people, we dug a grave.",
        "A: No, we dug a place to hide. We had a place to hide before for a couple weeks and\nthen we had to come out toward the end when the Germans were retreating. We\nknew it\u2019s a matter of days, we were in the open all the time. I was in the open\nmost of the time, on a farm. We tried to find a place to hide between when the\nfronts are going to go through. We were discovered in one place; we didn\u2019t want\nto be there. We dug a place where we thought nobody would be looking; then\nwent in there. The next day after we went in there, the Russians came through\nand we did not know for two weeks. We did not know. The city was liberated\nalready for ten days or something like that.",
        "A: We were still there. We had prepared food and water. Then we had to go for\nwater more. It\u2019s a --.",
        "A: Finally we came out of the hole and the soldiers were crying. Was a Jewish\nofficer and a few Russian soldiers; they were crying. Somebody came with them\nthat knew that we are there but they didn\u2019t know exactly where. He came and he\nwas a few hours there trying to find us in which spot. It was dangerous for them\nto be there because again, the place where I was on that farm in the village, 1t was\nthe center of the Ukrainian nationalists. They were fighting the Russians and the\nGermans because the independent Ukraine lasted only three months. After that,\nthe Germans annulled it. They were already against the Germans and special for\nthe Russians, they were against the Russians. It\u2019s a story, the liberation itself. It\u2019s\na separate chapter.",
        "A: Not too long. First of all whoever we knew, the gentile people didn\u2019t -- they were\nnot so happy we even came, to see anybody survive. We had like I say about ten\nthousand Jewish people in this city before and there was about 50 or 60 survived\nfrom the German occupation. Some survived that they went to Russia; they\nmanaged to get there. Some survived, maybe 150 or so. But the few that\nsurvived, we didn\u2019t want to be there because everything was against us. I\nmanaged to get a job back in the same concern; the Russians came back, the\nconcern opened up and I met somebody that worked from before, just one person.\nShe was happy to see me, it was a Russian woman, very happy to see me. But\nthen again it was a problem with the army and I didn\u2019t want to leave my mother\nalone.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: My father and my sister went in the first action. They had four. We went through\ntwo actions, in August and October. December 1*' we were already out of the\ncity. We went to a small village, a farm.",
        "A: Well, it was wintertime, there was no work. But in the spring, they kept us to\nwork on that farm. From that farm I went to another farm. Right after I left the\nfarm, people were killed on that farm.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: I'll show you some. As I say, very few pictures that I was able to save but they\nwere in my pocket. Some of the pictures, this is my father, this is my sister. See\nthis picture was in my wallet. This picture I got -- this was also in the wallet.\nThis is from Italy. Let\u2019s see, these I made copies of them. This is my father.\nThis is a picture of my -- I played in a band, a school band.",
        "A: It\u2019s like a mandolin type or a lyca type. This is Italy.",
        "A: Yes, of course, of course. We had no names or addresses, nothing. We had\nfamily here but I had nothing.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t know where they were, didn\u2019t know their names, nothing. Again yes.\nThis is -- my mother from her young years yet, okay, it\u2019s from Russia yet that\npicture. Here we had a protest in Bari. Did you ever hear of Bari?",
        "A: I was there maybe a year or more. That time we protested against Bevin. He was\na foreign minister from England and he\u2019s the one that was catching the people that\ntried to get into Palestine, put them in Cyprus in camps.",
        "A: So we were protesting, I think he was in Italy at that time. This is in Italy, a\npicture. This friend here he was one in that labor camp that I was telling you\nabout, he\u2019s in Israel. This is my mother\u2019s picture. That\u2019s the fur coat what she\nhad that I was telling you.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t trade it, she just gave it away because they took me for two, three\nnights there. These are people that came to visit us from Russia in 1940, they\ncame to visit. They went to a resort place and my mother and my sister went\nthere. That\u2019s my mother and that\u2019s my sister and they met the family there.\nThat\u2019s my father\u2019s sister, they were from Kiev, they came to visit us. Let\u2019s see.\nThat\u2019s my mother and father. I think that\u2019s the first picture they took in the city\nwhen I was born.",
        "A: This is my business school picture.",
        "A: Yeah, we were studying there for accountancy and I graduated, I had my diploma.\nI had a picture of all the graduates, that went too with the sack. That\u2019s a cousin\nfrom Kiev and this is my sister. I don\u2019t know how it wound up that this was in a\ndifferent place. As I said I had two sacks actually. This wound up in the other\nsack. They\u2019re not even my family; they\u2019re somebody\u2019s family that we knew and\nthe family is here. There is a sister to that woman and we made copies, we gave\nthem. Here\u2019s my father and my sister; the picture\u2019s taken, I don\u2019t know, 1933 or\n4. I think I sent this picture also. I gave one of these pictures, made copies, they\nshould have it here.",
        "A: He should have it there. If you want to take an extra one, I have it, you can have\nan extra one. This is my sister, that\u2019s a friend at the Jewish gymnasium. The\nRussians came in 1939, they set the Jewish gymnasium. I made copies for that\nreason to --. That\u2019s why you have these, you saw that . I should have that\ntoo and I think I sent this here. I sent a copy of that and that\u2019s a copy of my sister.",
        "A: My sister. I think I sent from my mother and me later too. I sent pictures, you\nknow.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Now here again this is in the resort area; my sister and my cousin\nfrom Kiev. This is in Romania.\n(TAPE ENDS AT THIS POINT.)\n"
