        "Q: ... Just test your voice too, so we can get the levels right. So, are you planning on watching the\ngame on Saturday, the World Cup game?",
        "A: Yes, I think I\u2019m going to take a look, because I want to know how they do compared to the other\npeople.",
        "Q: Are you rooting for the U.S., or China?",
        "A: Well, I think I would like to see China win. I like the acupuncture idea.",
        "Q: Ah, yes, yes. Okay, this is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. Paul\nPressman. It\u2019s July the eighth, 1999 and we are sitting in Dr. Pressman\u2019s home and office in\nLexington, Kentucky, and this is Arwen Donahue conducting the interview. This is tape number\none, side A. Let\u2019s begin then with, would you tell me something about your, well first of all,\nlet\u2019s begin with where you were born and your date of birth.",
        "A: I was born in Paris, France, May 29, 1932. I did my school in France, my medical school, also.\nAnd I stay until the first World War and when the German came. And by the time probably I\nwas around nine years old, and the Germans start to come in the school, but first it was the\nFrench police who came, just asking every teacher, \u201cDo you have any Jewish boy in the school?\u201d\nAnd she said or he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d So they ask, \u201cWho is Jewish, raise your hand.\u201d And I\ndidn\u2019t raise my hand and when I did go back home, I said to my mother and father, well, this is\nwhat happened. And they sent me in a safe place in South of France.",
        "Q: How did you know not to raise your hand? What made you not do that?",
        "A: I think it was personal instinct. I thought, you know, you can ask, \u201cAre you French? Would you\nlike to stay and live in France?\u201d But the question \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d was a little bit surprising\nfor me. Why should people ask what kind of religion, mostly we knew it was the police. So, I\ndidn\u2019t feel comfortable, so I said, I\u2019m going to wait a little bit and speak to my parent and ask\nthem what they think.",
        "Q: Had you been aware at all at that time, that there was any danger to Jews posed by the Germans?",
        "A: Oh yes, I, in Paris, they start to prepare a big place, to put a lot of people, belonging to a certain\nreligion, so I knew something was going on, but , you know, at my age, when I was nine or ten\nyears old, it is not, it\u2019s not like a game, but it\u2019s not very serious. But I knew they\u2019d been taking\nJew in other country.\n1",
        "Q: What was your name at birth?",
        "A: The same name I got now, Paul Pressman, PRESSMAN.",
        "Q: Do you know anything about the name Pressman? Is that where your family came from?",
        "A: Mine parent are both born in, at the time 1t was Romania. It was Romania, became Russian, then\nbecame Romania. And all of my family, I don\u2019t know any of them, but come from Romania.\nThe name of the town is Kishinev, Bessarabia.",
        "Q: When did they come to France, to Paris?",
        "A: They got married in Romania and they came, I remember my father saying, at the time they\narrive in France, my mother was sixteen or seventeen. And they try first to come in United State,\nbut they didn\u2019t let them in United State, because my mother did have glaucoma. And they didn\u2019t\nknow what was glaucoma at the time. They thought it was a very dangerous sickness, so she did\ngo back to England, stay in England a little while and establish in Paris, France. And this is\nwhere I was born.",
        "Q: What was your, what were your parents\u2019 names?",
        "A: My mother is Pauline Kogan, K O J AN! and my father was Joseph Pressman.",
        "Q: And did you have brothers or sisters?",
        "A: I did have three brother. I\u2019m the youngest one. The other brother, both of them did work with\nmy father in a drapery factory he did open. The other one, at the time didn\u2019t work, he was\nyoung. And I was the smallest, the little one.",
        "Q: What were your, what was your oldest brother and your middle brother\u2019s names?",
        "A: The oldest brother, who survived the Holocaust, name is Bernard and the other one, who died in\nAuschwitz was Maurice. The other one, the third one is Gaston, and I am Paul.",
        "Q: And Gaston survived as well?",
        "A: Yes, because he was sent with me in a safe town, south of France, because at the time France\nwas cut in two parts, north and south. And the south was with the Italian and it was much easier\nthere. It didn\u2019t stay long, but by the time the Italian were there, it was much easier than in north,\nwhere the Germans were much more rough with us.",
        "Q: Did your mother work?\n' The \u201cJ\u201d is probably a misstated \u201cG\u201d.\n2",
        "A: Before the war, yes, she was working with my father. She was working a sewing machine in\nHavre (ph), in the business of my father. And until the end, she was working with him.",
        "Q: And she stopped when the war began?",
        "A: Well, she stopped when the French police, under the order of the German came to pick up my\ntwo brother. And my two brother did follow the police with no resistance, because they, you\nknow, the police said it is just to make a verification of your paper. And they didn\u2019t ask anything\nabout my father, but he right away closed the whole thing. And we had been waiting about the\nanswer, but my two brother never came back.",
        "Q: Can you just tell me something about your childhood, your home? What stands out in your\nmemory from that time?",
        "A: Well, we used to have a nice apartment in Paris, close to the business of my father. And also\nabout fifteen miles from Paris, we did have a little villa, where we used to go on Saturday and\nSunday and stay there. Life was very simple, happy, didn\u2019t have any major problem. They used\nto work during the week. I used to go to school. Saturday... Friday night, we load the car, we\ndid go and stay outside of Paris. And everything was fine and dandy. So, life was normal, until\nthe whole German story start and then everything change overnight.",
        "Q: Were your parents religious at all? Your family?",
        "A: My mother was very religious, but my father was not religious at all. So, he ask me one day, I\nremember, he said, \u201cDo you want to do your Bar Mitzvah?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\nOkay, no Bar Mitzvah. And it was the end of the story. My brothers never did a Bar Mitzvah.\nHe was really not very interested in, not only in the Jewish religion, but on any religion. This 1s,\nI think, the way Iam now. [Laughing]",
        "Q: Was it hard for your mother that you, that you and your brothers weren\u2019t being raised more\nreligious?",
        "A: I think so. I think it was hard for her and this is why she asked us, the day she\u2019s going to die, she\nwants to be buried with the Jewish religion, which we did. At the time, I did have an office in\nsouth of France, close to Nice. And when she died, we made... the rabbi did the whole thing.\nWe didn\u2019t understand anything about it, because it was the first Jewish funeral we did. But here\nshe is in south of France, in a Jewish place, where she was buried like the Jewish religion.",
        "Q: Do you remember... I assume you, were you going to a public school?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember when the Germans occupied France? Do you remember them coming in?",
        "A: In France? They came very, not in force. They came very, very slowly. The reason, I think,\nthey got the whole thing so easy is because the French people are very anti-Semitic. So, for them\n3\nto give the address or to reveal where the Jew were living, it was not a problem. And I don\u2019t\nmean to say all of them, because a lot of police... we did have a neighbor, across from our\napartment, who was from the police. And I even remember his name. His name was Mr.\nReddler (ph). And every time something did happen, he came in our door, knock on the door\nand said, \u201cBe careful. They\u2019re going to do this, they\u2019re going to do this.\u201d So, I don\u2019t mean to\nsay all the Frenchmen, but I said at least the majority of the French people were anti-Semitic.",
        "Q: Did you have any sense, up to that point, of being a Jew? Had you personally experienced any\nanti-Semitism?",
        "A: All the time, even when I was a little boy I took the subway in Paris and you can see on the wall,\nJew equal concentration camp, Jew go home, things like this. Yes, you couldn\u2019t do otherwise\nthan to realize, okay, we are not welcome in our own country. When I say our own country, I\u2019m\nborn in France, so I thought I was a Frenchman, which was a big mistake, because no. I was a\nJew. It\u2019s a little bit the same problem and I don\u2019t want to start any...",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: It\u2019s the, my feeling... I speak with a lot of black people here and I ask them why do you call\nyourself, African-American? I don\u2019t say to people, I am a French-American. I\u2019m an American,\nbecause I asked to become an American. If I would call myself French-American, it would mean\nto say, I\u2019m very happy to be French and I\u2019m also happy to be an American. And I think in life,\nyou have to make a choice, either you are an American or you\u2019re French. And if it wouldn\u2019t\nbe... I say this the other day to a black guy. He was very surprised. And coming from me, I\nthink it was not a big problem. But I said, \u201cI think you\u2019re very lucky, your grand-grandparent\nwas brought in United State. At least now you can drive a car. You can have a nice home,\ninstead of being in Africa where you\u2019d be starving. You wouldn\u2019t have any clothes to put on\nyour back and anybody can kill you. And this for me is racism. Here racism 1s not this. They\nare not racist, so I don\u2019t understand why you call yourself African-American. You are American\nfrom two, three or four generations. And it\u2019s not because your parents were slave.\u201d And when\nyou know the story about the slave, it\u2019s not the American who took the black people. It\u2019s the\nchief of the village, who give black people to the American. So...",
        "Q: What kind of response did you get?",
        "A: Most of the time they said, \u201cWell it\u2019s a way of things. You have a different way of speaking.\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cYou know, I, as a Jewish person cannot be a racist. So, if I tell you this, it\u2019s because\ncoming from another country, I\u2019m surprised the way you deal with your slave story. You feel\nsorry for yourself, but you\u2019re so lucky to be in a country where you have freedom and you can\nlive like any other person. You\u2019re Black? Sure it\u2019s, you can see a black man, but sometimes you\ncan recognize a Jewish boy and so it\u2019s nothing worse to be Black or to be Jew, but I don\u2019t want\nto fight the country for this.\u201d",
        "Q: You don\u2019t think that Jews can be racist, too?\n4",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh yeah, oh yeah, Jewish people can be very, very racist. And I saw this on many\ndifferent occasion. But it\u2019s not the same kind of racism they have. It\u2019s a... I don\u2019t know any\nJew belonging to the KKK.",
        "Q: They wouldn\u2019t probably accept them. [Laughing]",
        "A: Absolutely, so I don\u2019t think... but it\u2019s, it make a... Man is man, woman 1s woman, people are\npeople. And you can find people, different idea of people, different approach of life and so I\nthink, yes, it can be a lot of, some Jewish people can be racist. It doesn\u2019t make a... but before\nwe have to define: what do they mean by being racist?",
        "Q: What do you think that means?",
        "A: Well, racism is something, it\u2019s hate with no reason. You like some people, you like some people\nliving in this country. You like some people living in another country. You don\u2019t like people the\nway they live, this can be racism. But basically, it\u2019s not racism, it\u2019s something, because you\ndon\u2019t like their way of laughing. Black people are very exuberant and maybe some American\ndon\u2019t like this and this can be a form of racism. And like I said before, Jewish people living in\nAmerica are much more American than they are Jewish. And because of this, they can be racist.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t understand that last. Because they\u2019re Jewish people living in America, they can be racist.",
        "A: Because they feel very safe in this country. And like I told you before, Jewish people are Jewish\nby tradition, but they belong to a minority. And if you are in France or in United State or any\ncountry in the world, you still are minority. But it is so comfortable in United State, then Jewish\npeople forget the background and say, \u201cBut I\u2019m an American.\u201d And I say, \u201cNo, first you are\nJew, and if anybody is going to kill you, they\u2019re going to kill you, just because you are Jew, not\nbecause you\u2019re an American.\u201d And this is the big problem and they lose the identity of being\nJewish, just because they feel so comfortable. They feel, /t\u2019s my country. Yes it is, in one way.\nBut until, and you can see this on TV, this young man, who been speaking about racism against\nblack, Jew, all the Jew have the power in the bank. It\u2019s not true, but in his mind it is. And he\nkilled people and he killed himself. You saw this on TV two or three days ago. This is the big\nproblem.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back a little bit to, you were just telling me before about your experience as a child in\nParis and the anti-Semitism that you experienced. Did you have, were all of your friends Jewish\nat the time?",
        "A: At the time I didn\u2019t have a lot of friends, because I was, I did a big selection. I\u2019m not the kind of\nman who have a lot of friends. And yes, at the time all my friends, at the time were Jewish. The\nreason 1s, I feel more comfortable with Jewish people than with non-Jewish people. And again, I\ndon\u2019t speak about religion. I speak about tradition. Going to a Jewish restaurant once in a while,\nit\u2019s fun and it remind me memory. Watching a movie with Jewish song, it\u2019s fun. I\u2019ve been\nmarried twice with non-Jewish woman and I was missing this exchange of jokes, Jewish jokes or\nword. Even in New York, when I go to New York, people speak a lot of Jewish word and it\u2019s\nalways funny. And I always say, \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d \u201cNo, but we use a lot of Jewish word here\n5\nin New York,\u201d but they are not Jewish. But it\u2019s funny, I like it, because it\u2019s something... So\nwhen I was in France, I didn\u2019t want to have non-Jewish friend because I would never know if the\nsame guy 1s not going to give me a knife when the time comes.",
        "Q: You really felt that at a very early age?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: Did you...",
        "A: Well, my brother came back from the concentration camp. The only reason I left France to come\nin the United State, I decided to come here in 1983, is because I didn\u2019t feel comfortable in\nFrance. Because up to this date, you have this anti-Semitism in France. My brother, who is\nseventy-six or seventy-eight, doesn\u2019t feel it. He said, \u201cNo, this is in your mind.\u201d And he is\nmarried with a non-Jew woman. She 1s wonderful woman, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable. I...\nFrance is a beautiful country. I like to go on vacation, but I couldn\u2019t live there anymore, because\nof all this background. I\u2019ve never been comfortable in France.",
        "Q: Did your family speak Yiddish at home?",
        "A: Yes, all the time.",
        "Q: Do you still speak Yiddish?",
        "A: Yes, uh huh. I don\u2019t find a lot of people I can speak Yiddish with, because most of the Jewish\npeople here, don\u2019t speak Yiddish. But my grandson, which is the son of my daughter, and my\ndaughter doesn\u2019t follow the religion. But my grandson studied the Jewish story, I mean the\ndifference between Sepharad and Ashkenazi and he said, \u201cBut sometime they are racist\nbetween...\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, I know.\u201d I think if you put two men with no religion on an island,\nthere\u2019s going to be racism, because man is stupid. They want to fight. They want to fight for a\nreason. The reason is religion. And they are going to fight about God, it\u2019s my God, it\u2019s not your\nGod. God is God. Your God is my God. There is only one God. But we don\u2019t want this, this\nway.",
        "Q: Going back to Paris, you were talking a little bit earlier about the time when your two brothers\nwere called in and they were deported. Do you remember around when that was?",
        "A: It was March in 1942, when they did go to Auschwitz. Before it was a camp a little bit outside\nof Paris called Drancy, where all the Jewish people been put together for a length of time, I think\nit was between eight and ten month. Where they start to shape the whole thing: \u201cAre we going\nto send them? What kind of train are we going to use?\u201d It was another camp not far from there,\ncalled Compiegne, which was also the same kind. So... there is a man, who came here in\nLexington, a Jewish man, who gave something... I\u2019ve got something, I will remember his name.\nAnd he explained what the German did have in mind. And it\u2019s amazing the way they did\norganize the whole thing. Even it was a lot of Jewish people, put together in a train, they didn\u2019t\nknow nothing, from where they come, what they going to do, where they going to go.\n6\nEverything was real on paper. The train company didn\u2019t know what they were going to\ntransport, because it was special train for animals. So, it was so well organized, and they\nprepared all this and from each country it was the same thing. From Poland it was another way.\nFrom Yugoslavia it was another way. From Austria it was another way. It was really a\ntechnique they did have. And the top of those guys, I\u2019m afraid to say he was a brain, because he\nwas crazy. But his name was Himmler, and he organized the whole thing. And he organized\nthis very well. And you know, the Jewish people who\u2019ve been in camp, most of them were, what\nwe call here blue-collar, simple people. They didn\u2019t think we\u2019re going to kill them. Even until\nthey arrive in the camp, when they say, the SS was on, say, one side, \u201cYou go this way, you go\nthis way.\u201d No, it was nothing. The only time my brother realized he was in a bad direction 1s\nwhen one time, coming down from the train, he didn\u2019t go fast enough. The SS slapped his face.\nAnd he was nineteen years old. Then he realized something is going to happen, now it\u2019s another\nworld. But until then, well 1t was hard, they didn\u2019t have anything to eat in the train. They didn\u2019t\nhave any water. They didn\u2019t have any... but it\u2019s going to clear up, no problem. They didn\u2019t\nrealize they go to the butcher. They go to die, by thousands. And this was the life. They did go,\nbecause the only one who realize what\u2019s going on were the educated people, the attorney, the\ndoctor, the people who did study. But they were not many people. When my brother was\ndeported in Auschwitz, it was a guy with him, who was, I think he was a colonel in the French\narmy. And he said, \u201cThey are going to do nothing to me. I\u2019m a colonel from the French army.\u201d\nHe died like all the one, just because he was Jew. That\u2019s all. They didn\u2019t care he was a colonel.\nHe did have a high education. Doesn\u2019t make any difference. You are Jew, you must die. It\u2019s\namazing, eh? But...",
        "Q: Did you and your family have any contact with your brothers while they were in Drancy?",
        "A: Yes, we did have the possibility to go around the camp, Private Honor (ph) from Haus (ph) let us\nin and we could communicate by sign. So we can see they are alive, because in Drancy they\ndidn\u2019t kill anybody. They been starving. They even allowed to receive some package of food.\nBut like I said, 1t was not a long time, but communicate mouth to mouth? No, it was impossible.\nNo German in Drancy just the French military and the police. No SS, no German, the whole\ncamp was under the surveillance of the French police.",
        "Q: Were your parents surprised about that?",
        "A: It\u2019s very hard for me to remember. It\u2019s very hard, because like I said, I was eight, nine year. No,\nI have a hard time to remember the reaction of my father, the reaction of my mother. No, I don\u2019t\nhave any recollection.",
        "Q: Do remember any talk about the political situation at home?",
        "A: Well, you have to remember, my parent were not very high educated people. My mother did\nbarely write. She spoke mostly the language, but she didn\u2019t speak the... but 1t was, it was\nsomething. You have to remember my parent left Russia because of the Bolshevism. My parent\nwere three hundred percent for the idea of communism. So, they were with one track mind. So\npolitically, even if I could remember, I don\u2019t think it would be accurate, because they were too\nmuch in one way. I couldn\u2019t have any discussion. Even my brother, who is alive now, I can,\n7\nsome conversation about politic I cannot have with him, because he is still in one track. Very\nhard to discuss about politic. And again, like I said before, France is his country. It\u2019s the best\nplace, why should I go in America?\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n8\nTape 1, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number one, side B of an interview with Doctor Paul Pressman. Do you, how, did\nyour parents tell you at all, when they were making plans to escape to the South of France? Was\nthere any discussion with you about that or did it just happen?",
        "A: No, they, my parent, neither my mother, neither my father, didn\u2019t discuss with the children.\nWe\u2019d been raised with a lot of authority from my folks. And they say, \u201cThis is an emergency;\nwe have to go.\u201d So my father is going to go there. We are going to go there. And we\u2019ll see how\nit is going to be. And we\u2019ll decide day by day, because it was no other way. We have to leave\neverything. Everything we got lost. We left with too little luggage and that\u2019s it, because we\nknew we never going to see anything we left. Because it was the end. We try to save our life,\nthat\u2019s all. So another time for me and like my two other brother were in Drancy, so it was only\nanother brother and me, so it was a little bit easier. So, my father left with my other brother,\nGaston, and I stay with my mother. And at the time it was, Paris became very, very difficult. No\nplace to hide, so my mother send me through the Zone. It was a line between the North and\nSouth and you have to pass the Zone. And some French people for money, they direct you\nbetween the army. And I did go in South in Grenoble. And when I arrive in Grenoble, a friend\nof my mother took me and three days later she came down. And we stay... and I don\u2019t remember\nhow long, maybe couple months, three months. And it became very dangerous to stay there. So,\nshe send me to my father. And where my father was, was more dangerous than there, so they\ndecide... I came back to see my mother and my mother, remember I was nine years old. So, they\ndecide to send me to Switzerland with a group of Jewish people, boys. And I think I was the\noldest one from all the boys. We were about fourteen, fifteen. So, we did go in one little town,\njust to the frontier, slept there until midnight, one o\u2019clock in the morning. Then two men took\nus, make us walk and we arrive on the border. The Swiss took us and put us in a refugee camp.",
        "Q: Did you leave to go to the South of France immediately, was that before your brothers had been\ndeported for Auschwitz from Drancy?",
        "A: No after, right after, because it was very, they realized now that\u2019s it. If we don\u2019t do something,\nthey are going to take us and we\u2019re going to go to Auschwitz. So, probably my parents said, let\u2019s\nsave there two boys and we\u2019ll see.",
        "Q: Did you know anything about Auschwitz at the time?",
        "A: No. No. No, we didn\u2019t know. No, I don\u2019t think I knew something. We knew about Drancy\nbecause I did go to Drancy with my mother just to see from far away my brother. But we didn\u2019t\nknow anything about the camp where they burn cadaver, where they put them in a chamber and\nput gas. We didn\u2019t know all this. No.",
        "Q: Do you remember from that time any restrictions starting to be imposed on you as a Jew?",
        "A: Oh, the first restriction was to carry the yellow badge. We did have a yellow star, the Jewish\nstar, with inside \u201cJew\u201d and you have to carry this in anything you wear. So, you did have two\nway, either you don\u2019t carry this thing and if they catch you, they kill you right there, or if you\n9\nhave one, everybody can see you. And this was only in the north of France, in Paris. So this is\nwhy my mother decided to let us go down in south, because it was, I remember when they start\nto give us this yellow badge to carry. In the street I used to live, it was a man, who was very old,\nmaybe eighty-five, ninety and he was blind, Jewish. And he carried this yellow thing and I\nthought to myself, this is terrible, because if you can treat a human being, because of religion,\nit\u2019s really the end. And this 1s, I think where my mother decided to send me, because, you know,\nit\u2019s so easy. It\u2019s very hard to explain how does it look. How do you realize a park, like here,\nRupp Arena, downtown, with all the door closed, only one open and you push all the Jew inside.\nAnd it was, I don\u2019t know, maybe five hundred thousand, six hundred thousand. I don\u2019t know...\nall there. And from there, they start to spread group. And this was the beginning of the end. So,\nit was time to do something, leave, hide and this is where I think they organized this, my mother\nand my father.",
        "Q: Did they have any connections with any resistance organizations at that time?",
        "A: I found out my mother was a captain from the French army. Since when, I don\u2019t know. When I\nwas in Grenoble, this is where I realized what she was doing, because I never saw my mother\nwith a gun. And one day, she did have a big book, she always carry with her. And I said, why\ndo you carry this book? And she said, well, I will show you, but you forget about what you are\ngoing to see. She opened the book and it was cut and it was a gun inside. Because she used to\nbring food to Resistance who had been caught and put into the hospital. And she survived the\nwhole thing, because she die after the war, with... So, yes she belonged to a group, but...",
        "Q: Was it, when you say French army, what exactly do you mean?",
        "A: The French regular army.",
        "Q: But the French army...",
        "A: Was illegal, because the real army were at the service of the Germans. All the, I don\u2019t know how\nI\u2019m going to tell you...",
        "Q: It was under de Gaulle?",
        "A: Yes. Force Francaise de |\u2019Interieur (ph). So, it was civilian. They didn\u2019t have any uniform, but\nthey been working to liberate France under the order of Charles de Gaulle, who was in England.\nSo, they been listening to the radio at night for special message. But all this for me was, I didn\u2019t\nunderstand.",
        "Q: When did you find out that she was a captain with the army?",
        "A: I think I was, just before I left for Switzerland, which was about... when I left for Switzerland, I\nthink it was in \u201844, around 1944, what month, I don\u2019t remember. But it was in 1944. This is\nwhere she went... and I, we were a little bit surprised, because when we... when they took us to\nthe frontier at Switzerland, two military from Swiss did have the gun and say, \u201cApproach the\ndoor.\u201d And I don\u2019t know if you know it, but the Swiss soldier are dressed exactly like the\n10\nGerman soldier. Green with the same helmet. And I thought to myself, \u201cThat\u2019s it, they got us.\u201d\nThe only difference, they got button who say Switzerland. And with the light, I saw the button\nand I said, \u201cUh huh, maybe we got a chance,\u201d but otherwise they look exactly like the German.\nAnd they put us in the camp. A lot of people... they did have to put us ina camp. For one\nreason is because, a lot of people left France to go to Switzerland, but the Swiss didn\u2019t know who\nthey was. So, before, they did the same thing, they put them in a camp and ask questions.\nInterrogate them. And from there, they put me in another camp of children. And from there, you\ndid have a lot of family from Switzerland who said, \u201cI can take one or two boy in my home. I\nhave the room.\u201d And this is how I did go to this priest, who was, not Catholic, he was...",

        "A: By myself. My mother put me on the train and she told me a lot of thing. \u201cDon\u2019t say this, don\u2019t\nsay this, don\u2019t speak to nobody. Don\u2019t do this.\u201d She give me a couple sandwich. It took about\nmaybe five, six hour.",
        "Q: Do you remember specifically what she told you to do and do not do?",
        "A: Yes. \u201cIf anybody ask you if you Jewish, you say no. Where do you go? You go to see your\nuncle, to stay with him. What his name? You don\u2019t know. Somebody is going to be at the\nstation to pick you up. If any German soldier come close to you in the train and you see he start\nto ask paper, stay close to somebody, don\u2019t be by yourself.\u201d Just basic common things, which I\ndid. And when I arrive at Grenoble, she also give me a pass name. And she said, \u201cDon\u2019t go with\nanybody unless they tell you this.\u201d And I don\u2019t remember what it was. A word like summertime\nor something like this. And this lady came to me and said \u201cSummertime,\u201d and I said okay. And\nI did go with her. I didn\u2019t have any luggage. I did have a little package, but...",

        "A: I don\u2019t think so. Ifmy memory is correct, I was not afraid. I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Was it kind of an adventure?",
        "A: No. The funny part is all my life, like I said, I\u2019m not religious, but all my life, I believe since I\nwas a little boy... and I used to speak about this with my mother. I believe we don\u2019t die. The\nbody die, but the spirit stay alive. So, I said, the worst can happen to me, they going to get my\nbody, but my spirit is going to be reborn 1n another corp. This helped me a lot by making me\nfeel more secure. And dying, I never been afraid of dying. It\u2019s not a problem for me. I felt what\nshould happen, will happen. But no, I don\u2019t think I was afraid. No.",
        "Q: Did you have any problems on the train at all?\n11",
        "A: No. One time it was, I remember because I was standing. I didn\u2019t have any seat. I saw the\nGerman beginning the train and going room to room to ask paper. And I thought to myself, now\nis the time to find myself a tutor. So, it was a couple in the train. And nicely I ask them if... I\nalways been a good diplomat. I asked if I can sit close to them. And they felt something,\nprobably. The German come in, they say, \u201cWho is this boy?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s with us.\u201d And it was\nfinished. And they left. I remember the whole thing from Paris to Grenoble like it was\nyesterday. I could recognize the face of the German soldier. But it was, no it was not a game. I\nrealized it was very serious, but when everybody dance, you have to dance. And I thought if I\ndon\u2019t survive, no problem.",
        "Q: Who was there to greet you when you got off the train?",
        "A: A lady, and I don\u2019t remember this lady, because I didn\u2019t see her long enough. She took me to a\ngroup of people. I stay with this group ina room. I stay about a day or two. We didn\u2019t go out.\nAnd then my mother picked me up and I stay with her one day, and she put me on another train.\nTo save me, she try something... 1t was funny, but 1t was not funny in real. In Grenoble, she\nfound a way, I don\u2019t know how she did, she found a way to put me in a... Catholic people who\nare...",
        "Q: Monks?",
        "A: Monk.",
        "Q: Monastery?",
        "A: Yes. And I stay there for three days and I couldn\u2019t stand it. And I couldn\u2019t stand it. I left, I\nmean it was very hard to go out from the monastery. So, I put myself when... and I saw when\nthey took the garbage can. And I found an empty one and I did go inside. And they put me ona\ntruck. And I left the monastery and I did go see my mother. When I arrive, and she said, \u201cHow\ndid you get out? Why? What happened? You\u2019ve been safe!\u201d And I said, \u201cI can\u2019t stay there, it\u2019s\nimpossible. And one day or another, they going to come.\u201d So finally she decided to send me to\nSwitzerland.",
        "Q: But how long were you in Grenoble before you went to Pau to join your father?",

        "Q: And when you were in Grenoble was that during the time that the Italians were occupying that\narea?",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: No, Italian are very funny people. They are very, how can I say, I won\u2019t say romantic, but they\nare very nice. Even now, I don\u2019t know why, when I go to Europe, a lot of people, when I go to\nEurope I go with friends, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Italy.\u201d I don\u2019t want to go to Italy. It\u2019s not I don\u2019t like\nItalian, but they always romance, they are very crying, very... I don\u2019t like Italian. [Laughing]",
        "Q: Do you think that goes back to that time that you were there in Grenoble?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I have a hard time to analyze why I don\u2019t like Italian, but I don\u2019t\nknow. Spanish are completely different. They are more rough. Italian, when you go in Italy,\nmen walk in the street, holding hand by hand. They are very different. And I don\u2019t know why. I\nmean I wouldn\u2019t do any harm to Italian, but going to Italy. The d\u00e9cor is always the same. You\nbeen to Italy? Did you go to the Piazza San Marco? And you see the police man with the, they\nlook like... I don\u2019t like this. [Laughing] So, I avoid to go to Italy. Three years ago, I did have to\ngive a seminar in Torino, Turin in French. And I felt myself like twenty years ago, with all those\nguy, with the big parade, you know, they always...",
        "Q: A lot of pomp.",
        "A: Yes, they love this. And I don\u2019t. So, I don\u2019t go to Italy.",
        "Q: Why was it that your mother sent you to join your father in Pau?",
        "A: Because she thought it going to be much easier for her. I didn\u2019t know at the time. But it\u2019s going\nto be much easier for her to do what she was doing. Because I was not easy. I was not easy. I\ndidn\u2019t obey very good, when she say you stay in this room and you don\u2019t move. I didn\u2019t see\nreally the big danger. You know, Italian people are very nice, I can go in the street and walk,\nyou know. She say, \u201cNo, you stay here.\u201d So, she said, \u201cI will send you to your father. He\u2019s\ngoing to take care of you.\u201d But it was very dangerous where he was, so this is why they decide\nto send me in Switzerland.",
        "Q: Was your father involved in the Resistance also?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. No, I don\u2019t think so. No, he was too hot-blood. When it was bad where he was\nin Tarbes, and I don\u2019t know how they found out about him. The only thing I remember, he was\nin a big place, sitting on a bench and this police truck came to pick him up. And it was about\nten, twelve police man. And when from the witnessed friend who was with him, who survived,\nhe was almost naked. He fight so much, and he was so strong. And this was the last we knew\nabout him. Where was he killed? We don\u2019t know. Where is his body? We don\u2019t know. Where\nis he buried? We don\u2019t know. So, he fight for his life, but... No, he didn\u2019t have the diplomacy\nof my mother. She was more soft. For him, he was raised, he was orphan, so he was raised in\nRomania, the hard way. So, even when he came in France, for him, no discussion, he punch,\nthat\u2019s all. So.",
        "Q: How did you find out what happened to him?\n13",
        "A: Because his friend, who was at the time with him, saw the whole thing. And he witnessed. But\nhe died a long time ago, this guy. The only thing I remember, I\u2019m... some people are visual.\nYou can tell me a story about a place you\u2019ve been and I can see where you are. And if you\ndescribe the place, and the border of the sea, with the boats, with the mountain, the sun, the water\ncomes on your leg, I can see the whole thing. The picture is very clear. So, as soon as he\nexplained to me what happened, I can see the picture. I saw... I know where was the place. So,\nI can see this whole thing. And when this is in my memory, I remember.",
        "Q: How did you get from Grenoble to Pau?",
        "A: I took the train. My father told me if anything happened, \u201c\u201cGo home, here is the place where is\nthe money. Take the money, buy what you need.\u201d So, I did go buy a ticket and I did go see my\nmother again. And she said, \u201cNow it\u2019s time for you to escape.\u201d",
        "Q: So how long were you in Pau before you left again?",
        "A: Well, you see we moved from Pau to Tarbes, which is very close, maybe fifty miles. So it was a\nfew days, but I don\u2019t remember. I remember the room he rent with the little kitchen. How long\ndid I stay there? I have no idea, maybe two weeks, maybe two months, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And you were traveling the same way that you had traveled from Paris to Grenoble?",
        "A: The same, by train. Train in France is very safe. It\u2019s always on time and it\u2019s very easy, clean.\nAnd I did have my way to speak to people and trust them and they trust me. And you know,\nyou\u2019re always ready to, if you today, take the train and see a boy, eight, nine years old and he\u2019s\nby himself, you are going to tell him, \u201cCan I help you? Can I do something for you? What is\nyour life?\u201d \u201cWell, I left my father and I\u2019m going to meet my mother, but I\u2019m alone on the train.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have any money? Do you want to eat something?\u201d This is a normal, right? And this is\nwhat happened. And people were very nice and again like I tell you, I got a little bit diplomacy.\nAnd I didn\u2019t have any problem.",
        "Q: What was your father doing during that time?",
        "A: In Pau and Tarbes? Nothing. He couldn\u2019t work. He was just, probably waiting until the war is\ngoing to be finished.",
        "Q: Was he...",
        "A: It was not before, long before the war finished that he died. I think it was a question of months,\nsix month or seven month, something like this and the war was finished. He was not lucky.",

I remember one time, he\ndid have, he became very ill. My father never got ill. He became very ill and when the doctor\ncame, he palpate the stomach, and when he push in one side, he scream so hard, they thought it\nwas appendicitis. And really it was a kidney stone. So, he was in the hospital for three, three,\nfour day and he came out and it was all over. He lost weight, he was beautiful.",
        "Q: Was your brother there at the time?",
        "A: Yes. And my brother, Gaston, give him a hard time, because at the time he was seventeen,\neighteen, something like this. Very good looking boy and for him, war didn\u2019t mean nothing. He\nwants to have a good time. That was a big problem between my father and him.",
        "Q: What did you do with your days?",
        "A: Start to read as much as I could. Walking with my father. He used to... he loved to walk. So I\nwalked with him. We did go buy some food. He was cooking. We never been to a restaurant.\nHe was cooking. He was not such a good cook, but it was okay. [Laughing] But we stayed\ntogether most of the time. He always got an eye on me. And we stay together. But I was young\nand it\u2019s hard for me to remember a lot of things. But I have a little picture in my mind of things\nwe did together. I will show you a picture of the whole family when I was a little boy.",
        "Q: Are there any other things that stand out in your memory from that time?",
        "A: No, everything is very clear. Everything... the only thing which is not clear is the time, how\nlong did I stay there? How many time did I go back and forth? But I remember where I was\nliving with my mother. I remember one time, I told you she did have a gun in the book, and she\ndid go bring some food in the hospital for French Underground soldier, who were wound. And\nwe came back to the house and we went on subway, but not underground, over ground. The\npolice, German police stopped the whole thing, make us going down and align everybody. And I\nsaw my mother with the book under her arm and I said, \u201cPhew, if they open this.\u201d\u201d They ask\nquestion, and up 1n the train again and we left.

So you, when you, you\nwere going back and forth a little bit between, between where your father was and where your\nmother was and that\u2019s not all together... you\u2019re not sure about how many times you went back\nand forth. Is that what you said?",
        "A: Yeah, no more than twice at the most. One, sure, but twice at the most.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And this is when I did go back and see my mother, who tried to find out, but we couldn\u2019t. I\nmean she couldn\u2019t find out anything about it, because relation between... the situation didn\u2019t... it\nwas not easy. She couldn\u2019t call anybody. She couldn\u2019t call the authorities without revealing\nherself.",
        "Q: Were you with, was your brother still with you at that time?",
        "A: Yeah, he didn\u2019t live with us. He live with, in another place. I don\u2019t know where. Where was\nhe? What was he doing? I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t know what, where he was.",
        "Q: So, when you returned to Grenoble and prepared to go to Switzerland, your brother was not with\nyou?",
        "A: No, no. He never been, at this time he never been with me. The only time I saw him again, is\nwhen the war finished, I was with Mr. Lederman in Switzerland. And I said, \u201cNow it\u2019s time for\nme to go home.\u201d And he say, \u201cPatience,\u201d you know, \u201clet\u2019s wait a little bit.\u201d\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I\nknow where we\u2019re going to find... I know where I\u2019m going to find my mother.\u201d And he said,\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to wait a little bit?\u201d Because it was a lot of thing going on. And I said, \u201cNo,\nno, I would like to go now.\u201d So, he was a little bit reluctant to let me go, but he let me go. And I\ndid go to Grenoble, from Switzerland to Grenoble where my mother used to live. And I didn\u2019t\n16\nfind her. So, I did go to, there was a Jewish association in Grenoble, so I did go there. And they\nsaid they knew about my mother. They said, \u201cNo, she did go back to Paris and her sister\napartment, because her apartment was with people, with your brother, Gaston.\u201d I said, \u201cHow\ncan I go?\u201d And they asked me, \u201cDo you have money? We\u2019ll buy you a ticket.\u201d They bought me\na ticket, train again. And I did go to Paris. And when I did go to the train in Grenoble, I met a\nyoung soldier, French soldier and I did the whole travel with him. He took care of me. And\nbefore we left, this lady from the Jewish association sent a wire to my mother and when I arrive\nin the train station in Paris, my mother and Gaston were there waiting for me. And we did go\nsee, we did go to the apartment of her sister, who die in Auschwitz and it was nobody in the\napartment. It was a very small apartment and oh, maybe... time for me is very hard... maybe two\nmonths later or three months later, the Jewish people from the camp, from Auschwitz, Dachau,\nBuchenwald, all those places, start to come back in Paris. And it was a big hotel, called Hotel\nLutecia (ph) prepare for clean them, to ask paper, if they got anything, you know. And Hotel\nLutecia call us and say we have one Pressman. So, we did go there right away and it was\nBernard. But we couldn\u2019t see him. We didn\u2019t know where he was. So, we wait, go, ask,\ncouldn\u2019t find him. The next day... so, we did go home at this apartment and the next day we\nreceive a man, who said, \u201cYour son did go to the old apartment,\u201d who was let\u2019s say like, five\nblocks from where we were. So, we did go by foot, walking and here, is coming, my brother.\nThis is where we find out my other brother was dead. He was killed in Auschwitz. And Bernard\nwas alive. Then we did go to the apartment of my aunt, sister of my mother, and life started to\nre-organize. We want to recuperate the fabric of my father. Everything was gone, but at least\nthe wall was there and my brother decided to\u2014because he was trained by my father\u2014to open the\nplace. And with my mother, they start to re-open the place and I started to go to college, to\nschool, to school first. And after I decided to go to college. And it was a little fight, family\nfight, because they want me to be an upholsterer like my father and I said no, I want to study\nmedicine. Everybody said, \u201cBut we cannot help you,\u201d and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t ask for help. I will\nwork myself.\u201d I found a little room and I was working, doing a lot of things and studying\nmedicine. After this, I became the doctor of the family. [Laughing]",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back because I want to hear about your time in Switzerland and I want to hear, can you\ntell me a little bit more in detail about your journey to Switzerland?",
        "A: Uh huh. Yeah, it was a very, very interesting. I think I wouldn\u2019t study all the study I did, if I\ndidn\u2019t go with Pastor Lederman and his wife. Because I speak always about him. His name was\nCharles, but his wife was something great. I mean, she was a teacher in school for children, but\nshe was a very, very strong person. And when they accept me, I receive a tag around my neck.\nThey put me again in another train from Geneva to, it\u2019s a little town where they used to live,\nRances. Very small town. He was the pastor of the town. And they came and picked me up. I\ndidn\u2019t know where I was. Mine parrain, my godfather was very, very cheerful, very big open\nmind, very smart man. They were a very nice couple, but they never could have any children.\nSo, mine godfather was priest, so he said, \u201cYou going to go to the synagogue.\u201d And I said, \u201cI\nnever been to a synagogue and I don\u2019t want to go to a synagogue.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re\nJewish, you\u2019re going to go to the synagogue.\u201d So, every week I did have to go and it was far\naway, because there was no synagogue where he was. So, I did have to take the bus and I didn\u2019t\nlike it all. But he said, \u201cNo, you have a wonderful religion, you have to keep with it. Okay.\nAnd I don\u2019t want for you, unless you feel, but you don\u2019t have no obligation to come in my\n17\nchurch. If you want to come, no problem, but I don\u2019t want you...\u201d And I said, \u201cCan I ring the\nbell?\u201d And he said, \u201cIf you want to, Sunday morning you can ring the bell.\u201d So, I ring the bell\nand he introduce me in a Sunday, when I was at his place. The second Sunday he introduce me\nto all the congregation. Swiss people are very, very nice people. And they treat me like the son\nof the house. They give me aroom. I remember they did have a German Shepherd, who was\ntrained. He was in the same time\u2014I don\u2019t know how you call this\u2014a priest who take care of\nprison people. And he used to go with his dog, in case one of the prisoner did go away, the dog\nis going to be able... He was a very, very funny man, very smart, very funny man. And I help as\nmuch as I could. I carry the milk, because they did have a lot of cow. So, I work outside of the\nschool for three, four hour every day, carrying the milk from the cow to the company where they\nmake the cheese. And it was really, a family. They want me to learn how to play piano. They\ndid have a piano. And since I have my own piano and I play because of them. He always, he\nmake me feel something I never felt before: the importance of knowledge. And this is when I\nstart to read, this is when I start to write. I spend with them less than one year, but I think the\nfoundation of my life was based on this time I spend with them, because they were so good and\nso hard. They were not... they were sweet, but they let me pass nothing. I did have my job to do\nand I better do it, otherwise... And it became normal with me and really I spend... I learn how to\nlove nature. Nature in Paris, you don\u2019t know how to differentiate champignon...you know\nwhat...?",
        "Q: Mushrooms?",
        "A: Mushrooms. He took me to the woods, days, to say this one is not good, this one is good. Took\nthe good one, brought it home, cook them, make a meal with it. I didn\u2019t know all this. I didn\u2019t\nhave no idea. And it was very good for me, because it was a foundation of life. And every time\nup to this day, I think all the time about what they did to me as a kid. And I became a man\nbecause of them. And this is why, all the time, even like I said, I did go see them last, between\n\u201898 and \u201899, Christmas. And I couldn\u2019t find them, they moved. I called everywhere. But\notherwise, every time I go to Europe, I go see them. We spend beautiful time, quality time, even\nif we don\u2019t speak together, he is the same. And she is the same. In my mind, she is the most\nbeautiful woman I met in my life. She, the last time I saw her I think she was seventy-two and I\nthink she was as beautiful as she was when I was a little boy. And he is the stronger man. It was\nreally something. For me, it was a big chance to meet those people. And like I said, when I did\ngo back and I found my mother. I said, \u201cThe first thing we can do, as soon as we get a little bit\nmoney, I want for you to meet.\u201d And I think it was one year later, I bought a used car and I took\nmy mother and we did go see them. And they were very happy and I was very happy to see them\nagain. And like I said, I always, any chance that I did have to go, I did go see them, because I\nfelt this... we were not family, but 1t was more than family. It was a good, a good thing. It\u2019s a\ngood memory.",
        "Q: Do you ever think about the irony of that...?",
        "A: Yes. Oh, gosh. Life is irony, the whole life. When.... you know, when you become old, older\nthan younger, life is an irony. Why this happened? What is the purpose of life? What is the\nreason of life? We don\u2019t know. But I think everything is written, you in your life, another one in\nanother life, everything is written. I say since a long time, we all have a ticket in the pocket.\n18\nYou have the date of birth and there is no date where you\u2019re going to go, to be gone, but really\nthere is one, but you don\u2019t know it. And it\u2019s funny, because I say to a lot of my patients, we\ncelebrate birth of people, but we don\u2019t celebrate death and death is something of life. It\u2019s the end\nof life. If you did have a bad life, you\u2019re going to have a bad time to re-incarnate in a good life.\nBut if you look your life and you said yes, I did have bad time like everybody else, but the good\ntime were good. And when I remember all this, all the good time, it was wonderful. It\u2019s\nexperience. And in life, you cannot have all the time, good time. And on top of this, I say this\ntoo, some of my good patient with whom I have a good exchange, money is important, but\ncompared to destiny, money is nothing. Destiny is what is going to make you what you are.\nYou are going to be able to enjoy anything: a fruit, a good meal, good company. And when I say\ngood company, feeling you are with somebody, friends, and you are on the same level. You can\nexchange... if you say something a little bit different, people are not going to laugh. They are\ngoing to say either \u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201d or they\u2019re going to say, \u201cI know what you\nmean. I feel it, what you feel.\u201d And this is the purpose of life, but it\u2019s not every day you find\nthings like this and it\u2019s not every day you are in tune with things. But when you are, it\u2019s\nwonderful and the rest, well, you have to do with. You receive a bad bill, you have a bad\nproblem, you have a flat tire in the middle of nowhere... it\u2019s tough, but you have to deal with it.\nYou say, okay, I will remember next time I\u2019m going to have a good time, this flat tire. It was\nbad, but in exchange look what good time I got now. And I think it\u2019s a good philosophy.",
        "Q: As far as the idea of destiny, do you apply that to the Holocaust? Do you think that the\nHolocaust, I mean when you mentioned being predestined, having something written down... do\nyou think of the Holocaust that way?",
        "A: Yes, yes. And it\u2019s very hard, maybe it\u2019s because as a Jewish boy I can say this. You know,\nJewish people accept Jewish jokes from another Jew, but if another one does the jokes, they\ndon\u2019t like it. Did the Jewish people deserve what happened? I don\u2019t think so. Nobody deserve\nto suffer this way, but in the whole world, in the whole idea of human people, is it something\nwho 1s going to serve humanity? I think so. I think so. How many people, who were in\nAuschwitz, in all those camps, are going to be able to use it? Minority. But the one who are\ngoing to be able to do it are going to bring something and we don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to\nput this. On the newborn? There is a new book, written by a Rabbi, and people don\u2019t like him\nvery much, because he write, he wrote this book about reincarnation. And he said a lot of people\ncall him, write to him and they say, \u201cI\u2019m born in a Catholic family. I\u2019m Catholic. I go to the\nchurch every Sunday. I believe on Jesus Christ and I believe in God, but inside of me I got this\nJewish feeling and I don\u2019t understand why.\u201d And it\u2019s uh, how can I say, it\u2019s surprising. And\nfrom what he say, he thinks they were in the Holocaust and they reincarnate in another corps, but\nthey got this knowledge and they want to explain this. Long time ago, maybe not so long, but\ntwenty years ago, you never spoke about reincarnation. A lot of people knew about, but they\ndon\u2019t want to say anything, because they say, \u201cWell, they going to think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d Now it is\nmore open. Sometime when I feel people react and it\u2019s a small group... I give a lot of lecture on\nacupuncture, and acupuncture related to the human body and the illness of some people. And I\ngo a little bit further and reincarnation and a lot of people react and say, \u201cI felt this. I felt I was\nin another life. I cannot pinpoint, but I know this is not my first life.\u201d So, I think, coming back\nto the idea of the Holocaust, it served a purpose, which one, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m sure it serve\na purpose. If you say this to my brother, he\u2019s going to laugh for three hour, but it\u2019s okay. And I\n19\nmean, it\u2019s his problem, it\u2019s not mine. I don\u2019t bring any proof, but I know there is a purpose. Can\nit be another Holocaust? Yes. The same one we saw? No. It\u2019s going to be something\ncompletely different, but Hell is here on earth, so anything can happen. Anything.",
        "Q: When you think in those terms, how do you, how do the Germans fit in? So... are they carrying\nout something that needs to happen? That is predestined? In other words, are they attuned with\ndestiny in some way?",
        "A: To answer your question you have to read a little bit about Hitler, which very few Jewish people\nwant to touch. I read the life of Hitler. He didn\u2019t have any chance in life. He could not succeed\nto nothing. He was nobody. He came at the right time and somebody above used him. But he\nwas nothing. Are we going to remember Hitler? Yes, for a long time, but not for the real\npurpose. Because who was Hitler? Nothing. Germany was ready. Germany need somebody\nlike Hitler and if it was Hitler or George or anybody else, it would be the same thing. We speak\nabout the devil. Germany, the German people at this time, did find the chief of the devil and\neverything was so simple to organize. You see in life, people who try to organize something,\nsomething small, a factory... they never make it. Because it\u2019s not the time and somebody above\nEarth, who\u2019s got the little button, don\u2019t push the button, say, because it\u2019s not for him. It\u2019s not\nmeant to happen, not with him. So we are not going to move.",
        "Q: So you can kind of think of the Holocaust as being Divine will carried out and that Hitler was an\ninstrument of that?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Because the whole story like, and I don\u2019t... Rothschild said something\none day, \u201cFor you Jewish people if you like it or not, this is the truth. You have the low level\nJewish people, you have the middle level Jewish people and you have the aristocratic Jewish\npeople.\u201d And it\u2019s true. All the Jew are so smart, all the Jew are doctor? No. What about the\nJew who is a fireman? What about the Jew who 1s a police man? He\u2019s got the brain of\nRothschild? No. We did have, I mean... we, they did have to show to humanity Jewish people\nare not the enemy. Because, example, Israel, you have prostitute in Israel. Jewish woman who\nare prostitute? You say this to my father, if he was alive at the time, there are Jewish prostitute?\nHe would say, \u201cNever. Woman, Jewish woman never can be a prostitute.\u201d Yes my dear, there\nare Jewish prostitute. You have lot of people in Israel who are crooked. We are people and this\nshould stop racism. And when you speak with... all black people are stupid? No. You have a\nlot of black people who are born in poor family. They don\u2019t know what is good from bad. They\nhave a father, but they don\u2019t know who he is. And you compare this black man with a judge\nfrom the high circuit, who judge things? How can you? They are two black people. With\nJewish people it is the same thing. This is why I think the Holocaust was made, one of the\nreasons in my mind, to show we are people. There are good Jew and you have bad Jew.",
        "Q: What do you think some of the other reasons are?",
        "A: About the Holocaust?",
        "Q: Yeah.\n20",
        "A: Human race like atrocity. When they are... let\u2019s say you are on the road and there is a bad\naccident. I stop. Iam a doctor. If I can help, I will do it. But I don\u2019t want to stop to see\nsomebody bleeding, just for the pleasure. You have a crash of a plane. There was one big one in\nParis a long time ago. Everybody come because somebody told them you can see a leg here and\na head there. And in your normal mind you are going to say, \u201cOh, this is terrible.\u201d But when\nyou speak with people, they love to see this. Why do you think they show so bad thing on TV?\nBecause people like it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very good thing to show all this... it\u2019s terrible. They\nlike it. When you see all this blood going out, this head split, the eyes fall down. They like it.\nPeople are mean [laughing] sometime, but this 1s the way we are, and I think the Holocaust\nhelped this, to show, you know... they did this, can we see a little bit...?\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\n21\nTape 2, Side B",
        "Q: Do you think people are learning not to see things that way, through looking at that experience in\nretrospect?",
        "A: I have a friend, he was an attorney and he raised his child, his boy, in the religion. Not... but, he\nraised him as a Jewish boy. And the boy 1s a spoiled, what I called a spoiled American boy.\nAnd his father insists for him to go to Washington to see the Holocaust museum. And he said,\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to go there.\u201d He said, \u201cI insist, I want for you to go see a little bit of what did\nhappen.\u201d And I said, \u201cSo?\u201d when he came back. And he said, \u201cWell, he was not the same. He\ndidn\u2019t have no idea. He heard Holocaust. He knew it was a museum at Washington, but he said,\n\u2018It\u2019s a museum.\u2019 But when he came back, it was not a joke. He said, \u2018I didn\u2019t know it was like\nthis.\u2019\u201d And I think this is why there is a museum. This is why you have people working in the\nHolocaust, not to forget. Not to enjoy, but not to forget, for young people, Jew or Non-Jew,\nanybody, to see: This happened. This is not a movie. This happened, so you have to remember\nto do anything you can, we can, not to happen again.",
        "Q: I\u2019m pursuing kind of a metaphysical line of questioning, but do you think, so you feel like people\nhave the power to make it not happen again?",
        "A: Yes, they do, absolutely. If they know what\u2019s going on. Because if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s\ngoing on... When you see a movie and you know it\u2019s fiction, if you see it or you don\u2019t, it\u2019s not a\nproblem. But when things happen... I have a movie from the camp. This camp was liberated by\nthe English army and the English are very tough. They show, they took the whole, bigger than a\nvillage, I think it was about fifteen, twenty thousand people. And they opened where they put all\nthe dead, the cadaver, the Jewish people who they killed, they opened this with a special machine\nand they forced every people living in the town to carry a dead body and put it on the truck to\ngive them a decent burial. Don\u2019t you think they are going to remember? Yes, they will.\nBecause when you touch with your hand, a dead body, you remember for the rest of your life.\nAnd if we could make people touch people or nothing else, force the youth to go to a hospital\nhere, in Lexington, Louisville, anyplace, once an hour, every week and just walk and see people\nsuffering, they are going to be a little bit different. American youth think they are indestructible,\nyou know? They got the power. They can do anything until they die. This is why you have so\nmany people who cripple themselves. They jump from, with a cord around their feet, you\nknow... \u201cI\u2019m the best,\u201d you know, the guy who jump with the motorcycle in Colorado. Okay, if\nthe guy survive, it\u2019s okay, if he die, everybody should see it, because life is not a joke. Life is a\ngift. You can use it badly and you can use it intelligently, but just by jumping and so you see...\nit\u2019s like the guy who jumped from the Eiffel Tower and he say, \u201cNothing can happen to me.\u201d\nAnd you know, he fall down and every stage, he say, \u201cYou see, nothing happened to me,\u201d until\nhe reach the downstairs and then that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t... gravity is like life, you don\u2019t play game\nwith life. Take a knife, stick 1t in your stomach and you\u2019ll see what happen. And everybody\nshould know about the Holocaust just as a reminder. Justice in this country 1s too lenient.\nYesterday they liberate a man, who did abuse children. He got ten year and after five year, they\nlet him go. He\u2019s going to do it again. What should we do? This is another discussion, but don\u2019t\nlet him loose, because he\u2019s going to take care... he\u2019s going to take another innocent child. This\nman is sick. We have to do something about this. But don\u2019t say, \u201cWell, you know, what can we\n22\ndo?\u201d What do you mean, what can we do? Let\u2019s us do the best we can, but do something.\nDon\u2019t let a man wild with normal people.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll have more of a chance to talk more about these things I hope, but let\u2019s go back to\nSwitzerland. Before you joined the Ledermans, you were in a refuge camp for a couple of\nmonths, it sounded like.",
        "A: Yeah, it start, it start... I arrived on the first, a refuge of civil, I mean March \u201844, the thirty of\nMarch, \u201844 and I stay until, one month about. After this they put me in a camp of refugee for the\n25\" of April.",
        "Q: April 25\"...",
        "A: That\u2019s right, until May the 19. And after this I was authorized to live in Rances with Pastor\nLederman. It was the May the 30\", 1944.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of your time in those refugee camps?",
        "A: Yes, Ido. It was not fun. It was very strict. We slept on the floor. I don\u2019t speak about the food.\nWe survived. But it was a camp. I mean, it was not a vacation camp. It was really very hard,\nbut like I said before, it was all kind of people. You did have bad people. You did have all kind\nof people. So they couldn\u2019t do otherwise. But by the date, you realize it was not a long time, it\nwas maybe two months. After what I saw before, two month for me was nothing. Because like I\nsaid, after this, life was great with Pastor Lederman. So, it was an experience again. For me,\neverything is an experience. When I\u2019m going to die, it\u2019s going to be an experience.",
        "Q: Did you cross legally into Switzerland?",
        "A: Illegally.",
        "Q: Illegally.",
        "A: Oh yes, completely illegal. This is why they put us ina camp. Because if it was legally, I enter\nSwitzerland, it was no problem. But it was illegally, because they didn\u2019t want to open the door.\nThey didn\u2019t want to, for anybody to come in Switzerland, because they didn\u2019t have any room.\nEverybody wants to go there. So, it was hard and they did have too much people. So, they tried\nto push away all the people, until the last two or three weeks, the Swiss Army was on the border.\nAnd then anybody who wants to cross, they shoot them. They didn\u2019t want to let anybody come\nin, because a lot of German put civilian things to come. They didn\u2019t want to let them in.",
        "Q: What did you do with your days during the time in the camp?",
        "A: In the camp? Like a prison, you walk around. You think about food. You cry. You fine if you\nknow somebody...",
        "Q: Did you know anyone? Did you have any friends?\n23",
        "A: No, no, there was no... I didn\u2019t know anybody.",
        "Q: And did you have anything to do... Did you meet the Ledermans before they said \u201cYes, we\u2019 ll\ntake this young man?\u201d",
        "A: No, no. No, no. No, no. They... this guy would go with this guy, this guy with this guy. How\ndid they decide for me to go with Pastor Lederman? I don\u2019t know. But I know I was designed to\ngo there. I did go there. And that\u2019s it. [Laughing]",
        "Q: What was Mrs. Lederman\u2019s name? Do you remember?",
        "A: I knew you going to ask me. And I can not remember.",
        "Q: Maybe it will come back later. And you went to school there?",
        "A: In Rances, yeah. It was a little school, you know, an elementary school, where I was not very\ngood. The teacher said I don\u2019t do any effort to learn. When I think about, I know why. At the\ntime I didn\u2019t know why. But when I think, you know, I was... I did go over my head, study for\nwhat? For who? You know, it\u2019s not like a man who is twenty and decides to become an\nattorney. He is going to study hard, night and day. But at my age, nine years old, you put me in\na school to learn about mathematic and all this. I don\u2019t care. I want to know, where 1s my\nbrother, where is my mother? I would like to know what am I going to become? How long this\nwar is going to be? So, no, I was not a good student at all. [Laughing]",
        "Q: Did everyone know you were Jewish?",
        "A: Oh yes. Oh, he was proud of it. He was telling to everybody... well, he introduce me, \u201cThis 1s\nmy little Jewish boy.\u201d Oh no, people were very open and friendly. I mean, you know, \u201cI got a\nJewish boy. No, no, no, this is my Jewish boy.\u201d He was proud of it. The time was very good, I\nmean everything was... it was nothing, I can\u2019t say they were mean. The only time he was mad at\nme is one day, I touch his gun. He did have a gun and I touched it. And he was mad. He said,\n\u201cLet me show you how dangerous it is.\u201d And he shot something in the room and boy, I never\ntouch his gun again. [Laughing] They were very nice. I have really only wonderful memories.",
        "Q: Did you make any friends with any other children?",
        "A: No. Probably yes, but, you know, I left. And it took a little bit time before I came back, so it\nwas... No, I don\u2019t remember anybody. I\u2019ve been back to the little town and I did hardly\nrecognize the place. It was people in the street and I was looking, do I know them? Do I don\u2019t?\nVery hard.",
        "Q: You mentioned that, that was the time when you think you started to get interested in medicine?",
        "A: Uh huh.\n24",
        "Q: How did that happen?",
        "A: Gradually, gradually I start to, I was very interested in the human body, the function of the\nhuman body and the natural healing, mostly. But it was very little by little. I cannot say it came\none night, I wake up in the morning, I said, \u201cI want to be a doctor.\u201d No, no. I thought it would\nbe interesting to study and every day said, \u201cOh, but it\u2019s going to be hard. It\u2019s going to, maybe\nI\u2019m not fit for this.\u201d So, little by little, and it came, and I start my study. Even when I start my\nstudy, I said \u201cI will start, if it works, it\u2019s okay. If it doesn\u2019t work, Pll do something else.\u201d So, I\nwas not saying \u201cI will do it.\u201d No. \u201cI will try, if 1t doesn\u2019t work, I will do something else. I will\nsell refrigerator.\u201d [Laughing |",

They are going to circle like this.\u201d Like I said, he was a very\nintellectual man and he wants to tell me as much as he can. And he was treating me like I was\nhis son. So, I have to be informed, if I like it or not.",

        "Q: Do you think Pastor Lederman knew?",
        "A: I think so. He didn\u2019t want to talk to me about it, but he knew probably. I always suspect that he\nwas Jew, with his name. It\u2019s a Jewish name. And, but one day, I said something like this and he\ndidn\u2019t answer me, meaning he doesn\u2019t want to speak about it. And I stop right there, because I\ndidn\u2019t want to be, you know, mean. If he did want to tell me, he would at the time. But he didn\u2019t\nsay anything, so I didn\u2019t pursue. That\u2019s it. We stopped there. But Lederman, it\u2019s a Jewish\nname. Unless... it\u2019s probably what he did. His father was a tailor. So, maybe he became\nProtestant. You know the joke we do? How do you change a Jew to become a Protestant? You\nhit him in the back and he turn around and he protest. And he become a Protestant. [Laughter. |",
        "Q: They should have told that one to Martin Luther, huh?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So do you remember hearing that the war ended while you were in Switzerland? Were you in\nSwitzerland when the war ended?",
        "A: Yes. And well it was in every radio, every paper. It was big celebration. At the same time it\nwas very scary because, like I said, you know, the German tried to go away the best they could.\n25\nI don\u2019t think I left right away. It took me, maybe two or three weeks, maybe a month before I\nleft. But I didn\u2019t stay long after I heard the war was finished. And did want to join my family.\nAnd, but it was... yes, it was in Switzerland I heard all this. Yeah, I was there.",
        "Q: Do you remember celebrating in any particular way?",
        "A: No, no, no. Like I said, it was a little village where we were. And Pastor Lederman was a little\nbit sad to see... this I remember vividly. It meant, \u201cYou stay with us, we treat you like family\nand now the war is finished, you can\u2019t wait to go away.\u201d And at the time, I didn\u2019t know what to\nsay. I felt bad, but my reaction was normal. And his reaction was normal, too. So, we both\nbeen right, but I want to go back and find how many member of my family are alive. But we\nnever spoke about this after this; 1t was finished. We didn\u2019t speak about... anymore about this.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re something like thirteen years old at that time, right?",
        "A: Yeah, I think so, something like this. Yeah, twelve, between twelve and thirteen.",
        "Q: And you just left on your own and forged out to look for your parents without any assistance?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. No, it\u2019s uh, I always been a traveler. I like to travel. I was used to, it was not... P\u2019ve\nbeen to Japan five years ago. And I don\u2019t know why, at the last minute I panic. And it was\nbecause of the language. I don\u2019t speak Japanese. And I panic, and I did have to speak to myself\nand said, It\u2019s nothing. It is another land. And when I was there, it was easy, it was no problem.\nI enjoy. I got lost many time and I always found my way back. It was no problem. But no, it\ndidn\u2019t occur to me to say, /\u2019m not going to go back because nobody is going to take me. I was\nnot used to have somebody who take me by the hand and bring you everywhere. I was used to\ngo by myself.",
        "Q: Was it something from before the war that you think was just in your nature or is this something\nthat... ?",
        "A: Yeah, I think it was in my nature. It\u2019s something... I\u2019m shy on things. I know where I\u2019m shy,\nand I know where I\u2019m not shy. Every personality is different. I think we have to know our\nweakness points. And I, this was not on my weakness. It would be very hard for me to ask\nsomething on my favor, but I can ask anything for somebody else. But traveling never bothered\nme. I can go anyplace. I like to travel.",
        "Q: I assume that during that time that you were with the Ledermans, you didn\u2019t have any word from\nyour mother at all.",
        "A: No, not at all, because, the only time I remember is, we tried to reach my mother by phone, but\nshe was not home. I mean, she was not at the home where she used to be when I left her. In the\napartment of her sister, they didn\u2019t have any phone. And it was a big mess. So, I couldn\u2019t reach\nher. The only way to reach her is by the Jewish Association, who knew exactly where she was\nand they sent a cable saying, \u201cYour son is leaving Grenoble at this time and he\u2019s going to be in\nParis in the gare at this time.\u201d And they were there, so.\n26",
        "Q: Going back to one more thing, you mentioned that while you were there at the Lederman\u2019s you\nstarted to read a lot and to become interested... do you remember what you were reading?",
        "A: No, no. I don\u2019t... no. They did have hundreds of books and I was very interested on philosophy.\nI like philosophy of everything, life, but I don\u2019t know what I was reading. It\u2019s too far away.",
        "Q: Did you talk to Pastor Lederman at all about your interest in education or in studying medicine\nor any...\u201d Did he encourage you in any way?",
        "A: No, no. The only thing he knew to tell is, I... you know those little bugs who eat potato? Every\ntime, every day we did have to go for an hour and collect this and put it in a bottle. And I used to\nsay it hurt my back, so he used to call me Paul with the ribs who go up and down. He cannot\nbend. So this is why... he made fun of me, because he thought I was\u2014and I was probably\u2014\nlazy. Some work outside I didn\u2019t like too much. I did like to go to the mushroom, but I didn\u2019t\nlike to bend and put my hand on this mud and all things, you know. So, he always make fun of\nme. But he said, \u201cYou going to like to give speeches. You\u2019re going to like to speak in front of\ncrowd.\u201d And it\u2019s true. I give a lot of seminar and I feel very comfortable. I don\u2019t have any\nproblem with people. And if some people ask me question I cannot answer, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know\nthe answer, but if you give me one of your card, I will find out and write to you.\u201d But we never\nspoke about what kind of study I\u2019m going to do or what is going to be my future, what kind of\njob I\u2019m going to do. No. Because I don\u2019t think, I didn\u2019t know anything myself. I don\u2019t have\nany idea what I\u2019m going to do. But I know, the only thing I know is, they change my life.\nThey... the orientation was different.",
        "Q: And do you remember reuniting with your mother and your brother?",
        "A: Uh huh.",
        "Q: Can you talk about that moment?",
        "A: Well, I have to say something. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to find this funny or different. I\ndidn\u2019t have a very good relation with my brother, Gaston. Never. Never been real brother.\nWhy, I don\u2019t know. But my mother, when I was very young, I used to discuss with her, as long\nas she did have the power on me, it was okay. But when I grew up and because of the separation\nof this, my attitude changed. And my mother is a very, used to be a very strong personality. She\nwants to organize everything. Example, when I came to study chiropractic in the United States...\nI was married at the time and my daughter was eighteen months old. And she didn\u2019t understand\nwhy I took my daughter with me instead of leaving my daughter with her for two year. And I\nsaid, I don\u2019t know how you can think about me leaving my daughter for two year, eighteen\nmonth? I\u2019m never going to be her father anymore. So, we did have a very, very big discussion\nabout this and for the time I was gone, she never spoke to me. And my brother, Bernard, reunite\nus when I came back. But the problem 1s, I was at the time, as stubborn as she was. And we\nwere always on challenge. I like her, I would do anything for her, but I couldn\u2019t receive any\norder from her. And it\u2019s a feeling very hard to explain, because like when I open my office... she\ncame in. She wants to organize my office. And I said, \u201cMother, it\u2019s my office, it\u2019s my place and\n27\nI\u2019m going to organize it my way. You like it, you come. You don\u2019t like it, 1t\u2019s too bad.\u201d But\nuntil the end, she wants to be the boss. [Laughing.] And she never could, because probably we\nwere the same way, you know? But so the relation was not, I saw my mother, jump on her, kiss\nher? No. And my mother was not a kisser. One kiss a week was the top, no more. So she stay\nin her, in her back, and I stay, and my other brother, Gaston, is... 1t was, is and was a very funny\ncharacter. He looks good and it was enough for him. So, he was thinking more to buy nice suit,\nnice thing. And when I came back he was a growing man and you know, he didn\u2019t want to\nbother with me. I was the little boy. So, the relation was short.\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n28\nTape 3, Side A",
        "Q: Okay, this is an interview with Dr. Paul Pressman, a continuation. It\u2019s now August 17\", 1999,\ncontinuing our interview from July. And this is tape number three, side A. I wondered when I\nwas looking over the notes. I took some, listened to the interview that we did last time and I took\nsome notes on things that we had talked about, and one thing which stood out, that I didn\u2019t ask\nyou about was, I wondered how you felt... you were talking about your mother\u2019s role in the\nresistance and discovering that she was actually a fighter or a captain in the resistance movement\nand that she showed you this gun that she kept hidden in this book. And I wondered how that\neffected your view of your mother and how, whether that moment was significant to you in some\nway?",
        "A: Not specifically, because I think I knew my mother since a long time, since I was very little, I\nmean when I was eight, nine years old, we did have very serious question to ask to each other.\nAnd I think basically we didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t have, she didn\u2019t have any secret from me, so I was not\nsurprised and not shocked to see what she was doing. And she was doing this very naturally. I\nmean, she didn\u2019t show off. It was what she was doing and that\u2019s all. But it was not something...\na big surprise for me. I never been afraid of gun. I never been excited over gun, but I\nunderstood. The question... it was no question in my mind. It was a normal way of life,\nknowing what she was doing before. And it was, to me, a normal situation.",
        "Q: Knowing what she was doing before, meaning that...?",
        "A: Before she used to go, at the time when she was in Grenoble, in south of France, she used to go\nand bring food, letter, visit French Resistance in the hospital. And those people were guarded by\nGerman. And she always found a way to go in, bring what she did have to bring. She did a lot\nof risky things, but the natural way. So, knowing this, after this, knowing she was carrying a\ngun, didn\u2019t surprise me.",
        "Q: The reason that I noticed it and that I asked you about it, one reason was that the gun, the issue of\nyour experiences with a gun came up a couple of times during the interview yesterday. You\ntalked about the one time that, or not yesterday but earlier, you talked about the one time Pastor\nLederman got angry at you was when he saw you playing with his gun. And then you talked\nabout that other incident with your mother. And then you mentioned also that you feel safer if\nyou have a gun now. And that was something you didn\u2019t talk about on tape. And I was\nwondering if you would talk about that?",
        "A: Well, it took me a long time before I could train myself. I have now thirty year of martial art\nbehind me. I always felt in general, the Jewish people don\u2019t like gun, don\u2019t like to fight. I mean\nI speak about the Jewish people in France. And it was a discovery for, I think, every Jewish\npeople in the world when we found out Israelian soldier were one of the best in the world. And I\nwas not surprised, I was happy about, but generally, even up to this date, when you speak gun\nwith Jewish people they don\u2019t like it. Jewish people in general are not fighter, unless you go in\nIsrael and they did what they did. And this is why I always felt very secure, and when I was with\nmy godfather in Switzerland, I did like to have this gun close to me. But it was very hard for me\nto explain to him why. I always felt like if anything happened, maybe I\u2019m going to die, but I\u2019m\n29\ngoing to defend myself. I don\u2019t want to die like a poor animal. I want to die, but before I\u2019m\ngoing to die, somebody else is going to die, too. It was my feeling since a long time. I was in\nvery big contradiction with my brothers, but something I have to say... even I knew my father\nvery little, my father used to carry all the time a gun. I didn\u2019t know why and I couldn\u2019t ask the\nquestion, because I don\u2019t think he would answer, but this is something I remember. And maybe\nit\u2019s because of this I always... But basically in my mind I think the reason I always like gun is\nbecause gun, you can defend yourself, without a gun, you dead.",
        "Q: Did your father carry a gun before the war, too?",
        "A: Yeah, absolutely, yeah.",
        "Q: So that meant when you saw your mother with a gun it wasn\u2019t so unusual, because you had\nalready seen your father with a gun and it was something you were used to having around.",
        "A: Exactly. Because my mother never touch gun before. I never saw, before the war, my mother\nwith a gun. But when I saw her with a gun, it makes sense to me. From where we come... it\u2019s\nfunny because we were four, five brother and we were so different. The only one I know the\nbest is the one who stay alive now. And he is so different, like I said in the tape before and he\u2019s\nnot a fighter. He\u2019s a good man. He\u2019s not a fighter, and the only reason he came back is because\nhe was lucky. And you can... you know, in front of so many SS or Nazi in the camp, you don\u2019t\nhave a... 1f they decide to kill you, they will kill you anytime they want. So when he came back,\nhe came back because he was lucky. But my brother was not a fighter and I am a fighter. Like I\ntold him many time, if I was in a camp, if they took me in Auschwitz, I wouldn\u2019t survive an\nhour. They would kill me right away. But the same idea, they would kill me, but I would kill\nsomebody before I die.",
        "Q: Do you ever feel critical of those who didn\u2019t struggle enough? There\u2019s been a lot a criticism of\nJews during the Holocaust, that they didn\u2019t struggle enough.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s always... was bad feeling for me, to see, like when in Paris they put together all the\nJew in one big field, closed completely. It was hard for me later, to understand why they didn\u2019t\ndo something. Why didn\u2019t they organize? The only time they organized themselves and most of\nthem time it was Polish Jew, it was in the ghetto of Warsaw. This is where they organize, they\nfight, because they say die for die. We going to fight. But in France, no, because again we come\nback to the same idea, all the Jewish people from France said, \u201cI\u2019m not Jewish, I\u2019m French,\nJewish is my religion,\u201d which was true on the basic. But the German said, \u201cNo, you Jew.\nFrench Jew, German Jew, Italian Jew, you are Jew, you have to die.\u201d",
        "Q: And along those lines, you also mentioned last time that before the war and maybe during the\nwar too, you thought of yourself that way, as a French person and then as a Jew. And I\u2019m\nwondering when that switched that you really felt like, no I\u2019m not French, I\u2019m Jewish?",
        "A: Well, everything changed when I saw they arrest everybody, young, old people. And they arrest\nthem just because they were Jew. And to me it didn\u2019t make any sense. This is when I start to\nrealize, I\u2019m not French, I\u2019m not American, I\u2019m not Russian, I\u2019m Jew. This 1s the only reason.\n30\nI\u2019m born Jew, so they want to kill me, that\u2019s all. Like I told you before, look up to this day, what\nhappened last week. This guy, who did go in California and kill Jew just because he doesn\u2019t like\nJew. And this is when I said to the American Jew, maybe you are an American, but before\neverything you are Jewish. And they are going to kill you, not because you are an American,\nbecause you are Jew.",
        "Q: Have you ever gotten into trouble with any people, with any American Jews by telling them that?\nI mean you have a very strong opinion about it and some people might have strong... Do you\never get into arguments?",
        "A: Oh yeah, all the time, all the time, because number one, I don\u2019t go to the synagogue. I don\u2019t go\nto the Temple. I, like I say to a lot of Jew, I\u2019m Jewish by tradition. I\u2019m not Jew by religion.\nAnd when we speak about, I mean the way the Jewish people are here, they make it easy for\nthem. They separate the traditional Jew, the Reformed Jew, and for me this make less sense than\nthe rest of it. But sure, they don\u2019t... when I arrive here in the beginning, I did go to the\nsynagogue to explain what was life in Europe. And a lot of people were laughing because they\nthought I was telling story. So, I quit going and they ask me why I don\u2019t join synagogue. And I\nsaid, I never join synagogue in France, why should I join a synagogue here on top of this? This\nfor me is not a synagogue. This is ajoke. You know, Saturdays is the Shabbat. Saturday Jewish\npeople don\u2019t touch money, so we hire Catholic people to play the music, to clean the place,\nbecause we cannot work, because we cannot sing, it\u2019s against the law of the Jewish Torah. It\ndoesn\u2019t make sense.",
        "Q: And when you said that people here, when you talked about your time in Europe and they\nthought you were telling stories, were you talking about the Holocaust years or afterwards?",
        "A: Holocaust, the way they arrest us, the way, even up to this day, you don\u2019t say you\u2019re Jewish.\nWell, my name is Pressman, Pressman in France is Jewish. Goldman, Pellman, this is Jewish.\nPeople ask me, well Pressman is German? I say no, this is a Jewish name. But we have to be\ncareful even up to this day. And I don\u2019t speak about Germany. If you go to Germany and your\nname is Pressman, they don\u2019t speak to you. And a lot of people said to me when I was in\nEurope, they say, \u201cOh, this is finished.\u201d And one day, a guy did go to Germany, Jewish man and\nhe said openly to people, you know, \u201cI\u2019m Jewish.\u201d Nobody talked to him after all. They didn\u2019t\nwant to have anything to do with him. Anti-Semitism in Germany 1s as strong as it 1s now as it\nwas before, the same way.",
        "Q: We left off last time where the war had ended and you went back from Switzerland to Paris and\nyou rejoined you mother and your brother, Gaston, and eventually your other brother, Bernard.\nAnd you didn\u2019t have time to tell in detail about what happened from there. So, but you did\nmention briefly that you moved into your aunt\u2019s apartment, who had been killed at Auschwitz.\nCan you talk about those, trying to reconstruct your and rebuild your life together in those few\nmonths after the war, in Paris?",
        "A: Well we came back, we got together... This is where, like I told you the last time, my brother, we\nfound out he came back from Auschwitz. So, he was alive. And we got the apartment, which\nwas a very small apartment. It was a two room apartment for my aunt. And we did go in and we\n31\nstart to try to get back the apartment we used to have before we left. And we got it back. My\nfather was an upholsterer and he did have a factory, very small, but a little factory. We got it\nback, too.",
        "Q: What was the name of it? Sorry to interrupt.",
        "A: You mean...?",
        "Q: The factory that your father owned.",
        "A: His name was Joseph Pressman, underneath it was Tapissier. Upholsterer. And it was in the\nsame street where we did have this apartment. So my brother, who came from Auschwitz, who\ndid have a lot of training with my father, did reopen this and start to work again. And I was\nthirteen years old and I did go back to school, college. And when I graduate from college, my\nbrother wants for me to go and work with him on the . And I said, \u201cNo, I\nwant to study medicine.\u201d This was the joke of the day, because why should I become a doctor?\nWhat... so, my brother, like I said, is a nice man, tried to help me as much as he could. And he\nhelped me, but basically the whole family, cut a little bit between them and I, because what I\nwould like to do, it was silly. For them it didn\u2019t make any sense. The only time they realize it\nwas true, is when I graduate from medical school. And they said, \u201cWell, he did it, with no help.\u201d\nI was working at night, and I was doing a lot of job. And during the day I did go to medical\nschool. And when I graduate, everybody was very happy and we celebrate. And meantime\nbefore I graduate, I got married with a Catholic girl, not Jewish. This didn\u2019t help mine relation\nwith my family. I got a little girl at the time and I was twenty-three years old. And I raised my\nlittle girl. I did have, like I said, a lot of job, but I was making a good living. And when it was, I\nthink it was, I practice for about three, four year in Paris and I decide I want to learn about the\nmechanic of the body. And this is where I came and find out about United State and Harvard, it\nwas a special course for the mechanic of the body. And I came by myself for two or three\nweeks. And this is where I found out, somebody told me about chiropractic. So, I did go to\nDavenport, Iowa, where I saw what was chiropractic. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t have any idea.\nAnd the first time I saw about chiropractic, I said \u201cThose people are crazy. Doesn\u2019t make any\nsense,\u201d you know, the spine, give an adjustment. And before I left they give me a book, which I\nhave even up to this day. And I did go back to France, read the book and I said, \u201cGosh, this\nmakes sense to me.\u201d So, I pack up all my thing, took my wife and daughter and came to the\nUnited State and did go to Davenport, Iowa, where they give me credit. And I study\nchiropractic, graduate in 1962. And came back to France in Paris and opened an office in Paris.\nAnd I start to practice medicine and chiropractic.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s slow down, because I want to get some more details about just the time immediately after\nthe war before we go on. Was it, so you were staying in your aunt\u2019s house for just a little while\nbefore you moved? Is that right?",
        "A: Maybe I would say a couple year, or maybe less. But it was not long. It was very hard to live,\nthree men and my mother in a two room. It was...\n32",
        "Q: And were you surrounded by your aunt\u2019s things, who had been killed? That must have been\nStrange.",
        "A: No, nothing was left. They, you know, people stole everything. No, it was nothing inside.",
        "Q: How did you feel as a Jewish person, survivor of the Holocaust, living in Paris immediately after\nthe war?",
        "A: It was a inside revolution on me, but I, \u2019m, how can I say? I\u2019m very mean, if I want to, or I can\nignore everything if I want to. And I thought I didn\u2019t want to be the fighter against the... like\nDon Quixote. And I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to bring me nothing. I better build my life, chose what\nI want to do and just go on.\u201d For the time being after the war, there were no danger anymore.\nSo I didn\u2019t think about the Holocaust, all the dead, why they die, how they die. Because of my\nbrother I knew a lot of things from inside. But I did try to be in a neutral position. I didn\u2019t want\nfor this to affect me. I registered the whole thing, but I put this aside and say I will bring it back\nwhen the time is going to be there. I don\u2019t know how other people do, but this was my way of\ndoing. So, I\u2019m not going to be bitter. I\u2019m not going to be all the time hungry, not hungry, angry.",
        "Q: Angry?",
        "A: Mad. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think... I didn\u2019t want to forgive. At this time I didn\u2019t know the technique\nof forgiving. But I knew it was something I can do about this, but I was not ready to do it,\nbecause I didn\u2019t know what to do and how to do it. And like I said, my brother give us a lot of\ninformation, what happen to the camp. They was some fight, not fight, but my brother said a lot\nof secret things from the camp. And one day, my mother did repeat something he asked her not\nto speak about to anybody. And a group of attorney call my brother to ask him, did he say this?\nAnd my brother said, \u201cYes, but I want to know how do you know?\u201d And they found out and\nthey say the truth, \u201cYour mother said it.\u201d And I was there when he came back and he say to my\nmother, I ever going to speak to you anymore about this, and if we have to go to court because of\nwhat I told you, I will deny everything. And I\u2019m going to tell you, you a liar. Because what\nhappened in camp, have nothing to do with this world. I told you this because you my mother,\nbut I don\u2019t try to... he said, \u201cI don\u2019t try to protect anybody. But you cannot judge us.\u201d And\nhmmm, to me it makes sense.",
        "Q: What was it that he told her? Do you know?",
        "A: It was... it was something bad, because the guy was alive. And... and I mean, he survived, he\ndid something very... you know, a piece of bread in camp 1s a question of life or death. And\nwhen you say this now, what is a piece of bread? Well, you got this piece of bread, you survive.\nYou don\u2019t have this piece of bread, you die. So, who are you people, to judge us, because\nsomebody stole a piece of bread off of somebody who was dying? Any way he will die. So the\nguy... and nobody said anything. And he explained this to my mother, but she shouldn\u2019t repeat\nthis thing. Because... and this was a little thing, you know... I mean...",
        "Q: So, the lawyers got involved because... why? Why did the lawyers get involved?\n33",
        "A: Because it was Jewish lawyer and most of them came back from Auschwitz, but they been in\nAuschwitz for maximum a year, which was nothing. But when they came back, you know, they\nwant to show, \u201cWe are lawyer, now we going to judge people who were mean, bad in camp.\u201d\nBecause if you know the story about the camp, the German, the SS were very, very few. Let\u2019s\nsay in a camp of two thousand Jew, there were fifteen SS in uniform and they give order. They\nsay, \u201cYou are the Kapo of this room. There is two hundred people here. You are responsible.\u201d\nYou say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u2019\u2014Boom. \u201cYou are going to be the Kapo, you don\u2019t want to be... so\nyou are responsible of this two hundred people. Tomorrow morning I want ten Jew on the floor\ndead. I don\u2019t care the way you do it.\u201d So.",
        "Q: Did you have, did your relationship with your brother Bernard change very much after the war,\nafter he had been through these experiences in Auschwitz?",
        "A: No, it didn\u2019t change because I didn\u2019t know him very well. He\u2019s much, I mean, you know, he\u2019s\nolder than I. I didn\u2019t have, until I think it was two years ago, he got an interview in Paris from a\nFrench television. And he give me a tape and I came here and I listen to the tape and I was so\nsurprised. I thought I knew my brother, but I didn\u2019t know him. And I don\u2019t judge him, but we\nare so different. He takes things one way. I told him one day, \u201cI think you are a Buddhist.\u201d And\nhe said, \u201cWhy?\u201d I say, \u201cBecause Buddhist is not a religion, it 1s a way of life. And Buddhist\nlook on the floor and behind what he see on the floor and the rest he doesn\u2019t see. The only thing\nis what is on the floor, that\u2019s all. And this is why you survive.\u201d Because the tape he was doing,\nthe interview he did on the French television, I thought to myself, we didn\u2019t live with the same\nparent. It was, you know, he was telling, we did have a normal life. Sure, we felt anti-Semitism\naround us, but it was not so bad. And I said to myself, we didn\u2019t lead the same life. We didn\u2019t\ngo to the same school and we didn\u2019t see the same thing. So, I did go see friend of our age, my\nage, his age, and I ask question. He said, \u201cNo, your brother is different. He\u2019s a very sweet guy.\nHe\u2019s a good man, but he see things completely different.\u201d I spend my Christmas with him, the\nlast Christmas, \u201898, \u201899. And I did something. I spoke with him for an hour and I trying to\nexplain to him, how, what is technique of forgiveness. He was mad. He was so mad. And I\nsaid, \u201cUnderstand, forgiveness is not to forgive what they did, it\u2019s just to save yourself. When\nyou forgive them, at least you can breathe a little bit. Right now, every night you cry, you\nscream, because you are in the camp now. If you forgive, let them worry about their problem,\nbut get rid of it.\u201d What did I say? So, he send me, even two weeks ago he send me a book I\ncouldn\u2019t find here. And it is in French. I like to read in French. And on the side he wrote, \u201cTry\nto understand why I cannot forgive.\u201d We have two different way of thinking and until the last\nminute of his life he is going to cry and be mad, but he doesn\u2019t want to. He doesn\u2019t want to help\nhimself. This is his life.\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\n34\nTape 3, Side B",
        "Q: Okay, this is tape three, side B. When you say the technique of forgiveness and learning about\nthe technique of forgiveness, what do you mean?",
        "A: When I was in France, on my spare time when I was a student of medicine, I learn hypnosis. I\nwas very interested in hypnosis. I put a lady through surgery under hypnosis. And you have a\nlot of technique. And mainly this technique of forgiveness, which I didn\u2019t know before and I\nwas very happy to learn and practice this first on me. Every time I was mad at somebody or\nthings I didn\u2019t like, I did try to forgive the people I was speaking, I mean not openly, but in my\nmind. And this way it was easy for me to be able to discuss with people. Some people have a\nnatural way of being patient. I\u2019m not patient, so I did want to find something who is not going to\nmake me patient, but make me a normal human being. And those technique of forgiveness 1s\nso... we hear this in the Catholic religion. Forgive and God will forgive you. I always say to a\nlot of people, I don\u2019t need any church because if I have a problem, I speak with God directly. It\nis fifty percent joke and fifty percent true, it goes together. Because another human being like\nme, ah, how intelligent he can be? What can he do with God, I cannot do directly if I want to do\nit? And this forgiveness came back to me. And one day I was in a course of hypnosis and the\nteacher said, \u201cToday we\u2019re going to speak only about forgiveness.\u201d And I thought, God, this is\ngreat, and I learned every bit of it. And I practice this with me and with my patient. And it was\nwonderful, because people used to say, \u201cI didn\u2019t think this way before, but now it make it so\neasy.\u201d And I thought to myself, I know, because I practice the same way for myself. The more I\ncan forgive things, easy my life is, and I come back always to the point zero. If you let, 1f you do\na mistake and you go too far with this mistake, it\u2019s very... longer you keep with, harder it is to\ncome back. So, try to rectify the mistake as soon as you can, so this way it\u2019s going to be much\neasier to work on it and it\u2019s going to be quicker. So they teach you every time at night before\nyou, when you go to bed, before you go to sleep, try to go very fast on your day and say, \u201cOkay\nwhat happened today? What did I do that was not good?\u201d So you try to forget yourself by being\nsorry and said \u201cI\u2019m not going to do this any more. I\u2019m going to try to be better,\u201d and also vice\nand versa, one way or another way. It\u2019s amazing the way it works. It\u2019s something very simple.\nThe only thing is, if you are willing to do it, it\u2019s perfect. If you don\u2019t want to do it, it\u2019s very hard.\nAnd this is why, I try. I stay about two weeks with my brother. I said, \u201cBernard, I\u2019m sorry.\nYou\u2019re going to be mad, if you want to throw me out from your house, you do it. But every day\nI\u2019m going to speak to you about forgiveness, because this is your only savior.\u201d But he laugh, he\nbecame red sometime, he left the room, he took witness, friend. Okay, he took friend who\nthought like him. And you know, if you ask a friend, after all the story of the camp, he survive\nand he say, \u201cBloing (ph), face to face, can I forgive this?\u201d People say, \u201cNo.\u201d But this is not\nwhat I ask him. I don\u2019t ask him to forgive this way. I want for him to forgive them their fault,\nthey are the worst people. He is not a bad man. So forgive them for what they did to them and\nto you. But it was... I don\u2019t think... maybe I put a little something on the ground, but for him it\nis too late. And I think, it\u2019s not nice what I\u2019m going to say, but I think also he enjoy a little bit\nhis situation.",
        "Q: Enjoys being angry?\n35",
        "A: No. He enjoy to be, people feel sorry for him. And he likes this. I think so. But there 1s a lot of\npoint I cannot clarify with him, because I don\u2019t want to be pushy. And he\u2019s not going to tell me\nanyway, because at the same time with him, Maurice was with him. And Maurice die when they\nwere in Auschwitz. So...",
        "Q: Does he feel guilty about that?",
        "A: We cannot speak about that, so I cannot be pushy, because... The only thing I know, the only\nlittle thing, and he cannot hide this, because he said it. You know, when you say something, it\u2019s\nvery hard to retract. When they arrive in Auschwitz, I don\u2019t remember the date, but they shave\nevery man and woman. And they put them in a big room. And it was not very light, it was very\ndark. And one moment he was walking and he turn around and he sees this guy on his back all\nthe time. And he say, \u201cWhy do you follow me all the time like this?\u201d And he said, \u201cBut I\u2019m\nMaurice, I\u2019m your brother.\u201d He didn\u2019t recognize him. He was... and for me, my interpretation\nis, he was already gone. He put a wall. Not because... because the situation. He said, \u201cOkay,\nsave your life. I save mine.\u201d This is the way I felt it and this is the way I understood. Maybe\nI\u2019m wrong. I don\u2019t know. But this is the way I feel it. Because in any situation if you don\u2019t\nrecognize your brother, your sister, your mother, it\u2019s like what I said before. Looks on the floor,\n\u201cEverything here is mine, after this, I have nothing to do with it.\u201d",
        "Q: Was it difficult for you to... you talked about how empowering it was to learn this technique of\nforgiveness. Was it really difficult to get to that point where you\u2019re forgiving not only people\nwithin your own life, but applying it to this larger situation of the Holocaust?",
        "A: Even... even now it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s not... it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not easy to forgive. You can forgive\nlittle things. But when it becomes so important, it\u2019s not easy. Because you have to visualize,\nand I\u2019m good, I know how to visualize. And when you see the whole picture... a month ago I\nread about this man in United State, who help people to die. I don\u2019t remember his name.\nCavajohn, something like this.",
        "Q: Kevorkian.",
        "A: Kevorkian. Somebody ask him, doesn\u2019t he feel like a Nazi by doing this. And I don\u2019t judge. I\ndon\u2019t judge him. This would be another discussion. But they ask him, he doesn\u2019t feel like a\nNazi? And he said, \u201cWhat the Nazi did to the Jewish people did help other people after the war.\u201d\nMeaning I don\u2019t like what the medicine does with rats, with animal, the experience they do,\nbecause I don\u2019t agree on this. But when you judge human being to do experience like rat, there\nis no end. I don\u2019t know why he said this and what is the basic idea. Maybe one day I am going\nto have the chance to speak with him. But what did he mean by this? In Germany, Der Spiegel\ndid an article of a doctor, who was a doctor in the camp Auschwitz. He\u2019s alive now. They made\nan interview and they asked the question, \u201cDo you feel guilty about what you did?\u201d Because\nthey did horrible experience. And he said, \u201cNo, I did my job.\u201d And people said, \u201cWhat do you\nmean by your job?\u201d He said, \u201cI was military. They put me in a camp, but I save a lot of Jew. I\nkill a lot, but I save a lot. And everything we did, helped for this generation.\u201d So, the question\nis, is he guilty? Is he not guilty? He sleeps every day. He doesn\u2019t have any problem. Is a\n36\nnormal human being able to sleep after killing healthy children, woman and man? It\u2019s a big\nquestion.",
        "Q: Do you have any answers for it?",
        "A: No, no, no. Because I found out 1n any case, it\u2019s very hard to put yourself in somebody else\nbody on a case like this. What would I do, if as a Jewish doctor, put him in a camp. What would\nI do? What road would I take? I don\u2019t know. I want to survive? \u2014Maybe. I don\u2019t want to\nsurvive like a killer, I die. But what would be my position? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have any idea.\nIt\u2019s hard.",
        "Q: Do you remember when you first realized that you had a deep interest in medicine?",
        "A: From long time, when I was nine years old, I was very interested of the... and I won\u2019t say to save\npeople, but just of the science of medicine, of the human being. I\u2019m, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m such a\ngood man to say it was to save people. I don\u2019t think so. But I was interested on how the body is\nmade, why does the body react the way it is? And this is why I did go to acupuncture, because\nacupuncture made me discover a lot of things I didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Do you remember any significant moments when you realized that? Something that happened to\nyou that made you say, \u201cAh, I really want to study this\u2019?",
        "A: No, no, because I\u2019m a bad student. So every time you said the word when I was young, about\nstudying, go to school and buy book and read book... I said, \u201cOh, \u2019'm not going to do it.\u201d But I\ndid it because I was interested on medicine. But I was not interested on... my average, medical\nschool, every school I did go was between seventy-eight and eighty. I never made a hundred.",
        "Q: When did you, so in the time after the war when you were in France and you were attending\nschool again, did you have the... how long did it take before you had the idea that you wanted to\nbecome a doctor and do you remember how that happened?",
        "A: Like I said, I was nine years old when I said, I will be a doctor. And all my path was on this\ndirection. But you know, when you are nine years old... I have a patient, who came, a woman,\ncame with a little boy. And very, very wealthy people. It was in Paris. And the boy was maybe\nfive or six years old. And I said, \u201cWhat do you want to become when you are to be older?\u201d And\nhe said, \u201cI want to drive a garbage truck.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy a garbage truck?\u201d And he gave me\na good, very interesting explanation. And much later, I found out he was driving a garbage\ntruck. He was eighteen, nineteen. Sometime you don\u2019t know what drives you, why you want to\ndo something and this is when I say God is so strong. Because sometimes God say, he wants to\nbe a garbage driver, let it be. And he open every door he can. And the guy is very happy. We\nneed people drive truck, drive garbage truck. We need fire people. We need policemen. So,\nwhy not? The funny part is, every time I... I used to take anybody who wants to have hypnosis,\nthey want to know what they were in another life. Because everybody think they were king,\nqueen, princess, you know? But I said to the people, \u201cYou know, there was a few King, but the\nmajority were people working. Why don\u2019t you think you\u2019d be a normal human body working to\nmake a living? You have more people who make eighteen, twenty thousand a year in United\n37\nState than people who make a hundred fifty thousand. But in another life, you want to be the one\nwho make a hundred and fifty thousand?\u201d [Laughing. |",
        "Q: What was it... have you always believed in God?",
        "A: Always, always. God was always there with me. I have to, I have to be very, very honest. And\nif he didn\u2019t have the time, he send me somebody to help me. So I never, never worry about, and\neven now, dying. Dying for me is anormal end. The same way when you believe in\nreincarnation, you know what is to be born again. And in the same time, when the time comes,\nit\u2019s the end. And say, I don\u2019t know the word in English... wise Indian, native from United State,\nthey know exactly when they are going to die. They say good-bye to all the family. They go to\nthe mountain, they pray God and they die. The family come the day or two days after, take the\nbody and burn it, because this is the ritual. Now, people said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201d Why? If it\nis the time, it\u2019s the time. You got a ticket in your pocket. You have your date of birth and you\nhave a blank. The blank is when you die. Okay, suddenly the date goes on, it\u2019s this day. And\ngo on. [Laughing. |",
        "Q: Can you describe your... this 1s going to be a difficult question, I think. Can you describe what\nyou think of when you think of God? What do you think when you say, I\u2019ve always believed in\nGod? What does God represent to you? What does it mean?",
        "A: Very complicated to say. Some time, some time to make it easy on me, it\u2019s a body. I speak with\nsomebody, but sometime when I sleep... this is the real one, the real McCoy, because it comes\nlike a voice. And in the morning, it happened to me not long time ago, I don\u2019t know if it was a\ndream or did I see it, did I wake up? It\u2019s very, very funny, but one thing I can tell you, it\u2019s very\ncomforting. I mean, I never been scared. I never been afraid because I heard something or I saw\nsomething. Lately, lately, I live alone here, lately I see things passing. Or I\u2019m in the kitchen and\nI see a blur of something. Pfft. So, I say to myself jokingly, maybe soon it\u2019s my time. And it\u2019s\npossible. And it\u2019s going to come. So, now, later... but it\u2019s funny, because lately I see, maybe\nyou are going in a few month or a few weeks, you\u2019re going to hear, \u201cWell, he pass away.\u201d You\ngot this on your tape saying, \u201cWell, he spoke about it.\u201d And it\u2019s nothing to be scared of it.\nWhen come the time, come the time. You know people die forty years old. I\u2019m sixty-seven. I\ndid have a good life with the good and the bad, but it\u2019s nothing, you know. I don\u2019t want to live\nuntil a hundred and twenty with nothing, with Alzheimer or thinking about how am I going to\nsurvive, or... God is wise, he knows when to tell you to come back. And if medicine 1s strong\nenough to keep you alive, this is ridiculous. When somebody has to go, let him go. The best\nway, but let him go. And when it\u2019s your time, it\u2019s time. It\u2019s nothing to be scared of it. I be\nback. [Laughing. |",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re, tell me if this is right. Your God, your idea of God or your perception of what God is\nmaybe partially comes from your Jewish tradition, but partially comes from your own instinctive\nsense. And then maybe from other religious traditions, too?",
        "A: From the little I know about the Jewish religion, Jewish people, when they die, it\u2019s finished.\nThere is a God, but reincarnation, Jewish people don\u2019t believe in it.\n38",
        "Q: Except for Hasidic Jews. And I don\u2019t know if modern Hasidic Jews do.",
        "A: But the old basic religion, when you die, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s finished. I don\u2019t think this come from the\nJewish religion. On top of this, I don\u2019t have any training with the Torah. Never read the Torah.\nNever read the Talmud. I don\u2019t have any knowledge about the Jewish religion, neither from any\nother religion. Everything is by feeling. And God is always present. When you do good thing.\nWhen you do bad things. Sometimes it\u2019s a little bit annoying to have this presence with you.\nWhen, when you have sex, you want to be alone. [Laughing.] You don\u2019t want to have\nsomebody who look over your shoulder, but 1t goes with the price. But yes, I have a relation\nmostly constantly. I\u2019m not going to, you\u2019re not going to see me in the streets screaming \u201cI saw\nGod!\u201d No. But I have a feeling. I have this feeling. It\u2019s very comfortable. It makes sense to\nme, and it\u2019s very helpful. Because if I go back from my childhood until now, God was very\ngood with me, because he never let me down. I never got, I've been depressed like a lot of\npeople, but I got something who just come back in there, \u201cHey Paul, get up, that\u2019s it.\u201d And it\u2019s\ntrue. I can have a few bad days and after this the sun comes back and everything is okay. So,\nI\u2019ve been very lucky, I mean spiritually. And I don\u2019t want to say this too much... I did have,\nwhen I was in France, I did have a lot of priest coming in my office. The reason is, my wife\nbrother was a monk and he send me a lot of people, because I did have a lot of success. And if\nyou want me, I can tell you a short story. One of mine patient was from Paris and his brother\nwas a monsignor in Rome. He said, \u201cYou think this guy, you know, this doctor, can help me?\u201d\nHe was in bad, bad shape. And his brother, who lives in Paris said, \u201cLet me ask him.\u201d So, the\nmonsignor calls me and he said, \u201cIf I send you the plane from the Pope and I pay all the expense\nand you tell me your price, would you come for a weekend at the Vatican?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes,\nbut you have to remember one thing, I\u2019m born from Jewish parent.\u201d He said, \u201cGod is Jewish.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cIf you take it this way, any time you want, any weekend.\u201d So, he send me a plane and did\ngo there, took care of him. And he show me my room and on the top of, above the bed was the\nChrist. And I said, \u201cYou have to take this out, because, you know, as Jewish, you tell me I kill\nhim and trust me, I didn\u2019t kill him. And I don\u2019t think Jewish people did.\u201d So, he took it away.\nWe did have wonderful discussion. And when I came back, you know, he was very, very happy.\nWe spend beautiful hour of discussion. And he said, \u201cIf one day you have the vocation and\nGod...\u201d because we spoke about God and I told him my relation with God. And he say, \u201cIf God\nask you to become a Catholic, would you accept?\u201d And I said, \u201cIf God ask me, yes I will. But\nMonsignor, I\u2019m going to tell you one thing, maybe it\u2019s going to be a Catholic, one more\nCatholic, but I will be Jew for the rest of my life.\u201d And he said, \u201cI think so.\u201d [Laughing. |",
        "Q: How did you gain such a reputation for your practice?",
        "A: I think it\u2019s mouth, people... I did have all kind of people come in my office. Movie actor, little\npeople, farmer brought me a chicken in a piece of paper in a Paris, in an office right in\nMadeleine, which 1s the best office you can find. They brought me cognac they did by\nthemselves, like you call here moonshine. I did have all kind of people. And I will tell you the\ntruth, if you stay with me here in my office when I\u2019m working, you\u2019ll see all kind of people\ncome in here. Policemen, firemen, fire people, ninety-seven-year-old lady, ninety-two, this lady\ncomes every two weeks. She\u2019s ninety-two. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who keep me on my\nfeet.

And the basic, even the way they practice medicine here in the United State, it\u2019s not\nworse and it\u2019s not better than any place else. When a guy put a stethoscope around his neck, his\nwhole personality change. It\u2019s like a cop, when he put on a uniform, he\u2019s completely different.\nTake his uniform out, take his stethoscope out, take him out of the hospital... I know doctor, you\ncan see them in the street and you want to give them a penny to go buy a coke...\nEnd of Tape 3, Side B\n40\nTape 4, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number four, side A. Say it again.",
        "A: The most important is the people ego, who is important. It\u2019s like being the president of United\nState, if you didn\u2019t have the big ego, who wants to be president of United State. But doctor with\nbig ego are completely different. They are not human.",
        "Q: So, did you learn anything that you found really useful in medical school?",
        "A: Oh, yes, the basic, I mean you have to... it\u2019s like, I like to play music and the best way to learn 1s\nto learn classic. And after this, you can play any kind of instrument you want because classical\nis so complete, so hard. You want to play Jazz? No problem. You want to play song? No\nproblem. Medicine, you have to learn the basic. If you know how the machine works, you can\ndo what you want after this. What I don\u2019t like too much in medicine, when people specialize.\nYou know, you specialize on one thing and you do one thing only and you speak to this doctor\nabout something else, he doesn\u2019t know. I do only stomach. If you have a problem with your\nstomach, I know everything about stomach. But the problem is, in the body, the stomach is part\nof the body. Maybe the stomach doesn\u2019t work, and this is why I did go in chiropractic. Because\nwith chiropractic I can do more than give medicine. And with acupuncture and chiropractic, I\ncan do again more, because I can reach from every corner. And this is why I feel much more\nsecure with what I know now than when I graduate from medical school, which I didn\u2019t know\nnothing.",
        "Q: And when you said, you talked a little bit about, about your, the word of mouth that went around\nand that you gained a reputation. What was it that you were good at? What was your particular\naptitude?",
        "A: Patient likes to come in front of a guy, who have the time to listen, to sit down and say, \u201cWhat is\nyour problem?\u201d And because I know all those little thing, I know what kind of question to ask.\nYou know? If you tell me your problem and you go in some space in your body, I don\u2019t want to\nknow for many reasons, I want to be more specific. I bring you back to the point, I want for you\nto be specific. So, I can go there much easier than you said, \u201cWell, I have headache. I\u2019m very\nconstipated. When I get my period...\u201d and I\u2019m confused. And when you confuse a doctor, he\ndoes nothing. But when the doctor knows how to direct you: \u201cOkay, you have this, let\u2019s\nemphasize on this place. When do you have this pain? Where do you have this pain? From\nwhere does it come? What time of the day? How many time a week do you have this?\u201d So, you\ncan bring all this to one thing. I put this with my knowledge of... I know if I\u2019m going to put\nneedle or I\u2019m going to adjust your spine or I\u2019m going to give you some light, natural medication\nor the three of it at the same time. And people said, \u201cBut it\u2019s a miracle.\u201d No, it\u2019s not a miracle.\nIt\u2019s knowledge. And this is the way I treat you, not because it\u2019s you, it\u2019s because I treat\neverybody the same way. I would treat my brother the same way, my wife the same way and\nyou the same way. You don\u2019t like the way I do, go see somebody else. But this is my way of\ndoing. If you came to see me, it\u2019s because until now you didn\u2019t have any success with any\ndoctor. So, give me a chance.\n4]",
        "Q: You talked about when you started to discover chiropractic medicine. What exactly was it that\ncaptured your interest?",
        "A: Chiropractic? Chiropractic is based on nerve pressure. Everything come from the brain. Mine\nbasic idea of psychosomatic is so strong. You can help yourself or you can destroy yourself.\nThere\u2019s a doctor, I saw this on 20/20 not long time ago. There\u2019s a doctor, he must be around\nsixty-five years old in New York. And he take care of any, any low back pain with a hundred\npercent success just by explaining thing for twenty minutes to the patient. And I was listening\nto, I didn\u2019t hear what he was saying for the twenty minute, but I understood the concept, and it\nmakes sense. And he is in a hospital and all the other doctor laugh at him, but he\u2019s got a hundred\npercent success, because he teach you how to say when you wake up in the morning and you\nhave pain on your back, and you say, \u201cOh honey, I think I\u2019m not going to be able to go to work.\nMy pain kills me and it\u2019s going to be a horrible day.\u201d And if I can teach you how to speak to\nyour back\u2014and this is what he does\u2014sure it\u2019s going to be hard to start, but little by little the\npain is going to go away. Everything, almost, is psychosomatic. Cancer, and I don\u2019t speak about\nHIV and sickness like this, which is acquired. This is different. But I mean any, anything inside\nof your body is psychosomatic. You can make it worse or you can make it better. And if\nsomebody for any reason, you have a baby, find a doctor who is going to be with you all the\ntime. And if you have any problem, you be able to give him a call and said, \u201cI feel this and this,\u201d\nand he should have an answer to tell you. \u201cIt\u2019s normal because of this or this or this, think this\nway and you'll feel better.\u201d\u201d You have to have a dialogue. The doctor is here to help you, to help\nyour psychic. Everything is almost 99.5 percent psychosomatic. And if the doctor understand\nthis and can direct you... You know a lot of people come to acupuncture and said, \u201cI hate\nneedle.\u201d And I said, \u201cIf I tell you, you are not going to feel it.\u201d Okay, I can tell this until\ntomorrow and if I put in a needle and it\u2019s painful, he\u2019s going to say, \u201cYou lied to me. It\u2019s\npainful.\u201d But if the patient is on the table and I said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to put a needle. As soon\nas there is any pain tell me. I take the needle out. But the way, I put the needle and where I put\nthe needle, you shouldn\u2019t feel nothing.\u201d 99 percent people say, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel it.\u201d This is one\nform of hypnosis: to do acupuncture. \u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d Patient who come bent and\nthey have low back pain. Put them on the table, start to massage a little bit the back and speak to\nthem, tell them about vacation. What do you like, flying, thing like this. I adjust them, if I didn\u2019t\nspeak to them, I couldn\u2019t touch them. You touch them a little bit: \u201cOh, it\u2019s painful.\u201d You put a\nlittle bit under hypnosis and give an adjustment and that\u2019s it. And the patient goes away. It\nlooks simple the way I explain, but this is the way it goes. It\u2019s very simple. Unless I play the\ndoctor, \u201cYou lay down here. I\u2019m going to adjust you. It\u2019s going to be painful, but you have\nnothing for nothing. You have to suffer.\u201d They say, \u201cJust a minute, let me think about.\u201d It\u2019s\npsychosomatic, I mean, everything is in your head. \u201cI\u2019m going to adjust you, but I don\u2019t know if\nI going to help you.\u201d \u201cWell, so don\u2019t touch me. [Laughing.] Leave me alone.\u201d",
        "Q: You\u2019re studying, you\u2019re in medical school studying western medicine which has a very different\napproach than the one you\u2019re describing right now. Was that difficult for you? That you have a\nvery unconventional approach?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have any problem for one reason. I know God is going to put me in the right way, when\nit is the time. So I was not worried. And this is something else very important: is not to be rush\nby things. Everything is going to be in time. When I was very young, I want it now. And every\n42\ntime I did this, they spank me. \u201cWhy did you spank me?\u201d \u201cBecause you are too nervous, take\nyour time. You\u2019re going to get it. Justa minute. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d And this was hard, but you\nlearn. It\u2019s always the same. My father used to tell a story when he was in Russia. He said, a\nguy did have a horse and it cost him a lot of money to feed him. So, little by little this farmer\nstart to feed him less and less and less, until one day he died, the horse. And the farmer said,\n\u201cThis 1s too bad. Just the day he was used to not to eat, he die.\u201d And for me is the same thing.\nWhen I\u2019m going to be almost perfect, \u2019'm going to go away. Waste of time? No, it\u2019s not a waste\nof time, because it\u2019s going to serve me for my next... my teacher of acupuncture in China told\nme, \u201cPaul, it\u2019s your first life as an acupuncturist. You okay, but you not wonderful. You need\nfour life of acupuncture. The fourth life, you\u2019re going to be perfect. And this is going to be the\ntime, probably, you going to stay there. You don\u2019t come back.\u201d And I said, \u201cIt\u2019s very\nencouraging because I have three more life to go. Okay, let\u2019s do it.\u201d [Laughing. ]",
        "Q: When did you start getting interested in acupuncture?",
        "A: 1965. I got this book, one of the very, very interesting doctor. I don\u2019t know how you call this.\nThere is a group of Catholic doctor and I even don\u2019t remember the name in French. They are in\nblack and white. The robe is black and white. This man is a very famous family. And he\nbecame an M.D. and he want to learn acupuncture, but the only way to learn and write a book\nabout acupuncture, he did have to learn Chinese. So, he became an M.D. for a big family in\nChina. He learned Chinese and he learn acupuncture. And I have his book with me. It was five,\nsix year before I was born. Born in 1932, so it was \u201825, 1925. And he did a complete study of\nacupuncture. And I read this book three time and I said to a lot of people, if this house get in\nfire, the only thing I\u2019m going to save is this book, because it\u2019s got everything in it. And I read\nthe book and I said, \u201cIf I\u2019m lucky maybe one day I\u2019m going to study acupuncture.\u201d And I got a\nchance one day to go to Taiwan and I did go to the school. I start my study, came back with all\nthe books. And since \u201865, let\u2019s say I start to put needle in patient five year later. And I still\nstudy acupuncture and I will study until the rest of my life.",
        "Q: What is it about it that interested you? What did you read in that book, for example?",
        "A: The mystery. Acupuncture is very mysterious. Yesterday my attorney call me for a patient of\nmine. They don\u2019t understand why I adjust the neck of this patient and she\u2019s got a low back pain.\nSo, I say to my attorney, \u201cYou have two way, either you answer the way you want to this\ninsurance company and you say what you want or you sue the company and I won\u2019t charge you a\npenny to go to court. Because if this people think I\u2019m going to speak to them on the telephone\nand explain to them by phone why I adjust the neck to release the pain on the low back, they are\ndreaming. I call you back in ten minute because I am with a patient.\u201d So, I hang up, call him\nten, fifteen minute later and he said, \u201cI call the insurance company, they settle.\u201d I don\u2019t know\nwhat happen. I try to get him before you arrive and he 1s not in his office. But I will know what\nhe said. Because I said, \u201cYou have two way, but I\u2019m not going to speak with this insurance.\u201d\nSometime I\u2019m very obnoxious... how do you call?",
        "Q: Obnoxious.\n43",
        "A: Obnoxious with people who don\u2019t know nothing about medicine and challenge me. If you want\nto challenge me in medicine, put me in front of a bunch of doctor, who are going to understand\nwhat I am talking about. I can tell you anything and you\u2019re going to say, \u201cOh yes, oh yes.\u201d So,\nyou're going to say \u201cWell, this dummy, I don\u2019t understand a word he is saying, but maybe he\u2019s\nright.\u201d By phone? Why do I adjust the neck to a low back pain? An insurance company\u201d?\n[Laughing.] So, this is when I become obnoxious. But acupuncture is very mysterious. Well,\nit\u2019s five thousand year old and it\u2019s amazing. I don\u2019t know how far we can go with acupuncture.\nBut my experience was more than rewarding for me, I mean medically. What I can do with\nacupuncture. It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s amazing. I don\u2019t believe it myself. If somebody else would tell\nme what I know, I would say, prove it to me.",
        "Q: Tell me, give me some examples. What have you been able to do with it?",
        "A: Well, I did go this morning to put teeth and he drill. And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want any shot. Let me\nput a needle, acupuncture needle in, you can do what you want.\u201d And the guy is, he teach\ndentistry here at UK. And he say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay with me.\u201d So, I just put two needle and I said, \u201cGo\nahead.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d And I said, \u201cOh yeah.\u201d So, he drill and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re\nsure you don\u2019t feel anything?\u201d I said, \u201cListen, I\u2019m human. I don\u2019t like pain and if it was painful\nI would have said, \u2018The hell with acupuncture, give me a shot!\u2019 No, I don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d And\nthis is the way itis. I have a young lady, who came and she did have suspicious part of the\nbreast. So she said, \u201cI would love to try...\u201d\u2014because she is a patient of mine of acupuncture\u2014\n\u201cYou said you can anesthetize myself with acupuncture.\u201d And I said, \u201cSure.\u201d So, we did go to\nthe hospital. I prepared the whole thing the normal way and I said, \u201cOkay, you ready?\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cYes.\u201d So, I put needle. And the surgeon came, a little bit smiling. And I said, \u201cOkay,\ncut.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d And I said, \u201cThe lady agree, I agree, go ahead.\u201d He did the\nwhole surgery under acupuncture. She said, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel nothing.\u201d And I was looking, because\nI said, \u201cMy God, if she, if she start to scream, I have to put the mask, give her the gas. And I\u2019m\ngoing to put her down deep.\u201d But she didn\u2019t say anything. Did go to China at Christmas, this\nlast Christmas. And this guy, when I did go see my teacher, he said, \u201cWould you like to see\nsomething interesting?\u201d I said yes. He said, \u201cI\u2019m going to do acupuncture to an open heart\nsurgery.\u201d And I said, \u201cCan I come?\u201d And he said sure. So, we did go. Needle all over, start to\nsee section open, bring the heart, massage. The guy is covered here and the surgeon said, \u201cYou\nokay?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, I\u2019m okay, but\u2019\u201d\u20141it was in Chinese, I didn\u2019t understand\u2014\u201cT would like to\ndrink something.\u201d So, they brought him a straw with orange juice and he drink and he was\ncompletely opened. [Laughing.] It\u2019s very impressive, very, very impressive. So, it\u2019s rewarding\nand I like it.",
        "Q: You said that you lecture a lot and do seminars. On what subjects?",
        "A: Acupuncture, but it\u2019s very basic, because acupuncture in United State is not in a high level.\nThey, I have a lot of article from paper where they say if you have a headache, acupuncture can\nhelp you. If woman have bad menstruation, acupuncture, but you know they bring it to the lower\npart, not very high. You know, when you speak about open heart surgery, they say, \u201cJust a\nminute.\u201d They don\u2019t agree. But they are interested. They want to know. So when, you know,\nevery doctor have to do twelve, twenty four hour, depend on state. So, they ask me to come and\nAd\nwhen I go and I give a seminar sometime one-fourth of the class go away, skiing and swimming.\n[Laughing.] It\u2019s no problem.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to change the subject back to the time that you\u2019re in France after the war. I think you\nmentioned in the first interview that you were very anxious to have your mother meet the\nLedermans once you were reunited with your mother. And did you go back with her to see\nthem?",
        "A: Oh yes. I did go back with my mother. I did go back with my brother. Well, I... every time I go\nto Europe I go to see them. I just receive a letter from mine, I don\u2019t know how you call this,\ngodmother? And from what I understand he 1s not in this world anymore. I think my godfather\ndie. So, she is there, she must be over eighty. So this, before the Christmas, this coming\nChristmas, I\u2019m going to go back. And I try to reach her by phone to find out how she\u2019s doing.\nIt\u2019s not the same address, it\u2019s another address. So, I want to find out. But when I came back, I\ntook my mother \u2014 oh very quick after the war, maybe two year after war or three year after the\nwar. Because I did want for... my mother was a very interesting person. She didn\u2019t have any,\nshe didn\u2019t ever study. She didn\u2019t know how to write, to read. She was reading Jewish, Hebrew.\nAnd it took her about a week, a week and a half to read one paper in Hebrew. But she was very,\nshe was very smart, not by studying, but by instinct. And she... people like her. The only thing\nI found out, is when people don\u2019t have any background of studying to read aloud, when they get\nold, they lose this normal instinct of life. They are confused. And I did have a lot of very Ph.D.\nmen, who got Alzheimer\u2019s disease, so it doesn\u2019t go with... but most of the time, these people,\nlike my mother, like my brother, they don\u2019t have the training of the brain to be able to hold on,\non something solid. It\u2019s only by memory. They don\u2019t have any technique. And the older she\ngot, harder it was for us to discuss with her. She was, imagine things, like one day she was\nwatching TV and it was something completely normal and she got very angry. And I said,\n\u2018\u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t see what they did on this TV?\u201d And then I realize, well,\nshe didn\u2019t understand and she got mad. But otherwise, she was a very interesting person. I\ncannot speak about my father because I was too young when he died. But it, she was, she\nconnect with my godfather when we did go see him, because my godfather was also very, very\neducated, a very interesting, wide idea of the world. And they did have, I remember a very, very\ninteresting conversation, in a high level, not \u201cIt\u2019s a nice day today. The food was good.\u201d It\nwas... and mine, his wife of my godfather, she was a teacher. I was in love with her, because she\nwas, I think, the most beautiful woman in the world. She was smart. And I was afraid from her,\nbecause she was a teacher. At my age, a teacher you don\u2019t fool around with. But I saw her later\nwhen I was a growing man and she was older and she was the most beautiful woman I had met.\n[Laughing. |",
        "Q: When you call them your godparents, was there any formality or are you just calling them that\nbecause... was there any formal way...?",
        "A: No, because I think they deserve to be called this way. In French it\u2019s parrain, and her it\u2019s\nmarraine. In English it\u2019s godfather. And I don\u2019t know if we have a name for a woman. But\nevery time...eh?",

She tried to be as much as she could, but they never\nstudy and they didn\u2019t know... you know, when I said I want to become a doctor: \u201cWhy? We\nhave a good business. We do upholstery. You can make a good living. Why would you like to\nbe a doctor? We don\u2019t have any doctor in the family.\u201d",

        "Q: So, did you keep in touch with them by writing letters? Or did you visit them a lot?",
        "A: Both. I wrote letter all the time and every time I did go to... I left France in 1960, 1983 to come\nin the United State. But otherwise I was in their place anytime. They, they, you know, he was a\nProtestant priest and after this, he likes to show people he was poor. It was his way to... he was\nnot poor, but he wants to show. So, he bought a little place on the border of the lake, but on the\nother side to go to his house, you have to cross the railroad. And I... he was very, very severe.\nAnd one day, I ask him, you know, very... \u201cWhy did you buy so close to the railroad?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not\nrich. \u2019'm poor. I\u2019m a priest. I cannot afford to buy like the rich people, so thank God I can have\nthis thing.\u201d I never ask anymore. [Laughing.] Because, he was, you know, this is what I can\nafford and that\u2019s it. But he was a good man, very, very good man. Very, not religious like a\npriest, you know, not the man... one day I did go to, you know the Club Med?

So, it\nmeans sometime when you have a guru in life, or parent who direct you the right way, you\u2019ll\nremember things, and it helps you for the rest of your life.",
        "Q: You mentioned a little bit earlier on, that you, did you say in around 1963 or so, you got\nmarried? You got married after the war, sometime in the early 1960s?",
        "A: I think I was twenty-three.",
        "Q: Okay, so earlier than nineteen...",
        "A: Well, my daughter is forty-two. I\u2019m sixty-seven. We have to count; I\u2019m not good in math. But\nit was later, I mean like I said after the war I was thirteen. So, let\u2019s say ten years later I met this\nlady and we got married. I met, she was an artist, painter and medical school was next to, and\nthe cafeteria was together. And that\u2019s where I met her.",
        "Q: Did she, was there, did she understand your history as a Jew and as a Jew who had more or less\nhad gone through the Holocaust and what you\u2019d experienced with losing your family? Was that\nan issue?",
        "A: No. No, she, it was a very, how can I say? Very Catholic family. And everything was going\nfine, everything was okay, until one day in Paris... we used to live a little bit outside of Paris, like\nyou would say in Nicholasville, compared to Lexington. And one day it was a strike, no car, I\nmean, no bus, no train, nothing. And my brother-in-law, who was my age, studying to become\nan architect, did have a motorcycle. He said, \u201cIf you want I can take you to the school, to the\nmedical school.\u201d And his school was very close, too. \u201cYou can ride on the back of the\nmotorcycle.\u201d And I said okay. And we rode there and coming to a fire place, you know, the red\nlight? The red light didn\u2019t work. He didn\u2019t see the car and this car hit us and I flew over and fell\ndown, but I didn\u2019t get anything serious. He did hit the car directly and he broke all his mouth,\nhis right knee. Bad accident. Bad, bad accident. They took us to the hospital and even to this\nday, my daughter told me this yesterday, they going to do surgery on his hip. But he did have\nbad, he lost all his teeth. He was stitched all over. He stopped studying architecture. With the\nmoney he touch from the insurance, he bought a moulin......\n47",
        "Q: Like a windmill?",
        "A: Windmill! He bought a windmill outside of Paris, about two hundred miles from Paris. And he\nbecame a farmer with his mother, his father. The whole family moved there. But his mother\nnever forgave me to be in the motorcycle, because she said, if I wouldn\u2019t be in the motorcycle,\nhe wouldn\u2019t be so badly injured. So, since this accident, there was a bad tension between us,\nbetween the family and me. Did it bring to the divorce? Maybe yes, maybe no, I don\u2019t know.\nBut life became much more difficult, more and more. And even my brother-in-law used to get\nmad at his mother every time she bring up this. Because every time he never complained. Ever.\nAnd sometime he was in bad shape. But his mother said, \u201cYes, if you didn\u2019t have this accident.\u201d\nAnd he say, \u201cPlease you stop.\u201d And he always defend me all the time, but she was, she was\nmad.",
        "Q: Do you feel that, that was really the reason... I mean, was she looking for an excuse to be angry\nat you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Very hard to know what\u2019s going on, on the\nhead of somebody else. And we never got the chance to discuss. She didn\u2019t want to discuss.\nThere was no possibility. The father, he was a bird. He was not on this earth. [Laughing.] He\nwas good man, but out. So, he never want to discuss about this. He didn\u2019t know anything about\nit. He didn\u2019t want to know about anything. And like I said, my brother-in-law didn\u2019t, never\never, ever said anything. Even when I was divorced, he always ask about me, what am I doing\nand everything is okay. But the mother was mean. She was mad.",
        "Q: What about you being Jewish and marrying into a Catholic family?",
        "A: We never spoke about. We never... my daughter is born. And we decide not to give her any\nreligion. When she grew up, she met a man, got married. He was Catholic. She became\nCatholic. And... but I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if the religion was involved or not. I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: Did you, you had talked about feeling anti-Semitism when you were living in France. Did you\nhave any concern about that among your wife\u2019s family?",
        "A: You know, you married somebody, you don\u2019t marry the family. For me, it didn\u2019t matter. I was\nhappy with her. I don\u2019t have to love the mother, the father and the whole family. I don\u2019t know if\nit was against Jew or really I don\u2019t have no idea. No idea. Never asked the question. The\nfeeling between my mother and them... I think they saw each other for my wedding and that\u2019s\nall. They never spoke together. They never got together. It\u2019s very difficult to explain.",
        "Q: What about anti-Semitism on other fronts in France after the war? Did you experience any overt\nanti-Semitism?",
        "A: Oh yes, absolutely. This is... even today, you can take the subway and on the subway in Paris,\nyou can see \u201cJew go Home\u201d or \u201cJew go to Israel\u201d on the subway. It means, you know, it\u2019s like\ndo we have anti-Semitism in United State? Yes. Why, we don\u2019t know. But one day I spoke\n48\nwith a woman from Lexington, she\u2019s a doctor. And she does acupuncture and she one day asked\nme if she can come and watch me. And we start to speak about things, I don\u2019t remember exactly\nwhat it was and she said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. The Jew, they have all the money. They have all the\nbank. Don\u2019t ever trust a Jew.\u201d [Laughing.]| I didn\u2019t know what to say. And I said, \u201cI have to tell\nyou just now, I\u2019m Jewish. And why do you...\u201d and she said, \u201cOh, because maybe you are not\nlike this, but the Jew have all the bank. They got all the money in this country. They are\npolitician. They going to ruin the whole United State.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, if you feel this way, I\nthink this meeting is going to be the last one.\u201d And it was the last one. But, you know, when\nsomebody is... at this point I know I\u2019m going to be with an enemy all the time. So tell me who is\nmy friend, I will find my enemy.",
        "Q: And you mentioned in the last interview that you didn\u2019t really feel comfortable in France.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t feel comfortable anyplace.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I was going to ask you, whether the United States is more comfortable?",
        "A: No. United State is a nice place to live. It is much simpler than France. You can be\nindependent, more than in France. You can have, they don\u2019t look at you like in France. They\nspy the same way in United State, but it\u2019s a different way. It\u2019s much easier. In France, they spy\non you much more. And they don\u2019t have the law you have in United State. You know, the\nConstitution here, it\u2019s very well made. Freedom of Speech is very important. We don\u2019t have\nfreedom. United State is a Democracy. France is a Republic. And it can take hour for me to\nexplain to you, but I think you know the difference between Democracy and Republic. And here\nyou can live... I was surprised how many people was killed in United State by crime last year.\nTwenty-five thousand people die. It\u2019s a lot of people. We don\u2019t have so many dead in France by\ncrime because we don\u2019t have this access of gun and all this. But there is no safe place on Earth.\nAnd America is one of the most happy place you can be. You can live a normal life, almost.\nYou can buy a car when you want. If you are courageous and work hard, you can make money,\nenjoy yourself. But the limit is very short in United State. And what is the limit? My idea of\nlimit 1s six hundred thousand dollar. Not everybody can save six hundred thousand dollar, but\nafter six hundred thousand dollar\u2014and if you want, one day I\u2019m going to explain this to you\u2014\neverything, if you die or your husband die and leave you a million dollar, you\u2019re going to get six\nhundred thousand dollar. The rest goes to the government, no matter how you go. They... the\nIRS law are very, very well made. They give you this, they take this. They get you anyway. So\nif you have a little bit, if you are low profile, United State 1s perfect. I am a low profile doctor\nand it\u2019s okay. I like this life. I don\u2019t have any problem. But people who become rich, they do,\nthey can, but they have to know how to do it. I wouldn\u2019t like to be rich in the United State.\n[Laughing]",
        "Q: Because you don\u2019t support the way that the government spends the money that you have to pay\nthem?",
        "A: Uh huh.",
        "Q: What are your political outlooks, affiliations?\n49",
        "A: I don\u2019t have any political idea, because for the simple reason, anybody who wants to go, want to\nbe a politician has to put money in his pocket. Because people are stupid. If people would be\nintelligent, they wouldn\u2019t vote. Neither for Clinton, neither for Bush, Democrat, Republican, not\nvote. We don\u2019t want you. I would vote for Perot, just to see what he can do. But he doesn\u2019t\nplay the game. Perot is a smart man, but he doesn\u2019t play the game, so no there. It\u2019s not a dream.\nBut let\u2019s say maybe this movie actor, what\u2019s his name? Is going to present himself to become\nthe President of the United State. Warren Beatty? No.",
        "Q: I didn\u2019t realize...",
        "A: Yeah. He present, maybe he\u2019s going to present himself. But otherwise... what Clinton did 1s a\nshame for the country. I don\u2019t think he deserve to be called President of United State. He is a...\nbut Bush was not better. \u201cRead my lips, no more income tax,\u201d I mean, and look what he did.\nAnd the people go, they\u2019re going to vote for his son, or they\u2019re going to vote for another jerk,\nmoron, who is going to be the President. The people need to be whacked in the head. And it\u2019s\nokay. I don\u2019t belong to the people. I\u2019m not a politician. So I enjoy myself.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t vote?",
        "A: Yes I vote. Yeah, I vote because I think it\u2019s a duty. I vote, but just because I have to.\n[Laughing. |",
        "Q: So you\u2019re a... when did you become a citizen?",
        "A: Oh, in 1983... *93.",
        "Q: Was that a significant event for you to become a citizen of this country?",
        "A: No. [Laughing.] No, no it\u2019s not. I think more about myself as a citizen of the world, more than a\ncitizen of a country. It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m an American. I\u2019m a Spanish. I\u2019m an Italian. \u2019ma\nFrench. What does it mean? I\u2019m human.",
        "Q: Why did you decide to come to the United States in 1983?",
        "A: Well, number one is because I was a little bit tired about what I was feeling in France. And it\nwas time for me to change and this was some feeling. I have feeling sometime and this was the\ntime for me to go away. Even I did have a very good practice in France, everything was going\nfine, but [clears throat|\u2014excuse me\u2014it was time for me to do something else. And since before\nI left United State in 1962, I took the State Board of Kentucky. I came back in Kentucky to\nestablish... and I didn\u2019t know where. I choose Lexington because it was a challenge. And I\ndecide to open an office here and later maybe go to another state. Because when you come back\nin United State with a license, you have to stay at least three year in the state, before you can\nmove to another one. I tried to have the equivalence of my medical license here and I found out\nKentucky is one of the most difficult state to have a reciprocity of the diploma. So, I decide I\u2019m\ngoing to have mine, I did have mine license for Chiropractic, so I took my chiropractic license,\n50\nrenew it, and I stay here. And since 1983, I did have three different office, one in Versailles\nRoad, the another one in North Broadway for at least fourteen year and now in Palomar. And it\nwas very, very interesting. I like the state. I like the weather. A little bit cold in the winter time,\nbut... I like horses, so I\u2019m very happy when I can drive in the country and see all the horses. I\nhave a lot of friend who have horses. I ride a lot of horses. And I travel a lot. I give a lot of\nseminar in United State and in Europe. I go to China once every five year to re-educate mine\nacupuncture. And life is great here. Right now I have a project. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to do\nit. But either I\u2019m going to move to the Caribbean in an island where there is already a\nchiropractor. And I\u2019m going to go see him probably at the end of this month, September, 1999.\nOr if I don\u2019t like what I see there, I probably going to buy a farm in Woodford County around\nVersailles, like we say here. And have a farm with horses and my practice at the same time until\nI die. So, this is going to be my project until the end of 1999. Thinking about what, I don\u2019t\nknow if it is going to be different in the year two thousand. Everybody think about something\ndifferent. I don\u2019t think nothing is going to happen, but anyway it doesn\u2019t make any difference\nfor me. And this is my project. I was very happy for my move to come here. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s\nvery, even up to this day since 1983 I\u2019m back in United State, even up to this day it is very hard\nfor me to adapt to the American life, but it\u2019s not too bad. And Ill survive. And we\u2019ll see what\nmy project are going to give me and what am I going to do. But it\u2019s going to be a surprise for\nmyself and for my friends.",
        "Q: What\u2019s hard to adapt to about American life?",
        "A: It is completely different. Life here is different. People live differently, they got different\npriority. I could say the same thing about France. They in France, they live different. They\nhave different personality. Here, we don\u2019t eat, we nourish ourselves. In France a meal is like a\nbig festivity. We take our time. Relation between male and female in France is much more\nromantic. It is much more something sensitive, sensual. Here it\u2019s much more difficult, woman\nwants to be man. Sometimes man become woman. It 1s, it would take a whole book to explain\nthe difference between France and United State. But when you want, you adapt. And I go back\nto France at least once or twice a year. Every time I go, I enjoy. I have a good time. I read\nalmost everything in French, because since I left France, I think poetry in France is beautiful.\nAnd there 1s no problem, you always survive. You adapt and you survive. You don\u2019t have\nalways exactly what you want, but where do we have what we want? It\u2019s another world and it\u2019s\nfor me like another life.",
        "Q: Why Kentucky?",
        "A: Well, because when I left, I took my license in 1962. I took the first license open and it was\nKentucky. So, I took my license and I didn\u2019t even wait for the results. Did go back home, open\nmy office. And I receive my license from Kentucky and this is why I came back here. And\nwhen I came back here, I thought maybe I\u2019m going to go to another state, but after a while I said,\nwhere can I go? It\u2019s nothing worse here or better than any other place. I\u2019m not a California man.\nI\u2019m not a Florida man. So, it\u2019s pretty good here. So, I think this is where I am going to stay, if I\ndon\u2019t go to an island.",
        "Q: Did you know anything about Kentucky before you made the move?\n51",
        "A: No. No. Nothing. No. I knew there was a lot of horses, that\u2019s all. But otherwise it took me a\nlong time to understand the way they speak English, but now I think I\u2019m used to. A lot of people\neven now don\u2019t understand me, but it doesn\u2019t matter because they adopt me. I like them, they\nlike me and we don\u2019t have any problem.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have any stereotypes of what Kentucky was or what the South was?",
        "A: No, I was surprised at the beginning a lot of times, because I didn\u2019t know people still using\nchewing tobacco. And I didn\u2019t know... well, when I was in New York on my way to come here,\na friend of mine said, \u201cIf you go to Kentucky, they are fifty years behind every other state.\u201d I\ndidn\u2019t believe it, but there was a little bit truth of what they say. But didn\u2019t bother me, no\nproblem.",
        "Q: Are you involved in the community in Lexington in any way?",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t like to be involved in groups. I\u2019m not a politician. I\u2019m not a religious man. So, I\nlook, if it was something I can do or something I can help, I probably would do, but I stay put. I\nstay on my backyard. I don\u2019t want to be too much involved with all those things, so. I\u2019m in the\nback.",
        "Q: Do you have Jewish friends in Lexington?",
        "A: Yes, I have a few Jewish friend, but like I always said, they are American Jew and they don\u2019t\nknow exactly what it is to be a European Jew, so we have a lot of difference. The main thing is,\nJewish in Europe help themselves with other Jew, around here to be Jew for another Jew doesn\u2019t\nmean nothing.",
        "Q: Do you feel that your experiences as a Holocaust survivor set you apart in some way from the\nJewish community here?",
        "A: You mean? I don\u2019t quite understand what...",
        "Q: The fact of your association with the Holocaust and your immediate experience, losing family\nmembers and so forth, gives you a very different personal history than American Jews, in the\nsense of the fact that you\u2019ve seen this incredible tragedy close up and felt the effects very\ndirectly on your life. I\u2019m wondering whether, whether that has been a wall between you and\nJews here?",
        "A: Yes, let\u2019s put it this way, they are Jewish. They know what happened in Europe. They are\ninterested for six minute, that\u2019s all, all the rest, it goes above the head. They don\u2019t feel like really\nthey are concerned. Even if it looks like, but they are, you know: \u201cIt\u2019s just, it happened. We\nhope it\u2019s never going to happen again. Only if they start to touch Jewish people in United State,\nthis is another story, but otherwise, we send\u2014this is what they say\u2014we send money to Israel,\nwe help them. We have a clean conscience. We are good Jew.\u201d\n52\nEnd of Tape 4, Side B\n53\nTape 5, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number five, side A of an interview with Paul Pressman. Do you feel that the Jews\nhere in Lexington that you\u2019ve come into contact with are naive?",
        "A: Not only the Jew from Lexington, everywhere I did go... my name in France is unique, because\nthere is no other Pressman. But every time I go in places like San Francisco, any place, I look in\nthe telephone book to see there is Pressman and I found a few. I call them and there is no, no\nfeeling. I don\u2019t... you know, they say, \u201cOh yeah, your name is Pressman, oh yeah, interesting.\nWhere were you? From where are you, you have an accent?\u201d But we don\u2019t feel like... for\nexample, let\u2019s say somebody, many time people came in my office in Paris saying \u201cI\u2019m Jewish, I\ncome from Yugoslavia. I\u2019m passing through here and I\u2019m going to try to go to United State or\nSpain or place.\u201d \u201cOkay, where do you sleep tonight?\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have any place.\u201d \u201cYou\ncome and you sleep at my place and you\u2019re going to eat with me and I\u2019m going to call a few...\u201d\nAnd I try to put some money together and give it to this guy, so he can fulfill... when I came here\nthe first time, I did go to a Jewish association, I don\u2019t remember the name, to introduce myself.\nAnd say, \u201cMy name is Paul Pressman, I\u2019m a medical doctor and I\u2019m going to open an office.\u201d\nThey lady look at me and she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we don\u2019t have money to give to you.\u201d And I say,\n\u201cLady I didn\u2019t come to ask money, I just came to introduce myself.\u201d I left and never, never saw\nthose people again. They send me paper and they wrote me letter. I said, \u201cIf this is the way you\nwelcome people in your congregation, the hell with you. Stay where you are and I stay off.\u201d\nThis is why since the beginning I didn\u2019t join anybody. I didn\u2019t speak with anybody and I stay in\nmy corner. A lot of patient, Jewish patients, said \u201cOh, you should come.\u201d I said, \u201cYou go and\nyou leave me alone. I don\u2019t want to belong.\u201d One day the Rabbi came here and he spoke to me\nand he said, \u201cAs a Jewish man you should at least belong to the synagogue.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou\nbelong to the synagogue. You leave me alone. I don\u2019t want to see you anymore in my office. If\nyou need me, if you have a health problem, I will take care of you, otherwise forget me.\u201d I\ndidn\u2019t like the attitude. I didn\u2019t like the way they been treating people. And now suddenly, they\ntake Jewish people from Russia and they give them home. Who do they think they show this?\nFor what? No, it\u2019s... for me, there are two kind of bad Jew in this world, the German Jew and the\nAmerican Jew. I don\u2019t have any respect for the German. We call them the Yecket (ph). And\nwhat we call the Jew here, speaking about the woman, American Jew, the JAP, the Jewish\nAmerican Princess. I don\u2019t want to have nothing to do with them. They can live their life, but\nI\u2019m Jewish by tradition. I don\u2019t go to the synagogue. And they go to the synagogue. They do\nthe Bar Mitzvah for the kids, but it\u2019s not my kind. So, I stay away from these people. That\u2019s all.",
        "Q: How do you feel as a Jew living in Kentucky?",
        "A: I don\u2019t have any problem. I don\u2019t have any problem. When people ask me what kind of religion\nI am, I say \u201cI\u2019m born Jew\u201d and there is no problem. There is no, \u201cAh, you\u2019re Jewish.\u201d No, no.\nThey don\u2019t say anything. We have to remember United State is based on the free willing of\nreligion. Anybody can be what they want. So, you have, I think, about two hundred different\nChristian religion. Everything goes okay, is no problem. If there is no problem with them, it\u2019s\nno problem with me.",
        "Q: Do you consider yourself a Holocaust survivor?\n54",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yeah. Yeah. I don\u2019t, without being sent to Auschwitz, I\u2019m the closest one to suffer\nand been suffering because of the Nazi and because I was Jewish. Oh yes.",
        "Q: And 1s that an important part of your identity as far as, I mean when you get to know people for\nexample, is it important for them to know that you are a Holocaust survivor?",
        "A: No, no, no. This is something who comes if they are interested, we can speak about it. But no,\nthis is mine, this is my life. I didn\u2019t choose it. This is the way it is and I\u2019m not ashamed of it.\nI\u2019m not proud of it. This is the way it is. They say Jewish people are the chosen people from\nGod. We pay the price. But it\u2019s okay. If in the next life, we\u2019re going to have another religion,\nmaybe we going to be able to breathe a little bit and look on the other side.",
        "Q: Do you, have you ever thought about... the public consciousness of the Holocaust has changed a\nlot in recent years. People have become much more aware of Holocaust history and much more\ninterested in it, 1t seems, on a popular culture level, a lot of books, films and so forth. Have you\nbeen interested at all in speaking publicly about those experiences that you\u2019ve had?",
        "A: No, because my, the way they do it now, is became movies, to make movies. It\u2019s always very\nhard to make a good movie. This is a good subject. Books, the writer will write about another\nwriter, who wrote something about the Holocaust. It becomes diluted. And I think... men like\nmy brother, for example, who survive Holocaust, doesn\u2019t want to speak in public, because they\nwouldn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s got to say. I mean, they wouldn\u2019t... they say, that\u2019s impossible,\nyou tell us a story. Story he told me, I know it\u2019s true, because he wouldn\u2019t lie to me. And he\u2019s\nnot a liar. But I can put myself in the shoes of somebody who never heard about Holocaust,\nlisten to what he\u2019s got to say. It doesn\u2019t make sense. It is the truth, but it doesn\u2019t make sense.\nThis didn\u2019t happen. It can\u2019t be done. So, right now, sure, more we do about the Holocaust\nMuseum, the best it is because it helps for people not to forget. But it\u2019s the basic. Unless\nsomebody is really interested on what happen and I mean Jewish people who are interested, they\ncan find this someplace. But in public, you know... my brother did go to Germany in a school to\nspeak about Holocaust and half of the class didn\u2019t know what was Holocaust. \u201cWhat do you\nmean by Holocaust? What is it? A fruit? A piece of bread? What is Holocaust?\u201d So. You\nknow you speak in front of people about something they don\u2019t understand. They don\u2019t have a\nclue of what you talking about. They say, \u201cWhat is he talking about? Did he make a movie?\u201d\nSchindler List was something close to the Holocaust and it make sense. It was human.\nAuschwitz is unhuman. You tell things about Auschwitz. It is not real. It\u2019s a bad dream. And\nyou have people listen to... \u201cThis guy is nuts. He doesn\u2019t know what he is talking about.\u201d But\nthis happen. So, right now, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good, I mean the best thing 1s to have museum\nand encourage people... my attorney here sent his son\u2014he\u2019s Jewish\u2014he sent his son at\nWashington. And when he came back, he didn\u2019t speak for one week. And the father said,\n\u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d He said, \u201cI was shocked. What they did to Jewish people. I was shocked\nfrom what I saw.\u201d So, I think the most important is to send people there, children, the new\ngeneration, for them to see what happened. When I did go to Auschwitz, full bus of school kids\nused to come in Auschwitz to see the crematorium where all the Jewish die. And I think this is\nwonderful, because we should never forget what happened. But speaking in the public and\n55\nexplaining things, it\u2019s not enough. You have to visualize. You have to see things. This is why\nthe Museum is important.",
        "Q: When did you go to Auschwitz?",
        "A: Two years ago in March. At the anniversary of the death of my other brother. I did go with my\nbrother because he show me every place he been. Where were the kitchen. Where was the, the\nhospital, or things like this. It was, it was very, very interesting.",
        "Q: Can you talk more about what that whole trip was like?",
        "A: Well, we left from Paris to Warsaw and Auschwitz. It was very short, because it\u2019s very close to\nParis. And we stay in a crummy hotel, because this was the only hotel in Auschwitz-Birkenau.\nWe did, uh, Auschwitz is a military camp, military place. This is where there all the glasses\nfrom the Jewish people who die. The clothes, the hair, the shoes, the denture. And you see all\nthis exposed behind glass. And after this you go in the barrack and wood where they live. And I\nthink it is very impressive and it is real. The only thing my brother was surprised when we did\ngo the first time and he said, \u201cSomething is different.\u201d\u2019 The barrack 1s the same, the whole thing.\nThe grass, it was grass, high grass. By the time people were there, you didn\u2019t have any grass.\nWhy? Because they eat the grass. So, the little piece of grass on the ground was eat, it was food.\nThis is why it was different. But otherwise, the whole thing, the concentration camp, I mean the\ncrematorium, everything was... there is a little lake in the middle of the camp, not very big,\nwhere they put all the ashes of the dead people. Below forty degree in winter time, this lake\nnever froze, because of the grease of the human body. And a lot of things like this. It is, I think,\na place to see. I think if I was an American Jew, this is the first place I want to go. I want to see\nwhat happened. But when you say this to Jewish people, they say \u201cI have better place to go.\u201d I\nsay, \u201cGood for you.\u201d",
        "Q: Was it an important trip for you and your brother to make together?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. It was very important to be together. For me to see where he was, where did he\nsleep, how did he live? What was the... everything is dead anymore. I have a lot of feeling when\nI go some place. There was no feeling, everything is gone. The only thing stay is the wall, the\ncabin, the wood barrack, but everything is gone. The spirit is gone. But it\u2019s very impressive.\nThis is where you see the railroad train would arrive and it stop right there. All the Jewish\npeople did go down, the ones going to go to the gas chamber on this right, the one who 1s going\nto live a little bit, on the left. And, I mean, this is something you have to see. And I have to say,\nI\u2019m very thankful to the Polish government, who are the most anti-Semitic people in this earth, to\nmaintain the camp the way it is. It\u2019s very, very important to keep it the way it 1s, because, like I\nsaid, most... a lot of people have to see this. But they do a good job. And it\u2019s free, the entrance\nis free. And everything is kept the way it was. And it\u2019s something to see.",
        "Q: Do you have anything else that you\u2019d like to say or to talk about today?",
        "A: No, I think we cover most of the path. If you think about something later and you want for us to\nmeet again, it will be no problem. But I think now, we saw the overall picture and now it\u2019s\n56\ngoing to be your job to put this together. And it was a very nice interview and I was very happy\nto do it.",
        "Q: Well, thank you very much, I was happy, too.\nConclusion of Interview\n57\n"

        "Q: We\u2019ll have more of a chance to talk more about these things I hope, but let\u2019s go back to\nSwitzerland. Before you joined the Ledermans, you were in a refuge camp for a couple of\nmonths, it sounded like.",

        "Q: They should have told that one to Martin Luther, huh?",
        "Q: So do you remember hearing that the war ended while you were in Switzerland? Were you in\nSwitzerland when the war ended?",
        "Q: Do you remember celebrating in any particular way?",
        "Q: So you\u2019re something like thirteen years old at that time, right?",
        "Q: And you just left on your own and forged out to look for your parents without any assistance?",
        "Q: Was it something from before the war that you think was just in your nature or is this something\nthat... ?",
        "Q: I assume that during that time that you were with the Ledermans, you didn\u2019t have any word from\nyour mother at all.",
        "Q: Going back to one more thing, you mentioned that while you were there at the Lederman\u2019s you\nstarted to read a lot and to become interested... do you remember what you were reading?",
        "Q: Did you talk to Pastor Lederman at all about your interest in education or in studying medicine\nor any...\u201d Did he encourage you in any way?",
        "Q: And do you remember reuniting with your mother and your brother?",
        "Q: Can you talk about that moment?",
        "Q: Okay, this is an interview with Dr. Paul Pressman, a continuation. It\u2019s now August 17\", 1999,\ncontinuing our interview from July. And this is tape number three, side A. I wondered when I\nwas looking over the notes. I took some, listened to the interview that we did last time and I took\nsome notes on things that we had talked about, and one thing which stood out, that I didn\u2019t ask\nyou about was, I wondered how you felt... you were talking about your mother\u2019s role in the\nresistance and discovering that she was actually a fighter or a captain in the resistance movement\nand that she showed you this gun that she kept hidden in this book. And I wondered how that\neffected your view of your mother and how, whether that moment was significant to you in some\nway?",
        "Q: Knowing what she was doing before, meaning that...?",
        "Q: The reason that I noticed it and that I asked you about it, one reason was that the gun, the issue of\nyour experiences with a gun came up a couple of times during the interview yesterday. You\ntalked about the one time that, or not yesterday but earlier, you talked about the one time Pastor\nLederman got angry at you was when he saw you playing with his gun. And then you talked\nabout that other incident with your mother. And then you mentioned also that you feel safer if\nyou have a gun now. And that was something you didn\u2019t talk about on tape. And I was\nwondering if you would talk about that?",
        "Q: Did your father carry a gun before the war, too?",
        "Q: So that meant when you saw your mother with a gun it wasn\u2019t so unusual, because you had\nalready seen your father with a gun and it was something you were used to having around.",
        "Q: Do you ever feel critical of those who didn\u2019t struggle enough? There\u2019s been a lot a criticism of\nJews during the Holocaust, that they didn\u2019t struggle enough.",
        "Q: And along those lines, you also mentioned last time that before the war and maybe during the\nwar too, you thought of yourself that way, as a French person and then as a Jew. And I\u2019m\nwondering when that switched that you really felt like, no I\u2019m not French, I\u2019m Jewish?",
        "Q: Have you ever gotten into trouble with any people, with any American Jews by telling them that?\nI mean you have a very strong opinion about it and some people might have strong... Do you\never get into arguments?",
        "Q: And when you said that people here, when you talked about your time in Europe and they\nthought you were telling stories, were you talking about the Holocaust years or afterwards?",
        "Q: We left off last time where the war had ended and you went back from Switzerland to Paris and\nyou rejoined you mother and your brother, Gaston, and eventually your other brother, Bernard.\nAnd you didn\u2019t have time to tell in detail about what happened from there. So, but you did\nmention briefly that you moved into your aunt\u2019s apartment, who had been killed at Auschwitz.\nCan you talk about those, trying to reconstruct your and rebuild your life together in those few\nmonths after the war, in Paris?",
        "Q: What was the name of it? Sorry to interrupt.",
        "Q: The factory that your father owned.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s slow down, because I want to get some more details about just the time immediately after\nthe war before we go on. Was it, so you were staying in your aunt\u2019s house for just a little while\nbefore you moved? Is that right?",
        "Q: And were you surrounded by your aunt\u2019s things, who had been killed? That must have been\nStrange.",
        "Q: How did you feel as a Jewish person, survivor of the Holocaust, living in Paris immediately after\nthe war?",
        "Q: Angry?",
        "Q: What was it that he told her? Do you know?",
        "Q: So, the lawyers got involved because... why? Why did the lawyers get involved?",
        "Q: Did you have, did your relationship with your brother Bernard change very much after the war,\nafter he had been through these experiences in Auschwitz?",
        "Q: Okay, this is tape three, side B. When you say the technique of forgiveness and learning about\nthe technique of forgiveness, what do you mean?",
        "Q: Enjoys being angry?",
        "Q: Does he feel guilty about that?",
        "Q: Was it difficult for you to... you talked about how empowering it was to learn this technique of\nforgiveness. Was it really difficult to get to that point where you\u2019re forgiving not only people\nwithin your own life, but applying it to this larger situation of the Holocaust?",
        "Q: Kevorkian.",
        "Q: Do you have any answers for it?",
        "Q: Do you remember when you first realized that you had a deep interest in medicine?",
        "Q: Do you remember any significant moments when you realized that? Something that happened to\nyou that made you say, \u201cAh, I really want to study this\u2019?",
        "Q: When did you, so in the time after the war when you were in France and you were attending\nschool again, did you have the... how long did it take before you had the idea that you wanted to\nbecome a doctor and do you remember how that happened?",
        "Q: What was it... have you always believed in God?",
        "Q: Can you describe your... this 1s going to be a difficult question, I think. Can you describe what\nyou think of when you think of God? What do you think when you say, I\u2019ve always believed in\nGod? What does God represent to you? What does it mean?",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re, tell me if this is right. Your God, your idea of God or your perception of what God is\nmaybe partially comes from your Jewish tradition, but partially comes from your own instinctive\nsense. And then maybe from other religious traditions, too?",
        "Q: Except for Hasidic Jews. And I don\u2019t know if modern Hasidic Jews do.",
        "Q: How did you gain such a reputation for your practice?",
        "Q: When you were beginning to study medicine, when you started going to medical school, were\nyou pleased by what you were experiencing, what you were learning? Did it meet your\nexpectations, and your hopes?",
        "Q: This is tape number four, side A. Say it again.",
        "Q: So, did you learn anything that you found really useful in medical school?",
        "Q: And when you said, you talked a little bit about, about your, the word of mouth that went around\nand that you gained a reputation. What was it that you were good at? What was your particular\naptitude?",
        "Q: You talked about when you started to discover chiropractic medicine. What exactly was it that\ncaptured your interest?",
        "Q: You\u2019re studying, you\u2019re in medical school studying western medicine which has a very different\napproach than the one you\u2019re describing right now. Was that difficult for you? That you have a\nvery unconventional approach?",
        "Q: When did you start getting interested in acupuncture?",
        "Q: What is it about it that interested you? What did you read in that book, for example?",
        "Q: Obnoxious.",
        "Q: Tell me, give me some examples. What have you been able to do with it?",
        "Q: You said that you lecture a lot and do seminars. On what subjects?",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to change the subject back to the time that you\u2019re in France after the war. I think you\nmentioned in the first interview that you were very anxious to have your mother meet the\nLedermans once you were reunited with your mother. And did you go back with her to see\nthem?",
        "Q: When you call them your godparents, was there any formality or are you just calling them that\nbecause... was there any formal way...?",
        "Q: Godmother.",
        "Q: Did their influence continue to be very active?",
        "Q: So your relationship was... can you describe how your relationship grew after you stopped living\nwith them?",
        "Q: Did you tell the Ledermans when you wanted to become a doctor?",
        "Q: Yeah. And what was their response?",

        "A: I was born in Paris, France, May 29, 1932. I did my school in France, my medical school, also.\nAnd I stay until the first World War and when the German came. And by the time probably I\nwas around nine years old, and the Germans start to come in the school, but first it was the\nFrench police who came, just asking every teacher, \u201cDo you have any Jewish boy in the school?\u201d\nAnd she said or he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d So they ask, \u201cWho is Jewish, raise your hand.\u201d And I\ndidn\u2019t raise my hand and when I did go back home, I said to my mother and father, well, this is\nwhat happened. And they sent me in a safe place in South of France.",
        "A: I think it was personal instinct. I thought, you know, you can ask, \u201cAre you French? Would you\nlike to stay and live in France?\u201d But the question \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d was a little bit surprising\nfor me. Why should people ask what kind of religion, mostly we knew it was the police. So, I\ndidn\u2019t feel comfortable, so I said, I\u2019m going to wait a little bit and speak to my parent and ask\nthem what they think.",
        "A: Oh yes, I, in Paris, they start to prepare a big place, to put a lot of people, belonging to a certain\nreligion, so I knew something was going on, but , you know, at my age, when I was nine or ten\nyears old, it is not, it\u2019s not like a game, but it\u2019s not very serious.

        "A: They got married in Romania and they came, I remember my father saying, at the time they\narrive in France, my mother was sixteen or seventeen. And they try first to come in United State,\nbut they didn\u2019t let them in United State, because my mother did have glaucoma. And they didn\u2019t\nknow what was glaucoma at the time. They thought it was a very dangerous sickness, so she did\ngo back to England, stay in England a little while and establish in Paris, France. And this is\nwhere I was born.",

        "A: Yes, because he was sent with me in a safe town, south of France, because at the time France\nwas cut in two parts, north and south. And the south was with the Italian and it was much easier\nthere. It didn\u2019t stay long, but by the time the Italian were there, it was much easier than in north,\nwhere the Germans were much more rough with us.\n' The \u201cJ\u201d is probably a misstated \u201cG\u201d.\n2",

        "A: Well, she stopped when the French police, under the order of the German came to pick up my\ntwo brother. And my two brother did follow the police with no resistance, because they, you\nknow, the police said it is just to make a verification of your paper. And they didn\u2019t ask anything\nabout my father, but he right away closed the whole thing. And we had been waiting about the\nanswer, but my two brother never came back.",
        "A: Well, we used to have a nice apartment in Paris, close to the business of my father. And also\nabout fifteen miles from Paris, we did have a little villa, where we used to go on Saturday and\nSunday and stay there. Life was very simple, happy, didn\u2019t have any major problem. They used\nto work during the week. I used to go to school. Saturday... Friday night, we load the car, we\ndid go and stay outside of Paris. And everything was fine and dandy. So, life was normal, until\nthe whole German story start and then everything change overnight.",
        "A: My mother was very religious, but my father was not religious at all. So, he ask me one day, I\nremember, he said, \u201cDo you want to do your Bar Mitzvah?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\nOkay, no Bar Mitzvah. And it was the end of the story. My brothers never did a Bar Mitzvah.\nHe was really not very interested in, not only in the Jewish religion, but on any religion. This 1s,\nI think, the way Iam now. [Laughing]",
        "A: I think so. I think it was hard for her and this is why she asked us, the day she\u2019s going to die, she\nwants to be buried with the Jewish religion, which we did. At the time, I did have an office in\nsouth of France, close to Nice. And when she died, we made... the rabbi did the whole thing.\nWe didn\u2019t understand anything about it, because it was the first Jewish funeral we did. But here\nshe is in south of France, in a Jewish place, where she was buried like the Jewish religion.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: In France? They came very, not in force. They came very, very slowly. The reason, I think,\nthey got the whole thing so easy is because the French people are very anti-Semitic. So, for them\n3\nto give the address or to reveal where the Jew were living, it was not a problem. And I don\u2019t\nmean to say all of them, because a lot of police... we did have a neighbor, across from our\napartment, who was from the police. And I even remember his name. His name was Mr.\nReddler (ph). And every time something did happen, he came in our door, knock on the door\nand said, \u201cBe careful. They\u2019re going to do this, they\u2019re going to do this.\u201d So, I don\u2019t mean to\nsay all the Frenchmen, but I said at least the majority of the French people were anti-Semitic.",

Yes, you couldn\u2019t do otherwise\nthan to realize, okay, we are not welcome in our own country. When I say our own country, I\u2019m\nborn in France, so I thought I was a Frenchman, which was a big mistake, because no. I was a\nJew. It\u2019s a little bit the same problem and I don\u2019t want to start any...",
        "A: It\u2019s the, my feeling... I speak with a lot of black people here and I ask them why do you call\nyourself, African-American? I don\u2019t say to people, I am a French-American. I\u2019m an American,\nbecause I asked to become an American. If I would call myself French-American, it would mean\nto say, I\u2019m very happy to be French and I\u2019m also happy to be an American. And I think in life,\nyou have to make a choice, either you are an American or you\u2019re French. And if it wouldn\u2019t\nbe... I say this the other day to a black guy. He was very surprised. And coming from me, I\nthink it was not a big problem. But I said, \u201cI think you\u2019re very lucky, your grand-grandparent\nwas brought in United State. At least now you can drive a car. You can have a nice home,\ninstead of being in Africa where you\u2019d be starving. You wouldn\u2019t have any clothes to put on\nyour back and anybody can kill you. And this for me is racism. Here racism 1s not this. They\nare not racist, so I don\u2019t understand why you call yourself African-American. You are American\nfrom two, three or four generations. And it\u2019s not because your parents were slave.\u201d And when\nyou know the story about the slave, it\u2019s not the American who took the black people. It\u2019s the\nchief of the village, who give black people to the American. So...",
        "A: Most of the time they said, \u201cWell it\u2019s a way of things. You have a different way of speaking.\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cYou know, I, as a Jewish person cannot be a racist. So, if I tell you this, it\u2019s because\ncoming from another country, I\u2019m surprised the way you deal with your slave story. You feel\nsorry for yourself, but you\u2019re so lucky to be in a country where you have freedom and you can\nlive like any other person. You\u2019re Black? Sure it\u2019s, you can see a black man, but sometimes you\ncan recognize a Jewish boy and so it\u2019s nothing worse to be Black or to be Jew, but I don\u2019t want\nto fight the country for this.\u201d\n4",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh yeah, oh yeah, Jewish people can be very, very racist. And I saw this on many\ndifferent occasion. But it\u2019s not the same kind of racism they have. It\u2019s a... I don\u2019t know any\nJew belonging to the KKK.",
        "A: Absolutely, so I don\u2019t think... but it\u2019s, it make a... Man is man, woman 1s woman, people are\npeople. And you can find people, different idea of people, different approach of life and so I\nthink, yes, it can be a lot of, some Jewish people can be racist. It doesn\u2019t make a... but before\nwe have to define: what do they mean by being racist?",
        "A: Well, racism is something, it\u2019s hate with no reason. You like some people, you like some people\nliving in this country. You like some people living in another country. You don\u2019t like people the\nway they live, this can be racism. But basically, it\u2019s not racism, it\u2019s something, because you\ndon\u2019t like their way of laughing. Black people are very exuberant and maybe some American\ndon\u2019t like this and this can be a form of racism. And like I said before, Jewish people living in\nAmerica are much more American than they are Jewish. And because of this, they can be racist.",
        "A: Because they feel very safe in this country. And like I told you before, Jewish people are Jewish\nby tradition, but they belong to a minority. And if you are in France or in United State or any\ncountry in the world, you still are minority. But it is so comfortable in United State, then Jewish\npeople forget the background and say, \u201cBut I\u2019m an American.\u201d And I say, \u201cNo, first you are\nJew, and if anybody is going to kill you, they\u2019re going to kill you, just because you are Jew, not\nbecause you\u2019re an American.\u201d And this is the big problem and they lose the identity of being\nJewish, just because they feel so comfortable. They feel, /t\u2019s my country. Yes it is, in one way.\nBut until, and you can see this on TV, this young man, who been speaking about racism against\nblack, Jew, all the Jew have the power in the bank. It\u2019s not true, but in his mind it is. And he\nkilled people and he killed himself. You saw this on TV two or three days ago. This is the big\nproblem.",
        "A: At the time I didn\u2019t have a lot of friends, because I was, I did a big selection. I\u2019m not the kind of\nman who have a lot of friends. And yes, at the time all my friends, at the time were Jewish. The\nreason 1s, I feel more comfortable with Jewish people than with non-Jewish people. And again, I\ndon\u2019t speak about religion. I speak about tradition. Going to a Jewish restaurant once in a while,\nit\u2019s fun and it remind me memory. Watching a movie with Jewish song, it\u2019s fun. I\u2019ve been\nmarried twice with non-Jewish woman and I was missing this exchange of jokes, Jewish jokes or\nword. Even in New York, when I go to New York, people speak a lot of Jewish word and it\u2019s\nalways funny. And I always say, \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d \u201cNo, but we use a lot of Jewish word here\n5\nin New York,\u201d but they are not Jewish. But it\u2019s funny, I like it, because it\u2019s something... So\nwhen I was in France, I didn\u2019t want to have non-Jewish friend because I would never know if the\nsame guy 1s not going to give me a knife when the time comes.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes.",
        "A: Well, my brother came back from the concentration camp. The only reason I left France to come\nin the United State, I decided to come here in 1983, is because I didn\u2019t feel comfortable in\nFrance. Because up to this date, you have this anti-Semitism in France. My brother, who is\nseventy-six or seventy-eight, doesn\u2019t feel it. He said, \u201cNo, this is in your mind.\u201d And he is\nmarried with a non-Jew woman. She 1s wonderful woman, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable. I...\nFrance is a beautiful country. I like to go on vacation, but I couldn\u2019t live there anymore, because\nof all this background. I\u2019ve never been comfortable in France.",
        "A: Yes, all the time.",
        "A: Yes, uh huh. I don\u2019t find a lot of people I can speak Yiddish with, because most of the Jewish\npeople here, don\u2019t speak Yiddish. But my grandson, which is the son of my daughter, and my\ndaughter doesn\u2019t follow the religion. But my grandson studied the Jewish story, I mean the\ndifference between Sepharad and Ashkenazi and he said, \u201cBut sometime they are racist\nbetween...\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, I know.\u201d I think if you put two men with no religion on an island,\nthere\u2019s going to be racism, because man is stupid. They want to fight. They want to fight for a\nreason. The reason is religion. And they are going to fight about God, it\u2019s my God, it\u2019s not your\nGod. God is God. Your God is my God. There is only one God. But we don\u2019t want this, this\nway.",
        "A: It was March in 1942, when they did go to Auschwitz. Before it was a camp a little bit outside\nof Paris called Drancy, where all the Jewish people been put together for a length of time, I think\nit was between eight and ten month. Where they start to shape the whole thing: \u201cAre we going\nto send them? What kind of train are we going to use?\u201d It was another camp not far from there,\ncalled Compiegne, which was also the same kind. So... there is a man, who came here in\nLexington, a Jewish man, who gave something... I\u2019ve got something, I will remember his name.\nAnd he explained what the German did have in mind. And it\u2019s amazing the way they did\norganize the whole thing. Even it was a lot of Jewish people, put together in a train, they didn\u2019t\nknow nothing, from where they come, what they going to do, where they going to go.\n6\nEverything was real on paper. The train company didn\u2019t know what they were going to\ntransport, because it was special train for animals. So, it was so well organized, and they\nprepared all this and from each country it was the same thing. From Poland it was another way.\nFrom Yugoslavia it was another way. From Austria it was another way. It was really a\ntechnique they did have. And the top of those guys, I\u2019m afraid to say he was a brain, because he\nwas crazy. But his name was Himmler, and he organized the whole thing. And he organized\nthis very well. And you know, the Jewish people who\u2019ve been in camp, most of them were, what\nwe call here blue-collar, simple people. They didn\u2019t think we\u2019re going to kill them. Even until\nthey arrive in the camp, when they say, the SS was on, say, one side, \u201cYou go this way, you go\nthis way.\u201d No, it was nothing. The only time my brother realized he was in a bad direction 1s\nwhen one time, coming down from the train, he didn\u2019t go fast enough. The SS slapped his face.\nAnd he was nineteen years old. Then he realized something is going to happen, now it\u2019s another\nworld. But until then, well 1t was hard, they didn\u2019t have anything to eat in the train. They didn\u2019t\nhave any water. They didn\u2019t have any... but it\u2019s going to clear up, no problem. They didn\u2019t\nrealize they go to the butcher. They go to die, by thousands. And this was the life. They did go,\nbecause the only one who realize what\u2019s going on were the educated people, the attorney, the\ndoctor, the people who did study. But they were not many people. When my brother was\ndeported in Auschwitz, it was a guy with him, who was, I think he was a colonel in the French\narmy. And he said, \u201cThey are going to do nothing to me. I\u2019m a colonel from the French army.\u201d\nHe died like all the one, just because he was Jew. That\u2019s all. They didn\u2019t care he was a colonel.\nHe did have a high education. Doesn\u2019t make any difference. You are Jew, you must die. It\u2019s\namazing, eh? But...",
        "A: Yes, we did have the possibility to go around the camp, Private Honor (ph) from Haus (ph) let us\nin and we could communicate by sign. So we can see they are alive, because in Drancy they\ndidn\u2019t kill anybody. They been starving. They even allowed to receive some package of food.\nBut like I said, 1t was not a long time, but communicate mouth to mouth? No, it was impossible.\nNo German in Drancy just the French military and the police. No SS, no German, the whole\ncamp was under the surveillance of the French police.",
        "A: It\u2019s very hard for me to remember. It\u2019s very hard, because like I said, I was eight, nine year. No,\nI have a hard time to remember the reaction of my father, the reaction of my mother. No, I don\u2019t\nhave any recollection.",
        "A: Well, you have to remember, my parent were not very high educated people. My mother did\nbarely write. She spoke mostly the language, but she didn\u2019t speak the... but 1t was, it was\nsomething. You have to remember my parent left Russia because of the Bolshevism. My parent\nwere three hundred percent for the idea of communism. So, they were with one track mind. So\npolitically, even if I could remember, I don\u2019t think it would be accurate, because they were too\nmuch in one way. I couldn\u2019t have any discussion. Even my brother, who is alive now, I can,\n7\nsome conversation about politic I cannot have with him, because he is still in one track. Very\nhard to discuss about politic. And again, like I said before, France is his country. It\u2019s the best\nplace, why should I go in America?\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n8\nTape 1, Side B",
        "A: No, they, my parent, neither my mother, neither my father, didn\u2019t discuss with the children.\nWe\u2019d been raised with a lot of authority from my folks. And they say, \u201cThis is an emergency;\nwe have to go.\u201d So my father is going to go there. We are going to go there. And we\u2019ll see how\nit is going to be. And we\u2019ll decide day by day, because it was no other way. We have to leave\neverything. Everything we got lost. We left with too little luggage and that\u2019s it, because we\nknew we never going to see anything we left. Because it was the end. We try to save our life,\nthat\u2019s all. So another time for me and like my two other brother were in Drancy, so it was only\nanother brother and me, so it was a little bit easier. So, my father left with my other brother,\nGaston, and I stay with my mother. And at the time it was, Paris became very, very difficult. No\nplace to hide, so my mother send me through the Zone. It was a line between the North and\nSouth and you have to pass the Zone. And some French people for money, they direct you\nbetween the army. And I did go in South in Grenoble. And when I arrive in Grenoble, a friend\nof my mother took me and three days later she came down. And we stay... and I don\u2019t remember\nhow long, maybe couple months, three months. And it became very dangerous to stay there. So,\nshe send me to my father. And where my father was, was more dangerous than there, so they\ndecide... I came back to see my mother and my mother, remember I was nine years old. So, they\ndecide to send me to Switzerland with a group of Jewish people, boys. And I think I was the\noldest one from all the boys. We were about fourteen, fifteen. So, we did go in one little town,\njust to the frontier, slept there until midnight, one o\u2019clock in the morning. Then two men took\nus, make us walk and we arrive on the border. The Swiss took us and put us in a refugee camp.",
        "A: No after, right after, because it was very, they realized now that\u2019s it. If we don\u2019t do something,\nthey are going to take us and we\u2019re going to go to Auschwitz. So, probably my parents said, let\u2019s\nsave there two boys and we\u2019ll see.",
        "A: No. No. No, we didn\u2019t know. No, I don\u2019t think I knew something. We knew about Drancy\nbecause I did go to Drancy with my mother just to see from far away my brother. But we didn\u2019t\nknow anything about the camp where they burn cadaver, where they put them in a chamber and\nput gas. We didn\u2019t know all this. No.",
        "A: Oh, the first restriction was to carry the yellow badge. We did have a yellow star, the Jewish\nstar, with inside \u201cJew\u201d and you have to carry this in anything you wear. So, you did have two\nway, either you don\u2019t carry this thing and if they catch you, they kill you right there, or if you\n9\nhave one, everybody can see you. And this was only in the north of France, in Paris. So this is\nwhy my mother decided to let us go down in south, because it was, I remember when they start\nto give us this yellow badge to carry. In the street I used to live, it was a man, who was very old,\nmaybe eighty-five, ninety and he was blind, Jewish. And he carried this yellow thing and I\nthought to myself, this is terrible, because if you can treat a human being, because of religion,\nit\u2019s really the end. And this 1s, I think where my mother decided to send me, because, you know,\nit\u2019s so easy. It\u2019s very hard to explain how does it look. How do you realize a park, like here,\nRupp Arena, downtown, with all the door closed, only one open and you push all the Jew inside.\nAnd it was, I don\u2019t know, maybe five hundred thousand, six hundred thousand. I don\u2019t know...\nall there. And from there, they start to spread group. And this was the beginning of the end. So,\nit was time to do something, leave, hide and this is where I think they organized this, my mother\nand my father.",
        "A: I found out my mother was a captain from the French army. Since when, I don\u2019t know. When I\nwas in Grenoble, this is where I realized what she was doing, because I never saw my mother\nwith a gun. And one day, she did have a big book, she always carry with her. And I said, why\ndo you carry this book? And she said, well, I will show you, but you forget about what you are\ngoing to see. She opened the book and it was cut and it was a gun inside. Because she used to\nbring food to Resistance who had been caught and put into the hospital. And she survived the\nwhole thing, because she die after the war, with... So, yes she belonged to a group, but...",

They didn\u2019t have any uniform, but\nthey been working to liberate France under the order of Charles de Gaulle, who was in England.\nSo, they been listening to the radio at night for special message.

But it was in 1944. This is\nwhere she went... and I, we were a little bit surprised, because when we... when they took us to\nthe frontier at Switzerland, two military from Swiss did have the gun and say, \u201cApproach the\ndoor.\u201d And I don\u2019t know if you know it, but the Swiss soldier are dressed exactly like the\n10\nGerman soldier. Green with the same helmet. And I thought to myself, \u201cThat\u2019s it, they got us.\u201d\nThe only difference, they got button who say Switzerland. And with the light, I saw the button\nand I said, \u201cUh huh, maybe we got a chance,\u201d but otherwise they look exactly like the German.\nAnd they put us in the camp. A lot of people... they did have to put us ina camp. For one\nreason is because, a lot of people left France to go to Switzerland, but the Swiss didn\u2019t know who\nthey was. So, before, they did the same thing, they put them in a camp and ask questions.\nInterrogate them. And from there, they put me in another camp of children. And from there, you\ndid have a lot of family from Switzerland who said, \u201cI can take one or two boy in my home. I\nhave the room.\u201d And this is how I did go to this priest, who was, not Catholic, he was...",

A word like summertime\nor something like this. And this lady came to me and said \u201cSummertime,\u201d and I said okay. And\nI did go with her. I didn\u2019t have any luggage.

I believe we don\u2019t die. The\nbody die, but the spirit stay alive. So, I said, the worst can happen to me, they going to get my\nbody, but my spirit is going to be reborn 1n another corp. This helped me a lot by making me\nfeel more secure. And dying, I never been afraid of dying. It\u2019s not a problem for me. I felt what\nshould happen, will happen.

And they felt something,\nprobably. The German come in, they say, \u201cWho is this boy?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s with us.\u201d And it was\nfinished. And they left. I remember the whole thing from Paris to Grenoble like it was\nyesterday. I could recognize the face of the German soldier. But it was, no it was not a game. I\nrealized it was very serious, but when everybody dance, you have to dance. And I thought if I\ndon\u2019t survive, no problem.",
        "A: A lady, and I don\u2019t remember this lady, because I didn\u2019t see her long enough. She took me to a\ngroup of people. I stay with this group ina room. I stay about a day or two.

        "A: No, no. He never been, at this time he never been with me. The only time I saw him again, is\nwhen the war finished, I was with Mr. Lederman in Switzerland. And I said, \u201cNow it\u2019s time for\nme to go home.\u201d And he say, \u201cPatience,\u201d you know, \u201clet\u2019s wait a little bit.\u201d\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I\nknow where we\u2019re going to find... I know where I\u2019m going to find my mother.\u201d And he said,\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to wait a little bit?\u201d Because it was a lot of thing going on. And I said, \u201cNo,\nno, I would like to go now.\u201d So, he was a little bit reluctant to let me go, but he let me go. And I\ndid go to Grenoble, from Switzerland to Grenoble where my mother used to live. And I didn\u2019t\n16\nfind her. So, I did go to, there was a Jewish association in Grenoble, so I did go there. And they\nsaid they knew about my mother. They said, \u201cNo, she did go back to Paris and her sister\napartment, because her apartment was with people, with your brother, Gaston.\u201d I said, \u201cHow\ncan I go?\u201d And they asked me, \u201cDo you have money? We\u2019ll buy you a ticket.\u201d They bought me\na ticket, train again. And I did go to Paris. And when I did go to the train in Grenoble, I met a\nyoung soldier, French soldier and I did the whole travel with him. He took care of me. And\nbefore we left, this lady from the Jewish association sent a wire to my mother and when I arrive\nin the train station in Paris, my mother and Gaston were there waiting for me. And we did go\nsee, we did go to the apartment of her sister, who die in Auschwitz and it was nobody in the\napartment. It was a very small apartment and oh, maybe... time for me is very hard... maybe two\nmonths later or three months later, the Jewish people from the camp, from Auschwitz, Dachau,\nBuchenwald, all those places, start to come back in Paris. And it was a big hotel, called Hotel\nLutecia (ph) prepare for clean them, to ask paper, if they got anything, you know. And Hotel\nLutecia call us and say we have one Pressman. So, we did go there right away and it was\nBernard. But we couldn\u2019t see him. We didn\u2019t know where he was. So, we wait, go, ask,\ncouldn\u2019t find him. The next day... so, we did go home at this apartment and the next day we\nreceive a man, who said, \u201cYour son did go to the old apartment,\u201d who was let\u2019s say like, five\nblocks from where we were. So, we did go by foot, walking and here, is coming, my brother.\nThis is where we find out my other brother was dead. He was killed in Auschwitz. And Bernard\nwas alive. Then we did go to the apartment of my aunt, sister of my mother, and life started to\nre-organize. We want to recuperate the fabric of my father. Everything was gone, but at least\nthe wall was there and my brother decided to\u2014because he was trained by my father\u2014to open the\nplace. And with my mother, they start to re-open the place and I started to go to college, to\nschool, to school first. And after I decided to go to college. And it was a little fight, family\nfight, because they want me to be an upholsterer like my father and I said no, I want to study\nmedicine. Everybody said, \u201cBut we cannot help you,\u201d and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t ask for help. I will\nwork myself.\u201d I found a little room and I was working, doing a lot of things and studying\nmedicine. After this, I became the doctor of the family. [Laughing]",
        "A: Uh huh. Yeah, it was a very, very interesting. I think I wouldn\u2019t study all the study I did, if I\ndidn\u2019t go with Pastor Lederman and his wife. Because I speak always about him. His name was\nCharles, but his wife was something great. I mean, she was a teacher in school for children, but\nshe was a very, very strong person. And when they accept me, I receive a tag around my neck.\nThey put me again in another train from Geneva to, it\u2019s a little town where they used to live,\nRances. Very small town. He was the pastor of the town. And they came and picked me up. I\ndidn\u2019t know where I was. Mine parrain, my godfather was very, very cheerful, very big open\nmind, very smart man. They were a very nice couple, but they never could have any children.\nSo, mine godfather was priest, so he said, \u201cYou going to go to the synagogue.\u201d And I said, \u201cI\nnever been to a synagogue and I don\u2019t want to go to a synagogue.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re\nJewish, you\u2019re going to go to the synagogue.\u201d So, every week I did have to go and it was far\naway, because there was no synagogue where he was. So, I did have to take the bus and I didn\u2019t\nlike it all. But he said, \u201cNo, you have a wonderful religion, you have to keep with it. Okay.\nAnd I don\u2019t want for you, unless you feel, but you don\u2019t have no obligation to come in my\n17\nchurch. If you want to come, no problem, but I don\u2019t want you...\u201d And I said, \u201cCan I ring the\nbell?\u201d And he said, \u201cIf you want to, Sunday morning you can ring the bell.\u201d So, I ring the bell\nand he introduce me in a Sunday, when I was at his place. The second Sunday he introduce me\nto all the congregation. Swiss people are very, very nice people. And they treat me like the son\nof the house. They give me aroom. I remember they did have a German Shepherd, who was\ntrained. He was in the same time\u2014I don\u2019t know how you call this\u2014a priest who take care of\nprison people. And he used to go with his dog, in case one of the prisoner did go away, the dog\nis going to be able... He was a very, very funny man, very smart, very funny man. And I help as\nmuch as I could. I carry the milk, because they did have a lot of cow. So, I work outside of the\nschool for three, four hour every day, carrying the milk from the cow to the company where they\nmake the cheese. And it was really, a family. They want me to learn how to play piano. They\ndid have a piano. And since I have my own piano and I play because of them. He always, he\nmake me feel something I never felt before: the importance of knowledge. And this is when I\nstart to read, this is when I start to write. I spend with them less than one year, but I think the\nfoundation of my life was based on this time I spend with them, because they were so good and\nso hard. They were not... they were sweet, but they let me pass nothing. I did have my job to do\nand I better do it, otherwise... And it became normal with me and really I spend... I learn how to\nlove nature. Nature in Paris, you don\u2019t know how to differentiate champignon...you know\nwhat...?",
        "A: Mushrooms. He took me to the woods, days, to say this one is not good, this one is good. Took\nthe good one, brought it home, cook them, make a meal with it. I didn\u2019t know all this. I didn\u2019t\nhave no idea. And it was very good for me, because it was a foundation of life. And every time\nup to this day, I think all the time about what they did to me as a kid. And I became a man\nbecause of them. And this is why, all the time, even like I said, I did go see them last, between\n\u201898 and \u201899, Christmas. And I couldn\u2019t find them, they moved. I called everywhere. But\notherwise, every time I go to Europe, I go see them. We spend beautiful time, quality time, even\nif we don\u2019t speak together, he is the same. And she is the same. In my mind, she is the most\nbeautiful woman I met in my life. She, the last time I saw her I think she was seventy-two and I\nthink she was as beautiful as she was when I was a little boy. And he is the stronger man. It was\nreally something. For me, it was a big chance to meet those people. And like I said, when I did\ngo back and I found my mother. I said, \u201cThe first thing we can do, as soon as we get a little bit\nmoney, I want for you to meet.\u201d And I think it was one year later, I bought a used car and I took\nmy mother and we did go see them. And they were very happy and I was very happy to see them\nagain. And like I said, I always, any chance that I did have to go, I did go see them, because I\nfelt this... we were not family, but 1t was more than family. It was a good, a good thing. It\u2019s a\ngood memory.",
        "A: Yes. Oh, gosh. Life is irony, the whole life. When.... you know, when you become old, older\nthan younger, life is an irony. Why this happened? What is the purpose of life? What is the\nreason of life? We don\u2019t know. But I think everything is written, you in your life, another one in\nanother life, everything is written. I say since a long time, we all have a ticket in the pocket.\n18\nYou have the date of birth and there is no date where you\u2019re going to go, to be gone, but really\nthere is one, but you don\u2019t know it. And it\u2019s funny, because I say to a lot of my patients, we\ncelebrate birth of people, but we don\u2019t celebrate death and death is something of life. It\u2019s the end\nof life. If you did have a bad life, you\u2019re going to have a bad time to re-incarnate in a good life.\nBut if you look your life and you said yes, I did have bad time like everybody else, but the good\ntime were good. And when I remember all this, all the good time, it was wonderful. It\u2019s\nexperience. And in life, you cannot have all the time, good time. And on top of this, I say this\ntoo, some of my good patient with whom I have a good exchange, money is important, but\ncompared to destiny, money is nothing. Destiny is what is going to make you what you are.\nYou are going to be able to enjoy anything: a fruit, a good meal, good company. And when I say\ngood company, feeling you are with somebody, friends, and you are on the same level. You can\nexchange... if you say something a little bit different, people are not going to laugh. They are\ngoing to say either \u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201d or they\u2019re going to say, \u201cI know what you\nmean. I feel it, what you feel.\u201d And this is the purpose of life, but it\u2019s not every day you find\nthings like this and it\u2019s not every day you are in tune with things. But when you are, it\u2019s\nwonderful and the rest, well, you have to do with. You receive a bad bill, you have a bad\nproblem, you have a flat tire in the middle of nowhere... it\u2019s tough, but you have to deal with it.\nYou say, okay, I will remember next time I\u2019m going to have a good time, this flat tire. It was\nbad, but in exchange look what good time I got now. And I think it\u2019s a good philosophy.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And it\u2019s very hard, maybe it\u2019s because as a Jewish boy I can say this. You know,\nJewish people accept Jewish jokes from another Jew, but if another one does the jokes, they\ndon\u2019t like it. Did the Jewish people deserve what happened? I don\u2019t think so. Nobody deserve\nto suffer this way, but in the whole world, in the whole idea of human people, is it something\nwho 1s going to serve humanity? I think so. I think so. How many people, who were in\nAuschwitz, in all those camps, are going to be able to use it? Minority. But the one who are\ngoing to be able to do it are going to bring something and we don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to\nput this. On the newborn? There is a new book, written by a Rabbi, and people don\u2019t like him\nvery much, because he write, he wrote this book about reincarnation. And he said a lot of people\ncall him, write to him and they say, \u201cI\u2019m born in a Catholic family. I\u2019m Catholic. I go to the\nchurch every Sunday. I believe on Jesus Christ and I believe in God, but inside of me I got this\nJewish feeling and I don\u2019t understand why.\u201d And it\u2019s uh, how can I say, it\u2019s surprising. And\nfrom what he say, he thinks they were in the Holocaust and they reincarnate in another corps, but\nthey got this knowledge and they want to explain this. Long time ago, maybe not so long, but\ntwenty years ago, you never spoke about reincarnation. A lot of people knew about, but they\ndon\u2019t want to say anything, because they say, \u201cWell, they going to think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d Now it is\nmore open. Sometime when I feel people react and it\u2019s a small group... I give a lot of lecture on\nacupuncture, and acupuncture related to the human body and the illness of some people. And I\ngo a little bit further and reincarnation and a lot of people react and say, \u201cI felt this. I felt I was\nin another life. I cannot pinpoint, but I know this is not my first life.\u201d So, I think, coming back\nto the idea of the Holocaust, it served a purpose, which one, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m sure it serve\na purpose. If you say this to my brother, he\u2019s going to laugh for three hour, but it\u2019s okay. And I\n19\nmean, it\u2019s his problem, it\u2019s not mine. I don\u2019t bring any proof, but I know there is a purpose. Can\nit be another Holocaust? Yes. The same one we saw? No. It\u2019s going to be something\ncompletely different, but Hell is here on earth, so anything can happen. Anything.",
        "A: To answer your question you have to read a little bit about Hitler, which very few Jewish people\nwant to touch. I read the life of Hitler. He didn\u2019t have any chance in life. He could not succeed\nto nothing. He was nobody. He came at the right time and somebody above used him. But he\nwas nothing. Are we going to remember Hitler? Yes, for a long time, but not for the real\npurpose. Because who was Hitler? Nothing. Germany was ready. Germany need somebody\nlike Hitler and if it was Hitler or George or anybody else, it would be the same thing. We speak\nabout the devil. Germany, the German people at this time, did find the chief of the devil and\neverything was so simple to organize. You see in life, people who try to organize something,\nsomething small, a factory... they never make it. Because it\u2019s not the time and somebody above\nEarth, who\u2019s got the little button, don\u2019t push the button, say, because it\u2019s not for him. It\u2019s not\nmeant to happen, not with him. So we are not going to move.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Because the whole story like, and I don\u2019t... Rothschild said something\none day, \u201cFor you Jewish people if you like it or not, this is the truth. You have the low level\nJewish people, you have the middle level Jewish people and you have the aristocratic Jewish\npeople.\u201d And it\u2019s true. All the Jew are so smart, all the Jew are doctor? No. What about the\nJew who is a fireman? What about the Jew who 1s a police man? He\u2019s got the brain of\nRothschild? No. We did have, I mean... we, they did have to show to humanity Jewish people\nare not the enemy. Because, example, Israel, you have prostitute in Israel. Jewish woman who\nare prostitute? You say this to my father, if he was alive at the time, there are Jewish prostitute?\nHe would say, \u201cNever. Woman, Jewish woman never can be a prostitute.\u201d Yes my dear, there\nare Jewish prostitute. You have lot of people in Israel who are crooked. We are people and this\nshould stop racism. And when you speak with... all black people are stupid? No. You have a\nlot of black people who are born in poor family. They don\u2019t know what is good from bad. They\nhave a father, but they don\u2019t know who he is. And you compare this black man with a judge\nfrom the high circuit, who judge things? How can you? They are two black people. With\nJewish people it is the same thing. This is why I think the Holocaust was made, one of the\nreasons in my mind, to show we are people. There are good Jew and you have bad Jew.",

        "A: Human race like atrocity. When they are... let\u2019s say you are on the road and there is a bad\naccident. I stop. Iam a doctor. If I can help, I will do it. But I don\u2019t want to stop to see\nsomebody bleeding, just for the pleasure. You have a crash of a plane. There was one big one in\nParis a long time ago. Everybody come because somebody told them you can see a leg here and\na head there. And in your normal mind you are going to say, \u201cOh, this is terrible.\u201d But when\nyou speak with people, they love to see this. Why do you think they show so bad thing on TV?\nBecause people like it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very good thing to show all this... it\u2019s terrible. They\nlike it. When you see all this blood going out, this head split, the eyes fall down. They like it.\nPeople are mean [laughing] sometime, but this 1s the way we are, and I think the Holocaust\nhelped this, to show, you know... they did this, can we see a little bit...?\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\n21\nTape 2, Side B",
        "A: I have a friend, he was an attorney and he raised his child, his boy, in the religion. Not... but, he\nraised him as a Jewish boy. And the boy 1s a spoiled, what I called a spoiled American boy.\nAnd his father insists for him to go to Washington to see the Holocaust museum. And he said,\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to go there.\u201d He said, \u201cI insist, I want for you to go see a little bit of what did\nhappen.\u201d And I said, \u201cSo?\u201d when he came back. And he said, \u201cWell, he was not the same. He\ndidn\u2019t have no idea. He heard Holocaust. He knew it was a museum at Washington, but he said,\n\u2018It\u2019s a museum.\u2019 But when he came back, it was not a joke. He said, \u2018I didn\u2019t know it was like\nthis.\u2019\u201d And I think this is why there is a museum. This is why you have people working in the\nHolocaust, not to forget. Not to enjoy, but not to forget, for young people, Jew or Non-Jew,\nanybody, to see: This happened. This is not a movie. This happened, so you have to remember\nto do anything you can, we can, not to happen again.",
        "A: Yes, they do, absolutely. If they know what\u2019s going on. Because if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s\ngoing on... When you see a movie and you know it\u2019s fiction, if you see it or you don\u2019t, it\u2019s not a\nproblem. But when things happen... I have a movie from the camp. This camp was liberated by\nthe English army and the English are very tough. They show, they took the whole, bigger than a\nvillage, I think it was about fifteen, twenty thousand people. And they opened where they put all\nthe dead, the cadaver, the Jewish people who they killed, they opened this with a special machine\nand they forced every people living in the town to carry a dead body and put it on the truck to\ngive them a decent burial. Don\u2019t you think they are going to remember? Yes, they will.\nBecause when you touch with your hand, a dead body, you remember for the rest of your life.\nAnd if we could make people touch people or nothing else, force the youth to go to a hospital\nhere, in Lexington, Louisville, anyplace, once an hour, every week and just walk and see people\nsuffering, they are going to be a little bit different. American youth think they are indestructible,\nyou know? They got the power. They can do anything until they die. This is why you have so\nmany people who cripple themselves. They jump from, with a cord around their feet, you\nknow... \u201cI\u2019m the best,\u201d you know, the guy who jump with the motorcycle in Colorado. Okay, if\nthe guy survive, it\u2019s okay, if he die, everybody should see it, because life is not a joke. Life is a\ngift. You can use it badly and you can use it intelligently, but just by jumping and so you see...\nit\u2019s like the guy who jumped from the Eiffel Tower and he say, \u201cNothing can happen to me.\u201d\nAnd you know, he fall down and every stage, he say, \u201cYou see, nothing happened to me,\u201d until\nhe reach the downstairs and then that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t... gravity is like life, you don\u2019t play game\nwith life. Take a knife, stick 1t in your stomach and you\u2019ll see what happen. And everybody\nshould know about the Holocaust just as a reminder. Justice in this country 1s too lenient.\nYesterday they liberate a man, who did abuse children. He got ten year and after five year, they\nlet him go. He\u2019s going to do it again. What should we do? This is another discussion, but don\u2019t\nlet him loose, because he\u2019s going to take care... he\u2019s going to take another innocent child. This\nman is sick. We have to do something about this. But don\u2019t say, \u201cWell, you know, what can we\n22\ndo?\u201d What do you mean, what can we do? Let\u2019s us do the best we can, but do something.\nDon\u2019t let a man wild with normal people.",

It was really very hard,\nbut like I said before, it was all kind of people. You did have bad people. You did have all kind\nof people. So they couldn\u2019t do otherwise. But by the date, you realize it was not a long time, it\nwas maybe two months. After what I saw before, two month for me was nothing. Because like I\nsaid, after this, life was great with Pastor Lederman. So, it was an experience again. For me,\neverything is an experience.

So, it was hard and they did have too much people. So, they tried\nto push away all the people, until the last two or three weeks, the Swiss Army was on the border.\nAnd then anybody who wants to cross, they shoot them.

But at my age, nine years old, you put me in\na school to learn about mathematic and all this. I don\u2019t care. I want to know, where 1s my\nbrother, where is my mother?

The time was very good, I\nmean everything was... it was nothing, I can\u2019t say they were mean. The only time he was mad at\nme is one day, I touch his gun. He did have a gun and I touched it. And he was mad. He said,\n\u201cLet me show you how dangerous it is.\u201d And he shot something in the room and boy, I never\ntouch his gun again. [Laughing] They were very nice.

Example, when I came to study chiropractic in the United States...\nI was married at the time and my daughter was eighteen months old. And she didn\u2019t understand\nwhy I took my daughter with me instead of leaving my daughter with her for two year. And I\nsaid, I don\u2019t know how you can think about me leaving my daughter for two year, eighteen\nmonth? I\u2019m never going to be her father anymore. So, we did have a very, very big discussion\nabout this and for the time I was gone, she never spoke to me. And my brother, Bernard, reunite\nus when I came back. But the problem 1s, I was at the time, as stubborn as she was. And we\nwere always on challenge. I like her, I would do anything for her, but I couldn\u2019t receive any\norder from her. And it\u2019s a feeling very hard to explain, because like when I open my office... she\ncame in. She wants to organize my office. And I said, \u201cMother, it\u2019s my office, it\u2019s my place and\n27\nI\u2019m going to organize it my way. You like it, you come. You don\u2019t like it, 1t\u2019s too bad.\u201d But\nuntil the end, she wants to be the boss. [Laughing.] And she never could, because probably we\nwere the same way, you know? But so the relation was not, I saw my mother, jump on her, kiss\nher? No. And my mother was not a kisser. One kiss a week was the top, no more. So she stay\nin her, in her back, and I stay, and my other brother, Gaston, is... 1t was, is and was a very funny\ncharacter. He looks good and it was enough for him. So, he was thinking more to buy nice suit,\nnice thing. And when I came back he was a growing man and you know, he didn\u2019t want to\nbother with me. I was the little boy. So, the relation was short.\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n28\nTape 3, Side A",
        "A: Not specifically, because I think I knew my mother since a long time, since I was very little, I\nmean when I was eight, nine years old, we did have very serious question to ask to each other.\nAnd I think basically we didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t have, she didn\u2019t have any secret from me, so I was not\nsurprised and not shocked to see what she was doing. And she was doing this very naturally. I\nmean, she didn\u2019t show off. It was what she was doing and that\u2019s all. But it was not something...\na big surprise for me. I never been afraid of gun. I never been excited over gun, but I\nunderstood. The question... it was no question in my mind. It was a normal way of life,\nknowing what she was doing before. And it was, to me, a normal situation.",
        "A: Before she used to go, at the time when she was in Grenoble, in south of France, she used to go\nand bring food, letter, visit French Resistance in the hospital. And those people were guarded by\nGerman. And she always found a way to go in, bring what she did have to bring. She did a lot\nof risky things, but the natural way. So, knowing this, after this, knowing she was carrying a\ngun, didn\u2019t surprise me.",
        "A: Well, it took me a long time before I could train myself. I have now thirty year of martial art\nbehind me. I always felt in general, the Jewish people don\u2019t like gun, don\u2019t like to fight. I mean\nI speak about the Jewish people in France. And it was a discovery for, I think, every Jewish\npeople in the world when we found out Israelian soldier were one of the best in the world. And I\nwas not surprised, I was happy about, but generally, even up to this date, when you speak gun\nwith Jewish people they don\u2019t like it. Jewish people in general are not fighter, unless you go in\nIsrael and they did what they did. And this is why I always felt very secure, and when I was with\nmy godfather in Switzerland, I did like to have this gun close to me. But it was very hard for me\nto explain to him why. I always felt like if anything happened, maybe I\u2019m going to die, but I\u2019m\n29\ngoing to defend myself. I don\u2019t want to die like a poor animal. I want to die, but before I\u2019m\ngoing to die, somebody else is going to die, too. It was my feeling since a long time. I was in\nvery big contradiction with my brothers, but something I have to say... even I knew my father\nvery little, my father used to carry all the time a gun. I didn\u2019t know why and I couldn\u2019t ask the\nquestion, because I don\u2019t think he would answer, but this is something I remember. And maybe\nit\u2019s because of this I always... But basically in my mind I think the reason I always like gun is\nbecause gun, you can defend yourself, without a gun, you dead.",
        "A: Yeah, absolutely, yeah.",
        "A: Exactly. Because my mother never touch gun before. I never saw, before the war, my mother\nwith a gun. But when I saw her with a gun, it makes sense to me. From where we come... it\u2019s\nfunny because we were four, five brother and we were so different. The only one I know the\nbest is the one who stay alive now. And he is so different, like I said in the tape before and he\u2019s\nnot a fighter. He\u2019s a good man. He\u2019s not a fighter, and the only reason he came back is because\nhe was lucky. And you can... you know, in front of so many SS or Nazi in the camp, you don\u2019t\nhave a... 1f they decide to kill you, they will kill you anytime they want. So when he came back,\nhe came back because he was lucky. But my brother was not a fighter and I am a fighter. Like I\ntold him many time, if I was in a camp, if they took me in Auschwitz, I wouldn\u2019t survive an\nhour. They would kill me right away. But the same idea, they would kill me, but I would kill\nsomebody before I die.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s always... was bad feeling for me, to see, like when in Paris they put together all the\nJew in one big field, closed completely. It was hard for me later, to understand why they didn\u2019t\ndo something. Why didn\u2019t they organize? The only time they organized themselves and most of\nthem time it was Polish Jew, it was in the ghetto of Warsaw. This is where they organize, they\nfight, because they say die for die. We going to fight. But in France, no, because again we come\nback to the same idea, all the Jewish people from France said, \u201cI\u2019m not Jewish, I\u2019m French,\nJewish is my religion,\u201d which was true on the basic. But the German said, \u201cNo, you Jew.\nFrench Jew, German Jew, Italian Jew, you are Jew, you have to die.\u201d",
        "A: Well, everything changed when I saw they arrest everybody, young, old people. And they arrest\nthem just because they were Jew. And to me it didn\u2019t make any sense. This is when I start to\nrealize, I\u2019m not French, I\u2019m not American, I\u2019m not Russian, I\u2019m Jew. This 1s the only reason.\n30\nI\u2019m born Jew, so they want to kill me, that\u2019s all. Like I told you before, look up to this day, what\nhappened last week. This guy, who did go in California and kill Jew just because he doesn\u2019t like\nJew. And this is when I said to the American Jew, maybe you are an American, but before\neverything you are Jewish. And they are going to kill you, not because you are an American,\nbecause you are Jew.",
        "A: Oh yeah, all the time, all the time, because number one, I don\u2019t go to the synagogue. I don\u2019t go\nto the Temple. I, like I say to a lot of Jew, I\u2019m Jewish by tradition. I\u2019m not Jew by religion.\nAnd when we speak about, I mean the way the Jewish people are here, they make it easy for\nthem. They separate the traditional Jew, the Reformed Jew, and for me this make less sense than\nthe rest of it. But sure, they don\u2019t... when I arrive here in the beginning, I did go to the\nsynagogue to explain what was life in Europe. And a lot of people were laughing because they\nthought I was telling story. So, I quit going and they ask me why I don\u2019t join synagogue. And I\nsaid, I never join synagogue in France, why should I join a synagogue here on top of this? This\nfor me is not a synagogue. This is ajoke. You know, Saturdays is the Shabbat. Saturday Jewish\npeople don\u2019t touch money, so we hire Catholic people to play the music, to clean the place,\nbecause we cannot work, because we cannot sing, it\u2019s against the law of the Jewish Torah. It\ndoesn\u2019t make sense.",
        "A: Holocaust, the way they arrest us, the way, even up to this day, you don\u2019t say you\u2019re Jewish.\nWell, my name is Pressman, Pressman in France is Jewish. Goldman, Pellman, this is Jewish.\nPeople ask me, well Pressman is German? I say no, this is a Jewish name. But we have to be\ncareful even up to this day. And I don\u2019t speak about Germany. If you go to Germany and your\nname is Pressman, they don\u2019t speak to you. And a lot of people said to me when I was in\nEurope, they say, \u201cOh, this is finished.\u201d And one day, a guy did go to Germany, Jewish man and\nhe said openly to people, you know, \u201cI\u2019m Jewish.\u201d Nobody talked to him after all. They didn\u2019t\nwant to have anything to do with him. Anti-Semitism in Germany 1s as strong as it 1s now as it\nwas before, the same way.",
        "A: Well we came back, we got together... This is where, like I told you the last time, my brother, we\nfound out he came back from Auschwitz. So, he was alive. And we got the apartment, which\nwas a very small apartment. It was a two room apartment for my aunt. And we did go in and we\n31\nstart to try to get back the apartment we used to have before we left. And we got it back. My\nfather was an upholsterer and he did have a factory, very small, but a little factory. We got it\nback, too.",
        "A: You mean...?",
        "A: His name was Joseph Pressman, underneath it was Tapissier. Upholsterer. And it was in the\nsame street where we did have this apartment. So my brother, who came from Auschwitz, who\ndid have a lot of training with my father, did reopen this and start to work again. And I was\nthirteen years old and I did go back to school, college. And when I graduate from college, my\nbrother wants for me to go and work with him on the . And I said, \u201cNo, I\nwant to study medicine.\u201d This was the joke of the day, because why should I become a doctor?\nWhat... so, my brother, like I said, is a nice man, tried to help me as much as he could. And he\nhelped me, but basically the whole family, cut a little bit between them and I, because what I\nwould like to do, it was silly. For them it didn\u2019t make any sense. The only time they realize it\nwas true, is when I graduate from medical school. And they said, \u201cWell, he did it, with no help.\u201d\nI was working at night, and I was doing a lot of job. And during the day I did go to medical\nschool. And when I graduate, everybody was very happy and we celebrate. And meantime\nbefore I graduate, I got married with a Catholic girl, not Jewish. This didn\u2019t help mine relation\nwith my family. I got a little girl at the time and I was twenty-three years old. And I raised my\nlittle girl. I did have, like I said, a lot of job, but I was making a good living. And when it was, I\nthink it was, I practice for about three, four year in Paris and I decide I want to learn about the\nmechanic of the body. And this is where I came and find out about United State and Harvard, it\nwas a special course for the mechanic of the body. And I came by myself for two or three\nweeks. And this is where I found out, somebody told me about chiropractic. So, I did go to\nDavenport, Iowa, where I saw what was chiropractic. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t have any idea.\nAnd the first time I saw about chiropractic, I said \u201cThose people are crazy. Doesn\u2019t make any\nsense,\u201d you know, the spine, give an adjustment. And before I left they give me a book, which I\nhave even up to this day. And I did go back to France, read the book and I said, \u201cGosh, this\nmakes sense to me.\u201d So, I pack up all my thing, took my wife and daughter and came to the\nUnited State and did go to Davenport, Iowa, where they give me credit. And I study\nchiropractic, graduate in 1962. And came back to France in Paris and opened an office in Paris.\nAnd I start to practice medicine and chiropractic.",
        "A: Maybe I would say a couple year, or maybe less. But it was not long. It was very hard to live,\nthree men and my mother in a two room. It was...\n32",

And I thought I didn\u2019t want to be the fighter against the... like\nDon Quixote. And I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to bring me nothing. I better build my life, chose what\nI want to do and just go on.\u201d For the time being after the war, there were no danger anymore.\nSo I didn\u2019t think about the Holocaust, all the dead, why they die, how they die. Because of my\nbrother I knew a lot of things from inside. But I did try to be in a neutral position. I didn\u2019t want\nfor this to affect me. I registered the whole thing, but I put this aside and say I will bring it back\nwhen the time is going to be there. I don\u2019t know how other people do, but this was my way of\ndoing. So, I\u2019m not going to be bitter. I\u2019m not going to be all the time hungry, not hungry, angry.",

And like I said, my brother give us a lot of\ninformation, what happen to the camp. They was some fight, not fight, but my brother said a lot\nof secret things from the camp.

And I\u2019m going to tell you, you a liar. Because what\nhappened in camp, have nothing to do with this world. I told you this because you my mother,\nbut I don\u2019t try to... he said, \u201cI don\u2019t try to protect anybody. But you cannot judge us.\u201d And\nhmmm, to me it makes sense.",

And\nwhen you say this now, what is a piece of bread? Well, you got this piece of bread, you survive.\nYou don\u2019t have this piece of bread, you die. So, who are you people, to judge us, because\nsomebody stole a piece of bread off of somebody who was dying? Any way he will die. So the\nguy... and nobody said anything.

I thought I knew my brother, but I didn\u2019t know him. And I don\u2019t judge him, but we\nare so different. He takes things one way. I told him one day, \u201cI think you are a Buddhist.\u201d And\nhe said, \u201cWhy?\u201d I say, \u201cBecause Buddhist is not a religion, it 1s a way of life.

We didn\u2019t\ngo to the same school and we didn\u2019t see the same thing. So, I did go see friend of our age, my\nage, his age, and I ask question. He said, \u201cNo, your brother is different.

I spoke with him for an hour and I trying to\nexplain to him, how, what is technique of forgiveness. He was mad. He was so mad. And I\nsaid, \u201cUnderstand, forgiveness is not to forgive what they did, it\u2019s just to save yourself. When\nyou forgive them, at least you can breathe a little bit. Right now, every night you cry, you\nscream, because you are in the camp now. If you forgive, let them worry about their problem,\nbut get rid of it.\u201d What did I say? So, he send me, even two weeks ago he send me a book I\ncouldn\u2019t find here. And it is in French. I like to read in French. And on the side he wrote, \u201cTry\nto understand why I cannot forgive.\u201d We have two different way of thinking and until the last\nminute of his life he is going to cry and be mad, but he doesn\u2019t want to.

        "A: When I was in France, on my spare time when I was a student of medicine, I learn hypnosis. I\nwas very interested in hypnosis. I put a lady through surgery under hypnosis. And you have a\nlot of technique. And mainly this technique of forgiveness, which I didn\u2019t know before and I\nwas very happy to learn and practice this first on me. Every time I was mad at somebody or\nthings I didn\u2019t like, I did try to forgive the people I was speaking, I mean not openly, but in my\nmind. And this way it was easy for me to be able to discuss with people. Some people have a\nnatural way of being patient. I\u2019m not patient, so I did want to find something who is not going to\nmake me patient, but make me a normal human being. And those technique of forgiveness 1s\nso... we hear this in the Catholic religion. Forgive and God will forgive you. I always say to a\nlot of people, I don\u2019t need any church because if I have a problem, I speak with God directly. It\nis fifty percent joke and fifty percent true, it goes together. Because another human being like\nme, ah, how intelligent he can be? What can he do with God, I cannot do directly if I want to do\nit? And this forgiveness came back to me. And one day I was in a course of hypnosis and the\nteacher said, \u201cToday we\u2019re going to speak only about forgiveness.\u201d And I thought, God, this is\ngreat, and I learned every bit of it. And I practice this with me and with my patient. And it was\nwonderful, because people used to say, \u201cI didn\u2019t think this way before, but now it make it so\neasy.\u201d And I thought to myself, I know, because I practice the same way for myself. The more I\ncan forgive things, easy my life is, and I come back always to the point zero. If you let, 1f you do\na mistake and you go too far with this mistake, it\u2019s very... longer you keep with, harder it is to\ncome back. So, try to rectify the mistake as soon as you can, so this way it\u2019s going to be much\neasier to work on it and it\u2019s going to be quicker. So they teach you every time at night before\nyou, when you go to bed, before you go to sleep, try to go very fast on your day and say, \u201cOkay\nwhat happened today? What did I do that was not good?\u201d So you try to forget yourself by being\nsorry and said \u201cI\u2019m not going to do this any more. I\u2019m going to try to be better,\u201d and also vice\nand versa, one way or another way. It\u2019s amazing the way it works. It\u2019s something very simple.\nThe only thing is, if you are willing to do it, it\u2019s perfect. If you don\u2019t want to do it, it\u2019s very hard.\nAnd this is why, I try. I stay about two weeks with my brother. I said, \u201cBernard, I\u2019m sorry.\nYou\u2019re going to be mad, if you want to throw me out from your house, you do it. But every day\nI\u2019m going to speak to you about forgiveness, because this is your only savior.\u201d But he laugh, he\nbecame red sometime, he left the room, he took witness, friend. Okay, he took friend who\nthought like him. And you know, if you ask a friend, after all the story of the camp, he survive\nand he say, \u201cBloing (ph), face to face, can I forgive this?\u201d People say, \u201cNo.\u201d But this is not\nwhat I ask him. I don\u2019t ask him to forgive this way. I want for him to forgive them their fault,\nthey are the worst people. He is not a bad man. So forgive them for what they did to them and\nto you. But it was... I don\u2019t think... maybe I put a little something on the ground, but for him it\nis too late. And I think, it\u2019s not nice what I\u2019m going to say, but I think also he enjoy a little bit\nhis situation.\n35",
        "A: No. He enjoy to be, people feel sorry for him. And he likes this. I think so. But there 1s a lot of\npoint I cannot clarify with him, because I don\u2019t want to be pushy.

        "A: We cannot speak about that, so I cannot be pushy, because... The only thing I know, the only\nlittle thing, and he cannot hide this, because he said it.

And it was not very light, it was very\ndark. And one moment he was walking and he turn around and he sees this guy on his back all\nthe time. And he say, \u201cWhy do you follow me all the time like this?\u201d And he said, \u201cBut I\u2019m\nMaurice, I\u2019m your brother.\u201d He didn\u2019t recognize him. He was... and for me, my interpretation\nis, he was already gone. He put a wall. Not because... because the situation. He said, \u201cOkay,\nsave your life. I save mine.\u201d This is the way I felt it and this is the way I understood. Maybe\nI\u2019m wrong. I don\u2019t know. But this is the way I feel it. Because in any situation if you don\u2019t\nrecognize your brother, your sister, your mother, it\u2019s like what I said before.

Because you have to visualize,\nand I\u2019m good, I know how to visualize. And when you see the whole picture... a month ago I\nread about this man in United State, who help people to die.

But when you judge human being to do experience like rat, there\nis no end. I don\u2019t know why he said this and what is the basic idea. Maybe one day I am going\nto have the chance to speak with him. But what did he mean by this? In Germany, Der Spiegel\ndid an article of a doctor, who was a doctor in the camp Auschwitz. He\u2019s alive now. They made\nan interview and they asked the question, \u201cDo you feel guilty about what you did?\u201d Because\nthey did horrible experience. And he said, \u201cNo, I did my job.\u201d And people said, \u201cWhat do you\nmean by your job?\u201d He said, \u201cI was military. They put me in a camp, but I save a lot of Jew. I\nkill a lot, but I save a lot. And everything we did, helped for this generation.\u201d So, the question\nis, is he guilty? Is he not guilty? He sleeps every day. He doesn\u2019t have any problem. Is a\n36\nnormal human being able to sleep after killing healthy children, woman and man? It\u2019s a big\nquestion.",
        "A: No, no, no. Because I found out 1n any case, it\u2019s very hard to put yourself in somebody else\nbody on a case like this. What would I do, if as a Jewish doctor, put him in a camp. What would\nI do? What road would I take? I don\u2019t know. I want to survive? \u2014Maybe. I don\u2019t want to\nsurvive like a killer, I die. But what would be my position? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have any idea.\nIt\u2019s hard.",
        "A: From long time, when I was nine years old, I was very interested of the... and I won\u2019t say to save\npeople, but just of the science of medicine, of the human being. I\u2019m, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m such a\ngood man to say it was to save people. I don\u2019t think so. But I was interested on how the body is\nmade, why does the body react the way it is? And this is why I did go to acupuncture, because\nacupuncture made me discover a lot of things I didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, no, because I\u2019m a bad student. So every time you said the word when I was young, about\nstudying, go to school and buy book and read book... I said, \u201cOh, \u2019'm not going to do it.\u201d But I\ndid it because I was interested on medicine. But I was not interested on... my average, medical\nschool, every school I did go was between seventy-eight and eighty. I never made a hundred.",
        "A: Like I said, I was nine years old when I said, I will be a doctor. And all my path was on this\ndirection. But you know, when you are nine years old... I have a patient, who came, a woman,\ncame with a little boy. And very, very wealthy people. It was in Paris. And the boy was maybe\nfive or six years old. And I said, \u201cWhat do you want to become when you are to be older?\u201d And\nhe said, \u201cI want to drive a garbage truck.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy a garbage truck?\u201d And he gave me\na good, very interesting explanation. And much later, I found out he was driving a garbage\ntruck. He was eighteen, nineteen. Sometime you don\u2019t know what drives you, why you want to\ndo something and this is when I say God is so strong. Because sometimes God say, he wants to\nbe a garbage driver, let it be. And he open every door he can. And the guy is very happy. We\nneed people drive truck, drive garbage truck. We need fire people. We need policemen. So,\nwhy not? The funny part is, every time I... I used to take anybody who wants to have hypnosis,\nthey want to know what they were in another life. Because everybody think they were king,\nqueen, princess, you know? But I said to the people, \u201cYou know, there was a few King, but the\nmajority were people working. Why don\u2019t you think you\u2019d be a normal human body working to\nmake a living? You have more people who make eighteen, twenty thousand a year in United\n37\nState than people who make a hundred fifty thousand. But in another life, you want to be the one\nwho make a hundred and fifty thousand?\u201d [Laughing. |",
        "A: Always, always. God was always there with me. I have to, I have to be very, very honest. And\nif he didn\u2019t have the time, he send me somebody to help me. So I never, never worry about, and\neven now, dying. Dying for me is anormal end. The same way when you believe in\nreincarnation, you know what is to be born again. And in the same time, when the time comes,\nit\u2019s the end. And say, I don\u2019t know the word in English... wise Indian, native from United State,\nthey know exactly when they are going to die. They say good-bye to all the family. They go to\nthe mountain, they pray God and they die. The family come the day or two days after, take the\nbody and burn it, because this is the ritual. Now, people said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201d Why? If it\nis the time, it\u2019s the time. You got a ticket in your pocket. You have your date of birth and you\nhave a blank. The blank is when you die. Okay, suddenly the date goes on, it\u2019s this day. And\ngo on. [Laughing. |",
        "A: Very complicated to say. Some time, some time to make it easy on me, it\u2019s a body. I speak with\nsomebody, but sometime when I sleep... this is the real one, the real McCoy, because it comes\nlike a voice. And in the morning, it happened to me not long time ago, I don\u2019t know if it was a\ndream or did I see it, did I wake up? It\u2019s very, very funny, but one thing I can tell you, it\u2019s very\ncomforting. I mean, I never been scared. I never been afraid because I heard something or I saw\nsomething. Lately, lately, I live alone here, lately I see things passing. Or I\u2019m in the kitchen and\nI see a blur of something. Pfft. So, I say to myself jokingly, maybe soon it\u2019s my time. And it\u2019s\npossible. And it\u2019s going to come. So, now, later... but it\u2019s funny, because lately I see, maybe\nyou are going in a few month or a few weeks, you\u2019re going to hear, \u201cWell, he pass away.\u201d You\ngot this on your tape saying, \u201cWell, he spoke about it.\u201d And it\u2019s nothing to be scared of it.\nWhen come the time, come the time. You know people die forty years old. I\u2019m sixty-seven. I\ndid have a good life with the good and the bad, but it\u2019s nothing, you know. I don\u2019t want to live\nuntil a hundred and twenty with nothing, with Alzheimer or thinking about how am I going to\nsurvive, or... God is wise, he knows when to tell you to come back. And if medicine 1s strong\nenough to keep you alive, this is ridiculous. When somebody has to go, let him go. The best\nway, but let him go. And when it\u2019s your time, it\u2019s time. It\u2019s nothing to be scared of it. I be\nback. [Laughing. |",
        "A: From the little I know about the Jewish religion, Jewish people, when they die, it\u2019s finished.\nThere is a God, but reincarnation, Jewish people don\u2019t believe in it.\n38",
        "A: But the old basic religion, when you die, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s finished. I don\u2019t think this come from the\nJewish religion. On top of this, I don\u2019t have any training with the Torah. Never read the Torah.\nNever read the Talmud. I don\u2019t have any knowledge about the Jewish religion, neither from any\nother religion. Everything is by feeling. And God is always present. When you do good thing.\nWhen you do bad things. Sometimes it\u2019s a little bit annoying to have this presence with you.\nWhen, when you have sex, you want to be alone. [Laughing.] You don\u2019t want to have\nsomebody who look over your shoulder, but 1t goes with the price. But yes, I have a relation\nmostly constantly. I\u2019m not going to, you\u2019re not going to see me in the streets screaming \u201cI saw\nGod!\u201d No. But I have a feeling. I have this feeling. It\u2019s very comfortable. It makes sense to\nme, and it\u2019s very helpful. Because if I go back from my childhood until now, God was very\ngood with me, because he never let me down. I never got, I've been depressed like a lot of\npeople, but I got something who just come back in there, \u201cHey Paul, get up, that\u2019s it.\u201d And it\u2019s\ntrue. I can have a few bad days and after this the sun comes back and everything is okay. So,\nI\u2019ve been very lucky, I mean spiritually. And I don\u2019t want to say this too much... I did have,\nwhen I was in France, I did have a lot of priest coming in my office. The reason is, my wife\nbrother was a monk and he send me a lot of people, because I did have a lot of success. And if\nyou want me, I can tell you a short story. One of mine patient was from Paris and his brother\nwas a monsignor in Rome. He said, \u201cYou think this guy, you know, this doctor, can help me?\u201d\nHe was in bad, bad shape. And his brother, who lives in Paris said, \u201cLet me ask him.\u201d So, the\nmonsignor calls me and he said, \u201cIf I send you the plane from the Pope and I pay all the expense\nand you tell me your price, would you come for a weekend at the Vatican?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes,\nbut you have to remember one thing, I\u2019m born from Jewish parent.\u201d He said, \u201cGod is Jewish.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cIf you take it this way, any time you want, any weekend.\u201d So, he send me a plane and did\ngo there, took care of him. And he show me my room and on the top of, above the bed was the\nChrist. And I said, \u201cYou have to take this out, because, you know, as Jewish, you tell me I kill\nhim and trust me, I didn\u2019t kill him. And I don\u2019t think Jewish people did.\u201d So, he took it away.\nWe did have wonderful discussion. And when I came back, you know, he was very, very happy.\nWe spend beautiful hour of discussion. And he said, \u201cIf one day you have the vocation and\nGod...\u201d because we spoke about God and I told him my relation with God. And he say, \u201cIf God\nask you to become a Catholic, would you accept?\u201d And I said, \u201cIf God ask me, yes I will. But\nMonsignor, I\u2019m going to tell you one thing, maybe it\u2019s going to be a Catholic, one more\nCatholic, but I will be Jew for the rest of my life.\u201d And he said, \u201cI think so.\u201d [Laughing. |",
        "A: I think it\u2019s mouth, people... I did have all kind of people come in my office. Movie actor, little\npeople, farmer brought me a chicken in a piece of paper in a Paris, in an office right in\nMadeleine, which 1s the best office you can find. They brought me cognac they did by\nthemselves, like you call here moonshine. I did have all kind of people. And I will tell you the\ntruth, if you stay with me here in my office when I\u2019m working, you\u2019ll see all kind of people\ncome in here. Policemen, firemen, fire people, ninety-seven-year-old lady, ninety-two, this lady\ncomes every two weeks. She\u2019s ninety-two. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who keep me on my\nfeet.

        "A: Not at all. No. Medical school teach you the basic. And when you out of school, you become a\ndoctor. And the basic, even the way they practice medicine here in the United State, it\u2019s not\nworse and it\u2019s not better than any place else. When a guy put a stethoscope around his neck, his\nwhole personality change. It\u2019s like a cop, when he put on a uniform, he\u2019s completely different.\nTake his uniform out, take his stethoscope out, take him out of the hospital...

        "A: Oh, yes, the basic, I mean you have to... it\u2019s like, I like to play music and the best way to learn 1s\nto learn classic. And after this, you can play any kind of instrument you want because classical\nis so complete, so hard. You want to play Jazz? No problem. You want to play song? No\nproblem. Medicine, you have to learn the basic. If you know how the machine works, you can\ndo what you want after this. What I don\u2019t like too much in medicine, when people specialize.\nYou know, you specialize on one thing and you do one thing only and you speak to this doctor\nabout something else, he doesn\u2019t know. I do only stomach. If you have a problem with your\nstomach, I know everything about stomach. But the problem is, in the body, the stomach is part\nof the body. Maybe the stomach doesn\u2019t work, and this is why I did go in chiropractic. Because\nwith chiropractic I can do more than give medicine. And with acupuncture and chiropractic, I\ncan do again more, because I can reach from every corner. And this is why I feel much more\nsecure with what I know now than when I graduate from medical school, which I didn\u2019t know\nnothing.",
        "A: Patient likes to come in front of a guy, who have the time to listen, to sit down and say, \u201cWhat is\nyour problem?\u201d And because I know all those little thing, I know what kind of question to ask.\nYou know? If you tell me your problem and you go in some space in your body, I don\u2019t want to\nknow for many reasons, I want to be more specific. I bring you back to the point, I want for you\nto be specific. So, I can go there much easier than you said, \u201cWell, I have headache. I\u2019m very\nconstipated. When I get my period...\u201d and I\u2019m confused. And when you confuse a doctor, he\ndoes nothing. But when the doctor knows how to direct you: \u201cOkay, you have this, let\u2019s\nemphasize on this place. When do you have this pain? Where do you have this pain? From\nwhere does it come? What time of the day? How many time a week do you have this?\u201d So, you\ncan bring all this to one thing. I put this with my knowledge of...

        "A: Chiropractic? Chiropractic is based on nerve pressure. Everything come from the brain. Mine\nbasic idea of psychosomatic is so strong. You can help yourself or you can destroy yourself.\nThere\u2019s a doctor, I saw this on 20/20 not long time ago. There\u2019s a doctor, he must be around\nsixty-five years old in New York. And he take care of any, any low back pain with a hundred\npercent success just by explaining thing for twenty minutes to the patient. And I was listening\nto, I didn\u2019t hear what he was saying for the twenty minute, but I understood the concept, and it\nmakes sense. And he is in a hospital and all the other doctor laugh at him, but he\u2019s got a hundred\npercent success, because he teach you how to say when you wake up in the morning and you\nhave pain on your back, and you say, \u201cOh honey, I think I\u2019m not going to be able to go to work.\nMy pain kills me and it\u2019s going to be a horrible day.\u201d And if I can teach you how to speak to\nyour back\u2014and this is what he does\u2014sure it\u2019s going to be hard to start, but little by little the\npain is going to go away. Everything, almost, is psychosomatic. Cancer, and I don\u2019t speak about\nHIV and sickness like this, which is acquired. This is different. But I mean any, anything inside\nof your body is psychosomatic. You can make it worse or you can make it better. And if\nsomebody for any reason, you have a baby, find a doctor who is going to be with you all the\ntime. And if you have any problem, you be able to give him a call and said, \u201cI feel this and this,\u201d\nand he should have an answer to tell you. \u201cIt\u2019s normal because of this or this or this, think this\nway and you'll feel better.\u201d\u201d You have to have a dialogue. The doctor is here to help you, to help\nyour psychic. Everything is almost 99.5 percent psychosomatic. And if the doctor understand\nthis and can direct you... You know a lot of people come to acupuncture and said, \u201cI hate\nneedle.\u201d And I said, \u201cIf I tell you, you are not going to feel it.\u201d Okay, I can tell this until\ntomorrow and if I put in a needle and it\u2019s painful, he\u2019s going to say, \u201cYou lied to me. It\u2019s\npainful.\u201d But if the patient is on the table and I said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to put a needle. As soon\nas there is any pain tell me. I take the needle out. But the way, I put the needle and where I put\nthe needle, you shouldn\u2019t feel nothing.\u201d 99 percent people say, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel it.\u201d This is one\nform of hypnosis: to do acupuncture. \u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d Patient who come bent and\nthey have low back pain. Put them on the table, start to massage a little bit the back and speak to\nthem, tell them about vacation. What do you like, flying, thing like this. I adjust them, if I didn\u2019t\nspeak to them, I couldn\u2019t touch them. You touch them a little bit: \u201cOh, it\u2019s painful.\u201d You put a\nlittle bit under hypnosis and give an adjustment and that\u2019s it. And the patient goes away. It\nlooks simple the way I explain, but this is the way it goes. It\u2019s very simple. Unless I play the\ndoctor, \u201cYou lay down here. I\u2019m going to adjust you. It\u2019s going to be painful, but you have\nnothing for nothing. You have to suffer.\u201d They say, \u201cJust a minute, let me think about.\u201d It\u2019s\npsychosomatic, I mean, everything is in your head. \u201cI\u2019m going to adjust you, but I don\u2019t know if\nI going to help you.\u201d \u201cWell, so don\u2019t touch me.

And he say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay with me.\u201d So, I just put two needle and I said, \u201cGo\nahead.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d And I said, \u201cOh yeah.\u201d So, he drill and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re\nsure you don\u2019t feel anything?\u201d I said, \u201cListen, I\u2019m human. I don\u2019t like pain and if it was painful\nI would have said, \u2018The hell with acupuncture, give me a shot!\u2019 No, I don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d And\nthis is the way itis. I have a young lady, who came and she did have suspicious part of the\nbreast. So she said, \u201cI would love to try...\u201d\u2014because she is a patient of mine of acupuncture\u2014\n\u201cYou said you can anesthetize myself with acupuncture.\u201d And I said, \u201cSure.\u201d So, we did go to\nthe hospital. I prepared the whole thing the normal way and I said, \u201cOkay, you ready?\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cYes.\u201d So, I put needle. And the surgeon came, a little bit smiling. And I said, \u201cOkay,\ncut.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d And I said, \u201cThe lady agree, I agree, go ahead.\u201d He did the\nwhole surgery under acupuncture. She said, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel nothing.\u201d And I was looking, because\nI said, \u201cMy God, if she, if she start to scream, I have to put the mask, give her the gas. And I\u2019m\ngoing to put her down deep.\u201d But she didn\u2019t say anything. Did go to China at Christmas, this\nlast Christmas. And this guy, when I did go see my teacher, he said, \u201cWould you like to see\nsomething interesting?\u201d I said yes. He said, \u201cI\u2019m going to do acupuncture to an open heart\nsurgery.\u201d And I said, \u201cCan I come?\u201d And he said sure. So, we did go. Needle all over, start to\nsee section open, bring the heart, massage. The guy is covered here and the surgeon said, \u201cYou\nokay?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, I\u2019m okay, but\u2019\u201d\u20141it was in Chinese, I didn\u2019t understand\u2014\u201cT would like to\ndrink something.\u201d So, they brought him a straw with orange juice and he drink and he was\ncompletely opened. [Laughing.] It\u2019s very impressive, very, very impressive. So, it\u2019s rewarding\nand I like it.",
        "A: Acupuncture, but it\u2019s very basic, because acupuncture in United State is not in a high level.\nThey, I have a lot of article from paper where they say if you have a headache, acupuncture can\nhelp you. If woman have bad menstruation, acupuncture, but you know they bring it to the lower\npart, not very high. You know, when you speak about open heart surgery, they say, \u201cJust a\nminute.\u201d They don\u2019t agree. But they are interested. They want to know. So when, you know,\nevery doctor have to do twelve, twenty four hour, depend on state. So, they ask me to come and\nAd\nwhen I go and I give a seminar sometime one-fourth of the class go away, skiing and swimming.\n[Laughing.] It\u2019s no problem.",
        "A: Oh yes. I did go back with my mother. I did go back with my brother. Well, I... every time I go\nto Europe I go to see them. I just receive a letter from mine, I don\u2019t know how you call this,\ngodmother? And from what I understand he 1s not in this world anymore. I think my godfather\ndie. So, she is there, she must be over eighty. So this, before the Christmas, this coming\nChristmas, I\u2019m going to go back. And I try to reach her by phone to find out how she\u2019s doing.\nIt\u2019s not the same address, it\u2019s another address. So, I want to find out. But when I came back, I\ntook my mother \u2014 oh very quick after the war, maybe two year after war or three year after the\nwar. Because I did want for... my mother was a very interesting person. She didn\u2019t have any,\nshe didn\u2019t ever study. She didn\u2019t know how to write, to read. She was reading Jewish, Hebrew.\nAnd it took her about a week, a week and a half to read one paper in Hebrew. But she was very,\nshe was very smart, not by studying, but by instinct. And she... people like her. The only thing\nI found out, is when people don\u2019t have any background of studying to read aloud, when they get\nold, they lose this normal instinct of life. They are confused. And I did have a lot of very Ph.D.\nmen, who got Alzheimer\u2019s disease, so it doesn\u2019t go with... but most of the time, these people,\nlike my mother, like my brother, they don\u2019t have the training of the brain to be able to hold on,\non something solid. It\u2019s only by memory. They don\u2019t have any technique. And the older she\ngot, harder it was for us to discuss with her. She was, imagine things, like one day she was\nwatching TV and it was something completely normal and she got very angry. And I said,\n\u2018\u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t see what they did on this TV?\u201d And then I realize, well,\nshe didn\u2019t understand and she got mad. But otherwise, she was a very interesting person. I\ncannot speak about my father because I was too young when he died. But it, she was, she\nconnect with my godfather when we did go see him, because my godfather was also very, very\neducated, a very interesting, wide idea of the world. And they did have, I remember a very, very\ninteresting conversation, in a high level, not \u201cIt\u2019s a nice day today. The food was good.\u201d It\nwas... and mine, his wife of my godfather, she was a teacher. I was in love with her, because she\nwas, I think, the most beautiful woman in the world. She was smart. And I was afraid from her,\nbecause she was a teacher. At my age, a teacher you don\u2019t fool around with. But I saw her later\nwhen I was a growing man and she was older and she was the most beautiful woman I had met.\n[Laughing. |",
        "A: No, because I think they deserve to be called this way. In French it\u2019s parrain, and her it\u2019s\nmarraine. In English it\u2019s godfather. And I don\u2019t know if we have a name for a woman. But\nevery time...eh?\n45",
        "A: Godmother? Every time I used to write to them and even lately, I always, \u201cCher Parrain, cher\nMarraine,\u201d because this is what they are for me. They were very generous with me and I try to\nbe as much as I can with them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They were mine, smart parent. What my father and mother couldn\u2019t give me, because they\ndidn\u2019t have it. My mother spoke to me. She tried to be as much as she could, but they never\nstudy and they didn\u2019t know... you know, when I said I want to become a doctor: \u201cWhy? We\nhave a good business. We do upholstery. You can make a good living. Why would you like to\nbe a doctor? We don\u2019t have any doctor in the family.\u201d",

        "A: Both. I wrote letter all the time and every time I did go to... I left France in 1960, 1983 to come\nin the United State. But otherwise I was in their place anytime. They, they, you know, he was a\nProtestant priest and after this, he likes to show people he was poor. It was his way to... he was\nnot poor, but he wants to show. So, he bought a little place on the border of the lake, but on the\nother side to go to his house, you have to cross the railroad. And I... he was very, very severe.\nAnd one day, I ask him, you know, very... \u201cWhy did you buy so close to the railroad?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not\nrich. \u2019'm poor. I\u2019m a priest. I cannot afford to buy like the rich people, so thank God I can have\nthis thing.\u201d I never ask anymore. [Laughing.] Because, he was, you know, this is what I can\nafford and that\u2019s it. But he was a good man, very, very good man. Very, not religious like a\npriest, you know, not the man... one day I did go to, you know the Club Med? It was my last\nyear in medicine and they ask for a good swimmer to teach water ski and I was good on water\nski, so I put my name and I been to Greece to teach in Club Med for two month, for the summer.\nIt was beautiful, because it was...\nEnd of Tape 4, Side A\n46\nTape 4, Side B",
        "A: This group of Swiss people came and we start to, and I said, \u201cYou know, my godfather 1s from\nSwitzerland, from this place.\u201d He say, \u201cWe are from this place!\u201d And he said, \u201cJust a minute.\nHow 1s he?\u201d And I said, I describe him. He said, \u201cThis is Pastor Lederman.\u201d And I said yes.\nHe\u2019s the only one to be like this. [Laughing.] He was known because he was very artistic, very\nwild and doing things, the way we have to do things. You know, you don\u2019t wake up in the\nmorning. First thing you do, wash your face and shave. You cannot go on without shaving.\nYou know, he did have a lot of principle, but even up to this day, a lot of thing I do, I remember\nhe teach me. I remember he told me, \u201cOh, you have to do this, you have to do this. No, no, no.\nDon\u2019t do this, this way, do it this way.\u201d And without thinking I do it the way he told me.

And that\u2019s where I met her.",
        "A: No. No, she, it was a very, how can I say? Very Catholic family. And everything was going\nfine, everything was okay, until one day in Paris... we used to live a little bit outside of Paris, like\nyou would say in Nicholasville, compared to Lexington. And one day it was a strike, no car, I\nmean, no bus, no train, nothing. And my brother-in-law, who was my age, studying to become\nan architect, did have a motorcycle. He said, \u201cIf you want I can take you to the school, to the\nmedical school.\u201d And his school was very close, too. \u201cYou can ride on the back of the\nmotorcycle.\u201d And I said okay. And we rode there and coming to a fire place, you know, the red\nlight? The red light didn\u2019t work. He didn\u2019t see the car and this car hit us and I flew over and fell\ndown, but I didn\u2019t get anything serious. He did hit the car directly and he broke all his mouth,\nhis right knee. Bad accident. Bad, bad accident. They took us to the hospital and even to this\nday, my daughter told me this yesterday, they going to do surgery on his hip. But he did have\nbad, he lost all his teeth. He was stitched all over. He stopped studying architecture. With the\nmoney he touch from the insurance, he bought a moulin......\n47",
        "A: Windmill! He bought a windmill outside of Paris, about two hundred miles from Paris. And he\nbecame a farmer with his mother, his father. The whole family moved there. But his mother\nnever forgave me to be in the motorcycle, because she said, if I wouldn\u2019t be in the motorcycle,\nhe wouldn\u2019t be so badly injured. So, since this accident, there was a bad tension between us,\nbetween the family and me. Did it bring to the divorce? Maybe yes, maybe no, I don\u2019t know.\nBut life became much more difficult, more and more. And even my brother-in-law used to get\nmad at his mother every time she bring up this. Because every time he never complained. Ever.\nAnd sometime he was in bad shape. But his mother said, \u201cYes, if you didn\u2019t have this accident.\u201d\nAnd he say, \u201cPlease you stop.\u201d And he always defend me all the time, but she was, she was\nmad.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Very hard to know what\u2019s going on, on the\nhead of somebody else. And we never got the chance to discuss. She didn\u2019t want to discuss.\nThere was no possibility. The father, he was a bird. He was not on this earth. [Laughing.] He\nwas good man, but out. So, he never want to discuss about this. He didn\u2019t know anything about\nit. He didn\u2019t want to know about anything. And like I said, my brother-in-law didn\u2019t, never\never, ever said anything. Even when I was divorced, he always ask about me, what am I doing\nand everything is okay. But the mother was mean. She was mad.",
        "A: We never spoke about. We never... my daughter is born. And we decide not to give her any\nreligion. When she grew up, she met a man, got married. He was Catholic. She became\nCatholic.

The\nfeeling between my mother and them... I think they saw each other for my wedding and that\u2019s\nall. They never spoke together. They never got together. It\u2019s very difficult to explain.",
        "A: Oh yes, absolutely. This is... even today, you can take the subway and on the subway in Paris,\nyou can see \u201cJew go Home\u201d or \u201cJew go to Israel\u201d on the subway. It means, you know, it\u2019s like\ndo we have anti-Semitism in United State? Yes. Why, we don\u2019t know. But one day I spoke\n48\nwith a woman from Lexington, she\u2019s a doctor.

And we start to speak about things, I don\u2019t remember exactly\nwhat it was and she said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. The Jew, they have all the money. They have all the\nbank.

        "A: No. I don\u2019t feel comfortable anyplace.",
        "A: No. United State is a nice place to live. It is much simpler than France. You can be\nindependent, more than in France. You can have, they don\u2019t look at you like in France. They\nspy the same way in United State, but it\u2019s a different way. It\u2019s much easier. In France, they spy\non you much more. And they don\u2019t have the law you have in United State. You know, the\nConstitution here, it\u2019s very well made. Freedom of Speech is very important. We don\u2019t have\nfreedom. United State is a Democracy. France is a Republic. And it can take hour for me to\nexplain to you, but I think you know the difference between Democracy and Republic. And here\nyou can live... I was surprised how many people was killed in United State by crime last year.\nTwenty-five thousand people die. It\u2019s a lot of people. We don\u2019t have so many dead in France by\ncrime because we don\u2019t have this access of gun and all this. But there is no safe place on Earth.\nAnd America is one of the most happy place you can be. You can live a normal life, almost.\nYou can buy a car when you want. If you are courageous and work hard, you can make money,\nenjoy yourself. But the limit is very short in United State. And what is the limit? My idea of\nlimit 1s six hundred thousand dollar. Not everybody can save six hundred thousand dollar, but\nafter six hundred thousand dollar\u2014and if you want, one day I\u2019m going to explain this to you\u2014\neverything, if you die or your husband die and leave you a million dollar, you\u2019re going to get six\nhundred thousand dollar. The rest goes to the government, no matter how you go. They... the\nIRS law are very, very well made. They give you this, they take this. They get you anyway. So\nif you have a little bit, if you are low profile, United State 1s perfect. I am a low profile doctor\nand it\u2019s okay. I like this life. I don\u2019t have any problem. But people who become rich, they do,\nthey can, but they have to know how to do it. I wouldn\u2019t like to be rich in the United State.\n[Laughing]",
        "A: Uh huh.\n49",
        "A: I don\u2019t have any political idea, because for the simple reason, anybody who wants to go, want to\nbe a politician has to put money in his pocket. Because people are stupid. If people would be\nintelligent, they wouldn\u2019t vote. Neither for Clinton, neither for Bush, Democrat, Republican, not\nvote. We don\u2019t want you. I would vote for Perot, just to see what he can do. But he doesn\u2019t\nplay the game. Perot is a smart man, but he doesn\u2019t play the game, so no there. It\u2019s not a dream.\nBut let\u2019s say maybe this movie actor, what\u2019s his name? Is going to present himself to become\nthe President of the United State. Warren Beatty? No.",
        "A: Yeah. He present, maybe he\u2019s going to present himself. But otherwise... what Clinton did 1s a\nshame for the country. I don\u2019t think he deserve to be called President of United State. He is a...\nbut Bush was not better. \u201cRead my lips, no more income tax,\u201d I mean, and look what he did.\nAnd the people go, they\u2019re going to vote for his son, or they\u2019re going to vote for another jerk,\nmoron, who is going to be the President. The people need to be whacked in the head. And it\u2019s\nokay. I don\u2019t belong to the people. I\u2019m not a politician. So I enjoy myself.",

        "A: Oh, in 1983... *93.",
        "A: No. [Laughing.] No, no it\u2019s not. I think more about myself as a citizen of the world, more than a\ncitizen of a country. It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m an American. I\u2019m a Spanish. I\u2019m an Italian. \u2019ma\nFrench. What does it mean? I\u2019m human.",
        "A: Well, number one is because I was a little bit tired about what I was feeling in France. And it\nwas time for me to change and this was some feeling. I have feeling sometime and this was the\ntime for me to go away. Even I did have a very good practice in France, everything was going\nfine, but [clears throat|\u2014excuse me\u2014it was time for me to do something else. And since before\nI left United State in 1962, I took the State Board of Kentucky. I came back in Kentucky to\nestablish... and I didn\u2019t know where. I choose Lexington because it was a challenge. And I\ndecide to open an office here and later maybe go to another state. Because when you come back\nin United State with a license, you have to stay at least three year in the state, before you can\nmove to another one. I tried to have the equivalence of my medical license here and I found out\nKentucky is one of the most difficult state to have a reciprocity of the diploma. So, I decide I\u2019m\ngoing to have mine, I did have mine license for Chiropractic, so I took my chiropractic license,\n50\nrenew it, and I stay here. And since 1983, I did have three different office, one in Versailles\nRoad, the another one in North Broadway for at least fourteen year and now in Palomar. And it\nwas very, very interesting. I like the state. I like the weather. A little bit cold in the winter time,\nbut... I like horses, so I\u2019m very happy when I can drive in the country and see all the horses. I\nhave a lot of friend who have horses. I ride a lot of horses. And I travel a lot. I give a lot of\nseminar in United State and in Europe. I go to China once every five year to re-educate mine\nacupuncture. And life is great here. Right now I have a project. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to do\nit. But either I\u2019m going to move to the Caribbean in an island where there is already a\nchiropractor. And I\u2019m going to go see him probably at the end of this month, September, 1999.\nOr if I don\u2019t like what I see there, I probably going to buy a farm in Woodford County around\nVersailles, like we say here. And have a farm with horses and my practice at the same time until\nI die. So, this is going to be my project until the end of 1999. Thinking about what, I don\u2019t\nknow if it is going to be different in the year two thousand. Everybody think about something\ndifferent. I don\u2019t think nothing is going to happen, but anyway it doesn\u2019t make any difference\nfor me. And this is my project. I was very happy for my move to come here. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s\nvery, even up to this day since 1983 I\u2019m back in United State, even up to this day it is very hard\nfor me to adapt to the American life, but it\u2019s not too bad. And Ill survive. And we\u2019ll see what\nmy project are going to give me and what am I going to do. But it\u2019s going to be a surprise for\nmyself and for my friends.",
        "A: It is completely different. Life here is different. People live differently, they got different\npriority. I could say the same thing about France. They in France, they live different. They\nhave different personality. Here, we don\u2019t eat, we nourish ourselves. In France a meal is like a\nbig festivity. We take our time. Relation between male and female in France is much more\nromantic. It is much more something sensitive, sensual. Here it\u2019s much more difficult, woman\nwants to be man. Sometimes man become woman. It 1s, it would take a whole book to explain\nthe difference between France and United State. But when you want, you adapt. And I go back\nto France at least once or twice a year. Every time I go, I enjoy. I have a good time. I read\nalmost everything in French, because since I left France, I think poetry in France is beautiful.\nAnd there 1s no problem, you always survive. You adapt and you survive. You don\u2019t have\nalways exactly what you want, but where do we have what we want? It\u2019s another world and it\u2019s\nfor me like another life.",
        "A: Well, because when I left, I took my license in 1962. I took the first license open and it was\nKentucky. So, I took my license and I didn\u2019t even wait for the results. Did go back home, open\nmy office. And I receive my license from Kentucky and this is why I came back here. And\nwhen I came back here, I thought maybe I\u2019m going to go to another state, but after a while I said,\nwhere can I go? It\u2019s nothing worse here or better than any other place. I\u2019m not a California man.\nI\u2019m not a Florida man. So, it\u2019s pretty good here. So, I think this is where I am going to stay, if I\ndon\u2019t go to an island.\n51",
        "A: No. No. Nothing. No. I knew there was a lot of horses, that\u2019s all. But otherwise it took me a\nlong time to understand the way they speak English, but now I think I\u2019m used to. A lot of people\neven now don\u2019t understand me, but it doesn\u2019t matter because they adopt me. I like them, they\nlike me and we don\u2019t have any problem.",
        "A: No, I was surprised at the beginning a lot of times, because I didn\u2019t know people still using\nchewing tobacco. And I didn\u2019t know... well, when I was in New York on my way to come here,\na friend of mine said, \u201cIf you go to Kentucky, they are fifty years behind every other state.\u201d I\ndidn\u2019t believe it, but there was a little bit truth of what they say. But didn\u2019t bother me, no\nproblem.",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t like to be involved in groups. I\u2019m not a politician. I\u2019m not a religious man. So, I\nlook, if it was something I can do or something I can help, I probably would do, but I stay put. I\nstay on my backyard. I don\u2019t want to be too much involved with all those things, so. I\u2019m in the\nback.",
        "A: Yes, I have a few Jewish friend, but like I always said, they are American Jew and they don\u2019t\nknow exactly what it is to be a European Jew, so we have a lot of difference. The main thing is,\nJewish in Europe help themselves with other Jew, around here to be Jew for another Jew doesn\u2019t\nmean nothing.",
        "A: You mean? I don\u2019t quite understand what...",
        "A: Yes, let\u2019s put it this way, they are Jewish. They know what happened in Europe. They are\ninterested for six minute, that\u2019s all, all the rest, it goes above the head. They don\u2019t feel like really\nthey are concerned. Even if it looks like, but they are, you know: \u201cIt\u2019s just, it happened. We\nhope it\u2019s never going to happen again. Only if they start to touch Jewish people in United State,\nthis is another story, but otherwise, we send\u2014this is what they say\u2014we send money to Israel,\nwe help them. We have a clean conscience. We are good Jew.\u201d\n52\nEnd of Tape 4, Side B\n53\nTape 5, Side A",
        "A: Not only the Jew from Lexington, everywhere I did go... my name in France is unique, because\nthere is no other Pressman. But every time I go in places like San Francisco, any place, I look in\nthe telephone book to see there is Pressman and I found a few. I call them and there is no, no\nfeeling. I don\u2019t... you know, they say, \u201cOh yeah, your name is Pressman, oh yeah, interesting.\nWhere were you? From where are you, you have an accent?\u201d But we don\u2019t feel like... for\nexample, let\u2019s say somebody, many time people came in my office in Paris saying \u201cI\u2019m Jewish, I\ncome from Yugoslavia. I\u2019m passing through here and I\u2019m going to try to go to United State or\nSpain or place.\u201d \u201cOkay, where do you sleep tonight?\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have any place.\u201d \u201cYou\ncome and you sleep at my place and you\u2019re going to eat with me and I\u2019m going to call a few...\u201d\nAnd I try to put some money together and give it to this guy, so he can fulfill... when I came here\nthe first time, I did go to a Jewish association, I don\u2019t remember the name, to introduce myself.\nAnd say, \u201cMy name is Paul Pressman, I\u2019m a medical doctor and I\u2019m going to open an office.\u201d\nThey lady look at me and she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we don\u2019t have money to give to you.\u201d And I say,\n\u201cLady I didn\u2019t come to ask money, I just came to introduce myself.\u201d I left and never, never saw\nthose people again. They send me paper and they wrote me letter. I said, \u201cIf this is the way you\nwelcome people in your congregation, the hell with you. Stay where you are and I stay off.\u201d\nThis is why since the beginning I didn\u2019t join anybody. I didn\u2019t speak with anybody and I stay in\nmy corner. A lot of patient, Jewish patients, said \u201cOh, you should come.\u201d I said, \u201cYou go and\nyou leave me alone. I don\u2019t want to belong.\u201d One day the Rabbi came here and he spoke to me\nand he said, \u201cAs a Jewish man you should at least belong to the synagogue.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou\nbelong to the synagogue. You leave me alone. I don\u2019t want to see you anymore in my office. If\nyou need me, if you have a health problem, I will take care of you, otherwise forget me.\u201d I\ndidn\u2019t like the attitude. I didn\u2019t like the way they been treating people. And now suddenly, they\ntake Jewish people from Russia and they give them home. Who do they think they show this?\nFor what? No, it\u2019s... for me, there are two kind of bad Jew in this world, the German Jew and the\nAmerican Jew. I don\u2019t have any respect for the German. We call them the Yecket (ph). And\nwhat we call the Jew here, speaking about the woman, American Jew, the JAP, the Jewish\nAmerican Princess. I don\u2019t want to have nothing to do with them. They can live their life, but\nI\u2019m Jewish by tradition. I don\u2019t go to the synagogue. And they go to the synagogue. They do\nthe Bar Mitzvah for the kids, but it\u2019s not my kind. So, I stay away from these people. That\u2019s all.",
        "A: I don\u2019t have any problem. I don\u2019t have any problem. When people ask me what kind of religion\nI am, I say \u201cI\u2019m born Jew\u201d and there is no problem. There is no, \u201cAh, you\u2019re Jewish.\u201d No, no.\nThey don\u2019t say anything. We have to remember United State is based on the free willing of\nreligion. Anybody can be what they want. So, you have, I think, about two hundred different\nChristian religion. Everything goes okay, is no problem. If there is no problem with them, it\u2019s\nno problem with me.\n54",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yeah. Yeah. I don\u2019t, without being sent to Auschwitz, I\u2019m the closest one to suffer\nand been suffering because of the Nazi and because I was Jewish. Oh yes.",
        "A: No, no, no. This is something who comes if they are interested, we can speak about it. But no,\nthis is mine, this is my life. I didn\u2019t choose it. This is the way it is and I\u2019m not ashamed of it.\nI\u2019m not proud of it. This is the way it is. They say Jewish people are the chosen people from\nGod. We pay the price. But it\u2019s okay. If in the next life, we\u2019re going to have another religion,\nmaybe we going to be able to breathe a little bit and look on the other side.",
        "A: No, because my, the way they do it now, is became movies, to make movies. It\u2019s always very\nhard to make a good movie. This is a good subject. Books, the writer will write about another\nwriter, who wrote something about the Holocaust. It becomes diluted. And I think... men like\nmy brother, for example, who survive Holocaust, doesn\u2019t want to speak in public, because they\nwouldn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s got to say. I mean, they wouldn\u2019t... they say, that\u2019s impossible,\nyou tell us a story. Story he told me, I know it\u2019s true, because he wouldn\u2019t lie to me. And he\u2019s\nnot a liar. But I can put myself in the shoes of somebody who never heard about Holocaust,\nlisten to what he\u2019s got to say. It doesn\u2019t make sense. It is the truth, but it doesn\u2019t make sense.\nThis didn\u2019t happen. It can\u2019t be done. So, right now, sure, more we do about the Holocaust\nMuseum, the best it is because it helps for people not to forget. But it\u2019s the basic. Unless\nsomebody is really interested on what happen and I mean Jewish people who are interested, they\ncan find this someplace. But in public, you know... my brother did go to Germany in a school to\nspeak about Holocaust and half of the class didn\u2019t know what was Holocaust. \u201cWhat do you\nmean by Holocaust? What is it? A fruit? A piece of bread? What is Holocaust?\u201d So. You\nknow you speak in front of people about something they don\u2019t understand. They don\u2019t have a\nclue of what you talking about. They say, \u201cWhat is he talking about? Did he make a movie?\u201d\nSchindler List was something close to the Holocaust and it make sense. It was human.\nAuschwitz is unhuman. You tell things about Auschwitz. It is not real. It\u2019s a bad dream. And\nyou have people listen to... \u201cThis guy is nuts. He doesn\u2019t know what he is talking about.\u201d But\nthis happen. So, right now, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good, I mean the best thing 1s to have museum\nand encourage people... my attorney here sent his son\u2014he\u2019s Jewish\u2014he sent his son at\nWashington. And when he came back, he didn\u2019t speak for one week. And the father said,\n\u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d He said, \u201cI was shocked. What they did to Jewish people. I was shocked\nfrom what I saw.\u201d So, I think the most important is to send people there, children, the new\ngeneration, for them to see what happened. When I did go to Auschwitz, full bus of school kids\nused to come in Auschwitz to see the crematorium where all the Jewish die. And I think this is\nwonderful, because we should never forget what happened. But speaking in the public and\n55\nexplaining things, it\u2019s not enough. You have to visualize. You have to see things. This is why\nthe Museum is important.",
        "A: Two years ago in March. At the anniversary of the death of my other brother. I did go with my\nbrother because he show me every place he been. Where were the kitchen. Where was the, the\nhospital, or things like this. It was, it was very, very interesting.",
        "A: Well, we left from Paris to Warsaw and Auschwitz. It was very short, because it\u2019s very close to\nParis. And we stay in a crummy hotel, because this was the only hotel in Auschwitz-Birkenau.\nWe did, uh, Auschwitz is a military camp, military place. This is where there all the glasses\nfrom the Jewish people who die. The clothes, the hair, the shoes, the denture. And you see all\nthis exposed behind glass. And after this you go in the barrack and wood where they live. And I\nthink it is very impressive and it is real. The only thing my brother was surprised when we did\ngo the first time and he said, \u201cSomething is different.\u201d\u2019 The barrack 1s the same, the whole thing.\nThe grass, it was grass, high grass. By the time people were there, you didn\u2019t have any grass.\nWhy? Because they eat the grass. So, the little piece of grass on the ground was eat, it was food.\nThis is why it was different. But otherwise, the whole thing, the concentration camp, I mean the\ncrematorium, everything was... there is a little lake in the middle of the camp, not very big,\nwhere they put all the ashes of the dead people. Below forty degree in winter time, this lake\nnever froze, because of the grease of the human body. And a lot of things like this. It is, I think,\na place to see. I think if I was an American Jew, this is the first place I want to go. I want to see\nwhat happened. But when you say this to Jewish people, they say \u201cI have better place to go.\u201d I\nsay, \u201cGood for you.\u201d",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. It was very important to be together. For me to see where he was, where did he\nsleep, how did he live? What was the... everything is dead anymore. I have a lot of feeling when\nI go some place. There was no feeling, everything is gone. The only thing stay is the wall, the\ncabin, the wood barrack, but everything is gone. The spirit is gone. But it\u2019s very impressive.\nThis is where you see the railroad train would arrive and it stop right there. All the Jewish\npeople did go down, the ones going to go to the gas chamber on this right, the one who 1s going\nto live a little bit, on the left. And, I mean, this is something you have to see. And I have to say,\nI\u2019m very thankful to the Polish government, who are the most anti-Semitic people in this earth, to\nmaintain the camp the way it is. It\u2019s very, very important to keep it the way it 1s, because, like I\nsaid, most... a lot of people have to see this. But they do a good job. And it\u2019s free, the entrance\nis free. And everything is kept the way it was. And it\u2019s something to see.",
        "A: No, I think we cover most of the path. If you think about something later and you want for us to\nmeet again, it will be no problem. But I think now, we saw the overall picture and now it\u2019s\n56\ngoing to be your job to put this together. And it was a very nice interview and I was very happy\nto do it.\n57\n"
