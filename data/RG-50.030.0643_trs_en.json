        "Answer: It\u2019s a pleasure.",
        "Q: And I will start the interview as I explained at the beginning. I would like to know\nwhen you were born, where you were born, who your parents were, who your family\nwas, and we\u2019ll take it from there.",
        "A: Okay. Well, I was born on August 23\", 1920, which my grandson says I was always\nold. As far as he\u2019s concerned, I was always old. And I was born in Frankfurt; both my\nparents were from Frankfurt. My mother was Jewish, my father was not. My father\ncomes from an old farming family.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Peter Bartmann.",
        "Q: Bartmann?",
        "A: Yes. B-a-r-t-m-a-double n.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And all his ancestors were dairy farmers, including my grandparents, whom I did not\nknow; I did not know his parents. My mother, on the other hand, came from a banking\nfamily, and her maiden name was Hahn, h-a-h-n. And my great-grandfather, I think it\nwas, [indecipherable] is hanging there on the wall, established a banking house. Of\nNovember 21, 2011\ncourse, like all Jews, they originally lived in the ghetto in Frankfurt, and they were\nmoneychangers, I guess. That\u2019s, you know, how most of them started. And then, I think\nmy grandfather\u2019s grandfather \u2014 that\u2019s my grandfather, and that\u2019s my great-grandfather.",
        "Q: Those two pictures up there \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and their \u2014 mm-hm?",
        "A: And on my mother\u2019s side. And he started a bank, which was called L.A. Hahn. And\nall their initials were L.A. And it later became a public \u2014 publicly traded bank which was\ncalled Deutsche Effecten-und Wechselbank.",
        "Q: Deutsche Effecten-und Wechselbank?",
        "A: Yeah. And, in fact, the house is still standing and it\u2019s a historic \u2014 has a historic\ndesignation of the bank, but \u2014",
        "Q: So the ba \u2014 the bank\u2019s building and facility?",
        "A: Yes, the bank\u2019s building. It\u2019s really just the outside, because the rest was destroyed\nduring the war, but the outside is still standing. So anyway, they had a bank. And of\ncourse you may know that in Frankfurt there were lots of mixed marriages.",
        "Q: Well, I wanted to ask you about that, you know, how was it that your parents even\nmet? What brought the \u2014 brought their worlds together?",
        "A: I really just don\u2019t know, but \u2014 but my father was \u2014 my grandparents ha \u2014 on my\nfather\u2019s side had three boys, and my father was the youngest. Clearly the apple of my\nNovember 21, 2011\ngrandmother\u2019s eye. And he is the only one who went to university, and he had a law \u2014 he\ngot a law degree. And I think he was very society minded. And he \u2014 I \u2014 \u2019Il show you\nlater upstairs, I have a\u2014 an old program from something at the [indecipherable] opera,\nwhere he danced with some lady. And I have a feeling that that\u2019s how they met, because\nhe was really very interested in getting up there somehow. He was also a champion tennis\nplayer. He was German master in 1910, which was a different tennis game from what it is\nnow, but nevertheless.",
        "Q: It\u2019s still something, it\u2019s an achievement, you know, in competition with others in your\narea.",
        "A: Yes, yeah, I \u2014 I have all the trophies upstairs. And he also played the piano very well,\nand he used to accompany singers or play in small trios. So I\u2019m \u2014 I am sure that\u2019s how\nthey met somehow, in \u2014 in a dance, or whatever.",
        "Q: What kind of personality did he have?",
        "A: My fa \u2014",
        "Q: How would you \u2014 mm-hm, how would you describe it?",
        "A: My father should have been a diplomat. He was one of the most tactful people I\u2019ve\never known, and really was charming. I mean, everybody just loved him. And he \u2014 he just\n\u2014 he ended up being a banker, because he finally took over my grandparents bank. But he\n\u2014 he should have been a diplomat. He \u2014 he was not very strict, but you know, I\u2014I grew\nup at a time that my parents weren\u2019t home that much, and I had a \u2014 a wonderful \u2014 I don\u2019t\nNovember 21, 2011\nknow, now you call it nanny, I guess, but 1t wa \u2014 she was just a young woman whom they\nhired, and who took care of the kids, and did other stuff, too. And she 1s really the one\nwho \u2014 who raised me, more or less. Not that I didn\u2019t see my parents, I mean, I saw them\nquite a bit, but \u2014 we always had meals together. We always ate \u2014 we used to get the \u2014 and\nyou know, in Europe yo-you eat your main meal at noon, I mean.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: And so we always had that together, but I don\u2019t \u2014 in the evening they were often gone.\nBut, you know, he was a very nice person.",
        "Q: Now, were you the oldest child?",
        "A: No. My sister was two years older.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s her name?",
        "A: Her name was Ruth.",
        "Q: Ruth. And you then were born in what year?",
        "A: Ruth.",
        "Q: Ah, no, Ruth \u2014 what year were you born in?",
        "A: I was born in 1920.",
        "Q: 1920. And \u2014",
        "A: And she was born 1918.",
        "Q: 1918. And what I had forgotten to ask earlier, your mother\u2019s maiden name, and her\nname.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Marguerata(ph) Helena Hahn, h-a-h-n.",
        "Q: Okay, Marguerata(ph) Helena.",
        "A: But she was called Margar(ph).",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And so then they \u2014 you know, my father, I remember, he 1s \u2014 at the time I had allergic\neczema, which of course, when I was a child they didn\u2019t know it was allergy. And I\nremember my father always at night bandaging my arms, so that I wouldn\u2019t scratch, you\nknow. But you know, I don\u2019t really know if it was so often. It just \u2014 your memory just\nplays tricks on you. Anyway, it was \u2014 it was very nice. I grew up \u2014 well, my family, I\nguess they had a lot of money, but I didn\u2019t really know that, you know? I \u2014 it never\noccurred to me that I lived different from a lot of other people.",
        "Q: Well, what do you remember about your home; both as a physical structure, and about\nthe kind of life that you and your f\u2014 your parents and your sister; and whoever else was\nthere, the \u2014 the young girl who was part of your household; what was that like? So let\u2019s\ntalk about all of 1t. Describe it a bit.",
        "A: Well, we lived \u2014 and later when we\u2019 ve finished I\u2019Il show you the pictures, because I\nhave pict \u2014 pictures on the wall of \u2014 of my \u2014 I grew up in what used to be my\ngrandparents dairy farm.",
        "Q: That is your father\u2019s parents?\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yes. And it was a regular farm in a U-shape, with the main house on one side, and\nthen what used to be the barns in a U-shape around it. In the middle was a \u2014 a well. And\nof course we didn\u2019t have any animals any more \u2014 I mean, we had dogs, but \u2014 and\nchickens, but not the cows and stuff. So we used the barns mainly for garages.",
        "Q: For what?",
        "A: For garage.",
        "Q: Oh yeah.",
        "A: And also for our bicycles and \u2014 and tools and stuff.",
        "Q: Did it still look like a farm, or did it look like a villa in the outskirts of town?",
        "A: No, it looked like a farm. And it [indecipherable] three acres. And it actually, when I\ngrew up, was no longer on the outskirts of \u2014 of town, it was in town.",
        "Q: I see, in Frankfurt itself.",
        "A: Yes. So it \u2014 you know, the streetcar was a half a block away. So it \u2014 then I took the\nstreetcar to go to wo \u2014 to go to school. So it \u2014 it was really in the middle of town. And the\none thing I really regret, it \u2014 1t has been razed now, and I regret that because if historic\npreservation had come into life sooner, that thing would have stayed, because it\u2019s very\nunusual to have a farm in the middle of \u2014",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: \u2014 of town.",
        "Q: Of course.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: But, you know, in any ca \u2014 1n any case, where \u2014 the main house, when you faced it, sat\non the left, and it was really very beautiful. It was big house, and \u2014",
        "Q: How would you describe its style, its architectural style?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: How would you describe its architectural style?",
        "A: Well, it was just \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Twenty \u2014 turn of the century.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: A stucco house.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: And it had a \u2014 a gate in the front, which usually was open because we had cars, but\nyou could close the gate, and then it had a driveway, long driveway, which led you into\nthe courtyard. And next door was a boys\u2019 school, which was kind of nice when I grew up.\nBut it was really just beautiful, and we had a large, just garden for \u2014 to enjoy, and then we\nhad a lot of vegetables, and we had chickens. A-And \u2014 and we did have a lot of help. I-I\nthink we probably had three maids, and \u2014 and there was, from the \u2014 across the courtyard\nfrom the main house, there was th \u2014 at the end of the last barn there was another little\nhouse, and the \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the guy\u2019s name, it was sort of a \u2014 like a \u2014 a super in\nNovember 21, 2011\nan apartment building. He and his wife lived there, and you know, he would tend the\nfurnace, and do stuff like that.",
        "Q: So the ka \u2014 kind of housekeepers.",
        "A: Yeah. And \u2014 and then we had a gardener who lived in the same place upstairs, and I \u2014\nI think we had three maids and a cook, but I can\u2019t \u2014 yeah, I think we had three maids and\na cook. So I sometimes wonder what my mother did all day, but \u2014",
        "Q: Well, tell me a little bit about her. If I asked you about what your father\u2019s personality\nwas like, what was hers like?",
        "A: My mother enjoyed ill health.",
        "Q: Oh gosh.",
        "A: Well, she \u2014 she was \u2014 I\u2019m sure she had some ill health, but 1f she \u2014 if she did, I know,\nhad a stomach operation early in her marriage. I have a feeling it all \u2014 it had to do with\nnerves too, you know? And then she, in 1929 she had a major operation, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nif it was a hysterectomy, or something like that. And what is very unfortunate, she had a\nsurgeon who was addicted to morphine, and he got her addicted.",
        "Q: Oh dear.",
        "A: And she was addicted the rest of her life.",
        "Q: Oh dear, what a tragedy.",
        "A: And that was very unfortunate, because she was really a very wonderful person. But\nof course, I was only nine when this started, so I never really knew what a wonderful\nNovember 21, 2011\nperson she was. I knew it mainly through other people, who told me about it. She was,\nyou know, she had \u2014 of course had not gone to college, but she was pretty smart, and she\nhad a lot of common sense. And she was very \u2014 she had a lot of empathy. And I\u2019 tell\nyou a little story, during the depression, you know, in \u2014 starting in 1930, I guess, when\nthere was so much poverty in Germany, she started a soup kitchen at our house.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And it\u2019s one of my most vivid memories. We \u2014 the kitchen door was on the side, and\nthe kitchen door had \u2014 had sort of a window you could raise up to the outside. And we\nwould have, every day, about 20 people who came. After a while, we started giving out\nlittle slips to people, to say which day they could come, and \u2014 with their name. And I\nknow I used to write those slips, which is why I remember it so well. And then they\nwould come starting at noon, and our cook would have a big soup, you know, something\nsubstantial, and bread. And we had benches in the courtyard. And if it was raining, we\nput them in the \u2014 one of the barns. And then the people would eat their lun-lunch, or main\nmeal, I guess. In fact, we had one couple that found each other and got married. And then\non Christmas, she always had everybody come, and she \u2014 they got \u2014 the men got shaving\ncream and stuff like that, and the women got some other stuff. He \u2014 they \u2014 they all got the\nlittle bag with goodies. So she really, I mean, and that was entirely my mother\u2019s make \u2014\ndoing.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a very kind thought.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: And she really, I mean, that\u2019s the kind of person she was. But, of course, the addiction\nwas dreadful, because you know, a-an addiction to morphine is the same as \u2014 as a heroin\naddiction, or any other. It\u2019s unpredictable. The mood can be \u2014 one day you think, oh,\nshe\u2019s wonderful, and then you talk a lot, and then the next day she\u2019s gone again, you\nknow. And \u2014 and she did go into rehab twice in Germany, and then it was better for a\nwhile, but it never lasted. And then when she came to this country \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t\nknow where she got her morphine. That\u2019s sometimes the curse of having money. And \u2014\nbut a \u2014 it was the same in \u2014 in Tucson, where she lived, I mean, she \u2014 and in the end, it\nwa \u2014 was just awful. But you know, tha-that is \u2014 that was very sad, really.",
        "Q: Yeah. And hard for children.",
        "A: But, you know, it \u2014 the one thing I \u2014 I\u2014 I have told this to my kids from the day they\nwere born, in order to make sure that they stayed away from all drugs, because I told\nthem how horrible this is.",
        "Q: Well, the price that people pay. The price that the family pays, the price that the\nperson pays.",
        "A: It \u20141t\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s really very sad. But, you know \u2014 and \u2014 and I know \u2014 I mean, we all\nknow it was \u2014 it was her surgeon who got her addicted, and he was addicted him \u2014 a lot\nof doctors are addicted, I think.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: Well, before that happened, you would have been nine years or less, but you mention\nthat your parents would go out in the evenings. Did they \u2014 did they enjoy each other\u2019s\ncompany?",
        "A: Yes, they did. And \u2014 and, as I think I want to \u2014 I mean, they got divorced in \u201938. I\nthink it had na \u2014 it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that my mother was Jewish,\nand my father wasn\u2019t. My sister and I saw that divorce coming for years. Which doesn\u2019t\nmean they weren\u2019t friendly. They were very friendly, they always talked to each other\nand \u2014 and \u2014 but, you know, I \u2014 it\u2019s very hard to look at your parents and think about sex.",
        "Q: That\u2019s true.",
        "A: But I think it was very \u2014 they were incompatible. That\u2019s what I think, you know, and I\nthink that my father wasn\u2019t that interested in it, and my mother was more interested 1n it,\nand do I think that was the basis for the divorce. Because she got married again, but \u2014 to\nthe guy that she\u2019d been going with for years, anyway.",
        "Q: Did you all know about that?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Kids always know everything. Kids know everything.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, you just \u2014 you think your kids don\u2019t know? Kids always know.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: No, we \u2014 we both knew \u2014 my sister and I both knew it. But \u2014 and \u2014 but you know,\nthat\u2019s the way it was, and I know my father knew it. But you know, tha \u2014 it didn\u2019t seem \u2014\nthat\u2019s why I think that that was the basis.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And they were \u2014 when my mother died, six months before my father, and the one who\ngrieved the most was my father. So, you know, they were \u2014",
        "Q: There was a bond.",
        "A: Yeah, that wa \u2014 they were just always \u2014 and he came over here and visited with her\nand her husband, and \u2014",
        "Q: This is after the war, yes?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and during \u2014 and after the war she went back to Germany once and stayed with\nmy father, you know, so \u2014 I mean, they were very good friends, they really liked each\nother. It\u2019s just, I think in bed they didn\u2019t mesh. So, you know, I mean, yeah, you don\u2019t\nthink about that when you\u2019re a child.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 as you were growing up, were you upset by these things, were you hurt by\nthese things?",
        "A: No, we just knew that it was going on.",
        "Q: I see.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: You know, and \u2014 and that this guy, I mean, I could never stand her second husband,\nbut \u2014 and I think partly, perhaps because I felt he interfered, but I\u2019m not sure I just didn\u2019t\nlike him anyway. But, no, he \u2014 he \u2014 he was a friend of the family and he \u2014 they traveled\ntogether, all of them, and you know, it \u2014 it was \u2014 was just one of those \u2014",
        "Q: Your grandparents on both sides, the in-laws, the larger, extended family, did they like\neach other? Did they get along?",
        "A: When my \u2014I-\u2014 my father\u2019s parents were dead when I was born.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So I don\u2019t know anything about that.",
        "Q: What about your uncles, his brothers?",
        "A: His brothers, they were odd. Neither one of them got married. His older brother, the\noldest one I think was gay. I\u2019m pretty sure he was gay. In fact, \u2019'm sure he was gay. And\nhe lived not very far from where we lived, and he had a little \u2014 sort of a \u2014 in Germany\nyou know you \u2014 you sometimes have these little yards, that you can bring \u2014 where there\nare little houses that you [indecipherable]. Well, he had one of those little houses on our\nproperty, which of course was where he grew up, and he would come and \u2014 and \u2014 in the\nsummer with his friends, and so on and so forth. But \u2014 and his other brother I really never\nknew. He died in 1921.",
        "Q: Ah. Yeah, so, you to \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: And so I\u2014I never knew him. But the fa \u2014 th-the older one, I knew quite well. He died\nin \u00b031, and \u2014",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: But we \u2014 Heinrich(ph).",
        "Q: Heinrich(ph), mm-hm. Uncle Heinrich(ph).",
        "A: And the other one\u2019s name was George. But neither one of them ever mar \u2014 well, the\none was gay, I mean, I\u2019m sure he was gay. He lived with his friend in an apartment not\nvery far. And my grandparents on my mother\u2019s side, adored my father.",
        "Q: Well, I was thinking that, because a bank is a huge business.",
        "A: Yeah. They adored my father and \u2014 and in fact, when my grandmother died \u2014 she\nlived to be 89 \u2014 I can\u2019t remember exactly the date. That \u2014 that\u2019s my family tree.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: And I can take it off, and you can look at it. When she died, she left my father money.\nAnd she left a letter saying he had always been wonderful, and \u2014 and all this kind of stuff.\nNo, she \u2014 they were very fond of my father. They also didn\u2019t much like my mother\u2019s\nsecond husband, which is interesting because my mother\u2019s second husband was a Jew.\nBut they didn\u2019t like him much either. But \u2014 and okay, so th-they \u2014 and we saw my\ngrandparents, my mother\u2019s parents, a lot un \u2014 19 \u2014 until 1933. They had a summer house\nin KOnigstein, which is \u2014",
        "Q: Where is that?\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 nowadays it \u2014 it\u2019s almost a suburb of Frankfurt now because people live there and\ncommute in. But at the time you \u2014 you took either a car, or a train, and it took about an\nhour to get there, I mean, at that time.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And we would spend s-summer vacation sometimes and always fall vacations there\nwith my grandparents and with my mother\u2019s sister and her family.",
        "Q: Did your mother have only one sister?",
        "A: My mother had two sisters. One was older. Sh-She is the one who \u2014 who made those\ntwo charcoal drawings of my grandparents, the grandfather and great-grandfather. She\nwas quite talented that way, but she was really a bitch on wheels.",
        "Q: Oh dear me, really?",
        "A: Yeah, she was, and she collected people, important people. That was her aim in life,\nshe collected important people. And she was also a manipulator. But, you know, sh-she\ndid have talent, I mean, those pictures are very nice.",
        "Q: They\u2019re very well done.",

        "Q: Was she nice to you, as her nieces, or not very?",
        "A: Yeah, she was fine. I mean, you know, she was just \u2014 we saw them a bit \u2014 those two\nwomen didn\u2019t get \u2014 I mean, they didn\u2019t have much in common. And then she had a\nNovember 21, 2011\nyounger sister, whom I never knew, because she died, I think, in 1922. She must have\nbeen very smart. And she was \u2014 of the three girls, she went to the university. And she\nwrote poems. She also was a \u2014 I don\u2019t know, she was a very good Jew; the only one in\nthat family. But she, and some of the po \u2014 my grandmother had the poems printed after\nshe died. And I don\u2019t know if I \u2014 I know I gave Steven one of the copies.",
        "Q: Steven is your son.",
        "A: But \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. Just to make that clear in the interview, okay.",
        "A: And she died, she must have been 21, I think.",

        "A: Her name was Lucy. She was called Luchs(ph).",
        "Q: Luchs(ph).",
        "A: And she was my godmother, and I don\u2019t know for sure what she died of. They said it\nwas typhus, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not really sure, you know, in 1921, you can\u2019t be sure.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I know sh \u2014 that she was in the hospital, she was supposed to go somewhere for the\nsummer, and she got terrible intestinal problems and \u2014 and died.",
        "Q: And your other aunt, the one who was \u2014 I won\u2019t use that expression, but I love it \u2014 the\none who collected people.",

        "A: \u2014 which was always hard.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: But \u2014 and I think some of the problem stemmed from the fact that she was the middle\nchild, because the youngest one, who was 10 years younger than my mother \u2014",
        "Q: Ah yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 was obviously my grandmother\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: Favorite, huh?",
        "A: Yes. And \u2014 and the older one was a manipulator and knew what to get, and my mother\nwas just in the middle.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I\u2019m sure that that was part of her problems. But, in any ca \u2014 my aunt had two\nchildren, a boy and a girl. The boy was called Erish(ph), and the girl was Anina(ph), like\nSteven\u2019s youngest daughter. And the boy died when he was 21.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: They always said he died of appendicitis, but actually he died of syphilis, because he\ndidn\u2019t take care of it, and then got sepsis.",
        "Q: Ay-ay.",
        "A: But, you know, that you couldn\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: One doesn\u2019t say those things.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t say that, so 1t was appendicitis, but we all knew what he died of. And he\nhad been my aunt\u2019s favorite, and my cousin often stayed with us, the bo \u2014 the girl,\nbecause my ca \u2014 aunt didn\u2019t much care for her. But after the boy died, of course \u2014",
        "Q: She\u2019s the only one left.",
        "A: She was the only one left, and then so \u2014 but I was on very good terms with my cousin\nwho died probably five years ago in Switzerland.",
        "Q: This \u2014 this is his sister, right?",
        "A: Yeah, the \u2014 the sisters \u2014 my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s daughter.",

        "A: Her name was Anina(ph) von Malk(ph).",
        "Q: Ah, yeah [indecipherable] yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: As a married. She was \u2014 you know, there \u2014 there\u2019s some people in my family you\nshould have interviewed rather than me, because my cousin Anina(ph) married a man\nNovember 21, 2011\ncalled von Malk(ph), who was also a Jew, and my \u2014 I will say my aunt arranged that\nmarriage. And they \u2014 he was working in what was then Palestine, in Haifa \u2014",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: \u2014 for a British company. And then they came to England and lived in London, and\nthen when \u2014 during the war, when everybody got worried about being occupied by\nGermany, they took a boat, which they thought would take them to Mexico or to the\nUnited States; however, it only took them to Antigua.",
        "Q: What was the name of the boat?",
        "A: Hm?",

And then they went to Mexico City, and her husband was a \u2014 a amateur chef,\nhowever they \u2014 they opened a restaurant in Mexico City. First they did some catering,\nNovember 21, 2011\nand then they opened a restaurant. And they did very well, I think. And then they went\nback to Switzerland and got a divorce, but \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s a different story.",
        "A: But that\u2019s a different story. But anyway, that was sort of an interesting life \u2014",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, to \u2014 to have been stranded in Antigua \u2014 there again, they had money,\nwhich helped.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know. But \u2014",
        "Q: Well, you know, when you think of \u2014 according to, you know, the \u2014 the purpose of\nwhy we do these interviews, they\u2019re Holocaust related. And you can say that okay, how\nmuch of the actual Holocaust does someone experience in Antigua, but their lives were\naffected by these policies.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely.",
        "Q: There\u2019s no question about that, so.",
        "A: There\u2019s no \u2014 there\u2019s no question. I mean, you know, I can \u2014 I said to somebody the\nother day, and I said, you know, I\u2019ve now been in Washington \u2014 oh, how\u2019s my \u2014 how\nold\u2019s my daughter? Fifty-six, so \u2019ve been here 56 years, in Washington. In the state I\u2019ve\nbeen longer.

        "Q: Scattered.",
        "A: \u2014 scattered everywhere. And that \u2014 that is an impact to \u2014 I mean, it is not, of course, a\nconcentration camp or anything like that, but \u2014 but it does affect you.",
        "Q: Yes. Well, tell me about your grandparents. Of all of the pieces of the puzzle now, that\nwe ve had a \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, my mother\u2019s parents.",
        "Q: Your mother\u2019s parents.",
        "A: Well, they \u2014",
        "Q: What were they like? Who were they and what were they like?",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 my grandmother was about probably three inches taller than my\ngrandfather. Very tall, erect person. I\u2019ll show you pictures later. And my grandfather was\na very nice man, rather short, like my husband too, and we are all short. And his \u2014 his\nnickname was Bubish(ph).",
        "Q: Bubish(ph).",
        "A: Yeah. But his name was Ludwig, Ludwig Arnold. All the Hahns were L.A.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And \u2014 because that\u2019s what the fa \u2014 firm was called. And \u2014",
        "Q: But did the L.A. in the firm stand for Ludwig Arnold?\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Well, I think originally it stood for Louis Aldous(ph), or something like that, for a\ngreat \u2014 they were all L.A.:s.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 but he he was Ludwig Arnold. And they lived \u2014 they had a house in\nFrankfurt, not far from the bank. And in fact, it was close to the elementary school I\nwent to, and I sometimes went there after school, you know, in \u2014 in Germany school is\nonly til lunchtime, and \u2014 or used to be. And then they had that house in Switzerland \u2014 in\n\u2014 in K6nigstein.",
        "Q: Correct, mm-hm.",
        "A: And \u2014 where they spent time \u2014 they traveled a great deal, and they had a lot of money.\nI wish some were left, but \u2014 but that \u2014",
        "Q: Well, did you feel it when you were with them, in how they lived, or \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, none of my family lived like they had a lot of money.",
        "Q: So, they weren\u2019t ostentatious.",
        "A: Nah. But, I mean, okay, they had \u2014 they had a car, and a sofa, you know, but \u2014 but so\ndid other people, I mean that \u2014 but they were \u2014 didn\u2019t live in a mansion \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 they lived in a \u2014 in a house, and they had that other house in Konigstein, but \u2014 and\nthey traveled a lot, but you know \u2014 and I never knew that we had money. I met a woman\nhere, no \u2014 a few years ago again, that I went to high school with, by chance, and she said\nto me, well, you were the rich girl. I said, I was? And she said, well, you had a car.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, you know, but that just didn\u2019t register. And you know, you don\u2019t pay attention.\nUnless you live ostentatious, you don\u2019t pay attention.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean, we \u2014 I had to take the streetcar to \u2014 to go to school, or my bicycle. I mean, no\n\u2014no chauffeur took me to school, and \u2014 or picked me up, or anything like that. We had\nno sofa, my parents, and my mother got a car early, a Peugeot, in 1929, I think. And she\nwas a good driver, and my father was not a very good driver. But she was a good driver.\nAnd I know it was one of the early cars in Frankfurt, and \u2014 but anyway, my\ngrandparents no \u2014 and then \u2014 I can\u2019t quite remember, but in \u2014 I think it was in 1929, when\nmy grandfather was 70, we all stayed \u2014 went to Locarno \u2014",
        "Q: In Switzerland.",
        "A: \u2014 and we all stayed in a hotel, and \u2014 and \u2014 to celebrate my grandfather\u2019s birthday, my\nsister and I had to do a little sketch that my aunt had written. Terrible. But \u2014 and I think it\nwas at that time that they looked at property in \u2014 in the \u2014 in Ticino, on the \u2014",
        "Q: And Ticino, is \u2014 is in Switzerland as well.\nNovember 21, 2011",

        "A: No, oh. Okay. Well, I\u2019Il show you the book later.",
        "Q: Okay. Yeah, uh-huh.",
        "A: Albert Hahn, who was also at the bank, was a \u2014 a well-known economist.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: He was my grandfather\u2019s nephew, and he bought a house right there, at \u2014 near\nAscona.",
        "Q: Can you tell me \u2014 you mentioned this place before; was it on the \u2014 Ticino on a lake?",
        "A: Ah, no, Ticino is \u2014 it\u2019s the county.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And the lake is the Laco Maggiore.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, that\u2019s what I was \u2014 Laco Mazora(ph)?",
        "A: Yeah. And the Laco Maggiore 1s half in Italy and half in Switzerland.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And Ticino is the Italian county or whatever they\u2019re called, in Switzerland. You\nknow, Switzerland is \u2014 1s three parts, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 Italian, French and German. And Ticino is the Italian part. And I think my mother\u2019s\ncousin bought the house there in ninet \u2014 when we were all there.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: In 1929.",
        "A: And the first time we went there for vacation, I think, was in 1932, but we stayed at\nmy cousin\u2019s, at my uncle\u2019s house. And at that point, I think my grandparents bought a\nhouse there, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not sure of the date when they bought it, but they \u2014 it wa \u2014 by\n1933 they had a house in Switzerland, on the lake. And I think it was the end of \u201933, or\nearly \u00b034 that they left Germany.",
        "Q: And you mentioned in what you wrote to us there, they also had Swiss citizenship.",
        "A: Yeah, they \u2014",
        "Q: How did they come by that?",
        "A: Well, they had dual citizenship. [Il tell you, this goes back, I think, maybe to the war\nof 1848, or something like that, or maybe the 1870 war. I\u2019m not sure which war, but\nsome war, where you could not serve if you had different citizenship, and you could buy\nthe Swiss citizenship.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: Which is what one fwo \u2014 great-grandfather of \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know who, but one of\nthe great-grand \u2014 my \u2014 either my great-grandfather on my mother\u2019s side, or my great-\ngreat-grandfather on my mother\u2019s side, bought the Swiss citizenship. And from there on,\nthey were all \u2014 they all had dual citizenship.",
        "Q: Who knew that that could be so useful?",
        "A: Right. It was extremely useful.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And so 1-1t was, I think, in \u201933, or \u201934 that my grandparents decided to move to\nSwitzerland permanently. And as I wrote to you, they gave up that German citizenship at\nthe consulate in Lugano, | think, and the consul asked why.",
        "Q: And what did they say?",
        "A: And my grandmother said, three guesses. Well, it \u2014",
        "Q: Well, tell me a little bit about \u2014 oh, if you wanted to say something, I don\u2019t want to\ninterrupt you.",
        "A: No, no, that \u2014 it was just \u2014 1t was just very fortunate.",
        "Q: Of course, of course.",
        "A: You know, I mean, that really \u2014 all of that \u2014 you know, relationships in families are\nvery important, and make a lot of difference. And I\u2019Il tell you why I say this. The bank, I\ntold you, was in \u2014 was a company with shares, I mean \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 public. However, it was \u2014 all the shares were family held. And my grandfather and\nthis nephew that I was talking about, were chairmen, or whatever.",
        "Q: Erish(ph)?",
        "A: No, Albert, the \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, Albert Hahn the economist.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. They \u2014 they were \u2014 Albert Hahn also was a professor at the university in\nFrankfurt, but I mean, his main job was at the bank. And then, of course, in \u00b033, it all\nbecame more difficult. My mother\u2019s sister\u2019s husband was also at the bank, but he was not\nvery competent. Was a nice guy, but not very competent. And my father at that point, was\nworking at a different bank that belonged to my grandmother\u2019s brother. And then, in \u201934\nor so, I think, they asked my father to leave that bank and come to the Deutsche Effecten\nWechselbank. But of course, all of that, I mean nu \u2014 and \u2014 and my grandfather left, and\nthe nephew left. But of course, it still was a bank with a lot of Jewish connections.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And the \u2014 the se \u2014 many \u2014 much of the shares were held by the family. When my\ngrandmother had a \u2014 a cousin \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m never quite sure what the relationship is, but it\u2019s\nsort of a cousin, or a nephew, or whatever, who had been the black sheep in the family,\nand had been exiled by the family to South Africa, where fortunately, he went into\ndiamond mines.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And he did extremely well. In fact, he was knighted by the Queen of England.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: And because they did a lot of charity work then.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: And nobody in the family had been friendly with him, but my grandmother was\nalways friendly with him. And I remember the guy very well, because he used to come\nbring me big boxes of chocolates. And I also have a very beautiful diamond brooch that\nhe gave my mother. So anyway, they kept up very closely, and of course, he was British\nby now, and his family acquired the shares. So that during the Nazi time, the shares were\nall in British ownership, which made an enormous difference, of course, because they\ncouldn\u2019t really \u2014",
        "Q: Touch them.",
        "A: \u2014 reach the bank.",
        "Q: So the money was saved, and s \u2014",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was more or less saved, yes. And \u2014",
        "Q: And did your family relations say \u2014 stay intact, with these kinds of changes?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Which 1s also quite an achievement, you know.",
        "A: Yeah. And I know \u2014 I mean, I remember, this guy\u2019s name was Max Michaelas(ph),\nand \u2014 and Lady Michaelas(ph), I remember her, you know. And \u2014 and after the war, my\nniece went to stay with their kids in England, you know, so \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve lost track of\nthem now, but it\u2019s, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: So, if I can back up to understand this better, it meant that during the time right when\nthe Nazis come to power in 1933, your grandfather has these family connections, where\nthey have some foresight as to they see where things are going, and they transfer the\nownership \u2014",
        "A: Well, they bought them, or whatever.",

        "A: Right.",

        "A: It was a private bank, like a lot of private banks in Frankfurt were. I think it was well\nrespected and pretty big. Not \u2014 but not like the Bank of America or anything, it was\nsimply a private bank.\nNovember 21, 2011",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: And actually he and \u2014 and my aunt\u2019s husband was also Aryan. He \u2014",
        "Q: I thought he was Jewish, the aunt \u2014",
        "A: No, my aunt \u2014 my mother\u2019s sister \u2014",
        "Q: Nora.",
        "A: \u2014 no, her husband won \u2014 her daughter married a Jew.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, 1t was \u2014 1t wa \u2014 okay.",
        "A: But her husband was not a Jew.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And so the two of them.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But as I said before, her husband was not so bright. He was a nice guy.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Okay.",
        "A: But \u2014 but was what \u2014 best I can say.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 and so anyway, tho-those two and he \u2014 but he retired during the war. So then\nmy father was it.",
        "Q: So pretty mu \u2014 so in other words another significant, what I would say fact, is that\nthey family business did not get destroyed during the war, it remained throughout the war\nto the end. Is that correct?\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Right. I mean, the building was pretty well \u2014 not destroyed, but was pretty damaged.\nBut it\u2019s in the middle of Frankfurt, and as you know, Frankfurt was 80 percent\ndestroyed.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, you know, it \u2014 it had a lot of damage, but they \u2014",
        "Q: But as a business.",
        "A: But \u2014 yeah, as a business they stayed. And of course, how banking, you know, it was\naltogether different. What was very nice \u2014 you know, Frankfurt was occupied in nine \u2014\nin March of 1945, a couple of months before the end of the war. And I think the day after\nwe were occupied, this Jeep drove up and asked for my father, and he was there, because\nat that point nobody went anyplace. And they took him in the Jeep, and left. And we\nwere a little worried, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean, they were Americans, of course, but you know \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 we were a little worried. And then he came back, which pleased us.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And he said he had been asked to reopen the banks in Frankfurt.",
        "Q: All of them?\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Well, to \u2014 to open the trade again. Because obviously OSS knew exactly who we\nwere.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: There was no question.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: So that was very nice.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then he said yes, the Americans had that \u2014 this and that and the other, so I said to\nhim, as long as you\u2019re talking to the Americans, ask them if \u2014 I could work there as an\ninterpreter, and I did. So \u2014 but 1t was a scary minute when they came with the Jeep and\npicked him up and we didn\u2019t know what was going on.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t know why, and \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 and it had just been occupied.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Of course. Well, this is \u2014 it\u2019s an interesting part of the story, but we have jumped over\na bridge.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to the 30s, and let\u2019s see if I can ask one last question about your\ngrandparents. Grandma\u2019s taller than Grandpa. His \u2014 his nickname is Bubish(ph) \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 Bubish(ph). And did you enjoy being around them?",
        "A: Yes. Well, you know, of course, it was a different time.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And I certainly didn\u2019t have the relationship with my grandparents that I have with my\nown grandchildren now.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because they were people of respect, you know, and so \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s more formality.",
        "A: Yeah. It wasn\u2019t a ra \u2014 I liked them and they liked us, but 1t wasn\u2019t a close relation \u2014 I\nmean, I \u2014 I would not go and tell them a story, or anything like that. But \u2014 and my\ngrandparent \u2014 my grandfather had a \u2014 a favorite thing. When my parents called, if we\nwere in \u2014 in one of their houses in KOnigstein, and my parents called and say how are the\nkids, and my grandfather would say, they are so nice when they\u2019re asleep. But that was a\nfavorite saying.",
        "Q: Of course, of course.",
        "A: But you know, they were nice, and \u2014 and I enjoyed them, but I can\u2019t say I had a close\nrelationship with them. But we enjoyed each other. And then they \u2014 my grandfather died\nin Los Angeles.",
        "Q: After the war?\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: When?",
        "A: In 1945, I think.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: Well, in 1941, my mother and my aunt were at that point both in the United States.\nMy mother lived in Tucson, and my aunt lived in Santa Monica. And my grandparents\ndecided to come and spend Christmas with them in 1941. Which was not a good idea,\nbecause that way they couldn\u2019t get back.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Because you know what happened in 1941. So they were stuck in Los Angeles. So\nthey spent the war in Los Angeles.",
        "Q: On the other hand it\u2019s a very good idea.",
        "A: So then my fa \u2014 and my grandfather died there. I mean, he was 89, but you know, he \u2014\nhe died there, and my grandmother went back to Switzerland.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: After he died. She went back in \u201947.",
        "Q: So a\u2014 yes, it\u2019s \u2014 Switzerland was safe, but still, Los Angeles was a bit safer.",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was. But they \u2014 I think they were sorry they were not in their home.",
        "Q: In Switzerland, yeah.",
        "A: You know.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: What is it that I wanted to ask you now? Ah, at the very beginning you mentioned that\nthere were many mixed marriages in Frankfurt \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 when your parents got married. Tell me a little bit about identity, if one can. Was\nyour family, your mother\u2019s side of the family very Jewish?",
        "A: No, apparently not. I mean, I \u2014",
        "Q: And how does one define not being very Jewish?",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I mean, I all \u2014 I always knew that my grandparents were Jews,\nand that my mother was Jewish by heritage. Which, I know a lot of other girls I knew\nwho were in the same boat did not know, and were absolutely shocked in \u00b033.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. I knew several of them, where they just never knew that they had any connection\nto Jews. My grandparents, I don\u2019t know that they ever went to synagogue, but I know\nYom Kippur seemed to fall mainly during farm vacations, and we often spent our farm\nvacations at my grandparents\u2019 house in KOnigstein, and my grandmother always locked\nherself into a bedroom on Yom Kippur, and said she was fasting. Now, my cousin, and\nwe always said, well, she\u2019s got the cupboard full of cookies, and she\u2019s probably not\nfasting, but I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: She may well have been fasting. But that is all I know, that \u2014 that was the only Jewish\nthing.",
        "Q: In the house.",
        "A: Yeah. So they \u2014 as I said, my mother\u2019s youngest sister, I think was a devout Jew, but I\nnever knew her. And now \u2014",
        "Q: So the fact that your parents came from different \u2014 now, was your father\u2019s family\nLutheran, or Catholic?",
        "A: German Reformed.",
        "Q: Oh, German Reformed, okay, so Protestant.",
        "A: Which is much better than Lutheran, and has nothing to do with Catholic.",
        "Q: No, it has nothing to do with Catholic.",
        "A: I\u2014I tell you, German Reformed was a small group in Frankfurt, which had been\npersecuted in the late 1800s.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes, and we \u2014 our church \u2014 and I was brought up in that church \u2014 our church had \u2014\nyou couldn\u2019t see from the outside that it was a church, it just looked like a house. Had no\nstained glass windows, no tower, no bell, no nothing. But inside there was a real church.\nAnd it was a small congregation. My father was very active in it after the war, I don\u2019t\nknow. He and my sister got into religion, and I don\u2019t know why, but \u2014 which is not where\nNovember 21, 2011\nI got. And so there were a lot of old Frankfurt families that belonged to the German\nReform. There\u2019s also French Reform, but \u2014 which came from the Huguenots, you know.",
        "Q: Ah, okay.",
        "A: There were a lot of Huguenots that came from France to the Frankfurt area, and\nthere \u2014 you find a lot of French names there. But this was German Reform. Now, we\nalways had Christmas, and my mother\u2019s birthday happened to be on the 25\" of\nDecember.",
        "Q: Oh, the poor thing. No double presents.",
        "A: Yeah. And my daughter\u2019s on the 23\". And I remember that my grandparents used to\ncome for her birthday, and we always got Christmas presents. I mean, there was nothing\nof Hanukkah, anything like that. So, at \u2014 somehow they \u2014 they had sort of embraced my\nfam \u2014 my father\u2019s family, and \u2014 and I don\u2019t know, and I think a lot of those mixed\nmarriages in Frankfurt were that way. And I knew a lot of people who were in mixed\nmarriages. I \u2014 I think 1t was, 1f you pardon the expression, more the upper crust, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But, it \u2014 it just was nothing unusual.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting to know that.",
        "A: Yeah.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: You know, it\u2019s interesting, because I had interviews with people at other parts of\nEurope \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 where there was a mixed marriage, and it was highly unusual, highly unusual. Be \u2014\nit was different societies, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 no, in Frankfurt it was every day, you know.",
        "Q: Did you see yourself as Christian? Did you have any feeling of being Christian?",
        "A: Well, I tell you, I grew up, of course, since \u2014 since we seemed to be more on my\nfather\u2019s religion, I went to confirmation class, I was confirmed in the German Reform\nchurch. And then I married my husband. And he didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with\nreligion, period, because he said he can\u2019t believe that any God would allow what\nhappened, you know. So, he said, you do whatever you want to do. So since I grew up\nthat way, I had both my kids baptized, which is more than my son has done, or \u2014 and it\ndidn\u2019t mean anything to me, it was \u2014 I did it more to please my father, because at that\npoint he and my sister were very engaged in that church. And so I had them both baptized\n\u2014 they both went to \u2014 I joined briefly the Westmoreland Congregational Church here,\nbecause I was looking for a church that wasn\u2019t too churchy. And so that was fine, and the\nkids went there for \u2014 for Sunday school, til they were about nine or 10, and then they said\nwe \u2014 all we do is draw pictures. And they both went to [indecipherable] Friends, which\nof course, the Quaker school. Somehow I tend more to Jewish stuff now. It\u2019s not that I\nNovember 21, 2011\nwould join a synagogue, or do anything on that order, but I find it more interesting. And\nyou know, my daughter married a Jew, and \u2014 the family is interesting. I mean, my\ndaughter married a Jew, Steven is in \u2014 belongs to the Episcopal church. His wife is a\nlapsed Catholic who won\u2019t cross any church\u2019s door. The kids were not baptized, but my\ndaughter\u2019s three boys were \u2014 had a Bar Mitzvah. They \u2014 they \u2014",
        "Q: And try and figure out the identity, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, they belong to the synagogue, and now her two older boys \u2014 the middle boy is\nnever going to \u2014 interested anything.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about your daughter\u2019s children?",
        "A: My daughter\u2019s three boys. The middle boy \u2014 the two older ones are in college, and my\ndaughter has said to them, you know, you are Bar Mitzvahed, and you do what you want\nto do, and it\u2019s your choi \u2014 call now. The older one claims that he kept the high holidays.\nThe younger \u2014 the middle one will have nothing to do with any of it. The youngest one,\nwho 1s still in high school, is very interested. So, you know, I think si\u2014 my son\u2019s three\nchildren were baptized, but that\u2019s about it. And I don\u2019t think they ever go to church or do\nanything. It \u2014 you know, families are interesting.",
        "Q: Yeah. And it also is a reality that somehow or other, you know, gets pushed into anar\n\u2014 you know, political forces. Because now I want to bring back to how somebody defines\nthemself, 1s from the inside, and how you are defined by others from the outside.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: So what I would like to talk about 1s \u2014 we didn\u2019t mention this yet \u2014 your school years,\nwhen you went to public school. Not only di \u2014 yeah, so not only did kids see you as the\nrich girl \u2014",
        "A: Well, I went to private school first.",
        "Q: Okay. So let\u2019s talk about that.",
        "A: The same one that my mother went to, my sister went to, and in fact, my nieces \u2014 my\nniece went to. A little private school in Frankfurt. Now, for reasons that I cannot\nfathom, my sister had \u2014 who is two years old \u2014 who was two years older, as I told you,\nhad changed to a public school, when she got into high school, I guess.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that public school was on the other side of the river. I don\u2019t even know why, but\nit was supposed to be so good, you know. Which was fine. That was in 1931. Now, my\ntime came in 1933.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a very crucial time.",
        "A: Which is a different time.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: And for reasons that I cannot fathom, my parents decided I would go to the public\nschool.",
        "Q: Hang on just a second here. We\u2019re going to end this track.",
        "A: Do that. Pll have a cigarette.\n44November 21, 2011",
        "Q: Okay \u2014 of our interview, and go onto another track in \u2014 shortly. So this is the end of\ntrack 13 of our interview with Judith Heimann, by the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum.\nEnd of File One\nNovember 21, 2011\nBeginning File Two",
        "Q: Good afternoon, this is track 14, and a conua \u2014 continuation of our interview with\nMrs. Judith Heimann, in Bethesda, Maryland, on November 21\u2018, 2011, and we were\ntalking about schools \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 and your experience in school, and you were saying that when you started pub \u2014\npublic school, it was 1933.",
        "A: 1933.",
        "Q: And so what do you remember about that time?",
        "A: Well, that was a very unfortunate choice that my parents made, I \u2014 I \u2014 I mentioned\nearlier that my mother was not well.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And in early \u201933, she had a nervous breakdown, which I think was related to Hitler\u2019s\ntaking o \u2014 my mother is one of the very few people that I know, who had read \u201cMein\nKampf,\u201d and knew what was coming. And so I think she had a nervous breakdown, and\ntherefore didn\u2019t really think about my school. I mean, I do \u2014 I don\u2019t blame her, you know,\nwhen you're sick, you\u2019re sick. So anyway, they sent me to public school, and of course in\n1933, you shouldn\u2019t send a half-Jew to public school who \u2014 when you have a private\nschool where you\u2019ve been.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: The explanation was that that private school would require Greek for graduation, and\nthey didn\u2019t want to have me do that, but you know, I-I \u2014 I think that\u2019s a lame excuse,\nbecause you know, other kids could learn it too, so why couldn\u2019t I have learned what I\nneeded to learn? But in any case, they sent me \u2014",
        "Q: Do you think they just weren\u2019t thinking?",
        "A: I think nobody thought much, because I think it was a horrible time. A-And you know,\nyou change schools in Germany, or you didn\u2019t; in any case, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like\nnow; on Easter, after Easter, that\u2019s when the new year starts. And that was pretty soon\nafter Hitler took over, and I think they just never thought. In any case, I went to that\nschool, and there was one a\u2014 one more half-Jewish girl in the class, and one girl who was\na full Jew, and the rest were not. The other half-Jewish girl, unfortunately her last name\nwas Solomon, which of course, a much more Jewish name than Bartmann was. And we\nhad a classroom teacher who was really a Nazi. And some of the other teachers were too,\nand of course, some of the girls were. And it was not always pleasant. There \u2014 I \u2014 I did\nhave two or three friends, or four sa \u2014 more even. In fact, one of my high school friends is\nstill alive, like I am. She lives in Frankfurt, and my niece takes care of her, because she\nnever married, and she\u2019s alone, and so my niece takes care of her. But \u2014 and she was my\nfriend. I'll tell you about her in a minute, because she is also an interesting case. But, you\nknow, like on Saturdays, for instance \u2014 you were always on the outside \u2014 on Saturdays,\nanybody who belonged to the BDM, you know, Bund Deutscher Machen(ph) \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: Bund Deutscher Madel.",
        "A: \u2014 was off. But those of us who didn\u2019t, had to come to school. And there were about 10\nof us 1n the class, six or eight who had to come to school, and then we had meaningless\nclasses, because we had to have meaningless class, because the others weren\u2019t there. But,\nyou know, you were an outsider. I mean, you weren\u2019t part of the group. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did the teachers treat you differently? Were they \u2014 was \u2014 was your teacher, for\nexample, did she treat you differently?",
        "A: Well, we had this one tea \u2014 they were mostly men, their \u2014 the classroom teacher was\nour Latin teacher also, and I don\u2019t know, I got terrible grades. I was very poor \u2014 I-I\nwouldn\u2019t say I was \u2014 I never did homework, which didn\u2019t help. And \u2014 and I was a little\nheavy at the time, and quite busty. And he would always say, you seem to be leaning on\nthe table like a pudding.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s very cruel to say.",
        "A: Which 1s not really what you like to hear, you know?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: And in any case, from him I got horrible grades. I think he taught Latin and French.",
        "Q: How does one say that, by the way, in German?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: You\u2019re leaning on the table like a pudding. [speaks German]",
        "A: [Speaks German]\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: That\u2019s very cruel to a 13 year old.",
        "A: Oh, it\u2019s horrible.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I got really terrible grades, and \u2014 and the more \u2014 I think he tried psychology on\nme, but it didn\u2019t work. And the more he did this, the worse I got in school. And a \u2014 one\nsemester he was not there, and I got very good grades from some other teacher. So, I\nmean, I \u2014 I think a lot had to do with that. In any case, I went there for three years, and I\nreally \u2014 I mean, I wasn\u2019t unhappy, but it was just not a good experience. It \u2014 it was\nstupid.",
        "Q: So \u2014 but you felt the \u2014 you felt the atmosphere, I guess that \u2014 that\u2019s what \u2014",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. Now, for instance, we had \u2014 the school had sort of a summer\nplace, or a\u2014a place in the country where they would take the \u2014 each class for \u2014 for a\nweek at a time, or something. Now, the girl who was a full Jew was not allowed to go.\nAnd the other one who wa \u2014 whose name was Solomon, they debated for a long time\nwhether she could go. Now, they didn\u2019t say anything to me, because my last name was \u2014",
        "Q: Bartmann, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 different. But, you know, you always weren\u2019t sure, were you go \u2014 were you gonna\nbe able to do this, and of course, you want to do this when \u2014",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: \u2014 go with your class, you know.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: And there were many things like that, that you felt people are looking at you ina\ndifferent way.",
        "Q: Was this \u2014 are you say-saying now, not only in school, but in general, when you were",
        "A: Well, that came later.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That was not in school, I didn\u2019t notice that so much. But somehow it was \u2014 it was very\nunfortunate. And then my sister had gone to boarding school in England, in 1935, I\nthink. And in 1936 \u2014 I-I\u2019m trying to get the dates right, yes, I think it was 1936, they\ndecided I would go to \u2014 to a\u2014 a boarding school in England. And I ha \u2014 I didn\u2019t know\nthis til almost the end of the school year \u2014 of course, that was the time nobody asked you\nif you want to do this, you were just simply told, that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. And so I said\nto that classroom teacher, I said, I\u2019m leaving. Whereupon he said to me, if you had told\nme sooner, I would have given you the grades you really deserve, but I didn\u2019t know you\nweren\u2019t coming back. Which was very interesting, you know. So he said, you really\ndeserved better. But anyway, you know \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable]\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 you \u2014 you just don\u2019t know. So I went to boarding school in England, which I\nabsolutely hated. My sister loved it, I just absolutely hated it. But part of it, I think, was\nbecause my mother had left Germany at the end of \u201934, I think.",
        "Q: Is that when she left the home?",
        "A: Yes. That\u2019s when she went to England.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And it may have been early \u00b035, like I\u2019m not a hundred percent sure of the date. And\nmy sister had gone to boarding school, so I was home alone with my father, who was\nvery lenient, and I did what I wanted to do. Not homework for sure, but \u2014 but everything\nelse. I just had a good time. And then I went to England to this boarding school, where\nevery minute of the day is programmed.",
        "Q: Oh. It\u2019s like prison.",
        "A: I mean there \u2014 yeah. I mean, there is no escape. You leave your \u2014 at that time, you \u2014\nyou leave your bedroom, which, well the bedroom was for all the girls, at 7:30 in the\nmorning for breakfast, and you\u2019re not allowed to come back til the evening. You have to\ntake everything you have to have, with you. Well, I hated the whole place, and I was\nthere for one year. Nobody had asked me if I wanted to go, but I went. And then, after the\nyear, they decided I would go to Switzerland to learn French. Now there, I will say, they\ngave me a choice of two different schools, which I went, inspected with my father. And\none of the things I had hated in that boarding school, among other things, was the\nNovember 21, 2011\nbathrooms, which you shared with a million kids. So I chose the little school, where you\nhad a bathroom where you could lock the door. So I went there, and there were only\nabout 40 of us, maybe 35 kids. I really enjoyed that. It was very nice, I was very good in\nFrench, which I don\u2019t remember at all any more, but it was \u2014 it was really very nice, and\nthere were many girls from England, probably about 10 or 11 girls from London, and\nthere were three Americans \u2014 no, there were four Americans. And then the rest was\ndifferent. One girl was from Haifa, she was an Arab, and there were some Italians and a\ncouple of Swiss. It was interesting \u2014 and that\u2019s a sideline that I knew there was a big\nkerfuffle at the beginning, in the American room \u2014 they \u2014 they stupidly, they \u2014 there was\none other German girl, and I don\u2019t know why they would put us together in a room with \u2014\nwith a Greek girl and an Italian girl, and they put all four American girls into one room.\nAnd I knew there was a big kerfuffle, but I never understood \u2014 I mean, we just didn\u2019t\nknow. And it was only after I was in this country for a while, and looked at the pictures\nthat I realized that one of the girls was black. Very light black, but she was black. And\nI\u2019m sure that\u2019s what the kerfuffle was all about. She was from San Francisco, her name\nwas Georgia Naifi(ph). I \u2014 I got invited to her wedding, but of course it was during the\nwar, so I didn\u2019t go.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But, you know, it didn\u2019t dawn on me. I never even saw that she was black when I was\nover there. I\u2019d never seen a black girl, and she was very light, and you know, what did I\nNovember 21, 2011\nknow? I never knew she was black, but when I looked at old pictures, I suddenly thought,\nnow I know what went on there.",
        "Q: Now, I come back to the same question that I had earlier, of how you perceive\nyourself, and how other perceive you. In that school, in the school in Switzerland, were\nyou seen as a German girl, or a Jewish girl, or both, or \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014I think as a German girl.",
        "Q: And in London \u2014 or in England?",
        "A: In England, a German girl.",
        "Q: A German girl, okay.",
        "A: No question.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And in \u2014 now, in that school in Switzerland we had a couple of Jewish girls. I mean, I\nknow one of the American girls was a Jew from New York, and we had an interesting\nBritish girl, Naomi de Rothschild, whom I visited in London with a butler and a\nelevator in the \u2014 a really \u2014 now they really lived, you know. But it was \u2014 no, I \u2014 I mean, I\nwould look the par \u2014 I don\u2019t know about the other German girl. She was clearly an\nAryan. If she was a Nazi, I\u2019m not \u2014 I really can\u2019t tell, because at that point we \u2014 we don\u2019t\ntalk about that, you know.",
        "Q: So, outside of the country, what was going on politically didn\u2019t have muc \u2014 in school\nlife, didn\u2019t have an im-impact.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Inside Germany, you had felt it.",
        "A: Oh yes, no question.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: I felt it clearly.",
        "Q: Now, at home, you said your mother had read \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d that she had a nervous\nbreakdown when the Nazis came to power.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Had there been political discussions in your home about what\u2019s going on in the\ncountry?",
        "A: There were dis \u2014 political discussions, yes, and I know, you know, as I said before, we\nhad \u2014 there were maids, and they were all Catholics, and they all asked my parents how\nto vote always. And so we \u2014 we heard all these things, you know. And there were the\ndiscussions on \u2014 you know, at that point I can\u2019t remember, you know, the Nazis killed off\none of their own, I can\u2019t remember what his name was, but \u2014 and \u2014",
        "Q: The Brownshirts, you mean?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Down in Munich?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: And so, all this kind of stuff, we \u2014 we did discuss at home. I mean, we knew what was\ngoing on. There was no question.",
        "Q: And from the household staff, were there any \u2014 was there anybody who distanced\nthemselves?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: They were all very loyal.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes. No question. And the \u2014 the woman who was hired when she was, I think 24,\nwhen I was born, died in Tucson, because she came \u2014 she stayed in England at my\nmother\u2019s house all during the war \u2014",
        "Q: My.",
        "A: \u2014 and then came to a \u2014 to this country, and she died in Tucson. But \u2014 and the other\nmaids also were really very loyal. And then the maid that we had that my friend says I\u2019m\nalways quoting, she came to us during the war. In fact, I hired her. She had been a maid\nwith a Jewish family in Frankfurt who left, and she was extremely fond of them, and\nthen was very happy with us too. So we were lucky in \u2014 with these people. But anyway,\nthen after that year in \u2014",
        "Q: Switzerland.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 Switzerland, it was decided that I would go back to England and live with my\nmother and her husband, and go to school. And I went to Saint Paul\u2019s Girls\u2019 School,\nwhich was \u2014 I went there as a day student, and I mean, they also had a boarding thing, but\nI was a day student. And I graduated from that school, and I took \u2014 I can never think of it,\nif it was A levels or O levels, I can\u2019t remember. But in any case, it was a level to \u2014 that\nimmediately \u2014",
        "Q: Gets you into university.",
        "A: \u2014 it took me into the university.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I think they\u2019re A levels. I think.",
        "A: Ica\u2014I can\u2019t remember. But I still have the certificate somewhere, but anyway, that\nwas in 1939, and I went home for the summer.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And that was the end of that.",
        "Q: Oh my. So after that, you go home for the summer, and then there\u2019s August 23\",\nwhich is the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and September first with the invasion of\nPoland.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how did \u2014 do you remember where you were and ho \u2014 what you thought, what\nyou felt?\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Well, I remember exactly where I was on the first of September, because I was at the\npublic swimming pool in Frankfurt with a guy I knew, and we were lying on the grass,\nand we heard it on the radio. And I said well, I guess by the time \u2014 by this time next\nweek, we won\u2019t be lying in the grass any more, we\u2019d be bombed. Well, of course, took\nanother two years to get any air raids in Frankfurt, but I don\u2019t know, I think, in\nretrospect, I think I probably could have left in time.",
        "Q: That summer?",
        "A: Yeah. From Frankfurt to go back to London.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It was not what I had planned, I \u2014 my parents had given me a trip to America as a\ngraduation present. Now, here\u2019s the irony. We were suppo \u2014 my father and I were going\non the Bremen. We were supposed to leave August 22\u2122. My father had a important\nmeeting on the 24\", so we changed the tickets to September third.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And the Bremen \u2014",
        "Q: Of course. Didn\u2019t go.",
        "A: Was the end of that. So that\u2019s the irony. I would have been in this country. Of course,\nmy father might have been unhappy.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: But it would have been interesting. Or, I might have been able, you know, if I had\nforesight, and my parents had foresight, I mean, I don\u2019t know, I mean, I might have been\nable to get on a train and go to be \u2014 go back to London in time. But, on the other hand, I\nwas very fond of my father.",
        "Q: Was he the po \u2014 parent you were closer to?",
        "A: I think because of my mother\u2019s illness, you know. And of course, I didn\u2019t like her\nsecond husband, as you know, as I said before.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And I would have had to go back and live with them, and I \u2014 I don\u2019t know. And you\nknow, you\u2019re 19, you don\u2019t pay attention. You know, you \u2014 you live every day as it\ncomes along, and \u2014 and \u2014",
        "Q: You live in a different way.",
        "A: Yeah, you figure everything\u2019s gonna work out just fine, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and I will say, all of us thought, at home, that the war would last a year, or\nmaybe two, because Germany would be defeated.",
        "Q: Did you fi \u2014 okay, let\u2019s go back to another part of the identity. Did you feel yourself to\nbe German?",
        "A: Yes.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: And, when I came in earlier, you know, one of the things that you said before we\nstarted recording, is the irony and the sadness of hoping that your own country \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 loses. Gets occupied.",
        "A: It was sad, you know, it is sad. I was clearly, I \u2014 I was German, you know, and \u2014 and \u2014\nand just think \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a different story, but just think when this country, we lost\nVietnam, which was annoying, to put it mildly. But, you know, when it\u2019s \u2014 when you\u2019re\nin the country, and you know the only way this country can really survive, and you can\nsurvive, 1s if that country \u2014",
        "Q: Loses.",
        "A: \u2014 loses the war. I knew if the \u2014 1f we didn\u2019t lose the war, we were goners, you know,\nthere was no question in my mind. So, for very selfish reasons \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 you hoped that the country will lose the war. But it\u2019s hard when it\u2019s your own\ncountry, because I was clearly German. There wasn\u2019t any question in my mind. So it \u2014 it\nwasn\u2019t easy.",
        "Q: It\u2019s heartbreaking. It\u2019s actually quite heartbreaking.",
        "A: Yeah, it \u2014 it \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: I wanted to ask \u2014 I mean, we \u2014 one of the \u2014 as I said \u2014 bless you \u2014 one of the unusual\nparts of your experience is that you were able to hide in plain sight throughout the war.\nHave a drink, have a drink. Sure, hang on just a second. [break]",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: This is a continuation of our interview with \u2014 the United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum interview with Mrs. Judith Heimann. Okay.",
        "A: Okay, so anyway, it \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was very hard for my sister, because you know, she\nhad that baby, and she had to go back to work. And I worked \u2014 oh, I haven\u2019t told you\nabout my work.",
        "Q: No, I wanted to ask.",
        "A: I\u2014I- well, when I go back a little bit to \u00b039, because I told you we only thought the\nwar would last very short. So, my father decided that I should go to Berlin, to a\nhousehold school, you know, e-economy.",
        "Q: How to run a household.",
        "A: Yeah. Which is really stupid. So, we went to Berlin, we got a room, I got a room. We\nwent \u2014 I went to this school where there were mainly young women who were planning\nto get married very soon, you know. So I wasn\u2019t planning on that. And you know, that\nwas very interesting because you know, I was in a strange territory, nobody knew me. I\nwasn\u2019t about to say anything about my heritage, or anything else. And there was one girl\nwho at one point said to me \u2014 I was friendly with her, and she said to me, you know, I\nNovember 21, 2011\nhave to ask you a question, and I don\u2019t want you to take it the wrong way. And I said, so,\nwhat is it? He said, are you half Jewish? And I said, why are you asking this? And she\nsaid, where I come from there\u2019s a family by the name of Bartmann and they\u2019re Jewish.\nAnd I said, well that happens to be my Aryan side. And I said, yes I am. And she said, so\nam I. And, but you know, neither one of us had said anything to anybody else, and in\nfact, I was friendly with one woman who I\u2019m sure never knew, and I wasn\u2019t about to tell\nher.",
        "Q: Well, it could be dangerous.",
        "A: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, there wasn\u2019t any point. And the \u2014 this one girl who was\nhalf Jewish also, got married to a Norwegian, and we all went to the wedding. It was very\nnice, but you know, that \u2014 that was interesting, but of course, the war wasn\u2019t over, you\nknow. And so I came back, and then I ha \u2014 I don\u2019t quite remember this, but somehow I\nthink I went someplace to learn Spanish, which I have never mastered in my entire life;\nI\u2019ve taken three more Spanish classes, I just can\u2019t do \u2014 seem to do it. But anyway, and\nthen I had to go to work. And you know, the \u2014 the thing that completely disrupted my\nlife, is that I had always wanted to go to medical school, from probably the time I was 12\nor 13. And of course, in Germany I was not permitted. And in England I had been \u2014 you\nknow, I had started \u2014 I was gonna go to the University of London Medical School, but\nyou know, so that was out. And so I felt, well, maybe I could work at a doctor\u2019s office.\nAnd we knew a guy who was a radiologist, who also had some Jewish connections, and\nNovember 21, 2011\nhe said, well, P\u2019Il ask some of my colleagues, you know. So this doctor called, and said,\nwould I come and be interviewed. He had joined the Nazi party in 1933, which 1s early.",
        "Q: Very early, hm.",
        "A: He had a practice, a medical practice in the blue collar area in Frankfurt, near the\nmain railroad station. His main patients, all his patients were what here you would call\nMedicare patients, you know, on \u2014 on \u2014",
        "Q: Assistance.",
        "A: Yeah, on \u2014 in \u2014a~\u2014a lot of them were railroad workers, and \u2014 and the other were blue\ncollar workers. And he interviewed me, and he said yeah, I think it\u2019s fine, and you look\nright, you know. And then he \u2014 for some reason they have to go to the AMA \u2014 I mean,\nthe equivalent of the AMA in Germany to say they are hiring, and they told him he\ncouldn\u2019t hire a half-Jew. And he said \u2014 now, this Nazi said to them, that\u2019s fine. Then I\u2019 Il\nclose my practice. And of course they couldn\u2019t afford that, because he had all these blue\ncollar workers and those regular workers. So they said okay, hire her. And I will tell you,\nthey were the loveliest people. They had an apartment \u2014 two apartments put together, and\none was the practice, and the other was the \u2014 where they lived. He and his wife, they had\ntwo sons and a daughter. It was hard work, because we had to be there \u2014 I had to be there\nat eight o\u2019clock in the morning, and then we worked til about 1:30 or so, and then there\nwere two hours off, and then I was back at 3:30, and then we worked til eight o\u2019clock at\nnight.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: That\u2019s quite long.",
        "A: I mean, you know, they had a lot of patients, and there weren\u2019t that many doctors, and\nI did everything. I mean, he taught me everything. I did the insurance, I did the lab work.\nI mean, the guy taught me everything. He had a horrible temper, and would yell. And the\nfirst time he yelled at me, I got up and said, when you\u2019re done, I'll come back here. And\nfrom then on, when he was in a bad humor, his wife would say to me, Miss Bartmann,\nyou deal with it. And he was \u2014 he was \u2014 they were just the loveliest people. I mean, I\ncan\u2019t begin to tell you how wonderful they were. And you know, every day in \u2014 about for\n\u2014 five o\u2019clock, she would open the door and say come in, have a cup of tea, you know.\nAnd they \u2014 they were \u2014 and their kids were nice, and I mean they were ab \u2014",
        "Q: Do you think he joined the party because of a purely career move?",
        "A: I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I have no idea, I never asked him.",
        "Q: So that never came up in conversation?",
        "A: No. I never asked him, and it just \u2014 we never talked about those things. He certainly\nwas no Nazi at that point. And, you know, I think he had no idea what he was joining.\nAnd he \u2014 unfortunately, at the end of 19 \u2014 no, early in 1944 \u2014 late in 1943, or early in\nfour \u2014 in \u201944, they were bombed out. And they moved to Schlangenbad, which is not far\nfrom Frankfurt, where he opened a practice. And they asked me to come with them, but\nat that point my niece was born, and I \u2014 and my sister was working, and I felt I had to\nstay home. And also, I really didn\u2019t want to leave my father. So I said, no, I \u2014 I think I\nNovember 21, 2011\nwon\u2019t. And so he said, well, we\u2019ll see that you find another place that we know. And\nsome woman doctor first hired me, and then she was bombed out. And then this guy who\nlived not very far, like from here to where you turn to Mass Avenue, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 not terribly far. He had his practice there, and he hired me. Now, his wife was a\nquarter Jew. She in fact, had been in school with my deceased aunt, my \u2014",
        "Q: Luchs(ph)?",
        "A: \u2014 mother\u2019s youngest sister. I knew exactly who she was. He was the biggest Nazi you\never want to meet. He treated me like a piece of dirt. You know, at that point none of us\nknew the \u2014 the phrase sexual harassment, but the first week I was there, he chased me\naround the desk and kept saying, sit, come sit.",
        "Q: On his knees.",
        "A: Yeah. And I said no, you know, and that was the end of his treating me as a person. I\nmean, after that \u2014 and of course, I knew I couldn\u2019t leave, because it was a job, and if I left\nthe job, I\u2014 I risked being deported someplace.",
        "Q: So, is this the reason why \u2014 cause I was trying to figure out earlier, when you said that\nif you had household help at home, you had to go to work.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: I didn\u2019t know why you had to go to work if you had household help at home, and you\nhave money, why\u201d?\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: No, no. If you da \u2014 if you had no help, one of you could stay home to do the house.",
        "Q: That\u2019s how intrusive the party was, in other words.",
        "A: Yes. And if \u2014 but if you had help, you couldn\u2019t stay home. And being a half Jew, I\nwould have been sent someplace \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 if I didn\u2019t have a job.",
        "Q: So they would have found work for you someplace.",
        "A: Yes. What was precisely what he knew. And he knew I couldn\u2019t leave. And I had said\nto him, all is fine, I just would like when we have an air raid, I would like to ride my\nbicycle home, because my niece \u2014 our maid had the baby, and I said I would like to be\nthere with the baby during the air raid. And he said, fine. Well, he was a big shot in the\n[indecipherable] you know, and so as soon as there was an air raid siren, he put on his\nuniform and departed. And he said, take all the files in the basement. So, I \u2014 before\nanything else, I had to take the files in the basement. And there were many a day when I\nri \u2014 rode my bicycle home while the bombs were falling, because there wasn\u2019t any other\nway to do it. And it was dark, and you know, and you couldn\u2019t put a light on your\nbicycle. But I always made it home, and we \u2014 we were very lucky, we were not bombed\nout, although around us \u2014 I mean, sometimes you just don\u2019t know why y-you were there.\nI mean, we ha \u2014 we had incendiary bombs in the attic once, but we were able to \u2014",
        "Q: Get rid of them.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yeah. And \u2014 but he was really \u2014 oh, he was so awful, I mean, and he kept \u2014 he had\nwhat he said was an ulcer. So he got extra food stamps, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Rations.",
        "A: \u2014 for \u2014 yeah, for \u2014 for butter and stuff. Do you think he shared it with his wife? No. It\nwas all just in front of him. And then he had private patients, and had others, you know,\nlike Medicare. And the private patients always got treated very well. The others kept \u2014\nyou know, I always said, if they have diarrhea, they were told to take Kaopectate, and if\nthey had something other, take three aspirins and go home, you know. I mean, and \u2014 but\nthe private patients \u2014",
        "Q: Different \u2014 different class, different treatment.",
        "A: I\u2014I mean, he was just awful. And I\u2019Il tell you, the best thing in my life \u2014 not the best\nthing in my life, but a nice thing in my life, we were occupied \u2014 I mean, you know, we\nwere occupied in March. And we knew it was coming, and you know, there was dead\nsilence for two days. I mean, so silent that you could hear a pin drop everywhere. I mean,\nthere was nothing. And I had gone to work, and he said to me, go to the police\ndepartment and get an armband, a Red Cross armband for me, or something \u2014 which was\non the other side of the river. So I got on my bicycle, and went to the other side of the\nriver, and got to the police department, where people knew me through my brother-in-\nlaw. And they said, what are you doing here? And I said, I need to get the \u2014 well, they\nsaid, you better get home they be \u2014 they\u2019re blowing up the bridges. And so I te \u2014 I\nNovember 21, 2011\nsnatched that thing, and went home, went to his place and threw it there and went home.\nNever went back to his practice. And the house next door to us \u2014 we lived on a cul-de-sac\n\u2014 and the house next door to us had been empty and was immediately occupied by\nAmerican soldiers. I don\u2019t know how they knew it was empty, but there were American\nsoldiers in there right away. And my sister and I were outside, and you know, we both\nspoke English, of course. And we were chatting with some of these kids. And this Jeep\ncomes, and they have my doctor in that Jeep. So he says to me, he fe \u2014 he spoke no\nEnglish. He said to me, you speak English and German? I said yes. And he said, just tell\nthem that I\u2019m a very nice guy, and I, you know, mean no harm. So I just said to them, I\ndon\u2019t know who he is. And they took him. I mean, they let him go right away after 24\nhours \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 but, you know, he was wearing his stupid uniform, you know. But I just decided I\u2019m\nnot going to say he\u2019s a nice guy, just that I don\u2019t really know who he 1s.",
        "Q: Do you think he figured it out?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t care. You know, after I worked for the military government right away.\nAnd his wife came to see me, maybe after a month or two, and asked me for what \u2014\nwhat\u2019s called \u2014 you may know or not know that expression, Persilschein.",
        "Q: Persilschein? Persilschein [German]",
        "A: Persil is a detergent.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: Ah, Persil, yeah, of course.",
        "A: Persilschein is a piece of paper saying you were okay. And it was called Persilschein.\nSo she asked me for one, for him, and I \u2014 I refused. I said, I really can\u2019t give it to you. I\nonly met him after \u2014 when it was so clear the war was over, or was going to be lost, that\nwhoever would have been a Nazi. I said, I can\u2019t give you anything. And I didn\u2019t give him\nany. And her \u2014 both her so \u2014 both their sons died in the war, and when the war was lost,\nshe said to me, the world is coming to an end for my girls \u2014 they had two girls. And I\nsaid, well, that\u2019s your problem. It didn\u2019t have to be that way.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But oh, they \u2014 you know, for \u2014 for \u2014 for a while when we lived in Tucson, I wouldn\u2019t\ngo into one supermarket because the guy there looked like \u2014 like this guy. My husband\nkept saying, but you know it\u2019s not him. But he was really awful. And you see, this is the\nkind of thing you run into. And of course, there were a lot of people who didn\u2019t know you\nany more.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, who used to be your friend, and \u2014",
        "Q: And then not.",
        "A: \u2014 just didn\u2019t know you. And believe me, I didn\u2019t know them after the war, either. I\nmean, I\u2019m not that forgiving. And we did have some very good friends, who would\nalways come and no matter what, and they would come and \u2014 and visit, and come for\nNovember 21, 2011\ndinner, or coffee, or whatever. And there were several \u2014 but I know that for some of\nthem, it was risky.",
        "Q: Here\u2019s a question. You mentioned earlier that \u2014 you know, when we were talking\nabout your own country being the one that you want to lose because \u2014 for a variety of\nreasons \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 but one of them is that you\u2019re a goner if they don\u2019t.",
        "A: Ri-Right.",
        "Q: Okay. Did you feel physical \u2014 I mean, we\u2019re talking about things that are highly\nunpleasant, but did you feel physical danger that you could be eliminated\u2019? Did you feel\nthat kind of fear?",
        "A: We felt fear at times that we would be deported someplace. Not always. You know, it\nwould go in waves. There were times when it was very quiet and you felt pretty good.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And then other times \u2014",
        "A: And then \u2014 and then all of a sudden you\u2019d feel they were looking again, and they were\nplanning to do, and it was un \u2014 it was \u2014 now, I will also add that I was young, and when\nyou\u2019re young, you live with this, but you also have boys on your mind.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: And \u2014 and you know, and you have a life, so to speak. So, there are distractions. It was\nmuch harder on my father, of course. Of course, for him was the second war already, you\nNovember 21, 2011\nknow, he\u2019d been \u2014 he was wounded in the first one, so \u2014 which 1s already dreadful, you\nknow.",
        "Q: But you see, here \u2014 here\u2019s a \u2014 here\u2019s something that sounds like it\u2019s a difference being\nhalf Jewish and full Jewish.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely.",
        "Q: That, if you are full Jewish, you \u2014",
        "A: Well, I couldn\u2019t have stayed.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean, that would have been impo \u2014 now, I\u2019Il tell you about my girlfriend, because it\nfalls into the \u2014 now she, who is still alive in Frankfurt [indecipherable] at 91. She\u2019s a\nfull Aryan.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But her own mother died when she was five, and her father married a Jew, a fi \u2014 girl\nfrom Frankfurt who was a Jew, who my girlfriend always regarded as her mother,\nbecause she was only six when my \u2014 when her father married this woman. So, for all\npractical purposes, that woman was her mother. However, for the Nazis, it made a big\ndifference, because she had no Jewish blood.",
        "Q: Right.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: They lived in an apartment, in a very nice apartment, and they had to leave that\napartment. And they were billeted, so to speak, with another Jewish family in a house,\nwho were awful to them. However, my friend, who was a full Aryan, didn\u2019t have to live\nthere, so she got herself an apartment across the street from where her parents were\nbilleted, and her parents mainly slept over there, and spent the rest of the day \u2014",
        "Q: At the \u2014 her dau \u2014 their daughter\u2019s apartment.",
        "A: At-\u2014 at their daughter\u2019s apartment. However, the women then had \u2014 was taken to work\nin a factory in Frankfurt. She tried to commit suicide, which didn\u2019t succeed, and then\nshe was deported to Theresienstadt, which of course happened \u2014 would have happened\nto us if we\u2019d been full Jewish. And it would have happened to us if the war had lasted a\nlittle longer. But, she was surprised. She came back, and lived to be 91. But it was not a\npleasant experience, you know.",
        "Q: Of course not.",
        "A: I mean, she was in Theresienstadt a year and a half.",
        "Q: That\u2019s long enough.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s long enough.",
        "A: And of course, the transport itself was so horrible. But she was a tough bird, and she\nalways did exercises she told me, even in Theresienstadt, she did her exercises. And she\ncame back.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: So, in other words, you knew, even though you didn\u2019t have this face of di \u2014 I\u2019m trying\nto get a sense of the degree of knowledge of what was really going on, because it sounds\nlike there was no knowledge about the camps, there was no knowledge about \u2014 but there\nwas knowledge that there was \u2014 so this is why \u2014",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth.",
        "A: \u2014 oh no, I mean, I think we knew all about concentration camps.",
        "Q: Okay, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get a sense.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That \u2014 early on, probably in \u201935, the father of a guy \u2014 well, this were the family in\nFrankfurt, he was taken \u2014 actually, he was not a Jew, but it was sort of a Jewish family.\nAnd he wa \u2014 he was a director of a very big outfit, and I don\u2019t know why they took him.\nThey took him, and they put him in a concentration camp, and after a half a year, they\nwrote his wife and said she could have the urn. So, we knew. Anybody who tells you they\ndidn\u2019t know that there were concentration camps, and what went on, I think is lying.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I\u2014 everybody knew. We knew full well what was going on. And \u2014 and you know, and\nthat is something that was always in the back of your mind. You know, it \u2014 it\u2019s a stupid\nthing to say, but in some ways the air raids, and the disruption of everything, is what\nNovember 21, 2011\nsaved us, because there was lit \u2014 the communications weren\u2019t any good any more, and\nyou know, things weren\u2019t going \u2014 if the war had gone better, we would have been a goner\nlong ago. So \u2014",
        "Q: Do you think your father had to bribe people?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did the thought ever cross your mind?",
        "A: Yes, I \u2014 the thought has crossed my mind many times, but I \u2014 I just don\u2019t know. He\nnever said so. But he also, even, you know, we always said we are very unfortunate,\nbecause people were trading stuff, you know; you have eggs, you have this, but we only\nhave money, because we are the bank. And nobody wanted money.",
        "Q: But they wanted eggs.",
        "A: Yeah, nobody wanted money. But he \u2014 he also had a way with people, you know, that\nhe could remind them of earlier times and all that, which I think, all of which helped. I\nthink the fact that he was a very good person who was an old, old family in Frankfurt, I\nthink helped to some extent. But of course, it wouldn\u2019t have helped in the end. I mean,\nyou know, in the end, nothing helps.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and \u2014 and everybody knew what was going on, and I don\u2019t know, you\u2019re not a\nCatholic, are you? You \u2014",
        "Q: Not a good one, but I am, yes.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m sorry to say, I think your cur-current pope is lying, because you current\npope claims he was forced to join the Hitler youth, and I have never heard of anybody\nwho was forced to do that. I mean, maybe there was peer pressure.",
        "Q: That\u2019s different.",
        "A: That I don\u2019t believe.",
        "Q: That\u2019s different.",
        "A: But that\u2019s not forced. The guy is a liar. But, you know, that\u2019s the way that goes.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s one of the reasons I wanted to hear it from you, so that \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 you know, that ye \u2014 it\u2019s hard to know \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s that old question of, what did they\nknow, and when did they know it?",
        "A: Yeah, that is always the question. I'll tell you, in \u2014 I was talking earlier about my\npublic school, and the fact that there were about six or seven of us who were not \u2014 who\nhad to appear on Saturdays. Well, of course, there were only three of us who had some\nJewish connection. The other five or so had chosen not to join the BDM. So \u2014",
        "Q: The BDM is the ger \u2014 association for young German women.",
        "A: Bund Deutscher Machen(ph).",
        "Q: Bund de Deutschen(ph) Machen(ph)?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. The association of young German girls.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: It\u2019s the same as the Hitler youth for boys.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and they had chosen not to join, so obviously you didn\u2019t have to join. But, you\nknow, I\u2019m sure there was peer pressure.",
        "Q: But it\u2019s a different word than using forced.",
        "A: But forcing was not true.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But abso \u2014 I get mad every time I read this. But, you know \u2014",
        "Q: I can understand that.",
        "A: He was probably a Nazi, and why not, you know? He was from Bavaria, where they\nwere all Nazis anyway.",
        "Q: Well, tell me this: when the war ended, and you got news of what happened to all the\nJews \u2014 I mean, how did you find out about the scope of the Holocaust? Were you still in\nFrankfurt? How soon was it?",
        "A: Well, the scope, of course we found out, I\u2019m sure, when we started getting American\nnews, and stuff like \u2014 you know, I worked for the military government, so already I knew\na lot of stuff. But, you know, we knew there was Auschwitz, we knew that \u2014 I mean, I\nknew my girlfriend and her mother, I knew she\u2019d gone to Theresienstadt, you know, so\nthere wasn\u2019t any secret about this. And I knew people who had been deported to\nAuschwitz. So, you know, I can understand, perhaps, that there were people who had no\nNovember 21, 2011\nconnection with Jews, that they didn\u2019t know. You know, they maybe knew there was\nsomething going on, you know, but they weren\u2019t really sure. But, you know, I know \u2014\nmust have been 1934 \u2014 I was just telling the kids about this \u2014 my \u2014 it was an Easter\nvacation. We took a \u2014 a trip to Unterfranken, you know, where Nuremberg is, and\nplace like that. And the first place we started \u2014 we went to, there was a sign about this wi\n\u2014 big at the entrance to the town. Juden sind hier unavinst(ph).",
        "Q: Jews are not wanted here.",
        "A: Yeah, and my mother was in the car, and so we turned around, and we did not go to\nUnterfranken, we went someplace else, we went to the Lake Constance instead, which\nwas not in Bavaria. So, you know, people just \u2014 just knew. But you know, there was\nalways anti-Semitism, and there always will be anti-Semitism, there\u2019s no question in my\nmind. I me \u2014",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Why?",
        "Q: Why. Why do you thi \u2014 why, in three parts. Why do you think it always was? Why do\nyou think it always will be, and why is it not a question in your mind?",
        "A: Well, Jews have always been persecuted. I think part of it 1s that many of them are\nvery successful, which people never like. And \u2014 you know, and they have tended to be \u2014\nwell, they were moneychangers because that was the only pir \u2014 trade they were allowed\nto be. And so they have their hand in the till. And people didn\u2019t like that. You know, all\nNovember 21, 2011\nyou need to do is read Shakespeare, and they were always wandering everywhere. I\nmean, you look at the entire history of Jews, they were enslaved, and they were evicted.\nThe \u2014 and they were in Germany for a while treated very well, then they became not\ntreated well, they were all put in the ghetto, then that went. So th \u2014 and this went o \u2014 there\nwill always be people who \u2014 who are anti-Semitic, and there are today. And you know, I\nknow, when I was living with my mother in England, I had this \u2014 I knew all these girls\nfrom the friend \u2014 from the school in Switzerland. And this one girl asked me frequently\nto \u2014 for a weekend to her house. And she said, we\u2019ll go and play Bridge with these old\nladies. So, we went. And of course, nobody knew who I was. And this one lady said,\nwell, you know, we\u2019re taking in so many Jews. I don\u2019t really like them. I didn\u2019t say\nanything. I mean, what can you say? But you know, that\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and that is true in the entire world, and \u2014 and it will always be that way. And\nyou know, and it \u2014 first of all, people always have to have somebody they can hate. You\nknow, if it\u2019s not the Jews here, it was the blacks for a long time. That\u2019s gotten a little\nbetter, but anythi \u2014 I mean, you know \u2014 fortunately the Holocaust Museum has made no\nbones about the fact that America was not very good during the war, and didn\u2019t take in\ntoo many Jews, and all of that, you know. I \u2014 I was very pleased to see that; it \u2014 it\u2019s a\ngood exhibit. I\u2019ve been through twice. But it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019Il always be that way. But you know, I\nguess it\u2019s the fate of Jews, I don\u2019t know. But \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: It\u2019s kind of sad. I mean wa \u2014",
        "A: You know, when I got my \u2014 when I married \u2014 when I wa \u2014 started going with my\nhusband and I married him, our maid, who I told you about, so fond of the family, she\nsaid to me, don\u2019t marry a Jew. And I said why not? And she said, always means trouble.",
        "Q: Oh. And I\u2019m sure she meant it for \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, I me \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 out of protection, a sense of protection \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I mean, she had nothing against them in general, she just felt,\ndon\u2019t buy trouble.",
        "Q: Yeah. I want to turn this around in a certain way, because you have a relationship still\nwith Germany that many don\u2019t. I mean, I \u2014 it starts from when Steve and I, let\u2019s say, we\nmet in Bosch, he had very close relations with \u2014 with \u2014 I mean, his wife 1s German.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you still go back. And so many people who experienced any part of the\nHolocaust said never again. I do not want to see this country again. I do not want to know\nit.",
        "A: I wa\u2014 no, I\u2019m not one who beared the grudge easily. As I said to you, my nieces and\nmy nephew live over there. I still have friends over there. And, you know, it\u2019s the country\nwhere I was born, and where I\u2019m from. And you know, it was a horrible time, but it\u2019s\ngone. And I\u2014I would not put it past any country to experience things like that. I mean,\nNovember 21, 2011\nyou know, fortunately, this country is so big, that it\u2019s almost impossible to have anything\nlike that happen. But think about Huey Long and Louisiana, which wasn\u2019t a sterling\nexperience. And you know, think about Selma, Alabama. There are many things in this\ncountry that happened, and it can ha \u2014 I mean, it goo \u2014 okay, it didn\u2019t happen with the\nJews, but it certainly happened with the blacks. And now there is much resentment\nagainst Latinos.",
        "Q: Yes, there is.",
        "A: So, you know, I am not putting it past any country. I mean, th \u2014 it was a little extreme\nin Germany, and you know, you don\u2019t \u2014 I mean Hitler was just a wa \u2014 was a \u2014 you came\n\u2014 you know, every day, if you want to, you can watch on TV, they always have stuff\nabout this, which I don\u2019t watch. But you know, basically, it\u2019s where I\u2019m from, and I don\u2019t\nsee any reason to give that up. I mean, you can look around here.",
        "Q: Yeah, there\u2019s Frankfurt. There\u2019s Frankfurt.",
        "A: You know, it \u2014 there\u2019s Frankfurt, everywhere is Frankfurt. And you know, it\u2019s my\nhometown. So, you know, it was a horrible 12 - 13 years, but it\u2019s gone. And you know,\nokay, my family is \u2014 is scattered, and my life is different, and I did not get to study\nmedicine, which is what I really wanted. I did get a degree in bacteriology from the\nUniversity of Arizona. But here I\u2019ve dealt in so \u2014 planning and so on, and \u2014 so, you\nknow, your life takes a different \u2014",
        "Q: Turn.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 route, at times, and I don\u2019t regret any of it. I mean, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get to be an\nM.D., that\u2019s what I would have liked, but you know, it\u2019s gone.",
        "Q: Your \u2014 I think we\u2019re coming close to the end. I just wanted to take a few last words\nand ask you about your husband. He was a Holocaust survivor as well, wasn\u2019t he?",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you; that\u2019s what my nephew claims. My husband was very into the \u2014 I\nwish you could have interviewed him, but he\u2019s been dead 40 years, so it\u2019s a long time.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He came to this country at the very last minute.",
        "Q: That would mean which year?",
        "A: August 7\u00b039.",
        "Q: That is the last minute.",
        "A: Yes. I think he was on that Bremen that I didn\u2019t get onto. Now, he \u2014 it ba \u2014 it\u2019s very\ninteresting, his mother died when he was 11. His father was a lawyer in a small town, in\nFlaybish(ph) gemund(ph), and I think his father was incapable of having this \u2014 of doing\nanything with the family, you know, he \u2014 he had these two boys, my husband and his\nolder brother, who was, I think, five years older. And, so when my husband was, I think \u2014\nfirst of all, his father and his mother were in a concentration camp for a week. You know,\nwas one of the \u2014 maybe Kristallnacht, I\u2019m not sure when \u2014 my husband happened to be\nin the hospital having his tonsils out at that point, which is why he was taken. But, in any\ncase, they sent him to Gross-Rosen, which is in Schlesien, where they had a farm for\nNovember 21, 2011\nkids who wanted to emigrate. It was specifically geared to that. And all the kids who\nwent there, did emigrate. Now, my husband was clearly one of the youngest, because in\n1939, he was only 18, and \u2014 and he \u2014 and they sent him there, I think, when he was 16, or\nsomething like that. So he learned this farming, which is not what he really liked, but it\nwas the only way to get here. And then he did get a visa. Now, there was a \u2014 and I don\u2019t\nknow how much you know about this: there was a family in Richmond, the\nTarnheimers(ph), which had a big department store. And they had a farm near\nRichmond, which was called Hyde(ph) Farmland, which they established precisely for\nthese kids. And that\u2019s where my husband \u2014",
        "Q: Went?",
        "A: \u2014 got a visa for.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So he came \u2014 his brother was already in New York, but he came at the very last\nminute, in 1939, and went to that farm, Hyde(ph) Farmland, which, unfortunately was\nrun only by those kids, who didn\u2019t really know much about farming, and it went \u2014 well,\nabout eight months after my husband got there. And at that point, of course, there were\nall these kids, you know.",
        "Q: What do you do with them?",
        "A: Well, the Quakers in Philadelphia came through, and my husband went to\nPhiladelphia and was housed with some Quaker family, I don\u2019t know who they were, on\nNovember 21, 2011\nthe Main Line. And he drove a milk truck. As he always told me, the tips he got, he used\nto buy a radio. And so he drove a milk truck for a while, a year or so, and then he got a\njob with a woman called Mrs. Summerall(ph), who had a nursery in Media,\nPennsylvania. And he also \u2014 she had a room where he could sleep. And she really loved\nhim. And she said \u2014 she said to me later too, I always said to him, if your hands were as\ngood as your mind, then you would make a good [indecipherable] but your hands are not\nas good \u2014",
        "Q: As your mind.",
        "A: Right. And he \u2014",
        "Q: What a sweet way of putting it.",
        "A: And \u2014 but she kept him, and even though he wasn\u2019t really very good. I mean, it was\njust not him to \u2014 to be working the earth. But he saved enough money to go to Penn\nState, of ill repute. Well, my \u2014 Steven\u2019s son just graduated from Penn State last year.",
        "Q: Let me make a point at this point of the interview, we\u2019re talking about a current news\nitem, in November 2011, about a scandal at Penn State, dealing with the football team.\nBy the time somebody would hear this in the future, that scandal will be long gone.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: All right. So \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: So anyway, he saved enough money to go to Penn State, and he had thought he had\nsaved enough money for four years, but he didn\u2019t realize that as a non-citizen, he had to\npay out-of-state tuition. So the money lasted for a year.",
        "Q: Oh, the poor man.",
        "A: And, of course, it was a working \u2014 stuff. I mean, he worked in the, I don\u2019t know,\ncafeteria or something. But fortunately, by now it was the end \u2014 early \u201942, and he got\ndrafted. And one thing I have never understood in this country lately, is when he was\ndrafted, they naturalized him. They naturalized all the boys right away. Now how we can\nhave all these kids now in the military who are not citizens?",
        "Q: It\u2019s very strange, yeah.",
        "A: I just don\u2019t understand.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I mean, I just don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t naturalize those kids, who are good\nenough to serve in the military.",
        "Q: And die for the country.",
        "A: Yeah, so I don\u2019t \u2014 I \u2014 that I don\u2019t understand, because I know that my husband was\nnaturalized, I \u2014 I can\u2019t remember what the \u2014 it was in New Jersey in some fort, whatever\nthe name of it is. So anyway, he was \u2014 he was naturalized, and then they sent him to\nChampagne, to learn more German. But he \u2014 he was assigned to some infantry and then\nto the military government, was all, you know. Anyway, it wasn\u2019t the Battle of the Bulge.\nNovember 21, 2011\nBut I think \u2014 you know, it was very interesting that he was able to have this experience in\nGross-Rosen, which he hated, but you know, nevertheless, it gave him the chance to\ncome here.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I was told that somebody had made an exhibit of this Gross-Rosen \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: \u2014 experience, which was exhibited at Rutgers University, and I always thought the\nHolocaust Museum should get it.",
        "Q: Wa \u2014 wa \u2014 I will ask about it, you know, I will ask, because I \u2014",
        "A: My \u2014 my daughter Marli(ph) knows who the guy is.",
        "Q: Ah, I see.",
        "A: Because whe-when the \u2014 my nephew in New York, my brother-in-law\u2019s son, he saw\nthe exhibit at Rutgers.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And he wrote us, or called us and said, you know, I saw a picture of my husband in\nGross-Rosen. I have those pictures. And \u2014 and then my daughter got in touch with the\nguy who \u2014 who has that \u2014 put that exhibit together, and then it was somewhere in New\nJersey, more towards the coast, I don\u2019t know where. And we were gonna go and see it,\nand then there was snow and we couldn\u2019t go and see it, but in any case, I don\u2019t know\nwhere it is now. But, you know, it\u2019s an interesting thing, because that was established \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "Q: Well it \u2014 yes, very little known.",
        "A: \u2014 and a lot of the kids, I think, went to South America from there.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But quite a few came here.",
        "Q: And he went back to Germany then as part of the U.S. military?",
        "A: Yes. He \u2014 he was sent to \u2014 I don\u2019t know, hi \u2014 first to England, I think, and then he\ncame over, he was \u2014 he was in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge, but, you know, he\nwas not fighting, he \u2014 he was just there, and \u2014 and he said it was very unpleasant. I\u2019m\nsure it was. And then he \u2014 then he wa \u2014 actually, I met him when he was discharged,\nbecause, you know, a lot of G.I_s took a discharge in Europe and then took a contract\nwith what was then called the war department. And he had a contract with the war\ndepartment to work at the military government in denazification, and I happened to be in\nthat department.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s how you met?",
        "A: And he took my desk, and I didn\u2019t like it. But, you know, that\u2019s an old story.",
        "Q: So \u2014",
        "A: That \u2014 that \u2014 that\u2019s all we needed, this guy here.",
        "Q: Right. So your children at least know how their parents met \u2014",
        "A: Yes, they do.",
        "Q: \u2014 even if you don\u2019t know how your parents met.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yeah, they do \u2014 they do know. We met at the military government.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s such a \u2014",
        "Q: All right. Is there anything that you think we haven\u2019t talked about?",
        "A: I think \u2014",
        "Q: Is there anything that you\u2019d want to add about let\u2019s say, the new da \u2014 denazification\ndepartment? Or do you think we pretty much covered it? Your dog is impatient, she\nwants some attention.",
        "A: Well, it was interesting to work at the military government, you know. I\u2019ve worked\nfirst [indecipherable] I worked first in a different department. When we were first hired\n\u2014I mean, was right away. I mean, as I told you, my father \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, was asked.",
        "A: \u2014 was there, and I said, let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t \u2014 if I can\u2019t get there, because I wasn\u2019t\ngoing back to that doctor.",
        "Q: The one you don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Right. And so he said yes, yes, yes, they said come and see, and so I was hired right\naway, and with another girl whom I didn\u2019t know, but whom I met. And then, just as the\nwar ended, they fired us all, because they got Belgian girls, who were, of course, allies,\nand so all German girls were fired, and four weeks later they go and hired us back,\nbecause the Belgian girls, they didn\u2019t work out. So, you know, I was home for four weeks\nNovember 21, 2011\nand then they \u2014 they called and said, would I come back, you know. So I went back, and I\nworked first in supply, which was very interesting because the sergeant in supply, his\nname was Valna(ph) Hirschman(ph), and he was from Frankfurt, which he didn\u2019t\nreally want to tell y \u2014 tell you. But he was \u2014 he was a nice guy, I mean, and we \u2014 we\nworked mostly in the warehouse, where they had, you know, staples of supplies, like food\nand stuff, and rats, too. But he was very nice, because every Friday, he gave us a\npackage, a care package to take home. And believe me, the time right after the war was\nthe most difficult one, as far as food and \u2014 and heating goes. I mean, there wasn\u2019t any\nfood, and there was no coal to heat. So it was \u2014 fortunately [indecipherable] the military\ngovernment, and met somebody who had coal, so we were able to get some coal, but it \u2014\nthe food was really very, very short, and I got lunch every day at the military\ngovernment. They had a canteen and they fed all of us. Lot of creamed corn, and \u2014 but\nthat\u2019s okay, I mean \u2014 and Spam. But, you know, when you\u2019re hungry, you\u2019re happy to\neat anything.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: So I worked there in supply for quite a long time and \u2014 and I also went with this one\nsergeant; he had to inspect all the boats on the Main river. So we went \u2014 I \u2014 I always\nremember, we had a very nice trip, he was a nice guy, I really enjoyed him. And once we\nwent someplace to inspect the boat, and we came to a military sentry or something, and\nNovember 21, 2011\nhe said, she\u2019s my interpreter. And they said, and if they were Jesus Christ you couldn\u2019t\nget \u2014 you couldn\u2019t take her in. It was some secret stuff, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 so we had to go someplace else. And then, after that I was transferred to the\ndenazification.",
        "Q: I see, okay.",
        "A: At \u2014 the same thing \u2014 in the same building, but 1t was different department. And I\nworked for a Captain Morrison, who gave me a very good reference, that I was very\ngood in shor \u2014 good in shorthand, and I never ha \u2014 knew shorthand, but that\u2019s all right, I\nhad a good memory.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then Morrison left and my husband came.",
        "Q: And what was your job there?",
        "A: It was mainly translation.",
        "Q: And translation of interviews, or translation of documents, or \u2014",
        "A: Translation of documents, and \u2014 no, not interviews, I didn\u2019t do any interviews. It was\nmainly documents and \u2014 and writing letters, and you know, secretarial stuff type \u2014 thing.\nSo, it was \u2014 I can\u2019t remember why I didn\u2019t apply, but \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s a good place to be.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: It was a very good place to be. It was a very good pla \u2014 and I met \u2014 met a lot of G.Ls,\nand I had a very good time, is all I can say. But, you know, it was enjoyable. And it was\nlike we \u2014 it was the first time I heard a lot of amer \u2014 new American music, which I didn\u2019t\nknow, you know, never heard of Glenn Miller before, but then all of a sudden, all that\ncame back. That was nice.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I left in \u00b047.",
        "Q: Were you e \u2014 married?",
        "A: I came here in \u00b047.",
        "Q: Were you married then?",
        "A: No. I came here in \u201947 on a visa. My mother gave me the affidavit, of course.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I came here ostensibly to go live with my mother, but I knew I was getting\nmarried, so \u2014 my husband was \u2014 his contract was \u2014 I came the first of May, and his\ncontract wasn\u2019t up til July. So he came later, and I'll tell you, I \u2014 I left Frankfurt on the\nfirst of May and flew directly to two \u2014 I mean, I spent one night in New York, and then\nwent on to Tucson in a fur coat, and it was a hundred and five.",
        "Q: Oh my, oh my, oh my.",
        "A: And I \u2014 and I didn\u2019t think I was gonna live through that summer.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: But I si\u2014 we stayed there seven years.",
        "Q: You get used to places, no matter how different.",
        "A: Actually I \u2014I really loved Arizona.",
        "Q: Did you? Yeah.",
        "A: And then we lived in California for six years, and I would never go back to\nCalifornia. But I loved \u2014 I really liked Arizona. It grows on you, you know, and so I\nreally enjoyed it. But you know, I \u2014 we stayed there because he went to law school there,\nSO \u2014",

And you can say that okay, how\nmuch of the actual Holocaust does someone experience in Antigua, but their lives were\naffected by these policies.",

        "Q: And did your family relations say \u2014 stay intact, with these kinds of changes?",
        "Q: Which 1s also quite an achievement, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, if I can back up to understand this better, it meant that during the time right when\nthe Nazis come to power in 1933, your grandfather has these family connections, where\nthey have some foresight as to they see where things are going, and they transfer the\nownership \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 or they bought them, or whatever, to the other branch of the family that was, by\nnow, British.",

        "Q: \u2014 the government couldn\u2019t go after it.",
        "Q: Was the \u2014 can I ask also, the bank that your grandparents had, was it a very large bank\nwithin Frankfurt?",
        "Q: By private, does that mean it wasn\u2019t a consumer bank, it was a corporate bank, 1t was\nq\u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And they have branches?",
        "Q: One. One building.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, okay.",
        "Q: Did it conta \u2014 and when your father was invited to come into the family bank \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 as it were, did he then become the director of the bank?",
        "Q: Because he was Aryan?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "Q: I thought he was Jewish, the aunt \u2014",
        "Q: Nora.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, 1t was \u2014 1t wa \u2014 okay.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So pretty mu \u2014 so in other words another significant, what I would say fact, is that\nthey family business did not get destroyed during the war, it remained throughout the war\nto the end. Is that correct?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: But as a business.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t know why, and \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and it had just been occupied.",
        "Q: Of course. Well, this is \u2014 it\u2019s an interesting part of the story, but we have jumped over\na bridge.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to the 30s, and let\u2019s see if I can ask one last question about your\ngrandparents. Grandma\u2019s taller than Grandpa. His \u2014 his nickname is Bubish(ph) \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 Bubish(ph). And did you enjoy being around them?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s more formality.",
        "Q: Of course, of course.",
        "Q: After the war?",
        "Q: When?",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: On the other hand it\u2019s a very good idea.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So a\u2014 yes, it\u2019s \u2014 Switzerland was safe, but still, Los Angeles was a bit safer.",
        "Q: In Switzerland, yeah.",
        "Q: What is it that I wanted to ask you now? Ah, at the very beginning you mentioned that\nthere were many mixed marriages in Frankfurt \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 when your parents got married. Tell me a little bit about identity, if one can. Was\nyour family, your mother\u2019s side of the family very Jewish?",
        "Q: And how does one define not being very Jewish?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: In the house.",
        "Q: So the fact that your parents came from different \u2014 now, was your father\u2019s family\nLutheran, or Catholic?",
        "Q: Oh, German Reformed, okay, so Protestant.",
        "Q: No, it has nothing to do with Catholic.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Ah, okay.",
        "Q: Oh, the poor thing. No double presents.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting to know that.",
        "Q: You know, it\u2019s interesting, because I had interviews with people at other parts of\nEurope \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 where there was a mixed marriage, and it was highly unusual, highly unusual. Be \u2014\nit was different societies, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you see yourself as Christian? Did you have any feeling of being Christian?",
        "Q: And try and figure out the identity, yeah.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about your daughter\u2019s children?",
        "Q: Yeah. And it also is a reality that somehow or other, you know, gets pushed into anar\n\u2014 you know, political forces. Because now I want to bring back to how somebody defines\nthemself, 1s from the inside, and how you are defined by others from the outside.",
        "Q: So what I would like to talk about 1s \u2014 we didn\u2019t mention this yet \u2014 your school years,\nwhen you went to public school. Not only di \u2014 yeah, so not only did kids see you as the\nrich girl \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. So let\u2019s talk about that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a very crucial time.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",

        "Q: You\u2019re leaning on the table like a pudding. [speaks German]",
        "Q: That\u2019s very cruel to a 13 year old.",

        "Q: Oh. It\u2019s like prison.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, I come back to the same question that I had earlier, of how you perceive\nyourself, and how other perceive you. In that school, in the school in Switzerland, were\nyou seen as a German girl, or a Jewish girl, or both, or \u2014",
        "Q: And in London \u2014 or in England?",
        "Q: A German girl, okay.",

        "Q: Inside Germany, you had felt it.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",

        "Q: Had there been political discussions in your home about what\u2019s going on in the\ncountry?",

        "Q: And, when I came in earlier, you know, one of the things that you said before we\nstarted recording, is the irony and the sadness of hoping that your own country \u2014",

        "Q: I didn\u2019t know why you had to go to work if you had household help at home, and you\nhave money, why\u201d?",
        "Q: That\u2019s how intrusive the party was, in other words.",
        "Q: I see.",

        "Q: Get rid of them.",

        "Q: \u2014 but one of them is that you\u2019re a goner if they don\u2019t.",

        "Answer: It\u2019s a pleasure.",
        "A: Okay. Well, I was born on August 23\", 1920, which my grandson says I was always\nold. As far as he\u2019s concerned, I was always old. And I was born in Frankfurt; both my\nparents were from Frankfurt. My mother was Jewish, my father was not. My father\ncomes from an old farming family.",
        "A: Peter Bartmann.",
        "A: Yes. B-a-r-t-m-a-double n.",
        "A: And all his ancestors were dairy farmers, including my grandparents, whom I did not\nknow; I did not know his parents. My mother, on the other hand, came from a banking\nfamily, and her maiden name was Hahn, h-a-h-n. And my great-grandfather, I think it\nwas, [indecipherable] is hanging there on the wall, established a banking house. Of\nNovember 21, 2011\ncourse, like all Jews, they originally lived in the ghetto in Frankfurt, and they were\nmoneychangers, I guess. That\u2019s, you know, how most of them started. And then, I think\nmy grandfather\u2019s grandfather \u2014 that\u2019s my grandfather, and that\u2019s my great-grandfather.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And on my mother\u2019s side. And he started a bank, which was called L.A. Hahn. And\nall their initials were L.A. And it later became a public \u2014 publicly traded bank which was\ncalled Deutsche Effecten-und Wechselbank.",
        "A: Yeah. And, in fact, the house is still standing and it\u2019s a historic \u2014 has a historic\ndesignation of the bank, but \u2014",
        "A: Yes, the bank\u2019s building. It\u2019s really just the outside, because the rest was destroyed\nduring the war, but the outside is still standing. So anyway, they had a bank. And of\ncourse you may know that in Frankfurt there were lots of mixed marriages.",
        "A: I really just don\u2019t know, but \u2014 but my father was \u2014 my grandparents ha \u2014 on my\nfather\u2019s side had three boys, and my father was the youngest. Clearly the apple of my\nNovember 21, 2011\ngrandmother\u2019s eye. And he is the only one who went to university, and he had a law \u2014 he\ngot a law degree. And I think he was very society minded. And he \u2014 I \u2014 \u2019Il show you\nlater upstairs, I have a\u2014 an old program from something at the [indecipherable] opera,\nwhere he danced with some lady. And I have a feeling that that\u2019s how they met, because\nhe was really very interested in getting up there somehow. He was also a champion tennis\nplayer. He was German master in 1910, which was a different tennis game from what it is\nnow, but nevertheless.",
        "A: Yes, yeah, I \u2014 I have all the trophies upstairs. And he also played the piano very well,\nand he used to accompany singers or play in small trios. So I\u2019m \u2014 I am sure that\u2019s how\nthey met somehow, in \u2014 in a dance, or whatever.",
        "A: My fa \u2014",
        "A: My father should have been a diplomat. He was one of the most tactful people I\u2019ve\never known, and really was charming. I mean, everybody just loved him. And he \u2014 he just\n\u2014 he ended up being a banker, because he finally took over my grandparents bank. But he\n\u2014 he should have been a diplomat. He \u2014 he was not very strict, but you know, I\u2014I grew\nup at a time that my parents weren\u2019t home that much, and I had a \u2014 a wonderful \u2014 I don\u2019t\nNovember 21, 2011\nknow, now you call it nanny, I guess, but 1t wa \u2014 she was just a young woman whom they\nhired, and who took care of the kids, and did other stuff, too. And she 1s really the one\nwho \u2014 who raised me, more or less. Not that I didn\u2019t see my parents, I mean, I saw them\nquite a bit, but \u2014 we always had meals together. We always ate \u2014 we used to get the \u2014 and\nyou know, in Europe yo-you eat your main meal at noon, I mean.",
        "A: And so we always had that together, but I don\u2019t \u2014 in the evening they were often gone.\nBut, you know, he was a very nice person.",
        "A: No. My sister was two years older.",
        "A: Her name was Ruth.",
        "A: Ruth.",
        "A: I was born in 1920.",
        "A: And she was born 1918.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Marguerata(ph) Helena Hahn, h-a-h-n.",
        "A: But she was called Margar(ph).",
        "A: And so then they \u2014 you know, my father, I remember, he 1s \u2014 at the time I had allergic\neczema, which of course, when I was a child they didn\u2019t know it was allergy. And I\nremember my father always at night bandaging my arms, so that I wouldn\u2019t scratch, you\nknow. But you know, I don\u2019t really know if it was so often. It just \u2014 your memory just\nplays tricks on you. Anyway, it was \u2014 it was very nice. I grew up \u2014 well, my family, I\nguess they had a lot of money, but I didn\u2019t really know that, you know? I \u2014 it never\noccurred to me that I lived different from a lot of other people.",
        "A: Well, we lived \u2014 and later when we\u2019 ve finished I\u2019Il show you the pictures, because I\nhave pict \u2014 pictures on the wall of \u2014 of my \u2014 I grew up in what used to be my\ngrandparents dairy farm.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yes. And it was a regular farm in a U-shape, with the main house on one side, and\nthen what used to be the barns in a U-shape around it. In the middle was a \u2014 a well. And\nof course we didn\u2019t have any animals any more \u2014 I mean, we had dogs, but \u2014 and\nchickens, but not the cows and stuff. So we used the barns mainly for garages.",
        "A: For garage.",
        "A: And also for our bicycles and \u2014 and tools and stuff.",
        "A: No, it looked like a farm. And it [indecipherable] three acres. And it actually, when I\ngrew up, was no longer on the outskirts of \u2014 of town, it was in town.",
        "A: Yes. So it \u2014 you know, the streetcar was a half a block away. So it \u2014 then I took the\nstreetcar to go to wo \u2014 to go to school. So it \u2014 it was really in the middle of town. And the\none thing I really regret, it \u2014 1t has been razed now, and I regret that because if historic\npreservation had come into life sooner, that thing would have stayed, because it\u2019s very\nunusual to have a farm in the middle of \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 of town.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: But, you know, in any ca \u2014 1n any case, where \u2014 the main house, when you faced it, sat\non the left, and it was really very beautiful. It was big house, and \u2014",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Well, it was just \u2014",
        "A: Twenty \u2014 turn of the century.",
        "A: A stucco house.",
        "A: And it had a \u2014 a gate in the front, which usually was open because we had cars, but\nyou could close the gate, and then it had a driveway, long driveway, which led you into\nthe courtyard. And next door was a boys\u2019 school, which was kind of nice when I grew up.\nBut it was really just beautiful, and we had a large, just garden for \u2014 to enjoy, and then we\nhad a lot of vegetables, and we had chickens. A-And \u2014 and we did have a lot of help. I-I\nthink we probably had three maids, and \u2014 and there was, from the \u2014 across the courtyard\nfrom the main house, there was th \u2014 at the end of the last barn there was another little\nhouse, and the \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the guy\u2019s name, it was sort of a \u2014 like a \u2014 a super in\nNovember 21, 2011\nan apartment building. He and his wife lived there, and you know, he would tend the\nfurnace, and do stuff like that.",
        "A: Yeah. And \u2014 and then we had a gardener who lived in the same place upstairs, and I \u2014\nI think we had three maids and a cook, but I can\u2019t \u2014 yeah, I think we had three maids and\na cook. So I sometimes wonder what my mother did all day, but \u2014",
        "A: My mother enjoyed ill health.",
        "A: Well, she \u2014 she was \u2014 I\u2019m sure she had some ill health, but 1f she \u2014 if she did, I know,\nhad a stomach operation early in her marriage. I have a feeling it all \u2014 it had to do with\nnerves too, you know? And then she, in 1929 she had a major operation, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nif it was a hysterectomy, or something like that. And what is very unfortunate, she had a\nsurgeon who was addicted to morphine, and he got her addicted.",
        "A: And she was addicted the rest of her life.",
        "A: And that was very unfortunate, because she was really a very wonderful person. But\nof course, I was only nine when this started, so I never really knew what a wonderful\nNovember 21, 2011\nperson she was. I knew it mainly through other people, who told me about it. She was,\nyou know, she had \u2014 of course had not gone to college, but she was pretty smart, and she\nhad a lot of common sense. And she was very \u2014 she had a lot of empathy. And I\u2019 tell\nyou a little story, during the depression, you know, in \u2014 starting in 1930, I guess, when\nthere was so much poverty in Germany, she started a soup kitchen at our house.",
        "A: And it\u2019s one of my most vivid memories. We \u2014 the kitchen door was on the side, and\nthe kitchen door had \u2014 had sort of a window you could raise up to the outside. And we\nwould have, every day, about 20 people who came. After a while, we started giving out\nlittle slips to people, to say which day they could come, and \u2014 with their name. And I\nknow I used to write those slips, which is why I remember it so well. And then they\nwould come starting at noon, and our cook would have a big soup, you know, something\nsubstantial, and bread. And we had benches in the courtyard. And if it was raining, we\nput them in the \u2014 one of the barns. And then the people would eat their lun-lunch, or main\nmeal, I guess. In fact, we had one couple that found each other and got married. And then\non Christmas, she always had everybody come, and she \u2014 they got \u2014 the men got shaving\ncream and stuff like that, and the women got some other stuff. He \u2014 they \u2014 they all got the\nlittle bag with goodies. So she really, I mean, and that was entirely my mother\u2019s make \u2014\ndoing.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: And she really, I mean, that\u2019s the kind of person she was. But, of course, the addiction\nwas dreadful, because you know, a-an addiction to morphine is the same as \u2014 as a heroin\naddiction, or any other. It\u2019s unpredictable. The mood can be \u2014 one day you think, oh,\nshe\u2019s wonderful, and then you talk a lot, and then the next day she\u2019s gone again, you\nknow. And \u2014 and she did go into rehab twice in Germany, and then it was better for a\nwhile, but it never lasted. And then when she came to this country \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t\nknow where she got her morphine. That\u2019s sometimes the curse of having money. And \u2014\nbut a \u2014 it was the same in \u2014 in Tucson, where she lived, I mean, she \u2014 and in the end, it\nwa \u2014 was just awful. But you know, tha-that is \u2014 that was very sad, really.",
        "A: But, you know, it \u2014 the one thing I \u2014 I\u2014 I have told this to my kids from the day they\nwere born, in order to make sure that they stayed away from all drugs, because I told\nthem how horrible this is.",
        "A: It \u20141t\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s really very sad. But, you know \u2014 and \u2014 and I know \u2014 I mean, we all\nknow it was \u2014 it was her surgeon who got her addicted, and he was addicted him \u2014 a lot\nof doctors are addicted, I think.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yes, they did. And \u2014 and, as I think I want to \u2014 I mean, they got divorced in \u201938. I\nthink it had na \u2014 it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that my mother was Jewish,\nand my father wasn\u2019t. My sister and I saw that divorce coming for years. Which doesn\u2019t\nmean they weren\u2019t friendly. They were very friendly, they always talked to each other\nand \u2014 and \u2014 but, you know, I \u2014 it\u2019s very hard to look at your parents and think about sex.",
        "A: But I think it was very \u2014 they were incompatible. That\u2019s what I think, you know, and I\nthink that my father wasn\u2019t that interested in it, and my mother was more interested 1n it,\nand do I think that was the basis for the divorce. Because she got married again, but \u2014 to\nthe guy that she\u2019d been going with for years, anyway.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Kids always know everything. Kids know everything.",
        "A: You know, you just \u2014 you think your kids don\u2019t know? Kids always know.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: No, we \u2014 we both knew \u2014 my sister and I both knew it. But \u2014 and \u2014 but you know,\nthat\u2019s the way it was, and I know my father knew it. But you know, tha \u2014 it didn\u2019t seem \u2014\nthat\u2019s why I think that that was the basis.",
        "A: And they were \u2014 when my mother died, six months before my father, and the one who\ngrieved the most was my father. So, you know, they were \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, that wa \u2014 they were just always \u2014 and he came over here and visited with her\nand her husband, and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and during \u2014 and after the war she went back to Germany once and stayed with\nmy father, you know, so \u2014 I mean, they were very good friends, they really liked each\nother. It\u2019s just, I think in bed they didn\u2019t mesh. So, you know, I mean, yeah, you don\u2019t\nthink about that when you\u2019re a child.",
        "A: No, we just knew that it was going on.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: You know, and \u2014 and that this guy, I mean, I could never stand her second husband,\nbut \u2014 and I think partly, perhaps because I felt he interfered, but I\u2019m not sure I just didn\u2019t\nlike him anyway. But, no, he \u2014 he \u2014 he was a friend of the family and he \u2014 they traveled\ntogether, all of them, and you know, it \u2014 it was \u2014 was just one of those \u2014",
        "A: When my \u2014I-\u2014 my father\u2019s parents were dead when I was born.",
        "A: So I don\u2019t know anything about that.",
        "A: His brothers, they were odd. Neither one of them got married. His older brother, the\noldest one I think was gay. I\u2019m pretty sure he was gay. In fact, \u2019'm sure he was gay. And\nhe lived not very far from where we lived, and he had a little \u2014 sort of a \u2014 in Germany\nyou know you \u2014 you sometimes have these little yards, that you can bring \u2014 where there\nare little houses that you [indecipherable]. Well, he had one of those little houses on our\nproperty, which of course was where he grew up, and he would come and \u2014 and \u2014 in the\nsummer with his friends, and so on and so forth. But \u2014 and his other brother I really never\nknew. He died in 1921.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: And so I\u2014I never knew him. But the fa \u2014 th-the older one, I knew quite well. He died\nin \u00b031, and \u2014",
        "A: But we \u2014 Heinrich(ph).",
        "A: And the other one\u2019s name was George. But neither one of them ever mar \u2014 well, the\none was gay, I mean, I\u2019m sure he was gay. He lived with his friend in an apartment not\nvery far. And my grandparents on my mother\u2019s side, adored my father.",
        "A: Yeah. They adored my father and \u2014 and in fact, when my grandmother died \u2014 she\nlived to be 89 \u2014 I can\u2019t remember exactly the date. That \u2014 that\u2019s my family tree.",
        "A: And I can take it off, and you can look at it. When she died, she left my father money.\nAnd she left a letter saying he had always been wonderful, and \u2014 and all this kind of stuff.\nNo, she \u2014 they were very fond of my father. They also didn\u2019t much like my mother\u2019s\nsecond husband, which is interesting because my mother\u2019s second husband was a Jew.\nBut they didn\u2019t like him much either. But \u2014 and okay, so th-they \u2014 and we saw my\ngrandparents, my mother\u2019s parents, a lot un \u2014 19 \u2014 until 1933. They had a summer house\nin KOnigstein, which is \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 nowadays it \u2014 it\u2019s almost a suburb of Frankfurt now because people live there and\ncommute in. But at the time you \u2014 you took either a car, or a train, and it took about an\nhour to get there, I mean, at that time.",
        "A: And we would spend s-summer vacation sometimes and always fall vacations there\nwith my grandparents and with my mother\u2019s sister and her family.",
        "A: My mother had two sisters. One was older. Sh-She is the one who \u2014 who made those\ntwo charcoal drawings of my grandparents, the grandfather and great-grandfather. She\nwas quite talented that way, but she was really a bitch on wheels.",
        "A: Yeah, she was, and she collected people, important people. That was her aim in life,\nshe collected important people. And she was also a manipulator. But, you know, sh-she\ndid have talent, I mean, those pictures are very nice.",
        "A: And I have a little picture of myself upstairs, when I was a child, that she did. She was\ngood.",
        "A: Yeah, she was fine. I mean, you know, she was just \u2014 we saw them a bit \u2014 those two\nwomen didn\u2019t get \u2014 I mean, they didn\u2019t have much in common. And then she had a\nNovember 21, 2011\nyounger sister, whom I never knew, because she died, I think, in 1922. She must have\nbeen very smart. And she was \u2014 of the three girls, she went to the university. And she\nwrote poems. She also was a \u2014 I don\u2019t know, she was a very good Jew; the only one in\nthat family. But she, and some of the po \u2014 my grandmother had the poems printed after\nshe died. And I don\u2019t know if I \u2014 I know I gave Steven one of the copies.",

        "A: And she died, she must have been 21, I think.",
        "A: Her name was Lucy. She was called Luchs(ph).",
        "A: And she was my godmother, and I don\u2019t know for sure what she died of. They said it\nwas typhus, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not really sure, you know, in 1921, you can\u2019t be sure.",
        "A: I know sh \u2014 that she was in the hospital, she was supposed to go somewhere for the\nsummer, and she got terrible intestinal problems and \u2014 and died.",
        "A: Yeah.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Nora.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, she was a\u2014 my mother was a middle child \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 which was always hard.",
        "A: But \u2014 and I think some of the problem stemmed from the fact that she was the middle\nchild, because the youngest one, who was 10 years younger than my mother \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 was obviously my grandmother\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Yes. And \u2014 and the older one was a manipulator and knew what to get, and my mother\nwas just in the middle.",
        "A: And I\u2019m sure that that was part of her problems. But, in any ca \u2014 my aunt had two\nchildren, a boy and a girl. The boy was called Erish(ph), and the girl was Anina(ph), like\nSteven\u2019s youngest daughter. And the boy died when he was 21.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: They always said he died of appendicitis, but actually he died of syphilis, because he\ndidn\u2019t take care of it, and then got sepsis.",
        "A: But, you know, that you couldn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t say that, so 1t was appendicitis, but we all knew what he died of. And he\nhad been my aunt\u2019s favorite, and my cousin often stayed with us, the bo \u2014 the girl,\nbecause my ca \u2014 aunt didn\u2019t much care for her. But after the boy died, of course \u2014",
        "A: She was the only one left, and then so \u2014 but I was on very good terms with my cousin\nwho died probably five years ago in Switzerland.",
        "A: Yeah, the \u2014 the sisters \u2014 my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s daughter.",
        "A: Her name was Anina(ph) von Malk(ph).",
        "A: As a married. She was \u2014 you know, there \u2014 there\u2019s some people in my family you\nshould have interviewed rather than me, because my cousin Anina(ph) married a man\nNovember 21, 2011\ncalled von Malk(ph), who was also a Jew, and my \u2014 I will say my aunt arranged that\nmarriage. And they \u2014 he was working in what was then Palestine, in Haifa \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for a British company. And then they came to England and lived in London, and\nthen when \u2014 during the war, when everybody got worried about being occupied by\nGermany, they took a boat, which they thought would take them to Mexico or to the\nUnited States; however, it only took them to Antigua.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It wa \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it wasn\u2019t the Saint Louis.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t the Saint Louis.",
        "A: But in any case, they got to Antigua, where they spent the rest of the war, about five\nyears. And then they went to Mexico City, and her husband was a \u2014 a amateur chef,\nhowever they \u2014 they opened a restaurant in Mexico City. First they did some catering,\nNovember 21, 2011\nand then they opened a restaurant. And they did very well, I think. And then they went\nback to Switzerland and got a divorce, but \u2014",
        "A: But that\u2019s a different story. But anyway, that was sort of an interesting life \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, to \u2014 to have been stranded in Antigua \u2014 there again, they had money,\nwhich helped.",
        "A: You know. But \u2014",
        "A: Oh, absolutely.",
        "A: There\u2019s no \u2014 there\u2019s no question. I mean, you know, I can \u2014 I said to somebody the\nother day, and I said, you know, I\u2019ve now been in Washington \u2014 oh, how\u2019s my \u2014 how\nold\u2019s my daughter? Fifty-six, so \u2019ve been here 56 years, in Washington. In the state I\u2019ve\nbeen longer. But I said, you know, normally, I should be in Frankfurt, with my entire\nwhole family together, but everybody\u2019s someplace else.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: You know, the family is \u2014 was absolutely \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 scattered everywhere. And that \u2014 that is an impact to \u2014 I mean, it is not, of course, a\nconcentration camp or anything like that, but \u2014 but it does affect you.",
        "A: Yeah, my mother\u2019s parents.",
        "A: Well, they \u2014",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 my grandmother was about probably three inches taller than my\ngrandfather. Very tall, erect person. I\u2019ll show you pictures later. And my grandfather was\na very nice man, rather short, like my husband too, and we are all short. And his \u2014 his\nnickname was Bubish(ph).",
        "A: Yeah. But his name was Ludwig, Ludwig Arnold. All the Hahns were L.A.",
        "A: And \u2014 because that\u2019s what the fa \u2014 firm was called. And \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Well, I think originally it stood for Louis Aldous(ph), or something like that, for a\ngreat \u2014 they were all L.A.:s.",
        "A: And \u2014 but he he was Ludwig Arnold. And they lived \u2014 they had a house in\nFrankfurt, not far from the bank. And in fact, it was close to the elementary school I\nwent to, and I sometimes went there after school, you know, in \u2014 in Germany school is\nonly til lunchtime, and \u2014 or used to be. And then they had that house in Switzerland \u2014 in\n\u2014 in K6nigstein.",
        "A: And \u2014 where they spent time \u2014 they traveled a great deal, and they had a lot of money.\nI wish some were left, but \u2014 but that \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, none of my family lived like they had a lot of money.",
        "A: Nah. But, I mean, okay, they had \u2014 they had a car, and a sofa, you know, but \u2014 but so\ndid other people, I mean that \u2014 but they were \u2014 didn\u2019t live in a mansion \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",

I met a woman\nhere, no \u2014 a few years ago again, that I went to high school with, by chance, and she said\nto me, well, you were the rich girl. I said, I was? And she said, well, you had a car.",
        "A: So, you know, but that just didn\u2019t register. And you know, you don\u2019t pay attention.\nUnless you live ostentatious, you don\u2019t pay attention.",
        "A: I mean, we \u2014 I had to take the streetcar to \u2014 to go to school, or my bicycle. I mean, no\n\u2014no chauffeur took me to school, and \u2014 or picked me up, or anything like that. We had\nno sofa, my parents, and my mother got a car early, a Peugeot, in 1929, I think. And she\nwas a good driver, and my father was not a very good driver. But she was a good driver.\nAnd I know it was one of the early cars in Frankfurt, and \u2014 but anyway, my\ngrandparents no \u2014 and then \u2014 I can\u2019t quite remember, but in \u2014 I think it was in 1929, when\nmy grandfather was 70, we all stayed \u2014 went to Locarno \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and we all stayed in a hotel, and \u2014 and \u2014 to celebrate my grandfather\u2019s birthday, my\nsister and I had to do a little sketch that my aunt had written. Terrible. But \u2014 and I think it\nwas at that time that they looked at property in \u2014 in the \u2014 in Ticino, on the \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yes, on the Laco Maggiore. And my mother\u2019s cousin, Albert Hahn \u2014",
        "A: No, oh. Okay. Well, I\u2019Il show you the book later.",
        "A: Albert Hahn, who was also at the bank, was a \u2014 a well-known economist.",
        "A: He was my grandfather\u2019s nephew, and he bought a house right there, at \u2014 near\nAscona.",
        "A: Ah, no, Ticino is \u2014 it\u2019s the county.",
        "A: And the lake is the Laco Maggiore.",
        "A: Yeah. And the Laco Maggiore 1s half in Italy and half in Switzerland.",
        "A: And Ticino is the Italian county or whatever they\u2019re called, in Switzerland. You\nknow, Switzerland is \u2014 1s three parts, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Italian, French and German. And Ticino is the Italian part. And I think my mother\u2019s\ncousin bought the house there in ninet \u2014 when we were all there.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: And the first time we went there for vacation, I think, was in 1932, but we stayed at\nmy cousin\u2019s, at my uncle\u2019s house. And at that point, I think my grandparents bought a\nhouse there, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not sure of the date when they bought it, but they \u2014 it wa \u2014 by\n1933 they had a house in Switzerland, on the lake. And I think it was the end of \u201933, or\nearly \u00b034 that they left Germany.",
        "A: Yeah, they \u2014",
        "A: Well, they had dual citizenship. [Il tell you, this goes back, I think, maybe to the war\nof 1848, or something like that, or maybe the 1870 war. I\u2019m not sure which war, but\nsome war, where you could not serve if you had different citizenship, and you could buy\nthe Swiss citizenship.",
        "A: Which is what one fwo \u2014 great-grandfather of \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know who, but one of\nthe great-grand \u2014 my \u2014 either my great-grandfather on my mother\u2019s side, or my great-\ngreat-grandfather on my mother\u2019s side, bought the Swiss citizenship. And from there on,\nthey were all \u2014 they all had dual citizenship.",
        "A: Right. It was extremely useful.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: And so 1-1t was, I think, in \u201933, or \u201934 that my grandparents decided to move to\nSwitzerland permanently. And as I wrote to you, they gave up that German citizenship at\nthe consulate in Lugano, | think, and the consul asked why.",
        "A: And my grandmother said, three guesses. Well, it \u2014",
        "A: No, no, that \u2014 it was just \u2014 1t was just very fortunate.",
        "A: You know, I mean, that really \u2014 all of that \u2014 you know, relationships in families are\nvery important, and make a lot of difference. And I\u2019Il tell you why I say this. The bank, I\ntold you, was in \u2014 was a company with shares, I mean \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 public. However, it was \u2014 all the shares were family held. And my grandfather and\nthis nephew that I was talking about, were chairmen, or whatever.",
        "A: No, Albert, the \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. They \u2014 they were \u2014 Albert Hahn also was a professor at the university in\nFrankfurt, but I mean, his main job was at the bank. And then, of course, in \u00b033, it all\nbecame more difficult. My mother\u2019s sister\u2019s husband was also at the bank, but he was not\nvery competent. Was a nice guy, but not very competent. And my father at that point, was\nworking at a different bank that belonged to my grandmother\u2019s brother. And then, in \u201934\nor so, I think, they asked my father to leave that bank and come to the Deutsche Effecten\nWechselbank. But of course, all of that, I mean nu \u2014 and \u2014 and my grandfather left, and\nthe nephew left. But of course, it still was a bank with a lot of Jewish connections.",
        "A: And the \u2014 the se \u2014 many \u2014 much of the shares were held by the family. When my\ngrandmother had a \u2014 a cousin \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m never quite sure what the relationship is, but it\u2019s\nsort of a cousin, or a nephew, or whatever, who had been the black sheep in the family,\nand had been exiled by the family to South Africa, where fortunately, he went into\ndiamond mines.",
        "A: And he did extremely well. In fact, he was knighted by the Queen of England.",
        "A: And because they did a lot of charity work then.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: And nobody in the family had been friendly with him, but my grandmother was\nalways friendly with him. And I remember the guy very well, because he used to come\nbring me big boxes of chocolates. And I also have a very beautiful diamond brooch that\nhe gave my mother. So anyway, they kept up very closely, and of course, he was British\nby now, and his family acquired the shares. So that during the Nazi time, the shares were\nall in British ownership, which made an enormous difference, of course, because they\ncouldn\u2019t really \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 reach the bank.",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was more or less saved, yes. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yeah. And I know \u2014 I mean, I remember, this guy\u2019s name was Max Michaelas(ph),\nand \u2014 and Lady Michaelas(ph), I remember her, you know. And \u2014 and after the war, my\nniece went to stay with their kids in England, you know, so \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve lost track of\nthem now, but it\u2019s, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s a long time ago. But at \u2014 that must \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Well, they bought them, or whatever.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I mean, they tried their level best to get the bank to close. And I know my father had\nmany headaches. But then, of course \u2014 and they were supposed to merge with the \u2014 with\nthe bank called Frankfurter Bank. Well, fortunately, the Frankfurter Bank was\ndestroyed by an air raid. So that went out \u2014",
        "A: It was a private bank, like a lot of private banks in Frankfurt were. I think it was well\nrespected and pretty big. Not \u2014 but not like the Bank of America or anything, it was\nsimply a private bank.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: No, it was, you know, you could have your account there, and people \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and they have tellers.",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 no, no branches, what \u2014 just one.",
        "A: But they had tellers and \u2014 and they had a seat on the stock exchange, and all the rest of\nit.",
        "A: So, it \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: And actually he and \u2014 and my aunt\u2019s husband was also Aryan. He \u2014",

        "A: But her husband was not a Jew.",
        "A: And so the two of them.",
        "A: But as I said before, her husband was not so bright. He was a nice guy.",
        "A: But \u2014 but was what \u2014 best I can say.",
        "A: And \u2014 and so anyway, tho-those two and he \u2014 but he retired during the war. So then\nmy father was it.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Right. I mean, the building was pretty well \u2014 not destroyed, but was pretty damaged.\nBut it\u2019s in the middle of Frankfurt, and as you know, Frankfurt was 80 percent\ndestroyed.",
        "A: So, you know, it \u2014 it had a lot of damage, but they \u2014",
        "A: But \u2014 yeah, as a business they stayed. And of course, how banking, you know, it was\naltogether different. What was very nice \u2014 you know, Frankfurt was occupied in nine \u2014\nin March of 1945, a couple of months before the end of the war. And I think the day after\nwe were occupied, this Jeep drove up and asked for my father, and he was there, because\nat that point nobody went anyplace. And they took him in the Jeep, and left. And we\nwere a little worried, you know.",
        "A: I mean, they were Americans, of course, but you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we were a little worried. And then he came back, which pleased us.",
        "A: And he said he had been asked to reopen the banks in Frankfurt.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Well, to \u2014 to open the trade again. Because obviously OSS knew exactly who we\nwere.",
        "A: There was no question.",
        "A: So that was very nice.",
        "A: And then he said yes, the Americans had that \u2014 this and that and the other, so I said to\nhim, as long as you\u2019re talking to the Americans, ask them if \u2014 I could work there as an\ninterpreter, and I did. So \u2014 but 1t was a scary minute when they came with the Jeep and\npicked him up and we didn\u2019t know what was going on.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right, right.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. Well, you know, of course, it was a different time.",
        "A: And I certainly didn\u2019t have the relationship with my grandparents that I have with my\nown grandchildren now.",
        "A: Because they were people of respect, you know, and so \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. It wasn\u2019t a ra \u2014 I liked them and they liked us, but 1t wasn\u2019t a close relation \u2014 I\nmean, I \u2014 I would not go and tell them a story, or anything like that. But \u2014 and my\ngrandparent \u2014 my grandfather had a \u2014 a favorite thing. When my parents called, if we\nwere in \u2014 in one of their houses in KOnigstein, and my parents called and say how are the\nkids, and my grandfather would say, they are so nice when they\u2019re asleep. But that was a\nfavorite saying.",
        "A: But you know, they were nice, and \u2014 and I enjoyed them, but I can\u2019t say I had a close\nrelationship with them. But we enjoyed each other. And then they \u2014 my grandfather died\nin Los Angeles.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: No.",
        "A: In 1945, I think.",
        "A: Well, in 1941, my mother and my aunt were at that point both in the United States.\nMy mother lived in Tucson, and my aunt lived in Santa Monica. And my grandparents\ndecided to come and spend Christmas with them in 1941. Which was not a good idea,\nbecause that way they couldn\u2019t get back.",
        "A: Because you know what happened in 1941. So they were stuck in Los Angeles. So\nthey spent the war in Los Angeles.",
        "A: So then my fa \u2014 and my grandfather died there. I mean, he was 89, but you know, he \u2014\nhe died there, and my grandmother went back to Switzerland.",
        "A: After he died. She went back in \u201947.",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was. But they \u2014 I think they were sorry they were not in their home.",
        "A: You know.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, apparently not. I mean, I \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I mean, I all \u2014 I always knew that my grandparents were Jews,\nand that my mother was Jewish by heritage. Which, I know a lot of other girls I knew\nwho were in the same boat did not know, and were absolutely shocked in \u00b033.",
        "A: Yes. I knew several of them, where they just never knew that they had any connection\nto Jews. My grandparents, I don\u2019t know that they ever went to synagogue, but I know\nYom Kippur seemed to fall mainly during farm vacations, and we often spent our farm\nvacations at my grandparents\u2019 house in KOnigstein, and my grandmother always locked\nherself into a bedroom on Yom Kippur, and said she was fasting. Now, my cousin, and\nwe always said, well, she\u2019s got the cupboard full of cookies, and she\u2019s probably not\nfasting, but I don\u2019t know.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: She may well have been fasting. But that is all I know, that \u2014 that was the only Jewish\nthing.",
        "A: Yeah. So they \u2014 as I said, my mother\u2019s youngest sister, I think was a devout Jew, but I\nnever knew her. And now \u2014",
        "A: German Reformed.",
        "A: Which is much better than Lutheran, and has nothing to do with Catholic.",
        "A: I\u2014I tell you, German Reformed was a small group in Frankfurt, which had been\npersecuted in the late 1800s.",
        "A: Yes, and we \u2014 our church \u2014 and I was brought up in that church \u2014 our church had \u2014\nyou couldn\u2019t see from the outside that it was a church, it just looked like a house. Had no\nstained glass windows, no tower, no bell, no nothing. But inside there was a real church.\nAnd it was a small congregation. My father was very active in it after the war, I don\u2019t\nknow. He and my sister got into religion, and I don\u2019t know why, but \u2014 which is not where\nNovember 21, 2011\nI got. And so there were a lot of old Frankfurt families that belonged to the German\nReform. There\u2019s also French Reform, but \u2014 which came from the Huguenots, you know.",
        "A: There were a lot of Huguenots that came from France to the Frankfurt area, and\nthere \u2014 you find a lot of French names there. But this was German Reform. Now, we\nalways had Christmas, and my mother\u2019s birthday happened to be on the 25\" of\nDecember.",
        "A: Yeah. And my daughter\u2019s on the 23\". And I remember that my grandparents used to\ncome for her birthday, and we always got Christmas presents. I mean, there was nothing\nof Hanukkah, anything like that. So, at \u2014 somehow they \u2014 they had sort of embraced my\nfam \u2014 my father\u2019s family, and \u2014 and I don\u2019t know, and I think a lot of those mixed\nmarriages in Frankfurt were that way. And I knew a lot of people who were in mixed\nmarriages. I \u2014 I think 1t was, 1f you pardon the expression, more the upper crust, you\nknow.",
        "A: But, it \u2014 it just was nothing unusual.",
        "A: Yeah.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 no, in Frankfurt it was every day, you know.",
        "A: Well, I tell you, I grew up, of course, since \u2014 since we seemed to be more on my\nfather\u2019s religion, I went to confirmation class, I was confirmed in the German Reform\nchurch. And then I married my husband. And he didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with\nreligion, period, because he said he can\u2019t believe that any God would allow what\nhappened, you know. So, he said, you do whatever you want to do. So since I grew up\nthat way, I had both my kids baptized, which is more than my son has done, or \u2014 and it\ndidn\u2019t mean anything to me, it was \u2014 I did it more to please my father, because at that\npoint he and my sister were very engaged in that church. And so I had them both baptized\n\u2014 they both went to \u2014 I joined briefly the Westmoreland Congregational Church here,\nbecause I was looking for a church that wasn\u2019t too churchy. And so that was fine, and the\nkids went there for \u2014 for Sunday school, til they were about nine or 10, and then they said\nwe \u2014 all we do is draw pictures. And they both went to [indecipherable] Friends, which\nof course, the Quaker school. Somehow I tend more to Jewish stuff now. It\u2019s not that I\nNovember 21, 2011\nwould join a synagogue, or do anything on that order, but I find it more interesting. And\nyou know, my daughter married a Jew, and \u2014 the family is interesting. I mean, my\ndaughter married a Jew, Steven is in \u2014 belongs to the Episcopal church. His wife is a\nlapsed Catholic who won\u2019t cross any church\u2019s door. The kids were not baptized, but my\ndaughter\u2019s three boys were \u2014 had a Bar Mitzvah. They \u2014 they \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, they belong to the synagogue, and now her two older boys \u2014 the middle boy is\nnever going to \u2014 interested anything.",
        "A: My daughter\u2019s three boys. The middle boy \u2014 the two older ones are in college, and my\ndaughter has said to them, you know, you are Bar Mitzvahed, and you do what you want\nto do, and it\u2019s your choi \u2014 call now. The older one claims that he kept the high holidays.\nThe younger \u2014 the middle one will have nothing to do with any of it. The youngest one,\nwho 1s still in high school, is very interested. So, you know, I think si\u2014 my son\u2019s three\nchildren were baptized, but that\u2019s about it. And I don\u2019t think they ever go to church or do\nanything. It \u2014 you know, families are interesting.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Well, I went to private school first.",
        "A: The same one that my mother went to, my sister went to, and in fact, my nieces \u2014 my\nniece went to. A little private school in Frankfurt. Now, for reasons that I cannot\nfathom, my sister had \u2014 who is two years old \u2014 who was two years older, as I told you,\nhad changed to a public school, when she got into high school, I guess.",
        "A: And that public school was on the other side of the river. I don\u2019t even know why, but\nit was supposed to be so good, you know. Which was fine. That was in 1931. Now, my\ntime came in 1933.",
        "A: Which is a different time.",
        "A: And for reasons that I cannot fathom, my parents decided I would go to the public\nschool.",
        "A: Do that. Pll have a cigarette.\n44November 21, 2011\nNovember 21, 2011\nBeginning File Two",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: 1933.",
        "A: Well, that was a very unfortunate choice that my parents made, I \u2014 I \u2014 I mentioned\nearlier that my mother was not well.",
        "A: And in early \u201933, she had a nervous breakdown, which I think was related to Hitler\u2019s\ntaking o \u2014 my mother is one of the very few people that I know, who had read \u201cMein\nKampf,\u201d and knew what was coming. And so I think she had a nervous breakdown, and\ntherefore didn\u2019t really think about my school. I mean, I do \u2014 I don\u2019t blame her, you know,\nwhen you're sick, you\u2019re sick. So anyway, they sent me to public school, and of course in\n1933, you shouldn\u2019t send a half-Jew to public school who \u2014 when you have a private\nschool where you\u2019ve been.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: The explanation was that that private school would require Greek for graduation, and\nthey didn\u2019t want to have me do that, but you know, I-I \u2014 I think that\u2019s a lame excuse,\nbecause you know, other kids could learn it too, so why couldn\u2019t I have learned what I\nneeded to learn? But in any case, they sent me \u2014",
        "A: I think nobody thought much, because I think it was a horrible time. A-And you know,\nyou change schools in Germany, or you didn\u2019t; in any case, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like\nnow; on Easter, after Easter, that\u2019s when the new year starts. And that was pretty soon\nafter Hitler took over, and I think they just never thought. In any case, I went to that\nschool, and there was one a\u2014 one more half-Jewish girl in the class, and one girl who was\na full Jew, and the rest were not. The other half-Jewish girl, unfortunately her last name\nwas Solomon, which of course, a much more Jewish name than Bartmann was. And we\nhad a classroom teacher who was really a Nazi. And some of the other teachers were too,\nand of course, some of the girls were. And it was not always pleasant. There \u2014 I \u2014 I did\nhave two or three friends, or four sa \u2014 more even. In fact, one of my high school friends is\nstill alive, like I am. She lives in Frankfurt, and my niece takes care of her, because she\nnever married, and she\u2019s alone, and so my niece takes care of her. But \u2014 and she was my\nfriend. I'll tell you about her in a minute, because she is also an interesting case. But, you\nknow, like on Saturdays, for instance \u2014 you were always on the outside \u2014 on Saturdays,\nanybody who belonged to the BDM, you know, Bund Deutscher Machen(ph) \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 was off. But those of us who didn\u2019t, had to come to school. And there were about 10\nof us 1n the class, six or eight who had to come to school, and then we had meaningless\nclasses, because we had to have meaningless class, because the others weren\u2019t there. But,\nyou know, you were an outsider. I mean, you weren\u2019t part of the group. And \u2014",
        "A: Well, we had this one tea \u2014 they were mostly men, their \u2014 the classroom teacher was\nour Latin teacher also, and I don\u2019t know, I got terrible grades. I was very poor \u2014 I-I\nwouldn\u2019t say I was \u2014 I never did homework, which didn\u2019t help. And \u2014 and I was a little\nheavy at the time, and quite busty. And he would always say, you seem to be leaning on\nthe table like a pudding.",
        "A: Which 1s not really what you like to hear, you know?",
        "A: And in any case, from him I got horrible grades. I think he taught Latin and French.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: [Speaks German]\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Oh, it\u2019s horrible.",
        "A: And I got really terrible grades, and \u2014 and the more \u2014 I think he tried psychology on\nme, but it didn\u2019t work. And the more he did this, the worse I got in school. And a \u2014 one\nsemester he was not there, and I got very good grades from some other teacher. So, I\nmean, I \u2014 I think a lot had to do with that. In any case, I went there for three years, and I\nreally \u2014 I mean, I wasn\u2019t unhappy, but it was just not a good experience. It \u2014 it was\nstupid.",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. Now, for instance, we had \u2014 the school had sort of a summer\nplace, or a\u2014a place in the country where they would take the \u2014 each class for \u2014 for a\nweek at a time, or something. Now, the girl who was a full Jew was not allowed to go.\nAnd the other one who wa \u2014 whose name was Solomon, they debated for a long time\nwhether she could go. Now, they didn\u2019t say anything to me, because my last name was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 different. But, you know, you always weren\u2019t sure, were you go \u2014 were you gonna\nbe able to do this, and of course, you want to do this when \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 go with your class, you know.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: And there were many things like that, that you felt people are looking at you ina\ndifferent way.",
        "A: Well, that came later.",
        "A: That was not in school, I didn\u2019t notice that so much. But somehow it was \u2014 it was very\nunfortunate. And then my sister had gone to boarding school in England, in 1935, I\nthink. And in 1936 \u2014 I-I\u2019m trying to get the dates right, yes, I think it was 1936, they\ndecided I would go to \u2014 to a\u2014 a boarding school in England. And I ha \u2014 I didn\u2019t know\nthis til almost the end of the school year \u2014 of course, that was the time nobody asked you\nif you want to do this, you were just simply told, that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. And so I said\nto that classroom teacher, I said, I\u2019m leaving. Whereupon he said to me, if you had told\nme sooner, I would have given you the grades you really deserve, but I didn\u2019t know you\nweren\u2019t coming back. Which was very interesting, you know. So he said, you really\ndeserved better. But anyway, you know \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 you \u2014 you just don\u2019t know. So I went to boarding school in England, which I\nabsolutely hated. My sister loved it, I just absolutely hated it. But part of it, I think, was\nbecause my mother had left Germany at the end of \u201934, I think.",
        "A: Yes. That\u2019s when she went to England.",
        "A: And it may have been early \u00b035, like I\u2019m not a hundred percent sure of the date. And\nmy sister had gone to boarding school, so I was home alone with my father, who was\nvery lenient, and I did what I wanted to do. Not homework for sure, but \u2014 but everything\nelse. I just had a good time. And then I went to England to this boarding school, where\nevery minute of the day is programmed.",
        "A: I mean there \u2014 yeah. I mean, there is no escape. You leave your \u2014 at that time, you \u2014\nyou leave your bedroom, which, well the bedroom was for all the girls, at 7:30 in the\nmorning for breakfast, and you\u2019re not allowed to come back til the evening. You have to\ntake everything you have to have, with you. Well, I hated the whole place, and I was\nthere for one year. Nobody had asked me if I wanted to go, but I went. And then, after the\nyear, they decided I would go to Switzerland to learn French. Now there, I will say, they\ngave me a choice of two different schools, which I went, inspected with my father. And\none of the things I had hated in that boarding school, among other things, was the\nNovember 21, 2011\nbathrooms, which you shared with a million kids. So I chose the little school, where you\nhad a bathroom where you could lock the door. So I went there, and there were only\nabout 40 of us, maybe 35 kids. I really enjoyed that. It was very nice, I was very good in\nFrench, which I don\u2019t remember at all any more, but it was \u2014 it was really very nice, and\nthere were many girls from England, probably about 10 or 11 girls from London, and\nthere were three Americans \u2014 no, there were four Americans. And then the rest was\ndifferent. One girl was from Haifa, she was an Arab, and there were some Italians and a\ncouple of Swiss. It was interesting \u2014 and that\u2019s a sideline that I knew there was a big\nkerfuffle at the beginning, in the American room \u2014 they \u2014 they stupidly, they \u2014 there was\none other German girl, and I don\u2019t know why they would put us together in a room with \u2014\nwith a Greek girl and an Italian girl, and they put all four American girls into one room.\nAnd I knew there was a big kerfuffle, but I never understood \u2014 I mean, we just didn\u2019t\nknow. And it was only after I was in this country for a while, and looked at the pictures\nthat I realized that one of the girls was black. Very light black, but she was black. And\nI\u2019m sure that\u2019s what the kerfuffle was all about. She was from San Francisco, her name\nwas Georgia Naifi(ph). I \u2014 I got invited to her wedding, but of course it was during the\nwar, so I didn\u2019t go.",
        "A: But, you know, it didn\u2019t dawn on me. I never even saw that she was black when I was\nover there. I\u2019d never seen a black girl, and she was very light, and you know, what did I\nNovember 21, 2011\nknow? I never knew she was black, but when I looked at old pictures, I suddenly thought,\nnow I know what went on there.",
        "A: I\u2014I think as a German girl.",
        "A: In England, a German girl.",
        "A: No question.",
        "A: And in \u2014 now, in that school in Switzerland we had a couple of Jewish girls. I mean, I\nknow one of the American girls was a Jew from New York, and we had an interesting\nBritish girl, Naomi de Rothschild, whom I visited in London with a butler and a\nelevator in the \u2014 a really \u2014 now they really lived, you know. But it was \u2014 no, I \u2014 I mean, I\nwould look the par \u2014 I don\u2019t know about the other German girl. She was clearly an\nAryan. If she was a Nazi, I\u2019m not \u2014 I really can\u2019t tell, because at that point we \u2014 we don\u2019t\ntalk about that, you know.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Oh yes, no question.",
        "A: I felt it clearly.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: There were dis \u2014 political discussions, yes, and I know, you know, as I said before, we\nhad \u2014 there were maids, and they were all Catholics, and they all asked my parents how\nto vote always. And so we \u2014 we heard all these things, you know. And there were the\ndiscussions on \u2014 you know, at that point I can\u2019t remember, you know, the Nazis killed off\none of their own, I can\u2019t remember what his name was, but \u2014 and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: And so, all this kind of stuff, we \u2014 we did discuss at home. I mean, we knew what was\ngoing on. There was no question.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They were all very loyal.",
        "A: Yes. No question. And the \u2014 the woman who was hired when she was, I think 24,\nwhen I was born, died in Tucson, because she came \u2014 she stayed in England at my\nmother\u2019s house all during the war \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and then came to a \u2014 to this country, and she died in Tucson. But \u2014 and the other\nmaids also were really very loyal. And then the maid that we had that my friend says I\u2019m\nalways quoting, she came to us during the war. In fact, I hired her. She had been a maid\nwith a Jewish family in Frankfurt who left, and she was extremely fond of them, and\nthen was very happy with us too. So we were lucky in \u2014 with these people. But anyway,\nthen after that year in \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 Switzerland, it was decided that I would go back to England and live with my\nmother and her husband, and go to school. And I went to Saint Paul\u2019s Girls\u2019 School,\nwhich was \u2014 I went there as a day student, and I mean, they also had a boarding thing, but\nI was a day student. And I graduated from that school, and I took \u2014 I can never think of it,\nif it was A levels or O levels, I can\u2019t remember. But in any case, it was a level to \u2014 that\nimmediately \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it took me into the university.",
        "A: Ica\u2014I can\u2019t remember. But I still have the certificate somewhere, but anyway, that\nwas in 1939, and I went home for the summer.",
        "A: And that was the end of that.",
        "A: Yes.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Well, I remember exactly where I was on the first of September, because I was at the\npublic swimming pool in Frankfurt with a guy I knew, and we were lying on the grass,\nand we heard it on the radio. And I said well, I guess by the time \u2014 by this time next\nweek, we won\u2019t be lying in the grass any more, we\u2019d be bombed. Well, of course, took\nanother two years to get any air raids in Frankfurt, but I don\u2019t know, I think, in\nretrospect, I think I probably could have left in time.",
        "A: Yeah. From Frankfurt to go back to London.",
        "A: It was not what I had planned, I \u2014 my parents had given me a trip to America as a\ngraduation present. Now, here\u2019s the irony. We were suppo \u2014 my father and I were going\non the Bremen. We were supposed to leave August 22\u2122. My father had a important\nmeeting on the 24\", so we changed the tickets to September third.",
        "A: And the Bremen \u2014",
        "A: Was the end of that. So that\u2019s the irony. I would have been in this country. Of course,\nmy father might have been unhappy.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: But it would have been interesting. Or, I might have been able, you know, if I had\nforesight, and my parents had foresight, I mean, I don\u2019t know, I mean, I might have been\nable to get on a train and go to be \u2014 go back to London in time. But, on the other hand, I\nwas very fond of my father.",
        "A: I think because of my mother\u2019s illness, you know. And of course, I didn\u2019t like her\nsecond husband, as you know, as I said before.",
        "A: And I would have had to go back and live with them, and I \u2014 I don\u2019t know. And you\nknow, you\u2019re 19, you don\u2019t pay attention. You know, you \u2014 you live every day as it\ncomes along, and \u2014 and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, you figure everything\u2019s gonna work out just fine, you know.",
        "A: And \u2014 and I will say, all of us thought, at home, that the war would last a year, or\nmaybe two, because Germany would be defeated.",
        "A: Yes.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was sad, you know, it is sad. I was clearly, I \u2014 I was German, you know, and \u2014 and \u2014\nand just think \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a different story, but just think when this country, we lost\nVietnam, which was annoying, to put it mildly. But, you know, when it\u2019s \u2014 when you\u2019re\nin the country, and you know the only way this country can really survive, and you can\nsurvive, 1s if that country \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 loses the war. I knew if the \u2014 1f we didn\u2019t lose the war, we were goners, you know,\nthere was no question in my mind. So, for very selfish reasons \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you hoped that the country will lose the war. But it\u2019s hard when it\u2019s your own\ncountry, because I was clearly German. There wasn\u2019t any question in my mind. So it \u2014 it\nwasn\u2019t easy.",
        "A: Yeah, it \u2014 it \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Okay, so anyway, it \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was very hard for my sister, because you know, she\nhad that baby, and she had to go back to work. And I worked \u2014 oh, I haven\u2019t told you\nabout my work.",
        "A: I\u2014I- well, when I go back a little bit to \u00b039, because I told you we only thought the\nwar would last very short. So, my father decided that I should go to Berlin, to a\nhousehold school, you know, e-economy.",
        "A: Yeah. Which is really stupid. So, we went to Berlin, we got a room, I got a room. We\nwent \u2014 I went to this school where there were mainly young women who were planning\nto get married very soon, you know. So I wasn\u2019t planning on that. And you know, that\nwas very interesting because you know, I was in a strange territory, nobody knew me. I\nwasn\u2019t about to say anything about my heritage, or anything else. And there was one girl\nwho at one point said to me \u2014 I was friendly with her, and she said to me, you know, I\nNovember 21, 2011\nhave to ask you a question, and I don\u2019t want you to take it the wrong way. And I said, so,\nwhat is it? He said, are you half Jewish? And I said, why are you asking this? And she\nsaid, where I come from there\u2019s a family by the name of Bartmann and they\u2019re Jewish.\nAnd I said, well that happens to be my Aryan side. And I said, yes I am. And she said, so\nam I. And, but you know, neither one of us had said anything to anybody else, and in\nfact, I was friendly with one woman who I\u2019m sure never knew, and I wasn\u2019t about to tell\nher.",
        "A: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, there wasn\u2019t any point. And the \u2014 this one girl who was\nhalf Jewish also, got married to a Norwegian, and we all went to the wedding. It was very\nnice, but you know, that \u2014 that was interesting, but of course, the war wasn\u2019t over, you\nknow. And so I came back, and then I ha \u2014 I don\u2019t quite remember this, but somehow I\nthink I went someplace to learn Spanish, which I have never mastered in my entire life;\nI\u2019ve taken three more Spanish classes, I just can\u2019t do \u2014 seem to do it. But anyway, and\nthen I had to go to work. And you know, the \u2014 the thing that completely disrupted my\nlife, is that I had always wanted to go to medical school, from probably the time I was 12\nor 13. And of course, in Germany I was not permitted. And in England I had been \u2014 you\nknow, I had started \u2014 I was gonna go to the University of London Medical School, but\nyou know, so that was out. And so I felt, well, maybe I could work at a doctor\u2019s office.\nAnd we knew a guy who was a radiologist, who also had some Jewish connections, and\nNovember 21, 2011\nhe said, well, P\u2019Il ask some of my colleagues, you know. So this doctor called, and said,\nwould I come and be interviewed. He had joined the Nazi party in 1933, which 1s early.",
        "A: He had a practice, a medical practice in the blue collar area in Frankfurt, near the\nmain railroad station. His main patients, all his patients were what here you would call\nMedicare patients, you know, on \u2014 on \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, on \u2014 in \u2014a~\u2014a lot of them were railroad workers, and \u2014 and the other were blue\ncollar workers. And he interviewed me, and he said yeah, I think it\u2019s fine, and you look\nright, you know. And then he \u2014 for some reason they have to go to the AMA \u2014 I mean,\nthe equivalent of the AMA in Germany to say they are hiring, and they told him he\ncouldn\u2019t hire a half-Jew. And he said \u2014 now, this Nazi said to them, that\u2019s fine. Then I\u2019 Il\nclose my practice. And of course they couldn\u2019t afford that, because he had all these blue\ncollar workers and those regular workers. So they said okay, hire her. And I will tell you,\nthey were the loveliest people. They had an apartment \u2014 two apartments put together, and\none was the practice, and the other was the \u2014 where they lived. He and his wife, they had\ntwo sons and a daughter. It was hard work, because we had to be there \u2014 I had to be there\nat eight o\u2019clock in the morning, and then we worked til about 1:30 or so, and then there\nwere two hours off, and then I was back at 3:30, and then we worked til eight o\u2019clock at\nnight.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: I mean, you know, they had a lot of patients, and there weren\u2019t that many doctors, and\nI did everything. I mean, he taught me everything. I did the insurance, I did the lab work.\nI mean, the guy taught me everything. He had a horrible temper, and would yell. And the\nfirst time he yelled at me, I got up and said, when you\u2019re done, I'll come back here. And\nfrom then on, when he was in a bad humor, his wife would say to me, Miss Bartmann,\nyou deal with it. And he was \u2014 he was \u2014 they were just the loveliest people. I mean, I\ncan\u2019t begin to tell you how wonderful they were. And you know, every day in \u2014 about for\n\u2014 five o\u2019clock, she would open the door and say come in, have a cup of tea, you know.\nAnd they \u2014 they were \u2014 and their kids were nice, and I mean they were ab \u2014",
        "A: I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I have no idea, I never asked him.",
        "A: No. I never asked him, and it just \u2014 we never talked about those things. He certainly\nwas no Nazi at that point. And, you know, I think he had no idea what he was joining.\nAnd he \u2014 unfortunately, at the end of 19 \u2014 no, early in 1944 \u2014 late in 1943, or early in\nfour \u2014 in \u201944, they were bombed out. And they moved to Schlangenbad, which is not far\nfrom Frankfurt, where he opened a practice. And they asked me to come with them, but\nat that point my niece was born, and I \u2014 and my sister was working, and I felt I had to\nstay home. And also, I really didn\u2019t want to leave my father. So I said, no, I \u2014 I think I\nNovember 21, 2011\nwon\u2019t. And so he said, well, we\u2019ll see that you find another place that we know. And\nsome woman doctor first hired me, and then she was bombed out. And then this guy who\nlived not very far, like from here to where you turn to Mass Avenue, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 not terribly far. He had his practice there, and he hired me. Now, his wife was a\nquarter Jew. She in fact, had been in school with my deceased aunt, my \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 mother\u2019s youngest sister. I knew exactly who she was. He was the biggest Nazi you\never want to meet. He treated me like a piece of dirt. You know, at that point none of us\nknew the \u2014 the phrase sexual harassment, but the first week I was there, he chased me\naround the desk and kept saying, sit, come sit.",
        "A: Yeah. And I said no, you know, and that was the end of his treating me as a person. I\nmean, after that \u2014 and of course, I knew I couldn\u2019t leave, because it was a job, and if I left\nthe job, I\u2014 I risked being deported someplace.",
        "A: Right.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: No, no. If you da \u2014 if you had no help, one of you could stay home to do the house.",
        "A: Yes. And if \u2014 but if you had help, you couldn\u2019t stay home. And being a half Jew, I\nwould have been sent someplace \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 if I didn\u2019t have a job.",
        "A: Yes. What was precisely what he knew. And he knew I couldn\u2019t leave. And I had said\nto him, all is fine, I just would like when we have an air raid, I would like to ride my\nbicycle home, because my niece \u2014 our maid had the baby, and I said I would like to be\nthere with the baby during the air raid. And he said, fine. Well, he was a big shot in the\n[indecipherable] you know, and so as soon as there was an air raid siren, he put on his\nuniform and departed. And he said, take all the files in the basement. So, I \u2014 before\nanything else, I had to take the files in the basement. And there were many a day when I\nri \u2014 rode my bicycle home while the bombs were falling, because there wasn\u2019t any other\nway to do it. And it was dark, and you know, and you couldn\u2019t put a light on your\nbicycle. But I always made it home, and we \u2014 we were very lucky, we were not bombed\nout, although around us \u2014 I mean, sometimes you just don\u2019t know why y-you were there.\nI mean, we ha \u2014 we had incendiary bombs in the attic once, but we were able to \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yeah. And \u2014 but he was really \u2014 oh, he was so awful, I mean, and he kept \u2014 he had\nwhat he said was an ulcer. So he got extra food stamps, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for \u2014 yeah, for \u2014 for butter and stuff. Do you think he shared it with his wife? No. It\nwas all just in front of him. And then he had private patients, and had others, you know,\nlike Medicare. And the private patients always got treated very well. The others kept \u2014\nyou know, I always said, if they have diarrhea, they were told to take Kaopectate, and if\nthey had something other, take three aspirins and go home, you know. I mean, and \u2014 but\nthe private patients \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014I mean, he was just awful. And I\u2019Il tell you, the best thing in my life \u2014 not the best\nthing in my life, but a nice thing in my life, we were occupied \u2014 I mean, you know, we\nwere occupied in March. And we knew it was coming, and you know, there was dead\nsilence for two days. I mean, so silent that you could hear a pin drop everywhere. I mean,\nthere was nothing. And I had gone to work, and he said to me, go to the police\ndepartment and get an armband, a Red Cross armband for me, or something \u2014 which was\non the other side of the river. So I got on my bicycle, and went to the other side of the\nriver, and got to the police department, where people knew me through my brother-in-\nlaw. And they said, what are you doing here? And I said, I need to get the \u2014 well, they\nsaid, you better get home they be \u2014 they\u2019re blowing up the bridges. And so I te \u2014 I\nNovember 21, 2011\nsnatched that thing, and went home, went to his place and threw it there and went home.\nNever went back to his practice. And the house next door to us \u2014 we lived on a cul-de-sac\n\u2014 and the house next door to us had been empty and was immediately occupied by\nAmerican soldiers. I don\u2019t know how they knew it was empty, but there were American\nsoldiers in there right away. And my sister and I were outside, and you know, we both\nspoke English, of course. And we were chatting with some of these kids. And this Jeep\ncomes, and they have my doctor in that Jeep. So he says to me, he fe \u2014 he spoke no\nEnglish. He said to me, you speak English and German? I said yes. And he said, just tell\nthem that I\u2019m a very nice guy, and I, you know, mean no harm. So I just said to them, I\ndon\u2019t know who he is. And they took him. I mean, they let him go right away after 24\nhours \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but, you know, he was wearing his stupid uniform, you know. But I just decided I\u2019m\nnot going to say he\u2019s a nice guy, just that I don\u2019t really know who he 1s.",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t care. You know, after I worked for the military government right away.\nAnd his wife came to see me, maybe after a month or two, and asked me for what \u2014\nwhat\u2019s called \u2014 you may know or not know that expression, Persilschein.",
        "A: Persil is a detergent.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Persilschein is a piece of paper saying you were okay. And it was called Persilschein.\nSo she asked me for one, for him, and I \u2014 I refused. I said, I really can\u2019t give it to you. I\nonly met him after \u2014 when it was so clear the war was over, or was going to be lost, that\nwhoever would have been a Nazi. I said, I can\u2019t give you anything. And I didn\u2019t give him\nany. And her \u2014 both her so \u2014 both their sons died in the war, and when the war was lost,\nshe said to me, the world is coming to an end for my girls \u2014 they had two girls. And I\nsaid, well, that\u2019s your problem. It didn\u2019t have to be that way.",
        "A: But oh, they \u2014 you know, for \u2014 for \u2014 for a while when we lived in Tucson, I wouldn\u2019t\ngo into one supermarket because the guy there looked like \u2014 like this guy. My husband\nkept saying, but you know it\u2019s not him. But he was really awful. And you see, this is the\nkind of thing you run into. And of course, there were a lot of people who didn\u2019t know you\nany more.",
        "A: You know, who used to be your friend, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 just didn\u2019t know you. And believe me, I didn\u2019t know them after the war, either. I\nmean, I\u2019m not that forgiving. And we did have some very good friends, who would\nalways come and no matter what, and they would come and \u2014 and visit, and come for\nNovember 21, 2011\ndinner, or coffee, or whatever. And there were several \u2014 but I know that for some of\nthem, it was risky.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Ri-Right.",
        "A: We felt fear at times that we would be deported someplace. Not always. You know, it\nwould go in waves. There were times when it was very quiet and you felt pretty good.",
        "A: And then \u2014 and then all of a sudden you\u2019d feel they were looking again, and they were\nplanning to do, and it was un \u2014 it was \u2014 now, I will also add that I was young, and when\nyou\u2019re young, you live with this, but you also have boys on your mind.",
        "A: And \u2014 and you know, and you have a life, so to speak. So, there are distractions. It was\nmuch harder on my father, of course. Of course, for him was the second war already, you\nNovember 21, 2011\nknow, he\u2019d been \u2014 he was wounded in the first one, so \u2014 which 1s already dreadful, you\nknow.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely.",
        "A: Well, I couldn\u2019t have stayed.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I mean, that would have been impo \u2014 now, I\u2019Il tell you about my girlfriend, because it\nfalls into the \u2014 now she, who is still alive in Frankfurt [indecipherable] at 91. She\u2019s a\nfull Aryan.",
        "A: But her own mother died when she was five, and her father married a Jew, a fi \u2014 girl\nfrom Frankfurt who was a Jew, who my girlfriend always regarded as her mother,\nbecause she was only six when my \u2014 when her father married this woman. So, for all\npractical purposes, that woman was her mother. However, for the Nazis, it made a big\ndifference, because she had no Jewish blood.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: They lived in an apartment, in a very nice apartment, and they had to leave that\napartment. And they were billeted, so to speak, with another Jewish family in a house,\nwho were awful to them. However, my friend, who was a full Aryan, didn\u2019t have to live\nthere, so she got herself an apartment across the street from where her parents were\nbilleted, and her parents mainly slept over there, and spent the rest of the day \u2014",
        "A: At-\u2014 at their daughter\u2019s apartment. However, the women then had \u2014 was taken to work\nin a factory in Frankfurt. She tried to commit suicide, which didn\u2019t succeed, and then\nshe was deported to Theresienstadt, which of course happened \u2014 would have happened\nto us if we\u2019d been full Jewish. And it would have happened to us if the war had lasted a\nlittle longer. But, she was surprised. She came back, and lived to be 91. But it was not a\npleasant experience, you know.",
        "A: I mean, she was in Theresienstadt a year and a half.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And of course, the transport itself was so horrible. But she was a tough bird, and she\nalways did exercises she told me, even in Theresienstadt, she did her exercises. And she\ncame back.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 oh no, I mean, I think we knew all about concentration camps.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: That \u2014 early on, probably in \u201935, the father of a guy \u2014 well, this were the family in\nFrankfurt, he was taken \u2014 actually, he was not a Jew, but it was sort of a Jewish family.\nAnd he wa \u2014 he was a director of a very big outfit, and I don\u2019t know why they took him.\nThey took him, and they put him in a concentration camp, and after a half a year, they\nwrote his wife and said she could have the urn. So, we knew. Anybody who tells you they\ndidn\u2019t know that there were concentration camps, and what went on, I think is lying.",
        "A: I\u2014 everybody knew. We knew full well what was going on. And \u2014 and you know, and\nthat is something that was always in the back of your mind. You know, it \u2014 it\u2019s a stupid\nthing to say, but in some ways the air raids, and the disruption of everything, is what\nNovember 21, 2011\nsaved us, because there was lit \u2014 the communications weren\u2019t any good any more, and\nyou know, things weren\u2019t going \u2014 if the war had gone better, we would have been a goner\nlong ago. So \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes, I \u2014 the thought has crossed my mind many times, but I \u2014 I just don\u2019t know. He\nnever said so. But he also, even, you know, we always said we are very unfortunate,\nbecause people were trading stuff, you know; you have eggs, you have this, but we only\nhave money, because we are the bank. And nobody wanted money.",
        "A: Yeah, nobody wanted money. But he \u2014 he also had a way with people, you know, that\nhe could remind them of earlier times and all that, which I think, all of which helped. I\nthink the fact that he was a very good person who was an old, old family in Frankfurt, I\nthink helped to some extent. But of course, it wouldn\u2019t have helped in the end. I mean,\nyou know, in the end, nothing helps.",
        "A: And \u2014 and \u2014 and everybody knew what was going on, and I don\u2019t know, you\u2019re not a\nCatholic, are you? You \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m sorry to say, I think your cur-current pope is lying, because you current\npope claims he was forced to join the Hitler youth, and I have never heard of anybody\nwho was forced to do that. I mean, maybe there was peer pressure.",
        "A: That I don\u2019t believe.",
        "A: But that\u2019s not forced. The guy is a liar. But, you know, that\u2019s the way that goes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, that is always the question. I'll tell you, in \u2014 I was talking earlier about my\npublic school, and the fact that there were about six or seven of us who were not \u2014 who\nhad to appear on Saturdays. Well, of course, there were only three of us who had some\nJewish connection. The other five or so had chosen not to join the BDM. So \u2014",
        "A: Bund Deutscher Machen(ph).",
        "A: Yeah.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: It\u2019s the same as the Hitler youth for boys.",
        "A: And \u2014 and they had chosen not to join, so obviously you didn\u2019t have to join. But, you\nknow, I\u2019m sure there was peer pressure.",
        "A: But forcing was not true.",
        "A: But abso \u2014 I get mad every time I read this. But, you know \u2014",
        "A: He was probably a Nazi, and why not, you know? He was from Bavaria, where they\nwere all Nazis anyway.",
        "A: Well, the scope, of course we found out, I\u2019m sure, when we started getting American\nnews, and stuff like \u2014 you know, I worked for the military government, so already I knew\na lot of stuff. But, you know, we knew there was Auschwitz, we knew that \u2014 I mean, I\nknew my girlfriend and her mother, I knew she\u2019d gone to Theresienstadt, you know, so\nthere wasn\u2019t any secret about this. And I knew people who had been deported to\nAuschwitz. So, you know, I can understand, perhaps, that there were people who had no\nNovember 21, 2011\nconnection with Jews, that they didn\u2019t know. You know, they maybe knew there was\nsomething going on, you know, but they weren\u2019t really sure. But, you know, I know \u2014\nmust have been 1934 \u2014 I was just telling the kids about this \u2014 my \u2014 it was an Easter\nvacation. We took a \u2014 a trip to Unterfranken, you know, where Nuremberg is, and\nplace like that. And the first place we started \u2014 we went to, there was a sign about this wi\n\u2014 big at the entrance to the town. Juden sind hier unavinst(ph).",
        "A: Yeah, and my mother was in the car, and so we turned around, and we did not go to\nUnterfranken, we went someplace else, we went to the Lake Constance instead, which\nwas not in Bavaria. So, you know, people just \u2014 just knew. But you know, there was\nalways anti-Semitism, and there always will be anti-Semitism, there\u2019s no question in my\nmind. I me \u2014",
        "A: Why?",
        "A: Well, Jews have always been persecuted. I think part of it 1s that many of them are\nvery successful, which people never like. And \u2014 you know, and they have tended to be \u2014\nwell, they were moneychangers because that was the only pir \u2014 trade they were allowed\nto be. And so they have their hand in the till. And people didn\u2019t like that. You know, all\nNovember 21, 2011\nyou need to do is read Shakespeare, and they were always wandering everywhere. I\nmean, you look at the entire history of Jews, they were enslaved, and they were evicted.\nThe \u2014 and they were in Germany for a while treated very well, then they became not\ntreated well, they were all put in the ghetto, then that went. So th \u2014 and this went o \u2014 there\nwill always be people who \u2014 who are anti-Semitic, and there are today. And you know, I\nknow, when I was living with my mother in England, I had this \u2014 I knew all these girls\nfrom the friend \u2014 from the school in Switzerland. And this one girl asked me frequently\nto \u2014 for a weekend to her house. And she said, we\u2019ll go and play Bridge with these old\nladies. So, we went. And of course, nobody knew who I was. And this one lady said,\nwell, you know, we\u2019re taking in so many Jews. I don\u2019t really like them. I didn\u2019t say\nanything. I mean, what can you say? But you know, that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: And \u2014 and that is true in the entire world, and \u2014 and it will always be that way. And\nyou know, and it \u2014 first of all, people always have to have somebody they can hate. You\nknow, if it\u2019s not the Jews here, it was the blacks for a long time. That\u2019s gotten a little\nbetter, but anythi \u2014 I mean, you know \u2014 fortunately the Holocaust Museum has made no\nbones about the fact that America was not very good during the war, and didn\u2019t take in\ntoo many Jews, and all of that, you know. I \u2014 I was very pleased to see that; it \u2014 it\u2019s a\ngood exhibit. I\u2019ve been through twice. But it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019Il always be that way.

        "A: Oh yeah, I me \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I mean, she had nothing against them in general, she just felt,\ndon\u2019t buy trouble.",
        "A: Yeah.",

And, you know, it\u2019s the country\nwhere I was born, and where I\u2019m from. And you know, it was a horrible time, but it\u2019s\ngone. And I\u2014I would not put it past any country to experience things like that. I mean,\nNovember 21, 2011\nyou know, fortunately, this country is so big, that it\u2019s almost impossible to have anything\nlike that happen. But think about Huey Long and Louisiana, which wasn\u2019t a sterling\nexperience. And you know, think about Selma, Alabama. There are many things in this\ncountry that happened, and it can ha \u2014 I mean, it goo \u2014 okay, it didn\u2019t happen with the\nJews, but it certainly happened with the blacks. And now there is much resentment\nagainst Latinos.",

But you know, basically, it\u2019s where I\u2019m from, and I don\u2019t\nsee any reason to give that up. I mean, you can look around here.",
        "A: You know, it \u2014 there\u2019s Frankfurt, everywhere is Frankfurt. And you know, it\u2019s my\nhometown. So, you know, it was a horrible 12 - 13 years, but it\u2019s gone. And you know,\nokay, my family is \u2014 is scattered, and my life is different, and I did not get to study\nmedicine, which is what I really wanted. I did get a degree in bacteriology from the\nUniversity of Arizona. But here I\u2019ve dealt in so \u2014 planning and so on, and \u2014 so, you\nknow, your life takes a different \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 route, at times, and I don\u2019t regret any of it. I mean, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get to be an\nM.D., that\u2019s what I would have liked, but you know, it\u2019s gone.",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you; that\u2019s what my nephew claims. My husband was very into the \u2014 I\nwish you could have interviewed him, but he\u2019s been dead 40 years, so it\u2019s a long time.",
        "A: He came to this country at the very last minute.",
        "A: August 7\u00b039.",
        "A: Yes. I think he was on that Bremen that I didn\u2019t get onto. Now, he \u2014 it ba \u2014 it\u2019s very\ninteresting, his mother died when he was 11. His father was a lawyer in a small town, in\nFlaybish(ph) gemund(ph), and I think his father was incapable of having this \u2014 of doing\nanything with the family, you know, he \u2014 he had these two boys, my husband and his\nolder brother, who was, I think, five years older. And, so when my husband was, I think \u2014\nfirst of all, his father and his mother were in a concentration camp for a week. You know,\nwas one of the \u2014 maybe Kristallnacht, I\u2019m not sure when \u2014 my husband happened to be\nin the hospital having his tonsils out at that point, which is why he was taken. But, in any\ncase, they sent him to Gross-Rosen, which is in Schlesien, where they had a farm for\nNovember 21, 2011\nkids who wanted to emigrate. It was specifically geared to that. And all the kids who\nwent there, did emigrate. Now, my husband was clearly one of the youngest, because in\n1939, he was only 18, and \u2014 and he \u2014 and they sent him there, I think, when he was 16, or\nsomething like that. So he learned this farming, which is not what he really liked, but it\nwas the only way to get here. And then he did get a visa. Now, there was a \u2014 and I don\u2019t\nknow how much you know about this: there was a family in Richmond, the\nTarnheimers(ph), which had a big department store. And they had a farm near\nRichmond, which was called Hyde(ph) Farmland, which they established precisely for\nthese kids. And that\u2019s where my husband \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 got a visa for.",
        "A: So he came \u2014 his brother was already in New York, but he came at the very last\nminute, in 1939, and went to that farm, Hyde(ph) Farmland, which, unfortunately was\nrun only by those kids, who didn\u2019t really know much about farming, and it went \u2014 well,\nabout eight months after my husband got there. And at that point, of course, there were\nall these kids, you know.",
        "A: Well, the Quakers in Philadelphia came through, and my husband went to\nPhiladelphia and was housed with some Quaker family, I don\u2019t know who they were, on\nNovember 21, 2011\nthe Main Line. And he drove a milk truck. As he always told me, the tips he got, he used\nto buy a radio. And so he drove a milk truck for a while, a year or so, and then he got a\njob with a woman called Mrs. Summerall(ph), who had a nursery in Media,\nPennsylvania. And he also \u2014 she had a room where he could sleep. And she really loved\nhim. And she said \u2014 she said to me later too, I always said to him, if your hands were as\ngood as your mind, then you would make a good [indecipherable] but your hands are not\nas good \u2014",
        "A: Right. And he \u2014",
        "A: And \u2014 but she kept him, and even though he wasn\u2019t really very good. I mean, it was\njust not him to \u2014 to be working the earth. But he saved enough money to go to Penn\nState, of ill repute. Well, my \u2014 Steven\u2019s son just graduated from Penn State last year.",
        "A: Right.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: So anyway, he saved enough money to go to Penn State, and he had thought he had\nsaved enough money for four years, but he didn\u2019t realize that as a non-citizen, he had to\npay out-of-state tuition. So the money lasted for a year.",
        "A: And, of course, it was a working \u2014 stuff. I mean, he worked in the, I don\u2019t know,\ncafeteria or something. But fortunately, by now it was the end \u2014 early \u201942, and he got\ndrafted. And one thing I have never understood in this country lately, is when he was\ndrafted, they naturalized him. They naturalized all the boys right away. Now how we can\nhave all these kids now in the military who are not citizens?",
        "A: I just don\u2019t understand.",
        "A: I mean, I just don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t naturalize those kids, who are good\nenough to serve in the military.",
        "A: Yeah, so I don\u2019t \u2014 I \u2014 that I don\u2019t understand, because I know that my husband was\nnaturalized, I \u2014 I can\u2019t remember what the \u2014 it was in New Jersey in some fort, whatever\nthe name of it is. So anyway, he was \u2014 he was naturalized, and then they sent him to\nChampagne, to learn more German. But he \u2014 he was assigned to some infantry and then\nto the military government, was all, you know. Anyway, it wasn\u2019t the Battle of the Bulge.\nNovember 21, 2011\nBut I think \u2014 you know, it was very interesting that he was able to have this experience in\nGross-Rosen, which he hated, but you know, nevertheless, it gave him the chance to\ncome here.",
        "A: And I was told that somebody had made an exhibit of this Gross-Rosen \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 experience, which was exhibited at Rutgers University, and I always thought the\nHolocaust Museum should get it.",
        "A: My \u2014 my daughter Marli(ph) knows who the guy is.",
        "A: Because whe-when the \u2014 my nephew in New York, my brother-in-law\u2019s son, he saw\nthe exhibit at Rutgers.",
        "A: And he wrote us, or called us and said, you know, I saw a picture of my husband in\nGross-Rosen. I have those pictures. And \u2014 and then my daughter got in touch with the\nguy who \u2014 who has that \u2014 put that exhibit together, and then it was somewhere in New\nJersey, more towards the coast, I don\u2019t know where. And we were gonna go and see it,\nand then there was snow and we couldn\u2019t go and see it, but in any case, I don\u2019t know\nwhere it is now. But, you know, it\u2019s an interesting thing, because that was established \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 and a lot of the kids, I think, went to South America from there.",
        "A: But quite a few came here.",
        "A: Yes. He \u2014 he was sent to \u2014 I don\u2019t know, hi \u2014 first to England, I think, and then he\ncame over, he was \u2014 he was in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge, but, you know, he\nwas not fighting, he \u2014 he was just there, and \u2014 and he said it was very unpleasant. I\u2019m\nsure it was. And then he \u2014 then he wa \u2014 actually, I met him when he was discharged,\nbecause, you know, a lot of G.I_s took a discharge in Europe and then took a contract\nwith what was then called the war department. And he had a contract with the war\ndepartment to work at the military government in denazification, and I happened to be in\nthat department.",
        "A: And he took my desk, and I didn\u2019t like it. But, you know, that\u2019s an old story.",
        "A: That \u2014 that \u2014 that\u2019s all we needed, this guy here.",
        "A: Yes, they do.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: Yeah, they do \u2014 they do know. We met at the military government.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s such a \u2014",
        "A: I think \u2014",
        "A: Well, it was interesting to work at the military government, you know. I\u2019ve worked\nfirst [indecipherable] I worked first in a different department. When we were first hired\n\u2014I mean, was right away. I mean, as I told you, my father \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 was there, and I said, let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t \u2014 if I can\u2019t get there, because I wasn\u2019t\ngoing back to that doctor.",
        "A: Right. And so he said yes, yes, yes, they said come and see, and so I was hired right\naway, and with another girl whom I didn\u2019t know, but whom I met. And then, just as the\nwar ended, they fired us all, because they got Belgian girls, who were, of course, allies,\nand so all German girls were fired, and four weeks later they go and hired us back,\nbecause the Belgian girls, they didn\u2019t work out. So, you know, I was home for four weeks\nNovember 21, 2011\nand then they \u2014 they called and said, would I come back, you know. So I went back, and I\nworked first in supply, which was very interesting because the sergeant in supply, his\nname was Valna(ph) Hirschman(ph), and he was from Frankfurt, which he didn\u2019t\nreally want to tell y \u2014 tell you. But he was \u2014 he was a nice guy, I mean, and we \u2014 we\nworked mostly in the warehouse, where they had, you know, staples of supplies, like food\nand stuff, and rats, too. But he was very nice, because every Friday, he gave us a\npackage, a care package to take home. And believe me, the time right after the war was\nthe most difficult one, as far as food and \u2014 and heating goes. I mean, there wasn\u2019t any\nfood, and there was no coal to heat. So it was \u2014 fortunately [indecipherable] the military\ngovernment, and met somebody who had coal, so we were able to get some coal, but it \u2014\nthe food was really very, very short, and I got lunch every day at the military\ngovernment. They had a canteen and they fed all of us. Lot of creamed corn, and \u2014 but\nthat\u2019s okay, I mean \u2014 and Spam. But, you know, when you\u2019re hungry, you\u2019re happy to\neat anything.",
        "A: So I worked there in supply for quite a long time and \u2014 and I also went with this one\nsergeant; he had to inspect all the boats on the Main river. So we went \u2014 I \u2014 I always\nremember, we had a very nice trip, he was a nice guy, I really enjoyed him. And once we\nwent someplace to inspect the boat, and we came to a military sentry or something, and\nNovember 21, 2011\nhe said, she\u2019s my interpreter. And they said, and if they were Jesus Christ you couldn\u2019t\nget \u2014 you couldn\u2019t take her in. It was some secret stuff, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 so we had to go someplace else. And then, after that I was transferred to the\ndenazification.",
        "A: At \u2014 the same thing \u2014 in the same building, but 1t was different department. And I\nworked for a Captain Morrison, who gave me a very good reference, that I was very\ngood in shor \u2014 good in shorthand, and I never ha \u2014 knew shorthand, but that\u2019s all right, I\nhad a good memory.",
        "A: And then Morrison left and my husband came.",
        "A: It was mainly translation.",
        "A: Translation of documents, and \u2014 no, not interviews, I didn\u2019t do any interviews. It was\nmainly documents and \u2014 and writing letters, and you know, secretarial stuff type \u2014 thing.\nSo, it was \u2014 I can\u2019t remember why I didn\u2019t apply, but \u2014\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: It was a very good place to be. It was a very good pla \u2014 and I met \u2014 met a lot of G.Ls,\nand I had a very good time, is all I can say. But, you know, it was enjoyable. And it was\nlike we \u2014 it was the first time I heard a lot of amer \u2014 new American music, which I didn\u2019t\nknow, you know, never heard of Glenn Miller before, but then all of a sudden, all that\ncame back. That was nice.",
        "A: And I left in \u00b047.",
        "A: I came here in \u00b047.",
        "A: No. I came here in \u201947 on a visa. My mother gave me the affidavit, of course.",
        "A: And I came here ostensibly to go live with my mother, but I knew I was getting\nmarried, so \u2014 my husband was \u2014 his contract was \u2014 I came the first of May, and his\ncontract wasn\u2019t up til July. So he came later, and I'll tell you, I \u2014 I left Frankfurt on the\nfirst of May and flew directly to two \u2014 I mean, I spent one night in New York, and then\nwent on to Tucson in a fur coat, and it was a hundred and five.",
        "A: And I \u2014 and I didn\u2019t think I was gonna live through that summer.\nNovember 21, 2011",
        "A: But I si\u2014 we stayed there seven years.",
        "A: Actually I \u2014I really loved Arizona.",
        "A: And then we lived in California for six years, and I would never go back to\nCalifornia. But I loved \u2014 I really liked Arizona. It grows on you, you know, and so I\nreally enjoyed it. But you know, I \u2014 we stayed there because he went to law school there,\nSO \u2014",
        "A: Well, it was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was fine, and if my kids ever want to hear this \u2014",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: I hope so \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but you never know.",
