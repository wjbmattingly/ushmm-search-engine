And but they were not religious.\nMy mother only went to church if she liked the minister\u2019s sermons. You know there was one\nwhen she went to the Kaiser Wilhelm gedeshne [ph] in Berlin. And then one time there was\nsomebody, the preacher, she thought she liked the sermons so then she went. But not out of any\nother conviction.

        "A: Yeah. I knew that only. In the beginning I didn\u2019t, no. I had no idea. I remember that when I\nwas in elementary school we had religious -- we went in my first year, we had religious\neducation in school. And usually the regular teacher gave the Lutheran and I had a girlfriend.\nOne of my classmates was Rosalyn, was Catholic. And she always wanted to leave and I said\nyou can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m not going home alone. You have to stay and then there were two people,\ntwo of mine and they were Jewish. And then Hannah came in and she said there were the Ten\nCommandments. Only. And she said oh you have the same Ten Commandments as we do. And\nI said, yes, why not. So I was really not aware of the difference. I thought you know that was\nsomewhere, people said they are different, but I didn\u2019t know why they said they were different\nyou know. But Frankfurt an der Oder had a very small Jewish community. And they are now\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\non the bridge, you know where you have the bridge Frankfurt an der Oder is written on it.\nThey don\u2019t have anybody and we knew them all.

        "A: Yeah I was the second. My sister is older so I always was up to her age.",
        "Q: And her name?",
        "A: Her name is Brigitta. And so my sister went to school for example, she was two classes\nabove me and so I was, we had seats. And in the middle there was a raised part. It was separated\nthe two seats. And there I was sitting. And all the teachers they all knew us. You know proper\nFrankfurt an der Oder only had 60,000 residents. So they knew. So I was sitting there. So one\nday I appeared and I was only four and I appeared at the principal and I said, and he said what do\nyou want. And I said I want to go to school. And he said when were you born? And I told him.\nAnd he said you can\u2019t go to school. You are too young. So I went home crying. Supposedly\ncrying, terrible. And it took my mother two hours to find out why I was crying. So yes, I always\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas, when we went to school they, my parents both came with me and my sister was always very\ngood in this. When my sister, my parents were there and then she went in her class. I knew the\nschool. So when I came, my parents came with me and then they called our names and said class\nA or B or C. So when they called A, my parents looked around, Ursala was gone. There was no\nUrsala around. So they went to class A. There I was sitting. So yeah and then we went was ten,\nwe went into the gymnasium in the high school. And I, no that comes later. But my mother\nwanted to come with me and I said don\u2019t dare to come with me. And she didn\u2019t. So I was, yes, I\nwas very \u2014 and so it hit me in some ways maybe harder than my sister. To be an outcast in the\nend because I also had my whole class were my friends. My sister had a few friends and she was\nstanding in the courtyard, this, at one time alone. And I said what\u2019s the matter with you. All my\nfriends are sick. They have the flu. I said no, try the other ones. No, I can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t push\nmy way between. I said, why not. And so it hit me very hard, probably more than my sister. My\nsister also could do, and so the age you see. Now let me say backtrack. In 36, I was supposed to\ngo to the gymnasium. We went four years to elementary school. And then you could stay in\nelementary school or you could go in something which we called middle school where you were\nuntil you were 16 and then you could go to the gymnasium and you got your abitorium when\nyou were 18. And then you could go to the university. But we went. My school and we were\nseparate, the boys and the girls. So in my school there were 700 girls. And from the 700 girls in\n1936, only ten percent could be either Jewish or half Jewish. So the quota was filled. And so that\nwould have meant that I couldn\u2019t go to the high school. And then one family moved to Berlin.\nSo I could get in. And then in 38, the Jewish kids were kicked out and you know after the\nCrystal Night they couldn\u2019t stay in school. But we half Jews could stay in. And my sister was\nlucky. She had in her class another half Jew. And after she did the abitorium I was the only one\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nso there were 699 kids in uniforms on Hitler\u2019s birthday. And so on I was private. It was awful. It\nwas awful. I can feel how the blacks were feeling in these cases, you know.",

        "Q: We\u2019ll get to that in a minute. Let\u2019s back up a little bit. So you were a young child and you\nwent to school and you had your Jewish and non-Jewish friends. Were you athletic?",

My\nfather, we were really the children of my father in many ways. My father took us both bicycling\nand my father was known in Frankfurt an der Oder with on each side on the arm, he had one of\nhis daughters. And my father really taught us a lot. He was very great. When we went on\nvacation and so at first you know we could go on vacation. He gave us a map when we were\neight and so and said now here we are and there you\u2019re going to be. Now you lead us. And so\non. So when we missed something then we said, Fati, Fati. He said but you are leading us. And\nthen he showed us. Ok that\u2019s where you went wrong so let\u2019s go back and then go where we were.\nMy father was very good. He swam very well and even you know he walked up the mountains\nthis way instead of going this way. And so he was really in good shape too. And I was, yes I was\nvery good in sports and the Hitler sport was a major subject. And one of my goals was to swim\nthe channel between France and England. Sorry I didn\u2019t get to.",
        "Q: Not yet. Well let\u2019s start talking about when things started changing. You were born in 25.\nWhen did you first hear about a man named Hitler?",
        "A: Well one of the things 1s when I went to school, we still said good morning and then our\nteacher (phone ringing). Our teacher somewhere must have told us that we had to say Heil Hitler\nin the morning. But I have no recollection of that. The teacher in, you see in January of 33 she\nmust, she is the one who told us that we had to say Heil Hitler. Now she was not a Nazi. There\nwere lots of \u2014 so but I have no recollection of that, when she ever didn\u2019t make any impression of\nme. The first thing really, we were in Silesia on vacation, my father and my mother and we two\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand this was when, in 34, when they killed so many of, Hitler killed so many you know of the\nLong Knives. And when they announced over the radio my sister and I somewhere knew my\nfather was in danger and we went right and left of him. Like we could protect him, but you\nknow we were small children.",

        "Q: Do you remember talking this over with him or with your mother?",
        "A: No we were really too young to talk this, to talk that over really. I don\u2019t know. It was just I\nguess somewhere I guess my parents must have talked about it or so on. And we maybe have\noverheard some or you know and, and I know that relatives of my father called on him all the\ntime, and you know what to do. And so, so somewhere not many, we couldn\u2019t really put it in\nwords, but some way we were aware of that the, my Jewish relatives were in danger.",
        "Q: Do you remember when you were young hearing Hitler give speeches over the radio?",
        "A: OhI saw him. I saw Hitler too. He, with Hindenburg. That was when Hindenburg was still\nalive.

And my classmates at this point, it was it is a small\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncity. I mean it wasn\u2019t that obvious. And then in high school the teachers some way were afraid. I\nalways was a very good student and I loved to study and then my teachers were afraid to give me\ngood grades because then they were, would maybe say oh you are friendly to the Jews.

So he had a special assignment\nand we knew about that certainly. And we and we knew that I don\u2019t know. We, we you see one\nof the things, in the beginning is we, we all had some way the feeling in Germany the number is\nthe German Jews were in many ways very bad because they were very emancipated. They were\nheld very German. And their religion was Jewish like somebody else\u2019s was Catholic or so on.\nSo many of them thought they couldn\u2019t believe that the Germans would go along with it.

And then we had a house in Frankfurt an der Oder which was in the name of my\nhusband, or of my father.

        "Q: You did know?",

        "Q: Did you know what Mauthausen was at that point?",
        "A: At this point it was very unusual that they took Fati to Mauthausen which is outside of Linz\nin Austria, because you know usually all of these people went to Auschwitz or to any of the\nBirkenau or any of the eastern ones. And so that they took Fati to Mauthausen was somewhat\nunusual. There were more the Austrian Jews and the Dutch Jews and you know but not really\nthe German Jews. But we knew that we would \u2014",

        "A: The other, all the Jews were taken away before there were, after 38 there were all you know\nmy sister and I went into the city of Frankfurt and there they were with their luggage and so on\nand they went to one of the schools and where they were assembled you see the Gestapo always\nsend, usually to the Judenrat, the papers where the people knew what to take and what they\ncouldn\u2019t take and where to go and what time. And so we saw them and we knew where they go.\nAnd then we went to that school my sister and I. And people say well you shouldn\u2019t come and\nwe said yes we do have to come. So we knew about that, and they went all to Russia in the\nghetto. And so my father was the only Jew left in Frankfurt an der Oder. And my father was\naccompanied by policemen, regular police, German police.",
        "Q: To what do you attribute the fact that your father was the only one left?",
        "A: Because he had a Christian wife. I think.",
        "Q: Though he himself was 100% Jewish.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But the fact that he had the Christian wife?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I think that was, so he was and he was the only one left. There was nobody else\nthere. There was another Jewish man but his wife divorced him and he was taken before.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: When you father was the only one left, did he become depressed or did he still keep \u2014",
        "A: Well when you see my pictures of my father, 32. My father had blue eyes but he had very\nsparkling eyes and then 33 he had sparkle all was gone. And he aged. He looked like an old man.",
        "Q: Once Hitler got into power?",
        "A: So my father in, and my father tried to, to go out but you know it was very difficult because\nhe was you know the Americans didn\u2019t let anybody in and his relatives you know tried to get him\nout but he couldn\u2019t get in. So my father more or less knew that he was doomed.",
        "Q: Your father is taken away and it\u2019s your mother and you two girls.",
        "A: And then there was my father, my mother out of the house. She left the house. The Gestapo\nsaid you have to go and mommy went.",
        "Q: With you girls.",
        "A: Which was two girls and then we rented, we rented some rooms. With other people.",
        "Q: How did your mother support you all?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Then my mother worked. You see my mother had really studied music and never really\nworked, so then she, there was a lawyer and a tax lawyer. My mother worked 1n the office then\nand put you know stuffed envelopes and all this kind of things. And then my mother\u2019s mother\nhelped us financially.",
        "Q: And you at that point were still in school or \u2014",
        "A: No I was kicked out in October of 42.",
        "Q: You are almost 17 so what does that does that do to a 17 year old girl to be told that?",
        "A: My sister and I left in 42. We got the papers in 42. To go to you know that we should go. We\nshould go to a factory in Briesen, which was between, a city between Berlin and Frankfurt an\nder Oder and we should go there to a factory.",
        "Q: To work.",
        "A: And so my sister and I decided we are not going to go. And so we took a train to Berlin at\nnight.",
        "Q: That\u2019s very unusual. And what was your mother\u2019s role in that?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well my mother stayed in Frankfurt an der Oder and the Gestapo called her in and said where\nare your girls. And mommy said they left me. I have no idea.",
        "Q: Was it her idea for you girls to leave?",
        "A: No, I think it was the consent of all of us that we don\u2019t go because, and that Briesen factory\nwent to the Warsaw ghetto. So we, so then we were in Berlin, just the two of us, my sister and I.",
        "Q: How did you get there?",
        "A: By train.",
        "Q: Did you have papers? ID papers?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Yeah we had a kin karte, sure.",
        "Q: Saying that you were a mischling?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. anything there showing that you had Jewish \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: No, no. That didn\u2019t say anything. But so then we went to Berlin and we stayed with friends\nand we stayed at a pension and I went to a Carmelite convent to help with children and my sister\nworked and so on. And a relative from my mother\u2019s side who was a religious nut but a Christian\nreligious nut, but he was not a Nazi. And he hired her and she worked in his office. He was a tax\nlawyer. And she worked there and I helped the nuns with the children.",
        "Q: Did you live in the convent itself?",
        "A: Partly I lived at the convent, but then my mother came to Berlin and we lived in again in\nfurnished rooms. And then the bombs started to fall. And in some ways the bombs were a little\nbit a mixed, because you see you always had to register in Germany. At the police station when\nyou moved. All the Germans had to do that. And so then so many of them were destroyed so it\nwas a little bit easier to evade them. And \u2014",
        "Q: But once your father was taken away, did you have any contact with him?",
        "A: No, he was in Mauthausen.",
        "Q: Right, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Once he said goodbye there was no more contact.",
        "A: No we got, my mother got a letter from Mauthausen that my father was killed while he tried\nto escape. All the concentration camps had certain deaths. In one had heart attacks and in one\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthey had something else. In Mauthausen, they all tried to escape. It\u2019s all in, did you ever read the\nSS State by Colvin.",
        "Q: When was that, when did your mother get that letter?",
        "A: In 42.",
        "Q: Oh so it was soon after he left?",
        "A: Yeah and so and then there \u2014",
        "Q: How did she present that to you girls?",
        "A: Well she showed us the letter.",
        "Q: Was she very emotional?",
        "A: Well in some ways yes, in some ways not. In somewhere, we some way knew that Fati\nwould not come back. In some ways. On the other hand is we didn\u2019t trust anything. So 45, we\ndidn\u2019t dare to move anywhere far away from Frankfurt an der Oder because we thought maybe,\nmaybe he comes back.",
        "Q: There\u2019s always that hope.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: And so but on the other hand is then my sister and I were running for our lives and then the\nbombs came.",
        "Q: Did you go into shelters?",
        "A: Yeah sure we sit in the basement in the shelters and so when the bombs came and you know\nthe rations and then you know we heard the Russian cannons from around Christmas 44 and they\ndidn\u2019t\u2019 march into Berlin until April 45. We heard all the time the cannons. So in some ways you\nknow we all moved somewhere like dolls you know. You pull a leg and you move. You pull the\nother one and you move. And you just keep you are somewhere dull to pain. You know there is\nso much that you just say you can\u2019t anymore. And in 45 there really, Hitler tried to kill all the\nhalf Jews and all the Jews and all the people in the concentration camp so that nobody could say\nanything against him and soon. In April 45 the few people I knew, I still had contact to, I wrote\nfarewell letters. And I said Iam going to go. I am not going to run anymore. I just can\u2019t anymore\nand somewhere I never said yes again to life. I can you know that people get you know like when\nI moved out of my house, I said sure I can go. I can\u2019t get it\u2019s, it\u2019s very, very difficult. I try, also\nhave trouble getting people too close to me you know. It\u2019s so on. But you know you it was, on\nthe other hand you see where others are divided. You know when the bombs start falling and the\nhigh, the apartment houses in Berlin, they are burning and then the Germans were sitting in front\nwith just a little bit belongings. You felt sorry for them. They were human beings. So you were\nso divided. On the one hand is I hope that more bombs are falling and more get destroyed\nbecause then I may be surviving. On the other hand is you know you felt sorry. And, and some of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe people you know like my best friend from high school. She, my mommy\u2019s mother lived in\nFrankfurt an der Oder and she went to Frankfurt, to my grandmother and she said where is\nUrsala and my grandmother said I can\u2019t tell you. And she kept on pestering her. So finally my\ngrandmother broke down and told her. She gave her my address and then she rang the bell and\nwe usually didn\u2019t open because mommy always was a very, if a bell rang somebody will take us.\nAnd but there she was. So some of the people you know never abandoned me or my sister. And\nbut it was, but you were somewhere, you thought that either the bombs get you or the Russians\nget you or the Gestapo gets you. Or somewhere the percentage of survivors was very small. Was\nvery small. And then after the war you know, nobody ever thought that we were in shock or\nanything. Nobody helped us anywhere.",
        "Q: Your sister stayed through the end of the war?",
        "A: Oh yeah, we stayed all the time. Yeah, we were together. My sister wanted to run away\nfrom the Russians and we were beating each other. And I said you are crazy to go on the\nhighway. We are going to stay and soI won. We did stay. My biggest fear then were really at\nthis point when we knew it was the end, is that the British bombs. You know they had these\nblock busters. And in the basement when the alarm was. And we were sitting with the Germans.\nNobody accost us, really. They were, the block busters. We were sitting you know my mother\nand my sister and I, we were all sitting together. I think my sister sat in the middle. And mommy\nand I on outside. And said you know these block busters, the people were blue then because\neverything burst. You know they were blue when they were hit, but there was sometimes a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nvacuum. And so when I opened my fear was always that I sat in the vacuum and mommy and\nGitta are dead. That was my greatest fear to the end of 45. Yeah, you know when \u2014",
        "Q: What do you mean people were blue?",
        "A: Because all there the out there, everything burst and you leave the building. This is such a\nstrong pressure from the pressure. The block busters were also from the British. And they hit\nyou know the block buster means that is word blocks and so it was that was one of my fears you\nknow. And in 45 then I knew that the Gestapo wouldn\u2019t get me anymore. Even where govers\n[ph] said to the end 1s there is a relief army and so on which you know. And in front of us we had\nthe, for the tanks, when the tanks would go in the main streets, they would go against it, they\u2019d\nboth blow up. Except the Russian tanks were very small and they went through all the side\nstreets and never hit any of these things. And it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know you know. You were in the, in\nsome ways you were numb but on the other hand is you were not afraid of anything really\nanymore. You know it was so bad that you thought what else. You know one way or another so\nwho cares you know.",
        "Q: Did you know what had happened to Hitler?",
        "A: Well we heard that afterwards, yeah. Yeah, we heard that afterwards. We didn\u2019t even know\nEva Braun existed.",
        "Q: If what?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: If Eva Braun existed. We didn\u2019t even know that she existed. Hitler was such a purist. He was\na vegetarian and he didn\u2019t have girlfriends and he didn\u2019t \u2014 but \u2014",
        "Q: When you were in Berlin, did you meet any other Jews in hiding or did you come across any\nthat you knew of?",
        "A: We knew that there are Jews in, we tried not to find any of them, because you see any time\nyou tried to get in contact with any of them, you endangered them.",
        "Q: So sense, did not make \u2014",
        "A: So you tried not, if you, you some way we were aware there were, at the Jewish cemetery in\nWeisen there were Jews hidden in these old fashioned mausoleums and the gardeners who were\nAryans, they gave them food and everything. But if you tried to any way to do anything, you\nwere afraid to engage of them. And so you know you tried not to do anything like this because\nyou hoped that nobody would find them. And if you found them, somebody else might find\nthem. Or you were also afraid that somebody might follow you and you would lead them to\nsomething. So at this point, we did not really try to find anybody in hiding because you\nendangered the Jews, but you endangered also the people who hid them. You know so you tried\nnot to find out anything about them. You knew somewhere. Well the trouble is there was always\na grapevine so you heard about things. I had contact with some Dutch underground people and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nso I knew about D Day before anybody ever admitted that the English had, that the Americans\nhad landed because that\u2019s underground. Told me that. But you know \u2014",
        "Q: Tell me your connection what the Dutch underground. How did that happen?",
        "A: The Dutch underground. You know Hitler had all these, they just took cars, you know pick-up\ntrucks and drove to the factories and took all the young men in and shipped them to Germany for\nto manage the factories and so on. And the Carmelite nuns you know where I helped them with\nthe kids, until the kids were all really sent out of Berlin. These Dutch underground kids, they\nwere Catholic so they came to the convent in the evening. And they talked, they\u2019re talking.",
        "Q: You yourself never actually worked for the underground organization?",
        "A: No, no I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Did you know if there were any Jewish children hiding in this compound?",
        "A: There were some yes. Yes, we did have Jewish kids hid. We had there was one woman and\nshe couldn\u2019t marry because Jews couldn\u2019t marry. And she converted to Catholicism but she was\nin Auschwitz, she survived. She survived, but her son before, her son was with her in this where\nshe, where they call collect all the Jews before they ship them out. So somewhere she contacted\nthe Catholic church and so the nuns and, they took me with them because they couldn\u2019t go alone\nas just the nuns and I looked so nice and Aryan you know with blond hair and everything. So we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwent to the apartment and there was the Gestapo and it was sealed. And so the Gestapo unsealed\nit and the nuns took out the children\u2019s clothes. And then the little boy stayed in the convent. And\nthen there was another little girl where we don\u2019t know anything about the parents. And who they\njust left 1t on the front doors. One of the problems was, with that, was that the kids itself, and\nthey went with it then. You know, there were very few children left in Berlin, because the\nschools were all closed. Because of the bombs. And so, so any school aged kid was you know I\nmean if they stayed in Berlin, they didn\u2019t have any school, they were all sent to the country. And\nso it was a little bit a problem of with older children. The smaller ones you know you could just\nkeep and you just kept them from you know you had a nun from your own and so on. But the\nmother of the little boy came back. She survived Auschwitz and she talked. And this is one thing\ntoo is that I made a big influence. Those things made big impressions on me too. Is because they\nput her into a hole and they said now if you submit to us you know they wanted to rape her and\nso on. We give you food and she said I\u2019m not hungry. And she always resisted this all.",
        "Q: This is while she was in \u2014",
        "A: In Auschwitz, yeah. And so on. And so I always thought that this really, you should never\ndepend on it. People shouldn\u2019t be able to kid, because they hold this as a carrot. You know, if\nyou go with us, we give you food and we do that and I said I\u2019m never going to be dependent on\nany of that. And so on. But she survived it but she was not a Catholic after all but she collected\nher son.",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t and I don\u2019t remember the little boy\u2019s name either you know and so on. And so\nbut yeah we went in that sealed apartment and the Gestapo were there, two Gestapo men and\nyeah.. and we got the clothing out. And some of them also you know they went, they got people\nout who were, I don\u2019t know who was the father of that kid in any case. But the, you know\nsometimes people went to these assemblies and got people out they knew. And so on. And the\nbad part of this was you know sometimes people went to the assembly and then they were\nhijacking you know some of the people you know, getting them away and hiding them behind\nrows of other people. And so on. But the Germans never called names. They only count\nnumbers. So if there had to be a hundred people there and there were only 98, two were missing.\nThey took anybody around. And regardless who it was. And that was another bad thing about\ngoing and hiding you know. That you always. If you could go in hiding, before you ended up in\nany of the lists, That was fine. But if you were on one of the lists and then you didn\u2019t go, you\nknow you endangered somebody else. But my sister and I didn\u2019t think about that either in\nBriesen I guess. I don\u2019t know somebody else had to go for us. Or not. I don\u2019t know. But they\ntook anybody. The number had to be correct. It was, on the other hand 1s I think technology was\nnot as advanced. So it was a little bit easier to find loopholes you know to find ways of\ndisappearing and some way managing of keeping on living. Because and as I said then, so much\nwas destroyed. Papers were destroyed too.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n(Tape 2 \u2014 RG-50.106.0184.02.03; duration: 58:32)\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Ursala Guttstadt McKinney. This is track number two and\nwe were talking about the end of the war. Mother coming back from Auschwitz. Any other\nmemories of that particular time that you can talk about.\nUrsala Guttstadt McKinney: Yeah so people came back you know. You never knew and you\nnever trusted anyone but we got the death certificate from Fati and you see my father was a civil\nservant. He worked for the Reichsbahn which is the now Bundesbahn which would be the\nfederal you know railroad system. And then when my father, when they kicked him out in 36,\nthey gave him a special assignment. And then in 38 suddenly everything was over. And so they\npaid the pension for my father. Only we never got it. The Gestapo collected it. Because the\nGerman railroad, they thought we cannot, we have no reason not to give it, to send it. We have to\nhave a disciplinary thing if he were murdered somebody or something you know. So they paid it\nand the Gestapo collected it.",
        "Q: You had said you were hoping even in 45 that your father would come? Did you go looking\nfor him?",
        "A: No, we couldn\u2019t, no we didn\u2019t look for him but my mother walked, my mother walked to\nFrankfurt an der Oder. She didn\u2019t dare to take Brigitta and me with her because we, this was all\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\noccupied by Russians. And she walked because there was no train or nothing. And she walked to\nFrankfurt an der Oder and looked if our house was still there.",
        "Q: That\u2019s about what, 60 miles or something?",
        "A: Unh hunh. And then she went to whatever government there were, the city of Frankfurt an der\nOder and so they knew very well that she was there, that she was alive and she was there and\nthey had her address. And my mother for a while administered the house.",
        "Q: She stayed in it?",
        "A: No, no, no she stayed in Berlin, because then after 45 my mother got us an apartment. But she\nwas the one who collected the rent for a while and was responsible for it. But then she gave it up.\nIt was too, you know too difficult with the east and so on. But the city of Frankfurt an der Oder,\nafter you know this is called Grumpuff [ph] in German. It\u2019s a registry for all the properties and\nthere was a first Richard Guttstadt. Then it was crossed out. Then it was Richard Israel\nGuttstadt. That was crossed out. Then there was a short rise (?) and then this was crossed out in\n45 and it became property of the city of Frankfurt an der Oder. And the person who rented then\nour house was a physician from Silesia. And he had his practice on the first floor and lived on the\nsecond floor. And so it was in very good condition because as a physician he also got electrical\nrepairs and all of that. So it was you know maintained very well. And then he died in the house.\nSomewhere in the 60s. And then a family came who rented it and they wanted to buy it. And\nthey asked the city of Frankfurt an der Oder and said look it is Western property. You know\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nWest German people who had escaped. They didn\u2019t know that it was Jewish property. They had\nescaped so and so we want to buy it. And the city of Frankfurt an der Oder said sorry. It\u2019s not for\nsale and it\u2019s not Western property. So that was our salvation. So my sister and I bought the\nhouse back. My sister got a lawyer. Through friends. And he only took 15%. Much less than the\nother outfits that. And \u2014",
        "Q: What year was that, that you got the house back?",
        "A: After the wall fell. You know after the wall fell because and then he because then we had all\nthe papers. My mother had always a little suitcase during the war where the papers of the house\nwere in. The death certificate of my father and all that. And she carried that wherever she went.\nAnd then when my mother died in 81 I had had it. So we had all the papers and then the city you\nknow had my father\u2019s name and everything. So and we sold it to the people who wanted to buy\nit. But we didn\u2019t have all these difficulties because you see the, and for god\u2019s sake Frankfurt was\nreally destroyed too. But the registry was intact. You know because if this would all have been\ngone, then you know would have been very difficult but this was all there and you know you\ncould trace it. And so my sister and I bought the house back and then we sold it. My sister\nwanted to move back in and I said no deal. And so on. So we didn\u2019t, but we got it back, yes, and\nwe sold it to the people who had it. But, so my mother really when she went in 45 and she\nwalked to Frankfurt an der Oder, she wanted to make sure that the house is still there and she\nwanted to make sure that they know where she is. So if Fati would come, he would find us.",
        "Q: When did you finally realize that he was not going to come back?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Pretty soon. Pretty soon. Yeah.",
        "Q: You stayed in Berlin with your sister and your mother? What did you do then? When the war\nwas over.",
        "A: Yes. When the war was over, I tried to get abitorium which was awful and I went to a school\nwhich was, we were all Jewish or half Jewish kids who wanted to finish high school. And any\ntime there was exam, we all blanked out. It was awful. We just couldn\u2019t function. And nobody\never thought that we need any help. You know one person one time said to me you know you\nare like somebody who walks around the corridor and sees an open door and runs in, in this open\ndoor and says oh no I don\u2019t want to be here. And then she keeps on running. Next open door.\nAnd you know but it never occurred to them that I really, number one I didn\u2019t know what I\nwanted to do. I never know what. You know I mean it\u2019s what, ok, the war was over. They said\nok, fine. It\u2019s over. Now you start your life again. What, how, how, how. You know so.",
        "Q: Did you talk about your experiences with the other students? Did you all exchange \u2014",
        "A: No, nobody ever talked. We didn\u2019t talk.",
        "Q: Stories \u2014",
        "A: No we didn\u2019t talk. They didn\u2019t talk.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Cause you all know.",
        "A: We all know. I mean sometimes one said something and you realized you know they were in\nhiding and, and so on. Most of them were kids who had been in hiding. And so on. But no, we\njust we just blanked out. My sister was a little bit more lucky. She had her abitorium, so she\ncould go to the university. But I had, it was very difficult to get back to a normal life. And it kept\non you know it\u2019s -- And you felt some way you know then you felt maybe more outcast than\nbefore. Because before you were so busy trying to survive all that that you couldn\u2019t even think\nabout anything. And, and then suddenly life was supposed to be more normal again and as I\nsaid, my mother got us an apartment. And then but then you were in danger again you know\nbecause I couldn\u2019t, my sister registered with the IRO, the International Relief Organization and\nshe came over with a coal boat. You know one of those boats which brought coal over and went\nback empty. But I was, she was then had a temporary visa for West Berlin, because in 48 they\nopened the Free University in West Berlin and my sister was in the, eastern Germany had only\none university, Berlin, the Humburt [ph] University which was in East Berlin and so she could\ngo to West Berlin. And she got a temporary visa. And just she registered and could get out. But\nI was in East Berlin and any time you registered with the IRO and were in East Berlin, the\nRussians would arrest you as a spy. So you couldn\u2019t do that. So --",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back a little bit. When you said the coal boat, the boat going from \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Oh there were the boats, after the war which came from America where had coal in and so on.\nThey brought it to West Germany for the people. I guess it was part of the Marshall plan. And\nthen they went empty back. They had the refugees on going back.",
        "Q: I see, so she went \u2014",
        "A: She went at first to the Freer University, Free University in West Berlin. And she studied\nthere. And then came, and her major was history. And there came a professor from United States\nwho was a German Jewish immigrant originally but he was in the meantime an American citizen,\nand a professor of history. And he talked to my sister and he said, I get you a scholarship to \u2014",
        "Q: American college.",
        "A: Yeah, so he did. So she went to Sweetbriar.",
        "Q: So she was able to get out and she came to the United States.",
        "A: And she had no sponsor. My sister had a sponsor the World churches were her sponsor. So\nIRO got her a sponsor which that was very impersonal.",
        "Q: And this was in 48.",
        "A: No that, my sister, no. That was for really, between 49 and 50 that the IRO.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: And you said goodbye",
        "A: Oh yeah. I said goodbye to the, when my Jewish relatives went to the concentration camp. I\nwent and said goodbye. We always knew I had all my aunts. I, when they had the papers. I know\nwhen they are going and I went there and I said goodbye and I always knew I wouldn\u2019t see them\nagain.",
        "Q: How do you say goodbye in a situation like that?",
        "A: Well it was very, it was very difficult because one of my aunts said to me you know I am\ngoing to go to the concentration camp because I am Jewish. I don\u2019t know why I go there, because\nI don\u2019t believe in anything. I never go to the synagogue or anything. But I am Jewish. And I felt\nso bad for her. Because I thought if she would believe in it and during, in the camps the\northodox Jews were of the best because they had the faith to set against that horror. But people\nlike her and they died off very fast because they had nothing to set against it. And I said to so\nmany of them, I said goodbye. You always knew when they went. We had a young, one of my,\none of the cousins and they had gotten (phone ringing) a baby, that. I can take it off the hook.\nThere were they all knew that they go to concentration camp. But they couldn\u2019t, they-- and\nmany of my relatives were really in Poland. You know Poland was partly German. Partly\nAustrian and partly Russian. And after the war Poland was united again. And my relatives lived\nin the German, many of them in the German part which was then Poland. After World War I,\nthey could either opt for Poland or for Germany. And they opted for Germany. And then they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwere shipped back. And but they some way we all knew that and they knew about, they didn\u2019t\nthink that they\u2019re going to labor camp or anything like that. They all knew that at least, my\nrelatives all knew that was the end. Yeah, and that young family you know who had that little\nboy Berl, and he was supposed to be born in the United States, except they didn\u2019t get in. So he\nwent.",
        "Q: You said that you had known even in 42 about the camps.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: When did you learn the real extent of the camps?",
        "A: Oh knew of this. I guess we knew about the camp. My father knew about the camp and he\ntold us about it. And I had but I, the extent of the -- I guess we only learned really of, after the\nwar, that you know how many \u2014 but we knew that they had chambers that they all, that they died\nand so on. And we knew that the, the people you know didn\u2019t, didn\u2019t have the chance to come\nback. Except very few. Some way there was a grapevines, you know and there were always\nsome people who got news out of it. You know like this one train which went into you know in\nAuschwitz, when you know they at one time Sweden\u2019s Red Cross came in and they said we\nwould, you know they put linen on the beds and everything you know to make it look good. And\nthen they said there will be a train going to Switzerland the next morning. And hardly anybody\nwent because they all, nobody believed it. But one of the Frankfurt an der Oder Jews did and it\nwent. The Germans in some ways sometimes you had a chance. And that train went almost\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nempty. Because people were afraid. They said that\u2019s a trap. And but then these people talk. So\nyou heard things and so you knew. I mean we didn\u2019t know how many camps were there. I mean\nthe number of camps and this we didn\u2019t know. And we didn\u2019t know the extent of you know how\nmany people really were, I mean we -- how many the capacity was of this. But you know there is\na place where you know there were some certain places already within Germany where they tried\nout some of these things on the mentally retarded. And so then the medical professions\nsomewhere heard about it and it went so on. So I think something to that extent, 1t was very\ndifficult to keep it completely secret. I never quite understand how people can say they never\nknew about it. I mean didn\u2019t they see the cars coming in and didn\u2019t they smell all this and so on\nyou know. The trouble is that Hitler got in power. Then the depression was and people were out\nof work. And he promised them work and he built a factory, he prepared for the war. He built\nthe Autobahn and all this. And people had money, suddenly had money. And by the time they\nrealized political wasn\u2019t everything that great, they were trapped. That\u2019s one reason I am\nsomewhat afraid for this country here. How it goes, how Beck can get so many people to come\nto his things. But so it was a bad time. And then there were so many people who really didn\u2019t\nknow any Jews. So when Hitler, when they talked about them, the -- some people believe\nanything which is written black and white. So it\u2019s very difficult and I mean there was a curfew\nafter the 20 of July when they tried to kill Hitler, Stauffenberg and these people. There was a\ncurfew. You know you could see there where before when the Jewish still before they were all\nmore or less dispersed. There were signs on parks, no Jews allowed. And so also it was very\nobvious. And people can read. All the Germans could read. There were no people who couldn\u2019t\nread. But I guess many of them, and some of the people were very daring and nothing happened\nto them. We had a high school teacher who taught us math and physics and so on. And he was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\none of these golden Papi members. You know people who joined before 33. They had a golden\nrim around, they are a party member. Party thing. And this was a real join. And they are\nenthusiastic about it. And then he sent in 38 or 39 or something around there, he sent his\nmembership back. And he said that\u2019s not the party I joined. He always kept on teaching.\nNothing happened to him, absolutely nothing. So some people, it was, they were always some,\nsome people had a loop hole or something. They went through. The majority of my high school\nteachers were not party members. But I guess I didn\u2019t have enough teachers for them to kill\nthem. It\u2019s, I mean they, when they kicked me out of school and I worked, I was walking the\nstreet in Frankfurt an der Oder, one of my former classmates which was really hundred, 300\npercent Nazi. And so was her whole family. She stopped me in the street and she said I\u2019m sorry\nthat they kicked you out. I said oh. I guess for her I was just another classmate.",
        "Q: What is it like to feel to be an outcast?",
        "A: Feels awful. When I was standing I remember that one time when Hitler\u2019s birthday was, and\neverybody came in uniform, Hitler Youth uniform. Everybody. So being a member of the Hitler\nYouth didn\u2019t really mean that you were a Nazi. They were all members and I was there private.\nIt\u2019s an awful feeling. I always thought you know I would feel like I\u2019m the only black in a white\nschool. And nobody harassed me or anything, but I came home and I said mommy next time I\u2019m\nnot going. So then I started. When anything like this was going on, I didn\u2019t go.",
        "Q: Did you feel inferior? Or just angry?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I was afraid more than I was feeling inferior. I maybe a certain extent yes, because when I\nwent to physical therapy school you know before I emigrated to the United States, I became, I\nwent to the University of Frankfurt and became a physical therapist. And one of the things I said\nto myself, I want that the people need me. That they want me. Because before nobody needed\nme, nobody wanted me. I also went then back to the university, to American U and Catholic U\nand I got two masters degrees. And I was a straight A student and I got a summa cum laude and\nso on. And people say oh you were so ambitious. I said no. But I had to prove to myself I can do\nit.",
        "Q: That you\u2019re not an outcast.",
        "A: Yeah, that I can do it you know. So somewhere this all stuck to me all the time, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s get back to just a little bit to the post war. Your sister left. You stayed with your\nmother. In Berlin.",
        "A: Mm hm. I went illegally to West Germany.",
        "Q: Illegally.",
        "A: Oh yes, sure. I danced. I took, I went to ballet school in Berlin. That was my big love. I\ndanced, I danced when I was in Frankfurt an der Oder and I was on the stage at the state theater\nand then they kicked me, they told me you couldn\u2019t come any more. You are half Jewish. That\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas very hard. That was more difficult for me really than to be kicked out of school because I\nloved dancing. So then in 45, I went back to ballet school. And I wanted to become a\nprofessional dancer. And so I joined a group and we traveled and this was, you know at this\npoint there was no wall. So you could go very easy from East Berlin to West Berlin and so on.\nAnd so then we went to West Germany. And every time I had to go to the police station and they\nput on that I was illegally there. And so but there was in Hamburg a woman who took pity on\nme and she was in this office where they give you housing. Because you know the cities were\ndestroyed so first you had to wait until you got something. And so she said all right, she said\nkeep in touch. Send me sometimes a postcard. So I sent her a postcard and one time I was in\nGerting [ph] which isn\u2019t too far from Hamburg and I got a postcard, come to Hamburg as soon\nas you can. I said ok so I took the train and went to Hamburg and I only went and you were so\ntrained in those things, you didn\u2019t say boo. And I only said hello. And she said oh I\u2019m so glad\nyou came because it\u2019s no good to walk around without identification card. I said mm hm, and\nthen she gave me her phone and she knew very well you know that I had this, I had an East\nGerman card in my pocket. And in this foment that I lost my identification card, 1t was not\nwritten, whether it was east or west, so I got a West German card. And at least then I could\nregister to immigrate. Because then I was legally in West Germany. I was always a little bit\nafraid then when I -- and one of my uncles in New York sponsored me. But I was a little bit\nafraid when I then registered that the Americans would find out that I\u2019m not really legally in\nWest Germany but they didn\u2019t or they didn\u2019t care. Whatever. But then you see I was legally in\nWest Germany. And then my sister was already here. And she had switched from history to\nsociology. So she became a psychotherapist. And she said you know you always liked dancing\nand gymnastics. Why don\u2019t you become a physical therapist. That\u2019s very much needed in the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nUnited States and it\u2019s really got restitution from the government. And so I did and then so I\u2019ve\nbeen, that\u2019s the reason I didn\u2019t come until 56 because I went there first and got my degree. And\nthen I worked one year because you know it takes some time before you get all the immigration\ngoing.",
        "Q: And you were living with your mother?",
        "A: No, no, no I was living Frankfurt. I was in west Germany. My mother was in Berlin. And she\nwas still in East Berlin at first and then she got a card from the post office. Oh no she was\nalready then over in West Berlin, without, she left the department, just locked it up and was\ngone. And then she got a card and it said that she and I should come to the post office. There is a\nletter which is registered. We should pick it up and we never went there because the East\nGermans were as bad as the Gestapo. And so we never went there. But then my mother was in\nWest Berlin and she got herself an apartment there and then when the wall came then she went to\nHannover because she was afraid that they would cut us, cut off from my sister and me.",
        "Q: How did you come to the United States?",
        "A: Well then I had the physical therapy degree",
        "Q: And you worked for a year.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: And I worked there. And then I registered here. You know I put in application and one of\nmy, of the cousins of my father Uncle Hans, he sponsored me because my sister couldn\u2019t sponsor\nme because she was just in graduate school then. And so she didn\u2019t have enough money. So you\nhad to put down $5000 in order to this. So Uncle Hans sponsored me and then I came over here.\nAnd then I stayed in Alexandria with my sister.",
        "Q: Your mother stayed back in \u2014",
        "A: She stayed back in Frankfurt, in Germany. She got the pension restored for my father. My\nmother was very good. She got us a year restoration and she wrote all these letters and so on. She\nwas very, very good in that and she got a lawyer to help her in all those things. And so on and so\nshe, and she stayed then in Germany. She came over here all the time.",
        "Q: To visit.",
        "A: To visit but she didn\u2019t\u2019 want it. Number one the exchange rate at this point were one to four\nso her pension would have been very small. And she didn\u2019t want to be a burden and so then to\nthe end really to the end, my mother died since 95 and she said I wished I would have made the\ndecision to come because then you know we always traveled for and back you know in the fall.\nAnd I was there when she died. But she was, then she regretted it. But then she also was you see\nthe trouble is this foreign language. One of my uncles, not the one who sponsored me but one of\nmy other uncles, when he was in the Jewish home for the Aged in New York and he suddenly\nonly spoke German and he was fluent in English. And my mother was afraid that she said if I get\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsick I can\u2019t communicate. And we had a patient in, at GW where I worked as physical therapist\nwho had a stroke and he, who can speak German. Who can speak German. So you know, I said\nok so we all, he couldn\u2019t speak a word, other, except German. And then he recovered and he\nspoke fluent English. And then they all said ha, but then he couldn\u2019t. and that\u2019s, so mommy was\nvery much aware of that and she said I didn\u2019t\u2019 want to be a burden and I don\u2019t want to lose the\nability that I can communicate. She was very independent and in control. And so she didn\u2019t\nwant to have this happen to her.",
        "Q: How fluent were you in English when you came here?",
        "A: I was better in English, English than American English. It\u2019s I took, I mean I had in high\nschool English. I had, my first foreign language was French. And I had, was much better in\nFrench than in English and then the second was English and the third was Latin. But and then\nbefore I immigrated, I took English lessons again. And then I came here and I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand very well. Because English is so much easier you know the pronunciation 1s so much\nmore distinct than American. You know. But I got a job. At first I got at the office of three\nsurgeons, orthopedic surgeons and then I came to GW and so on. But you learn you know if you\nare always surrounded by it and you don\u2019t hear anything else but English it\u2019s you know you get,\nand then I also didn\u2019t make \u2014 I read books like Agatha Christie is good to read because there is\nso much dialogue in. And which is important. And one of the things you should never do, have a\ndictionary beside you. If you don\u2019t know a word look it up. Then the next time, look it up. You\nnever get anywhere. Just say ok and just content, must be something like that because if you\nalways start to do that you never get fluent.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: So you stayed with your sister and you worked at GW, George Washington Hospital?",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "Q: And then?",
        "A: Then I met my husband.",
        "Q: Then you met your husband. Ok. And he was American.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. And he spoke uhh. I mean I could, by then I could understand that but all our\nfriends, you know when they, anybody who came over, they all had trouble to understand him\nbecause you know he speaks like that. He was, my husband is from Altoona, Pennsylvania, so\nwe also have, when we dated we were sitting at the railroad tracks watching the trains going by\nbecause his father worked for the Pennsylvania railroad and my father the German railroad. So\nwhen we came back we lived in an old house in Old Town Alexandria and then we also had\nanother roommate which was a classmate from graduate school from my sister. And she, Jean,\nand she said oh you are lying. And my sister said uh, uh I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: What year did you get married?",
        "A: 58.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: And then you continued on working?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I worked all the time. Yeah but then I went back. Physical therapy, I was a very\ngood therapist and but the trouble with physical therapy is you are involved in the whole family.\nPsychological. And you work mentally with the patient and physical, which makes it very\ndifficult. Like I had you know you, I had one patient. I worked also then for the Visiting Nurses.\nAnd so we went to the homes. And there was one lady and she lived near Dupont Circle and the\nhouse was you know several levels. And she was in the bedroom upstairs and they had put in an\nelevator you know on the stairs. And she was frightened to death and I said you can do it. I\ncome after work and we do it. And you make sure that your husband and your son is there. And\nso on. So they were. And I said ok you can do it and so we had, you had to be and she was much\ntaller than I am. And you had to be very strong to convince these people. I wasn\u2019t so sure if she\ncan. But you can\u2019t let them know. So she did and she went down. And then she had a martini\nwith her husband and her son and then we went up again. And so on. So she can do it. And then I\nflew down the stairs because I said oh I wasn\u2019t sure if we manage and so the husband said to me,\nyeah my wife told me that you don\u2019t walk down the stairs. You fly down. And so, so one time\nmy mother was there. And John and my mother and I, we went to a party and everybody was\nthere. And then they couldn\u2019t find me and I was sitting in one room. At this point I was the chief\ntherapist of the Easter Seal treatment center in Rockville. And they couldn\u2019t find me. And then\nthey found me in a room sitting on a sofa, sound asleep because you know as a chief therapist I\nalways thought if anything is I told the other therapists ok you take it easy and I took an extra\npatient. And I was just plain exhausted. So my husband then talked to the librarian at this point\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nat National Bureau of Standards. You know it\u2019s not now National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology. And he said you always loved books and so on. So I talked to her and then I took\nan exam with the civil service in translating German into English. And after that I could work as\na translator. And it was the National Bureau of Standards. And after I was finished I thought\ngosh if I would be a few years younger, I would have flunked my own native tongue because it\nwas in the old German script and I came home and I said John, they still have it in the old\nGerman script. I was -- and so on. So then I worked as a translator in the library at the National\nBureau of Standards. And I realized that you don\u2019t get anywhere in a library except you have\nthat master\u2019s degree, you can have ten PhDs or whatever. You have to have that master\u2019s degree\nin library science. So then I went to Catholic U and got the master\u2019s degree. And then I had to\nside paths because I didn\u2019t have enough, I had all these medical courses you know so I didn\u2019t\nhave enough liberal arts courses so they sent me back to undergraduate school. So I went to\nundergraduate school and in order to get it faster, I said ok I take German literature and so I\ngraduate, and art history because I had both of them back home so I said ok so I got this and then\nI went there. And then I worked as librarian yeah. And I worked at surgeon\u2019s (?) and NBS and\nthen I worked for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as the reference librarian. And I worked\nand then when I retired I worked there as a consultant. And I had all, all the foreign documents\ncoming from Vienna you know International Atomic Energy Commission and all of these places,\nyeah. But so I worked until 2005. And when my husband collapsed, I said my gosh I wished I\nhad my job back. It\u2019s the best thing you can have is ajob. You have to function and if something\nis, also as physical therapist. You know like they said really when I was with the Easter Seal I\nhad an old lady, then I thought was old. Was 80 or something. She had a hip operation and she\nwalked with a cane. And she said the doctor told me I would be like new. And here I am\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwalking with a cane. I said now if I\u2019m in your age and just have a cane, I think I would be very\nhappy. And she says you have to quit talking. You have nothing of my experience. I said you\nreally want to know. And I told her my past. And then she said oh, I think I am very happy to\nhave acane only. But you learn to smile and people don\u2019t expect that you have anything like this\nin your past. And so on. And at first I never really talked you know you didn\u2019t talk about any\ncase. And but one thing, neither John nor I could have. We couldn\u2019t have children. I couldn\u2019t put\nany, I thought it was so awful that I would never expose any child to the world. Who knows if\nnot something like this happens again. And John was drafted, was 18, and he was at the Battle of\nthe Bulge. And he came back very badly wounded. He has Purple Heart and everything. He\nlives, he is buried in Arlington and we both made the decision we don\u2019t want children, because\nhe thought it was so awful. And I thought and I always think how can all these people have\nchildren. I just, I just couldn\u2019t. I just couldn\u2019t. And I confronted my mother and one time when\nHitler was on and I said you know only because you and Fati wanted to have children, I had to\nbe born. And my mother told me that later and she said she was horrified. And so, but it was so\nawful for me you know it was so awful. And I was in school and I had classmates, and I had\nfriends, but I always knew that somewhere that it will hit me. And I just couldn\u2019t see to have\nanybody putting into the world. But most people did. And I don\u2019t know how they could manage.",
        "Q: Did your sister get married?",
        "A: No my sister didn\u2019t, never got married. No, no she never got married. So I don\u2019t know. I just,\nyou know when and mommy\u2019s family was you know they were all mommy\u2019s, my mother had\none brother and they were very close. And when Fati died, he refused to see her. And it was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nawful. So when he died, John and I were actually in Germany and I, it was awful for my mother\nreally but I said I can\u2019t go to the funeral. I just can\u2019t pretend I\u2019m sorry. So I didn\u2019t go.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about Germany now. Do you feel very German?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Do you feel American?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Yes. See I\u2019m a docent for the National Gallery of Art and I give tours in English\non weekends. I\u2019m a docent. They drafted me to give tours in German because there are only four\nof us then. Foreign language docent. And one has ovarian cancer, and one had some kind of\nanother interesting problems and so there are practically only two left and which we have two.\nSo I give regularly tours in German. And somewhere each time I have to jump over my own\nshadow to give it in German.",
        "Q: Psychologically?",
        "A: Mm hm.",

        "Q: You don\u2019t want to speak the language?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Iam always admire here in this building you know as I told you, German\nconversation, they are almost all German survivors, I mean Holocaust survivors. And they speak\nGerman and then I speak German and I always, one time next time I think I ask them because at\nfirst they said, I said ok I come one time and so that one time I\u2019m going to come and that\u2019s all.\nAnd then I realized that they are all more or less Jewish. And so I have been going from time to\ntime. But I don\u2019t know. They don\u2019t seem to have that problem. But I don\u2019t want to speak\nGerman. I also dream in English And I count in English. And when I go to Germany, I go ina\nstore and count, one, two, three, four.",
        "Q: Purposely or just naturally?",
        "A: Naturally.",
        "Q: Naturally. So you go back to Germany frequently.",
        "A: I was alone. My mother lived and she was very old. I went over there quite often, yeah. I was\nthere when she died and so on. When my mother died and you know, my mother lived in a senior\ncitizen home and the people were all very nice to me. And I only read English books. And I said\nI don\u2019t want that they are nice to me. I don\u2019t want that they are nice to me. I just didn\u2019t. And my\nhusband spent a year in, was sent from NBS to England and he was supposed to be one year in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nEngland and half, and the other half, half a year in England and half a year in Gerting [ph]. And\nI told John Ok, I come visit to England and then I go home and you go to Gerting. And needless\nsaying, he didn\u2019t go to Gerting. He extended his time in Germany. But I couldn\u2019t\u2019 live for half a\nyear in Germany.",
        "Q: He extended his time in England? You mean.",
        "A: Yeah, he spent the whole year in England.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about Germany? How would you explain that to somebody?",
        "A: There, I don\u2019t understand. I mean I can now, I can go to Germany. I can talk to the Germans.\nI can\u2019t you know specially the younger generation when we come to Germany, my sister and I,\nall see, for example from my mother\u2019s family, the younger generation. They all come and want\nto see us. You know the aunts from the United States and so on. And they are all Aryans you\nknow. They are all very nice to us and so on. And I can talk to them. I don\u2019t feel that I have to\nhold this all against them. They were not even alive then. I don\u2019t think they have to apologize\nwhat their parents did. You know. Who knows how they would have reacted, maybe differently,\nmaybe not. I don\u2019t know but I can go to Germany now. In the beginning I couldn\u2019t. But now I\ncan go to Germany and talk to the Germans and so on but I make sure I have only English books\nto read. And when my sister and I talk, when we go together, we talk English. Yeah. And we\nwere one time we went to the Leekonstans [ph] and we were in a train. And there was a young\nlady and she finally asked us and she said but you, you know because you realize that when we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ntalk to her, we spoke German. And so on. And she said you always talk English to each other and\nwe said yes. And I think I do more than my sister even. But then she 1s two years old, which\nmakes slightly difference maybe. I don\u2019t know. But I sometimes you know how Germany\nrecovered and so on you know. It\u2019s really remarkable. But I feel more East German than I feel\nWest German. If you see. And it is very sad what\u2019s going on in East Germany.",
        "Q: Do you feel Jewish at all?",
        "A: Yeah because all my, most of my friends are Jewish. And I don\u2019t know how it happened. The\npeople, most of, I said the majority of people here are Jewish. But the people I have dinner with,\nI skip dinner very often but the ones I have, they are all Jewish. And my best friends like Renata\nChernoff and so on, they\u2019re all Jewish.",
        "Q: Is there anything today that reminds you of the war times, sights or sounds or smells, you\nknow bring a flashback?",
        "A: When I see the war pictures, you know from Iraq or from Afghanistan and so on, yes. It\u2019s\nand it\u2019s the war 1s something awful in my eyes. It\u2019s awful. And you always hit the civilians. You\nknow I mean in Berlin when they bombed. There is a whole part which is Zementstadt, [ph]\nZement. The Americans never bombed Zemenstadt because they wanted to have all their\npatterns. They hit us. You know I always say why didn\u2019t they hit Auschwitz. I mean it was\nawful for the people but it\u2019s better to be over this. They never hit it. Why didn\u2019t they? They\nknew that Auschwitz existed. And you know this boat, when you go to the Holocaust museum.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nYou know they show you the know the boat which went to Cuba and they didn\u2019t let in and all the",
        "Q: The St. Louis?",
        "A: And they didn\u2019t let them in. You know and they knew. I mean sure it\u2019s and my cousins and\nyou know the ones who immigrated who made it out in 39 really over land and they came here\nand so on. And Loni and they are now all going to the synagogues and we go to the bat mitzvahs\nand all these things when it happens in their family. And they have Jewish weddings and\neverything certainly. But Loni said we never prayed for the Jews in Germany. I said you didn\u2019t.\nNo we never did. And then I feel you can\u2019t get mad at some -- I feel that they wanted us in\nGermany. Yeah. And it was almost impossible to come out. But see, you know the people who\nwent over the Himalayas, like the widow of Mahler, the composer and so on. All these, the top\npeople. They got out. But the little ones, the Jews, they were stuck. So then you know it\u2019s, the\nGermans were awful but then the people who came back out of the concentration camps, many\nof them when they went back to Poland, the Poles killed them. So are they better? And the\nUkrainian guards in the camps were worse than the German guards. But nobody sees anything\nabout it. So sometimes you know it\u2019s \u2014 I think and the whole world looked on. And America\ndidn\u2019t go in the war until much later. By then everything was rolling. And they knew about it.",
        "Q: Do you think it could happen again?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Yes. Maybe a different way. Not with the gas chambers. One time my sister gave a party and\nfor those people asked us. I was already married then John, yeah. And he said how do you feel.\nAnd I said no, sometimes I feel like this is a very beautiful dream. And one day I will wake up\nand that is all again like it was. And then I asked my sister and she said just the reverse. That was\na bad dream and this 1s the reality. But yes, I think it can happen again. And when East German\n\u2014 the wall fell I had a terrible dream. I was standing on a mountain. And there was a railroad\nstation and I was in obviously in West Germany. And the wall fell. And I went down to the\nrailroad station and entered the train. And then the train went east and all the people in there\nwere dead. So it still haunts me. So there are certain things when they happen, it just haunts me.\nI never will get over it. I never will get really over it. And even you know people say I do so\nmuch. Yes and I do supposedly a very good job in giving tours and so on. But I feel very much\ndifferent than the other docents. I think about it. And one of the things is I feel different is you\nknow they also, we had one of our docents you know there is a Jewish group and they\nimmediately took her in. But they didn\u2019t take me in. I\u2019m not really Jewish. And I\u2019m not really\nthere either so all my life I have been struggling somewhere between. I feel closer to the Jews\nbut Iam not really, I don\u2019t know. So John and I got married in the Unitarian church.",
        "Q: How did you meet him?",
        "A: Oh I met him ina camp. At Prince William forest. My sister had a friend and colleague who\nwas a member of the 2030 club of the Unitarian church, 16\" street. And they had to, Memorial\nDay they went to a camp at Prince William county, forest. And they had three camps \u2014 for men,\nfor women and for families. So Laura said to my sister, don\u2019t you and Ursala want to come. We\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsaid oh sure, why not. So we did. And then Brigitta and I rowed, was rowing a boat and there\ncame a thunder shower and poured and the lake in the middle had the island. And everybody\ntried to get there. And there was a gentleman. It was John who also went there. He also had\nfriends who, he had roommates who were members of the 2030 club and so he was in the men\u2019s\ncamp. And then he asked me about cars, well Porsche and all these. At this point he had MG.\nAnd I didn\u2019t know, it was all much, I couldn\u2019t afford any of those things so I said fine. So then\nhe asked me for a date which I didn\u2019t take. And then John had hay fever very badly so he came\nto GW for shots. And I was outside of the physical therapy department because we had inpatient\nand outpatient. And I waited for a patient. And there came a gentleman and he said oh you\nprobably don\u2019t remember me. No. Then he said I now have a Porsche. Ah. That\u2019s this guy.\nAnd so you want to see it. Sure. Then I came home and I said to my sister and her roommate,\nand our roommate. If he asks me for a date again, I do it. I want to be in that Porsche. That\u2019s\nhow it started.",
        "Q: That\u2019s wonderful.",
        "A: So we, I still had the Porsche when John died. I always said if the Porsche go, I go.",
        "Q: How long ago did he die?",
        "A: Only on the 15\" of January 2009. He had heart attacks before and he collapsed on the\nplatform of Dupont Circle. He went to GW for tests and everybody thought he was sailing\nalong. He had a kind of leukemia and he had this heart condition and his kidneys didn\u2019t function\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthat well anymore. But everybody thought he was a . And we went to Kramer\u2019s and we\nhad lunch and he really made, we made plans. We said oh maybe we go back. We like to go to\nVirginia to the state park and then we went back to the railroad station and he collapsed. And\nthey took him to GW but he was brain dead already. And they asked me then if they really\nvigorous wanted to revive him and I said if he has no brain function, no. And then he died in the\nnight. And he was gone.",
        "Q: You said buried in Arlington.",
        "A: Yeah. So we were married for 50 years and five months. Yeah, it was a shock yeah, yeah.\nVery strange.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n(Tape 3 \u2014 RG-50.106.0184.03.03; duration: 57:51)\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Ursala Guttstadt McKinney. This is track number three. OK\nsO you were saying before that a few years ago you wouldn\u2019t have been willing to be interviewed\nor talk about your experiences. What do you think has changed in these last few years?\nUrsala Guttstadt McKinney: Well in the beginning it was just too painful. I, one time, somebody\nasked me about things and about what happened and so on and afterwards when I went back to\nBurke, I had the telephone the wrong side around because I couldn\u2019t function anymore. It\u2019s and\nI would just break down and cry. And it was just too painful. And by now I think number one it\nis longer ago. And number two is I also think is that if my generation dies off, there is nobody\nreally anymore who can talk about it. And so we should just overcome that and just do talk about\nit.",
        "Q: It\u2019s important that you tell us what it was like.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And so on but it\u2019s you know something that will haunt you for the rest of your\nlife. And it\u2019s nothing which 1s easy to overcome anywhere. That\u2019s one reason is that I\u2019m you\nknow surprised that people could put children in the world. I couldn\u2019t. I thought that was too, too\ndamaging. It was too bad. And you know and when politic -- people are not aware of it. And that\nis a danger in always that people say oh political, it isn\u2019t so bad yet. Maybe, maybe we still can\ntake that and so on. And by the time they realize that they can\u2019t take it anymore very often\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\npeople are trapped. And then they really can\u2019t do anything anymore. But you know with\nGermany too, is talking about Germany when I worked, when I was studying physical therapy in\nFrankfurt at the University of Frankfurt am Main, we also had to go in to different hospitals and\nthere was this psychiatric ward and where they had to, you know locked us in the therapists and\nwe played ball with these men and so on. It was all the women\u2019s ward. And one time I came\nthere and they were very excited and I said what, what\u2019s the matter. And I said, oh a Jew comes\nback from Germany. From United States. And I said so, yeah. We don\u2019t want a Jew. I said now\nhe might be very nice. We don\u2019t want a Jew. I said no, how many Jews do you know? You\nknow and I said oh, how can you say that you don\u2019t want him. And when he came, he was very\nnice. And you know people came back. They were not, not everybody made it and the German\ngovernment gave them money. So he came back and he got insurance and they paid for him. And\nhe was a very quiet, calm man. You know somewhere, somebody who was not very assertive\nand so on. Because, and he hadn\u2019t made it in the United States. So he was very depressed and\nhad problems. And everybody loved him. And I said oh. But then they didn\u2019t want to hear any\nmore what they once told me that they couldn\u2019t stand having one. But again, but then these\npeople believed you know whatever the government tells them because they really didn\u2019t know\nbetter. And then you know sure the schwarzes [ph] didn\u2019t help either in anything either. So it\u2019s\nalways difficult you know. I guess in the name of Jesus more people were killed than saved.",
        "Q: If someone asked you today are you German what would you answer?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I said when people ask me where formerly I was from, I\u2019m a German. I\u2019m American. Yeah.\nOh yeah. No, no I don\u2019t feel German and I don\u2019t want to be considered to be a German. So it\u2019s\nnot good.",
        "Q: When you give those tours you say the German speaking tours at the National Gallery, the\ntourists ask you. Do they ask you something about your knowledge of German or are you from\nGermany? Do they ask you or they don\u2019t ask you?",
        "A: You know they ask me where I\u2019m from. I say from Berlin.",
        "Q: Oh, from Berlin.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t Frankfurt an der Oder. They are more or less, well, Frankfurt an der Oder, they\ndon\u2019t know in any case. But they don\u2019t, these are all younger people really. Then they don\u2019t ask\nme anything. No, they don\u2019t. Right after the wall fell I got lots, there came people over from East\nGermany, formerly East Germany. And one of the women one time said to me you know when\npeople realize that we are German, it\u2019s like a curtain goes down. You know there are lots of\nAmericans who are still very much anti-German. And you can see it in our whole collection. If\nyou go to the German collection, it\u2019s awful. We have some Durers and so on but I don\u2019t find\nthere are any good Durers and so on. So the people who collected at this point they also didn\u2019t\nwant to collect German art.",
        "Q: Do you remember the Eichmann trial?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: What were some of your thoughts at that time?",
        "A: One of the things is I guess for many people that is a relief. For me, neither my mother nor\nmy sister nor I ever have tried to find the Gestapo people who hunted us. My father was killed.\nThey ruined my life to a certain extent. Chasing down these people wouldn\u2019t do anything for\nme. I always thought if I would have to gotten these people on a trial, maybe somebody else did,\nI don\u2019t know. But if I would, it would be more horrifying for me to have sit through that trial\nthan would have done me any good because the damage was done. And so the Eich\u2014you know\nI mean he was a horrible guy and I guess justice was done. But it\u2019s the people. You can\u2019t undo\nanything with the revenge. When the people talk about 9/11 that was awful, but trying to now\nthey say oh they should give us all so much money for this and so on. It doesn\u2019t bring you the\nloved ones back. I mean if you are left as a widow and have small children for god\u2019s sake sure,\ngive them a pension. And give the kids that they can go to school and so on. But revenge kills\nyourself. And so I think from (phone ringing) for many people it\u2019s a relief, but for me, I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: Are you more comfortable being with people who survived the war than those who didn\u2019t\neven live through it?",
        "A: In the beginning John and I, we saw every war movie. I saw every movie on the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nconcentration camps. We felt you know people who didn\u2019t go through that lived in a different\nworld than we did. But by now it\u2019s you know the whole generation, the younger ones, they\nnever experienced anything like this. It\u2019s, I mean I think I personally would never serve in the\narmed services. I would never shoot against anybody. But I would, it\u2019s certainly in some ways\neasier to be with people who have similar experience than I do. Than with people who don\u2019t\nhave any idea what went on. But the majority of the people I meet you know they don\u2019t, they\nread it in books.",
        "Q: Do you think you would have been a different person today if you hadn\u2019t gone through?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I would.",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "A: Well one of the things is you know it\u2019s not so easy to immigrate. Even if you are glad to\nleave your country. Somewhere I feel like I started off on the first floor and I don\u2019t have a\nbasement. And you know I never went to elementary school here. Things were very different\nwhen I arrived here in Alexandria. It was so different to anything I had experienced or ever seen\nin my life. It\u2019s not easy to live, to leave your country. In some ways you know if I would have\nstayed in Germany, no war, no Nazis, or nothing I would have had a very nice house, I would\nhave gone to the university. I would have studied in Germany at this point. I could have become\nan engineer, even as a woman. I would have studied, I would have become a professional\nperson. And then I would have traveled and I would have a good life. We had enough money to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nso I could have had a good life. And it would have been much easier. So but I mean it\u2019s to\nimmigrate is hard. To move into a different country and Americans are very nice. So long as you\ndon\u2019t compete with them. When I went to AU I, one time I went to the English, you know I had\nto take English One. I was then, I didn\u2019t have to take English Two, but I went and talked to the\nEnglish professor and she said well people like you become, she was not against me but she told\nme. She said people like you we can\u2019t discriminate against. We can\u2019t discriminate against the\nblacks. They are all up in arms. We can\u2019t discriminate, but people like you. You don\u2019t have\nanybody to fight for you. It\u2019s true. And Americans.",
        "Q: Immigrants, she was talking about immigrants.",
        "A: Yes, yeah. And you know and then in this case the Jewish community would helped the Jews\nbut I was separate and so on. So Catholic University, I said ok. When we had, before the\ncomprehensives I said I\u2019m doomed and I went out and cried. And they said why you, you can\u2019t\nflunk. You have so good grades. And I said well one semester they flunk a nun because they\ncan\u2019t see the forest because of the individual trees. The next semester they flunk an immigrant. In\nmy class is no nun. So I am the victim. Never since the 70s.",
        "Q: And what happened?",
        "A: Well I didn\u2019t flunk. I, they couldn\u2019t flunk me. I had too good grades. You know I was too\ngood a student. But so it keeps on going. I applied for a job as a physical therapist for the\nvisiting nurses, and there was, they had to, interviewed me was a nurse who was a spinster who\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas not married. And so on. So then when I came home, I said John that\u2019s a job I don\u2019t get. He\nsaid why not. And I said well one thing she told me. There you are. Our American boys go\noverseas and marry all these foreigners and then the American girls can\u2019t find husbands. So\ndiscrimination goes on and on and on.",
        "Q: Have you been to Israel?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about Israel and how you feel when you are there?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I mean I love Israel you know. I mean for a while I really wanted to go there. In the\nmeantime, it\u2019s another war I don\u2019t want to go. No. But yeah I would like, all -- you know when\nIsrael became independent you know I was so amazed that I was so amazed that they finally\nmade it and they have a home country. And so on. Now you know things are unfortunately so\nbad you know with all the fighting and all that. But you know that Israel, the Jews had to go\nsomewhere and it was the most logical thing to go to Israel. And Israel was founded on\nAryanism. And so on so you know it was I mean it was a wonderful, wonderful event when\nIsrael became Israel. And oh yeah and I was there and I was you know was very, very happy you\nknow.",
        "Q: Do you know people who live there?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah oh yeah. I do know people who live in Israel. Yeah. Yeah. I also know\npeople who live, immigrated to Israel and then came to the United States. We have had now\nsomebody here who was born in Hamburg and then her parents and everybody went, immigrated\nto Israel. And she got married so oldest daughter got, was born there and then her husband, and\nthey are all Jewish and now they were Israelis, and then they went to Venezuela. He got a job\noffer there and she came here now. She said Venezuela was awful, another dictatorship. You\nlost something.",
        "Q: Before we finish I just wanted to ask you, I know what the word mischling means, but what\ndoes it mean to you, viscerally. Do you know what I mean , emotionally.",
        "A: Well mischling is really in many ways you know you\u2019re a mixture between a Jew and a\nChristian. And it\u2019s mulattoes are you know, Obama is a mischling. Only he is between black and\nwhite. But \u2014",
        "Q: Do you consider it derogatory?",
        "A: I don\u2019t feel it did derogative but it feels like you don\u2019t belong anywhere. The one camp says\nyou\u2019re Jewish. The other camp say no you\u2019re a Christian. So you are in the middle. You don\u2019t\nbelong anywhere. And so I, you know it\u2019s, these days you know there are so many mixed,\nmarriages between black and white and so on and I always feel some way sorry for the kids. I\nalways think I wonder how they feel. If they always feel like I do that you stand somewhere\nbetween them. You know. And my grandmother, mommy\u2019s mother, when she said, one time she\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsaid to us oh you know you always protect your father. What about your mother? And our\nanswer was but nobody attacks mommy but everybody attacks Fati.",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t her life in danger, being married to a Jew?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. They tried to you know as I said, many of them they got divorced\nbecause it was \u2014 I don\u2019t think they would have anything to my mother. No, no.",
        "Q: Even though she had been married?",

        "A: Yeah. You know but I don\u2019t think that mommy was really in danger. No, they would have\ntaken my sister and me but not my mother. But me we are, you see Hitler in comparison to the\nJewish law where you know your mother\u2019s religion is more important. And to Hitler it was more\nimportant what your father is. It was so my sister had one classmate in her class who was\nmischling, you know half Jewish. But her mother was Jewish. She was never taken. Her\nhusband was the one. It was worse to have a Jewish father than to have a Jewish mother.",
        "Q: You were what, a mischling to the first degree?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And did you ever have any papers that said you were a mischling, nothing ever in writing.",

        "A: No, no, no. I got it in paper. Oh you got everything in paper from the Germans. Very demo,\nvery bureaucratic. I mean like you got death certificate from my father. But see yeah and see,\nthere was also, it always depended if you had four Jewish grandparents. You were Jewish. If you\nhad two you were half Jewish. But now if I had two Jewish grandparents, if I marry another half\nJew the, my kids would have four Jewish grandparents. They would be Jewish again.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: Actually from what I understand when you were growing up, you did not know other\nmischlings?",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. There was another, one of my classmates who was, her mother was\nJewish and she was of Jewish religion but her father wasn\u2019t Jewish. And they but then she went\nto Berlin and so on. And then my cousins were like my sister and me you know. Albert and\nGerhard and then my sister\u2019s friend, she was a mischling. Oh yeah there were lots of them\naround. And we knew other people in Frankfurt an der Oder, one where the mother finally broke\ndown. The woman broke down and got divorced from her husband. And asked him for his\ndeportment the next day and she was ok. And but her daughter went with the children\u2019s transport\nto England. So she wasn\u2019t even in the country anymore. You know I don\u2019t know how she\nreacted towards that. And then we had you know my father had, I mean I knew quite a lot of\nmischling yeah, quite a lot.",
        "Q: When you see that word written in 2010, do you have any kind of reaction to it?",
        "A: Mischling.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

        "A: Well then I would say that\u2019s me. At this point no, I think \u2014",
        "Q: Has it lost its negative connotation?",
        "A: To be a mischling didn\u2019t really bother me so much. What bothered me more 1s the reaction of\nthe two parties that they always thought that I am neither nor. That I was otherwise you know\nthat I was a mischling. That didn\u2019t, you know my father. I loved my father, loved my mother.\nThat was all very nice and it didn\u2019t bother me. But that each camp really -- so I don\u2019t belong\nthere, you don\u2019t belong there. But then you don\u2019t belong there either. You belong there. So you\ndidn\u2019t belong anywhere.",

        "A: Not really, no, no.",
        "Q: Was that very upsetting to your mother?",
        "A: Yeah. But it wasn\u2019t really that, I mean they didn\u2019t vocalize it really that much. We lived in\nFrankfurt. They lived in Erfurt. And I think if mommy\u2019s parents would have been against\nmommy, that would have been very hard. But Omi always was very supportive for us and she\nhelped us financially and everything and, and so, and my father you see went to my grandfather\nand asked you know for the hand of mommy and said. Well they knew each other as children.\nThere was a playground in Berlin and my parents, both parents went, were members of it and the\nGuttstadts were on the board and so on. So my mother played with my father when they were\nkids. And so on. Then they lost contact and there was another family. The Karls who were also\nJewish and they kept in contact with both sides. So they thought that my father and my mother\nshould meet again. And so they invited them together so they really got them together again, but\nthey knew each other as kids. They played on the same playground and so on. And then my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmother was very good in tennis. And my father I don\u2019t think played tennis. But my father could\nrun and do all these things and my mother tells us about it. The Uncle Fritz, as a, and Fati were\nbrothers, took her in the middle and run so she and she never got her feet on the ground. And so\non. So then, the family knew each other.",
        "Q: How do you feel about having the United States Holocaust Museum being built in the United\nStates?",
        "A: Well I\u2019m a founding member. I, I have very mixed feelings about the Holocaust Museum\nbecause you know I can go there. I went there with my, right after the opening. My sister and I\nwent there when it opened. You know we lit a candle for my father and so on. But then the\nsecond time around, we went with our two cousins. They are really once removed. They are from\nNew York. And we all went and then we saw all the pictures. And that was funny because then\nLoni and Heather all were in Berlin and say oh yeah that\u2019s the synagogue I went to. That\u2019s the\nschool I went to. So it was you know, and then I wasn\u2019t upset at all. And one of my cousins was\nin, I pushed her in the wheelchair and so on. And then I went Sean (?) certainly too. But one time\nI went, I had visitors. My classmate who finally came to us. Her two daughters came over here.\nAnd I took them to the Holocaust Museum. And then I spoke German and then I couldn\u2019t. I said\nI, you go and I sit down and I cried.",
        "Q: You speaking German to them.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: And I couldn\u2019t. I can go through with Americans. I got with John\u2019s family, some of John\u2019s\nfamily came and said they say can\u2019t you go with us. I said ok. I can do that, but when I get to\nGerman, then it\u2019s out. Then I can\u2019t. Germans I can\u2019t go. Then I can\u2019t. Well, it\u2019s ok. I think there\nare too many by now. You know the trouble 1s too is when you give anything to 1t you know. My\nsister is a member of the Beck Institute and you know we looked up some of the, where some of\nour relatives ended up who went to Theresienstadt and out because Theresienstadt didn\u2019t have\nany gas chambers. And they all went to other places. The way how the people died in\nMauthausen is awful.",
        "Q: Did you purposely want to learn that because your father was there?",
        "A: I promised my mother never to go to Mauthausen so I will never go there. But yeah, yeah I\nwanted you know so it\u2019s yeah. And yeah there is Eistadt [ph], you know the quote, this is in\nEnglish. I mean they wrote it in German. He wrote about all the different ways how they died in\nthe camps too. Not everybody died you know in the gas chambers. There are other ways to kill\npeople too. So I don\u2019t 100% know how my father died. But I have a pretty good idea. But so\nit\u2019s, but people \u2014 and that people could you know many of these SS people who were at camps\nthey went home to their family. They were good family fathers. They had dogs and kids and\nthen they turned around and did that. It\u2019s a same as what some of our soldiers did in Iraq right.\nAnd what did we do to the some of the people. How to torture people. And then they go home\nand are good to many people and it\u2019s hard to believe.",
        "Q: You said before you still feel that the world has really not learned a lesson? Or has it?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Well for most people by now I am afraid that the Holocaust is some way history. And for\nmost people, probably, I mean you can\u2019t, I haven\u2019t tried it, but any time you would talk to any\nGerman about it then they would immediately tell you how bad it was during the war with ration\ncards and bombs falling on your head and all that and people tell you how bad it was to shut you\nup. They also had told in the 50s a joke. The Volkswagen. How many people go ina\nVolkswagen, four Germans and one Jew. The Jew 1s in the ashtray. One of my classmates in\nphysical therapy school told me that. But then we were too from East Germany. They didn\u2019t trust\nus either. They thought that we were spies. So depends to whom you speak. And if you don\u2019t\nsay anything, that\u2019s it. And it was awful. You know after the war. The rats were that big. And\nthe people were lying in the streets. They ate on them you know. I mean there was, you walked\nalong the streets and there was a pipe coming up and people were living under earth because it\nwas all destroyed. I mean it was horrible. You know. We went, you know you just stepped over\ndead bodies. You know. We went, mommy, my sister and I that was before the war was over.\nYou know Potsdam was like Dresden, declared an open city but nevertheless the Americans\nbombed it and so we went by train. We went in and then we had to, last we had to walk. And\nthere were all these bodies lying there and I faint. I\u2019m not very good in seeing blood. But\nnevertheless there was life, there was hens (?), there was something there and you just kept on\ngoing. I have to go there. It was just meant. And sure it was awful. It had nothing to do with the\nHolocaust. It was the war. And it was awful. And these were people, not soldiers. They were\njust civilians. You know they had train (German word?) which was one of the suburban trains;\nso that\u2019s awful yeah. So war, I don\u2019t believe in war. I always tell people it 1s sanctified murder.\nI don\u2019t like it. And you know I can understand, when these guys and they\u2019re all trigger happy\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nyou know. I mean either you or me. It\u2019s better you and not me. Human beings want to survive. I\nmean the people who survived in the concentration camps had a very strong will to survive. And\nso religious, the orthodox Jews had the plaff [ph]. And the communists. The murderers were the\nbest because they didn\u2019t care what happened. You know they helped. The ones who caved in\nwere the elite. The university professors, the doctors and all these people. They couldn\u2019t cope\nwith that. They were also the ones who informed. You know if they saw anybody, a Jew or\nanybody anywhere they were informing. They were frightened to death for their own life. The\nlaborites and the communists and so on. They were much more helpful. When I was very\ndepressed there. I went to the northern part of Berlin where all the laborers work and so on and I\nfelt much more secure there. Than when I was in the more fancy places in Berlin. But that\u2019s\nhuman nature is something very strange. Very strange.",
        "Q: Did you and your sister talk about those years?",
        "A: Sometimes, yes. Sometimes yes.",
        "Q: Has she been willing to talk about it?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah and our memories are somewhere different. You know we said something lately\nand she said oh I don\u2019t remember that at all. And sometimes she says something and I said I\ndon\u2019t remember that at all. And so on. So like I said I, I can\u2019t remember when my elementary\nschool teacher told us we had to say Heil Hitler. I had no idea. It didn\u2019t make any impression of\nme. And so certain things and two years difference, I guess is the difference. And one time\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nRenata Chernoff and Frieda Blumenthal who is dead by now who was older than both of us and\nI, we went to an exhibit together. And then Renata said to us that Amos wanted to go to I think it\nwas Berlin to a conference. And, and she was considering to go or not and I said don\u2019t and\nFrieda said sure, why not. But then she could remember Germany before Hitler. I couldn\u2019t\nreally. That was typical for Renata just looked at us both. You know. She could still remember\nwhen things were different. So it\u2019s always it makes a big difference yeah.",
        "Q: For you, you were eight years old when Hitler came into power.",
        "A: No I wasn\u2019t really eight yet.",
        "Q: Seven, you\u2019re right. So for you it always meant Germany always meant tension and stress.",
        "A: Yeah and we were surrounded. Our house was here and there was another house here and that\nwas where the SS was. So they could watch us and then right over there was a house and there\nwas a Lutheran pastor living but you know there were two branches. One was the Deutsche\nChristian, the German Christians who were Nazis. And the other one was the Confessing Church\nwhich were not ____ and teachable (?) and confess. But this guy was a Deutsche Christ so there\nhe was and there was the SS and there was the Guttstadts house. But when I was, and my\nteacher was very nice. I wrote to my teacher. The last thing I sent was my wedding\nannouncement which came back said she had died. But she was very nice and she was very good\nto me. But and in the beginning I you know I really acted. I had somebody across from us was\nsome, somebody living who was very poor. It was a very old house and it was a poor house.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd, and they you know we had to pay to go to gymnasium. Not very much but we had to pay.\nAnd also to the middle school. So she was a good student and she had to go, keep on going to the\nelementary school because her parents couldn\u2019t afford it. So I went to the teacher and I said you\nhave to see that she gets a fellowship. And she did get one. But this was 36. By then you know\nthings were already difficult. And so but I didn\u2019t hesitate then to, to do that. I didn\u2019t feel like I\ncouldn\u2019t do that. And she did get her fellowship. I was very happy about that.",
        "Q: When you would see the flag with the swastika or the men in their boots and their uniforms as\na child, was that frightening also?",
        "A: We really in many ways we didn\u2019t -- the swastika you saw. You saw, my mother was always\nupset because Hitler had birthday on the 20\" of April, and she on the 21\u00b0 and on the 21\u00b0 they\nhadn\u2019t taken down these flags which was awful. And so I mean but the SS is, marching 1n boots\nand so on, we didn\u2019t really see these so much. I saw military people but in many ways I saw and\nunder Hitler in many ways and this is under a dictatorship. I mean there was a curfew. You\nweren\u2019t supposed to be out after 11:00 but in many ways it was much safer than on the other,\nother condition. Less murder and any of those things of you know between the general public.\nAnd you saw less police than you see when you go downtown in Washington. And so on. So I\nyou know and [| heard Hitler talk.",
        "Q: When you would hear him talk, on the radio?",
        "A: Oh sure, yeah or on television.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: On television?",
        "A: Mm hm. Yeah we heard him. I mean we had to listen to him. We had to know what was\ngoing on.",
        "Q: Who had an early television?",
        "A: Where did we see the television. Maybe I didn\u2019t see the, no I think I only heard him on the\nradio. And the television I saw the stuff after the war and they rerun it.",
        "Q: Maybe in a newsreel in the movie theater?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah we had always the newsreels. We had the newsreels",
        "Q: And when you would hear him?",
        "A: We, I thought he was an idiot.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: I thought he was an idiot. And then they had a power struggle one time. I remember that,\npretty much to the end of the war too. They had a power struggle. He wanted to kill Goebbels\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand Goebbels said ok, if you kill me I will talk. So three days later Goebbels was in power\nagain. But it\u2019s -- but he was, people were it was like to the, like when Beck talked. People were\nhysterical when they saw him. And then they had this idiotic saying, if your Fuhrer would know\nthat wouldn\u2019t happen. Come on.",
        "Q: Well if the Fuhrer would know all the terrible things that happened he wouldn\u2019t permit that.",
        "A: Yeah. But the people were hysterical when they saw him you know. So and, and the young\npeople you know Berlin, we had the werewolf in Berlin. You don\u2019t know the werewolf. We had\nthrough the end of, you see the five story apartment houses and the whole block because of the\nbombs, all the attics were connected so the wall was broken down. In the basement also they had\nonly one wall which you could really hit and connect so you could get out if your house was\nkicked (?). So the young guys, the 16 year old ones and so on were fanatic Nazis. And they were\nrunning around in these attics and shooting and then the Russians went in and said if you don\u2019t\nget them down then you all have to go out. And one time they did. They had their tanks set up in\ntank row [ph] and then they went down in the basements and put the women in front. And then\nthey told the werewolf ok now these are your mothers. Stop shooting. But they didn\u2019t. So there\nwent the women down again. Some of the German young people were very fanatic. And the\nGermans had these flame throwers so they throw the whole, so they shot into the first floor and\nthen the houses started to burn from the lower part up and then the Russians went down and said\nyour house is burning. You better come up. So I mean we had the Red Armies which were\nsupposed to be better than the others. They did lots of bad things but nevertheless. Nevertheless I\nknow only one girl who was raped. I only knew one girl who was raped. But in the country was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\na different matter. But we were on the border so where we lived then, behind us was what we\ncalled the Stalin order which is automatic cannons \u2014whew, whew \u2014 and so on. They were right\nbehind us. And then you know before us, they never got further there. Just the next part they\nnever got until Berlin capitulated on the second of April. So we were under fire every day. And\nthe Russians came with the little punji [ph] wagons, you know the ones they had from Siberia\nand so on. That\u2019s all they had. Otherwise, everything was made in the USA. The uniforms and\neverything was made in USA when they marched into Berlin. And we were frightened to death\nof them. Another thing is the worse than the Gestapo and all this and then you had the Russians\nwe were afraid of.",
        "Q: And the American army?",
        "A: No they never came there either. They came afterwards. You see they stopped at the Elbe.\nAt the time they came the war was over. The Russians conquered Berlin. Yeah. That was the\ncapital.",
        "Q: What did America mean to you at that point?",
        "A: Well, at this point. I mean I was glad when the Americans came. I was more, would have\nbeen more glad if I would have been in the American zone. And not in the Russian zone in\nBerlin. But you know we \u2014",
        "Q: I meant the country itself. What did the --\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Oh I loved them. My father was here with the Singer [ph] prize, you know the architectural\nprize he won. He came to the United States and studied the railroads here. And he came back\nand we had the suitcase, the attic full of stuff from America. So my father always said when you\ngrow older you know we are going to America. Not to immigrate, but to visit and so on. So my\nsister and I grew up with the love to America. But we always thought that is a wonderful dream.\nWe will never make it. So when the Americans actually came you know yeah but on the other\nhand it\u2019s before I went to physical therapy school, I had to make a practical in a hospital. So I\nwas, I thought I go to children\u2019s hospital. It\u2019s better to take a visitor (?) from the children and\nnot from the adults. So I went to children\u2019s hospital and that was bombed out so we were in the\ncountry. And then that was in the American zone. And then they had maneuvers. And then the\nAmericans had these huge tanks. And there had, I\u2019m saying houses. The tanks were as big as the\nhouses were high. And then on top there were these black soldiers. And I remember I had to\ncross the street. I had night shift and I had to go in the, cross the street to where I, where I was\nstaying you know and I was afraid of them. I was frightened to death of them. They looked\nawfully frightening. I knew they would, I didn\u2019t know. They were soldiers and so all soldiers are\nbad. Occupation army is no good. For civilians. And the Americans had the plus. You know the\nRussians had no choice. They had to rape women. The Americans said hi baby, I have chocolate.\nThey found enough girls to go with them. The British and the French were different. But the\nAmericans you know. But then you know in Frankfurt am Main in the main streets you know the\nAmericans young soldiers, they flew out of the bars drunk. I mean it\u2019s an occupation army is no\ngood. And you try not to get involved with occupation armies. Even I didn\u2019t try to get involved\nwith them.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

        "A: No, no. Yeah. But you know it\u2019s a long time ago but you know at least I will never really get\nattached to anything. And when my husband, I miss my husband very much because when he\ndied, they all said don\u2019t do anything the first year and I emptied the house and I sold it. And I, I\ntold John before. I said I like that house but I can walk out. It doesn\u2019t mean anything to me.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nWhen my sister and I for a long, long time when we talk about our house and my sister has a\ntownhouse. But when we talk about our houses. Our house in Frankfurt an der Oder, even now. I\nwill never talk about our house here or anything. Our house is the house in Frankfurt an der\nOder and we\u2019re still attached to that. And to be, to have to leave that, that was very dramatic.\nAnd accordingly is anything else you know and if people say you can\u2019t afford that. You have to\nmove in a one room apartment. Ok, I get rid of all that. And so you know people, some people\nthey say oh you know we admire you. I don\u2019t think, they don\u2019t realize that it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s nothing to\nbe admired. It\u2019s just you know doesn\u2019t mean. And also it\u2019s you know people heavily complain\nhere about the food, including me. I hate it. But on the other hand it\u2019s, it\u2019s not so if I don\u2019t go\ndown. I don\u2019t eat. It\u2019s not that important to me. You know. Yeah but that I was a good student\nand a straight A student and all that. That was important because I had to show myself that I can\ndo it too. Because Hitler always told us you know no you are no good. You can\u2019t do anything.\nYou know. So and in the beginning when I became a docent in the first, in the beginning when I\nhad to give tours you know. Miss Schats [ph] was standing there and so the tour I always said\noh please lord let nobody come. You know because I basically think I was frightened to death.\nAnd I went for an interview, I usually was there half an hour too early and walked the street to\nget my courage up. To go in for an interview and this, this stays all with you. So there are lots of\nthings that and as I said, after the war nobody ever thought about that we were in shock, that we\nneed somewhere help or anything. It\u2019s just ok it\u2019s over.

So then he\nswitched and he studied engineering and architecture. And he won the Singer [ph] prize which\nwas something which only was given out every five years. That is the prize for architects. And\nhe got it for designing Winward station and the layout of the tracks. And my father\u2019s, and I\ncouldn\u2019t find them, I looked for them yesterday. My father was with, studied at the technical\nuniversity in Berlin. And his drawings are there, all his things. And then he worked for the\nrailroad. And he designed tunnels for the railroad. There is a park between Berlin and Frankfurt\nwhere always the tracks are low and then the sights are high. And it always 1s, was sliding down.\nSo my father designed how to prevent them. And my father was very, you know all his workers\nloved him, when they tried to, when they kicked him out. The workers strike and they said we\nwant Guttstadt back but it didn\u2019t help him under Hitler\u2019s . (mumbling) .",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think all my family, as far as I know, I think that they had maybe a bat\nmitzvah, they went. But I don\u2019t think they even ate kosher or anything. It was not a very\nreligious family. That\u2019s one thing Hitler did, all my, it\u2019s a few surviving families. They are all\nnow religious Jews.",
        "A: My mother was not Jewish. My mother\u2019s family is Zemler.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Lutheran. Yeah. In Germany in general you had three you know which the state supported.\nThey took the tax out. Either Jewish, Catholic, or Lutheran. You put you know the state took the\ntax. You could say I\u2019m a member and they took the tax out. And but they were not religious.\nMy mother only went to church if she liked the minister\u2019s sermons. You know there was one\nwhen she went to the Kaiser Wilhelm gedeshne [ph] in Berlin. And then one time there was\nsomebody, the preacher, she thought she liked the sermons so then she went. But not out of any\nother conviction. And we didn\u2019t grow up, my sister and I didn\u2019t grow up religious. And so you\nknow.",
        "A: Yeah. I knew that only. In the beginning I didn\u2019t, no. I had no idea. I remember that when I\nwas in elementary school we had religious -- we went in my first year, we had religious\neducation in school. And usually the regular teacher gave the Lutheran and I had a girlfriend.\nOne of my classmates was Rosalyn, was Catholic. And she always wanted to leave and I said\nyou can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m not going home alone. You have to stay and then there were two people,\ntwo of mine and they were Jewish. And then Hannah came in and she said there were the Ten\nCommandments. Only. And she said oh you have the same Ten Commandments as we do. And\nI said, yes, why not. So I was really not aware of the difference. I thought you know that was\nsomewhere, people said they are different, but I didn\u2019t know why they said they were different\nyou know. But Frankfurt an der Oder had a very small Jewish community. And they are now\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\non the bridge, you know where you have the bridge Frankfurt an der Oder is written on it.\nThey don\u2019t have anybody and we knew them all. We knew all of them. But the ---",
        "A: We all lived in mixed neighborhood. The whole Jewish community lived in a mixed\nneighborhood. There was no ghetto, no. Or there was no area where the \u2014 no, no. They all met\nthe farm house and no.",
        "A: Yeah I was the second. My sister is older so I always was up to her age.",
        "A: Her name is Brigitta. And so my sister went to school for example, she was two classes\nabove me and so I was, we had seats. And in the middle there was a raised part. It was separated\nthe two seats. And there I was sitting. And all the teachers they all knew us. You know proper\nFrankfurt an der Oder only had 60,000 residents. So they knew. So I was sitting there. So one\nday I appeared and I was only four and I appeared at the principal and I said, and he said what do\nyou want. And I said I want to go to school. And he said when were you born? And I told him.\nAnd he said you can\u2019t go to school. You are too young. So I went home crying. Supposedly\ncrying, terrible. And it took my mother two hours to find out why I was crying. So yes, I always\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas, when we went to school they, my parents both came with me and my sister was always very\ngood in this. When my sister, my parents were there and then she went in her class. I knew the\nschool. So when I came, my parents came with me and then they called our names and said class\nA or B or C. So when they called A, my parents looked around, Ursala was gone. There was no\nUrsala around. So they went to class A. There I was sitting. So yeah and then we went was ten,\nwe went into the gymnasium in the high school. And I, no that comes later. But my mother\nwanted to come with me and I said don\u2019t dare to come with me. And she didn\u2019t. So I was, yes, I\nwas very \u2014 and so it hit me in some ways maybe harder than my sister. To be an outcast in the\nend because I also had my whole class were my friends. My sister had a few friends and she was\nstanding in the courtyard, this, at one time alone. And I said what\u2019s the matter with you. All my\nfriends are sick. They have the flu. I said no, try the other ones. No, I can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t push\nmy way between. I said, why not. And so it hit me very hard, probably more than my sister. My\nsister also could do, and so the age you see. Now let me say backtrack. In 36, I was supposed to\ngo to the gymnasium. We went four years to elementary school. And then you could stay in\nelementary school or you could go in something which we called middle school where you were\nuntil you were 16 and then you could go to the gymnasium and you got your abitorium when\nyou were 18. And then you could go to the university. But we went. My school and we were\nseparate, the boys and the girls. So in my school there were 700 girls. And from the 700 girls in\n1936, only ten percent could be either Jewish or half Jewish. So the quota was filled. And so that\nwould have meant that I couldn\u2019t go to the high school. And then one family moved to Berlin.\nSo I could get in. And then in 38, the Jewish kids were kicked out and you know after the\nCrystal Night they couldn\u2019t stay in school. But we half Jews could stay in. And my sister was\nlucky. She had in her class another half Jew. And after she did the abitorium I was the only one\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nso there were 699 kids in uniforms on Hitler\u2019s birthday. And so on I was private. It was awful. It\nwas awful. I can feel how the blacks were feeling in these cases, you know.",
        "A: Oh no I couldn\u2019t get in the Hitler Youth. Oh that was the Hitler Youth.",
        "A: No we didn\u2019t wear any uniforms in school, no we didn\u2019t. No, no, no. And then in 42 they\nkicked me out.",
        "A: Oh yeah, very.",
        "A: Oh yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Oh yeah, I read extensively and my sister and I. We both read a lot. My father used to say\nhow much you get paid for reading an hour. I read a lot and I was, I swam a lot, I bicycled. My\nfather, we were really the children of my father in many ways. My father took us both bicycling\nand my father was known in Frankfurt an der Oder with on each side on the arm, he had one of\nhis daughters. And my father really taught us a lot. He was very great. When we went on\nvacation and so at first you know we could go on vacation. He gave us a map when we were\neight and so and said now here we are and there you\u2019re going to be. Now you lead us. And so\non. So when we missed something then we said, Fati, Fati. He said but you are leading us. And\nthen he showed us. Ok that\u2019s where you went wrong so let\u2019s go back and then go where we were.\nMy father was very good. He swam very well and even you know he walked up the mountains\nthis way instead of going this way. And so he was really in good shape too. And I was, yes I was\nvery good in sports and the Hitler sport was a major subject. And one of my goals was to swim\nthe channel between France and England. Sorry I didn\u2019t get to.",
        "A: Well one of the things 1s when I went to school, we still said good morning and then our\nteacher (phone ringing). Our teacher somewhere must have told us that we had to say Heil Hitler\nin the morning. But I have no recollection of that. The teacher in, you see in January of 33 she\nmust, she is the one who told us that we had to say Heil Hitler. Now she was not a Nazi. There\nwere lots of \u2014 so but I have no recollection of that, when she ever didn\u2019t make any impression of\nme. The first thing really, we were in Silesia on vacation, my father and my mother and we two\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand this was when, in 34, when they killed so many of, Hitler killed so many you know of the\nLong Knives. And when they announced over the radio my sister and I somewhere knew my\nfather was in danger and we went right and left of him. Like we could protect him, but you\nknow we were small children.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know but we both of them, we knew that Fati was in danger. I guess \u2014",
        "A: No we were really too young to talk this, to talk that over really. I don\u2019t know. It was just I\nguess somewhere I guess my parents must have talked about it or so on. And we maybe have\noverheard some or you know and, and I know that relatives of my father called on him all the\ntime, and you know what to do. And so, so somewhere not many, we couldn\u2019t really put it in\nwords, but some way we were aware of that the, my Jewish relatives were in danger.",
        "A: OhI saw him. I saw Hitler too. He, with Hindenburg. That was when Hindenburg was still\nalive. He came to Frankfurt an der Oder and we all, all school children went there, and there was\na car, open car, and there was this old gentleman Hindenburg and Hitler. And \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

        "A: Yeah, when Hindenburg died it must have been 34 too you know. So I was really you know",
        "A: And so, so --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t feel in danger.",
        "A: No, no and this was also then in, in 35 I think is when, before you know people, the school\ngave out the forms for being for joining the Hitler Youth. And I certainly didn\u2019t get 1t because\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmy teacher knew that I was half Jewish. And then I came home and I talked to, told 1t mommy.\nAnd then mommy told me why I didn\u2019t get it.",
        "A: Somewhere, somewhere I was upset because I didn\u2019t like to be different than the other ones.\nAnd I was the only one in my class so you know I was the only one who was somewhat\ndifferent. But on the other hand it\u2019s, my classmates were not anywhere against me.",

        "A: No. My classmates didn\u2019t treat me differently. My classmates didn\u2019t treat me differently after\nthe Crystal Night either, not in high school. The ones that treated me differently were the\nteachers. Because the teachers \u2014",
        "A: No, no my teacher in elementary school was an old spinster, old lady and she was not a Nazi\nand she didn\u2019t treat my any way different. And my classmates at this point, it was it is a small\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncity. I mean it wasn\u2019t that obvious. And then in high school the teachers some way were afraid. I\nalways was a very good student and I loved to study and then my teachers were afraid to give me\ngood grades because then they were, would maybe say oh you are friendly to the Jews. But my\nclassmates were not.",

        "A: Well at this point you know that was you just tried to, at this point you had the feeling that\nmaybe you survive all that without any really bad, bad harm and so on but my father then already\nstarted to talk about people who came back, not necessarily Jews. Really more communists.\nWho came back from camps and he told us about a man who came back and had a beard and\nbecause his jaws were all broken and he didn\u2019t the family to show that and he never got\nundressed in front of his wife or anything because of that.

And then and so, in 36 they sent him a notice that he had a special position\nbecause you couldn\u2019t expect that Aryans would work with a Jew. So he had a special assignment\nand we knew about that certainly. And we and we knew that I don\u2019t know. We, we you see one\nof the things, in the beginning is we, we all had some way the feeling in Germany the number is\nthe German Jews were in many ways very bad because they were very emancipated. They were\nheld very German. And their religion was Jewish like somebody else\u2019s was Catholic or so on.\nSo many of them thought they couldn\u2019t believe that the Germans would go along with it. So\nmany of them really didn\u2019t expect that it would get that bad and the Germans would go along\nwith it. They also you know. I don\u2019t know how to say this.

Because they didn\u2019t hit our house and\nthey didn\u2019t do anything to us at this point. And but they, the Gestapo came all the time and\nlooked. And my father did all those things as you know he had one typewriter and he typed with\ntwo fingers. And he typed all the any, the underground and so on. And he had and we knew he\nhad it hidden somewhere and we didn\u2019t know where he had it hidden. And then came the\nGestapo and, you know and I always watched them.

So I would always stay to my\nhusband. And, and to my children whatever happened. So no she was very much you know she\nwas very strong. And then we had a house in Frankfurt an der Oder which was in the name of my\nhusband, or of my father.

And so we saw them and we knew where they go.\nAnd then we went to that school my sister and I. And people say well you shouldn\u2019t come and\nwe said yes we do have to come.

And a relative from my mother\u2019s side who was a religious nut but a Christian\nreligious nut, but he was not a Nazi. And he hired her and she worked in his office. He was a tax\nlawyer. And she worked there and I helped the nuns with the children.",
        "A: Partly I lived at the convent, but then my mother came to Berlin and we lived in again in\nfurnished rooms. And then the bombs started to fall. And in some ways the bombs were a little\nbit a mixed, because you see you always had to register in Germany. At the police station when\nyou moved. All the Germans had to do that. And so then so many of them were destroyed so it\nwas a little bit easier to evade them. And \u2014",

        "A: Well she showed us the letter.",
        "A: Well in some ways yes, in some ways not. In somewhere, we some way knew that Fati\nwould not come back. In some ways. On the other hand is we didn\u2019t trust anything. So 45, we\ndidn\u2019t dare to move anywhere far away from Frankfurt an der Oder because we thought maybe,\nmaybe he comes back.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: And so but on the other hand is then my sister and I were running for our lives and then the\nbombs came.",
        "A: Yeah sure we sit in the basement in the shelters and so when the bombs came and you know\nthe rations and then you know we heard the Russian cannons from around Christmas 44 and they\ndidn\u2019t\u2019 march into Berlin until April 45. We heard all the time the cannons. So in some ways you\nknow we all moved somewhere like dolls you know. You pull a leg and you move. You pull the\nother one and you move. And you just keep you are somewhere dull to pain. You know there is\nso much that you just say you can\u2019t anymore. And in 45 there really, Hitler tried to kill all the\nhalf Jews and all the Jews and all the people in the concentration camp so that nobody could say\nanything against him and soon. In April 45 the few people I knew, I still had contact to, I wrote\nfarewell letters. And I said Iam going to go. I am not going to run anymore. I just can\u2019t anymore\nand somewhere I never said yes again to life. I can you know that people get you know like when\nI moved out of my house, I said sure I can go. I can\u2019t get it\u2019s, it\u2019s very, very difficult. I try, also\nhave trouble getting people too close to me you know. It\u2019s so on. But you know you it was, on\nthe other hand you see where others are divided. You know when the bombs start falling and the\nhigh, the apartment houses in Berlin, they are burning and then the Germans were sitting in front\nwith just a little bit belongings. You felt sorry for them. They were human beings. So you were\nso divided. On the one hand is I hope that more bombs are falling and more get destroyed\nbecause then I may be surviving. On the other hand is you know you felt sorry. And, and some of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe people you know like my best friend from high school. She, my mommy\u2019s mother lived in\nFrankfurt an der Oder and she went to Frankfurt, to my grandmother and she said where is\nUrsala and my grandmother said I can\u2019t tell you. And she kept on pestering her. So finally my\ngrandmother broke down and told her. She gave her my address and then she rang the bell and\nwe usually didn\u2019t open because mommy always was a very, if a bell rang somebody will take us.\nAnd but there she was. So some of the people you know never abandoned me or my sister. And\nbut it was, but you were somewhere, you thought that either the bombs get you or the Russians\nget you or the Gestapo gets you. Or somewhere the percentage of survivors was very small. Was\nvery small. And then after the war you know, nobody ever thought that we were in shock or\nanything. Nobody helped us anywhere.",
        "A: Oh yeah, we stayed all the time. Yeah, we were together. My sister wanted to run away\nfrom the Russians and we were beating each other. And I said you are crazy to go on the\nhighway. We are going to stay and soI won. We did stay. My biggest fear then were really at\nthis point when we knew it was the end, is that the British bombs. You know they had these\nblock busters. And in the basement when the alarm was. And we were sitting with the Germans.\nNobody accost us, really. They were, the block busters. We were sitting you know my mother\nand my sister and I, we were all sitting together. I think my sister sat in the middle. And mommy\nand I on outside. And said you know these block busters, the people were blue then because\neverything burst. You know they were blue when they were hit, but there was sometimes a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nvacuum. And so when I opened my fear was always that I sat in the vacuum and mommy and\nGitta are dead. That was my greatest fear to the end of 45. Yeah, you know when \u2014",
        "A: Because all there the out there, everything burst and you leave the building. This is such a\nstrong pressure from the pressure. The block busters were also from the British. And they hit\nyou know the block buster means that is word blocks and so it was that was one of my fears you\nknow. And in 45 then I knew that the Gestapo wouldn\u2019t get me anymore. Even where govers\n[ph] said to the end 1s there is a relief army and so on which you know. And in front of us we had\nthe, for the tanks, when the tanks would go in the main streets, they would go against it, they\u2019d\nboth blow up. Except the Russian tanks were very small and they went through all the side\nstreets and never hit any of these things. And it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know you know. You were in the, in\nsome ways you were numb but on the other hand is you were not afraid of anything really\nanymore. You know it was so bad that you thought what else. You know one way or another so\nwho cares you know.",
        "A: Well we heard that afterwards, yeah. Yeah, we heard that afterwards. We didn\u2019t even know\nEva Braun existed.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: If Eva Braun existed. We didn\u2019t even know that she existed. Hitler was such a purist. He was\na vegetarian and he didn\u2019t have girlfriends and he didn\u2019t \u2014 but \u2014",
        "A: We knew that there are Jews in, we tried not to find any of them, because you see any time\nyou tried to get in contact with any of them, you endangered them.",
        "A: So you tried not, if you, you some way we were aware there were, at the Jewish cemetery in\nWeisen there were Jews hidden in these old fashioned mausoleums and the gardeners who were\nAryans, they gave them food and everything. But if you tried to any way to do anything, you\nwere afraid to engage of them. And so you know you tried not to do anything like this because\nyou hoped that nobody would find them. And if you found them, somebody else might find\nthem. Or you were also afraid that somebody might follow you and you would lead them to\nsomething. So at this point, we did not really try to find anybody in hiding because you\nendangered the Jews, but you endangered also the people who hid them. You know so you tried\nnot to find out anything about them. You knew somewhere. Well the trouble is there was always\na grapevine so you heard about things. I had contact with some Dutch underground people and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nso I knew about D Day before anybody ever admitted that the English had, that the Americans\nhad landed because that\u2019s underground. Told me that. But you know \u2014",
        "A: The Dutch underground. You know Hitler had all these, they just took cars, you know pick-up\ntrucks and drove to the factories and took all the young men in and shipped them to Germany for\nto manage the factories and so on. And the Carmelite nuns you know where I helped them with\nthe kids, until the kids were all really sent out of Berlin. These Dutch underground kids, they\nwere Catholic so they came to the convent in the evening. And they talked, they\u2019re talking.",
        "A: No, no I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: There were some yes. Yes, we did have Jewish kids hid. We had there was one woman and\nshe couldn\u2019t marry because Jews couldn\u2019t marry. And she converted to Catholicism but she was\nin Auschwitz, she survived. She survived, but her son before, her son was with her in this where\nshe, where they call collect all the Jews before they ship them out. So somewhere she contacted\nthe Catholic church and so the nuns and, they took me with them because they couldn\u2019t go alone\nas just the nuns and I looked so nice and Aryan you know with blond hair and everything. So we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwent to the apartment and there was the Gestapo and it was sealed. And so the Gestapo unsealed\nit and the nuns took out the children\u2019s clothes. And then the little boy stayed in the convent. And\nthen there was another little girl where we don\u2019t know anything about the parents. And who they\njust left 1t on the front doors. One of the problems was, with that, was that the kids itself, and\nthey went with it then. You know, there were very few children left in Berlin, because the\nschools were all closed. Because of the bombs. And so, so any school aged kid was you know I\nmean if they stayed in Berlin, they didn\u2019t have any school, they were all sent to the country. And\nso it was a little bit a problem of with older children. The smaller ones you know you could just\nkeep and you just kept them from you know you had a nun from your own and so on. But the\nmother of the little boy came back. She survived Auschwitz and she talked. And this is one thing\ntoo is that I made a big influence. Those things made big impressions on me too. Is because they\nput her into a hole and they said now if you submit to us you know they wanted to rape her and\nso on. We give you food and she said I\u2019m not hungry. And she always resisted this all.",
        "A: In Auschwitz, yeah. And so on. And so I always thought that this really, you should never\ndepend on it. People shouldn\u2019t be able to kid, because they hold this as a carrot. You know, if\nyou go with us, we give you food and we do that and I said I\u2019m never going to be dependent on\nany of that. And so on. But she survived it but she was not a Catholic after all but she collected\nher son.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t and I don\u2019t remember the little boy\u2019s name either you know and so on. And so\nbut yeah we went in that sealed apartment and the Gestapo were there, two Gestapo men and\nyeah.. and we got the clothing out. And some of them also you know they went, they got people\nout who were, I don\u2019t know who was the father of that kid in any case. But the, you know\nsometimes people went to these assemblies and got people out they knew. And so on. And the\nbad part of this was you know sometimes people went to the assembly and then they were\nhijacking you know some of the people you know, getting them away and hiding them behind\nrows of other people. And so on. But the Germans never called names. They only count\nnumbers. So if there had to be a hundred people there and there were only 98, two were missing.\nThey took anybody around. And regardless who it was. And that was another bad thing about\ngoing and hiding you know. That you always. If you could go in hiding, before you ended up in\nany of the lists, That was fine. But if you were on one of the lists and then you didn\u2019t go, you\nknow you endangered somebody else. But my sister and I didn\u2019t think about that either in\nBriesen I guess. I don\u2019t know somebody else had to go for us. Or not. I don\u2019t know. But they\ntook anybody. The number had to be correct. It was, on the other hand 1s I think technology was\nnot as advanced. So it was a little bit easier to find loopholes you know to find ways of\ndisappearing and some way managing of keeping on living. Because and as I said then, so much\nwas destroyed. Papers were destroyed too.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n(Tape 2 \u2014 RG-50.106.0184.02.03; duration: 58:32)\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Ursala Guttstadt McKinney. This is track number two and\nwe were talking about the end of the war. Mother coming back from Auschwitz. Any other\nmemories of that particular time that you can talk about.\nUrsala Guttstadt McKinney: Yeah so people came back you know. You never knew and you\nnever trusted anyone but we got the death certificate from Fati and you see my father was a civil\nservant. He worked for the Reichsbahn which is the now Bundesbahn which would be the\nfederal you know railroad system. And then when my father, when they kicked him out in 36,\nthey gave him a special assignment. And then in 38 suddenly everything was over. And so they\npaid the pension for my father. Only we never got it. The Gestapo collected it. Because the\nGerman railroad, they thought we cannot, we have no reason not to give it, to send it. We have to\nhave a disciplinary thing if he were murdered somebody or something you know. So they paid it\nand the Gestapo collected it.",
        "A: No, we couldn\u2019t, no we didn\u2019t look for him but my mother walked, my mother walked to\nFrankfurt an der Oder. She didn\u2019t dare to take Brigitta and me with her because we, this was all\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\noccupied by Russians. And she walked because there was no train or nothing. And she walked to\nFrankfurt an der Oder and looked if our house was still there.",
        "A: Unh hunh. And then she went to whatever government there were, the city of Frankfurt an der\nOder and so they knew very well that she was there, that she was alive and she was there and\nthey had her address. And my mother for a while administered the house.",
        "A: No, no, no she stayed in Berlin, because then after 45 my mother got us an apartment. But she\nwas the one who collected the rent for a while and was responsible for it. But then she gave it up.\nIt was too, you know too difficult with the east and so on. But the city of Frankfurt an der Oder,\nafter you know this is called Grumpuff [ph] in German. It\u2019s a registry for all the properties and\nthere was a first Richard Guttstadt. Then it was crossed out. Then it was Richard Israel\nGuttstadt. That was crossed out. Then there was a short rise (?) and then this was crossed out in\n45 and it became property of the city of Frankfurt an der Oder. And the person who rented then\nour house was a physician from Silesia. And he had his practice on the first floor and lived on the\nsecond floor. And so it was in very good condition because as a physician he also got electrical\nrepairs and all of that. So it was you know maintained very well. And then he died in the house.\nSomewhere in the 60s. And then a family came who rented it and they wanted to buy it. And\nthey asked the city of Frankfurt an der Oder and said look it is Western property. You know\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nWest German people who had escaped. They didn\u2019t know that it was Jewish property. They had\nescaped so and so we want to buy it. And the city of Frankfurt an der Oder said sorry. It\u2019s not for\nsale and it\u2019s not Western property. So that was our salvation. So my sister and I bought the\nhouse back. My sister got a lawyer. Through friends. And he only took 15%. Much less than the\nother outfits that. And \u2014",
        "A: After the wall fell. You know after the wall fell because and then he because then we had all\nthe papers. My mother had always a little suitcase during the war where the papers of the house\nwere in. The death certificate of my father and all that. And she carried that wherever she went.\nAnd then when my mother died in 81 I had had it. So we had all the papers and then the city you\nknow had my father\u2019s name and everything. So and we sold it to the people who wanted to buy\nit. But we didn\u2019t have all these difficulties because you see the, and for god\u2019s sake Frankfurt was\nreally destroyed too. But the registry was intact. You know because if this would all have been\ngone, then you know would have been very difficult but this was all there and you know you\ncould trace it. And so my sister and I bought the house back and then we sold it. My sister\nwanted to move back in and I said no deal. And so on. So we didn\u2019t, but we got it back, yes, and\nwe sold it to the people who had it. But, so my mother really when she went in 45 and she\nwalked to Frankfurt an der Oder, she wanted to make sure that the house is still there and she\nwanted to make sure that they know where she is. So if Fati would come, he would find us.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Pretty soon. Pretty soon. Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. When the war was over, I tried to get abitorium which was awful and I went to a school\nwhich was, we were all Jewish or half Jewish kids who wanted to finish high school. And any\ntime there was exam, we all blanked out. It was awful. We just couldn\u2019t function. And nobody\never thought that we need any help. You know one person one time said to me you know you\nare like somebody who walks around the corridor and sees an open door and runs in, in this open\ndoor and says oh no I don\u2019t want to be here. And then she keeps on running. Next open door.\nAnd you know but it never occurred to them that I really, number one I didn\u2019t know what I\nwanted to do. I never know what. You know I mean it\u2019s what, ok, the war was over. They said\nok, fine. It\u2019s over. Now you start your life again. What, how, how, how. You know so.",
        "A: No, nobody ever talked. We didn\u2019t talk.",
        "A: No we didn\u2019t talk. They didn\u2019t talk.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: We all know. I mean sometimes one said something and you realized you know they were in\nhiding and, and so on. Most of them were kids who had been in hiding. And so on. But no, we\njust we just blanked out. My sister was a little bit more lucky. She had her abitorium, so she\ncould go to the university. But I had, it was very difficult to get back to a normal life. And it kept\non you know it\u2019s -- And you felt some way you know then you felt maybe more outcast than\nbefore. Because before you were so busy trying to survive all that that you couldn\u2019t even think\nabout anything. And, and then suddenly life was supposed to be more normal again and as I\nsaid, my mother got us an apartment. And then but then you were in danger again you know\nbecause I couldn\u2019t, my sister registered with the IRO, the International Relief Organization and\nshe came over with a coal boat. You know one of those boats which brought coal over and went\nback empty. But I was, she was then had a temporary visa for West Berlin, because in 48 they\nopened the Free University in West Berlin and my sister was in the, eastern Germany had only\none university, Berlin, the Humburt [ph] University which was in East Berlin and so she could\ngo to West Berlin. And she got a temporary visa. And just she registered and could get out. But\nI was in East Berlin and any time you registered with the IRO and were in East Berlin, the\nRussians would arrest you as a spy. So you couldn\u2019t do that. So --\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Oh there were the boats, after the war which came from America where had coal in and so on.\nThey brought it to West Germany for the people. I guess it was part of the Marshall plan. And\nthen they went empty back. They had the refugees on going back.",
        "A: She went at first to the Freer University, Free University in West Berlin. And she studied\nthere. And then came, and her major was history. And there came a professor from United States\nwho was a German Jewish immigrant originally but he was in the meantime an American citizen,\nand a professor of history. And he talked to my sister and he said, I get you a scholarship to \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, so he did. So she went to Sweetbriar.",
        "A: And she had no sponsor. My sister had a sponsor the World churches were her sponsor. So\nIRO got her a sponsor which that was very impersonal.",
        "A: No that, my sister, no. That was for really, between 49 and 50 that the IRO.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Oh yeah. I said goodbye to the, when my Jewish relatives went to the concentration camp. I\nwent and said goodbye. We always knew I had all my aunts. I, when they had the papers. I know\nwhen they are going and I went there and I said goodbye and I always knew I wouldn\u2019t see them\nagain.",
        "A: Well it was very, it was very difficult because one of my aunts said to me you know I am\ngoing to go to the concentration camp because I am Jewish. I don\u2019t know why I go there, because\nI don\u2019t believe in anything. I never go to the synagogue or anything. But I am Jewish. And I felt\nso bad for her. Because I thought if she would believe in it and during, in the camps the\northodox Jews were of the best because they had the faith to set against that horror. But people\nlike her and they died off very fast because they had nothing to set against it. And I said to so\nmany of them, I said goodbye. You always knew when they went. We had a young, one of my,\none of the cousins and they had gotten (phone ringing) a baby, that. I can take it off the hook.\nThere were they all knew that they go to concentration camp. But they couldn\u2019t, they-- and\nmany of my relatives were really in Poland. You know Poland was partly German. Partly\nAustrian and partly Russian. And after the war Poland was united again. And my relatives lived\nin the German, many of them in the German part which was then Poland. After World War I,\nthey could either opt for Poland or for Germany. And they opted for Germany. And then they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwere shipped back. And but they some way we all knew that and they knew about, they didn\u2019t\nthink that they\u2019re going to labor camp or anything like that. They all knew that at least, my\nrelatives all knew that was the end. Yeah, and that young family you know who had that little\nboy Berl, and he was supposed to be born in the United States, except they didn\u2019t get in. So he\nwent.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Oh knew of this. I guess we knew about the camp. My father knew about the camp and he\ntold us about it. And I had but I, the extent of the -- I guess we only learned really of, after the\nwar, that you know how many \u2014 but we knew that they had chambers that they all, that they died\nand so on. And we knew that the, the people you know didn\u2019t, didn\u2019t have the chance to come\nback. Except very few. Some way there was a grapevines, you know and there were always\nsome people who got news out of it. You know like this one train which went into you know in\nAuschwitz, when you know they at one time Sweden\u2019s Red Cross came in and they said we\nwould, you know they put linen on the beds and everything you know to make it look good. And\nthen they said there will be a train going to Switzerland the next morning. And hardly anybody\nwent because they all, nobody believed it. But one of the Frankfurt an der Oder Jews did and it\nwent. The Germans in some ways sometimes you had a chance. And that train went almost\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nempty. Because people were afraid. They said that\u2019s a trap. And but then these people talk. So\nyou heard things and so you knew. I mean we didn\u2019t know how many camps were there. I mean\nthe number of camps and this we didn\u2019t know. And we didn\u2019t know the extent of you know how\nmany people really were, I mean we -- how many the capacity was of this. But you know there is\na place where you know there were some certain places already within Germany where they tried\nout some of these things on the mentally retarded. And so then the medical professions\nsomewhere heard about it and it went so on. So I think something to that extent, 1t was very\ndifficult to keep it completely secret. I never quite understand how people can say they never\nknew about it. I mean didn\u2019t they see the cars coming in and didn\u2019t they smell all this and so on\nyou know. The trouble is that Hitler got in power. Then the depression was and people were out\nof work. And he promised them work and he built a factory, he prepared for the war. He built\nthe Autobahn and all this. And people had money, suddenly had money. And by the time they\nrealized political wasn\u2019t everything that great, they were trapped. That\u2019s one reason I am\nsomewhat afraid for this country here. How it goes, how Beck can get so many people to come\nto his things. But so it was a bad time. And then there were so many people who really didn\u2019t\nknow any Jews. So when Hitler, when they talked about them, the -- some people believe\nanything which is written black and white. So it\u2019s very difficult and I mean there was a curfew\nafter the 20 of July when they tried to kill Hitler, Stauffenberg and these people. There was a\ncurfew. You know you could see there where before when the Jewish still before they were all\nmore or less dispersed. There were signs on parks, no Jews allowed. And so also it was very\nobvious. And people can read. All the Germans could read. There were no people who couldn\u2019t\nread. But I guess many of them, and some of the people were very daring and nothing happened\nto them. We had a high school teacher who taught us math and physics and so on. And he was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\none of these golden Papi members. You know people who joined before 33. They had a golden\nrim around, they are a party member. Party thing. And this was a real join. And they are\nenthusiastic about it. And then he sent in 38 or 39 or something around there, he sent his\nmembership back. And he said that\u2019s not the party I joined. He always kept on teaching.\nNothing happened to him, absolutely nothing. So some people, it was, they were always some,\nsome people had a loop hole or something. They went through. The majority of my high school\nteachers were not party members. But I guess I didn\u2019t have enough teachers for them to kill\nthem. It\u2019s, I mean they, when they kicked me out of school and I worked, I was walking the\nstreet in Frankfurt an der Oder, one of my former classmates which was really hundred, 300\npercent Nazi. And so was her whole family. She stopped me in the street and she said I\u2019m sorry\nthat they kicked you out. I said oh. I guess for her I was just another classmate.",
        "A: Feels awful. When I was standing I remember that one time when Hitler\u2019s birthday was, and\neverybody came in uniform, Hitler Youth uniform. Everybody. So being a member of the Hitler\nYouth didn\u2019t really mean that you were a Nazi. They were all members and I was there private.\nIt\u2019s an awful feeling. I always thought you know I would feel like I\u2019m the only black in a white\nschool. And nobody harassed me or anything, but I came home and I said mommy next time I\u2019m\nnot going. So then I started. When anything like this was going on, I didn\u2019t go.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I was afraid more than I was feeling inferior. I maybe a certain extent yes, because when I\nwent to physical therapy school you know before I emigrated to the United States, I became, I\nwent to the University of Frankfurt and became a physical therapist. And one of the things I said\nto myself, I want that the people need me. That they want me. Because before nobody needed\nme, nobody wanted me. I also went then back to the university, to American U and Catholic U\nand I got two masters degrees. And I was a straight A student and I got a summa cum laude and\nso on. And people say oh you were so ambitious. I said no. But I had to prove to myself I can do\nit.",
        "A: Yeah, that I can do it you know. So somewhere this all stuck to me all the time, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Mm hm. I went illegally to West Germany.",
        "A: Oh yes, sure. I danced. I took, I went to ballet school in Berlin. That was my big love. I\ndanced, I danced when I was in Frankfurt an der Oder and I was on the stage at the state theater\nand then they kicked me, they told me you couldn\u2019t come any more. You are half Jewish. That\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas very hard. That was more difficult for me really than to be kicked out of school because I\nloved dancing. So then in 45, I went back to ballet school. And I wanted to become a\nprofessional dancer. And so I joined a group and we traveled and this was, you know at this\npoint there was no wall. So you could go very easy from East Berlin to West Berlin and so on.\nAnd so then we went to West Germany. And every time I had to go to the police station and they\nput on that I was illegally there. And so but there was in Hamburg a woman who took pity on\nme and she was in this office where they give you housing. Because you know the cities were\ndestroyed so first you had to wait until you got something. And so she said all right, she said\nkeep in touch. Send me sometimes a postcard. So I sent her a postcard and one time I was in\nGerting [ph] which isn\u2019t too far from Hamburg and I got a postcard, come to Hamburg as soon\nas you can. I said ok so I took the train and went to Hamburg and I only went and you were so\ntrained in those things, you didn\u2019t say boo. And I only said hello. And she said oh I\u2019m so glad\nyou came because it\u2019s no good to walk around without identification card. I said mm hm, and\nthen she gave me her phone and she knew very well you know that I had this, I had an East\nGerman card in my pocket. And in this foment that I lost my identification card, 1t was not\nwritten, whether it was east or west, so I got a West German card. And at least then I could\nregister to immigrate. Because then I was legally in West Germany. I was always a little bit\nafraid then when I -- and one of my uncles in New York sponsored me. But I was a little bit\nafraid when I then registered that the Americans would find out that I\u2019m not really legally in\nWest Germany but they didn\u2019t or they didn\u2019t care. Whatever. But then you see I was legally in\nWest Germany. And then my sister was already here. And she had switched from history to\nsociology. So she became a psychotherapist. And she said you know you always liked dancing\nand gymnastics. Why don\u2019t you become a physical therapist. That\u2019s very much needed in the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nUnited States and it\u2019s really got restitution from the government. And so I did and then so I\u2019ve\nbeen, that\u2019s the reason I didn\u2019t come until 56 because I went there first and got my degree. And\nthen I worked one year because you know it takes some time before you get all the immigration\ngoing.",
        "A: No, no, no I was living Frankfurt. I was in west Germany. My mother was in Berlin. And she\nwas still in East Berlin at first and then she got a card from the post office. Oh no she was\nalready then over in West Berlin, without, she left the department, just locked it up and was\ngone. And then she got a card and it said that she and I should come to the post office. There is a\nletter which is registered. We should pick it up and we never went there because the East\nGermans were as bad as the Gestapo. And so we never went there. But then my mother was in\nWest Berlin and she got herself an apartment there and then when the wall came then she went to\nHannover because she was afraid that they would cut us, cut off from my sister and me.",
        "A: Well then I had the physical therapy degree\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: And I worked there. And then I registered here. You know I put in application and one of\nmy, of the cousins of my father Uncle Hans, he sponsored me because my sister couldn\u2019t sponsor\nme because she was just in graduate school then. And so she didn\u2019t have enough money. So you\nhad to put down $5000 in order to this. So Uncle Hans sponsored me and then I came over here.\nAnd then I stayed in Alexandria with my sister.",
        "A: She stayed back in Frankfurt, in Germany. She got the pension restored for my father. My\nmother was very good. She got us a year restoration and she wrote all these letters and so on. She\nwas very, very good in that and she got a lawyer to help her in all those things. And so on and so\nshe, and she stayed then in Germany. She came over here all the time.",
        "A: To visit but she didn\u2019t\u2019 want it. Number one the exchange rate at this point were one to four\nso her pension would have been very small. And she didn\u2019t want to be a burden and so then to\nthe end really to the end, my mother died since 95 and she said I wished I would have made the\ndecision to come because then you know we always traveled for and back you know in the fall.\nAnd I was there when she died. But she was, then she regretted it. But then she also was you see\nthe trouble is this foreign language. One of my uncles, not the one who sponsored me but one of\nmy other uncles, when he was in the Jewish home for the Aged in New York and he suddenly\nonly spoke German and he was fluent in English. And my mother was afraid that she said if I get\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsick I can\u2019t communicate. And we had a patient in, at GW where I worked as physical therapist\nwho had a stroke and he, who can speak German. Who can speak German. So you know, I said\nok so we all, he couldn\u2019t speak a word, other, except German. And then he recovered and he\nspoke fluent English. And then they all said ha, but then he couldn\u2019t. and that\u2019s, so mommy was\nvery much aware of that and she said I didn\u2019t\u2019 want to be a burden and I don\u2019t want to lose the\nability that I can communicate. She was very independent and in control. And so she didn\u2019t\nwant to have this happen to her.",
        "A: I was better in English, English than American English. It\u2019s I took, I mean I had in high\nschool English. I had, my first foreign language was French. And I had, was much better in\nFrench than in English and then the second was English and the third was Latin. But and then\nbefore I immigrated, I took English lessons again. And then I came here and I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand very well. Because English is so much easier you know the pronunciation 1s so much\nmore distinct than American. You know. But I got a job. At first I got at the office of three\nsurgeons, orthopedic surgeons and then I came to GW and so on. But you learn you know if you\nare always surrounded by it and you don\u2019t hear anything else but English it\u2019s you know you get,\nand then I also didn\u2019t make \u2014 I read books like Agatha Christie is good to read because there is\nso much dialogue in. And which is important. And one of the things you should never do, have a\ndictionary beside you. If you don\u2019t know a word look it up. Then the next time, look it up. You\nnever get anywhere. Just say ok and just content, must be something like that because if you\nalways start to do that you never get fluent.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "A: Then I met my husband.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. And he spoke uhh. I mean I could, by then I could understand that but all our\nfriends, you know when they, anybody who came over, they all had trouble to understand him\nbecause you know he speaks like that. He was, my husband is from Altoona, Pennsylvania, so\nwe also have, when we dated we were sitting at the railroad tracks watching the trains going by\nbecause his father worked for the Pennsylvania railroad and my father the German railroad. So\nwhen we came back we lived in an old house in Old Town Alexandria and then we also had\nanother roommate which was a classmate from graduate school from my sister. And she, Jean,\nand she said oh you are lying. And my sister said uh, uh I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: 58.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Oh yeah. I worked all the time. Yeah but then I went back. Physical therapy, I was a very\ngood therapist and but the trouble with physical therapy is you are involved in the whole family.\nPsychological. And you work mentally with the patient and physical, which makes it very\ndifficult. Like I had you know you, I had one patient. I worked also then for the Visiting Nurses.\nAnd so we went to the homes. And there was one lady and she lived near Dupont Circle and the\nhouse was you know several levels. And she was in the bedroom upstairs and they had put in an\nelevator you know on the stairs. And she was frightened to death and I said you can do it. I\ncome after work and we do it. And you make sure that your husband and your son is there. And\nso on. So they were. And I said ok you can do it and so we had, you had to be and she was much\ntaller than I am. And you had to be very strong to convince these people. I wasn\u2019t so sure if she\ncan. But you can\u2019t let them know. So she did and she went down. And then she had a martini\nwith her husband and her son and then we went up again. And so on. So she can do it. And then I\nflew down the stairs because I said oh I wasn\u2019t sure if we manage and so the husband said to me,\nyeah my wife told me that you don\u2019t walk down the stairs. You fly down. And so, so one time\nmy mother was there. And John and my mother and I, we went to a party and everybody was\nthere. And then they couldn\u2019t find me and I was sitting in one room. At this point I was the chief\ntherapist of the Easter Seal treatment center in Rockville. And they couldn\u2019t find me. And then\nthey found me in a room sitting on a sofa, sound asleep because you know as a chief therapist I\nalways thought if anything is I told the other therapists ok you take it easy and I took an extra\npatient. And I was just plain exhausted. So my husband then talked to the librarian at this point\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nat National Bureau of Standards. You know it\u2019s not now National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology. And he said you always loved books and so on. So I talked to her and then I took\nan exam with the civil service in translating German into English. And after that I could work as\na translator. And it was the National Bureau of Standards. And after I was finished I thought\ngosh if I would be a few years younger, I would have flunked my own native tongue because it\nwas in the old German script and I came home and I said John, they still have it in the old\nGerman script. I was -- and so on. So then I worked as a translator in the library at the National\nBureau of Standards. And I realized that you don\u2019t get anywhere in a library except you have\nthat master\u2019s degree, you can have ten PhDs or whatever. You have to have that master\u2019s degree\nin library science. So then I went to Catholic U and got the master\u2019s degree. And then I had to\nside paths because I didn\u2019t have enough, I had all these medical courses you know so I didn\u2019t\nhave enough liberal arts courses so they sent me back to undergraduate school. So I went to\nundergraduate school and in order to get it faster, I said ok I take German literature and so I\ngraduate, and art history because I had both of them back home so I said ok so I got this and then\nI went there. And then I worked as librarian yeah. And I worked at surgeon\u2019s (?) and NBS and\nthen I worked for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as the reference librarian. And I worked\nand then when I retired I worked there as a consultant. And I had all, all the foreign documents\ncoming from Vienna you know International Atomic Energy Commission and all of these places,\nyeah. But so I worked until 2005. And when my husband collapsed, I said my gosh I wished I\nhad my job back. It\u2019s the best thing you can have is ajob. You have to function and if something\nis, also as physical therapist. You know like they said really when I was with the Easter Seal I\nhad an old lady, then I thought was old. Was 80 or something. She had a hip operation and she\nwalked with a cane. And she said the doctor told me I would be like new. And here I am\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwalking with a cane. I said now if I\u2019m in your age and just have a cane, I think I would be very\nhappy. And she says you have to quit talking. You have nothing of my experience. I said you\nreally want to know. And I told her my past. And then she said oh, I think I am very happy to\nhave acane only. But you learn to smile and people don\u2019t expect that you have anything like this\nin your past. And so on. And at first I never really talked you know you didn\u2019t talk about any\ncase. And but one thing, neither John nor I could have. We couldn\u2019t have children. I couldn\u2019t put\nany, I thought it was so awful that I would never expose any child to the world. Who knows if\nnot something like this happens again. And John was drafted, was 18, and he was at the Battle of\nthe Bulge. And he came back very badly wounded. He has Purple Heart and everything. He\nlives, he is buried in Arlington and we both made the decision we don\u2019t want children, because\nhe thought it was so awful. And I thought and I always think how can all these people have\nchildren. I just, I just couldn\u2019t. I just couldn\u2019t. And I confronted my mother and one time when\nHitler was on and I said you know only because you and Fati wanted to have children, I had to\nbe born. And my mother told me that later and she said she was horrified. And so, but it was so\nawful for me you know it was so awful. And I was in school and I had classmates, and I had\nfriends, but I always knew that somewhere that it will hit me. And I just couldn\u2019t see to have\nanybody putting into the world. But most people did. And I don\u2019t know how they could manage.",

I just,\nyou know when and mommy\u2019s family was you know they were all mommy\u2019s, my mother had\none brother and they were very close. And when Fati died, he refused to see her. And it was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nawful. So when he died, John and I were actually in Germany and I, it was awful for my mother\nreally but I said I can\u2019t go to the funeral.

I don\u2019t feel that I have to\nhold this all against them. They were not even alive then. I don\u2019t think they have to apologize\nwhat their parents did. You know.

And Loni and they are now all going to the synagogues and we go to the bat mitzvahs\nand all these things when it happens in their family. And they have Jewish weddings and\neverything certainly. But Loni said we never prayed for the Jews in Germany. I said you didn\u2019t.\nNo we never did. And then I feel you can\u2019t get mad at some -- I feel that they wanted us in\nGermany. Yeah. And it was almost impossible to come out. But see, you know the people who\nwent over the Himalayas, like the widow of Mahler, the composer and so on. All these, the top\npeople. They got out. But the little ones, the Jews, they were stuck.

So are they better? And the\nUkrainian guards in the camps were worse than the German guards. But nobody sees anything\nabout it. So sometimes you know it\u2019s \u2014 I think and the whole world looked on. And America\ndidn\u2019t go in the war until much later. By then everything was rolling.

I\u2019m not really Jewish. And I\u2019m not really\nthere either so all my life I have been struggling somewhere between. I feel closer to the Jews\nbut Iam not really, I don\u2019t know.

It\u2019s and\nI would just break down and cry. And it was just too painful. And by now I think number one it\nis longer ago. And number two is I also think is that if my generation dies off, there is nobody\nreally anymore who can talk about it. And so we should just overcome that and just do talk about\nit.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And so on but it\u2019s you know something that will haunt you for the rest of your\nlife. And it\u2019s nothing which 1s easy to overcome anywhere. That\u2019s one reason is that I\u2019m you\nknow surprised that people could put children in the world. I couldn\u2019t. I thought that was too, too\ndamaging. It was too bad. And you know and when politic -- people are not aware of it. And that\nis a danger in always that people say oh political, it isn\u2019t so bad yet. Maybe, maybe we still can\ntake that and so on. And by the time they realize that they can\u2019t take it anymore very often\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\npeople are trapped. And then they really can\u2019t do anything anymore. But you know with\nGermany too, is talking about Germany when I worked, when I was studying physical therapy in\nFrankfurt at the University of Frankfurt am Main, we also had to go in to different hospitals and\nthere was this psychiatric ward and where they had to, you know locked us in the therapists and\nwe played ball with these men and so on. It was all the women\u2019s ward. And one time I came\nthere and they were very excited and I said what, what\u2019s the matter. And I said, oh a Jew comes\nback from Germany. From United States. And I said so, yeah. We don\u2019t want a Jew. I said now\nhe might be very nice. We don\u2019t want a Jew. I said no, how many Jews do you know? You\nknow and I said oh, how can you say that you don\u2019t want him. And when he came, he was very\nnice. And you know people came back. They were not, not everybody made it and the German\ngovernment gave them money. So he came back and he got insurance and they paid for him. And\nhe was a very quiet, calm man. You know somewhere, somebody who was not very assertive\nand so on. Because, and he hadn\u2019t made it in the United States. So he was very depressed and\nhad problems. And everybody loved him. And I said oh. But then they didn\u2019t want to hear any\nmore what they once told me that they couldn\u2019t stand having one. But again, but then these\npeople believed you know whatever the government tells them because they really didn\u2019t know\nbetter. And then you know sure the schwarzes [ph] didn\u2019t help either in anything either. So it\u2019s\nalways difficult you know.

Then they don\u2019t ask\nme anything. No, they don\u2019t. Right after the wall fell I got lots, there came people over from East\nGermany, formerly East Germany. And one of the women one time said to me you know when\npeople realize that we are German, it\u2019s like a curtain goes down. You know there are lots of\nAmericans who are still very much anti-German. And you can see it in our whole collection. If\nyou go to the German collection, it\u2019s awful. We have some Durers and so on but I don\u2019t find\nthere are any good Durers and so on. So the people who collected at this point they also didn\u2019t\nwant to collect German art.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

        "A: One of the things is I guess for many people that is a relief. For me, neither my mother nor\nmy sister nor I ever have tried to find the Gestapo people who hunted us. My father was killed.\nThey ruined my life to a certain extent. Chasing down these people wouldn\u2019t do anything for\nme. I always thought if I would have to gotten these people on a trial, maybe somebody else did,\nI don\u2019t know. But if I would, it would be more horrifying for me to have sit through that trial\nthan would have done me any good because the damage was done. And so the Eich\u2014you know\nI mean he was a horrible guy and I guess justice was done. But it\u2019s the people. You can\u2019t undo\nanything with the revenge. When the people talk about 9/11 that was awful, but trying to now\nthey say oh they should give us all so much money for this and so on. It doesn\u2019t bring you the\nloved ones back. I mean if you are left as a widow and have small children for god\u2019s sake sure,\ngive them a pension. And give the kids that they can go to school and so on. But revenge kills\nyourself. And so I think from (phone ringing) for many people it\u2019s a relief, but for me, I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "A: In the beginning John and I, we saw every war movie. I saw every movie on the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nconcentration camps. We felt you know people who didn\u2019t go through that lived in a different\nworld than we did. But by now it\u2019s you know the whole generation, the younger ones, they\nnever experienced anything like this. It\u2019s, I mean I think I personally would never serve in the\narmed services. I would never shoot against anybody. But I would, it\u2019s certainly in some ways\neasier to be with people who have similar experience than I do. Than with people who don\u2019t\nhave any idea what went on. But the majority of the people I meet you know they don\u2019t, they\nread it in books.",

Somewhere I feel like I started off on the first floor and I don\u2019t have a\nbasement. And you know I never went to elementary school here. Things were very different\nwhen I arrived here in Alexandria. It was so different to anything I had experienced or ever seen\nin my life. It\u2019s not easy to live, to leave your country. In some ways you know if I would have\nstayed in Germany, no war, no Nazis, or nothing I would have had a very nice house, I would\nhave gone to the university. I would have studied in Germany at this point. I could have become\nan engineer, even as a woman. I would have studied, I would have become a professional\nperson. And then I would have traveled and I would have a good life. We had enough money to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nso I could have had a good life. And it would have been much easier. So but I mean it\u2019s to\nimmigrate is hard. To move into a different country and Americans are very nice. So long as you\ndon\u2019t compete with them. When I went to AU I, one time I went to the English, you know I had\nto take English One. I was then, I didn\u2019t have to take English Two, but I went and talked to the\nEnglish professor and she said well people like you become, she was not against me but she told\nme. She said people like you we can\u2019t discriminate against. We can\u2019t discriminate against the\nblacks. They are all up in arms. We can\u2019t discriminate, but people like you.

And I said well one semester they flunk a nun because they\ncan\u2019t see the forest because of the individual trees. The next semester they flunk an immigrant. In\nmy class is no nun. So I am the victim. Never since the 70s.",

I applied for a job as a physical therapist for the\nvisiting nurses, and there was, they had to, interviewed me was a nurse who was a spinster who\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas not married. And so on. So then when I came home, I said John that\u2019s a job I don\u2019t get. He\nsaid why not. And I said well one thing she told me. There you are.

Now you know things are unfortunately so\nbad you know with all the fighting and all that. But you know that Israel, the Jews had to go\nsomewhere and it was the most logical thing to go to Israel.

Well they knew each other as children.\nThere was a playground in Berlin and my parents, both parents went, were members of it and the\nGuttstadts were on the board and so on.

You know the trouble 1s too is when you give anything to 1t you know. My\nsister is a member of the Beck Institute and you know we looked up some of the, where some of\nour relatives ended up who went to Theresienstadt and out because Theresienstadt didn\u2019t have\nany gas chambers.

And yeah there is Eistadt [ph], you know the quote, this is in\nEnglish. I mean they wrote it in German. He wrote about all the different ways how they died in\nthe camps too. Not everybody died you know in the gas chambers. There are other ways to kill\npeople too. So I don\u2019t 100% know how my father died. But I have a pretty good idea. But so\nit\u2019s, but people \u2014 and that people could you know many of these SS people who were at camps\nthey went home to their family. They were good family fathers. They had dogs and kids and\nthen they turned around and did that. It\u2019s a same as what some of our soldiers did in Iraq right.\nAnd what did we do to the some of the people.

And for\nmost people, probably, I mean you can\u2019t, I haven\u2019t tried it, but any time you would talk to any\nGerman about it then they would immediately tell you how bad it was during the war with ration\ncards and bombs falling on your head and all that and people tell you how bad it was to shut you\nup. They also had told in the 50s a joke. The Volkswagen. How many people go ina\nVolkswagen, four Germans and one Jew. The Jew 1s in the ashtray. One of my classmates in\nphysical therapy school told me that. But then we were too from East Germany. They didn\u2019t trust\nus either. They thought that we were spies. So depends to whom you speak. And if you don\u2019t\nsay anything, that\u2019s it. And it was awful. You know after the war. The rats were that big. And\nthe people were lying in the streets. They ate on them you know. I mean there was, you walked\nalong the streets and there was a pipe coming up and people were living under earth because it\nwas all destroyed. I mean it was horrible. You know. We went, you know you just stepped over\ndead bodies. You know. We went, mommy, my sister and I that was before the war was over.\nYou know Potsdam was like Dresden, declared an open city but nevertheless the Americans\nbombed it and so we went by train. We went in and then we had to, last we had to walk. And\nthere were all these bodies lying there and I faint. I\u2019m not very good in seeing blood. But\nnevertheless there was life, there was hens (?), there was something there and you just kept on\ngoing. I have to go there. It was just meant. And sure it was awful. It had nothing to do with the\nHolocaust. It was the war. And it was awful. And these were people, not soldiers. They were\njust civilians. You know they had train (German word?) which was one of the suburban trains;\nso that\u2019s awful yeah. So war, I don\u2019t believe in war. I always tell people it 1s sanctified murder.\nI don\u2019t like it. And you know I can understand, when these guys and they\u2019re all trigger happy\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nyou know. I mean either you or me. It\u2019s better you and not me. Human beings want to survive. I\nmean the people who survived in the concentration camps had a very strong will to survive. And\nso religious, the orthodox Jews had the plaff [ph]. And the communists. The murderers were the\nbest because they didn\u2019t care what happened. You know they helped. The ones who caved in\nwere the elite. The university professors, the doctors and all these people. They couldn\u2019t cope\nwith that. They were also the ones who informed. You know if they saw anybody, a Jew or\nanybody anywhere they were informing. They were frightened to death for their own life. The\nlaborites and the communists and so on. They were much more helpful. When I was very\ndepressed there. I went to the northern part of Berlin where all the laborers work and so on and I\nfelt much more secure there.

But this guy was a Deutsche Christ so there\nhe was and there was the SS and there was the Guttstadts house. But when I was, and my\nteacher was very nice. I wrote to my teacher.

In the basement also they had\nonly one wall which you could really hit and connect so you could get out if your house was\nkicked (?). So the young guys, the 16 year old ones and so on were fanatic Nazis. And they were\nrunning around in these attics and shooting and then the Russians went in and said if you don\u2019t\nget them down then you all have to go out. And one time they did. They had their tanks set up in\ntank row [ph] and then they went down in the basements and put the women in front. And then\nthey told the werewolf ok now these are your mothers. Stop shooting. But they didn\u2019t. So there\nwent the women down again. Some of the German young people were very fanatic. And the\nGermans had these flame throwers so they throw the whole, so they shot into the first floor and\nthen the houses started to burn from the lower part up and then the Russians went down and said\nyour house is burning. You better come up. So I mean we had the Red Armies which were\nsupposed to be better than the others. They did lots of bad things but nevertheless. Nevertheless I\nknow only one girl who was raped. I only knew one girl who was raped. But in the country was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\na different matter. But we were on the border so where we lived then, behind us was what we\ncalled the Stalin order which is automatic cannons \u2014whew, whew \u2014 and so on. They were right\nbehind us. And then you know before us, they never got further there. Just the next part they\nnever got until Berlin capitulated on the second of April. So we were under fire every day. And\nthe Russians came with the little punji [ph] wagons, you know the ones they had from Siberia\nand so on. That\u2019s all they had. Otherwise, everything was made in the USA.

        "A: Well, at this point. I mean I was glad when the Americans came. I was more, would have\nbeen more glad if I would have been in the American zone. And not in the Russian zone in\nBerlin. But you know we \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Oh I loved them. My father was here with the Singer [ph] prize, you know the architectural\nprize he won. He came to the United States and studied the railroads here. And he came back\nand we had the suitcase, the attic full of stuff from America. So my father always said when you\ngrow older you know we are going to America. Not to immigrate, but to visit and so on. So my\nsister and I grew up with the love to America. But we always thought that is a wonderful dream.\nWe will never make it. So when the Americans actually came you know yeah but on the other\nhand it\u2019s before I went to physical therapy school, I had to make a practical in a hospital. So I\nwas, I thought I go to children\u2019s hospital. It\u2019s better to take a visitor (?) from the children and\nnot from the adults. So I went to children\u2019s hospital and that was bombed out so we were in the\ncountry. And then that was in the American zone. And then they had maneuvers. And then the\nAmericans had these huge tanks. And there had, I\u2019m saying houses. The tanks were as big as the\nhouses were high. And then on top there were these black soldiers. And I remember I had to\ncross the street. I had night shift and I had to go in the, cross the street to where I, where I was\nstaying you know and I was afraid of them. I was frightened to death of them. They looked\nawfully frightening. I knew they would, I didn\u2019t know. They were soldiers and so all soldiers are\nbad. Occupation army is no good. For civilians. And the Americans had the plus. You know the\nRussians had no choice. They had to rape women. The Americans said hi baby, I have chocolate.\nThey found enough girls to go with them. The British and the French were different. But the\nAmericans you know. But then you know in Frankfurt am Main in the main streets you know the\nAmericans young soldiers, they flew out of the bars drunk. I mean it\u2019s an occupation army is no\ngood. And you try not to get involved with occupation armies. Even I didn\u2019t try to get involved\nwith them.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: By boat.",
        "A: United States, it was called the United States.",
        "A: Yeah, there were two. America and United States. Both American boats.",
        "A: Anything you can think of.",
        "A: No, no. Yeah. But you know it\u2019s a long time ago but you know at least I will never really get\nattached to anything. And when my husband, I miss my husband very much because when he\ndied, they all said don\u2019t do anything the first year and I emptied the house and I sold it. And I, I\ntold John before. I said I like that house but I can walk out. It doesn\u2019t mean anything to me.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nWhen my sister and I for a long, long time when we talk about our house and my sister has a\ntownhouse. But when we talk about our houses. Our house in Frankfurt an der Oder, even now. I\nwill never talk about our house here or anything. Our house is the house in Frankfurt an der\nOder and we\u2019re still attached to that. And to be, to have to leave that, that was very dramatic.\nAnd accordingly is anything else you know and if people say you can\u2019t afford that. You have to\nmove in a one room apartment. Ok, I get rid of all that. And so you know people, some people\nthey say oh you know we admire you. I don\u2019t think, they don\u2019t realize that it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s nothing to\nbe admired. It\u2019s just you know doesn\u2019t mean. And also it\u2019s you know people heavily complain\nhere about the food, including me. I hate it. But on the other hand it\u2019s, it\u2019s not so if I don\u2019t go\ndown. I don\u2019t eat. It\u2019s not that important to me. You know. Yeah but that I was a good student\nand a straight A student and all that. That was important because I had to show myself that I can\ndo it too. Because Hitler always told us you know no you are no good. You can\u2019t do anything.\nYou know. So and in the beginning when I became a docent in the first, in the beginning when I\nhad to give tours you know. Miss Schats [ph] was standing there and so the tour I always said\noh please lord let nobody come. You know because I basically think I was frightened to death.\nAnd I went for an interview, I usually was there half an hour too early and walked the street to\nget my courage up. To go in for an interview and this, this stays all with you. So there are lots of\nthings that and as I said, after the war nobody ever thought about that we were in shock, that we\nneed somewhere help or anything. It\u2019s just ok it\u2019s over. Now start again.",
        "A: No.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Yeah but then you know I thought how can I talk to any American psychiatrist. They haven\u2019t\nexperienced it. I don\u2019t have anything in common with them. You know or even a Jewish\npsychiatrist. I would only have, can talk to somebody who went through the same. And then this\nperson might not want to talk to me. Because it would be too difficult. You know. So it\u2019s, no I\nnever did and I think, considering all, I think I did very well.",
        "A: No we got, the \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no we don\u2019t. No. We got money. Yeah my mother established that she got the pension\nback from my father. And then you know we got the house back and you know we divided the\nmoney for us. And, in the beginning yes, on this one you see that\u2019s the one reason is although\nthe state said loan because I took the money to go to the university in Germany. And so on. And\npaid my trip over here. To come over here and everything and so on but no we don\u2019t get\nanything from the \u2014 we both get something similar to the social security for Germany. But this 1s\nbecause I worked there. And they recognize our education. They recognize my sister\u2019s university\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ntime and that. And the time she worked during the Nazi time for this lawyer. And the daughter of\nthis lawyer she went to a lawyer in Germany and gave the, said that you know yes my sister\nworked there and all that so she established that. And, and I went you know and I get \u2014 so we\nboth get it but we say it\u2019s very small and with the exchange rate it doesn\u2019t amount to much. But\nwe both get a small amount from the social security in Germany. Understaten [ph] but that is\nreally all. No we don\u2019t get the government, no, no. and I can\u2019t but I know some people who have\napplied for German citizenship, Jewish people.",
        "A: Because they think they\u2019re old, because they never officially wanted to give it up. But one\nwas the daughter of a, of two immigrants. So I don\u2019t know how she feels about it. I will never\ndo that. I would never try to get German citizenship.",
        "A: I don\u2019t want to have any German passport. No. No. As I said and it\u2019s still somewhat difficult\nfor me to go to Germany. It\u2019s, I mean I\u2019m ok when I\u2019m with people I know and so on but when\nI\u2019m in the train, I sit there and read an English book like I can see words in and so on and\nit\u2019s and I definitely don\u2019t want my German citizenship back, no. I mean if I would consider to go\nback to Germany, I would get better health insurance. But I don\u2019t think I want to do that.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I can criticize the Americans when I\u2019m here. But when I\u2019m in Germany I can\u2019t\ncriticize them. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t. But it\u2019s remarkable you know when you think what the Germans\ndid after the war and they are hardworking and but then I think half of the American population\nis German. You know lots of them. For a while there was a question which language they would\ntake. English or German and I\u2019m still I\u2019m in all this, so you know and my husband was very\nAmerican. He was very much. I remember when we went over to England and we passed the\nStatue of Liberty, he had to get up and he had to see that. Meant a lot to him. And so on, no he.\nAnd you know we went to the World War II memorial opening and everything yeah. Mm hm.\n"
