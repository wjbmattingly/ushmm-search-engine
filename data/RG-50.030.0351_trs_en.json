And my other sister was home with her, nine\nyears old boy, and my other brother two years older from me, he was a rabbi. He was still a\nyeshiva bocher*, and that was my family.",
        "Q: Was your lifestyle fairly comfortable? Do you have good memories?",
        "A: I would say I was loved by everybody because I was the youngest. So usually I was spoiled.\nAnd I never forget Shabbos\u2019. We had one chicken, divided for two meals. Friday night and\nSaturday lunch, one chicken. So one of my sisters gave me always her portion of the white meat,\nand I spread it on the plate it should be big that I had plenty meat. But it was \u2014 vegetables, we\nhad plenty. And potatoes, we had all the time ready in the back yard. And meat, we had once a\nShabbos, as I said. White bread, challah, was also once a week, but was Shabbos. And fish, my\nbrother couldn't forgive me, forgive himself. We had the river in the back of our yard, and we\n' Orthodox primary school (Yiddish)\n4 ritual bathhouse (Hebrew)\n> Hebrew school teacher (Yiddish)\n4 yeshiva student.\n\u00b0 the Jewish Sabbath (Yiddish)\nwent only for the fish Friday, /\u2019koved Shabbos\u00ae. We were poor, but very proud. She didn't want\ncharity. My brother who was nine years old, my mother took him to the cheder, and he ran\naway. So the teacher says, \"Mrs. Greenfeld\u2019,\" he says in Yiddish, \"I know you're not \u2014 you don't\nhave money. Your husband is in the war, but we will pay for your son. He has to be in the\ncheder, a family like you.\" And my mother said \u2014 they said, \"We will pay for him.\" My mother\nsaid, \"No, I don't want paying, but I take my son every time.\" Honest, very honest, decent\npeople. Everyone in my family. My father is \u2014 when the war broke out, he went to the Sarajevo,\nand he was captured there after the war. And my mother raised all the eight children by herself.\nShe struggled, she went away early morning, and she left me, I remember, a year old, with a\ngypsy who fed me. So life was very difficult for her. We never had white bread, I don't\nremember. Just vegetables and food . . . and potatoes, that was free.",
        "Q: Now, you \u2014 so then you went to school in Trebisov?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: To a public school? To a Jewish school?",
        "A: I went to public school. I finished the first year the seventh grade. That's the first time they had\nseven grades. Before, they had only six grades. And I went also a must, everybody who is there\nhas to go to Jewish school, study, everybody. And they are graded to be the public school. I\nwent till I was 13. To the Jewish school, Hebrew, but they didn't \u2014 Jewish, they just studied\nhistory. Jewish history. We didn't study Hebrew, just, read and write, but we never know what\nit says. We didn't understood the Hebrew language. But we had to know history in Czech\ninterpretation. Czech was my school.",
        "Q: I'm sorry. I'm a little confused. You went to a Czech school and a Jewish school?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And was the Jewish school for girls, or girls and boys?",
        "A: Together. Jewish school was together, and so it was also the public school for everyone 1n one\nroom.",
        "Q: Did the Jewish people in your town mix with the non-Jewish people?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. You felt like one family. Everybody knew you by the first name. Everybody\nsaid \u201chi\u201d to you.

But\nthere was no violence. Nobody hurt each other. We never heard of anybody killing each other at\nall. They were very, very friendly.",
        "Q: Were you personally aware of any anti-Semitism other than those signs?",
        "A: No, really not in my youth. No. Everybody kissed me, in fact, my friends, my roommates. And\neverybody I had a good relationship with them until the Nazis came. And then I heard that one\nof my school mates, my brother was hiding already, so he find him in the woods and hit him,\ntook his shoes off, and gave him over to the policeman. That was my school mate's husband I\nused to kiss all the time.\u201d",
        "Q: What year was that?",
        "A: That was \u2014 when it happened? Well, when I came back I was told, I wasn't home yet, no.",
        "Q: Were there Zionist organizations, different political organizations .. .",
        "A: Yeah. Yes. When I was young, when I said my father died early when I was only 13 years old.\nHe was 52. And so my mother's brother, he was a schochet\u00ae and a cantor in Prievidza, a \u201cstatus\nquo\u2019,\u201d and a modern city. So he took me to his place and I enrolled right away to be a Shomer!\u201d.\nShomer, it's a Zionist organization for Israel, for Israel, and they have those Kibbutz, free, no\nmarriage and stuff like that. But it's pro-Israel, and then when I came home, 16, I enrolled in the\nJabotinsky'! group, you know. Fight for Israel, even with munitions, but fight for Israel. I met\nin fact, Jabotinsky, I met him in KoSice, in a bigger city. They had a convention, and my brother,\nalso. We went together. I have a picture with him.",
        "Q: What was your impression of him?",
        "A: Of Jabotinsky? He was a rusky \u2014 a husky, tall man and he was very strong with his conviction\nand I liked him. Because what he said was so powerful all the time, that Israel has no place \u2014\nnot to be \u2014 Israel has a place, now to be independent. They should fight for it, and that was all\nwhat I wanted to have in that time.",
        "Q: Now, how much were you aware of Hitler and Nazism before the war started in Slovakia?",
        "A: Before the war started in Slovakia, for me it was in 1939 when the Nazis invaded\n*\u201c she used to kiss the girlfriend (the wife)\n8 kosher butcher (Yiddish)\n\u00b0 Status Quo Ante, independent religious communities that attempted to retain\na traditionalist stance after the schism between Orthodox and\nNeologist Hungarian Jews in 1868-69.

And\nso they left everything that night in 1939 and came to my mother to Slovakia, so we knew it's\ntrouble. And then we got right \u2014 yeah? And we then got right away a letter after that from my\nsister in Galanta, who was then occupied, like Hungary. And she had to leave everything in half\nan hour with eight children, and they took them to some camp. And nobody heard from them\nsince then.",
        "Q: Let's stop for a moment because there's a truck noise. [Pause] Before the Czech territory was\noccupied, were you aware of what was going on in Germany?",
        "A: Yeah. Because we heard Hitler on radios. We called him \u2014 barked like a dog; he didn't talk\nbecause he has a rudeness in him. That even my \u2014 everybody thought he's barking, he's not\ntalking. Yeah, we heard about him. That's the way we knew what's going on, but we never\nthought about was Auschwitz. No, I didn't know in that time that 1t was Auschwitz there. Just\npersecution, kicked them out. My sister who was there for 30 years, she didn't have citizenship,\nso she had to leave in half an hour. Nobody needed citizenship, so we knew it's troubles. We\nknew. But not in that, in that \u2014 how you say it? In that end, you know.",
        "Q: You probably didn't think that what was happening in Germany was necessarily going to happen\nto you.",
        "A: Oh, no. We didn't \u2014 no, we couldn't believe it, no. We couldn't believe it. They were such, such\nunbelievable things. In my backyard I saw girls going in that frail!\u2019 train and they waved to me\nbecause they knew they had to pass my house. They didn't see me because I was hiding there,\nbut they still knew Iam someplace. In that small place everybody waved because they knew\neach other, and I had a little store, millinery store. So everybody knew me in that village, in that\ncity. But we never thought that Auschwitz was the answer for those deportations.",
        "Q: Now, you said that in 1939 was when you really became aware of all of this because your sister\nhad to leave, and she came home. At what point did things start changing in TrebiSov?",
        "A: Well, it was the professional jobs were taken away from Jews.",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: In 1939 it started automatically, little by little. And then they had those swastikas. And I had in\nthis a sign in my store, \"Jew.\" Everybody had to put in their store a sign that was from the\n12 March 15, 1939, the Moravian city of Brno falls under Nazi occupation as\npart of the \u201cProtectorate Bohemia-Moravia.\u201d Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v.\n\u201cMoravia.\u201d\n13 frieght.\nbeginning that they should boycott us. And that was always the sign that \u201cdon't talk to them\u2019. It\nwas dangerous. And then it was curfew 8 o'clock till 5 in the morning, or 6 o'clock at night till 5\n\u2014 8 inthe morming. Maybe something like it. You couldn't get out. Traveling was restricted.\nYou couldn't go anyplace. And... if you had friends \u2014 you always made connection before with\nfew Christians. My mother went for milk six miles, they gave it to her. They're not supposed to\ngive her, she was kosher, so they give her. So that kind of contact with food, milk and butter\nthey give her in secret. Only secretly they could do that. But it was just impossible to describe\nthe horrors which was there all the time. But from beginning, as I said, that was the beginning of\nthe troubles, of the tragedies. Denied jobs, kicked them out, and you couldn't possess anything.\nThe money or whatever you had, the savings you had to give them-in. People were hiding, like\nmy mother was hiding someplace. Nobody knew it, I never find it after the war. They were\nhiding [ed comment: hiding, not themselves but their money and valuables] in basements or\nunder the ground or someplace, if they had some valuables.",
        "Q: So you're saying that this happened really in the beginning as soon as Slovakia became an\nautonomous \u2014 a satellite of \u2014 autonomous but yet a satellite of German\u2014",
        "A: Hlinkova Garda\u2014\"*",
        "Q: All of these problems started right away?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, were you able to keep your business?",
        "A: No. No, I had to close it, but I worked at home in my house, as I said, secretly. I had few nice\ncustomers. Peasants don't wear hats yet. They just started. So we had a factory, a sugar factory.\nSo the professional people, they were there. Only they wear hats. And then we had a soldiers\u2019 \u2014\nhow you call it? A barracks for soldiers, soldier station. So they had officers, those were my\ncustomers, the elite. So few \u2014 I made good friends, they came to me, but it was in secret. You\ncouldn't do it. Both ways, she would be .... She is a Czech, so they didn't think too much. She\nwasn't so scared, because she had the power.",
        "Q: Was this a frightening period?",
        "A: Oh, my gosh, yes. We were frightened. You never knew what happens to you. You never knew\nwhen you go out what happens to you. Very frightened. Very, very horrible time.",
        "Q: Were there acts of violence against the Jewish people?",
        "A: Not in my time yet. No, no. Just the scary part was that they announced, who knows Jews, they\nshould report them. That was by itself a signal, you know, be careful, if you talk to them or if\nthey talk to you \u2014 treat you the same as the Jews \u2014 the concentration camp.

        "Q: So were Jews being taken anywhere? Were Jews being rounded up or anything in this period of\ntime?",
        "A: It was \u2014 I never heard anybody who would do it and anybody who would violate anything in that\ntime. Because it was already that time when they took the boys. The boys were not there\nanymore. Single boys, first, who were not married. And then they took men even they were\nmarried, and so there were no men in the city, in the place anymore. And girls they had also\nordered \u2014 the way I said behind my house, I saw the freight with kids, they waved to me, so that\nwas the last transport for girls.",
        "Q: Now, when you say they took the boys, they took them then, who is \"they\" and how did...",
        "A: Oh, the Hlinkova Garda who was charge, the Hlinka\u2019\u00b0 was a priest but he was in charge of the\nHlinkova, of the organized like Nazi soldiers. They called them Hlinkova Garda. And they were\nin charge and they did everything like the Nazis did. They had orders from the Nazis, so they\ntook first the single men. And then they took the even married men, only men. And the wives\nwith children were still home when I left.",
        "Q: When did these deportations start, do you remember?",
        "A: Well, it was the tragic part for girls, as the boys went first to labor camp, as my brother went.\nAnd that was \u2014 from 1939 it went on, but from 1939. And for girls, it was in 1942.",
        "Q: When you say they took them, did they come into the town and round people up? How did this\nhappen?",
        "A: They reported them. You have \u2014 no, they get \u2014 you had \u2014 they had to report to the authorities.\nThere was an announcement made, you have to report all the boys, single come here and here.\nAnd then they are going to labor camp, but it wasn't. They were going, already, to the end, they\ntake them anyplace; we didn't know where. There just was no Jew anymore in the city in that\nplace where I was. No more Jewish boys left and no men. And that was my last time that I was\namong the last to survive there still hiding. When my friends, as I said, they waved to me, you\nknow, that they are in that transport. They had to report, and I didn't report. I didn't go to report.\nEvery single girl had to come to report, and so they took them away. But I didn't, so I went\nhiding first, and then I escaped, you know, at Pesach\u2019\u00ae.",

        "A: I'm not there yet.",
        "Q: Was there a period at which point you all had to go into some sort of a ghetto?",
        "A: Not in my place. Not in my place. No, there was just curfew.",
        "Q: And where \u2014 were you with part of your family still, or living alone, or living with your mother?",
        "A: I still lived in my mother's house with my mother and my rabbi, brother-in-law [ed comments:\nrabbi and brother-in-law is the same person] and his wife. They came from \u2014 and my sister, who\nhad a nine-years-old boy and my brother. We all still lived together. I was hiding under the\nporch, but they were looking, searching for me, the policemen. The Hlinkova Garda came to\nsearch for me, and I heard them above my head, the steps, how they walk and three times in the\nrow. So my brother-in-law and my mother all gathered us together and they said, \"You come up\nfrom your hiding place. There is no way you can escape here if you hide. They will find you.\nIt's three times in the row, and you cannot survive. You cannot stay here.\" So they all decided\nfor me that I should go away that same night to Budapest. And my brother-in-law who was a\nrabbi, he put his hands on me, it was in Pesach and he benched [Ed. Comment: bench \u2014 to bless\n(Hebrew) |me, you know, \u201cMalkele, du kenst alles machen.\u201d\"\u201d For life, you can violate all the\nregulations, Jewish religion or no religion. So that was that night in Pesach.",
        "Q: In 1942?",
        "A: 1942. When I went with that boy, 13 years old, who did not go the day before with his family,\nwith his friends. They arranged the day before to go away with that boy who came back.",
        "Q: I want to stop you because I want to make sure I understand. The rest of your family who was at\nhome with you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: They didn't go, but they thought you should go?",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: Why is that?",
        "A: You know, I am puzzled now. I really am so puzzled. My brother who was in labor camp,\nforced labor, he escaped and came home. Because I saw him before I left, I don't how he\nescaped from there. He was maybe 50 miles away. And he came home; they told me I should\ngo, but nobody went. Everybody stayed. My brother stayed; my sister with the child. Nobody \u2014\nI don't know. I can't explain. I'm puzzled now why they didn't do it.",
        "Q: What did your brother tell you about the labor camp?",
        "A: He said it was just horrible. They let them dig stones in mountains just for a reason that they\nshould be sacrificed. They should be \u2014 they should be trouble, they should sacrifice. They\n17 \u201cMalka, you can do anything.\u201d (Yiddish)\nshould suffer. He lost [Ed comment: he lost = he lost weight] in one week something\nimpossible. You saw him \u2014 I went \u2014 we went to some place to a vacation place to, to board \u2014 a\nspa. My mother had troubles with the feet. And he came to visit us in that time. He said it's just\nhorrible. He had 15 people \u2014 I have a picture with him from that forced labor. He said it's\nimpossible what they do with them, no food, they hit them if they're not, you know, in line. If\nthey don't do their job right. And I can see him even now, how he complained. How cruel it\nwas, he said. It's not even human what they're doing with him. With the rest, 15 boys were\nthere. Mostly boys.",
        "Q: So for some reason, your family decided you would leave even though they did not?",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: And did they \u2014 was there any sort of organization that helped you, or you were just going to run\naway?",
        "A: There wasn't time to think. We didn't care, you had nothing to lose. Nothing to lose anymore.",
        "Q: So you were going to leave just totally independently?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, you mentioned that you left with some boy. Who was this boy?",
        "A: That boy, his name was Izo!*. They had a big, a big, grocery wholesale place. And I used to\nknow them because they were friends, and the day before his two sisters and a boy went with\nother group, 15 people. I supposed to go \u2014 I supposed to be in that group, but they left without\nme. I was mad and not mad because I could understand that how difficult, how dangerous it was\nfor them to wait for me. But the next day that boy, as I said, he came with me because he came\nback. Little fellow, you know, 13 years old, a kid \u2014 he was like tiny little boy, and he was scared\nto go without parents. So our parents, they decided he should go with me. So he listened and he\ncame with me. So we crossed the border, and...",
        "Q: How did you get there?",
        "A: Walking overnight. It was night. It was night and so much, mud in the field. And we came to a\nvillage, closest village, and the dogs start to bark. And that was give-away because in the village\neverybody knows each other; it seems like dogs don't bark. So we went in the \u2014 1n there where\nthe horses are \u2014 the stable. And we waited until sun came out, and we went to the woods. And\nfrom there, we went to Ujhely\u2019\u201d to a smallest, a next smallest city. And...",
        "Q: Now, this Ujhely is in Hungary?",
        "A: Yeah. I am already in Hungary. We are already in Hungary. Ujhely was maybe 10,000 people.\nNice Jewish community. And I needed money because Czechish money wouldn't be good. So I\n18 surname.\n19 Satoraljatjhely, Hungary.\nwent to the first store I saw a Jewish name on the store title. And I went in, and so, the woman\nsays, \"Your mother is Mali Griinfeld.\" She recognized me. I was so amazed. She gave me\nmoney and I left. From there to Budapest, but from Ujhely \u2014 Ujhely. There I had an aunt, I had\naunt and I went to visit her. I remembered her, she gave me her maid's Jewish-Hungarian\npapers. So with those papers and my cousin who was one lawyer \u2014 he didn't give me \u2014 and the\nother was a factory, a big factory, chairs and everything. He gave me money enough to go to\nBudapest. So we came to Budapest.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 the boy was still with you at this time?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did he have papers also?",
        "A: He didn't. He didn't. He just got papers in Budapest because his two sisters were already there.",
        "Q: I want to ask you, when you decided to make this trip out of TrebiSov into Hungary, what did\nyou take with you? What were you thinking?",
        "A: Oh, whatever I could put on. And I had few jewelry, I put it in my skirt, sewed it together. And\nwe went \u2014 to that woman, that woman \u2014 a policeman's sister supposed to guard us through the\nborder. She took my money, she took my jewelry out of my skirt and we didn't have anything.\nJust what we had on us. Two suits, two dresses, and that's all. And the less we had, the easier it\nwould be to walk in that mud.",
        "Q: Was there any kind of underground activity in TrebiSov that was helping people get to Hungary\nthat you know about?",
        "A: No. No. Unfortunately, no. Nobody believed that it would happen, something like that.\nNobody believed because they were already organized. Jabotinsky, they had a group, and they\nhad Mizrachi\u2019 also for Israel. And nobody did anything against them. Everybody went like\nunbelievable. In my time, no one was there any longer. No singles, no men, no girls. It was just\nhorrible.",
        "Q: And your plan when you left home was to do what?",
        "A: I was young. I wasn't scared of work, because I had to work all my life in childhood. My father\ndied 13. I went to my aunt, and I worked like a slave from 5:30 till 9:00, so I wasn't scared from\nwork. So to me, everything was good. And with food, I was never spoiled because my mother\nhad nothing. So I was always depending on myself. One slice of bread will be mine, but I can\n49 Religious Zionist movement founded in 1902. Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v.\n\u201cMizrachi.\u201d\nmake it. I had a confidence. Crazy, stupid. But I can make it. I will work hard, and I was very\nhonest. And so \u2014I don't know. I think it was more than luck. And how I survived, I don't know.",
        "Q: Okay, but just getting back. You had a plan that was just to go to Hungary?",
        "A: Right. Saved my life. No other question about the trip.",
        "Q: And someone helped you over the border.",
        "A: Not really. No, we went alone. That little boy and me, we went alone through the border. But\nthat woman where I had paid for them, she directed us. She told us which way to go, that's all.\nOnce we came in that little village in Hungary, we were all by ourselves.",
        "Q: Okay. So you left this town for Budapest?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And how did you travel?",
        "A: Train. Train, remember. By train.",
        "Q: Had you been to Budapest before?",
        "A: Oh, no. We didn't have money to travel.",
        "Q: So when you arrived, what was your impression?",
        "A: My only impression was, \u201cGod, how I will make it here?\u201d I know no one. On the street. Big\ncity, and you \u2014 I don't know. I really cannot even tell you how is it possible to do it now that I\nthink of it. But I was lucky that a boy I met who was my neighbor in TrebiSov, and I met him in\nBudapest. And everybody said, \"Don't talk to him. He's an informer.\" But to me, he gave me a\nplace where I should stay, paid for the room. Gave me a little money, and that was it. And from\nthere on, that Jewish organization in Budapest \u2014 I remember where it was, but I can't remember\nthe name, what organization. They organized jobs for refugees like me in secret. So I went\nthere, and luckily I got a job in a dress \u2014 in a men's clothing. But I needed, as I said, I needed the\njob, and I was lucky. I didn't have problems to get it.",
        "Q: You said you remembered where this Jewish organization was located.",
        "A: Gee, I remember where it was. I can't remember the name.",
        "Q: Do you remember the street or anything?",
        "A: I know it was kind of \u2014 Sziv utca or close by. Sziv utca or next to a train station \u2014 to a train. I\nthink it\u2019s Sziv utca. It was far a little away from where I lived.",
        "Q: And how did you come in contact with the boy you knew from Trebisov?",
        "A: Oh, he \u2014 random. On the street. I just met him. I met everyone \u2014 I never knew \u2014 they warned\nme not to talk to him, and he faces me right away when I walked on the street.",
        "Q: Who warned you not to talk to him?",
        "A: When I was in TrebiSov, they already knew he's there in Budapest, and everybody, \"Keep away\nfrom him. Keep away from him.\" To me, it was a good luck.",
        "Q: So if I'm to understand you, when you arrived...",
        "A: No one.",
        "Q:...1n the big city, you didn't know anyone, and you ran into this boy on the street?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And he got you settled. . .",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: ... with him?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So you worked in the clothing store?",
        "A: Oh, I worked a million places nght away. That was a clothing store. The other was a sugar\nfactory. The third was a maid. I had to change very often because it was dangerous. Somebody\nrecognized me, I'm Jewish, I had to run away and leave the money. I worked there and\nsomebody would suspect you, that was enough to leave the job for me.",
        "Q: I'm a little confused because as I understand it when you first went to Budapest, you went with\nJewish-Hungarian papers, yes?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So it was okay to be Jewish?",
        "A: Yeah. Hungarian.",
        "Q: Oh, you were worried they would suspect you of being...",
        "A: Czechish. So you couldn't have contact. You avoided every contact possible. You didn't know\nanybody. If your mother would pass by, you wouldn't say hello to her. You would be scared\nthat it\u2019s a chain. I know her, whom she knows and it would be on and on. So we didn't have\nfriends really. But one group we met in the park, they were also Czechish like I was, but already\nHungarian Jews. And we met occasionally, once a week or twice a week. One boy was missing.\nWe were scared what happened to that boy. So the Nazis, his brother was with him, and his\nbrother said he \u2014 two weeks later he escaped the Nazis, but now he will need papers because he\nis without papers lost. Identification card. Clear?",
        "Q: Well...",
        "A: You not there yet?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay, darling. Yeah.",
        "Q: If you want to finish this.",
        "A: No, no. Say whatever you want.",
        "Q: Well, how did you \u2014 there were a lot of other refugees there from Czechoslovakia, other places?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Of course there were, yes. But you just look at them, and you run away from them.\nYou wouldn't stop them.",
        "Q: So how did you make contact with this group that you met in the park? How did you know each\nother?",
        "A: That's a good question. You know, I was thinking about that many times, and I couldn't really \u2014\nI went to a kosher restaurant, there I made my friends. I made many friends. I mean, like me,\nyou know. But that group, I can't remember how I met them, but we kept seeing each other\nalmost for a year in that park. We know each other by names, but maybe we didn't even want to\nknow there. I can't remember where we met them. In that park it was close by to me, and I went\nthere to sit down, to escape everything. And it seems like that was the place, but I wouldn't\nswear on it now after so many years. Just I know we met each week or twice a week, you know,\nto know that they are there; they are alive.",
        "Q: Did that park have a name?",
        "A: People?",
        "Q: Did that park have a name?",
        "A: Yeah. I wrote it down, I forgot. I went there last two years ago, so I go to visit. Hmm, I have it\nwritten down, I forgot now.",
        "Q: Now, before we get to the story because it's a very important story ...",
        "A: Koruti Park*', Circle Park. K6ruti Park, Hungarian.",
        "Q: You were at this time living in Budapest as a Hungarian Jew?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What was life like for Hungarian Jews at this point in Budapest?",
        "A: From the beginning, you might want to say or when the Nazis came in?",
        "Q: When you were there.",
        "A: Well, I was there from the beginning. It was a normal life, cheder open and kids with peyes\u201d\nrun everywhere and many synagogues \u2014 I used to go in the synagogues. And one day, I never\nforget, the Dohany Utca Synagogue, which is now a museum. Dr. Hevesi\u2019? was a lecturer. And\nYom Kippur, I went there, and they asked me, they came with a ticket and they said, \"Give me\nmoney.\" On Yom Kippur, they want a contribution. And I said, \"I need money.\" They thought\nI'm joking because I had to be dressed very clean to be able to get a job. If you're dirty and your\nnails are dirty in Budapest, out of work. You don't have a job. So the regulations they have\nthere, so what did I want to say?",
        "Q: Well, I was just asking you what life was like for a Jewish person in Budapest at that time.",
        "A: Oh, religious. People went to synagogue like here in Washington, wouldn't be any difference.\nThere were organizations, Agudah\u201d* was very popular, and synagogues were three, four. One\nRabbi Adler was there and his sister. The only person who let me in her house was that rabbi's\nsister who was married to a cantor, and she let \u2014 1t was dangerous to let me in, and she was the\nonly one who let me in. So they raise kids \u2014 Woman was working, to my surprise, more than in\nCzechoslovakia. In Czechoslovakia, Orthodox rabbis' daughters don't work \u2014 or children. And\nhere a woman was working and education was stressed. They know so much, even girls study\nmore than I did, we did in Czechoslovakia. And they all worked, everybody, girls, it was a big\nchange there. Religious kids started to work and have professions. Before they didn't have that.\n\u201c1 In a later discussion with the interviewee, she indicated that this meeting\nplace was actually Varosliget, the city park of Budapest.\n2 earlocks worn by Hasidic Jews (Hebrew)\n\u201c3 Simon Hevesi (1868-1943), chief rabbi of Budapest.\n24 Political and social movement popular among Orthodox Jews of Eastern\nFurope. Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. \u201cAgudat Israel.\u201d\nAnd life went on; everywhere there were kosher restaurants, and I used to be in kosher\nrestaurants. I was kosher in that time. It was no different than here, a normal life.",
        "Q: No restrictions on Jews?",
        "A: From the beginning when I was there? No, but automatically the same law started like in\nCzechoslovakia. Exactly the same, they copied. Because Nyilas*\u00b0 they were the Nazis. The\nNazis did the same thing that the Hlinkova Garda did in Slovakia. Labor camps \u2014 forced labor\nand then took them away one by one.",
        "Q: Are you talking about after the occupation or before the German occupation?",
        "A: Before, before. Before, everything before.",
        "Q: Well, when you first arrived in Budapest in 1942, everything seemed to be okay for the Jewish\npeople there? You said everything was sort of normal.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: At what point did that start changing in Budapest?",
        "A: It changed because after a while they had the same stars to put on \u2014 yellow stars. Then they had\nthe same taking away the boys to labor camp. There was Dohany, a Dohany where they used to \u2014\nand they organized ghettos.",
        "Q: When was this? I'm just trying to understand how fast this was happening.",
        "A: Oh, oh, oh. Well, in 1942 was great, till 1943 \u2014 end of 1943 \u2014 it started really serious business\nwith taking them away and put stars, losing jobs, closing the stores, curfew on the streets. You\ncouldn't be on the street. And almost paralyzed Jewish life. No Jewish life left over. Little by\nlittle, they took the men away just as much the \u2014 as in Czechoslovakia \u2014 the boys away so you\ndidn't have .... Then they took the girls away. So Budapest was practically without of Jews.\nAll stores closed, to the end. And from beginning, it was automatically it was like step by step\nthe same design followed the Nazis' order.",
        "Q: So until things got bad, you were working from place to place and living somewhat of a normal\nlife?",
        "A: Oh, I couldn\u2019t say that's normal. You didn't know what you're eating. I don't know where you\nsleeping. You don't know where you working. I don't think of it as normal. IfI think of it now,\nI can't 1t believe how I could survive. I wouldn't call it normal by any means. Relatively, oh,\n9 Nyilaskeresztes Part Hungarista Mozgalom (also referred to as \u201cArrow Cross\u201d\nor \u201cGreenshirts\u201d), Hungarian fascist party lead by Ferenc Szalasi.\nEncyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. \u201cArrow Cross Party.\u201d\nyes. If I was thinking how those people in the concentration camps, I thought I'm \u2014 I saw people\non the street hitting them. Policemen hit the old people walking, they couldn't walk \u2014 hit them.\nSo I would think, \u201coh, gosh, I am vacationing,\u201d if I see this. And ghetto \u2014 I pass by a ghetto I\nhad one loaf of bread. I was saving that for the whole week. There's a woman in the entrance. I\nsaid, \"Take that bread.\" I will never forget her face was yellow-green, and she was crying. She\nsaid, \"I cannot take that bread away from you.\" I said, \"Just take and run because I will be\ncatched, nobody will be happy.\" So it was such an impossible, but why didn't woman didn't run\naway, I don't know. The door was open. The ghetto door was open. People didn't believe it,\ncouldn't believe it, that could happen. Even they were in ghetto, they still couldn't believe it, that\ntragedy what waits for them \u2014 it's unbelievable. Gosh, bombs \u2014 day by day, I saw mountains of\npeople like potatoes, like potatoes. One hit my house, where I was with a Christian family\nalready, since I'm Christian. And they had a little soup, a bowl of soup. They gave me one\nspoon, and six other people ate the same \u2014 from the same plate. One spoon, bowl of water, but\nthat was all \u2014 we couldn't have. We couldn't go out on the \u2014 one woman, we were in bunker for\nthree months in sand, sleeping. You couldn't go out, it was bombing constantly. Budapest was\nburning day and night. I was happy about when it was burning, to be honest. If I die, Samson.",
        "Q: When was this? At what period of time?",
        "A: That was already in 1944. The most critical time, and no one could be Jewish any longer. There\nwere no Jews.",
        "Q: Now, you mentioned just now something about becoming Christian.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But you didn't tell me how all of that happened. Maybe you can...",
        "A: Oh, how I became Christian? Well, there was no more \u2014 my identification Jewish-Hungarian\nwasn't good anymore because there were no more Jews. So I had to change my name for\nChristian Jew, Hungarian Jew.",
        "Q: When \u2014 how long did you live as a Hungarian Jew? I didn't \u2014 I just want to get an idea of \u2014",
        "A: Hungarian Jew? Till 1943, 1943.",
        "Q: And at the point where you were a Hungarian Jew, you felt always at risk?",
        "A: Of course. My God, many times they brought on me a policeman one day in the restaurant\nwhere do I get the ration papers, it was illegal. And then one day, I go in the park because there's\na razzia, it will be in that street. I should go in the park that will be safe. So I went to the park.\nOne man, a Nazi newspaperman, was in charge of the building where I stayed and he 1s there in\nthe park and he stops me. And we talked together, and then he says where I am from. And I said\nI didn't even know because my Hungarian name, I still had Hungarian name, Jewish name. And\nhe said he's going to my city. I said my mother was yesterday here and he wanted to say\nsomething to him, that he should go to visit my mother because he knew the city. I said don't go\nbecause my mother was yesterday here. Then he takes my pocketbook away with force. In that\npocketbook was my life. If you don't have any papers with you, you're dead. And I knew he's a\nNazi newspaperman. I knew he's in charge of that building, and I run after him. He said, \"Why\nare you so nervous?\" I remember he's asking like now. And I said, \"I am insulted that you took\nwith force my papers. You didn't ask for them.\" He tells me, \"I thought that you are a very\nnaive girl. Now, I know that you are raffiniert?\u00b0.\". Like shrewd, raffiniert. Raffiniert is more like\na shrewd girl, a Hebrew girl. \"Just tell me when you came from Czechoslovakia to this country.\"\nHe did not report me. I left. Two weeks later somebody went there .... Were such magic\nthings, such un.... When I am walking on the street and a policeman is coming. And a man\nbehind me came over, and he says I \u2014 he knows me. I never saw him before, I didn't even know\nhe exist there. You know such coincidence. And in the restaurant, policeman was \u2014 he got shut\nthis door and he brought Nyilas, you know, the Nazi Nyilas? And he said I should identify\nmyself. You know identification cards. I said, \"I left them home.\" You know, just to let \u2014 well,\nanyway many such episodes. Many, many, many more. At night I was waken up at midnight. I\nshould him the papers, and that cantor's wife's sister was with me. Said, \"Don't be next time\nwithout paper identification,\" and left me there. Another story they locked me in the restaurant\nand my \u2014 my kosher restaurant in Dob utca nine [9 Dob Street], and he said, \u201cA Nazi's coming\nin to check everybody. You run.\" I left everything, run on the street day time. It was \u2014 you\ndidn't know what you're doing from minute to minute. I was a maid because I didn't want to eat.\nGoing to eat places. Then I was washing the dishes in the restaurants, so I should have food, I\nshould not be hungry. Washing dishes in a restaurant by myself, unbelievable.",
        "Q: How did you know who to trust?",
        "A: Didn't trust anyone. You just didn't trust anybody because Jewish people you couldn't. You\nwere scared of them and yourself, and Christians, you couldn't. And the end \u2014 well, I \u2014 the end,\nto the end where only Christians could be like, how I got the Christian papers. So, my brother-\nin-law was a cantor, and his congregant was one of the woman who had \u2014 that Adler who gave in\nBudapest \u2014 who gave me the Christian papers. Kovacs Gizi is my name now. He had always\ncontact and money. He was Jewish, but he had such wonderful job as a Christian. He didn't\nlook like Jewish. So he gave me the papers, Christian papers. Follow?",
        "Q: Well, I want you to explain this a little bit more how you were able to get Christian papers.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: And about when this was. I think you said this was middle 1943?",
        "A: Yeah. Mid,1943. Well, you could have the whole house full of diamonds. If you wouldn't have\nthe identification papers, your life was not worth that of a penny. So there is my friend, Joseph\nAdler, and he was \u2014 he had an aunt in that place where my brother-in-law was a cantor, so he\nhelped me. And until today, we are friends, and I went to his grandchild's wedding two months\nago, 800 people. It was fantastic. [Indecipherable]. So he gave me the Christian papers,\nChristian Hungarian papers. And he gave me money, and he helped also other, a rabbi was next\nin that same floor. Without any question, he went in which was dangerous and gave him money\nand identification papers.",
        "Q: How did he get these papers?\n76 cunning, crafty (German)",
        "A: He had a contact with the one Christian man, and that Christian man was somebody very\nimportant. And he gave him all the identifications what he needed, and so he helped many out\nwith money, because he always had money, and he helped me out with the papers.",
        "Q: I'm going to stop right here because they need to change the videotape.",
        "A: Oh, all right.",
        "Q: And we'll take a little pause. How are you doing?",
        "A: I don't know\u2014\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2",
        "A: And you want to know I came from the Golem family. Who made the Golem, the Rabbi Loew,\nfrom Prague, I came from that family. My mother always said, \"Don't forget your name.\"",
        "Q: You said...",
        "A: Okay, if you want it.",
        "Q: Oh, no.",
        "A: It's up to you.",
        "Q: It's good information, but it doesn't fit right here.",
        "A: No, I just, I just \u2014 if you wanted that.",
        "Q: When we finished up before, you were talking about getting these Christian papers. Were you\nable to help anyone else get Christian papers?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: How did you do that?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Well, it was like one boy I used to meet at the kosher \u2014 Dob utca Nine was a kosher\nrestaurant in Budapest, okay? And I was kosher and I went every day, and there was a boy and I\nmet him there. And he said he is having \u2014 he has identification papers if somebody wants it, but\nfor money. I had no money. I was lucky I have from day to day \u2014 if you worked a week, you\ncould buy yourself on black market one slice \u2014 one loaf of bread. But normally, you had to work\nfor a week. But I said to that boy, \u201cI have one ring. I had a ring from home, from my\nhometown, a small ring. I give you that ring in deposit. The woman cannot come today over to\nbring me money, but she has to get the papers today because tomorrow, you never know what\nhappens to her. So leave me the papers. You come tomorrow if you want to, to my place, and I\ngive you cash. I see her tonight. I promised her to bring her the papers.\" He said, \u201cI cannot give\nyou. I need the money.\" I said, \"I cannot \u2014 you cannot,\" \u2014 he was in my room. \"You cannot go\naway with that paper now. You have to give me that paper.\" \"I can't.\" I said, \"I don't care. Here\nis my ring. Take my ring.\" So he listened. It was good, and I went to give that paper to her.\nAnd then she gave me her bracelet, which I carried, I thought if \u201cshe will come back. At once \u2014I\ndon't ked it, I will have everything after the war. Give her back.\" So she gave me her ring and\nher bracelet and, of course, she didn't come back. And one woman the same way, I give her the\npapers, that boy left the papers without money. Give her another ring. The same ring I gave for\ntwo people, I took back that ring. And she came back, but she couldn't survive; her body didn't\nwork. They didn\u2019t eat and they ate and then they got sick, and it was so she didn't. But those\ntwo people \u2014 those two people I remember exactly how it was.",
        "Q: And you were able to get these through this Mr. Adler?",
        "A: Oh, Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler \u2014 nobody was Jewish anymore, okay? 194\u2014 end of 1943 and '44\nbeginning, no Jews.*\u2019 And so Adler, we met in the restaurant occasionally, and he said, \"Here\nare your papers, and here is your money. And I have a place where I live, you can come to live\nthere.\" But we didn't know each other. You know, we did not suppose to talk to each other, we\ndidn't know each other, that they shouldn't suspect us. And so then I was lucky, he occasionally\ngave me money. And then to the end it wasn't good anymore either. So he left his \u2014 I didn't live\nthere anymore. I had to find a new place.\nHow did I find a new place? I was working in Rothchilds \u2014 in that elite salon, aristocrats. And I\nam going home, and my colleague, my girl, who was working with me dresses, I said to her,\n\"You know my housewife\" \u2014 how she said? \"My landlady \u2014 landlord has a guest. Her sister\ncame from someplace, and I cannot stay there tonight. If you could take me, I will sleep on the\nfloor. Anyplace you want just to have\" \u2014 5 o'clock is curfew. You cannot be on the street. So\nshe let me, and that was my good luck and I stayed with her. But it was already bombing,\nconstantly bombing it was on and on and on. I don't know if you want that part now. And I\nstayed \u2014 three Jewish \u2014 her brother-in-law and her two sisters, we were in the same building\ntogether. There was unselfishness, I would never believe it. She's asking me, \"Malvina, Gizi,\nwhen is Yom Kippur?\" She knew I am Jewish \u2014 didn\u2019t report me, and she \u2014 unbelievable how\nunselfish those people were while I was with them. You know, slice of bread or water, 1t was\nlike life saver, and they didn't care. They gave me just as much as they had. We should come to\nthe bunker how everybody had to be curfew and bombs were hitting the city constantly. And in\na certain hour or a certain time, they were announcing each day, when we have to go in the\nbunker. Bunker, you know what 1s a bunker? So we went in the bunker one time tn the length of\nthree months. Didn't go out, didn't go in. And one girl says, \"I can't stand it,\" a young woman. I\njust see her in front of my mind. \"I have to get water.\" \"Don't go, don't go, sweetheart.\" Bombs\nhit her and she never came back. Just for water, but she wanted to go there. But it was just such\na critical time, people are \u2014 and that bunker life three months, unbelievable. Three months in one\nplace, one seven-story building. And one day I am standing in front of the building \u2014\noccasionally, I \u2014 she lived, we lived on the first floor \u2014 occasionally, we went up to the first floor.\nNot permitted, everybody had to be downstairs, but since it was first floor, so we went up. And I\nam standing in front of the window, and the bomb hit the whole building and that little window\nwith my friend. Scattered bombs you know and all windows are broken. And we are here like a\nmiracle. Nothing happened to both of us. And we couldn't eat; we had no place to go. The\nstores were closed and bombed out. You could steal \u2014 they didn't call it stealing. We had to\nwork for it. Confiscating or something. Confiscating, but not stealing. And they had ice cream\ncones, so I took ice cream cones and put water in it. It was lucky, and my friend's uncle came.\n\u201c7 The conditions for Jews in Budapest quickly deteriorated after the German\ntake over of the city on March 19, 1944. Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v.\n\u201cBudapest.\u201d\nHe was, he couldn't talk. He cried. He cried with tears. He's starving. A big, husky man is\ncrying. So I gave him as much I could, and one day I went for a bread. They said that place will\nhave bread, and I met a friend who pretended he's blind. He said, \u201cWhat the heck you doing on\nthe street? It's curfew.\u201d No one was on the street. I was the only one. \u201cYou cannot do it. I'll\ngive you money, if you need money. You don't go out on the street any longer.\" And that kind\nof \u2014 on the street, you couldn't see anyone. As I said, except the mountains dead people scattered\nin one section. And one restaurant was open one hour a day, and there were many dead people\naround here. You didn't mind. You just went through and went in and ate if you got a cup of\nsoup, and went back again. Impossible, impossible conditions. Hygiene \u2014 there was none.\nCouldn't drink water, so how could you wash yourself with water?",
        "Q: Did you think you'd get through all that?\n02-10:23",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: At the time, do you remember what you were thinking? Did you think that you'd get through all\nof this?",
        "A: I always have a kind of stupid hope. I didn't believe that it's possible to do it, but I always said to\nthe landlady, \"You will see, we will live through \u2014 we have to live through that war, and I will\ntell you, you have to live. We have to live through that war.\" But that was so silly. That was\nvery silly to hope.",
        "Q: After you were living with the Christian papers, did you have to do anything differently? Did\nyou have to pretend you were Christian? Did you have to change your lifestyle at all?",
        "A: Well, I didn't have to change too much because I didn't have any lifestyle. Makes simple as that.\nI had no lifestyle. From minute to minute, I don't know where I am. I'm working today,\nsomebody suspects you, I run away. No money, no job. Today I'm sleeping here. I don't know\nwhere I am tomorrow. I don't even know where I am tonight. No plans, no arrangement. Once I\nhad a rental room, that's true, with two old ladies. They knew that I'm Jewish, and the manager\nof that building knew I am Jewish. I had to leave. And in that same building was that\nnewspaperman.",
        "Q: But you didn't have to go to church or\u2014",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "Q: Now, you came from a very religious home.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So during all this period, were you able to in any way continue your religious observances or\npractices?",
        "A: Well, the kosher restaurants were still open until it was open, but then it was closed. So then I\nate anything I could. But while I was a maid in that same period of time, I didn't eat, but they ate\npork and stuff like that. I just picked bread and stuff which is kosher for me, but it wasn't kosher.",
        "Q: So even with all of these hardships, you tried to respect your tradition . . .",
        "A: Yeah. I wouldn't do it anymore. If I think of it now, it was so silly. And, you know, that nicest\npart was, I didn't have to do it. I didn't have to observe according to the rabbis. I could do\nanything I wanted to. It's a style, or, I don't know, way of life, I guess.",
        "Q: What about holidays?",
        "A: I went to synagogue one day, and in that same time a friend where I was working, she had a big\ncross all the time. And one day I came to her \u2014 nobody was around us \u2014 I said, \"Are you\nJewish?\" And she says, \"No, Iam not Jewish.\" And here I went to synagogue, and she 1s there.\nSo in synagogue, I used to go in Dohany Utca, in what is now a museum. I used to hear\nwonderful lectures by Dr. Hevesi. He was a wonderful lecturer. It was so quiet when he was\ntalking, and I was so impressed with him. And that was like a hiding place, no place to go. It\nwasn't safe either. It was public, 1t was \u2014 never public places they didn't advise us to be. We\nwere supposed to be hiding all the time someplace where nobody would see us. So I went to the\nsynagogue and to the shows, to the theaters I used to love to go. I thought I'm safe inside. I don't\nhave to face too much public outside.",
        "Q: This was all while you were still a Hungarian Jew, or this was after you got your Christian\npapers?",
        "A: It was continue, but you see the synagogue wasn't anymore on. It was a ghetto, and that's the end\nto the synagogue.",
        "Q: Did you ever go into the ghetto?",
        "A: To the end when I gave that woman that slice of bread. No, I didn't want to go in. It was too\nrisky. In that little bit what I went in with the gates, open gates, it was not advisable. I couldn't\nhelp them.",
        "Q: But you knew what was happening inside?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, we knew. We knew, yes. That's it's ghetto, everybody knew that that's a\nghetto; it's no picnic.",
        "Q: Did you feel at all conflicted about that? That you were running around as a Catholic and yet\nyour people were in this horrible condition?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What did that feel like?",
        "A: It was like a stone. You can't think. You feel like a statue, that it's not you. How can you\nsurvive and watching them? And you can't do anything about it. Where can you turn? The\nwhole world is quiet. Nobody cares, and we were angry. We were very much angry, not only on\nthe whole world, that they let something like that happen. But we were also angry, if I may say,\nin that time when Jewish people were still all right that they were so indifferent. They were so\nindifferent. They didn't raise, we didn't hear any screaming, didn't have any help from anyplace,\nand we felt very, very bad about it, angry. We were angry. Simply very, very angry that we can\nsit in nice warm place, and I\u2019m starving and freezing to death, had no shoes. One hole was snow\nand the other one went out the snow. So it was anger and such hopelessness. Can't do anything\nfor them. And when I saw those people, I said, \"Thank God. What do I have to complain? I'm\nvacationing.\" That's the way I felt. I'm on vacation. With all the troubles compared to them,\nunbelievable.",
        "Q: At this point did you have any more contact with your family?",
        "A: Oh, right away, no. I wrote right away when I came in April. The 22nd when I left Pesach my\nhome. And I wrote right away home that I'm all right and I would like to hear from you. You\nknow, just a card, and I give my address to that cantor's wife, Frankel, Lillian Frankel. She was\nthe only one who let me in her house. Only one woman, no one let me in. And the card came\nback very shortly, didn't take too long. The 5th of May the card came back. Card came back the\nSth of May, I remember like now. Unknown, Address unknown.[ed comments: the card said\n\u201caddress unknown\u2019\u2019| They moved, but the address is unknown. And that was the time when\nthey took them to concentration camps. You know, I didn't want to find out where they were.\nUntil today, I can't think \u2014 I couldn't put myself together to find out. I don't know if you can\nunderstand me. I couldn't put myself together. I didn't want to know where they are. From\nDachau, I was 30 miles. I didn't want to go in. I didn't even ask where they are. Can you\nbelieve it? So unbelievable. Mother 62 years old only, and I was the youngest.",
        "Q: Okay. I want to get back to that. But maybe you can tell me now about how you got involved\nwith this group that was acquiring ID cards or work permits. You said earlier that there was a\npark...",
        "A: Yeah. K6riti, K6riti*\u00ae Park. That's Circle Park.",
        "Q: And about when was this? I forget.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: About when was this time-wise?",
        "A: Well, it must have been end of '43.7\u201d End of '43 because that was where it when it was most\n\u201c8 Varosliget\n\u201c9 Conditions for the Jewish population of Budapest quickly deteriorate when\nthe Nazi-backed Arrow Cross party seized power on October 15, 1944.\nEncyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. \u201cBudapest.\u201d\ncritical. Most critical time. There were no Jews. The boys are out in concentration camps. The\nmen are in concentration camps. Women are all away or in concentration camps. Ghettos are\nliquidated. There are no more ghettos, no more forced labor, no more don\u2019t see Jew. Budapest\nwithout a Jew. So I went to that K\u00e9riti Park\u00b0\u2019. I live in that \u2014 close by Negyed Utca*! in the\ntrain station \u2014 close to the train station. And one boy \u2014 so we met there maybe Duri, and his wife\nand one other was a lawyer and he survived. And then my two friends and one other boy was\nthere, so two women.",
        "Q: Was this sort of a spontaneous meeting?",
        "A: Yeah. It was like we meet here and happily we acknowledge each other. That was the message.\nBut don't talk to each other unless you have to, and don't sit in one section. You know, scatter all\nover. We don't know each other.",
        "Q: Were you all from Czechoslovakia?",
        "A: Yeah. They had the same papers already, Christian-Jewish \u2014 Christian-Hungarian papers like\nme. They couldn't be otherwise there.",
        "Q: So tell me the story of how you got involved with this plan.",
        "A: Oh, well\u2014",
        "Q: And if you remember the names of these people that would be helpful.",
        "A: Well, Perl Duri. Perl , P-e-r-l, Duri D-u-r-i.. And \u201cD\u201d on the top is like \u201cU\u201d\u2019 Hungarian. And\nthen the other was his brother, Jan, with his girlfriend. I can't remember. And the other was \u2014 I\ncan't remember. I just remember Perl Duri, with his friend \u2014 because I went to visit him after the\nwar \u2014 with his mother survived. In Trencianski-Martin**. Trencianski-Martin, a Slovak in Tatry,\nhe lived. I remember exactly. And then Salgo Tibor (ph) and Salgo Willie (ph), those two\nbrothers. And then the other married couple, one more was missing, was there. I can't remember\nthe names, but I have four names. And then one time \u2014 one day one of the brothers were\nmissing, the Salgo, not married. The other was also single, Willie, and he is not in.\nSo we wotried, since one is missing that's some bad news for everyone. So his brother worried,\nand he said after two weeks that he find his brother. He came out, he was captured by the Nazis,\nhanged 10 days from the ceiling with hands up in the back tied together. Cigarettes in the back\ntesting how much he can take, and electrical wires in his mouth and, of course, tortured him as\nmuch they could. So, luckily, the bomb hit the building after 10 days to be tortured and hanging\n3\u00b0 Varosliget\n3+ Street name unverifiable.\n5 Tur\u00e9ansky Svaty martin, CZ\nfrom the ceiling. He escaped, but he was blue, green and yellow, you know, from all this torture.\nHe had to hide in the bunker, and when he came out, so he needed papers. With his papers he is\nlost. So, after he looked a little better, his brother decided that he will ask his General friend \u2014\nChristian. He was working in the pharmacy, and then he met that General, Hungarian-Christian.\nAnd he gave him a paper that he requests from the National Printing Office, identification cards\nfor laborers to work in a factory \u2014 in a munitions factory. And I will be there, they shouldn't give\nanybody the papers, just for me. And he's sending me, assistant, to the National Printing Office\nwhich was located \u2014 I see it now, like a \u2014 Vaci Utca, like in the Fifth Avenue. And his brother \u2014\nI didn't know where that place is \u2014 took me. Three blocks away he was waiting, if I come out\nalive. So I went in, in the National Printing Office. There was a young man \u2014 luckily, I got them\n500 identification cards. I didn't look at them. I just grab them. I don't know; I went out. I\ndidn't breathe, I guess. Very \u2014 and then that boy was waiting for me who was hanged, you know.\nSo I gave him the papers and he ran away, and he gave it to others that he had contact. What\nkind contact? That brother who was working in the pharmacy they made the arrangements to\nmeet all the men there, and he will give them from the pharmacy \u2014 because it's open to the\npublic, it's a safe place \u2014 and he said so many and so many people only, so many and so many\nhours. Divided the time they shouldn't be all at one time there. He said he saw everybody, he\ntold me that he saw everybody who's coming in. But he was there incognito, they shouldn't see\nhim; he was hiding behind in the back somehow. And I went there three times. I don't want to\ntell you how scared I was each time to go in. And the fourth time \u2014I got three times, okay, 500\nand 500 \u2014 and the fourth time, they wouldn't give me it. But I noticed that they want to call the\npoliceman on me, the Nazis, so I run out. How I did that, I don't know. So that was my lucky\nstar in that time that I could make it. And there, I met them in 1981 \u2014 \u201981 when it was the\ninternational convention in Israel. My husband and Miriam were with me. [ed comment: met\nTibor and Willie]",
        "Q: Miriam your daughter?",
        "A: My daughter. And those two men came, I saved their lives. You know, Willie, those two\nbrothers only. They came in and Willie, the younger one who was hanged, said \u201cI thought that I\nwould never have children,\u201d because they tortured him so much everywhere. And now he has a\nfamily and grandchildren, he's happy and he was a pioneer. From the 400 people on the boat, the\nfirst to go to Israel. And there were seven survived, and he was the one among the seven that\nsurvived. And his brother is a doctor now, he's retired. And he has a family, beautiful children,\nand they came to visit me also to Washington to Silver Spring. But when I met him I lost the\nconvention. I thought \u201cI am dreaming\u201d and he didn't stop repeating, \"Malvinka, Malvinka,\"\ntalking Hungarian because I speak and he speaks Hungarian, \"You are my heroine, you saved\nmy life. You saved my life. You are a hero, you are great.\" You know, that kind of thing. I\nthought \u201cI am dreaming,\u201d it was great. And his brother also came.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a few questions about these papers that you went to get. What were these\npapers? They were work permits?",
        "A: Yeah. Work permits.",
        "Q: Did they have names on them?",
        "A: No, no, no. They didn't have names, they was printed. Printed with that General's paper, print of\na General's paper, and on that paper was required that I should bring, I should bring the \u2014 from\nthe National Printing office papers for free. National Printing Office gave me papers, just blank\nnames. But it was the National Printing Office seal, Hungarian national print. And that was\nNazis everything went through that printing office this. They had a seal from the printing of this,\nbut blank. Everybody could fill out your letters, so you're a tailor, 13 years, or a boy of 15 \u2014 the\nway you wanted.",
        "Q: So your friend filled out the name cards?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Your friend, the people you were working with, after they got these blank work permits, then\nthey would put in names, or false names or whatever?",
        "A: Yeah. They gave them in that pharmacy when they came in, everybody got a paper. And they\nfilled it out according to their age or profession, whatever they choose to be.",
        "Q: Did you actually see the papers?",
        "A: I was lucky to get rid of them because I didn't need them. I was already Christian and if I keep\none and somebody \u2014 the police or something, I'm dead. Where you got it? He was catched \u2014\nwhen he gave the papers, that Willie. He had a handful of papers in the hands and policeman put\nhim in jail because they find the papers in his hands. He escaped again, but it was very, very life\nthreatening. Not only dangerous, but it was a bullet right away.",
        "Q: Who is the man you got the papers from in the printing office?",
        "A: God, I can't remember. A young man and I didn't even ask, I didn't care, and I, I just was so\nhappy to get out with the papers. Didn't know, it was a young man 1n 30s, very businesslike\ndressed.",
        "Q: And then each time you did this, you gave them to Willie or the brother as soon as possible?",
        "A: The younger brother. The other had troubles to walk. Then after that after the war, he got sick.",
        "Q: So you gave it to the one who had been tortured?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: He would wait for you at some appointed place?",
        "A: Three blocks, yeah. Because any time I went in, all the time it was life.",
        "Q: Do you think that anybody got paid for these papers?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Now, that was a good story. You know, I'm glad you asked me because I didn't know it\nuntil maybe a month or two months ago. I called my friend up, and I said, \"You know, I want to\nrecheck that how it happened.\" I wasn't interested before. It didn't care, I gave it to the \u2014 and\nyou do what \u2014 you know. He said that he gave it to his sister-in-law. She made money on it, and\nshe didn't give a penny to that boy. That boy gave her the paper \u2014 that boy who was tortured, I\ngive him the papers, all right? And then the boy give the sister-in-law the papers, and she made\nmoney on it. And she didn't give him anything, she didn't give me anything. So they become\nenemies.",
        "Q: The sister-in-law was the wife of the guy in the pharmacy?",
        "A: No, no. The other \u2014 their sister-in-law. They had another sister-in-law. Not a sister-in-law \u2014\nhow is it? Like a nephew \u2014 an aunt? Like sister's child, a nephew, a niece.",
        "Q: Niece?",
        "A: Yeah. Brother-in-law's wife.",
        "Q: Your brother-in-law's \u2014 is a sister.",
        "A: Well, then...",
        "Q: These got distributed through the pharmacy .. .",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: ... and the other brother? But who made money?",
        "A: The sister-in-law from another brother . . .",
        "Q: Another brother?",
        "A: From another \u2014 had nothing to do with those people, the two sister-in-laws.",
        "Q: But she isn't...",
        "A: Cousin! Excuse me. Now, I got it. I know I confused you. Cousin's wife. His cousin's wife got\nthe papers, and his cousin's wife didn't give anything for the Willie, that man who gave her the\npapers, and she made money on it.",
        "Q: But these papers got distributed through the pharmacy, correct?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And so this cousin's wife was involved in this...",
        "A: Must have been. Must have been.",
        "Q: I see. Well, did you \u2014 at this time \u2014 you have a regular, sort of a normal job also?",
        "A: It's nothing normal.",
        "Q: Okay, but, you know, were you working somewhere?",
        "A: Yeah. I worked. I was luckily always working someplace, yeah. I worked all the time all my\ntime what I was there. Million jobs, but I always \u2014 I was always lucky to get some work. But\nyou had to work a week to get one loaf of bread.",
        "Q: The last time you went in when you thought that they were suspicious of you and they were\ngoing to call the police or the Nazis, how did you get away?",
        "A: Miracle. I said I had my identification, I left them at home. If they would let me out. So, \"I let\nyou go now, but next time don't go without identification papers.\" Such, such, such unbelievable\nthing.",
        "Q: So after this episode and you kind of went back to just wherever you could find to work or a\nplace to live?",
        "A: Yeah. They usually in Budapest have a sign, \"A bed to rent.\" To sleep overnight, one bed to\nrent. Mostly, I went there. It was light overnight men and women together, families together. It\nwas no problem I was so used to it.",
        "Q: At this point in time, were you aware of any of the aid organizations, the Jewish rescue\norganizations or underground organizations in Budapest?",
        "A: Nothing to help, no help anymore. It stopped, all of them. There was nothing there in my time\nwhat I would remember. There was no contact. We didn't go anyplace to listen to anything. We\nwere scared of the light, so I didn't know anything. In that time and Bricha*\u2019 was before, you\ndidn't hear anything after. After the Jewish life stopped, we had no knowledge of anything.",
        "Q: Do you think that the people you were working with to get out of these work permits, do you\nthink they were operating independently or that they had had some help and instruction from\nanother organization?",
        "A: I think they must have had some other organization. Willie must have had something. Willie\nmust have had because he was very broad minded, he was very active before and he did \u2014 but, I\nwouldn't know it.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t know who that would have been?",
        "A: I wouldn't know, no. I couldn't tell you. I could only find out if I called him again \u2014 \u2018cause he's\nalive, he could tell me \u2014 in Israel.",
        "Q: Well, it might be good information to just put in your file 1f you ever find out, if you know. So\nthe Nazis came into Budapest?\n\u00b03 escape efforts (Hebrew) Bricha - an organization",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And things changed? They just got worse? Things...",
        "A: It's not worse; it's the horror. The most horrible, horrible, horrible time. There's no Jew, not a\nsingle Jew is there. Can you imagine such a lively organization, such a lively Jewish\ncommunity? Synagogues are empty. Stores are closed. You don't see any single person, and\ncurfew was on till the end of the war. You couldn't go out, it's just you couldn't meet \u2014 breathe\noutside. You have to be in a bunker, prepared to be in day and night. And at night it was a must\nif you are over 5 o'clock. One time I couldn't make it, so house was bombed out. So I went\nunder the house all by myself. There was a man shaking, he has sickness. I said, \"how come\nyou are here all by myself.\" They put him there, sister-in-laws put him there so that he shouldn\u2019t\nbe \u2014 so he should be safe \u2014 they should save him. The whole building was empty, so I stayed\nwith him the whole night. The sick man shaked all night through with fear and everything. I\nwill never forget that night. Curfew, if you're not home in time, you're lost.",
        "Q: So toward the end you weren't even working anymore?",
        "A: No. I didn't work to the end, no. I stayed in one Christian family. Two sisters, one brother and\none sweetheart for one of the sisters. She was real nice to me.",
        "Q: They thought you were Christian?",
        "A: Oh, no. They said, \"When is Yom Kippur, tell me Gizi?\" Okay, Gizi's my name now, okay,\nHungarian-Christian. \"Gizi, tell me when is Yom Kippur.\" I said, \"I don't know. No.\u201d You\nknow, \u201cI don't know.\" So they knew I am Jewish, but they did not report me.",
        "Q: And you stayed with them until the end of the war?",
        "A: Till the end and bombs were sort of constant now.",
        "Q: Well, how did all of this come to an end?",
        "A: What happened to the end? Germany lost, but Germany still was killing in the last minute. In\nDecember everybody announced Germany kapituliert**, finished. Germany won\u2019t win \u2014 lost the\nwar, and they still went at night and killed and killed and killed. The bombs and the grenades, I\nheard every time at midnight.

        "A: I was in that room with my friends, and suddenly five soldiers come over. And they want to\nattack the woman, the single woman there. She was very beautiful, and she screams after me,\n\"Gizi, Gizi, I didn't report you. Help me, help me. Help me, help me.\" Five soldiers.",
        "Q: Soviets?",
        "A: Soviet, they liberated \u2014 Soviet Russian liberated Budapest. So they all wanted to attack her, so\nshe screamed after me and I came over. And I said, \"Hey, you're my brothers. How can you do\nit? What would you do if somebody \u2014 something like that happens to your wife or your sister or\nmother?\" So they let her go. She said, \"You owe me that because I did not report you, and I\nknew you are, Nazi \u2014 you know, you are Jewish.\" And life, you couldn't have food. You didn't\nhave anything. Even after the war, the stores plundered\u2014 everybody steal whatever they could.\nThere was no established law. After maybe four or five months later, they said, \"Hey, you\n\u00b07 The Soviet Army liberated the Pest portion of the city in January of 1945,\nand went on to liberate the Buda portion the following month. Encyclopedia\nof the Holocaust, s.v. \u201cBudapest.\u201d\ncannot do it any longer.\" From December to summer, I think. You know, you could take and\nnobody would bother you. But after a while, the law came that you cannot steal or take anything\nanymore, so what we did \u2014 there was no food, no stores, no place to go shopping, after the war.\nThe only great thing was you had freedom. You could breathe, and I thought that's best in the\nworld what you can get after \u2014 that we are alive. So I went to see that man [Tibor] who was that\nfriend who was alive. My Christian lady [landlady] took me to him, and I was happy that he's\nstill alive. We didn't know anything. And he took over an office, a doctor's office because he\nhad two years of medicine already. And he said it's horrible, no drugs, and he had to take the\nbombs \u2014 the shrapnel out of people. Cold freezing hospitals. No heat and no drugs. He said it's\na horrible, horrible condition. So while he was going to hospital, curing the people, and if he saw\nsomebody's very sick even before, he took his identifications away and gave it to someone else.\nI was waiting for food. Kitchens on the streets for everyone. But from the morning to the night I\ncould wait for a cup of soup. I waited, and I got his soup and luckily and he could be in the\nhospital. But after a while, we decided we are going to Szeged, plenty food, another city \u2014 a\ndoctors\u2019 university. So he went to enroll to the doctor, finish, and I was staying there till I\nwouldn't be hungry anymore. Once they got me, the policeman, I had wanted to sell. But they\ndidn't put me in jail. You know, they just took away my blackmail \u2014 or black market. There it\nwas already food plenty. Plenty food in Szeged. Then I wanted to see who's at home in\nTrebisov. I knew it's a magic, if somebody will come back.\nI didn't want to dream. I still \u2014 I took a train overnight, three weeks on the top of the train and I\ntraveled. And Red Cross occasionally stopped the train and gave us soup or something, so in\nthree weeks I came home traveling on the top of the roof. Soldiers went home. The soldiers\ndidn't want to go back to Russia. They got an order if you're not coming three times. If you're\nnot coming on the third order, you will be sent to Siberia. So then they went back on the same\ntrain what I went on the top of the train. And I came home and, of course, there 1s \u2014 we owned a\nhouse and a restaurant, and my mother still owed money on that building. So I stayed till I could\nmake \u2014 pay off the house. So I was dreaming, I wasn't believe it that somebody's coming back,\nthey should have at least a place. So I went in my house, they hit me, why I didn't stay with the \u2014\nwhy I didn't die with the Nazis, because the Christian woman took over. She was one time a\nmaid in my mother's place, so she lives now in my building, in my house. It was a nice house.\nAnd she hit me, and I wanted, you know, sentimental things what I could out from there, so I\ntook a policeman and we went back. She hit me again in front of him. Such a\u2014 soaked over\nCommunism \u2014 I mean, Nazism. Everybody was a Nazi. One boy who hit my brother, gave him\nto the policeman, he says while I was there \u2014 stopped me on the street, he said: \"I wanted to save\nyour brother.\" Gosh, I was so mad at him. I was so mad. I went to the office, I said, \"How\ncome you still have that man free?\" So he says, \"We have a new Bible. If somebody hits you on\none side, you give him the other side.\" I said, \"It's good that you didn't build a monument for the\nkillers here.\" But then I left, I didn't \u2014I stayed till I...",
        "Q: Any other people in your family or other Jews come back?",
        "A: From my family, no one. From my family, no one came. And I find maybe 10 people, 10, but\nthey don't live there anymore. They are in Israel \u2014 they went to Israel, maybe 10. I went to the\nsynagogue. Books scattered, we have a big library, book \u2014 Torah books. Mother, I don't if she \u2014\nmaybe the rabbi \u2014 father, I don't know. I didn't question it. I always \u2014 saw that book in that same\nplace. And my mother used to read them in translation, in Jewish translation, the Hebrew. They\nhad always used that \u2014 so they put the books 1n that synagogue, and my brother-in-law wrote 500\npages of Torah. They were there in that synagogue. And then my cousin took them out \u2014 who 1s\nNew York now. I wanted to publish it, but my hands are not kosher so he doesn't want to five it\nto me. He's very religious \u2014 Borough Park. And life \u2014 people went back to their professions and\nthey worked, but they didn't have to because the HIAS and the JOINT distribution gave\neverybody a room if you wanted to and enough money to live on after the war.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in TrebiSov?",
        "A: Just till I sold my \u2014 I cleared my house, my mother's house. Four or five months. I didn't want\nto stay there. In Prague they wanted to give me a factory because I was very good in my field,\nand my name was good.",
        "Q: So you went to Prague then?",
        "A: Then from there, when I left TrebiSov, I went to Prague and Brno once more to see my sister's\nplace and I went to Galanta where my other sister, was and was bombed out both. My \u2014 Brno\nwas bombed out, the building. No one came back, and Galanta I had nothing there left. One boy\nwasn't home, so he came to see me in Budapest in 1942. And their parents were taking him\naway in '39, and then Miriam now asked for a paper from the agencies, from the Red Cross. So\nthey sent us that he was \u2014 he died of starvation in 1944 in Auschwitz. The only boy. Also \u2014 and\nafter the war, Trebisov, they didn't have Jewish life. Those people are like how \u2014 group like a\nghetto, stay together there in a bombed building and one got married. She's in Israel now, she is\na pharmacist, and no one is there now. Nobody stays there, and I got back a little money what\nmy mother left the woman, Christian, where my store was. She gave me back a little money.",
        "Q: So you went to Prague?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What did you do there?",
        "A: Oh, I just wanted to get out to United States, so I went to Germany from Prague.",
        "Q: You didn't stay in Prague then?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't stay. I just was inquiring which Visa is faster. If I can get out\nfaster from Czechoslovakia, so I registered also in Prague. But it was against the law, I was in the\nDP after the war. DP, displaced persons camp in Germany. After the war in Budapest, I went\nfirst to Szeged where I could eat. After that I came home to see if anybody 1s alive. No one was\nalive. I went to Germany because I heard they have established displaced person camps, and\nwhoever wants to come to register to the United States. So I knew I have my sister here, I\nwanted to come to the United States. I registered in both ways, which was illegal. My sister sent\nme once money. They put me in jail because I wrote to her, \u201cthank-you for the money,\u201d and\nthen the censor, they said, \"How come it's foreign currency? You cannot keep money.\" I said \u2014\nI had to lie, I'm sorry. I didn't, of course, I said that one dress would be $10. The one pair of\nshoes $10. So I thought then in relating $40 value what she would send me would be $40. So\nthey brought a translator in, and finally they let me out. But that was one day in jail.",
        "Q: When you say you registered in two countries, what were the countries?",
        "A: Czechoslovakia, Prague. Prague.",
        "Q: And the other?",
        "A: And the other was the \u2014 Leipheim, where I was registered in the DP camp from '45 \u2014 from '45, I\nregistered, and till '47, till I came to this country. But meanwhile I went illegally, you know, to\nthe Czechoslovakian, see again if I can come out faster.",
        "Q: Now in Leipheim, how large is the DP camp office? Can you tell me a little bit about it?",
        "A: They were barracks before, and they made them for DP \u2014 the DP camps. That was 1,000 \u2014 800\npeople there and one, two, three, five; maybe five big, huge barracks. And UNRRA*\u00ae supported\nfood, and we got little, little rations. You know, how much \u2014 I could finish it in two minutes.\nBut it was still a great help. And you could earn money if you wanted to work or teach. You\nwant to be a dressmaker, you organize a group and you get paid from the UNRRA. I didn't want\nto work, I said I worked so much in my life. I didn't want to work for money. My sister was\nvery good. She send me packages of cigarettes, and one piece \u2014 one box, you could live a week.\nAnd I moved to Miinchen\u00b0\u201d\u2019, and I traveled a lot, I traveled all over Germany.",
        "Q: How long did you actually stay in the camp in Leipheim?",
        "A: Registered. It went from 1945 till 1947.",
        "Q: You actually lived at this camp for two years?",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "Q: And you had complete freedom?\n\u00b08 United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\n\u00b0\u00b0 Munich, Germany",
        "A: Yeah. You can do anything you want to there.",
        "Q: Who were most of the other people who were at Leipheim? Where were they from?",
        "A: They were all displaced persons. My cousin was with me in the same room. She brought soap\nin this country. Soap from people, made from people. Nazis made soap from people. Nazis\u2019\nlamp shades and soap, and she carried that piece of soap with her. She showed me that piece of\nsoap made from people.",
        "Q: Where did she get it?",
        "A: Where did she get it? You know, I can't tell you, but I know her address. I can find out, but I\ndidn't care to know it. Everything was painful to find out. I don't know, it's just so painful to\nknow. But I know she carried it to the United States.",
        "Q: So you met up with her at Leipheim coincidentally?",
        "A: Right. I knew she's alive, and I went to \u2014 after the war, I walked 30 kilometers to their home to\nfind out who is alive. So I found her, she was lucky. Three sisters together, two brothers, they\nare still alive.",
        "Q: So how did you find out she was in Leipheim?",
        "A: We \u2014 she \u2014 we \u2014 how did I find out? We lived together in the same room, and her brother was\nwith me in the same room and that other strange boy. We were fir*? people, and before\nLeipheim when I went to see him, that was in Czechoslovakia. So then we made it up that we\ngoing to Germany, she wants to immigrate. She doesn't want to stay home.",
        "Q: In Leipheim, there were a lot of people there from concentration camps?",
        "A: Mostly, mostly everyone.",
        "Q: Did you talk to them? Did you learn what they experienced?",
        "A: One was more horrible than the other. One was more horrible than the other. There was not a\nstory, all were heroes in my eyes. I wasn't better than they were. I was luckier, but they were\nsuffering more. Everybody had a name [ed comment: name=number (tattoo)], and who had a\nname on their body, it was a horror, unbelievable. Shiver when you see tt.",
        "Q: Were you surprised by what they told you?\n40 four (Yiddish)",
        "A: Yeah. I was surprised, yes. I didn't expect that bad. Walking naked in the woods, walking\nnaked \u2014 just to punish them, not to give food, not to have water to drink, not to eat. One \u2014 my,\nmy \u2014I can\u2019t even \u2014 my, my niece, my cousin, she stole a little potato. How can you blame a\nlittle 17 year old beautiful girl, she steals? But she stole maybe somebody else's life. That little\npotato was somebody else's life. The others, the cousin, I heard that cousin's cousin, somebody\nin the family; she washed herself with the water. She could save a people's life with that water.\nConditions unbelievable. I never thought so. And tortured them on the street \u2014 and nude \u2014 and\nhit them and kicked them, pulled them. Anything they wanted to do, like a piece of furniture, not\nhuman.",
        "Q: We need to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape 2.\nTape 3",

        "Q: You want to tell that story? Okay, I'll ask you about that.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Just sort of \u2014 we were talking about in Leipheim when you met up with all of these people who\nhad come out of Auschwitz and other camps. When you were in Budapest, did you know much\nabout the concentration camps?",
        "A: Not too much. Not too much. We just know they are gone, no one is here. That's all we knew.\nThere is not a single Jewish person alive in Budapest, except like I was, you know, Christian\npapers.",
        "Q: In the ghetto, there where some, I think.",
        "A: To the end, I don't remember. If it was, I don't remember.",
        "Q: But you hadn't heard stories about the death camps?",
        "A: Ghetto? No, no, I didn't hear anything. Only after the war when the concentration camp came\nback. You know, when everybody \u2014 my cousin who had that soap, piece of soap in her hands, it\nis earth shaking to me. They said lamps and soaps she carries with her. And she had numbers,\nand her brother was 60 pounds when he came out from the camp \u2014 Dachau \u2014 not Dachau. From\nthat horrible camp there which was the worst\u2014",
        "Q: Auschwitz?",
        "A: Auschwitz and then one more. Well, anyway, he had his share. Stories \u2014 it's no food, walking in\nthe rain, walking in outside nude just to suffer. Just to make them suffer.",
        "Q: What was it like living in this DP camp?",
        "A: Well, you see, I was very lucky. When I \u2014 in the DP camp as \u2014 DP camp, you had opportunities,\nif you were looking for. You could have courses, Hebrew and dressmakers, and any profession\nyou wanted to pick. You could get educated. If you want to leave the DP in the free world, you\ncould get prepared in that place if you didn't have any profession. Like my little cousin who\nlived with me, she was gorgeous and 17. So I told her to go and study Hebrew; she did. I told\n\u201c1 In a later conversation interviewee clarifies that it was Matyas Rakosi she\nmeant to refer to here.\nher to go to, I was like a mother to her, go to make \u2014 learn dressmaking. She made, she went.\nSo when she came to the United States after years, lucky, she studied in that dressmaker design\nschool, and she became a very good dressmaker. So you could make yourself anything you\nwanted to in that camp, if you wanted to. But I didn't feel like I wanted \u2014 life was very, very\nlimited and simple. But you had friends it was such a tight together. You know, like you're my\nbrother, you're my sister. You didn't feel like strange person there, 1t was one whole big family.\nIf you see a man, you didn't look at him like a man. But you looked and, \u201cOh, my gosh, thank\nGod he's here. That's my brother.\u201d If you didn't have any \u2014 you know if you didn't feel like a\nman. But it was all \u2014 or a sister or anybody, you had such a unity. And life was very, very\nsimple, and those people really didn't have too much strength to do anything more \u2014 they went to\neat. You went to lunch, get the dinner that little rations, what they got. In the morning,\nbreakfast, a little cereal, tiny milk, and that was it. You were hungry constantly even with the\nrations you got, you got there. But many people managed some way to make money. Some way\nthat they wouldn't have to be hungry. But from that rations, you had to be hungry. You didn't\nhave to starve to death, but it wasn't enough. And then the clothing, you could get free. So you\ndidn't have any worries how you get a dress, and rooms were free, of course. One room we were\nfour people in. My cousin and me and her brother and a little strange boy. It was nothing\nunusual to have a strange man in that room, or Nazis or with numbers or \u2014 I mean survivors. It\nwas nothing unusual. It was just accepted thing that girl \u2014 not scared \u2014 man, no man wasn't such\nthing in that time. She was Orthodox, my cousin. She is still, and it wasn't a difference. Not\nsupposed to be in the same room according to the \u2014 you know, regulations, Jewish. But was no\ndifference, and courses, they emphasized Hebrew courses very much.",
        "Q: So after a while, you weren't in the barracks. You had your own little apartment there?",
        "A: In Munchen, out of the camp. I didn't like that camp life.",
        "Q: Oh, how long did you stay actually living in the camp?",
        "A: Registered. I had to wait to come to the United States, I had to be registered there. I couldn't\u2014",
        "Q: But you didn't live there for very long?",
        "A: No, I traveled a lot, you see. So by traveling, I took a room in Munchen. It wasn't legal maybe,\nbut I did it. My sister send me packages and once \u2014 before I say that, 1t was almost in the...",
        "Q: Well, I think you've talked about it. It must have been quite wonderful to be able to be open. To\nbe able to be a Jew.",
        "A: Free. Fantastic. But 1t was such hopelessness there. There was no place, was no solution for it.\nOnly one solution was offered, that place to immigrate. That was the hope, the best place in the\nworld. But three-quarters of those people there, no one wanted to stay there; they wanted to go\nout from the country. That was good. But it was very depressing waiting three years. And\ntomorrow, they promise you tomorrow the quota, and you come tomorrow and a year later. Six\nmonths later, three months later, and it was always one year, two years, three years. For me it\nwas 'til 1947. It wasn't right. I didn't have in the camp registered DP camp. My friends went to\na city close by, a bigger city. Ginzburg or Ulm. And I went to say good-bye to them. I didn't\nhave my identification card \u2014 identification on me from the DP camp already, American DP\ncamp. They picked me up in that, in that truck, three soldiers. Here, you go in that truck. Took\nme to jail. Can you imagine how strict that was before? American soldiers did it to me; put me\nwith the prostitutes in Ulm in the jail. Next day, I said, \"How could you do that to me? Not\nenough I have to be with prostitutes after the war?\" I should \u2014 it was a court, the court made a,\nyou know, case out of it. And $50 fine, I said, \"Well, where would I get $50?\" $50 is like\n$50,000 to a person who doesn't have five cents. I said, \"I can't give you $50. I don't have\nmoney.\" So one man from the group said, \"I bail you out.\" In the, in the, in the jail, they gave\nyou a glass of grass with water, that was the soup. On the floor, you could sleep. Now, the\nAmericans, all right?",
        "Q: I think you had wanted to mention something about the Communist government that came in\nafter the war into Hungary.",
        "A: Well, the Communists liberated, so they took over Budapest, of course, the country. And there\nwere soldiers, Americans \u2014 Russian soldiers, and to me they were great. I was hungry. There\nwas nothing to eat, no place to shop. And I went \u2014 I knew that they have a big truck with bread.\nI said, \"I am hungry. Give me chleba*\u2019.\" I speak Slavic, you know, I speak Slovakian. I said,\n\"Davai chleba. Give me bread.\" They didn't ask me who I am. I said, \"I am freezing in my\nroom. I need wood.\" He went to the wood with \u2014 where is wood, you know, forest. Cut the\nwood off \u2014 cut the tree off, and carried it with other soldiers to my house. Cut it to pieces, I was\nwarm. That\u2019s Comm\u2014 American \u2014 the Russian soldiers. But they were always drunk. They\nsung on the street, doctor or a peasant, equally the same. They were drunk and drunk and drunk.\nAnd then \u201cYou have a watch? Davai chasi.\u201d\u201d Chasi is a watch. They said, \"Give me the watch.\nDavai chasi.\" They put it here on elbow from top till down, like kids; they never had a watch in\nRussia. So suddenly, \u201cdavai chasi,\u201d that means give me your watch. They didn't wait, they just\ngrabbed and took it off of your hands and put them on. And then they threw them away like\nkids; that was funny to me, very funny \u2014 how they had them. But they didn't want to go back.\nThey said, \"Why should I go back to my country? I don't have a family there left. They are all\nbombed out. I'm not going back.\" But there came the order three times, they have to go back\notherwise they are in Siberia. And one man who is 10 years 1n prison, Miklos that was his name.\nForgot his name, Miklos*\u2019. Maybe it will come back to me. He was from the democratic regime\nin Hungary, put to jail because he was a Communist for 10 years. And then he became in\ncharge, so what did he do? He killed people, and everybody could see hanging on the street, in\nthe big street in Budapest \u2014 on Andrassy ut. Hanging people, you pass by, you didn't think\nanything of it. You took everything such in stride, I don't know. You didn't think anything after\nthe war that man is hanging. You saw so many on the mountains piled up, so you just pass and\ndidn't think anything of it. And then maybe you expected that he was 10 years suffering in jail,\nthat he wouldn't be so sympathetic to the people. It was \u2014 after the war was still misery. No\n42 bread (Russian)\n45 Matyas Rakosi\nfood, even for everyone. Not only for the Jewish people now \u2014 equally. Couldn't get anything in\nthe stores. They were all empty. No food, what I mean just to survive. Sometimes the water\nwas pumped out. You had to travel miles to get a little water, probably.",
        "Q: So you decided to try to come to the United States?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. I could hardly wait to come over. And when I came on the\nboat...",
        "Q: In 1947?",
        "A: Seven. From Bremen, Germany. I thought I am dreaming, God, I was so happy. That breakfast,\nI never thought that one minute before we had such a horrible life, and here I am such a luxury.\nThis was like a dream, like a dream come true. You couldn't describe that feeling, you couldn't.\nJust the food by itself, you didn't concentrate on anything else. Just to be free and to have food.\nYou can walk; you can talk whatever you want to. That was just the most amazing thing to me.\nNo starving anymore. That was a luxury life. Everybody got sick, but I didn't so I was \u2014 on the\nboat. The boat was an army boat, the Ernie Pyle and water came in the boat. So we had to\nchange the direction. It took us three weeks to come United States. Wouldn't last that long if not\nwater in that boat. You know, accident. It was a dream.",
        "Q: Did you travel with anyone you knew?",
        "A: I traveled with many friends. I can't remember, but we all went apart. After the war, we had a\nlittle bit of contact from beginning. One is in Frankfurt. Yesterday, I just saw her picture. I\nforgot her name. I don't have any contact with them any longer, but some came to \u2014 in Frankfurt,\nI met them, and then United States, I didn't know where they went.",
        "Q: So tell me about your first impressions when you arrived in New York \u2014 you arrived in New\nYork?",
        "A: Yeah. A dream. A dream of dreams. My sister came, my brother was and a few friends, her\nfriends came to wait for me. And a bouquet of flowers, my brother. Couldn't breathe, I cried. I\njust cried. Couldn't believe it. Very emotional. The, the \u2014 that Statue of Liberty. Yeah, that was\nsomething to see it. I can't describe, even now it brings tears to my eyes. It was just gorgeous, it\nwas like heaven on earth. Kiss everyone \u2014 I couldn't stand anybody complained in the United\nStates. But even now I'm feeling there is no way to complain to me it is heaven even now. It's\nunbelievable. One minute away \u2014 I'm thinking one minute away. That was great, and I had a\ngreat sister and a great brother supported me in every way. Give me money right away, give me\nfive \u2014 $300, which was a fortune for a person who has nothing. And he said, \"You be\nindependent. I want you to be independent.\" But three weeks later, I went to work. I went to\nwork as a milliner, and I got a stitch infection. My body wasn't \u2014 just one stitch, with a needle. I\nhad to stay off because my hands were infected. But luckily, I got along with people very well. I\nmade very, very nice friends in New York and I am still friends with them. One died, and one\njust came to see me, who was in Europe, who was working for Rabbi Bernstein**. She was his\nsecretary, so I just met her last week. So I was lucky to have met someone. It's still a dream.",
        "Q: Did New York present any kind of culture shock? What here surprised you?",
        "A: In New York? It was everything, what you wanted to have. I went to lectures each time to Segal\n(ph) at synagogue. They had dances there every week. I went there. One man was there in that\ntime, he said he's a medical doctor. He said he want to marry me the next day. Not leaving\nanymore. I dream, it was everything from the first minute I came to this country, it was a dream\nin every way. Yes, culture I cultivated. I went to those lectures, Segal (ph) and then dances and\nthen the Jewish shows, free tickets for refugees. And Skulnik** for second [ed comment: Second\nAvenue- Yiddish theater] in New York, and the theaters I like all the time to go, yeah.",
        "Q: What was difficult for you? Anything?",
        "A: No. After the war, gosh, nothing was difficult. Nothing. I got a job night away. I didn't want a\njob. I, 1\u2014 when I got the stitches, I got paid for it. I could be independent. If I make a dollar, I\nstill have the dollar to put away. I could still eat, not to be hungry and to be independent. Fifty\ncents frankfurters. I was so proud it's mine.",
        "Q: It's sort of a strange question, but when you started working, you probably worked with some\npeople who had not been in Europe during the war.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did you ever talk about the war? Did you \u2014 were they surprised? Did they want to know\nanything?",
        "A: I tell you, I didn't want to talk about it. I didn't even talk to my children for years. I didn't want\nto bring it up. I didn't want to talk about it. Somebody brought Holocaust up, I just said, \"Sorry,\nI can't participate in that subject. I'm not ready for it. I don't want to talk about it.\" I couldn't\nbring myself together, even to my kids, to talk about it.",
        "Q: So you\u2014",
        "A: Painful, very painful.",
        "Q: ... you eventually met someone, got married?",
        "A: Yeah. But also in that one episode it was that jealousy was big, because I was good in my field.\nI can \u2014 I was already a milliner at home for many years, and I went to Bratislava and Budapest\n44 Rabbi Philip Sidney Bernstein, Jewish advisor to United States Army in\nEurope from 1945 to 1947, also served on Jewish Welfare Board. Encyclopaedia\nJudaica, s.v. \u201cBernstein, Philip Sidney.\u201d\n49 Menasha Skulnik, American comedian, popular star of New York\u2019s Second\nAvenue Yiddish theaters. Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. \u201cSkulnik, Menasha.\u201d\none of the best salons. And I was watching what others do, I observed because I had to. I had to\ncompete with everybody. So I was looking how to make the most, and that was jealousy many\ntimes. One woman said, \"Yesterday a woman was here. She was much worse than you are, and\nthey hired her.\" But they let me go because the forelady didn't want me. And then in Budapest\nwhere I was working one time, I made a hat, designed all by myself. And that design hat went\nall over the country, had orders. And the woman said, \"Cut off a certain part of the head. It\nshould be better.\" I said, \"Don't cut if off. It's perfect as it is.\" \"No, you do it.\" So then the\nforelady comes in, and she said, \"Who killed that hat?\" And she told it's me. She didn't took it\non herself because the forelady told me to correct it. I wanted to leave the store. That was the\nEuropean. But there was jealousy in jobs. As a foreigner, that what I noticed. But I work at\nmany places, they were sympathetic with me. They want me to come Saturday to work if I want\nmoney, even it's not right but I should come. Many places I was lucky. I didn't notice any anti-\nSemitism while I was working. I made friends while I was working, good friends. I didn't have\nthat problem with them, just the jealousy was more a problem. What I noticed. They were\nscared of it. If met somebody? Yes, I did.",
        "Q: How long did it take you?",
        "A: When I came in, I was engaged. When I came to this country in 1947. Yeah, I met somebody in\nGermany. I have his picture here. And I came out and he want me to come back after two years.\nI said, \"Oh, no way. I changed and you changed. Two years, it's too much. You lived through; I\nlived through. I'm not going back to misery again. I don't want to go on rations.\" And so then\nhe married and I married, too. Oh, my brother lived in Washington, had a little store. And I\nlived in New York, so I came to visit him. And I was helping him like a European sister,\ncleaning his jewelry and washing his floor, washing his windows. Like at home. And aman\ncame in, three customers, and they said if I am single, they have a man for me. And I was\ntalking on the telephone, he's a musician, a friend from Europe, from Brno where my sister was.\nAnd he belonged to my sister's congregation. When he was 13, he already played violin, he's a\nviolinist. And I was talking to him, I was always very happy to talk to him. So anyway, he said\nthey have a man for me, and I said, \"Okay, so let me meet him.\" To me \u2014 my brother had a date\nwith a girl, I said, \"I'm not going with you on your date. I need a man for myself.\" Just not to be\nwith him, not to spoil his date. So then my husband I met in his cousin's place, 1n his brother-in-\nlaw's. My husband didn't want to come to my brother's place, but he said he was going to his\nbrother\u2019s \u2014 brother-in-law's brother liquor store in Washington. I said, \"Okay, he's not coming\nhere. Iam going there.\" So my husband came, then he took me to his brother \u2014 he's a lawyer in\nFairfax, he was. Now, he's old and sick. Burstein, Robert Burstein. And they thought I would\nbe good for him, you know, for his brother. So in five days, he wanted to marry me. He was a\nvery set man, he always knew what he wants to do \u2014 what want to do. And I felt like he's very\nreliable and character is great, and I don't meet a man every day like that. So it took me five\nmonths to make up my mind. In January '51, we got married. He was an economist and a rabbi,\nhe missed but maybe a year or something. Very educated. A good person like human being, so\nthat was my good luck.",
        "Q: Do you have children?",
        "A: [have two girls. One is Miriam and the other is Susan. She's married 10 years, maybe more, to\na very, very nice Catholic lawyer \u2014 very nice man. And they have two [ed comment: three]\nadorable kids, Brian, Tony and John. I'm very happy with the kids, with them that they are\nhappy.",
        "Q: Let me just ask you a few general questions about all of this. When you look back, what do you\nthink \u2014 you're a single young woman going through all of this alone. What do you think gave\nyou the courage or the strength to do what you had to do?",
        "A: In the war?",
        "Q: Uh-huh [yes].",
        "A: I tell you it was just such an automatic thing to do; that man needs papers, and my life was so\nmiserable if I lose it, I have not too much to risk. Not too much to risk. If they catch me today \u2014\nthere's nothing safe. Was no \u2014I couldn't say I'm sitting in that chair and I'm safe. That chair\nwasn't safe for me. Nothing was safe. So I said if I have to do something with my life, that man\nwill be dead. He needs my help. And it was like such an automatic thing, I didn't think I am in\ndanger. I knew what I am going to do. I didn't think I am crazy, I knew exactly if I go there, it\nwill be danger. And, as I said, I didn't think, just that I have to do it. I didn't even think it's such\na great glory to me in that time to do it.",
        "Q: But all of your hiding and everything alone, was there something about your background, the\nway you grew up, your life before the war that prepared you for what you had to survive?",
        "A: Thad a very difficult life, youth. My father died when I was only 13 years old, and I didn't know\nmy father till nine years old. He was captured in Sarajevo, now in Serbia. I read his card, \"Send\nme money, send me food,\u201d sent to my mother, when he sent from there.",
        "Q: World War I?",
        "A: Yeah. World War I. I didn't know him. And when he came back after \u2014 he was captured in that\nSarajevo, and when he came back, I was nine years old, developed. Suddenly, you have a father.\nI didn't like that. He had a snuff box, Orthodox, you know, and I didn't like that smell. And then\nhe was teaching me how to pray Hebrew, and one day he cut \u2014 he tied me to the table, I should\nstudy; I didn't want to study. But that was punish your kids, in the name of God, you know, that\nthey should listen to you. I didn't like it. I was already not ready for that kind of treatment, you\nknow, I didn't like it. And then German, he taught me. And he played chess, he taught me. He\nmade chess and he played chess. He was a gabbai*\u00ae in the synagogue. You know, like a\npresident in the synagogue. And he was a respectable man because the honor, the name, if you\nare a rabbi's daughter, he is a rabbi's \u2014 a kvittel [ed comment: a kivttel- rabbi\u2019s family] of rabbis.\nHe came from that Loew, that big, golem family who made the golem. Kind of he related that he\ncomes from that family. Loew, in Prague, Rabbi Loew. And he created that golem? and he\ncame from that big, big family. So they got respect \u2014 and he was a teacher before he \u2014 when he\ngot married at 19 years old. And my mother, I remember, she used to wash dead people. She\nsaid that's the biggest mitzvah, biggest mitzvah in the world what you can do in your life.\nBecause they cannot repay you anymore. You do it for the sake of doing good. And she was a\nvery high \u2014 very, very high ethics, she had. Moral ethics. She always stressed money 1s \u2014 name\n46 sexton (Hebrew)\nis more worth it than money, all the time. Like gold, you know, that kind of Talmud. And once\nshe says she studied the book, and once she told me I was amazed; I was already a woman. And\nshe says that birds communicate. And I said, \"Where did you got it from?\" She said it is already\nin the Talmud book interpretation. And she studied a lot, and she took every day a newspaper\nand shared it with the neighbor, who had no money to buy it alone. But she had to have the\npaper. And hardworking existence, I don't think so she lived. Eight children. Eight children, no\nfather, but everybody when they grow up, congratulated my mother, how great the kids are. She\ndidn't do anything for them. One was a maid in a rich place, \u2014 an aunt\u2019s place \u2014 and another was\na maid in arich place. My uncle came to pick me up so I can study hats in his place. His\ndaughter was a millinery. I became a millinery. But they didn't register me for a year, sooner so\nI should work free. For three years, you had to pay if you study any trade. And after three years,\nyou get paid. So they didn't register \u2014 I worked four years, instead of three years. But it was a\ngood experience for me, they had a very disciplined, happy life, and I didn't have it at home. So\nthen my father died, and I cried day and night when I was young. I slept on the floor. I was\nhomesick when I went to that place, and sit on one place for 12 hours. Somebody died in the\ncommunity, I had to make the hat with her overnight. I was 13. I had to be up the whole night,\nmake that hat. It would be against the law if it's in this country, but I did it. And you had\nbreakfast, a cup of coffee and a slice of bread. Lunch, a good lunch, but I could have three\nlunches, I was so hungry. And then you have 7 o'clock dinner: a slice of bread with a cup of\ncoffee. There now, I was hungry. That wasn't \u2014 but I always prayed to God he should make me\nnot only independent, I shouldn't need anyone. I should have my bread and water. That's all I\nwant, I don't want more. Just I should be my bread and my cup of water. I shouldn't need any\ncharity that was my desire all the time my life to...",
        "Q: This was as a young girl?",
        "A: Very young, 13 when I was in my aunt's place. I said \u201cthat's enough for me. Should be my\nbread, don't give me anything.\u201d I don't want anything. And my mother was strong. She was\nvery proud, she didn't take charity. She wouldn't take charity. When the Germans, Nazis, the\nCzech Nazis came in, the Hlinkova Garda, one very rich man wanted to give my brother suits.\nHe didn't need them because they take them away. They take away \u2014 the Nazis took away, if\nyou had one dress, two dresses, took away one. The whole house cleared it out. You know that\nprocedure. And my mother didn't want it. She said, \"No, darling, you don't take it. You don't\nneed it. You have what you have, and that's enough for you.\" Very proud, didn\u2019t want \u2014 and\nvery, very hard working. She was like a slave to me, like a slave. It was a very difficult life.\nEarly morning, late at night, no husband to support anyone. It was \u2014 but she had faith in God.\nThat faith kept her, faith in God.",
        "Q: You think that kept you going, too?",
        "A: I think so. I think so, yeah. I always said I have to live through that. I have to live. I know it's\nimpossible, though, logically. But inside of me I always, yes, I have to live through that war.",
        "Q: Do you think that your religious beliefs helped you survive?",
        "A: I was never that big, I was never \u2014 it was just a pattern made for me from my mother's place. But\nI questioned all the time something in religion. And once I belonged to three organizations, they\nkicked me out. Because one is Agudah, the Mizrachi, I'm a Shomer and I'm a Jabotinsky. And I\nwas in all four of them. Then I decided Allgemeine Juedische Organisation, Allgemeine\nJuedische Organisation*\u2019, that means United Jewish Organization, and I thought people shouldn't\nfight. There's no reason to be more religious and non-religious. My brother was a rabbi at home.\nMy brother, the rabbi \u2014 brother-in-law \u2014 came to see my mother, I have to say that story. The\nother was a schochet, he came to see my mother in my house. My mother was very religious.\nMy brother who came to the United States was not educated, and he touched the open bottle of\nwine. Nobody would drink that wine. I couldn't accept it, 1t was just over my head. I couldn't,\nand I just questioned.",
        "Q: Yeah, but, nevertheless, throughout the war\u2014",
        "A: I kept the tradition.",
        "Q: ... you tried to observe holidays. You tried\u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: ... to keep kosher.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You prayed. I mean, it must have given you some sense of strength.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I think I got it from my mother. I think I got it from my mother, and it was always\nin my mind \u201cyour name and your name.\u201d You know, it's better than gold, and that kind always\nin the moral standards. I think that was my mother's doing. And one thing she always said I\nhave to have it good in life, because I'm a good person. That kind of carried me; that she had\nfaith that I want \u2014 she always said, \"Don't bring me shame on my head.\" She said it to my\nbrother, and the stories all over, I think she had something to do with that. Yeah, I was, I went to\nsynagogue almost every time I could. Shabbos, even then, and that was danger. And, as I said,\nit's on Yom Kippur when they came to ask me money. I said, \"I need money.\" They wouldn't\nbelieve me because my manicured hands and my clean dress I had one dress. They stole my\ndresses. I washed out the belt, I washed out the collar, and I went to work. But water was very\nrationed. You were not home at 4 o'clock, you don't have water. If you have one dress and it's\nnot clean, you cannot go to work.",
        "Q: Once you had these Christian papers, it never occurred to you to stay Christian?\n47 Allgemeine Juedische Kolonisations Organization, a short-lived general\nZionist organization started in 1908 by Alfred Nossig. Encyclopaedia Judaica,\ns.v. \u201cNossig, Alfred.\u201d",
        "A: No, no. I don't believe in that. I'm not such strong Jew that I should change right away.\nBecause I am a good Jew maybe in my heart. But I couldn't change it. What would I \u2014 no.",
        "Q: Were you ever confronted with moral choices that were difficult to make during the war?",
        "A: Well, yes. My friend, desperate, she said she's in love with a married man who supports her.\nAnd she thinks that that married man that married man's wife is the prostitute, not she. She's not\nthe prostitute because she is living with a man she doesn't care for, and he\u2019s living, ergo, she is\nthe one who is entitled. And she says that she has a man for me. It was nothing unusual,\nnothing. Such a \u2014 sometimes it was a blessing who could do it. I didn't have shoes. Maybe that\nsaved me \u2014 I was embarrassed I didn't have shoes. But that was, yes, 1t was many times. And\nthen the $500 Peng6 [ed comment: Pengo is Hungarian currency] somebody offered, my friend\ntold me if I go with him. No, I couldn't follow it. I didn't follow one; I didn't follow the other.\nBut it was nothing bad in that time. You know, it was \u2014 nobody would point out that you did\nsomething wrong because your life was at stake. That money, it saved your life.",
        "Q: But you didn't do it?",
        "A: I didn't even having second thoughts, I was insulted. I didn't want to talk to that girl any longer,\nbut it was, yeah. It was facing many such little episodes. One man wanted to give me lunches,\nin a restaurant...\u201c give you lunch...\u201d",
        "Q: When you think back now about these years, 50 years ago, are there certain images that stick\nwith you?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Every day. You can't get away from it. I get very mad if they say, \"Don't forget it.\" If\nthey \u2014 they have a lecture, Senior Citizen Survivor Center, \"Don't forget.\" What are you talking\nabout? It's the whole family, not a person. \"Don't forget.\" There hasn't been a day what you\nwouldn't remember every one. Even my husband has been dead eight years, I remember him\nevery day. And now, the whole family, a nice family. I would have a great family. I have no\none from my family. Two years ago my sister and brother died, but they\u2019re a great family.\nYeah, you can't forget. It sticks to you lifelong, I feel that way. You can't. Eight children. One\nwas a year old.

        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: What do you think that these experiences, how have they affected your life today?",
        "A: It's hard to say, because I keep blessing my God. That he gave me such a long life and such a\nhappy life here in this country. I married a wonderful man, couldn't get a better person. A better\ncharacter, you couldn't get. He was a rabbi and an economist, he was in the government.\nBesides this, he was gentle human being, a mensch**.

        "Q: Yes, you mentioned them.",
        "A: Three grandchildren, and Miriam. So I had a full, full life, and I blessed to God that he gave me\nthat in this country.

You have to do it, and I didn't feel I am doing something very big. I\ndidn't feel like I'm such a big hero. I just did what I have to do. I was there in that minute they\nneeded me. That boy is dead without me, and life was tough. IfI lose my life there, maybe I\nwould lose it regardless. That was my idea, but I wasn't crazy. I knew what I am doing.

        "A: Oh, he \u2014 random. On the street. I just met him. I met everyone \u2014 I never knew \u2014 they warned\nme not to talk to him, and he faces me right away when I walked on the street.",
        "A: When I was in TrebiSov, they already knew he's there in Budapest, and everybody, \"Keep away\nfrom him. Keep away from him.\" To me, it was a good luck.",

        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh, I worked a million places nght away. That was a clothing store. The other was a sugar\nfactory. The third was a maid. I had to change very often because it was dangerous. Somebody\nrecognized me, I'm Jewish, I had to run away and leave the money. I worked there and\nsomebody would suspect you, that was enough to leave the job for me.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Hungarian.",
        "A: Czechish. So you couldn't have contact. You avoided every contact possible. You didn't know\nanybody. If your mother would pass by, you wouldn't say hello to her. You would be scared\nthat it\u2019s a chain. I know her, whom she knows and it would be on and on. So we didn't have\nfriends really. But one group we met in the park, they were also Czechish like I was, but already\nHungarian Jews. And we met occasionally, once a week or twice a week. One boy was missing.\nWe were scared what happened to that boy. So the Nazis, his brother was with him, and his\nbrother said he \u2014 two weeks later he escaped the Nazis, but now he will need papers because he\nis without papers lost. Identification card. Clear?",
        "A: You not there yet?",
        "A: Okay, darling. Yeah.",
        "A: No, no. Say whatever you want.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Of course there were, yes. But you just look at them, and you run away from them.\nYou wouldn't stop them.",
        "A: That's a good question. You know, I was thinking about that many times, and I couldn't really \u2014\nI went to a kosher restaurant, there I made my friends. I made many friends. I mean, like me,\nyou know. But that group, I can't remember how I met them, but we kept seeing each other\nalmost for a year in that park. We know each other by names, but maybe we didn't even want to\nknow there. I can't remember where we met them. In that park it was close by to me, and I went\nthere to sit down, to escape everything. And it seems like that was the place, but I wouldn't\nswear on it now after so many years. Just I know we met each week or twice a week, you know,\nto know that they are there; they are alive.",
        "A: People?",
        "A: Yeah. I wrote it down, I forgot. I went there last two years ago, so I go to visit. Hmm, I have it\nwritten down, I forgot now.",
        "A: Koruti Park*', Circle Park. K6ruti Park, Hungarian.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: From the beginning, you might want to say or when the Nazis came in?",
        "A: Well, I was there from the beginning. It was a normal life, cheder open and kids with peyes\u201d\nrun everywhere and many synagogues \u2014 I used to go in the synagogues. And one day, I never\nforget, the Dohany Utca Synagogue, which is now a museum. Dr. Hevesi\u2019? was a lecturer. And\nYom Kippur, I went there, and they asked me, they came with a ticket and they said, \"Give me\nmoney.\" On Yom Kippur, they want a contribution. And I said, \"I need money.\" They thought\nI'm joking because I had to be dressed very clean to be able to get a job. If you're dirty and your\nnails are dirty in Budapest, out of work. You don't have a job. So the regulations they have\nthere, so what did I want to say?",
        "A: Oh, religious. People went to synagogue like here in Washington, wouldn't be any difference.\nThere were organizations, Agudah\u201d* was very popular, and synagogues were three, four. One\nRabbi Adler was there and his sister. The only person who let me in her house was that rabbi's\nsister who was married to a cantor, and she let \u2014 1t was dangerous to let me in, and she was the\nonly one who let me in. So they raise kids \u2014 Woman was working, to my surprise, more than in\nCzechoslovakia. In Czechoslovakia, Orthodox rabbis' daughters don't work \u2014 or children. And\nhere a woman was working and education was stressed. They know so much, even girls study\nmore than I did, we did in Czechoslovakia. And they all worked, everybody, girls, it was a big\nchange there. Religious kids started to work and have professions. Before they didn't have that.\n\u201c1 In a later discussion with the interviewee, she indicated that this meeting\nplace was actually Varosliget, the city park of Budapest.\n2 earlocks worn by Hasidic Jews (Hebrew)\n\u201c3 Simon Hevesi (1868-1943), chief rabbi of Budapest.\n24 Political and social movement popular among Orthodox Jews of Eastern\nFurope.

It was no different than here, a normal life.",
        "A: From the beginning when I was there? No, but automatically the same law started like in\nCzechoslovakia. Exactly the same, they copied. Because Nyilas*\u00b0 they were the Nazis. The\nNazis did the same thing that the Hlinkova Garda did in Slovakia. Labor camps \u2014 forced labor\nand then took them away one by one.",
        "A: Before, before. Before, everything before.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It changed because after a while they had the same stars to put on \u2014 yellow stars. Then they had\nthe same taking away the boys to labor camp. There was Dohany, a Dohany where they used to \u2014\nand they organized ghettos.",
        "A: Oh, oh, oh. Well, in 1942 was great, till 1943 \u2014 end of 1943 \u2014 it started really serious business\nwith taking them away and put stars, losing jobs, closing the stores, curfew on the streets. You\ncouldn't be on the street. And almost paralyzed Jewish life. No Jewish life left over. Little by\nlittle, they took the men away just as much the \u2014 as in Czechoslovakia \u2014 the boys away so you\ndidn't have .... Then they took the girls away. So Budapest was practically without of Jews.\nAll stores closed, to the end. And from beginning, it was automatically it was like step by step\nthe same design followed the Nazis' order.",
        "A: Oh, I couldn\u2019t say that's normal. You didn't know what you're eating. I don't know where you\nsleeping. You don't know where you working. I don't think of it as normal. IfI think of it now,\nI can't 1t believe how I could survive. I wouldn't call it normal by any means. Relatively, oh,\n9 Nyilaskeresztes Part Hungarista Mozgalom (also referred to as \u201cArrow Cross\u201d\nor \u201cGreenshirts\u201d), Hungarian fascist party lead by Ferenc Szalasi.\nEncyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. \u201cArrow Cross Party.\u201d\nyes. If I was thinking how those people in the concentration camps, I thought I'm \u2014 I saw people\non the street hitting them. Policemen hit the old people walking, they couldn't walk \u2014 hit them.\nSo I would think, \u201coh, gosh, I am vacationing,\u201d if I see this. And ghetto \u2014 I pass by a ghetto I\nhad one loaf of bread. I was saving that for the whole week. There's a woman in the entrance. I\nsaid, \"Take that bread.\" I will never forget her face was yellow-green, and she was crying. She\nsaid, \"I cannot take that bread away from you.\" I said, \"Just take and run because I will be\ncatched, nobody will be happy.\" So it was such an impossible, but why didn't woman didn't run\naway, I don't know. The door was open. The ghetto door was open. People didn't believe it,\ncouldn't believe it, that could happen. Even they were in ghetto, they still couldn't believe it, that\ntragedy what waits for them \u2014 it's unbelievable. Gosh, bombs \u2014 day by day, I saw mountains of\npeople like potatoes, like potatoes. One hit my house, where I was with a Christian family\nalready, since I'm Christian. And they had a little soup, a bowl of soup. They gave me one\nspoon, and six other people ate the same \u2014 from the same plate. One spoon, bowl of water, but\nthat was all \u2014 we couldn't have. We couldn't go out on the \u2014 one woman, we were in bunker for\nthree months in sand, sleeping. You couldn't go out, it was bombing constantly. Budapest was\nburning day and night. I was happy about when it was burning, to be honest. If I die, Samson.",
        "A: That was already in 1944. The most critical time, and no one could be Jewish any longer. There\nwere no Jews.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, how I became Christian? Well, there was no more \u2014 my identification Jewish-Hungarian\nwasn't good anymore because there were no more Jews. So I had to change my name for\nChristian Jew, Hungarian Jew.",
        "A: Hungarian Jew? Till 1943, 1943.",
        "A: Of course. My God, many times they brought on me a policeman one day in the restaurant\nwhere do I get the ration papers, it was illegal. And then one day, I go in the park because there's\na razzia, it will be in that street. I should go in the park that will be safe. So I went to the park.\nOne man, a Nazi newspaperman, was in charge of the building where I stayed and he 1s there in\nthe park and he stops me. And we talked together, and then he says where I am from. And I said\nI didn't even know because my Hungarian name, I still had Hungarian name, Jewish name. And\nhe said he's going to my city. I said my mother was yesterday here and he wanted to say\nsomething to him, that he should go to visit my mother because he knew the city. I said don't go\nbecause my mother was yesterday here. Then he takes my pocketbook away with force. In that\npocketbook was my life. If you don't have any papers with you, you're dead. And I knew he's a\nNazi newspaperman. I knew he's in charge of that building, and I run after him. He said, \"Why\nare you so nervous?\" I remember he's asking like now. And I said, \"I am insulted that you took\nwith force my papers. You didn't ask for them.\" He tells me, \"I thought that you are a very\nnaive girl. Now, I know that you are raffiniert?\u00b0.\". Like shrewd, raffiniert. Raffiniert is more like\na shrewd girl, a Hebrew girl. \"Just tell me when you came from Czechoslovakia to this country.\"\nHe did not report me. I left. Two weeks later somebody went there .... Were such magic\nthings, such un.... When I am walking on the street and a policeman is coming. And a man\nbehind me came over, and he says I \u2014 he knows me. I never saw him before, I didn't even know\nhe exist there. You know such coincidence. And in the restaurant, policeman was \u2014 he got shut\nthis door and he brought Nyilas, you know, the Nazi Nyilas? And he said I should identify\nmyself. You know identification cards. I said, \"I left them home.\" You know, just to let \u2014 well,\nanyway many such episodes. Many, many, many more. At night I was waken up at midnight. I\nshould him the papers, and that cantor's wife's sister was with me. Said, \"Don't be next time\nwithout paper identification,\" and left me there. Another story they locked me in the restaurant\nand my \u2014 my kosher restaurant in Dob utca nine [9 Dob Street], and he said, \u201cA Nazi's coming\nin to check everybody. You run.\" I left everything, run on the street day time. It was \u2014 you\ndidn't know what you're doing from minute to minute. I was a maid because I didn't want to eat.\nGoing to eat places. Then I was washing the dishes in the restaurants, so I should have food, I\nshould not be hungry. Washing dishes in a restaurant by myself, unbelievable.",
        "A: Didn't trust anyone. You just didn't trust anybody because Jewish people you couldn't. You\nwere scared of them and yourself, and Christians, you couldn't. And the end \u2014 well, I \u2014 the end,\nto the end where only Christians could be like, how I got the Christian papers. So, my brother-\nin-law was a cantor, and his congregant was one of the woman who had \u2014 that Adler who gave in\nBudapest \u2014 who gave me the Christian papers. Kovacs Gizi is my name now. He had always\ncontact and money. He was Jewish, but he had such wonderful job as a Christian. He didn't\nlook like Jewish. So he gave me the papers, Christian papers. Follow?",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: Yeah. Mid,1943. Well, you could have the whole house full of diamonds. If you wouldn't have\nthe identification papers, your life was not worth that of a penny. So there is my friend, Joseph\nAdler, and he was \u2014 he had an aunt in that place where my brother-in-law was a cantor, so he\nhelped me. And until today, we are friends, and I went to his grandchild's wedding two months\nago, 800 people. It was fantastic. [Indecipherable]. So he gave me the Christian papers,\nChristian Hungarian papers. And he gave me money, and he helped also other, a rabbi was next\nin that same floor. Without any question, he went in which was dangerous and gave him money\nand identification papers.\n76 cunning, crafty (German)",
        "A: He had a contact with the one Christian man, and that Christian man was somebody very\nimportant. And he gave him all the identifications what he needed, and so he helped many out\nwith money, because he always had money, and he helped me out with the papers.",
        "A: Oh, all right.",
        "A: I don't know\u2014\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2",
        "A: And you want to know I came from the Golem family. Who made the Golem, the Rabbi Loew,\nfrom Prague, I came from that family. My mother always said, \"Don't forget your name.\"",
        "A: Okay, if you want it.",
        "A: It's up to you.",
        "A: No, I just, I just \u2014 if you wanted that.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Well, it was like one boy I used to meet at the kosher \u2014 Dob utca Nine was a kosher\nrestaurant in Budapest, okay? And I was kosher and I went every day, and there was a boy and I\nmet him there. And he said he is having \u2014 he has identification papers if somebody wants it, but\nfor money. I had no money. I was lucky I have from day to day \u2014 if you worked a week, you\ncould buy yourself on black market one slice \u2014 one loaf of bread. But normally, you had to work\nfor a week. But I said to that boy, \u201cI have one ring. I had a ring from home, from my\nhometown, a small ring. I give you that ring in deposit. The woman cannot come today over to\nbring me money, but she has to get the papers today because tomorrow, you never know what\nhappens to her. So leave me the papers. You come tomorrow if you want to, to my place, and I\ngive you cash. I see her tonight. I promised her to bring her the papers.\" He said, \u201cI cannot give\nyou. I need the money.\" I said, \"I cannot \u2014 you cannot,\" \u2014 he was in my room. \"You cannot go\naway with that paper now. You have to give me that paper.\" \"I can't.\" I said, \"I don't care. Here\nis my ring. Take my ring.\" So he listened. It was good, and I went to give that paper to her.\nAnd then she gave me her bracelet, which I carried, I thought if \u201cshe will come back. At once \u2014I\ndon't ked it, I will have everything after the war. Give her back.\" So she gave me her ring and\nher bracelet and, of course, she didn't come back. And one woman the same way, I give her the\npapers, that boy left the papers without money. Give her another ring. The same ring I gave for\ntwo people, I took back that ring. And she came back, but she couldn't survive; her body didn't\nwork. They didn\u2019t eat and they ate and then they got sick, and it was so she didn't. But those\ntwo people \u2014 those two people I remember exactly how it was.",
        "A: Oh, Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler \u2014 nobody was Jewish anymore, okay? 194\u2014 end of 1943 and '44\nbeginning, no Jews.*\u2019 And so Adler, we met in the restaurant occasionally, and he said, \"Here\nare your papers, and here is your money. And I have a place where I live, you can come to live\nthere.\" But we didn't know each other. You know, we did not suppose to talk to each other, we\ndidn't know each other, that they shouldn't suspect us. And so then I was lucky, he occasionally\ngave me money. And then to the end it wasn't good anymore either. So he left his \u2014 I didn't live\nthere anymore. I had to find a new place.\nHow did I find a new place? I was working in Rothchilds \u2014 in that elite salon, aristocrats. And I\nam going home, and my colleague, my girl, who was working with me dresses, I said to her,\n\"You know my housewife\" \u2014 how she said? \"My landlady \u2014 landlord has a guest. Her sister\ncame from someplace, and I cannot stay there tonight. If you could take me, I will sleep on the\nfloor. Anyplace you want just to have\" \u2014 5 o'clock is curfew. You cannot be on the street. So\nshe let me, and that was my good luck and I stayed with her. But it was already bombing,\nconstantly bombing it was on and on and on. I don't know if you want that part now. And I\nstayed \u2014 three Jewish \u2014 her brother-in-law and her two sisters, we were in the same building\ntogether. There was unselfishness, I would never believe it. She's asking me, \"Malvina, Gizi,\nwhen is Yom Kippur?\" She knew I am Jewish \u2014 didn\u2019t report me, and she \u2014 unbelievable how\nunselfish those people were while I was with them. You know, slice of bread or water, 1t was\nlike life saver, and they didn't care. They gave me just as much as they had. We should come to\nthe bunker how everybody had to be curfew and bombs were hitting the city constantly. And in\na certain hour or a certain time, they were announcing each day, when we have to go in the\nbunker. Bunker, you know what 1s a bunker? So we went in the bunker one time tn the length of\nthree months. Didn't go out, didn't go in. And one girl says, \"I can't stand it,\" a young woman. I\njust see her in front of my mind. \"I have to get water.\" \"Don't go, don't go, sweetheart.\" Bombs\nhit her and she never came back. Just for water, but she wanted to go there. But it was just such\na critical time, people are \u2014 and that bunker life three months, unbelievable. Three months in one\nplace, one seven-story building. And one day I am standing in front of the building \u2014\noccasionally, I \u2014 she lived, we lived on the first floor \u2014 occasionally, we went up to the first floor.\nNot permitted, everybody had to be downstairs, but since it was first floor, so we went up. And I\nam standing in front of the window, and the bomb hit the whole building and that little window\nwith my friend. Scattered bombs you know and all windows are broken. And we are here like a\nmiracle. Nothing happened to both of us. And we couldn't eat; we had no place to go. The\nstores were closed and bombed out. You could steal \u2014 they didn't call it stealing. We had to\nwork for it. Confiscating or something. Confiscating, but not stealing. And they had ice cream\ncones, so I took ice cream cones and put water in it. It was lucky, and my friend's uncle came.\n\u201c7 The conditions for Jews in Budapest quickly deteriorated after the German\ntake over of the city on March 19, 1944.

So I gave him as much I could, and one day I went for a bread. They said that place will\nhave bread, and I met a friend who pretended he's blind. He said, \u201cWhat the heck you doing on\nthe street? It's curfew.\u201d No one was on the street. I was the only one. \u201cYou cannot do it. I'll\ngive you money, if you need money. You don't go out on the street any longer.\" And that kind\nof \u2014 on the street, you couldn't see anyone. As I said, except the mountains dead people scattered\nin one section. And one restaurant was open one hour a day, and there were many dead people\naround here. You didn't mind. You just went through and went in and ate if you got a cup of\nsoup, and went back again.

        "A: Yeah. I wouldn't do it anymore. If I think of it now, it was so silly. And, you know, that nicest\npart was, I didn't have to do it. I didn't have to observe according to the rabbis. I could do\nanything I wanted to. It's a style, or, I don't know, way of life, I guess.",

And one day I came to her \u2014 nobody was around us \u2014 I said, \"Are you\nJewish?\" And she says, \"No, Iam not Jewish.\" And here I went to synagogue, and she 1s there.\nSo in synagogue, I used to go in Dohany Utca, in what is now a museum. I used to hear\nwonderful lectures by Dr. Hevesi. He was a wonderful lecturer. It was so quiet when he was\ntalking, and I was so impressed with him. And that was like a hiding place, no place to go. It\nwasn't safe either. It was public, 1t was \u2014 never public places they didn't advise us to be. We\nwere supposed to be hiding all the time someplace where nobody would see us.

The\nwhole world is quiet. Nobody cares, and we were angry. We were very much angry, not only on\nthe whole world, that they let something like that happen. But we were also angry, if I may say,\nin that time when Jewish people were still all right that they were so indifferent. They were so\nindifferent. They didn't raise, we didn't hear any screaming, didn't have any help from anyplace,\nand we felt very, very bad about it, angry. We were angry. Simply very, very angry that we can\nsit in nice warm place, and I\u2019m starving and freezing to death, had no shoes. One hole was snow\nand the other one went out the snow. So it was anger and such hopelessness. Can't do anything\nfor them. And when I saw those people, I said, \"Thank God. What do I have to complain? I'm\nvacationing.\" That's the way I felt.

I can't remember. And the other was \u2014 I\ncan't remember. I just remember Perl Duri, with his friend \u2014 because I went to visit him after the\nwar \u2014 with his mother survived. In Trencianski-Martin**. Trencianski-Martin, a Slovak in Tatry,\nhe lived. I remember exactly. And then Salgo Tibor (ph) and Salgo Willie (ph), those two\nbrothers. And then the other married couple, one more was missing, was there. I can't remember\nthe names, but I have four names. And then one time \u2014 one day one of the brothers were\nmissing, the Salgo, not married. The other was also single, Willie, and he is not in.\nSo we wotried, since one is missing that's some bad news for everyone. So his brother worried,\nand he said after two weeks that he find his brother. He came out, he was captured by the Nazis,\nhanged 10 days from the ceiling with hands up in the back tied together. Cigarettes in the back\ntesting how much he can take, and electrical wires in his mouth and, of course, tortured him as\nmuch they could. So, luckily, the bomb hit the building after 10 days to be tortured and hanging\n3\u00b0 Varosliget\n3+ Street name unverifiable.\n5 Tur\u00e9ansky Svaty martin, CZ\nfrom the ceiling. He escaped, but he was blue, green and yellow, you know, from all this torture.\nHe had to hide in the bunker, and when he came out, so he needed papers. With his papers he is\nlost. So, after he looked a little better, his brother decided that he will ask his General friend \u2014\nChristian. He was working in the pharmacy, and then he met that General, Hungarian-Christian.\nAnd he gave him a paper that he requests from the National Printing Office, identification cards\nfor laborers to work in a factory \u2014 in a munitions factory. And I will be there, they shouldn't give\nanybody the papers, just for me. And he's sending me, assistant, to the National Printing Office\nwhich was located \u2014 I see it now, like a \u2014 Vaci Utca, like in the Fifth Avenue. And his brother \u2014\nI didn't know where that place is \u2014 took me. Three blocks away he was waiting, if I come out\nalive. So I went in, in the National Printing Office. There was a young man \u2014 luckily, I got them\n500 identification cards. I didn't look at them. I just grab them. I don't know; I went out. I\ndidn't breathe, I guess. Very \u2014 and then that boy was waiting for me who was hanged, you know.\nSo I gave him the papers and he ran away, and he gave it to others that he had contact. What\nkind contact? That brother who was working in the pharmacy they made the arrangements to\nmeet all the men there, and he will give them from the pharmacy \u2014 because it's open to the\npublic, it's a safe place \u2014 and he said so many and so many people only, so many and so many\nhours. Divided the time they shouldn't be all at one time there. He said he saw everybody, he\ntold me that he saw everybody who's coming in. But he was there incognito, they shouldn't see\nhim; he was hiding behind in the back somehow. And I went there three times. I don't want to\ntell you how scared I was each time to go in. And the fourth time \u2014I got three times, okay, 500\nand 500 \u2014 and the fourth time, they wouldn't give me it. But I noticed that they want to call the\npoliceman on me, the Nazis, so I run out. How I did that, I don't know. So that was my lucky\nstar in that time that I could make it. And there, I met them in 1981 \u2014 \u201981 when it was the\ninternational convention in Israel. My husband and Miriam were with me. [ed comment: met\nTibor and Willie]",

And now he has a\nfamily and grandchildren, he's happy and he was a pioneer. From the 400 people on the boat, the\nfirst to go to Israel. And there were seven survived, and he was the one among the seven that\nsurvived. And his brother is a doctor now, he's retired. And he has a family, beautiful children,\nand they came to visit me also to Washington to Silver Spring. But when I met him I lost the\nconvention. I thought \u201cI am dreaming\u201d and he didn't stop repeating, \"Malvinka, Malvinka,\"\ntalking Hungarian because I speak and he speaks Hungarian, \"You are my heroine, you saved\nmy life. You saved my life. You are a hero, you are great.\" You know, that kind of thing. I\nthought \u201cI am dreaming,\u201d it was great. And his brother also came.",

How can you do\nit? What would you do if somebody \u2014 something like that happens to your wife or your sister or\nmother?\" So they let her go. She said, \"You owe me that because I did not report you, and I\nknew you are, Nazi \u2014 you know, you are Jewish.\" And life, you couldn't have food. You didn't\nhave anything. Even after the war, the stores plundered\u2014 everybody steal whatever they could.\nThere was no established law. After maybe four or five months later, they said, \"Hey, you\n\u00b07 The Soviet Army liberated the Pest portion of the city in January of 1945,\nand went on to liberate the Buda portion the following month. Encyclopedia\nof the Holocaust, s.v. \u201cBudapest.\u201d\ncannot do it any longer.\" From December to summer, I think. You know, you could take and\nnobody would bother you. But after a while, the law came that you cannot steal or take anything\nanymore, so what we did \u2014 there was no food, no stores, no place to go shopping, after the war.\nThe only great thing was you had freedom. You could breathe, and I thought that's best in the\nworld what you can get after \u2014 that we are alive. So I went to see that man [Tibor] who was that\nfriend who was alive. My Christian lady [landlady] took me to him, and I was happy that he's\nstill alive. We didn't know anything. And he took over an office, a doctor's office because he\nhad two years of medicine already. And he said it's horrible, no drugs, and he had to take the\nbombs \u2014 the shrapnel out of people. Cold freezing hospitals. No heat and no drugs. He said it's\na horrible, horrible condition. So while he was going to hospital, curing the people, and if he saw\nsomebody's very sick even before, he took his identifications away and gave it to someone else.\nI was waiting for food. Kitchens on the streets for everyone. But from the morning to the night I\ncould wait for a cup of soup. I waited, and I got his soup and luckily and he could be in the\nhospital. But after a while, we decided we are going to Szeged, plenty food, another city \u2014 a\ndoctors\u2019 university. So he went to enroll to the doctor, finish, and I was staying there till I\nwouldn't be hungry anymore. Once they got me, the policeman, I had wanted to sell. But they\ndidn't put me in jail. You know, they just took away my blackmail \u2014 or black market. There it\nwas already food plenty. Plenty food in Szeged. Then I wanted to see who's at home in\nTrebisov. I knew it's a magic, if somebody will come back.\nI didn't want to dream. I still \u2014 I took a train overnight, three weeks on the top of the train and I\ntraveled. And Red Cross occasionally stopped the train and gave us soup or something, so in\nthree weeks I came home traveling on the top of the roof. Soldiers went home. The soldiers\ndidn't want to go back to Russia. They got an order if you're not coming three times. If you're\nnot coming on the third order, you will be sent to Siberia. So then they went back on the same\ntrain what I went on the top of the train. And I came home and, of course, there 1s \u2014 we owned a\nhouse and a restaurant, and my mother still owed money on that building. So I stayed till I could\nmake \u2014 pay off the house. So I was dreaming, I wasn't believe it that somebody's coming back,\nthey should have at least a place. So I went in my house, they hit me, why I didn't stay with the \u2014\nwhy I didn't die with the Nazis, because the Christian woman took over. She was one time a\nmaid in my mother's place, so she lives now in my building, in my house. It was a nice house.\nAnd she hit me, and I wanted, you know, sentimental things what I could out from there, so I\ntook a policeman and we went back. She hit me again in front of him. Such a\u2014 soaked over\nCommunism \u2014 I mean, Nazism. Everybody was a Nazi. One boy who hit my brother, gave him\nto the policeman, he says while I was there \u2014 stopped me on the street, he said: \"I wanted to save\nyour brother.\" Gosh, I was so mad at him. I was so mad. I went to the office, I said, \"How\ncome you still have that man free?\" So he says, \"We have a new Bible. If somebody hits you on\none side, you give him the other side.\" I said, \"It's good that you didn't build a monument for the\nkillers here.\" But then I left, I didn't \u2014I stayed till I...",

My \u2014 Brno\nwas bombed out, the building. No one came back, and Galanta I had nothing there left. One boy\nwasn't home, so he came to see me in Budapest in 1942. And their parents were taking him\naway in '39, and then Miriam now asked for a paper from the agencies, from the Red Cross. So\nthey sent us that he was \u2014 he died of starvation in 1944 in Auschwitz. The only boy. Also \u2014 and\nafter the war, Trebisov, they didn't have Jewish life.

But it was against the law, I was in the\nDP after the war. DP, displaced persons camp in Germany. After the war in Budapest, I went\nfirst to Szeged where I could eat. After that I came home to see if anybody 1s alive. No one was\nalive. I went to Germany because I heard they have established displaced person camps, and\nwhoever wants to come to register to the United States. So I knew I have my sister here, I\nwanted to come to the United States. I registered in both ways, which was illegal. My sister sent\nme once money.

You cannot keep money.\" I said \u2014\nI had to lie, I'm sorry. I didn't, of course, I said that one dress would be $10. The one pair of\nshoes $10.

I was luckier, but they were\nsuffering more. Everybody had a name [ed comment: name=number (tattoo)], and who had a\nname on their body, it was a horror, unbelievable. Shiver when you see tt.\n40 four (Yiddish)",
        "A: Yeah. I was surprised, yes. I didn't expect that bad. Walking naked in the woods, walking\nnaked \u2014 just to punish them, not to give food, not to have water to drink, not to eat. One \u2014 my,\nmy \u2014I can\u2019t even \u2014 my, my niece, my cousin, she stole a little potato. How can you blame a\nlittle 17 year old beautiful girl, she steals? But she stole maybe somebody else's life. That little\npotato was somebody else's life. The others, the cousin, I heard that cousin's cousin, somebody\nin the family; she washed herself with the water. She could save a people's life with that water.\nConditions unbelievable. I never thought so. And tortured them on the street \u2014 and nude \u2014 and\nhit them and kicked them, pulled them.

        "A: To the end, I don't remember. If it was, I don't remember.",
        "A: Ghetto? No, no, I didn't hear anything. Only after the war when the concentration camp came\nback. You know, when everybody \u2014 my cousin who had that soap, piece of soap in her hands, it\nis earth shaking to me. They said lamps and soaps she carries with her. And she had numbers,\nand her brother was 60 pounds when he came out from the camp \u2014 Dachau \u2014 not Dachau. From\nthat horrible camp there which was the worst\u2014",
        "A: Auschwitz and then one more. Well, anyway, he had his share. Stories \u2014 it's no food, walking in\nthe rain, walking in outside nude just to suffer. Just to make them suffer.",
        "A: Well, you see, I was very lucky. When I \u2014 in the DP camp as \u2014 DP camp, you had opportunities,\nif you were looking for. You could have courses, Hebrew and dressmakers, and any profession\nyou wanted to pick. You could get educated. If you want to leave the DP in the free world, you\ncould get prepared in that place if you didn't have any profession. Like my little cousin who\nlived with me, she was gorgeous and 17. So I told her to go and study Hebrew; she did. I told\n\u201c1 In a later conversation interviewee clarifies that it was Matyas Rakosi she\nmeant to refer to here.\nher to go to, I was like a mother to her, go to make \u2014 learn dressmaking. She made, she went.\nSo when she came to the United States after years, lucky, she studied in that dressmaker design\nschool, and she became a very good dressmaker. So you could make yourself anything you\nwanted to in that camp, if you wanted to. But I didn't feel like I wanted \u2014 life was very, very\nlimited and simple. But you had friends it was such a tight together. You know, like you're my\nbrother, you're my sister. You didn't feel like strange person there, 1t was one whole big family.\nIf you see a man, you didn't look at him like a man. But you looked and, \u201cOh, my gosh, thank\nGod he's here. That's my brother.\u201d If you didn't have any \u2014 you know if you didn't feel like a\nman. But it was all \u2014 or a sister or anybody, you had such a unity. And life was very, very\nsimple, and those people really didn't have too much strength to do anything more \u2014 they went to\neat. You went to lunch, get the dinner that little rations, what they got. In the morning,\nbreakfast, a little cereal, tiny milk, and that was it. You were hungry constantly even with the\nrations you got, you got there. But many people managed some way to make money. Some way\nthat they wouldn't have to be hungry. But from that rations, you had to be hungry. You didn't\nhave to starve to death, but it wasn't enough. And then the clothing, you could get free. So you\ndidn't have any worries how you get a dress, and rooms were free, of course. One room we were\nfour people in. My cousin and me and her brother and a little strange boy. It was nothing\nunusual to have a strange man in that room, or Nazis or with numbers or \u2014 I mean survivors. It\nwas nothing unusual. It was just accepted thing that girl \u2014 not scared \u2014 man, no man wasn't such\nthing in that time. She was Orthodox, my cousin. She is still, and it wasn't a difference. Not\nsupposed to be in the same room according to the \u2014 you know, regulations, Jewish. But was no\ndifference, and courses, they emphasized Hebrew courses very much.",
        "A: In Munchen, out of the camp. I didn't like that camp life.",
        "A: Registered. I had to wait to come to the United States, I had to be registered there. I couldn't\u2014",
        "A: No, I traveled a lot, you see. So by traveling, I took a room in Munchen. It wasn't legal maybe,\nbut I did it. My sister send me packages and once \u2014 before I say that, 1t was almost in the...",
        "A: Free. Fantastic. But 1t was such hopelessness there. There was no place, was no solution for it.\nOnly one solution was offered, that place to immigrate. That was the hope, the best place in the\nworld. But three-quarters of those people there, no one wanted to stay there; they wanted to go\nout from the country. That was good. But it was very depressing waiting three years. And\ntomorrow, they promise you tomorrow the quota, and you come tomorrow and a year later. Six\nmonths later, three months later, and it was always one year, two years, three years. For me it\nwas 'til 1947. It wasn't right. I didn't have in the camp registered DP camp. My friends went to\na city close by, a bigger city. Ginzburg or Ulm. And I went to say good-bye to them. I didn't\nhave my identification card \u2014 identification on me from the DP camp already, American DP\ncamp. They picked me up in that, in that truck, three soldiers. Here, you go in that truck. Took\nme to jail. Can you imagine how strict that was before? American soldiers did it to me; put me\nwith the prostitutes in Ulm in the jail. Next day, I said, \"How could you do that to me? Not\nenough I have to be with prostitutes after the war?\" I should \u2014 it was a court, the court made a,\nyou know, case out of it. And $50 fine, I said, \"Well, where would I get $50?\" $50 is like\n$50,000 to a person who doesn't have five cents. I said, \"I can't give you $50. I don't have\nmoney.\" So one man from the group said, \"I bail you out.\" In the, in the, in the jail, they gave\nyou a glass of grass with water, that was the soup. On the floor, you could sleep. Now, the\nAmericans, all right?",
        "A: Well, the Communists liberated, so they took over Budapest, of course, the country. And there\nwere soldiers, Americans \u2014 Russian soldiers, and to me they were great. I was hungry. There\nwas nothing to eat, no place to shop. And I went \u2014 I knew that they have a big truck with bread.\nI said, \"I am hungry. Give me chleba*\u2019.\" I speak Slavic, you know, I speak Slovakian. I said,\n\"Davai chleba. Give me bread.\" They didn't ask me who I am. I said, \"I am freezing in my\nroom. I need wood.\" He went to the wood with \u2014 where is wood, you know, forest. Cut the\nwood off \u2014 cut the tree off, and carried it with other soldiers to my house. Cut it to pieces, I was\nwarm. That\u2019s Comm\u2014 American \u2014 the Russian soldiers. But they were always drunk. They\nsung on the street, doctor or a peasant, equally the same. They were drunk and drunk and drunk.\nAnd then \u201cYou have a watch? Davai chasi.\u201d\u201d Chasi is a watch. They said, \"Give me the watch.\nDavai chasi.\" They put it here on elbow from top till down, like kids; they never had a watch in\nRussia. So suddenly, \u201cdavai chasi,\u201d that means give me your watch. They didn't wait, they just\ngrabbed and took it off of your hands and put them on. And then they threw them away like\nkids; that was funny to me, very funny \u2014 how they had them. But they didn't want to go back.\nThey said, \"Why should I go back to my country? I don't have a family there left. They are all\nbombed out. I'm not going back.\" But there came the order three times, they have to go back\notherwise they are in Siberia. And one man who is 10 years 1n prison, Miklos that was his name.\nForgot his name, Miklos*\u2019. Maybe it will come back to me. He was from the democratic regime\nin Hungary, put to jail because he was a Communist for 10 years. And then he became in\ncharge, so what did he do? He killed people, and everybody could see hanging on the street, in\nthe big street in Budapest \u2014 on Andrassy ut. Hanging people, you pass by, you didn't think\nanything of it. You took everything such in stride, I don't know. You didn't think anything after\nthe war that man is hanging. You saw so many on the mountains piled up, so you just pass and\ndidn't think anything of it. And then maybe you expected that he was 10 years suffering in jail,\nthat he wouldn't be so sympathetic to the people. It was \u2014 after the war was still misery. No\n42 bread (Russian)\n45 Matyas Rakosi\nfood, even for everyone. Not only for the Jewish people now \u2014 equally. Couldn't get anything in\nthe stores. They were all empty. No food, what I mean just to survive. Sometimes the water\nwas pumped out. You had to travel miles to get a little water, probably.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. I could hardly wait to come over. And when I came on the\nboat...",
        "A: Seven. From Bremen, Germany. I thought I am dreaming, God, I was so happy. That breakfast,\nI never thought that one minute before we had such a horrible life, and here I am such a luxury.\nThis was like a dream, like a dream come true. You couldn't describe that feeling, you couldn't.\nJust the food by itself, you didn't concentrate on anything else. Just to be free and to have food.\nYou can walk; you can talk whatever you want to. That was just the most amazing thing to me.\nNo starving anymore. That was a luxury life. Everybody got sick, but I didn't so I was \u2014 on the\nboat. The boat was an army boat, the Ernie Pyle and water came in the boat. So we had to\nchange the direction. It took us three weeks to come United States. Wouldn't last that long if not\nwater in that boat. You know, accident. It was a dream.",
        "A: I traveled with many friends. I can't remember, but we all went apart. After the war, we had a\nlittle bit of contact from beginning. One is in Frankfurt. Yesterday, I just saw her picture. I\nforgot her name. I don't have any contact with them any longer, but some came to \u2014 in Frankfurt,\nI met them, and then United States, I didn't know where they went.",
        "A: Yeah. A dream. A dream of dreams. My sister came, my brother was and a few friends, her\nfriends came to wait for me. And a bouquet of flowers, my brother. Couldn't breathe, I cried. I\njust cried. Couldn't believe it. Very emotional. The, the \u2014 that Statue of Liberty. Yeah, that was\nsomething to see it. I can't describe, even now it brings tears to my eyes. It was just gorgeous, it\nwas like heaven on earth. Kiss everyone \u2014 I couldn't stand anybody complained in the United\nStates. But even now I'm feeling there is no way to complain to me it is heaven even now. It's\nunbelievable. One minute away \u2014 I'm thinking one minute away. That was great, and I had a\ngreat sister and a great brother supported me in every way. Give me money right away, give me\nfive \u2014 $300, which was a fortune for a person who has nothing. And he said, \"You be\nindependent. I want you to be independent.\" But three weeks later, I went to work. I went to\nwork as a milliner, and I got a stitch infection. My body wasn't \u2014 just one stitch, with a needle. I\nhad to stay off because my hands were infected. But luckily, I got along with people very well. I\nmade very, very nice friends in New York and I am still friends with them. One died, and one\njust came to see me, who was in Europe, who was working for Rabbi Bernstein**. She was his\nsecretary, so I just met her last week. So I was lucky to have met someone. It's still a dream.",
        "A: In New York? It was everything, what you wanted to have. I went to lectures each time to Segal\n(ph) at synagogue. They had dances there every week. I went there. One man was there in that\ntime, he said he's a medical doctor. He said he want to marry me the next day. Not leaving\nanymore. I dream, it was everything from the first minute I came to this country, it was a dream\nin every way. Yes, culture I cultivated. I went to those lectures, Segal (ph) and then dances and\nthen the Jewish shows, free tickets for refugees. And Skulnik** for second [ed comment: Second\nAvenue- Yiddish theater] in New York, and the theaters I like all the time to go, yeah.",
        "A: No. After the war, gosh, nothing was difficult. Nothing. I got a job night away. I didn't want a\njob. I, 1\u2014 when I got the stitches, I got paid for it. I could be independent. If I make a dollar, I\nstill have the dollar to put away. I could still eat, not to be hungry and to be independent. Fifty\ncents frankfurters. I was so proud it's mine.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I tell you, I didn't want to talk about it. I didn't even talk to my children for years. I didn't want\nto bring it up. I didn't want to talk about it. Somebody brought Holocaust up, I just said, \"Sorry,\nI can't participate in that subject. I'm not ready for it. I don't want to talk about it.\" I couldn't\nbring myself together, even to my kids, to talk about it.",
        "A: Painful, very painful.",
        "A: Yeah. But also in that one episode it was that jealousy was big, because I was good in my field.\nI can \u2014 I was already a milliner at home for many years, and I went to Bratislava and Budapest\n44 Rabbi Philip Sidney Bernstein, Jewish advisor to United States Army in\nEurope from 1945 to 1947, also served on Jewish Welfare Board. Encyclopaedia\nJudaica, s.v. \u201cBernstein, Philip Sidney.\u201d\n49 Menasha Skulnik, American comedian, popular star of New York\u2019s Second\nAvenue Yiddish theaters. Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. \u201cSkulnik, Menasha.\u201d\none of the best salons. And I was watching what others do, I observed because I had to. I had to\ncompete with everybody. So I was looking how to make the most, and that was jealousy many\ntimes. One woman said, \"Yesterday a woman was here. She was much worse than you are, and\nthey hired her.\" But they let me go because the forelady didn't want me. And then in Budapest\nwhere I was working one time, I made a hat, designed all by myself. And that design hat went\nall over the country, had orders. And the woman said, \"Cut off a certain part of the head. It\nshould be better.\" I said, \"Don't cut if off. It's perfect as it is.\" \"No, you do it.\" So then the\nforelady comes in, and she said, \"Who killed that hat?\" And she told it's me. She didn't took it\non herself because the forelady told me to correct it. I wanted to leave the store. That was the\nEuropean. But there was jealousy in jobs. As a foreigner, that what I noticed. But I work at\nmany places, they were sympathetic with me. They want me to come Saturday to work if I want\nmoney, even it's not right but I should come. Many places I was lucky. I didn't notice any anti-\nSemitism while I was working. I made friends while I was working, good friends. I didn't have\nthat problem with them, just the jealousy was more a problem. What I noticed. They were\nscared of it. If met somebody? Yes, I did.",
        "A: When I came in, I was engaged. When I came to this country in 1947. Yeah, I met somebody in\nGermany. I have his picture here. And I came out and he want me to come back after two years.\nI said, \"Oh, no way. I changed and you changed. Two years, it's too much. You lived through; I\nlived through. I'm not going back to misery again. I don't want to go on rations.\" And so then\nhe married and I married, too. Oh, my brother lived in Washington, had a little store. And I\nlived in New York, so I came to visit him. And I was helping him like a European sister,\ncleaning his jewelry and washing his floor, washing his windows. Like at home. And aman\ncame in, three customers, and they said if I am single, they have a man for me. And I was\ntalking on the telephone, he's a musician, a friend from Europe, from Brno where my sister was.\nAnd he belonged to my sister's congregation. When he was 13, he already played violin, he's a\nviolinist. And I was talking to him, I was always very happy to talk to him. So anyway, he said\nthey have a man for me, and I said, \"Okay, so let me meet him.\" To me \u2014 my brother had a date\nwith a girl, I said, \"I'm not going with you on your date. I need a man for myself.\" Just not to be\nwith him, not to spoil his date. So then my husband I met in his cousin's place, 1n his brother-in-\nlaw's. My husband didn't want to come to my brother's place, but he said he was going to his\nbrother\u2019s \u2014 brother-in-law's brother liquor store in Washington. I said, \"Okay, he's not coming\nhere. Iam going there.\" So my husband came, then he took me to his brother \u2014 he's a lawyer in\nFairfax, he was. Now, he's old and sick. Burstein, Robert Burstein. And they thought I would\nbe good for him, you know, for his brother. So in five days, he wanted to marry me. He was a\nvery set man, he always knew what he wants to do \u2014 what want to do. And I felt like he's very\nreliable and character is great, and I don't meet a man every day like that. So it took me five\nmonths to make up my mind. In January '51, we got married. He was an economist and a rabbi,\nhe missed but maybe a year or something. Very educated. A good person like human being, so\nthat was my good luck.",
        "A: [have two girls. One is Miriam and the other is Susan. She's married 10 years, maybe more, to\na very, very nice Catholic lawyer \u2014 very nice man.

        "A: In the war?",
        "A: I tell you it was just such an automatic thing to do; that man needs papers, and my life was so\nmiserable if I lose it, I have not too much to risk. Not too much to risk. If they catch me today \u2014\nthere's nothing safe. Was no \u2014I couldn't say I'm sitting in that chair and I'm safe. That chair\nwasn't safe for me. Nothing was safe. So I said if I have to do something with my life, that man\nwill be dead. He needs my help. And it was like such an automatic thing, I didn't think I am in\ndanger. I knew what I am going to do. I didn't think I am crazy, I knew exactly if I go there, it\nwill be danger. And, as I said, I didn't think, just that I have to do it. I didn't even think it's such\na great glory to me in that time to do it.",
        "A: Thad a very difficult life, youth. My father died when I was only 13 years old, and I didn't know\nmy father till nine years old. He was captured in Sarajevo, now in Serbia. I read his card, \"Send\nme money, send me food,\u201d sent to my mother, when he sent from there.",
        "A: Yeah. World War I. I didn't know him. And when he came back after \u2014 he was captured in that\nSarajevo, and when he came back, I was nine years old, developed. Suddenly, you have a father.\nI didn't like that. He had a snuff box, Orthodox, you know, and I didn't like that smell. And then\nhe was teaching me how to pray Hebrew, and one day he cut \u2014 he tied me to the table, I should\nstudy; I didn't want to study. But that was punish your kids, in the name of God, you know, that\nthey should listen to you. I didn't like it. I was already not ready for that kind of treatment, you\nknow, I didn't like it. And then German, he taught me. And he played chess, he taught me. He\nmade chess and he played chess. He was a gabbai*\u00ae in the synagogue. You know, like a\npresident in the synagogue. And he was a respectable man because the honor, the name, if you\nare a rabbi's daughter, he is a rabbi's \u2014 a kvittel [ed comment: a kivttel- rabbi\u2019s family] of rabbis.\nHe came from that Loew, that big, golem family who made the golem. Kind of he related that he\ncomes from that family. Loew, in Prague, Rabbi Loew. And he created that golem? and he\ncame from that big, big family. So they got respect \u2014 and he was a teacher before he \u2014 when he\ngot married at 19 years old. And my mother, I remember, she used to wash dead people. She\nsaid that's the biggest mitzvah, biggest mitzvah in the world what you can do in your life.\nBecause they cannot repay you anymore. You do it for the sake of doing good. And she was a\nvery high \u2014 very, very high ethics, she had. Moral ethics. She always stressed money 1s \u2014 name\n46 sexton (Hebrew)\nis more worth it than money, all the time. Like gold, you know, that kind of Talmud. And once\nshe says she studied the book, and once she told me I was amazed; I was already a woman. And\nshe says that birds communicate. And I said, \"Where did you got it from?\" She said it is already\nin the Talmud book interpretation. And she studied a lot, and she took every day a newspaper\nand shared it with the neighbor, who had no money to buy it alone. But she had to have the\npaper. And hardworking existence, I don't think so she lived. Eight children. Eight children, no\nfather, but everybody when they grow up, congratulated my mother, how great the kids are. She\ndidn't do anything for them. One was a maid in a rich place, \u2014 an aunt\u2019s place \u2014 and another was\na maid in arich place. My uncle came to pick me up so I can study hats in his place. His\ndaughter was a millinery. I became a millinery. But they didn't register me for a year, sooner so\nI should work free. For three years, you had to pay if you study any trade. And after three years,\nyou get paid. So they didn't register \u2014 I worked four years, instead of three years. But it was a\ngood experience for me, they had a very disciplined, happy life, and I didn't have it at home. So\nthen my father died, and I cried day and night when I was young. I slept on the floor. I was\nhomesick when I went to that place, and sit on one place for 12 hours. Somebody died in the\ncommunity, I had to make the hat with her overnight. I was 13. I had to be up the whole night,\nmake that hat. It would be against the law if it's in this country, but I did it. And you had\nbreakfast, a cup of coffee and a slice of bread. Lunch, a good lunch, but I could have three\nlunches, I was so hungry. And then you have 7 o'clock dinner: a slice of bread with a cup of\ncoffee. There now, I was hungry. That wasn't \u2014 but I always prayed to God he should make me\nnot only independent, I shouldn't need anyone. I should have my bread and water. That's all I\nwant, I don't want more. Just I should be my bread and my cup of water. I shouldn't need any\ncharity that was my desire all the time my life to...",
        "A: Very young, 13 when I was in my aunt's place. I said \u201cthat's enough for me. Should be my\nbread, don't give me anything.\u201d I don't want anything. And my mother was strong. She was\nvery proud, she didn't take charity. She wouldn't take charity. When the Germans, Nazis, the\nCzech Nazis came in, the Hlinkova Garda, one very rich man wanted to give my brother suits.\nHe didn't need them because they take them away. They take away \u2014 the Nazis took away, if\nyou had one dress, two dresses, took away one. The whole house cleared it out. You know that\nprocedure. And my mother didn't want it.

Then I decided Allgemeine Juedische Organisation, Allgemeine\nJuedische Organisation*\u2019, that means United Jewish Organization, and I thought people shouldn't\nfight.

I think that was my mother's doing. And one thing she always said I\nhave to have it good in life, because I'm a good person. That kind of carried me; that she had\nfaith that I want \u2014 she always said, \"Don't bring me shame on my head.\" She said it to my\nbrother, and the stories all over, I think she had something to do with that. Yeah, I was, I went to\nsynagogue almost every time I could. Shabbos, even then, and that was danger. And, as I said,\nit's on Yom Kippur when they came to ask me money. I said, \"I need money.\" They wouldn't\nbelieve me because my manicured hands and my clean dress I had one dress. They stole my\ndresses. I washed out the belt, I washed out the collar, and I went to work. But water was very\nrationed. You were not home at 4 o'clock, you don't have water. If you have one dress and it's\nnot clean, you cannot go to work.\n47 Allgemeine Juedische Kolonisations Organization, a short-lived general\nZionist organization started in 1908 by Alfred Nossig.

        "A: Well, yes. My friend, desperate, she said she's in love with a married man who supports her.\nAnd she thinks that that married man that married man's wife is the prostitute, not she. She's not\nthe prostitute because she is living with a man she doesn't care for, and he\u2019s living, ergo, she is\nthe one who is entitled. And she says that she has a man for me. It was nothing unusual,\nnothing. Such a \u2014 sometimes it was a blessing who could do it. I didn't have shoes. Maybe that\nsaved me \u2014 I was embarrassed I didn't have shoes. But that was, yes, 1t was many times. And\nthen the $500 Peng6 [ed comment: Pengo is Hungarian currency] somebody offered, my friend\ntold me if I go with him. No, I couldn't follow it.

        "A: Oh, yes. Every day. You can't get away from it. I get very mad if they say, \"Don't forget it.\" If\nthey \u2014 they have a lecture, Senior Citizen Survivor Center, \"Don't forget.\" What are you talking\nabout? It's the whole family, not a person. \"Don't forget.\" There hasn't been a day what you\nwouldn't remember every one. Even my husband has been dead eight years, I remember him\nevery day. And now, the whole family, a nice family. I would have a great family. I have no\none from my family.

        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: It's hard to say, because I keep blessing my God. That he gave me such a long life and such a\nhappy life here in this country. I married a wonderful man, couldn't get a better person. A better\ncharacter, you couldn't get. He was a rabbi and an economist, he was in the government.\nBesides this, he was gentle human being, a mensch**. So I had two girls; the other is Susan, she\nis married three years \u2014 I mean, with three boys.",
        "A: Three grandchildren, and Miriam. So I had a full, full life, and I blessed to God that he gave me\nthat in this country. And what I think I can't forget the past, and the past goes with me always,\nbut I hope that no one in the world has to have that experience, no one \u2014 what I had. And that I\nam here today, I think it's not me. I think some, like a statue, I don't think so it's me. Why would\nI go to that whole hell for the people I don't even know? I didn't regret it. I didn't regret it, but I\njust hope \u2014 and what happened, my answer, is to \u2014 is it, needs from the childhood, an education\nagainst the hatred. One letter I got from Mrs. Maurer*? when the story came out in the\nnewspapers that people in leadership can see, should see what hatred can do. That hatred, child\nis innocent.

        "A: Well, the fear is that you can't forget, and it haunts you. It haunts you. Wherever you go you are\nhearing the lecture I am in Hadassah\u00b0\u2019.

Why I did tt, I\nhave no answer for it. I really don't know why I did it. I just had something in me said you have\nto do it and no question.
