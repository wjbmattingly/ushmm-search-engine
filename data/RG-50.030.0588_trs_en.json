And\nafter my grandmother died--I really didn't know myone grandfather, I knew. He was my\nmother's father, but the others I never knew. They moved to--not too far away to another\nlittle bigger place called Adelsheim.",

        "Q: No, Katherine, because Katherine is a Catholic name.",

        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And a lot of them were called Limburger, and I always thought they were all related.\nThey were not all related. They came from a place in Poland called Limburg.",

        "A: But they were not all related.",
        "Q: How interesting. How interesting. So your mother's family actually eventuallyway\nback, could have come from Poland? To Rexingen?",
        "A: You know, I was--I was 12 when I left; and you know, bringing up children in\nGermany was quite different from these days. You didn't tell them your history. You\nwere just there, and you just did things.",
        "Q: Were you the oldest? The youngest?",
        "A: Yeah. I was the oldest of five.",
        "Q: You were the oldest of five. Who was born after you?",

        "Q: Okay. And in a second she's going to put--put the machine on you again. (Unrelated\nconversation) So this 1s a picture of Edith taken in what year?",
        "A: I don't know when that was taken. Edith died in '98, and after her, Ruth was born. And\nthen Herman was born in--she was born in '30; Herman was born in '33, but I don't have a\npicture of him right away. And then Esther. Where's Easter? She should be on here. See\nthis man? Somehow or other I think it devastated the German economy when all these\nJews left. And they're now doing a history. I'm sure you're aware of that. There used to be\na man--I had to write to Germany for birth certificate or something to this little place\ncalled Korb.",
        "Q: So the place your were born in?",
        "A: Where I was born. And there was a man there who knew my father by the name of\n(?Weterhour?) who's doing a history of the Jews that lived in that area. The problem was\n(?Weterhour?)--my German is gone. It's gone. And he couldn't talk English; so all the\nletters were in German which I had to have translated, and I think in '90, my son--where's\nmy son--here. Had to go the France, and he says, \"You know, Mom, I'd like to go to\nAdelsheim because that's where we lived,\" and I wrote to (?Weterhour?) And low and\nbehold, I got a letter back in English. (?Weterhour?) was getting too old to take care of",
        "Q: So that's the last name of the man?",
        "A: That's the last name of the man. This man was taken and his English is wonderful. So\nAllen went to Germany and met him, and he persuaded us go to.",
        "Q: To visit?",
        "A: There's another little village called Sennfeld, which is near Adelsheim where the\nsynagogue was still standing. And he--they opened it as a museum. I think upstairs are\noldfashioned farm utensils, and down stairs is all Jewish. So we've been there.\n(Background noise)",
        "Q: But mostly we don't--",
        "A: Well, out of five, this waswe really very close. These are my nieces. I got eight nieces,\none nephew, and one son. So there are ten cousins.",
        "Q: So you were four girls and one boy?",
        "A: Right.",

        "Q: Were there any other languages they were spoken at home? Did you feel yourself\nGerman, more German than Jewish, or equally German as Jewish?",
        "A: I never gave it a thought. I knew I was German, and I knew I was Jewish.",
        "Q: And it was normal?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Can you let me a little bit about what life was like. It wasn't Adelsheim that you have\nthe most memories. What are your earliest memories?",
        "A: Because I was a year old when they moved from Korb to Adelsheim.",
        "Q: Do you have some earliest memories you could share?",
        "A: My father was very strict. I think he was boss, and there were--because of his one leg-\n-we lived on a hill. We were never allowed to go bicycle riding. We were never allowed\nto go to snow--sledding because he as afraid that if we needed help, he couldn't--",
        "Q: He couldn't be there to do it?",
        "A: He couldn't be there to do it. But we did. We did.",
        "Q: How can you keep kids from doing stuff like that?",
        "A: I know. And when we were out playing, and he wanted us to come home, he would\nstand in the front of the steps of our house and whistle. Everybody in that little\nAdelsheim knew that whistle so.",
        "Q: That was Mr. Rosenfeld's whistle?",
        "A: I don't know what else. I think we had very normal childhood.",
        "Q: What was your mother like? Was she somebody who stayed at home and took care of\nthe house, or did she work?",
        "A: Well, not really because when the weather was bad, she had to go with him to do\nwhatever earned him a living because of his--he couldn't walk on ice. He couldn't walk\non snow. SO...",
        "Q: So she was part of his business?",
        "A: I guess so, yeah. I guess so.",
        "Q: And how did he lose his leg?",
        "A: In the war.",
        "Q: But as a soldier?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: He was in the front?",
        "A: Yeah. And, you know, when you're growing up, you accept things and you don't look\nat ages and somebody who's maybe fourfoot tall if you're that big, their tall. But he was\nonly a teenager. When I| think back of when he lost his leg, he was only a teenager when\nhe lost his leg.",
        "Q: And so he was also very young when he became a father because that was",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: In the 20s. Did he talk about World War I with the kids? Did he tell stories?",
        "A: No. I just remember him saying, when he came home from the war, he went on a\nmotorcycle, and he had a bad experience. I don't know what happened, but I remember he\nsaid, \"Don't ever go on a motorcycle.\"",
        "Q: So he was fearful for his kids?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Friday nights he would inspect our hair for lice, our nails, our toenails. I\nthink German men--I don't know about only Jewish men. I don't know anything about\nany other men--were very bossy. Very, you know, weren't they? So that I remember, and\nI remember when he came homebefore he went to the war, he had apprentice as a baker.\nWell, when he came home and didn't have a leg, he couldn't continue baking, but he used\nto make (?Holis?) And he used to make tortes. He used to cook. He used to bake.",
        "Q: Well, that's also unusual for a man in--1n a place where there was very distinct roles\nthat were assigned to who does what.",
        "A: I guess, yeah. I suppose. You know, when you",
        "Q: You don't think of things like that when you're a kid?",
        "A: Not really. Not really.",
        "Q: What was your mom like?",
        "A: She was a doll. You know, but it's over 70 years. It's hard. At this point you don't\nknow what you imagine or what was real. It's very hard.",
        "Q: Does that mean you don't have memories of her?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Oh yeah.",
        "Q: And so do you--can you say that there are some memories you know are real or\ndistinct?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I remember. I remember cleaning for (?pay self?) on the ceiling to theto the\nattic to the basement. And, you know, when you have five kids, you're very busy.",
        "Q: Were you kind of in charge of some of the other kids, being the oldest?",
        "A: I remember diapering Esther, and I remember after three girls when Herman was born,\nwhen he woke us up when he was born, that was a big thing. That was a big thing.",
        "Q: What kind of education level did your parents have?",
        "A: I don't remember. I don't really know. I don't really know.",
        "Q: Did you father attend Gimnazium or--",
        "A: I don't think so. He was in the army as a teenager, and then he apprenticed--honestly I\ndon't know.",
        "Q: So--",
        "A: Neither one of them was a professional.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don't know how many professionals there were in those days in little rural--",
        "Q: Communities?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did you have any--in Adelsheim, you say there was enough Jews to make a Minyan?",
        "A: Yeah, we had a Shull.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Grade school.",

        "Q: Tell me in what way? In what way did this affect you? In what way, you know, you\nwere children. You were--in 1933, when he came to power, how old were you, eight?",
        "A: Yeah. And how many 8yearolds remember what happened, especially if 1t was a bad\nthing that happened, you know?",

My--my\nmother's family, the sisters, there were only two _. They were very close, and there\nwas a Jewish school in Heilbronn. I don't know whatwhen we weren't allowed to go to\nthe school anymore in Adelsheim.",
        "Q: So it was an overall public school for everybody.",
        "A: Oh yeah. It was a grade school for everybody. There was a Jewish school in\nHeilbronn, which--where we had an aunt. So me Esther--me, Edith, and Esther, and Ruth\nwere sent to Heilbronn to go to the Jewish school. And we were there for a while. I don't\nknow how long we were there, but I remember one day we went on a field trip to\nsomewhere where we had another aunt. And when we came back, we were told we\ncouldn't go to school anymore. That same day. So we wenthad to go home, but we had to\ngo the school and we had--my mother had two sisters in Aachen. Have you ever heard of\nAachen?",

We had to walk so school, and one day we\nwalked to schoolthe school was near the synagogue in Aachen, that was Kristallnacht.\nWe were walking to school, and we had to pass the synagogue, and were all--we couldn't\nbelieve it, and somebody told us go home. So we went home. We didn't go to school.",
        "Q: What did you see at the synagogue?",

        "A: So we went back to my aunt's. I don't know anything about their lives really, but I do\nremember that sometimes in the evening there were people there, and they were not there\nin the morning. So I think my aunts must have smuggled them across the border because\nit was right there.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: Belgium.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: And we didn't know anything about this, but their Kindertransport had been formed,\nand my aunts--I don't know who made arrangements for us to come to England on the\nKindertransport.",
        "Q: We'll come to that, but first I still have a few questions. They may sound almost like\nside questions, but they're curious for me. When you would go from Adelsheim to first\nHeilbronn. I think it was the first one?",
        "A: Heilbronn.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don't remember.",
        "Q: And when you were still in the school where you were together with other non Jewish\nchildren, did you feel anything different in the air?",
        "A: I might have, but I don't remember. I do remember when Iwhen we were in\nAdelsheim, we had to say, \"Hail Hitler\" to the to the teachers, and I don't know why that\nstands in my mind, but I met a teacher, and I was carrying books, and I dropped the\nbooks and said, \"Hail Hitter.\" And he came over and he said, \"You don't have to do\nthat.\" I don't know why that stands, but I also don't know whether that's real or not real.",
        "Q: Why? Why would you say that?",
        "A: Because it happenedI don't know.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Did--was there talk at home about Hitler?",
        "A: I only remember at the elections my mother saying, \"He won.\" I remember that. She\nsaid, \"He won.\" And I guess that was Hitler who won. You know, the irony 1s we had a\nlot of relatives in America, and the whole family had affidavits to come to this country,\nbut there was this stupid quota, and that's whyI remember my father was the second\nyoungest. There was an uncle--younger. They were in business together in Adelsheim,\nand it was a question of whether my father should come, whether we should come, or his\nyounger brother, and I remember he said his younger brother because if he can't work\nanymore he always has his pension.",
        "Q: Your father does?",
        "A: Yeah. So my uncle came over, and we never made it] mean my parents never made it.",

        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit about what happened?",
        "A: You know what?",
        "Q: What?",
        "A: I don't remember a thing about it. I do not remember. I mean that's how we came--the\nthree of us came.",
        "Q: You were together?",
        "A: Me, Edith, and Ruth. My mother--my mother had a sister who went to England--to\nLondon in '33. And at that time she went to work for a Jewish family. They could only do\ndomestic work, but anyhow, by the time the Kindertransport, she'd been there six years\nand her--many friends; so she found us homes. We wereRuth was in a hostile, but Edith\nand I were always with private people. She had found homes for us.",
        "Q: So you don't remember saying goodbye to your parents?",

        "A: Right. With my aunts.",
        "Q: With your aunts. You never went back to Adelsheim?",
        "A: Huhuh. Now, my brother--Esther came out too. She was still in Adelsheim, and how\nshe got on Kindertransport--she did, I have no idea. I can't imagine that in that small\nAdelsheim therel think my aunts in Aachen made all those arrangements | think, but I\ndon't know.",

        "A: You know, I really don't remember. I do remember Nazis coming to investigate, to\nlook for arms in the house, and they turned the furniture upside down. Some things I\nremember, but that I really don't remember.",
        "Q: Do you remember any other kinds of exposure or confrontation toone of the questions\nI was getting to ask, but didn't get to before, 1s did you have any non Jewish German\nfriends? Did you have any contact",
        "A: I guess in Adelsheim, I don't know, but in Aachen--",
        "Q: Okay. But if it was in Adelsheim, do you have any memories of it? Other children\nthat you went to school with? Kids you played with?",
        "A: No, but when we went back and I met somebody I went to school with. But--she\nremembered me; I didn't remember her. But, you know, talking about what you\nremember, my brotherwhy my parents didn't have him go on the Kindertransport I have\nno idea, but he stayed with my parents.

He couldn't remember anything about the camp at all. If you wanted to, you\nknow, would remember a thing about it. And I guess people just drop unpleasant\nmemories. I don't know.",
        "Q: But you were then how old? You were 14 or 15 when--",

Mr. Pool was the chauffeur for the people that my aunt worked for. They\nwere Jewish, and I went there, and they were very typically English. I remember some\nthings. In fact, I remember the address where we lived.",
        "Q: Where were this?",
        "A: Number 10 Elm street in England--in London--an outskirt of London, and they had a\nmaid, and I spent a lot of time in the kitchen with the maid, and I think when she asked\nme something and didn't understand, she would show me. I think I had to credit her with\nlearning English. Of course, I was going to school, and I didn't do too well in school, I\nthink. They were never too happy with my grades.",
        "Q: So your aunt worked for a welltodo Jewish family?",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "Q: Did he understand that you didn't know?",
        "A: Oh yeah. He understood. He understood. Mrs. Pool was originally from Scotland; so\nwhen there was talk of war, there was talk of her evacuating to Scotland, and we were in\nthe train on September 3rd on our way--hadn't left London left to Scotland when war was\ndeclared.",

There were a motherin that household, there was a mother and a daughter\nand her husband, and the daughter and her--his really sponsored or whatever, but they\nboth worked . So the old lady was the only one at home taking care of Edith, and she was\na bitch. She thought she had a cheap maid. The Pools were very good to me.

I don't know how she knew Doctor\n(?Lobby Nickels?) but they had a maid who was German, and my aunt wasto tell you the\ntruth, I really don't know, but anyhow Ruth went to live with Doctor Lobby Nickles.

        "A: Yeah, before the war. I think they must have advertised it for people who wanted to\ntake--because they got 10,000 kids out.

Now this couple, Harrison, lived\nin Norwich, England, and Norwich, England, there were a lot of shoe factories and Harry\nHarrison worked in a factory that was owned by a Jew, and on the bulletin board that they\nneeded homes for--",

So\nshe wentmy aunt went to the station to see Esther, and Esther naturally walked towards\nher. I guess because she looked like my mother. I don't really know. But she went to the\nHarrison's, and the Harrison's were not Jewish. And they had one son, and you would\nthink--Allen was seven, I think, at the time. You would think he would be jealous of her.\nHe adores--to this day, he adores the ground she walks on. He's been over herecomes\nover here quite often.

        "Q: How--a couple of questions. Do you remember during the time when you were with\nthe Pools, did you think of what was going on with your parents? Do you remember\nbeing worried about what might be going on with them, or was that out of mind?",
        "A: You know, I never--no because we were always told that my parents would pick us up\nin England and we were coming to America. One day I got a telegram that said that is our\nnew address. I didn't really--you know, you really don't think of what could happen.\nWhen it happens, you're surprised, but then they were sent to Gurs, and I remember--oh\nat 16, I had tol had to go to work, and I did.

Only Adolf Schorsh of the these eight couples was able to get to the United\nStates in 1941 after his wife died in the camp.

        "A: That's my grandson.",
        "Q: Uhhuh.",
        "A: This is Allen. This is my son and his wife and their two children, and this is my\ndaughter's family. I don't think I have a picture of Julie. That's her, but--you know, at\ndifferentand this is my uncle's granddaughter.",
        "Q: Well, to me it sounds like an amazing achievement to keep a family together when so\nmuch was working against that happening.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Germany. How diddid you--do you and your siblings have different attitudes towards\nGermany and going back and returning?",
        "A: Well, I don't know about Edith. She was in Germany duringwhen she was in the army,\nshe was stationed in Germany, and she would tell meand she and somebody else went to\nAdelsheim.",
        "Q: At that time right after the war?",
        "A: When she was in the army.",
        "Q: Right. British Army.",
        "A: And someone on the street stopped her and said, \"Are you Adolf Rosenfeld's\ndaughter?\" So that's what happened. Let's see--but their attitude--I remember Esther said\nto me--who can't remember Germany. She was tooshe was thinking of going back, and\nshe said to me, \"Did you ever consider going back?\" As if they couldget lost in the sea--I\nsaid, \"No. I wouldn't.\" Well, she persuaded me to change my mind, but that was in, I\nthink '89 or something. I don't remember the date, but Morris got sick. So they wentwe\nmade agreements to go, but Morris got sick, and she and her husband went. So I guess\nthat was my attitude at that time. I don't ever care to go back, but when Allen went and\nmet Rinehart, I changed my mind. I went to the house where I was born, you know. Have\nyou ever lived in a small place?",
        "Q: No--",
        "A: Whenin a little town, you see a bunch of people, and you wonder why they're there.\nWe were standing in Korb. Rinehart had taken us there. In front of this, he says, \"This 1s\nthe house,\" and I have pictures of the house. That's where your father lived. So we were\nstanding there, and somebody from the house looked out, and they wondered while all\nthese people were standing there, and they said something. And it was the daughter who\nhadher parents had bought the house from my father, and she didn't live in it, but she\ncame there once a year to go to the cemetery of her parents, and that's when she stayed in\nthe house. So they just happened to be in the house and they asked us into the house. We\nwent into the house. Then we went back to Adelsheim. The German government had sold\nmy parent's house to somebody who we wentwere invited into that house, which had\nchanged greatly from when we lived in it.",
        "Q: So you had memories of how it had looked before?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you have anydid you have any photographs that--let's say relatives had gotten in\nthe United States that would have had your family before you went on the\nKindertransport that would have had pictures of the place of where your lived, of how\nyour parents looked, and things like that? We'll put it on tapethis photo that you're\nshowing me of your family before the Kindertransport, it must have been very recent\nbefore the Kindertransport.",
        "A: It was. I think so.",
        "Q: Because Esther's already--",
        "A: She looked a little--yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. And so when was the first time you wentdid you only go back the\nGermany once? Twice?",
        "A: Twice.",
        "Q: Twice?",
        "A: In '90, and in '95.",
        "Q: In '90 and in '95. But you mentioned earlier that there had been 1982?",
        "A: Yeah. That must have been wrong.",
        "Q: Okay. So it would have been one of those",
        "A: I have to ask Esther. I don't remember, but they had a memorial.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Forfor I think it was in 202.",
        "Q: In 202.",
        "A: 60 years 60 years.",
        "Q: 60 years.",
        "A: In 202.",
        "Q: Okay. So that would have meant three times that you've been back.",
        "A: Yeah. That was over the weekend.",
        "Q: Okay. So",
        "A: But it was a funny thing, you know, Rinehart had wrote us what they were doing, and\nhe wrote to me, andI said to Esther, \"You know, Esther, I think we ought to go.\" And she\njust went like that. About 2025 years ago, I got a letter from someone in Ireland. And\nsaid, \"Dear Mrs. Esenstad, I think we are related.\" Well, he's thethe man who wrote it is\na geologist, and he had been in a department in Ireland, and he went to Germany for a\ndig, and, you know, they keep all kinds of records. His mother was Jewish. His father\nwasn't, but when the war started--or beforehis Jewish grandmother and his Jewish aunt\ncame to live with them in England, and they got to England because they were antiNazi\nand they escaped. I think they met at the university somewhere in Germany and went to\nwork for the pope. And they both converted to Catholicism, but he said he was greatly\ninfluenced by his Jewish grandmother and aunt. So when he went back to Germany on a\ndig, he thought he would find out about his mother. I had written to Germany because I\nneeded copies of birth certificates, and that led him to Korb, and when he got to Korblater\nI said to him, you know, soandso 1s in Englandis in America. And he wrote. They gave\nhim my address, and he wrote to me, and he told me how we were related. He sent us\nfamily trees.",
        "Q: How were you related?",
        "A: His great grandhe'sPeter is now 60 something, I would think. He's much younger than\nwe are. His greatsomehow or another, his great, great grandfather and my great, great,\ngreatwhatever, very far. But, you know, we are--and we've met and he's been here a\ncouple of times.

        "Q: You never know. You never know. And you'rel think we're coming close to the end.",
        "A: Oh I--",
        "Q: I think we are, but I want to make sure there aren't any questions that I should have\nasked that I haven't asked.",
        "A: Well, I don't know. I wouldn't know.",
        "Q:I'm___ myself at the moment. Is there something that you would want your\nchildrenhave you talked about these things with your children? Did they ask? Were they\ncurious about it?",
        "A: You know, this person that I worked with in England, he came on my Kindertransport\ntoo. We never talked about it. The Kindertransportchildren didn't ask too many questions,\nbut they do know. They do know. We all have the most wonderful children so, right? But\nit'sKindertransport has only been talked about since '89, and that is because the 50th\nanniversary of the Kindertransport and the Leventhal--whatever her name 1s--half this\nreunion. Do you know about that?",
        "Q: No, I don't. I don't.",
        "A: She and her sister organized this reunion--5Oyear reunion in London. We didn't go.\nThey came from all over. They camel didn't thinkI don't think we thought they would\nhave such a turn out. But it's only been since that time that people have really talked\nabout the Kindertransport. We have an organization herea branch. There's a national in\nNew York. That's it. What else.",
        "Q: Youyou lost your parents, let's say at age 13 when you were sent to the\nKindertransport. You never saw them again after that?",
        "A: Never saw them again.",
        "Q: What do you think they bequeathed you, each of them as a personality? What do you\nthink thathow did they influence your life?",
        "A: I think family.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: I think so. They all were very close with their siblings, I think. And I remember all the\nletters from my mother--we should do this, and we should do that, and we shouldyou\nknow. She gave us orders because I don't think--I mean it's unimaginable, Auschwitz.\nThey would not have--",
        "Q: She didn't think that what's what would be--",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Go mad. So you have all the things you want to know?",
        "Q: Oh probably a lot more, but right now, unless there's something that you would want\nto add to what we've talked about.",
        "A: What's going to happen with this?",
        "Q: I'll tell you in a minute, but then at this point then I'll say thank you. Thank you for the\ninterview.",
        "A: I'm sorry we got so mixed up.",

It's fine. In the book, it's mentioned that on page 35--I'll say it first in\nGerman (speaking German).

Only Adolf Schorsh of the these eight couples was able to get to the United\nStates in 1941 after his wife died in the camp. And then (speaking German) that says that\nBerta Alexander--the heavily injured Adolf Rosenfeld and his wife Katalina were\ndeported in August '92 through Drancy to Auschwitz where they werewhere they died.\n\"Where they met death\" is actually the way it's explained.

And\nafter my grandmother died--I really didn't know myone grandfather, I knew. He was my\nmother's father, but the others I never knew. They moved to--not too far away to another\nlittle bigger place called Adelsheim.",
        "A: Adelsheim inand there were enough Jews to make a Minyan.",

        "A: Limburger?",
        "A: You know, I never--she never was called that. She was called Katty or Kater, and I\nassume--that's how I knew it, and I knew her as Mutter.",
        "A: So it was Kater or Katty.",
        "A: And she came from a place called Rexingen. My husband and I have been back to\nboth places. Rexingen had the largest percentage of Jews of any place, and 40 percent of\nthe population of Rexingen was Jewish.",

        "A: But they were not all related.",
        "A: You know, I was--I was 12 when I left; and you know, bringing up children in\nGermany was quite different from these days. You didn't tell them your history. You\nwere just there, and you just did things.",

And\nthen Herman was born in--she was born in '30; Herman was born in '33, but I don't have a\npicture of him right away. And then Esther. Where's Easter? She should be on here. See\nthis man? Somehow or other I think it devastated the German economy when all these\nJews left. And they're now doing a history. I'm sure you're aware of that. There used to be\na man--I had to write to Germany for birth certificate or something to this little place\ncalled Korb.",
        "A: Where I was born. And there was a man there who knew my father by the name of\n(?Weterhour?) who's doing a history of the Jews that lived in that area. The problem was\n(?Weterhour?)--my German is gone. It's gone. And he couldn't talk English; so all the\nletters were in German which I had to have translated, and I think in '90, my son--where's\nmy son--here. Had to go the France, and he says, \"You know, Mom, I'd like to go to\nAdelsheim because that's where we lived,\" and I wrote to (?Weterhour?) And low and\nbehold, I got a letter back in English. (?Weterhour?) was getting too old to take care of",
        "A: That's the last name of the man. This man was taken and his English is wonderful. So\nAllen went to Germany and met him, and he persuaded us go to.",
        "A: There's another little village called Sennfeld, which is near Adelsheim where the\nsynagogue was still standing. And he--they opened it as a museum. I think upstairs are\noldfashioned farm utensils, and down stairs is all Jewish. So we've been there.\n(Background noise)",

        "A: Because I was a year old when they moved from Korb to Adelsheim.",
        "A: My father was very strict. I think he was boss, and there were--because of his one leg-\n-we lived on a hill. We were never allowed to go bicycle riding. We were never allowed\nto go to snow--sledding because he as afraid that if we needed help, he couldn't--",
        "A: He couldn't be there to do it. But we did. We did.",
        "A: I know. And when we were out playing, and he wanted us to come home, he would\nstand in the front of the steps of our house and whistle. Everybody in that little\nAdelsheim knew that whistle so.",
        "A: I don't know what else. I think we had very normal childhood.",
        "A: Well, not really because when the weather was bad, she had to go with him to do\nwhatever earned him a living because of his--he couldn't walk on ice. He couldn't walk\non snow. SO...",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No. I just remember him saying, when he came home from the war, he went on a\nmotorcycle, and he had a bad experience. I don't know what happened, but I remember he\nsaid, \"Don't ever go on a motorcycle.\"",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Friday nights he would inspect our hair for lice, our nails, our toenails. I\nthink German men--I don't know about only Jewish men. I don't know anything about\nany other men--were very bossy. Very, you know, weren't they? So that I remember, and\nI remember when he came homebefore he went to the war, he had apprentice as a baker.\nWell, when he came home and didn't have a leg, he couldn't continue baking, but he used\nto make (?Holis?)

        "A: It was a--nowe had to be sent away. We went to--and I don't remember the year, but\nthere was a Jewish school in Heilbronn. And we had an aunt--excuse me. My--my\nmother's family, the sisters, there were only two _. They were very close, and there\nwas a Jewish school in Heilbronn. I don't know whatwhen we weren't allowed to go to\nthe school anymore in Adelsheim.",
        "A: Oh yeah. It was a grade school for everybody. There was a Jewish school in\nHeilbronn, which--where we had an aunt. So me Esther--me, Edith, and Esther, and Ruth\nwere sent to Heilbronn to go to the Jewish school. And we were there for a while. I don't\nknow how long we were there, but I remember one day we went on a field trip to\nsomewhere where we had another aunt. And when we came back, we were told we\ncouldn't go to school anymore. That same day. So we wenthad to go home, but we had to\ngo the school and we had--my mother had two sisters in Aachen. Have you ever heard of\nAachen?",

        "A: Oh, you've been there.",
        "A: So the three of us were sent to Aachen where there was a Jewish school. And we had\nto walk to school. They had an apartment. We had to walk so school, and one day we\nwalked to schoolthe school was near the synagogue in Aachen, that was Kristallnacht.\nWe were walking to school, and we had to pass the synagogue, and were all--we couldn't\nbelieve it, and somebody told us go home. So we went home. We didn't go to school.",

        "A: To 10th.",
        "A: So we went back to my aunt's. I don't know anything about their lives really, but I do\nremember that sometimes in the evening there were people there, and they were not there\nin the morning. So I think my aunts must have smuggled them across the border because\nit was right there.",
        "A: Belgium.",
        "A: And we didn't know anything about this, but their Kindertransport had been formed,\nand my aunts--I don't know who made arrangements for us to come to England on the\nKindertransport.",

        "A: I don't remember.",
        "A: I don't remember.",
        "A: I might have, but I don't remember. I do remember when Iwhen we were in\nAdelsheim, we had to say, \"Hail Hitler\" to the to the teachers, and I don't know why that\nstands in my mind, but I met a teacher, and I was carrying books, and I dropped the\nbooks and said, \"Hail Hitter.\" And he came over and he said, \"You don't have to do\nthat.\" I don't know why that stands, but I also don't know whether that's real or not real.",
        "A: Because it happenedI don't know.",
        "A: You know. I was--I was a youngster. I just remember that.",
        "A: I only remember at the elections my mother saying, \"He won.\" I remember that. She\nsaid, \"He won.\" And I guess that was Hitler who won. You know, the irony 1s we had a\nlot of relatives in America, and the whole family had affidavits to come to this country,\nbut there was this stupid quota, and that's whyI remember my father was the second\nyoungest. There was an uncle--younger. They were in business together in Adelsheim,\nand it was a question of whether my father should come, whether we should come, or his\nyounger brother, and I remember he said his younger brother because if he can't work\nanymore he always has his pension.",
        "A: Yeah. So my uncle came over, and we never made it] mean my parents never made it.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: You know what?",

        "A: Me, Edith, and Ruth. My mother--my mother had a sister who went to England--to\nLondon in '33. And at that time she went to work for a Jewish family. They could only do\ndomestic work, but anyhow, by the time the Kindertransport, she'd been there six years\nand her--many friends; so she found us homes. We wereRuth was in a hostile, but Edith\nand I were always with private people. She had found homes for us.",
        "A: I never saw them.",
        "A: Kristallnacht was in November, and we came in--in March.",
        "A: Right. With my aunts.",
        "A: Huhuh. Now, my brother--Esther came out too. She was still in Adelsheim, and how\nshe got on Kindertransport--she did, I have no idea. I can't imagine that in that small\nAdelsheim therel think my aunts in Aachen made all those arrangements | think, but I\ndon't know.",
        "A: November.",
        "A: You know, I really don't remember. I do remember Nazis coming to investigate, to\nlook for arms in the house, and they turned the furniture upside down. Some things I\nremember, but that I really don't remember.",
        "A: I guess in Adelsheim, I don't know, but in Aachen--",
        "A: No, but when we went back and I met somebody I went to school with. But--she\nremembered me; I didn't remember her. But, you know, talking about what you\nremember, my brotherwhy my parents didn't have him go on the Kindertransport I have\nno idea, but he stayed with my parents. And in 1940 when Hitler rounded up all theand\nsent them to Gurs, and Rivesaltes.",
        "A: That where my parents with my brother.",
        "A: So he was in camp.",
        "A: And he came over here. I don't know when he came over here. With a thousand\nchildren--you've heard of a thousand children? Came to my uncle and he spoke only\nFrench. He couldn't remember anything about the camp at all. If you wanted to, you\nknow, would remember a thing about it. And I guess people just drop unpleasant\nmemories. I don't know.",
        "A: When we came to England it was in March '39. In October, that year, I would have\nbeen 14.",
        "A: 14.",
        "A: Something like that.",
        "A: My aunt found me a home with a family named Pool. They were not Jewish, not\nJewish. They had a grown son. I mean they could've been my grandparents. They were an\nolder couple. Mr. Pool was the chauffeur for the people that my aunt worked for. They\nwere Jewish, and I went there, and they were very typically English. I remember some\nthings. In fact, I remember the address where we lived.",
        "A: Number 10 Elm street in England--in London--an outskirt of London, and they had a\nmaid, and I spent a lot of time in the kitchen with the maid, and I think when she asked\nme something and didn't understand, she would show me. I think I had to credit her with\nlearning English. Of course, I was going to school, and I didn't do too well in school, I\nthink. They were never too happy with my grades.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Noyeah. Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, because--when I didn't understand, she went and showed me.",
        "A: If she said, \"Get the sugar,\" didn't know what she was talking about. She would go\nand get it and--",
        "A: And they always ate in the dining room. This is the British. So one day he's sitting,\nand he's going like this (tapping sounds on the table) and I said, \"Shut up.\" Well, you\nwould imagine that was the call for the maid. And since then, I have never used shut up\non anything.",
        "A: Oh yeah. He understood. He understood. Mrs. Pool was originally from Scotland; so\nwhen there was talk of war, there was talk of her evacuating to Scotland, and we were in\nthe train on September 3rd on our way--hadn't left London left to Scotland when war was\ndeclared.",
        "A: Right. And I did know she suddenly got homesick; so I don't know how long we were\nthere, but it from a small--up north in Scotland. Up north of Aberdeen Scotland, a small\nvillage. And that, you know, they--first of all, I don't think they even seen a Jewa\nforeigner. So--but I went to school there, and it was a pretty good school.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I think so.",
        "A: Well, just me living with the Pools.",
        "A: Now, Edith lived with a Jewish family in London.",
        "A: No, no. But she lived in London, and Edith was the only onewell, Ruth did too with a\nJewish family. There were a motherin that household, there was a mother and a daughter\nand her husband, and the daughter and her--his really sponsored or whatever, but they\nboth worked . So the old lady was the only one at home taking care of Edith, and she was\na bitch. She thought she had a cheap maid. The Pools were very good to me. We went tol\nremember we went to the seaside once on vacationthey always went to the seaside, and\nwe took Edith. We took Edith. RuthRuth lived with a--went to a doctor, Jewish doctor.\nThey used to be doing the workdo you have a Bloomsbury House in England--in\nLondon?",
        "A: Bloomsbury House arranged to take care of children. They were very involved with\nthe Kindertransport.",
        "A: No, it was a volunteer--no it was a Jewish--I don't know who it was because I don't\nthink it exists anymore. However, somewhere in the last few years, you could send to\nBloomsbury House for your record. They checked on kinders and things like that.\n(?Anhel?) and my aunt in England knew them. I don't know how she knew Doctor\n(?Lobby Nickels?) but they had a maid who was German, and my aunt wasto tell you the\ntruth, I really don't know, but anyhow Ruth went to live with Doctor Lobby Nickles. But\nthen Bloomsbury House evacuated when the bombs started falling in London, evacuated\nsome of these kinder to hotels, and Ruth was evacuated to a hostel. Sobut Lobby Nickels\nand Nick was Jewish. They were Jewish. And how Esther got to England with the\nKindertransport, we don't really know. It was in June.",
        "A: Yeah, before the war. I think they must have advertised it for people who wanted to\ntake--because they got 10,000 kids out.

So\nshe wentmy aunt went to the station to see Esther, and Esther naturally walked towards\nher. I guess because she looked like my mother. I don't really know. But she went to the\nHarrison's, and the Harrison's were not Jewish. And they had one son, and you would\nthink--Allen was seven, I think, at the time. You would think he would be jealous of her.\nHe adores--to this day, he adores the ground she walks on. He's been over herecomes\nover here quite often. And he's likethe parents have since died, but that's how Esther got\nto the Harrison's.",

I remember my mother never\nwrote this to us, but they couldn't--they could only go shoppinggrocery shopping certain\ntimes, and then there was nothing left in the stores. And we met someone when we went\nover there who used to leave food at my parents doorstep at night. Because, you know, I\nthink the people who lived in Adelsheim, there were no Nazis. There were no Nazis. We\nalso met someone with a son who said--who was there when they rounded up all the\nJews.

You had your\njob, and that's what you did. Well, they hired somebody. They were thinking of hiring\nsomeone to cut down on the working hours, and that person learned the whole thing. I\nlearned the whole thing. She called me. I don't know if either one of you is Jewish.",

But Hyman Goldman had a son Erin who was friends\nwith Morris's brother, and one day Hyman Goldman said to him, \"You know, you met\nMorris Esenstad? His brother's checking into you.\" I couldn't believe it. Morris's brother\nwas friends with Hyman Goldman's son. And Leon checked with Erin on me. Did youl\nmean I couldn't get over that. But, you know, that's how it goes.",

        "A: That was started many years ago. The problem was what to do with Esther over the\nsummer, and Hyman Goldman was on the board of Camp Louise, which 1s a Jewish\ncamp. So for five dollars a week, we would send her to camp. He was on the board, you\nknow.",

        "A: This is Allen. This is my son and his wife and their two children, and this is my\ndaughter's family. I don't think I have a picture of Julie. That's her, but--you know, at\ndifferentand this is my uncle's granddaughter.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I don't know about Edith. She was in Germany duringwhen she was in the army,\nshe was stationed in Germany, and she would tell meand she and somebody else went to\nAdelsheim.",
        "A: When she was in the army.",
        "A: And someone on the street stopped her and said, \"Are you Adolf Rosenfeld's\ndaughter?\" So that's what happened. Let's see--but their attitude--I remember Esther said\nto me--who can't remember Germany. She was tooshe was thinking of going back, and\nshe said to me, \"Did you ever consider going back?\" As if they couldget lost in the sea--I\nsaid, \"No. I wouldn't.\" Well, she persuaded me to change my mind, but that was in, I\nthink '89 or something. I don't remember the date, but Morris got sick. So they wentwe\nmade agreements to go, but Morris got sick, and she and her husband went. So I guess\nthat was my attitude at that time. I don't ever care to go back, but when Allen went and\nmet Rinehart, I changed my mind. I went to the house where I was born, you know. Have\nyou ever lived in a small place?",
        "A: Whenin a little town, you see a bunch of people, and you wonder why they're there.\nWe were standing in Korb. Rinehart had taken us there. In front of this, he says, \"This 1s\nthe house,\" and I have pictures of the house. That's where your father lived. So we were\nstanding there, and somebody from the house looked out, and they wondered while all\nthese people were standing there, and they said something. And it was the daughter who\nhadher parents had bought the house from my father, and she didn't live in it, but she\ncame there once a year to go to the cemetery of her parents, and that's when she stayed in\nthe house. So they just happened to be in the house and they asked us into the house. We\nwent into the house. Then we went back to Adelsheim. The German government had sold\nmy parent's house to somebody who we wentwere invited into that house, which had\nchanged greatly from when we lived in it.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "A: It was. I think so.",
        "A: She looked a little--yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Twice.",
        "A: In '90, and in '95.",
        "A: Yeah. That must have been wrong.",
        "A: I have to ask Esther. I don't remember, but they had a memorial.",
        "A: Forfor I think it was in 202.",
        "A: 60 years 60 years.",
        "A: In 202.",
        "A: Yeah. That was over the weekend.",
        "A: But it was a funny thing, you know, Rinehart had wrote us what they were doing, and\nhe wrote to me, andI said to Esther, \"You know, Esther, I think we ought to go.\" And she\njust went like that. About 2025 years ago, I got a letter from someone in Ireland. And\nsaid, \"Dear Mrs. Esenstad, I think we are related.\" Well, he's thethe man who wrote it is\na geologist, and he had been in a department in Ireland, and he went to Germany for a\ndig, and, you know, they keep all kinds of records. His mother was Jewish. His father\nwasn't, but when the war started--or beforehis Jewish grandmother and his Jewish aunt\ncame to live with them in England, and they got to England because they were antiNazi\nand they escaped. I think they met at the university somewhere in Germany and went to\nwork for the pope. And they both converted to Catholicism, but he said he was greatly\ninfluenced by his Jewish grandmother and aunt. So when he went back to Germany on a\ndig, he thought he would find out about his mother. I had written to Germany because I\nneeded copies of birth certificates, and that led him to Korb, and when he got to Korblater\nI said to him, you know, soandso 1s in Englandis in America. And he wrote. They gave\nhim my address, and he wrote to me, and he told me how we were related. He sent us\nfamily trees.",
        "A: His great grandhe'sPeter is now 60 something, I would think. He's much younger than\nwe are. His greatsomehow or another, his great, great grandfather and my great, great,\ngreatwhatever, very far. But, you know, we are--and we've met and he's been here a\ncouple of times. They came for Amelia's Bot Mitzvah, he and his wife. We've stayed at\nhis house in Ireland and spent some time with him. But there we are. You never know\nwho you",

        "A: Well, I don't know. I wouldn't know.",
        "A: You know, this person that I worked with in England, he came on my Kindertransport\ntoo. We never talked about it. The Kindertransportchildren didn't ask too many questions,\nbut they do know. They do know. We all have the most wonderful children so, right? But\nit'sKindertransport has only been talked about since '89, and that is because the 50th\nanniversary of the Kindertransport and the Leventhal--whatever her name 1s--half this\nreunion. Do you know about that?",
        "A: She and her sister organized this reunion--5Oyear reunion in London. We didn't go.\nThey came from all over. They camel didn't thinkI don't think we thought they would\nhave such a turn out. But it's only been since that time that people have really talked\nabout the Kindertransport. We have an organization herea branch. There's a national in\nNew York. That's it. What else.",
        "A: Never saw them again.",
        "A: I think family.",
        "A: I think so. They all were very close with their siblings, I think. And I remember all the\nletters from my mother--we should do this, and we should do that, and we shouldyou\nknow. She gave us orders because I don't think--I mean it's unimaginable, Auschwitz.\nThey would not have--",
