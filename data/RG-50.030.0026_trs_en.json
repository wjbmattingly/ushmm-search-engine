        "A: As I got older, my bigger brother, he was six years older, Henry Meyer, our whole family was\nin Bialystok and around Bialystok in the little towns. My grandfather, my grandmother, my\naunts, my uncles. And he went there to high school, of course it was a Hebrew high school, my\nfather was a Zionist.

And -- and he went, finished it eight cla -- eight grades, and he went to Bialystok. My\nparents hand him to -- to the family, to stay with them. And I was still finishing up public school.\nThe last year of his graduation from high school, I entered high school, to Bialystok, they send\nme. He finished and they send me. In the first half a year, when I came home for Hanukkah, for\nvacation -- and I will say we had the first phone in the whole little town. Had a phone in the --\nmy father\u2019s business, and we had a phone home. And -- I\u2019m sorry, the druggist had a phone. And\nas I was sitting and doing my homework, I heard a call. I knew that you cannot get too many\ncalls there. And they said, comes -- hurry, come with the doctor, your mother passed -- fainted.\nAnd my father was playing checkers my neighbor next door. So I call him. I still remember how\nI climbed the -- climbed the stairs. I got such a weakness 1n my -- being so young, in my knees,\nbecause the doctor was some very high steps. You had to climb the steps and I just couldn\u2019t get\non the steps. So on four I climbed the step screaming, my mother -- I didn\u2019t say my mother\nfainted, I said, \u201cMy mother\u2019s dying, my mother\u2019s dying.\u201d It was too late. He came there, you\nknow, it wasn\u2019t a long distance to -- to drive or to walk, 1s -- was -- it\u2019s -- everything was very\nclose. But my mother fell off the chair and that was it. Never saw. In fact, when we brought her\nhome, she was so warm because she was fresh dressed. And my mother was a very elegant\nwoman. With the lipstick on her lips, I never -- I didn\u2019t let her to put -- I -- I did not let to put her\nin the floor because I didn\u2019t believe that she is dead. And from there on my trouble started. My\nbrother returned to finish his schooling, to get his m -- his -- what do you get, diploma?",
        "Q: Degree.",
        "A: His degree, and -- and I had to remain home. And that summer -- and my father, on top of\neverything got very sick. He didn\u2019t take any food, he was a heavy smoker. He was transferred to\n[indecipherable] to a place where they tried to feed him very often, and you know, things that\nhad -- had a lot of calories like a lot of butter and just to -- his intestines were terrible, terrible.\nHe was there seven months. So, in other words, besides the girl that worked for us and -- for so\nmany years, I had no mother, I had no father. But my mother\u2019s brother stayed with us to watch\nme. And he took care of some of the business and then my father\u2019s brother used to come to take\ncare on the business. And this -- there was no life already, this -- everything was, you know,\nwent to pieces. And my har -- my father was there seven months until he returned home. And at\nthe meantime, I went already to my aunt -- aunt\u2019s -- to his sister, to my father\u2019s sisters, to\nBialystok, because I entered school bo -- baca -- my brother finished and I entered.",
        "Q: So you were going to school during this time?",
        "A: Right, and my bro --",
        "Q: And what else did you do -- what else did you do during that time?",
        "A: Nothing much, I had -- my family was very big in Bialystok, I had a lot of young cousins.\nYou know, everybody -- when you get to be already beaten but [indecipherable] with no mother,\nwith no father, father was sick, we didn\u2019t know what the -- tomorrow will bring. Ye --",
        "Q: You were how -- you were how old at this time?",
        "A: 13. 13. My mother died exact on my birth -- my 13\" birthday. So I stayed a whole year there\nwith my aunts. I was very thin, I was sick. I couldn\u2019t take any food, I was vomiting. My aunts\nhad full hands with me. For the summertime, my brother came to take me, they didn\u2019t trust me to\ncome home myself. So he took a sleeping train, I should be -- and I vomit a lot when I was\ntraveling, so he was afraid to let me travel just like that. So he took me in the sleeping train, and\nwe came home. Before we had to -- we didn\u2019t have a station. Like here, you come, you take a\ncab, you go to -- from the airport, straight. We had to travel from my town. We had a man that\nused to pick us up by wagon and horse. So he was waiting [indecipherable] about 30 kilometers -\n- 50 kilometers from -- from -- from my town. And he used to bring us home. He knew -- he\nworked for us f -- for my father for so many years. And this was star -- we are supposed to meet\nthe man to take us home, my brother said, you know, \u201cWe\u2019ll make a stop here in --in this little\ntown Moladetchna.\u201d Said, \u201cWhat for?\u201d \u201cOh, I want to introduce you to somebody.\u201d He was\nafraid to tell me because I wouldn\u2019t go home. He knew that I cannot have a su-substitute for my\nmother, he knew my attitude. So he was afraid that I won\u2019t come home for the summer. But so\nclose to home, where will I go, I cannot go back already. So he decided that he\u2019ll tell me. My\nfather, returning from his convalescent home, wherever he was, at the train he met a woman\nfrom Wilna which was a divorcee with a child -- with a son three years older than I. And my\nfather was a ga -- a very good looking man, very handsome and with a lot of money, so what\u2019s\nbad about? She was a very smart cookie. She knew how to take him in, and [indecipherable] and\n-- and my brother knew about it, and to me they didn\u2019t say until I will meet her. Sure, in the first\ntime she was very nice, tried to impress me. But I do -- didn\u2019t stay there more, I just couldn\u2019t\npicture somebody taking my mom\u2019s place. And we stayed there a day or two and we went home.\nAnd then slowly, slowly, she start to come visiting and I knew that it\u2019s something more than a\nplain visit. You know, I wasn\u2019t really baby baby. And I saw my father\u2019s attitude, he was in ba --\nhe was in bad shape, he didn\u2019t -- he wanted to do so much for his kids. And in the same token, I\nguess he fell in love. Which I could swear, and anybody else that knew him, that this could never\nhappen after -- because s-such a life that he had with my mother, you don\u2019t see, you don\u2019t hear.\nAnd that was -- and that was it. Then slowly, slowly, now this was \u201939 already, close to the 40\u2019s,\nthe Russian come in. My father was already the -- they wanted him, they were watching him, he\ncouldn\u2019t do this, he couldn\u2019t do this. Everything is capitalism, everything is richness, and -- and\nhe -- he cannot have any [indecipherable]. E-Every day they found something else to a -- to\nblame him. And he\u2019s on --",
        "Q: And you were a child, were -- were you aware of the --",
        "A: Yeah, because I was -- I wasn\u2019t really a stupid child, I was -- I knew. And I went through\nright, a lo -- a lot, I went through a lot. And my mother was a extremely intelligent woman, so\nwas my father. He put in too much effort in their kids. I don\u2019t know if shows today, but at that\ntime it showed.",
        "Q: Were you still going to school then?",
        "A: Ah, sure -- no, that time it was a mishmash. There was no schooling, there were -- the Poland\nwent out, the Russian, it didn\u2019t come in. There was a mishmash. As soon the Russian came and\nsettled their government, I went back to school. And my father said he is not going to Siberia no\nmatter what. If it won\u2019t be today, it\u2019s going to be tomorrow, but they are looking after him. And\none night he picked up himself and he went, he said, you stay home, to my stepmother and her\nson, and I\u2019ll go. In meantime she brought already -- she had in Wilna a s -- two sisters and a\nmother, and she brought them in, you know, to our town, to be closer to her. Why not support the\nwhole family, only her? So they got to go our little town, and they got my -- my father got for\nthem an apartment, not a big and luxurious apartment, but manageable.",
        "Q: And the name of your town?",
        "A: This was in Grudeck up -- but this wasn\u2019t in Grudeck, I -- I meant to say that this was in Lida,\nafter we moved to Lida. And my father picked up himself and he went to look, if it wouldn\u2019t be\nLida it would be a different town. But he had a few people that he knew in Lida, so he decided\nhe\u2019ll go first there. Sure enough, he got, you know, in good times we would never pass that\nstreet. But he didn\u2019t want to be showing, he didn\u2019t want to be -- people should, you know,\nrecognize him. He wanted to sit quiet, and have his meals and see what will -- will happen. And\nwe left everything, and we moved to this town, to Lida with -- comparing our -- our conditions\nthat we lived, with the help, and with the luxury and with -- with the -- with all kind of -- of what\ndo you call this on the floor, the rugs, the Persian rugs, and all that going and it\u2019s such a mess,\nit\u2019s -- it was like th -- going in a stable.

        "A: A wagon. Wagon [indecipherable] train, wagons. He hired somebody to transport us.\n[indecipherable] too many around we need to get our private belongings, we needed our clothes.\nWe\u2019re storing about furniture here and there, you know.

I went to school with them.\nThey -- it -- vera -- you know where you come, you are two years old, and you grow u -- and you\nare f -- the -- 14 - 15, how can you desert them? And that\u2019s one house next to the other, and\nthat\u2019s not that you have to take the car and drive. So when you look through the window you\nalways saw somebody walking by, passing by, knocking in your door, knocking in your window.\nSo she didn\u2019t like this, she didn\u2019t like that.",

        "A: And we still lived in the same apartment, and in the beginning it was again the Russians\nstarted to leave and the Germans started to come in, and there was no government, there was no\ncity, everything was burning, everything was in fire. We had to leave for a few days the city with\nmy father and stepmother and my brother to some, you know, village, to survive, because we\ndidn\u2019t know how li -- badly that will burn, if it will reach us. Not that we have so much to lose\nalready, but my father had his money. And -- and then I -- I\u2019m trying to remember what\nhappened. And then my husband was -- he\u2019s still in Lida, he saw the whole commotion. They got\nvery close, they -- both my step-aunt and him got so like they would live together already. So he\ntook her, he took bicycles for her and for him, and he ran -- as soon they saw that Lida is\nburning, they decided they\u2019Il go to -- his father had a mail [indecipherable] carriage\n[indecipherable] and he decided that sa -- there it will be the safetiest place for him.

He said what will happen to everybody -- I don\u2019t know if it was\nwise, or not wise, but he did not feel like to be exception, like he could do it and nobody else can\ndo it because he had a way of escaping. So after we stayed by the -- in the village, you know, we\nescaped for a few days and the major burning of the city stopped, we returned to our house. Sure,\npeople took away things, sto -- the sto -- things were stolen, a -- a lot of mas -- mishmash. And\nthis happened until -- yeah, I worked at the Germans, and right near me where lived, very -- you\nknow, I am telling you, in good times we wouldn\u2019t even pass the street, not only live there. But\nthere was big -- a building, a empty, big building, and as the Germans walked into this -- to the\ncity, they occupied it and they made like a headquarters there and they hired young girls to work\nfor them, like to peel potatoes, like to clean, like to fix their socks if they are torn, to wash\nsomething small for them.

Me and my -- we were four people and my stepmother\u2019s\nmother and sister, one, because the other one went with my husband. As of there -- my husband\ndidn\u2019t like my stepmother\u2019s attitude, but she was a very clever woman, my stepmother. I give\ncredit where credit is due, she was intelligent, and -- but by nature she was bad. You know, she\nhad the terrible nature. And he could not -- he suffered a lot with me when he used to come to\nvisit us and see her attitude, it bothered him. You could see on his face that it hurts him. And\nthen he used maybe to tell his girlfriend, and she used to tell her sister, and it was even worst,\nbecause she used to tell her, stop that, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very -- people see, people pay\nattention to it, stop that, change a little bit your attitude.

In my section I\nwas a messenger in Judenrat. So whatever they told me, go tell this one and this one that he is\ncalled to the Judenrat. There was no phones. Well, this one, this one, tell him that he has to be at\nthis time there and there. Tell the policeman has to come and take him, you know? That -- that\nwas the only way that we could communicate.",
        "Q: And this continued until?",
        "A: Then in -- yeah, my husband [indecipherable] few times to the si -- to the -- to Lida. Already\n19\" of June he had the Russian passport -- passport, and not passport but papers. He grew -- he\nlooked exactly like my son looking now, with the big moustache. His name was Belowsky and\nhe had a friend, but you know, it was very, very dangerous because he knew a lot of people\nalready and he was afraid that somebody will recognize him. And he tried to get through to us,\nand my father\u2019s accept to come to their village to enter the forest. And my father said nothing\ndoing. It will be with everybody it will be with me. He made the effort maybe two or three times.\nHe didn\u2019t help him, until the real section came up, and it was too late. On the shein, on the permit\nfor my stepbrother that worked in the -- in the military barracks -- military bases, we could\nsurvive. In other words, the whole action was on our street. And they went from door to door, [Il\nnever forget, May eight, it\u2019s unbelievable, it was snowing. And I went out, my father told me to\nget dressed, but I didn\u2019t have a chance because I thought maybe they\u2019Il leave out our house,\nmaybe they won\u2019t come in to us. You didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but they went house by\nhouse and -- and that morning my father got up and he says, \u201cI had a dream.\u201d Said, what kind of\na -- he says, \u201cThis situations 1s no good.\u201d I said, \u201cDaddy, why didn\u2019t you go, you had a such\n[indecipherable]?\u201d \u201cI told you, he has his family there too, his relatives from Novagudek. Who\nwill sleep in your woods, who can sleep? We\u2019re not animals.\u201d I said what\u2019s -- Pll answer you\nwhat you answered, what will be with everybody it will be with you. There 1s people too.\nNothing to eat. Nothing doing, I\u2019m not escaping, I\u2019m not hiding my head. Fine. I was -- I was\nunder his command. We were re -- we respected our parents very highly. So before he -- so he\nsaid he had a dream that Ill remain, but I'll be leaving the town, the -- that Pl -- Pll go through\nthe section with not being hurt, they won\u2019t kill me. He doesn\u2019t know what will happen to him,\nbut he knows that I?ll remain. Then, leave the stories already for later, not for now. There\u2019s no\ntime. And sure enough, on this w -- the Germans went in barefoot, in the snow in my nightgown\nthey took me to the -- to this section. And it went -- my stepmother\u2019s mother and her sister, one\nof her sisters, Fanny, and the guy sh -- did -- the German was standing and we didn\u2019t know left is\nto le -- to leave or right is to leave, but right by the older woman that was there, mother was\nalready older. So he put his hand, you know, like cut. We four went to the left, they went to the\nright. Later on we found out that we remained and they went -- and they were killed. And this\nwas pretty long, nobody knew when and what and how. This was pretty long until they send us\nthe [indecipherable] ghetto, because they took out plenty of people there, and you could go --\nthey didn\u2019t assigned you, you have to go to this house, to this house. Whatever you grabbed,\nwhich house you grabbed when they brought you on their -- on their security, on German\nsecurity to the ghetto, you knew already that you are lost, that you cannot go out from here, that\nthe ghetto 1s already a closed one, that you have a curfew. And we went out to a house -- into a\nhouse.",
        "Q: What happened to your father?",
        "A: Father was with me. My father and me. My father died in the woods. He was killed in the\nwoods.",
        "Q: So you went to the ghetto.",
        "A: And next day we had to go already to -- it was organized about the work. What shall I tell\nyou, there was five, six families in that -- in a room. You practically slept to -- one on top of the\nother, such a narrow -- whatever you -- it was in the house cause those people, they took out\nfrom the houses. How many of them were dead, I don\u2019t know. I know that day it was killed five\nand a half thousand people in that -- in that day.",
        "Q: What was your daily life like in the -- in the ghetto?",
        "A: From the morning [indecipherable] we were -- had to get up in the morning and somebody\nwas waiting outside for us in a certain -- in the beginning when Lida was ruined and the Germans\ncame, we were cleaning the -- the bricks, you know, that -- the houses that was ruined, to clean\nup the bricks and make the property, clean up the properties. It was not easy work. Sunday\nmorning the Germans were playing with the -- with us a game, let the big dogs -- I worked just\nacross the -- their -- their residence. They used to let the dogs down, make a game with us, and\nthe dog used to tear you in pieces. And there were like wooden, you know, like trays that you put\nthe bricks, and they told you not to [indecipherable] bricks, to slap -- they told you to put -- that\nyou should really get a backache, or break your neck or break your head. So this -- two of you\ncou -- could only sneak in when they didn\u2019t look at you. That was my first job. And the worst\nthing was Sundays, when they used to eat their fat and nice breakfast, and then go for a walk, but\ntheir -- their dogs ate better than we ate [indecipherable] the whole time that they were there.",
        "Q: Where did you get food from?",
        "A: We used -- we -- we used to go to work, you know, it\u2019s [indecipherable] when you -- we\nknew some -- you gave away everything from yourself, the money and everything, th -- and the\npeasants that knew you used to sneak in, that you bought from them all of your life, eggs, or milk\nor this or that. They used to pity you in the beginning and they give you and then they made\ngood business too. If you had money they sold to you, but not always you could buy. Ifa\nGerman used to catch you and he was in a bad mood, you didn\u2019t want to. So he was a --",
        "Q: But you could not get -- you could not get outside the [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, I\u2019m talking about even before the ghetto got closed.",
        "Q: Yeah, oh.",
        "A: In the ghetto there was certain things that you could bring in, not too much, and listen, Jews\nare always very smart people, they always knew how to get along.",
        "Q: Were there many young children your age there with --",
        "A: Yeah, I have a lot of friend with -- we survived together, yeah, in that time after wa -- after\nthe -- I mean, the action. Sure I lost quite a few friends, this -- this was -- and then in this ghetto\nmy husband came one time. Said to my father, \u201cYou see, I told you what will happen. I warned\nyou, I begged you. You didn\u2019t have to go through that. The woods are full of trees and the trees\nare covering us. Here, no matter how you walk out, they\u2019Il see you.\u201d And I was upset about it\nbecause the reason that I worked in gardens of one of the Polacks -- lot of people, you know,\nwere used -- they -- they used to plant and we had to clean it and watch it and water it and there\nwas big fields of -- of -- of gardens. In the fee -- and it was so hot in the summer, and the\nGerman was standing over you and you couldn\u2019t -- you know, you really couldn\u2019t not work, or\nplay that you are sick, or you don\u2019t feel good. What -- what more you complain, the s -- more\nyou got over your head. Somehow my stepmother was very good fren -- friends with the owner\nof this -- of this gardens that he was in charge of them. I don\u2019t know if it was his or if he was\nonly in charge with the -- th-the Germans made him 1n charge of it. But he lived there, and as\nsoon you know, they produced to make [indecipherable] tomorrow was a -- a section. To-\nTomorrow it will be something happen. I pass by I heard somebody say tomorrow something\nwill happen this guy, this guy. And that\u2019s how in the ghetto started to where the talking and what\nto -- what we will do, where will we hide, and what -- how and what. At night still were young,\nwe used to -- too long we couldn\u2019t go, and too far we couldn\u2019t go, but next door we used to\n[indecipherable] and come to one backyard all together and sing fa -- Hebrew songs and -- and\ntell stories and what will happen, how come that we\u2019ll have a terrible youth. And you know, and\ngo home, next day you had to go to work. So I remember one fact, that right after this action in\nma -- in May eight, and they told us that the next day we have to go to work and we should all\nget together in this and this point. I had a watch. I wanted to check the time I shouldn\u2019t be too\nlate because I was afraid. You had so much fear in yourself, you weren\u2019t -- when he didn\u2019t mean\nto do nothing to you but to look. Not so much I -- even from the Germans, like from the Polacks\nthat the pol -- the police that helped them out. And I -- I ask somebody what time 1s this, and a\nPolish guy came over to me and he said the time, and I said thank you, and we went into the\nhouse. Didn\u2019t take an hour, he comes in with a German. He says, \u201cWhere is the girl that asked\nme what time it is?\u201d My father ra -- pushed me already away out to the room, complete to\nanother room where other people were. And he showed him, he said this one, this one. He said\nno. I want to see the girl that asked me the time. So my father got very nervous and he started\nalready, he said, \u201cKill me. What do you want to do to her? Kill her? Kill me, \u2019'm old man.\u201d Four\n-- he was maybe 46 years there. Kill me. Said, \u201cNo, PII tell you what, I won\u2019t do nothing to you.\nPll -- 11 murder you, but after you give me your -- your dau -- what connection do you have?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t want to tell him that I\u2019m his daughter. Anyway, I saw it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very crucial, I came\nout. I came out and he said -- \u201cI didn\u2019t do nothing,\u201d I said, \u201cI just ask you what time because I\nwanted to be on time tomorrow morning.\u201d It was just a stupid game that he wanted to scare the\nwhole house and he want to make a -- a game of it. Turned around, took away my watch and\nwent out. What di -- what did I do? But just stupid game. You know, anything to show the\nauthorities that they -- they-they are the big shots. And this wasn\u2019t the lesson for my father\neither, because that time I started to bother him [indecipherable] look, we went through, we\ncould have waited. Tuvya asked us, he begged us, who else ha -- who else has in the whole\nghetto such a privilege to go out of the ghetto one of the first ones because people would love it,\nbut they didn\u2019t know how and what. What Daddy said, Daddy said. And after the action this was\n[indecipherable] I\u2019ll never forget. I came for my girlfriend, in fact, she was killed wi -- in the\nwoods, from the white Polacks. Her sister and brother-in-law still in Israel, and the whole family\nwas saved by my husband. And we were sitting in their backyard, singing, you know, songs from\n-- from -- from I don\u2019t know, maybe 60 - 70 years ago they used to sing that in -- in the Jewish\ntradition. And I came home, and I said -- and I [indecipherable] crawl to my bed. It was very\ncrowded to pass b-by to find your bed, you know, but was cold and chilly. So I took my\ngirlfriend\u2019s jacket, I put the -- threw it on top of me. A blazer. Came home and I lay down in bed,\ntook off the jacket, took off my clothes, lay down [indecipherable] ready to work.\n[indecipherable] I wasn\u2019t working all right. [indecipherable] had, you know, we had -- didn\u2019t\nhave any peace in the house, she always why didn\u2019t you do that. Why didn\u2019t you cook, why\ndidn\u2019t you bring, why didn\u2019t you that? Til one day, I\u2019m going -- I\u2019Il bad -- back to this story with\nma -- with the jacket, because that was the night that we left the ghetto. But what I want to tell\nyou from my stepmother and I said, in the beginning I didn\u2019t want to confess to. [indecipherable]\nI will tell it. Let it be on record, let people know that when you are making a hole for somebody,\nyou are the first one to fall. She said to me -- I come to work in the fields and the one that I told\nyou was in charge of me, says to me, \u201cToday you\u2019ll work later.\u201d I said, \u201cHow can I work later,\nhow can I get to the ghetto later? After six o\u2019clock, if I\u2019ll be met by -- by the Germans and by the\npolice, I\u2019ll be killed.\u201d We have no excuse, they kill you on the spot. That was a [indecipherable]\nand now order [indecipherable]. Said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you but I need you for work.\u201d\nWhat can I do? Helpless. My stepmother sometimes didn\u2019t come home when she heard rumors\nthat something\u2019s going to happen the ha -- ghetto, she used to hide herself there on the roof. He\nused to hide her. Her and another few. Came six o\u2019clock he says to me, \u201cGo home.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\ntold me to stay. I have nothing to lose already, cause after six I won\u2019t go nowhere.\u201d He said, \u201cGo,\ngo with the group, return to the ghetto in time.\u201d Passed a few weeks, and he starts telling me a\nstory, that my stepmother paid with the money from five ruble gold, of my father\u2019s money to\nkeep me later in order he should send me home and I should be killed by the Germans. So what\nfor you needed the Germans that your own people could kill you. And I -- I kept it a secret for a\nlong, long time. And he said to me, \u201cYou know, even not being Jewish, I had no conscious,\nbecause you were so innocent, I couldn\u2019t do it. I took the money from her, but was for money\nthey were [indecipherable]. But I told her P\u2019ll do some other time, not today.\u201d And I kept it a\nsecret for a long time, I didn\u2019t tell no one. First well I thought nobody will believe me. In this\ntime of struggle for your life, of survival, you are able take my father\u2019s money and to kill me? I -",
        "Q: [indecipherable] the story of the blazer, your friend --",
        "A: Yes. That night with -- I came home with my friend\u2019s blazer. I don\u2019t recall actual night. And I\nwent to sleep, and all of a sudden I hear somebody\u2019s touching me. I woke up, I thought my father\nmaybe he\u2019s not feeling well. He says, \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I decided to leave immediately, get\ndressed. If you -- my eyes [indecipherable] Daddy, takes time to get ready, Daddy, let me put on\nmy shoes. I don\u2019t want to wait [indecipherable] can change my mind. Now, right now. And we\nwere the first ones, me, my stepmother, my stepbrother and my father, to crawl out from the\nGlost ghetto.

        "Q: Who was leading you?",
        "A: Nobody, but on the other side Tuvya Bielsky was waiting for us. And that\u2019s it. That\u2019s how we\ncame to [indecipherable] to the -- to the forest. Then he met -- when he met us, he brought us to\nsomebody that he knew for awhile, to rest up and a few hours later, these two brothers were\nwaiting deeper in the woods for us, and then I came, and there were 17 people of the family and\nwith us it was 21. And that\u2019s how it start.",
        "Q: Was anybody else aware when you were leaving the house?",
        "A: No. Nobody knew. We disappeared with no sound, with no nothing. Was very dangerous.",
        "Q: What did you take with you?",
        "A: Absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing, just to chan -- one change -- you couldn\u2019t -- how can\nyou, you have to crawl, you have to run, you have to walk, you have to be in -- in -- you know,\n[indecipherable] for the rain. It\u2019s -- Europe is not -- Europe is not America or Florida. You know,\nyou never know, there could be below zero, maybe 20 or 40 degree below zero. And that\u2019s how I\nsurvived til we left the woods in \u00b044.",
        "Q: Ho-How did your husband know that you were leaving at that time?",
        "A: Oh, he -- he came to the ghetto just -- in the ghetto, in the Glost ghetto he came one time, and\nthen he send somebody -- to the same peasant where we stopped, you know, for a rest, when he\nwas waiting for us behind the ghetto, about two, three kilometers behind the ghetto he was\nwaiting for us. And he took us to this peasant and this peasant came to my father to tell him.\nBecause he used to come very often to bring us something, you know, like a piece of bread, or\nsome milk, or some something. Some cheese. So he said Tuvya was here, he asked me to go and\nto tell you again and again. So I guess my father had some kind of a -- at wa -- sa -- was -- was\ntalking to this man, but he didn\u2019t tell us, us he surprised. Maybe his wife knew, but us he\nsurprised. Me and my stepbrother were very much surprised. Later this same night we had to go\nout. And that\u2019s how it started. We --",

        "A: I was escaping, I -- I don\u2019t know, I had -- I had the picture of my old -- that whole night was\nthe fi -- picture in front of me from the bench, from where I put on my girlfriend\u2019s jacket. The\nwhole young people there were sitting, and just like I left everything behind me. I wa -- I didn\u2019t\nhave a feeling of sorry, but I -- I said to myself, why couldn\u2019t I share with them and tell them?\nFirst of all, I didn\u2019t know, because I didn\u2019t know until I didn\u2019t come home. And I didn\u2019t go into\nbed, my father came to me, because he was afraid maybe next bed, maybe I\u2019Il te-tell somebody\nsomething. You know? But I had a picture, oh they remained there, they\u2019Il have to go to work\ntomorrow. They\u2019|l have Sunday the same show with the dogs. They\u2019 ll have this, they\u2019 ll have\nthat. I was too young to have special feelings. But I said oh, I'll miss that sitting in the backyard\nand not seeing my friends. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going, I\u2019m going to the wolves, I\u2019m going to\nthe bears, I\u2019m going to the -- to the woods without nothing. It\u2019s very har -- 1t was very hard to\nturn into a animal, being a human being. In that time we were animals, but we were -- we had\nfreedom. We could move. Not in daytime, but at night time. And that\u2019s how the leadership of my\nhusband went. My husband was [indecipherable] then we were constantly together. He was with\nhis girlfriend and I was with my family, but this was counted as we lived in one bunker, you\nknow, we made one -- one place of -- of living together. And he saw that -- how much suffering\nI\u2019m [indecipherable] how alone I am in this world. And he saw that my father wants to help me\nand he can, but he was -- he was threatened that she\u2019l leave him [indecipherable] do that. So he -\n- and so he tried, he tried to supply me boots, he tried to supply me warm clothes. He tried to\nalways when he went out to bring something more for me. He told me always not to take so\nmuch to heart, things will change, everything will pass.",
        "Q: Where was the first place that you stayed after you got out?",
        "A: The first place was very close, I don\u2019t remember exactly, but it was very -- it wasn\u2019t\norganized. And that people were already -- the one, the family people that were there, they -- and\nthe -- and the -- there were family people and there were neighbors next village from them, that\nthey were relatives of m -- of my brother-in-law, that he got involved with one of their daughters,\nso he took out the parents, and he took out the sisters and the brothers. All together with us it was\n21 people. But the other 17 people started already, especially the older people. What are you\ngoing to do, how will you feed them, at least we are 17 people, here four more mouths, four\nmore this. But my husband always find a way. He always said to [indecipherable] \u201cIll find a\nway to -- to feed them, Ill find a way to supply them. Don\u2019t you worry about. It\u2019s more Jews,\nit\u2019s better.\u201d And slowly, slowly he started with his love and he wants to save Jews from the\nghetto. He doesn\u2019t care how, he doesn\u2019t care what people will say, he doesn\u2019t care if they\u2019 Il be\nsatisfied with it. He must save Jews from -- and he was asked the question, what would you\nrather do? Kill 10 Germans or save one Jew? And very openly and with a lot of dignity he said,\n\u201cSave one Jew.\u201d",
        "Q: Well -- well I -- yeah, we\u2019re going to have to change the tape on that wonderful quote. We\u2019re\ngoing to change tapes.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: All right, tell us again who made up the group, the first group, once you got out of the ghetto.",
        "A: When I came to the woods, there was no group, there was a family, members of the family,\nthere was -- all related to each other. And they were in -- hesitating if to accept new people.\nBecause like I had mentioned before, there was a question of supporting them, there was a\nquestion of feeding them, and this wasn\u2019t the easy thing, because they had nothing with -- a-and\nthey were empty handed. The whole luck of it was that they were raised -- the Bielskys were\nraised in villages, in hills, in woods, wi -- and trees were their friends. So they weren\u2019t afraid to\nknock in a peasant\u2019s window. They weren\u2019t afraid if -- to knock in -- and they had s -- their\nstories with the peasant. For instance my husband -- where they -- wher -- f-first of all where\nthey -- where they came during the day, they didn\u2019t sleep the night. Or they slept, they didn\u2019t --\nthey weren\u2019t during the day. They couldn\u2019t stay because they were afraid for their own shadow,\nand we didn\u2019t have any trust. It\u2019s not [indecipherable] determines. That was, at that time we were\n-- we organized, it was White Russia. So you had the wh -- white Polacks, the white Russian.\nThen you had the Polacks that they wanted to be very friendly with the Germans and they helped\nthem a lot. So to give out a Jew, it was just a cinch. It was a -- a -- a big deal. And they were\nknow in there, in their facilities where they lived. But they had a -- their father had the -- a mill. I\npersonally did not know my in-laws. When I got to know them, they weren\u2019t alive already. Ah,\nwhen I could get to know them, they weren\u2019t alive already. They were taken away to\n[indecipherable] ghetto and were killed. So I knew only the one that they were in the ghettos --\nthey -- they were in the woods with us, I\u2019m sorry. And for instance, my husband had a friend --\nfirst of all, my husband was a military man. He was in the Polish army for two years and he was\na very good soldier and he had right away a [indecipherable] of certain things that he did better\nthan others. He was very good in languages. First of all, he was g -- he grew up between\nGentiles. They had the business, they had mills. They had t-to -- to grind th-their grains, they had\nto -- to do a lot of things that they -- you know, there was very little Jewish temples, if they had\nto go to temple for a holiday, they had to walk about two, three kilometers. They didn\u2019t have this\nin their village. They were the only Jewish family in their village. But they had good things too\ndone, and certain people that they want to remember, and th-the -- they pay -- they pay them a\ngood price later on. Meaning what? Let\u2019s say there was a neighbor, my husband\u2019s friend that\ncame to the mill for a certain thing. I don\u2019t remember what he came for but was -- I really -- I\nwasn\u2019t born there, I don\u2019t know the -- the -- all the obstacles there, but that\u2019s what I heard and\nread fa -- about my husband. So he came there, and there was a he -- they were not poor people\neither, the -- the neighbors, the -- the man that I\u2019m telling you the story about. And there was a\nmill by [indecipherable] not far from each other, and there was a big river. This guy was 12 or 13\nyears old and he went to the river, he jumped, and he drowned. My husband was right near the\nriver and he saw that. He jumped in his clothes and he saved him. His parents never could forget\nthat. In the time of the war, when he find out that he is somewhere in the neighborhood, he paid\nhim a visit. But he didn\u2019t know even which house is his. This was so many years ago.\nAccidentally he knocked in the house of his parents, and he ask him about Andre. And his father\nsays -- he recognized him immediately, he said, \u201cYou are -- God brought you here, you are my\nson\u2019s savior. You saved his life. He is not living with me, but right here and here he is living, go\nknock in his door, he\u2019|l be very happy to see you.\u201d And sure enough he did it, and as he knocked\nin the door, he said to him, \u201cIt\u2019s a very familiar voice, but I don\u2019t know the name, I don\u2019t\nremember you.\u201d He says, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember how you drowned and I saved you?\u201d \u201cOh my\nGod,\u201d he said, \u201cBielsky, what are you doing? I thought you are long time not between the\nliving.\u201d Took him in, he stationed him, he gave him to eat. There was days that th-they were\nhungry. They couldn\u2019t find the -- a house to go in or they couldn\u2019t, or there was Germans, or\nthere were Poles, or they -- the owner didn\u2019t let them in because he was afraid for him his ho --\nhis lo -- own life. But a lot of risked their own life. And he was very happy with him, and he\nsaid, \u201cLook, I\u2019m married, I have a family. Do me a favor, let me tell my wife that you are one\nfrom the Polacks that escaped from the army and you are trying to hide, and you are not Jewish.\u201d\nAt the moment my husband said to him, \u201cOkay, tell her what you want.\u201d But as the day passed\nand he rested up, and he came to his senses, he said, \u201c\u201cWhy should you lie to your wife? Did I lie\nto my conscious by saving you? I want to tell her the truth.\u201d And sure enough, she reacted\nbeautifully, according to the story from my husband. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are, you are\na human being, and Ill do anything and everything.\u201d But for the neighbors she tried to play the\nsame game. And at the same night, her sister-in-law came to visit them, she asks them -- they\nnamed him right away a different name, my husband, and she said, \u201cWho is this guest in your\nhouse?\u201d And she said her name was Mary, and she says, \u201cMary,\u201d to her sister-in-law, \u201coh, we\nhave a Polish guy that escaped from the army and he\u2019s hiding.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cyou know what?\nI want them all in my house next week. Ill make a little party and we\u2019ll have a good time. Bring\nyour guest along with you.\u201d Course for some reason, I don\u2019t know if they knew or they didn\u2019t\nknow, but they didn\u2019t go. Husband and wife didn\u2019t go, and my husband went to her, and he\nknocks in the door and walks in, and the table\u2019s all set, and five heavy-set Germans are sitting\nand drinking and eating. She didn\u2019t lose her head -- they ask right away who are you. She didn\u2019t\nlose her head and she says to them, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a friend. That\u2019s my sister-in-law\u2019s friend that he\u2019s\nworking for us, blah, blah, blah, whole story. They shook hands with him, he was shivering. He\nsaid that he da -- he was telling me always that he does not know how the table didn\u2019t turn over\nfrom his knees shaking. And he said -- and he drank, and he was afra -- afraid to drink too much,\nmaybe he\u2019ll say something, you know, you are not responsible for after awhile. So he said, \u201cYou\nknow what, I cannot leave -- I have to go to my work, I have to go to my job. I cannot stay too\nlong.\u201d And they ask -- so he ask them, he wanted to know what\u2019s going on in the world. He said,\n\u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s our situation by the way? How do we fight?\u201d \u201cOh, we are so close to Moscow.\u201d We are\nso close to here, we are so close to there. It won\u2019t take no time and we\u2019ll be the winners of the\nworld. Shook hands with them nicely, said goodnight and disappeared. He ran so fast -- it was a\ncold night -- he ran so fast that he thought in his mind it was a fantasy or a thought, I don\u2019t know\nhow to describe that, that somebody\u2019s running. He\u2019s hurt, he didn\u2019t realize that ha -- he\u2019s hurt,\nhe\u2019s speeding so fast that he thought that somebody\u2019s behind him running after him until he fell\ninto the snow, to the deep snow. And in the deep snow, saw that it\u2019s very cold, he\u2019ll freeze to\ndeath, he\u2019ll remain here. He got up, he shlepped through to some other house where they let him\nin and -- and at that time it was empty -- still empty handed. But this guy, I think -- I think, I\u2019m\nnot sure, gave him the first gun, or the first rifle, or the si -- fi -- or showed him a place where he\ncould get. But this was the first guy that filled his hands up that he should -- shouldn\u2019t be empty\nhanded.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s return back to your ex -- you got into the woods, and how big was the group of people\nthere?",
        "A: 17, with us 21.",
        "Q: Okay, and then what happened?",
        "A: And then a short while after that my husband is -- said to the whole group that not to worry,\nthe wa -- like this we won\u2019t survive, because small groups will have no chance. We have to try to\nbring people from -- from the ghettos. And he wrote a letter to his cousin, it was still in a -- in\n[indecipherable] in Novagudek ghetto and he told him, organize as much as you can, because\nthey had another pes -- farmer that spoke beautiful Jewish, you would never sa -- say that he\u2019s a\nGentile. And his son was in Novagudek in -- in the police station, a big -- a bigshot. But he was -\n- who know -- I don\u2019t know, or they paid him or they made money or he was a friend. I don\u2019t\nknow how -- how to -- to calculate that. But he had the whole information from the\n[indecipherable] ghetto and he was the one to send constantly with messages to the ghetto and\nget to the people and give them the letters. The first letter he sent to his cousin, a Bielsky, too.\nHis name was Yehuda Bielsky. And he wrote him, for your sake, \u201cFor my sake, for the sake for\nthe Jewish nation, please organize and get out of the ghetto. We had -- the roots are wide, the\nforests are deep. We\u2019ll survive, if not all of us, some of us. In ghetto you have no chance.\u201d With\nthis message, after awhile, came seven young boys. And one of them I want to tell you should\nhave died [indecipherable] mentioned it. And they sat down, seven boys and I think -- and I\u2019m\nvery sure that I don\u2019t remember exactly if two wives came with them, or they came a short time\nafter that. And they came to the woods. And then, in between them, they made a meeting and\nthey said, \u201c\u201cTuvya, you are the oldest from all of us,\u201d -- he was at that time in the early 30\u2019s, \u201cand\nyou had military experience, you were in the army, you know what discipline 1s. We want you to\nlead the group.\u201d So he answered them, \u201cIf you listen to me, and you\u2019ll obey my orders, [Il do it.\nIf not, take somebody else.\u201d So in one voice, they all said, \u201cWe\u2019ll agree, we\u2019ll do whatever you\nsay.\u201d When he was in the army he had a very -- first of all, before the army, when he was a\nyoung guy yet, he was always interested in Zionism. He wanted very much to go to Israel and to\nwork for kibbutz. But his parents -- one brother was already in the States and he -- his -- the\ncondition, the family conditions were so poor that he had no conscious to leave, a -- mommy say\n-- and -- and his mother said to him, you want to go to Israel, fine, take your brothers and sisters\nand go because we won\u2019t manage -- we won\u2019t be able to manage. So he was, you know, there\nwas all kind of parties in Europe, so he belonged to a party, it was a chalutz, he used to go out for\n-- for hard work, for building, for -- for -- for -- for other work, ha -- this was a -- he bel -- he\nbelonged to a party chalutz. But when he was mobilized to the Polish army, and the word Jew\nwas for him on such a level, that nobody, nobody could ta -- take away the pride from him, being\na Jew. So one time -- and -- and h-he -- he was very -- he was very good in the -- I\u2019m -- \u2019m\ngoing to a very important point here",

And that\u2019s when -- that\u2019s what -- his heart -- he had -- he had a\nheart from God, he had a heart from goodness. He -- just to do your favor or to care for you, that\nwas his whole life, because when he was called Jew in the army, he killed the Gentile, he killed\nit.

In the Russian groups, if you had a wife or\nyoung per -- a lover or whatever, you couldn\u2019t pick her, you had to go out. You ha -- they throw\nyou right away out.

There was\nalways 10 - 12 people around, always on horses, to find out what\u2019s going on. You couldn\u2019t live\nin the woods if you wouldn\u2019t know how far the Germans are with you -- from you. And then we\nhad a lot of problems from the Russian partisans.

My aunts\nhad full hands with me. For the summertime, my brother came to take me, they didn\u2019t trust me to\ncome home myself. So he took a sleeping train, I should be -- and I vomit a lot when I was\ntraveling, so he was afraid to let me travel just like that. So he took me in the sleeping train, and\nwe came home. Before we had to -- we didn\u2019t have a station. Like here, you come, you take a\ncab, you go to -- from the airport, straight. We had to travel from my town.

But so\nclose to home, where will I go, I cannot go back already. So he decided that he\u2019ll tell me.

Sure, in the first\ntime she was very nice, tried to impress me. But I do -- didn\u2019t stay there more, I just couldn\u2019t\npicture somebody taking my mom\u2019s place. And we stayed there a day or two and we went home.\nAnd then slowly, slowly, she start to come visiting and I knew that it\u2019s something more than a\nplain visit.

As of there -- my husband\ndidn\u2019t like my stepmother\u2019s attitude, but she was a very clever woman, my stepmother. I give\ncredit where credit is due, she was intelligent, and -- but by nature she was bad. You know, she\nhad the terrible nature. And he could not -- he suffered a lot with me when he used to come to\nvisit us and see her attitude, it bothered him. You could see on his face that it hurts him. And\nthen he used maybe to tell his girlfriend, and she used to tell her sister, and it was even worst,\nbecause she used to tell her, stop that, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very -- people see, people pay\nattention to it, stop that, change a little bit your attitude. So she -- instead to get better, she\nalways used to get worse after.",
        "A: Terrible. So many people in two rooms, and my stepbrother was very good friends with me\nand I think this was the main reason that she was afraid maybe someday he will marry me. He\nwas about to finish engineering and he was hired by the Germans as -- in the electra -- in -- in the\nfield of electricity, I don\u2019t know exactly what he did there.

So they were more safe than\nin the city. So a lot of relatives came to visit them and it was impossible already to live in the\nhouse, too.",

And he tried to get through to us,\nand my father\u2019s accept to come to their village to enter the forest. And my father said nothing\ndoing. It will be with everybody it will be with me. He made the effort maybe two or three times.\nHe didn\u2019t help him, until the real section came up, and it was too late. On the shein, on the permit\nfor my stepbrother that worked in the -- in the military barracks -- military bases, we could\nsurvive. In other words, the whole action was on our street. And they went from door to door, [Il\nnever forget, May eight, it\u2019s unbelievable, it was snowing.

There 1s people too.\nNothing to eat. Nothing doing, I\u2019m not escaping, I\u2019m not hiding my head. Fine. I was -- I was\nunder his command. We were re -- we respected our parents very highly. So before he -- so he\nsaid he had a dream that Ill remain, but I'll be leaving the town, the -- that Pl -- Pll go through\nthe section with not being hurt, they won\u2019t kill me. He doesn\u2019t know what will happen to him,\nbut he knows that I?ll remain. Then, leave the stories already for later, not for now. There\u2019s no\ntime. And sure enough, on this w -- the Germans went in barefoot, in the snow in my nightgown\nthey took me to the -- to this section. And it went -- my stepmother\u2019s mother and her sister, one\nof her sisters, Fanny, and the guy sh -- did -- the German was standing and we didn\u2019t know left is\nto le -- to leave or right is to leave, but right by the older woman that was there, mother was\nalready older. So he put his hand, you know, like cut. We four went to the left, they went to the\nright. Later on we found out that we remained and they went -- and they were killed. And this\nwas pretty long, nobody knew when and what and how. This was pretty long until they send us\nthe [indecipherable] ghetto, because they took out plenty of people there, and you could go --\nthey didn\u2019t assigned you, you have to go to this house, to this house. Whatever you grabbed,\nwhich house you grabbed when they brought you on their -- on their security, on German\nsecurity to the ghetto, you knew already that you are lost, that you cannot go out from here, that\nthe ghetto 1s already a closed one, that you have a curfew. And we went out to a house -- into a\nhouse.",
        "A: Father was with me. My father and me. My father died in the woods. He was killed in the\nwoods.",
        "A: And next day we had to go already to -- it was organized about the work. What shall I tell\nyou, there was five, six families in that -- in a room. You practically slept to -- one on top of the\nother, such a narrow -- whatever you -- it was in the house cause those people, they took out\nfrom the houses. How many of them were dead, I don\u2019t know. I know that day it was killed five\nand a half thousand people in that -- in that day.",
        "A: From the morning [indecipherable] we were -- had to get up in the morning and somebody\nwas waiting outside for us in a certain -- in the beginning when Lida was ruined and the Germans\ncame, we were cleaning the -- the bricks, you know, that -- the houses that was ruined, to clean\nup the bricks and make the property, clean up the properties. It was not easy work. Sunday\nmorning the Germans were playing with the -- with us a game, let the big dogs -- I worked just\nacross the -- their -- their residence. They used to let the dogs down, make a game with us, and\nthe dog used to tear you in pieces. And there were like wooden, you know, like trays that you put\nthe bricks, and they told you not to [indecipherable] bricks, to slap -- they told you to put -- that\nyou should really get a backache, or break your neck or break your head. So this -- two of you\ncou -- could only sneak in when they didn\u2019t look at you. That was my first job. And the worst\nthing was Sundays, when they used to eat their fat and nice breakfast, and then go for a walk, but\ntheir -- their dogs ate better than we ate [indecipherable] the whole time that they were there.",
        "A: We used -- we -- we used to go to work, you know, it\u2019s [indecipherable] when you -- we\nknew some -- you gave away everything from yourself, the money and everything, th -- and the\npeasants that knew you used to sneak in, that you bought from them all of your life, eggs, or milk\nor this or that. They used to pity you in the beginning and they give you and then they made\ngood business too. If you had money they sold to you, but not always you could buy. Ifa\nGerman used to catch you and he was in a bad mood, you didn\u2019t want to. So he was a --",
        "A: No, I\u2019m talking about even before the ghetto got closed.",
        "A: In the ghetto there was certain things that you could bring in, not too much, and listen, Jews\nare always very smart people, they always knew how to get along.",
        "A: Yeah, I have a lot of friend with -- we survived together, yeah, in that time after wa -- after\nthe -- I mean, the action. Sure I lost quite a few friends, this -- this was -- and then in this ghetto\nmy husband came one time. Said to my father, \u201cYou see, I told you what will happen. I warned\nyou, I begged you. You didn\u2019t have to go through that. The woods are full of trees and the trees\nare covering us. Here, no matter how you walk out, they\u2019Il see you.\u201d And I was upset about it\nbecause the reason that I worked in gardens of one of the Polacks -- lot of people, you know,\nwere used -- they -- they used to plant and we had to clean it and watch it and water it and there\nwas big fields of -- of -- of gardens. In the fee -- and it was so hot in the summer, and the\nGerman was standing over you and you couldn\u2019t -- you know, you really couldn\u2019t not work, or\nplay that you are sick, or you don\u2019t feel good. What -- what more you complain, the s -- more\nyou got over your head. Somehow my stepmother was very good fren -- friends with the owner\nof this -- of this gardens that he was in charge of them. I don\u2019t know if it was his or if he was\nonly in charge with the -- th-the Germans made him 1n charge of it. But he lived there, and as\nsoon you know, they produced to make [indecipherable] tomorrow was a -- a section. To-\nTomorrow it will be something happen. I pass by I heard somebody say tomorrow something\nwill happen this guy, this guy. And that\u2019s how in the ghetto started to where the talking and what\nto -- what we will do, where will we hide, and what -- how and what. At night still were young,\nwe used to -- too long we couldn\u2019t go, and too far we couldn\u2019t go, but next door we used to\n[indecipherable] and come to one backyard all together and sing fa -- Hebrew songs and -- and\ntell stories and what will happen, how come that we\u2019ll have a terrible youth. And you know, and\ngo home, next day you had to go to work. So I remember one fact, that right after this action in\nma -- in May eight, and they told us that the next day we have to go to work and we should all\nget together in this and this point. I had a watch. I wanted to check the time I shouldn\u2019t be too\nlate because I was afraid. You had so much fear in yourself, you weren\u2019t -- when he didn\u2019t mean\nto do nothing to you but to look. Not so much I -- even from the Germans, like from the Polacks\nthat the pol -- the police that helped them out. And I -- I ask somebody what time 1s this, and a\nPolish guy came over to me and he said the time, and I said thank you, and we went into the\nhouse. Didn\u2019t take an hour, he comes in with a German. He says, \u201cWhere is the girl that asked\nme what time it is?\u201d My father ra -- pushed me already away out to the room, complete to\nanother room where other people were. And he showed him, he said this one, this one. He said\nno. I want to see the girl that asked me the time. So my father got very nervous and he started\nalready, he said, \u201cKill me. What do you want to do to her? Kill her? Kill me, \u2019'm old man.\u201d Four\n-- he was maybe 46 years there. Kill me. Said, \u201cNo, PII tell you what, I won\u2019t do nothing to you.\nPll -- 11 murder you, but after you give me your -- your dau -- what connection do you have?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t want to tell him that I\u2019m his daughter. Anyway, I saw it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very crucial, I came\nout. I came out and he said -- \u201cI didn\u2019t do nothing,\u201d I said, \u201cI just ask you what time because I\nwanted to be on time tomorrow morning.\u201d It was just a stupid game that he wanted to scare the\nwhole house and he want to make a -- a game of it. Turned around, took away my watch and\nwent out. What di -- what did I do? But just stupid game. You know, anything to show the\nauthorities that they -- they-they are the big shots. And this wasn\u2019t the lesson for my father\neither, because that time I started to bother him [indecipherable] look, we went through, we\ncould have waited. Tuvya asked us, he begged us, who else ha -- who else has in the whole\nghetto such a privilege to go out of the ghetto one of the first ones because people would love it,\nbut they didn\u2019t know how and what. What Daddy said, Daddy said. And after the action this was\n[indecipherable] I\u2019ll never forget. I came for my girlfriend, in fact, she was killed wi -- in the\nwoods, from the white Polacks. Her sister and brother-in-law still in Israel, and the whole family\nwas saved by my husband. And we were sitting in their backyard, singing, you know, songs from\n-- from -- from I don\u2019t know, maybe 60 - 70 years ago they used to sing that in -- in the Jewish\ntradition. And I came home, and I said -- and I [indecipherable] crawl to my bed. It was very\ncrowded to pass b-by to find your bed, you know, but was cold and chilly. So I took my\ngirlfriend\u2019s jacket, I put the -- threw it on top of me. A blazer. Came home and I lay down in bed,\ntook off the jacket, took off my clothes, lay down [indecipherable] ready to work.\n[indecipherable] I wasn\u2019t working all right. [indecipherable] had, you know, we had -- didn\u2019t\nhave any peace in the house, she always why didn\u2019t you do that. Why didn\u2019t you cook, why\ndidn\u2019t you bring, why didn\u2019t you that? Til one day, I\u2019m going -- I\u2019Il bad -- back to this story with\nma -- with the jacket, because that was the night that we left the ghetto. But what I want to tell\nyou from my stepmother and I said, in the beginning I didn\u2019t want to confess to. [indecipherable]\nI will tell it. Let it be on record, let people know that when you are making a hole for somebody,\nyou are the first one to fall. She said to me -- I come to work in the fields and the one that I told\nyou was in charge of me, says to me, \u201cToday you\u2019ll work later.\u201d I said, \u201cHow can I work later,\nhow can I get to the ghetto later? After six o\u2019clock, if I\u2019ll be met by -- by the Germans and by the\npolice, I\u2019ll be killed.\u201d We have no excuse, they kill you on the spot. That was a [indecipherable]\nand now order [indecipherable]. Said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you but I need you for work.\u201d\nWhat can I do? Helpless. My stepmother sometimes didn\u2019t come home when she heard rumors\nthat something\u2019s going to happen the ha -- ghetto, she used to hide herself there on the roof. He\nused to hide her. Her and another few. Came six o\u2019clock he says to me, \u201cGo home.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\ntold me to stay. I have nothing to lose already, cause after six I won\u2019t go nowhere.\u201d He said, \u201cGo,\ngo with the group, return to the ghetto in time.\u201d Passed a few weeks, and he starts telling me a\nstory, that my stepmother paid with the money from five ruble gold, of my father\u2019s money to\nkeep me later in order he should send me home and I should be killed by the Germans. So what\nfor you needed the Germans that your own people could kill you. And I -- I kept it a secret for a\nlong, long time. And he said to me, \u201cYou know, even not being Jewish, I had no conscious,\nbecause you were so innocent, I couldn\u2019t do it. I took the money from her, but was for money\nthey were [indecipherable]. But I told her P\u2019ll do some other time, not today.\u201d And I kept it a\nsecret for a long time, I didn\u2019t tell no one. First well I thought nobody will believe me. In this\ntime of struggle for your life, of survival, you are able take my father\u2019s money and to kill me? I -",
        "A: Yes. That night with -- I came home with my friend\u2019s blazer. I don\u2019t recall actual night. And I\nwent to sleep, and all of a sudden I hear somebody\u2019s touching me. I woke up, I thought my father\nmaybe he\u2019s not feeling well. He says, \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I decided to leave immediately, get\ndressed. If you -- my eyes [indecipherable] Daddy, takes time to get ready, Daddy, let me put on\nmy shoes. I don\u2019t want to wait [indecipherable] can change my mind. Now, right now. And we\nwere the first ones, me, my stepmother, my stepbrother and my father, to crawl out from the\nGlost ghetto.

Then he met -- when he met us, he brought us to\nsomebody that he knew for awhile, to rest up and a few hours later, these two brothers were\nwaiting deeper in the woods for us, and then I came, and there were 17 people of the family and\nwith us it was 21.

And he took us to this peasant and this peasant came to my father to tell him.\nBecause he used to come very often to bring us something, you know, like a piece of bread, or\nsome milk, or some something. Some cheese. So he said Tuvya was here, he asked me to go and\nto tell you again and again.

The\nwhole young people there were sitting, and just like I left everything behind me. I wa -- I didn\u2019t\nhave a feeling of sorry, but I -- I said to myself, why couldn\u2019t I share with them and tell them?\nFirst of all, I didn\u2019t know, because I didn\u2019t know until I didn\u2019t come home. And I didn\u2019t go into\nbed, my father came to me, because he was afraid maybe next bed, maybe I\u2019Il te-tell somebody\nsomething. You know? But I had a picture, oh they remained there, they\u2019Il have to go to work\ntomorrow. They\u2019|l have Sunday the same show with the dogs. They\u2019 ll have this, they\u2019 ll have\nthat. I was too young to have special feelings. But I said oh, I'll miss that sitting in the backyard\nand not seeing my friends. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going, I\u2019m going to the wolves, I\u2019m going to\nthe bears, I\u2019m going to the -- to the woods without nothing. It\u2019s very har -- 1t was very hard to\nturn into a animal, being a human being. In that time we were animals, but we were -- we had\nfreedom. We could move. Not in daytime, but at night time. And that\u2019s how the leadership of my\nhusband went. My husband was [indecipherable] then we were constantly together. He was with\nhis girlfriend and I was with my family, but this was counted as we lived in one bunker, you\nknow, we made one -- one place of -- of living together. And he saw that -- how much suffering\nI\u2019m [indecipherable] how alone I am in this world. And he saw that my father wants to help me\nand he can, but he was -- he was threatened that she\u2019l leave him [indecipherable] do that. So he -\n- and so he tried, he tried to supply me boots, he tried to supply me warm clothes. He tried to\nalways when he went out to bring something more for me. He told me always not to take so\nmuch to heart, things will change, everything will pass.",
        "A: The first place was very close, I don\u2019t remember exactly, but it was very -- it wasn\u2019t\norganized. And that people were already -- the one, the family people that were there, they -- and\nthe -- and the -- there were family people and there were neighbors next village from them, that\nthey were relatives of m -- of my brother-in-law, that he got involved with one of their daughters,\nso he took out the parents, and he took out the sisters and the brothers. All together with us it was\n21 people. But the other 17 people started already, especially the older people. What are you\ngoing to do, how will you feed them, at least we are 17 people, here four more mouths, four\nmore this. But my husband always find a way. He always said to [indecipherable] \u201cIll find a\nway to -- to feed them, Ill find a way to supply them. Don\u2019t you worry about. It\u2019s more Jews,\nit\u2019s better.\u201d And slowly, slowly he started with his love and he wants to save Jews from the\nghetto. He doesn\u2019t care how, he doesn\u2019t care what people will say, he doesn\u2019t care if they\u2019 Il be\nsatisfied with it. He must save Jews from -- and he was asked the question, what would you\nrather do? Kill 10 Germans or save one Jew? And very openly and with a lot of dignity he said,\n\u201cSave one Jew.\u201d",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: When I came to the woods, there was no group, there was a family, members of the family,\nthere was -- all related to each other. And they were in -- hesitating if to accept new people.\nBecause like I had mentioned before, there was a question of supporting them, there was a\nquestion of feeding them, and this wasn\u2019t the easy thing, because they had nothing with -- a-and\nthey were empty handed. The whole luck of it was that they were raised -- the Bielskys were\nraised in villages, in hills, in woods, wi -- and trees were their friends. So they weren\u2019t afraid to\nknock in a peasant\u2019s window. They weren\u2019t afraid if -- to knock in -- and they had s -- their\nstories with the peasant. For instance my husband -- where they -- wher -- f-first of all where\nthey -- where they came during the day, they didn\u2019t sleep the night. Or they slept, they didn\u2019t --\nthey weren\u2019t during the day. They couldn\u2019t stay because they were afraid for their own shadow,\nand we didn\u2019t have any trust. It\u2019s not [indecipherable] determines. That was, at that time we were\n-- we organized, it was White Russia. So you had the wh -- white Polacks, the white Russian.\nThen you had the Polacks that they wanted to be very friendly with the Germans and they helped\nthem a lot. So to give out a Jew, it was just a cinch. It was a -- a -- a big deal. And they were\nknow in there, in their facilities where they lived. But they had a -- their father had the -- a mill. I\npersonally did not know my in-laws. When I got to know them, they weren\u2019t alive already. Ah,\nwhen I could get to know them, they weren\u2019t alive already. They were taken away to\n[indecipherable] ghetto and were killed. So I knew only the one that they were in the ghettos --\nthey -- they were in the woods with us, I\u2019m sorry. And for instance, my husband had a friend --\nfirst of all, my husband was a military man. He was in the Polish army for two years and he was\na very good soldier and he had right away a [indecipherable] of certain things that he did better\nthan others. He was very good in languages. First of all, he was g -- he grew up between\nGentiles. They had the business, they had mills. They had t-to -- to grind th-their grains, they had\nto -- to do a lot of things that they -- you know, there was very little Jewish temples, if they had\nto go to temple for a holiday, they had to walk about two, three kilometers. They didn\u2019t have this\nin their village. They were the only Jewish family in their village. But they had good things too\ndone, and certain people that they want to remember, and th-the -- they pay -- they pay them a\ngood price later on. Meaning what? Let\u2019s say there was a neighbor, my husband\u2019s friend that\ncame to the mill for a certain thing. I don\u2019t remember what he came for but was -- I really -- I\nwasn\u2019t born there, I don\u2019t know the -- the -- all the obstacles there, but that\u2019s what I heard and\nread fa -- about my husband. So he came there, and there was a he -- they were not poor people\neither, the -- the neighbors, the -- the man that I\u2019m telling you the story about. And there was a\nmill by [indecipherable] not far from each other, and there was a big river. This guy was 12 or 13\nyears old and he went to the river, he jumped, and he drowned. My husband was right near the\nriver and he saw that. He jumped in his clothes and he saved him. His parents never could forget\nthat. In the time of the war, when he find out that he is somewhere in the neighborhood, he paid\nhim a visit. But he didn\u2019t know even which house is his. This was so many years ago.\nAccidentally he knocked in the house of his parents, and he ask him about Andre. And his father\nsays -- he recognized him immediately, he said, \u201cYou are -- God brought you here, you are my\nson\u2019s savior. You saved his life. He is not living with me, but right here and here he is living, go\nknock in his door, he\u2019|l be very happy to see you.\u201d And sure enough he did it, and as he knocked\nin the door, he said to him, \u201cIt\u2019s a very familiar voice, but I don\u2019t know the name, I don\u2019t\nremember you.\u201d He says, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember how you drowned and I saved you?\u201d \u201cOh my\nGod,\u201d he said, \u201cBielsky, what are you doing? I thought you are long time not between the\nliving.\u201d Took him in, he stationed him, he gave him to eat. There was days that th-they were\nhungry. They couldn\u2019t find the -- a house to go in or they couldn\u2019t, or there was Germans, or\nthere were Poles, or they -- the owner didn\u2019t let them in because he was afraid for him his ho --\nhis lo -- own life. But a lot of risked their own life. And he was very happy with him, and he\nsaid, \u201cLook, I\u2019m married, I have a family. Do me a favor, let me tell my wife that you are one\nfrom the Polacks that escaped from the army and you are trying to hide, and you are not Jewish.\u201d\nAt the moment my husband said to him, \u201cOkay, tell her what you want.\u201d But as the day passed\nand he rested up, and he came to his senses, he said, \u201c\u201cWhy should you lie to your wife? Did I lie\nto my conscious by saving you? I want to tell her the truth.\u201d And sure enough, she reacted\nbeautifully, according to the story from my husband. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are, you are\na human being, and Ill do anything and everything.\u201d But for the neighbors she tried to play the\nsame game. And at the same night, her sister-in-law came to visit them, she asks them -- they\nnamed him right away a different name, my husband, and she said, \u201cWho is this guest in your\nhouse?\u201d And she said her name was Mary, and she says, \u201cMary,\u201d to her sister-in-law, \u201coh, we\nhave a Polish guy that escaped from the army and he\u2019s hiding.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cyou know what?\nI want them all in my house next week. Ill make a little party and we\u2019ll have a good time. Bring\nyour guest along with you.\u201d Course for some reason, I don\u2019t know if they knew or they didn\u2019t\nknow, but they didn\u2019t go. Husband and wife didn\u2019t go, and my husband went to her, and he\nknocks in the door and walks in, and the table\u2019s all set, and five heavy-set Germans are sitting\nand drinking and eating. She didn\u2019t lose her head -- they ask right away who are you. She didn\u2019t\nlose her head and she says to them, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a friend. That\u2019s my sister-in-law\u2019s friend that he\u2019s\nworking for us, blah, blah, blah, whole story. They shook hands with him, he was shivering. He\nsaid that he da -- he was telling me always that he does not know how the table didn\u2019t turn over\nfrom his knees shaking. And he said -- and he drank, and he was afra -- afraid to drink too much,\nmaybe he\u2019ll say something, you know, you are not responsible for after awhile. So he said, \u201cYou\nknow what, I cannot leave -- I have to go to my work, I have to go to my job. I cannot stay too\nlong.\u201d And they ask -- so he ask them, he wanted to know what\u2019s going on in the world. He said,\n\u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s our situation by the way? How do we fight?\u201d \u201cOh, we are so close to Moscow.\u201d We are\nso close to here, we are so close to there. It won\u2019t take no time and we\u2019ll be the winners of the\nworld. Shook hands with them nicely, said goodnight and disappeared. He ran so fast -- it was a\ncold night -- he ran so fast that he thought in his mind it was a fantasy or a thought, I don\u2019t know\nhow to describe that, that somebody\u2019s running. He\u2019s hurt, he didn\u2019t realize that ha -- he\u2019s hurt,\nhe\u2019s speeding so fast that he thought that somebody\u2019s behind him running after him until he fell\ninto the snow, to the deep snow. And in the deep snow, saw that it\u2019s very cold, he\u2019ll freeze to\ndeath, he\u2019ll remain here. He got up, he shlepped through to some other house where they let him\nin and -- and at that time it was empty -- still empty handed. But this guy, I think -- I think, I\u2019m\nnot sure, gave him the first gun, or the first rifle, or the si -- fi -- or showed him a place where he\ncould get. But this was the first guy that filled his hands up that he should -- shouldn\u2019t be empty\nhanded.",

We have to try to\nbring people from -- from the ghettos. And he wrote a letter to his cousin, it was still in a -- in\n[indecipherable] in Novagudek ghetto and he told him, organize as much as you can, because\nthey had another pes -- farmer that spoke beautiful Jewish, you would never sa -- say that he\u2019s a\nGentile.

I don\u2019t\nknow how -- how to -- to calculate that. But he had the whole information from the\n[indecipherable] ghetto and he was the one to send constantly with messages to the ghetto and\nget to the people and give them the letters. The first letter he sent to his cousin, a Bielsky, too.\nHis name was Yehuda Bielsky. And he wrote him, for your sake, \u201cFor my sake, for the sake for\nthe Jewish nation, please organize and get out of the ghetto. We had -- the roots are wide, the\nforests are deep. We\u2019ll survive, if not all of us, some of us. In ghetto you have no chance.\u201d With\nthis message, after awhile, came seven young boys.

And they sat down, seven boys and I think -- and I\u2019m\nvery sure that I don\u2019t remember exactly if two wives came with them, or they came a short time\nafter that. And they came to the woods. And then, in between them, they made a meeting and\nthey said, \u201c\u201cTuvya, you are the oldest from all of us,\u201d -- he was at that time in the early 30\u2019s, \u201cand\nyou had military experience, you were in the army, you know what discipline 1s. We want you to\nlead the group.\u201d So he answered them, \u201cIf you listen to me, and you\u2019ll obey my orders, [Il do it.\nIf not, take somebody else.\u201d So in one voice, they all said, \u201cWe\u2019ll agree, we\u2019ll do whatever you\nsay.\u201d When he was in the army he had a very -- first of all, before the army, when he was a\nyoung guy yet, he was always interested in Zionism.

But his parents -- one brother was already in the States and he -- his -- the\ncondition, the family conditions were so poor that he had no conscious to leave, a -- mommy say\n-- and -- and his mother said to him, you want to go to Israel, fine, take your brothers and sisters\nand go because we won\u2019t manage -- we won\u2019t be able to manage. So he was, you know, there\nwas all kind of parties in Europe, so he belonged to a party, it was a chalutz, he used to go out for\n-- for hard work, for building, for -- for -- for -- for other work, ha -- this was a -- he bel -- he\nbelonged to a party chalutz.
