        "A: May 11, 1930.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family. Your parents\u2019 names?",

        "Q: And where were they born?",
        "A: My mother was born in Berlin, Germany and my father was born in someplace near Krakow,\nPoland. I believe at that time it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.",
        "Q: And how did they meet?",
        "A: Apparently his parents and him moved to Vienna and my mother and her parents apparently\nmoved to Vienna. And they both worked during the day. It was so modern. They took French\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nclass at night time. That used to be the way to meet people, study French conversation. And they\nmet there as a result. In Vienna.",
        "Q: Do you know when they were born?",
        "A: Yeah, but not off hand. My father was born November 14th, 1898. My mother was born May\nthe seventh of 1905.",
        "Q: Tell me again when your father was born.",
        "A: 1898.",
        "Q: 1898. Yes, thank you. Did you have any brothers or sisters?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You were an only child?",
        "A: I\u2019m an only child.",
        "Q: OK. What kind of work did your father do?",
        "A: Well in Austria, he had a limited education. And he was a support of a large family. And he\nwas working. When I was born he was in Klagenfurt working as a window dresser for the only\ndepartment store in town. My mother had been sent to be a, to learn how to become a master\nmilliner and she was an apprentice for I believe seven years. They had the guild system in\nAustria and she was a master milliner. And as a result she had a store where she made hats and\nhad four apprentices working for her. Meanwhile, they lived in a flat. We lived on the second\nstory and they always had every year, a different girl, peasant girl would come from Yugoslavia,\nCzechoslovakia, some such place, for a one year contract and up, upstairs, there was another\nfamily and Herbert was a little boy who played with me. He was a year younger than me and if\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nwe wanted to play we would push the broom on the ceiling or the floor as to whether or not we\nwanted to play.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about the neighborhood where your apartment was. Was it a \u2014",
        "A: I haven\u2019t got the faintest clue. It had a yard and it had a big, big peach tree which Herbert and\nI one day attacked and ate a great deal of peaches when they were not ripe. And were sick for\ndays and got very much punished. It had a very nice yard that we could use to our heart\u2019s\ncontent. And I don\u2019t know goose, by the name of Pauline. And we would sit on a bench. It was\nvery pleasant. Lots of plants and trees and things around there.",
        "Q: Do you know if it was a Jewish neighborhood or was it a mixed neighborhood or you don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "A: I have no idea. It couldn\u2019t have been a Jewish neighborhood. My mother wouldn\u2019t have\nwanted that. And certainly, Herbert certainly wasn\u2019t. And as far as I know, I was the only Jewish\nchild in the entire school.",
        "Q: Tell me about your school.",
        "A: Oh. I don\u2019t know. One thinks one knows things but one doesn\u2019t necessarily know. One\ndoesn\u2019t know what it is that one remembers or what one thinks one remembers. I remember\nbeing taught by nuns. I have no idea whether the public schools in Klagenfurt were run by nuns\nor whether that was a Catholic school. My mother liked to deny her Jewishness and tried to tell\nme that her parents, her mother Julie Hotzel was Catholic. But I\u2019m not too sure about that. I sort\nof doubt it. But anyhow, I went to school and I was the only Jewish child there. My father\ninsisted that I not attend class during Catholic training. As a result I recall spending my time out\nin the school yard, even in the fall and the winter for the hour that they had the daily religious\ntraining.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nThe nuns didn\u2019t like me and they thought that I was slow witted and insisted that I be trained to\nlearn how to read and how to do math. I was very slow and I seem to recall sitting in front of the\nroom in disgrace all the time.",
        "Q: It sounds like maybe your house was obviously not a religious home. In no way observant?",
        "A: Oh my father was very observant. Oh yes he was conservative. And oh no, he was \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember any holidays you observed?",
        "A: Oh yeah, absolutely. I can still rattle off Manishstana Chalala Chased [ph]. Of course. And\nhe convinced my mother to light the Shabbos candles and she would cook carp and all the\nspecial foods and all that, yes. Yes, my father was very tolerant of this but he prayed daily and \u2014",
        "Q: Did you belong to a synagogue?",
        "A: Excuse me.",
        "Q: Did the family belong to a synagogue?",
        "A: I have no idea what they did. I think everybody had to. I don\u2019t think in Austria you had any\nchoice.",
        "Q: Do you remember going to the synagogue?",
        "A: As a small child?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t have any recollection. I don\u2019t have many recollections because let\u2019s see we left\nwhen I was eight years old. And it was quite traumatic. And \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "Q: We\u2019ll talk about that.",
        "A: It wiped out a lot of memories I would otherwise have perhaps.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure. I just want to talk a little bit about your life before 1938, a little more. Did you have\nany Jewish friends in the neighborhood or \u2014",
        "A: No, no. I don\u2019t recall having had any other friend other than Herbert upstairs and his baby\nsitter or whatever you call them, nursemaid, housekeeper and my \u2014 we would go out together\nlike going skating and what not. And \u2014\nDaughter: How about Freddy?",
        "A: Oh no those were relatives. They frequently came to see us. My father\u2019s family frequently\ncame to see us, from, I don\u2019t know from where they were. I don\u2019t know whether they were in\nKlagenfurt or whether they were in Vienna or where they were. But my favorite cousin Vera\nwas very glamourous, very beautiful. A few years older than me. And my father had a sister by\nthe name of Stella and she \u2014 they were all in Vienna I guess. The time I saw them frequently was\nafter we had to move to Vienna. Other than that I, we got photographs of them visiting us 1n our\nplace in Klagenfurt.",
        "Q: What about your mother\u2019s family?",
        "A: Well my mother\u2019s parents were retired. I have no idea what they did before. But they moved\nto Klagenfurt to be near my mother and me. And every day when I went to school, my father\nwould take me, walk me to school. I would run after him because he walked so fast and my\ngrandfather, my mother\u2019s father, Otto Schwartz would pick me up after school. And take me\neither to the candy store to get one piece of candy or else to the coffee houses where he would sit\nand sip coffee and read international newspapers. Then they would take me to the little shop that\nthey had. It was no larger than this room here. And they had imported fabrics, beautiful fabrics\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nfrom Scotland or what not. Wools for hand tailoring suits. Julie, his wife, would run the shop. He\nsat up front, outside, rolling cigarettes and translating German into Esperanto.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home? German?",
        "A: Yeah, that was the only language.",
        "Q: Not Yiddish at all?",
        "A: Never. Yiddish was basically done by southern Europeans, people who could speak German\nor spoke German. They were rather prejudiced against Yiddish. Ok? No one ever spoke\nYiddish. It was looked down upon.",
        "Q: So I know you left when you were very young, but do you have any memories that you can\nrecall about when things started to get a little difficult. This is before you left.",
        "A: Before, yeah, ok. There we were one day, I\u2019ve told this to my daughter several times. One\nday suddenly, there were troops in Klagenfurt. And I went to school and they sang Deutschland,\nDeutschland uber Alles [ph] and the miracle was that everybody in the class knew all the words\nand how to sing it. And then they were doing Heil Hitler. And they all knew how to do these\nthings. It was very \u2014 day after Anschluss. Annexation in English. And I recall one of my friends\nin class, Herta, she kept raising her hand cause she wanted to go to the bathroom and the teacher\nthought she was saying Heil Hitler too much and wouldn\u2019t let her go. And next thing you know\nshe evacuated (laughs) right there in class and we all laughed and the nun was very, very angry\nat us. (laughs) Ok.",
        "Q: Had you heard of a man named Hitler by that time?",
        "A: Now wait a minute. I\u2019m getting to that. And when I went home, when I got home, the\nbabysitter, housekeeper, whatever she was, took me downtown. And there was this man. This 1s\nmy recollection. There was this man with a funny hairdo and funny moustache and a uniform\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nand he was screaming and shouting and everybody was Heil Hitler-ing. The next day or the\nsame day, almost immediately, Herbert came to see me and said his mother said we could no\nlonger play together. He was forbidden to talk to me. The school told me, I could no longer go to\nschool there. Dr. Strife the pediatrician said he could no longer treat us. And then a short while\nafter that, an edict came that everybody who was Jewish had to resume or acquire a Jewish or\nHebrew name and wear a yellow star. And everyone had to leave and move to the first section,\nAsta Bitzerk [ph] of Vienna. Find relatives or anything to go there and so we moved into the\nsmall flat of my father\u2019s father, Shmeil Laufer was his name. I think he went by Samuel. But his\nname was Shmeil. His wife had died a number of years earlier, Esther. She had died earlier. And\neverybody descended on this little apartment. It was on one of the upper floors. Flats they called\nthem in those days.",
        "Q: Let me back up a little bit. The young boy came and said he couldn\u2019t play with you and the\npediatrician said \u2014",
        "A: Everybody said they couldn\u2019t deal with us.",
        "Q: You were young. Do you remember how you felt as a young child, a young girl. Was it\nupsetting? Do you remember being very upset, frightened?",
        "A: I, just total confusion. That\u2019s what, I don\u2019t really recall other than total confusion like what in\nGod\u2019s name is happening.",
        "Q: And when the troops came into your school, what was that like?",
        "A: No, no troops came to our school.",
        "Q: I thought you said soldiers came to the school.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: No we went. My babysitter or whatever, took me downtown after school and I think it was\nafter school. Anyhow it was in the afternoon and although it doesn\u2019t make sense. But anyhow\nshe took me into town.",
        "Q: And when you saw those troops, what did that mean to you as a child?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall. I don\u2019t\u2019 recall. It wasn\u2019t anything you would see in a, very half rural town you\nknow. It was a very quiet town. You wouldn\u2019t have seen such a thing as troops.",
        "Q: How far away from Vienna was this?",
        "A: Six hours by slow train.",
        "Q: Six hours. Was it in the countryside?",
        "A: Klagenfurt was the capital of Corinthia in the Roman empire. (laughs) Ok. Six hours by slow\ntrain. When we visited Austria many years later, it was still six hours by slow train. (laughs) But\nwhen she was, when my daughter was three years old, when you would go to India.\nDaughter: maybe five or six.",
        "A: It was still six hours by train.",
        "Q: Oh so now you\u2019ve moved. How did it feel as a young child to have to leave your home and\nmove out \u2014",
        "A: [have no recollection. I have no recollection and my next recollection is being in the small\nstuffy apartment with all of these many relatives. My mother was desperate. She finally oh, my\nmother\u2019s story. My mother was a master milliner and had a very successful store as a milliner.\nAnd everyone, all the ladies wore hats all the time in public at that time. So that was very\nsuccessful. Several years earlier she had fired Dora Taya [ph], one of her apprentices because\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nshe was stealing from customers and from the store. And after Anschluss Dora Taya came with\nan SS officer and said for my mother to get out. This now belongs to Dora Taya. No, don\u2019t take\nanything with you. Just go. My mother\u2019s brother, Richard Schwartz, meanwhile had married a\nvery beautiful Catholic girl by the name of Annie. Very stylish, very beautiful, very tall. She\nadvised him to take all the money out of the bank. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen and\nthey put it in, they put it in a paper bag and she said she accidentally threw it in the trash. They\nspent two days at the city dump looking for the money. Of course they never found her and of\ncourse she was seen next with an SS officer as well. I don\u2019t know what happened to Richard or\nmy grandparents at that point, my mother\u2019s family. Until later. I never saw, I know I never saw\nthem again.\nAnd so we moved to Vienna with all the other relatives on my father\u2019s side. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you take anything special with you?",
        "A: Oh my mother had, was so happy. She had finally gotten ranbough. She called. It was all\nthe furniture was inlaid and had round corners and she was so thrilled with it. She finally had it\nand of course she couldn\u2019t take that. So I don\u2019t\u2019 know how she did it but in this very small\napartment upstairs in Vienna she had brought the dresser, the dresser with a tall mirror and the\nvanity, whatever you call it. It was not a dresser. It was a vanity with a tall mirror. And every\nday she would dust it and she would be so sad because she had left the rest of the bedroom\nfurniture there. And then being her and dusting every day, one day, it was Saturday, she dusted\nthe vanity. And shook the dust cloth out the window to the horror of from the family because it\nwas the Sabbath. You don\u2019t dust on the Sabbath, ok. Very vivid recollection of her daily\nstroking of the vanity.",
        "Q: How long were you there in that apartment?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. Not long.",
        "Q: A few months.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: We had to have, we had black curtains in front of our windows so it couldn\u2019t\u2019 be seen from\nthe street. That people were there. And one day let me, every once in a while we would speak\nout and they would get very angry at me for trying to peak out the corner and see what was going\non. And I'd see all these armed boys and marching around.",
        "Q: Was that scary?",
        "A: One day there had been an impromptu synagogue next door, downstairs and that was burned\ndown. And thank goodness they put the fire out. They had some kind of impromptu schooling\nas well. And the teachers remarked how, what a good student I was and how brilliant I was.\nAnd I don\u2019t\u2019 know how I suddenly within days became from the village idiot (laughs) to being\nbrilliant, but whatever. Miraculously I suddenly became very intelligent.\nSo there was an impromptu school but it was very crowded there and there was one day it was\nespecially bad. And some SA, SA were the younger fellows, SS were the storm troops. And the\nSA were like scouts, first. They marched also with them and they were of course, being young\nboys, were the most vicious. They came upstairs one day and they were looking for things.\nUnfortunately nobody had anything but they threw some furniture out the window. But then they\nleft. I recall one of them actually looked at me and smiled. I was a little kid, eight years old. I\nhad no idea with a big white bow in my hair.\nAnd after that my father decided we were leaving. And \u2014",
        "Q: Up to that point, did your parents sit down with you and explain to you what was happening?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember asking them.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. My mother was always in danger of being half hysterical. I have no idea.",
        "Q: She was always very frightened, your mother?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: About everything, yes. You know, why me, et cetera, et cetera. And my mother was real\nintellectual or whatever.",
        "Q: So did you know what was happening? I mean I know you were young. You were only eight.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know but I have recollections. My mother\u2019s family was, my mother had family in\nVienna who were Christian. And at least they were Christian before the Nazis got hold of them\nand didn\u2019t believe they\u2019re not, their Christianity went sufficient generations back or something.\nAnyhow, I recall going with my father, my mother and me and hiding in doorways, going over to\nthe other section. Taking off the gold, the yellow stars and going in the other section and hiding\nand trying to stay there until the pogroms were over and we could go back home during the day\nor something, and nothing would happen. It, just a recollection of total fright and terror. After a\nwhile the relatives said they couldn\u2019t afford to have us come there anymore of course.",
        "Q: What did wearing a yellow star mean to you?",
        "A: that nobody could tell who was a Jew and who wasn\u2019t unless they had a yellow star. You\ncouldn\u2019t tell by looking at them, watching them or anything else.",
        "Q: Were you upset to have to wear one?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall. Absolutely don\u2019t recall. Anyhow, there we were and my father said after this\nhappened, a lot of ways and a lot of broken things. And",
        "Q: This is cause of Kristallnacht.",
        "A: I guess that\u2019s what it was, yeah. He said we\u2019re leaving and he got tickets. Since we had\nalways lived frugally we were different from all other people. We had enough money, although\nmy father was just a window dresser. My mother, everything she had was taken away. We had\nenough money to go. To buy tickets to go to China, which was willing to take anybody.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nAnd they laughed at him. I remember we were sitting around. There was just one candle and all\nof us sitting around and they were laughing at him.",
        "Q: They being your other relatives?",
        "A: His father and all his relatives as to how could we go someplace where it\u2019s so strange and\ndifferent and we don\u2019t know the language and the custom and they got slanted eyes and yellow\nskin and nobody can understand anything they say, even when they speak German, which 1s true.\nYou can\u2019t understand them when they speak English and they\u2019re speaking English. But anyhow,\nthey made complete fun of him and they said these classic words that he\u2019s being very foolish that\ngod will take care of him. they have lived good lives and god will, good God fearing lives and\nthey, God will, God will take care of them in the form of England and the United States.\nAmerica and England would not let anything happen to them. Ok.\nThey laughed at him and said he was foolish and had no skill, no ability. What would he do?\nAnd he said well his wife makes hats. And we would figure it out. Ok. One of his sisters\napparently had a new husband who had more energy than the other people there and she had a\ndaughter or maybe it was his daughter. I believe it was her daughter. And he said they were\nmoving to Sweden and they laughed at him too. What would he do? And he said he was going to\nmake soap. And I remember they laughed at him. they had to hold their mouths so they wouldn\u2019t\nmake so much noise. They were laughing. So everybody already has soap. Why would they\nneed you to make soap? And what do you know about making soap. Anyhow, there was a big\nkettle. And he proceeded to make soap. He did make soap. Understand they did move to Sweden\nand I understand that the daughter became a nurse. I don\u2019t\u2019 know her name. I don\u2019t know their\nmarried name. I have no idea. I don\u2019t know his name, his father\u2019s name.\nAnyhow, my father also had a sister whose name was also Clara and she had, she was I believe\ndivorced or widowed. I think divorced or whatever. Anyhow she did have a husband. Her\ndaughter, Vera, was my favorite cousin. And they of course had no money to go anywhere. So\nwe were going to leave and go to China. My father went to some kind of a building. I don\u2019t know\nwhether it was a court, or whether it was a government exit visa. I don\u2019t\u2019? know what it was.\nAnyhow, we went there and when he got there it had been occupied and there was a commandant\nsitting there. And there was blood on the wall and he could hear men screaming. And it was my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nfather\u2019s turn and he said he went up and said Herr commandant I am a veteran of World War I. I\nfought on behalf of the Austria-Hungarian Empire. I am a poor man. I am a window dresser\nwithout any skills. I have tickets to China. If you have seen the movie, Good Earth you know\nthat they are so poor that they are even eating earth. Undoubtedly we will be killed there or\nstarve to death or they will kill us or we will die as a result of the civil war they\u2019re in. You don\u2019t05:50:52need us and there\u2019s only me and my wife and my daughter. My small daughter.\nAnd we will, have tickets to leave within two weeks. And the man said, let him go. As far as I\nknow, he was the only person who ever talked his way out of a concentration camp. It\u2019s been\nmy inspiration all my life. Speak up. Ok. Speak up and have something worthy to say.\nAs he went out, a man approached him and said do you want tickets to Port of Spain. My father\nsaid what\u2019s that. He said it\u2019s a British crown colony in the Caribbean and my father said , he\nasked what\u2019s that and the man told him it\u2019s a small island opposite Venezuela that\u2019s owned by\nthe British. And that he had gotten tickets where he wanted to go, namely where everybody\nwanted to go, Argentina. And did my father want his tickets to Trinidad. Of course my father\ntook it. I don\u2019t know whether he paid or had the money or whether it was all free in those days.\nYou could only take a hundred marks, shillings, whatever they had, out of the country. So it\ndidn\u2019t make any money, difference how much money you had or what you spend.\nAnyhow, I remember he came back and said we\u2019re going to Trinidad. And he offered his tickets\nto China to the other relatives who just laughed. I don\u2019t know if eventually they used them or\nwhat. I have no idea. I have no recollection or knowledge of what happened to the relatives after\nthat. Other than Clara.\nAnyhow, we went to, we had to go to Amsterdam. I believe we had 67 relatives when we left.\nAnd we went by train to Amsterdam where we would wait until the ship, the Cotica would come\nand take us on to Trinidad.",
        "Q: What was it like for you to leave your extended family, the relatives?",
        "A: I have no idea. I have no idea. A small child excited about leaving. And my mother desperate.\nShe had to leave her vanity and her furniture. That I recall.",
        "Q: But she wanted to leave?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: She also wanted to leave.",
        "A: Oh of course. They were devoted to each other. I mean they were married for 48 years until\nhe died. They argued all the time but they were devoted to each other.",
        "Q: Did you take anything special, a special doll or a special book or a special toy or anything?",
        "A: Nothing. My parents had two big containers of big, containers in which they had eider downs\nand woolen suits and woolen socks, all of which of course you wouldn\u2019t use in Trinidad which is\ntropical. I forgot about Pauline, my pet goose.",
        "Q: Tell me about Pauline.",
        "A: Oh. As we were leaving Klagenfurt one day, we were eating a meal. We were having our\ngoing away meal. And I said what\u2019s this? It doesn\u2019t taste like chicken. They said it was Pauline.\nThey ate Pauline, my little goose. That was sad. The things that you remember. You forget most\neverything. I think I\u2019m losing my voice as usual.\nWhere was I? Oh we were going by train to Amsterdam and we were sitting in a compartment\nand there was a man who sat opposite us in the same compartment.",
        "Q: Now this is November 38 you\u2019re talking about.",
        "A: 38, yes, yes we left almost immediately. We left almost immediately.",
        "Q: After Kristallnacht.",
        "A: We landed in Trinidad in December of 38 so we left almost immediately and we were on this\ntrain and this man was sitting next to us, apparently wanted to talk and he wanted to ask my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nfather how much money was he hiding in his suitcase. And my father was horrified because my\nfather was the most honest person you\u2019ve ever met. Even to people who wanted to kill you,\nexterminate you, he was going to obey what they said. He would never have done anything like\nthat. He was shocked. Anyhow the man said he had emptied his suitcase and he had fixed it so\nthat he had lots of money in there and jewelry or whatever it is. And my father said the only\njewelry we have we\u2019re wearing. There was, I had a little locket. And my mother had a couple of\nbracelets and my father had a watch or something. And I think maybe two gold chains. They\nwere in plain sight. We were wearing them. Anyhow, when we came to the station, the SS agent\ncame and took the man away. I mean they overheard the conversation obviously. And then too\nthe man, the agent looked at me and looked at my little locket and my parents\u2019 chains and watch\nand he just smiled nicely and nodded his head and left with the man.",
        "Q: Did anybody ask for your ID papers?",
        "A: I have no idea. I wouldn\u2019t know an ID paper if I fell over one. We stayed in Amsterdam until\nthe ship arrived. And we were in a hotel room and we were stunned by what we saw. I don\u2019t\nthink they do this anymore but every single morning, I\u2019d look out the window and before it was\ndaybreak we would see housewives scrubbing their steps with brushes. Every single day. They\nwere so clean in those days. Amsterdam was about the cleanest place on the face of the universe.\nEventually the ship came and we went.",
        "Q: What did you do with your yellow star?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I guess we threw it in the trash as fast as we could. Who knows? We didn\u2019t\nkeep it as a souvenir if that\u2019s what you mean.",
        "Q: I just didn\u2019t know whether you remember taking it with you.",
        "A: No. no, no, no. No recollection of ever seeing any such thing again.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Amsterdam?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: It was at least over a week. I don\u2019t recall cause I remember going almost stir crazy. You know\nlittle kid, mother, father, in a small hotel room.",
        "Q: Did you feel free to walk on the streets?",
        "A: Yeah but I have no recollection doing it, yeah. Just strange town, scared place, whatever. No\nrecollection of anything other than the hotel room.",
        "Q: And the name of your boat, you said was Cotica?",
        "A: Excuse me",
        "Q: The name of the boat.",
        "A: Cotica.",
        "Q: How do you spell it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I would spell phonetically as C-O-K, I don\u2019t know what Dutch did. O-T-T-I-\nC-A. K-A.",
        "Q: Do you know what line it was?",
        "A: No. I haven\u2019t been able to trace it on the internet but its name was Cotica and it was a Dutch\nship as far as I know.",
        "Q: A Dutch line. So now you get on the boat.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: Yeah, and then we were on the boat. It was to go from there to Trinidad you had to go past a,\nBiscayne, the cay of Biscayne. The ship, we were first class since we had enough money. All the\nother kids were third, fourth, whatever, steerage whatever, way down there.",
        "Q: Was it filled with refugees?",
        "A: As far as I know that\u2019s all it was. I don\u2019t know. I have no idea. Yeah it was going to \u2014 who\nelse would go to Trinidad. Why would anybody in their right mind want to go there.",
        "Q: Did you talk to the other children?",
        "A: Oh yeah, well you know there were others, they would come up. But there were days when\nthe weather was very bad. Iremember going up cay of Biscayne the ship was almost parallel up\nand down, up and down. And of course we were sea sick, throwing up into the ocean which was\neasy since we were first class and we were up on the balcony. After a few days you get your sea\nlegs and you no longer throw up. But yes, there were other children. The adults were taking\nEnglish lessons. Us children, no. and some teenage boy came to see us. There were four or five\nof us. And some teenage boy came and saw us. And we complained that you know we didn\u2019t\nknow any English. What were we going to do when we got there. And the parents all were\nlearning English. And how about us.\nAnd he told us there was one phrase we should use and it would get a big sensation and we asked\nhow do you trans \u2014 and what were the \u2014 oh it\u2019s untranslatable and he says you look at the people\nstraight in the face, look straight in the eye. And smile as much as you can and say shut up. It\ngot a reaction. Ok.",
        "Q: Did you talk about what happened to you with the other children? Did they talk about their\nstories and you talk about what you went through?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what we talked about. I doubt it. I don\u2019t know. I have no recollection. Nobody\ntalked about anything. Then we got to Trinidad.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "Q: So you went, there were no stops on the way.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know about that. I never heard about it in my whole life.\nThat\u2019s something you got from your grandmother, not from me.\nDaughter: She did a painting of the ghost that you saw on the ship.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. You know, you know more than \u2014 you must repeat this. You must tell Mrs.\nSchwartz about it. Are we related by the way? Are all Schwartzes related?",
        "Q: I hope so. So you \u2014",
        "A: Anyhow we got to Trinidad.",
        "Q: What did Trinidad mean to you , as a young child.",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: What did Trinidad mean to you as a young child?",
        "A: It was hot. It was unbelievably hot.",
        "Q: Even in December.",
        "A: Trinidad is very close to the equator and coming in December from winter, bitter winter.\nKlagenfurt of course is at the foot of the Alps and being used to snow and ice and what not, to\nget to the tropics. And \u2014",
        "Q: I meant did Trinidad have any meaning for you before you got to \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: We were in Trinidad and I believe we spent two weeks or so \u2014 Ah. They had arranged, I\ndon\u2019t know where. Probably the Jewish refugee committee, who knows. I have no idea how it\nhappened. Children don\u2019t ask questions. We were staying with a family. And --",
        "Q: A Jewish family?",
        "A: Ohno. No, the man was they told me, he told us he was Portuguese. He had very yellowish\nbrownish skin and very curly whitish hair. And his wife was obviously very British with blond\nhair and blue eyes. They had about 12 different children. No two of them had the same shape,\nsize or color. I had never heard of adoption. I don\u2019t know if they were adopted or whether this\nhappens through having enough children with a mixed race, whatever.\nThe youngest ones were pale blond. The oldest ones were much darker, that\u2019s all I know.\nAnyhow we stayed with them for a month. That\u2019s what had been arranged. And then there was\ncarnival or something. I think carnival is in February actually. I don\u2019t know why. But anyhow\nthere was carnival in Trinidad where they go singing through the streets and marching and\ndressed in costume. And singing Mardi Gras and what not and so on.\nThey\u2019d do nothing except sing and dance through the streets. And I ran afoul of the color line\nwhich we knew nothing about because often in Austria, we had never seen anyone. Oh we once\nhad gone to, we once had gone to Vienna and saw a gypsy with a baby. She was nursing a baby\nin the middle of the street, very shocking. Other than that we never saw anybody expect a white\nperson. And in Trinidad there was a -- which we didn\u2019t know there was a color line and we had\nno costume so my mother had, I had dirnd1 skirt and an apron. And my mother put a kerchief on\nmy head upside down, mammy style. And apparently I crossed the color line and caused a\nsensation because a white person doesn\u2019t dress like a black person.\nAnyhow, I don\u2019t know how it happened but my mother immediately got a job in a hat store,\nmaking hats. My mother\u2019s a very nervous woman. And she, we had no place to leave the little\njewelry and money that we had except in her purse.",
        "Q: Are you still living with the family?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I guess so cause it was almost immediately. She almost immediately got a job.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nAnd she\u2019s carrying all this stuffin her purse. And she went to the bathroom at work, put the\npurse down on the sink while she was washing her hands and a black man came in and stole her\npurse. She of course could not identify him because not having been there long enough, every\nblack looked like every other black. When you first see Chinese or you think they all look the\nsame after a while you see everybody\u2019s different. Anyhow all she could say he was black. Of\ncourse he was never found.\nWe now had no money, no jewelry which they had hoped to be able to sell. Anyhow, my mother\nworked and she hated black people. All the rest of her life detested them with a passion.\nThought they were all ignorant stupid and black. (laughs) And they were no better than a gorilla.\nShe absolutely detested them. They later had more reason to hate them. But anyhow, she was\nworking there. And in the evening she would, she cut apart our curtains and made I think maybe\na dozen or less little children\u2019s dresses, little fluffy children\u2019s dresses. And my father was --\nnobody would hire him. There was nothing he could do. They found a little hole in the wall and\nselling children\u2019s dresses which my mother had sewed after working all day and they were an\ninstant success.\nThey were very fluffy and ruffle-y and what not and they were a tremendous success. And as a\nresult this got around and wholesalers came to see him and gave him credit so that he was able to\nstart a nice little business selling children\u2019s dresses. And he even put an ad in the newspaper\nsaying delicious little children\u2019s dresses which he sent to my mother\u2019s relatives in New York.\nBecause we were hoping to get a visa to go to New York. My mother could have gone instantly\nsince she was on a German passport. There was an endless ability of any German to enter at any\ntime.\nBut my father since his place had become Poland was on a Polish visa and there weren\u2019t that\nmany Poles in United States at that time and he had to wait until his visa would come up. And he\nshowed, he sent this to show what they were doing in Trinidad. And they never lived down the \u2014\nmy aunt\u2019s husband Alex Cramer. They never stopped giggling and laughing about delicious\nchildren\u2019s dresses.\nMy mother meanwhile opened up her owns store, naturally and was very successful because she\ncreated hats of a kind that they hadn\u2019t seen before. And they were doing very, very well. And\nthen it became time for England to enter World War II, at which point it was said that it\u2019s a\ncrown colony, an oil colony and so they clapped every last refugee into a detention center with\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nbarbed wire all around it. Black guards in white uniforms high socks with bayonets guarding us.\nAnd there we all were in a detention center.\nNot that we were mistreated or anything but every family got one room.",
        "Q: Was this in Port of Spain?",
        "A: Hm.",
        "Q: In Port of Spain?",
        "A: Oh yes. Somewhere in the suburbs I guess. It was apparently a barracks at one time, well\nwhatever, but there we were. As far as I know I was only one who would leave all the time. I\nhad been chosen by Mrs. Lake who had studied in Germany and wanted to practice her German.\nAnd although there were a number of children there, I was the one chosen to be a companion to\nher who was one year younger. A little monster.\nAnd so I got the benefit of a British boarding school education for the two years we were there.",
        "Q: You actually went to a British boarding school?",
        "A: Yes I went to a British boarding school. Stayed at the boarding school.",
        "Q: While your parents were in the detention camp?",
        "A: Even before then. Almost immediately after we arrived, I was chosen. I never went to\nwhatever schooling they have in Trinidad. It was certainly be segregated. The British would be\nwith British, the Portuguese with Portuguese. The Chinese with Chinese. The black with black,\nthe Spanish with Spanish. No one spoke to anybody outside of their own whatever. They were\ncountless people from India. I don\u2019t recall the women but I remember the men. They were so\nmany of them. They had turbans and were wearing some kind of diaper. And would be sitting on\nthe public steps, all day long. I don\u2019t know why but they would just sit there, old men sitting in\ntheir turbans and sitting on all the public steps.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "Q: So you obviously lived at the boarding school.",
        "A: I lived at the boarding school.",
        "Q: Did you see your parents frequently?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Oh they had, they had rented a very, very nice house before this happened. It was\nsomewhere on the -- way on the outskirts. It was a very nice little house. Within the first month\nof our arriving there. Because he undid his over, over those wooden crates that you have. He\nover -- he opened up the crates and he took out a saw, hammer and nails and he sawed apart one\nof them to make a table and two benches of the crates. So we instantly had furniture.\nIt was very interesting. There were coconut trees and the houses were, had metal roof,\ncorrugated metal roofs and when it rained, it had monsoons there, rainy season. The coconuts\nwould fall on the roof and went bong, bong, bong, bong. And opposite us there was some guy\nwho had, some man some Indian man who wore just his diaper and a turban and had a goat. And\nthe goat would be there all day long on a chain and say (bleats). I would carry on conversations\nwith the goat. That\u2019s all I remember of that. I don\u2019t remember any children there whatsoever.\nBy the time we were in the detention center there were I think five children. They had duties.\nThey had to sit, decide who would cook and who would clean, who would do what. And \u2014",
        "Q: Were these Jewish refugees?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah they were all Jewish except there was a separate section for one Christian.\nThat was the only one who was a Christian. The chain they couldn\u2019t tell, the British claim they\ncouldn\u2019t tell if some of us might be spies. And that was very important because there was a, an\noil crown colony, besides which I believe the natives didn\u2019t want us there. I think they hated us\nwith a zeal to work. Specifically they all had siestas. They would have a big meal at lunch time.\nEverybody would go home from work and eat and sleep and the refugees were, just continued to\nwork and walk around in the heat of the sun. Nobody would care about whether it was hot and\ncold or whatever. And everybody would make fun of us because of that.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nAnd since nobody had ever seen refugees before and the zeal they have, they assumed it was,\nthat\u2019s the way Jewish people are. Instead of that\u2019s just the way refugees are. People who have\nlived wherever they were, were \u2014",
        "Q: Did people exchange their stories, the refugees among each other?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what they did. I know they had their own synagogue and everything else.",
        "Q: They had a synagogue?",
        "A: Oh yeah they instantly had their usual mentality of everything. Synagogue, shops, stores\nwhatever.",
        "Q: Did your parents observe the Sabbath in \u2014",
        "A: Hm.",
        "Q: Did your parents observe the Sabbath in Trinidad?",
        "A: Oh yeah sure.",
        "Q: The holidays, and still kept that up.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. They do all their lives.",
        "Q: Even in the detention camp they did.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what they did in the detention camp because after a while I would\njust stay in the school and on weekends since I hated having to go to the Anglican church. They\nwent to the Anglican church and I had never been to church before and I was, you had to kneel\ndown at certain times. And Mrs. Lake\u2019s daughters, the oldest ones were in the choir. And I was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\ncertain that if I kneeled down or attended church any minute God would come and lightning\nwould strike me dead. And as I discovered he didn\u2019t.\nI was terrified at the boarding school because we had to sing a certain prayer. Oh there were\nmosquitoes. So you had the mosquito net and you had to say a prayer at night time before you\nwent to sleep. Something about if I should die before I wake I hope the Lord my soul would take.\nSomething, angels at my head and feet. I was terrified to go to sleep. I didn\u2019t want to see these\ndamn angels and I sure didn\u2019t want to see god taking my soul while I was sleeping.\nMeanwhile Valerie, Mrs. Lake\u2019s daughter, the little monster, would have her fun. I couldn\u2019t\nspeak English you see. And in the dead of night, we shared the room. In the dead of night she\nwould get up every once in a while. Out of her mosquito net, come over to my bed while I was\nactually sleeping. See I did sleep and whack me one. And I would scream. I mean I had gone\nthrough a lot. All I need was something like that. I would scream.\nAnd Nanny would come in and she would say that I was had, Valerie would say I had done this\nto her. That Valerie was sleeping and I had done this. And I couldn\u2019t defend myself. I couldn\u2019t\nspeak English.\nSo I had great incentive every single day we had lessons and I would go after I had studied the\nlesson, you go to school all day and then you have to learn your homework and then I had to go\nsee Mrs. Lake every day and recite my homework. And I complained to her. I didn\u2019t know what\nthese words meant. I can\u2019t memorize this. I can\u2019t understand this. Sail-y, gaily be night a Gallic\nnight and sunshine are in shadow when riding along, singing a song. In short what does it mean.\nAnd she said you don\u2019t have to know what something means to learn. Just repeat it often enough\nyou can learn anything. When you are old enough you will know what it means. Unfortunately\nI\u2019m now 82 years old. Ok.\nAnyhow I owe Mrs. Lake a great deal. I learned a huge number of things. I learned how to\nmemorize. I learned how to do mathematics, English and everything else. British history. You\nname it. French. It was an excellent school. Every single day we had lunch and they would\nserve these tropical foods I\u2019d never seen before. Fried bananas. Breadfruit. These horrible things\nas far as I was concerned. Secondly you have to eat it at lunch time, whereas we were used to\nhaving a small lunch and a big dinner. They had these huge lunches after which they took a nap\nand then ate hardly anything at all in the evening.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nI would spend all night long starving to death, crying to myself being so hungry. But at lunch\ntime when they served these foods I would make horrified faces and Mrs. Lake would send me\nout of the room. I had to stand outside where I could see the children so I\u2019d stand outside. And I\nwouldn\u2019t\u2019 get to eat anything the next meal that was served. I had the same food. I had to learn to\neat it without making a face, without dawdling, eating as rapidly as everybody else. And I\nlearned to eat any garbage you put in front of me without making a face.",
        "Q: What was the name of the school?",
        "A: Mrs. Lake\u2019s boarding school, as far as I know.",
        "Q: And what, did the detention camp have a name?",
        "A: [have no idea, no. But on weekends, since I was so terrified of having to go to this Anglican\nchurch if I stayed there, I said I was homesick. I wanted to see my parents. And it was a two\nhour, two hour ride going by tram and you have to change, transfer in the middle and wait for the\none to get to the detention center. And there was a little girl all by myself going on this open air\ntram, every single weekend. All the way over and all the way back. No one ever spoke to me,\nlooked at me twice. That\u2019s what strict color line does.\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nVolunteer collection interview with Erica Laufer. This is track number two and you are still in\nTrinidad going to school and visiting your family on the weekends, you said. Going by tram,\nyourself. Did you hear me? You were talking about being in \u2014\nErica Laufer: Yeah, Trinidad and going home weekends.",
        "Q: Anything else about that?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: Yeah and as far as I know there were only about five children, four or five children in the\nwhole camp. And I would, we would be together on the weekend when I got there. And this is so\nstrange. They had an old piano outside. This 1s a tropic with tropical rains and all that. There was\nan old piano outside. Opposite the entrance to the sole Christian. This man looked like a, my\nrecollection, he looked like the classical picture of a German spy. Bald headed or whatever.\nAnyhow he was the nicest man you ever met. He could play the piano. The parents just didn\u2019t\napprove of this, but he would come and play the piano and we would sing along. We were the\nonly people who ever spoke to the man. He was all by himself in there.",
        "Q: What kind of songs did you sing?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I guess German. I don\u2019t know. I have no idea.",
        "Q: Were you a musical child?",
        "A: No, no. Painting, artist, what not, but not musical. My uncle, I understand, Richard, my\nfather\u2019s, my mother\u2019s brother I understand was an understudy at the Vienna Opera, but I don\u2019t\nknow about that. So I was told. I can\u2019t always believe everything my mother said.",
        "Q: Did you think of Klagenfurt when you were in Mrs. Lake\u2019s school at all? Did you miss your\nhome town? Did you think about them, think about it?",
        "A: No, not that I know of. Hasn\u2019t occurred to me.",
        "Q: How would you describe those two years? You were in that boarding school for two years?\nWas it mostly positive, mostly negative, part of each?",
        "A: Other than being hungry all night long and hating the food, having to learn a new language\nand having to memorize all kinds of things. I was miserable. I had no friends. I didn\u2019t play the\nstrange games that they played. Eventually they were knitting sweaters, cocky sweaters or socks\nor something, sweaters for the troops. And I found I could under the wits out of people a certain\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nway get even, by reading. I would sit on the swing and read and knit at the same time. This\nwould annoy the living wits out of everybody around me but I felt I got my revenge that way.",
        "Q: How long did it take you to learn English?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I was desperate to learn because I thought that if I could speak English I could\nexplain that Valerie is doing this to me, instead of me doing it to her. And then I discovered the\ngreat knowledge that one needs to have in life. That truth does not set you free. That the fact that\nyou can speak and say something, no one will believe you against the daughter of the owner.\nAnd so I learned so many things in Trinidad.",
        "Q: Were you aware, or did people talk or your parents talk about when the war started, when\nGermany invaded Poland in September 39?",
        "A: No, I have no knowledge or recollection. My parents didn\u2019t speak about such things in front\nof children. Secondly, as far as I know, nobody ever talked about anything again. Period. Tried\nto forget it like 1t never happened. And go on with your life from here. And never think as to\nwhat happened in the past. It\u2019s only very recently in my old age that I\u2019ve been ruminating on it.\nEverybody always hid. Now I keep wishing I had asked my mother or my father certain things\nlong before they died, for which I will never have the answer. But nobody ever spoke about it\nagain. They never mentioned Austria or anything.\nMy parents did go back to Austria once after the war. They were offered to come back. They\nwere requested to come back and they went back. But of course you can\u2019t go back again. There\nwere too many memories. My parents drew double social security. They drew social security\nfrom Austria, as a result of having worked there as well as US social security.",
        "Q: Just to go back in time, were you aware of the book burnings?",

        "A: Yeah well in the middle of the street, yeah.",
        "Q: You actually saw \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, in Vienna, yeah. But they were so angry at me because I kept peeking out of the corner\nof the black curtains.",
        "Q: You saw it from your \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, from the upstairs. They were so angry at me because somebody might see that the\nblack curtain was moving. But yes, you could see those things. Of course you could smell the\nsmoke and that would be enough for you to look to see whether you all were going to burn any\nminute.",
        "Q: Did you ask your parents why are they burning books?",
        "A: I have no idea. I don\u2019t think people spoke to children. This was a generation where children\nwere not meant to be heard. I mean they were to be seen and not heard and not seen all that much\neither. I mean stay to yourself and don\u2019t bother us.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s get back to Trinidad. So you\u2019re in the school for two years. What did you in the\nsummer time? Did you stay?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: In the, it was very, very strict. There was nothing you could do. I mean you couldn\u2019t go back\nto your bedroom. You couldn\u2019t\u2019 do this, you couldn\u2019t do that. You had to stay in this room,\nstudy. You had to go outside and play there. It was very, very strict. But in the summer they had\na place on the water and I went there with them for two weeks one summer. And there was no\nelectricity. There was no radio or anything but there was a wind up Victrola where you could\nplay records, ancient records. And I learned how to swim and how to dive. And how to jump in.",
        "Q: Did you see other parts of the island? Besides Port of Spain.",
        "A: No, not that I know of. No, people didn\u2019t have cars in those days. My parents were working\nall the time. Their excuse for everything and the rest of the days they were working. They never\ndid anything.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s move on then to the time that you\u2019re getting ready to leave. What were your parents\u2019\nplans and how did they make it?",
        "A: Ihave no idea. I haven\u2019t got any idea at all. I had no idea. Recently my family, my son and\nmy daughter pointed out that it says on the internet that we left from Argentina which I have no\nrecollection of ever having even dreamt of Argentina or seen Argentina or how we got there. The\nonly thing I remember is that we came on ship and got, we were very disappointed because it\nwas very foggy and we didn\u2019t see the Statue of Liberty.",

        "Q: What did the United States mean to you as a ten year old?",
        "A: It was very cold. Compared to the tropics. We were at Macy\u2019s and Irene, my mother\u2019s\ndistant cousin, somehow vouched for us and in those days you couldn\u2019t come to the United\nStates unless you had somebody vouch for you, that you would never need one penny from the\nUnited States or from any state or city or anything. Something for some reason they stopped\ndoing. But anyhow in those days you needed that. And aunt Irene, her husband, uncle Alex,\nworked in New York. He checked music to see if that sound was copyrighted. And they\nsponsored us. And she had never worked. And they sponsored us and she said they could only\nsponsor a limited number of people depending on how much money they make, Alex made. And\nmade my parents sign a contract that they would never ask for one penny from them. Regardless\nof what they promised the United States.\nI sort of never forgave aunt Irene for that but that\u2019s a different story. But they had gotten us a one\nmonth rent in a brownstone in Manhattan. It was a huge efficiency and my father pulled out the\ndictionary, encyclopedia, whatever it was. It was orange covered and it showed the flags of all\nthe different countries and what not. And he pulled up the United States and he found out that\nWashington, DC is the capital and that not too far from New York and it didn\u2019t cost that much by\nGreyhound to go from New York to Washington. And he, and it was a small town and since it\nwas the government, they all would be needing hats because of the ladies would be attending\nfunctions and would need to wear a hat. And so it would be a good place for my mother to be a\nmilliner. And they decided to we would move at the end of the month to Washington, DC.",

        "Q: Before you came to the United States, what did America mean to you?",
        "A: Nothing. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever heard of it. Nothing. I, they discovered my family, my son and\ndaughter discovered that I came through Ellis Island. I swore up and down I never heard of Ellis\nIsland but they showed me where on the internet it shows that we came, got my name, came\nthrough Ellis Island. I don\u2019t know what Ellis Island is. I never saw it but they tell me that\u2019s\nwhere we came and that we came from Argentina, which I don\u2019t\u2019 understand either cause I came\nfrom Trinidad. Children don\u2019t know these things. So now we are in New York. And we\u2019re in, no\nwe\u2019re in New York and we\u2019re at Macy\u2019s and seeing all these sights and it\u2019s snowing outside and\nit\u2019s bitter cold. And my aunt had gotten me without knowing me, had gotten me a snow suit.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nHere I\u2019m ten had a half years old. A snow suit. This dark maroon with snow drops in turquoise\nand a big hood and I looked like a dwarf. That was because it was very, very cold and I don\u2019t\nknow about shoes. I must have had boots. I don\u2019t know but we walked through Macy\u2019s and I\u2019m\ndressed in this weird outfit. And I suddenly got whatever, I started to howl. I cried and cried and\ncried. I wanted a doll. And my mother said you never liked dolls. You hate dolls. And you\u2019re\ntoo old for a doll. But you know I wanted a baby doll. And they said they\u2019re not much money but\neventually they got me a doll just to shut me up. I guess. And of course I never played with it\nagain, but anyhow, that\u2019s a vivid recollection.\nSomehow we had one month, every place we went to we had one month. When we got to\nWashington, DC we had one month, it must have been through the refugee committee I guess. I\ndon\u2019t know. We were staying with a rabbi and his family in northeast Washington. And it was\njust so different again, so very confusing.",
        "Q: So you were in New York only for a month?",
        "A: Yes, we couldn\u2019t have afforded the rent and my parents were anxious to get on with it and not\nhave to be thankful or whatever. And just get on with life. Yes, we were just there for a month.\nAnd when we had this one month, I think in DC with the rabbi and looked around. And it was\nobviously to my parents not the right neighborhood in which people would be wanting to buy\ndesigner hats, made to order. And discovered a place in Georgetown, which at that time was a\nslum where they rented a building at 1330 Wisconsin Avenue, northwest. That there was a store\ndownstairs and there was a little efficiency upstairs. My parents stayed upstairs and the store had,\nin the back of the store there was a little room which, my mother\u2019s workroom and it had a cot\nand that\u2019s where I would sleep at night time. That was my place. They were upstairs, I was\ndownstairs. There was a small refrigerator, an antique one, with a gas refrigerator with a motor\non top of it.\nAnd one day apparently the gas, my mother was always very, she couldn\u2019t do anything. Oh, her\nhusband had to do everything. Everything was such a crisis. Couldn\u2019t do anything at all. One day\nthe gas leaked and this person who could never do anything, somehow called the authorities, had\nthem remove the thing and got a new refrigerator.\nBy the time my father came home, we had a new refrigerator. Ok.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "Q: Where did you go to school in Georgetown?",
        "A: It was just there were three schools next to each other. It was just a block and a half away.\nNot on Wisconsin Avenue, but the side street and it was Addison high, Addison Curtis and\nHyde. Two of them were elementary schools and one of them was a school for bad girls. And\nwe all shared the same playground. And the bad girls learned how to can and cook and iron. And\nI know we went over there too. We learned how to, this was during World War II and we learned\nhow to, we were taught how to iron your husband\u2019s shirt. And how to sew and how to darn socks\nand how to cook Spam and string beans and potatoes and foods, very cheap foods and so on. So\nthat we could manage on your husband\u2019s income.",
        "Q: Do you remember December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: When the United States entered the war.",
        "A: No. No. We had a lot of air raid drills at the school and we would go into the basement and\nsing patriotic songs and being me, I one day raised my hand and got called on and asked why are\nwe in the basement. If there really was an air raid and a bomb dropped on us, we\u2019d be buried\nalive. And the teacher gave me the same reply that people always give to this kind of question\napparently. Just keep quiet and keep singing.\nI\u2019ve heard this so often in my life. I would ask a question so basic and always got that type of\nresponse. So all life has been a learning thing. I was picked on mercilessly. They called me the\nlittle Hitler. Because I was German.\nAnd of course the only one in the school and of course the only Jewish person within miles\naround. As far as I know. And I was not ever going to tell anybody that I was Jewish again. I\nhad enough in Austria where It was out there when they were in a nice warm classroom and I\nhad to be outside all by myself in the snow and what not so I wouldn\u2019t have my brain filled up\nwith Catholicism or whatever.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nSo I said nothing. I was picked on mercilessly. They played games like dodge and it finally\noccurred to me that they really wanted to hit me as hard as possible. So I would refuse to play\nand remembered what I had done in Trinidad and I would sit during recess and I would sit and\nread. You won\u2019t believe this at ten years old, ten and a half, I would read Plato and all the\nclassics. The others could barely read. They were American students and the education system\nwas ridiculous. My parents of course were terrified of authorities. Wouldn\u2019t dream of saying no,\nthat\u2019s not right. The teachers felt I needed to learn now to adjust to learn American history. I\ncould have learned it by reading a book in one weekend. But no, they insisted that I go in class\naccording to my age, instead of according to my knowledge which is far superior having gone to\na boarding school.\nThey were learning adding and subtracting and I was doing algebra. Doing math in my head and\nwhat not. Doing compositions. Anyhow I sat in the back of the room for two years. Teacher said\nI could join in any time I wanted to for whatever I wanted to do and spent my time painting\npictures the whole time, two years.",
        "Q: Then what happened? Did you leave that school?",
        "A: Oh Georgetown was a slum in those days and we would play hide and go seek in buildings,\nhuge, huge, huge buildings. The floor, there were no windows, the doors were wide open. The\nfloor would have holes in it. We would play ghost and what not and I was on the swimming\nteam, having learned how to swim. I was on the swimming team and we had swimming thing\nagainst whatever the major schools in northeast and they disabled me almost instantly by kicking\nme in the stomach after we dived in.\nBut anyhow, I was on this -- I went to the playground. We never had anybody watching me after\nwe came to the United States. I spent all my time after school. I would go to the library and read\nbooks every single day until it was time to come home and eat dinner. And in the summer I\nwould go to the playground. Georgetown playground was just a few blocks away and did crafts\nand what not.\nAnd fended off boys who kept saying annoying things to me. No longer picking on me. They\nwere interested in me.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",

        "A: We had, we had air raid drills all the time.",
        "Q: Knowing what was happening.",
        "A: Oh no, well there was rationing and you couldn\u2019t get anything. There was rationing for\neverything. And there was a butcher across the street who had his eye on me and my parents\nwould send me there because if I went there, we would get butter and meat, whereas if they went\nthere they didn\u2019t get anything, even if they had ration cards.",
        "Q: Did your parents have any contact with their family back in \u2014",
        "A: My mother had some kind of stomach condition and her cousin, Freddie\u2019s father, Hotzel, one\nof the Hotzels, Leo Hotzel had moved to Switzerland and with my cousin Freddie who was I\nthink a year younger than me, who eventually became a physician I understand. I think he\u2019s still\nalive or where he is. I think he left, they all left Switzerland because Leo was in Czech Republic\nwhen he died.\nAnyhow, where was I\u2019?",

        "Q: I was asking if your parents had any contact?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: Yeah, since she had this stomach condition and needed medicine and kept ranting and railing\nthat American doctors are far behind, she would send to her relatives in Switzerland soap and\nperfumes and candies and what not. And they would instead send this to Austria or Germany or\nFrance or wherever they had relatives for sedrabal, which was some kind of a stomach thing. I\nthink she lacked sufficient stomach acid or something and this would cure her. They had nothing\ncomparable in the United States. I haven\u2019t been able to find it on the internet. It\u2019s long since gone\nwhatever it was.\nMy mother\u2019s brother meanwhile, when we were you know I said I had never seen when we left\nKlagenfurt, I had never seen my very beloved grandparents again, my mother\u2019s parents. The\nSchwartzes. Apparently uncle Richard, my mother\u2019s brother, took them, they \u2014 I know he was in\nItaly and that went. I know that they were in several countries and eventually he took them to\nFrance.\nFrom there they were, after World War ended, the Red Cross informed my parents that her\nparents had died in Buchenwald concentration camp. Apparently the French sent them to their\ndeath in Buchenwald. My uncle somehow, remember he was the one that the nuns had said when\nhe was a kid that he would end up on the gallows. But because he always found some way out,\nthat wasn\u2019t a standard one.\nAnyhow, he wound up in the French Foreign Legion and spent World War II in North Africa\nwith the French Foreign Legion. He eventually, he went back to Austria after, after the war.\nAnd he eventually came to the United States.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s move on. You spent the war years going to school. Now it\u2019s 1945.",
        "A: Yeah, oh I was on the swim team and I had a good friend by the name of Audrey. Very, very\npretty girl who was also a very, very good swimmer. And I remember being shocked going to\nsee her in their apartment as to how many people there were who slept all in one bed. And how\nlittle they had. Anyhow, next thing you know it was World War II and sailors would come home\non the weekend and you couldn\u2019t go downtown to the movie houses without the sailors were and\nsoldiers were lined up on the street like four deep, trying to pick up any girl that walked by,\nscreaming after them. Anyhow, next thing you know little Audrey was pregnant. And she asked\nme whether I knew where babies came from and I said of course. I had no idea.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nNo idea whatsoever. I foolishly went home and asked my mother. And she went why do you\nwant to know. And I said well Audrey says she\u2019s going to have a baby. I thought my mother was\ngoing to throw up on the floor. She was so shocked. Within I think a month or weeks, she had\nfound a house to buy in Petworth, a row house, all the way across town. I remember my father\nbeing stunned. How would you have money for a down payment on a house? And she had done\nthat. My father had never gone to a grocery store and she had. He would -- she worked and she\ngave him all her money and he would take care of it as was the ancient method. And he would\ngive her grocery money and she would skimp off the grocery money to such an extent that she\nhad enough for a down payment on a house. And he wanted to know how would they pay for this\nevery single month and she said they would rent out the apartment they were living in now and\nshe had her store. And he had an income by now too. And they would be able to do, and they\nwould rent one or two rooms in the house. I could sleep on the sofa. And they would rent enough\nwhere they would pay for the utilities and the mortgage.\nShe had read a book that\u2019s called How To Make a Million Dollars in Your Spare Time in Real\nEstate. And she took that as a recipe and followed every last word of it. Toward the end they\nowned six houses.\nShe could never get my father to do that because every penny he had, by that time he had a\nuniform shop. And every penny he had he stuck into the uniform shop. I would work there on\nSaturdays. He would go on shopping trips for his store to Philadelphia or New York. Mostly\nPhiladelphia and would take me along and I would try on the uniforms and see which were\ncomfortable and which ones didn\u2019t wrinkle and which ones looked very stylish and as a result he\nhad very stylish uniforms. And the wholesalers made a lot of money telling people which\nuniforms had been proven to be the most comfortable and the most stylish. They were selling\nthem all over the place.",
        "Q: These are military uniforms or \u2014",
        "A: No, no these were. This was a day of segregation and white \u2014 or black women couldn\u2019t be in\na white neighborhood without being in a uniform. And besides which you wouldn\u2019t want to see\nthe clothing they wore. It would be too risqu\u00e9 or too dirty or too weird. By our taste. And you\nwouldn\u2019t want to have one of them walking through your neighborhood because they would be\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nin great danger probably, undoubtedly. And so they all had to have a uniform. So he had a shop\nin a black neighborhood on seventh street and (sigh) which had uniforms, ladies uniforms. And\nthen he also took in for pretty white fluffy blouses and then he took in white stockings and then\ndressy stockings for holidays and so on.\nAnd I would go there on Saturdays and help him.",
        "Q: Now you\u2019re in high school.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. Probably junior high. I would go there and I was so shocked. Little black girls\ncame in. They looked like they were ten or eleven with boyfriends who would buy them fancy\nstockings and the girls would act so thankful to the boys. And the boys were so nonchalant. I\nbecame so disgusted with the whole thing. I hated it.\nThe moment I was 15 I got a underage permit and I got a, I was able to get a job at a department\nstore as a sales lady. For the summer. I didn\u2019t tell them that I was going to go back to school.\nThey just assumed I was one of the many girls who stopped working, I mean stopped going to\nschool and was working. And so I got a job, at a very nice department store. And two months\nlater my parents insisted that they were going on vacation. A friend of theirs, a man who had a\nshop across the street. His brother had a place up in Akwar, New York in the Poconos and\ninsisted I go with them for a week because the man had a son by the name of Harold that they\nwanted me to meet.\nAnd of course I hated him at first sight. And when I came back after the week up in the\nmountains, Lansburgh\u2019s said that they didn\u2019t need me anymore that my job was gone. So I got a\njob at a five and ten a block or so further down. Kresge\u2019s five and ten. And I was in the\nbasement. They put me to selling, counting a hundred marbles and putting them in a sack. A\nhundred marbles to the bag, all day long. And I, there was a curtain there between this and the\nstore and I would sit as far in the curtain as I possibly could because there was a black man who\nworked the stock room.\nHe was big and I was terrified of him. I had never been this close to a black man before. I was\nterrified of him. Anyhow \u2014",
        "Q: Did you ever go back to high school?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nA; Oh yeah. I went through high school, college and law school. And secretarial school and half\nway through a master of laws. Yes.",
        "Q: You were talking about what you were doing",
        "A: Oh no, at this time, yeah I was sure I went back. I was in the, it was so interesting. I was in\nthe basement of the five and ten and then they transferred me to selling goldfish and I was\nopposite a lady, a very old lady who painted Polaroid photographs. And I learned from her in my\nspare time which is much, how to paint on photographs, a very good skill that came in handy\nmany years later.\nAnyhow, from there they transferred me upstairs, next to the entrance, selling wall paint. And\none day a sailor came in and I was very sheltered you understand. I had not ever gone out or\nanything. And he came over and he wanted to meet me later, as soon as I got off, and proceeded\nto tell me what he wanted to do. And like an idiot I opened up my purse and took out a day\u2019s\nworth of wages, five dollars, handed him the five dollars and said here go buy it on ninth street.\nIt\u2019s just two blocks over. Ninth street was a red light district. He took my five dollars. A short\nwhile later the lady who was the floor walker walked over and said I was fired for being uppity\nwith the customers. I found out later he was her son home on leave.\nI never mentioned anything about the five dollars or what he had said because I knew I wouldn\u2019t\nbe believed. I had learned this at Mrs. Lake\u2019s. No use saying.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s move on a little bit, so you finished high school?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Where did you go to high school?",
        "A: I went to first McFarland. It\u2019s in Petworth. Went to McFarland junior high and it has, next\ndoor to Rosewood high school. I was very popular. I was considered very good looking in my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nday and I had many friends and I joined a Jewish sorority. They were outlawed but we were in\nthem and\u2014",
        "Q: Did you talk about your childhood with them?",
        "A: No, no. No. You don\u2019t want to show that you\u2019re different from other people, that you had\ndifferent backgrounds from what other people have. No, never mentioned it.",
        "Q: Never mentioned it.",
        "A: Nobody asked either.",
        "Q: Did you drop your British accent?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I lost that very rapidly in elementary school you know. Elementary school when I\nfirst got there, the teacher walked in the room. I stand up and said good morning Miss Jones and\nshe would call on you so and so. Yes, Miss Jones, right away Miss Jones. And the others, yes,\nyes, you learn very rapidly to drop that.",
        "Q: Then you go on to college. Did you start college right after high school?",
        "A: Oh no, oh no. my father wanted me to open up a chain store and I didn\u2019t want any part of that\nkind of business. By that time he had moved up to 14\" street to a better neighborhood, so called\nfor a while. And I wanted no part of selling and I wanted to go to New York school of fashion\ndesigning. And my mother said over her dead body would I leave the house until I was married.\nSo my father said that he had been supporting his family at a much younger age. He saw no\nreason why they should support me. But anyhow they finally decided they would give me one\nyear of any education that would then make me financially independent and I could then do\nwhatever it is I wanted to do with my whatever.\nOne of the problems was in high school 1n those days people were very insecure. We all were\nsure we were going to die as a result of an atomic bomb from the Russians. And everybody got\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nmarried. It seemed everybody was engaged, including me in high school, ready to get married\nthe day they got out of high school.\nAnd we decided on McLafin school for medical and legal secretaries. One year of learning how\nshorthand, typing, blood tests, urinalyses, biothermies, all the systems of the human body, et\ncetera. Very, very intense for one year. Upstairs, two rooms. And I learned how to take blood\ngive blood, do all these things. Look at microscopes, count how many blood cells there are et\ncetera. And then after I graduated I got a job. They gave me a job for the summer for some\nphysician, Dr. Goldstein. While his nurse was in England on a three months honeymoon. And I\nworked there and learned I would never again work for a physician in my entire life, that they\u2019re\ntotal phonies and what not.\nAnyhow I then got a job with the American Trucking Association which was a lobby for the\ntrucking industry in the legal department. And the men would come in at 10:00 with their hats\non, sit down at their desk, smoke a cigarette and read the paper and send me out to get coffee and\nhave me doing typing and shorthand and what not. And I soon realized that I could do what they\nwere doing a lot better than what I was doing. And saved my money. Needed all the money I\ncould. I had to work for two years to pay for dental work. I had never had dental work, shoes,\nfeet and what not. I had all kinds of disabilities that nobody had enough money for.\nAnd after that decided I would, I didn\u2019t know I had the brains for it, but I decided to I went to\nGeorge Washington University and they said I didn\u2019t have the requirements to get to college. I\nhad decided in high school to enjoy myself. And not take geometry. I dropped geometry and\nalgebra two and physics, what not. And enjoyed myself in high school, instead of studying.\nCause I thought I was going to marry Ralph as soon as I got out, but instead broke up with him.\nBut anyhow, as a result I didn\u2019t have the requirements. They told me I could go as a non-degree\nstudent and if I got good grades, when I was 21, I could petition that my grades be counted and\nmiraculously I got all A\u2019s. I went all the way through college and got all A\u2019s and one D. The D\nwas in sociology, criminology and sociology of the criminal. I just wanted to throw them all in\njail and throw the key away instead of mollycoddling them.\nBut anyhow, all the rest of them I got A\u2019s and I became Phi Beta Kappa which was an honorary\nsociety. I requested a scholarship the last year. I was working during the day and going to night\nschool or other years when I had enough money going to day school and I mean I would go to\nschool during the day or at night, depending on which I had money for. And one year, the last\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nyear I won the scholarship and they told me my father made enough money to send me through\ncollege. And I said my father refuses to send me to college. He believes that women have no\nbusiness being in college. They should be married and having children. And that if I got an\neducation I would limit my choice of how many husbands, for a husband and he was adamantly\nopposed to it. They didn\u2019t care about that. But the head of the political science department said\nif I would switch my major to political science, they needed a secretary. I could work there three\nafternoons a week and I would, they gave me a scholarship of 150 dollars which in those days\nwas something. And between that and working for him in the school I was able to pay for my last\nyear of college.\nAnd then I was working as a secretary, got good wages, I finished and I thought gee I got all A\u2019s\nand what not. I tried to get a job and I was, couldn\u2019t find a job. The only job I could get was as a\ntypist for the Congressional Record. A reduction of what I was making as a secretary. By that\ntime I was a cracker jack secretary, legal secretary and I was so shocked that you could get all\nA\u2019s, show that you had the ambition to work your way, pay for it yourself, and nevertheless\ncouldn\u2019t get a job. I walked across the campus to law school and said I would like to apply to\nbecome a lawyer. And the gal there said to fill out this form and she saw my Phi Beta Kappa key\nand she said it wouldn\u2019t be any problem at any rate. No tests, no anything. Ok so I went to law\nschool and worked as, for lawyers. One year I went to the most outstanding law firm 1n\nWashington. They had an ad for -- two ads, one for a law clerk and one for a secretary and I\napplied for a secretary. And they gave me an IQ test and refused to hire me because they said\nmy IQ was as high or higher than the lawyers.\nAnd I said so that means I can really help them and they said no, this would be too confusing so I\nsaid well how about the job you have a job as a law clerk. Oh no. We don\u2019t hire girls for that. I\nsaid well if my IQ 1s so high then I\u2019m going to law school. They said that would confuse\neveryone. There\u2019s -- absolutely not.\nSo I became a women\u2019s libber very soon.",
        "Q: What did you do after law school?",
        "A: Well my last job was with a law firm. It was fabulous. They were going to hire me as a\nlawyer, but I\u2019d have to find my own clients, because one of the men was pulling out. He was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nbecoming a lawyer for the musicians union and I could take his place. Unfortunately I had to\npass the bar within less than a month after school was out. And the DC bar at that time was three\ndays ordeal. Three solid days of writing without stopping. I thought I knew everything since I\nknew where the court houses were, the judges, since I had composed wills and contracts and I\nknew everything about it. I thought oh well I can whiz through it in no time.\nUnfortunately I flunked the law exam on contracts, a course in which I had gotten an A. I\nflunked it. I sat through this law exam. My mind was blank. I had writer\u2019s cramp. I couldn\u2019t even\nconcentrate. Anyhow within a week of having taken that exam I also took the federal service\nentrance exam as back up. And I practically passed that barely within two points or something.\nBut was picked up by the veterans administration because, not because my score was high\nbecause everybody else had a higher score since they had studied for a year.\nBut because I had worked for a doctor and gone through McLaflin\u2019s medical school, I knew one\nbone from the other. I knew the blood systems. I knew all this stuff backwards and forwards and\nthey were doing disability and they were rating disability of veterans. And people on social\nsecurity and old age and so on. So they hired me.\nAnd they couldn\u2019t promote me fast enough. They thought I was a genius. I got one promotion\nafter the other. Even bringing, in taking off several weeks to have a baby.",
        "Q: When did you get married?",
        "A: I got married in my last year of law school. At that point I was working for the teamsters\nunion and I suddenly had the \u2014 and Chris was working for, Chris was at the Indian embassy and\nhe was studying, at that point he was studying on his, was he still on his master\u2019s. Yeah, at that\npoint he was on his, no he was on his PhD. He had gotten a master\u2019s in Poly Sci, international\nrelations. And he was working on his PhD in this. Peaceful uses on atomic energy was his field.\nAnd --",
        "Q: His name \u2014",
        "A: Chris, Christian Mathur, M-A-T-H-U-R. Christian Dion Mathur. He, we were typing his\nthesis. We rented a typewriter. My girlfriend Beatrice and I were sitting there on a table just like\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nthis. We had two typewriters and he had written something and his English was atrocious. You\ncouldn\u2019t make heads or tails of half of his stuff. What do you mean here, what do you mean.\nAnd here I am within weeks of delivering. I am sitting here drinking gin and water and smoking,\nchain smoking the entire time. Nobody ever told us you shouldn\u2019t drink and shouldn\u2019t smoke.\nYou can see my daughter here. She\u2019s perfectly normal.",
        "Q: Where was your husband from?",
        "A: India, from Hyderabad India.\nDaughter: You didn\u2019t marry the Jewish person.",
        "A: Oh yeah. My, my I couldn\u2019t find anybody. I would find, I would go out with a \u2014 and\nnowadays you were on dates. You took a date and you would have them meet you at home. Your\nparents met your, parent \u2014 you didn\u2019t just go out. Your parents had to meet who you \u2014 If I\nbrought home a Jewish boy, my mother would have a fit. This is wrong with him, that\u2019s wrong\nwith him. This is wrong with, she\u2019d carry on. If I brought home a Gentile boy, my father, heart\nbroken. How could you do this. I couldn\u2019t satisfy them, no matter who I went out with, they\ndisapproved totally. And I don\u2019t know how. But anyhow, I never found anybody who was, I\ntried desperately. I never found anybody who was intelligent. They all seemed shallow,\nthinking, drinking beer and girls and what not.\nAnd Chris was different.",
        "Q: You had your first child?",
        "A: Yeah so I had a child, yes. And you can imagine how unique this was. Well first of all there\nwere only five people in my law school graduating class out of a couple hundred.",
        "Q: Five women you mean?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nDaughter: I thought there were two.",
        "A: No, there were five. In the law school. We would meet in the ladies room. We would dash in\nthe ladies room to hide from the guys. The guys were so angry at us because we were in law\nschool. It wasn\u2019t usual in those days. It was so rare.",
        "Q: Did you have any other children?",
        "A: Yeah, I had a son a few years later. But I brought the baby into the office cause they\u2019d given\nme a shower and the women were very angry at me for politicking. I want to show them. This is\na beautiful baby I have as a result of a shower. But anyhow, I came back to work very soon.\nChris got his PhD and I came back to work, very, very soon. And kept getting promoted. And\nthen word came, this is the veteran\u2019s administration. Only veterans should have jobs as long as\nthere\u2019s a veteran available. And so I was out of a job. And I found a job at Central Office where\nthey didn\u2019t have this requirement at that point. And I was drafting letters for the signature of the\ncommissioner of social security as to the final whatever it is to congressmen. And I got promoted\nand then the word came and I was section chief at that point. I got promoted right. That there was\na disabled veteran who hadn\u2019t gone to college, but he was a veteran and he would qualify with\nhis 15 points for the job I had. And so again I lost a job and got into a category of simply sitting\nthere and writing with a hundred other people in the same category. Instead of being the local\ngenius I was the bottom of the pile, ok. Then I had another child. I was pregnant and, boy. My\nson and those are the only children I have. I have seven grandchildren.",
        "Q: You stayed in the Washington area? From then on?",
        "A: Well after a while my marriage to Chris sort of disintegrated. It was my fault. Somehow,\neventually I could no longer take it. He was just too \u2014 he kept saying I didn\u2019t speak to him the\nway a wife should et cetera. And I kept saying anyhow, I was earning a lot more than he was.\nAnd whatever. After a while I could no longer take the difference in personality and background.\nHe was a party guy and I would, we would be working all day long and I would come home and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nhe would have invited 40 people to come over and cook and eat and drink in our basement. My\nparents had given me down payment for a house in Arlington, off Lorcom Lane. And we built\nout the basement and had parties all the time. And it, the weight of it all got too much for me.\nBetween the racial thing and the difference in views and what not. I could take it no longer.\nAnd Medicare was enacted and I was again in one of those positions and I got transferred. I had\napplied for a transfer to San Francisco where a friend of mine had moved and had inherited a\nhuge mansion or something. But they said the only vacancy was in Baltimore, that Medicare had\nstarted. They needed a lawyer in \u2014 to interpret the Medicare law and so I moved to Baltimore.\nAnd Catonsville.\nAnd general counsel and me were not a good fit. General counsel means that you spend your\ntime in the library looking at books and deciding things. Instead I liked to handle cases and\npeople and work fast and what not which is not anything to do. So I transferred over and to\nMedicare in the programs. And wound up promoted and what not. And was president of my -- I\nmarried a well-known lawyer in Baltimore who had a trial practice and spent all of my vacation\ntime handling court cases for him at the rate \u2014 they were all in the morning \u2014 at the rate of three\nhours here, three hours there and what not. And had special dispensation to do that and enjoyed\nmy life for a while. I was married to him for 13 years. Until that disintegrated.\nAnd here I am. I was president of the women\u2019s bar association for two times, president of\nCatonsville business and professional women\u2019s club. You name it. I was in the newspaper\nconstantly.\nDaughter: National Organization for Women.",
        "A: Yeah, organization for women. You name it. I was in all those things. And I was being\nviewed for running for, becoming a judge in Baltimore and Bill Gosnell my husband said over\nhis dead body. He was practicing law in the city. He can\u2019t possibly have a wife who, who is a\njudge. And so that ended that ambition.",
        "Q: Then when did you come back to Virginia? When did you come to Virginia?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t. I got divorced and moved to Ocean City, Maryland and lived there 15 years. I retired\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\non early out during Reaganomics. And I think on one third of my salary. I had been in the\ngovernment as a grade 15 I think step three, for as high as one can get without political\nappointment and lived in Ocean City for 15 years. And then I sold my place and moved to be\nclose to my family, all of whom are in Arlington or in Leesburg.\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Erica Laufer. This is track number three. Let\u2019s talk about\nsome of your thoughts and your feelings about what you went through. Do you think about your\nchildhood often now and what you had to go through, leaving your home, going to different\nplaces? Do you think about it more often as you\u2019ve gotten older?\nErica Laufer: Oh yeah. Because once you\u2019re retired you don\u2019t have as much to do so you have\ntime to think about these things. Otherwise, one keeps oneself so busy, one doesn\u2019t think about\nanything. Leave alone anything that might be difficult. ve thought about many times. My\nparents had a chance to go back to Austria and then they did visit. I also was sent something or\nother and unfortunately, any time I see something German or Austrian, I have mixed feelings. I\ndon\u2019t want to give them a penny of my existence. Other than that I don\u2019t think much of them.\nI\u2019m grateful that I\u2019m not living there, that they sent me away. They wanted to exterminate me. I\ndon\u2019t have any \u2014 the thing that bothers me endlessly in my brain is something that is politically\nincorrect. And you can\u2019t ask. The Germans went through people\u2019s history as to how many\ngenerations back they had Jewish blood. And if so, they were sent to concentration camps. How\nare the Germans now that they have their pure Aryan blood? That has been bothering me\nterribly. When the Moors and Jews were thrown out of Spain, we know what happened to\nSpain. It went downhill.\nAnd why hasn\u2019t this happened to Germany yet? All their intellectuals, all their money people.\nEverybody who was anything was Jewish. The men all tried to marry a blond girl, as non-Jewish\nas possible, if they possibly could. What\u2019s happened to those children? Were they all sent to\nconcentration camps? Did they wind up in Argentina, New York, Israel?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nMy father\u2019s sister Clara and her daughter Vera, my favorite cousin, were in concentration camps.\nThey apparently survived and were sent to Israel. In the last days of concentration camp, Vera\nmarried a fellow from the concentration camp. However, she became pregnant in Israel and he\nsaid he had never had a life. He had had no youth. Had nothing. He didn\u2019t want to be burdened\nwith a wife and children. And that was the last heard from him, I understand. She went insane\nfinally and she habitually would run through the streets stark naked. They would arrest her and\nput her in a, whatever it is. And my father would send money for, or for some medicine that\nwould temporarily make her sane. I don\u2019t know what happened to them. Eventually they,\nsomebody, maybe it was her mother, grandmother.\nBut her son, the son wanted to go to technical school and they didn\u2019t have money and my father\nsent money for him to go to technical school. After that my father died in 1975. My mother I\nthink tore up everything she could possibly find, where there were any knowledge of anybody\nelse. She says all they want is money from you. So I have no way of knowing other relatives.\nObviously I have some in Israel. I obviously have some in Sweden. Unless they have all gone\nback to somewhere else. Who knows? Cause I don\u2019t know where Freddie wind up. Men usually\ndie earlier than women, but he may still be around somewhere. But I saw some photograph when\nI was doing, I was doing a history of the family. And I came across a picture of Freddie and his\nchildren and his wife. But that was something in Germany. I don\u2019t know if they were just on\nvacation or what. I don\u2019t know where these people are. I don\u2019t have any relatives. I didn\u2019t really\ncare. I never thought about them. I agreed with my mother. Forget about them. But my children\nkeep wanting to know do we have relatives, some. My grandchildren. Do we have relatives in\nsome other country? Where are they? Who are they? I don\u2019t know. And I guess I\u2019ve got to find\nout before I die. I\u2019m already 82.",
        "Q: Do you know how many relatives you definitely lost?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. Well over 60, I guess. I don\u2019t know if any of them rescued themselves or not.\nNever heard of them.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "Q: When your children were the age that you were when conditions got bad and you had to\nleave, you know Hitler got into power and you had to leave. When your children were that age,\ndid that make you think back on your childhood at that time?",
        "A: No, I never thought back. I never thought back until old age, never thought back. I did what\neverybody else does. Just remove it from your brain.\nSince I\u2019m retired, not before. Because I have time.",
        "Q: And also with your parents, just to repeat what you said, you did not really discuss war years\nwith them.",
        "A: My parents never mentioned it again. Ever. Not in my presence.",
        "Q: Did you try to ask them?",
        "A: No, no we all agree the same thing without discussing it. Forget it, forget about it. It\u2019s gone.\nYou can\u2019t bring it back. It was no good. Why waste your effort on it. Think of what you\u2019re\ndoing now.",
        "Q: Have you been back to Austria?",
        "A: I went back only once, when the children were very small. Roy was still on baby bottles and\nbut only because we were going to India because Chris wanted to see his uncle who had raised\nhim who was sick and old or something. And we stopped off in London where we always had\none of my mother\u2019s cousins lived there. Always long before the war and all that. Alice. She\nlived there. And we stopped off to see her.\nAnd stopped off in German Switzerland. And went to Vienna. We went, I wanted to go to\nKlagenfurt but it was snowing and there was -- it was six hours by train and the train couldn\u2019t go\ncause the tracks were full of snow. And we spent, no airplane could leave Vienna airport. And\nthere I had a little overactive son and a daughter at Vienna airport. And we couldn\u2019t go. We were\nstuck there for days at the airport. And finally I let them run loose and he did what boys do. He\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nran up to the conveyor belt and played with the conveyor belt and within minutes somebody\ncame and said Madame, we do not let our children run loose in \u2014 perhaps in America. And so I\ntook the cue and said oh but I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve been here for so\nlong. What can I possibly do, I can\u2019t control them. Within minutes they found us a plane to get\nus out of Vienna.\nI think it was to Egypt. And from there we would go to India. Unfortunately, there seemed to\nhave been some problem on the plane, because we all had to depart, stand in the middle of\nnowhere and they brought our luggage next to us. And we had to stand next to the luggage.\nNothing seemed to happen. The luggage went back on. Everybody got back on the plane. And\nthey said it would be I don\u2019t know, four hours or something before we would leave. Six hours.\nAnd so I left Chris with the children and decided to go to the airport and enjoy it. I thought I\ncouldn\u2019t get back on the plane until it was departing. It was hours and hours at the airport. I\ncouldn\u2019t leave outside. No permission to leave and go outside the airport. But there I was.\nThat was the only time we went, ever went back. A few hours \u2014",
        "Q: What were your thoughts of being in Vienna?",
        "A: Well we went to see, we went to see like tourists. I had no recollection of any of it. Cause I\nnever lived there. We didn\u2019t even go to the first section where we had fled to. And we saw the\npalaces. We saw the palaces and I remember little boy had to go to the bathroom and I asked,\nthere were 200 rooms in the palace, magnificent palace. Where is the bathroom and he said\nthere\u2019s only one in the tower.",
        "Q: Did you feel a sense, any sense of belonging in Austria?",
        "A: No, no it was the same thing as if I had visited France or China or --",
        "Q: Do you feel Austrian?",
        "A: Apparently I had lost my accent because when we were in German Switzerland, somebody in\na taxi had stolen a little case in which we had stuff. And I reported it to the front desk in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nGerman. We were in German Switzerland. And the man did what, unbelievable, insisted he call\nthe gendarmes and police finally came and he said Madame, perhaps come from Chicago. There\nis no crime in Switzerland. Only financial. Ok, no I had no desire. The Swiss food was\ndelicious. I will say, German Swiss food, we thought it was delicious. The English food was not\ngood I thought. But no I had no desire for any of it.",

        "A: They did me a big, big favor as I\u2019ve been told many times from other people. If people had\nlived in Austria, they never would have had the opportunity that we have in the United States.\nYou know we immigrants are the most patriotic Americans there are.",
        "Q: So you consider yourself American?",
        "A: Oh absolutely.",
        "Q: Not Austrian?",
        "A: Oh no, no. I\u2019ve become very angry at people who tell me that they\u2019re Irish or, or Czech or\nsomething. How can you be? You were born in this country. If you feel you\u2019re, you\u2019re Irish or\nItalian, they\u2019re always telling me they\u2019re Italian. Go back, go to Italy.

        "Q: If you meet a German today in public, what are your thoughts?",
        "A: That he\u2019s German. And that he\u2019s a Nazi.",
        "Q: You do feel that way?",
        "A: Yes. I will always feel that way. They keep talking about oh they, they, they couldn\u2019t do\nanything else about it. And they\u2019re in that kind of a country. And there was no, whatever it 1s,\nthis that and the other and so on. No. No. The day after Austria was, was annexed, everybody\nknew the national anthem. No, they were all Nazis. They were Nazis before they became\nofficially Nazis. No, every last one of them. There is no such thing.",
        "Q: Are you angry that you had an uprooted childhood whereas other children your age were very\nsafe in the United States?",
        "A: No I feel blessed by it. ve had so many interesting experiences. Instead of being one of those\nboring people.",
        "Q: You\u2019re not angry, as I said that your safety was \u2014",
        "A: Not at all, not at all. \u2019'm glad I\u2019m not where they didn\u2019t want me. I\u2019m glad where I could\ncontribute. I have worked for the government. I did work that I think was very, very valuable,\nvery helpful to the public.",
        "Q: Because of your family history and again what you went through having to leave Austria and\ngoing to Trinidad and then coming here, and not speaking the language and so forth, did that\naffect how you raised your children?",
        "A: Well I was raised in a very strict Prussian style. Children were seen but not heard or hopefully\nnot seen very often either. Raise yourself and shut up. Don\u2019t get us in trouble. Don\u2019t do\nanything that raises any problem. We\u2019re not here for you. Very simple. No, I, when I see how\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nthey raised their children or how my grandchildren are raised, they\u2019re just a bunch of spoiled\nbrats. Their parents spend all their time, their mother and father spend all their time on them.\nInstead of telling them go outside and play and shut up. What do you mean you don\u2019t\u2019 want to\neat this? Eat this or you don\u2019t get anything.",
        "Q: But my question was did it, did your background affect the way you raised your son and\ndaughter do you think? Because there were times when you had to be independent. You went to\nthis boarding school and you had to come home, go back to visit your parents. You were a child.\nYou were very independent.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did that affect how you raised your children?",
        "A: I expected them to be independent too, yeah. This one here would go to school and she\nwanted to belong to Girl Scouts. I told her to call up a taxi and have a taxi pick her up and take\nher to the, in those days it wasn\u2019t dangerous to have your taxi pick you up.\nDaughter: She neglected us.",

        "Q: I\u2019m saying is it because you had to be independent when you were so young.",
        "A: Yeah, I thought that was normal. I thought that was a normal way of raising people. That\nthey need, life is, can be full of hell. You better be able to handle it.

        "A: My mother was born in Berlin, Germany and my father was born in someplace near Krakow,\nPoland. I believe at that time it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.",
        "A: Apparently his parents and him moved to Vienna and my mother and her parents apparently\nmoved to Vienna. And they both worked during the day. It was so modern. They took French\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nclass at night time. That used to be the way to meet people, study French conversation. And they\nmet there as a result. In Vienna.",
        "A: Yeah, but not off hand. My father was born November 14th, 1898. My mother was born May\nthe seventh of 1905.",
        "A: 1898.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I\u2019m an only child.",
        "A: Well in Austria, he had a limited education. And he was a support of a large family. And he\nwas working. When I was born he was in Klagenfurt working as a window dresser for the only\ndepartment store in town. My mother had been sent to be a, to learn how to become a master\nmilliner and she was an apprentice for I believe seven years. They had the guild system in\nAustria and she was a master milliner. And as a result she had a store where she made hats and\nhad four apprentices working for her. Meanwhile, they lived in a flat. We lived on the second\nstory and they always had every year, a different girl, peasant girl would come from Yugoslavia,\nCzechoslovakia, some such place, for a one year contract and up, upstairs, there was another\nfamily and Herbert was a little boy who played with me. He was a year younger than me and if\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nwe wanted to play we would push the broom on the ceiling or the floor as to whether or not we\nwanted to play.",
        "A: I haven\u2019t got the faintest clue. It had a yard and it had a big, big peach tree which Herbert and\nI one day attacked and ate a great deal of peaches when they were not ripe. And were sick for\ndays and got very much punished. It had a very nice yard that we could use to our heart\u2019s\ncontent. And I don\u2019t know goose, by the name of Pauline. And we would sit on a bench. It was\nvery pleasant. Lots of plants and trees and things around there.",
        "A: I have no idea. It couldn\u2019t have been a Jewish neighborhood. My mother wouldn\u2019t have\nwanted that. And certainly, Herbert certainly wasn\u2019t. And as far as I know, I was the only Jewish\nchild in the entire school.",
        "A: Oh. I don\u2019t know. One thinks one knows things but one doesn\u2019t necessarily know. One\ndoesn\u2019t know what it is that one remembers or what one thinks one remembers. I remember\nbeing taught by nuns. I have no idea whether the public schools in Klagenfurt were run by nuns\nor whether that was a Catholic school. My mother liked to deny her Jewishness and tried to tell\nme that her parents, her mother Julie Hotzel was Catholic. But I\u2019m not too sure about that. I sort\nof doubt it. But anyhow, I went to school and I was the only Jewish child there. My father\ninsisted that I not attend class during Catholic training. As a result I recall spending my time out\nin the school yard, even in the fall and the winter for the hour that they had the daily religious\ntraining.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nThe nuns didn\u2019t like me and they thought that I was slow witted and insisted that I be trained to\nlearn how to read and how to do math. I was very slow and I seem to recall sitting in front of the\nroom in disgrace all the time.",
        "A: Oh my father was very observant. Oh yes he was conservative. And oh no, he was \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, absolutely. I can still rattle off Manishstana Chalala Chased [ph]. Of course. And\nhe convinced my mother to light the Shabbos candles and she would cook carp and all the\nspecial foods and all that, yes. Yes, my father was very tolerant of this but he prayed daily and \u2014",
        "A: Excuse me.",
        "A: I have no idea what they did. I think everybody had to. I don\u2019t think in Austria you had any\nchoice.",
        "A: As a small child?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t have any recollection. I don\u2019t have many recollections because let\u2019s see we left\nwhen I was eight years old. And it was quite traumatic. And \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: It wiped out a lot of memories I would otherwise have perhaps.",
        "A: No, no. I don\u2019t recall having had any other friend other than Herbert upstairs and his baby\nsitter or whatever you call them, nursemaid, housekeeper and my \u2014 we would go out together\nlike going skating and what not. And \u2014\nDaughter: How about Freddy?",
        "A: Oh no those were relatives. They frequently came to see us. My father\u2019s family frequently\ncame to see us, from, I don\u2019t know from where they were. I don\u2019t know whether they were in\nKlagenfurt or whether they were in Vienna or where they were. But my favorite cousin Vera\nwas very glamourous, very beautiful. A few years older than me. And my father had a sister by\nthe name of Stella and she \u2014 they were all in Vienna I guess. The time I saw them frequently was\nafter we had to move to Vienna. Other than that I, we got photographs of them visiting us 1n our\nplace in Klagenfurt.",
        "A: Well my mother\u2019s parents were retired. I have no idea what they did before. But they moved\nto Klagenfurt to be near my mother and me. And every day when I went to school, my father\nwould take me, walk me to school. I would run after him because he walked so fast and my\ngrandfather, my mother\u2019s father, Otto Schwartz would pick me up after school. And take me\neither to the candy store to get one piece of candy or else to the coffee houses where he would sit\nand sip coffee and read international newspapers. Then they would take me to the little shop that\nthey had. It was no larger than this room here. And they had imported fabrics, beautiful fabrics\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nfrom Scotland or what not. Wools for hand tailoring suits. Julie, his wife, would run the shop. He\nsat up front, outside, rolling cigarettes and translating German into Esperanto.",
        "A: Yeah, that was the only language.",
        "A: Never. Yiddish was basically done by southern Europeans, people who could speak German\nor spoke German. They were rather prejudiced against Yiddish. Ok? No one ever spoke\nYiddish. It was looked down upon.",
        "A: Before, yeah, ok. There we were one day, I\u2019ve told this to my daughter several times. One\nday suddenly, there were troops in Klagenfurt. And I went to school and they sang Deutschland,\nDeutschland uber Alles [ph] and the miracle was that everybody in the class knew all the words\nand how to sing it. And then they were doing Heil Hitler. And they all knew how to do these\nthings. It was very \u2014 day after Anschluss. Annexation in English. And I recall one of my friends\nin class, Herta, she kept raising her hand cause she wanted to go to the bathroom and the teacher\nthought she was saying Heil Hitler too much and wouldn\u2019t let her go. And next thing you know\nshe evacuated (laughs) right there in class and we all laughed and the nun was very, very angry\nat us. (laughs) Ok.",
        "A: Now wait a minute. I\u2019m getting to that. And when I went home, when I got home, the\nbabysitter, housekeeper, whatever she was, took me downtown. And there was this man. This 1s\nmy recollection. There was this man with a funny hairdo and funny moustache and a uniform\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nand he was screaming and shouting and everybody was Heil Hitler-ing. The next day or the\nsame day, almost immediately, Herbert came to see me and said his mother said we could no\nlonger play together. He was forbidden to talk to me. The school told me, I could no longer go to\nschool there. Dr. Strife the pediatrician said he could no longer treat us. And then a short while\nafter that, an edict came that everybody who was Jewish had to resume or acquire a Jewish or\nHebrew name and wear a yellow star. And everyone had to leave and move to the first section,\nAsta Bitzerk [ph] of Vienna. Find relatives or anything to go there and so we moved into the\nsmall flat of my father\u2019s father, Shmeil Laufer was his name. I think he went by Samuel. But his\nname was Shmeil. His wife had died a number of years earlier, Esther. She had died earlier. And\neverybody descended on this little apartment. It was on one of the upper floors. Flats they called\nthem in those days.",
        "A: Everybody said they couldn\u2019t deal with us.",
        "A: I, just total confusion. That\u2019s what, I don\u2019t really recall other than total confusion like what in\nGod\u2019s name is happening.",
        "A: No, no troops came to our school.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: No we went. My babysitter or whatever, took me downtown after school and I think it was\nafter school. Anyhow it was in the afternoon and although it doesn\u2019t make sense. But anyhow\nshe took me into town.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall. I don\u2019t\u2019 recall. It wasn\u2019t anything you would see in a, very half rural town you\nknow. It was a very quiet town. You wouldn\u2019t have seen such a thing as troops.",
        "A: Six hours by slow train.",
        "A: Klagenfurt was the capital of Corinthia in the Roman empire. (laughs) Ok. Six hours by slow\ntrain. When we visited Austria many years later, it was still six hours by slow train. (laughs) But\nwhen she was, when my daughter was three years old, when you would go to India.\nDaughter: maybe five or six.",
        "A: It was still six hours by train.",
        "A: [have no recollection. I have no recollection and my next recollection is being in the small\nstuffy apartment with all of these many relatives. My mother was desperate. She finally oh, my\nmother\u2019s story. My mother was a master milliner and had a very successful store as a milliner.\nAnd everyone, all the ladies wore hats all the time in public at that time. So that was very\nsuccessful. Several years earlier she had fired Dora Taya [ph], one of her apprentices because\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nshe was stealing from customers and from the store. And after Anschluss Dora Taya came with\nan SS officer and said for my mother to get out. This now belongs to Dora Taya. No, don\u2019t take\nanything with you. Just go. My mother\u2019s brother, Richard Schwartz, meanwhile had married a\nvery beautiful Catholic girl by the name of Annie. Very stylish, very beautiful, very tall. She\nadvised him to take all the money out of the bank. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen and\nthey put it in, they put it in a paper bag and she said she accidentally threw it in the trash. They\nspent two days at the city dump looking for the money. Of course they never found her and of\ncourse she was seen next with an SS officer as well. I don\u2019t know what happened to Richard or\nmy grandparents at that point, my mother\u2019s family. Until later. I never saw, I know I never saw\nthem again.\nAnd so we moved to Vienna with all the other relatives on my father\u2019s side. And \u2014",
        "A: Oh my mother had, was so happy. She had finally gotten ranbough. She called. It was all\nthe furniture was inlaid and had round corners and she was so thrilled with it. She finally had it\nand of course she couldn\u2019t take that. So I don\u2019t\u2019 know how she did it but in this very small\napartment upstairs in Vienna she had brought the dresser, the dresser with a tall mirror and the\nvanity, whatever you call it. It was not a dresser. It was a vanity with a tall mirror. And every\nday she would dust it and she would be so sad because she had left the rest of the bedroom\nfurniture there. And then being her and dusting every day, one day, it was Saturday, she dusted\nthe vanity. And shook the dust cloth out the window to the horror of from the family because it\nwas the Sabbath. You don\u2019t dust on the Sabbath, ok. Very vivid recollection of her daily\nstroking of the vanity.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. Not long.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: We had to have, we had black curtains in front of our windows so it couldn\u2019t\u2019 be seen from\nthe street. That people were there. And one day let me, every once in a while we would speak\nout and they would get very angry at me for trying to peak out the corner and see what was going\non. And I'd see all these armed boys and marching around.",
        "A: One day there had been an impromptu synagogue next door, downstairs and that was burned\ndown. And thank goodness they put the fire out. They had some kind of impromptu schooling\nas well. And the teachers remarked how, what a good student I was and how brilliant I was.\nAnd I don\u2019t\u2019 know how I suddenly within days became from the village idiot (laughs) to being\nbrilliant, but whatever. Miraculously I suddenly became very intelligent.\nSo there was an impromptu school but it was very crowded there and there was one day it was\nespecially bad. And some SA, SA were the younger fellows, SS were the storm troops. And the\nSA were like scouts, first. They marched also with them and they were of course, being young\nboys, were the most vicious. They came upstairs one day and they were looking for things.\nUnfortunately nobody had anything but they threw some furniture out the window. But then they\nleft. I recall one of them actually looked at me and smiled. I was a little kid, eight years old. I\nhad no idea with a big white bow in my hair.\nAnd after that my father decided we were leaving. And \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. My mother was always in danger of being half hysterical. I have no idea.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: About everything, yes. You know, why me, et cetera, et cetera. And my mother was real\nintellectual or whatever.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know but I have recollections. My mother\u2019s family was, my mother had family in\nVienna who were Christian. And at least they were Christian before the Nazis got hold of them\nand didn\u2019t believe they\u2019re not, their Christianity went sufficient generations back or something.\nAnyhow, I recall going with my father, my mother and me and hiding in doorways, going over to\nthe other section. Taking off the gold, the yellow stars and going in the other section and hiding\nand trying to stay there until the pogroms were over and we could go back home during the day\nor something, and nothing would happen. It, just a recollection of total fright and terror. After a\nwhile the relatives said they couldn\u2019t afford to have us come there anymore of course.",
        "A: that nobody could tell who was a Jew and who wasn\u2019t unless they had a yellow star. You\ncouldn\u2019t tell by looking at them, watching them or anything else.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall. Absolutely don\u2019t recall. Anyhow, there we were and my father said after this\nhappened, a lot of ways and a lot of broken things. And",
        "A: I guess that\u2019s what it was, yeah. He said we\u2019re leaving and he got tickets. Since we had\nalways lived frugally we were different from all other people. We had enough money, although\nmy father was just a window dresser. My mother, everything she had was taken away. We had\nenough money to go. To buy tickets to go to China, which was willing to take anybody.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nAnd they laughed at him. I remember we were sitting around. There was just one candle and all\nof us sitting around and they were laughing at him.",
        "A: His father and all his relatives as to how could we go someplace where it\u2019s so strange and\ndifferent and we don\u2019t know the language and the custom and they got slanted eyes and yellow\nskin and nobody can understand anything they say, even when they speak German, which 1s true.\nYou can\u2019t understand them when they speak English and they\u2019re speaking English. But anyhow,\nthey made complete fun of him and they said these classic words that he\u2019s being very foolish that\ngod will take care of him. they have lived good lives and god will, good God fearing lives and\nthey, God will, God will take care of them in the form of England and the United States.\nAmerica and England would not let anything happen to them. Ok.\nThey laughed at him and said he was foolish and had no skill, no ability. What would he do?\nAnd he said well his wife makes hats. And we would figure it out. Ok. One of his sisters\napparently had a new husband who had more energy than the other people there and she had a\ndaughter or maybe it was his daughter. I believe it was her daughter. And he said they were\nmoving to Sweden and they laughed at him too. What would he do? And he said he was going to\nmake soap. And I remember they laughed at him. they had to hold their mouths so they wouldn\u2019t\nmake so much noise. They were laughing. So everybody already has soap. Why would they\nneed you to make soap? And what do you know about making soap. Anyhow, there was a big\nkettle. And he proceeded to make soap. He did make soap. Understand they did move to Sweden\nand I understand that the daughter became a nurse. I don\u2019t\u2019 know her name. I don\u2019t know their\nmarried name. I have no idea. I don\u2019t know his name, his father\u2019s name.\nAnyhow, my father also had a sister whose name was also Clara and she had, she was I believe\ndivorced or widowed. I think divorced or whatever. Anyhow she did have a husband. Her\ndaughter, Vera, was my favorite cousin. And they of course had no money to go anywhere. So\nwe were going to leave and go to China. My father went to some kind of a building. I don\u2019t know\nwhether it was a court, or whether it was a government exit visa. I don\u2019t\u2019? know what it was.\nAnyhow, we went there and when he got there it had been occupied and there was a commandant\nsitting there. And there was blood on the wall and he could hear men screaming. And it was my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nfather\u2019s turn and he said he went up and said Herr commandant I am a veteran of World War I. I\nfought on behalf of the Austria-Hungarian Empire. I am a poor man. I am a window dresser\nwithout any skills. I have tickets to China. If you have seen the movie, Good Earth you know\nthat they are so poor that they are even eating earth. Undoubtedly we will be killed there or\nstarve to death or they will kill us or we will die as a result of the civil war they\u2019re in. You don\u2019t05:50:52need us and there\u2019s only me and my wife and my daughter. My small daughter.\nAnd we will, have tickets to leave within two weeks. And the man said, let him go. As far as I\nknow, he was the only person who ever talked his way out of a concentration camp. It\u2019s been\nmy inspiration all my life. Speak up. Ok. Speak up and have something worthy to say.\nAs he went out, a man approached him and said do you want tickets to Port of Spain. My father\nsaid what\u2019s that. He said it\u2019s a British crown colony in the Caribbean and my father said , he\nasked what\u2019s that and the man told him it\u2019s a small island opposite Venezuela that\u2019s owned by\nthe British. And that he had gotten tickets where he wanted to go, namely where everybody\nwanted to go, Argentina. And did my father want his tickets to Trinidad. Of course my father\ntook it. I don\u2019t know whether he paid or had the money or whether it was all free in those days.\nYou could only take a hundred marks, shillings, whatever they had, out of the country. So it\ndidn\u2019t make any money, difference how much money you had or what you spend.\nAnyhow, I remember he came back and said we\u2019re going to Trinidad. And he offered his tickets\nto China to the other relatives who just laughed. I don\u2019t know if eventually they used them or\nwhat. I have no idea. I have no recollection or knowledge of what happened to the relatives after\nthat. Other than Clara.\nAnyhow, we went to, we had to go to Amsterdam. I believe we had 67 relatives when we left.\nAnd we went by train to Amsterdam where we would wait until the ship, the Cotica would come\nand take us on to Trinidad.",
        "A: I have no idea. I have no idea. A small child excited about leaving. And my mother desperate.\nShe had to leave her vanity and her furniture. That I recall.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Oh of course. They were devoted to each other. I mean they were married for 48 years until\nhe died. They argued all the time but they were devoted to each other.",
        "A: Nothing. My parents had two big containers of big, containers in which they had eider downs\nand woolen suits and woolen socks, all of which of course you wouldn\u2019t use in Trinidad which is\ntropical. I forgot about Pauline, my pet goose.",
        "A: Oh. As we were leaving Klagenfurt one day, we were eating a meal. We were having our\ngoing away meal. And I said what\u2019s this? It doesn\u2019t taste like chicken. They said it was Pauline.\nThey ate Pauline, my little goose. That was sad. The things that you remember. You forget most\neverything. I think I\u2019m losing my voice as usual.\nWhere was I? Oh we were going by train to Amsterdam and we were sitting in a compartment\nand there was a man who sat opposite us in the same compartment.",
        "A: 38, yes, yes we left almost immediately. We left almost immediately.",
        "A: We landed in Trinidad in December of 38 so we left almost immediately and we were on this\ntrain and this man was sitting next to us, apparently wanted to talk and he wanted to ask my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nfather how much money was he hiding in his suitcase. And my father was horrified because my\nfather was the most honest person you\u2019ve ever met. Even to people who wanted to kill you,\nexterminate you, he was going to obey what they said. He would never have done anything like\nthat. He was shocked. Anyhow the man said he had emptied his suitcase and he had fixed it so\nthat he had lots of money in there and jewelry or whatever it is. And my father said the only\njewelry we have we\u2019re wearing. There was, I had a little locket. And my mother had a couple of\nbracelets and my father had a watch or something. And I think maybe two gold chains. They\nwere in plain sight. We were wearing them. Anyhow, when we came to the station, the SS agent\ncame and took the man away. I mean they overheard the conversation obviously. And then too\nthe man, the agent looked at me and looked at my little locket and my parents\u2019 chains and watch\nand he just smiled nicely and nodded his head and left with the man.",
        "A: I have no idea. I wouldn\u2019t know an ID paper if I fell over one. We stayed in Amsterdam until\nthe ship arrived. And we were in a hotel room and we were stunned by what we saw. I don\u2019t\nthink they do this anymore but every single morning, I\u2019d look out the window and before it was\ndaybreak we would see housewives scrubbing their steps with brushes. Every single day. They\nwere so clean in those days. Amsterdam was about the cleanest place on the face of the universe.\nEventually the ship came and we went.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I guess we threw it in the trash as fast as we could. Who knows? We didn\u2019t\nkeep it as a souvenir if that\u2019s what you mean.",
        "A: No. no, no, no. No recollection of ever seeing any such thing again.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: It was at least over a week. I don\u2019t recall cause I remember going almost stir crazy. You know\nlittle kid, mother, father, in a small hotel room.",
        "A: Yeah but I have no recollection doing it, yeah. Just strange town, scared place, whatever. No\nrecollection of anything other than the hotel room.",
        "A: Excuse me",
        "A: Cotica.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I would spell phonetically as C-O-K, I don\u2019t know what Dutch did. O-T-T-I-\nC-A. K-A.",
        "A: No. I haven\u2019t been able to trace it on the internet but its name was Cotica and it was a Dutch\nship as far as I know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: Yeah, and then we were on the boat. It was to go from there to Trinidad you had to go past a,\nBiscayne, the cay of Biscayne. The ship, we were first class since we had enough money. All the\nother kids were third, fourth, whatever, steerage whatever, way down there.",
        "A: As far as I know that\u2019s all it was. I don\u2019t know. I have no idea. Yeah it was going to \u2014 who\nelse would go to Trinidad. Why would anybody in their right mind want to go there.",
        "A: Oh yeah, well you know there were others, they would come up. But there were days when\nthe weather was very bad. Iremember going up cay of Biscayne the ship was almost parallel up\nand down, up and down. And of course we were sea sick, throwing up into the ocean which was\neasy since we were first class and we were up on the balcony. After a few days you get your sea\nlegs and you no longer throw up. But yes, there were other children. The adults were taking\nEnglish lessons. Us children, no. and some teenage boy came to see us. There were four or five\nof us. And some teenage boy came and saw us. And we complained that you know we didn\u2019t\nknow any English. What were we going to do when we got there. And the parents all were\nlearning English. And how about us.\nAnd he told us there was one phrase we should use and it would get a big sensation and we asked\nhow do you trans \u2014 and what were the \u2014 oh it\u2019s untranslatable and he says you look at the people\nstraight in the face, look straight in the eye. And smile as much as you can and say shut up. It\ngot a reaction. Ok.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what we talked about. I doubt it. I don\u2019t know. I have no recollection. Nobody\ntalked about anything. Then we got to Trinidad.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know about that. I never heard about it in my whole life.\nThat\u2019s something you got from your grandmother, not from me.\nDaughter: She did a painting of the ghost that you saw on the ship.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. You know, you know more than \u2014 you must repeat this. You must tell Mrs.\nSchwartz about it. Are we related by the way? Are all Schwartzes related?",
        "A: Anyhow we got to Trinidad.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: It was hot. It was unbelievably hot.",
        "A: Trinidad is very close to the equator and coming in December from winter, bitter winter.\nKlagenfurt of course is at the foot of the Alps and being used to snow and ice and what not, to\nget to the tropics. And \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: We were in Trinidad and I believe we spent two weeks or so \u2014 Ah. They had arranged, I\ndon\u2019t know where. Probably the Jewish refugee committee, who knows. I have no idea how it\nhappened. Children don\u2019t ask questions. We were staying with a family. And --",
        "A: Ohno. No, the man was they told me, he told us he was Portuguese. He had very yellowish\nbrownish skin and very curly whitish hair. And his wife was obviously very British with blond\nhair and blue eyes. They had about 12 different children. No two of them had the same shape,\nsize or color. I had never heard of adoption. I don\u2019t know if they were adopted or whether this\nhappens through having enough children with a mixed race, whatever.\nThe youngest ones were pale blond. The oldest ones were much darker, that\u2019s all I know.\nAnyhow we stayed with them for a month. That\u2019s what had been arranged. And then there was\ncarnival or something. I think carnival is in February actually. I don\u2019t know why. But anyhow\nthere was carnival in Trinidad where they go singing through the streets and marching and\ndressed in costume. And singing Mardi Gras and what not and so on.\nThey\u2019d do nothing except sing and dance through the streets. And I ran afoul of the color line\nwhich we knew nothing about because often in Austria, we had never seen anyone. Oh we once\nhad gone to, we once had gone to Vienna and saw a gypsy with a baby. She was nursing a baby\nin the middle of the street, very shocking. Other than that we never saw anybody expect a white\nperson. And in Trinidad there was a -- which we didn\u2019t know there was a color line and we had\nno costume so my mother had, I had dirnd1 skirt and an apron. And my mother put a kerchief on\nmy head upside down, mammy style. And apparently I crossed the color line and caused a\nsensation because a white person doesn\u2019t dress like a black person.\nAnyhow, I don\u2019t know how it happened but my mother immediately got a job in a hat store,\nmaking hats. My mother\u2019s a very nervous woman. And she, we had no place to leave the little\njewelry and money that we had except in her purse.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I guess so cause it was almost immediately. She almost immediately got a job.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nAnd she\u2019s carrying all this stuffin her purse. And she went to the bathroom at work, put the\npurse down on the sink while she was washing her hands and a black man came in and stole her\npurse. She of course could not identify him because not having been there long enough, every\nblack looked like every other black. When you first see Chinese or you think they all look the\nsame after a while you see everybody\u2019s different. Anyhow all she could say he was black. Of\ncourse he was never found.\nWe now had no money, no jewelry which they had hoped to be able to sell. Anyhow, my mother\nworked and she hated black people. All the rest of her life detested them with a passion.\nThought they were all ignorant stupid and black. (laughs) And they were no better than a gorilla.\nShe absolutely detested them. They later had more reason to hate them. But anyhow, she was\nworking there. And in the evening she would, she cut apart our curtains and made I think maybe\na dozen or less little children\u2019s dresses, little fluffy children\u2019s dresses. And my father was --\nnobody would hire him. There was nothing he could do. They found a little hole in the wall and\nselling children\u2019s dresses which my mother had sewed after working all day and they were an\ninstant success.\nThey were very fluffy and ruffle-y and what not and they were a tremendous success. And as a\nresult this got around and wholesalers came to see him and gave him credit so that he was able to\nstart a nice little business selling children\u2019s dresses. And he even put an ad in the newspaper\nsaying delicious little children\u2019s dresses which he sent to my mother\u2019s relatives in New York.\nBecause we were hoping to get a visa to go to New York. My mother could have gone instantly\nsince she was on a German passport. There was an endless ability of any German to enter at any\ntime.\nBut my father since his place had become Poland was on a Polish visa and there weren\u2019t that\nmany Poles in United States at that time and he had to wait until his visa would come up. And he\nshowed, he sent this to show what they were doing in Trinidad. And they never lived down the \u2014\nmy aunt\u2019s husband Alex Cramer. They never stopped giggling and laughing about delicious\nchildren\u2019s dresses.\nMy mother meanwhile opened up her owns store, naturally and was very successful because she\ncreated hats of a kind that they hadn\u2019t seen before. And they were doing very, very well. And\nthen it became time for England to enter World War II, at which point it was said that it\u2019s a\ncrown colony, an oil colony and so they clapped every last refugee into a detention center with\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nbarbed wire all around it. Black guards in white uniforms high socks with bayonets guarding us.\nAnd there we all were in a detention center.\nNot that we were mistreated or anything but every family got one room.",
        "A: Hm.",
        "A: Oh yes. Somewhere in the suburbs I guess. It was apparently a barracks at one time, well\nwhatever, but there we were. As far as I know I was only one who would leave all the time. I\nhad been chosen by Mrs. Lake who had studied in Germany and wanted to practice her German.\nAnd although there were a number of children there, I was the one chosen to be a companion to\nher who was one year younger. A little monster.\nAnd so I got the benefit of a British boarding school education for the two years we were there.",
        "A: Yes I went to a British boarding school. Stayed at the boarding school.",
        "A: Even before then. Almost immediately after we arrived, I was chosen. I never went to\nwhatever schooling they have in Trinidad. It was certainly be segregated. The British would be\nwith British, the Portuguese with Portuguese. The Chinese with Chinese. The black with black,\nthe Spanish with Spanish. No one spoke to anybody outside of their own whatever. They were\ncountless people from India. I don\u2019t recall the women but I remember the men. They were so\nmany of them. They had turbans and were wearing some kind of diaper. And would be sitting on\nthe public steps, all day long. I don\u2019t know why but they would just sit there, old men sitting in\ntheir turbans and sitting on all the public steps.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: I lived at the boarding school.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Oh they had, they had rented a very, very nice house before this happened. It was\nsomewhere on the -- way on the outskirts. It was a very nice little house. Within the first month\nof our arriving there. Because he undid his over, over those wooden crates that you have. He\nover -- he opened up the crates and he took out a saw, hammer and nails and he sawed apart one\nof them to make a table and two benches of the crates. So we instantly had furniture.\nIt was very interesting. There were coconut trees and the houses were, had metal roof,\ncorrugated metal roofs and when it rained, it had monsoons there, rainy season. The coconuts\nwould fall on the roof and went bong, bong, bong, bong. And opposite us there was some guy\nwho had, some man some Indian man who wore just his diaper and a turban and had a goat. And\nthe goat would be there all day long on a chain and say (bleats). I would carry on conversations\nwith the goat. That\u2019s all I remember of that. I don\u2019t remember any children there whatsoever.\nBy the time we were in the detention center there were I think five children. They had duties.\nThey had to sit, decide who would cook and who would clean, who would do what. And \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah they were all Jewish except there was a separate section for one Christian.\nThat was the only one who was a Christian. The chain they couldn\u2019t tell, the British claim they\ncouldn\u2019t tell if some of us might be spies. And that was very important because there was a, an\noil crown colony, besides which I believe the natives didn\u2019t want us there. I think they hated us\nwith a zeal to work. Specifically they all had siestas. They would have a big meal at lunch time.\nEverybody would go home from work and eat and sleep and the refugees were, just continued to\nwork and walk around in the heat of the sun. Nobody would care about whether it was hot and\ncold or whatever. And everybody would make fun of us because of that.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nAnd since nobody had ever seen refugees before and the zeal they have, they assumed it was,\nthat\u2019s the way Jewish people are. Instead of that\u2019s just the way refugees are. People who have\nlived wherever they were, were \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what they did. I know they had their own synagogue and everything else.",
        "A: Oh yeah they instantly had their usual mentality of everything. Synagogue, shops, stores\nwhatever.",
        "A: Hm.",
        "A: Oh yeah sure.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. They do all their lives.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what they did in the detention camp because after a while I would\njust stay in the school and on weekends since I hated having to go to the Anglican church. They\nwent to the Anglican church and I had never been to church before and I was, you had to kneel\ndown at certain times. And Mrs. Lake\u2019s daughters, the oldest ones were in the choir. And I was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\ncertain that if I kneeled down or attended church any minute God would come and lightning\nwould strike me dead. And as I discovered he didn\u2019t.\nI was terrified at the boarding school because we had to sing a certain prayer. Oh there were\nmosquitoes. So you had the mosquito net and you had to say a prayer at night time before you\nwent to sleep. Something about if I should die before I wake I hope the Lord my soul would take.\nSomething, angels at my head and feet. I was terrified to go to sleep. I didn\u2019t want to see these\ndamn angels and I sure didn\u2019t want to see god taking my soul while I was sleeping.\nMeanwhile Valerie, Mrs. Lake\u2019s daughter, the little monster, would have her fun. I couldn\u2019t\nspeak English you see. And in the dead of night, we shared the room. In the dead of night she\nwould get up every once in a while. Out of her mosquito net, come over to my bed while I was\nactually sleeping. See I did sleep and whack me one. And I would scream. I mean I had gone\nthrough a lot. All I need was something like that. I would scream.\nAnd Nanny would come in and she would say that I was had, Valerie would say I had done this\nto her. That Valerie was sleeping and I had done this. And I couldn\u2019t defend myself. I couldn\u2019t\nspeak English.\nSo I had great incentive every single day we had lessons and I would go after I had studied the\nlesson, you go to school all day and then you have to learn your homework and then I had to go\nsee Mrs. Lake every day and recite my homework. And I complained to her. I didn\u2019t know what\nthese words meant. I can\u2019t memorize this. I can\u2019t understand this. Sail-y, gaily be night a Gallic\nnight and sunshine are in shadow when riding along, singing a song. In short what does it mean.\nAnd she said you don\u2019t have to know what something means to learn. Just repeat it often enough\nyou can learn anything. When you are old enough you will know what it means. Unfortunately\nI\u2019m now 82 years old. Ok.\nAnyhow I owe Mrs. Lake a great deal. I learned a huge number of things. I learned how to\nmemorize. I learned how to do mathematics, English and everything else. British history. You\nname it. French. It was an excellent school. Every single day we had lunch and they would\nserve these tropical foods I\u2019d never seen before. Fried bananas. Breadfruit. These horrible things\nas far as I was concerned. Secondly you have to eat it at lunch time, whereas we were used to\nhaving a small lunch and a big dinner. They had these huge lunches after which they took a nap\nand then ate hardly anything at all in the evening.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nI would spend all night long starving to death, crying to myself being so hungry. But at lunch\ntime when they served these foods I would make horrified faces and Mrs. Lake would send me\nout of the room. I had to stand outside where I could see the children so I\u2019d stand outside. And I\nwouldn\u2019t\u2019 get to eat anything the next meal that was served. I had the same food. I had to learn to\neat it without making a face, without dawdling, eating as rapidly as everybody else. And I\nlearned to eat any garbage you put in front of me without making a face.",
        "A: Mrs. Lake\u2019s boarding school, as far as I know.",
        "A: [have no idea, no. But on weekends, since I was so terrified of having to go to this Anglican\nchurch if I stayed there, I said I was homesick. I wanted to see my parents. And it was a two\nhour, two hour ride going by tram and you have to change, transfer in the middle and wait for the\none to get to the detention center. And there was a little girl all by myself going on this open air\ntram, every single weekend. All the way over and all the way back. No one ever spoke to me,\nlooked at me twice. That\u2019s what strict color line does.\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nVolunteer collection interview with Erica Laufer. This is track number two and you are still in\nTrinidad going to school and visiting your family on the weekends, you said. Going by tram,\nyourself. Did you hear me? You were talking about being in \u2014\nErica Laufer: Yeah, Trinidad and going home weekends.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: Yeah and as far as I know there were only about five children, four or five children in the\nwhole camp. And I would, we would be together on the weekend when I got there. And this is so\nstrange. They had an old piano outside. This 1s a tropic with tropical rains and all that. There was\nan old piano outside. Opposite the entrance to the sole Christian. This man looked like a, my\nrecollection, he looked like the classical picture of a German spy. Bald headed or whatever.\nAnyhow he was the nicest man you ever met. He could play the piano. The parents just didn\u2019t\napprove of this, but he would come and play the piano and we would sing along. We were the\nonly people who ever spoke to the man. He was all by himself in there.",

        "A: No, no. Painting, artist, what not, but not musical. My uncle, I understand, Richard, my\nfather\u2019s, my mother\u2019s brother I understand was an understudy at the Vienna Opera, but I don\u2019t\nknow about that. So I was told. I can\u2019t always believe everything my mother said.",

        "A: Other than being hungry all night long and hating the food, having to learn a new language\nand having to memorize all kinds of things. I was miserable. I had no friends. I didn\u2019t play the\nstrange games that they played. Eventually they were knitting sweaters, cocky sweaters or socks\nor something, sweaters for the troops. And I found I could under the wits out of people a certain\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nway get even, by reading. I would sit on the swing and read and knit at the same time. This\nwould annoy the living wits out of everybody around me but I felt I got my revenge that way.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I was desperate to learn because I thought that if I could speak English I could\nexplain that Valerie is doing this to me, instead of me doing it to her. And then I discovered the\ngreat knowledge that one needs to have in life. That truth does not set you free. That the fact that\nyou can speak and say something, no one will believe you against the daughter of the owner.\nAnd so I learned so many things in Trinidad.",
        "A: No, I have no knowledge or recollection. My parents didn\u2019t speak about such things in front\nof children. Secondly, as far as I know, nobody ever talked about anything again. Period. Tried\nto forget it like 1t never happened. And go on with your life from here. And never think as to\nwhat happened in the past. It\u2019s only very recently in my old age that I\u2019ve been ruminating on it.\nEverybody always hid. Now I keep wishing I had asked my mother or my father certain things\nlong before they died, for which I will never have the answer. But nobody ever spoke about it\nagain. They never mentioned Austria or anything.\nMy parents did go back to Austria once after the war. They were offered to come back. They\nwere requested to come back and they went back. But of course you can\u2019t go back again. There\nwere too many memories. My parents drew double social security. They drew social security\nfrom Austria, as a result of having worked there as well as US social security.",

        "A: Yeah, from the upstairs. They were so angry at me because somebody might see that the\nblack curtain was moving. But yes, you could see those things. Of course you could smell the\nsmoke and that would be enough for you to look to see whether you all were going to burn any\nminute.",
        "A: I have no idea. I don\u2019t think people spoke to children. This was a generation where children\nwere not meant to be heard.

You had to stay in this room,\nstudy. You had to go outside and play there. It was very, very strict. But in the summer they had\na place on the water and I went there with them for two weeks one summer. And there was no\nelectricity.

We were at Macy\u2019s and Irene, my mother\u2019s\ndistant cousin, somehow vouched for us and in those days you couldn\u2019t come to the United\nStates unless you had somebody vouch for you, that you would never need one penny from the\nUnited States or from any state or city or anything. Something for some reason they stopped\ndoing. But anyhow in those days you needed that. And aunt Irene, her husband, uncle Alex,\nworked in New York. He checked music to see if that sound was copyrighted. And they\nsponsored us. And she had never worked. And they sponsored us and she said they could only\nsponsor a limited number of people depending on how much money they make, Alex made. And\nmade my parents sign a contract that they would never ask for one penny from them. Regardless\nof what they promised the United States.\nI sort of never forgave aunt Irene for that but that\u2019s a different story. But they had gotten us a one\nmonth rent in a brownstone in Manhattan. It was a huge efficiency and my father pulled out the\ndictionary, encyclopedia, whatever it was. It was orange covered and it showed the flags of all\nthe different countries and what not. And he pulled up the United States and he found out that\nWashington, DC is the capital and that not too far from New York and it didn\u2019t cost that much by\nGreyhound to go from New York to Washington. And he, and it was a small town and since it\nwas the government, they all would be needing hats because of the ladies would be attending\nfunctions and would need to wear a hat. And so it would be a good place for my mother to be a\nmilliner. And they decided to we would move at the end of the month to Washington, DC.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",

        "A: Nothing. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever heard of it. Nothing. I, they discovered my family, my son and\ndaughter discovered that I came through Ellis Island. I swore up and down I never heard of Ellis\nIsland but they showed me where on the internet it shows that we came, got my name, came\nthrough Ellis Island. I don\u2019t know what Ellis Island is. I never saw it but they tell me that\u2019s\nwhere we came and that we came from Argentina, which I don\u2019t\u2019 understand either cause I came\nfrom Trinidad. Children don\u2019t know these things. So now we are in New York. And we\u2019re in, no\nwe\u2019re in New York and we\u2019re at Macy\u2019s and seeing all these sights and it\u2019s snowing outside and\nit\u2019s bitter cold. And my aunt had gotten me without knowing me, had gotten me a snow suit.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nHere I\u2019m ten had a half years old. A snow suit. This dark maroon with snow drops in turquoise\nand a big hood and I looked like a dwarf. That was because it was very, very cold and I don\u2019t\nknow about shoes. I must have had boots. I don\u2019t know but we walked through Macy\u2019s and I\u2019m\ndressed in this weird outfit. And I suddenly got whatever, I started to howl. I cried and cried and\ncried. I wanted a doll. And my mother said you never liked dolls. You hate dolls. And you\u2019re\ntoo old for a doll. But you know I wanted a baby doll. And they said they\u2019re not much money but\neventually they got me a doll just to shut me up. I guess. And of course I never played with it\nagain, but anyhow, that\u2019s a vivid recollection.\nSomehow we had one month, every place we went to we had one month. When we got to\nWashington, DC we had one month, it must have been through the refugee committee I guess. I\ndon\u2019t know. We were staying with a rabbi and his family in northeast Washington. And it was\njust so different again, so very confusing.",
        "A: Yes, we couldn\u2019t have afforded the rent and my parents were anxious to get on with it and not\nhave to be thankful or whatever. And just get on with life. Yes, we were just there for a month.\nAnd when we had this one month, I think in DC with the rabbi and looked around. And it was\nobviously to my parents not the right neighborhood in which people would be wanting to buy\ndesigner hats, made to order. And discovered a place in Georgetown, which at that time was a\nslum where they rented a building at 1330 Wisconsin Avenue, northwest. That there was a store\ndownstairs and there was a little efficiency upstairs. My parents stayed upstairs and the store had,\nin the back of the store there was a little room which, my mother\u2019s workroom and it had a cot\nand that\u2019s where I would sleep at night time. That was my place. They were upstairs, I was\ndownstairs. There was a small refrigerator, an antique one, with a gas refrigerator with a motor\non top of it.\nAnd one day apparently the gas, my mother was always very, she couldn\u2019t do anything. Oh, her\nhusband had to do everything. Everything was such a crisis. Couldn\u2019t do anything at all. One day\nthe gas leaked and this person who could never do anything, somehow called the authorities, had\nthem remove the thing and got a new refrigerator.\nBy the time my father came home, we had a new refrigerator. Ok.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: It was just there were three schools next to each other. It was just a block and a half away.\nNot on Wisconsin Avenue, but the side street and it was Addison high, Addison Curtis and\nHyde. Two of them were elementary schools and one of them was a school for bad girls. And\nwe all shared the same playground. And the bad girls learned how to can and cook and iron. And\nI know we went over there too. We learned how to, this was during World War II and we learned\nhow to, we were taught how to iron your husband\u2019s shirt. And how to sew and how to darn socks\nand how to cook Spam and string beans and potatoes and foods, very cheap foods and so on. So\nthat we could manage on your husband\u2019s income.",

        "A: No. No. We had a lot of air raid drills at the school and we would go into the basement and\nsing patriotic songs and being me, I one day raised my hand and got called on and asked why are\nwe in the basement. If there really was an air raid and a bomb dropped on us, we\u2019d be buried\nalive. And the teacher gave me the same reply that people always give to this kind of question\napparently. Just keep quiet and keep singing.\nI\u2019ve heard this so often in my life. I would ask a question so basic and always got that type of\nresponse. So all life has been a learning thing. I was picked on mercilessly. They called me the\nlittle Hitler. Because I was German.\nAnd of course the only one in the school and of course the only Jewish person within miles\naround. As far as I know. And I was not ever going to tell anybody that I was Jewish again. I\nhad enough in Austria where It was out there when they were in a nice warm classroom and I\nhad to be outside all by myself in the snow and what not so I wouldn\u2019t have my brain filled up\nwith Catholicism or whatever.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nSo I said nothing. I was picked on mercilessly. They played games like dodge and it finally\noccurred to me that they really wanted to hit me as hard as possible. So I would refuse to play\nand remembered what I had done in Trinidad and I would sit during recess and I would sit and\nread. You won\u2019t believe this at ten years old, ten and a half, I would read Plato and all the\nclassics. The others could barely read. They were American students and the education system\nwas ridiculous. My parents of course were terrified of authorities. Wouldn\u2019t dream of saying no,\nthat\u2019s not right. The teachers felt I needed to learn now to adjust to learn American history. I\ncould have learned it by reading a book in one weekend. But no, they insisted that I go in class\naccording to my age, instead of according to my knowledge which is far superior having gone to\na boarding school.\nThey were learning adding and subtracting and I was doing algebra. Doing math in my head and\nwhat not. Doing compositions. Anyhow I sat in the back of the room for two years. Teacher said\nI could join in any time I wanted to for whatever I wanted to do and spent my time painting\npictures the whole time, two years.",
        "A: Oh Georgetown was a slum in those days and we would play hide and go seek in buildings,\nhuge, huge, huge buildings. The floor, there were no windows, the doors were wide open. The\nfloor would have holes in it. We would play ghost and what not and I was on the swimming\nteam, having learned how to swim. I was on the swimming team and we had swimming thing\nagainst whatever the major schools in northeast and they disabled me almost instantly by kicking\nme in the stomach after we dived in.\nBut anyhow, I was on this -- I went to the playground. We never had anybody watching me after\nwe came to the United States. I spent all my time after school. I would go to the library and read\nbooks every single day until it was time to come home and eat dinner. And in the summer I\nwould go to the playground. Georgetown playground was just a few blocks away and did crafts\nand what not.\nAnd fended off boys who kept saying annoying things to me. No longer picking on me.

I\nthink she lacked sufficient stomach acid or something and this would cure her. They had nothing\ncomparable in the United States. I haven\u2019t been able to find it on the internet.

        "A: Yeah, oh I was on the swim team and I had a good friend by the name of Audrey. Very, very\npretty girl who was also a very, very good swimmer. And I remember being shocked going to\nsee her in their apartment as to how many people there were who slept all in one bed. And how\nlittle they had. Anyhow, next thing you know it was World War II and sailors would come home\non the weekend and you couldn\u2019t go downtown to the movie houses without the sailors were and\nsoldiers were lined up on the street like four deep, trying to pick up any girl that walked by,\nscreaming after them. Anyhow, next thing you know little Audrey was pregnant. And she asked\nme whether I knew where babies came from and I said of course. I had no idea.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nNo idea whatsoever. I foolishly went home and asked my mother. And she went why do you\nwant to know. And I said well Audrey says she\u2019s going to have a baby. I thought my mother was\ngoing to throw up on the floor. She was so shocked. Within I think a month or weeks, she had\nfound a house to buy in Petworth, a row house, all the way across town. I remember my father\nbeing stunned. How would you have money for a down payment on a house? And she had done\nthat. My father had never gone to a grocery store and she had. He would -- she worked and she\ngave him all her money and he would take care of it as was the ancient method. And he would\ngive her grocery money and she would skimp off the grocery money to such an extent that she\nhad enough for a down payment on a house. And he wanted to know how would they pay for this\nevery single month and she said they would rent out the apartment they were living in now and\nshe had her store. And he had an income by now too. And they would be able to do, and they\nwould rent one or two rooms in the house. I could sleep on the sofa. And they would rent enough\nwhere they would pay for the utilities and the mortgage.\nShe had read a book that\u2019s called How To Make a Million Dollars in Your Spare Time in Real\nEstate. And she took that as a recipe and followed every last word of it. Toward the end they\nowned six houses.\nShe could never get my father to do that because every penny he had, by that time he had a\nuniform shop. And every penny he had he stuck into the uniform shop. I would work there on\nSaturdays. He would go on shopping trips for his store to Philadelphia or New York. Mostly\nPhiladelphia and would take me along and I would try on the uniforms and see which were\ncomfortable and which ones didn\u2019t wrinkle and which ones looked very stylish and as a result he\nhad very stylish uniforms. And the wholesalers made a lot of money telling people which\nuniforms had been proven to be the most comfortable and the most stylish. They were selling\nthem all over the place.",
        "A: No, no these were. This was a day of segregation and white \u2014 or black women couldn\u2019t be in\na white neighborhood without being in a uniform. And besides which you wouldn\u2019t want to see\nthe clothing they wore. It would be too risqu\u00e9 or too dirty or too weird. By our taste. And you\nwouldn\u2019t want to have one of them walking through your neighborhood because they would be\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nin great danger probably, undoubtedly. And so they all had to have a uniform. So he had a shop\nin a black neighborhood on seventh street and (sigh) which had uniforms, ladies uniforms. And\nthen he also took in for pretty white fluffy blouses and then he took in white stockings and then\ndressy stockings for holidays and so on.\nAnd I would go there on Saturdays and help him.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. Probably junior high. I would go there and I was so shocked. Little black girls\ncame in. They looked like they were ten or eleven with boyfriends who would buy them fancy\nstockings and the girls would act so thankful to the boys. And the boys were so nonchalant. I\nbecame so disgusted with the whole thing. I hated it.\nThe moment I was 15 I got a underage permit and I got a, I was able to get a job at a department\nstore as a sales lady. For the summer. I didn\u2019t tell them that I was going to go back to school.\nThey just assumed I was one of the many girls who stopped working, I mean stopped going to\nschool and was working. And so I got a job, at a very nice department store. And two months\nlater my parents insisted that they were going on vacation. A friend of theirs, a man who had a\nshop across the street. His brother had a place up in Akwar, New York in the Poconos and\ninsisted I go with them for a week because the man had a son by the name of Harold that they\nwanted me to meet.\nAnd of course I hated him at first sight. And when I came back after the week up in the\nmountains, Lansburgh\u2019s said that they didn\u2019t need me anymore that my job was gone. So I got a\njob at a five and ten a block or so further down. Kresge\u2019s five and ten. And I was in the\nbasement. They put me to selling, counting a hundred marbles and putting them in a sack. A\nhundred marbles to the bag, all day long. And I, there was a curtain there between this and the\nstore and I would sit as far in the curtain as I possibly could because there was a black man who\nworked the stock room.\nHe was big and I was terrified of him. I had never been this close to a black man before. I was\nterrified of him. Anyhow \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nA; Oh yeah. I went through high school, college and law school. And secretarial school and half\nway through a master of laws. Yes.",
        "A: Oh no, at this time, yeah I was sure I went back. I was in the, it was so interesting. I was in\nthe basement of the five and ten and then they transferred me to selling goldfish and I was\nopposite a lady, a very old lady who painted Polaroid photographs. And I learned from her in my\nspare time which is much, how to paint on photographs, a very good skill that came in handy\nmany years later.\nAnyhow, from there they transferred me upstairs, next to the entrance, selling wall paint. And\none day a sailor came in and I was very sheltered you understand. I had not ever gone out or\nanything. And he came over and he wanted to meet me later, as soon as I got off, and proceeded\nto tell me what he wanted to do. And like an idiot I opened up my purse and took out a day\u2019s\nworth of wages, five dollars, handed him the five dollars and said here go buy it on ninth street.\nIt\u2019s just two blocks over. Ninth street was a red light district. He took my five dollars. A short\nwhile later the lady who was the floor walker walked over and said I was fired for being uppity\nwith the customers. I found out later he was her son home on leave.\nI never mentioned anything about the five dollars or what he had said because I knew I wouldn\u2019t\nbe believed.

        "A: Oh no, oh no. my father wanted me to open up a chain store and I didn\u2019t want any part of that\nkind of business. By that time he had moved up to 14\" street to a better neighborhood, so called\nfor a while. And I wanted no part of selling and I wanted to go to New York school of fashion\ndesigning. And my mother said over her dead body would I leave the house until I was married.\nSo my father said that he had been supporting his family at a much younger age. He saw no\nreason why they should support me. But anyhow they finally decided they would give me one\nyear of any education that would then make me financially independent and I could then do\nwhatever it is I wanted to do with my whatever.\nOne of the problems was in high school 1n those days people were very insecure. We all were\nsure we were going to die as a result of an atomic bomb from the Russians. And everybody got\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nmarried. It seemed everybody was engaged, including me in high school, ready to get married\nthe day they got out of high school.\nAnd we decided on McLafin school for medical and legal secretaries. One year of learning how\nshorthand, typing, blood tests, urinalyses, biothermies, all the systems of the human body, et\ncetera. Very, very intense for one year. Upstairs, two rooms. And I learned how to take blood\ngive blood, do all these things. Look at microscopes, count how many blood cells there are et\ncetera. And then after I graduated I got a job. They gave me a job for the summer for some\nphysician, Dr. Goldstein. While his nurse was in England on a three months honeymoon. And I\nworked there and learned I would never again work for a physician in my entire life, that they\u2019re\ntotal phonies and what not.\nAnyhow I then got a job with the American Trucking Association which was a lobby for the\ntrucking industry in the legal department. And the men would come in at 10:00 with their hats\non, sit down at their desk, smoke a cigarette and read the paper and send me out to get coffee and\nhave me doing typing and shorthand and what not. And I soon realized that I could do what they\nwere doing a lot better than what I was doing. And saved my money. Needed all the money I\ncould. I had to work for two years to pay for dental work. I had never had dental work, shoes,\nfeet and what not. I had all kinds of disabilities that nobody had enough money for.\nAnd after that decided I would, I didn\u2019t know I had the brains for it, but I decided to I went to\nGeorge Washington University and they said I didn\u2019t have the requirements to get to college. I\nhad decided in high school to enjoy myself. And not take geometry. I dropped geometry and\nalgebra two and physics, what not. And enjoyed myself in high school, instead of studying.\nCause I thought I was going to marry Ralph as soon as I got out, but instead broke up with him.\nBut anyhow, as a result I didn\u2019t have the requirements. They told me I could go as a non-degree\nstudent and if I got good grades, when I was 21, I could petition that my grades be counted and\nmiraculously I got all A\u2019s. I went all the way through college and got all A\u2019s and one D. The D\nwas in sociology, criminology and sociology of the criminal. I just wanted to throw them all in\njail and throw the key away instead of mollycoddling them.\nBut anyhow, all the rest of them I got A\u2019s and I became Phi Beta Kappa which was an honorary\nsociety. I requested a scholarship the last year. I was working during the day and going to night\nschool or other years when I had enough money going to day school and I mean I would go to\nschool during the day or at night, depending on which I had money for. And one year, the last\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nyear I won the scholarship and they told me my father made enough money to send me through\ncollege. And I said my father refuses to send me to college. He believes that women have no\nbusiness being in college. They should be married and having children. And that if I got an\neducation I would limit my choice of how many husbands, for a husband and he was adamantly\nopposed to it. They didn\u2019t care about that. But the head of the political science department said\nif I would switch my major to political science, they needed a secretary. I could work there three\nafternoons a week and I would, they gave me a scholarship of 150 dollars which in those days\nwas something. And between that and working for him in the school I was able to pay for my last\nyear of college.\nAnd then I was working as a secretary, got good wages, I finished and I thought gee I got all A\u2019s\nand what not. I tried to get a job and I was, couldn\u2019t find a job. The only job I could get was as a\ntypist for the Congressional Record. A reduction of what I was making as a secretary. By that\ntime I was a cracker jack secretary, legal secretary and I was so shocked that you could get all\nA\u2019s, show that you had the ambition to work your way, pay for it yourself, and nevertheless\ncouldn\u2019t get a job. I walked across the campus to law school and said I would like to apply to\nbecome a lawyer. And the gal there said to fill out this form and she saw my Phi Beta Kappa key\nand she said it wouldn\u2019t be any problem at any rate. No tests, no anything. Ok so I went to law\nschool and worked as, for lawyers. One year I went to the most outstanding law firm 1n\nWashington. They had an ad for -- two ads, one for a law clerk and one for a secretary and I\napplied for a secretary. And they gave me an IQ test and refused to hire me because they said\nmy IQ was as high or higher than the lawyers.\nAnd I said so that means I can really help them and they said no, this would be too confusing so I\nsaid well how about the job you have a job as a law clerk. Oh no. We don\u2019t hire girls for that. I\nsaid well if my IQ 1s so high then I\u2019m going to law school. They said that would confuse\neveryone. There\u2019s -- absolutely not.\nSo I became a women\u2019s libber very soon.",

Unfortunately I had to\npass the bar within less than a month after school was out. And the DC bar at that time was three\ndays ordeal. Three solid days of writing without stopping. I thought I knew everything since I\nknew where the court houses were, the judges, since I had composed wills and contracts and I\nknew everything about it. I thought oh well I can whiz through it in no time.\nUnfortunately I flunked the law exam on contracts, a course in which I had gotten an A. I\nflunked it. I sat through this law exam. My mind was blank. I had writer\u2019s cramp. I couldn\u2019t even\nconcentrate. Anyhow within a week of having taken that exam I also took the federal service\nentrance exam as back up. And I practically passed that barely within two points or something.\nBut was picked up by the veterans administration because, not because my score was high\nbecause everybody else had a higher score since they had studied for a year.\nBut because I had worked for a doctor and gone through McLaflin\u2019s medical school, I knew one\nbone from the other. I knew the blood systems. I knew all this stuff backwards and forwards and\nthey were doing disability and they were rating disability of veterans. And people on social\nsecurity and old age and so on. So they hired me.\nAnd they couldn\u2019t promote me fast enough. They thought I was a genius. I got one promotion\nafter the other.

        "A: Yeah so I had a child, yes. And you can imagine how unique this was. Well first of all there\nwere only five people in my law school graduating class out of a couple hundred.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nDaughter: I thought there were two.",
        "A: No, there were five. In the law school. We would meet in the ladies room. We would dash in\nthe ladies room to hide from the guys. The guys were so angry at us because we were in law\nschool. It wasn\u2019t usual in those days. It was so rare.",
        "A: Yeah, I had a son a few years later. But I brought the baby into the office cause they\u2019d given\nme a shower and the women were very angry at me for politicking. I want to show them. This is\na beautiful baby I have as a result of a shower. But anyhow, I came back to work very soon.\nChris got his PhD and I came back to work, very, very soon. And kept getting promoted. And\nthen word came, this is the veteran\u2019s administration. Only veterans should have jobs as long as\nthere\u2019s a veteran available. And so I was out of a job. And I found a job at Central Office where\nthey didn\u2019t have this requirement at that point. And I was drafting letters for the signature of the\ncommissioner of social security as to the final whatever it is to congressmen. And I got promoted\nand then the word came and I was section chief at that point. I got promoted right. That there was\na disabled veteran who hadn\u2019t gone to college, but he was a veteran and he would qualify with\nhis 15 points for the job I had. And so again I lost a job and got into a category of simply sitting\nthere and writing with a hundred other people in the same category. Instead of being the local\ngenius I was the bottom of the pile, ok. Then I had another child. I was pregnant and, boy. My\nson and those are the only children I have. I have seven grandchildren.",
        "A: Well after a while my marriage to Chris sort of disintegrated. It was my fault. Somehow,\neventually I could no longer take it. He was just too \u2014 he kept saying I didn\u2019t speak to him the\nway a wife should et cetera. And I kept saying anyhow, I was earning a lot more than he was.\nAnd whatever. After a while I could no longer take the difference in personality and background.\nHe was a party guy and I would, we would be working all day long and I would come home and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nhe would have invited 40 people to come over and cook and eat and drink in our basement. My\nparents had given me down payment for a house in Arlington, off Lorcom Lane. And we built\nout the basement and had parties all the time. And it, the weight of it all got too much for me.\nBetween the racial thing and the difference in views and what not. I could take it no longer.\nAnd Medicare was enacted and I was again in one of those positions and I got transferred. I had\napplied for a transfer to San Francisco where a friend of mine had moved and had inherited a\nhuge mansion or something. But they said the only vacancy was in Baltimore, that Medicare had\nstarted. They needed a lawyer in \u2014 to interpret the Medicare law and so I moved to Baltimore.\nAnd Catonsville.\nAnd general counsel and me were not a good fit. General counsel means that you spend your\ntime in the library looking at books and deciding things. Instead I liked to handle cases and\npeople and work fast and what not which is not anything to do. So I transferred over and to\nMedicare in the programs. And wound up promoted and what not. And was president of my -- I\nmarried a well-known lawyer in Baltimore who had a trial practice and spent all of my vacation\ntime handling court cases for him at the rate \u2014 they were all in the morning \u2014 at the rate of three\nhours here, three hours there and what not. And had special dispensation to do that and enjoyed\nmy life for a while. I was married to him for 13 years. Until that disintegrated.\nAnd here I am. I was president of the women\u2019s bar association for two times, president of\nCatonsville business and professional women\u2019s club. You name it. I was in the newspaper\nconstantly.\nDaughter: National Organization for Women.",
        "A: Yeah, organization for women. You name it. I was in all those things. And I was being\nviewed for running for, becoming a judge in Baltimore and Bill Gosnell my husband said over\nhis dead body. He was practicing law in the city. He can\u2019t possibly have a wife who, who is a\njudge. And so that ended that ambition.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t. I got divorced and moved to Ocean City, Maryland and lived there 15 years. I retired\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\non early out during Reaganomics. And I think on one third of my salary. I had been in the\ngovernment as a grade 15 I think step three, for as high as one can get without political\nappointment and lived in Ocean City for 15 years. And then I sold my place and moved to be\nclose to my family, all of whom are in Arlington or in Leesburg.\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Erica Laufer. This is track number three. Let\u2019s talk about\nsome of your thoughts and your feelings about what you went through. Do you think about your\nchildhood often now and what you had to go through, leaving your home, going to different\nplaces? Do you think about it more often as you\u2019ve gotten older?\nErica Laufer: Oh yeah. Because once you\u2019re retired you don\u2019t have as much to do so you have\ntime to think about these things. Otherwise, one keeps oneself so busy, one doesn\u2019t think about\nanything. Leave alone anything that might be difficult. ve thought about many times. My\nparents had a chance to go back to Austria and then they did visit. I also was sent something or\nother and unfortunately, any time I see something German or Austrian, I have mixed feelings. I\ndon\u2019t want to give them a penny of my existence. Other than that I don\u2019t think much of them.\nI\u2019m grateful that I\u2019m not living there, that they sent me away. They wanted to exterminate me. I\ndon\u2019t have any \u2014 the thing that bothers me endlessly in my brain is something that is politically\nincorrect. And you can\u2019t ask. The Germans went through people\u2019s history as to how many\ngenerations back they had Jewish blood. And if so, they were sent to concentration camps. How\nare the Germans now that they have their pure Aryan blood? That has been bothering me\nterribly. When the Moors and Jews were thrown out of Spain, we know what happened to\nSpain. It went downhill.\nAnd why hasn\u2019t this happened to Germany yet? All their intellectuals, all their money people.\nEverybody who was anything was Jewish. The men all tried to marry a blond girl, as non-Jewish\nas possible, if they possibly could. What\u2019s happened to those children? Were they all sent to\nconcentration camps? Did they wind up in Argentina, New York, Israel?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nMy father\u2019s sister Clara and her daughter Vera, my favorite cousin, were in concentration camps.\nThey apparently survived and were sent to Israel. In the last days of concentration camp, Vera\nmarried a fellow from the concentration camp. However, she became pregnant in Israel and he\nsaid he had never had a life. He had had no youth. Had nothing. He didn\u2019t want to be burdened\nwith a wife and children. And that was the last heard from him, I understand. She went insane\nfinally and she habitually would run through the streets stark naked. They would arrest her and\nput her in a, whatever it is. And my father would send money for, or for some medicine that\nwould temporarily make her sane. I don\u2019t know what happened to them. Eventually they,\nsomebody, maybe it was her mother, grandmother.\nBut her son, the son wanted to go to technical school and they didn\u2019t have money and my father\nsent money for him to go to technical school. After that my father died in 1975. My mother I\nthink tore up everything she could possibly find, where there were any knowledge of anybody\nelse. She says all they want is money from you. So I have no way of knowing other relatives.\nObviously I have some in Israel. I obviously have some in Sweden. Unless they have all gone\nback to somewhere else. Who knows? Cause I don\u2019t know where Freddie wind up. Men usually\ndie earlier than women, but he may still be around somewhere. But I saw some photograph when\nI was doing, I was doing a history of the family. And I came across a picture of Freddie and his\nchildren and his wife. But that was something in Germany. I don\u2019t know if they were just on\nvacation or what. I don\u2019t know where these people are. I don\u2019t have any relatives. I didn\u2019t really\ncare. I never thought about them. I agreed with my mother. Forget about them. But my children\nkeep wanting to know do we have relatives, some. My grandchildren. Do we have relatives in\nsome other country? Where are they? Who are they? I don\u2019t know. And I guess I\u2019ve got to find\nout before I die. I\u2019m already 82.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. Well over 60, I guess. I don\u2019t know if any of them rescued themselves or not.\nNever heard of them.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012",
        "A: No, I never thought back. I never thought back until old age, never thought back. I did what\neverybody else does. Just remove it from your brain.\nSince I\u2019m retired, not before. Because I have time.",
        "A: My parents never mentioned it again. Ever. Not in my presence.",
        "A: No, no we all agree the same thing without discussing it. Forget it, forget about it. It\u2019s gone.\nYou can\u2019t bring it back. It was no good. Why waste your effort on it. Think of what you\u2019re\ndoing now.",
        "A: I went back only once, when the children were very small. Roy was still on baby bottles and\nbut only because we were going to India because Chris wanted to see his uncle who had raised\nhim who was sick and old or something. And we stopped off in London where we always had\none of my mother\u2019s cousins lived there. Always long before the war and all that. Alice. She\nlived there. And we stopped off to see her.\nAnd stopped off in German Switzerland. And went to Vienna. We went, I wanted to go to\nKlagenfurt but it was snowing and there was -- it was six hours by train and the train couldn\u2019t go\ncause the tracks were full of snow. And we spent, no airplane could leave Vienna airport. And\nthere I had a little overactive son and a daughter at Vienna airport. And we couldn\u2019t go. We were\nstuck there for days at the airport. And finally I let them run loose and he did what boys do. He\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nran up to the conveyor belt and played with the conveyor belt and within minutes somebody\ncame and said Madame, we do not let our children run loose in \u2014 perhaps in America. And so I\ntook the cue and said oh but I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve been here for so\nlong. What can I possibly do, I can\u2019t control them. Within minutes they found us a plane to get\nus out of Vienna.\nI think it was to Egypt. And from there we would go to India. Unfortunately, there seemed to\nhave been some problem on the plane, because we all had to depart, stand in the middle of\nnowhere and they brought our luggage next to us. And we had to stand next to the luggage.\nNothing seemed to happen. The luggage went back on. Everybody got back on the plane. And\nthey said it would be I don\u2019t know, four hours or something before we would leave. Six hours.\nAnd so I left Chris with the children and decided to go to the airport and enjoy it. I thought I\ncouldn\u2019t get back on the plane until it was departing. It was hours and hours at the airport. I\ncouldn\u2019t leave outside. No permission to leave and go outside the airport. But there I was.\nThat was the only time we went, ever went back. A few hours \u2014",
        "A: Well we went to see, we went to see like tourists. I had no recollection of any of it. Cause I\nnever lived there. We didn\u2019t even go to the first section where we had fled to. And we saw the\npalaces. We saw the palaces and I remember little boy had to go to the bathroom and I asked,\nthere were 200 rooms in the palace, magnificent palace. Where is the bathroom and he said\nthere\u2019s only one in the tower.",
        "A: No, no it was the same thing as if I had visited France or China or --",
        "A: Apparently I had lost my accent because when we were in German Switzerland, somebody in\na taxi had stolen a little case in which we had stuff. And I reported it to the front desk in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 19, 2012\nGerman. We were in German Switzerland. And the man did what, unbelievable, insisted he call\nthe gendarmes and police finally came and he said Madame, perhaps come from Chicago. There\nis no crime in Switzerland. Only financial. Ok, no I had no desire. The Swiss food was\ndelicious. I will say, German Swiss food, we thought it was delicious. The English food was not\ngood I thought. But no I had no desire for any of it.",
