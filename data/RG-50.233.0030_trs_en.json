        "\nFebruary 22, 1992\nTeaneck, New Jersey",
        "My name is Irene Frisch. My maiden name used to be Bienstock. In Poland it was Irena\nBienstock. I was born on May 3, 1931 in a small town in Poland. The town was called\nDrohobycz. I had a very nice childhood until the war. I grew up as the youngest of three\nchildren of Izrael and Ewa Bienstock. My father was in thread? business. He was a very\nprosperous businessman who was quite known in the town, who had many friends. I\ndon\u2019t say it was a poor family and it was very privileged, rich life. I am here to tell you\nmy story because I feel I owe it to Frania Osobkowa. Her maiden name was Babecka.\nShe was a very proud Polak, a Polish woman, very devout Catholic, the most beautiful\nhuman being I have seen in my life, good and selfless and helpful and it is her that I am\nthankful, that it 1s for her that I am here today to tell my story. Frania worked in our\nhouse as a housekeeper. My mother hired her when she was very young and she came to\nwork for us before I was born. She took care of my older brother, of my sister and then\neventually with me. It\u2019s time to say that at the beginning she didn\u2019t like me because she\nresented having to take care of three children. She knew all her friends had only two\nchildren to take care of and here she is, stuck with three children. My mother understood\nthat she was very devoted to us so my mother didn\u2019t want to lose her and after a time she\nhired somebody else to take care of me. But after a while she got very careless and we\nnever could have anybody, and Frania, of course, she was not educated, she didn\u2019t know\nhow to write or to read. She was a very intelligent woman and today when I see the\nchildren are insecure and have to go to psychologists, I am thinking how lucky I was to\nbe brought up by a woman who had so much common sense that we never had any\nsecurity problems. We always believed that we were the best, smartest and most\nbeautiful. Frania believed this and she instilled it in us. And I am very grateful to her for\nmany, many things in my life. During the war, we were not, in the beginning, we were\nnot really touched with that. She was already a mature woman and she lived outside of\nour house. Her husband went to war and she did not have any children and she was\nworking menial work in a factory and when the time came that my parents saw that there\nwas absolutely no way for me to survive, that as a last resort, they sent somebody ahead\nand asked her if she could help out. And she said, \u201cNaturally, I expect to take care of\nthem. And if you are not here after the war, I will have her christened and she will grow\nup as my child\u201d.\nI know how to pray in Polish because of the prayers more better than I know my own\nprayers. She taught me I -- know it all -- I know about holidays. I spent with her two and\na half years. I remember we didn\u2019t have much to eat, we were very, very poor because\nmy mother did not have any -- she eventually took in my mother and my sister. We\ndidn\u2019t have any money, we lost everything and we had to live on the little money that she\nwas earning in the factory which maybe would have been enough for one person but she\nhad to feed four people on that. Most of the time we were hungry. Frania went to a\nneighbor and was offered a cup of tea with a lump of sugar. She would sneak the sugar\nin her pocket and bring it home. My mother and two children; I wonder if I could do it\nfor my children.",
        "1",
        "Basically, even today I believe in providence and I believe in things that happened\nbecause they were meant to be. I do not believe too much in praying. I have seen many\ntimes in life that things have been just because probably God meant it so or whatever we\ncall some kind of spiritual power. It is interesting how we were rescued by Frania, how\nFrania came into our life. When my mother was a cucooman, she helped me find my\nother brother, and he was a little chubby, cute baby. Once she took the baby in the\ncarriage and went to park. On the way to park, she was stopped by a young peasant girl,\nwho like most of the peasants in Poland, was wearing a long skirt in front of the wading\npool and she was very poor and she was barefoot. She stopped by my mother\u2019s carriage\nand she said, \u201cOh, what a beautiful baby you have there!\u201d Naturally, each young mother\nthinks that her baby is beautiful and she was very flattered and she says really because it\nwas a boy so my mother told her. And she said, \u201cCan I stop and play with him a little\nbit?\u201d And she took the rattle and was playing and my mother saw that she liked the baby.\nShe told her how old she was, maybe fifteen or sixteen years old and my mother said\nwhat are you doing here and she said you know, I come for the employment and my\nfather died very young and I was working for the priests, I was ---. She started to work\nwhen she was five years old in the little village and she was minding the geese. The\npriest had some geese so he took a five-year old girl and gave her a stick and she was\nminding the geese. And then as she was growing up, she was promoted to more\nimportant jobs. She was helping in the kitchen, and in the gardens and when she was\nsixteen years old or fifteen, her mother said for her to start making some real money.\nBecause in the village, she could not make any money, she just worked there and she got\nfood. They were poor people with many children so food to feed a child was a treasure.\nSo when she was like fifteen years old, she came to us. She said, \u201cI came here, I told my\nmother -- I came here to look for a job\u201d. What do you want to do? \u201cI would like to care\nof a child, help in the house\u201d. So my mother said come to me, you have a job. She had a\nlittle kerchief and in her kerchief, she had (?\u00b0??222?722722?) . So, my mother brought\nher home, people didn\u2019t ask for references like people ask today and they gave her a bed.\nShe was very happy to take care of the baby, mostly, it was more to it. She was very\ngood to him and from my parents, it was very thoughtful that they could realize that we\nhad more help in the house. But she really took care of my brother and then my sister\nand as I have mentioned before, I came along. I don\u2019t think I was really , It was not\nthe style of middle class, upper class people to have three children. It was stylish to have\none or two but when I came along she was very mad that she did not really want to bother\nwith me too much so my parents had to hire somebody else, you may remember. I was\ntold many times about this, my brother and sister used to tease me, Frania doesn\u2019t like\nyou like she likes us but eventually she did love me as much as anybody else. So when I\ncame into hiding, she took me from ghetto, as I mentioned to you, she came at night, she\ntook me out and we went walking and we went singing the carols and even today I\nremember the carols and I love Christmas like very much. As a matter of fact, the first\nChristmas after I married, already, in the United States, I was with my husband our first\nChristmas in Atlantic City and I said because I don\u2019t believe you \u2014 the\nCatholic religion. Today I am a practicing Jew more or less, and I said to my husband we\nhave to go to services so, my friends, Christmas as a married woman, I went with my\nhusband in Atlantic City to Christmas Night which was not as meaningful as it was in",
        "2",
        "Poland but she took me out of the ghetto on Christmas Night and she took me to her\nhouse and took very good care of me. And gave me very much love. Then she thought I\nam not happy, I was missing my parents, so she brought over my sister and my mother.\nShe could not do much for my father because she did not have much space in her\napartment. We were lucky to meet my father after the war. Most of my friends, my\nJewish friends, did not survive. I had very wonderful friends from before the war that\ndidn\u2019t survive the war. Since Frania was basically a very poor woman and did not have\nmuch money, she lived in a very small apartment. It was one room, that was living room,\ndining room and everything and a small kitchen and there was no place for us to hide---\nit was very starkly furnished, she had the bed, one bed, she had the sofa and she had a\ncloset, but this -was it, a small closet, a table and four chairs. There was not much room\nfor us, no place to hide. But in Europe, the bed was fixed with all kinds of pillows, and\ncovers and then you had a big, long bedcover and the bedcover would go to the floor.\nWhen I was alone, for a while, I would get along without my mother and without my\nsister, I was spending all my days underneath the bed. I was not allowed to move\nbecause neighbors shouldn\u2019t hear. It was an apartment, not really, the apartment she lived\nin, she shared with another family so there was not even a wall between the two\napartments. It was one big apartment broken into two or three, and they were separated\nby a door so on the other side of the door there lived another family. If I would move\nduring the day and the neighbors knew that Frania was at work, it would be very\nsuspicious so I was not even allowed to cough, not to breathe loud because on the other\nside of the door there lived a family, there lived an older woman who was all day at home\nand she would have noticed that something is going on in the apartment. They all knew\nthat Frania is at work so I practically stayed under the bed most of the time. However, I\nsuppose, maybe, at one point the neighbors grew, somehow, suspicious. Maybe, they\ndidn\u2019t grow suspicious, maybe it looked so. There was a point when I was with\nmy mother and my sister and we found out that the ghetto is being liquidated. It means\nthat all the Jews from ghetto have been killed. Frania, in the evening, went to the\nbathroom or something, which was on the outside of the porch and she started to talk to a\nneighbor and the neighbor made some comment about the Jews being killed and the\nneighbor was not very sorry about it, no, and the neighbor said to Frania, \u201cDo you know\nwhat? Some of our people are stupid enough to help the Jews?\u201d She said what did that\nmean. \u201cSome of our people are hiding the Jews!\u201d Now, you can imagine. Frania came\nhome and we had altercation, we were close enough. We got very upset and Frania said\nto my mother, \u201cI had a feeling that she suspects something\u201d. Maybe she didn\u2019t suspect,\nmaybe it was just a general statement, but Frania had a plan. So the next day she decided\nshe\u2019s not going to work. Somehow she notifies the place of work, there\u2019s no telephone so\nshe notifies the place of work and she says \u201cI\u2019m not coming to work today. I have to take\na kitchen day\u201d, or whatever she made up. She told her neighbor my house is really so\nneglected, I have to take general cleaning, make general cleaning ... She opens all her\nwindows, all her doors and started to tear the apartment apart, cleaning. She wanted the\npeople to see, to come in, to be able to come in to the apartment and to see that she really\ndoes not have anyone. So, as evidence, we have to go from under the bed because it\u2019s\ntoo dangerous. She put my mother in a closet. She put my mother in a closet which\nlooked like today\u2019s armoire and my poor mother was sitting in that closet, my mother was\na tall woman, taller than I and I am not a small thing. My sister and I were stuffed in a",
        "3",
        "box. The box looked like a huge suitcase, not a suitcase, a chest, some kind of chest that\nwas really given to her by my parents. My father was bringing furs?? His merchandise\nfrom the groat in that chest. My sister and I, we were sitting, like forged together in that\nchest, an she opened a little bit the cover and put something, some food, we should not\nchoke on it. We cover and we were sitting there for two hours rigid, not being able to\nmove. Finally, after Frania made big order in the house, airing, took the beds apart, took\nthe mattresses outside so the people could see and neighbors came in and \u2018Oh, Mrs.\nOsobkowa we have never been to your room\u2019. So she showed her apartment, the\nmattress was out and the bed was empty. Nobody could even believe that there was ---\nthat some things were ---. She was very resourceful and a very intelligent woman to do\nthat. It was month of the infidel??\nI remember another incident when she came home in the evening from work and was\ncompletely pale. We could see that her face was white and she said, ---. My mother said,\n\u2018\u201cFrania what happened? It seems that you are very disturbed.\u201d Frania said, \u201cYes, as I\nwas coming home, I passed by the market\u201d. It was the main place of the town so for\nDrohobycz, it was like a market place. \u201cAnd you know what I saw? They caught a\nfamily of Jews that were hidden by Polish people and they hanged them in the\nmarketplace. Together they were hanging. The Jewish people together with the Polish\npeople\u201d. So my mother said, \u201cYou know, Frania, I feel so sorry for you\u201d. So she said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me\u2019. She had two big pictures of saints, Maria and Jesus. She too\nthe big picture of the man, holy picture and hung it over my mother\u2019s sofa. She going to\ntake care of it. This today when I travel with my husband, I always come in a town, I\nalways go to church. And I always give money and I always take a candle and light it.\nShe believed, my good friend.\nI could tell you many more stories about Frania\u2019s generosity and beautiful hands. I\nremember one day when we went to sleep. We were very poor, we were very hungry.\nWe had nothing already to sell and we went to sleep often, very hungry. We didn\u2019t",
        ". And at night, we hear somebody moving around. I open my eyes and see\nFrania shaking and she says, get up. I say, what is it? She says, I don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t\nsleep. I cooked something. I found some black flour in the kitchen on cupboard and I\nmake little dumplings and I put a little saccharine. Come, we\u2019ll all eat together. She\nwoke up my mother and my sister to share the food with me. Then came Christmas and\nwe wanted to do something for her because she was believing in Christmas and it was\nimportant to her. We knew that it is important and we also knew that she was deprived of\nmany things because she had to share everything with us. So I remember my sister was\nquite resourceful and found some old pajamas or whatever and made a little baby dress\nout of it. She was a young girl, but very dainty. She made some little things. We gave it\nto Frania and she went to the market. She sold it. She had a little money. I still\nremember the little apron or dress that my sister made or maybe it was a baby dress and\nan apron. She was like fourteen -- or fifteen years old girl but she was very good with her\nhands. We had a little bit money and Frania bought some flour, maybe some pottery. I\ndon\u2019t think we had money then. And then we went to another baking, cakes for\nher. The cakes were a sort of pancake. We cannot remember. We didn\u2019t have yeast, so\nwe couldn\u2019t grow. We put some kind of powder. I remember when we often would take",
        "4",
        "the to bite. They were flat. They were not good. We pretended that they were\ncake. It was Easter. She came from the church. In Poland, it is very important to bring\nthe food, the priest should bless it. She took the food cakes to church and the food cake\nwas blessed. And we pretended that everything is good and delicious. We actually\nstarted like that. Then, the Russians were coming closer and closer. We never knew\nwhat is going on outside. Naturally she didn\u2019t have a radio. She couldn\u2019t buy a\nnewspaper because it would be suspicious. People, her neighbors, knew that she did not\nknow how to write or to read. So she would come up with a newspaper, it would have to\nbe everything we did had to be very calculated. But we heard some noises, we heard like\nshooting, artillery going. One day, the Russians came to the town and we were liberated.\nWe went out. She did not want ever mention, her neighbors to know about it because I\nam embarrassed to tell you that many of the neighbors were very anti-Semitic and many\nsaid that it was good that the Jews were killed. So she did not want to antagonize the\nneighbors so we came out. And we couldn\u2019t come back to the house because we did not\nwant to embarrass her in front of her neighbors. I don\u2019t remember such a great\nchildhood. We had very bad experience because the Russian soldiers were not nice to us.\nThey say to my mother, you must have done something wrong. You must have\ncollaborated with the Germans. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have survived. We were\nexpecting so much sympathy from a after the war and we were all the time\nplanning what the whole world is going to try to compensate us for our experience. This\ncame from the Russian soldiers and they said, when my mother told them she was\nJewish, \u201cYou must have collaborated with the Germans. Otherwise ---\u201c So, you know,\nwe had double problems, you know. So we found some other Jewish family and we\nstuck together for two days until we found some kind of an apartment. We had nothing\nto eat, we had no food, we had no money. My mother found, met someone, an old friend,\nalso a Jewish woman, who unfortunately lost her two sons and survived with her husband\nin Poland. And when she told my mother of the two children, she gave her some money.\nShe had some money left. She gave my mother money and said go and buy meat for you,\nbuy some bread. And very soon my mother got to Frania and was working",
        ". She got a job in a dairy of some kind of, not factory, but they were doing all\nkinds of making or producing their product. And whenever she could steal something,\nshe would bring it to us. Then she never stopped caring.\nWhat I wanted to say, that eventually we left Poland and in 1949 or 1950, we left Poland\nand we went to Israel. As I mentioned before, I am the third of three children. And we\nare only two today. I had a brother who was five and a half years older than me and in\nthe beginning of the war, he got sick and due to bad conditions, he could not be properly\ndiagnosed. Just today, I talk to my sister, and we are wondering what really happened to\nhim. I have a feeling that he had walking pneumonia. He was fourteen years old when he\ndied, at the very beginning of the war. It was a terrible tragedy; it was the first time that I\nencountered death. In the time later, it became a daily trend. I have seen it so many\ntimes that ---. But it was the first time, 1t was a terrible tragedy, of all\nfamilies. Needless to say, Frania was shattered, almost unbelievable, as my mother.\nThey went together to the funeral and they were both crying like they both loved him\nvery, very much. She still, to the end, always talked about him. It was her baby, it was\nthe baby that changed her whole life. This was the baby, that because of the baby she",
        "5",
        "came into our family. The baby was fourteen years old. He was very big, he was very\ntall, he was a huge young man, to have him for her baby. Many times later, my mother\nsaid, you know, Frania, it is a good thing that he died. Because if he didn\u2019t die, he would\nbe killed. This one got killed, and this -- most of his friends got killed. And Frania\nwould say, no, I would never let him be killed. I would have prevented it. So, we were\nleft in the ghetto with our parents. In 1945, one year after our town was liberated, we still\ndid not live together. Frania was still embarrassed that she saved Jews. She came to our\nhouse only in the evening, people shouldn\u2019t see, but we were in constant touch. We had\nseen that? Over time, Polish people would be evacuated to the new Polish territory and\nwe all left Poland. We considered ourselves Polish citizens and all Polish citizen left.\nOnly the Ukrainians remained there. We were traveling in very primitive trains and it\ntook a long time, four weeks, until we arrived at our destination. Many, many times that\nshe was traveling with us together, we were already together, and one more thing. People\ncame from concentration camps and people told us that they saw my father in Auschwitz,\nin Plaszow, in Bielitz, in Germany, in different concentration camps. There were even\nsome people who said that he was dead. There were some men that came to my mother\nand said, \u201cYou are a widow. Why don\u2019t we get married?\u201d Men who loved their\nfamilies. My mother was not interested in getting married again and we were going to\nPoland and we were sure that my father is dead. One morning, on the train, I was\nsleeping, as usual, next to Frania, and she woke me up. She said, \u201cLook, who is here!\u201d\u2019 I\nhad a pet name that they called me at home, when I was a little girl. She always called\nme by that name, a funny little name and she called me by that name. She shook me and\nsaid, \u201cLook who is here.\u201d Here I see my father stepping in front of the train, in front of\nour compartment, tall and handsome and dashing through the train, well dressed, with a\nbig bag and I thought I see a ghost. I was screaming and I was petrified. I jumped on\nhim and he was there, he was real, he hugged me and he kissed me. A few minutes later,\nI say, \u201cDaddy, what do you have in that bag?\u201d Because I remember when he was coming\nfrom all his trips from the road, before the war, there was always most beautiful gifts for\nus. Believe it or not, he was not sure that we were alive. Somebody had some vague\nrumors that we were alive but he attributed them to . He had very fancy raincoats\nfor my sister and for me, blue raincoats and they were in that bag! So when I opened the\nbag, here was a gift for me. He had prepared just in case he needed them. We were\nreunited with Father and for the next few months, my father, every day after business, he\nwas taking home, closing the door, closing the windows, and my father would tell us\nhorror stories about concentration camps. Horror stories. The last year, I went for a visit\nto Poland and from Cracow, I took a tour, a bus to Auschwitz. When I was walking\nthrough Auschwitz, it seemed to me that I was there before because I saw all the places\nthat my father was telling us. What happened here and what happened there, for a month,\neverything he walked, . He was telling us how this died and how that died and\nhow this died and all the people that we knew, young boys, young girls, people, how --\nwhat people went through, he sat every evening and we were listening to him talk about\nthe problem. So when I came to concentration camp, to Auschwitz, I felt I know all\nabout it, no doubt about it. It was not me talking.\nAnyway, we lived in Legnica and I went through high school there. Right after the war,\nin Poland, also my father was a good businessman and financially we were doing okay.",
        "6",
        "But it was terrible and I could not . But somehow people manage and\npeople look always for the good things, for the nice things, but there weren\u2019t very many\npeople that were nice to us including a principal of Gamati who made up his mind,\nProfessor Bodola -- he must be a dead man now because it was in 1946 or \u201947, that I went\nto this man. He decided that he does not know the Jewish kids in the high school, he was\nprincipal. And my father who was an educated man, told him that I knew how to talk to\nhim and tells him that he will go to the Ministry of Education, of Department of\nEducation in Warsaw to find out why I can\u2019t be admitted to this high school. So, he\nadmitted me because he had no choice. But for two years, he made my life miserable. I\ncannot even begin to tell you and I don\u2019t know how I wanted so much to go to school. I\nknow my kids never wanted so much to go to school and they had not the condition. It\nwas the most important thing for me to go to school. Maybe because I missed it so much,\nI wanted to be part of -- have a normal life. So Professor Bodola was a principal of that\nhigh school, and was teaching classes and I was starting humanities in high school and I\nhad every day from eight to ten o\u2019clock, Latin. Every morning from eight to ten, he had\nthe . No matter what I did, no matter what I say, my father hired a private\ntutor and the private tutor said to my father, I don\u2019t know, I cannot teach her any more\nbecause she knows almost as much as I do. But in the class, I always got an F. At one\npoint, I was translating something, I don\u2019t remember and there was a word, tyrum\u2019??",
        "isa . So somebody said, have you ever seen a lamb?. I said yes, where?\nI said, in a meadow??? No answer. Sit down. And for two years, for three semesters,\nwhich was three quarters, I was getting an F and I was sure that I am going to fail. If you\nget one respect ?? So we had a very good . One day Mr. Bodola was removed.\nApparently he did some other things that were not right and he was removed. And we\ngot a new principal, Professor Kaploski. Somehow, I couldn\u2019t do anything wrong for\nhim. I stopped studying at all. I sneezed, I got an A. No matter what, you know. It\ndidn\u2019t do me any favor because I stopped studying completely on the subject he was\nteaching us. He taught us philosophy. I got A whatever I did so kind of feel in life, got\nto give you on one hand, taking away with the other hand. So whatever Bodola did for\nme, Professor Kaploski did the kind work. Recently I found a girl who is the late?\nGrown woman who lives in Mineka with a lawyer and she was one of the very few girls\nin high school who was a nice girl, it didn\u2019t bother her that I was Jewish, we talked\ntogether. After many, many years, I picked up, I found her. Maybe, I\u2019m helping her a\nlittle bit. She wrote me a letter that she never knew that out friendship meant so much to\nme. She apparently looked at me as an ordinary schoolmate. It was very important that\nsomebody in those days treated me normally. In the winter of 1949, the Jews were\nallowed to leave for Israel. My family decided to go to Israel and my parents offered\nFrania to go with us. They promised her, there were ways, with money you could\narrange all kinds of -- an arrangement could be made, to transfer her to Israel although\nnon-Jewish people were not allowed to go but we could have done it. She refused to go.\nShe said, \u201cYou know I\u2019m going to miss you very much but this is my country, this is my\nlanguage, this is my religion, this is my priest. I go to church, I understand what the\npriest is saying, I belong here.\u201d So we left but we were heartbroken; we cried for months,\nall of us. We went to Israel, we would write the letter, it was very different. In Israel, in\n1950, it was very difficult to live. The colonical?? Situation was very bad -- no food,\nnothing. The country was very poor. We didn\u2019t do too well. Then my sister got married",
        "7",
        "and she passed . We went to school, we studied, we went to the university but\nmy sister we were sending Frania every cent we could spare, all countries from Israel.\nSome money, very little, we didn\u2019t have much. But I remember that one of the first\nlessons she was to give, \u201cNow that you are in Israel, don\u2019t send me any more money.\nYour husband does not know me. It is not fair to him, he should send me money. I am a\ncomplete stranger.\u201d I don\u2019t think a mother could write a letter like that. She was not a\nwealthy woman, we left her provided but it was years, took her years, she was on and off\n. We always writing to her, we always send whatever we could. I came to the United\nStates 31 years ago but I was always in touch with her, sent pictures, she sent pictures\nback. We sent packages to her and always she would say, please don\u2019t send, maybe your\nhusband will be unhappy, maybe you will need it. She never took advantage of our\nsituation but we did help her out. Eventually she took in, she was a very loving woman,\nshe had a brother who had children and the brother was a poor man so she adopted one of\nhis daughters and raised her as her own. She needed somebody to give love to. About 15\nor 16 years ago, I found out that actually people in Gradzanowo, Poland were many\nI think you know what this time that you should be right. We bought a ticket, we split the\nmoney, my sister was in Atlanta, Georgia that day. We put together the money, the ticket\nwas quite expensive; maybe it was 16, 17 years ago, we sent the ticket. Frania took the\nairport in Stupeka . She did the airport. When I left Poland, I was 18 years old.\nHere I am, a woman in my forties with my husband. I see that the aged woman, very,\nvery, she was very worn out, I had never seen so many wrinkles in my life, came out of\nthe gate and I came over and I said, \u201care you Mrs. Kobach?\u201d She say, yes, yes. It looked\nlike her. And I said it is me. Naturally we hugged, we kissed, we cried. She came to my\nhouse, she take tea. I must tell you what a great, generous woman. She came with a\nfruitcake, there was a china set for me, one for my sister, God forbid anybody should be\njealous. There was a dancer? For my daughter, there was some kind of toy for my son.\nThere were cufflinks for my husband, she didn\u2019t have that kind of money. She\ncame, a gallant woman with gifts, she cooked, she baked. I took her to the church on\nFifth Avenue. Then she told me, you know, I still don\u2019t tell my friends, my neighbors\nwhat I did. She had all new neighbors and friends, she lived in a Pll give",

And each time, I brought her\nthings, try this, try this, she\u2019d say, please don\u2019t do it, your husband may get upset. I don\u2019t\nwant you to do it. You have children, what of them. You keep the money for yourself.\nYou have young children, you will need the money. She did not want to take a thing.\nThe same thing with my sister, She takes three weeks with me and three weeks with my\nsister. She went to the church St. Patrick\u2019s a great pavilion and she said Gee the church is\nbigger than all the churches put together than I have seen in my life.
