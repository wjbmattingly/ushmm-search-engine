That me -- 1t meant that storm\ntroopers stood in front of -- a couple of storm troopers stood in front of all Jewish\nstores and stopped people from going in.

        "A: No, in the beginning, hardly any changes took place, this all happened later, very\ngradually. So that was one reason why we all thought it might end very suddenly\nagain. We thought it couldn\u2019t last, that Hitler would be thrown out again, and we\nthought it only for a short while. We couldn\u2019t believe that this would stay forever.\nBut later on of course, 1t got more serious.",

        "A: In the beginning there was hardly any change in 1933, but 30 -- \u2019?34, and shortly\nafter that, it slowly changed. In the beginning I was still very friendly with all of --\nwe were a class of 25, who stayed together by the way, until the nine years were\nOver, SO we -- we were always together. So I was still very friendly with most --\nalmost all of them. And then --",
        "Q: This is boys and girls?",
        "A: Yes, boys and girls, right. And they kept on talking to me, we had friendly\nrelations, but slowly they all joined the Hitler youth, the Nazi organization.

I was very happy I didn\u2019t have to take part.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "Q: At this time did you feel very German or very Jewish?",
        "A: I felt very German in the beginning, but this changed when Hitler came to\npower, of course, it\u2019s changed completely. And a-at that time I was of -- felt more\nJewish than I had before.",

        "A: Of course we didn\u2019t like it at all and we felt -- we were looking forward to the\nday -- it last five, six days. We were looking forward to the day when that was over.\nIn the beginning we were not actually afraid that something would happen to us, but\nI -- I know that a couple of Jewish people were beaten up on the street and insulted\nand that happened, by the way, in other ways, too. Slowly, 1933 - \u00b034 - \u201935, it got\nworse, and people were insulted on the streets. They called us dirty Jews and many\ntimes they -- they hit us, especially the young people.",

There was a Jewish teacher\u2019s college in Berlin, and I asked\na couple of my -- we had some acquaintances which were -- knew a lot about music\nand s -- and voice and singing and so on. So I consulted some of our friends, sang\nfor them, and asked them if -- if they thought my voice was good enough to be a\ncantor. So I finally heard of s -- of the Jewish teacher\u2019s college in Berlin. And -- so,\nin other words, I would have to be trained as a cantor and as a teacher, mainly as a\nteacher, of course. This was a teacher\u2019s college, which specialized, of course, in\nJewish education and public school and everything like this.

        "A: No, actually not. At that time I was too young for that, at 12 years. I didn\u2019t feel I\nhad any responsibility in that respect. But there were my uncles of -- there were two\nuncles of mine living in Furth, too, who of course w -- tried to help my mother\nmanage things and so on.",
        "Q: So now you go off to Berlin, an-and what was your experience there at this\nteacher\u2019s college?",
        "A: It was very hard for me in the beginning because I felt very lonesome. I didn\u2019t\nknow a soul in Berlin, and -- but that\u2019s -- got slowly used to it and I did pretty well\nin school there. I had some voice teachers, too. One was one of the best known\ncantors in Berlin. The other one was an opera singer at the Berlin opera. And they\ngi -- first one, then the other one gave me singing lessons, so I improved my voice to\na certain extent.",
        "Q: And their names? The cantor\u2019s name and the singer\u2019s name?",
        "A: The cantor\u2019s name was Davidson and the -- the opera singer\u2019s name was Relane\nGoodman. He was pretty well known.",
        "Q: And so you -- you were with all other Jewish students at the time, because this\nwas a Jewish college.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: Right, that was a Jewish college, right. A Jewish teacher\u2019s college. Half of it\nconsisted of regular teacher\u2019s cl-classes and teaching. The other half was Jewish\neducation because we had to teach religion, too. So I -- I -- a lot, a lot of Hebrew, of\ncourse, and everything connected with the Jewish religion, customs and ceremonies.\nSome Talmud s-studies we had too, just to give us a taste of It.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Fred Goldman. This is tape number one, side B.\nAnd you were talking about your experience at this Jewish college in Berlin. And\nall the students, of course, were Jewish. What was it like to study with only Jews, as\nopposed to your gymnasium experience?",
        "A: It, of course, was a pleasant experience to be together with Jewish kids all the\ntime. In that respect, I liked it very much. We were very good friends to each other.\nWas aclass of about 24 bor -- boys and girls.",
        "Q: I imagine you saw many swastikas and many flags hanging, not only in Furth,\nbut of course in Berlin. How did that make you feel, to see them?",
        "A: No | -- everybody got very f-fast used to that, it was something that you see\neverywhere, and you di -- after awhile you didn\u2019t even notice it any more.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And when someone would heil Hitler, did that upset you?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: The same thing, you got used to that too. After awhile it didn\u2019t bother you too\nmuch any more.",
        "Q: Any experiences on the street when you were in Berlin, if you were walking\ndown the street? Did you look very Jewish?",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I looked Jewish, of course. But in -- in the big city of four million, you\ndi-disappeared in the crowd. And you could do in -- in certain ways it was even\nbetter in Berlin than in Furth, because you could go to the places here still. In\nFurth you couldn\u2019t even go to a swimming pool, or in -- all the -- in -- in the rest of\nGermany you couldn\u2019t go to a swimming pool, to theaters or movies or any place\nlike this. In fir -- in Berlin you could do that, because you just disappeared in the\ncrowd. You could even go to the opera and to concerts. So in that respect, life in\nBerlin was easier than in Furth.",
        "Q: And how much communication did you have with your mother and your sister?",
        "A: I spoke to them on the telephone, I guess once a week.",
        "Q: And how were they managing back in Furth?",
        "A: That -- it seems they managed all right without me, but business got worse at that\npoint. Th-The longer Hitler was at pow -- in power, the worse economic conditions\nfor Jews became.",
        "Q: And how did your mother support the family then?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: There was still enough business just to barely support us, but it -- I know it was\nnot easy for her to have me in Berlin, of course. Did not help our financial situation.",
        "Q: Did you have to pay tuition to go to this college?",
        "A: Yes, I had to pay tuition there.",
        "Q: What -- and where did you live when you were a student in Berlin?",
        "A: I lived in a furnished room with a Jewish family, not far from our teacher\u2019s\ncollege.",
        "Q: And what kind of experience was that?",
        "A: I had no special experiences in t -- I mean, they were -- I was pr -- became pretty\nclose to the family, which made it easy for me to be alone in Berlin.",
        "Q: You had previously mentioned the Nuremberg rallies. Did you ever go to any of\nthem, or hear them from a distance?",
        "A: No, you could not go. You -- you stayed away from them as far as you could. It\nnever entered our minds to a -- to attend these things. You stayed away from -- from\nthe -- these Nazi hordes as -- as much as you possibly could.",
        "Q: Any close Jewish friends that you could talk things over with?",
        "A: In Firth, yes, but a -- a lot of them left Germany, emigrated over the years.\nEverybody tried to get out of Germany, of course. And this way it was not easier.\nOn one hand you wanted to get out of Germany, on the other hand you didn\u2019t know\nwhere to go to -- and especially older people found it very difficult to leave, because\nNovember 19, 2001\nall -- they had all their roots in Germany, their livelihoods, their friends, family.\nAnd for a young person, of course, it was easier to leave, unless you were -- of\ncourse, you -- you were very attached to your family.",
        "Q: Did your family have any contacts in the -- in the United States at that time?",
        "A: My mother had a cousin in -- in America, in -- in York, Pennsylvania. He was a\nfairly wealthy man and he had vouched for quite a few people already to come to\nAmerica, but when we asked him he couldn\u2019t do it any more. He must have\nvouched for maybe 20 people, and when you reach a certain point, you couldn\u2019t do\nit any more. So he had to say no to us in the beginning, but later on, for some reason\nhe could do it again, and he asked -- he asked our family if they -- who -- who\nshould -- he could vouch for one more person, who should come. And because I was\nthe only man in the family and more in danger of being persecuted by the Nazis, so\nmy family agreed to send -- to let me go.",
        "Q: We-We\u2019ll get to that ina moment. You heard about the anschluss into -- into\nAustria, and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- what did that mean to you?",
        "A: It didn\u2019t mean much to me except I didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t like the idea that\nsomething like this could happen. We -- we thought ma -- there mi -- m-more\nNovember 19, 2001\ncountries might -- might be occupied by Germany, which actually happened later\non. We saw this the beginning of something very bad.",
        "Q: Is that when you realized that what was happening may not be temporary?",
        "A: That was the time when -- when most Jews realized that things would not get any\n-- an-any better any more. Before we always thought Hitler\u2019s regime might stop any\nmoment it ca -- when it came to a certain point, and it would not get worse. At that\ntime we realized we couldn\u2019t stay. That\u2019s when people -- many people really started\nlooking to get out seriously. Many, of course, had left already in 1933, but these\nwere the Jews who lived in very small towns, in villages, mostly in south Germany\nand they were worse off than the Jews who lived in b -- in the big cities, because\neverybody knew everybody and people were beaten up and sent to concentration\ncamps in these small place, much more than b -- in big cities, at that time. But after\nthis happened at the anschluss and later on Kristallnacht, we came to the\nconclusion that there was no way of staying here.",
        "Q: What was your experience during Kristallnacht?",
        "A: In the middle of the night we heard a lot of noise, at maybe two, three o\u2019clock in\nthe morning, and the bra -- the breaking of glass. And then we looked out of the\nwindow, we saw that storm troopers marched all over the place and knocked in store\nwindows and went inside and then they came -- they went upstairs out -- in these\nhouses an-a-and arrested all the Jewish people. An -- and that -- that happened with\nNovember 19, 2001\neach and every Jew in the whole place, and happened all over Germany. And then\nthey -- they burned all synagogues. And I knew it -- I could see that our synagogue\nin Furth was burning at the time, too.",
        "Q: Were you in Berlin or Furth during Kristallnacht?",
        "A: I -- I was still in Firth at that time. No, that was after I came back.",
        "Q: This is November 1938.",
        "A: I was back in Furth already, th -- after my three years in Berlin when the kr --\nKristallnacht was November 9\", 1938, and th-th-they t -- they took us all to a large\nsquare in the middle of the city and we had to stand there for five hours, men,\nwomen, children, everybody. Then they let women and children go home. The men\nwere taken to a big hall, which had been donated by a Jew, by the way. And we\nspent all day in there. And they took men, took them up to the stage an-and beat\nthem. And we had to watch it, we were sitting underneath, 1-inside the hall and we\nhad to watch everything. And that went on all day like this. And in the evening,\nabout six, seven o\u2019clock, we all had to pass a certain table, and we were -- there th-\nth-they decided what to do with us. So the majority of the men were sent to\nconcentration camps, and to prisons. My -- my future father-in-law, for instance,\nwas sent to pri -- was taken to prison and many other men were taken to\nconcentration camps. And when I -- when I passed the table, they heard that I -- that\nI was almost ready to emigrate, my papers were almost ready. And they -- on\nNovember 19, 2001\naccount of that they let me go. I was very lucky, cause I was able to go home. But\nthe majority of the people did not. It\u2019s --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Le -- le-let\u2019s back up a little bit. You went to the teacher\u2019s college in\nBerlin for three years?",
        "A: Right, yes, for three years.",
        "Q: And that -- and then you completed the course, and then what happened?",
        "A: Then I wa -- I was trying to find a job as a cantor teacher and I -- I had two\nauditions, I was in two cities in Germany. And in one place they didn\u2019t take me\nbecause I was t -- they found me too young, they wanted some -- somebody who --\nwho was a little older. And in the -- in the second case I don\u2019t know, they d-didn\u2019t\naccept me. So I went home, then I realized that it -- it was better for me not to accept\na job, and try -- rather, try to -- to speed up my emigration. And that was a good\nthing, because I know some of the others who accepted jobs as teachers never got\nout of Germany. In that respect I was lucky.",
        "Q: And who did you work through to get the papers? You said you had that relative\nwho had already completed the 20 affidavits -- 1-in the United States, you said you\nhad a relative who had sponsored 20 people, it -- did you work through him also?",
        "A: What do you mean by work for him?",
        "Q: No, no, work through him. I mean how -- how did you make arrangements to be\nable to leave?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: No, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s -- he must have sent a -- a letter to the American consulate in\nStuttgart in Germany, and they contacted me and then I was invited to come to the\nAmerican consulate in Stuttgart, and that was the beginning. An-And then I tri -- I\ntried to get -- the-they wanted a certain document, which sort of -- many -- in\nGermany when you moved, and thi -- it went for anybody, if you moved from one\ncity or town to another one, you had to get permission by police. And that wa --\ndidn\u2019t go only for Jewish people, for everybody as th -- might still be the same\nnowadays, I don\u2019t know. So, and they told me I needed a certain paper, a declaration\nthat I didn\u2019t owe any money to anybody or the taxes [indecipherable]. And I wrote\nto Berlin because I had been there before, a-and they -- I didn\u2019t get an answer. So\nmy da -- emigration depended on -- on this document. And I wrote three times and\nnever got an answer, so I decided I had to go there in person. So I made a trip to\nBerlin and I had to go to the Gestapo building, which everybody dreaded at the\ntime. Nobody wanted to go there. So I went in, I -- I -- I met a -- an official there,\nand he yelled at me right away, he said, what\u2019s the matter with you, are you crazy?\nYou\u2019re writing three letters to me? Do you think we have nothing better to do than\nthat? I feel like sending you to a concentration camp. And -- and then he said a few\nmore words I forgot, and then he let me go. But I d -- I didn\u2019t know whether it was\nokayed or not. About five days later I got the paper and -- and he -- I had asked for.\nNovember 19, 2001\nIt was sent to me by mail. And that made it possible for me to leave Germany after\nI had gotten that.",
        "Q: How -- when did you get this final paper in -- how much before Kristallnacht?\nOr had you gotten it before Kristallnacht?",
        "A: What final paper?",
        "Q: That paper you said that you -- you said five days later you received the\npermission.",
        "A: It was after Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: So how did they know, when you came up on Kristallnacht you came up to that\ntable, how did they know that you were --",
        "A: They took my --",
        "Q: -- getting permission to go to the United States?",
        "A: They took my word for it, believe it or not. So in that respect I didn\u2019t have any\nproblem.",
        "Q: Hm. When you were -- were you with your mother and your sister in the square,\nor -- y-you said when you were all called up the next day. Were you standing with\nher?",
        "A: The women and children were sent -- were let g -- were let go, they le-let -- they\nsend them home.",
        "Q: But prior to that, were you standing with her?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: Yes, in -- while we were standing in that public square we were together. And\nthen they -- they said, all women and children go home now, an-and the men have to\ncome with us. And we were taken to that hall.",
        "Q: What was your mother\u2019s state of mind then?",
        "A: She was very much afraid, she was scared. When we were taken out of our\nhouse, there was ou-our two aunts were along with us, and they -- they gave them\nthe push with the -- with the boots to re -- to -- to make her walk a little faster and\nthings like that.",
        "Q: And the overall atmosphere there, of the Jews in that square was what?",
        "A: No, people were mu -- very much afraid, of course. They did not know what they\nhad intended to do with us. But everybody, I guess, was too much o-occupied with\nhis own problems at that moment, with his own worries.",
        "Q: And then you came back home to your mother and sister, after they released you.\nWhat did America mean to you at that point? You were around 23 years old. What\ndid America mean to you?",
        "A: America didn\u2019t mean too much to me e-except that it was ow -- actually our only\nhope to get out and to ha -- to escape from all this.",
        "Q: You knew English by then, you said you had taken English in school.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: Yes, I -- In -- I knew -- I knew English and in -- by the way, in -- in our teacher\u2019s\ncollege, we also had English classes. When I came back from Berlin I took private\nEnglish lessons to -- to improve my English.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: By that time I knew I was -- h-hoping that I was going to America.",
        "Q: And so did you finally get a job in Firth before -- obviously before you left?",
        "A: No, in -- in our own synagogue, in our Reform synagogue, I -- they engaged me\nas a cantor on the high holidays and shortly after. Our former -- our other cantor\nemigrated himself, and they didn\u2019t have a cantor, so for maybe two or three months I\nwas the cantor in that -- in our home synagogue at that time.",
        "Q: And how was the family business doing then?",
        "A: The family business got worse and worse all the time. Of course, customers\ndidn\u2019t come to us, either because they were anti-Semitic, or because they were afraid\nto go into Jewish stores. So it -- it -- and another thing happened, kristall -- a-after\nKristallnacht, about one or two days later, we were told to come to th -- to police\nheadquar -- not police headquarters, the city government in -- in city hall, and we\nwere forced to sign papers that we relinquished our houses, our property, our\nbusinesses and everything, we had to sign -- we had -- just had to sign it away. And I\nremember on the way out when we went home, my mother and I and my sister,\nsome people came down the stairway in the city hall and they were bleeding. So we\nNovember 19, 2001\nasked them what happened. So they said n-n-not much, we just fell -- fell down the\nstairway. But we -- we know that they were -- they were beaten up, but -- they were\npeople who refused to sign, so they forced them this way to sign these papers. So\nafter that we hel -- we had almost nothing to live on.",
        "Q: How would you describe your mother\u2019s state of mind? She was what, probably in\nher -- was she in her late 40\u2019s, early 50\u2019s --",
        "A: Her 50\u2019s.",
        "Q: She was in her 50\u2019s. How stoic was she? Would you describe her as a strong\nwoman?",
        "A: She must have been a strong woman because the way she reacted and first of all,\nshe had a-all the responsibility for me and my sister and the business. The business\ndidn\u2019t exist any more after that, but she -- she had to be strong to go through all this\nthe way she did. She had a lot of help by my aunt, of course, and my uncles.",
        "Q: When you came back -- so you\u2019re -- she did not have the business after that, or\nonce she had to sign over the ownership, then what happened?",
        "A: She couldn\u2019t go into the business any more though it was in our b -- in our house,\nin our building. And then they -- they tried to sell the merchandise and -- for almost\nnothi -- for almost nothing, maybe a tenth of what it was worth, or something like\nthat, and she got only part of that.",
        "Q: A-And --\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: She was completely impoverished now of course, and I remember sh-she had --\nshe asked -- had to ask some other relatives of ours for a -- a loan or something like\nthis, at that time. What she lived on after I -- later, after I left and went to America, I\ndon\u2019t even know.",

        "Q: How did you make those arrangements, which boat and so forth.",
        "A: I -- [knew some other people who had made the same arrangement, and they --\nthey helped me, they told me where to go and what to do. I had to correspond, of\ncourse with the -- especially with the American consulate in Stuttgart at that time.\nAnd I contacted the Holland America line for my passage to -- from Holland to\nNew York. And I know after th -- af -- after 1t was -- this was paid, there wasn\u2019t\nreally much left for my mother. I arrived here with 12 dollars in [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And so your mother gave you the money t-to pay for the passage?",
        "A: Yes. That was the family money, you know.",
        "Q: And w-were you in agreement that you should be the one to have left? Did you\nagree with that also? Was that something you felt was the right decision?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: Yes. Yes, I was in agreement with that. I really believed the fact that I wa --\nbeing a man I was more in danger than the rest of my family, sister, mother,\ngrandmother, aunts and so on.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So when it came time to leave, what did you take with you? Did you\ntake anything special?",
        "A: [ha -- I -- I -- e-everything I took along was two suitcases, which I carried in my\ntwo hands. That\u2019s all I -- I could take along. Though I'd be -- I had intended before\nto take a lot more, and we had bought a lot before it -- about a year before I left, we\nhad bought a lot of things for me, clothes and ba -- a fan and all kinds of things. And\na -- \u2019da--I-- I couldn\u2019t take all that along, of course.",
        "Q: Because they told you you couldn\u2019t?",
        "A: Yes. They told us that time that that\u2019s all you could take along, just what you\ncould carry with your hands.",
        "Q: Besides clothes, what did you take?",
        "A: That was about all I could take, clothes. There wasn\u2019t much more left.",
        "Q: So, could you take any music, any instruments?",
        "A: No, I could not take any instruments along, but a couple of music books I think I\ntook along.",
        "Q: Family photographs?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: Very few. And that was something I really missed very much, but later on, when\nI was in America, | -- I had ways of getting some pictures, which I hadn\u2019t --which I\nmissed very much and which I didn't have. So I was able to get some of these\npictures [indecipherable]",
        "Q: What was it like to say goodbye to your family?",
        "A: It was very, very hard because at that time | -- I -- I was afraid I would never see\nthem again, which really happened.

        "Q: An-Any trouble on the train up to the border?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have any trouble, but I know that many other people did. They had\ntrouble when they -- when they crossed the border. I didn\u2019t have any problems in\nthat respect.",

        "Q: Mm-hm. And your first view of New York?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: It was very -- I was very much impressed when I saw New York. I didn\u2019t have to\ngo to Ellis Island, that was not in use any more at that time, and I was processed ou-\noutside New York City, on the boat. An immigration agent came on board -- an\nimmigration inspector came on board and took care of our papers and everything, so\nI didn\u2019t have to go to Ellis Island or any -- any other place like that.",

But as a cantor I had some hope. But it just happened that at that time all the\nEuropean cantors arrived in New York City in those years, and then there was a lot\nof competition. And I -- I auditioned in a couple of places, in a couple of\nsynagogues, but I guess the competition was too strong. So then I looked for any\nkind of a job, and I -- I found job in a department store as a -- as a busboy. That\u2019s\nKlein Union Square, that was a pretty well known place in New York. There were\nmany other refugees working there too, and I had to do the basic things, I had to\npick up dre-dresses which fell down to the floor by the hundreds, and brought -- did\nstock work and all that.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nNovember 19, 2001\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",

        "A: Wa -- 1 -- from that time on we could not write any more. We could write only\nRed Cross letters, and that happened -- we couldn\u2019t do that too often, so I had very\nfew letters from them, actually. My sister also tried to get -- tried to go to England.\nThere was a possibility for a young woman to get -- to go to England as a -- as a\ndomestic h-helper, and she got a job like this. But three days before the war -- no,\nshe was supposed to go there and begin -- in the beginning of September the war\nNovember 19, 2001\nbroke out, and -- about three days before she would have gone, so she -- she couldn\u2019t\ngo.

        "Q: And -- and you both continued to work at your same jobs, and then you said you\nwent to work on the uniform factory, and then you got drafted. And where did you\nstart your training?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: I was -- I -- in Fort Dix, New Jersey, like everybody else and we were all\nclassified -- we were supposed to be classified according to our f -- our previous\nexperiences and then -- and professions. So I told them I had a Master\u2019s degree in\neducation and what I did before and all that. And then when they heard I worked in\nthe department store as a floor boy, they classified me as a laborer, but they -- they\ndid write down that I spoke German. So I -- I became a member of the medical corps,\nand was about to be sent overseas to the Pacific in the field hospital, and two weeks\nbefore I was supposed to ship out, I was reclassified. They found out that I speak --\nthey finally noticed that I speak German and I ba -- I became a member of military\nintelligence. I -- I went to fort -- to a camp in -- in Maryland, near Hagerstown,\nCamp Ritchie, which was a t -- a training camp for military intelligence, not only\nfor German speaking, but for other languages too.

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was that difficult?",
        "A: It was difficult, but I -- I was al -- always hoping to -- to be able to go home\nevery couple of weeks you know, and -- and to furlough a -- a day off. And I was\nsent to -- first I was -- but that was before I was in military intelligence, I was in th --\nin the -- in a camp right outside New York City. I\u2019m just trying to remember the\nname of that. It was ha -- Halloran Hospital on Staten Island. And they needed me\nthere because they had a lot of German prisoners, and I had to work as an interrogat\n-- as a interpreter and I had to go around with nurses and doctors, had to make the\nrounds when they saw the patients. They used me as an interpreter.",
        "Q: Who were the patients? Who were these patients?",
        "A: They were German prisoners from Africa. They were members of the Africa\ncorps. These were all fanatics -- fanatical Nazis who were volunteers.

And they depended a lot on me, of course, so was -- they very ni -- were\nvery nice to me.",
        "Q: Did you let them know you were Jewish?",
        "A: No. They didn\u2019t even know that I was German. They -- when they asked me\nwhere I learned my German I told them I learned it in high school and they were\nsatisfied with that. They didn\u2019t question it for a moment.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "Q: And how did you feel inside looking at these German soldiers?",
        "A: I hated them, of course, and I -- I -- I used them for certain purposes. I was able\nto go home almost every night to -- to Manhattan, and I came home at two, three\no\u2019clock in the morning, I was always tired. Of course, I had to get up at 5:30 again.\nSo there were a lot of empty beds. So I rested on these -- I slept on these beds, and I\nput these German soldiers in -- up as guards on both ends of the -- of -- of the room\nin case my own people came and checked on me. So they guarded my sleep. So I -- I\n-- I took advantage of them.",
        "Q: Had you changed your name at this point?",
        "A: Not at this point but later on when I was in military intelligence, I was advised to\nchange my name because my family was still supposed to be alive, or at least I did\nnot know any different. I thought I\u2019m di -- in case I\u2019d become a prisoner, it might be\nharmful for them or even for -- and for me too. They advised me to change my name.\nSo within one day I re -- changed my name. I didn't know what to changed it to --\nwhat to change it to. So I took a telephone book and the -- the first name I ran into\nwas Stevens. So I changed my name to Fred Stevens. At the same time my name --\nmy wife\u2019s name was Goldman. Who -- we both had different names at that time.",
        "Q: So -- so -- but up to that point you had been Siegfried Goldman?",

        "A: Then I was sent to -- to the European theater [indecipherable] Germany. First to\nfr -- to England and France and then I -- to France for the front lines, and I had to\ninterrogate war prisoners.",
        "Q: These are German prisoners?",
        "A: German prisoners.",
        "Q: And -- and again, what was your re-response, your reaction?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: And again, what was your reaction when you talked to these German soldiers?",
        "A: In the beginning it was a strange experience, but later on I got used to that too.\nAnd I -- whenever I had a chance, I tried to get information from these prisoners\nabout what happened to the Jews, to -- to th -- to European Jews under -- under\nHitler, and -- but they couldn\u2019t tell me much. One of them was from\nTheresienstadt and -- and later on I found out my mother actually was at Theresien\n-- maybe -- I think I knew it already, at that time. I had a Red Cross letter. That was\nthe last letter I ever -- I ever got from my mother, from Theresienstadt. And just\nNovember 19, 2001\none soldier was from Theresienstadt, so I tried to find out as much as I could, but\nhe didn\u2019t know much, either.",
        "Q: How did it feel to go back to Europe?",
        "A: I had mixed feelings about it, of course. I hated the people, of course, and\nespecially these German soldier I got in touch with. And that was my main feeling,\nactually, about it. Actually, the feelings were not mixed.",
        "Q: Did you tell other people about that? Di -- were the other army personnel that you\ncame in contact, aware of your background?",
        "A: N-Not normally, but I remember one instance at the end -- near the end of the\nwar when everything moved very fast and we marched through Germany -- I mean,\nI didn\u2019t march, we dr-drove through Germany. Be -- we went through the -- the\nsmall town in -- in south Germany where my -- my grandfather was born. So I told\nmy fellow Americans that we are going through the town where my grandfather was\nborn. I remember I -- I -- I told them that time.",
        "Q: But they knew about your background?",
        "A: I hadn\u2019t told them about it before, but they were not too interested in it.",
        "Q: So most people thought you were born in America?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what my -- what my American f-fellow soldiers thought at that -- I\ndon\u2019t know. But the Germans I got in c -- 1n contact with during the year or so I\nspent in Germany, they all thought I was -- I d -- I did not tell them that I came\nNovember 19, 2001\nfrom Germany. | told them the English I know I learned in high school and they\nbelieved it, strange enough as it sounds.",
        "Q: So where were you in -- in Germany? Where were you stationed?",
        "A: I was all over Germany, we -- | -- I came from France, from Alsace. We\ncrossed the Rhine and then we went to south Germany, but that was in the -- near\nthe end of the war. As a matter of fact we came to the point when interrogations of\nprisoners were -- was not even necessary any more. They cou -- they could not --\nthey didn\u2019t need any more interrogations. It was -- 1t was nearing the end and\neverything moved so fast that it wasn\u2019t necessary to get information from them. So\nthey used me for different purposes. I was -- became a member of a task force, we\nhad to interrogate pri -- civilians about certain -- about Nazis, big Nazis. Where they\nwere located and -- and factories where -- where they manufactured war materials,\nwhere they were trying to -- to build an A bomb and things like that. They were all\nsecret targets which we had to visit. So we -- we tr -- we traveled around in teams of\nsix each and o-of course I had to interpret for y -- for the officers who -- who -- who\nquestioned these people. Oh, I did some of -- some of my own interrogating, too.\nAnd we found it -- some important places.",
        "Q: What can you tell -- what can you say now, 50 - 60 years later? Wh-When you\nsay you found important places, such as?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: No, th-they were hidden places where they -- where the Germans di -- did a --\nexperimented with certain things. Chemicals and a-a-all the way, I guess, trying to --\nto find an -- an -- an atomic bomb, to build an atomic bomb.",
        "Q: And then you would relay this message to your superiors?",
        "A: Yes, I did, yes. I wrote reports of what we saw and what we found.",
        "Q: Do you remember where these places were, where they worked on these?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know -- remember any spe -- any particular places. Then a -- then I --\nI wound up in a -- in a camp near Frankfurt where a lot of -- that was at the -- a-\nafter the end of the war already, when -- where they kept a lot of high German\nofficials and officers, generals and admirals and so on, near ha -- near Hamburg.\nAnd then they put me on -- then I had to work on documents di -- di -- that was\nalready in preparation for the war crime trials in Nuremberg later on. So I wrote for\na couple of weeks on documents as I had to find out which documents they might be\nable to use, which might be important to them. So I -- I had to -- to ma -- make\ndecisions what might be necessary for the war crime trials and whatnot. That was\nvery interesting work and I liked that. I had a couple of people working under me\nwho did the same work and a -- I was in charge of that.",
        "Q: When -- before the end of the war, when you were moving around Germany, did\nyou see any Jewish refugees? Did you come across any of them?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: No, I -- I -- I found I -- we were in -- in a couple of small -- of these small labor\ncamps where they kept j -- especially in south Germany they had lots of them. They\nactually belonged to the big concentration camps, they were branches. And they\nwere small camps, strictly for -- for forced labor, and some of them were all Jewish.\nSo I -- in -- in two cases I was the first Jewish American soldier who -- who entered\nthem. And they were very happy to see me. I tol -- I told them of course that I was\nJewish. In one camp I remember they -- they begged me I should -- I should protect\ntheir camp commander who was f -- who was very good to them, protected them,\nand they asked me to protect him.",
        "Q: Were you able to do that?",
        "A: I passed on the information I had. That\u2019s all I could do at the time.",
        "Q: What was the name of the camp?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that. They were small camps, I don\u2019t remember.",

        "A: That was in ba -- in Bavaria in south Germany.",
        "Q: How did you feel, here you, thank goodness was able to get out of Germany, and\nnow you come back and you see these Jews who were not able to get back -- get out.\nHow -- ho -- what does that feel like?",
        "A: At what point?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "Q: When you said you were in the army and you were talking to these Jewish people\nin the labor camps.",
        "A: Then it was much later already and it was at -- near -- that was shortly after the\nend of the war. We were, in a -- in a way the army of occupation. We were actually\n[indecipherable] military government already at that point.",
        "Q: But my question was, how did you feel inside? Did you feel an affinity for these\npeople, a connection to these people?",
        "A: No, not at all. For the Germans, you mean?",
        "Q: No, no, no, for the Jewish --",
        "A: Oh yeah, certainly. I tried to help them in any way I could. I\u2019m -- I met som -- a\nlot of these DPs later on, who lived in Germany shortly after the war and I did\nanything I could for them. By the way, I also met my -- my brother-in-law after the\nend of the war when I came -- I came back, I went back to Fiirth 1-1n the end -- the\nwar was over in -- in May, and in June or July I -- I got myself a pass from my\ncommander to go back to my hometown to see 1-1f -- by a sheer miracle maybe some\nof my relatives came back.

        "Q: This is while you were in -- in other words, under the G.I. Bill? You mean you to",

        "Q: Mm-hm. And you started to work in that field?",

        "Q: Right, mm-hm. So you stayed in the diamond setting business in New York?",
        "A: Yes. I did something else. I -- I became an organist. I had started already when I -\n- when I was in Berlin, in the Jewish teacher\u2019s college, I had taken a course in organ\nNovember 19, 2001\nplaying already. And when I -- when I was back in New York later on, somebo --\nsomebody o-offered me this job in the synagogue in Washington Heights. So I -- I\ntrained myself actually. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m partly self taught when it comes to the organ. But\nI was able to get this job and later on I improved myself because I went to a bigger\nsynagogue. So I had the side income for a long time as an organist, for 35 years.",
        "Q: And how long did you stay in New York?",
        "A: Until 12 years ago -- 18 years ago. Eighte -- 18 years ago we moved here, to\nSilver Spring.",

        "Q: Do you do anything with your music now?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: No, except give piano lessons. I gave piano lessons to my gra -- each and every\none of my six grandchildren.",
        "Q: Do you th -- d-do you feel very German today, and -- well, do you feel very\nGerman and what are your thoughts about Germany?",
        "A: I never felt very German in my life, because when I see what happened to Jews\nwho became too attached to one country, I -- I thought it\u2019s not a good thing to be\nvery patriotic. But later on I -- I -- I felt differently about America, of course.",
        "Q: Did your -- did your children when they were growing up ask you a lot of\nquestions about your childhood, and what had happened to you and why you came\nhere?",
        "A: Yes, they were very interested. My grandchildren, too. And two years ago I\nstarted to write my memoirs and I\u2019m st -- I\u2019m still not completely finished with it,\nwith the purpose, of course, to sh -- to le-let my grandchildren -- my children and\ngrandchildren read it. As much as I told them about my -- my past, there were many\nthings, of course, I didn\u2019t remember, and this way I wanted to gi -- give them more\nto know about my past.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Fred Goldman. This is tape number two, side\nNovember 19, 2001\nB. You were talking about how you\u2019ve written down your memoirs for your children\nand your grandchildren and -- and many of the details are c-coming back.",
        "A: What did you --",
        "Q: And you said you wanted -- you wanted to tell them the fuller story, that many of\nthe details have come back to you.",
        "A: The reason for my -- for writing my memoirs was to give them a more detailed\nstory of my past. It was the main reason why I did this.",
        "Q: Why is that important?",
        "A: I think it\u2019s very important that they know what happened to me. In a way I felt it\nwas my duty to let them know about my past.",
        "Q: Do you feel that you would be a different person if you hadn\u2019t gone through the\nexperiences that you did? Did those experiences shape you? Your experience under\nNazism, having to leave your family, start a new life? If you hadn\u2019t had to go\nthrough that, do you think you would have been a different person today?",
        "A: Yeah, I think so. I\u2019m almost sure that I -- my -- my life was shaped by -- by what\nhappened to me, and my experiences and what I saw in my life. It must have had a\nbi -- a big influence on my -- on my life.",
        "Q: In what way\u201d?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: Living 1-1-in Nazi Germany for six years certainly must have done a lot to me\nwhich ma -- otherwise would not -- would not have done anything. Would not have\nhappened.",
        "Q: Did it make you more fearful?",
        "A: In the beginning, yes. It did make me more fearful. When we ca -- when I came\nhere, and my wife told me the same -- that happened to many German refugees who\ncame at that time, we didn\u2019t even speak loud. We were -- were not used to speaking\nth -- in the normal way. We whispered. And th -- and this went on for quite awhile\nand it took me a long time and I\u2019m sure it must have happened to others, too.",
        "Q: Because you didn\u2019t want other people to hear you speaking German, 1s that it?",
        "A: No, because we were always afraid in Germany to speak loud, that Nazis didn\u2019t\nhear what we were talking -- saying to each other. So we got used to s -- to speaking\nvery softly. Now one thing I would like to tell you in that respect. My daughter\ncomplained to us when she was an adult already that she -- she was influenced very\nmuch by our behavior. She -- she -- she must have felt how sad we were and she\nfeels that this influenced her life very much so. And later on we asked our son 1-1f he\nhad the same experience and he said no, because this was already six years later and\nhe was not so mu -- we were not as much influenced by our past any more six years\nlater, than she was.",
        "Q: And how did that affect her?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: It made her sad, too.",
        "Q: And how did you explain to your children that they had no extended relatives?",
        "A: They know -- they know why. They never -- they never knew what it means to\nhave a -- a grandparent, for instance.",
        "Q: How old were they when you explained what really happened to them?",
        "A: Certainly not -- not too early. They must have been in their teens by that time, or\nmaybe a little earlier when we told them all that.",
        "Q: And how did they take that knowledge?",
        "A: They took it as a matter of fact. I mean, they -- they took it as a fact. They met\nsome other people, the -- older people who took the place of their grandparents.\nThey became grandparent figures for them, and they almost considered them as\ngrandparents.",
        "Q: Were these other German refugees?",
        "A: Yes, they were, yes.",
        "Q: So when you and your wife were starting out in life together, were your friends\nother German refugees, or Americans? Who did you s-spend your time with?",
        "A: They were mostly -- they were mostly German refugees too, in our earlier years.\nLater on of course, this was different. Now our fre -- we have mixed friends, all\ntypes, but at that time, we lived in -- in an -- in areas where there mo -- were mostly\nrefugees, like in Washington Heights in New York.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "Q: So your children grew up knowing other German refugee people?",
        "A: Yes, they did, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Are there any sights today or sounds today that you hear or you see that\ntrigger memories of Nazi Germany\u201d",
        "A: Yes, there are. You -- you -- you see movies, for instance, of that area. Confer --\ncon -- like, you know, wh-where concentration camps were pictured, and ...there are\nall kinds of things which remind you. Sometimes books you read, magazines you\nsee. My wife seems to be more sensitive to this than I am. My wife would never go\nback to Germany, for instance. Many other refugees have been invited to go back to\ntheir hometowns by -- by the -- by the city governments of these places, and many\ndid go back, and my wife would never go back. I am not too tempted to go back\neither, but I\u2019m not as strict about this as my wife is. I feel this -- it\u2019s three\ngenerations later and I don\u2019t think you can blame the present generation for the sins\nof their grandparents. And working -- working 1n the Holocaust Museum, I see a lot\nof magazine -- magazines of present Germany and I -- and I see that they -- they\nhave changed.",
        "Q: D-D-Do you -- would you go back to Furth if they invited you back?",
        "A: We have been invited back, a c -- a couple of times [indecipherable] I don\u2019t\nthink I want to, no.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "Q: Why not? I-I know what -- n-not from your wife\u2019s point of view, but your point\nof view.",
        "A: [indecipherable] There\u2019s still -- still too many bad memories from that time, and\nespecially if I see the older generations, my own generation, I would hate to see\nthem when I go back to Germany. I have nothing against the young ones, but the\nolder ones I don\u2019t want to meet again.",
        "Q: Did you have any close non-Jewish friends when you were growing up, and how\nwould you feel if you met them now?",
        "A: I had a ver -- very good friend, a Christian friend who went to school with me,\ngraduated with me and everything. He became an -- a -- a doctor and he became a\nmember of the armed -- German armed forces and he was in Russia all the time as a\ndoctor, a German army doctor. And I -- I met him when I -- when I went back to\nvisit my brother-in-law and I kept up my -- th -- my friendship with him. And he -- I\nreally believe he was never a Nazi. As a matter of fact, near the end of my -- when --\nof the time when I was in Germany, he made -- he made it a point to walk with me\nand -- through the streets in Furth, to be seen with me. So I kept on corresponding\nwith him until he died of -- a couple of years ago. There were exceptions, of course,\nnot all ba -- not all Germans were bad. I\u2019m the last one to believe that.",
        "Q: When your children were the age that you were when Hitler came to power, 18 -\n19 - 20 and then all the difficult years between 1933 and \u201939, when your children\nNovember 19, 2001\nwere that same age that you were, did it remind you of those six difficult years you\nlived through in Germany\u201d",
        "A: No, I never saw any connection between myself and my children in that respect.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They lived a completely different life and didn\u2019t know anything about it except\nfor the few things which we -- we told them.",
        "Q: Are you angry that you had to go through the experiences that you did and other\nJews did not, let\u2019s say in this country?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t understand the question.",
        "Q: Are you angry that you had to go through what you did in Germany, through\nNazism, losing your family and so forth, and other Jews in the -- for instance, in this\ncountry, did not have to go through that. Does that make you angry?",
        "A: No, it doesn\u2019t, 1t does not make me angry, but it -- it frustrates me sometimes that\nAmerican Jews don\u2019t seem to understand what we went through and went through\nthe experiences, and many of them are not even interested in it. I wouldn\u2019t say the\nmajority does that, but there are -- I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve -- ve run into a number of them who\ndon\u2019t abs -- absolutely understand what Nazism meant at that time, what it did to the\nJews. Of course they -- they -- they couldn\u2019t know. You have to experience it\nyourself, otherwise you -- they just don\u2019t know. For instance, I remember I had a\nconversation with one man I knew pretty well in this building here. He asked me one\nNovember 19, 2001\ntime, I co -- I don\u2019t understand that you German Jews didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t go to the\nnearest gun store, bought yourself a rifle or a gun and defended yourself. Having\nknown what went on, and what the circumstances were, this is sheer nonsense, was\ncompletely impossible. If I had done that, if I had shot a -- a -- a German that time,\nthey -- they wo -- they -- fi -- 10 minutes later they would have killed a thousand\nothers -- sa -- a thousand Jews. So I couldn\u2019t understand that a well educated and\ninformed man like him could even think of that. That was not understandable to me.",
        "Q: So you feel the importance of Holocaust education, I assume.",
        "A: R-Right. It\u2019s very important. And I know that the Holocaust Museum plays a\nlarge part in that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. How has your experience affected how y -- your feelings of being\nJewish? Did it change you spiritually, religiously in any way having undergone this\nbecause you were Jewish?",
        "A: What was your original question?",
        "Q: Ho-How has all that you\u2019ve lived through affected your feelings about being\nJewish?",
        "A: No, it has not affected my feelings about being Jewish, in any way. It hasn\u2019t\nmade me more religious or less religious. It just didn\u2019t affect me in that respect.",

        "A: Yes, I\u2019m very much in favor of the Civil Rights movement, not that I personally\nwas active in it, of course, but I have a lot of sympathy for it. I feel it\u2019s the right\nthing to do.",
        "Q: After all, you lived in a country where the civil rights were taken away.",
        "A: Right. There\u2019s a s-special reason why I -- I\u2019m in favor of the Civil Rights\nmovement, because I see what happens if it\u2019s not --",

        "A: Yes, I do. Especially si -- since I\u2019m -- I\u2019m working in the hol -- in the Holocaust\nMuseum, that of course has a lot to do with it. \u2019m constantly reminded o-of things\nat that time.",
        "Q: What were you -- what were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: I -- I admired the fa -- the fact, of course, that -- that Israel was able to -- to do\nthat, get him out of s -- of South America and bring him to Israel. I was very proud\nof Israel at that time, that they could put him on trial. That they -- to capture in --\nhim in -- I think in Argentina and bring him to Israel. I was very proud of that fact.\nThat\u2019s the right thing to do, of course.",

        "Q: Wh-Why is that?",
        "A: Because I s -- I see that if it -- if this as a story is not told, it might happen again.\nIt might be a way of preventing a future Hitler from appearing.",

I\u2019m surprised that now, after 60 years almost after the end of the war,\nthat they are still -- there\u2019s still more available. I expected three years ago that they\nwouldn\u2019t have any more work for me, but it seems they do. They get a lot of\ncollections now. Letter collections. Letters which people wrote to their relatives.\nNovember 19, 2001\nPeople who were left behind in Germany and their children were in a -- in foreign\ncountries already. And many people it see -- it seems, send these letter collections to\nthe Holocaust Museum now, and asked -- asked the Holocaust Museum to have\nthem translated.",

        "A: Lessons which I\u2019ve learned by working in the Holocaust Museum?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I was very happy to see that so many people, looking at the nu -- large numbers\nof volunteers there, very happy to see that people are interested in it.

        "A: No, I don\u2019t think I have a special relationship with them. I meet a lot of them, I\nam a member of the survivor\u2019s group, and that\u2019s when I -- when I meet them\nsometimes wa -- once a month. And I\u2019m very happy to see there are so many in this\ngroup. I never considered myself a survivor, not having been in the concentration\ncamp. Originally I thought survivors are only people who went through a\nconcentration camp and are survivors of concentration camps. But I am not, and the\nNovember 19, 2001\n-- I see there are many others on the same position. But it seems we are -- we are\nconsidered survivors in -- like in my case having lived in -- in Nazi Germany for six\nyears.",

        "Q: As opposed to walking into another government building, let\u2019s say, why is that\nbuilding different than another Federal building?",
        "A: Because it has a lot more meaning to me than other government buildings.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "Q: What -- what kind of meaning? What kind of meaning does it have to you, does\nthat building represent to you?",
        "A: I feel it -- it -- it\u2019s very important to me. More important to a -- to other\ngovernment buildings, because of my fate and of what\u2019s happened to me. And\nbecause I\u2019m becoming more and more convinced that it\u2019s very important to ha -- to -\n- to have the Holocaust Museum. I\u2019m surprised to see there\u2019s a -- so many non-Jews\nare going there. To me it looks bi -- looking around, I have the feeling that 80 to 85\npercent of the people who come there are non-Jews, and I\u2019m very happy to see that\nthey seem to be interested. Of course, they don\u2019t come all -- they don\u2019t all come on\ntheir own account, they come besa -- because they\u2019re being sent by I don\u2019t know\nwhom.",
        "Q: Is it appropriate that there is this building in the United States, in Washington?",
        "A: Definitely. It\u2019s very important. They should have more Holocaust museums in\nthe rest of the country. There should be more -- more of them. Like in new yor -- in\nNew York City, they -- they have some kind of a Holocaust museum, but it -- it\u2019s\nnot what this one 1s. Th -- like th-the new one they have in New York is only -- only\npart of it is Holocaust museum, the rest 1s jew -- Jewish museum. I understand only\none floor there is u -- being used for that purpose, right?",

        "A: Yes, I\u2019ve been there, a number of years ago. And I was very impressed by there,\ntoo. But of course, the Washington mem -- memorial hol -- Holocaust Museum 1s\nbetter for the purpose it is supposed to be. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s more technically advanced,\nwhatever they show, than what I saw that time in Yad Vashem. So people must be\nmore impressed with what they see.",
        "Q: Have you had any very powerful experiences or memorable experiences when\nyou\u2019re working there? You did mention how when you read letters from people who\nwere left behind that that was very touching. Any other memorable experiences you\ncan talk about?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. I know many people -- many other people did, but I can not\nremember of any case that I was especially impressed by something.",
        "Q: Are -- is there -- are there any particular parts of the museum, or the exhibits with\nwhich you identify, when you\u2019ve gone through the exhibit? Do you see anything that\nreally touches you personally?",

        "Q: You\u2019re talking about the tiles, the room with the tiles?",
        "A: The tiles, right, yes. They impress me very much and I go there very often to look\nat these tiles. Some of them are excellent of these tiles. They tell you a lot. It also\nshows how children, espe -- especially children react to these events. What means\nNovember 19, 2001\nmore to them than to other people and -- and so on. I think that\u2019s an excellent idea to\nhave these on -- on -- so prominently displayed as they are.",
        "Q: In the permanent exhibit, wa -- in the beginning when it shows life in Germany\nand then the increasing restrictions that were imposed on the Jews -- do you know\nwhat I mean, in the -- on the top floor, on the fourth floor, when you read this, does\nit bring it all back to you, what you lived through in the 30\u2019s?",
        "Q: Yeah, it certainly brings everything back to me. I had the same experiences. But\nof course, in my case it\u2019s a long time. That was 60 years ago or more, so maybe\nthese impressions were not too strong 1-in me any more. But now, of course, this --\nthis all reminds me very much of what\u2019s happened.",
        "Q: So you feel as you\u2019ve gotten older and for -- farther removed in time, it does\nmake a difference?",
        "A: Yes. It certainly brings 1t back much -- much better. When I see these things I -- I\nnotice that I had forgotten many things which happened that time to me and to th --\nto the other Jewish people and which slowly diminished in my -- in my memory.\nThis brings it back again, very much.",
        "Q: Did you have to change your name to Israel or add your name Israel to your\npapers?",
        "A: Yeah, I did have to sha -- like everybody else. I still have it in my old passport\nwhen I -- when I left Germany. Everybody had to do that.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "Q: What did you feel like when you had to do that, when you were forced to do that?",
        "A: There were so many other th-things, and worse things which happened to us in\nthat time, that it didn\u2019t make any particular impression on me. I considered it more\nas a nuisance, I think, at the time when it happened. Seeing -- with all the other\nthings hap -- happening to us, that was only a small part. Comparively -- a small\nnuisance compared to many other things which happened which were much worse at\nthat time.",

        "A: Frankly, I don\u2019t remember that. I don\u2019t think we ever discussed it.",
        "Q: Do you receive reparations from Germany\u201d",
        "A: Yes, I do. I got restitution for a number of things. For the loss -- for the loss of\nour house, our business and 1-interruption of our education. But it was -- it -- it\ndidn\u2019t amount to much money. And for many things I didn't get anything at all. For\ninstance, the value of our -- our stock in th -- in our business, you know.",
        "Q: Did it take a long time to receive it?",
        "A: Yes, it was very difficult, very hard. It had something to do with the fact that our\n-- my lawyer was not very efficient, I think. He was -- I guess he was too old at the\ntime. For every letter I -- I wrote, I had to wait -- wait a long [indecipherable]\nsometimes I had to write three or four times to get a answer -- an answer from him.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "Q: Thi-This was the lawyer in Germany?",
        "A: Yes, it was a Jewish lawyer. It was in Furth. Maybe that\u2019s the reason why I took\nhim that time. And I -- then later on I changed lawyers, then it was a little better.",

        "A: I don\u2019t think so. Whatever I -- I think my grandchildren should learn about it or\nfind out will be in-included in my life\u2019s story, in my memoirs. And I must have put\nthat down already in my memortrs.",

In Germany it was\nnot called Reform, it was called Liberal, and Liberal was not as liberal as in -- as in\nthis -- Reform was not as reformed as in America. It was a little less reformed. For\ninstance, men and women were sitting separately in the synagogue, though we had\nan organ and otherwise when we consider Reformed service. But -- but -- but the\nsexes were separated.",

        "A: I was very active in that respect. I loved to play soccer. Later, when Hitler came\nto power, all Jewish kids joined -- th-th-they founded Jewish sports clubs because\nwe were not allowed to be members of others. So that was also a social outlet for all\nJewish kids. So I was very active there. F-F-Field and track, and soccer I played and\nI was -- I wa -- I was one of the socc -- soccer players on my team and we traveled\nevery Sunday to -- to towns nearby and played games there. I was very active as far\nas sports are concerned. And I was the -- one of the best athletes in si -- in high\nschool, too. Was my special ambition because being the only Jew in my class, I -- I\nexcelled in that respect, and I knew that the Germans respected people who were\nphysically active and successful.",
        "A: I was 10 years old.",
        "A: 19.",
        "A: No, I was not -- because the situation changed all the time. When the rights were\ntaken away from all Jews, I -- you had less possibilities and chances t-to go to\ncertain schools and universities. As a matter of fact, shortly after Hitler came to\npower, Jews could not go to colleges any more, and universities. So I had to change\nmy professional plans all the time.\nNovember 19, 2001",

        "A: My first recollection of Hitler is shortly after he came to power, there was a\nboycott of all Jewish stores, all over Germany. That me -- 1t meant that storm\ntroopers stood in front of -- a couple of storm troopers stood in front of all Jewish\nstores and stopped people from going in. The -- well, that lasted only a couple of\ndays and then they discontinued that, but it made a deep impression on me that time.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, in the beginning, hardly any changes took place, this all happened later, very\ngradually. So that was one reason why we all thought it might end very suddenly\nagain. We thought it couldn\u2019t last, that Hitler would be thrown out again, and we\nthought it only for a short while. We couldn\u2019t believe that this would stay forever.\nBut later on of course, 1t got more serious.",
        "A: Oh yes. These were the only people you could talk with about things like them.\nWe were always very careful to make remarks about Hitler in the Nazi time, so I\nspoke only to my -- mainly to my family about this. Actually, my father was not\nalive any more when Hitler came to power. My father died in 1927.",
        "A: He had a stroke, he was awa-away -- away on vacation and he -- he died of a\nstroke.",

        "A: For the time.",
        "A: For the time being.",
        "A: In the beginning there was hardly any change in 1933, but 30 -- \u2019?34, and shortly\nafter that, it slowly changed. In the beginning I was still very friendly with all of --\nwe were a class of 25, who stayed together by the way, until the nine years were\nOver, SO we -- we were always together. So I was still very friendly with most --\nalmost all of them. And then --",
        "A: Yes, boys and girls, right. And they kept on talking to me, we had friendly\nrelations, but slowly they all joined the Hitler youth, the Nazi organization. And\nthey didn\u2019t stop talking to me, but they were -- they were still more distant. And\nslowly this changed too, for the worse.",
        "A: My teachers behaved all right. They didn\u2019t show any anti-Semitism, even\nactually up to the end when -- when I left. When I -- when I -- when high school was\nover. But I was banned from certain activities in school. When they were in\nnationalistic celebrations or national holidays, in -- in which I always had taken part\nof before, we were banned from these thing -- I was banned from there, which I\nactually didn\u2019t mind.

        "A: I felt very German in the beginning, but this changed when Hitler came to\npower, of course, it\u2019s changed completely. And a-at that time I was of -- felt more\nJewish than I had before.",
        "A: No, there weren\u2019t any book burnings in Furth which I was aware of. I don\u2019t\nthink there were any.",
        "A: Actually, we were in an -- in an area of Germany which was very, very Nazi.\nNurem -- we were right next to Nuremberg, which it was the -- the place where\nevery year the Nazi party had a --",
        "A: It was more than a rally, actually. It was a -- they were -- can almost say a million\nof -- of storm troopers and all kinds of party members gathered in the -- in\nNuremberg. And of course, being -- Furth being so close was -- was affected in\nthat way, too. So the place was full of Nazis every year in fall.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: Of course we didn\u2019t like it at all and we felt -- we were looking forward to the\nday -- it last five, six days. We were looking forward to the day when that was over.\nIn the beginning we were not actually afraid that something would happen to us, but\nI -- I know that a couple of Jewish people were beaten up on the street and insulted\nand that happened, by the way, in other ways, too. Slowly, 1933 - \u00b034 - \u201935, it got\nworse, and people were insulted on the streets. They called us dirty Jews and many\ntimes they -- they hit us, especially the young people.",
        "A: I personally was never attacked, but I was insulted a couple of times. People\ncame over to me and insulted me.",
        "A: Dirty Jew, and you should get out of Germany and things like that.",
        "A: There isn\u2019t much you could do, we just try to walk away as fast as we could.",
        "A: Yes, I always told my parents about it.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: Yes, it -- it kept on going for awhile, then it got worse and worse because of all\nthe anti-Semitic propaganda in Germany. Customers stayed away and slowly\nbusiness got worse.",
        "A: Just a -- no, just on that one day in 1933 when there was that German boycott,\nwhich covered all of Germany.",
        "A: When I was finished I had -- I had to make the decision what to do after it, which\nwas --",
        "A: There was no -- no celebration or anything like this. We -- the one that took place\nin school, I don\u2019t think I took part of. Yeah, I remember now. I was -- I was a\nmember of the s -- of the -- I played piano pretty well, and I accompanied so -- acco\n-- I was supposed to accompany a couple of singers at the final celebrations at the\ngraduation. And I was supposed to play two solos, piano solos, and that was in 1933.\nSo in the last moment I was told that I couldn\u2019t do it.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: I was very disappointed, of course. That was my first chance to perform in public\nand I was -- I had looked forward to it, so I was disappointed.",
        "A: I think I was angry, yes.",
        "A: That due to the political situation, I -- I could not take part in this.",
        "A: No, being the only Jew in my class, I -- I was the only one. So of course, they --\nthey told me that before already.",
        "A: No, some of the other Jewish kids went to different schools, different high\nschools, which did not -- which were not humanistic gymnasium. And it just\nhappened that in my -- in -- in my age group I was the only one.",
        "A: Can you -- can you excuse me for a second?",
        "A: When I had to make a choice what to do after high school, 1 -- 1t was very hard.\nAs I said before, you could not -- colleges and universities were not open to you any\nNovember 19, 2001\nmore. So I, be-being very much interested in music, I was looking for some activity\nfor something to do in connection with music. An-And I thought of becoming a\ncantor in the synagogue. There was a Jewish teacher\u2019s college in Berlin, and I asked\na couple of my -- we had some acquaintances which were -- knew a lot about music\nand s -- and voice and singing and so on. So I consulted some of our friends, sang\nfor them, and asked them if -- if they thought my voice was good enough to be a\ncantor. So I finally heard of s -- of the Jewish teacher\u2019s college in Berlin. And -- so,\nin other words, I would have to be trained as a cantor and as a teacher, mainly as a\nteacher, of course. This was a teacher\u2019s college, which specialized, of course, in\nJewish education and public school and everything like this. So I applied for that\nand I was accepted and started in -- in spring 1936, and I was there for three years in\nBerlin.",
        "A: Now, if she -- if she felt bad about it, she didn't let me know. Besides that, my\nsister was still there too, but it was quite a move f-for me, at the age of 19 to go from\nthe small town -- small city to Berlin, which is -- was a city of four million people.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: So, what is your question?",
        "A: No, actually not. At that time I was too young for that, at 12 years. I didn\u2019t feel I\nhad any responsibility in that respect. But there were my uncles of -- there were two\nuncles of mine living in Furth, too, who of course w -- tried to help my mother\nmanage things and so on.",
        "A: It was very hard for me in the beginning because I felt very lonesome. I didn\u2019t\nknow a soul in Berlin, and -- but that\u2019s -- got slowly used to it and I did pretty well\nin school there. I had some voice teachers, too. One was one of the best known\ncantors in Berlin. The other one was an opera singer at the Berlin opera. And they\ngi -- first one, then the other one gave me singing lessons, so I improved my voice to\na certain extent.",
        "A: The cantor\u2019s name was Davidson and the -- the opera singer\u2019s name was Relane\nGoodman. He was pretty well known.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: Right, that was a Jewish college, right. A Jewish teacher\u2019s college. Half of it\nconsisted of regular teacher\u2019s cl-classes and teaching. The other half was Jewish\neducation because we had to teach religion, too. So I -- I -- a lot, a lot of Hebrew, of\ncourse, and everything connected with the Jewish religion, customs and ceremonies.\nSome Talmud s-studies we had too, just to give us a taste of It.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: It, of course, was a pleasant experience to be together with Jewish kids all the\ntime. In that respect, I liked it very much. We were very good friends to each other.\nWas aclass of about 24 bor -- boys and girls.",
        "A: No | -- everybody got very f-fast used to that, it was something that you see\neverywhere, and you di -- after awhile you didn\u2019t even notice it any more.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: The same thing, you got used to that too. After awhile it didn\u2019t bother you too\nmuch any more.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I looked Jewish, of course. But in -- in the big city of four million, you\ndi-disappeared in the crowd. And you could do in -- in certain ways it was even\nbetter in Berlin than in Furth, because you could go to the places here still. In\nFurth you couldn\u2019t even go to a swimming pool, or in -- all the -- in -- in the rest of\nGermany you couldn\u2019t go to a swimming pool, to theaters or movies or any place\nlike this. In fir -- in Berlin you could do that, because you just disappeared in the\ncrowd. You could even go to the opera and to concerts. So in that respect, life in\nBerlin was easier than in Furth.",
        "A: I spoke to them on the telephone, I guess once a week.",
        "A: That -- it seems they managed all right without me, but business got worse at that\npoint. Th-The longer Hitler was at pow -- in power, the worse economic conditions\nfor Jews became.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: There was still enough business just to barely support us, but it -- I know it was\nnot easy for her to have me in Berlin, of course. Did not help our financial situation.",
        "A: Yes, I had to pay tuition there.",
        "A: I lived in a furnished room with a Jewish family, not far from our teacher\u2019s\ncollege.",
        "A: I had no special experiences in t -- I mean, they were -- I was pr -- became pretty\nclose to the family, which made it easy for me to be alone in Berlin.",
        "A: No, you could not go. You -- you stayed away from them as far as you could. It\nnever entered our minds to a -- to attend these things. You stayed away from -- from\nthe -- these Nazi hordes as -- as much as you possibly could.",
        "A: In Firth, yes, but a -- a lot of them left Germany, emigrated over the years.\nEverybody tried to get out of Germany, of course. And this way it was not easier.\nOn one hand you wanted to get out of Germany, on the other hand you didn\u2019t know\nwhere to go to -- and especially older people found it very difficult to leave, because\nNovember 19, 2001\nall -- they had all their roots in Germany, their livelihoods, their friends, family.\nAnd for a young person, of course, it was easier to leave, unless you were -- of\ncourse, you -- you were very attached to your family.",
        "A: My mother had a cousin in -- in America, in -- in York, Pennsylvania. He was a\nfairly wealthy man and he had vouched for quite a few people already to come to\nAmerica, but when we asked him he couldn\u2019t do it any more. He must have\nvouched for maybe 20 people, and when you reach a certain point, you couldn\u2019t do\nit any more. So he had to say no to us in the beginning, but later on, for some reason\nhe could do it again, and he asked -- he asked our family if they -- who -- who\nshould -- he could vouch for one more person, who should come. And because I was\nthe only man in the family and more in danger of being persecuted by the Nazis, so\nmy family agreed to send -- to let me go.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It didn\u2019t mean much to me except I didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t like the idea that\nsomething like this could happen. We -- we thought ma -- there mi -- m-more\nNovember 19, 2001\ncountries might -- might be occupied by Germany, which actually happened later\non. We saw this the beginning of something very bad.",
        "A: That was the time when -- when most Jews realized that things would not get any\n-- an-any better any more. Before we always thought Hitler\u2019s regime might stop any\nmoment it ca -- when it came to a certain point, and it would not get worse. At that\ntime we realized we couldn\u2019t stay. That\u2019s when people -- many people really started\nlooking to get out seriously. Many, of course, had left already in 1933, but these\nwere the Jews who lived in very small towns, in villages, mostly in south Germany\nand they were worse off than the Jews who lived in b -- in the big cities, because\neverybody knew everybody and people were beaten up and sent to concentration\ncamps in these small place, much more than b -- in big cities, at that time. But after\nthis happened at the anschluss and later on Kristallnacht, we came to the\nconclusion that there was no way of staying here.",
        "A: In the middle of the night we heard a lot of noise, at maybe two, three o\u2019clock in\nthe morning, and the bra -- the breaking of glass. And then we looked out of the\nwindow, we saw that storm troopers marched all over the place and knocked in store\nwindows and went inside and then they came -- they went upstairs out -- in these\nhouses an-a-and arrested all the Jewish people. An -- and that -- that happened with\nNovember 19, 2001\neach and every Jew in the whole place, and happened all over Germany. And then\nthey -- they burned all synagogues. And I knew it -- I could see that our synagogue\nin Furth was burning at the time, too.",
        "A: I -- I was still in Firth at that time. No, that was after I came back.",
        "A: I was back in Furth already, th -- after my three years in Berlin when the kr --\nKristallnacht was November 9\", 1938, and th-th-they t -- they took us all to a large\nsquare in the middle of the city and we had to stand there for five hours, men,\nwomen, children, everybody. Then they let women and children go home. The men\nwere taken to a big hall, which had been donated by a Jew, by the way. And we\nspent all day in there. And they took men, took them up to the stage an-and beat\nthem. And we had to watch it, we were sitting underneath, 1-inside the hall and we\nhad to watch everything. And that went on all day like this. And in the evening,\nabout six, seven o\u2019clock, we all had to pass a certain table, and we were -- there th-\nth-they decided what to do with us. So the majority of the men were sent to\nconcentration camps, and to prisons. My -- my future father-in-law, for instance,\nwas sent to pri -- was taken to prison and many other men were taken to\nconcentration camps. And when I -- when I passed the table, they heard that I -- that\nI was almost ready to emigrate, my papers were almost ready. And they -- on\nNovember 19, 2001\naccount of that they let me go.

And in one place they didn\u2019t take me\nbecause I was t -- they found me too young, they wanted some -- somebody who --\nwho was a little older. And in the -- in the second case I don\u2019t know, they d-didn\u2019t\naccept me. So I went home, then I realized that it -- it was better for me not to accept\na job, and try -- rather, try to -- to speed up my emigration. And that was a good\nthing, because I know some of the others who accepted jobs as teachers never got\nout of Germany. In that respect I was lucky.",

So, and they told me I needed a certain paper, a declaration\nthat I didn\u2019t owe any money to anybody or the taxes [indecipherable]. And I wrote\nto Berlin because I had been there before, a-and they -- I didn\u2019t get an answer. So\nmy da -- emigration depended on -- on this document. And I wrote three times and\nnever got an answer, so I decided I had to go there in person. So I made a trip to\nBerlin and I had to go to the Gestapo building, which everybody dreaded at the\ntime. Nobody wanted to go there. So I went in, I -- I -- I met a -- an official there,\nand he yelled at me right away, he said, what\u2019s the matter with you, are you crazy?\nYou\u2019re writing three letters to me? Do you think we have nothing better to do than\nthat? I feel like sending you to a concentration camp. And -- and then he said a few\nmore words I forgot, and then he let me go. But I d -- I didn\u2019t know whether it was\nokayed or not. About five days later I got the paper and -- and he -- I had asked for.\nNovember 19, 2001\nIt was sent to me by mail.

        "A: No, people were mu -- very much afraid, of course. They did not know what they\nhad intended to do with us. But everybody, I guess, was too much o-occupied with\nhis own problems at that moment, with his own worries.",

Where they\nwere located and -- and factories where -- where they manufactured war materials,\nwhere they were trying to -- to build an A bomb and things like that.

By the way, I also met my -- my brother-in-law after the\nend of the war when I came -- I came back, I went back to Fiirth 1-1n the end -- the\nwar was over in -- in May, and in June or July I -- I got myself a pass from my\ncommander to go back to my hometown to see 1-1f -- by a sheer miracle maybe some\nof my relatives came back.

        "A: No, I went back a couple -- I went back a couple of more times, because my -- as\nlong as my brother-in-law was still there, I visited him and brought him food\nbecause he needed many things, clothes and food.

        "A: Yeah, I think so. I\u2019m almost sure that I -- my -- my life was shaped by -- by what\nhappened to me, and my experiences and what I saw in my life. It must have had a\nbi -- a big influence on my -- on my life.\nNovember 19, 2001",

        "A: In the beginning, yes. It did make me more fearful. When we ca -- when I came\nhere, and my wife told me the same -- that happened to many German refugees who\ncame at that time, we didn\u2019t even speak loud. We were -- were not used to speaking\nth -- in the normal way. We whispered. And th -- and this went on for quite awhile\nand it took me a long time and I\u2019m sure it must have happened to others, too.",
        "A: No, because we were always afraid in Germany to speak loud, that Nazis didn\u2019t\nhear what we were talking -- saying to each other. So we got used to s -- to speaking\nvery softly. Now one thing I would like to tell you in that respect. My daughter\ncomplained to us when she was an adult already that she -- she was influenced very\nmuch by our behavior. She -- she -- she must have felt how sad we were and she\nfeels that this influenced her life very much so. And later on we asked our son 1-1f he\nhad the same experience and he said no, because this was already six years later and\nhe was not so mu -- we were not as much influenced by our past any more six years\nlater, than she was.\nNovember 19, 2001",

        "A: Certainly not -- not too early. They must have been in their teens by that time, or\nmaybe a little earlier when we told them all that.",
        "A: They took it as a matter of fact. I mean, they -- they took it as a fact. They met\nsome other people, the -- older people who took the place of their grandparents.\nThey became grandparent figures for them, and they almost considered them as\ngrandparents.",
        "A: Yes, they were, yes.",
        "A: They were mostly -- they were mostly German refugees too, in our earlier years.\nLater on of course, this was different. Now our fre -- we have mixed friends, all\ntypes, but at that time, we lived in -- in an -- in areas where there mo -- were mostly\nrefugees, like in Washington Heights in New York.\nNovember 19, 2001",

        "A: Yes, there are. You -- you -- you see movies, for instance, of that area. Confer --\ncon -- like, you know, wh-where concentration camps were pictured, and ...there are\nall kinds of things which remind you. Sometimes books you read, magazines you\nsee. My wife seems to be more sensitive to this than I am. My wife would never go\nback to Germany, for instance. Many other refugees have been invited to go back to\ntheir hometowns by -- by the -- by the city governments of these places, and many\ndid go back, and my wife would never go back. I am not too tempted to go back\neither, but I\u2019m not as strict about this as my wife is. I feel this -- it\u2019s three\ngenerations later and I don\u2019t think you can blame the present generation for the sins\nof their grandparents. And working -- working 1n the Holocaust Museum, I see a lot\nof magazine -- magazines of present Germany and I -- and I see that they -- they\nhave changed.",

I have nothing against the young ones, but the\nolder ones I don\u2019t want to meet again.",
        "A: I had a ver -- very good friend, a Christian friend who went to school with me,\ngraduated with me and everything. He became an -- a -- a doctor and he became a\nmember of the armed -- German armed forces and he was in Russia all the time as a\ndoctor, a German army doctor. And I -- I met him when I -- when I went back to\nvisit my brother-in-law and I kept up my -- th -- my friendship with him. And he -- I\nreally believe he was never a Nazi. As a matter of fact, near the end of my -- when --\nof the time when I was in Germany, he made -- he made it a point to walk with me\nand -- through the streets in Furth, to be seen with me. So I kept on corresponding\nwith him until he died of -- a couple of years ago. There were exceptions, of course,\nnot all ba -- not all Germans were bad.

        "A: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t understand the question.",
        "A: No, it doesn\u2019t, 1t does not make me angry, but it -- it frustrates me sometimes that\nAmerican Jews don\u2019t seem to understand what we went through and went through\nthe experiences, and many of them are not even interested in it. I wouldn\u2019t say the\nmajority does that, but there are -- I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve -- ve run into a number of them who\ndon\u2019t abs -- absolutely understand what Nazism meant at that time, what it did to the\nJews. Of course they -- they -- they couldn\u2019t know. You have to experience it\nyourself, otherwise you -- they just don\u2019t know. For instance, I remember I had a\nconversation with one man I knew pretty well in this building here. He asked me one\nNovember 19, 2001\ntime, I co -- I don\u2019t understand that you German Jews didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t go to the\nnearest gun store, bought yourself a rifle or a gun and defended yourself. Having\nknown what went on, and what the circumstances were, this is sheer nonsense, was\ncompletely impossible. If I had done that, if I had shot a -- a -- a German that time,\nthey -- they wo -- they -- fi -- 10 minutes later they would have killed a thousand\nothers -- sa -- a thousand Jews. So I couldn\u2019t understand that a well educated and\ninformed man like him could even think of that. That was not understandable to me.",

        "A: That one big room where all the -- where the -- where children express their\nthoughts about the -- about the Holocaust. What -- what do you call that place?",
        "A: The tiles, right, yes. They impress me very much and I go there very often to look\nat these tiles. Some of them are excellent of these tiles. They tell you a lot. It also\nshows how children, espe -- especially children react to these events. What means\nNovember 19, 2001\nmore to them than to other people and -- and so on. I think that\u2019s an excellent idea to\nhave these on -- on -- so prominently displayed as they are.",
        "A: Yes. It certainly brings 1t back much -- much better. When I see these things I -- I\nnotice that I had forgotten many things which happened that time to me and to th --\nto the other Jewish people and which slowly diminished in my -- in my memory.\nThis brings it back again, very much.",
        "A: Yeah, I did have to sha -- like everybody else. I still have it in my old passport\nwhen I -- when I left Germany. Everybody had to do that.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: There were so many other th-things, and worse things which happened to us in\nthat time, that it didn\u2019t make any particular impression on me. I considered it more\nas a nuisance, I think, at the time when it happened. Seeing -- with all the other\nthings hap -- happening to us, that was only a small part. Comparively -- a small\nnuisance compared to many other things which happened which were much worse at\nthat time.",
        "A: Frankly, I don\u2019t remember that. I don\u2019t think we ever discussed it.",
        "A: Yes, I do. I got restitution for a number of things. For the loss -- for the loss of\nour house, our business and 1-interruption of our education. But it was -- it -- it\ndidn\u2019t amount to much money. And for many things I didn't get anything at all. For\ninstance, the value of our -- our stock in th -- in our business, you know.",
        "A: Yes, it was very difficult, very hard. It had something to do with the fact that our\n-- my lawyer was not very efficient, I think. He was -- I guess he was too old at the\ntime. For every letter I -- I wrote, I had to wait -- wait a long [indecipherable]\nsometimes I had to write three or four times to get a answer -- an answer from him.\nNovember 19, 2001",
        "A: Yes, it was a Jewish lawyer. It was in Furth. Maybe that\u2019s the reason why I took\nhim that time. And I -- then later on I changed lawyers, then it was a little better.",
        "A: I\u2019m still getting German Social Security, monthly.",
        "A: Doesn\u2019t bother me. I -- I think it\u2019s coming to me, after what happened to me.\nAfter al -- all the other things I\u2019ve lost.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. Whatever I -- I think my grandchildren should learn about it or\nfind out will be in-included in my life\u2019s story, in my memoirs. And I must have put\nthat down already in my memortrs.",
        "A: Yeah, I think so too.",
