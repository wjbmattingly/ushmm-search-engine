        "Answer: My name is George Pisik. I was born May 25\", 1925 in New York City. I\nwas going to City College, Brooklyn College actually, in New York City when I\nenlisted in the army. Took the ASTP test, was accepted into engineering school in\nthe army, but I had to perform 13 weeks of basic training and then I was sent to Cal\nTech for engineering school. After the first term was over, which was December, I\nguess of \u201944, the Battle of the Bulge occurred. We were closed down and we were\nsent to Europe as replacements. I was in this 13\" armored division, 16 infantry\nbattalion, assigned to half-tracks and tanks. And after three major campaigns, the\nwar was winding down. And May 1945 we entered the place called Dachau, right\noutside of Munich. We were never told about Dachau, we were never told about\nconcentration camps. We had no idea that we were getting into something like that.",
        "Question: Nothing in \u201cThe Stars and Stripes\u201d or no briefings of any kind?",
        "A: Nothing of any kind. We had liberated some Canadian and U.S. Army or U.S.\nAir Force prisoner of war camps previous to this and we thought this was another\nprisoner of war camp. And when the troops and the tanks and our half-tracks\nentered Dachau, we couldn\u2019t believe what we saw. I was a kid, I really was a naive\nkid and when I saw the bodies lying around, it \u2014 it really got to me. Some were just\nthrown in the corner and some were piled in blocks of five, five going one way, five\nJuly 14, 1993\ngoing another way, and \u2014 like cordwood. And they had tags attached to their toes.\nWe were there \u2014 as it was getting dark that evening, we were wandering around. We\nwere warned, do not feed the prisoners, but we were hungry ourselves and we had\nK rations and C rations, which were almost indigestible to the soldiers. And these\npeople were starving and we gave them frankfurters and beans and we almost killed\nthem. We really did, their stomach couldn\u2019t take it. Then a young lady came up to\nme, who I thought was in her 30\u2019s. It turned out she was 19, and through an\ninterpreter \u2014 she kept pointing to a mezuzah that I was wearing around my neck, a\nlittle silver cylinder given to me by my grandmother ... [tape break] \u2014 young lady\nsaid that she was 19 years old and that the German guards had ka \u2014 had kept her\nalive as she was a plaything for them. And they gave in \u2014 in return they kept her out\nof the ovens and they gave her food. She kept pointing to the mezuzah and I took it\noff and I gave it to her and I showed her and with her hairpins he pulled the shi \u2014\nmy \u2014 I didn't even know there was a paper in the mezuzah, it was a very small\ncylinder. She started to cry and said it was the first Hebrew that she had seen in\nyears and years, because they had burnt everything. I took off the mezuzah and I\ngave it to her. She started to cry and she grabbed me around the legs and she was\nhysterical and \u2014 anyway, we \u2014 that was the last I saw of her. The army \u2014",
        "Q: Was she the only woman or \u2014\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: The only woman \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 wa \u2014 were there large numbers \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the only woman I had spoken to, that I had any contact with.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And she took me by the arm and she took me for a re \u2014 very long walk, and there\nwere ovens, and there were some bodies in the ovens. And I couldn\u2019t believe it. I \u2014 I\njust \u2014 I mean, we weren\u2019t prepared for this. Then we were called, we had to mount\nup, get back on our tanks and we would continue further on.",
        "Q: How long do you think you were there [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, I was only there maybe four or five hours \u2014",
        "Q: Four or five hours.",
        "A: \u2014 in Dachau, we had to keep going. I wrote my mother that night to tell her\nmother to forgive me, but I gave away the mezuzah in a concen \u2014 in a place called\nthe concentration camp. And I forgot about it, I mean it took several weeks for the\nletter to go over and it took several more weeks for an answer to come back. She\ntold me that she had told a neighbor what had occurred and that neighbor told\nanother neighbor and before I knew it I began to receive shoeboxes full of\nmezuzahs. I must have received 50 to a hundred mezuzahs from all over New York\nCity. What do you do with a hundred mezuzahs? We were now past the\nJuly 14, 1993\nconcentration camps and we \u2014 there was nobody to give them to. So I gave them to\nthe chaplains and they said, some of them, they would distribute them. And now I\nstill had a\u2014 a whole bunch of mezuzahs left. So I went to my southern soldiers, the\npeople in my company, who were mostly from Alabama and Mississippi and\nGeorgia \u2014 not too bright, but they were very good soldiers. And I gave them the\nmezuzahs and I told them that these were good luck charms and that if they wore\nthese mezuzahs when th \u2014 but they were not to put them on til they got home,\nbecause then they would have endless erections. And they believed me.",
        "Q: They did, huh?",
        "A: All Jews are rich and all Jews are smart and I wouldn\u2019t lie to them.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And th-that\u2019s how \u2014",
        "Q: I bet those were their very prized possessions, then.",
        "A: And not only that, but I said, if you have \u2014 if you take more than one, you should\nput it on the door to the entrance to your house, it will bring you very good luck.\nAnd to \u2014 for all I know there is still in the backwoods of Mississippi and Georgia\nand Alabama, there may be some mezuzahs up on the doorways.",
        "Q: Some good old Protestant boys that have mezuzahs on the doorways.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: And I\u2019m sure they did have endless erections when they did get home, and that\u2019s\nmy story with Dachau. [tape break]",
        "Q: \u2014 had some wonderful detail about the road into Dachau and how it was towards\nthe end of the war and they were moving so fast that the food drops couldn\u2019t keep\nup with you and sta \u2014 moto \u2014 motor oil was a priority, that \u2014 that you were without\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: No \u2014- oh \u2014 wi - oh no, it \u2014 w-we were with the third army and we were moving\nso rapidly that we had no time to have food. We couldn\u2019t \u2014 we were running out of\nfood. Patton says find the food wherever you can get it in the countryside.",
        "Q: Don\u2019t armored units? I mean, they always \u2014",
        "A: Yes, armored units.",
        "Q: \u2014 prepare [indecipherable] thing \u2014",
        "A: Either get off the road, or get out \u2014 anyway, airplanes were dropping supplies.\nThe first thing that they dropped was fuel for the tanks and ammunition. Then they\ndropped medical supplies and by this time, when we were supposed to get the food,\nwe were running out of gas again, so they came back and they kept dropping diesel\nfuel or gasoline, whatever they burned. And we never did get th-the food that we\nneeded, so we had to live off the countryside, which wasn\u2019t very interesting. But we\nfound food. We did find enough to keep going, and we went through Munich and\nJuly 14, 1993\nwe passed the Munich stadium with a huge swastika up on the \u2014 on the roof. And I\nremember that the company \u2014 well, the battalion commander had the tanks fire their\ntank guns and blow it away, which was very exciting. And that afternoon, late that\nafternoon we got into Dachau.",
        "Q: Did you go through this town Dachau, or did you approach [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember that, I remember going through Munich and that took\nawhile to get through Munich. And then \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the town of Dachau at\nall, all I remember is going through the gates, the wooden gates that were busted\nopen and going into the camp itself.",
        "Q: Were there other American soldiers there before you, or were you all the\n[indecipherable] the first tanks?",
        "A: I \u2014 there must have been, coming \u2014 cause they were coming from all directions.",
        "Q: Several directions.",
        "A: And I do remember that another person \u2014 it\u2019s coming back to me, gave me a cat\nof nine tai \u2014 no, this girl that I gave the mezuzah to gave me a \u2014 an object wrapped\nin a towel, which was about eight inches long, a wooden handle, it had nine leather\nthongs, and stuck in the leather thongs were carpet tacks. And they were beaten\nwith these things and the flesh was ripped off and some of the tacks still had pieces\nof flesh on the tacks. And I had kept that for awhile, and then I just threw it away. I\nJuly 14, 1993\n\u2014 what the hell did I need it for? And that was one of the souvenirs. We had a\nGerman flag, which I think I still have, and it was a very sad time in my life, and ya\n\u2014 being 19 \u2014 19 or 20 years old at the time, it made a very strong impression on me.",
        "Q: Was there any sort of counseling offered \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 either the chaplains, was there any attempt \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 to deal with the fact that \u2014",
        "A: None whatsoever.",
        "Q: \u2014 this was a very traumatic experience?",
        "A: We just kept going until we \u2014 they stopped us, we were in a small town in\nAustria for a couple of weeks, and then they \u2014 slowly they pulled us back to \u2014 the\nlucky \u2014 what we called the cigarette camps, luck \u2014 Camp Lucky Strike, Camp Old\nGold, and from these camps, which were right near the harbor, we waited for the\nship to come to take us to go to Japan. Our division was scheduled to be the assault\ndivision on Honshu Island, the Japanese invasion. We got back to the United\nStates, I spent that \u2014 oh, a week or so on the boat in the hospital for a leg injury. I\nwas home on a recuperative leave and during the recuperative leave, they dropped\nthe atomic bong \u2014 bomb on Hiroshima. That was the end of the war, and Harry\nJuly 14, 1993\nTruman saved my life. I did not have to go to Japan, and according to the army\nofficers when we did get to California, the life expectancy of our division was 20\nminutes, and then the next wave would come in, then the following wave, and I was\nsupposed to be in the assault wave.",
        "Q: He did save your life, yeah.",
        "A: So it saved \u2014 it saved my life.",
        "Q: And quite a few others, I\u2019m sure.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Really.",
        "A: Many thousands of us. So we were always grateful for Harry Truman for that.\nHowever, after going through the museum and seeing what Roosevelt didn\u2019t do, it\nwas very upsetting to me. I never really knew that he really laid back like that. I was\nnot aware of that.",
        "Q: There was a great, great deal known in the political and military highest circles,\nand very little done.",
        "A: And when I was in Israel, my daughter and I went to Yad Vashem.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And you take Yad Vashem added with this and it\u2019s an unbelievable experience.\nAnd I wrote in the memo book downstairs that if for any reason they built\nJuly 14, 1993\nconcentration camps in the United States to put the Jews in it, there would be no\nshortage of guards and no shortage of anything, there would be many volunteers.\nAnd it\u2019s unfortunate. So I don\u2019t think we have learned a thing from history.",
        "Q: Human nature has not changed substantially, it seems.",
        "A: All you have to do is look around the world today at \u2014 almost every conflict has\nsomething to do with religion.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Whether it\u2019s Arab and Muslim or Protestant and Catholic, I mean 1-1t \u2014 it\u2019s all\nthere.",
        "Q: Do you think that you would have been \u2014 one of the things that we ask people\nabout 1s how politically cognizant they are. Do you think that you would be as\naware of the conflicts around the world now if you had not gone through this\nexperience, or if you did not have Jewish background upbringing?",
        "A: Well, I am \u2014",
        "Q: Has it sensitized you?",
        "A: Iam more sensitive to what\u2019s going on around the world.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You must remember in 1943 - 1944, there was no communications like they had\ntoday. I mean, you have CNN showing you what\u2019s happening as it happens. We had\nJuly 14, 1993\nnothing like that. We had a newspaper that came out days and weeks later and it\nwas controlled by the army.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So what they told us, or what we read was strictly what they wanted us to hear.\nAnd that\u2019s my story.",
        "Q: Okay. Couple \u2014 couple more questions. Do you remember, when you were\ninside Dachau, obviously there were other people from your team, your battalion.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember any of their reactions? Did anybody get sick?",
        "A: Yes. Many of us.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The doctor, who was the battalion doctor, his name was Dr. Rosenberg, he\nhimself became sick. And he tried, with what limited medical facilities he had, he\ntried to help these people, but there was malnutrition, there was starvation, 1t was\nsores, it was beatings, it wa \u2014 whatever. And he really wasn\u2019t prepared for this kind\nof thing. He \u2014 his stuff was for gunshot wounds and things like that, 1t wasn\u2019t for\nstarving and malnutrition. But he was trying to come around and tell us, don\u2019t give\nthem franks and beans, you\u2019ll kill them. But these people were starving, so we gave\nthem biscuits and whatever canned goods we had, we had to open it for them. And\nJuly 14, 1993\nthen \u2014 it\u2019s coming back to me, two of the, or three of the men pointed out to\nsomebody that looked like one of them, and he was younger and healthy looking, he\nwas one of the guards.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they wanted him. And we \u2014",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: \u2014 we gave him the \u2014 we searched him and he was screaming, no, no, I\u2019m \u2014 but\nthey all claimed he was one of the brutal guards, and we \u2014 they took him into one of\nthe barracks and they killed him with their bare hands. And I never went into \u2014",
        "Q: We have had \u2014 we have had other reports of that.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: We have had other reports of that, yeah.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t go in to check on it, but I heard the scream. They did it with their\nbare hands, they killed this guy. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you find or see other German guards laying around the premises that you\nthink perhaps the inmates had [indecipherable]",
        "A: Many of them had changed into \u2014 from what we had heard, they changed into\ncivilian clothes and many of them got away. But others that were pointed out were\ntaken by the MPs, and what happened to them, I don\u2019t know. Also, when we\nJuly 14, 1993\nliberated the camp there were many, many bicycles lying around. And they wanted\n\u2014 prisoners of the \u2014 they wanted to go back to Poland, Austria, wherever they\ncame from. What did we know? Here, take a bicycle, go home. And they got on\ntheir bicycles, they got as far as the gate and then they were stopped. They had to be\ninterviewed, they had to be examined, you know, so they never got more than a\ncouple of hundred yards, but we gave them all the bicycles they wanted. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you and your \u2014 the soldiers who were with you, did you discuss this in the\nfollowing days? Did you talk about it?",
        "A: First of all, many of them wore the yellow Star of David [indecipherable] Jude.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I did not see that patch downstairs. I mean, I saw patches but I did not see the\nyellow Star of David that said j-u-d \u2014 or j-u-d-e, I don\u2019t really remember at this\npoint. And they really \u2014 I told them that these were all Jewish people and that they\nwere being persecuted. And these Southerners really, they were sorry to see that,\nyou know, anybody was put \u2014 but they didn\u2019t seem to care that they were Jewish or\nnot.",
        "Q: Hm, so they did not understand the significance of the whole [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, yi\u2014 Il tell you all \u2014 I did, but they didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Yeah. Hm.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: They did not, and again you were dealing with people who were farmers. Some\nof them could not write, barely. They could barely read. I had to tie their shoelaces\nfor them, I had to make their necktie for them. But if you said to them, walk through\nthat wall, they would walk through that wall. I mean, that\u2019s what the army wanted.\nThey didn\u2019t want you to think too much.",
        "Q: So they would have been very, either historically or politically ignorant.",
        "A: Yes, we all \u2014",
        "Q: They just simply weren\u2019t exposed.",
        "A: Well, I was ignorant of what I was getting into and I was a hell of a lot brighter\nthan they were. I mean, I had \u2014 I had one year of college, and I knew I was Jewish. I\nwas Bar Mitzvahed, I knew something about my religion. But \u2014",
        "Q: Before you went overseas, I would think that you would have been at least\nclearly aware that Hitler\u2019s main focus was against the Jews. Were you aware of that\nfrom newspapers back home, or \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, we knew about the anti-Semitism, we knew about Crystal Night and\nthings like that, but we had no idea there were concentration camps. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you still have family, close family in Germany or Austria at the time of the\nwar?",
        "A: No, I had no family in Europe whatsoever, none. So I had no contact over there,\nJuly 14, 1993\nand ... [tape break] when I came home, August of 1945, I had mezuzahs waiting\nfor me in the house from my grandmother and from everybody else. It had made a\nbig impression on a large part of the Bronx. And one of the souvenir \u2014 it had\nnothing to do with the camps, one of the souvenirs that I brought home was a\nswastika flag. And on V-E Day \u2014 no, V-J Day, when I was home on leave, my\nmother made a party for whoever wanted to drop in. And next door to us were two\nrefugees who had left Germany, and when they saw \u2014 they came to the party and\nthey saw the swastika and they wiped their feet on it and they spit on it. The next\nmorning \u2014",
        "Q: It was used as a doormat for the party [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, it was a doormat. The next morning my mother didn\u2019t know what to do\nwith this filthy swastika, so she took it to the basement of an apartment house in the\nBronx, washed in the community washing machine. There was no dryer. Not\nthinking, my mother put it out on the fire escape to dry and you could see it all over\nthe Bronx, which was on Jerome Avenue and 165\" Street. Within a half hour the\npolice were up there knocking on the door, who\u2019s flying the German flag? Thank\nGod I was wearing my uniform with the medals, with the whole bit. And I said, oh\nmy God, we had this party last night, and there was still liquor on the table and\nJuly 14, 1993\ncookies out. At 10 o\u2019clock in the morning I was drinking with these two Irish cops\nfrom the Bronx, and \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s [indecipherable] everyone\u2019s attention.",
        "A: \u2014 it was \u2014 was a very excite \u2014 it was a very exciting time. And I still have the\nflag. [tape break] I had brought home as souvenirs a Luger and a Mauser pistol,\nabsolutely worthless to me, but they were in working condition and they were great\nsouvenirs. And my mother, this nice, little, old Jewish lady who was absolutely\npetrified of firearms, took the pistols to an army depot where they had advertised,\nbring your souvenirs to us and we will deactivate them so you don\u2019t get killed, or\nyou don\u2019t blow yourself up with ha \u2014 people were bringing home hand grenades.\nMy mother took these pistols and had them pour hot lead into the barrel, which\nabsolutely wiped out the pistols. And I had them for many years and I finally gave\nthem to my nephew also. And I never really forgave her for that.",
        "Q: Lead in your pistols. Oh no, no, no, don\u2019t turn off yet.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: When you came back to the States, you know, there\u2019s a \u2014 a period of reentry.\nYou know, you\u2019re getting back into the \u2014 I assume you did not stay in the \u2014 1n the\nmilitary?",
        "A: No.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "Q: So there\u2019s a kind of a reentry to civilian life.",
        "A: When I came out of the service, I spent \u2014 let\u2019s see, I came out in February and I\nthink the next week, I went back to college. And from then on it was school \u2014 back\nto Brooklyn College. I met my wife there and got married a few years later.",
        "Q: Did you in those first four or five years feel any need to discuss your experiences\nin Dachau with \u2014 say with friends, with family?",
        "A: Not so much with the family, but other friends of mine and relatives who were in\nthe army, we discussed it among ourselves over and over again. But as far as I\nknew, I was the only one of my group that was actually in a working concentration\ncamp. And \u2014",
        "Q: Were people receptive? Did you run into people who didn\u2019t want to hear about\nthis because it was too terrible?",
        "A: No, they \u2014 they had heard, of course \u2014 by that time they had all heard stories,\nthey had all seen pictures. They had asked me about it and I told them my side of\nthe story, you know, what I had seen, which seemed to coincide with what they had\nseen, and after awhile, you know, it\u2019s another war story and you forget about it.\nYou had your life to lead and these were just war stories that we had been telling\neach other over and over again over the years, and pretty soon that was history.",
        "Q: You kind of leave it, yeah.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: And then when I trying to tell my children about the Holocaust, and \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 which I did over the years. And maybe not Hugh so much, but Susan and\nSandy.",
        "Q: Was there a point in time when you became more interested in telling your\nchildren? For example in 1978 they did the Holocaust mini-series, which started a\nlot of people talking, for the first time.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t watch it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: L absolutely could not watch it. Yet, I had no problem going to the movies and\nwatching all those crazy stories, you know, where three guys wiped out 500 tanks\nyou know, with peanuts. That was okay, but the mini-series on the Holocaust, I\ncouldn\u2019t look at it.",
        "Q: It was real.",
        "A: It was re \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable] away.",
        "A: \u2014I knew it was real, I couldn\u2019t do it.",
        "Q: Yeah. Do you feel like that programs like that are important, though, to educate\npeople who don\u2019t know?\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: Yes, if people will believe it. You have people in politics today who are \u2014 who\nsay to you, hey, the Holocaust never happened. How can you \u2014 how can they\nreconcile that with the facts? And I\u2019m thinking of \u2014 what\u2019s his name, bu \u2014\nBuchanan?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: I mean here is a man who 1s an intelligent guy, he is a writer, he was an assistant\nto the president, and yet he said the Holocaust never happened. So that\u2019s frightening\nbecause if he says it there are tens of thousands of other people believe it never\nhappened.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. There is a resurgence of Holocaust deniers right now, and I think in\nparticular that\u2019s why your testimony\u2019s important. A lot of people will ignore\ntestimony from survivors, but a lot of people will listen to someone that they\nconsider trustworthy, an American and a liberator. And I think that\u2019s one reason\nthere\u2019s been such an emphasis on getting the testimonies from liberators such as\nyourself.",
        "A: In 1950 \u2014 probably 1952 or 1953, I had made a business trip that I \u2014 down south\nwhere my clients were and I went to a town, Crowley, Louisiana. And there is a\nCatholic priest there who was invited to my client\u2019s house for lunch, and I was there\nand in the course of the conversation he found out that I was Jewish, he said to me,\nJuly 14, 1993\nwell, you know, I have to tell you that the Holocaust never happened and I\u2019m telling\nmy parishioners that the Holocaust never occurred. I said, trying to be as polite as I\ncould, I said you\u2019re wrong. I was there and I saw it. He said oh no, the Catholic\nchurch would never allow something like that, and therefore it never happened. And\nthe Catholic church, as it did \u2014 collaborated with them in many instances.",
        "Q: In many ways, in many ways [indecipherable]",
        "A: And who ts it, Pope Pius? He didn\u2019t do much to save the Jews, although he\nclaims he opened up the Vatican to them. I was there and they had some little thing\nthat they had saved X amount of Jews in the Vatican, which is probably true, but he\ncould have done a lot more, which he didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Because the story was he was afraid that if he fought Hitler they would come\ninto the Vatican and just take it over, which they didn\u2019t. They left the Vatican alone.",
        "Q: Yeah, the church as a whole collaborated, I believe. Did your experiences\nchange your religious values or your religious beliefs in any way?",
        "A: I was never a religious Jew. I lived by the, you know, like by the 10\nCommandments. But I was not religious. Two of my children were Bats Mitzvahed,\none wasn\u2019t. And \u2014 well, I wasn\u2019t too upset about that. And I was happy that my\ndaughter that did get married, married a Jewish guy, and it turned out to be a\u2014a\nJuly 14, 1993\nmarital disaster. But I am now more active in federation, raising money for\nfederation. I\u2019ve been to Israel with my children, but I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s because of\nthe Holocaust.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I mean, that was over in history 48 years ago. And I go to services, you know,\nthe high holidays primarily and I\u2019m active in Jewish Federation in my community,\nand that\u2019s about the extent of it.",
        "Q: Okay. Do you, either at that time in 1945, or even today, have you come up with,\nin your mind, some sort of understanding or explanation of how Hitler and the\nNazis became so powerful, how they were so persuasive?",
        "A: I guess because there was the depression and things were very difficult. And like\ntoday, whenever things get tough, they need a scapegoat and the scapegoat\nthroughout history has always been the Jews. And they were willing to listen to\nhim, and hey here \u2014 look at these, they have stores, and they were lawyers and they\nwere bankers. Not all of them, but enough of them that were very visible, and they\nwere very easy to go after them. Tha-That\u2019s my reasoning, I don\u2019t know if history\nsupports my contention.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a large factor that\u2019s usually cited in most historical analysis.",
        "A: And it will happen again.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "Q: What can we do? What can \u2014 what can be done different? How can we re-\neducate people or how can we change people?",
        "A: Well, it has to start in school. They have to be educated and told what the\nHolocaust was. They have to be told what brought it on and what the outcome was.\nAnd I\u2019m sorry to say that in Boca Raton, Florida, which 1s a rather affluent\nsociety, I have spoken to some friends \u2014 children of friends of mine, grandchildren,\nI should say, who go to school, Jewish kids, half of them never heard of the\nHolocaust. They have no idea what the Holocaust is. And the non-Jewish kids have\nno idea what the Holocaust is. They don\u2019t teach it in school that I know of. I don\u2019t\neven think it\u2019s in the history books. If it 1s, it\u2019s just a paragraph.",
        "Q: Right. Very briefly.",
        "A: And it\u2019s nothing and it has to start at the root level, it has to start at the s \u2014 with\nthe school system and work its way up.",
        "Q: What about churches and synagogues? Do you feel like that\u2019s a appropriate\nplace to address this?",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "Q: What about churches and synagogues, was that an appropriate forum?",
        "A: I think tha \u2014 particularly the churches because the \u2014 the Jews [indecipherable]\nyou know, are sympathetic to the Jews, and the parents should tell the children what\nJuly 14, 1993\nthe Holocaust was. But you\u2019re going two generations now. My grandchildren, who\nlive in Boston, I don\u2019t see them that much, one is 10 and one is eight, I\u2019m sure they\nhave no idea what the Holocaust is. But when I see them in a couple of weeks, I\nthink I will tell them again what happened.",
        "Q: Good, good.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if my daughter has ever told them or explained it to them, but I\nthink she should.",
        "Q: Perhaps there would be some way for you to speak in the public schools in your\narea. I mean [indecipherable] \u2014",
        "A: Well, I haven\u2019t thought of it.",
        "Q: \u2014 consider that? I mean, I think that children respond to \u2014 to someone who was\nthere in a way that they don\u2019t respond to a textbook, you know, or to a lecture. And\nthat can be a very powerful teaching tool sometimes.",
        "A: I think if we could get some of the actual survivors with the tattoos on their arm,\nbut I have seen nothing in the local papers even suggesting anything like that.",
        "Q: Mm. To have survivors and liberators come and share together would be\nwonderful.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: Be a terrific experience.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: Maybe I\u2019Il bring it up when I get back.",
        "Q: I hope so. That would be \u2014",
        "A: But they have to start with the school system. Now, many blacks do not, as a\ngroup feel that this never happened. When you bring blacks through here, what is\ntheir reaction?",
        "Q: I\u2019ve only been here three days, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: \u2019'm from Atlanta and I\u2019m just up here on a research trip.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: But that would be something to ask Dr. Diorio(ph). It \u2014 1t would be interesting to\nfind out.",
        "A: But I wonder if their opinions have changed, or if they believe \u2014\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: Was it really hot there, or was it temperate?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t that warm. It was early May, and I was wearing \u2014 no, we were\nwearing cotton uniforms, so 1t \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the weather being any factor.",
        "Q: Yeah. Were there \u2014 were there a lot of people in your \u2014 how many people were\nin your unit, roughly. Were you 50, were you a hundred?\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: In the \u2014 1n the \u2014 the army, in my outfit?",
        "Q: In your \u2014 in your \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: Several thousand.",
        "Q: And all of you liberated the camps \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how many battalions came in. I know my battalion came in. Don\u2019t\nforget, a \u2014 a division had like 12,000 men, and we were shooting all over the place.\nAnd my battalion, which was probably a thousand men, wa \u2014 I know that battalion\nwas there and spread out throughout the whole area.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: These camps were big. So what I saw, other people saw in other are \u2014 in other\nareas.",
        "Q: But \u2014 so your unit had a thousand men in it? Company D [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, Company B only had 200.",
        "Q: Okay, that \u2014 that seems like a far more manageable number. And in that final\nassault, when you were moving fast and you knew that something was going on and\nmail wasn\u2019t catching up and you weren\u2019t being dropped food, and \u2014 I mean, did you\nknow that you were heading into something?\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: Oh, we \u2014 combat was pretty much over by this time because as we were\nsqueezing the Germans, we were coming from one side and the Russians were\ncoming from the other side.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they knew it was over, so what they did was, they were giving up, they were\nsurrendering by the hundreds, by the thousands. And we knew they were\nsurrendering because the Germans had a \u2014 a unique way of surrendering. They\nthrew their steel helmets away. If you saw a German soldier without his steel\nhelmet, he was surrendering.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s how you knew not to shoot him? That\u2019s how you knew not to shoot\nhim?",
        "A: Well, they wen \u2014 they threw \u2014 the first thing they did were throw their guns\naway.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Because when they came out, wherever they came out like this without their\nsteel helmet on, it wa \u2014 it was \u2014 here they were coming out by the thousands, and\nwe didn\u2019t know what to do with them.",
        "Q: And they were in bad condition themselves?",
        "A: No, not bad, though \u2014\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "Q: They \u2014 they\u2019d been eating, and [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, they weren\u2019t in bad shape. But by this time what we were running into\nwere kids maybe 15 - 16 - 17 years old and 60 and 70 year old older men. The\nyounger ones were \u2014 were gone already, pretty much. And if we found SS troopers,\nwhich we did, now they were very cute. The SS troopers tattooed the SS insignia on\ntheir shoulder, and they were very proud of it. It had like a lightning bolt with the\nSS, and our Intelligence people said, if they\u2019re young and they\u2019re healthy and they\ngot blue eyes, they got blonde hair and they look like \u2014 go look \u2014 rip their shirts off\nand look at the \u2014 and we found them, after Dachau. And we had a German\ncompany commander who asked Sergeant Goldstein and myself to take these SS\ntroopers back to the prisoner of war. He said probably eight or 10 miles in the back\nand I want you back here in 20 minutes. And he said, make sure you have your\nside-arms with you when you take them back. But 20 minutes later I want you back\nhere.",
        "Q: Did you accept?",
        "A: Yeah, they \u2014 we were back in less than 20 minutes.",
        "Q: What happened to the SS?",
        "A: They tried to escape.",
        "Q: And what did you do?\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: Oh, I -",
        "Q: Let them go?",
        "A: Oh yeah, they\u2019II never \u2014 but they didn\u2019t go anywhere. You can\u2019t do that, that\u2019s\nnot \u2014 that\u2019s against all the rules and regulations. You can\u2019t shoot prisoners of war.\nBut they never got to the prisoner of war camp and we were back in 20 minutes.",
        "Q: Do you think that your treatment of German civilians changed, or your feelings\neven toward German civilians changed?",
        "A: When we were going through some of the towns, little ole \u2014 the truth, little old\nladies would aim hunting rifles out of a window and shoot. Fortunately they were\nlousy shots. Our orders were, do not go in after them. We had something called\nthermite grenades. Thermite grenades would burn through six steel helmets in 30\nseconds. So we would take a thermite grenade and throw it into the window and\njust keep going. And within minutes that building was completely engulfed in\nflames. We never \u2014 he said, don\u2019t get yourself involved, you\u2019ll only \u2014 you can get\nhurt. Just burn the building down, let them take care of themselves. Yeah, thermite\ngrenades, I haven\u2019t said that word in a long time. Any other question?",
        "Q: Were you and Goldstein the only Jews in your battalion, your division?",
        "A: There weren't many more. There were about \u2014 in my company there were\nprobably three Jews. Epstein \u2014\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "Q: [indecipherable] in the infantry.",
        "A: Epstein, Goldberg and Pisik. How I ended up in the infantry, Pll never know.",
        "Q: Right, you know, Grandma raised a smarter guy, because the ASTP program\nwas cancelled.",
        "A: Yeah, well I know, that\u2019s how I ended up, I figure even then the \u2014 you know,\nguys li\u2014I figured I\u2019d be in quartermaster, or whatever.",
        "Q: Oh yeah, it just seems \u2014",
        "A: Intelligence.",
        "Q: \u2014 they dumped everybody, it seems like, in the front lines.",
        "A: I was in \u2014I \u2014 right out to the front lines, riding in the back of a tank.",
        "Q: How long had you been serving? How long had you been overseas when you got\nto the camp? It \u2014 it had been years, hadn\u2019t it?",
        "A: I was overseas February and March \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable] would say?",
        "A: I was overseas about a year and a half.",
        "Q: I remember you telling me when the \u2014 the Persian Gulf parades were going on,\nand you said, oh, these guys sat in a desert for five months, look what we did, you\nknow? So you \u2014 that was all active duty, too, it wasn\u2019t just \u2014\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: Well, when we came back on this ship, we were told that our division was going\nto land in New York City and there\u2019s going to be parade up Fifth Avenue. Oh, I \u2014I\nmean, from a kid from New York City, we knew what a ticker tape parade was.\nAnd two days out they said, oh, the orders have changed, we\u2019re going to Newport\nNews, Virginia, no parade. Very upsetting. But there were German prisoners of war\nwho were working the commissary at the army camp, Camp Patrick Henry in\nNewport News, Virginia. And we were told, said look fellas, be \u2014 they been here\nfor awhile and they\u2019re the cooks and they\u2019re the clean up and they\u2019re whatever, they\ndo all the dirty work. So if you start anything with them, you\u2019re going to go into the\nkitchen and do the dirty work. And we found that the German prisoners of war were\ndoing the grass cutting, sitting on tractors with umbrellas over their head. Or they\nwere working in the laundries with the American women, and we were out there\nbusting our backsides out in the hot sun. And th \u2014 I\u2019m just trying to correlate how\nthey were treated over here and how the prisoners were treated over there. So you \u2014\nas you know, I have no \u2014 no love for the Germans, or the German people. You\nknow when I told you about Uncle Ben\u2019s Mercedes? He got a new Mercedes years\nago and I said, Ben, what 1s that little door over there, you know\u201d? He said, well\nthat\u2019s the glove compartment. I said, no it isn\u2019t, that\u2019s a microwave oven for Jewish\nbabies. He got very upset.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t you say when you were touring the camps, or when you were first going\nthrough there, what \u2014 didn\u2019t \u2014 didn't you see, what was it, the Mercedes emblem or\nother \u2014 other s \u2014",
        "A: I believe and I \u2014 people told me I\u2019m wrong, but I believe that on one of the ovens\nI saw the Mercedes-Benz emblem on the oven door. Other \u2014 have you heard that?",
        "Q: I haven\u2019t heard that, but there were a number of major businesses and industries\nthat were in that immediate area and they contracted for the slave labor force. So,\nit\u2019s certainly possible. I had not heard that before.",
        "A: Well, people tell me that I \u2014 I didn\u2019t see it, because they didn\u2019t see it, but don\u2019t\nforget, in 1945, I wasn\u2019t even sure what the \u2014 the emblem was, but I \u2014 I thought I\nsaw the Mercedes emblem on the \u2014 on the oven doors. Th-They could have been,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Were the \u2014 there were no guards, just the trustees? I mean, there were no \u2014",
        "A: No, many of the guards had left, but we did get a bunch of them. And this one\ngroup that asked for a guard, a particular guard, we gave it to them. We \u2014 we s \u2014\nmade sure he had no weapons and we threw him into the barracks with the men.\nAnd they \u2014 they tore him limb from limb. And they hardly had the strength.",
        "Q: Were there other souvenirs, so to speak, or any kind of looting going on in the\ncamps?\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: Well, I told you, I had that cat o\u2019nine tails, which I carried around with me for\nseveral weeks and then one day I looked at it and said what am I gonna do with a\nwhip with the leather thongs with thumbtacks in it, and I just threw it away.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But, if I hadn\u2019t seen it, in my mind I still see it, with the thumbtacks with a little\nbit of flesh on it, on one of the tacks. And the handle was only about that big, and\nstrips of leather about that big and they would just whip the prisoners with it. And I\nhad the flag and I had the, you know, the bayonet I brought home, I don\u2019t know\nwhat happened to that. Remember the bayonet?",
        "Q: Mom managed to lose it in the move, I bet.",
        "A: Yeah, probably. Any other questions?",
        "Q: You said you had a leg injury?",
        "A: I had no time to bathe or change my shoes or whatever, and by the time the war\nwas over, I had developed a very, very bad case of impetigo and oh I forgot the\nword that they use for the feet with the \u2014",
        "Q: Trenchfeet?",
        "A: Trenchfoot.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, trenchfoot.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: And when we went back to the United States, I was on sick call and they put me\nin the hospital, the \u2014 and they put hot compresses on my feet for a week and they\npainted my feet with potassium permanganate. Violet gentian? Something like that.\nAnd it cured it. And even though I really wasn\u2019t cured, they told me that I could go\nhome on leave, 30 day leave. But I could barely walk when I got on that ship. It was\nfour weeks before I \u2014 I hadn\u2019t taken my shoes off. Didn\u2019t have time.",
        "Q: So you were moving that fast or that long?",
        "A: Yeah, I was scratching with the rifle butt, I was scratching my toes through the\nleather shoe, trying to get some relief.",
        "Q: I would assume, too, you mentioned earlier that supplies were having a real hard\nta \u2014 time keeping up with you because you were moving so fast, so that you were\nnot necessarily getting fresh socks \u2014",
        "A: Ti\u2014 we weren\u2019t getting nothing.",
        "Q: \u2014 when you were supposed to, at all.",
        "A: We were getting nothing, we were living \u2014 when we came to a farmyard, my\nSoutherners were wonderful. They\u2019d run out and grab a chicken and they\u2019d wring\nits neck, you know, and the whole thing. And then they said to me, Sarge, it\u2019s your\nterm \u2014 your turn to kill a chicken. So I took a machine gun out of the half-track, a\n45 caliber machine gun and I couldn\u2019t hit the chicken \u2014 thank God I didn\u2019t hit the\nJuly 14, 1993\nchicken with it. They were laughing so hard they \u2014 th-they fell down crying they\nwere laughing so hard. So they killed the chicken and I did all the rest of the dirty\nwork for them. I wrote their letters for them and I \u2014 I had to mother them, they\ncouldn\u2019t do it themselves. But they were great soldiers.",
        "Q: And the army made no effort to explain or debrief that you had \u2014 what you had\nseen?",
        "A: No, nobody cared. There were millions of us.",
        "Q: Had you seen things up to that point that were incrementally as awful, and that\nthis was just another \u2014",
        "A: Well, d-don\u2019t forget, there is artillery shells, there was bombing. We saw many\ndead bodies \u2014",
        "Q: So it\u2019s like [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014 but most of the dead bodies we saw were \u2014 were Germans, or civilians.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It really didn\u2019t bother me too much. Hey, they were the enemy. That\u2019s the idea,\nwe were there to kill them. But th-the helpless families, with the children, with \u2014 I\nreally didn't see \u2014 come to think of it, I don\u2019t think I saw children in Dachau. I\nmean, I saw adults. Now, the children I know were there, I didn\u2019t see any. At that\nstage of time they may have been all killed already.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "Q: That\u2019s what it most people mention, is that either they saw very, very few\nchildren or none at all.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember seeing any.",
        "Q: Cause by that time they had already been disposed of, yeah. So it was clear to\nyou coming in, having seen other battle dead, that this was something different.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: This was not like a regular war zone, this was something \u2014",
        "A: A war zone didn\u2019t bother me.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This bothered me, cause we realized what it was, we \u2014 we could see what it was,\nthese people told us what it was. And it was such a complete shock. Nothing in my\nbackground ever could prepare me. It couldn\u2019t prepare anybody for something like\nthis.",
        "Q: Could you speak Yiddish at the time?",
        "A: Yeah, I probably spoke a little Yiddish, and \u2014",
        "Q: So did the prisoners try to talk to you?",
        "A: \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t enough, it really wasn\u2019t enough to communicate with this woman\nwho spoke German.

After the bomb was dropped, I still had to report to Camp Roberts \u2014\nnot Camp Rob, one of the camps in California.

We weren't\nallowed to fraternize with them. All the hanky panky with the women and all that,\nthat came later, I guess, after we left. But we were in a town with a big sawmill and\nwe had told the Germans to start cutting two by fours, they needed it for something.\nAnd the guy deliberately, the foreman burnt out the motor by jamming the throttle\nforward instead of doing it gradually. And one of the boys who n \u2014 from the\nsouthern boys said, he\u2019s doing that deliberately, because he knows he\u2019s burning out\nthe motor.

Took the ASTP test, was accepted into engineering school in\nthe army, but I had to perform 13 weeks of basic training and then I was sent to Cal\nTech for engineering school. After the first term was over, which was December, I\nguess of \u201944, the Battle of the Bulge occurred. We were closed down and we were\nsent to Europe as replacements. I was in this 13\" armored division, 16 infantry\nbattalion, assigned to half-tracks and tanks. And after three major campaigns, the\nwar was winding down. And May 1945 we entered the place called Dachau, right\noutside of Munich. We were never told about Dachau, we were never told about\nconcentration camps. We had no idea that we were getting into something like that.",

I was a kid, I really was a naive\nkid and when I saw the bodies lying around, it \u2014 it really got to me. Some were just\nthrown in the corner and some were piled in blocks of five, five going one way, five\nJuly 14, 1993\ngoing another way, and \u2014 like cordwood. And they had tags attached to their toes.\nWe were there \u2014 as it was getting dark that evening, we were wandering around. We\nwere warned, do not feed the prisoners, but we were hungry ourselves and we had\nK rations and C rations, which were almost indigestible to the soldiers. And these\npeople were starving and we gave them frankfurters and beans and we almost killed\nthem. We really did, their stomach couldn\u2019t take it. Then a young lady came up to\nme, who I thought was in her 30\u2019s. It turned out she was 19, and through an\ninterpreter \u2014 she kept pointing to a mezuzah that I was wearing around my neck, a\nlittle silver cylinder given to me by my grandmother ...

She started to cry and said it was the first Hebrew that she had seen in\nyears and years, because they had burnt everything. I took off the mezuzah and I\ngave it to her.

And I forgot about it, I mean it took several weeks for the\nletter to go over and it took several more weeks for an answer to come back. She\ntold me that she had told a neighbor what had occurred and that neighbor told\nanother neighbor and before I knew it I began to receive shoeboxes full of\nmezuzahs. I must have received 50 to a hundred mezuzahs from all over New York\nCity. What do you do with a hundred mezuzahs?

And now I\nstill had a\u2014 a whole bunch of mezuzahs left. So I went to my southern soldiers, the\npeople in my company, who were mostly from Alabama and Mississippi and\nGeorgia \u2014 not too bright, but they were very good soldiers. And I gave them the\nmezuzahs and I told them that these were good luck charms and that if they wore\nthese mezuzahs when th \u2014 but they were not to put them on til they got home,\nbecause then they would have endless erections.

        "A: And I do remember that another person \u2014 it\u2019s coming back to me, gave me a cat\nof nine tai \u2014 no, this girl that I gave the mezuzah to gave me a \u2014 an object wrapped\nin a towel, which was about eight inches long, a wooden handle, it had nine leather\nthongs, and stuck in the leather thongs were carpet tacks. And they were beaten\nwith these things and the flesh was ripped off and some of the tacks still had pieces\nof flesh on the tacks. And I had kept that for awhile, and then I just threw it away. I\nJuly 14, 1993\n\u2014 what the hell did I need it for? And that was one of the souvenirs. We had a\nGerman flag, which I think I still have, and it was a very sad time in my life, and ya\n\u2014 being 19 \u2014 19 or 20 years old at the time, it made a very strong impression on me.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: None whatsoever.",
        "A: We just kept going until we \u2014 they stopped us, we were in a small town in\nAustria for a couple of weeks, and then they \u2014 slowly they pulled us back to \u2014 the\nlucky \u2014 what we called the cigarette camps, luck \u2014 Camp Lucky Strike, Camp Old\nGold, and from these camps, which were right near the harbor, we waited for the\nship to come to take us to go to Japan. Our division was scheduled to be the assault\ndivision on Honshu Island, the Japanese invasion. We got back to the United\nStates, I spent that \u2014 oh, a week or so on the boat in the hospital for a leg injury. I\nwas home on a recuperative leave and during the recuperative leave, they dropped\nthe atomic bong \u2014 bomb on Hiroshima. That was the end of the war, and Harry\nJuly 14, 1993\nTruman saved my life. I did not have to go to Japan, and according to the army\nofficers when we did get to California, the life expectancy of our division was 20\nminutes, and then the next wave would come in, then the following wave, and I was\nsupposed to be in the assault wave.",
        "A: So it saved \u2014 it saved my life.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Many thousands of us. So we were always grateful for Harry Truman for that.\nHowever, after going through the museum and seeing what Roosevelt didn\u2019t do, it\nwas very upsetting to me. I never really knew that he really laid back like that. I was\nnot aware of that.",
        "A: And when I was in Israel, my daughter and I went to Yad Vashem.",
        "A: And you take Yad Vashem added with this and it\u2019s an unbelievable experience.\nAnd I wrote in the memo book downstairs that if for any reason they built\nJuly 14, 1993\nconcentration camps in the United States to put the Jews in it, there would be no\nshortage of guards and no shortage of anything, there would be many volunteers.\nAnd it\u2019s unfortunate. So I don\u2019t think we have learned a thing from history.",
        "A: All you have to do is look around the world today at \u2014 almost every conflict has\nsomething to do with religion.",
        "A: Whether it\u2019s Arab and Muslim or Protestant and Catholic, I mean 1-1t \u2014 it\u2019s all\nthere.",
        "A: Well, I am \u2014",
        "A: Iam more sensitive to what\u2019s going on around the world.",
        "A: You must remember in 1943 - 1944, there was no communications like they had\ntoday. I mean, you have CNN showing you what\u2019s happening as it happens. We had\nJuly 14, 1993\nnothing like that. We had a newspaper that came out days and weeks later and it\nwas controlled by the army.",
        "A: So what they told us, or what we read was strictly what they wanted us to hear.\nAnd that\u2019s my story.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Many of us.",
        "A: The doctor, who was the battalion doctor, his name was Dr. Rosenberg, he\nhimself became sick. And he tried, with what limited medical facilities he had, he\ntried to help these people, but there was malnutrition, there was starvation, 1t was\nsores, it was beatings, it wa \u2014 whatever. And he really wasn\u2019t prepared for this kind\nof thing. He \u2014 his stuff was for gunshot wounds and things like that, 1t wasn\u2019t for\nstarving and malnutrition. But he was trying to come around and tell us, don\u2019t give\nthem franks and beans, you\u2019ll kill them. But these people were starving, so we gave\nthem biscuits and whatever canned goods we had, we had to open it for them. And\nJuly 14, 1993\nthen \u2014 it\u2019s coming back to me, two of the, or three of the men pointed out to\nsomebody that looked like one of them, and he was younger and healthy looking, he\nwas one of the guards.",
        "A: And they wanted him. And we \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we gave him the \u2014 we searched him and he was screaming, no, no, I\u2019m \u2014 but\nthey all claimed he was one of the brutal guards, and we \u2014 they took him into one of\nthe barracks and they killed him with their bare hands. And I never went into \u2014",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t go in to check on it, but I heard the scream. They did it with their\nbare hands, they killed this guy. And \u2014",
        "A: Many of them had changed into \u2014 from what we had heard, they changed into\ncivilian clothes and many of them got away. But others that were pointed out were\ntaken by the MPs, and what happened to them, I don\u2019t know. Also, when we\nJuly 14, 1993\nliberated the camp there were many, many bicycles lying around. And they wanted\n\u2014 prisoners of the \u2014 they wanted to go back to Poland, Austria, wherever they\ncame from. What did we know? Here, take a bicycle, go home. And they got on\ntheir bicycles, they got as far as the gate and then they were stopped. They had to be\ninterviewed, they had to be examined, you know, so they never got more than a\ncouple of hundred yards, but we gave them all the bicycles they wanted. And \u2014",
        "A: First of all, many of them wore the yellow Star of David [indecipherable] Jude.",
        "A: I did not see that patch downstairs. I mean, I saw patches but I did not see the\nyellow Star of David that said j-u-d \u2014 or j-u-d-e, I don\u2019t really remember at this\npoint. And they really \u2014 I told them that these were all Jewish people and that they\nwere being persecuted. And these Southerners really, they were sorry to see that,\nyou know, anybody was put \u2014 but they didn\u2019t seem to care that they were Jewish or\nnot.",
        "A: No, yi\u2014 Il tell you all \u2014 I did, but they didn\u2019t.",
        "A: They did not, and again you were dealing with people who were farmers. Some\nof them could not write, barely. They could barely read. I had to tie their shoelaces\nfor them, I had to make their necktie for them. But if you said to them, walk through\nthat wall, they would walk through that wall. I mean, that\u2019s what the army wanted.\nThey didn\u2019t want you to think too much.",
        "A: Yes, we all \u2014",
        "A: Well, I was ignorant of what I was getting into and I was a hell of a lot brighter\nthan they were. I mean, I had \u2014 I had one year of college, and I knew I was Jewish. I\nwas Bar Mitzvahed, I knew something about my religion. But \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, we knew about the anti-Semitism, we knew about Crystal Night and\nthings like that, but we had no idea there were concentration camps. And \u2014",
        "A: No, I had no family in Europe whatsoever, none. So I had no contact over there,\nJuly 14, 1993\nand ... [tape break] when I came home, August of 1945, I had mezuzahs waiting\nfor me in the house from my grandmother and from everybody else. It had made a\nbig impression on a large part of the Bronx. And one of the souvenir \u2014 it had\nnothing to do with the camps, one of the souvenirs that I brought home was a\nswastika flag. And on V-E Day \u2014 no, V-J Day, when I was home on leave, my\nmother made a party for whoever wanted to drop in. And next door to us were two\nrefugees who had left Germany, and when they saw \u2014 they came to the party and\nthey saw the swastika and they wiped their feet on it and they spit on it. The next\nmorning \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, it was a doormat. The next morning my mother didn\u2019t know what to do\nwith this filthy swastika, so she took it to the basement of an apartment house in the\nBronx, washed in the community washing machine. There was no dryer. Not\nthinking, my mother put it out on the fire escape to dry and you could see it all over\nthe Bronx, which was on Jerome Avenue and 165\" Street. Within a half hour the\npolice were up there knocking on the door, who\u2019s flying the German flag? Thank\nGod I was wearing my uniform with the medals, with the whole bit. And I said, oh\nmy God, we had this party last night, and there was still liquor on the table and\nJuly 14, 1993\ncookies out. At 10 o\u2019clock in the morning I was drinking with these two Irish cops\nfrom the Bronx, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was \u2014 was a very excite \u2014 it was a very exciting time. And I still have the\nflag. [tape break] I had brought home as souvenirs a Luger and a Mauser pistol,\nabsolutely worthless to me, but they were in working condition and they were great\nsouvenirs. And my mother, this nice, little, old Jewish lady who was absolutely\npetrified of firearms, took the pistols to an army depot where they had advertised,\nbring your souvenirs to us and we will deactivate them so you don\u2019t get killed, or\nyou don\u2019t blow yourself up with ha \u2014 people were bringing home hand grenades.\nMy mother took these pistols and had them pour hot lead into the barrel, which\nabsolutely wiped out the pistols. And I had them for many years and I finally gave\nthem to my nephew also. And I never really forgave her for that.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: No.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: When I came out of the service, I spent \u2014 let\u2019s see, I came out in February and I\nthink the next week, I went back to college. And from then on it was school \u2014 back\nto Brooklyn College. I met my wife there and got married a few years later.",
        "A: Not so much with the family, but other friends of mine and relatives who were in\nthe army, we discussed it among ourselves over and over again. But as far as I\nknew, I was the only one of my group that was actually in a working concentration\ncamp. And \u2014",
        "A: No, they \u2014 they had heard, of course \u2014 by that time they had all heard stories,\nthey had all seen pictures. They had asked me about it and I told them my side of\nthe story, you know, what I had seen, which seemed to coincide with what they had\nseen, and after awhile, you know, it\u2019s another war story and you forget about it.\nYou had your life to lead and these were just war stories that we had been telling\neach other over and over again over the years, and pretty soon that was history.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: And then when I trying to tell my children about the Holocaust, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 which I did over the years. And maybe not Hugh so much, but Susan and\nSandy.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t watch it.",
        "A: L absolutely could not watch it. Yet, I had no problem going to the movies and\nwatching all those crazy stories, you know, where three guys wiped out 500 tanks\nyou know, with peanuts. That was okay, but the mini-series on the Holocaust, I\ncouldn\u2019t look at it.",
        "A: It was re \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I knew it was real, I couldn\u2019t do it.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: Yes, if people will believe it. You have people in politics today who are \u2014 who\nsay to you, hey, the Holocaust never happened. How can you \u2014 how can they\nreconcile that with the facts? And I\u2019m thinking of \u2014 what\u2019s his name, bu \u2014\nBuchanan?",
        "A: I mean here is a man who 1s an intelligent guy, he is a writer, he was an assistant\nto the president, and yet he said the Holocaust never happened. So that\u2019s frightening\nbecause if he says it there are tens of thousands of other people believe it never\nhappened.",
        "A: In 1950 \u2014 probably 1952 or 1953, I had made a business trip that I \u2014 down south\nwhere my clients were and I went to a town, Crowley, Louisiana. And there is a\nCatholic priest there who was invited to my client\u2019s house for lunch, and I was there\nand in the course of the conversation he found out that I was Jewish, he said to me,\nJuly 14, 1993\nwell, you know, I have to tell you that the Holocaust never happened and I\u2019m telling\nmy parishioners that the Holocaust never occurred. I said, trying to be as polite as I\ncould, I said you\u2019re wrong. I was there and I saw it. He said oh no, the Catholic\nchurch would never allow something like that, and therefore it never happened. And\nthe Catholic church, as it did \u2014 collaborated with them in many instances.",
        "A: And who ts it, Pope Pius? He didn\u2019t do much to save the Jews, although he\nclaims he opened up the Vatican to them. I was there and they had some little thing\nthat they had saved X amount of Jews in the Vatican, which is probably true, but he\ncould have done a lot more, which he didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Because the story was he was afraid that if he fought Hitler they would come\ninto the Vatican and just take it over, which they didn\u2019t. They left the Vatican alone.",
        "A: I was never a religious Jew. I lived by the, you know, like by the 10\nCommandments. But I was not religious. Two of my children were Bats Mitzvahed,\none wasn\u2019t. And \u2014 well, I wasn\u2019t too upset about that. And I was happy that my\ndaughter that did get married, married a Jewish guy, and it turned out to be a\u2014a\nJuly 14, 1993\nmarital disaster. But I am now more active in federation, raising money for\nfederation. I\u2019ve been to Israel with my children, but I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s because of\nthe Holocaust.",
        "A: I mean, that was over in history 48 years ago. And I go to services, you know,\nthe high holidays primarily and I\u2019m active in Jewish Federation in my community,\nand that\u2019s about the extent of it.",
        "A: I guess because there was the depression and things were very difficult. And like\ntoday, whenever things get tough, they need a scapegoat and the scapegoat\nthroughout history has always been the Jews. And they were willing to listen to\nhim, and hey here \u2014 look at these, they have stores, and they were lawyers and they\nwere bankers. Not all of them, but enough of them that were very visible, and they\nwere very easy to go after them. Tha-That\u2019s my reasoning, I don\u2019t know if history\nsupports my contention.",
        "A: And it will happen again.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: Well, it has to start in school. They have to be educated and told what the\nHolocaust was. They have to be told what brought it on and what the outcome was.\nAnd I\u2019m sorry to say that in Boca Raton, Florida, which 1s a rather affluent\nsociety, I have spoken to some friends \u2014 children of friends of mine, grandchildren,\nI should say, who go to school, Jewish kids, half of them never heard of the\nHolocaust. They have no idea what the Holocaust is. And the non-Jewish kids have\nno idea what the Holocaust is. They don\u2019t teach it in school that I know of. I don\u2019t\neven think it\u2019s in the history books. If it 1s, it\u2019s just a paragraph.",
        "A: And it\u2019s nothing and it has to start at the root level, it has to start at the s \u2014 with\nthe school system and work its way up.",
        "A: Excuse me?",
        "A: I think tha \u2014 particularly the churches because the \u2014 the Jews [indecipherable]\nyou know, are sympathetic to the Jews, and the parents should tell the children what\nJuly 14, 1993\nthe Holocaust was. But you\u2019re going two generations now. My grandchildren, who\nlive in Boston, I don\u2019t see them that much, one is 10 and one is eight, I\u2019m sure they\nhave no idea what the Holocaust is. But when I see them in a couple of weeks, I\nthink I will tell them again what happened.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if my daughter has ever told them or explained it to them, but I\nthink she should.",
        "A: Well, I haven\u2019t thought of it.",
        "A: I think if we could get some of the actual survivors with the tattoos on their arm,\nbut I have seen nothing in the local papers even suggesting anything like that.",
        "A: Well \u2014\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: Maybe I\u2019Il bring it up when I get back.",
        "A: But they have to start with the school system. Now, many blacks do not, as a\ngroup feel that this never happened. When you bring blacks through here, what is\ntheir reaction?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: But I wonder if their opinions have changed, or if they believe \u2014\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t that warm. It was early May, and I was wearing \u2014 no, we were\nwearing cotton uniforms, so 1t \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the weather being any factor.\nJuly 14, 1993",

Don\u2019t\nforget, a \u2014 a division had like 12,000 men, and we were shooting all over the place.\nAnd my battalion, which was probably a thousand men, wa \u2014 I know that battalion\nwas there and spread out throughout the whole area.",
        "A: These camps were big. So what I saw, other people saw in other are \u2014 in other\nareas.",
        "A: Well, Company B only had 200.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: Oh, we \u2014 combat was pretty much over by this time because as we were\nsqueezing the Germans, we were coming from one side and the Russians were\ncoming from the other side.",
        "A: And they knew it was over, so what they did was, they were giving up, they were\nsurrendering by the hundreds, by the thousands. And we knew they were\nsurrendering because the Germans had a \u2014 a unique way of surrendering. They\nthrew their steel helmets away. If you saw a German soldier without his steel\nhelmet, he was surrendering.",
        "A: Well, they wen \u2014 they threw \u2014 the first thing they did were throw their guns\naway.",
        "A: Because when they came out, wherever they came out like this without their\nsteel helmet on, it wa \u2014 it was \u2014 here they were coming out by the thousands, and\nwe didn\u2019t know what to do with them.",
        "A: No, not bad, though \u2014\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: Yeah, they weren\u2019t in bad shape. But by this time what we were running into\nwere kids maybe 15 - 16 - 17 years old and 60 and 70 year old older men. The\nyounger ones were \u2014 were gone already, pretty much. And if we found SS troopers,\nwhich we did, now they were very cute. The SS troopers tattooed the SS insignia on\ntheir shoulder, and they were very proud of it. It had like a lightning bolt with the\nSS, and our Intelligence people said, if they\u2019re young and they\u2019re healthy and they\ngot blue eyes, they got blonde hair and they look like \u2014 go look \u2014 rip their shirts off\nand look at the \u2014 and we found them, after Dachau. And we had a German\ncompany commander who asked Sergeant Goldstein and myself to take these SS\ntroopers back to the prisoner of war. He said probably eight or 10 miles in the back\nand I want you back here in 20 minutes. And he said, make sure you have your\nside-arms with you when you take them back. But 20 minutes later I want you back\nhere.",
        "A: Yeah, they \u2014 we were back in less than 20 minutes.",
        "A: They tried to escape.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: Oh, I -",
        "A: Oh yeah, they\u2019II never \u2014 but they didn\u2019t go anywhere. You can\u2019t do that, that\u2019s\nnot \u2014 that\u2019s against all the rules and regulations. You can\u2019t shoot prisoners of war.\nBut they never got to the prisoner of war camp and we were back in 20 minutes.",
        "A: When we were going through some of the towns, little ole \u2014 the truth, little old\nladies would aim hunting rifles out of a window and shoot. Fortunately they were\nlousy shots. Our orders were, do not go in after them. We had something called\nthermite grenades. Thermite grenades would burn through six steel helmets in 30\nseconds. So we would take a thermite grenade and throw it into the window and\njust keep going. And within minutes that building was completely engulfed in\nflames. We never \u2014 he said, don\u2019t get yourself involved, you\u2019ll only \u2014 you can get\nhurt. Just burn the building down, let them take care of themselves. Yeah, thermite\ngrenades, I haven\u2019t said that word in a long time. Any other question?",
        "A: There weren't many more. There were about \u2014 in my company there were\nprobably three Jews. Epstein \u2014\nJuly 14, 1993",

Oh, I \u2014I\nmean, from a kid from New York City, we knew what a ticker tape parade was.\nAnd two days out they said, oh, the orders have changed, we\u2019re going to Newport\nNews, Virginia, no parade. Very upsetting. But there were German prisoners of war\nwho were working the commissary at the army camp, Camp Patrick Henry in\nNewport News, Virginia. And we were told, said look fellas, be \u2014 they been here\nfor awhile and they\u2019re the cooks and they\u2019re the clean up and they\u2019re whatever, they\ndo all the dirty work. So if you start anything with them, you\u2019re going to go into the\nkitchen and do the dirty work. And we found that the German prisoners of war were\ndoing the grass cutting, sitting on tractors with umbrellas over their head. Or they\nwere working in the laundries with the American women, and we were out there\nbusting our backsides out in the hot sun. And th \u2014 I\u2019m just trying to correlate how\nthey were treated over here and how the prisoners were treated over there. So you \u2014\nas you know, I have no \u2014 no love for the Germans, or the German people. You\nknow when I told you about Uncle Ben\u2019s Mercedes? He got a new Mercedes years\nago and I said, Ben, what 1s that little door over there, you know\u201d? He said, well\nthat\u2019s the glove compartment. I said, no it isn\u2019t, that\u2019s a microwave oven for Jewish\nbabies. He got very upset.\nJuly 14, 1993",

        "A: Well, people tell me that I \u2014 I didn\u2019t see it, because they didn\u2019t see it, but don\u2019t\nforget, in 1945, I wasn\u2019t even sure what the \u2014 the emblem was, but I \u2014 I thought I\nsaw the Mercedes emblem on the \u2014 on the oven doors. Th-They could have been,\nyou know.",
        "A: No, many of the guards had left, but we did get a bunch of them. And this one\ngroup that asked for a guard, a particular guard, we gave it to them. We \u2014 we s \u2014\nmade sure he had no weapons and we threw him into the barracks with the men.\nAnd they \u2014 they tore him limb from limb. And they hardly had the strength.",
        "A: Well, I told you, I had that cat o\u2019nine tails, which I carried around with me for\nseveral weeks and then one day I looked at it and said what am I gonna do with a\nwhip with the leather thongs with thumbtacks in it, and I just threw it away.",
        "A: But, if I hadn\u2019t seen it, in my mind I still see it, with the thumbtacks with a little\nbit of flesh on it, on one of the tacks. And the handle was only about that big, and\nstrips of leather about that big and they would just whip the prisoners with it. And I\nhad the flag and I had the, you know, the bayonet I brought home, I don\u2019t know\nwhat happened to that. Remember the bayonet?",
        "A: Yeah, probably. Any other questions?",
        "A: I had no time to bathe or change my shoes or whatever, and by the time the war\nwas over, I had developed a very, very bad case of impetigo and oh I forgot the\nword that they use for the feet with the \u2014",
        "A: Trenchfoot.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: And when we went back to the United States, I was on sick call and they put me\nin the hospital, the \u2014 and they put hot compresses on my feet for a week and they\npainted my feet with potassium permanganate. Violet gentian? Something like that.\nAnd it cured it. And even though I really wasn\u2019t cured, they told me that I could go\nhome on leave, 30 day leave. But I could barely walk when I got on that ship. It was\nfour weeks before I \u2014 I hadn\u2019t taken my shoes off. Didn\u2019t have time.",
        "A: Yeah, I was scratching with the rifle butt, I was scratching my toes through the\nleather shoe, trying to get some relief.",
        "A: Ti\u2014 we weren\u2019t getting nothing.",
        "A: We were getting nothing, we were living \u2014 when we came to a farmyard, my\nSoutherners were wonderful. They\u2019d run out and grab a chicken and they\u2019d wring\nits neck, you know, and the whole thing. And then they said to me, Sarge, it\u2019s your\nterm \u2014 your turn to kill a chicken. So I took a machine gun out of the half-track, a\n45 caliber machine gun and I couldn\u2019t hit the chicken \u2014 thank God I didn\u2019t hit the\nJuly 14, 1993\nchicken with it. They were laughing so hard they \u2014 th-they fell down crying they\nwere laughing so hard. So they killed the chicken and I did all the rest of the dirty\nwork for them. I wrote their letters for them and I \u2014 I had to mother them, they\ncouldn\u2019t do it themselves. But they were great soldiers.",
        "A: No, nobody cared. There were millions of us.",
        "A: Well, d-don\u2019t forget, there is artillery shells, there was bombing. We saw many\ndead bodies \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but most of the dead bodies we saw were \u2014 were Germans, or civilians.",
        "A: It really didn\u2019t bother me too much. Hey, they were the enemy. That\u2019s the idea,\nwe were there to kill them. But th-the helpless families, with the children, with \u2014 I\nreally didn't see \u2014 come to think of it, I don\u2019t think I saw children in Dachau. I\nmean, I saw adults. Now, the children I know were there, I didn\u2019t see any. At that\nstage of time they may have been all killed already.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember seeing any.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: A war zone didn\u2019t bother me.",
        "A: This bothered me, cause we realized what it was, we \u2014 we could see what it was,\nthese people told us what it was. And it was such a complete shock. Nothing in my\nbackground ever could prepare me. It couldn\u2019t prepare anybody for something like\nthis.",
        "A: Yeah, I probably spoke a little Yiddish, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t enough, it really wasn\u2019t enough to communicate with this woman\nwho spoke German. And we have, a lot of guys in the outfit could speak German,\nJuly 14, 1993\nSO we were able to communicate very easily. But \u2014 but that mezuzah business, that\nwas the funniest thing, 1-1f you could call it funny, what happened.",
        "A: Well, it was \u2014I think it got into the Bronx Home News, and that also with the \u2014\nwith the mezuzahs. Th-They\u2019re probably still following me, trying to find me.",
        "A: I came back pretty quickly after. I was back in the United States in August. I got\nback in July. From May \u2014",
        "A: We \u2014 yeah, we were cleaning up areas, searching for soldiers, searching for arms\nand ammunition. And almost immediately we were ordered to go back to the\nUnited States and prepare to go to Japan. Some people went by way of India. We\nwere lucky, we went back toward America and then we were supposed to go to\nCalifornia. After the bomb was dropped, I still had to report to Camp Roberts \u2014\nnot Camp Rob, one of the camps in California. And we were waiting for orders to\ngo overseas and they never came and we were told, okay fellas, you\u2019re going home.\nAnd February 14\", I went home.\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: Yes, but it was strictly as a do this, and do that and you know, clean this up and\nit was not the man to man friendly \u2014 this was still right after the war. We weren't\nallowed to fraternize with them. All the hanky panky with the women and all that,\nthat came later, I guess, after we left. But we were in a town with a big sawmill and\nwe had told the Germans to start cutting two by fours, they needed it for something.\nAnd the guy deliberately, the foreman burnt out the motor by jamming the throttle\nforward instead of doing it gradually. And one of the boys who n \u2014 from the\nsouthern boys said, he\u2019s doing that deliberately, because he knows he\u2019s burning out\nthe motor. So this southern boy put a pistol up to his head and said \u2014 and they got \u2014\nhe got the point, you do it now and you do it right or we put a bullet into you.\nWithin an hour they had it changed and everything ran very smoothly.",
        "A: But they could have done it all day and all night, I wouldn\u2019t have known what\nthey were doing wrong. So this is my very limited exposure with the population.",
        "A: Oh, I never \u2014 I never met a Nazi. I never met a \u2014\nJuly 14, 1993",
        "A: The \u2014 the German soldiers, at first they said, you know, me? N-Ni \u2014 Nazi, no,\nnot me. Maybe him, not me.",
        "A: Yeah, we t \u2014 we went into their homes to take them over for \u2014 for barracks for\nourselves. And one of the expressions I remember was raus(ph) the house. Out of\nthe house, leave. And one of them said in English, where am I gonna go? I said after\n\u2014 after Dachau, I didn\u2019t give a damn, out. We threw out little old ladies, we threw\nout grandmas, it was raining, out. I don\u2019t care where they went.",
