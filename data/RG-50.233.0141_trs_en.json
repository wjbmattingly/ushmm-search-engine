And I\nfinish and I was all time thinking going to the United States. And maybe we go back little bit\nbecause 1939 start war and 1939 I was mobilized to special army unit. We fortificate, we build\nthe forts reinforcing concrete forts against the Germans in north part of Poland where was on\nthis small river, very dangerous, small deep river, we build our Polish fortification. And this\nfortification was going up to 17 September 1939. And first bomb German drop was not Warsaw,\nthe other place, was our (?) where we fortificate on our fortification and German army start in\nfight Poland and our unit go back to east to Russian Soviet border and this was seventeen days\nlike this and meantime the Soviet throw from the plane information all units stop fighting with\nthe Russians and Germans and go. We are your friends. In September 17, the Russian-Soviet\narmy invite in Poland no declaration of war and give us the knife in our army from the back.\nAnd that was very upset and we was very scared what happened. Because two big colossus\nfrom German sixteen million and from Russian eighteen million we have absolutely no chance.\nAnd Russians took all our -- 17 September -- couple of days we were fighting with small group,\npro-Soviet group, Communist group in this area close to East Polish border and near the\nLithuanian border in {Orani} that was less small fighting and Russian Soviet tanks was\nsurround our group and we was forced to surrender. After Soviet took our unit and arrested,\nstart selection. Some old officers were sent on one side and later this officer was killed in (?}.\nSome group was selected young people like me and with the future, army officers, I was trained\nfuture army officers on other side. And people who was rank not with the privates were sent\nhome. And we were arrested and first night I was with my other friends in one room in barn\nand some fellow who, Soviet, who took the guards, let us go during the night after I give my\nwatch and twenty Polish zloty because was couple hundred people there and this fellow took for\nus and six guys, we went out. We divide in six groups and I took with my friend from Warsaw\nand we go west to Warsaw because this place was very close to Russian border. And two guys\ngo north and went to Lithuania and later there to Sweden and from Sweden to England and fight\nagainst the Germans there. We were not so lucky because we must cross the Bug River and go\nto Warsaw and we did this and was very hard, very dangerous because there were so many\nCommunist sympathizers who start threat our military men, we were 1n uniform.",
        "Q: Still in uniform?",
        "A: Uniform, it was very dangerous. We tried to go through the night through the woods going west\nbecause we were scared about the Communist and between the Polish Communists were very\nmany Jewish Communists. Was very danger, not only for Polish, for Jewish people was danger.\nCommunists were working with the Soviets.",
        "Q: Were there a lot of Communists in Poland?",

        "Q: Why do you suppose these people sided with the Communists?",
        "A: I think this was like all over the world, people thinking what is nice in the book, what 1s nice in\nideology probably is nice in practice, and never was. That happened right now in Russia after\n70 years old nobody like to be Communists because Communists was only good for some small\ngroup people who are on the top. This was nothing else like dictatorship.",
        "Q: What did they teach you in school about Russia and the Communists?",
        "A: Excuse me.",

But nobody know live in America what was in Russia.\nWe know. I born almost anti-Communist because I feel myself I am Christian, I am a Catholic.\nI feel if I have two hands I must do everything what 1s possible good for me and for other\npeople and I never grabbed the hand and steal somebody or kill somebody for something what I\nlike have. I was born anti-Communist and I\u2019m glad right now I live so long and the Communist\nfell down. That\u2019s very bad ideology and not practical.",
        "Q: So were you able to get back to Warsaw?",

Was all\ntime very -- my father was very, mother too, very hard working people, very ambition, and very\ngood Catholics and try to rebuild our family again and we start again, business, and we go\nthrough the occupation time. I was arrested couple times from 1940 to 1944. Was couple\nreason. Each day in Warsaw was killed hundred people because Poland was fighting against the\nGerman, not against the German against the Nazi. That\u2019s a big difference -- Nazi and German.\nAnd we special our young people was very anxious fight with German. Once I was arrested\nafter I help some Jewish people. The girl bring to my father factory some small needle what we\nneed for production. And we bought from this girl. We know the girl are from Jewish family\nand was very nice person. We bought and after couple days the girls come back and after the\ngirls come back the German criminal Polizei arrest me and start searching our house, my father,\nmother house, because I live with parents at this time and working for my father in factory and\nwas one of the first arrested.",
        "Q: What was the charge?",
        "A: Charge was what kind connection I have with the Jewish people, why I help and was against\nsome very interesting situation. My mother speak German and start asking the fellows why you\nare arrested my son did nothing and the fellows search, the other three guys search our house\nand find in my drawer couple twenty dollars gold and the chief who take the search give me the\npaper and prepare something in German what I sign and was I found in house in Rome\noccupied by (?) twenty dollars so many pieces. And I sign. And the fellow was from criminal\nPolizei, criminal police. And after moment the fellow go down from third our floor to street.\nMy mother started crying and asked release my son. And the fellow took the gold pieces not\nshow the other guy who searched and released me. I come back to my house.",
        "Q: Was it illegal to have those gold pieces?",
        "A: Was not illegal and this was really value that we can do something, buy something to eat.",
        "Q: How did you get the gold pieces?",
        "A: Oh that\u2019s no problem because this time in Warsaw mostly the gold was valuable thing and you\ncan buy and sell and something like this, you know, and it was in my family, we was not poor\npeople, you know, and that was one, and I never saw the girl again, she was killed or sent to\nconcentration camp.",
        "Q: When did this happen?",
        "A: This was happened 1942 something like this.",
        "Q: So when there was a ghetto...",
        "A: Ghetto was already open and second arrest by Gestapo was I was across the border to ghetto\nmany times because we buy some small part of the machinery what we own and before the war\nall the supply was in the ghetto area and we was forced buy something because we cannot work\nwith this and we receive from Gestapo some paper we can go to ghetto. And meantime if I go\nto ghetto I take all time something to eat to people who live there, sandwiches or some bread or\nsomething like this and one very bad SS man on the border...",
        "Q: Checkpoint.",
        "A: Checkpoint start checking me and so I have some sandwiches and sent me right away to Polish\ncommissariat, mean the Polish prison and from there start not so bad because I was only one\nnight there and I suppose to be sent to working camp in Germany and because my father was\nconnected with underground and Polish police before the war was second was friendly with my\nfather too. My father took some connection and I was free and I never ...(There was a loud\nbang and interruption)",
        "Q: You were talking about your second arrest.",
        "A: My second arrest and I was in Polish prison one night and one day and after my father talked to\nsomebody famous in Polish police I was released I was supposed to go to Arbeit Amt to\nGerman office and I supposed to send to Germany and never happened. I was together with\nfamily from this.",
        "Q: When did you get arrested the second time?",
        "A: That was the second time.",
        "Q: What date was thar?",
        "A: That was about \u201942, \u201943.",
        "Q: The first one was November 1942 and the second?",
        "A: Was 43, something like this.",
        "Q: This was before the ghetto rebelled against the Germans.",
        "A: Before, right. During this moment you mentioned the ghetto uprising, we was very, very upset\nand we cannot eat. I remember this moment we was called and the whole ghetto was burning.\nAnd the smell was so terrible and besides this we know we left there many good people. I was\nvery close with the Jewish people in ghetto because branch what my father was -- knitting, me.\nAnd in knitting line was many Jewish factories and many Jewish hokseller (?) what we was\nconnected automatically because it was the business and many Jewish people, X number, very\nfair playing business men. Some was bad and some was good and we was very upset after we\nsaw the Warsaw burning. And before the Warsaw burning my father and me, we took three\nfamilies from ghetto and we found location, not me, my father mostly --was very good person,\nvery good Christian, and took the Christianity for daily not only during Sunday. In other words\ntook everything what think is right did. This moment because we received, father and me, we\nreceived special privilege going to ghetto buying something what we need for supplying our\nmachinery. People were crying please, good people couple good family you know was\nconnected to us and before the war Jewish uprising my father found three places where the\npeople can hire. One of the places was the Swedish Embassy in Warsaw and there was\nhousekeeper, Polish family, and was very devoted Christian. And this people said to my father\nif you have no choice and you are like help the Jewish people we can hire the people. (Female\nvoice in the background said \u201chide\u2019). And my father took some very big risk because only one\ncountry on Europe during the war German suggest if somebody hire Jewish be killed on spot,\nwhat happened thousand, thousand times. And still my father took the chance and took the\nfamily, Malamed family, Benyamin Malamed and Irena Malamed with two young sons took\nfrom ghetto with the housewives what we have and transferred to the Warsaw Swedish\nEmbassy. These people lived there without the big risk. After moment where German and\nJewish agent start one action where German suggest and propose if Jewish family, Jewish men\nlike be transfer to America or to other country and against the German who was captured by\nAryans and pay some money, that is possible. And this idea was created by agent, Jewish\nfellow, son of the famous Fabricant in Lodz and this fellow organized with the SS Gestapo\nsome place in Warsaw close to our factory {Duga} Hotel Polski and sent all over the\ninformation we transfer Jewish people against the German people in the hands of the Aryans\nand each person must pay some hundred dollars in gold. And my family, Mr. Malamed\nbelieved this and one day said, I am going to Hotel Polski and I be glad to be transferred to\nAmerica and from America some German be transferred here who was in hands of American\narmy or some other army, prisoner of war. And this my friends go there to Hotel Polski and\nfrom this moment we lose the track. After couple weeks we know these people went to some\nconcentration camp on the west and later there we learned that that was Bergen-Belsen because\nPolish underground look which transport come back and probably some search was done by\nPolish underground army and we know the people go west and later there we know was in\nBergen concentration camp. After the war 1946 I took couple of days off from duty in\nAmerican army and I went to Bergen-Belsen, look for my friends. And I was too late. Two\nweeks before I arrived there Malamed family went to Israel.",
        "Q: So they survived?",
        "A: They survived and that\u2019s one family. We received later there from Palestine and later from\nIsrael many cards from this family, very, very good people. Now second two family what we\ndid and I was help to father because I was one family member to work with father because I\nwas twenty two years old, I was not young like my brother, sixteen, or my sister, twelve or\nfifteen. Second family what we try hide was in Hungary Embassy, very famous place on the\ncorner Aleyawiadofskin and Chopina, Ulica Chopina in Warsaw where the old embassy was\nbefore the war two. And again the supervisor of the whole Hungarian Embassy was my father\nfriend and again my father pleas for the favor hire these people. And this gentleman said fine\nand we sent the two family, one was Mr. Landau and wife with son. Mr. Landau was in our\nbranch, both Jewish people was in the same branch, knitting. Me. Landau was owner of the\nstocking factory in Lodz and we was very good connected.",
        "Q: So he was from Lodz, not from Warsaw?",
        "A: From Lodz and later there was in Warsaw ghetto. We know him from Lodz and was in Warsaw\nghetto and we took these people, not really we because I not was there, my father created\ndifferent situation asked some Polish policeman who took the people and bring to the place here\nsupposed to be mean to Hungarian Embassy. I was couple time there visit. This was not nice\nplace because was in basement, second basement below the ground level because this was\nbuilding years, years ago belonged to very famous Polish aristocracy. And this was below,\nsecond floor below the ground because was wine cellar and this people was there for x number\nof months. I visit there. The people receive each couple days special food there and this time\nyou must be very careful buy big amount of food because people think you are single why you\nbuy so much, if it was possible to buy. And this building was not occupied by nobody because\nwas partly destroyed. And still my father friend was each day there and watched after the\nbuilding. The same talking you know, go to the people and bring him something. And was very\nfamous situation in Warsaw where maybe you know from the other sources, in Warsaw was SS\nvery brutal man Kutschera, General Kutschera and this animal killed people each day by own\nhand and was escorted each day by twenty, thirty chairmen with guns and gun prepared to shoot\nif somebody attacked the SS man Kutschera and main office Kutschera was three buildings\nfrom the place where our people was hire in the basement and we was thinking and the people\nwas thinking this is the best place, close to the SS. And every week was all right. Only one day\nPolish underground tried to kill Kutschera because he was a very bad man who killed thousand\npeople and sent to death. On the corner Chopina where the Embassy was and the Polish\nunderground took the action. Kutschera was killed. Many other German was killed and that\nwas good for Polish underground. And was not good for the people who was in the basement\nbecause from this moment all blocks was put with the wire around and nobody could go in and\nout from the building where was hire the Jewish two family. Was Mr. like I said before and\nsecond family was only one person Mr. Epstein. And was start problem supply the food for the\npeople in the basement. And we never go there because later there start Warsaw uprising and\nthe people living in the basement lose the contact. We know from other people later after\nWarsaw uprising the people survived all Warsaw uprising and go to scourge (?) because after\nWarsaw collapsed the Germans took all people out from Warsaw and go to checkpoint in\nGeraldof or near the border of Warsaw and select. And because these people was very, very\nweak and white color the German SS recognize the people was Jewish and Warsaw uprising\nmean the march from Warsaw was only family Landau, son and mother and father. The other,\nMr. Epstein, was probably like some people think was killed by Landau family.",
        "Q: By Landau family?",
        "A: Because was not enough food and water. This I don\u2019t know. I was not there. People told to\nme, only I know the corpse, the body of Mr. Epstein still in the basement in Warsaw on Chopina\ncorner and probably nobody know are buried in the basement there. That\u2019s story I heard after I\ncome back to Poland from American army and I talked to people who survived the Warsaw\nuprising. That was three family, nice people who we tried help. And I think so we did, people\nask me why you did this. First we are Christians and in our religion if we have chance help\nsomebody, we do. Not me. I am love all Jewish people like Mr. Kahana or Mr. Weiss from\nYork, I not like him. And still if the fellow be on edge of the cliff probably I give him help.\nThat\u2019s I did in 1943, \u00b044. That was about helping people in very brutal situation. My personal\nwhat you like know more, personal; experience in a concentration camp?",
        "Q: First of all the Warsaw uprising.",
        "A: Warsaw uprising probably you have more, you have tomorrow or today you talk to my brother\nwho was longer in the Warsaw uprising. Because we was divided, our family, two really three\ngroups. My brother, younger brother, was in middle Warsaw and what was in the group what\nwas fighting with the Germans and still was the special commando. Myself and my father we\nwas all the time home, army and we support, we hire you know all paper for print or stuff like\nthis and we give money for underground organization. And after Warsaw uprising start, in our\nfactory, our building, was all ammunition and the sharp rifles, pistol, and something else. And I\nnever know that our group was so big because I know only two, three people around me\nbecause all organization was do designed I know only couple people. My father know only\ncouple people. We never know big circle the people. And after the Warsaw uprising start our\nmagazine was opened. And was so many people asked for and has title to ammunition and\npistol or something. Was fifty percent without some gun, ammunition, some grown-up or\nsomething like this. That was 175 Kilinski battalion and the first day we was ready without the\nguns. Warsaw uprising was very,very much cost our life, our people. The best people was\ndying. Quarter million people died during Warsaw uprising, the best.",
        "Q: When did you join the resistance, the underground?",
        "A: We was already two years before in ??",
        "Q: So 1942 you...",
        "A: \"40, \u00b040, \u00b042 I was already.",
        "Q: And what about your father?",
        "A: My father was all the time and that was the second group we was in near our factory. And my\nintention was after I not receive gun, I was training because during the 1939 I was doing couple\nmonths with army. And I was very upset, I have no gun. What kind of soldier if I have no gun,\nnothing. And the special youngest people was so aggressive and was against the Germans took\neverything what was in our basement location. That was not belong to this place too. In our\nbuilding and not belong to us was to the group Kalinski battalion.",
        "Q: That was your unit?",
        "A: My unit. And later I took, you know, because I was ? I mean build bridges, destroyed bridges\nor something like this, I was start with the fortification there. And I was very upset during the\nwhole Warsaw uprising.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Why? Because I was thinking is too much cost our life and we have gained very little. Why\nwas my thinking this way? Because young people who never was in the war don\u2019t know\nnothing how the war looked. And 1939 I was in Polish army, I know the Russian army, and I\nknow the German army going from the east to Warsaw. And special during the Hitler time in\nWarsaw, \u00b039, \u00b044 I was thinking this 1s fighting with the so big colors, people, so big army, we\nhad no chance. And Russian army asked Polish underground start fighting with German in\n1944, and after we start fighting the Russians never helped us and never asked again start\nfighting with Germans. That was my think. And our group I lose couple of friends in the action\nand we was in the old part of the Warsaw. And after the part of Warsaw was collapsed we were\nsupposed to go through the Commouse (?) below the ground to the middle part of the Warsaw\nshould ?misht(?) in. And we never caused this because we was left? group was going to ? us\nand prevent German going from the ghetto, this area, to however place where we was there.\nAnd after last moment the Commouse was destroyed because Germans put the? in the? We had\nno chance to go to (?) joint with the other part of the Warsaw underground, uprising unit. And I\nwent to my mother house and we took our clothes what we was fighting and we changed for\ncivilian clothes. And that was couple hours. After couple hours I only eat, dress, wash my\nhands, and took the other clothes and German start screaming and the whole house rouse. In\nother words we must go out from the basement and we must go to outside. And we did this.",
        "Q: Who are you now, who are together?",
        "A: And we meet together, my mother, my two sister, and the same time, my father.",
        "Q: Did he take his uniform off, too?",
        "A: My father was not in uniform.",
        "Q: So he was not fighting?",
        "A: Fighting, yes, organized everything there. Based Fabricant (?) where 1s our factory. That was\nvery active man. Only was not, was forty couple years old, and was not fight with what, with\nstone. You cannot fight with stone. And was not enough guns, ammunition, etc. Was maybe\n20 % people with guns and the other was doing nothing. In middle part of the Warsaw was\nbetter organized.",
        "Q: Where your brother was?",
        "A: Yes, that was better prepared for this. And after this moment we go out from the basement\nwhere we lived. We lived close to the ------- in our house was the church. And we go out from\nthe basement and (?) and up and search and we went couple miles by foot to the point where we\nwas sent to train and from train to some special big barracks and we was select there to\nconcentration camp. During the march from our house to the place where we was sent to the\nrailroad was very bad moment because many Ukrainian people work for Germans and was very,\nvery molested situation. My mother cannot take the ring, gold ring from the finger and the\nfellow like cut my mother finger.",
        "Q: She cut it?",
        "A: Like cut. And the German soldier said what you doing stupid? And let my mother go because\nthis old lady cannot take this. And from this moment we go to Krushkuff near the Warsaw.\nThat was big old railroad factory and we sleep there one night and we supposed to go\nsomeplace. And we were selected, old people on one side, young people on other. And my\nmother was sent on side with the old people and my father and my mother said no, I not leave\nmy children, I go together. And go with us to group where was selected to concentration camp.\nThat\u2019s my mother went to concentration camp.",
        "Q: Where did the other group go?",
        "A: The other group go free. The others go someplace where we don\u2019t know and was old people\nwas free, sixty, seventy years old, fifty or under. Young people was sent on one side and was\nselected to concentration camp. This was first part where German took old Warsaw. This time\nthe fighting army was (?) was called by German like bandit, not fighting people for freedom,\nlike bandit. Later there the International Red Cross and other sources press the German and the\nfighting army was equal to prisoner of war. I was not so lucky, I go to concentration camp.",
        "Q: Do you remember when your family was arrested? Before the battle was finished, right?",
        "A: You mean before the Warsaw uprising? That was I think about the first of September. Later\nthere we go to the place and again this was not so lucky because we was in Prushkof the whole\nfamily with me, the father, two sister, and me was in Prushkof, the old factory. And we\nsupposed to go to someplace we don\u2019t know yet at this time. And I talked to one Austrian\nfellow with Austrian insignia in German army because I speak German. I asked him listen,\nwhat we can do, we must go from here, and my mother is sick. And the fellow said, maybe I\ncan help you and said, you can go out if you pay some money in gold. And we have the gold\nwith us because nobody said (?). And I give for each person twenty gold dollars. And was\neverything prepared. We must go through physician and select like sick people. And one hour\nafter I talk to this fellow some start \u201cboom\u201d there and SS start screaming, shrying and make\nnoise, everybody out. Why? Because from Red Cross International, Red Cross from Sweden\nand Switzerland, people supposed to see how German treat the people after Warsaw uprising.\nAnd we was pressed going up to the doctor, we was lying to the doctor, and we was take out,\nkick and push and put in the cars, cow cars, how do you call the transport?",
        "Q: Cattle cars.",
        "A: Right and we was pushed there for so many people. How many can go in? And the train goes.\nAnd was two weeks. I not remember exactly -- was long time. We go from one place to other\nand nobody like take us. Because all concentration camps was full. And after all, we go so\nlong around Germany, we went in concentration camp Flossenburg.",
        "Q: Did they feed you when you were on the train?",
        "A: Very little. Very little, and we have with us....really I don\u2019t remember, I know we have\nsomething to eat, our stuff because we took from Warsaw something. Nobody take from us\nnothing.",
        "Q: What about water?",
        "A: With water was not so good. With water I was sick after it. All transport I was very sick to the\nstomach. And I was thinking I die, because why I stay in the transport. I was like usual very\nstupid family man. I was thinking family that 1s something what is not breakable. Because was\ntwo young sister, my mother and my father. I was thinking I am the most powerful young\nfellow and I have not other obligation, I must help my family. Special I was taught by my\nfather and mother. My father and mother was four years in World War First in working camp in\nGermany and said to us, because we was family we survived. And going to Germany with my\nfamily I was thinking the same. I am the youngest fellow, powerful. I supposed to help and I\nhelp because I know my character. And happened was not working place only was\nconcentration dead camp where we was there and selected, women Theresienstadt and men stay\nin Flossenburg. And after the whole transport we go from Warsaw by this car. If I have not\nobligation to my family I go hundred times escape because was not so bad. During night I can\njump because was open. I can do this. And I cannot jump and go and lift my mother who was\nfifty years old and my father and two young girls. And that was the reason I landed in\nconcentration camp. After we arrived on Flossenburg I was thinking I die. After we stopped in\none place before Flossenburg, Weiden I asked the fellow who was on the train, give me hot\nwater a little bit because I am very sick. I speak German and the fellow said fine, I give you.\nAnd give me the steam, after one minute there was water from the steam. AndI drink maybe\none a little this and that\u2019s what probably helped me. And from this moment the locomotive was\nchanged and to this transport the locomotive was connected with SS people. Because SS people\nonly go to concentration camp with the transport.",
        "Q: So before then these were German army?",
        "A: German railroad men. Railroad men was like army during the war. And we went there to\nconcentration camp, Flossenburg and there was so nice sign \u201cArbeit Macht Frei\u2019 mean during\nthe work you can be free. And there was the selection, women on one side, men on the other.\nAnd start the problem like you know all concentration camp has. Each day something new,\neach day people were killed. People was pushed from the stone, steinbruk from hundred twenty\nfeet high. On the top, you know, somebody push you to the bottom. People from the first\nmoment was selection who 1s engineer on one side, who is physician on other side, and these\npeople who was high educated was killed first, not by bullet, by walking up to knee in the\nwater, very bad condition. And people who work all time hard and has hard life was prepared to\nthis. The intelligent people was not prepared. Each day was somebody from our group to die,\ndie. And was so many diseases and was terrible. From our transport, I remember somebody\ntook the numbers, over three and a half thousand people come back only one hundred eighty\nthree people back. Between the bad people was two friendly American boys who supplied to\nWarsaw through the air ammunition and guns was shot by German and landed close to our\nhouse Mirdova and went with us together to concentration camp Flossenburg and if you go to\nFlossenburg what I visit couple years ago are how many Polish people died there, was mostly\ndied Polish, Russian, very small Jewish and two Americans. They died in Flossenburg. Help\nPolish people. And till concentration camp terrible, was very bad, and our camp was governed\nby criminals, not only SS criminals, and German criminals. We political because from Warsaw\noperation was political. We were called political prisoners. We was with the red triangle and P.\nThe other German prisoner, the bandits, was with green. Other color, some Jewish was blacks\n(?) star. And I tell you one thing, in concentration camp I never think people the prisoner was\nvery friendly each other and never, never I saw or (?) you re Polish or you are Jewish or you\nare, for example, French. Was not so, people think was very bad atmosphere. We never had\nbad experience, for example, with French, Jewish, Russian, the same. We was prisoner. We\nexperienced the same problem and that\u2019s the story in concentration camp. Many things I can\npoint out to you about the concentration camp because it was a very brutal moment and\ndepressed. How many times you go do something somebody push you, the SS or kapo. Kapo\nmostly was in our concentration camp was German prisoners, sadist. And some was Jewish too.\nAnd I cannot say the prisoner was something one against the other. In my camp was like I said\nbefore, General Kenaus was killed and all generals, Italian generals who was against Hitler and\nMussolini this time, the group called General (??) people, generals, age 60-70 was treated very,\nvery badly by not only German, by the prisoners, I don\u2019t know why, the people must have died\nthere. Because was something this time I did not understand. In my eye one general was not\nkilled and was very, very bad wounded by one criminals and took a chair and punch the chair\non the head. And each day was terrible. And problem was the Appel. It was the Appel and\nsomebody was missing because died already and where is the body, for example, because on\nAppel we must count the body and live people. That sometimes takes two hours, three hours\nbefore every numbers come together. I hope I can tell you more. Many friends from my town,\nfrom this group, 3,000, died, because there was not enough eat, was not enough medicine. I\nwas very lucky, I got some in hospital. And my father, special, helped many Polish people give\nsome medicine, maybe not help too much and still help some. After war was end some Russian\npeople, in this concentration camp was 5,000 Russian army officers, and this people was stoned\none guy (??) who was very brutal, beat my father once very badly, and this Russian (?) took the\ngun because American army give us the gun. Shoot if you think so somebody 1s, give it to him.\nShoot him. Nobody from Polish group shoot nobody. The Russian a good many, many, many.",
        "Q: You mention your father was badly beaten. Why was he beaten?",
        "A: Beaten for no reason, no reason at all. We go with my father to the Appel Place what we have\ntitle to do and Lagerfuhrer go against us and for no reason punch my father in nose and start\nkicking. I was shocked. What I can do? And my father wake up and said excuse and we go\ntogether and my father and said, listen these people can kick me or anybody can. No reason.",
        "Q: So how did you survive? Looking back what are the reasons for your survival?",
        "A: My reason for survival I think was the connection with friend who was from beginning help us,\nJan Shienitski because this fellow looked after us. If I have nobody there I am sure I die.\nBesides this I was young, 23, 24 years old. I was good sportsman, my body was built good and\nI was feed good before the uprising. We eat, some people has not food, not enough food or not\ngood food and these people die fast. That was the reason. And besides this reason was my\nmother was, I feel, during my sitting in concentration camp, each evening I prayed to the God,\nif somebody must die, better me because I am alone, not my mother, not my sisters, not my\nfather because my father has obligations to family, my mother obligation to sisters. All time I\npray. After I come back from camp, my mother said each day I prayed to God the same. Let\ntake me, I am the oldest woman and save the children. Probably something helped us.",
        "Q: Somebody answered your prayers.",
        "A: Yeah, that I think. And one thing more in the concentration camp if I can mention you, I was in\nthe revier (?) mean the hospital and my bed was very close to on the other side of the other\nroom was (?). People, die people, after somebody died, the clothes was taking out and the dead\npeople was laying on the floor, they took the other before, dentists take their teeth. And listen,\nbehind the wall maybe couple hundred corpse there and one day was some shooting from the\ntower, one of the tower near the crematorium where I lived was shooting and the bullets go all\nover and we was be killed. Only the corpse of the dead people catch the bullets, not me. And\nwhat happened, next day we check what happened. Some Russian prisoner go to the\nLichencomer mean the morgue, go there and pick up the gold teeth, stealing the gold teeth from\nthe people. And the fellow who was on the watching tower saw him and put the reflector, the\nspot there, and start shooting. And I was very lucky. I was behind this corpse of the dead\npeople.",
        "Q: So they were shooting into your barracks because the Russians had stolen the gold and you\nwere saved by the piles of bodies.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Any other miracles?",
        "A: Not many kinds on the fight. I not fight in my life too much and during the concentration camp\nI fight with fellow the same age like me. This was Russian Communist young officer who all\n(?) said don\u2019t worry, Pole, Poland never be free. Be seventeenth Russian Republic. And I was\nvery patriotic. I said you crazy, you stupid, Poland be free again. And we start fighting. And\neach couple day was the same. And I never fight with other people. I fight with him. And now\nafter so many years my fight was right, Poland is free, Russian Communists is dead.",
        "Q: Is that a good time to end?",
        "A: No, I think so. We got much more time, I think so now. I was not prepared for\nthis.....select.....",
        "Q: Well the rest we can get from your book about your experiences.",
        "A: I am glad this going to some museum and special the Holocaust Museum and I be glad it be\nplaced there and this way we know was not only Jewish people killed in Holocaust, was French,\nPolish, Russian, Zigoinen (gypsies) and many others. And many people like me Christian also\nsuffered from the topalistic (?) German fanatic and Russian Communist dictator.",
        "Q: One final question, when did you come to America?",
        "A: 1961.",
        "Q: After you got married?",
        "A: Yes, with two children. And I am glad because so much Polish people suffer and we think we\nmust create for our children better life, not only economically, free country, one of the famous\nfree country and we are glad that we are here. And my father was dreaming going to America\n1914. And going to America by boat from Warsaw to Gdansk and start break war, war fast.",
        "Q: And he never tried again?",
        "A: Never tried again. We was in American zone. We can stay there. I was part of army and I go\nfor one month to Poland and I come back to border green and was shooting and so on. I go to\nPoland because my sisters and my mother was in Poland and I know I like take from Poland\nthree and bring to United States and go to Germany. Was not possible because my mother said I\nam so weak, I cannot go. My sisters said we stay with mother. I come back to my father, to\nGermany. My father decide if so I go there. And after one year later I go back to Poland and I\nwas fifteen waiting for possibility to go to United States.",

We fortificate, we build\nthe forts reinforcing concrete forts against the Germans in north part of Poland where was on\nthis small river, very dangerous, small deep river, we build our Polish fortification.

        "A: This was happened 1942 something like this.",
        "A: Ghetto was already open and second arrest by Gestapo was I was across the border to ghetto\nmany times because we buy some small part of the machinery what we own and before the war\nall the supply was in the ghetto area and we was forced buy something because we cannot work\nwith this and we receive from Gestapo some paper we can go to ghetto. And meantime if I go\nto ghetto I take all time something to eat to people who live there, sandwiches or some bread or\nsomething like this and one very bad SS man on the border...",
        "A: Checkpoint start checking me and so I have some sandwiches and sent me right away to Polish\ncommissariat, mean the Polish prison and from there start not so bad because I was only one\nnight there and I suppose to be sent to working camp in Germany and because my father was\nconnected with underground and Polish police before the war was second was friendly with my\nfather too. My father took some connection and I was free and I never ...(There was a loud\nbang and interruption)",
        "A: My second arrest and I was in Polish prison one night and one day and after my father talked to\nsomebody famous in Polish police I was released I was supposed to go to Arbeit Amt to\nGerman office and I supposed to send to Germany and never happened. I was together with\nfamily from this.",
        "A: That was the second time.",
        "A: That was about \u201942, \u201943.",
        "A: Was 43, something like this.",
        "A: Before, right. During this moment you mentioned the ghetto uprising, we was very, very upset\nand we cannot eat. I remember this moment we was called and the whole ghetto was burning.\nAnd the smell was so terrible and besides this we know we left there many good people. I was\nvery close with the Jewish people in ghetto because branch what my father was -- knitting, me.\nAnd in knitting line was many Jewish factories and many Jewish hokseller (?) what we was\nconnected automatically because it was the business and many Jewish people, X number, very\nfair playing business men. Some was bad and some was good and we was very upset after we\nsaw the Warsaw burning. And before the Warsaw burning my father and me, we took three\nfamilies from ghetto and we found location, not me, my father mostly --was very good person,\nvery good Christian, and took the Christianity for daily not only during Sunday. In other words\ntook everything what think is right did. This moment because we received, father and me, we\nreceived special privilege going to ghetto buying something what we need for supplying our\nmachinery. People were crying please, good people couple good family you know was\nconnected to us and before the war Jewish uprising my father found three places where the\npeople can hire. One of the places was the Swedish Embassy in Warsaw and there was\nhousekeeper, Polish family, and was very devoted Christian. And this people said to my father\nif you have no choice and you are like help the Jewish people we can hire the people. (Female\nvoice in the background said \u201chide\u2019). And my father took some very big risk because only one\ncountry on Europe during the war German suggest if somebody hire Jewish be killed on spot,\nwhat happened thousand, thousand times. And still my father took the chance and took the\nfamily, Malamed family, Benyamin Malamed and Irena Malamed with two young sons took\nfrom ghetto with the housewives what we have and transferred to the Warsaw Swedish\nEmbassy. These people lived there without the big risk. After moment where German and\nJewish agent start one action where German suggest and propose if Jewish family, Jewish men\nlike be transfer to America or to other country and against the German who was captured by\nAryans and pay some money, that is possible. And this idea was created by agent, Jewish\nfellow, son of the famous Fabricant in Lodz and this fellow organized with the SS Gestapo\nsome place in Warsaw close to our factory {Duga} Hotel Polski and sent all over the\ninformation we transfer Jewish people against the German people in the hands of the Aryans\nand each person must pay some hundred dollars in gold. And my family, Mr. Malamed\nbelieved this and one day said, I am going to Hotel Polski and I be glad to be transferred to\nAmerica and from America some German be transferred here who was in hands of American\narmy or some other army, prisoner of war. And this my friends go there to Hotel Polski and\nfrom this moment we lose the track. After couple weeks we know these people went to some\nconcentration camp on the west and later there we learned that that was Bergen-Belsen because\nPolish underground look which transport come back and probably some search was done by\nPolish underground army and we know the people go west and later there we know was in\nBergen concentration camp. After the war 1946 I took couple of days off from duty in\nAmerican army and I went to Bergen-Belsen, look for my friends. And I was too late. Two\nweeks before I arrived there Malamed family went to Israel.",
        "A: They survived and that\u2019s one family. We received later there from Palestine and later from\nIsrael many cards from this family, very, very good people. Now second two family what we\ndid and I was help to father because I was one family member to work with father because I\nwas twenty two years old, I was not young like my brother, sixteen, or my sister, twelve or\nfifteen. Second family what we try hide was in Hungary Embassy, very famous place on the\ncorner Aleyawiadofskin and Chopina, Ulica Chopina in Warsaw where the old embassy was\nbefore the war two. And again the supervisor of the whole Hungarian Embassy was my father\nfriend and again my father pleas for the favor hire these people. And this gentleman said fine\nand we sent the two family, one was Mr. Landau and wife with son. Mr. Landau was in our\nbranch, both Jewish people was in the same branch, knitting. Me. Landau was owner of the\nstocking factory in Lodz and we was very good connected.",
        "A: From Lodz and later there was in Warsaw ghetto. We know him from Lodz and was in Warsaw\nghetto and we took these people, not really we because I not was there, my father created\ndifferent situation asked some Polish policeman who took the people and bring to the place here\nsupposed to be mean to Hungarian Embassy. I was couple time there visit. This was not nice\nplace because was in basement, second basement below the ground level because this was\nbuilding years, years ago belonged to very famous Polish aristocracy. And this was below,\nsecond floor below the ground because was wine cellar and this people was there for x number\nof months. I visit there. The people receive each couple days special food there and this time\nyou must be very careful buy big amount of food because people think you are single why you\nbuy so much, if it was possible to buy. And this building was not occupied by nobody because\nwas partly destroyed. And still my father friend was each day there and watched after the\nbuilding. The same talking you know, go to the people and bring him something. And was very\nfamous situation in Warsaw where maybe you know from the other sources, in Warsaw was SS\nvery brutal man Kutschera, General Kutschera and this animal killed people each day by own\nhand and was escorted each day by twenty, thirty chairmen with guns and gun prepared to shoot\nif somebody attacked the SS man Kutschera and main office Kutschera was three buildings\nfrom the place where our people was hire in the basement and we was thinking and the people\nwas thinking this is the best place, close to the SS. And every week was all right. Only one day\nPolish underground tried to kill Kutschera because he was a very bad man who killed thousand\npeople and sent to death. On the corner Chopina where the Embassy was and the Polish\nunderground took the action. Kutschera was killed. Many other German was killed and that\nwas good for Polish underground. And was not good for the people who was in the basement\nbecause from this moment all blocks was put with the wire around and nobody could go in and\nout from the building where was hire the Jewish two family. Was Mr. like I said before and\nsecond family was only one person Mr. Epstein. And was start problem supply the food for the\npeople in the basement. And we never go there because later there start Warsaw uprising and\nthe people living in the basement lose the contact. We know from other people later after\nWarsaw uprising the people survived all Warsaw uprising and go to scourge (?) because after\nWarsaw collapsed the Germans took all people out from Warsaw and go to checkpoint in\nGeraldof or near the border of Warsaw and select. And because these people was very, very\nweak and white color the German SS recognize the people was Jewish and Warsaw uprising\nmean the march from Warsaw was only family Landau, son and mother and father. The other,\nMr. Epstein, was probably like some people think was killed by Landau family.",
        "A: Because was not enough food and water. This I don\u2019t know. I was not there. People told to\nme, only I know the corpse, the body of Mr. Epstein still in the basement in Warsaw on Chopina\ncorner and probably nobody know are buried in the basement there. That\u2019s story I heard after I\ncome back to Poland from American army and I talked to people who survived the Warsaw\nuprising. That was three family, nice people who we tried help. And I think so we did, people\nask me why you did this. First we are Christians and in our religion if we have chance help\nsomebody, we do. Not me. I am love all Jewish people like Mr. Kahana or Mr. Weiss from\nYork, I not like him. And still if the fellow be on edge of the cliff probably I give him help.\nThat\u2019s I did in 1943, \u00b044. That was about helping people in very brutal situation. My personal\nwhat you like know more, personal; experience in a concentration camp?",
        "A: Warsaw uprising probably you have more, you have tomorrow or today you talk to my brother\nwho was longer in the Warsaw uprising. Because we was divided, our family, two really three\ngroups. My brother, younger brother, was in middle Warsaw and what was in the group what\nwas fighting with the Germans and still was the special commando. Myself and my father we\nwas all the time home, army and we support, we hire you know all paper for print or stuff like\nthis and we give money for underground organization. And after Warsaw uprising start, in our\nfactory, our building, was all ammunition and the sharp rifles, pistol, and something else. And I\nnever know that our group was so big because I know only two, three people around me\nbecause all organization was do designed I know only couple people. My father know only\ncouple people. We never know big circle the people. And after the Warsaw uprising start our\nmagazine was opened. And was so many people asked for and has title to ammunition and\npistol or something. Was fifty percent without some gun, ammunition, some grown-up or\nsomething like this. That was 175 Kilinski battalion and the first day we was ready without the\nguns. Warsaw uprising was very,very much cost our life, our people. The best people was\ndying. Quarter million people died during Warsaw uprising, the best.",
        "A: We was already two years before in ??",
        "A: \"40, \u00b040, \u00b042 I was already.",
        "A: My father was all the time and that was the second group we was in near our factory. And my\nintention was after I not receive gun, I was training because during the 1939 I was doing couple\nmonths with army. And I was very upset, I have no gun. What kind of soldier if I have no gun,\nnothing. And the special youngest people was so aggressive and was against the Germans took\neverything what was in our basement location. That was not belong to this place too. In our\nbuilding and not belong to us was to the group Kalinski battalion.",
        "A: My unit. And later I took, you know, because I was ? I mean build bridges, destroyed bridges\nor something like this, I was start with the fortification there. And I was very upset during the\nwhole Warsaw uprising.",
        "A: Why? Because I was thinking is too much cost our life and we have gained very little. Why\nwas my thinking this way? Because young people who never was in the war don\u2019t know\nnothing how the war looked. And 1939 I was in Polish army, I know the Russian army, and I\nknow the German army going from the east to Warsaw. And special during the Hitler time in\nWarsaw, \u00b039, \u00b044 I was thinking this 1s fighting with the so big colors, people, so big army, we\nhad no chance. And Russian army asked Polish underground start fighting with German in\n1944, and after we start fighting the Russians never helped us and never asked again start\nfighting with Germans. That was my think. And our group I lose couple of friends in the action\nand we was in the old part of the Warsaw. And after the part of Warsaw was collapsed we were\nsupposed to go through the Commouse (?) below the ground to the middle part of the Warsaw\nshould ?misht(?) in. And we never caused this because we was left? group was going to ? us\nand prevent German going from the ghetto, this area, to however place where we was there.\nAnd after last moment the Commouse was destroyed because Germans put the? in the? We had\nno chance to go to (?) joint with the other part of the Warsaw underground, uprising unit. And I\nwent to my mother house and we took our clothes what we was fighting and we changed for\ncivilian clothes. And that was couple hours. After couple hours I only eat, dress, wash my\nhands, and took the other clothes and German start screaming and the whole house rouse. In\nother words we must go out from the basement and we must go to outside. And we did this.",
        "A: And we meet together, my mother, my two sister, and the same time, my father.",
        "A: My father was not in uniform.",
        "A: Fighting, yes, organized everything there. Based Fabricant (?) where 1s our factory. That was\nvery active man. Only was not, was forty couple years old, and was not fight with what, with\nstone. You cannot fight with stone. And was not enough guns, ammunition, etc. Was maybe\n20 % people with guns and the other was doing nothing. In middle part of the Warsaw was\nbetter organized.",
        "A: Yes, that was better prepared for this. And after this moment we go out from the basement\nwhere we lived. We lived close to the ------- in our house was the church. And we go out from\nthe basement and (?) and up and search and we went couple miles by foot to the point where we\nwas sent to train and from train to some special big barracks and we was select there to\nconcentration camp. During the march from our house to the place where we was sent to the\nrailroad was very bad moment because many Ukrainian people work for Germans and was very,\nvery molested situation. My mother cannot take the ring, gold ring from the finger and the\nfellow like cut my mother finger.",
        "A: Like cut. And the German soldier said what you doing stupid? And let my mother go because\nthis old lady cannot take this. And from this moment we go to Krushkuff near the Warsaw.\nThat was big old railroad factory and we sleep there one night and we supposed to go\nsomeplace. And we were selected, old people on one side, young people on other. And my\nmother was sent on side with the old people and my father and my mother said no, I not leave\nmy children, I go together. And go with us to group where was selected to concentration camp.\nThat\u2019s my mother went to concentration camp.",
        "A: The other group go free. The others go someplace where we don\u2019t know and was old people\nwas free, sixty, seventy years old, fifty or under. Young people was sent on one side and was\nselected to concentration camp. This was first part where German took old Warsaw. This time\nthe fighting army was (?) was called by German like bandit, not fighting people for freedom,\nlike bandit. Later there the International Red Cross and other sources press the German and the\nfighting army was equal to prisoner of war. I was not so lucky, I go to concentration camp.",
        "A: You mean before the Warsaw uprising? That was I think about the first of September. Later\nthere we go to the place and again this was not so lucky because we was in Prushkof the whole\nfamily with me, the father, two sister, and me was in Prushkof, the old factory. And we\nsupposed to go to someplace we don\u2019t know yet at this time. And I talked to one Austrian\nfellow with Austrian insignia in German army because I speak German. I asked him listen,\nwhat we can do, we must go from here, and my mother is sick. And the fellow said, maybe I\ncan help you and said, you can go out if you pay some money in gold. And we have the gold\nwith us because nobody said (?). And I give for each person twenty gold dollars. And was\neverything prepared. We must go through physician and select like sick people. And one hour\nafter I talk to this fellow some start \u201cboom\u201d there and SS start screaming, shrying and make\nnoise, everybody out. Why? Because from Red Cross International, Red Cross from Sweden\nand Switzerland, people supposed to see how German treat the people after Warsaw uprising.\nAnd we was pressed going up to the doctor, we was lying to the doctor, and we was take out,\nkick and push and put in the cars, cow cars, how do you call the transport?",
        "A: Right and we was pushed there for so many people. How many can go in? And the train goes.\nAnd was two weeks. I not remember exactly -- was long time. We go from one place to other\nand nobody like take us. Because all concentration camps was full. And after all, we go so\nlong around Germany, we went in concentration camp Flossenburg.",
        "A: Very little. Very little, and we have with us....really I don\u2019t remember, I know we have\nsomething to eat, our stuff because we took from Warsaw something. Nobody take from us\nnothing.",
        "A: With water was not so good. With water I was sick after it. All transport I was very sick to the\nstomach. And I was thinking I die, because why I stay in the transport. I was like usual very\nstupid family man. I was thinking family that 1s something what is not breakable. Because was\ntwo young sister, my mother and my father. I was thinking I am the most powerful young\nfellow and I have not other obligation, I must help my family. Special I was taught by my\nfather and mother. My father and mother was four years in World War First in working camp in\nGermany and said to us, because we was family we survived. And going to Germany with my\nfamily I was thinking the same. I am the youngest fellow, powerful. I supposed to help and I\nhelp because I know my character. And happened was not working place only was\nconcentration dead camp where we was there and selected, women Theresienstadt and men stay\nin Flossenburg. And after the whole transport we go from Warsaw by this car. If I have not\nobligation to my family I go hundred times escape because was not so bad. During night I can\njump because was open. I can do this. And I cannot jump and go and lift my mother who was\nfifty years old and my father and two young girls. And that was the reason I landed in\nconcentration camp. After we arrived on Flossenburg I was thinking I die. After we stopped in\none place before Flossenburg, Weiden I asked the fellow who was on the train, give me hot\nwater a little bit because I am very sick. I speak German and the fellow said fine, I give you.\nAnd give me the steam, after one minute there was water from the steam. AndI drink maybe\none a little this and that\u2019s what probably helped me. And from this moment the locomotive was\nchanged and to this transport the locomotive was connected with SS people. Because SS people\nonly go to concentration camp with the transport.",
        "A: German railroad men. Railroad men was like army during the war. And we went there to\nconcentration camp, Flossenburg and there was so nice sign \u201cArbeit Macht Frei\u2019 mean during\nthe work you can be free. And there was the selection, women on one side, men on the other.\nAnd start the problem like you know all concentration camp has. Each day something new,\neach day people were killed. People was pushed from the stone, steinbruk from hundred twenty\nfeet high. On the top, you know, somebody push you to the bottom. People from the first\nmoment was selection who 1s engineer on one side, who is physician on other side, and these\npeople who was high educated was killed first, not by bullet, by walking up to knee in the\nwater, very bad condition. And people who work all time hard and has hard life was prepared to\nthis. The intelligent people was not prepared. Each day was somebody from our group to die,\ndie. And was so many diseases and was terrible. From our transport, I remember somebody\ntook the numbers, over three and a half thousand people come back only one hundred eighty\nthree people back. Between the bad people was two friendly American boys who supplied to\nWarsaw through the air ammunition and guns was shot by German and landed close to our\nhouse Mirdova and went with us together to concentration camp Flossenburg and if you go to\nFlossenburg what I visit couple years ago are how many Polish people died there, was mostly\ndied Polish, Russian, very small Jewish and two Americans. They died in Flossenburg. Help\nPolish people. And till concentration camp terrible, was very bad, and our camp was governed\nby criminals, not only SS criminals, and German criminals. We political because from Warsaw\noperation was political. We were called political prisoners. We was with the red triangle and P.\nThe other German prisoner, the bandits, was with green. Other color, some Jewish was blacks\n(?) star. And I tell you one thing, in concentration camp I never think people the prisoner was\nvery friendly each other and never, never I saw or (?) you re Polish or you are Jewish or you\nare, for example, French. Was not so, people think was very bad atmosphere. We never had\nbad experience, for example, with French, Jewish, Russian, the same. We was prisoner. We\nexperienced the same problem and that\u2019s the story in concentration camp. Many things I can\npoint out to you about the concentration camp because it was a very brutal moment and\ndepressed. How many times you go do something somebody push you, the SS or kapo. Kapo\nmostly was in our concentration camp was German prisoners, sadist. And some was Jewish too.\nAnd I cannot say the prisoner was something one against the other. In my camp was like I said\nbefore, General Kenaus was killed and all generals, Italian generals who was against Hitler and\nMussolini this time, the group called General (??) people, generals, age 60-70 was treated very,\nvery badly by not only German, by the prisoners, I don\u2019t know why, the people must have died\nthere. Because was something this time I did not understand. In my eye one general was not\nkilled and was very, very bad wounded by one criminals and took a chair and punch the chair\non the head. And each day was terrible. And problem was the Appel. It was the Appel and\nsomebody was missing because died already and where is the body, for example, because on\nAppel we must count the body and live people. That sometimes takes two hours, three hours\nbefore every numbers come together. I hope I can tell you more. Many friends from my town,\nfrom this group, 3,000, died, because there was not enough eat, was not enough medicine. I\nwas very lucky, I got some in hospital. And my father, special, helped many Polish people give\nsome medicine, maybe not help too much and still help some. After war was end some Russian\npeople, in this concentration camp was 5,000 Russian army officers, and this people was stoned\none guy (??) who was very brutal, beat my father once very badly, and this Russian (?) took the\ngun because American army give us the gun. Shoot if you think so somebody 1s, give it to him.\nShoot him. Nobody from Polish group shoot nobody. The Russian a good many, many, many.",
        "A: Beaten for no reason, no reason at all. We go with my father to the Appel Place what we have\ntitle to do and Lagerfuhrer go against us and for no reason punch my father in nose and start\nkicking. I was shocked. What I can do? And my father wake up and said excuse and we go\ntogether and my father and said, listen these people can kick me or anybody can. No reason.",
        "A: My reason for survival I think was the connection with friend who was from beginning help us,\nJan Shienitski because this fellow looked after us. If I have nobody there I am sure I die.\nBesides this I was young, 23, 24 years old. I was good sportsman, my body was built good and\nI was feed good before the uprising. We eat, some people has not food, not enough food or not\ngood food and these people die fast. That was the reason. And besides this reason was my\nmother was, I feel, during my sitting in concentration camp, each evening I prayed to the God,\nif somebody must die, better me because I am alone, not my mother, not my sisters, not my\nfather because my father has obligations to family, my mother obligation to sisters. All time I\npray. After I come back from camp, my mother said each day I prayed to God the same. Let\ntake me, I am the oldest woman and save the children. Probably something helped us.",
        "A: Yeah, that I think. And one thing more in the concentration camp if I can mention you, I was in\nthe revier (?) mean the hospital and my bed was very close to on the other side of the other\nroom was (?). People, die people, after somebody died, the clothes was taking out and the dead\npeople was laying on the floor, they took the other before, dentists take their teeth. And listen,\nbehind the wall maybe couple hundred corpse there and one day was some shooting from the\ntower, one of the tower near the crematorium where I lived was shooting and the bullets go all\nover and we was be killed. Only the corpse of the dead people catch the bullets, not me. And\nwhat happened, next day we check what happened. Some Russian prisoner go to the\nLichencomer mean the morgue, go there and pick up the gold teeth, stealing the gold teeth from\nthe people. And the fellow who was on the watching tower saw him and put the reflector, the\nspot there, and start shooting. And I was very lucky. I was behind this corpse of the dead\npeople.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Not many kinds on the fight. I not fight in my life too much and during the concentration camp\nI fight with fellow the same age like me. This was Russian Communist young officer who all\n(?) said don\u2019t worry, Pole, Poland never be free. Be seventeenth Russian Republic. And I was\nvery patriotic. I said you crazy, you stupid, Poland be free again. And we start fighting. And\neach couple day was the same. And I never fight with other people. I fight with him. And now\nafter so many years my fight was right, Poland is free, Russian Communists is dead.",
        "A: No, I think so. We got much more time, I think so now. I was not prepared for\nthis.....select.....",
        "A: I am glad this going to some museum and special the Holocaust Museum and I be glad it be\nplaced there and this way we know was not only Jewish people killed in Holocaust, was French,\nPolish, Russian, Zigoinen (gypsies) and many others. And many people like me Christian also\nsuffered from the topalistic (?) German fanatic and Russian Communist dictator.",
        "A: 1961.",
        "A: Yes, with two children. And I am glad because so much Polish people suffer and we think we\nmust create for our children better life, not only economically, free country, one of the famous\nfree country and we are glad that we are here. And my father was dreaming going to America\n1914. And going to America by boat from Warsaw to Gdansk and start break war, war fast.",
        "A: Never tried again. We was in American zone. We can stay there. I was part of army and I go\nfor one month to Poland and I come back to border green and was shooting and so on. I go to\nPoland because my sisters and my mother was in Poland and I know I like take from Poland\nthree and bring to United States and go to Germany. Was not possible because my mother said I\nam so weak, I cannot go. My sisters said we stay with mother. I come back to my father, to\nGermany. My father decide if so I go there. And after one year later I go back to Poland and I\nwas fifteen waiting for possibility to go to United States.",
        "A: No, died before I went.",
        "A: In Poland. Yes and I had with my father very good relationship and was very good man and\nboth parents was very devoted parents and was very, very Christians, very good people, very,\nvery honest. I\u2019d be glad if my children has the same opinion of me.",
        "A: He died in Warsaw.",
        "A: Was took by Communists.",
