        "Question: Can do it a little louder, maybe?",
        "Answer: [inaudible] because it gets louder later.",
        "Q: But if you want, you can tell me a little bit about what -- why -- why do you like this\none, or what is it, actually?",
        "A: This is a Chopin concerto, and I grew up in Poland, and Chopin, of course, was of\nPolish origin and I grew up on his music. I -- my background was -- my parents loved\nmusic and they cultivated music in the house, and most of it was classical music, with a\nsprinkling of some new music, not to the extent that today\u2019s music, but for instance,\nGershwin was -- \u201cRhapsody in Blue\u201d came out in 1938 or \u201939, and -- just prior to the\nwar, and we loved it. It was diff -- but -- 1t was different. That was the first time that I\nlistened to Gershwin. And -- but Chopin was just part of my upbringing. Tchaikovsky,\nCacciatore, and Rachmaninoff, very romantic.",
        "Q: Okay, good. That was -- that was nice, very romantic, that was nice. Good. Okay, let\nme see. Let\u2019s not make it extremely formal, let\u2019s just go right to the difficult subject\nmatter. Tell me -- us a little bit more about the time either just prior to liberation, or the\nmoment of liberation. What -- what happened, what -- what -- wh -- who were you,\nwhere were you, what kind of state were you in, what -- what was that?",
        "A: Well, prior to the liberation we were in barrack. We were --\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, yeah, could we -- could we do that again? There was the [indecipherable].\nI have to find a way of holding the microphone.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: So at [indecipherable] prior -- prior --",
        "A: Prior?",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see, it\u2019s the little -- let me see.",
        "A: Prior?",
        "Q: Yeah, that\u2019s better.",
        "A: Prior to the liberation, we were locked in a barracks and the windows were shut and\nthey were supposed -- supposedly trying to kill us, but there was not enough time, they\nhad to escape because the Russian forces closed. And the sight through the locked\nshutters, we could see that the towers were empty, and the SS was gone. And this was the\nmoment that we realized that they abandoned us. And that was April the 26\", I believe, of\n1945. Since I was badly hurt, my friends were holding me, and broke the doors and ran to\nthe kitchen, brought some margarine. We stuffed ourselves with the margarine, and we\ndecided to leave the camp. Went across the street, there was the house that the\ncommandant used to live, with the garden. There were several of us, one girl had her\nmother with, and somebody brought two eggs and two potatoes, and at that moment the\ncommandant came back with a gun. And we were frozen stiff looking at him. And the\npoignant part was that he was afraid of us. And he disappeared. And we decided to leave.\nMarch 16, 2001\nMy friends were helping me. We went through the fields, there was a great deal of\nfirework -- not firework, fire stemming from the war. They were being bombarded, and\nwe ran. We joined with two Polish men who worked there in the fields. We reached the\nfront line and first -- we saw the first Russian, and this was the -- suppose our liberation -\n- supposed liberation. Pretty soon we discovered that this was not the freedom that we\nwere dreaming of. Freedom was very different. We thought of the normal -- normal life\nthat will come of finding the family. It was very difficult period of time.",
        "Q: Could you -- could you say a little bit more about sort of the first impressions of the --\nthe liberators that you had? What was the condition at the -- at the fe -- you -- you went to\nthe actual front line?",
        "A: Yes. It was actual front line because the war was still going on and the shooting was\non both sides. As a matter of fact, one of the girls was hit. We just didn\u2019t have time to\nlook, we were running like an animal. The first Russian was of Asiatic origin because his\nface, the features were Asiatic. And he was very dirty, I remember his big, black leather\nboots, filthy uniform. He was the liberator, and we thought we should kiss his boots. He\ntold us -- he motioned to us to go back, and the Russians gave us help. The help consisted\nof a barrel of herring. And we ate the herring, and of course the -- we be-became very\nthirsty, there was no water, the pipes were broken. And they told us to leave, my friends\nheld me. We reached the first house in the village, the roof was gone from the\nbombardments. We went to the basement, the basement was very well prepared with food\nMarch 16, 2001\nand sleeping equipment. We lay down -- we ate, we lay down, and the very same night,\ntwo Russians came, and raped two girls. So --",
        "Q: I want -- I want to ask you --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: -- something else before we -- we go on. Did you get any medical attention? Say a\nlittle bit more about th-the shape that you were in. You said you were badly hurt, but --",
        "A: I was --",
        "Q: -- did you get medical attention, anything?",
        "A: Well, you have to understand the circumstances, the Russians were fighting, 1t was\njust unbelievable. I didn\u2019t see anything there of -- of nor-normal food ration, or even\n[indecipherable] Red -- Red Cross. But they had some bandages and they gave me the\nbandages and I was bandaged around my body to hold my ribs. That\u2019s all I remember.\nAnd when -- once we went to the basement, 1t was some sort of a trapdoor going down,\nwhich I wasn\u2019t familiar with before. We went to the basement and one of the Russians\nwas drunk. Wi -- he started to shoot at the jars which were lined on the shelves, and the\npieces of -- pieces of the glass embedded in my left leg, and I was lying down on one of\nthe two cots, and I ask one of the Polish men, please protect me. I -- when the times will\nbe normal, I will give you -- my -- my mother, my family will give you anything in the\nworld if you will help me. He covered me, and he sat down on me. And I was lying there\nand my leg was bleeding, but I didn\u2019t make a sound. That was the night that two girls --\nMarch 16, 2001\none was taken out, one was -- they blew the candle out and they raped her, and the other\none came bloody back. This was my liberation. Very bitter. We wondered if this is -- 1-1f\nthis was worth it, to survive to see this. The next day we left for the village, to another\nhouse.",
        "Q: You -- you stayed -- you stayed in that village for a little while --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and you met other people there, and there were other episodes, but y -- it was -- it\nwas still a dangerous, difficult situation. But did you experience any sense of -- of -- you\nhad a little bit to eat, you had two Polish protectors, 1f you will. Did you experience any\nsense of -- of -- of freedom yet?",
        "A: No. The freedom was very bleak. I was petrified of the Russians now. So, after a\ncouple of days, next house to ours was occupied by the former French prisoners of war.\nAnd I talked the them and they decided that they will take me to their house and protect\nme, and I stayed with them for quite awhile.",
        "Q: Now, after awhile then, things changed, people started moving back to their native\ncountries. Did you go to -- well is -- let me not ask as -- as such a question, what -- what\nhappened after awhile then?",
        "A: Well naturally, I thought that my family survived. I was unaware that everybody was\nkilled. So I wanted -- my first thought was going back to Poland. And there were some\nPolish people with some sort of equipment that they were going towards Poland and they\nMarch 16, 2001\nhad carts, and they took me -- they had Polish flag, and we went through Lignitz, I\nremember, and then -- the names escape me, but I know that we were in Lignitz, and we\nwere in another city big, and that city was already organized, and people already had\nration cards, and we slept in a place that we were assigned to. But I still wanted to go to\nmy native city, and there was -- there was a train already, on one of the tracks, and I went\nwith this train to Warsaw. And in Warsaw I got off the train, of course everything was\nwithout money and no possessions. A human being is very strong, unbelievably strong.\nAnd in Warsaw, I was just standing there with nothing and I saw a man with a s -- truck,\nand I ask him where he 1s going and he said he is going to L\u00e9dz, which was my city. And\nI ask him if he will take me, and he agreed. And that\u2019s how I reached it. Warsaw was\ncompletely destroyed. There was -- I -- I had uncle and aunt, but I couldn\u2019t find the\nstreets. Everything was in ruins. So I was very glad that I was getting the ride, without\nmoney, which I didn\u2019t have. He went -- we stopped in Lublin, I believe and he went out\nto eat and he left me in the car. And he came back, I think he brought a piece of bread,\nbut I\u2019m not too sure. I was hungry. We reached L\u00e9dz and -- of course, L6dz was not\ndestroyed because it was occupied very quickly. And I tried to go to the place that we\nlived. I was not let in. The Polish people occupied our place.",
        "Q: Could you -- could you be a little more specific about that? You lived in a certain\nStreet --",
        "A: Yes.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: -- and the house was still there?",
        "A: All the houses on our street were absolutely in perfect condition, because L6dz was\noccupied by the Germans, I believe on September sixth, maybe fifth of 1939. So the city\nhad only the first day of bombing and it was not destroyed. And our house was standing,\nand the so-called superintendent was still the same one. And when he saw me, he thought\nthat he -- that he saw a ghost. He said in Polish, how come I survived, why did I come\nback. This was the greeting I have -- received. When I wanted to go upstairs to our place,\nour apartment, the L\u00e9dz place, the people wouldn\u2019t let me in. And I went down and the\nsuper said that the Germans own -- took everything out. The carpets, and whatever there\nwas there, they took it out. So I went to -- two streets further. There was a -- some sort of\na bureau that had information, people who came were putting down their names. And I\nlooked through their list --",
        "Q: Was it HIAS?",
        "A: I am not too sure if this was HIAS. Something to do with displaced person\norganization, but I -- I don\u2019t remember. And I don\u2019t want to say something that I\u2019m not\nabsolutely sure. And I looked for the names, there were no familiar names with the\nexception of one, which was my girlfriend. And my girlfriend survived in L\u00e9dz in hiding\nwith -- with her husband. Her address was there, and I went to her. And I stayed with her\nfor couple of weeks, and I decided since Poland didn\u2019t want me, I don\u2019t want Poland.\nAnd I decided to go back west.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: Could you s -- so nobody from your entire family survived, at least at that time you --\nthat\u2019s what you knew.",
        "A: At that time I -- I didn\u2019t think anybody survived.",
        "Q: Say a little bit more about your decision to -- your feelings about Poland and about\nwanting to leave it. A little bit.",
        "A: My feeling about Poland was very bitter. The Germans started the war, the Germans\nwere the enemy. However, Poles were my countrymen. I grew up there, I loved the\nlanguage. I loved the literature. I was, you may say patriotic. I had Polish girlfriends, and\nI thought on coming back that I will meet some people. I -- I was bitterly disappointed.\nThat stems already from before, because when the war started, my friends didn\u2019t come to\nsee me. They could have in the beginning, before we went to the ghetto. But not having\nfamily left, and not wanting to contact any of my Polish ex-friends, my -- my idea was to\nleave Poland forever and ever. I didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with Poland.",
        "Q: So you made your way, with a friend, to Berlin.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember how long -- oh, do you remember, by the way, how long, roughly,\nit took you to get from the place you were liberated -- that was Ravensbrick, was it?",
        "A: I-I was liberated in Bittenberg.",
        "Q: In Bittenberg, of course, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: I was in Ravensbrick prior to it.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: Yes, yes, 1-in Bittenberg. How long did it take you on foot, on horse cart to get to\nLodz, that\u2019s such a --",
        "A: Well, no, we -- we went to Lignitz first from Bittenberg, that was not that far. From\nLignitz we had a train to Warsaw. From Warsaw I was in that truck to L\u00e9dz. I cannot\ntell you exactly the frame of time that this occurred, but after two weeks being in L\u00e9dz,\nand my friend was with her husband, and I -- I just didn\u2019t feel welcome. My po -- my\nPoland was not my Poland any more. I wrote -- I wrote a poem about it here in the\nStates, that the fatherland didn\u2019t love me. So I flaunted. I don\u2019t want them any more.\nAnd I decided to move to Berlin because I was told that they had displaced person\ncamps, run by the allied forces, and I thought maybe somebody survived there.",
        "Q: So you made your way to Berlin -- you don\u2019t have to go into -- into the story,\nalthough it is an interesting one, but for this purpose -- and sen -- so you arrived in\nBerlin, what was it like? What was Berlin like? What did you see when you arrived?\nWhat happened?",
        "A: It was very strange. We came -- we came with -- previously I told this story, that the\nRussian smuggled us to his cr -- train compartment, and we arrived in Berlin and he let\nus off at the station, and we were standing there, and sort of sizing people. And we saw\ntwo people, two young men who didn\u2019t look -- appear to be Jewish, and we approached\nthem and we asked them, and they said yes. And they gave us some fare in fennix, I\ndon\u2019t remember how much. And they put us on bus and they told us to get off ha -- was\nMarch 16, 2001\nthis Rickenstrasser, I don\u2019t remember the first camp before Schlactensee. This was the\nvery first one, it was in the Russian sector.",
        "Q: You mentioned in the last interview, you said Oranienstrasse.",
        "A: Oranien -- oran -- I don\u2019t remember the name. I don\u2019t remember. But this was the\nvery first camp, displaced person camp. And I was grateful for the help, but I didn\u2019t want\nthis type of -- I wanted privacy.",
        "Q: But what -- what did -- what -- what did it look like, what -- what happened there?\nWhat -- what --",
        "A: We were given places to sleep, we were given food, and I don\u2019t remember too much\nabout it, maybe because I\u2019m getting older, mi -- things are sort of slowly blending and\ndisappearing. I\u2019m trying to remember the good things, and I\u2019m trying to, maybe\nsubconsciously forget the sad things. Maybe this helped me to live. The camp provide us\nwith vital things that we needed to live. The two of us, my girlfriend and I, didn\u2019t feel\ncomfortable. We wanted some sort of a more normal life, so we were given a room by a\nGerman war widow. I still remember her name, Frau Beans. And she [indecipherable]\nand we were give a room, it was -- it was cold, I remember. We had a little stove in the\nmiddle of the floor that we made of coal or anthracite, to warm up. And we were given\nration cards, and some Russians started to come to visit this aunt, and this -- and -- and\nthe woman and her aunt, because they -- they -- they were given some food from the\nRussians. What did they do, I have no idea. We were very unhappy about that situation.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t normal.",
        "Q: What was normal? What -- what did you want? What is it that you wanted, that you\nmost needed? You were given the [indecipherable]",
        "A: I wanted warmth, I wanted --",
        "Q: Could you -- could you say that again?",
        "A: -- I wanted warmth. I wanted the -- the personal life, not to be in somebody\u2019s room\nand behave and -- and make that piece of bread on this little stove, heat it up, and go for\nthe ration with the card and stand on a line. I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t expect my freedom to be of\nthat sort. I -- I wanted to disassociate myself with all this. It was very bitter. To top this\nall, I saw in this German house, a Menorah, which her husband, who was killed in the\nwar, sent her from one of the occupied countries. The woman had no idea what it was,\nbut I saw a silver Menorah, and this broke my heart. After that, we had a little incident,\nwe went to a movie house, which I described before. I did not want to stay in the Russian\nsector at all. My friend was a little bit enterprising, she got herself a boyfriend. I was\npetrified of everybody and everything. I just wanted to run away to American sector. And\nI went to the -- I think this was the Jewish HIAS, some Jewish committee in Cheplin,\nand I told him that I wanted to move, and he says I have to be registered. So I got from\nthe -- from that organization some coffee Bonne caf\u00e9, and the Germans were crazy about\nBonne caf\u00e9, so I took this Bonne caf\u00e9 and I went to the German police station -- I really -\nMarch 16, 2001\n- | -- I\u2019m wondering now how -- how I could have done this, because I wasn\u2019t well. And I\nasked the policeman if he would -- because everything, it was very organized already,\nyou had to be registered, and live in this place, or this place. And I wanted desperately to\nleave the Russian sector and be in the American sector.",
        "Q: Why specifically the American sector?",
        "A: Not specifically American, could have been English, or -- but I had some sort of\nrelatives in America, so I felt that this would be maybe the closest. And that\u2019s what I was\nadvised also by that Joint, or HIAS. And I gave him the Bonne caf\u00e9, the German\npoliceman took it, and put my name on list, and I got the room by Frau Pegiloft, town of\nStrasse [indecipherable]. And Frau Pegiloft was a very old lady who at night locked\nher room because she was afraid of me. But after couple of weeks she warmed up to me,\nand I said, Frau Pegiloft -- because I could speak German, Frau Pegiloft, how was this\nthe -- she said, \u201cAh, kvotch. I am the only Nazi left,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a Nazi, they all\nwere Nazis. But now nobody says he was a Nazi and I\u2019m the only one. I\u2019m old, I don\u2019t\ncare any more.\u201d So I stayed with Frau Pegiloft until the -- I received avonderong papers\n-- that means the paper to go to -- I think 1t was Bremenhaven.",
        "Q: Did you not stay a little while in -- in Schlactensee, and -- and --",
        "A: Oh, excuse me.",
        "Q: That\u2019s all right. Let\u2019s --\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Excuse me. Yes, I was -- before Frau Pegiloft, I was in Schlactensee, you\u2019 re right.\nThe policeman registered me in amer -- amer -- American sector and I went to\nSchlactensee. And I was in Schlactensee very short time, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t remember. I\ndid -- I was not happy in Schlactensee. It --",
        "Q: What -- what was it? What was Schlactensee [indecipherable |",
        "A: Schlactensee was again, they give you the basics.",
        "Q: No, I mean, you -- you should -- you should say that it was di -- display --",
        "A: It was a -- Schlactensee was a displaced person camp. And they had a lot of people\nalready and people were very enterprising, they were used to the conditions, they had\nfriends, they were going to Poland, they were bringing goods back and forth to Breslau,\nand Brotswaf. I could not partake in any of this, and all to me was very strange. I\ncouldn\u2019t eat the way people were buying something, sitting at a table and talking about\nbusiness. I was lost. I didn\u2019t feel good, I wanted to be in an -- in a room of my own, I\nwanted privacy. And that\u2019s why I left Schlactensee. I went back to that police, and at that\ntime I was getting, every month, some sort of ration from the Jewish committee. Coffee,\nsome cigarettes, sometimes they had, sometimes they didn\u2019t have it. But whatever I had, I\nswapped with this policeman, and I got the room by Frau Pegiloft. That\u2019s how\n[indecipherable] Schlactensee. Pr-Proud to it. But a very short time, Schlactensee.",
        "Q: And then eventually though, you did --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nMarch 16, 2001\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: And then eventually though, you did think about emigration. Say a little bit about that,\nhow -- what -- what your thoughts were and where you decided you would have to go.",
        "A: Well, at this time Israel was not an Israel yet, it was Palestine. I was -- my health\nwas precarious to say the least. I was slowly healing. I did not feel that I -- I was not\nreally brought up as a Zionist. I had the deep feeling, I still do, but I didn\u2019t think that I\nwould fit in that surrounding. I was unable to work. People had to work physically\nstarting Israel, to build the country. My thoughts were about United States because I\nknew that I had some sort of relatives here. And that fact was brought to my attention by\nthe chaplain, and one sergeant in the American army, in that Jewish committee. And they\nasked me for the name, and I said the name is Posalski, and after a few months I received\na letter from Detroit and the name was changed from Posalski to Soles, and they located\nthem. And this was my grand -- maternal grandmother\u2019s sister, and there was a half-\nbrother in New Jersey. And that family sponsored me to come to the United States.",
        "Q: What -- what do you -- when did you leave -- so you left from Bremenhaven, I guess,\nwhen did you leave, and what do you remember about the boat trip?",
        "A: The boat trip was a nightmare. I wanted to die right on that boat. Strange. I was\nliberated, I was free, I was coming to the best country in the world. We were on Marine\nMarlin, this was an troop transporter. We were put down -- the people -- the displaced\nperson people were -- having visas, they were sponsored, were put at the bottom of the\nMarch 16, 2001\nboat. The top of the boat, the better deck, was reserved for German war brides. So there\nwas another injustice done to us. We encountered very, very powerful storms, and our\nboat lost part of the bow. It was unbelievable, that trip. I don\u2019t know what harm came to\nthe boat, but I know that even the crew was sick. I was getting -- I was getting injections\nbecause I couldn\u2019t eat. I was throwing up constantly, and it took us -- I don\u2019t remember\nexactly, maybe 15 or 16 days on the boat to finally reach New York. So the freedom was\n-- it was something that I dreamt about, hoped for, envisioned, and it was so different and\nso bleak and so heartbreaking, that on that ship I said, I survived so many years under the\nGerman rule, concentration camps, I lost my family, I\u2019m going to die in the middle of 0 --\nthe ocean. It\u2019s ironic. But I didn\u2019t. I reached New York, and I was met by --",
        "Q: How -- say --",
        "A: -- some family member.",
        "Q: Say -- say -- that was a very -- in the last interview, a very moving way you described\nthat when you arrived, what -- what -- what happened then. This whole thing --",
        "A: Well, when we arrived, and we left the boat -- and we didn\u2019t go to Ellis Island, we\nwent to a pier -- there were benches, long benches and there were letters above,\nalphabetically, A-B-C and they told us to go to a letter that was corresponding with your\nlast name. Since my name was Fisher, I went to letter F, and I was sitting there. And\npeople were coming and picking up their relatives or friends. And I was sitting and sitting\nand sitting. And finally I saw a gentleman, a very distinguished looking gentleman\nMarch 16, 2001\nwalking by with a photo, showing that picture. And when I looked at the picture, I said,\nin Polish, \u201cThis is my grandmother.\u201d So he knew that he found the right person. He was\nmy grandmother\u2019s half-brother\u2019s son-in-law. He was an attorney in New Jersey. The\npeople from Detroit couldn\u2019t come to pick me up, because that day that our ship finally\ndocked, my grandmother\u2019s sister died, on the very same day. And they had funeral to\nattend to. So they wired or called the people in New Jersey, and they -- that half-brother\nof my grandmother, and this son-in-law came to pick me up. And we could not talk to\neach other. My -- my cousin, so-called cousin, was a very bright, educated man, but he\nspoke only English. I said German? No. Polish? No. French? No. Okay. Come. And I\nfollowed him, and there I saw this gentleman, gray haired with pink cheeks and the bluest\neyes. And I saw my grandmother\u2019s face, and that was my grandmother\u2019s brother, and he\nspoke still some Polish and German. And I went with them. I remember the ride in the\ncar, alongside the west side highway, and I saw all these lights at night, snake lights, like.\nAnd the Hudson River, and we came to the bridge, huge bridge, which was George\nWashington bridge. We crossed the bridge. I was sitting with my uncle -- great-uncle,\nand we reached his place in Patterson, New Jersey, it was Patterson. And his wife also\nspoke Polish and German and was the most wonderful, wonderful lady, who made me\nfeel good, warm. She hugged me, she kissed me, and that\u2019s what I needed. That\u2019s what I\nneeded, I didn\u2019t need any material things, I just wanted to be loved, to -- to belong. And\nthat was the beginning.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: But then eventually, you also visited the other relatives in -- in Detroit.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Could you say a little bit about that experience, what happened?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well, since I was sponsored by the people in Detroit, and the funeral\npostponed my going there, they communicated with this family that I should stay there\nfor two weeks and come to Detroit. They send a ticket for a train, and I was put in a train\nin a very nice car. I remember that I had to -- a very nice chair facing the window, so it\nmust have been first class, I guess. And they told the black attendant, a very nice man, to\ntake care of me with food and so forth, because I couldn\u2019t speak English. And he really\ntook care of me. It was a long trip. And I was dressed very decently, because before I left\nGermany, all my accumulated coffee that I still had, I exchanged for a nice coat. It was\nwith fur, I remember. And a scarf. And I looked decent, fairly decent. And when I arrived\nin Detroit, the people at the station were mighty surprised. I don\u2019t know what they\nexpected, but they thought that this will come somebody from beyond the moon. Well, I -\n- sure, I didn\u2019t speak English, but I had brains. And I looked all right, because I -- I had\nthe rations already in Germany to eat, and I had that couple of weeks with my aunt --\ngreat-aunt and uncle. They fed me and they -- they were very, very nice to me. And I\nspent some time with the people in Detroit. The parents were nice, but their daughter was\n-- | must say she was cruel to me, because I took away the limelight away from her. And\nI again was unhappy. So it was decided that I will move to another brother they had. The\nMarch 16, 2001\nbrother was an old bachelor, who must have been at that time in his 60\u2019s, and I was in my\nearly 20\u2019s, and they thought that I should marry him. So I -- I went to a Polish part of\ntown in -- in Detroit, that is Polish. And I got myself a little job working on camera\ncases, and I -- I think I was paid 18 dollars a week, maybe 20, I don\u2019t remember exactly.\nAnd I saved the money. They didn\u2019t like that I got the job, because its -- it hurt their\npride. But I couldn\u2019t walk around without penny in my pocket and -- and if I would want\nto spend five cents I would have to ask for it. I wanted to be independent. So I got this\nmoney and I saved -- they didn\u2019t want money from me. So I saved for the trip back to\nNew York. And --",
        "Q: Did -- did -- did they ask you where you -- what happened to you? Did they have any\nunderstanding of where you\u2019d come from?",
        "A: Well, as a matter of fact, yes. I was learning English rapidly. I went at night to a night\nschool, and they have classes for -- m-m-most of the people at night were people who\nworked here for many, many years, they did not have time to learn the language properly.\nSo I learned very quickly, and I wanted to lead a normal, independent life. I didn\u2019t want\nto be dependent on every -- anybody. And I didn\u2019t want to stay with them. And the idea\nof marrying this old man was just horrific. So I wanted to leave.",
        "Q: Did you get any medical attention when you were --\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Yes, they took me to a doctor once, and th-there were several things wrong with me,\nbut unfortunately they didn\u2019t have that type of help for the spine as they have nowadays,\nso nothing could be done.",
        "Q: What was -- what was wrong?",
        "A: I had -- some ribs were damaged, broken, and the spine s -- 1t didn\u2019t show when I was\nclothed, in clothes, but when I was undressed you could see sticking parts of -- and I was\nvery self-conscious about it. No, I didn\u2019t get the proper medical care. If I would have\ngotten -- if they would have put me in corset in those days -- but I guess that compassion\nis one thing, and money is another. And maybe it would be costly. No, I didn\u2019t have\nproper care. And I came back to New York and went back to the great-uncle and great-\naunt. I took a course, three months course to become a baby nurse, newborn babies. And\nthen I was recommended from one family to another, and became great friends with all\nthe families. I -- I have three babies that I took care of, that they are three doctors now. A\nlong time already. So it -- it -- it -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s unbelievab -- I\u2019m talking\nabout my own life, but this is -- seems to me that it\u2019s some sort of a strange book.",
        "Q: So you earn -- begin to earn your first and earn your own money, how did that feel?",
        "A: Oh, it was wonderful because when I got my first check, I gave it to my great-aunt,\nand I said, this -- this -- this is the sweetest day that I can help you for all you have done\nfor me. Now, she didn\u2019t have to depend on my money because she had three daughters,\nand all three were married well, they were all educated. And -- but I felt independent, I\nMarch 16, 2001\npaid. And we spent many hours sitting in the kitchen, she was an elderly lady. Now that\nI\u2019m elderly myself -- we were sitting -- she was sitting making her homemade noodles,\nhomemade, and cutting them. And she said, \u201cWell, when you are old you have to sit then\nyou do these things.\u201d So the little things that I remember with great li -- forgot this word,\nbut this is such wonderful feeling I have when I think of her, the -- the compassion that\nshe showed me, and the -- the warmth. I -- I felt that I belonged. And all the people that I\nworked for became my friends. I loved them all, and I hope I was loved there, too. So I\nwas independent of this family in Detroit.",
        "Q: Did you talk much about your experience, di -- what happened? Did you feel that\npeople wanted to know, were ready to hear? What was sort of the situation there?",
        "A: In the very beginning it was very strange. Some people didn\u2019t believe that this was\npossible, some people didn\u2019t want to hear, and I decided for awhile I won\u2019t be talking\nabout it. I didn\u2019t want to scare people away from me, because I thought, they don\u2019t want\nto be surrounded by sadness and a teary story. But as I accomplished my -- my goal, and\nimproved my English, I decided that my mission was to survive in order to tell the people\nas much as I can, wherever they will listen to me. Because thing -- such a thing as\nHolocaust, it was of gigantic proportions. It never happened to this extent and it has to be\ntold. And that\u2019s what we promised each other, my family. And I was the one that was\nleft. So it will -- became my goal.",
        "Q: In the early years, ho -- did you feel that people viewed you any certain way?\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Yes. There were two kinds of people. There were people who felt that by the very\nvirtue of being born here, and living here for many years, for some reason I was sort of\ninferior to them. I disregarded this, because I felt well -- I feel that this is -- I don\u2019t want\nto lower myself to their level. And there were people who were very sympathetic and\nvery loving and I was drawn to these people. So I had to be very careful in the beginning\nnot to overstate my feelings, not to -- I had to be very careful. People were critical of\ncertain European ways, and I could not get used to some of the American ways. We ate\ndifferently, we -- we -- we behaved, very often, differently, but I didn\u2019t dare to say it. I\nkept this to myself. It\u2019s very unimportant, because each culture has its own way of\ndealing with things. And that\u2019s what makes us different and that\u2019s -- an intelligent person\ncan or -- adapt or learn from each other, or disregard. It\u2019s not important. These are --\nthese are very secondary issues, because after all, we are all human beings. If we try, we\ncan get along, if we\u2019ll only try. And that is one of the issues that I approach when I speak.",
        "Q: Do you think that people looked at -- at a displaced person in a certain way?",
        "A: In the beginning, yes.",
        "Q: Cou-Could you say that in a sentence? Not -- I ask you the question, but could you\nmake that into a sentence? You should maybe tell your husband not to [indecipherable].\nI want to ask you now about what sort of -- so you wa -- you -- you were back in New\nYork, or New Jersey, you had t -- you had a n-new job, you began to feel a little bit\nMarch 16, 2001\nmore comfortable, you had some money. What was sort of the goal, what was it that you\nwanted next?",
        "A: What I wanted next was to have a child. I wanted to have a -- as I said this -- and you\nwill see this on -- hear this on the tape, that I wanted to show Hitler that the seed\nsurvived. And I wanted a child the worst way. It was very unconventional those days to\nhave a child without a husband. I got married to a man who is a very nice man. But this\nwould not have been my choice if the times would have been normal. We are very\ndifferent people, intellectually. And we are both honest, we both are of the same religion,\nwe are both very honest, we are both civically minded people. And we both love music --\ndifferent kinds of music, but music. But we are very different. I needed more stimull,\nwhich I couldn\u2019t get from my husband.",
        "Q: Intellectual stimulus?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Cou -- could you say it?",
        "A: I needed more intellectual stimulus. I tried to find this in reading, I became voracious\nreader. Financially I was not in position to -- to do things that I would have liked to. I\nwould have liked to go to a good university. I thought that I had enough brain to do it, but\nmy health was precarious. I got married and I immediately, the next month, I got\npregnant. I wanted it, and I was afraid that I won\u2019t be able to because I didn\u2019t menstruate\nMarch 16, 2001\nfor about four years in camps. But I was fortunate enough, and I wanted a daughter,\nbecause I always felt that the daughter will be close, closer than a son. So I was lucky.",
        "Q: Did a doctor s -- t-tell -- say that -- mention it again that the doctor -- you got medical\nadvice and you were basically advised not to have a child.",
        "A: The doctors told me that 1t would worsen my condition, 1t would throw me off. But I\nfelt that it was worth it. The -- if you put this on a scale, there was no comparison, I\nwanted a child. And it was worth it, and it worked out beautifully, because I do have a\ndaughter who is very close to me. We are very fortunate. We nourish each other. And she\nhas a daughter, and she has -- this is perpetuating. She has the same -- the same\nrelationship with her daughter. She has a husband who 1s British, and he was very\nreserved when she -- he got married, but he sort of softened by our surrounding love. He\nbecame a ver -- much more relaxed. He\u2019s still reserved, but not to the extent that he was\nbefore. He calls me Mom, I\u2019m very happy about it. Most of all, I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s a\nwonderful husband to my daughter, and wonderful father to his child.",
        "Q: When was your daughter born, what is her name, and how did you feel when you\u2019 ve --\nwhen you got a daughter, how was that?",
        "A: My daughter was born on March 22\", 1951 and her 50\" birthday is coming up. And\nI'll be there next week, and so will be my granddaughter, she will be flying. From the\nvery beginning on, my entire life centered around this child. I lived on a fourth floor\nwalk-up apartment in the Bronx. I had only one bedroom, and the bedroom belonged to\nMarch 16, 2001\nher. We had a [indecipherable] in the living room. I tried to dress her the best I could. I\ntried to read stories, sing songs, teach her, expose her to music. I -- I delighted in bringing\nher up. It was my -- my life changed. I was very grateful. And I acquired friends. We\ndecided to form groups. I belonged to a -- a book reading club. Friends who shared\ninterests with me.",
        "Q: You -- did you have s-survivor friends, or di -- s-say a little bit more about the kinds\nof friends you had, or w-was it -- s-say --",
        "A: No, no, no, strangely enough, I lived in the building that I was the only survivor and I\nformed friendships with my neighbors. This was 1950 - ?51, you have to understand that\nit -- the conditions were absolutely different, it was safe. When the baby was born, I used\nto -- it was hot, we didn\u2019t have air conditioning. New York can be very cruel in the\nsummer. The humidity. So we used to go downstairs, the carriage was in the basement\nand we walked to the park at night, nobody was afraid. It was a local park. And all the\nother mothers with their babies were there, and we\u2019re -- we\u2019re sitting at night, not being\nafraid. So we formed very close friendships. Not one of my friends there was a survivor,\nstrangely enough. One was Italian, Connie, adorable. And three others were Jewish. We\nplayed Mah Jong, I remember. I learned how to play Mah Jong tho-those days. And\nthen in the summer, when my husband started to make a little bit more, in the summer we\nwere leaving New York for the country. We used to rent a room. And the husbands were\n-- my friends to my -- the husbands were coming on a weekend. So that ch --\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: Wh-What was your -- what was your husband doing as -- as a job, what did he --",
        "A: My husband worked as a inspector first. He -- he -- he had -- he went to University of\nRochester, but he did not have his actual degree in engineering, so he worked for\nGeneral Dynamics for many years. They went bankrupt, that part that he worked for, so\nhe switched to a smaller place, I believe Sequential. And then he was hired by Union\nCarbide. And he worked in Union Carbide for six years, until his heart -- he had a small\nheart attack and I told him I don\u2019t want him to work any more. I don\u2019t need the money, I\ncan live -- I saw worse things. Money was not everything, so I talked him into retiring.",
        "Q: So he was an engineer of sorts, though?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And say a little bit more about life in New York, then. You didn\u2019t have that much\nmoney but you were not unhappy.",
        "A: No, I was not unhappy because I had friends who were in the same circumstances. If\nyou don\u2019t have much, and your friends don\u2019t have much, you -- you\u2019re not unhappy. You\nhave food, you have clothes, you -- w-we were going -- as a matter of fact we were --\nwhen we played once a week, we -- we used to -- but I don\u2019t remember, 50 cents, or 75\ncents on a side. When we had enough money, all the couples went to the theater, because\nwe loved theater. So we packed two cars, and we went out. And when there was enough\nmoney we went to Lindy\u2019s for cheesecake, too. And I\u2019ve -- later on I found especially\none friend that she had my interest in museums, and we used to go to Metropolitan\nMarch 16, 2001\nMuseum of Art twice a month, and became members.

        "Q: You also went to libraries, I [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh yes, the library was part of my -- my learning process. I learned a -- a really -- in\nthe beginning by myself, sufficiently to be understood, and I took great care to be correct,\nto be fairly articulate. And I couldn\u2019t get rid of my accent, which the American people\nafter awhile, they saw that I spoke well, they -- they -- they were changing.

You talked a little bit about -- already about -- about education and you want her\nto have a cultural background, she liked music, or something, but how did you think in\nterms of education, values that you wanted to --",
        "A: Well, values -- the -- the morals and ethics you teach the child from the beginning.\nAbout education, I felt that in -- I\u2019m not going to push her in one direction. I want her to\npursue her own road to the -- the kind of education that she wants. She wanted to study\nShakespeare. My husband used to laugh, he said, \u201cWhat do you want to do with\nShakespeare?\u201d He said, \u201cHow about a little typing on the side?\u201d And she said, \u201cBut I\nlove it.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, she loves it, so she has to do it, she has to be happy, to do what\nshe likes to do.\u201d And once she was in high school, she went for a Junior year abroad to\nEngland. And that, of course, changed her life, she became an Anglophile. And she want\n-- she dreamt about going to graduate school for her masters in England. And we sent\nher to England, to Shakespearean Institute. And whatever you learn, it\u2019s your gain. It\u2019s a\nwonderful thing. And --",
        "Q: Was -- was that difficult, to let her go?",
        "A: It was difficult, but I had again to outweigh my personal feeling for her happiness. She\nchose this path, she wanted, and this was the best school. Once she was accepted, to me\nthis was an omen, she has to go. And she went and she loved it, and she graduated. She\nMarch 16, 2001\nhas masters in English lit -- literature.

        "Q: Did you talk to her about -- about your experience? How did you impart -- how did\nshe get to know about that? How\u2019d -- how was that handled in your family?",
        "A: She always knew that I was a survivor. Her father was not, her fa -- father lived here\nthrough -- through the war. But I was a survivor and I never made secret out of it. I did\nnot tell her in the details, the gory details of what went through, but I wanted her to know\nbecause this was the legacy. She was entitled to know where her mother came from, my\nbackground, I wanted her to be proud of it, and what she is. At the same token, she\nresented the people who caused my I -- my affliction, my being disabled as a result of the\ntremendous beatings that I was getting. She could not ga -- accept it. And I tried to\ntemper her dislike -- more than dislike, her hatred, into -- it was very diplomatic, into\nunderstanding that people are people. There were people who were good. And we -- she\nwent to the museum, she saw how many people saved people, at the risk of their own\nimprisonment or even losing their lives. I myself was surprised to see many Polish names\non the wall of the museum. I was not aware that that many Polish people helped, I really\nwasn\u2019t.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "Q: Which museum?",
        "A: The Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.. I was surprised. I knew about the\nDanes at that time. My surprise was complete when I first pers -- once only, I went to\nIsrael to visit Yad Vashem, and I saw that street of the Righteous Gentiles, and I -- I just\nbroke down, because this was a very revealing thing to me, and being aware of the\ngoodness of some people. People who did not lose their humanity, who -- who are giants.\nBecause everybody now has to say to himself, how would I act under these\ncircumstances? Could I have done it? Could I have hidden people at the risk of my life?\nThere was one 17 year old girl. 17 year old girl who had 13 Jews hidden in her house,\nand they all survived. So this is -- this -- this is heroism -- heroism, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s wonderful. So this is always what I point out, the -- the bad and the good.",
        "Q: All right, let\u2019s go back to Israel. When did you go to Israel and what was the\nexperience like? What -- what did it mean to you?",
        "A: I went to Israel, don\u2019t remember the -- the -- the year. It was the year after the Six\nDay War when Jerusalem was returned to Israel. Going to Israel was -- I was not as\nexcited as I maybe should have been, but once I was there, it was the most incredible\nfeeling that occurred when I was at the Wailing Wall. And I am not a very religious\nperson. I -- my husband has -- had a sister who passed away. She left for Palestine when\nshe was a youngster, she was in the Zionist movement and she got married, and she really\nworked the soil. She was a real sabra. Her children were born there, her grandchildren,\nMarch 16, 2001\neverybody was in the army. So we went to visit her. Once we went to Jerusalem, and I\nwent to the wall, and I stood in front of this -- this -- this plain wall, and I touched --\ntouched the stones, something inside me changed. I cannot describe the feeling, it was\nlike the history of the millennia came through my body. I reminded myself that my\ngrandfather had on the wall of his room, some sort of a picture and there was saying, Oh\nJerusalem, if -- can\u2019t quote it. Something about losing a hand. I don\u2019t -- I cannot be\nverbatim, I cannot, but I know that it\u2019s very well known, and I know that existed in many\nhomes. So this came to my mind. Jerusalem, walking the streets, the historical cobbled\nstreets, which led from around the wall, through the 14 station of Jesus were of tremen --\nmade tremendous impact on me, because I walked on history. Jesus did walk there.\nMary Magdalene was there. The Roman soldiers were there. The Hebrews were there,\nand here I am walking there. Tremendous impact. I went to the mosque, to the blue\nmosque. I took my shoes off, I saw the people -- very few people in there. I went\ndownstairs where the rock 1s, and this is allegedly the rock on which Abraham was\nsupposed to sacrifice his son, and God stopped him. I don\u2019t know -- these were legends,\nbut to me this was something that history repeated in all the hundreds and hundreds of\nyears. So I sort of became a little part of the history, touching the whole thing. It made\ntremendous impact on me. Going to Yad Vashem was another story. Going 1n there and\nstanding at the gallery, looking down at the slabs of stone with the names of the camps, I\nbroke down. I thought I am immune to it, that I will not, but I did break down, and I\nMarch 16, 2001\ncried. When I walked out, it was one of these beautiful s-sunny days in Jerusalem, and\nyou\u2019re coming out from this dark chamber of remembrances of the tragedy that human\npeople suffered at human hands. And you go out and there is this street with the trees.\nThe street with the trees of the Righteous Gentiles. The contrast is so startling. It 1s so eye\nopening. I -- I will never forget til the day I die, my feeling when I saw this. At that point\nI was not aware of all the Gentiles who did help. I knew smattering of things, because I\nwas always interested reading the books. I knew about Denmark. I knew about sporadic\nthings, but the names that I\u2019ve seen this, and the trees. The whole idea was so special to\nme that it was the highlight of my trip.",
        "Q: Going back to -- oh -- oh no, let\u2019s actually -- you -- you -- you -- you s-said a little bit\nabout you\u2019re not very religious. Speak a little -- speak a little bit about your relationship\nto Judaism, and about your faith.",
        "A: Well, I grew up in a family that was -- my mother and father were non-observant\nJews. However, the tradition was kept up. We went for all the big holidays to\ngrandparents, who kept th-the -- Judaism alive, and they were religious. They were not\nOrthodox, but they were religious. I will never forget the Seders, the warm feeling of\nbeing with all my family, and with strangers, because we always -- my grandparents\ninvited strangers, this was a tradition, from orphanage, soldiers who were of Jewish\norigin who did not have place to go to. We always had strangers at the table. And th -- we\nwere only two grandchildren there, I was the older one, and mother\u2019s sister boy was the\nMarch 16, 2001\nyounger one. And they had a cook, and a serving maid, and there was a long, long table\nladen with this food, and the people, and the happiness, and the lights, because my\ngrandfather always said let there be a lot of light, 1t\u2019s a holiday. So all the lights in all the\nrooms were on. It was such a wonderful, happy feeling. New Year\u2019s we used to go to the\ntemple to pick up my grandparents because they were going -- my parents didn\u2019t, and we\nalways brought a -- white flowers with us, a bouquet of white flowers, I don\u2019t know why.\nSo the memories and the -- the -- of the tradition were very strong with me. I -- I believe\nin some sort of supreme being, but I couldn\u2019t define it. I did not have Hebrew education,\nneither did my mother. I -- I\u2019m av -- extremely good Jew at heart because I believe in the\ncommandments, and I feel if y -- you don\u2019t have to be Jewish to follow the\ncommandments. And if you follow the commandments, you\u2019re religious. My father\u2019s\nidea was more philoso -- philosophical, he thought that God surrounds us, that God is\neverywhere, in every huma -- 1-in every human, in every living tree, in the nature. And I\nsort of adopted this. However, in camp, I was questioning, where is that supreme being?\nWhere is God? What\u2019s happening? These are human beings who are doing this to other\nhuman beings, therefore, is there a God? The questioning. Long time. I slowly returned to\nthe faith. I\u2019m not a temple goer, but I feel that I am a good Jew because I observe the\ncommandments. I will not steal, I will honor -- unfortunately I don\u2019t have parents, I\u2019m an\nold lady myself. And I tried to bring up my daughter in the spirit, and my daughter did\nnot have Bat Mitzvah, but my granddaughter did. So it\u2019s like coming back. The circle 1s\nMarch 16, 2001\nrepeating. And when I spoke at my granddaughter\u2019s Bat Mitzvah, I did say it, that the\nseed survived after all. To me this was very, very powerful statement. In view that so\nmany members of my family were killed, and I felt that I was the weakest link, and I\nsurvived, and I was able to produce the next pr -- generation. It was very strong feeling,\nand this brought me back to the faith.",

        "A: Definitely. I lived with that sense of guilt all my life. I felt that maybe I wasn\u2019t the one\ndeserving to survive. I -- maybe I wasn\u2019t worth it. There were so many people in the\nfamily who were much more deserving to survive, and I was chosen to be the one. You\nlive with this guilt always. I will never get rid of this guilt. And my daughter tried to get\nthis out of me, but it\u2019s down deep somewhere there, the guilt is there.",
        "Q: Did you feel that you have this -- that you have or had a special obligation in some\nway, then?",
        "A: Definitely. To speak. To leave something behind me. I\u2019m sorry that I did not write a\nbook, but this was such a trend, everybody was writing books. I said maybe by spoken\nMarch 16, 2001\nwords to people, maybe I will reach people by the very virtue of being in flesh in front of\nthem. It was not a book, it was not a page, it was not a printed word, it was me, in flesh.\nAnd I tried to convey this to my listeners, you are looking at a survivor. I was there. You\nwill be able to tell next generation, I spoke and listened to a survivor. To me this was so\nimportant, maybe more than books. Sometimes I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t write, but it\u2019s too late\nfor that, so I have to be satisfied with what I did. I tried my very best.",
        "Q: Wh-When did you start speaking, and was it on your own impetus, or did somebody\nelse urge you to, or --",
        "A: Nobody urged me. I felt -- first of all, the family said, when we saw that we are\ndoomed, that if someone survived, some -- that one should speak. There was no question\nabout it in Poland or Germany, I would not dream about it. In the beginning in the\nStates, my English wasn\u2019t good enough, and it was absolutely negligent, I didn\u2019t speak\nthe language. When I learned and I became fairly fluent in English, the obligation started\nto come back. I said, I promised, I have to start. And I started with some of my friends\nwho were American born, and little by little 1t grew. People listen and they said, oh, you\nknow, we have a group of women, this will be interesting to invite you. And since I live\nin San Diego, | did this for over 20 years here. And I was always recommended. I never\nput my name in the papers that people did. But -- especially the Catholic school. They\ninvited me three times. And I said to the teacher, \u201cBut I\u2019m repeating myself.\u201d They said,\n\u201cWhat do you think we do? We repeating our lessons, but each time 1s a different class,\nMarch 16, 2001\ndifferent people.\u201d So I fulfilled my promise and my obligation, and I never wanted to\nprofit by it. I did this because this is my absolute responsibility to the people who\nperished. And if there are some individuals who do profit by it, \u2019'm sorry they do. \u2019'm\nhappy that they do some good by speaking, but I feel that 1t\u2019s almost unethical to profit\nby it in any way. There is no glory in it, to -- to -- to be invited guest of honor here and\nthere, and -- and have pictures. It -- 1t doesn\u2019t apply to me.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see, I just had a question that I forgot to ask. Sometimes -- where -- where else\ndid you go? Yo-You mentioned Catholic schools, there were other places?",
        "Q: Oh yes, I went to schools, I went -- I spoke before high schools, I spoke in Santa\nMonica\u2019s high schools, I spoke before Hillel groups, I spoke in churches. And I liked to\ngo to churches, because I felt that Jewish people, and Jewish organizations and Jewish\ngroups that invited me, Havorah groups for instance, some people were there who were\ngenuinely interested, but they knew about it. And some people said enough, it\u2019s enough\nand they did not want to hear this any more. So I thought if I would speak to non-Jewish\naudiences, and I will reach just some of them, then I did something good. And I did. I -- I\nspoke in few churches, especially there is one church here, United Methodist, that I was\ninvited -- that was a year ago, I think, and the lady who invited me -- I went with her and\nshe said, \u201cDo you mind there is a German lady in the wa -- in the church?\u201d I said, \u201cOf\ncourse not.\u201d And this German lady listened very intently. And she tried to tell me that she\nand her whole family were never Nazis. I didn\u2019t -- I did not question her -- and her\nMarch 16, 2001\ngrandfather would like to help people. I\u2019m not interested 1n her story, and if they did\nthat\u2019s wonderful and she doesn\u2019t have to explain this to me. I am there on one purpose\nonly, to tell people not my personal story, but to spread my message. And my message\nalways was one, let\u2019s tolerate one another, let\u2019s learn about each other. And I always say\nthat people take this with a grain of salt, you don\u2019t have to love one another, but tolerate\none another. Learn how to live together, because otherwise we jeopardize th-the en -- the\nentire -- the population is growing fast, the earth is getting smaller. We\u2019re flying from\none place to another in few hours. If we won\u2019t learn how to get along, we will perish.",
        "Q: I-I know that this not something you want to get into detail necessarily, but let\u2019s speak\njust a little bit about the price that you pay for this though. I mean, it is not -- it 1s not easy\nfor you to keep talking about this. What -- what -- what happens when you do it? What --\nwhat is the price you pay?",
        "A: I would deny if I would say that I don\u2019t pay price for it. The price is my health. My\ninnermost feelings, my -- my dreams, my nightmares. But you have to decide, 1s it worth\nit? I know I\u2019m getting older, I know that I am winding up my da -- my speaking days. I\u2019m\nglad that I\u2019m doing this for -- for the museum, that this will be on the tape. I will leave\nsomething behind it. But I\u2019m weaker. I\u2019m getting older and my [indecipherable] are\ngreater than before. Aside from the fact that I went through a -- a lot with my daughter,\nwho had this terrible surgery, it took a lot out of me. And it was for me a big decision if I\nshould do it -- this. But I said, I did the first part, I have to follow it up. I\u2019m glad that you\nMarch 16, 2001\nask me, I\u2019m glad you came. I\u2019m glad that this will be in archives. I hope that it will be of\nsome use, and it will do some good by reaching the right people, and the wrong people.",
        "Q: Can -- can we go back to your life in New York for just a little while more? We spoke\nabout Israel as being a very important thing that happened in your life, had a great\nimpact. Yad Vashem. Your daughter, obviously, being born was -- was an incredible\nthing. What -- what else when you think back? Anything in the 60\u2019s or 70\u2019s that was sort\nof -- an event that sticks out that was important to you as an American?",
        "A: Well, a -- a ba -- the very important event that happened to me, that touched me very\nmuch, strangely, it is the creation of Israel. It -- it -- 1t was an unbelievable impact. Of\ncourse, I remember Golda Meier came to New York to speak at the Madison Square\nGarden before it was razed. And I was there with my girlfriend. And Ed McMahon, who\nwas the man for -- who always introduced Johnny Carson, he was the MC. He\nintroduced Golda Meier. And Golda, the -- the elderly lady, with the swollen legs, with\nthe big, heavy stockings and big, black shoes, I remember -- will never forget. Ugly\nwoman, speaking in the most beautiful English, speaking from her heart. And I remember\nthe place was packed. I don\u2019t know how I got in, I don\u2019t remember that, but I was inside,\nand I remember they -- down the aisles, young people were holding four corners of Israeli\nmap with Magen David, white with the Magen David and people were just throwing\nmoney into it. And I threw whatever I had in my pocketbook. This was a tremendous\nthing. Jewish people will have their homeland. It was something that I think only some\nMarch 16, 2001\nsect of fundamelis -- fundament -- fundamentalist predicted that Israel will come back.\nAnd there it was. Now, I myself was not the material to go to Israel and fight and --\nhowever, it was magnificent. That day will stick out in my mor -- memory forever.\nIncidentally, there is one person, I don\u2019t know if that museum would be interested in,\nnon-Jewish. The lady is in her late 80\u2019s, lives he -- here in San Diego. We became great\nfriends. We met in a writing club, because I was going to writing classes, I love to write.\nShe and her husband took part in the creation of Israel. Her husband came home in 1945,\nor \u00b046, I don\u2019t remember when, when the war was over, he was a veteran. And he didn\u2019t\nhave a job. He was recruited, not knowing for what and for where, by somebody by the\nname Al Schwimmer. They took him -- she didn\u2019t know where he went, they took him to\nCzechoslovakia, they got few planes there, he was airplane mechanic. He was fixing\nplanes so Israel could get six planes. This was when they -- before the war started. She\ndidn\u2019t know for a few months where he was, he was not allowed to let her know. And\neventually he went to Israel, Israel was created, and she followed him, and she spent two\nyears in Israel with him, working as an English steno -- some position there. And she\nsaying -- said -- she wrote a book about it.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: She wrote a book about it. I have a copy. She said what -- what was supposed to be\nour work became our cause. This lady spoke about it, I invited her to some groups to\nMarch 16, 2001\nspeak about it. Her husband was one of the heroes, unsung heroes who helped Israel into\nbeing. Non-Jewish, young man, he died last year. She\u2019s about 89, she still goes to writing\nclasses. I wonder if museum would like to have her story. If you have a chance, tell them\nshe is an extraordinary person.",
        "Q: I will. And now it\u2019s on tape, too. Is there anything before -- I want to also talk a little\nbit about San Diego later, but is there anything in New York in your life, you stayed\nthere for 20 years, that -- that sticks out as an -- as an important event or something?",
        "A: Th-This was one of the most important events. The other events were my friendship\nwith two ladies, especially. Especially the one, she came from Vienna originally, we\nwent to museums together, we shared interests. I loved M-Metropolitan. And we went to\nconcerts. There was nothing of tremendous impact there. I was always the class mother. I\nalways went on trips for the school. I -- when the teacher needed a helper I was ready,\nbecause I didn\u2019t work. I supervised. I loved being with the children, so -- I always stayed\nin touch with the people whose children I was working for when they were born. I --",
        "Q: You could say something about your husband and you being very civic minded. I\nmean, you really --",
        "A: Yes. My husband I were always -- we shared the idea that once you become a citizen\nof this country, you owe something to this country. And we are both civic minded. In\nNew York, when my husband worked and I didn\u2019t, I volunteered for Albert Einstein\nHospital, and they ask me -- first they put me to count pills in the basement, which blew\nMarch 16, 2001\nmy mind off. I thought that I -- I will get crazy there, I couldn\u2019t do it. So I asked them to\ntransfer me to the library cart. And I was walking with the library cart, and people who\nwere able to read magazines and books, I did this. I had a uniform and then I talked my\nfriends to do it, and we did this for quite awhile. And my husband wants me -- came to\nSan Diego when he retired, this is 21 years that he volunteers in three hospitals, four days\na week. And he is -- he has all kinds of awards, you can see it on the wall up there. He\nwas always civic minded. He 1s appreciated in the hospital and it makes -- it makes our\nlife easier in the way that we are not two elderly people sitting on top of one another, but\nwe have some different interests. He loves his hospitals, I do not like hospitals. I like to\nstay away from hospitals. But there are some people who are needed there. And he\nfulfills this need. He\u2019s in charge of volunteers for the emergency room. He stays in the\nemergency room, and the lady that I met today when I picked you up, worked for him in\nthe emergency room. Which shows you how small this world is.",
        "Q: Have you ever associated with co -- with survivor groups, or with survivors?",
        "A: There is a survivor group in San Diego, and I went to one meeting there. But at this\nparticular meeting -- the people are very active, and they do a lot of things, and there are\na couple of them that do speak. One of them wrote some book. What bothered me was\nthat he always peddles this book wherev -- every store you go to. He sits there, I will sign\nit, I will sign it, and this turns me off. And sometimes a lot of them were speaking\nYiddish, which I didn\u2019t. So I decided that I can be a very good civic minded survivor\nMarch 16, 2001\nwithout being in the group. I will do my part without being a part of the group. The group\nis very nice, very good, they donated m-money for the wall, I believe, that this -- and they\nhave a monument, some sort of monument. And I sent my money to -- as much as I could\nto Jewish American Congress, and to the Shoah Foundation and to the Holocaust\nMuseum, 36 dollars, which supposed to have some significance because it\u2019s twice 18,\nwhich 18 is life, [indecipherable] which I learned.",
        "Q: I have only maybe two more questions. One 1s just a -- a quick follow-up question on\nyour daughter. Could you maybe say again that -- it was very hard for her to hear details\nabout what was done to you, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t -- cou -- could you speak to that a little bit?",
        "A: Yes. When we lived in New York and my daughter was already a teenager, and -- and\n-- and even tw -- 19 - 18 - 19 -- and they were forming groups of second generation, my\ndaughter did not join it. Now, I asked her about it. She said she lives with it, seeing my\nbody, it reminds her enough of Holocaust. She could not associate with a group and\nspeaking about it, 1t hurt her too much. She wanted us to have a normal life without m-\nmentioning. It -- it -- sometimes it was a -- wa -- she wondered how could I go on and on.\nShe said, \u201cMommy, I would like you to stop, you are torturing yourself. I want you to\nstop it.\u201d She meant well, and she does her civic duty. She contributes to it, but she could\nMarch 16, 2001\nnot speak about it because she -- in her heart it is a feeling of tremendous pain, seeing\nwhat has happened to me during the war.",
        "Q: And she also had a hard time hearing exactly what --",
        "A: Well, I did not tell her details. I told her, I never made secret of it, how I survived the\nwar, and -- but nothing that -- the gross details. She had to know, but at the same token I\ndidn\u2019t want to go overboard, because this was a child. I didn\u2019t want to poison her mind. I\nhad to find the middle road, for her to grow up to be a bright, open-minded person. And I\nhope that I achieved this.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about your granddaughter a little bit. You did have a -- you do have a\ngranddaughter, and when was -- when was she born, and what is her rela -- what\u2019s her\nname and what is your relationship to [indecipherable]",
        "A: My granddaughter\u2019s name is Alexis Danielle. She was born in 1978. She\u2019s the joy of\nall our lives. She is beautiful in and out. She\u2019s bright. She graduated Duke University.\nShe had a lot of friends there, whom she misses terribly now. She 1s in her first year of\nlaw school, wants to study environmental law. She\u2019s romantic. She wants to save the\nworld. She wants to contribute to the betterment of the world, the human race. She\u2019s an\nadvocate for the animal rights, trees, water. Save -- save -- save the trees, save the water.\nShe is not one of the crazies, she\u2019s a very normal young lady. And we are very proud of\nher. And we hope that she will achieve what she set out to do. Her father 1s an attorney\ntoo, but in a different area, not criminal, he\u2019s a litigator. And she has very happy home\nMarch 16, 2001\nlife. Her parents are very loyal, wonderful couple. I was very lucky that my daughter\nmarried a man who\u2019s a wonderful husband and father and provides cultural background.\nThey do go to theater very often, my daughter loves theater, and she exposed her\ndaughter to the loves, as I did her, even when I couldn\u2019t afford it, my daughter can afford\nit now. So Alexis is very well rounded young person, as is my daughter.",
        "Q: T -- only two more questions.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: One, you refer to your age that you are getting older. What does -- what does age --\nwhat changes with age, or what has changed for you particular with regard maybe to -- to\nmemory or also to events, the impact of -- of -- of the Holocaust to you.",
        "A: Well this 1s a -- this is a serious question. I am aging and I feel this with every minute,\nmore so. And sometimes I rebel, because I lost so many years when I could have been\ndoing things and learning, my -- my young years in the camps. Each year could count for\n50. So I rebel that in my older age I have -- I have a big baggage, not only physical, but I\nhave this -- this -- in the back of my mind, the -- the guilt feelings. I live with it. I will\nnever get rid of it. So old age is -- it\u2019s not so sweet. The only sweetness is the family.",
        "Q: Is th -- is memory -- is memory fading too?",
        "A: The memory 1s -- I found out that short term memory is fading, but I was reassured\nthat young people do it too. So when I will see somebody, I say how are you, without\nmentioning the name. But the long term memory, there certain things that are blending\nMarch 16, 2001\nbecause it was so fast. When we were running, for instance. I don\u2019t remember some of\nthem. I don\u2019t remember -- and I mentioned this many times, the face of my torturer. I\nerased his face from my memory because I didn\u2019t want to be haunted by it. I don\u2019t\nremember the faces of the [indecipherable] and the SS women who were so cruel. I\ndon\u2019t want to remember, I don\u2019t want to see them in my dreams. So subconsciously this\nis gone. I know the fact, but I don\u2019t remember the faces. Some of my friends who\nsurvived, they remember the -- the smallest details and yet when we were invited to\nRavensbrick, Sachsenhausen, [ received invitation. I could go free with my husband,\npay fare, and pay three days stay. The program that was sent to me had a concert, visiting\nthe SS barracks and something else. And I very politely denied -- I mean refused. I did\nnot want to go back. I am not anxious to see Sachsenhausen or Ravensbrick. I don\u2019t\nwant to see the barracks. I don\u2019t need to see this. I never went back, I never went to\nDachau or Auschwitz. I know about it, I don\u2019t have to go to see it. People who went\nduring the war, if they go, it\u2019s good. Let them perpetuate the memory of it. I don\u2019t need\nit. And th-the invitation for three days paid to fly, well it was to me almost an insult.",
        "Q: Six years, roughly, of the Holocaust, the war years, almost 55 years after. Is -- is the --\nis there a weighing? What 1s -- the 50 year -- the 55 years after the war, are they as strong\nas the six years? Is there -- can one weigh this -- this -- have you --\nMarch 16, 2001",

        "Q: Eternity?",
        "A: Eternity. These years now, especially now that I grow older, passing by very quickly,\ntoo quickly. I want to live long enough to see my granddaughter graduate, to see good\nthings. To see her get married, and then I'll be completely happy. To hear from people\nagain -- I have listened to you, and I appreciate it. I learned something from you. I\nadopted some of your ideas. I hope that somebody sometimes will read or see my tapes in\nWashington and will let me know. It would be a -- a tremendous thing to know. I -- I\nreceived a lot of letters from schoolchildren, from people who listen, even from the\nsisters in the Catholic school. I send them -- not all of them, but a -- a lot of them to the\nHolocaust Museum, but I would like to know in the museum itself, if teachers who come\nfor information, or somebody -- if somebody stumbled upon one of my tapes, or visual,\nor oral, and that I made some impact, that would be wonderful.

        "A: Prior to the liberation, we were locked in a barracks and the windows were shut and\nthey were supposed -- supposedly trying to kill us, but there was not enough time, they\nhad to escape because the Russian forces closed. And the sight through the locked\nshutters, we could see that the towers were empty, and the SS was gone. And this was the\nmoment that we realized that they abandoned us. And that was April the 26\", I believe, of\n1945. Since I was badly hurt, my friends were holding me, and broke the doors and ran to\nthe kitchen, brought some margarine. We stuffed ourselves with the margarine, and we\ndecided to leave the camp. Went across the street, there was the house that the\ncommandant used to live, with the garden. There were several of us, one girl had her\nmother with, and somebody brought two eggs and two potatoes, and at that moment the\ncommandant came back with a gun. And we were frozen stiff looking at him. And the\npoignant part was that he was afraid of us. And he disappeared. And we decided to leave.\nMarch 16, 2001\nMy friends were helping me. We went through the fields, there was a great deal of\nfirework -- not firework, fire stemming from the war. They were being bombarded, and\nwe ran. We joined with two Polish men who worked there in the fields. We reached the\nfront line and first -- we saw the first Russian, and this was the -- suppose our liberation -\n- supposed liberation. Pretty soon we discovered that this was not the freedom that we\nwere dreaming of. Freedom was very different. We thought of the normal -- normal life\nthat will come of finding the family. It was very difficult period of time.",
        "A: Yes. It was actual front line because the war was still going on and the shooting was\non both sides. As a matter of fact, one of the girls was hit. We just didn\u2019t have time to\nlook, we were running like an animal. The first Russian was of Asiatic origin because his\nface, the features were Asiatic. And he was very dirty, I remember his big, black leather\nboots, filthy uniform. He was the liberator, and we thought we should kiss his boots. He\ntold us -- he motioned to us to go back, and the Russians gave us help. The help consisted\nof a barrel of herring. And we ate the herring, and of course the -- we be-became very\nthirsty, there was no water, the pipes were broken. And they told us to leave, my friends\nheld me. We reached the first house in the village, the roof was gone from the\nbombardments. We went to the basement, the basement was very well prepared with food\nMarch 16, 2001\nand sleeping equipment. We lay down -- we ate, we lay down, and the very same night,\ntwo Russians came, and raped two girls. So --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: I was --",
        "A: Well, you have to understand the circumstances, the Russians were fighting, 1t was\njust unbelievable. I didn\u2019t see anything there of -- of nor-normal food ration, or even\n[indecipherable] Red -- Red Cross. But they had some bandages and they gave me the\nbandages and I was bandaged around my body to hold my ribs. That\u2019s all I remember.\nAnd when -- once we went to the basement, 1t was some sort of a trapdoor going down,\nwhich I wasn\u2019t familiar with before. We went to the basement and one of the Russians\nwas drunk. Wi -- he started to shoot at the jars which were lined on the shelves, and the\npieces of -- pieces of the glass embedded in my left leg, and I was lying down on one of\nthe two cots, and I ask one of the Polish men, please protect me. I -- when the times will\nbe normal, I will give you -- my -- my mother, my family will give you anything in the\nworld if you will help me. He covered me, and he sat down on me. And I was lying there\nand my leg was bleeding, but I didn\u2019t make a sound. That was the night that two girls --\nMarch 16, 2001\none was taken out, one was -- they blew the candle out and they raped her, and the other\none came bloody back. This was my liberation. Very bitter. We wondered if this is -- 1-1f\nthis was worth it, to survive to see this. The next day we left for the village, to another\nhouse.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. The freedom was very bleak. I was petrified of the Russians now. So, after a\ncouple of days, next house to ours was occupied by the former French prisoners of war.\nAnd I talked the them and they decided that they will take me to their house and protect\nme, and I stayed with them for quite awhile.",
        "A: Well naturally, I thought that my family survived. I was unaware that everybody was\nkilled. So I wanted -- my first thought was going back to Poland. And there were some\nPolish people with some sort of equipment that they were going towards Poland and they\nMarch 16, 2001\nhad carts, and they took me -- they had Polish flag, and we went through Lignitz, I\nremember, and then -- the names escape me, but I know that we were in Lignitz, and we\nwere in another city big, and that city was already organized, and people already had\nration cards, and we slept in a place that we were assigned to. But I still wanted to go to\nmy native city, and there was -- there was a train already, on one of the tracks, and I went\nwith this train to Warsaw. And in Warsaw I got off the train, of course everything was\nwithout money and no possessions. A human being is very strong, unbelievably strong.\nAnd in Warsaw, I was just standing there with nothing and I saw a man with a s -- truck,\nand I ask him where he 1s going and he said he is going to L\u00e9dz, which was my city. And\nI ask him if he will take me, and he agreed. And that\u2019s how I reached it. Warsaw was\ncompletely destroyed. There was -- I -- I had uncle and aunt, but I couldn\u2019t find the\nstreets. Everything was in ruins. So I was very glad that I was getting the ride, without\nmoney, which I didn\u2019t have. He went -- we stopped in Lublin, I believe and he went out\nto eat and he left me in the car. And he came back, I think he brought a piece of bread,\nbut I\u2019m not too sure. I was hungry. We reached L\u00e9dz and -- of course, L6dz was not\ndestroyed because it was occupied very quickly. And I tried to go to the place that we\nlived. I was not let in. The Polish people occupied our place.",

        "A: All the houses on our street were absolutely in perfect condition, because L6dz was\noccupied by the Germans, I believe on September sixth, maybe fifth of 1939. So the city\nhad only the first day of bombing and it was not destroyed. And our house was standing,\nand the so-called superintendent was still the same one. And when he saw me, he thought\nthat he -- that he saw a ghost. He said in Polish, how come I survived, why did I come\nback. This was the greeting I have -- received. When I wanted to go upstairs to our place,\nour apartment, the L\u00e9dz place, the people wouldn\u2019t let me in. And I went down and the\nsuper said that the Germans own -- took everything out. The carpets, and whatever there\nwas there, they took it out. So I went to -- two streets further. There was a -- some sort of\na bureau that had information, people who came were putting down their names. And I\nlooked through their list --",

And my girlfriend survived in L\u00e9dz in hiding\nwith -- with her husband. Her address was there, and I went to her.

I loved the literature. I was, you may say patriotic. I had Polish girlfriends, and\nI thought on coming back that I will meet some people. I -- I was bitterly disappointed.\nThat stems already from before, because when the war started, my friends didn\u2019t come to\nsee me. They could have in the beginning, before we went to the ghetto. But not having\nfamily left, and not wanting to contact any of my Polish ex-friends, my -- my idea was to\nleave Poland forever and ever. I didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with Poland.",

I cannot\ntell you exactly the frame of time that this occurred, but after two weeks being in L\u00e9dz,\nand my friend was with her husband, and I -- I just didn\u2019t feel welcome. My po -- my\nPoland was not my Poland any more. I wrote -- I wrote a poem about it here in the\nStates, that the fatherland didn\u2019t love me. So I flaunted. I don\u2019t want them any more.\nAnd I decided to move to Berlin because I was told that they had displaced person\ncamps, run by the allied forces, and I thought maybe somebody survived there.",
        "A: It was very strange. We came -- we came with -- previously I told this story, that the\nRussian smuggled us to his cr -- train compartment, and we arrived in Berlin and he let\nus off at the station, and we were standing there, and sort of sizing people. And we saw\ntwo people, two young men who didn\u2019t look -- appear to be Jewish, and we approached\nthem and we asked them, and they said yes. And they gave us some fare in fennix, I\ndon\u2019t remember how much.

        "A: We were given places to sleep, we were given food, and I don\u2019t remember too much\nabout it, maybe because I\u2019m getting older, mi -- things are sort of slowly blending and\ndisappearing. I\u2019m trying to remember the good things, and I\u2019m trying to, maybe\nsubconsciously forget the sad things. Maybe this helped me to live. The camp provide us\nwith vital things that we needed to live. The two of us, my girlfriend and I, didn\u2019t feel\ncomfortable. We wanted some sort of a more normal life, so we were given a room by a\nGerman war widow. I still remember her name, Frau Beans. And she [indecipherable]\nand we were give a room, it was -- it was cold, I remember. We had a little stove in the\nmiddle of the floor that we made of coal or anthracite, to warm up. And we were given\nration cards, and some Russians started to come to visit this aunt, and this -- and -- and\nthe woman and her aunt, because they -- they -- they were given some food from the\nRussians. What did they do, I have no idea. We were very unhappy about that situation.\nMarch 16, 2001",

I wanted the -- the personal life, not to be in somebody\u2019s room\nand behave and -- and make that piece of bread on this little stove, heat it up, and go for\nthe ration with the card and stand on a line. I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t expect my freedom to be of\nthat sort. I -- I wanted to disassociate myself with all this. It was very bitter. To top this\nall, I saw in this German house, a Menorah, which her husband, who was killed in the\nwar, sent her from one of the occupied countries. The woman had no idea what it was,\nbut I saw a silver Menorah, and this broke my heart. After that, we had a little incident,\nwe went to a movie house, which I described before. I did not want to stay in the Russian\nsector at all. My friend was a little bit enterprising, she got herself a boyfriend. I was\npetrified of everybody and everything. I just wanted to run away to American sector. And\nI went to the -- I think this was the Jewish HIAS, some Jewish committee in Cheplin,\nand I told him that I wanted to move, and he says I have to be registered. So I got from\nthe -- from that organization some coffee Bonne caf\u00e9, and the Germans were crazy about\nBonne caf\u00e9, so I took this Bonne caf\u00e9 and I went to the German police station -- I really -\nMarch 16, 2001\n- | -- I\u2019m wondering now how -- how I could have done this, because I wasn\u2019t well.

And I gave him the Bonne caf\u00e9, the German\npoliceman took it, and put my name on list, and I got the room by Frau Pegiloft, town of\nStrasse [indecipherable].

I could not partake in any of this, and all to me was very strange. I\ncouldn\u2019t eat the way people were buying something, sitting at a table and talking about\nbusiness. I was lost. I didn\u2019t feel good, I wanted to be in an -- in a room of my own, I\nwanted privacy. And that\u2019s why I left Schlactensee. I went back to that police, and at that\ntime I was getting, every month, some sort of ration from the Jewish committee. Coffee,\nsome cigarettes, sometimes they had, sometimes they didn\u2019t have it. But whatever I had, I\nswapped with this policeman, and I got the room by Frau Pegiloft.

        "A: Well, when we arrived, and we left the boat -- and we didn\u2019t go to Ellis Island, we\nwent to a pier -- there were benches, long benches and there were letters above,\nalphabetically, A-B-C and they told us to go to a letter that was corresponding with your\nlast name. Since my name was Fisher, I went to letter F, and I was sitting there. And\npeople were coming and picking up their relatives or friends. And I was sitting and sitting\nand sitting. And finally I saw a gentleman, a very distinguished looking gentleman\nMarch 16, 2001\nwalking by with a photo, showing that picture. And when I looked at the picture, I said,\nin Polish, \u201cThis is my grandmother.\u201d So he knew that he found the right person. He was\nmy grandmother\u2019s half-brother\u2019s son-in-law. He was an attorney in New Jersey. The\npeople from Detroit couldn\u2019t come to pick me up, because that day that our ship finally\ndocked, my grandmother\u2019s sister died, on the very same day. And they had funeral to\nattend to. So they wired or called the people in New Jersey, and they -- that half-brother\nof my grandmother, and this son-in-law came to pick me up. And we could not talk to\neach other. My -- my cousin, so-called cousin, was a very bright, educated man, but he\nspoke only English. I said German? No. Polish? No. French? No. Okay. Come. And I\nfollowed him, and there I saw this gentleman, gray haired with pink cheeks and the bluest\neyes. And I saw my grandmother\u2019s face, and that was my grandmother\u2019s brother, and he\nspoke still some Polish and German. And I went with them. I remember the ride in the\ncar, alongside the west side highway, and I saw all these lights at night, snake lights, like.\nAnd the Hudson River, and we came to the bridge, huge bridge, which was George\nWashington bridge. We crossed the bridge. I was sitting with my uncle -- great-uncle,\nand we reached his place in Patterson, New Jersey, it was Patterson. And his wife also\nspoke Polish and German and was the most wonderful, wonderful lady, who made me\nfeel good, warm. She hugged me, she kissed me, and that\u2019s what I needed. That\u2019s what I\nneeded, I didn\u2019t need any material things, I just wanted to be loved, to -- to belong. And\nthat was the beginning.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well, since I was sponsored by the people in Detroit, and the funeral\npostponed my going there, they communicated with this family that I should stay there\nfor two weeks and come to Detroit. They send a ticket for a train, and I was put in a train\nin a very nice car. I remember that I had to -- a very nice chair facing the window, so it\nmust have been first class, I guess. And they told the black attendant, a very nice man, to\ntake care of me with food and so forth, because I couldn\u2019t speak English. And he really\ntook care of me. It was a long trip. And I was dressed very decently, because before I left\nGermany, all my accumulated coffee that I still had, I exchanged for a nice coat. It was\nwith fur, I remember. And a scarf. And I looked decent, fairly decent. And when I arrived\nin Detroit, the people at the station were mighty surprised. I don\u2019t know what they\nexpected, but they thought that this will come somebody from beyond the moon. Well, I -\n- sure, I didn\u2019t speak English, but I had brains. And I looked all right, because I -- I had\nthe rations already in Germany to eat, and I had that couple of weeks with my aunt --\ngreat-aunt and uncle. They fed me and they -- they were very, very nice to me. And I\nspent some time with the people in Detroit. The parents were nice, but their daughter was\n-- | must say she was cruel to me, because I took away the limelight away from her. And\nI again was unhappy. So it was decided that I will move to another brother they had. The\nMarch 16, 2001\nbrother was an old bachelor, who must have been at that time in his 60\u2019s, and I was in my\nearly 20\u2019s, and they thought that I should marry him. So I -- I went to a Polish part of\ntown in -- in Detroit, that is Polish. And I got myself a little job working on camera\ncases, and I -- I think I was paid 18 dollars a week, maybe 20, I don\u2019t remember exactly.\nAnd I saved the money. They didn\u2019t like that I got the job, because its -- it hurt their\npride. But I couldn\u2019t walk around without penny in my pocket and -- and if I would want\nto spend five cents I would have to ask for it. I wanted to be independent. So I got this\nmoney and I saved -- they didn\u2019t want money from me. So I saved for the trip back to\nNew York. And --",
        "A: Well, as a matter of fact, yes. I was learning English rapidly. I went at night to a night\nschool, and they have classes for -- m-m-most of the people at night were people who\nworked here for many, many years, they did not have time to learn the language properly.\nSo I learned very quickly, and I wanted to lead a normal, independent life. I didn\u2019t want\nto be dependent on every -- anybody. And I didn\u2019t want to stay with them. And the idea\nof marrying this old man was just horrific. So I wanted to leave.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Yes, they took me to a doctor once, and th-there were several things wrong with me,\nbut unfortunately they didn\u2019t have that type of help for the spine as they have nowadays,\nso nothing could be done.",
        "A: I had -- some ribs were damaged, broken, and the spine s -- 1t didn\u2019t show when I was\nclothed, in clothes, but when I was undressed you could see sticking parts of -- and I was\nvery self-conscious about it. No, I didn\u2019t get the proper medical care. If I would have\ngotten -- if they would have put me in corset in those days -- but I guess that compassion\nis one thing, and money is another. And maybe it would be costly. No, I didn\u2019t have\nproper care. And I came back to New York and went back to the great-uncle and great-\naunt. I took a course, three months course to become a baby nurse, newborn babies. And\nthen I was recommended from one family to another, and became great friends with all\nthe families. I -- I have three babies that I took care of, that they are three doctors now. A\nlong time already. So it -- it -- it -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s unbelievab -- I\u2019m talking\nabout my own life, but this is -- seems to me that it\u2019s some sort of a strange book.",
        "A: Oh, it was wonderful because when I got my first check, I gave it to my great-aunt,\nand I said, this -- this -- this is the sweetest day that I can help you for all you have done\nfor me. Now, she didn\u2019t have to depend on my money because she had three daughters,\nand all three were married well, they were all educated. And -- but I felt independent, I\nMarch 16, 2001\npaid. And we spent many hours sitting in the kitchen, she was an elderly lady. Now that\nI\u2019m elderly myself -- we were sitting -- she was sitting making her homemade noodles,\nhomemade, and cutting them. And she said, \u201cWell, when you are old you have to sit then\nyou do these things.\u201d So the little things that I remember with great li -- forgot this word,\nbut this is such wonderful feeling I have when I think of her, the -- the compassion that\nshe showed me, and the -- the warmth. I -- I felt that I belonged. And all the people that I\nworked for became my friends. I loved them all, and I hope I was loved there, too. So I\nwas independent of this family in Detroit.",
        "A: In the very beginning it was very strange. Some people didn\u2019t believe that this was\npossible, some people didn\u2019t want to hear, and I decided for awhile I won\u2019t be talking\nabout it. I didn\u2019t want to scare people away from me, because I thought, they don\u2019t want\nto be surrounded by sadness and a teary story. But as I accomplished my -- my goal, and\nimproved my English, I decided that my mission was to survive in order to tell the people\nas much as I can, wherever they will listen to me. Because thing -- such a thing as\nHolocaust, it was of gigantic proportions. It never happened to this extent and it has to be\ntold. And that\u2019s what we promised each other, my family. And I was the one that was\nleft. So it will -- became my goal.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: Yes. There were two kinds of people. There were people who felt that by the very\nvirtue of being born here, and living here for many years, for some reason I was sort of\ninferior to them. I disregarded this, because I felt well -- I feel that this is -- I don\u2019t want\nto lower myself to their level. And there were people who were very sympathetic and\nvery loving and I was drawn to these people. So I had to be very careful in the beginning\nnot to overstate my feelings, not to -- I had to be very careful. People were critical of\ncertain European ways, and I could not get used to some of the American ways. We ate\ndifferently, we -- we -- we behaved, very often, differently, but I didn\u2019t dare to say it. I\nkept this to myself. It\u2019s very unimportant, because each culture has its own way of\ndealing with things. And that\u2019s what makes us different and that\u2019s -- an intelligent person\ncan or -- adapt or learn from each other, or disregard. It\u2019s not important. These are --\nthese are very secondary issues, because after all, we are all human beings. If we try, we\ncan get along, if we\u2019ll only try. And that is one of the issues that I approach when I speak.",
        "A: In the beginning, yes.\nMarch 16, 2001\nmore comfortable, you had some money. What was sort of the goal, what was it that you\nwanted next?",
        "A: What I wanted next was to have a child. I wanted to have a -- as I said this -- and you\nwill see this on -- hear this on the tape, that I wanted to show Hitler that the seed\nsurvived. And I wanted a child the worst way. It was very unconventional those days to\nhave a child without a husband. I got married to a man who is a very nice man. But this\nwould not have been my choice if the times would have been normal. We are very\ndifferent people, intellectually. And we are both honest, we both are of the same religion,\nwe are both very honest, we are both civically minded people. And we both love music --\ndifferent kinds of music, but music. But we are very different. I needed more stimull,\nwhich I couldn\u2019t get from my husband.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I needed more intellectual stimulus. I tried to find this in reading, I became voracious\nreader. Financially I was not in position to -- to do things that I would have liked to. I\nwould have liked to go to a good university. I thought that I had enough brain to do it, but\nmy health was precarious. I got married and I immediately, the next month, I got\npregnant. I wanted it, and I was afraid that I won\u2019t be able to because I didn\u2019t menstruate\nMarch 16, 2001\nfor about four years in camps. But I was fortunate enough, and I wanted a daughter,\nbecause I always felt that the daughter will be close, closer than a son. So I was lucky.",
        "A: The doctors told me that 1t would worsen my condition, 1t would throw me off. But I\nfelt that it was worth it. The -- if you put this on a scale, there was no comparison, I\nwanted a child. And it was worth it, and it worked out beautifully, because I do have a\ndaughter who is very close to me. We are very fortunate. We nourish each other. And she\nhas a daughter, and she has -- this is perpetuating. She has the same -- the same\nrelationship with her daughter. She has a husband who 1s British, and he was very\nreserved when she -- he got married, but he sort of softened by our surrounding love. He\nbecame a ver -- much more relaxed. He\u2019s still reserved, but not to the extent that he was\nbefore. He calls me Mom, I\u2019m very happy about it. Most of all, I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s a\nwonderful husband to my daughter, and wonderful father to his child.",
        "A: My daughter was born on March 22\", 1951 and her 50\" birthday is coming up. And\nI'll be there next week, and so will be my granddaughter, she will be flying. From the\nvery beginning on, my entire life centered around this child. I lived on a fourth floor\nwalk-up apartment in the Bronx. I had only one bedroom, and the bedroom belonged to\nMarch 16, 2001\nher. We had a [indecipherable] in the living room. I tried to dress her the best I could. I\ntried to read stories, sing songs, teach her, expose her to music. I -- I delighted in bringing\nher up. It was my -- my life changed. I was very grateful. And I acquired friends. We\ndecided to form groups. I belonged to a -- a book reading club. Friends who shared\ninterests with me.",
        "A: No, no, no, strangely enough, I lived in the building that I was the only survivor and I\nformed friendships with my neighbors. This was 1950 - ?51, you have to understand that\nit -- the conditions were absolutely different, it was safe. When the baby was born, I used\nto -- it was hot, we didn\u2019t have air conditioning. New York can be very cruel in the\nsummer. The humidity. So we used to go downstairs, the carriage was in the basement\nand we walked to the park at night, nobody was afraid. It was a local park. And all the\nother mothers with their babies were there, and we\u2019re -- we\u2019re sitting at night, not being\nafraid. So we formed very close friendships. Not one of my friends there was a survivor,\nstrangely enough. One was Italian, Connie, adorable. And three others were Jewish. We\nplayed Mah Jong, I remember. I learned how to play Mah Jong tho-those days. And\nthen in the summer, when my husband started to make a little bit more, in the summer we\nwere leaving New York for the country.

And he worked in Union Carbide for six years, until his heart -- he had a small\nheart attack and I told him I don\u2019t want him to work any more. I don\u2019t need the money, I\ncan live -- I saw worse things. Money was not everything, so I talked him into retiring.",

        "A: I went to Israel, don\u2019t remember the -- the -- the year. It was the year after the Six\nDay War when Jerusalem was returned to Israel. Going to Israel was -- I was not as\nexcited as I maybe should have been, but once I was there, it was the most incredible\nfeeling that occurred when I was at the Wailing Wall. And I am not a very religious\nperson. I -- my husband has -- had a sister who passed away. She left for Palestine when\nshe was a youngster, she was in the Zionist movement and she got married, and she really\nworked the soil. She was a real sabra. Her children were born there, her grandchildren,\nMarch 16, 2001\neverybody was in the army. So we went to visit her. Once we went to Jerusalem, and I\nwent to the wall, and I stood in front of this -- this -- this plain wall, and I touched --\ntouched the stones, something inside me changed. I cannot describe the feeling, it was\nlike the history of the millennia came through my body. I reminded myself that my\ngrandfather had on the wall of his room, some sort of a picture and there was saying, Oh\nJerusalem, if -- can\u2019t quote it. Something about losing a hand. I don\u2019t -- I cannot be\nverbatim, I cannot, but I know that it\u2019s very well known, and I know that existed in many\nhomes. So this came to my mind. Jerusalem, walking the streets, the historical cobbled\nstreets, which led from around the wall, through the 14 station of Jesus were of tremen --\nmade tremendous impact on me, because I walked on history. Jesus did walk there.\nMary Magdalene was there. The Roman soldiers were there. The Hebrews were there,\nand here I am walking there. Tremendous impact. I went to the mosque, to the blue\nmosque. I took my shoes off, I saw the people -- very few people in there. I went\ndownstairs where the rock 1s, and this is allegedly the rock on which Abraham was\nsupposed to sacrifice his son, and God stopped him. I don\u2019t know -- these were legends,\nbut to me this was something that history repeated in all the hundreds and hundreds of\nyears. So I sort of became a little part of the history, touching the whole thing. It made\ntremendous impact on me. Going to Yad Vashem was another story. Going 1n there and\nstanding at the gallery, looking down at the slabs of stone with the names of the camps, I\nbroke down. I thought I am immune to it, that I will not, but I did break down, and I\nMarch 16, 2001\ncried. When I walked out, it was one of these beautiful s-sunny days in Jerusalem, and\nyou\u2019re coming out from this dark chamber of remembrances of the tragedy that human\npeople suffered at human hands. And you go out and there is this street with the trees.\nThe street with the trees of the Righteous Gentiles. The contrast is so startling. It 1s so eye\nopening. I -- I will never forget til the day I die, my feeling when I saw this. At that point\nI was not aware of all the Gentiles who did help. I knew smattering of things, because I\nwas always interested reading the books. I knew about Denmark. I knew about sporadic\nthings, but the names that I\u2019ve seen this, and the trees. The whole idea was so special to\nme that it was the highlight of my trip.",
        "A: Well, I grew up in a family that was -- my mother and father were non-observant\nJews. However, the tradition was kept up. We went for all the big holidays to\ngrandparents, who kept th-the -- Judaism alive, and they were religious. They were not\nOrthodox, but they were religious. I will never forget the Seders, the warm feeling of\nbeing with all my family, and with strangers, because we always -- my grandparents\ninvited strangers, this was a tradition, from orphanage, soldiers who were of Jewish\norigin who did not have place to go to. We always had strangers at the table. And th -- we\nwere only two grandchildren there, I was the older one, and mother\u2019s sister boy was the\nMarch 16, 2001\nyounger one. And they had a cook, and a serving maid, and there was a long, long table\nladen with this food, and the people, and the happiness, and the lights, because my\ngrandfather always said let there be a lot of light, 1t\u2019s a holiday. So all the lights in all the\nrooms were on. It was such a wonderful, happy feeling. New Year\u2019s we used to go to the\ntemple to pick up my grandparents because they were going -- my parents didn\u2019t, and we\nalways brought a -- white flowers with us, a bouquet of white flowers, I don\u2019t know why.\nSo the memories and the -- the -- of the tradition were very strong with me. I -- I believe\nin some sort of supreme being, but I couldn\u2019t define it. I did not have Hebrew education,\nneither did my mother. I -- I\u2019m av -- extremely good Jew at heart because I believe in the\ncommandments, and I feel if y -- you don\u2019t have to be Jewish to follow the\ncommandments. And if you follow the commandments, you\u2019re religious. My father\u2019s\nidea was more philoso -- philosophical, he thought that God surrounds us, that God is\neverywhere, in every huma -- 1-in every human, in every living tree, in the nature. And I\nsort of adopted this. However, in camp, I was questioning, where is that supreme being?\nWhere is God? What\u2019s happening? These are human beings who are doing this to other\nhuman beings, therefore, is there a God? The questioning. Long time. I slowly returned to\nthe faith. I\u2019m not a temple goer, but I feel that I am a good Jew because I observe the\ncommandments. I will not steal, I will honor -- unfortunately I don\u2019t have parents, I\u2019m an\nold lady myself. And I tried to bring up my daughter in the spirit, and my daughter did\nnot have Bat Mitzvah, but my granddaughter did. So it\u2019s like coming back. The circle 1s\nMarch 16, 2001\nrepeating. And when I spoke at my granddaughter\u2019s Bat Mitzvah, I did say it, that the\nseed survived after all. To me this was very, very powerful statement. In view that so\nmany members of my family were killed, and I felt that I was the weakest link, and I\nsurvived, and I was able to produce the next pr -- generation. It was very strong feeling,\nand this brought me back to the faith.",

        "A: Nobody urged me. I felt -- first of all, the family said, when we saw that we are\ndoomed, that if someone survived, some -- that one should speak. There was no question\nabout it in Poland or Germany, I would not dream about it. In the beginning in the\nStates, my English wasn\u2019t good enough, and it was absolutely negligent, I didn\u2019t speak\nthe language. When I learned and I became fairly fluent in English, the obligation started\nto come back. I said, I promised, I have to start. And I started with some of my friends\nwho were American born, and little by little 1t grew. People listen and they said, oh, you\nknow, we have a group of women, this will be interesting to invite you. And since I live\nin San Diego, | did this for over 20 years here. And I was always recommended. I never\nput my name in the papers that people did. But -- especially the Catholic school. They\ninvited me three times. And I said to the teacher, \u201cBut I\u2019m repeating myself.\u201d They said,\n\u201cWhat do you think we do? We repeating our lessons, but each time 1s a different class,\nMarch 16, 2001\ndifferent people.\u201d So I fulfilled my promise and my obligation, and I never wanted to\nprofit by it. I did this because this is my absolute responsibility to the people who\nperished. And if there are some individuals who do profit by it, \u2019'm sorry they do. \u2019'm\nhappy that they do some good by speaking, but I feel that 1t\u2019s almost unethical to profit\nby it in any way. There is no glory in it, to -- to -- to be invited guest of honor here and\nthere, and -- and have pictures. It -- 1t doesn\u2019t apply to me.\nMarch 16, 2001\ngrandfather would like to help people. I\u2019m not interested 1n her story, and if they did\nthat\u2019s wonderful and she doesn\u2019t have to explain this to me. I am there on one purpose\nonly, to tell people not my personal story, but to spread my message. And my message\nalways was one, let\u2019s tolerate one another, let\u2019s learn about each other. And I always say\nthat people take this with a grain of salt, you don\u2019t have to love one another, but tolerate\none another. Learn how to live together, because otherwise we jeopardize th-the en -- the\nentire -- the population is growing fast, the earth is getting smaller. We\u2019re flying from\none place to another in few hours. If we won\u2019t learn how to get along, we will perish.",
        "A: I would deny if I would say that I don\u2019t pay price for it. The price is my health. My\ninnermost feelings, my -- my dreams, my nightmares. But you have to decide, 1s it worth\nit? I know I\u2019m getting older, I know that I am winding up my da -- my speaking days. I\u2019m\nglad that I\u2019m doing this for -- for the museum, that this will be on the tape. I will leave\nsomething behind it. But I\u2019m weaker. I\u2019m getting older and my [indecipherable] are\ngreater than before. Aside from the fact that I went through a -- a lot with my daughter,\nwho had this terrible surgery, it took a lot out of me. And it was for me a big decision if I\nshould do it -- this. But I said, I did the first part, I have to follow it up. I\u2019m glad that you\nMarch 16, 2001\nask me, I\u2019m glad you came. I\u2019m glad that this will be in archives. I hope that it will be of\nsome use, and it will do some good by reaching the right people, and the wrong people.",
        "A: Well, a -- a ba -- the very important event that happened to me, that touched me very\nmuch, strangely, it is the creation of Israel. It -- it -- 1t was an unbelievable impact. Of\ncourse, I remember Golda Meier came to New York to speak at the Madison Square\nGarden before it was razed. And I was there with my girlfriend. And Ed McMahon, who\nwas the man for -- who always introduced Johnny Carson, he was the MC. He\nintroduced Golda Meier. And Golda, the -- the elderly lady, with the swollen legs, with\nthe big, heavy stockings and big, black shoes, I remember -- will never forget. Ugly\nwoman, speaking in the most beautiful English, speaking from her heart. And I remember\nthe place was packed. I don\u2019t know how I got in, I don\u2019t remember that, but I was inside,\nand I remember they -- down the aisles, young people were holding four corners of Israeli\nmap with Magen David, white with the Magen David and people were just throwing\nmoney into it. And I threw whatever I had in my pocketbook. This was a tremendous\nthing. Jewish people will have their homeland. It was something that I think only some\nMarch 16, 2001\nsect of fundamelis -- fundament -- fundamentalist predicted that Israel will come back.\nAnd there it was. Now, I myself was not the material to go to Israel and fight and --\nhowever, it was magnificent. That day will stick out in my mor -- memory forever.\nIncidentally, there is one person, I don\u2019t know if that museum would be interested in,\nnon-Jewish. The lady is in her late 80\u2019s, lives he -- here in San Diego. We became great\nfriends. We met in a writing club, because I was going to writing classes, I love to write.\nShe and her husband took part in the creation of Israel. Her husband came home in 1945,\nor \u00b046, I don\u2019t remember when, when the war was over, he was a veteran. And he didn\u2019t\nhave a job. He was recruited, not knowing for what and for where, by somebody by the\nname Al Schwimmer. They took him -- she didn\u2019t know where he went, they took him to\nCzechoslovakia, they got few planes there, he was airplane mechanic. He was fixing\nplanes so Israel could get six planes. This was when they -- before the war started. She\ndidn\u2019t know for a few months where he was, he was not allowed to let her know. And\neventually he went to Israel, Israel was created, and she followed him, and she spent two\nyears in Israel with him, working as an English steno -- some position there. And she\nsaying -- said -- she wrote a book about it.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: She wrote a book about it. I have a copy. She said what -- what was supposed to be\nour work became our cause. This lady spoke about it, I invited her to some groups to\nMarch 16, 2001\nspeak about it. Her husband was one of the heroes, unsung heroes who helped Israel into\nbeing. Non-Jewish, young man, he died last year. She\u2019s about 89, she still goes to writing\nclasses. I wonder if museum would like to have her story. If you have a chance, tell them\nshe is an extraordinary person.",
        "A: Th-This was one of the most important events. The other events were my friendship\nwith two ladies, especially. Especially the one, she came from Vienna originally, we\nwent to museums together, we shared interests. I loved M-Metropolitan. And we went to\nconcerts. There was nothing of tremendous impact there. I was always the class mother. I\nalways went on trips for the school. I -- when the teacher needed a helper I was ready,\nbecause I didn\u2019t work. I supervised. I loved being with the children, so -- I always stayed\nin touch with the people whose children I was working for when they were born. I --",
        "A: Yes. My husband I were always -- we shared the idea that once you become a citizen\nof this country, you owe something to this country. And we are both civic minded. In\nNew York, when my husband worked and I didn\u2019t, I volunteered for Albert Einstein\nHospital, and they ask me -- first they put me to count pills in the basement, which blew\nMarch 16, 2001\nmy mind off. I thought that I -- I will get crazy there, I couldn\u2019t do it. So I asked them to\ntransfer me to the library cart. And I was walking with the library cart, and people who\nwere able to read magazines and books, I did this. I had a uniform and then I talked my\nfriends to do it, and we did this for quite awhile. And my husband wants me -- came to\nSan Diego when he retired, this is 21 years that he volunteers in three hospitals, four days\na week. And he is -- he has all kinds of awards, you can see it on the wall up there. He\nwas always civic minded. He 1s appreciated in the hospital and it makes -- it makes our\nlife easier in the way that we are not two elderly people sitting on top of one another, but\nwe have some different interests. He loves his hospitals, I do not like hospitals. I like to\nstay away from hospitals. But there are some people who are needed there. And he\nfulfills this need. He\u2019s in charge of volunteers for the emergency room. He stays in the\nemergency room, and the lady that I met today when I picked you up, worked for him in\nthe emergency room. Which shows you how small this world is.",
        "A: There is a survivor group in San Diego, and I went to one meeting there. But at this\nparticular meeting -- the people are very active, and they do a lot of things, and there are\na couple of them that do speak. One of them wrote some book. What bothered me was\nthat he always peddles this book wherev -- every store you go to. He sits there, I will sign\nit, I will sign it, and this turns me off. And sometimes a lot of them were speaking\nYiddish, which I didn\u2019t. So I decided that I can be a very good civic minded survivor\nMarch 16, 2001\nwithout being in the group. I will do my part without being a part of the group. The group\nis very nice, very good, they donated m-money for the wall, I believe, that this -- and they\nhave a monument, some sort of monument. And I sent my money to -- as much as I could\nto Jewish American Congress, and to the Shoah Foundation and to the Holocaust\nMuseum, 36 dollars, which supposed to have some significance because it\u2019s twice 18,\nwhich 18 is life, [indecipherable] which I learned.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. When we lived in New York and my daughter was already a teenager, and -- and\n-- and even tw -- 19 - 18 - 19 -- and they were forming groups of second generation, my\ndaughter did not join it. Now, I asked her about it. She said she lives with it, seeing my\nbody, it reminds her enough of Holocaust. She could not associate with a group and\nspeaking about it, 1t hurt her too much. She wanted us to have a normal life without m-\nmentioning. It -- it -- sometimes it was a -- wa -- she wondered how could I go on and on.\nShe said, \u201cMommy, I would like you to stop, you are torturing yourself. I want you to\nstop it.\u201d She meant well, and she does her civic duty. She contributes to it, but she could\nMarch 16, 2001\nnot speak about it because she -- in her heart it is a feeling of tremendous pain, seeing\nwhat has happened to me during the war.",
        "A: Well, I did not tell her details. I told her, I never made secret of it, how I survived the\nwar, and -- but nothing that -- the gross details. She had to know, but at the same token I\ndidn\u2019t want to go overboard, because this was a child. I didn\u2019t want to poison her mind. I\nhad to find the middle road, for her to grow up to be a bright, open-minded person. And I\nhope that I achieved this.",
        "A: My granddaughter\u2019s name is Alexis Danielle. She was born in 1978. She\u2019s the joy of\nall our lives. She is beautiful in and out. She\u2019s bright. She graduated Duke University.\nShe had a lot of friends there, whom she misses terribly now. She 1s in her first year of\nlaw school, wants to study environmental law. She\u2019s romantic. She wants to save the\nworld. She wants to contribute to the betterment of the world, the human race. She\u2019s an\nadvocate for the animal rights, trees, water. Save -- save -- save the trees, save the water.\nShe is not one of the crazies, she\u2019s a very normal young lady. And we are very proud of\nher. And we hope that she will achieve what she set out to do. Her father 1s an attorney\ntoo, but in a different area, not criminal, he\u2019s a litigator. And she has very happy home\nMarch 16, 2001\nlife. Her parents are very loyal, wonderful couple. I was very lucky that my daughter\nmarried a man who\u2019s a wonderful husband and father and provides cultural background.\nThey do go to theater very often, my daughter loves theater, and she exposed her\ndaughter to the loves, as I did her, even when I couldn\u2019t afford it, my daughter can afford\nit now. So Alexis is very well rounded young person, as is my daughter.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well this 1s a -- this is a serious question. I am aging and I feel this with every minute,\nmore so. And sometimes I rebel, because I lost so many years when I could have been\ndoing things and learning, my -- my young years in the camps. Each year could count for\n50. So I rebel that in my older age I have -- I have a big baggage, not only physical, but I\nhave this -- this -- in the back of my mind, the -- the guilt feelings. I live with it. I will\nnever get rid of it. So old age is -- it\u2019s not so sweet. The only sweetness is the family.",
        "A: The memory 1s -- I found out that short term memory is fading, but I was reassured\nthat young people do it too. So when I will see somebody, I say how are you, without\nmentioning the name. But the long term memory, there certain things that are blending\nMarch 16, 2001\nbecause it was so fast. When we were running, for instance. I don\u2019t remember some of\nthem. I don\u2019t remember -- and I mentioned this many times, the face of my torturer. I\nerased his face from my memory because I didn\u2019t want to be haunted by it. I don\u2019t\nremember the faces of the [indecipherable] and the SS women who were so cruel. I\ndon\u2019t want to remember, I don\u2019t want to see them in my dreams. So subconsciously this\nis gone. I know the fact, but I don\u2019t remember the faces. Some of my friends who\nsurvived, they remember the -- the smallest details and yet when we were invited to\nRavensbrick, Sachsenhausen, [ received invitation. I could go free with my husband,\npay fare, and pay three days stay. The program that was sent to me had a concert, visiting\nthe SS barracks and something else. And I very politely denied -- I mean refused. I did\nnot want to go back. I am not anxious to see Sachsenhausen or Ravensbrick. I don\u2019t\nwant to see the barracks. I don\u2019t need to see this. I never went back, I never went to\nDachau or Auschwitz. I know about it, I don\u2019t have to go to see it. People who went\nduring the war, if they go, it\u2019s good. Let them perpetuate the memory of it. I don\u2019t need\nit. And th-the invitation for three days paid to fly, well it was to me almost an insult.\nMarch 16, 2001",
        "A: They are two different lives. There is no comparison. There is nothing that I can say --\nI can weigh one against the other. The six years of imprisonment were -- German word,\newigkeit.",
        "A: Eternity. These years now, especially now that I grow older, passing by very quickly,\ntoo quickly. I want to live long enough to see my granddaughter graduate, to see good\nthings. To see her get married, and then I'll be completely happy. To hear from people\nagain -- I have listened to you, and I appreciate it. I learned something from you. I\nadopted some of your ideas. I hope that somebody sometimes will read or see my tapes in\nWashington and will let me know. It would be a -- a tremendous thing to know. I -- I\nreceived a lot of letters from schoolchildren, from people who listen, even from the\nsisters in the Catholic school. I send them -- not all of them, but a -- a lot of them to the\nHolocaust Museum, but I would like to know in the museum itself, if teachers who come\nfor information, or somebody -- if somebody stumbled upon one of my tapes, or visual,\nor oral, and that I made some impact, that would be wonderful. It would be something --\nfulfillment.",
