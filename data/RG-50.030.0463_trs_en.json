        "Q: But nobody\u2019s questioning veracity, so I don\u2019t understand what -- what it is that you think you\nhave to prove. I mean, what --",
        "A: What -- what I -- what I like to do is start -- in order for my testimony, my recollections to be\nmeaningful to any future researcher, there should be no doubt in whoever is going to go through\nit mind, that the person that states these things had real access and is the person he represents\nhimself to be. Now you say you don\u2019t doubt who I am. You still don\u2019t know me from Adam. As\nfar as I\u2019m co -- you\u2019re concerned, I could have -- I can be anybody. I could have [indecipherable]\nin the books. What proof do -- what -- you have no knowledge except my word that I am Jakuv\nMozelsio, that I was born in Lodz 1924 and so on. But if I present you with documentation, then\nyou are my witness, as far as the future researchers are concerned. You follow my meaning?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Okay. All right, I can start off by showing my birth certificate.",

        "Q: Your birth certificate?",
        "A: No, I obtained that from L6dz, a copy actually, in 1969.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s Jakuv, J-a-k-u-v?",

        "A: Right, and as you see, the most important thing, which makes me so unique, is my father\u2019s\noccupation. Because without my father\u2019s occupation I wouldn\u2019t be right now here, sitting talking\nto you. This is the key to my uniqueness.",

        "A: Ba -- there were basically four -- Lodz was a textile center. We called the -- Lodz was called\nbefore the war, the Polish Manchester. And the tanneries were really a minor industry, the Lodz.\nThere were four of them, all three Jewish owned -- no, all four Jewish owned. Three of them\nspecialized in what they call upper leather, supp leather, one specialized in sole leather only.",
        "Q: In s -- in --",
        "A: Sole leather. Shoe leather.",

        "A: Sole.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: My father\u2019s tannery was the supp leather, upper leather. Although he was a master tanner and\nhe could produce any type of leather.",
        "Q: Did you work in that -- in the tannery also?",
        "A: No, I did -- no, I wa -- I was b -- I was born in the tannery. We lived --",
        "Q: Really in the tannery?",
        "A: Ah -- oh yea -- well, 1t was a compound that was in -- it was a -- that consisted of the tannery\nand a housing complex. The housing -- the hou -- apartment house was occupied by partners and\nfamily only. So I was actually born in the tannery, on the same yard. And the tannery was a --\nmy playground, considering that we lived on the outskirts of L\u00e9dz -- in Poland there was no such\nthing as suburbs, a city just gradually tapered out. And it -- a leather tannery being a smelly and\npretty dirty business, was by necessity located somewhere where -- pretty far out, away from the\ncenter.",
        "Q: How does one get the -- the leather? The -- the skins?",
        "A: I'd say it\u2019s a very complex process. You start the -- actually, leather 1s a -- they\u2019re two\nseparate words. We start out with the hide, and when we say hide, we mean a skin of an animal\nbeginning from the time when it\u2019s removed from the carcass up til the tissues are saturated with\nsome chemical that will stop it from deteriorating or rotting. That means -- we call it a hide. That\npart of process -- and 1 -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a length -- it takes even today with modern methods, it\ntakes anywhere from four to six weeks to process a hide into a finished product. And the reason I\nsay today because in 1946 - \u201947, I worked in a leather tannery in Philadelphia, for two years. And\nthe process was virtually identical. Matter of fact, the machine I worked, I -- I was assigned to,\nthe particular machine, was identical with the machine that we had back home, there was\nvirtually no difference. The same machine, same thing, same way, same method. So, ou call a\nhide all the way up to the tanning process. The minute it\u2019s tanned, that means the tissues are\npermeated with some chemical, from then on it\u2019s leather. And all consecutive stages of it, we\ntalk in terms of leather. The tannery was my playground because there were only the Jews of\nLodz resided in the city, in center city. And as you went out to the peripheries, there were less\nand less Jews. The peripheries were populated by blue collar Gentiles. Especially that the native\nPoles were a minority in Lodz. Lodz had close to a million population, something like 800,000.\nThere was about 250,000 Jews, about a hun -- 200,000 native Germans, which was termed in\nGerman the Volksdeutsch. So the Poles were really a minority. They were hi -- and there were\nstreets in the city, when we talk about the city, where -- apartment houses where the only Gentile\nwas the janitor. The entire apartment house complex was part -- occupied by Jewish families. For\ninstance, the friend of mine with whom I\u2019m staying right now in Silver Spring he lived on\nPiotkowska 20, which is center city. And it was a gigantic apartment house, two courtyards,\nhouse at least six, 800 apartments. And the only Pole was the janitor.",
        "Q: And was this typical of the way in which the groups lived, that there was mostly separation\nbetween the groups?",
        "A: Yes, yes, very much.",
        "Q: So you had no Gentile friends, or [indecipherable |",
        "A: Well, well, in my case, there were on the -- to the best of my memory, I lived on a dead end --\nyou know, it would help us, you have that map, it\u2019Il be a great help if we could kind of --",

        "Q: So this is where the tannery was [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right, this is the -- this was the tannery, and this is the ghetto boundary, the future ghetto\nboundary. The Jews really occupied densely, the area from Balloot mart -- market -- going this\nway, which would be -- this map is very wrong. This is north, okay?",
        "Q: Right, right, so going north.",
        "A: Going north. The center of the city was the s -- [indecipherable] 1s Freedom Square\n[indecipherable]. And that -- the densely populate -- the poorer Jews lived between Belt mark --\nmarket and that\u2019s [indecipherable] more or less here. That -- that was Balotte, or Balote. This is\nthe old part of Lodz. And the new part of Lodz was centered more or less around Pietma Center\nPiotkowska with all -- the sizes are not shown, this densely [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And this was all Jewish populated. So you see us who come out here, that was very scarce.\nThis little street -- we -- I live on a dead end street, and our factory compound was actually\nclosing the street.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And how do you pronounce that? Quid --",
        "A: Kwizinska.",
        "Q: Kwizinska.",
        "A: While the Poles were very hard Polanizing, actually the original name of the city -- of the\nstreet was feesh -- the Germans named it during the 1917 occupation, Fishagossa. And then the\nPoles called it Walitsa Fishaira. Apparently Fisher must have been the man that started the\n[indecipherable]. But the Polanizing pressure came on, and everything got Polanized, so they\ndone away with Fisher, and they -- up til \u201939, a lot of people, Jews especially, still called it\nFishagossa, not Kwizinska.",
        "Q: And why is there a number one to five here?",
        "A: Because that\u2019s my legend. The legend 1s --",
        "Q: Oh I see, I see, right.",
        "A: -- one to five, fall 1924, til winter \u201939. And then January 20\", 1945 to October \u201945.",
        "Q: To October, right, okay.",
        "A: Because I left --",
        "Q: You just -- you left the places in this [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right, I left the -- I was born there, and I occupied a little of the premises til November,\nDecember *39. Then I relocated [indecipherable] 10 in the ghetto. And eventually, on the 19\" of\nJanuary, when I was liberated by the Red Army, I just went back home.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I spent, again, th-the period between January 20\" and October \u201945, or when I left Lodz\nand Poland permanent. I was again at Kwizinska in my original home.",
        "Q: And is your father here most of the time, or is he -- is the tan -- is the tannery moved?",
        "A: As of right now?",
        "Q: No, no, no. I mean, when you moved here [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well -- wa -- what -- wa -- wa --",
        "Q: Or maybe we should go back farther.",
        "A: Well, what happened was the tannery was -- my father was a person with no formal\neducation. He only attended a chaider, traditional chaider. However, he was self educated 1n his -\n- in his teens, he -- he was born into a very religious Orthodox family. My grandfather was a\nHassid, a follower of the Alexander [indecipherable] which makes him a real Hassid, he made\nannual pilgrimages to the court of the rabbi. I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re familiar with these\nthings, are you?",
        "Q: Well --",
        "A: I -- I mean, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m talking, but I don\u2019t know whether I should say these things --",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: -- because you know them, or whether --",
        "Q: No, no, you s -- just explain.",
        "A: And so my grandparents had -- my paternal grandparents had about eight, nine children. I\nbelieve five boys and -- six boys and two girls. And the boys were of the pretty independent\nmind, and my grandfather was a very strict person. Especially that -- back then -- we talk now\nabout the late 1800, beginning 1900, children were considered a labor asset. So as soon as the\nkids reached an age of let\u2019s say eight or so, my grandfather put them to work. And they worked\nfor him til they reached the age of reason, which would be something like 12 or 14, and at the\nage of 14, they simply disappeared. My father himself was the second born, and he run away\nfrom home at the age of 14. Pretty far, too. He run away all the way 300 miles away. And he\nstayed away til he was 19. At the age of 19 he was -- at the age of 14 he was self supporting. He\nhad the trade that he learned between the age of nine and 14 from my grandfather, in my\ngrandfather\u2019s shop. He was so good that he was hired as a expert, or experienced worker. And he\ndidn\u2019t come home til he was 19 where he could stand up to my grandfather.",
        "Q: And all the boys did this, they all --",
        "A: And all the boys except the youngest one, did the same thing.",
        "Q: Was he physically rough on them as a [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, corporal punishment was normal and expected and accepted. In addition, this is the\nperiod when you\u2019re going to look at it this way, that really Poland was feudal. Renaissance and\nthe Napoleonic era did not come to Russian occupied Poland at all. So Poland was basically\nfeudal. However, the Jews, western Jews and Russian Jews, embraced a movement called the\nHaskallah, if you\u2019re familiar with it.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you explain.",
        "A: Enlightenment. They felt that the future is in aligning themselves with the new era that went\nalong with the -- Napoleon\u2019s armies of education, of reaching for more material aims. So my\nfather, while I guess he was absent from home, he did embrace the Haskallah movement, the\nenlightenment and he taught himself how to read German, how to read Polish. He read -- was wi\n-- he read a lot Polish -- in Polish, a lot in German. Whether it was -- I don\u2019t think there was\nmuch choice, you read whatever was available. Even in my time, I read anything that was\navailable. I was not particular.",
        "Q: Tell me, did your father\u2019s sisters run away too, or was it [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, th-they stayed home. And then I think when my father was about 18 or 19, he embraced\nthe Tolstoyan philosophy. He became a follower of Leo Tolstoy. As you know, Leo Tolstoy was\nnot also a auth -- not also -- not only an author, but he also formed a specific way of life. I think\nthere\u2019s still a foundation somewhere upstate New York that was run by his sister -- fa -- by his\ndaughter, sure. I wa -- I passed by Binghamton and I saw si -- a sign on the outskirts of bir --\nBinghamton, something about Tolstoy and there is the foundation still there functioning. And\nthat\u2019s why my father, for example, ne -- was not a smoker. My father did not smoke, that was\npart of that Tolstoyan way of life. No whiskey [indecipherable] just didn\u2019t drink, either way. He\nwas not a glutton. That\u2019s again the Tolstoyan principle, don\u2019t overeat. Eventually he -- while he\nembraced it in his formative years, therefore it -- some of it, some principles of it stayed with\nhim for the remainder of his life. It also involved some intangibles like honesty, like\nforthrightness. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a way of life. Tolstoy formulated a complete way of life, to lead a\nclean life, both ways, physically and philosophically. Eventually my father became a member of\nthe bund, that was the Jewish Socialist Worker\u2019s movement. And he was capable, while my\nfather\u2019s ancestors, that\u2019s my grandfather, I imagine even people before my grandfather, were all\nleather tanners because in the medieval times, tanning was one of the few trades -- [phone\nringing] -- Is this going on?",
        "Q: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Oh. I didn\u2019t know, I thought we were just talking preparatory.",
        "Q: No, no, no, no.",
        "A: Tanning -- I don\u2019t know whether -- a-again, you know quite a bit about me because I sent\nsome materials. I don\u2019t know anything about you. I don\u2019t know how much knowledge and what\nareas of Jewish history is your expertise. So I\u2019m really --",
        "Q: You have to tell me everything, because you\u2019re not just talking to me. When you put\nsomething --",
        "A: But a -- but a -- I don\u2019t know how much am I repeating myself and it sounds to you like old --\nold story.",
        "Q: No, you misunderstand something. When you do something for an interview, even if I know\nthings, like what Haskallah 1s, it\u2019s very important that you explain, because you never know who\nis going to listen and what they understand. So you must explain as if I know very little. That\u2019s\nthe point.",
        "A: All right, let\u2019s -- let\u2019s make a deal.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: When I use a word like -- a term like Haskallah and then offer an explanation, if you know\nabout Haskallah, and you don\u2019t think that my explanation of [indecipherable] me stands for,\ncorrect me, cause I don\u2019t want to sound like a fool. So if you do know about Haskallah from\nother sources, am I correct in the way I presented it?",
        "Q: Yeah, I think it\u2019s a ger -- I mean, I\u2019m not -- I -- I -- I mean, I\u2019m not an expert in Jewish\nhistory.",
        "A: Well, it translates into --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- enlightenment, yeah.",
        "Q: Enlightenment, right.",
        "A: Anyway, going back to medieval times as we just should do, the medieval girls did not accept\nJews, and there were very few trades available permitted to the Jews. The Jews were limited to\nmoney changing, trade, some thing -- whatever. But not skilled craftsmen. One of the few\nexceptions in crafts and trades was leather tanning. It was dirty, was filthy, the way it was done\nin medieval times, and it required a great amount of skill. And apparently the medieval Gentile\nhad no inclination either to get himself all dirtied up with filthy rotting rawhides, nor put his\nmind to the comp -- to the complexities of tanning, converting a raw hide into a finished product.\nSo that was one of the trades open to Jews, and my grandfather was a medieval leather tanner.\nHowever, he did not make a go out of it in his adult -- young adulthood. And he had to support\nhis family by other means. My grandm other descended -- dese -- is a descendant of the first\nsettlers in Lodz. My grandmother\u2019s name -- maiden name was Lieverman, however there was,\nbecause there were so few Jews in [indecipherable] intermarriages in families were common, and\nher stepfather\u2019s name was Hanoch Lodzki -- Lodzki. Lodzki means, of Lodz. Therefore, if we go\nback to let\u2019s say 1820, when Jews only had the -- the given names, and they had to be identified\nby some kind of a surname or a handle, this was Hanoch from Lodz. Lodzk1 1s an adjective.",
        "Q: How do you spell it?",
        "A: Well, the word -- the letter L --",
        "Q: L with a slash.",
        "A: -- with a slash is pronounced ew, like a W.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s sky at the end?",
        "A: L-o-d-z-k-i.",
        "Q: K-1.",
        "A: And always a -- with a slash on top which makes it a U. Lodzki. Just like Jakuv could be\nspelled two ways. I can spell Jakuv with a U, or in Poland I did not spell Jakuv with a U. In\nPoland we spelled Jakuv with an O with a vertical slash above it. Poles use the U two different\nways. So his name was L6odzki which definitely puts his ancestry way back into the first settlers\nof Lodz. And he was quite -- and her family was quite prosperous. Apparently my grandfather\u2019s\nfamily was not prosperous. He was born in a little town of Skierniewice, somewhere within I\nwould say 20 - 30 mile. It\u2019s a hamlet. And the marriage must have been a brokered marriage, as\nall the marriages back then were. A usually young man went for the dowry. I mean, let\u2019s call a\nspade a spade. So apparently my grandmother\u2019s family was capable of offering a sizable dowry,\nand to satisfy the [indecipherable] family of my grandfather and the marriage took place with the\ncondition that my grandfather will move from Skierniewice to Lodz where her family will kind\nof see to it that they will be able to become economically viable. And they opened for him, or\npurchased for him, a grocery store somewhere -- Staramiasta, somewhere in this area. Barlutai\nwas farther down, Staramiasta was coming up. My grandfather was not successful as a\nbusinessman.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: He was very strong minded, and he did not appreciate his wife\u2019s family interference. So he\npicked up his wife and kiddies and went back to Skierniewice to get out from under his wife\u2019s\nparents\u2019 thumb.",
        "Q: Wait a minute, I just want to check something. Why don\u2019t you just talk for a moment here.\nJust --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. Want to just say hello?",
        "A: Hello.",
        "Q: Yeah, that\u2019s fine. Okay. All right, so he leaves, and went back to the he --",
        "A: And went back to Skierniewice, and all he could do there 1s pick up the leather tanning in that\nhamlet. And somehow that didn\u2019t work out either, economically. So --",
        "Q: Is that because all the sons left?",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- because it just -- either he didn\u2019t produce good enough leather commercially, he must have\nbeen behind his times in the product. So he came back into Lodz and started a upholstery shop.\nAnd that\u2019s where his boys were trained in upholstery business. And that\u2019s was my father\u2019s\noccupation or trade at the age of 14 when he ran away from home. He was a experienced\nupholsterer. He was hired to run a shop at the age of 14. That must have gone on til the war\nbroke out, the first World War. I don\u2019t know about the future wars, but in the past wars, the one I\nknow of, which is the first and the second World War, the minute the rumor of war starts, leather\nbecomes gold. And as soon as the war started, there was a scarcity of finished leather and my\ngrandfather went back to the original leather trade which all a sudden became very profitable.\nAnd I heard tales that he used to tan the hides in my grandmother\u2019s kitchen, if you can imagine\nthe kitchen. Well, it was illegal, because all this was black market, what we would call it in\nmodern terms. Back then it was just forbidden by authorities, so was -- you would buy some\nhides off a peasant and --",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: My dad came back si -- sometime in that -- at the end of that period, that means around 1916 -\n17. And he joined my grand -- the -- the leather trade. The demand for leather was so great and\nso profitable that all sudden all the sons engathered, and they all started producing leather. And\nall of them became knowledgeable in leather tanning. However, my father had the greater\nexpectations of himself and he single-handed made the leap from medieval to modern leather\ntanning. He taught himself German, and he read -- studied German biochemistry books, because\nthere are no book that relates specific to tanning. Maybe right now there are because we live in\nspecialized times, but back then if you want a formal education in that particular profession, you\nhad to go into it by chemistry. And the only biochemical -- biochemistry available was in\nGerman. And J still -- in th -- our house, my father continued try to improve his methods, he\ncontinued to receive from Germany, German textbooks in biochemistry. And he became -- he\nmade that transition from medieval to modern process. He became a master tanner, one of the\nbest known master tanners in all of Poland.",
        "Q: Now when you say master tanner, is that --",
        "A: All be like a boss. A master tanner would be somebody that knows the process, both ways.\nThe particular chemicals that -- and the -- the proportions, the mix of chemicals applied to each\nstage, and there are many stages, because you start off with a hairy piece of hide. First you got to\nget rid of the hair -- the hair, then you got to -- this -- and all si -- all this is done with a specific\nchemical. Some of these chemicals permeate the tissues, and before the next chemical is applied,\nthey had to be flushed out. So it is a complex knowledge, which he had to learn himself out of\nGerman textbooks.",

And installed in 1t modern leather tanning equipment imported from\nGermany.",
        "Q: And when does your father get married, and to whom does he marry?",
        "A: Oh, wait a minute, that was -- that was like in 1919, and because originally -- and originally\nthere\u2019s -- the plant was owned -- established and owned by my grandfather and my two older\nuncles, Israel and Simon. However, my rel -- my father\u2019s was [indecipherable] that\u2019s right,\nexcelled in the knowledge, both my grandfather and his brothers, so they hired him to become\nthe master tanner, in charge of the production. And you say -- asked me before what it was --\nmean to be a master tanner, master tanner means the -- being a -- the chemist, knowing the\nchemicals, the mix, the application and so on. In addition, the master tanner also has to know,\nand be able to instruct -- hired workers who had no skill in that trade, how to use the mechanical\npart of it because there were also machines that processed the product at different stages in\ndifferent ways. Some of them shaved it, because basically a hide 1s too thick, has to be more or\nless brought down to a specific thickness, especially that after tanning, the tissues do tend to\nswell. So if you start off with a raw hide, let\u2019s say like a quarter inch thick, after it\u2019s tanned, it\u2019s\nthree-quarters of an inch. Well, you can not use a finished product three-quarter of a inch thick\nfor a upper shoe, or for a pocketbook or a belt or anything else. So this had to be -- the thickness\nhad to be reduced by mechanical means, or shaved on a power machine. And then there was a\nmachine that would soften the leather because at some stage of the process they were coming out\nas hard as a board, and they have to be like, flexible. And that was done by a machine. And then\nthe final glaze was not a paint, but was applied again by heat, by a steel roller striking the face --\nthe grain of the leather that was prepared before with some type of preparation and that will\nproduce a glaze. So it was a mechanical process, therefore, a master tanner had not only be -- had\nto be not only knowledgeable in the chemical -- in the chemistry of it, but also in the mechanical\nin order to instruct or pass judgment on the performance of the workers. So that\u2019s a nutshell, is a\nmaster tanner. The man in charge of the entire production, knowledgeable in each phase. And by\n19 -- I believe \u201921, my father earned enough -- saved enough money. My father married, I\nbelieve in 1919, something like that, because my sister was born in 1921. And -- and around\n1921 - 1922, my father brought himself into the partnership. And moved into the factory\ncomplex. Up til then, while he was employed, he did not live on the premises. The premises\nthere -- the apartment building within the compound was restricted to owners only. As long as he\nwas not an owner, not a -- a matter of fact, he lived right on the corner, in an apartment on the\ncorner of the middle street. That will be 107 Demillaskaga. That\u2019s where my sister was born.\nThat\u2019s the way I\u2019m kind of trying to get the chronological data because I know my sister was\nborn on Demillaskaga 107 in a high -- rented apartment, while I was born three years later\nalready on Kwizinska on the premises of the compound. And by then my father became a partner\nto the [indecipherable] to the factory. And there just very few Jewish families, and I remember\nthem well. There was at 111 Yumanoskaga, which 1s just a few houses down, there was some\nkind of textile product plant, again with living quarters, owned by a family named Friedlander.\nThey were very wealthy. Must have been a very successful plant. Then going ho -- there was --\nbut there were no boys my age, there was a girl my sister\u2019s age, a daughter, and my sister was\nfriendly with her. Then going farther toward the outskirts, at about 137 - 140 Yumanoskaga was\nanother textile processing recycling plant, owned by a Jew named Osher. The reason I\u2019m naming\nthese names 1s because by the -- by the oddest quirk of fate, I came across these people many,\nmany years later. I came across the name of Osher, Heinrich Osher in the chronicles of Lodz\nghetto, that the -- put it in context, that there was a Heinrich Osher who married a Gentile\nwoman, and lived outside the ghetto, and that Pruschidsky puts together some kind of a story\nabout it. And I knew the man because the head of the family, Mr. Osher was a widower and he\nhad two sons of the first marriage, Heinrich was the youngest son of the first marriage, and they\nhad two children, a son and a daughter after the second marriage, and the son and daughter of the\nsecond marriage were my age -- the son was my age, and the daughter was my sister\u2019s age. So\nthat was another Jewish family when my sister already had two friends, girl friends, Jewish girl\nfriends. And I had at least one playmate. I would say up to the age of three or four, I played with\nGentile kids because Kwizinska was an odd street. There were only six residential properties on\nthe left side. The right side was a big fence with a wild garden behind it. So you\u2019 re talking about\nS1x properties, maybe 30 - 40 Gentile families, and us, the Jewish family, closing off the dead\nend street. And I played with the Gentile kids my age til I was about three or four. But once they\nreached the age of three or four, five, they already became permeated with the anti-Semitism at\nhome and church and they -- I became ostracized. They wouldn\u2019t play with me any more. And\nfrom then on I was leading a pretty solitary life. I had no playmates except when I would venture\nout to see that fellow Osher, his name was -- his name was Solomon.",
        "Q: Solomon?",
        "A: Yeah, we call him Sollik. He\u2019s alive and kicking in Israel [indecipherable] I heard about. And\nout of necessity -- now my -- now we talking [indecipherable] we talk about my father. My\nmother, in contrast to my father was a well educated person. My mother did not -- family did not\noriginate from Lodz. They were immigrants from Ukraine. And they came from a little town in\nukra -- western Ukraine named Schwub. My mother was born in Lodz. The Russian and\nUkrainian Jews were much -- were not Hassidic, and were much more for enlightment education.\nTherefore my mother attended a gimnasium, which is equivalent to high school, and graduated\nfrom a gimnasium. The gimnasium and the lyceum, that\u2019s the two additional years preparative\nfor college. My mother was fluent in Russian, both in speech and writing. My mother spoke\naccentless Polish, and wrote perfect, correct Polish, while my father never managed Polish at all\nand spoke broken Polish. My father\u2019s native language was Yiddish. He would navigate in Polish,\nbut it definitely was not the grammatical Polish.",
        "Q: Did your mother speak Yiddish as well?",
        "A: My mother no -- well, in addition to flawless Polish, perfect Russian, good German, not so\nmuch in language as in reading and writing, she spoke Yiddish in two dialects. With my father\u2019s\nfamily she spoke in Lodz Yiddish. With her family she spoke Litvok, Russian Yiddish. So my\nmother, out of -- I guess out of desperation having this kid four year or so old with no playmates,\nand I must have been pretty bright for my age, she taught me how to read. And I was reading\nfluently at the age of five. And I spend my ti -- in Poland\u2019s first grade -- there was no\nkindergarten, first grade started at the age of seven, not six. So between five and seven, I spend\nmy time between reading whatever was available, and using the plant, the factory, as my\nplayground. And early on I dif -- developed an affinity to hang out in the machine shop. And I\nmust have a inclination, inborn inclination to work in mechanical things. Early on I achieved\ndexterity in mechanical capabilit -- whatever mechanical. Because of all the places in the shop,\nand the -- the -- we employed about 20 some employees, it wa -- wasn\u2019t a great big factory. And\neverybody knew me because they -- th -- the workers, that was not much of a -- what would you\nsay, leaving and hiring, the workers are permanent. A matter of fact, I had a picture here of a di -\n- end -- entire factory group, the crew, with three men that knew me -- Gentile Poles that knew\nme since day I was born. And that picture was taken in 1946, so you can imagine there were --\nonce you got a job in a -- 1n that factory, in -- especially in -- in my f -- in a -- in a factory, in a\nplace of work that was supervised by my father, you were never fired. You could quit. If you\nwere fired, you were fired for -- you had to be a real bad person to be fired. My father did not\nbelieve in firing people, that\u2019s part of his Tolstoy principle. Matter of fact, to [indecipherable]\nand -- and leap ahead, about 1937 I believe, the Polish parliament passed a law outlawing ritual\nslaughter. I don\u2019t [indecipherable] but there was an anti-Semitic woman representative, in the\n[indecipherable] which is equivalent Polish to parliament. She put the bill, presented a bill to the\n-- saying that the ritual slaughter is inhuman. And the bill pass, and all the Jewish butchers went\nout of business. And my father on principle, even though we didn\u2019t need any more help at that\ntime, hired, I think four ex-butchers, because after all, they lost their livelihood, and being\nbutchers, they were at least familiar and [indecipherable] hide were not odious to them. So he\nhired them. So anyway -- and th-these Gentile workers -- we had Jewish workers, too, I would\nsay there was about eight or 10 Jewish employees. Some Hassidic Jews, but [indecipherable]\nvery specialized trades. And the rest was about 17 or so Gentiles. And I just toddled around\nbetween them, they all kept me out of trouble, seeing I don\u2019t wind up in a pit, salting pit and -- or\nin the jaws of a -- a machine. But of all the places that I liked best was the machine shop. Why\nthe mechanic let me handle tools and do things and help him. I really loved -- I had an affinity to\nmechanical things. And then by the age of seven, I was -- became of school age and in Poland\nelementary school was compulsory education. However, the Poles -- the Polish authorities\npreferably had s -- did not preferably -- would not mix Jews with Gentiles. So therefore, if you\nrun into a survivor out of Poland who will say that he attended a school, elementary school or\neven a high school with Gentiles together, he -- or she is from a small town where there was not\nenough of a Jewish population for a segregated school. In Lodz, with 250,000 Jews, there was no\nproblem whatsoever. Therefore, I was assigned to a all Jewish public elementary school, located\non Ribna one-three, which is inside the ghetto some of -- one of the streets there 1s Ribna Street.\nMatter of fact, on Ribna there -- there -- 1t was so much oppos -- in the middle of the s -- of a\ncenter of Jewish population that there were really two schools, one a -- two buildings, separate\nbuildings. One at Ribna one-three, and the other one was Ribna 15. Each one first to seven grade.\nEach one a converted, old, beat up apartment house. This in spite of the fact that as you walked\ndown Kwizinska and hit the intersection with Yumanoskaga, across the street, directly across the\nstreet was a brand new, beautiful, elementary school, built specifically for school purposes. And\nI could have attended it with a five minute walk, but that was for Poles, for Gentiles only. So\ntherefore I had to take a -- I lived up here, I had to board a trolley car and tr-travel I would say\nabout 20 minutes on a trolley car to Ribna, which would be -- this is Balskirinik, it\u2019s somewhere\nright before Balskirinik, because it was during the war in the ghetto boundary. Well, the\neducation in that school wasn\u2019t very good, because the salaries paid to the teachers were\nminimal. That was state funded school. And we did have in the city of Lodz, our own Jewish\nprivate school system. Unfortunately it was in town. And there was no way to send a seven year\nold one on three different trolley cars to go to school. So I spend my first two years attending the\nfirst grade, second grade in this school on Ribna, and by the age of 10 my mother decided I\u2019m\nbig enough or bright enough or whatever, to be able to travel, take three different trolley cars,\nand I was signed in to a private Jewish school on Hermoska 48. It was a non-profit school by a --\noperated by a s-society dedicated to spreading knowledge and technical capability among Jews.\nTherefore, it consisted of two separate schools. One wa -- was teaching first grade all the way to\nlyceum. That\u2019s the 12\" year, classic, normal curriculum. The other section was technical and had\ntwo departments, textile and mechanical. Well I start out then dar -- the separation happened on -\n- was offered to the student who from -- graduating from sixth grade. The first -- the elementary\nschool was just one type. So I attended the -- the third, fourth, fifth and sixth grade elementary\nschool in that particular school on Hermoska 48. I was doing very well in school. I was class\npresident for four years running, and put in the public school system --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: The homeroom teacher was more -- had more activity, participated more with the student\nbody than the homeroom teacher in the United States the way I know it, and I do know what the\nhomeroom teacher in the United States does because my youngest daughter is a schoolteacher.\nThe homeroom teacher will be assigned this particular homeroom, a group of students, and you\nwould follow them all the way. That means if you acquired a homeroom teacher, let\u2019s say in the\nfirst year of high school, you had him til you graduated. And he knew you thoroughly. And he\ndealt with the student body through the class president. So my function was not just a title, but\nthere was a specific activity. I was the go-between. The way the chain of command went, if a\nvisiting teacher let\u2019s say, math, geography, whatever, had a problem with a student, he would\nfirst try to deal himself, or herself with the student. Didn\u2019t get anywhere he\u2019d turn to the\nhomeroom teacher. The homeroom teacher would turn to the class president and say what are we\ngoing to do about this kid? And again the oddest quirk of fate, my homeroom teacher in high\nschool was a man named Nahoum Blumenthal. And Nahoum Blumenthal is of [indecipherable]\nand Yad Vashem employment. I came across some monographs and some ar -- articles and I\nthink couple books published by Yad Vashem with a Nahoum Blumenthal byline. Isn\u2019t that the\noddest thing in the world? And I know it\u2019s him because we had terrific relationship the two of us\nfor the two years running before the war, 38 - \u201939, and then he disappeared during the war. In\n1945 sometime early summer I\u2019m walking on Piotkowska, principle street, and I\u2019m running into\nProfessor Blumenthal, my teacher. And we stopped and we chatted and we remembered the old\ntimes when I was the pupil and he was the teacher, and I asked him what he is doing and he said\nhe just arrived from unit -- from the Soviet Union where he survived the war, and he was\nworking for the Jewish Historical Society, and the Jewish Historical Society was transferred\nfairly recently to Lodz and he 1s -- he just arrived in Lodz and he\u2019s working for the Jewish\nHistorical Society. So I pretty sure that anything appearing with the name of Nahoum\nBlumenthal out of Yad Vashem would be the same individual because eventually I imagine as --\nI -- I don\u2019t think he stayed any longer than 1956 in Poland, because 1956 was when Gomoka\nopened up a -- the borders for the Jews, and a lot of Jews left.",

        "Q: Did you think about keeping a diary?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Did you think about it?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No. Because -- because I kept no diary, why the events are very strong in my mind. As you\nsee that my -- I got a memory like an elephant. I wish I wouldn\u2019t. I -- I with to God that I\nwouldn\u2019t. I mean things are -- when I -- I -- I -- I-I -- I can see pi -- pictures in my mind like a\nfilm running. I spoke today -- this morning at breakfast, I spoke with my friend in Silver Spring,\nand I say to him, Henry, do you remember I -- no, said to him, \u201cHenry, I finally pinpointed the\nexact day of the -- the d -- exact date of the day of interegnam, when we spent the day together\nwith the city laying dead in front of us.\u201d He says, \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d And I say to him -- and\nbecause -- and I cou -- I did prepare myself for this interview because of the chronological\nproblems of events. I don\u2019t want to confuse it. According to the Pruschidsky, that\u2019s the\nchronicles, the Polish army pulled out September sixth, evacuated. The Germans entered\nSeptember eighth. Now that gives me the date that I spent with Henry. I spent with Henry the\nday of the seventh of September. He lived on Piotkowska 20, which is center of the city, and I\nlived on the outskirts. I remember it like now, was a beautiful, sunny day, cloudless. And the city\nwas dead. No vehicular traffic, no trolley cars running, hardly any people in the streets. And I\nmade my way all the way from my home, all the way down [indecipherable] down, down\n[indecipherable] up to Piotkowska 20, and I went up and we spend day together, went on the\nstreets, we walked the streets, and I didn\u2019t get home til about five o\u2019clock, and my mother\nthought that I already am gone permanently because there was a drive to move eastward. And\nshe thought that I met some -- with some fellows in town and we decided to go before the\nGermans enter. So that\u2019s how the war started. There were rumors before the war about the -- the\nprobability. I remember pikou -- I was always a voracious reader even though I did develop a\nsocial life, my primary entertainment and preoccupation was reading. I remember sometime in\nthe summer of \u2019?39, I came across a book called, \u201cThe Brown Book,\u201d which described the\natrocities committed by the germa -- by the Nazis on the German Jews. Dachau concentration\ncamp. With pictures. And I remember taking the book down the factory yard where my father\nwas kind of circulating, and stopping my father in his work and saying, \u201cDad, take a look what I\njust picked up at the library.\u201d And I sh -- opened it up and showed him the pictures and some\ncaptions, how the Jews are being maltreat -- German Jews are being maltreated by the Nazis.\nAnd I say, \u201cDad, what\u2019s going to happen when the Germans will arrive? When the war starts,\nthen Germans will come here.\u201d And my father\u2019s answer was typical of the [indecipherable]\ngenerations. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI dealt with the Germans in 1917 - \u00b018. You can do business with\nthe Germans.\u201d Very significant.",

And if a Jew came with some kind of a\nproblem to be corrected into a state run office, if he spoke with an accented Polish, he was\nridiculed, he was disregarded, he wasn\u2019t even given the proper attention. So my mother was --\nany time there was a problem with any kind of state office, and the operation of the factory, my\nmother was delegated to go down and deal with the bureaucrats because her Polish was a\nflawless Polish.

Cause the [indecipherable] Nazis would be black uniforms, either SS -- well, SS.\nWhatever. They were Wehrmacht. And they came with -- money was no problem and all of a\nsudden business was booming. And there was this stream of Germans coming in, and I became\ninured to the fact that the German in a green uniform is in a way, harmless. Can you see that\ncomplacency?",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t -- you did not think about danger.",
        "A: Right, cause I realized that we Jews are like a homeless dog, outside the law. Now no laws\napplied. I was at one time, some time I would say in end of September, some Germans came to\nthe house, into the plant on a weekend when the factory was shut down. And they knocked on\nthe apartment doors. And they wore civi -- civilian clothes but wore Nazi armbands, with the\nswastika. And they were looking for young men. And they grab me and escorted me, took me\ndown to a nearby high school complex, and I was made -- German refugees from the eastern\nterritories were arriving into Lodz because under the Soviet German pact, any German that lived\nwa -- east of Bug river, in the Russian occupied territory was free to leave with as much\nbelonging as he wanted to. And many of these Germans fled. And they arrived, among other\ncities, they arrived in Lodz. And that\u2019s where the problem started for the Jews, in the center of\nthe city because all a sudden, end of September, October, there are hundreds of German families\narriving in Lodz, trying -- and the German authorities desperate to try to find a place for them to\nlive, so the logical answer for them was throw the Jews out of their housing, and offer the\nhousing to the refugee Germans. But they wouldn\u2019t go into Baloote, because the housing in\nBaloote was no running water, no indoor plumbing. So these Jews in Baloote, the poor Jews,\nthey were left alone. And it was the upper scale Jews, occupying the new sections and the new\nareas that had running water, that had indoor plumbing, that were the first ones to suffer of being\ntossed out su-summarily out of their apartments. So I was taken down to that relocation center.\nGermans were arriving and I -- there was a -- there was a group of Jews, young Jews, dragged in\nfrom God knows where. I didn\u2019t know anybody. And th -- we\u2019re told to -- they were arriving by\ntrolley cars, apparently from the train station. And we were told to help them. So I carried the\nsuitcases and bags from the sidewalk into the interior of the school, was [indecipherable] it was\ngym or something. And work for about two or three hours and then there was a break and -- in\nthe transports, and I was invited to whatever I -- ask would want some refreshment. Just like the\nrefugee -- refugees. There were the coffee urns, or whatever, and go ahead and have a sandwich,\nand so. But on the other hand, one day I was walking the street, I was grabbed by a German who\nhad no identity -- no identification at all. I don\u2019t know even know whether he was a German. But\nhe say, hey you there, grabbed me out -- by the arm and he said, \u201cI need you.\u201d And he drive me\nto his house and made me move some furniture for him. I mean, we were like a homeless dog.\nBut that still didn\u2019t stop me from --",
        "Q: From moving around.",
        "A: -- from moving around because these -- these things done to me, were not like an organized\nsystematic, but we knew that we Jews can be treated anyway an individual German wants to treat\nus, but basically I was treated fairly decently. I was never abused, let\u2019s put it this way, even when\nthey grabbed me for something. And this brings me to a very interesting point. That -- because\nthat was the last time when I was permitted to travel the streets. From then on I became a\nprisoner in the compound. According to, again the Pruschidsky, on November 11\", the Germans\ndestroyed the statue of Kosciuszko that was placed on Plac Wolnosci in the center of the city.",
        "Q: That\u2019s Freedom Square, right?",
        "A: Freedom Square, right. It was a horse mounted Kosciuszko -- I think the horse was on two\nlegs, two hind legs and Kosciuszko the big saver, and this -- this -- the horse and the rider were\non top of a pedestal, like a -- I would say octagonal. A very large one, possibly 30 feet diameter.\nIt was a very massive pedestal. [indecipherable] support, but -- and each panel of the oc --\noctagon depicted different feats in life of Kosciuszko. And apparently this was made out of\nbronze, were bronze relief panels. And that was my -- ah, no -- so once I read this, the whole\nevent came to my mind. I had a date, and I went with my date to the movies.",
        "Q: This is the girlfriend, this 1s the same girlfriend?",
        "A: Right, same girlfriend.",
        "Q: What\u2019s her name?",
        "A: I was going steady. Her name was Rainya -- my God, just told Henry.",
        "Q: Well, it\u20191] come back.",
        "A: I met her in \u201938. So I met her and we went to the movies, I remember the name of the movie\ntheater, Bika, which means fairy tale.",
        "Q: What does it mean?",
        "A: Fairy tale.",
        "Q: Fairy tale.",
        "A: Yeah, Bika in Polish 1s fairy tale. And we went to the movies, we saw the picture. It was\nsomewhere on the outskirts, and must have been shortly before the curfew and I didn\u2019t take her\nhome. We parted company one point, she went up, and I went up, and I tell you my way down\nagain Nowomiejska, was Skerska and somewhere before I even hit Skerska, which is an\nextension of Nowomiejska, I get stopped by a uniformed German patrol. And they bring my\nback to Pazelnofscha and I see a group of people working at the Kosciuszko statue. And I\u2019m\nbeing ordered to take my overcoat off, this was November, pretty cold, put a pile of overcoats\nand join the workers. So I joined the workers, and there were some with [indecipherable] tools,\nchisels, sledge hammers, were banging away and trying to separate these bronze panels away\nfrom the concrete. And I worked til about two a.m. At two a.m., I guess the Germans got tired --\nand they were decent enough, there was a non-com -- it was a military unit, and it was a non-com\nin charge, and he said, \u201cOkay Jews, go home, that\u2019s the end, the end of the day.\u201d And we said,\n\u201cHow we going to go home, it\u2019s a curfew and we will get arrested on the way home.\u201d And he\nwas nice enough to get ahold of a bunch of slips and s -- write something 1n German and hand\nout to each one of us. Here, here. You show it -- anybody stops you, you show it to him, you\u2019ll\nbe all right. So I went home and that was the end of my -- my parents withdrew permission for\nme to leave the factory compound from then on, that\u2019s November 11\", I was virtually\nimprisoned.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: You can imagine the [indecipherable], and -- and there was also already talk, gossip, that the\nJewish businesses are going to be confiscated. So my father was looking for a tame or captive\nGerman to kind of be the front man.",
        "Q: What word --",
        "A: Be a front man.",
        "Q: Yeah, I know, but what word did you use?",
        "A: Captive, na -- tame.",
        "Q: A tame\u201d?",
        "A: Yeah, a tame German, yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, a tame German, I see.",
        "A: Tame, ye -- captive, yeah. And -- and again, an odd coincidence that in 19 -- between 1935\nand 1938, my father did not work with his partners at this location, but around a tannery, in a -- a\nrented tannery in Erda Parbenietska, which is oh, somewhere in this direction.",
        "Q: North. North of --",
        "A: I -- yeah, there was Parbienietsa and there was Erda Parbenietska, two separate townships\nadjoining Lodz, with [indecipherable] running [indecipherable] platzi -- this was Platzia Monta.\nIt\u2019s not marked, but this junction is called -- was called Platzia Monta. It was Platzia Monta, Plaz\nBaranik, Plaz Bowtski. At these two junctions the city -- there were two separate trolley car\ncompanies. One was inner city, had their own trolley cars, their own colors, and there was the\nsuburban, which had their own trolley cars, different shape, different size, and different color.\nAnd they were running out of [indecipherable] Platzia Monta outwards. These were the junction\npoints where you transferred.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So my father worked in a rented tannery. And that tannery belonged to a German, wealthy\nGerman family, well known in Lodz, named Ranka. And one of their in-law, named Rudolf\nStribel, he was kind of appointed to run that tannery some time in the 30\u2019s, I -- early 30\u2019s and he\nwas not a tanner, he was a bookkeeper [indecipherable] bookkeeper, he was a bookkeeper. And\nhe ran the tannery down the ground, and his in-laws shut it down. And it was vacant and my\nfather teamed up with another merchant, and they rented the tannery, and started producing.",
        "Q: So he -- so he\u2019s not running two tanneries, now, he\u2019s closed down --",
        "A: No, he lets his brothers -- no, no, he left --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- he stepped out of the --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That was -- there were differences, serious differences between my father and his brothers and\nin 1935 he reached a point where he just chucked it.",
        "Q: But you\u2019re still living in the compound?",
        "A: But we -- yes, right, while he was not participating any more either in the production or the\nproceeds of the plant, we were still owners to the property and therefore we still occupied our\napartment. So when they rented that tannery Erda Parbenietska, this fellow, str -- Rudolf Stribel,\ncame around a-and introduced himself that he is the son-in-law of the owners of the property and\nhe\u2019s a bookkeeper, and would we -- would my father need a bookkeeper? And my father and his\npartner said yes. Especially that he was skilled in that particular kind of bookkeeping because he\nwas doing the bookkeeping for the previous operators of the tannery. So they hired him, and he\nworked for them for -- between \u00b035 and \u00b038. In \u201938 they quit that, gave up [indecipherable] ran\nout and they came back, both my father and his then partner, to the Kwizinska. Actually, what\nhappened is that partner of my father bought one of my uncles out, and my grandfather. So there\nwas a change in the make-up of partners. So at that point when some of the Germans that were\ncoming in were kind of not nice, and there was rumors of being -- Jewish properties being\nconfiscated, my parents -- well, the adults started looking for solutions, and one solution that\nbecame immediately apparent was get hold of Stribel and find out what he is doing. And they --\nthey found him, and there he is I would say two months into the German occupation, still\nwalking next to his shoes. Apparently he did not benefit in the first eight weeks from being a\nsuperior German.",
        "Q: What do you mean he was walking --",
        "A: Next to his shoes. With holes in his soles.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: He was still pretty poor shape. Couldn\u2019t latch on anything, and at that point they offered him a\njob, that first of all he would be a front man. He will deal with the Germans. And he accepted it\neagerly, anything, hey. And it was a -- going with mixed results because he really had no official\nstanding, so some -- while most of the Germans would kind of act more s -- in a more subdued\nmanner when they would deal with him, others were bolder enough to say, who are you and what\nare you doing, what are you, a Jewish servant? And it would even make the situation worse. So it\nwas a mixed blessing, but it -- it worked to some extent, and business was good. I mean, money\nwas rolling in like crazy. And then all a sudden some time again, I would say by November, the\nGermans established, confiscated officially -- there was a decree out of Berlin confiscating all\nJewish property and establishing a special office to handle Jewish property. And administer\nJewish property. It was called in German, De treuhand stellech. Treuhand means an honest hand,\ntreu honest hand. And the administrators were named Treuhande. So the adults, the partners got\non Stribel, and say hey Stribel, you better go down to Posum -- Posun, I -- which was the seat of\nthe -- by then naturally, Lodz was incorporated into Bartigo and we became thoroughly\nGermanized, all the vestiges of pole -- Polish [indecipherable] were gone. We became a German\ncity in Germany.",
        "Q: [inaudible]",
        "A: Bartigo, with Posun becoming the capital of the province. So we kind of -- the adults said,\nhey Stribel, you better go down to Posun and apply for the job of treuhande for this factory. And\nhe kind of hemmed and hawed. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know why he was timid about it. I -- I\nremember it because I was partic -- I wasn\u2019t participating, but I was present to the conversations.\nThe space was limited. The office was the office, big deal. But he went off. He went off, he came\nback I think two or three days beaming, with official papers, naming him that administra --\nofficial administrator of the factory. At that point they sat down the partners with him and they\nwrote a private agreement where he recognize the current owners as the true owners and he will\nonly act as their representative, while representing the German office. And he recognizes the\nright of the owners to participate in profits. It was like a private arrangement. At the same time,\nwhile this was going on and Stribel\u2019s presence became kind of more official standing, he could\ndeal better with the -- whoever arrived to purchase the leather, and the Jews kept in the\nbackground. Being in Bartigo -- located in Bartigo, in a German city, because all vestiges of\nPolish rule disappeared. The cit -- there was the Polish police disappeared. The shupari a-\nappeared, they were imported. Shup is the [indecipherable] the law and order, all the German\ninstitutions, and then we had -- at same time were -- became aware that not all of occupied\nPoland was incorporated, that the Germans just took the western part and formed three\nprovinces, us being the center one, Bartigo. However, the eastern part is called general\ngovernment, and there 1s -- the Polish rule prevails, the Polish police, national police is still in\ncharge in their navy blue uniforms. Polish schools are being active. Polish language is --\nlanguage 1s the official language. So all things be equal, we assumed that between -- that the\nJewish fate in the hands of the Germans is going to be much worse in area incorporated directly\ninto Germany, than in -- into area that is only temporarily occupied by the Germans for the\nduration of the war, with its fate decided after the war.",
        "Q: Now how did you find out about what was going on in the general government?",
        "A: There was travel going on, back and forth. Well, there was also 1 -- let\u2019s -- let\u2019s say that there\nwas actually a four -- there was an exodus of Jews out of Lodz at least three -- three times. The\nfirst exodus was immediately following the Polish army as it evacuated. A lot of Jews left,\nespecially Jews with -- who were Communists or Communist followers. And -- because they --\nwe already heard that the Russians are coming in from the other side, and the first wave of the\nJews that left Lodz, the young men especially, kept on going. And went all the way across the\nBug river to the Russians, to the Reds. And the other part of the wave, the middle edge, were the\nones that were cash liquid -- had liquidity and they left hoping that the Germans weren\u2019t\n[indecipherable] the Poles will at one point resist. So that the first wave. That right away reduced\nthe po -- Jewish population of Lodz. And then there was the second wave, when L\u00e9dz was\nincorporated into Third Reich, and we became aware that eastern occupied territories are general\ngovernment, so that was a second wave of emigration of Jews out of Lodz. Again, the ones that\nwere cash liquid. You had to have liquidity to leave. So while we\u2019re sitting in the tannery,\nmaking hands over fist, we considered -- I\u2019m talking about adults -- that the state 1s going to be\ntemporary, and very temporary. That very soon we\u2019ll have to move on and being of a kind of a\nmind that looks ahead and doesn\u2019t wait for things to happen, just like the way we hired that\nGerman before we had to, we started looking for alternatives. It so happened that my mother\u2019s\nbrother, who was operating a very successful establishment on the corner of [indecipherable]\nNowomiejska. He had like a sweet shop, lunchroom, whatever, but very successful. He -- and he\nwas able to pull out a lot of cash from the banks before the Jewish accounts were frozen. I\nremember him boasting, showing -- opening up a shoebox full with currency, high domina --\ndenomination currency, telling to -- telling my mother in my presence, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about\nmoney, because in this box there\u2019s enough for both our families to survive the war.\u201d They were\nchildless.",
        "Q: They were what?",
        "A: They were childless. He was a younger brother, my mother\u2019s younger brother and they were\nchildless. So the adults somehow organized, I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t remember how, but\norganized an apartment, some housing in a town called Tomashuv Mazovyetski. And that was\nalready rented through emissaries. And it was sop -- the component that\u2019s supposed to eventually\noccupy these premises rented in that town Tomashuv Mazovyetski was my mother\u2019s brother with\nhis wife, a childless couple, my parents with their children, that means my sister and me. And my\nUncle Simon with his wife and again, son and a daughter. The son was born in 1910, was 14\nyears older than I, he was already a -- part time into medical studies in Belgium. And his\ndaughter was my -- about old as my sister. Not very much older. So that was the component that\nwas going to go to m -- settle in Tomashuv Mazovyetski when things come to an end at the\ntannery. But somehow they didn\u2019t want to come to an end. The money was good and was still\nfairly safe haven. However, my uncle, the one that -- my mother\u2019s side, he was [indecipherable]\nat loose ends. He lost his business. So the decision was that part of the component will go off to\nTomashuv, the ones that are not necessary. That means my father and mother will stay on, my\nUncle Simon and his wife will stay on, and everybody, the youngsters, my sister and I in early\nteens and my cousins in their late teens or early 20\u2019s will leave for Tomashuv under the\nsupervision of the two adults.",
        "Q: Now, which two adults then?",
        "A: My father\u2019s -- my mother\u2019s brother and his wife --",
        "Q: Wife.",
        "A: -- that childless couple.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And there was already a truck hired, and I remember an afternoon some time in November,\npossibly mid-November or so, the truck was in the factory yard and the -- they [indecipherable]\nafter the work stopped, being loaded with basic furniture, bedsteads, mattresses, and -- and\nbedding and all our spare clothing, winter clothing, I mean you name it. Just bare necessities left\nbehind because everybody\u2019s already going and the only ones that are staying just for another few\nweeks, is my father and my mother, and my Uncle Simon and his wife, for as long as the\nbusiness is good and can be milked. And once the truck got all loaded up with all the goods and\nnow came the turn for the -- for humans to get loaded up and first my cousins hopped on, and\nthen my sister went up on the tailgate, and she was in, and I was the last one. There is my uncle\nand my aunt standing, and my mother and my father, and naturally Uncle Simon and his wife.\nAnd I\u2019m the last one to get on the truck, the tailgate, and my Aunt Ida turns to my mother and\nsays, \u201cHim I don\u2019t take. He\u2019s too nasty and he\u2019s too fussy, I don\u2019t want him. Ill take Mary, but I\nwon\u2019t take him. I won\u2019t put up with him.\u201d And the truck went off without me.",
        "Q: She hadn\u2019t said this before, how you --",
        "A: No. Well, I was --",
        "Q: Did anybody argue --",
        "A: -- maybe that -- pardon?",
        "Q: -- did -- did anybody argue?",
        "A: There -- there was no point of arguing. I mean, she was a supervising adult, if she turned her\nthumbs down on me, that\u2019s it. And besides, it wasn\u2019t that critical, because after all, the bulk of\nthe people went, and the bulk of the goods, it was the goods that -- and the leftover to follow\nwould be only lightly encumbered, because all the stuff went.",
        "Q: Now there\u2019s no problem about going, apparently, right? They\u2019re not -- they\u2019re not stopped?",
        "A: Apparently no --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and they arrived safe in Tomashuv, and it turned out that things in Tomashuv were terrible.\nThe housing, the food, or whatever, the -- both the Gentile and the Jewish native population was\nresentful of the newcomers, and now I stayed behind. I was happy. I didn\u2019t want to go. I -- that\nwas ma -- my playground, there is the plant, my factory and I was happy to stay behind. And that\nwas sometime in de -- late December, or beginning of January. I was standing in the factory yard\nas usual during the day, and my father was standing in factory yard in the snow. And the gate\nOpens up and my sister bursts through the gate and grabs my father by his neck and starts kissing\nhim, saying \u201cTatish, Tatish, I love you.\u201d And behind her comes my cousin Manasha. And that\u2019s\nit, just two of them. And we start asking what\u2019s what, and Manasha, who was older, he was in his\n20\u2019s already, he explained that things were unbearable at Tomashuv, there was a lot of friction\namong the -- the family itself, and friction with the neighbors, both Jews and Gentiles, with the\nindigenous neighbors and the newcomers. And finally Manasha -- Manasha took sick and there\nwas no doctor up there and when he got well he decided to go back home. And my sister Mary\ndecided to go with him; not his sister. And they made their way back, I would say about --\nthrough the winter snows, at least 130 - 150 miles, hitchhiking or just walking, traveling along\nthe highways. But they made it back home.",

The housing -- the hou -- apartment house was occupied by partners and\nfamily only. So I was actually born in the tannery, on the same yard. And the tannery was a --\nmy playground, considering that we lived on the outskirts of L\u00e9dz -- in Poland there was no such\nthing as suburbs, a city just gradually tapered out. And it -- a leather tannery being a smelly and\npretty dirty business, was by necessity located somewhere where -- pretty far out, away from the\ncenter.",
        "A: I'd say it\u2019s a very complex process. You start the -- actually, leather 1s a -- they\u2019re two\nseparate words. We start out with the hide, and when we say hide, we mean a skin of an animal\nbeginning from the time when it\u2019s removed from the carcass up til the tissues are saturated with\nsome chemical that will stop it from deteriorating or rotting. That means -- we call it a hide. That\npart of process -- and 1 -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a length -- it takes even today with modern methods, it\ntakes anywhere from four to six weeks to process a hide into a finished product. And the reason I\nsay today because in 1946 - \u201947, I worked in a leather tannery in Philadelphia, for two years. And\nthe process was virtually identical. Matter of fact, the machine I worked, I -- I was assigned to,\nthe particular machine, was identical with the machine that we had back home, there was\nvirtually no difference. The same machine, same thing, same way, same method. So, ou call a\nhide all the way up to the tanning process. The minute it\u2019s tanned, that means the tissues are\npermeated with some chemical, from then on it\u2019s leather. And all consecutive stages of it, we\ntalk in terms of leather. The tannery was my playground because there were only the Jews of\nLodz resided in the city, in center city. And as you went out to the peripheries, there were less\nand less Jews. The peripheries were populated by blue collar Gentiles. Especially that the native\nPoles were a minority in Lodz. Lodz had close to a million population, something like 800,000.\nThere was about 250,000 Jews, about a hun -- 200,000 native Germans, which was termed in\nGerman the Volksdeutsch. So the Poles were really a minority. They were hi -- and there were\nstreets in the city, when we talk about the city, where -- apartment houses where the only Gentile\nwas the janitor. The entire apartment house complex was part -- occupied by Jewish families. For\ninstance, the friend of mine with whom I\u2019m staying right now in Silver Spring he lived on\nPiotkowska 20, which is center city. And it was a gigantic apartment house, two courtyards,\nhouse at least six, 800 apartments. And the only Pole was the janitor.",

My grandfather was a\nHassid, a follower of the Alexander [indecipherable] which makes him a real Hassid, he made\nannual pilgrimages to the court of the rabbi.

And the boys were of the pretty independent\nmind, and my grandfather was a very strict person. Especially that -- back then -- we talk now\nabout the late 1800, beginning 1900, children were considered a labor asset. So as soon as the\nkids reached an age of let\u2019s say eight or so, my grandfather put them to work. And they worked\nfor him til they reached the age of reason, which would be something like 12 or 14, and at the\nage of 14, they simply disappeared. My father himself was the second born, and he run away\nfrom home at the age of 14. Pretty far, too. He run away all the way 300 miles away. And he\nstayed away til he was 19. At the age of 19 he was -- at the age of 14 he was self supporting. He\nhad the trade that he learned between the age of nine and 14 from my grandfather, in my\ngrandfather\u2019s shop. He was so good that he was hired as a expert, or experienced worker. And he\ndidn\u2019t come home til he was 19 where he could stand up to my grandfather.",
        "A: And all the boys except the youngest one, did the same thing.",
        "A: Well, corporal punishment was normal and expected and accepted. In addition, this is the\nperiod when you\u2019re going to look at it this way, that really Poland was feudal. Renaissance and\nthe Napoleonic era did not come to Russian occupied Poland at all. So Poland was basically\nfeudal. However, the Jews, western Jews and Russian Jews, embraced a movement called the\nHaskallah, if you\u2019re familiar with it.",

So my\nfather, while I guess he was absent from home, he did embrace the Haskallah movement, the\nenlightenment and he taught himself how to read German, how to read Polish. He read -- was wi\n-- he read a lot Polish -- in Polish, a lot in German. Whether it was -- I don\u2019t think there was\nmuch choice, you read whatever was available. Even in my time, I read anything that was\navailable. I was not particular.",
        "A: No, th-they stayed home. And then I think when my father was about 18 or 19, he embraced\nthe Tolstoyan philosophy. He became a follower of Leo Tolstoy. As you know, Leo Tolstoy was\nnot also a auth -- not also -- not only an author, but he also formed a specific way of life. I think\nthere\u2019s still a foundation somewhere upstate New York that was run by his sister -- fa -- by his\ndaughter, sure. I wa -- I passed by Binghamton and I saw si -- a sign on the outskirts of bir --\nBinghamton, something about Tolstoy and there is the foundation still there functioning. And\nthat\u2019s why my father, for example, ne -- was not a smoker. My father did not smoke, that was\npart of that Tolstoyan way of life. No whiskey [indecipherable] just didn\u2019t drink, either way. He\nwas not a glutton. That\u2019s again the Tolstoyan principle, don\u2019t overeat. Eventually he -- while he\nembraced it in his formative years, therefore it -- some of it, some principles of it stayed with\nhim for the remainder of his life. It also involved some intangibles like honesty, like\nforthrightness. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a way of life. Tolstoy formulated a complete way of life, to lead a\nclean life, both ways, physically and philosophically. Eventually my father became a member of\nthe bund, that was the Jewish Socialist Worker\u2019s movement.

        "A: Anyway, going back to medieval times as we just should do, the medieval girls did not accept\nJews, and there were very few trades available permitted to the Jews. The Jews were limited to\nmoney changing, trade, some thing -- whatever. But not skilled craftsmen. One of the few\nexceptions in crafts and trades was leather tanning. It was dirty, was filthy, the way it was done\nin medieval times, and it required a great amount of skill. And apparently the medieval Gentile\nhad no inclination either to get himself all dirtied up with filthy rotting rawhides, nor put his\nmind to the comp -- to the complexities of tanning, converting a raw hide into a finished product.\nSo that was one of the trades open to Jews, and my grandfather was a medieval leather tanner.\nHowever, he did not make a go out of it in his adult -- young adulthood.

Lodzki means, of Lodz. Therefore, if we go\nback to let\u2019s say 1820, when Jews only had the -- the given names, and they had to be identified\nby some kind of a surname or a handle, this was Hanoch from Lodz.

So his name was L6odzki which definitely puts his ancestry way back into the first settlers\nof Lodz. And he was quite -- and her family was quite prosperous. Apparently my grandfather\u2019s\nfamily was not prosperous. He was born in a little town of Skierniewice, somewhere within I\nwould say 20 - 30 mile. It\u2019s a hamlet. And the marriage must have been a brokered marriage, as\nall the marriages back then were. A usually young man went for the dowry. I mean, let\u2019s call a\nspade a spade. So apparently my grandmother\u2019s family was capable of offering a sizable dowry,\nand to satisfy the [indecipherable] family of my grandfather and the marriage took place with the\ncondition that my grandfather will move from Skierniewice to Lodz where her family will kind\nof see to it that they will be able to become economically viable.

        "A: -- because it just -- either he didn\u2019t produce good enough leather commercially, he must have\nbeen behind his times in the product. So he came back into Lodz and started a upholstery shop.\nAnd that\u2019s where his boys were trained in upholstery business. And that\u2019s was my father\u2019s\noccupation or trade at the age of 14 when he ran away from home. He was a experienced\nupholsterer. He was hired to run a shop at the age of 14. That must have gone on til the war\nbroke out, the first World War. I don\u2019t know about the future wars, but in the past wars, the one I\nknow of, which is the first and the second World War, the minute the rumor of war starts, leather\nbecomes gold. And as soon as the war started, there was a scarcity of finished leather and my\ngrandfather went back to the original leather trade which all a sudden became very profitable.\nAnd I heard tales that he used to tan the hides in my grandmother\u2019s kitchen, if you can imagine\nthe kitchen. Well, it was illegal, because all this was black market, what we would call it in\nmodern terms. Back then it was just forbidden by authorities, so was -- you would buy some\nhides off a peasant and --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: My dad came back si -- sometime in that -- at the end of that period, that means around 1916 -\n17. And he joined my grand -- the -- the leather trade. The demand for leather was so great and\nso profitable that all sudden all the sons engathered, and they all started producing leather. And\nall of them became knowledgeable in leather tanning. However, my father had the greater\nexpectations of himself and he single-handed made the leap from medieval to modern leather\ntanning. He taught himself German, and he read -- studied German biochemistry books, because\nthere are no book that relates specific to tanning. Maybe right now there are because we live in\nspecialized times, but back then if you want a formal education in that particular profession, you\nhad to go into it by chemistry. And the only biochemical -- biochemistry available was in\nGerman. And J still -- in th -- our house, my father continued try to improve his methods, he\ncontinued to receive from Germany, German textbooks in biochemistry. And he became -- he\nmade that transition from medieval to modern process. He became a master tanner, one of the\nbest known master tanners in all of Poland.",
        "A: All be like a boss. A master tanner would be somebody that knows the process, both ways.\nThe particular chemicals that -- and the -- the proportions, the mix of chemicals applied to each\nstage, and there are many stages, because you start off with a hairy piece of hide. First you got to\nget rid of the hair -- the hair, then you got to -- this -- and all si -- all this is done with a specific\nchemical. Some of these chemicals permeate the tissues, and before the next chemical is applied,\nthey had to be flushed out. So it is a complex knowledge, which he had to learn himself out of\nGerman textbooks.",
        "A: I was born in \u201924.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: So by 1919, when the war ended, they -- my grandfather and his sons, two sons, three sons --\nno, two sons -- my grandfather and two sons became wealthy enough from this semi\n[indecipherable] war time production of leather to acquire the property on Kwizinska 14, which\nwas a factory building. And installed in 1t modern leather tanning equipment imported from\nGermany.",
        "A: Oh, wait a minute, that was -- that was like in 1919, and because originally -- and originally\nthere\u2019s -- the plant was owned -- established and owned by my grandfather and my two older\nuncles, Israel and Simon. However, my rel -- my father\u2019s was [indecipherable] that\u2019s right,\nexcelled in the knowledge, both my grandfather and his brothers, so they hired him to become\nthe master tanner, in charge of the production. And you say -- asked me before what it was --\nmean to be a master tanner, master tanner means the -- being a -- the chemist, knowing the\nchemicals, the mix, the application and so on. In addition, the master tanner also has to know,\nand be able to instruct -- hired workers who had no skill in that trade, how to use the mechanical\npart of it because there were also machines that processed the product at different stages in\ndifferent ways. Some of them shaved it, because basically a hide 1s too thick, has to be more or\nless brought down to a specific thickness, especially that after tanning, the tissues do tend to\nswell. So if you start off with a raw hide, let\u2019s say like a quarter inch thick, after it\u2019s tanned, it\u2019s\nthree-quarters of an inch. Well, you can not use a finished product three-quarter of a inch thick\nfor a upper shoe, or for a pocketbook or a belt or anything else. So this had to be -- the thickness\nhad to be reduced by mechanical means, or shaved on a power machine. And then there was a\nmachine that would soften the leather because at some stage of the process they were coming out\nas hard as a board, and they have to be like, flexible. And that was done by a machine. And then\nthe final glaze was not a paint, but was applied again by heat, by a steel roller striking the face --\nthe grain of the leather that was prepared before with some type of preparation and that will\nproduce a glaze. So it was a mechanical process, therefore, a master tanner had not only be -- had\nto be not only knowledgeable in the chemical -- in the chemistry of it, but also in the mechanical\nin order to instruct or pass judgment on the performance of the workers. So that\u2019s a nutshell, is a\nmaster tanner. The man in charge of the entire production, knowledgeable in each phase. And by\n19 -- I believe \u201921, my father earned enough -- saved enough money. My father married, I\nbelieve in 1919, something like that, because my sister was born in 1921. And -- and around\n1921 - 1922, my father brought himself into the partnership. And moved into the factory\ncomplex. Up til then, while he was employed, he did not live on the premises. The premises\nthere -- the apartment building within the compound was restricted to owners only. As long as he\nwas not an owner, not a -- a matter of fact, he lived right on the corner, in an apartment on the\ncorner of the middle street. That will be 107 Demillaskaga. That\u2019s where my sister was born.\nThat\u2019s the way I\u2019m kind of trying to get the chronological data because I know my sister was\nborn on Demillaskaga 107 in a high -- rented apartment, while I was born three years later\nalready on Kwizinska on the premises of the compound. And by then my father became a partner\nto the [indecipherable] to the factory. And there just very few Jewish families, and I remember\nthem well. There was at 111 Yumanoskaga, which 1s just a few houses down, there was some\nkind of textile product plant, again with living quarters, owned by a family named Friedlander.\nThey were very wealthy. Must have been a very successful plant. Then going ho -- there was --\nbut there were no boys my age, there was a girl my sister\u2019s age, a daughter, and my sister was\nfriendly with her. Then going farther toward the outskirts, at about 137 - 140 Yumanoskaga was\nanother textile processing recycling plant, owned by a Jew named Osher. The reason I\u2019m naming\nthese names 1s because by the -- by the oddest quirk of fate, I came across these people many,\nmany years later. I came across the name of Osher, Heinrich Osher in the chronicles of Lodz\nghetto, that the -- put it in context, that there was a Heinrich Osher who married a Gentile\nwoman, and lived outside the ghetto, and that Pruschidsky puts together some kind of a story\nabout it. And I knew the man because the head of the family, Mr. Osher was a widower and he\nhad two sons of the first marriage, Heinrich was the youngest son of the first marriage, and they\nhad two children, a son and a daughter after the second marriage, and the son and daughter of the\nsecond marriage were my age -- the son was my age, and the daughter was my sister\u2019s age. So\nthat was another Jewish family when my sister already had two friends, girl friends, Jewish girl\nfriends. And I had at least one playmate. I would say up to the age of three or four, I played with\nGentile kids because Kwizinska was an odd street. There were only six residential properties on\nthe left side. The right side was a big fence with a wild garden behind it. So you\u2019 re talking about\nS1x properties, maybe 30 - 40 Gentile families, and us, the Jewish family, closing off the dead\nend street. And I played with the Gentile kids my age til I was about three or four. But once they\nreached the age of three or four, five, they already became permeated with the anti-Semitism at\nhome and church and they -- I became ostracized. They wouldn\u2019t play with me any more. And\nfrom then on I was leading a pretty solitary life. I had no playmates except when I would venture\nout to see that fellow Osher, his name was -- his name was Solomon.",
        "A: Yeah, we call him Sollik. He\u2019s alive and kicking in Israel [indecipherable] I heard about. And\nout of necessity -- now my -- now we talking [indecipherable] we talk about my father. My\nmother, in contrast to my father was a well educated person. My mother did not -- family did not\noriginate from Lodz. They were immigrants from Ukraine. And they came from a little town in\nukra -- western Ukraine named Schwub. My mother was born in Lodz. The Russian and\nUkrainian Jews were much -- were not Hassidic, and were much more for enlightment education.\nTherefore my mother attended a gimnasium, which is equivalent to high school, and graduated\nfrom a gimnasium. The gimnasium and the lyceum, that\u2019s the two additional years preparative\nfor college. My mother was fluent in Russian, both in speech and writing. My mother spoke\naccentless Polish, and wrote perfect, correct Polish, while my father never managed Polish at all\nand spoke broken Polish. My father\u2019s native language was Yiddish. He would navigate in Polish,\nbut it definitely was not the grammatical Polish.",
        "A: My mother no -- well, in addition to flawless Polish, perfect Russian, good German, not so\nmuch in language as in reading and writing, she spoke Yiddish in two dialects. With my father\u2019s\nfamily she spoke in Lodz Yiddish. With her family she spoke Litvok, Russian Yiddish. So my\nmother, out of -- I guess out of desperation having this kid four year or so old with no playmates,\nand I must have been pretty bright for my age, she taught me how to read. And I was reading\nfluently at the age of five. And I spend my ti -- in Poland\u2019s first grade -- there was no\nkindergarten, first grade started at the age of seven, not six. So between five and seven, I spend\nmy time between reading whatever was available, and using the plant, the factory, as my\nplayground. And early on I dif -- developed an affinity to hang out in the machine shop. And I\nmust have a inclination, inborn inclination to work in mechanical things. Early on I achieved\ndexterity in mechanical capabilit -- whatever mechanical. Because of all the places in the shop,\nand the -- the -- we employed about 20 some employees, it wa -- wasn\u2019t a great big factory. And\neverybody knew me because they -- th -- the workers, that was not much of a -- what would you\nsay, leaving and hiring, the workers are permanent. A matter of fact, I had a picture here of a di -\n- end -- entire factory group, the crew, with three men that knew me -- Gentile Poles that knew\nme since day I was born. And that picture was taken in 1946, so you can imagine there were --\nonce you got a job in a -- 1n that factory, in -- especially in -- in my f -- in a -- in a factory, in a\nplace of work that was supervised by my father, you were never fired. You could quit. If you\nwere fired, you were fired for -- you had to be a real bad person to be fired. My father did not\nbelieve in firing people, that\u2019s part of his Tolstoy principle. Matter of fact, to [indecipherable]\nand -- and leap ahead, about 1937 I believe, the Polish parliament passed a law outlawing ritual\nslaughter. I don\u2019t [indecipherable] but there was an anti-Semitic woman representative, in the\n[indecipherable] which is equivalent Polish to parliament. She put the bill, presented a bill to the\n-- saying that the ritual slaughter is inhuman. And the bill pass, and all the Jewish butchers went\nout of business. And my father on principle, even though we didn\u2019t need any more help at that\ntime, hired, I think four ex-butchers, because after all, they lost their livelihood, and being\nbutchers, they were at least familiar and [indecipherable] hide were not odious to them. So he\nhired them. So anyway -- and th-these Gentile workers -- we had Jewish workers, too, I would\nsay there was about eight or 10 Jewish employees. Some Hassidic Jews, but [indecipherable]\nvery specialized trades. And the rest was about 17 or so Gentiles. And I just toddled around\nbetween them, they all kept me out of trouble, seeing I don\u2019t wind up in a pit, salting pit and -- or\nin the jaws of a -- a machine. But of all the places that I liked best was the machine shop. Why\nthe mechanic let me handle tools and do things and help him. I really loved -- I had an affinity to\nmechanical things. And then by the age of seven, I was -- became of school age and in Poland\nelementary school was compulsory education. However, the Poles -- the Polish authorities\npreferably had s -- did not preferably -- would not mix Jews with Gentiles. So therefore, if you\nrun into a survivor out of Poland who will say that he attended a school, elementary school or\neven a high school with Gentiles together, he -- or she is from a small town where there was not\nenough of a Jewish population for a segregated school. In Lodz, with 250,000 Jews, there was no\nproblem whatsoever. Therefore, I was assigned to a all Jewish public elementary school, located\non Ribna one-three, which is inside the ghetto some of -- one of the streets there 1s Ribna Street.\nMatter of fact, on Ribna there -- there -- 1t was so much oppos -- in the middle of the s -- of a\ncenter of Jewish population that there were really two schools, one a -- two buildings, separate\nbuildings. One at Ribna one-three, and the other one was Ribna 15. Each one first to seven grade.\nEach one a converted, old, beat up apartment house. This in spite of the fact that as you walked\ndown Kwizinska and hit the intersection with Yumanoskaga, across the street, directly across the\nstreet was a brand new, beautiful, elementary school, built specifically for school purposes. And\nI could have attended it with a five minute walk, but that was for Poles, for Gentiles only. So\ntherefore I had to take a -- I lived up here, I had to board a trolley car and tr-travel I would say\nabout 20 minutes on a trolley car to Ribna, which would be -- this is Balskirinik, it\u2019s somewhere\nright before Balskirinik, because it was during the war in the ghetto boundary. Well, the\neducation in that school wasn\u2019t very good, because the salaries paid to the teachers were\nminimal. That was state funded school. And we did have in the city of Lodz, our own Jewish\nprivate school system. Unfortunately it was in town. And there was no way to send a seven year\nold one on three different trolley cars to go to school. So I spend my first two years attending the\nfirst grade, second grade in this school on Ribna, and by the age of 10 my mother decided I\u2019m\nbig enough or bright enough or whatever, to be able to travel, take three different trolley cars,\nand I was signed in to a private Jewish school on Hermoska 48. It was a non-profit school by a --\noperated by a s-society dedicated to spreading knowledge and technical capability among Jews.\nTherefore, it consisted of two separate schools. One wa -- was teaching first grade all the way to\nlyceum. That\u2019s the 12\" year, classic, normal curriculum. The other section was technical and had\ntwo departments, textile and mechanical. Well I start out then dar -- the separation happened on -\n- was offered to the student who from -- graduating from sixth grade. The first -- the elementary\nschool was just one type. So I attended the -- the third, fourth, fifth and sixth grade elementary\nschool in that particular school on Hermoska 48. I was doing very well in school. I was class\npresident for four years running, and put in the public school system --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A\nfairly recently to Lodz and he 1s -- he just arrived in Lodz and he\u2019s working for the Jewish\nHistorical Society. So I pretty sure that anything appearing with the name of Nahoum\nBlumenthal out of Yad Vashem would be the same individual because eventually I imagine as --\nI -- I don\u2019t think he stayed any longer than 1956 in Poland, because 1956 was when Gomoka\nopened up a -- the borders for the Jews, and a lot of Jews left.",
        "A: Okay, let\u2019s --",
        "A: Oh, okay.",
        "A: The war --",
        "A: -- the war. The war 1s at -- the war is -- how the war started. Because I kept no diary --",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. Because -- because I kept no diary, why the events are very strong in my mind. As you\nsee that my -- I got a memory like an elephant. I wish I wouldn\u2019t. I -- I with to God that I\nwouldn\u2019t. I mean things are -- when I -- I -- I -- I-I -- I can see pi -- pictures in my mind like a\nfilm running. I spoke today -- this morning at breakfast, I spoke with my friend in Silver Spring,\nand I say to him, Henry, do you remember I -- no, said to him, \u201cHenry, I finally pinpointed the\nexact day of the -- the d -- exact date of the day of interegnam, when we spent the day together\nwith the city laying dead in front of us.\u201d He says, \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d And I say to him -- and\nbecause -- and I cou -- I did prepare myself for this interview because of the chronological\nproblems of events. I don\u2019t want to confuse it. According to the Pruschidsky, that\u2019s the\nchronicles, the Polish army pulled out September sixth, evacuated. The Germans entered\nSeptember eighth. Now that gives me the date that I spent with Henry. I spent with Henry the\nday of the seventh of September. He lived on Piotkowska 20, which is center of the city, and I\nlived on the outskirts. I remember it like now, was a beautiful, sunny day, cloudless. And the city\nwas dead. No vehicular traffic, no trolley cars running, hardly any people in the streets. And I\nmade my way all the way from my home, all the way down [indecipherable] down, down\n[indecipherable] up to Piotkowska 20, and I went up and we spend day together, went on the\nstreets, we walked the streets, and I didn\u2019t get home til about five o\u2019clock, and my mother\nthought that I already am gone permanently because there was a drive to move eastward. And\nshe thought that I met some -- with some fellows in town and we decided to go before the\nGermans enter. So that\u2019s how the war started. There were rumors before the war about the -- the\nprobability. I remember pikou -- I was always a voracious reader even though I did develop a\nsocial life, my primary entertainment and preoccupation was reading. I remember sometime in\nthe summer of \u2019?39, I came across a book called, \u201cThe Brown Book,\u201d which described the\natrocities committed by the germa -- by the Nazis on the German Jews. Dachau concentration\ncamp. With pictures. And I remember taking the book down the factory yard where my father\nwas kind of circulating, and stopping my father in his work and saying, \u201cDad, take a look what I\njust picked up at the library.\u201d And I sh -- opened it up and showed him the pictures and some\ncaptions, how the Jews are being maltreat -- German Jews are being maltreated by the Nazis.\nAnd I say, \u201cDad, what\u2019s going to happen when the Germans will arrive? When the war starts,\nthen Germans will come here.\u201d And my father\u2019s answer was typical of the [indecipherable]\ngenerations. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI dealt with the Germans in 1917 - \u00b018. You can do business with\nthe Germans.\u201d Very significant.",
        "A: I have no idea --",
        "A: It was -- the title was \u201cThe Brown Book,\u201d had a brown cover --",
        "A: No, pu -- published in Polish.",
        "A: Could be a translation, pretty thick.",
        "A: And profusely --",

        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: In newspapers. Radio, newspapers. The Poles were quite eager and exuberant, if you can use\nthat term exuberant to announce publicly these news, how the Jews are being beaten up and --\nbecause it gave them a more or less a moral excuse to mistreat the Polish Jews. After all, if the\nwestern, the civilized world, which goes to Poland, wa -- German, it was the western world.",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think I discussed it with my mother. And that\u2019s where my father was wrong.\nHow -- now once the war broke out, again I got to use somebody else\u2019s dates. After the Germans\nentered, the restrictive measures were announced against the Jews virtually immediately. And I\nhave a date, September -- beginning September 18\", til -- til December 18\", there was a whole\nrow, one after another of orders restricting Jews, beginning with curfew, not permitting Jews to\nuse principle streets to -- to walk on.",
        "A: The Jews had to use side streets.",
        "A: Piotkowska was out of bounds for Jews. Matter of fact, Henry\u2019s house, which was facing\nPiotkowska [indecipherable] they had to break through the back wall, so there would be back\nentrance from a street parallel to Piotkowska. And then there was a ordinance about the Jews\nbeing identified first by yellow bands.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Armbands.",
        "A: The star came right after. The armband I would say was on for about two or three months and\nthen the order was changed to a Star of David they wore on -- on the chest and the back. You\nknow, you had to have it on a -- your shoulder too.",
        "A: Oh they were printed in a form of a large poster.

And movie houses, movie theaters, whatever, was -- wer --\nanybody was free to put a poster up. And --",
        "A: The -- restricting the Jews? Oh sure. Was -- you just -- you went on the street and you stopped\nat this poster display and you read the -- the latest poster.",
        "A: To tell you the truth, I was preoccupied. First of all, I was in love.",
        "A: I was going steady with a girl, so war or no war, and maybe I was reckless, or I didn\u2019t realize\nwhat I\u2019m getting into it, but all these ordinance I took -- I'll say -- I say okay, I can live with that.\nI mean, the curfew, I can live with that, I can adjust my lifestyle. Armband, I can live with that.\nOld --",
        "A: Yeah. Well, 14 going on 15. It don\u2019t stop me from dating my girl and dating -- and taking her\nto the movies, even though the movies already in the center city, the first run movies, were\nforbidden to the Jews. But there were a lot of small movie theaters, because movie thea -- movies\nwas the only entertainment available to general public. So movies were very popular, there was a\n-- a Slew of movie theaters, third, fourth run.",
        "A: Western, they were mostly western movies --",
        "A: -- yeah, there were hardly any movies made in Poland. Also -- all -- oh, I remember the first\nmovies I saw was Tom Mix, Ken Maynard, Elmer Lincoln. The first Tarzan was Elmer Lincoln.\nI remember him right now. He had a beard. Imagine Tarzan with a beard.",
        "A: Oh well, they had the captions, right. So I remember just taking these ordinances part of that\u2019s\nthe way it is.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t forget the book, but I didn\u2019t relate to 1t because now -- now we\u2019ve gone into the\nspecifics. What happened with business, because even though I was only 14, I was raised on the\nfactory compound.",
        "A: So it wasn\u2019t like my father would go off somewhere to nowhere, leave the apartment or\nwhatever and come back in the evening. Business and residence were always --",
        "A: -- together. My mother -- my mother participate in the -- in the business. A matter of fact, my\nmother participate very strongly because she was the only woman in the whole bunch that spoke\nflawless Polish. And the relationship between the Polish authorities, whether tax authority or\nwhatever, and the Jews were, at the best, adversary. And if a Jew came with some kind of a\nproblem to be corrected into a state run office, if he spoke with an accented Polish, he was\nridiculed, he was disregarded, he wasn\u2019t even given the proper attention. So my mother was --\nany time there was a problem with any kind of state office, and the operation of the factory, my\nmother was delegated to go down and deal with the bureaucrats because her Polish was a\nflawless Polish. So -- now, therefore, I was present -- not I took any kind of active part in the\nbusiness, but I was present and s -- I was -- I had the knowledge of the business subliminally,\nvirtually by osmosis. And I knew that the business in the preceding months before the war was\nvery, very dead, was virtually at standstill. There was no trade going on.",
        "A: Things were bad, and right after the Germans entered, all sudden things picked up. First of all\nthere was a steady stream of uniform, green uniform Germans. I don\u2019t know their rank. They\ndefinitely were not privates, coming in and buying leather, in all kind of quantities, til they\nreached a point where the partners, my father and his brothers were limiting the quantities\nbecause when a German or two German uniformed would come in and say they want to buy\nskins, finished skins, leather, they would be offered two, or three, or four skins, with the usual\nexplanation and I was witnessing it, you are not a merchant sir, you want for some kind of\nprivate use, 1s two good enough, or would you like three? And apparently they had all the cash in\nthe world.",
        "A: Oh yes. They were polite, they were well behaved, they were -- they were not Volksdeutschen\nthey were Reichsdeutschen. They were -- I believe they were, because of their green uniforms,\nthey were regular Wehrmacht. The regular Wehrmacht were just decent, ordinary Germans, they\nwere not Nazis. Cause the [indecipherable] Nazis would be black uniforms, either SS -- well, SS.\nWhatever. They were Wehrmacht. And they came with -- money was no problem and all of a\nsudden business was booming. And there was this stream of Germans coming in, and I became\ninured to the fact that the German in a green uniform is in a way, harmless. Can you see that\ncomplacency?",
        "A: Right, cause I realized that we Jews are like a homeless dog, outside the law. Now no laws\napplied. I was at one time, some time I would say in end of September, some Germans came to\nthe house, into the plant on a weekend when the factory was shut down. And they knocked on\nthe apartment doors. And they wore civi -- civilian clothes but wore Nazi armbands, with the\nswastika. And they were looking for young men. And they grab me and escorted me, took me\ndown to a nearby high school complex, and I was made -- German refugees from the eastern\nterritories were arriving into Lodz because under the Soviet German pact, any German that lived\nwa -- east of Bug river, in the Russian occupied territory was free to leave with as much\nbelonging as he wanted to. And many of these Germans fled. And they arrived, among other\ncities, they arrived in Lodz. And that\u2019s where the problem started for the Jews, in the center of\nthe city because all a sudden, end of September, October, there are hundreds of German families\narriving in Lodz, trying -- and the German authorities desperate to try to find a place for them to\nlive, so the logical answer for them was throw the Jews out of their housing, and offer the\nhousing to the refugee Germans. But they wouldn\u2019t go into Baloote, because the housing in\nBaloote was no running water, no indoor plumbing. So these Jews in Baloote, the poor Jews,\nthey were left alone. And it was the upper scale Jews, occupying the new sections and the new\nareas that had running water, that had indoor plumbing, that were the first ones to suffer of being\ntossed out su-summarily out of their apartments. So I was taken down to that relocation center.\nGermans were arriving and I -- there was a -- there was a group of Jews, young Jews, dragged in\nfrom God knows where. I didn\u2019t know anybody. And th -- we\u2019re told to -- they were arriving by\ntrolley cars, apparently from the train station. And we were told to help them. So I carried the\nsuitcases and bags from the sidewalk into the interior of the school, was [indecipherable] it was\ngym or something. And work for about two or three hours and then there was a break and -- in\nthe transports, and I was invited to whatever I -- ask would want some refreshment. Just like the\nrefugee -- refugees. There were the coffee urns, or whatever, and go ahead and have a sandwich,\nand so. But on the other hand, one day I was walking the street, I was grabbed by a German who\nhad no identity -- no identification at all. I don\u2019t know even know whether he was a German. But\nhe say, hey you there, grabbed me out -- by the arm and he said, \u201cI need you.\u201d And he drive me\nto his house and made me move some furniture for him. I mean, we were like a homeless dog.\nBut that still didn\u2019t stop me from --",
        "A: -- from moving around because these -- these things done to me, were not like an organized\nsystematic, but we knew that we Jews can be treated anyway an individual German wants to treat\nus, but basically I was treated fairly decently. I was never abused, let\u2019s put it this way, even when\nthey grabbed me for something. And this brings me to a very interesting point. That -- because\nthat was the last time when I was permitted to travel the streets. From then on I became a\nprisoner in the compound. According to, again the Pruschidsky, on November 11\", the Germans\ndestroyed the statue of Kosciuszko that was placed on Plac Wolnosci in the center of the city.",
        "A: Freedom Square, right. It was a horse mounted Kosciuszko -- I think the horse was on two\nlegs, two hind legs and Kosciuszko the big saver, and this -- this -- the horse and the rider were\non top of a pedestal, like a -- I would say octagonal. A very large one, possibly 30 feet diameter.\nIt was a very massive pedestal. [indecipherable] support, but -- and each panel of the oc --\noctagon depicted different feats in life of Kosciuszko. And apparently this was made out of\nbronze, were bronze relief panels. And that was my -- ah, no -- so once I read this, the whole\nevent came to my mind. I had a date, and I went with my date to the movies.",
        "A: Right, same girlfriend.",
        "A: I was going steady. Her name was Rainya -- my God, just told Henry.",
        "A: I met her in \u201938. So I met her and we went to the movies, I remember the name of the movie\ntheater, Bika, which means fairy tale.",
        "A: Fairy tale.",
        "A: Yeah, Bika in Polish 1s fairy tale. And we went to the movies, we saw the picture. It was\nsomewhere on the outskirts, and must have been shortly before the curfew and I didn\u2019t take her\nhome. We parted company one point, she went up, and I went up, and I tell you my way down\nagain Nowomiejska, was Skerska and somewhere before I even hit Skerska, which is an\nextension of Nowomiejska, I get stopped by a uniformed German patrol. And they bring my\nback to Pazelnofscha and I see a group of people working at the Kosciuszko statue. And I\u2019m\nbeing ordered to take my overcoat off, this was November, pretty cold, put a pile of overcoats\nand join the workers. So I joined the workers, and there were some with [indecipherable] tools,\nchisels, sledge hammers, were banging away and trying to separate these bronze panels away\nfrom the concrete. And I worked til about two a.m. At two a.m., I guess the Germans got tired --\nand they were decent enough, there was a non-com -- it was a military unit, and it was a non-com\nin charge, and he said, \u201cOkay Jews, go home, that\u2019s the end, the end of the day.\u201d And we said,\n\u201cHow we going to go home, it\u2019s a curfew and we will get arrested on the way home.\u201d And he\nwas nice enough to get ahold of a bunch of slips and s -- write something 1n German and hand\nout to each one of us. Here, here. You show it -- anybody stops you, you show it to him, you\u2019ll\nbe all right. So I went home and that was the end of my -- my parents withdrew permission for\nme to leave the factory compound from then on, that\u2019s November 11\", I was virtually\nimprisoned.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: You can imagine the [indecipherable], and -- and there was also already talk, gossip, that the\nJewish businesses are going to be confiscated. So my father was looking for a tame or captive\nGerman to kind of be the front man.",
        "A: Be a front man.",
        "A: Captive, na -- tame.",
        "A: Yeah, a tame German, yeah.",
        "A: Tame, ye -- captive, yeah. And -- and again, an odd coincidence that in 19 -- between 1935\nand 1938, my father did not work with his partners at this location, but around a tannery, in a -- a\nrented tannery in Erda Parbenietska, which is oh, somewhere in this direction.",
        "A: I -- yeah, there was Parbienietsa and there was Erda Parbenietska, two separate townships\nadjoining Lodz, with [indecipherable] running [indecipherable] platzi -- this was Platzia Monta.\nIt\u2019s not marked, but this junction is called -- was called Platzia Monta. It was Platzia Monta, Plaz\nBaranik, Plaz Bowtski. At these two junctions the city -- there were two separate trolley car\ncompanies. One was inner city, had their own trolley cars, their own colors, and there was the\nsuburban, which had their own trolley cars, different shape, different size, and different color.\nAnd they were running out of [indecipherable] Platzia Monta outwards. These were the junction\npoints where you transferred.",
        "A: So my father worked in a rented tannery. And that tannery belonged to a German, wealthy\nGerman family, well known in Lodz, named Ranka. And one of their in-law, named Rudolf\nStribel, he was kind of appointed to run that tannery some time in the 30\u2019s, I -- early 30\u2019s and he\nwas not a tanner, he was a bookkeeper [indecipherable] bookkeeper, he was a bookkeeper. And\nhe ran the tannery down the ground, and his in-laws shut it down. And it was vacant and my\nfather teamed up with another merchant, and they rented the tannery, and started producing.",
        "A: No, he lets his brothers -- no, no, he left --",
        "A: -- he stepped out of the --",
        "A: That was -- there were differences, serious differences between my father and his brothers and\nin 1935 he reached a point where he just chucked it.",
        "A: But we -- yes, right, while he was not participating any more either in the production or the\nproceeds of the plant, we were still owners to the property and therefore we still occupied our\napartment. So when they rented that tannery Erda Parbenietska, this fellow, str -- Rudolf Stribel,\ncame around a-and introduced himself that he is the son-in-law of the owners of the property and\nhe\u2019s a bookkeeper, and would we -- would my father need a bookkeeper? And my father and his\npartner said yes. Especially that he was skilled in that particular kind of bookkeeping because he\nwas doing the bookkeeping for the previous operators of the tannery. So they hired him, and he\nworked for them for -- between \u00b035 and \u00b038. In \u201938 they quit that, gave up [indecipherable] ran\nout and they came back, both my father and his then partner, to the Kwizinska. Actually, what\nhappened is that partner of my father bought one of my uncles out, and my grandfather. So there\nwas a change in the make-up of partners. So at that point when some of the Germans that were\ncoming in were kind of not nice, and there was rumors of being -- Jewish properties being\nconfiscated, my parents -- well, the adults started looking for solutions, and one solution that\nbecame immediately apparent was get hold of Stribel and find out what he is doing. And they --\nthey found him, and there he is I would say two months into the German occupation, still\nwalking next to his shoes. Apparently he did not benefit in the first eight weeks from being a\nsuperior German.",
        "A: Next to his shoes. With holes in his soles.",
        "A: He was still pretty poor shape. Couldn\u2019t latch on anything, and at that point they offered him a\njob, that first of all he would be a front man. He will deal with the Germans. And he accepted it\neagerly, anything, hey. And it was a -- going with mixed results because he really had no official\nstanding, so some -- while most of the Germans would kind of act more s -- in a more subdued\nmanner when they would deal with him, others were bolder enough to say, who are you and what\nare you doing, what are you, a Jewish servant? And it would even make the situation worse. So it\nwas a mixed blessing, but it -- it worked to some extent, and business was good. I mean, money\nwas rolling in like crazy. And then all a sudden some time again, I would say by November, the\nGermans established, confiscated officially -- there was a decree out of Berlin confiscating all\nJewish property and establishing a special office to handle Jewish property. And administer\nJewish property. It was called in German, De treuhand stellech. Treuhand means an honest hand,\ntreu honest hand. And the administrators were named Treuhande. So the adults, the partners got\non Stribel, and say hey Stribel, you better go down to Posum -- Posun, I -- which was the seat of\nthe -- by then naturally, Lodz was incorporated into Bartigo and we became thoroughly\nGermanized, all the vestiges of pole -- Polish [indecipherable] were gone. We became a German\ncity in Germany.",
        "A: Bartigo, with Posun becoming the capital of the province. So we kind of -- the adults said,\nhey Stribel, you better go down to Posun and apply for the job of treuhande for this factory. And\nhe kind of hemmed and hawed. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know why he was timid about it. I -- I\nremember it because I was partic -- I wasn\u2019t participating, but I was present to the conversations.\nThe space was limited. The office was the office, big deal. But he went off. He went off, he came\nback I think two or three days beaming, with official papers, naming him that administra --\nofficial administrator of the factory. At that point they sat down the partners with him and they\nwrote a private agreement where he recognize the current owners as the true owners and he will\nonly act as their representative, while representing the German office. And he recognizes the\nright of the owners to participate in profits. It was like a private arrangement. At the same time,\nwhile this was going on and Stribel\u2019s presence became kind of more official standing, he could\ndeal better with the -- whoever arrived to purchase the leather, and the Jews kept in the\nbackground. Being in Bartigo -- located in Bartigo, in a German city, because all vestiges of\nPolish rule disappeared. The cit -- there was the Polish police disappeared. The shupari a-\nappeared, they were imported. Shup is the [indecipherable] the law and order, all the German\ninstitutions, and then we had -- at same time were -- became aware that not all of occupied\nPoland was incorporated, that the Germans just took the western part and formed three\nprovinces, us being the center one, Bartigo. However, the eastern part is called general\ngovernment, and there 1s -- the Polish rule prevails, the Polish police, national police is still in\ncharge in their navy blue uniforms. Polish schools are being active. Polish language is --\nlanguage 1s the official language. So all things be equal, we assumed that between -- that the\nJewish fate in the hands of the Germans is going to be much worse in area incorporated directly\ninto Germany, than in -- into area that is only temporarily occupied by the Germans for the\nduration of the war, with its fate decided after the war.",
        "A: There was travel going on, back and forth. Well, there was also 1 -- let\u2019s -- let\u2019s say that there\nwas actually a four -- there was an exodus of Jews out of Lodz at least three -- three times. The\nfirst exodus was immediately following the Polish army as it evacuated. A lot of Jews left,\nespecially Jews with -- who were Communists or Communist followers. And -- because they --\nwe already heard that the Russians are coming in from the other side, and the first wave of the\nJews that left Lodz, the young men especially, kept on going. And went all the way across the\nBug river to the Russians, to the Reds. And the other part of the wave, the middle edge, were the\nones that were cash liquid -- had liquidity and they left hoping that the Germans weren\u2019t\n[indecipherable] the Poles will at one point resist. So that the first wave. That right away reduced\nthe po -- Jewish population of Lodz. And then there was the second wave, when L\u00e9dz was\nincorporated into Third Reich, and we became aware that eastern occupied territories are general\ngovernment, so that was a second wave of emigration of Jews out of Lodz. Again, the ones that\nwere cash liquid. You had to have liquidity to leave. So while we\u2019re sitting in the tannery,\nmaking hands over fist, we considered -- I\u2019m talking about adults -- that the state 1s going to be\ntemporary, and very temporary. That very soon we\u2019ll have to move on and being of a kind of a\nmind that looks ahead and doesn\u2019t wait for things to happen, just like the way we hired that\nGerman before we had to, we started looking for alternatives. It so happened that my mother\u2019s\nbrother, who was operating a very successful establishment on the corner of [indecipherable]\nNowomiejska. He had like a sweet shop, lunchroom, whatever, but very successful. He -- and he\nwas able to pull out a lot of cash from the banks before the Jewish accounts were frozen. I\nremember him boasting, showing -- opening up a shoebox full with currency, high domina --\ndenomination currency, telling to -- telling my mother in my presence, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about\nmoney, because in this box there\u2019s enough for both our families to survive the war.\u201d They were\nchildless.",
        "A: They were childless. He was a younger brother, my mother\u2019s younger brother and they were\nchildless. So the adults somehow organized, I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t remember how, but\norganized an apartment, some housing in a town called Tomashuv Mazovyetski. And that was\nalready rented through emissaries. And it was sop -- the component that\u2019s supposed to eventually\noccupy these premises rented in that town Tomashuv Mazovyetski was my mother\u2019s brother with\nhis wife, a childless couple, my parents with their children, that means my sister and me. And my\nUncle Simon with his wife and again, son and a daughter. The son was born in 1910, was 14\nyears older than I, he was already a -- part time into medical studies in Belgium. And his\ndaughter was my -- about old as my sister. Not very much older. So that was the component that\nwas going to go to m -- settle in Tomashuv Mazovyetski when things come to an end at the\ntannery. But somehow they didn\u2019t want to come to an end. The money was good and was still\nfairly safe haven. However, my uncle, the one that -- my mother\u2019s side, he was [indecipherable]\nat loose ends. He lost his business. So the decision was that part of the component will go off to\nTomashuv, the ones that are not necessary. That means my father and mother will stay on, my\nUncle Simon and his wife will stay on, and everybody, the youngsters, my sister and I in early\nteens and my cousins in their late teens or early 20\u2019s will leave for Tomashuv under the\nsupervision of the two adults.",
        "A: My father\u2019s -- my mother\u2019s brother and his wife --",
        "A: -- that childless couple.",
        "A: And there was already a truck hired, and I remember an afternoon some time in November,\npossibly mid-November or so, the truck was in the factory yard and the -- they [indecipherable]\nafter the work stopped, being loaded with basic furniture, bedsteads, mattresses, and -- and\nbedding and all our spare clothing, winter clothing, I mean you name it. Just bare necessities left\nbehind because everybody\u2019s already going and the only ones that are staying just for another few\nweeks, is my father and my mother, and my Uncle Simon and his wife, for as long as the\nbusiness is good and can be milked. And once the truck got all loaded up with all the goods and\nnow came the turn for the -- for humans to get loaded up and first my cousins hopped on, and\nthen my sister went up on the tailgate, and she was in, and I was the last one. There is my uncle\nand my aunt standing, and my mother and my father, and naturally Uncle Simon and his wife.\nAnd I\u2019m the last one to get on the truck, the tailgate, and my Aunt Ida turns to my mother and\nsays, \u201cHim I don\u2019t take. He\u2019s too nasty and he\u2019s too fussy, I don\u2019t want him. Ill take Mary, but I\nwon\u2019t take him. I won\u2019t put up with him.\u201d And the truck went off without me.",
        "A: No. Well, I was --",
        "A: -- maybe that -- pardon?",
        "A: There -- there was no point of arguing. I mean, she was a supervising adult, if she turned her\nthumbs down on me, that\u2019s it. And besides, it wasn\u2019t that critical, because after all, the bulk of\nthe people went, and the bulk of the goods, it was the goods that -- and the leftover to follow\nwould be only lightly encumbered, because all the stuff went.",
        "A: Apparently no --",
        "A: -- and they arrived safe in Tomashuv, and it turned out that things in Tomashuv were terrible.\nThe housing, the food, or whatever, the -- both the Gentile and the Jewish native population was\nresentful of the newcomers, and now I stayed behind. I was happy. I didn\u2019t want to go. I -- that\nwas ma -- my playground, there is the plant, my factory and I was happy to stay behind. And that\nwas sometime in de -- late December, or beginning of January. I was standing in the factory yard\nas usual during the day, and my father was standing in factory yard in the snow. And the gate\nOpens up and my sister bursts through the gate and grabs my father by his neck and starts kissing\nhim, saying \u201cTatish, Tatish, I love you.\u201d And behind her comes my cousin Manasha. And that\u2019s\nit, just two of them. And we start asking what\u2019s what, and Manasha, who was older, he was in his\n20\u2019s already, he explained that things were unbearable at Tomashuv, there was a lot of friction\namong the -- the family itself, and friction with the neighbors, both Jews and Gentiles, with the\nindigenous neighbors and the newcomers. And finally Manasha -- Manasha took sick and there\nwas no doctor up there and when he got well he decided to go back home. And my sister Mary\ndecided to go with him; not his sister. And they made their way back, I would say about --\nthrough the winter snows, at least 130 - 150 miles, hitchhiking or just walking, traveling along\nthe highways. But they made it back home.",
        "A: The ghetto.",
        "A: The people in Tomashuv did not survive. My cousin Mina died. None of them survived. We\nall survived. Manasha died in Sweden last year. That\u2019s the magic of the tannery.",
