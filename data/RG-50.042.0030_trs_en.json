        "How do you remember the changes in 1939 when the Germans came, the changes in everyday life,\nif you remember any of them. Uh, persecutions, the effects on your family.",
        "Well, it was 1939, and I was only 4 years old, so my recollections are only that just prior to the\nGermans uh coming into our town, we heard a lot of planes, and uh, our parents would uh take me\ndown because at that point my sister was in Warsaw studying, uh to uh the basement for protection,\nand they would put a uh, a mask on us made from uh, from cotton. Um, that was prior to the\nGermans coming and, and then within a few days, uh, we all were standing outside, and a soldiers\non motorcycles and had, uh, uh...cars and, and with big heavy uh hats, um, marched into our town.\nThat's my first look, recollection of seeing Germans. And then, things started changing almost\nimmediately. My mother and father were very protecting of, of me, so, we were not allowed to uh,\nI was not allowed to go outside, other than to my grandparent's home, which was uh 3 doors down,\nand uh, everybody was afraid. We started uh getting people, Jewish people, coming in from other\nparts of the country, and uh, we had to share our homes and our means with them. Uh, we always\nhad a full house of people. And then, the cruelty started. Then they started coming in into the\nhomes, and, and, and just taking people out for, as I overheard, for no apparent reason. In fact, one\nof those times it was uh, at my grandfather's house, it was um, my grandparents lived in a a ina\nhome where there was a courtyard, so there was a big door at the entrance of the uh, from the street,\nand you walked into the courtyard. That door was closed for the night, and there was banging on\nthe door, and my uncle happened to have opened the door for them. The Germans marched in and\nwalked over to an apt where a poor tailor lived that hardly could make a living, pulled him out and\nshot him. We don't know why they didn't take my uncle. So that was the first beginning of what I\noverheard at that age. And then I saw changes in my grandparents place mostly. For some reason,\nwhich I don't know why either, but I came one afternoon into their house, and my grandfather and\ngrandmother were sitting on the side crying, and when I looked at my grandfather I couldn't believe\nit. His beard was shaved off. And my aunt was sitting in the corner crying. I couldn't understand\nwhy, and uh nobody took the time to explain it to me. Um, since that time I haven't seen my aunt\nleave her hou--leave the house. It was only in the last few years that I have found out from my\nmother that at that particular time she was raped, and that's why she did not leave the house,\nbecause it was a traumatic experience for her. And these are just things that were happening",
        "around me, personally, that I saw and felt the first week or two or three, I don't know, before the\nghetto was formed. Um, my father was very upset. Nobody paid much attention to me, except to\nmake sure that I'm safe and that I'm always around them, that I don't wander off, and uh, that was\nthe beginning.\nTell me about the ghetto.\nThe ghetto was formed around the area where we lived, so we didn't have to move, other than give\nup some of our uh, rooms and so forth to accommodate other people. Uh, there was more and more\npeople coming in to the ghetto, but my father was a photographer. Uh, he was quite well-\nestablished in the city, not only among the Jewish people, but also among the gentiles. Uh, and uh,\nhe still had permission to leave the ghetto during the day, and had to come back at night. Our\nstudio was taken over by the Germans. They uh, ran the business, and my father was there just\nworking for them, so it was really not our business anymore, and my mother, too, had to go in, start\ngoing in. Um, my sister, as I mentioned before, uh studied in Warsaw because she was uh very\ntalented uh musically. She was a pianist, and when the ghetto formed, my father had sent someone\nto bring her back home, and um, other than that, life was a little bit more like normal for me\nbecause I had my sister at home where I didn't have her before. There was people coming in and\nshe was practicing and playing and in fact there was some Germans that would come in to listen to\nher at night, and we would have to put up sheets in the windows, so nobody would see that they\ncame in. So um, that part was still a very, we were still a very close family, and uh, everybody was\nalways mentioning who was shot this time, and who was shot that time, and, and, friends and\nfamilies and um, just disappeared. They would um, uh catch people in the streets for working\ndetails to other parts of the country, and we were always concerned that my, I had two uncles, that\nthey would be caught, and uh, that uh, my father would be, so actually, from day to day we, there\nseemed to be such terrible tension in the house. It uh, I, I just felt like I was always in the way\nbecause I was a nuisance I suppose. I was not allowed to go anywhere, and yet, I was supposed to\nalways entertain myself, and, and stay out of people's way, I guess, they had no patience for me.\n(Sigh).\nDescribe the importance of working and how your parents realized that very early.\nMy father had the foresight that uh, if he is going to have employment and be a productive citizen,\nthat he'll be safe, and so will my mother. So there was a um camp that was being set up outside of\nour city, it was called Voltsehoff, uh, a uh German company I think, that was making electronics,\nuh, set up a factory with free, free labor, so my father through some protection was uh, and money,",
        "was able to um get to uh places for my mother and my father to work in that factory and to live on\nthat uh, uh camp, working camp what they called. My sister through friends, acquaintances and\num, was um taken to a gentile family to continue her education because they felt that it will be very\nimportant for her to continue her uh musical training, and if she will be going to camp, then,\ncertainly there wouldn't be any piano, not knowing what was waiting for us. So, a family outside\nof our city, a uh, actually a duke and duchess, have accepted her as another one of their daughters,\nand my sister had spent the uh war with them. Um, with continuing her education. I was uh, my\nfather had worked out for uh str--\nWe have to stop. We have to reload.\nBeep.\nDescribe the work camp, the life, and define what a work camp is when you tell me, and then tell\nme how it is that you ended up in that kind of environment and what it was like. Be sort of basic\nabout it.\nWell, um, children were not allowed. They were, were supposed to not exist because it was a\nworking camp. So my father and mother had their specific work to do. I think my mother worked\nin the kitchen, and my father uh worked in the factory. I was supposed not to exist. So, uh, certain\ndays, uh yes I was allowed to walk around in, in the camp, but whenever there was a lit--first of all,\nthe camp was supposed to have been maybe for a hundred uh people to work in the factory, but\nwhen a lot of people have heard that there was a place where maybe you could survive through the\nwar, uh then they would come into that camp, and it would swell with people. There would be,\ninstead of a hundred, there would be two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, and the Germans\nwould allow this to happened because um, at any given time they would come with a truck, and just\nload up whoever they could find in camp that particular day, and ship them out to Treblinka if they\ndidn't have an, a full transport or anywhere else. And, uh, there was a lot of, because of that, there\nwas a lot of uh elderly people there too, and children, and they were the first ones that went out\nwith these transports. Uh, being that my father was known in town, and, and he was a little bit\ninfluential, he would hear rumors when these uh, trucks would be coming in because there was\nmore people than there were supposed to be. So, obviously, I would have to disappear. I would\neither go with my mother into the forest, and it was in, uh, in the winter. It was probably\nsometimes around the November or December, and uh, it was very cold, and I would spend\nsometimes days and nights in the forest with my mother just walking around, and trying to uh keep\nwarm. Occasionally we would knock on a farmer's door. Some of them would tell on us, and we",
        "would have soldiers looking for us, and some of them were kind enough to let us come in and they\nwould take my shoes off and dry them and give me something to drink, uh, so there were some that\nwere a little bit kind to me, but unfortunately a couple weren't nice at all. One in particular told us,\nmy mother wanted to buy some milk, buy, because she had money at the time, and the woman shut\nthe door in our faces and said she didn't have any, and we continued walking and then she in turn\nwent to the police station and told on us, that there was a mother and a child, probably Jewish. The\nGerman at the police station was not there at the time, and a Polish um...policeman, I guess, came\nafter us, and when he saw us, he told us that one of the farmers had uh come to the police station\nand told them about us, and that we should go to the camp that is just on the other side of the forest\nbecause that might be a safe haven for us. So that was a good one. And he even gave me a piece\nof bread, and we uh, we thanked him, but mother and I knew, or mother knew, and she told me,\nthat we cannot return back into the camp because the selection at that particular time has not taken\nplace yet, so 1t would not have been safe for me. At other times, I would be hiding in a, it was a\nbig, like a warehouse, where they kept some cars, and they had an office built in, in that big\nwarehouse, and on the uh roof of that office, there was um, a distance where I was then um, six, I\ncould not stand up, I had to kind of crawl around on my knees, uh between the ceiling of the big\nwarehouse and the office. That's where I had to uh lie during the day, very, very quietly, because if\nhad moved or walked, they would have heard me in the office. There were a lot of mice running\naround at the time, and rats, so whatever food I was left with, I had to eat it as soon as it was\nbrought up to me. Otherwise, it would have just disappeared. In fact, there was two other children\nthat originally had used the same hiding place as I did, and um, they refused to stay there. So,\nunfortunately they did not survive. But I stayed. This time I was good. I wasn't always. And, uh,\nuh, occasionally my father would come up for the night and spend with me a couple of hours. I\nwouldn't be alone. Or my mother would come up during the day when she wasn't missed and uh,\nthat's how um I spent my time at that camp. One of the selections that were going on, I was hidden\nwith other children in a uh, hole in the uh, in the ground where they kept potatoes, right off the\nkitchen, and uh, we were there, uh, up until the point when they were uh putting the people on the\ntrucks already. The selections have been made, and somebody must have uh, saw us going in\nthere, and they had told uh one of the Germans and there was potatoes lying over us, and we were\nactually hidden, but somebody told them exactly where we are, so he came up, and he uh\nuncovered us, he pulled up all these potatoes away. And, he looked at us, there was a few of us\nthere, and he said uh, he was there with his handgun, and he said, \"Stay here. It's not safe for you\nto come out yet.\" I, I, I guess he had enough people for this particular transport, so he had a change\nof heart, and he decided to leave us there. We were children, so we ran out. My mother was\nworking in the kitchen peeling potatoes, and she saw me coming, so a couple of the ladies and my\nmother grabbed me and put me into a barrel with sauerkraut in it until the trucks were pulled away,",
        "and uh, I was saved that time. That was a good camp. One of camp, one of the times, we were\ncaught in the selection, and we were standing in front of the gate. I don't know if it was inside the\ngate or outside the gate, and we stood and we stood and there was a line of uh Germans standing\nwith their guns, and waiting, and we were waiting and waiting, and then we were told to kneel. We\nwere lined up in rows of five, and uh my mother said to me, \"If they start shooting,\" she changed\nplaces with me actually, she went in, in front of me, and she said, if they start shooting make sure\nthat you get under me and stay there and don\u2019t move. Well, we stayed there all afternoon and for\nsome reason they decided not to shoot, so we were let back into the camp. One time we were\ncaught also in this selections, and we were taken to a ghetto. Um, that was a terrible place. People\nwere lying on the street and dying and the filth and the dirt, it was, it it's just absolutely\nunbelievable. (Sigh) My father was still left in Botsohov?? when my mother and I were caught.\nMy mother was caught only because of me. She had permission to stay in the camp. She had\npapers. I didn't, but they caught us together, so we both, my mother wouldn't have let me go alone,\nso we went together, and my father arranged with a Pole, being that he was still working outside\nthe camp occasionally in that factory, he arranged with a Pole to bring us back to Botsohov. There\nwas an underground connection, I don't know exactly how I...and we were just a few days in that\nghetto, and somebody got in touch with us that we had to make our way to escape from the ghetto,\nand make it outside of the ghetto, and um, get to the tr--uh, below , the, this particular ghetto was\non a hill, and then there was a big uh, uh whatchamal, uh, whatchamacall, uh, uh, can't even think\nnow, uh, I'll get back to that. Anyways, uh we were supposed to make it outside of the camp, uh\noutside of the ghetto and follow that Pole to the railroad station, and then...\nLet's stop because we just ran out.\nBeep.\nWhy don't you back up into that story a little bit, so that if I can't cut the two together, you start\nagain.\nUh...\nThe terrible place in the ghetto.\nOh, the ghetto. The ghetto in the hell. Uh, as I mentioned it was a terrible place. The filth and the\ndirt, and the people just lying on the street and dying. It, it was just a horrible thing to see for\nhuman beings to, to be in this kind of a situation and place. Anyways, my father had made",
        "arrangements for somebody to take us out of there. And, uh, we were told that we have to make it\nout of the ghetto, and the ghettos were not as tightly watched as uh camps, uh, down the hill,\nbecause this particular ghetto was on the hill, over the fence, and then he would be waiting for us\nand we would follow him to the railroad station, and there he would give us the tickets, and we\nwould be on our own. It's not that he in any way endangered himself. I really, I guess, didn't want\nto go down that hill because I personally have no recollection of that. The only thing, I had a\nconversation with my mother recently, and I have terrible nightmares about this particular place I\nguess. I keep running down that hill, and I'm just suspended in, in air, and then I come down and,\nand, and it's, it's quiet, it's as, as if nothing had happened. When, when my mother had told me that,\nwhen she fin--finally made me come down the hill, and we made it over the fence, the uh, there\nwas a Street uh in the city, and Polish people were walking back and forth, and it's as if they didn't\nsee us, that we were escaping from the ghetto. It was just unbelievable. We followed that man to\nthe railroad station, and uh, during the same time I guess, there was always things going on but\nthere was some sabotage that was going on, so they were very watchful in the stations for uh, uh\npeople that were involved in it. And there were two uh Germans from our town that had known my\nmother. As I had mentioned, my mother was a very beautiful woman, and...we were well-known in\ntown, and these 2 Germans had known my mother, and they had a huge big dog that they always\nwent with. We came to the gate of the uh, uh at the railroad station where they were checking you.\nWe showed them the tickets, he looked at my mother. Obviously he must have recognized her, but\nhe just told us to go on. We got on the train, and we squeezed in, and again, when the train was\nmoving, they had made their way through the train to look for um these other tourists. My mother\nmade me kind of move away her, from her slightly because she said to me, \"In case he comes and\nhe recognizes me again, and this time he takes me, you stay on the train.\" So, uh, he came by us,\nhe looked at my mother again, and he continued walking. We made it to Bot--back to Botsohov,\nwe got off this station, and we made our way along the railroad tracks back to camp. Well, it was\nin the, it was at night at that time, which was to our advantage, but they also were checking the, the\nrails at the time because of the sabotage that was going on, and a train was supposed to have come\nthrough with maybe ammunition or soldiers, I don't know which. So they were checking the train,\num there were uh 2 soldiers, manually using that platform, and as we were walking along the\nrailroad, 1t was all clear, we, we had nowhere to hide, and here this this manual uh train is coming,\nand they, the moon was bright, so my mother made me lie down parallel with the uh, with the earth,\nthe hill that was leading up to the railroad, and my mother and I lay still there, and they passed us\nby and they didn't see us. We made it back to camp, and uh we stayed in camp I don't know the\ntime span, until the camp was being um liquidated, and we were sent to uh Starhavitz??, my mother\nand I, and my father was sent to, I believe, Tregine??, but I haven't seen my father up until\nAuschwitz again. Towards the end of Auschwitz, and during the time I was just with my mother.",
        "Go back and tell me about some of the things you used to imagine. How did you pass the time\nwhen you were in the office. And who was below you when you were in the office?\nUm, Germans, um, doing um a lot of office work, because that was their office of running the uh,\nthe camp, so that's the people that were in the office. How I spent my time? Uh, dreaming. When\nmother would come up to stay with me for a few hours, she would uh tell me stories of home, of of\nthe wonderful things that we had, the wonderful times we spent together, pretending that um, the\nfamily was still alive, where she already by then knew that the rest of the family that was left in, in\nthe ghetto, um when we left for Botsohov, they had a liquidation of the ghetto then, and uh, they\nwere all taken to Treblinka, all of them. Actually, of what I heard mother say later was that they\ndid have a hiding place for them, but my grandfather coughed, so he said he didn't want to go\nbecause he will cough and they'll find him, find the hiding place, so my grandmother said well she's\nnot going to go if he's not going, and my two uncles, my aunt, and my other grandmother weren't\ngoing to go into the hiding place on their own, not knowing what was waiting for them in\nTreblinka. So they all left with the first liquidation of the ghetto, and anyways, that's how I spent\nmy time in, in camp, with the stories, and the encouragement, and the, the love that my mother was\nable to give me. Day in and day out. Uh, in the first camp that we were, food was not a problem\nbecause uh, uh I guess my father still had money and there would be food brought in from uh the\nAryan side, from the polish side, so food at that camp was not a problem, but in the other camps,\nwhen we were in Stahavitz, and then in Austratzalager??, and in Auschwitz. I mean, our portions\nwere so small to start with, um, when I finished mine, my mother's was always waiting for me\n(crying). She, she actually made me believe that she was not hungry, and whatever she had she\nshared with me. So, that's why I'm here.\nCan you talk about the time in the cornfield, when you saw other kids playing.\nOh yeah. One of the times, in, from Botsohov, when we were in uh, in the forest waiting out a\nselection, that was in the winter, and the, and during the day we had to find a place where we had to\nstand still because we couldn't move around, we would be seen, and that was near, I guess a farm,\nand maybe it was also near a school, I, I, I don't remember that. So my mother found a place uh to\nhide in um, in a cornfield or maybe it was um, like a, a starting field of trees that has, uh, low trees\nthat were just coming up next to a field, because we didn't want to go too deep into the uh forest\nbecause then the trees were tall, and there was no way to hide, they would see our shadows. So as\nwe were lying there, some children came out on the field to play ball. And one of them kicked the\nball, and it landed in front of me. The child ran over, looked at me, picked up the ball, and went",
        "back to play. I, my mother and I just couldn't believe that this actually happened. So we stayed\nthere until it got dark and then we kept on moving. And how many times did we come back to the\ncamp, and the selection still wasn't taken place, so again we would have to go out.\nWe have to reload.\nChange film, camera roll 4 is up; Sync take 4 is up.\nBeep.\nCan you tell me about the time when there were 2 kids among the 180, I don't know where, which\ncamp this was and how the SS were having a debate over what to do with you while you were ------\nOh, well what this particular incident happened when we were taken from Starhavitz uh to the\nAustritzerlager, and um, I guess people from Austritzerlagen needed more workers for the um, um,\niron works that they had, and brick factories. So, um, the people that were in charge had heard that\nuh, from Botsohov, people were taken to Starhavitz, so they were trying to get their own from the\nsame town, who, whatever was left, back to Austritzerlager. And, uh, they came with a truck, and\nuh they announced that so many, so many people they need _ to take back to Austritzerlager, they\nneed more workers. So, my mother was one of them, on, on the list, and uh, there were 2 children\ninvolved also, myself and another child that were from Austritzer originally, that were in\nStarhavitz. So, we got on the truck also, and um, for some reason, the uh camp commander, uh the,\nthe German counted us as one because we were part of this group that came originally from\nBrotsohov. When we came to Austritzerlager, the, the German uh at that camp did not want any\nchildren, and he didn't want us too, and he didn't want to have anything to do with counting us as\none because he felt that he had enough as it is. So here we're standing, the whole transport, and the\ntwo of us are taken to the side, with a German ready to execute us, and these two Germans, the one\nthat brought us, and the one that is supposed to accept us, you would think we were cattle or\nsomething, were arguing, should these 2 children be shot or should we we let into the camp as one\nperson? The person, the German that brought us defended us by saying, \"Well, in our camp, which\nwasn't exactly true, the children carry messages. They peel potatoes. Um, and the one that was\nsupposed to accept us said, \"I have enough children. I don't need this.\" And so it was going back\nand forth, until finally I guess the one that brought us won out the argument, and they decided to let\nus into the camp. It's these kind of uh situations that I cannot believe myself that happened to me\nand that I have survived. I guess the answer in my mind is that because, as these incidents came",
        "up, they were in my favor, and I survived. But how many children had gone maybe through a\nhundred of these situations, and one of them was not in their favor, and they're not with us\nanymore. So, I consider myself very fortunate to have survived because, out of fate, I suppose.\nThat's the only way I can rationalize it for reason for surviving.\nWhat were some of the things that you witnessed as being in work camps before --------, and ended\nup being transported to Auschwitz.\nWell, one particular incident was uh, I have seen a lot of dead people around all over, and I guess\nwhen you see so many it doesn't really make that much of an impression. One of the times in\nAustritzerlager, I was in the um, outhouse, in the bathroom, which was on the corner of the uh um,\narea where like, it was a big area in the center of the camp, and then all the barracks were around it.\nMostly actually on two sides . And the uh outhouse was at the corner, and I happened to have\ngone into the outhouse, and uh, all at once there is a commotion, and everybody is rushed into their\nbarracks because that's where they were supposed to go, and um, I got stuck in the bathroom. Well,\nI got up on the seat, and I looked out of the little window on the top, and what had happened is\nsome people had tried to escape, and they were caught, and, I guess they were wounded. And there\nwas some shooting going on, and they got about, I think 4 people, to dig to-graves, just outside of\nwire, the fence of the camp, and they brought these uh people that tried to escape that were uh shot\nalready, but they were not dead, and they made the other Jews bury these people that were not\nreally dead yet, and they were begging not to be buried, that they're still alive, that they should do\nsomething to kill them. But they didn't do anything, they just buried them alive. And these people\nhad to do it, or else--these poor people that were picked to do it because otherwise they themselves\nwould have wound up in...dead. That was a very very traumatic experience. I can still hear the\nscreaming (cries--pause).\nDo you want a break now?\nNo, I'm fine. I'm fine.\nTell me how you think your parents had the foresight, somehow knew and somehow managed to\nrescue both their daughters.\nMy father was a very protective parent, and uh, there was a lot of unrest going on because I heard\nstories that actually weren't planning on having me either, since I was born in 1935, and there was\nalready talk of war. So, I wasn't actually a welcome addition at this particular time. But I came",
        "and they accepted me, and I think I brought them a lot of joy. Anyways, um, my father made\narrangements, for instance, we had an aunt in Brazil, that if for some reason we are sent to parts of\nthe country, and we don't make it back for one reason or another, that uh, there was a gentile left\nwith information to get in touch with my aunt, and she would take my sister especially because she\nwas sure that my sister would survive. Uh, that my aunt will um take my sister and this particular\nman to Brazil, uh, as a reward for uh getting in touch with my aunt, if, for some reason, my father\nand mother don't survive. That was one of the things that my father arranged. My father arranged\nfor my sister's uh being with a family that had a piano, and that made sure that my sister would get\na continuous education, that was his foresight also. He wanted to make sure that her education\ngoes on because it was very important to him. And um, he was, I heard a story, my sister has a\nmark on her forehead, a burn mark on her forehead. You have to understand that our homes,\nalthough um we lived very comfortably, we did not have any running water. We had water\nstanding in the corner of the kitchen, uh, a wood barrel with water that they uh a man brought every\nday and filled up the water for us. So, eating fruit without being washed was unheard of in our\nhouse, and it wasn't just washed with water, but it had to be washed with boiling water, and my fa--\nmy sister wanted an apple, and my father went to wash the apple with the boiling water from the\nkettle, and she pulled on his sleeve, and it spilled and it burned her. So even in those days, my\nfather was so protective of us, that he wanted to make sure that we grow up healthy, and that\neverything that we eat is clean and without any germs. So he, he really had a foresight, and he was\nvery, very protective of us.\nWe're just about to run out. I won't make it through a question.\nBeep.\nCan you describe the transport to Auschwitz and the arrival there.\nI remember being shoved into cattle cars. It was um, very crowded, and uh, my mother\nmaneuvered me over to the uh wall of the uh car because that gave me a chance to breathe. You\nsee, being little, I mean, 1t was in 1944, I was about 8, and uh, I was small. I'm not really that tall\nnow, but I, I was undernourished, and, and skinny and uh so here all I could see was the uh people's\nfeet actually. So, it was a little bit hard to breathe. And my mo-my mother maneuvered me over to\nuh, the wall of the car, and um, that's where we stood. We were squeezed in and we were given\ntwo pails. I think one was for water and the other one was for elimination. I I I'm not quite sure,\nbut I just remember those two pails. And, uh, they shut the door with a bang, and the train started\nmoving. At and, I think we were on the go for about 4 days. I'm not sure how much, but we did",
        "stop on the way, and uh, I, I remember either people leaving the train and getting water or Poles\nbringing water to the trai--to the uh cars, to the cattle cars, I don't remember, but I know that we\nwere given some water and some bread. And, um, oh, but when the train started, then we all had to\nsit down at the same time because one person could not sit and another stand. You, you couldn't\nbreathe. You were on the floor, and you, you had all these mass of people around you. So we all\nsat down, and then when some people wanted to stand up, we all had to stand up a t the same time.\nI was little, and I would be picked up to look out of the window, because there was a little window\nin the cattle car, uh, with uh steel grates on it, and uh, they would ask me to uh point out landmarks\nbecause we really didn't know where we were going. Being that we were coming from a working\ncamp, we were told that we were going to another working camp. We really did not, of the\nconversation that I remember, that we were going to Auschwitz, not that I knew what Auschwitz\nmeant, but uh, this, the, the story was that at the time that was going around is that we were going\nto another working camp. And, uh, on the way to Auschwitz, we, the train did stop a couple of\ntimes, and the doors opened and uh, we were replenished with some water. And uh, then finally,\nvery early in the morning. Was just about uh, I think we arrived in Auschwitz, and again I was\npicked up, and I was uh, starting to give the people the landmarks around, and uh people started\nscreaming and crying and uh, I suppose they realized where we were. I didn't know. Didn't mean\nto me anything. Then, finally, there ca--the train came to a stop, the doors opened, and uh,\nscreaming, \"Raus, raus!\" \"Get out, get out from the train!\" When, when I came to the platform, it\nwas very, very foggy. Could hardly see anything, and slowly as the fog lifted, it was to the left of\nme that I saw a fence, well, uh, uh, straight ahead of me there were um fences that I, I, I've never\nseen before because they were rounded off with electric wires. I didn't know what that meant. But\nto the left of me, in fact I...tried to recollect it when I was there this spring, but I, I, I couldn't make\nit out. I saw this big fence covered with uh, with blankets, and people would peek out to see this\ntransport coming up, and as the um fog lifted a little more, we saw the chimneys. These huge,\nenormous chimneys, with the smoke billowing from them. That was my first glimpse of\nAuschwitz. We were taken off the cars, the cattle cars, and we stood on the platform, or sat down\non the platform with our little bundle of clothes, whatever we had left. As we arrived, for 24 hours,\nwithout any bread, without any water, without any anything. It was uh, in the summer in 1944, I\nguess they didn't quite know what to do with us at this point. Should we go straight into the\ncrematoriums, into the ovens, or if we should be let into the camp because we did come, what they\ncall an iron paper--we're from a working camp, so we should not have gone through a selection.\nAnd, um, also, Mengele was sick, or had a cold or something, so he wasn't available to do his usual\nselections. So we were waiting for 24 hours. And then finally the decision was made, it wasn't\nvery, too many um, transports that came in without a selection. We were one of them. I'm saying\nthat only from what I have seen after I came in and I saw what was happening to the other, all other",
        "transports that I'm saying it, I have no uh, history or, or information of actually what had happened\nbefore I came to Auschwitz. Um, we were, the decision was made for us to be allowed to go into\nthe camp. And, uh, we were given then something to eat, and uh, they gave us the number. We\nwere all given numbers. And uh, the people that were peeking through the uh, uh blankets from\nthat area, and what we called Canada, the, the people that came to uh help the uh transports get off\nthe trains and uh get off the cattle cars and, and um, um help with the selection and take all the\nclothes and everything else or tell us what to do. Um, we were very surprised that the few children,\nthere weren't many of us, but the few that did come with the transport were given numbers and\nwere allowed to get into the camp. So that's how we got into Auschwitz. The men were separated\nfrom the women. And uh, my mother and I were taken to uh, ------------, we used to call it, it's B-2-\nB uh lager. And, we stayed there for a few months. Oh, wait a minute, before we went in, we were\ntaken in to be showered and bathed because we were, I guess, full of lice and dirt. So, the clothes,\neverything was taken away from us. We were taken into a big hall, and uh, and the row kind of\nmoved on completely naked. And this was actually the first time that I have seen my mother\ncompletely naked. And all the other women. I, I, I've never seen it, and, and, they were just\nstanding there and kind of holding their hands together, and the Germans walking back and forth\nwith their little um, whatever you call it that they were hitting with, a leather strip. If you didn't\nmove fast enough. And uh, we kept on moving down the line. The only thing that was left for us\nwas the shoes. We were allowed to keep our shoes, but the shoes we had to immerse in some kind\nof a liquid, and go on into a huge room where water came down from the ceiling. That was the\nshower. We were shaved completely. Hair shaved off. And we came out on the other side of the\nbuilding. At least that's what it seemed like, I, I don't know, maybe we went in a circle, I don't\nknow. It's not standing anymore so I couldn't find out exactly. And we were each thrown a piece\nof clothes, and it seemed that it worked out that the tall women--\nLet's stop and reload. We just ran out.\nBeep.\nOkay, why don't you describe registration, what that involved.\nWell, registration was that at first um, after the 24 hours, they decided to let us in to the camp\nwithout a selection, and we were all given the numbers. And the few children that came were also\ngiven the numbers, which was very unusual, and we were uh shown or told to go into a a huge\nbuilding, where, where we were undressed completely undressed, and uh we were allowed to keep\nour shoes, that was the only thing. We were completely shaved, and uh, kept moving in line",
        "towards, that I later found out was the showers. There was a lot of crying from the people because,\nI guess they knew that it might not be just a shower. Uh, for me, I was shocked to have seen for the\nfirst ttme my mother completely naked. And everybody else around me. And they were kind of\ntrying to, to hide from all these Germans that were walking back and forth, and uh, disregarded all\nthis mass of, of, of women, completely naked. Uh, we uh, were uh, encouraged or, or pushed into\ngoing into this room where there was uh showerheads uh in the ceilings, and water came down, and\nwe were, we got our showers, and then uh, it seems to me, I don't know if I'm right, we came out on\nthe other side of the bldg. We had to dip our shoes in some kind of a liquid to disinfect that too, so\nwe were pretty clean once we got out of there. At the other end, we each received a piece of\nclothes, a dress, and uh, it was as if it was set up, that a tall woman would get a real short dress, and\na, a little woman would get a long dress, and they weren't willing to switch because obviously it\nwas more favorable to have a lower dress, a longer dress because it was more protective, and, with\neverybody feeling um, so upset going into the bldg, and crying and, and not knowing what is\nwaiting for us all, when this group came out at the other end, everybody started laughing because\nthey looked at each other, and they saw what they looked like with the shaved heads and the, the\npieces of cloth over them . It was so comical, in spite of all this horror that was going around us,\nthat the women started laughing. And uh, that really was comical. And then we were uh told to go\ninto a um, we were led to a barrack in uh Lager B and uh, it was called Be Zvei Be, which is\nactually B-2-B, but I guess either in German or in Yiddish it is Be Zvei Be. And I had tried to ask\nmy mother what block we were in when I went to Auschwitz this spring, but uh she said she wasn't\nquite sure if it was 16 or 17. But, it really didn't matter, nothing much 1s left of it. We were a few\nmonths together in that um block. I uh, contracted the uh, the measles, a child's disease, and I was\ntaken to the hospital. It was a rather severe case. My mother came to visit me every day, and I was\nuh, on the higher ------------of the uh bunk, bunk beds, and uh, like always, she was always there\nthrowing up because there was an opening between the uh, the ceiling and the wall, when it came\ndown like this, there was an opening and she would throw bread up to me. I, I guess I kind of\nexpected it from her, I, so um, I don't know how long I was uh in the hospital, but um, not long\nenough because when the nurse in the hospital heard that there was going to be a selection in the\nhospital, she discharged whoever was able to possibly walk. I still had all my uh spots on me, and I\nhad uh, I guess, was still running a fever, but she discharged me, and uh, the procedure was that\nyou left the hospital, which was at one end of the camp, and that was in the winter, and you would\ngo down the center of the uh, uh camp, and they would let off whichever uh block you came out of\nto go into the uh, hospital. Well, mine was pretty much at the other end of uh, the uh camp. When\nI finally made it into the uh barrack, and some of our friends and my mother took one look at me,\nhearing they couldn't because, hear me they couldn't because I've lost my voice so I couldn't talk at\nall, and uh, according to the people they, it's their favorite story to talk about me how I looked at",
        "the time. I was green and um and couldn't speak and none of them believed that I was going to\nsurvive. Well I came into camp, into the barrack, and stayed a couple of days, and there was\nanother selection, there was a selection for uh, they kept us very clean and very healthy, for a, a\nskin disease, it was called Schvierzba, in Polish, I really don't know what it 1s, it's some kind of\nenzyme, and they had a special block for that too. So, they mistook, and they, that would come up\non the uh, the wrists and under the arms, uh little pimples, and they had a special medication for\nthat, but you had to go to that block. Well, they mistook my spots from the measles for that disease,\nand they yanked me to go to that block. And every time you were selected into a certain area, these\nwere the areas that had the selections to go into the uh, the gas chambers if they didn't have enough\npeople that were coming in, in a transport. I mean, these were the first that were selected. So\nwhen you went anywhere out of the ordinary, it was bad. So when I was going to be taken to the\nKutzablock, my mother wouldn't let me go by myself, so she came along with me. So again, she\nendangered her own life, for a maybe of saving mine if any way there was a possibility. Because at\nthis point really, it didn't really matter if she was there with me or not. She would just be one more\nperson that would be in the same situation, but she went along with me. We had difficulty getting\nout of that block because instead of the uh spots going away with this medication, it spread because\nit became infected. And on top of it, I caught uh pneumonia so I was coughing, and through some\nmiracle, I got throu, through a selection by holding whatever dress I had, we had to parade in front\nof the doctor to see that we have no more spots on us, and I had a whole infection under my arm,\nso I would put the, that dress over this shoulder, and squeeze through, and, and, and I got out of that\nblock with my mother. We came back to our regular block for a short time and um we were\nseparated. I was taken into the children's block. Now, during the time that I was with my mother,\nand every morning at four o clock we were stay, standing for the appel, where we had to be\ncounted, until about nine when the sun came out, and then we were again put into the block.\nOccasionally, the blockeldester, the woman that was in charge of the block felt sorry for the couple\nof kids that were there, and she would allow us to wait inside the uh, the block, and come out as the\nGermans got closer, as Mengele got closer to count us. Occasionally, there were rumors, for\ninstance, that they, they were needing more people for the crematoritums because it was getting\nslow, the transports were coming in slow. So, what was on our mind, what we shared with the\nchildren, I didn't share that with my mother, was finding places where to hide. In Auschwitz, we\nwere to hide. Under a blanket, they would find it because they would strip the beds. Uh, the um,\nthere was nowhere to hide in the barracks. But the barracks, the barrack that was next to ours was a\nplace where--",
        "We have to reload. That was quick.",
        "Beep.",
        "Before we go to where to hide in Auschwitz, let's go back and tell me about what you thought was\ngoing on with the transports, how you didn't realize what was going on, and how you gradually\ncame to figure it out.",
        "Well, one of the ways really is from hearing people talk about it. Very openly. And, um, I don't\nknow, as a child, I kind of accepted things as they were happening, because there was nothing I\ncould do about it but try to stay ahead to survive. For some reason or other, that was the most\nimportant thing, is to survive. That's all you heard everybody say, \"Oh, we've got to survive and\ntell the world what is going on.\" I mean this is, that was it. I mean, if only for that reason, just\nbecause it was just unbelievable, and this idea that that you go up in smoke became a real, a reality\nbecause people would come, a transport would come in with a lot of people, and they would move\ninto a certain direction and then they would disappear. They would never come out. So you\nrealize that something is happening to them, and seeing the, the chimneys smoking continuously,\nespecially after a transport, even at my age, you kind of put 2 and 2 together and realized that, yes,\nthis 1s where you go, behind those, that fence that has the uh, the blankets? on it, and the trees\nhovering, something that goes on behind there, that you go in and you don't come out anymore.\nExactly what was happening, I don't know. All I knew is that you come out the chimney. And as\nthe uh crematoriums were working, it, it left such a sweet taste in your mouth that you didn't even\nfeel like eating. During these times, I can honestly say, I, at times I wasn't even hungry because it\nwas so sickening. I, I guess from people's talking and, and kind of putting 2 and 2 together,\nrealizing that once you go behind that fence, that's it. In fact, one of the times I thought it was\ngoing to happen to me. When we left the Kretzablock with my mother, we weren't just taken\nstraight to the barrack because that would be unclean, so we were taken for showers, and when the\ngroup was being moved towards that fence, I also thought that it was the end, for, I I don't know\nreally what happened then because we were taken behind that fence, and we were showered, and\nwe had seen the people that worked with the ovens in the in in the crematoriums, and they were\njust, they were so odd, odd about me, I mean they were so surprised that a child is still alive. They\ndidn't know what to do with me, in fact I had some chicken soup. I guess they were fed very well\nbecause the Germans there ate very well. They gave me some chicken soup and bread, and there\nwas one German woman that took me into a um, one barrack that had clothes, all sorted out, and\num, hundreds and hundreds of shirts and, and pants and, and, and dresses and shoes, but not\nchildren's sizes, they were all uh women's sizes. So she dressed me, and she gave me a pair of\nshoes because mine were pretty worn out by then, on a he, a he, a heel. They were actually like a, a\nnurse's shoe, as they used to wear at the time uh, with laces in the front. Uh, she gave me those",
        "shoes because she didn't have any on the, on uh, without a heel, so I really don't know what\nhappened at that time, I don't know why we did not go through the route and, and went into the gas,\nthe gas chambers. I really don't know, but we came out, and we were taken back into the block.\nAnd now tell me about trying to find a hiding place.\nWell, the hiding place where I thought was pretty smart of me was next door to our block was a\nblock where they used to throw the skeletons of the dead people. There were skeletons at the time,\nalready, and uh, when the block got full, then they would come with the truck, and take it over to\nthe crematoriums. Well, this person and I were trying to find a way of making a little hole in\nbetween those skeletons, and see if we can get in there and hide until the uh, selection takes place.\nOr maybe somebody will come and rescue us. So this is the kind of place that we were playing and\ntrying to find a hiding place among the corpses. There wasn't a stitch of clothes or anything on\nthem, so they were gone through, it was just bones. And we tried to arrange them in such a way\nthat we would have a hiding place, in case we need tt.\nHow did the other inmates feel about you being a child there?\nWe uh we, we were a small group from our town that kind of stayed together, and they were\nprotective of me. Uh, they wouldn't risk their life, their lives for me, but they would try to be\nprotective. Uh, for instance, uh, there was a certain amount of people that uh slept in one um uh\nbridge. You had to lie, I think was 6 in a row, and it was pretty close together, because if one\nturned, everybody had to turn at the same time. These six people allowed, or five people including\nmy mother, allowed me to squeeze in, in the middle. I wasn't a person. So, wherever I was, it had\nto be tolerated by the people around me, and these were people from our town that were quite\nprotective of me. And, uh, we keep in touch with some of them that have survived, and I'm very\nthankful for what they have done for me.\nWere there incidents where inmates resented you because you put them in danger, or people who\nweren't from your town who protected you because you were, represented their child to them?\nUh, I don't know of any particular uh, uh incident. I think I was resented only for the fact that I was\nstill alive , and they have lost their children. I think that was very painful to them--that they didn't\nhave their children, and, and, and my mother still had me. Uh, and, and I felt bad, many times, but\nnot that I was endangering their lives because they were not protecting me in such a way. But the\nunfortunate thing is that under the circumstances that even mothers many times uh did not",
        "acknowledge their children. For instance, during one selection, the men and the women and the\nelderly were men and the children were all separated at that particular time. And uh, you never\nknow what they wanted to do or, or what they had in mind they were going to do with us, and the\norder was that the mothers of the children to go over to the children's group and take their child out.\nWell, my mother walked over and uh, with gentle firmness took my hand and acknowledged me\nand took me over the group, and she knew that at least, everybody else knew that this was like uh\nsigning your death certificate because a child wasn't supposed to be there. Another child, that was\nstanding next to me noticed that her mother wasn't making any move towards her just walked\nbehind me and stood next to my mother. And uh, my mother felt that well, what's the difference if\nit's one or two, it doesn't make any difference, so she didn't reject her in any way. The children that\nwere left without the parents accepting them disappeared. I don't know what happened to them.\nBut, I, I can't really blame that mother either that didn't acknowledge her child. I mean it was the,\nthe, the desire to live is so great. It, it, it just, it's all you really thought about is to survive. And\nyou, you, you were all, you were willing to do almost anything, just to survive.\nWe have to reload.\nBeep.\nI want you to try to paint a picture for me of what the children's block in Auschwitz was. Define it.\nIt's an incongruous idea that there should be a children's block, and what was it for, and what was\nit like?\nI really at the time did not know what it was for, and uh, I didn't find it to be any different than any\nother block, that I had been in. I just was at the time of my life where I just didn't care because my\nmother had left. My mother left right after, a few days after I was separated from her in Auschwitz.\nShe was sent out of Auschwitz. She came to tell me that she was being put on a, she was put on a\nlist that she is being transported out to another camp. And, mmm, my uh life came to an end at the\ntime. I mean, it just wasn't important anymore. I realized uh what it meant to have her around me,\nuh, here encouragement, her uh, her telling me good stories instead of dwelling on, on what was\naround me. So, after the point that she came and told me that she was leaving, and I was being left\nalone in Auschwitz. I didn't care what was going on. I really didn't. Didn't mean to me anything.\nI didn't. Food wasn't important. I was hungry. All at once, I became very hungry, but I didn't even\ncare about that. It's, 1t was just an existence at that point. And I, I wouldn't have done anything to\nsave myself. It was just a matter of circumstances that I survived after that. There was a uh, a very\nun, unexpected thing that had happened. While I was in in the children's block, uh, I, for some",
        "reason I rem, things come back to me that I remember that at that point, we were not told to do\ncertain things, or, or made to do certain things. They had a way of coming in and asking for\nvolunteers. We are going on an outing right now. Would you like to come. They were sending a\ngroup of children to a country where there is no war. That everything is going to be wonderful.\nFood is plentiful and everything is great. Who would like to go? Well, I didn't care. I didn't offer\nto go. Maybe that's what saved me because I don't know what happened to the other children. I\nknow some from our town that had gone on an outing like this, and never came back. So, that's the\nrecollections I have of the children's block. Just...not caring. Oh yeah, at one point, they also gave\nus some sheets, and pillows and pillow cases, and we had to make our beds nicely. The Red Cross\ncame and looked at us, and I think we were given a special dinner also at the time. But there is\nsomething very un, unexpected and unusual happened, and too, I mentioned in the beginning that\nme, I had seen my father in Auschwitz. Well, word came to me that my father was in the next\ncamp over in the man's camp. And uh, arranged w-to, I should be at a certain time behind a certain\nblock, that he'll be on the other side in his camp, through the electric wires we had a meeting.\n(Sigh) That's a terrible thing. And, I, I looked at him, and that was very nice. I had lost my mother\nthat I was very close with, and I guess I must have felt that he had abandoned us because he just\nwasn't there when we needed him, when I needed him (crying), and I must have been very\nindifferent to him. He tried to ask me what I need, what I want. I told him I don't need anything. I\ndon't want anything. But then yes, I did tell him I needed, ah, stupid thing, I needed underpants. It's\nhard to admit for a child that age can't hold her urine, but when you get very scared and you start\nshaking, you lose control, and it isn't that it's a lot that comes out, but just little bits, so my panties\nwere always wet. So I had asked him, I said, \"Oh, that's what I need.\" So he had given me some,\nthrown over the wires some cigarettes, I should go into that first block where they uh uh have uh\nGermans and Poles live, and and they have money and they have food, actually food, not money,\nand I should exchange it for whatever I need. I took the cigarettes, I went there, and I didn't do a\nthing with it, and the next time when I met him, I gave him back the cigarettes. I just didn't want\nanything from him. I must have hurt him terribly. (Crying). He kept telling me to make sure that I\nleave with the last uh transport because they were starting to evacuate Auschwitz. And, uh, he told\nme how important it 1s, that I will not survive if I stay there, that when the last transport goes, that I\nshould do everything possible to get on it. Well, I listened. I don't know if I deliberately didn't do\nanything about it, or if I tried, I, I really don't, don't know I tried to think about it, but I, I wasn't\naccepted. He did leave. He didn't survive. I stayed, and I did...I don't know...But, I'm not proud of\nmyself, how I hurt him at the time. It weighs very heavily on me since it was the last time that I've\nseen him.",
        "Talk to me about how your mother constantly conditioned you for survival.",
        "Well, when I was with her, she was always pointing out the way that um I could hide or do certain\nthings, like go behind her when there might be shooting so I would not be shot. Uh, I think the, the\nstories and the pleasant uh memories that she kept telling me to, to keep me safe because life was\nso cruel around me, uh, there was so much constant death and pain and, and, and suffering, uh, that,\nshe was trying to put little bits of good in my mind. I should uh not dwell on what is going around,\naround me. By giving up of her food constantly, making me believe that she's never hungry, and\nnever needs anything. By the way, my mother was fasting 2 days a week in camp, not that she\nneeded to do it, but she actually did not have any water or food. It was something that she promised\nherself to do so we should survive. My mother was a religious, is and was a religious woman, and\nshe felt that she gives up food twice a week, that her children will survive. We did. So, uh, my\nmother is very, was a very, very strong woman to be able to do the things that she had done, to\nprotect me, and to always be next to me. And uh, just give me this, this extra little bit of, of uh\ndesire to survive. That there is a better day, that that things will be okay, tomorrow. To just get\nthrough today.\nHow did she comfort you for the fear? Can you talk a little about fear that you felt?\nBeep.\nTalk about how she comforted you for the fear, and talk about fear first, 1n whatever context.\nWell, when you stand in front of a gun, and you know that this might be your last moment, when\nyou see people being shot around you, and you might be next, then you start shaking. At least I do.\nMy knees kind of quiver. And, I can't control my urine. It's, it it was just one of those things.\nAnd she would uh try to get my mind off of what is going on around me at that particular time. She\nwould come up with a very pleasant and wonderful picture of what life was like at home, of the\ngrandparents. I wasn't always a good child, and do whatever she told me to in order to save my\nown life. Uh, if we had to go to a forest at one time, and I just refused to go back out, I, I, I did. I\nmean, I felt that was enough. And I didn't want to. She never reprimanded me for it. If, so she\nsaid, \"Well, if you don't want to go, so I won't go either.\" So we both stayed, and as it happened,\nthe way circumstances are that people that had gone into the forest at that time were apprehended\nand shot. We didn't go. You can say a child's foresight, I don't know. But she never reprimanded\nme for not doing what she wanted me to do, and I didn't do it. She never, she knew, for instance,\nthat I had difficulty hold, eh, that I'm...not able to uh control myself, and she would never\nreprimand me for it. Ever. In fact there is something that we have going between us that is maybe",
        "difficult for other people to understand, and I think, especially, my sister, because we have such\ncloseness between my mother and I, that although my accomplishments are not as great as my\nsister's really because um, she is more observant, more religious than my mother would like that I\nam, and um, her children are very successful and she has, -------- or ten grandchildren. Yet, when I\naccomplish something, it is so much more meaningful to my mother because of what of what we\nhave gone through, and as if, we don't talk about it, but it's as if, my God, the way you were in\nAuschwitz, from you, you had three normal children. I drove my obstetrician crazy. Will my\nchildren be normal? When they were born, I was counting their toes and fingers to make sure. Yet\nI didn't want anyone around me to know how stupid I am. I really want to live, wanted to live a, a\nnormal life, and I think my mother helped me do that. We reminisce about the past, but we don't\ntalk about the horrors. I had a very comfortable relationship with my mother after the war, where\nshe allowed me to let out this frustration, and to be normal. To feel that my accomplishment will\nbe, that my normalcy was not destroyed, that I am the same as everyone else, that I did not survive\nas a Shell, but as a human being that can feel. I really am afraid my feelings. I, I even now have\nnightmares, but I'm afraid, really, to shut those things out because I want to continue to feel the\npleasure of my children's accomplishments, my grandchildren. I want to, this is what I want to\naccomplish is to have a normal life, and enjoy what I have. My mother helped me do that. She\nreally did.\nYour mother is a hero.\nShe certainly is.\nDoes your mother feel that it's an achievement?\nWhen I accomplish something, then it's an achievement for her. She takes pride in it. I can feel it.\nAnd it's not such great achievements. Uh, my achievements I said as not as great as my sister's, and\nI think my sister maybe senses that my mother feels that mine is greater, but the only way I can\nassociate it with is if you have a child that is disabled, and then finally takes that first step, it's a\nmuch greater thing than when uh your normal child takes a step at nine months. And, I guess it\nmust be difficult for my sister to have to live with this. Although, she's the one that has the\nresponsibility of my mother now because she lives in Toronto, my mother lives in Toronto, and I\nlive here, and I'm the good daughter that calls and goes to visit, and uh, whatever I do is my big\naccomplishment. And, uh, it must be very difficult for my sister.\nDoes your mother feel that she saved you?",
        "She has never said it. Never said it. No. And if I bring up an incident where I feel that she she has\nsaved me by going with me or insisting on me going somewhere with her, she just, what else do\nyou expect me to do? You're my child. That's what is expected of me. And that's why I say she's,\nshe was and is a very strong woman.\nHow do you feel about humankind in general, in light of your life experiences.\nAbout human life?\nHumankind, humanity.\nWell, uh, I am concerned that humanity is not learning from the past. That's what worries me. I\nknow that you can't always understand the horrors of what had happened, but maybe with what I'm\nsaying, and others like me, um, it can be understood a little better, and then humanity can avoid\nsomething like this happening again. I was very bitter after the war, towards everybody. How they\nallowed me to, to be, to go through such a misery for so long, and then on top of it, I didn't even\nknow for a few months that my mother survived, or my father, which he didn't, and I was terribly\nangry at everything and everybody because nobody even cared after I survived, that I survived. I\nhad to be protected even after that. When we were in the orphanage in Krakow, we were not\nallowed to go out, because some people felt that we should not have survived. And it was not safe\nto go out from our house, from the house that we were kept in, in the garden. That was the only\nplace we were allowed to go, and the war wasn't even over then. It was the spring of 45. So after\nsurviving all this, and my God, the thoughts, the hate that I had, the things that I was going to do to\nthe Germans for doing these things to us. It it's awesome for a child to even think about these, you\nknow, I I'm even afraid to think about them now myself. I was going to be a butcher. The things\nthat I was going to do to revenge. And then, actually with the help of mother, to try to forget the\npast, I realized that living a normal life, and continue being to, be able to feel and enjoy, that I was\nnot destroyed. So, I hope that, with this interview that uh, maybe others will understand and not\nallow a thing like this to happen again.\nThank you.\nLet's stop. We have to do one more thing. We all have to be quiet--\nThe following is 30 seconds of room tone for interview with Ruth Webber.",
