        "A: Oh, it is just \u2014 I never thought that she was hi\u2014 we couldn\u2019t deal with her. She\nwas out of our range, or something. It was by the way she was a girl.",

        "A: I th\u2014I\u2014I would say, we were a happy family. We didn\u2019t know how bad the\nmarriage was between our parents, first. It started in \u00b042, when the marriage broke \u2014\nnearly broke. But before, and also where the children were together, it was always a\nbig laughter.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Always. We were fond of each other.",
        "Q: That is what I wanted to get a sense of.",
        "A: That\u2019s for sure. And we also played with Gitty(ph), with our next older girl, but\nit wasn\u2019t the same \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 as Mike and me. And we had a lot of adventures, and \u2014 everywhere.",
        "Q: Such as? What kind of adventures would little \u2014",
        "A: Stealing, lying, fishing, which was not allowed, and hurting other people, and\nwhen the grand \u2014 our grandmother, the mother of my father was living with us in\nPoland, in the castle of Kressendorf, Sigrid told that \u2014 told us she is a witch. So\nwe \u2014 we did a lot of awful things like putting dirt in front of her door, where her\napartment was [indecipherable] we had a really adventurous life.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: When you say these things, though, stealing and lying can be serious, or they can\nbe the sorts of things all children do, that is candies, or \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014I\u2014I won\u2019t say that other children are doing this.",
        "Q: Okay, so these \u2014",
        "A: I think I have \u2014 I have thought about myself a lot of it. For instance, we got a lot\nof toys. Every visitor to my father, brought a lot of toys for the children, especially\nfor Mikey and me.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we got \u2014 we got the toys, and we went to our rooms, and we immediately\ndestroyed the toys. We also, for instance with our trains, and we had lorries, which\nwe're driving, some sort. We always were building accidents. We were never\ninterested in the normal playing that the train 1s rolling through a room. Was boring.\nBut if you build up accidents, where you demolish all these \u2014 these new toys, we\nwere happy. And I would say one of the reasons is that our parents, and all the other\ngrownups, knew exactly that they don\u2019t have to do nothing in Poland, and they saw\nall the hanged people, Polish ones, they saw the Jews with the stars, they saw the\nhungry faces, they knew exactly what \u2014 that they committed every day the most\nhorrible crimes, and they all were involved, and this bad conscious they had \u2014 it\u2019s\nJune 6, 2016\nmy interpretation \u2014 went down in a certain way, to the children. And therefore, we\nare destroying everything which we got as gift. My interpretation.",
        "Q: Okay. But it would have been a silent kind of transmittal. That is, nobody told\nyou, of the grownups.",
        "A: No, no, never.",
        "Q: Of course not.",
        "A: No, never.",
        "Q: Were you, in the German word, verwohnt? Spoiled?",
        "A: Yes. My \u2014 my father and my mother wasn\u2019t interested to \u2014 to educated us, and to\n\u2014 something like typical German people. It was all Hilde(ph). She decided what we\nhave to eat, and where. It was not special, and we \u2014 nobody told us that we are\nprinces of the governor general, something like this. So we were \u2014 in this way, we\nwere quite normal, but we knew, as I told you with my little car, we knew that we\nhave some important guy in the background.",
        "Q: Yes, but did Hilde(ph) ever discipline you? That is, if you \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 did something wrong \u2014",
        "A: No, I\u2014 I don\u2019t remember that she ever \u2014 she never clapped me, or \u2014",
        "Q: Or talked to you and say, this is not something that you should be doing?\nJune 6, 2016",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. She must have, for sure. She must have.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But in a good way.",
        "Q: Yeah. Because in every child\u2019s life, the sense of what is right, and what is\nwrong, has to be introduced by somebody.",
        "A: That was Hilde(ph). That was Hilde(ph).",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "A: But in a informal way. She never gave us lessons. Today we speak about not\nstealing.",
        "Q: Of course, of course. But it\u2019s \u2014 you know, if your parents weren\u2019t involved, if\nthey were, you know, distracted, or doing other things, somebody had to.",
        "A: Yeah, that was Hilde(ph).",
        "Q: That was her. Tell me a little bit about your mother. And what do you remember\nof her during those years. Like I said with your father.",
        "A: Just \u2014 I really \u2014 it was after the war that I really started to get some knowledge of\nwho my mother was.",
        "Q: Okay, are there episodes? Like we ask \u2014 you know, you remember your father\nwith the shaving cream, and in the Bellevue and \u2014June 6, 2016",
        "A: Oh yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s one scene, the castle of Kressendorf was a little bit like\nVersailles, but very smaller. But from one room to the \u2014 on the other side, you have\nto go about a hundred meters. So, our children rooms were on this side, and the\napartment of my mother was right on the other side. And Mikey told me, now let\u2019s\nbe funny. You run to our mother, telling her that Mikey is dead. And he lay down. I\nwas, oh, that\u2019s a very good idea. And run along this \u2014 in the first floor, this long\ncorridor. And my mother was sitting naked in the bath [indecipherable]. And I said\nto her, Mutte(ph), Mutte(ph), der Micky ist tot. Mother, Mother, Michael is dead.",
        "Q: Michael is dead.",
        "A: And she jumped, naked as she was, jumped out, took a towel, and run behind me\nto the room where \u2014",
        "Q: Through this long corridor.",
        "A: \u2014 this long corridor, wet, every \u2014 and entered really, and mi \u2014 Mikey was lying\ndead. And she knelt down, and then Mikey started to laugh. And I got the clap into\nmy face of my mother, she was so horrified. But this also is a scene which shows to\nme, children knew there\u2019s something wrong. Where we are living, what we are\ndoing, and so, I think it.",
        "Q: What kind of a person was Michael? I asked about all the others, but about him,\nwhat kind of a \u2014June 6, 2016",
        "A: Michael was \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 as your first play \u2014 playmate?",

        "Q: Well, he\u2019s your older brother.",
        "A: Yes, but he was really, really great guy. And he loved especially, his father.",
        "Q: He loved your father.",
        "A: Oh, very much.",
        "Q: How did this show itself?",
        "A: Ah, he always was looking for him, I would say. It\u2019s my remembrance. I \u2014 I\ncould put it on \u2014 on really on scenes, but you \u2014 you know what your brother is like,\nthat he loved your father more than me.",
        "Q: Even when you were a little boy?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: When you compare it that way?June 6, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, you have to remember the scene, when I was very young, and from this\npoint when I was running around the round table, there was a really, healthy\ndistance between my father and me.",
        "Q: When he called you a stranger.",
        "A: Yeah. And don\u2019t let me get into his arms. And this was \u2014 it was my s \u2014 it saved\nme. It saved me, because later Mikey defended, like three others, our father, the\ninnocent victim. I never did. So I had an \u2014 I had an advance. But he loved \u2014 back to\nMikey, he loved him very much, and he was very sad when he was hanged. And \u2014",

        "A: It was \u2014 the oldest brother, Norman, became an alcoholic. The second \u2014 the\neldest daughter, Sigrid emigrated with her second husband to South Africa,\nbecause they liked very much the apartheid. Michael drank a lot of milk, til he was\ndying.

        "A: I\u2014I would say so. I would say so. I may \u2014 maybe at \u2014 and I\u2019m very, very happy\nthat he was hanged. I am completely against death penalty, but in this case, he had\nearned it. And imagine he would have survived? He would have poisoned my brain,\nwhen you are young. That\u2019s not easy, to live with a guy who was so well educated\nas my father was.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019ll come to that. We\u2019|l come to that.",

How come he doesn\u2019t do\nit, \u2019'm being rejected? And that\u2019s the feeling you had of distance? Is this what I\u2019m\ntrying to understand?",

        "A: You feel it, and you \u2014 you have only two possibilities. You endure it, or you are\nbroken. And with me I was happy that I could endure it. Maybe because of Mikey,June 6, 2016\nbecause I was very happy with Mikey. Maybe because of Hilde(ph), because I was\nvery happy also with Hilde. Maybe because of all the others around being so\nexperienced, because of my little car, because of all what I experienced. Becaut of \u2014\nbecause of killing fishes, and killing birds around the lake of Schliersee. A lot of\nother thing were good for me.",

        "Q: Yeah, it\u2019s October.",
        "A: And she took us to a walk, and told us that now our father is dead, and he is in\nheaven. And for me it was just information, I was \u2014 I knew it already, because we \u2014\nwhen we visited him last time, I knew that he will be hanged. So for me it was quite\na confirmation.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: You knew because someone told you?",
        "A: No, no. And so \u2014 and Mikey was starting to cry, and also Gitty(ph) \u2014 Brigitte\nwas starting to cry. And my mother said to them, why do you cry? Your father is\nhappy in heaven now, and look at Niki(ph), he also don\u2019t cry, and then he pressed\nmy hand and said, why are you not crying? And so, just as I \u2014 the distant. I don\u2019t\nhave a personal \u2014 I had no personal feeling, like. And by the way, I always was very\npragmatic in my life. Now I knew the next time we will see our mother, she will tell\nus that our father is dead.",
        "Q: You knew it, but no adult had told you that this would be.",
        "A: Well, in the summer of \u201946, his lawyer, Dr. Zeidel(ph) came to our family and\nsaid, Mrs. Frank, there is no chance. He will get the death penalty, for sure. The\nproofs against him are so magnificent, are so unbelievable, and he couldn\u2019t do any \u2014",
        "Q: You were \u2014 you were in earshot of this?",
        "A: It was also \u2014 it was \u2014 I knew it then. I know it was connecting with the visit of\nMr. Zeidel(ph). And everybody else, also my brother Norman, and so \u2014 so we\ntalked to each other about it. I don\u2019t know exactly the conversations any more. But I\nknew that when the invitation co \u2014 came in September, we had to go \u2014 September\n\"46, we have to go to the prison to visit our father. It was the first time after he wasJune 6, 2016\narrested, on the fourth of May in 1945. I knew that will be my last visit to see my\nfather alive.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s actually the first and the last visit \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: I know only that I knew he will get the death penalty, and it will be over. So that\nwas \u2014 I\u2014I can\u2019t repeat anything. But I know then from Norman also, which I\ntalked to him a lot during our life, that it was Zeidel\u2019s(ph) visit who ended all our\nhopes \u2014 or their hopes, not my hope \u2014 that he will survive. And by the way,\nwhenever I was already in school, and I came to school in the autumn of \u201945. And\nJune 6, 2016\nthe Nuremberg trial was broadcasted. Every evening there was one hour they\ntalked about the day. And everybody, because we knew each other, everybody in\nthe family of the other children, the parents of them, they\u2019re talking about it. Also\nHans Frank was in the prison in Nuremberg, and that\u2019s this big trial. And the\nchildren in my school sometimes said to me, one of them, that, hi Niki(ph), you\nknow now your father will be hanged. And I said yes. So, it was some \u2014 it wasn\u2019t\ncruel.

        "Q: My \u2014 my sincere apologies. My sincere apologies. How could I? How could I?\nOkay. So Tante Marta(ph) knew how to speak to the dead, yeah? And she would\nhave s\u00e9ances, and in those first months afterwards, your mother participated in\nthem. And lo and behold there were \u2014 there was communication with your father,\nyes? In these s\u00e9ances. And then your uncle passed away, and then that stopped.",
        "A: He committed suicide.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He threw himself under a train.",
        "Q: And why did he do that, by the way?",
        "A: Because of his wife. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: She was a little bit \u2014 he was crazy.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He was out of his brain, he also was running along the main street in Munich,\nKaufingerstrasse, and throwing stones into the windows. And my Aunt Marta(ph)\nwas running by, and to \u2014 to stop him as well. He was \u2014",
        "Q: So maybe he was mentally ill?",
        "A: Yes, he was, for sure.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Okay. But what I wanted to say with this, is that there is a section where you\nwrite, that when the communications with your father ceased \u2014 that is, you kept \u2014\nyou know, in the s\u00e9ance, they kept wanting to bring his spirit up, you yourself tried\nto do so. I think it was, you know, if Uncle Julius was a butterfly, then you were\nseeing, was your father here, was your father there. And it ended up with a little\ndog, that you thought maybe his spirit had rested in the little dog?",
        "A: Yes, but was \u2014 was more on the funny side, in the \u2014 in this book. This, with the \u2014\nwith the butterfly is correct. It wasn\u2019t me, but it was Tante Marta(ph) \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 she was sitting in the English garden, and suddenly Uncle Julius came along\nas a butterfly.",
        "Q: The butterfly.",
        "A: And the dog also as well, yes.",
        "Q: The reason why I bring it up is that when I read that passage, yes, I know it was\nsupposed to be humorous, but it also gave me a sense of a child who is missing his\nfather, who wonders whether his father is here, his father is there, his father is\nsomeplace else.",
        "A: Maybe.",
        "Q: Did you miss him?June 6, 2016",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know him. Hm. I\u2019m not sure. I \u2014 I would say, more I would say because\nas anormal child, you are missing your father, it could be, for sure. But it\u2019s not\nsomething which haunts me.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Or has haunted me. Could be. The good thing was in this time, that a lot of\nfamilies, they lost their father due to the war. They all were killed in the\nWehrmacht. So, it was comparable to other families who \u2014 where the children also\ngrew up without a father. The special thing on the Frank family and this, it was like\nan honor. You were special because your father got a year long trial, and\nafterwards, he wasn\u2019t shot by a Russian in the war, or by a French, or an English,\nbut he was hanged, so that was special. So \u2014",
        "Q: Prestigious, in a way?",
        "A: Ina way, prestigious. We were something special. And, don\u2019t forget, my father\nwas sitting in the first row of the defendants, not in the second one.",
        "Q: Even more special.",
        "A: My mother liked it, my mother, it\u2019s even more special.",
        "Q: I want to go back to the descriptions of the other two places. You gave us a\ndescription of Schoberhof. First, a question: why did you have the Wawel andJune 6, 2016\nKressendorf as places to live? Why was it two for the family? Or were there\ndifferent functions of each place?",
        "A: In the Wawel were a lot of \u2014 also the \u2014 the government, his prime minister and\nall this kind of stuff was always there.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Where he did all his work during the day. But on weekends, and also during the\nweekend, he could decide when he was \u2014 wants to work or not. So he was very\noften at Kressendorf.",

        "Q: Tapestries, yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 tapestries, yes. Was really good to live in, but my memory, I have no\nmemories that I slept there, but I must have slept there, because in the morning\nwhen my father was shaving himself \u2014 I don\u2019t have any memory.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: More memories, I exactly knew \u2014 to know this, Kressendorf is now a ruin. I\nknow exactly where my room was, where I slept in with Mikey together. So I was\nmore in Kressendorf, I would say, in all those years.",
        "Q: These \u2014",
        "A: And I remember, especially from the Wawel, the big festivities my father gave \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 to the German big shots.",
        "Q: So what kind of festivities were these?",
        "A: They were really with big candelabras, and really everybody in wonderful\nclothes, and we had to give everybody our hand, and hand kisses to the women.\nThis I have in \u2014 in \u2014 til in my head, because Mikey and me, we must always laugh,June 6, 2016\nand we mixed it up, we then kissed the hands of the guys, and then made our\n[bows] to the ladies, and so on. Was funny.",
        "Q: So tell us, so that now is not from the eyes of a child, but so that people will\nknow, these are not just any old places in buildings, in Polish history. Can you tell\nus what was the Wawel, what was Kressendorf, what was Bellevue?",
        "A: Wawel was \u2014 Wawel was the old capital of the Polish empire, let\u2019s say it this\nway, and a lot of Polish kings are buried inside the cathedral on the Wawel. And the\nspecial thing is, unbelievable me til nowadays, Mikey and I, we played seek-hide?",
        "Q: Hide and seek.",
        "A: Hide and seek, inside this cathedral. So we \u2014 we hided behind wonderful graves,\nand holy people, and \u2014 and lying \u2014 not down in the catacomb where the \u2014 where all\nthe Pilsudski is \u2014 had his grave. But somebody was, that they allowed us to play\nthere, hide and seek.",
        "Q: So this is sort of like the central place of Polish kings?",
        "A: It was the central place for the Polish people. And immediately, my father\nforbade, when he took over [indecipherable] immediately shut it down, no Polish\nperson could enter the cathedral, which was one of the most holy ones in \u2014 in\nPoland, besides Czestochowa.",
        "Q: Czestochowa, yeah. And Kressendorf? Did that belo \u2014\nJune 6, 2016",

        "A: Yes. Also around the Wawel.",

        "Q: Today no one would do that.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. What about Sigrid? Was she going to school there too?June 6, 2016",
        "A: She was also going to school, so she must also have gone the same way. She was\nelder, the one class ahead, one year ahead of him. And both were very happy there.",

Those sad looking guys around here,\nand also I saw children of my age looking very sad, because we always were\nlooking very happy. And my mother refused to answer. And I wouldn\u2019t have\nunderstood it, I have to say, those are Jews, and we don\u2019t like the Jews, and theJune 6, 2016\nJews are no human beings, and so \u2014 so we have to round them up in small parts of\nthe city and they \u2014 she would never have said this to me.",

        "Q: Isn\u2019t that interesting?",
        "A: That is interesting. And he said, and when this little guy started to cry so heavily,\nmy mother became more silent, comforted me, and let it go. He wasn\u2019t put into a\nconcentration camp. I saved him.",
        "Q: Well, he thought so, and that\u2019s the important part, you know. And it\u2019s also \u2014 so,\nokay, so now I get it \u2014 a picture. The \u2014 Kressendorf was heated by coal ovens.",
        "A: Not \u2014 not everywhere.",

        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and the \u2014 some of the ash went on that, and for that he was going to be sent\naway. Did you meet him after the book came out, or not?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No.June 6, 2016",
        "A: I meet one of the guys who made this liberation act, who placed some explosive\nunder the railway of my father.",
        "Q: We have to tell the whole story then, of what \u2014 this was an assassination\nattempt?",
        "A: Assassination attempt.",
        "Q: Tell us \u2014 tell us what that was. Now in a \u2014 as a grownup voice, rather than as a\nchild. What happened in this instance?",
        "A: About 20 Polish guys wanted to kill my father, and placed a bomb under the\nrailway in the woods, on the way from Krakow to Lemberg, as far as I know. But\nthe bomb exploded a little bit too early, so only the locomotive \u2014 I don\u2019t know the\nword \u2014",
        "Q: The locomotive, mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 the locomotive was out of order then, and not much more was \u2014 happened. But\nif you drive today to these woods, you can\u2019t believe it. They made a monument for\nthose 20 brave Polish gentlemen. And you are 50 meters away, what do you see in\ngolden letters? Government general Hans Frank, and very small, the 20 names of\nthe 20 fighters. I couldn\u2019t believe it, but I have seen it myself. Unbelievable.",
        "Q: So, were the 20 caught? Were they caught?June 6, 2016",
        "A: I don\u2019t know exactly. They \u2014 I think most of them have survived. Because then,\nthis one gentleman, he said he would have loved that also Niklas been sitting in this\ntrain, and the explosion would have been successful. So, both my father and me. I\nthink he meant with Niklas, all the family. And some Polish people were upset\nabout it, and I said immediately, that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s okay. He is \u2014 man was right.\nWe have killed so many innocent children. Why should he be on the other way,\nbecause only that I am young, that he don\u2019t want to have killed me. I was on his\nside, and we shaked hands and I embraced him and it was very good. And shortly\nafterwards, he was dead. I met him nearly 15 years later, after he has told this\nsentence to a newspaper, as Niklas.",
        "Q: So, you know, one of my questions, which I had anticipated would be later on,\nbut because we\u2019re on Poland, I wanted to find out what kind of reaction your book\nhad had in Poland when you came out with it, and you wrote it. How did \u2014 how \u2014 it\nwas still before solidarity had happened, but it still was not yet an independent\nPoland, and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 that might have had some influence.",
        "A: If\u2014 I was a journalist with \u2014 with \u201cTime\u201d magazine.",
        "Q: Yeah.June 6, 2016",
        "A: And at that time I was respansible \u2014 responsible for the printing in advance of \u2014\nof very good books.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, we printed \u201cSchlindler\u2019s List,\u201d in Germany first, before it came out as a\nbook.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And I was responsible, and everybody was responsible for reprinting this book,\nonly parts of it, for sure, has to write big article. So it was my first visit in Poland\nagain then. And my interpreter was a man called Jarzyc(ph) Plezniavovitch(ph).\nAnd Jarzyc(ph) was a teacher also in the University of Krak\u00e9w for German. And\nhe wanted be \u2014 we became friends. We are still nowadays. And he wanted to teach\nthe Polish students German with my book, \u201cM6j Ojciec.\u201d In ja \u2014 in \u2014 1n Polish,\n\u201cThe Father,\u201d or The Father. And the Polish students, of whom I\u2019m sure, in every\nfamily my father has killed some members, yes, they refused to learn German with\nsuch an ugly book.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Because of this foul language against the father. You can\u2019t, as I have said to\nJarzyc(ph), we don\u2019t want to learn German through a guy who hates his father, and\nwho is accusing his father in such a way. Isn\u2019t it wonderful?June 6, 2016",
        "Q: I mean, it\u2019s irony upon irony.",
        "A: My father won, even in Poland. Yeah.",
        "Q: So that was \u2014",
        "A: And the second thing \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 when came \u2014 the book came out in Polish then, and it was immediately bought,\nthe whole circulation, from the Catholic church. They also didn\u2019t want that their\nsheep should read such a book.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And what year did it come out, \u201988 then, \u201989? After the \u201987 [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, not 87, ar-around, I think \u201989 or then \u201991, or something.\nQ2: Ninety-one.",
        "A: Ninety-one, thank you.",
        "Q: In English. But in Polish \u2014\nQ2: In English, right.",

        "A: I think Polish was earlier.",
        "Q: Yeah. So the Catholic church bought up all the copies.",
        "A: I know, by chance, a German Polish journalist, which was a friend of mine, and\nhe saw it on the Wawel [indecipherable] there is, nearby is a big building on the\nWawel, where \u2014 where \u2014 for the priests. And there was on the corridor, all the \u201cMo6j\nOjciecs\u201d laying, and not as distribution that the Catholic church will hand it over to\nthe priests of the church. They took it away from the market.",
        "Q: So did it ever hit the market? Did the book ever hit \u2014",
        "A: Parts of it. Parts of it. | would say about 1,000 or 2,000 copies, or something like\nthis. They didn\u2019t know it from the beginning. Then they found out some priest must\nhave read it, and is also strong against it, and were some parts against the Catholic\nchurch, so they said we can\u2019t do this.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We have to protect the Polish people against this Niklas Frank.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s so ironic. It-It\u2019s just so ironic, because you write in the book of the\nGerman priest who complains about the Polish clergy.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: As well as, you know, the \u2014 the post-war \u2014",

I\u2019d like to bri \u2014 you know, take that\nup now, with the end of the war. You say that one of your most stark memories is\nwhen he\u2019s back at your home, near Schliersee, and you break his glasses. Do you\nhave any memories of the war ending? Do you have ever any memories of your life\nchanging, before the actual end of the war?",
        "A: We saw all those American and British bombers starting from Italy, flying over\nthe light \u2014 lake of Schliersee, to Munich, to have another bombardment of the city,\nand also to Nuremberg, and so, those big cities. And then we are looking forward\nthat the Americans came.",
        "Q: You were looking forward to this?",
        "A: Yes. Also, my mother, and also my father, the stupid guy, was looking forward\nthat the American came. There was a\u2014 some brave young Germans, who seized theJune 6, 2016\nBavarian broadcasting radio, and delivered some new program, and my father was\nstanding there listening to the radio, and saying that\u2019s it, that\u2019s what I always\nwanted to have. That now is coming. And he thought that this will be a new \u2014\nmaybe as \u2014 thought maybe it\u2019s a new career for me. And \u2014 and then the Americans\ncame, the lake of Schliersee is on \u2014 was right inside. If you look to the north,\nthere\u2019s a street, and the last SS soldiers put out something like sperre, I don\u2019t know\nthe English word.",
        "Q: Barricades.",
        "A: Barricades. These big trees. But the Americans sent in front a Caterpillar and he\nthrew away very easily. And we could see it through \u2014 from the [indecipherable].\nAnd then they came \u2014 but then, it\u2019s a day when the Americans came. My father was\nin his official office.",
        "Q: And where was that?",
        "A: Was about one kilometer \u2014 one and a half kilometers away from the\nSchoberhof, in [indecipherable] which also belongs to [indecipherable]\nSchliersee. And my mother was the last \u2014 actual, she did, as a Queen of Poland,\nshe forced the other women to bring white shirts to hang them out of the windows\nas a sign of capitulation, and no fighting.",
        "Q: When you say as the Queen of Poland, what do you mean by that?\nJune 6, 2016",

        "A: She took it seriously, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So she enjoyed it very much. And she behaved like this, as if she was a queen.\nBut then they arrested my father when \u2014 when we are not \u2014 when we are not\ntogether.",
        "Q: That is when he is in his office?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And was it right away? That is, the army comes, the U.S. Army comes to\nNeuhaus, and is it an immediate thing, or is it that they\u2019re there for some days?",
        "A: There\u2019s a \u2014 there \u2014 there was a Lieutenant Stein, a German Jew, who was lucky\nenough to flee Germany before he was brought to the concentration camp, or to\nAuschwitz, and he came back with the American army, as an American lieutenant,June 6, 2016\nor something like this. And because he was absolutely fluent in German, he was in\nthe Special Branch for arresting all the top guys. And he came from the\n[indecipherable] along the mountains, from the lake of Tegernsee. And then he\narrested Hans Frank.",

        "A: It was special task for him \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 to find Hans Frank.",
        "Q: Yeah. It wasn\u2019t something that was \u2014 they fell upon him, and they \u2014 they realize,\nor \u2014 or that the army is there for a number of days, and only then somebody comes.\nIt was a \u2014",
        "A: No, no. No, no.",
        "Q: It was immediate.",
        "A: It was completely different. He was arrested on the fourth of May, 1945, in his\noffice. And Lieutenant Stein entered the room, he was sitting with his last love\naffair, his secretary, Helena(ph) Krafcik(ph), his cook, his adjutant, Mr.\nPffafelroad(ph), and two other, a lady, another lady, and another man. AndJune 6, 2016\nLieutenant Stein entered the room and said, who of you is Hans Frank? That was \u2014\nmy father really have disappointed.",
        "Q: Insulting him.",
        "A: Because he insulted, because he was very proud. The \u201cNew York Times\u201d\npublished a list of the most wanted war criminals, and number one was Hans\nFrank. He was very proud about this. And so he had \u2014",
        "Q: You knew about it in Schliersee?",
        "A: You \u2014 you don\u2019t have \u2014 it was earlier, when he was still in the government\ngeneral, as the governor general.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then the \u201cNew York Times\u201d published it. But the thing is that one month\nago, I got an email from a lady from America. Monica was the first name.",
        "Q: This is this year, 2016?",
        "A: This year. And she wrote me that her father arrested my father. And I wrote back\nto her that that\u2019s strange, because I knew exactly it was Lieutenant Stein, but there\nwas another soldier, and a driver, in this open Jeep. And she said, maybe it was the\nother guy was my father. He\u2019s already dead. And then I urged her, please tell me,\nwhat \u2014 what was happening, what was the remembrance of your \u2014 the memory of\nyour father? And he said that when they entered this room in this \u2014 this office room,June 6, 2016\nmy father was standing with a pistol at his head, pretending that he\u2019s now killing\nhimself. And Monica\u2019s father went to this guy, to Hans Frank, said, no, no. We\nwill take care of it. Took away the pistol, and arrested him. So I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t\nhave another proof, but \u2014 but that\u2019s brand new for me, and I told it the other family\nof mine, and two of them, two nephews, sons of my brother Mikey, they thought as\nfar as they know, it could be possible. Because my father had a golden pistol, which\nwas made from the Jews in Krakow, by force. And \u2014 but I interviewed for my\nbook, this Helena(ph), the last love of my father.",
        "Q: The secretary.",
        "A: The secretary. And she told me about this golden pistol. And I asked her, Mrs.\nWinter \u2014 she was married then [indecipherable] name, family name Winter. Mrs.\nWinter, why didn\u2019t he commit suicide? And she smiled at me and said, Niklas,\ntherefore he was too much of a coward. And so I think that the new story of\nMonica\u2019s father might not fit in, in that wa \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because I think Helena would have told me.",
        "Q: Now where was Lilly? Was she out of the picture?",
        "A: No, she was still there. She was living in Pateiving(ph), which about 50\nkilometers away, and my father very often was with her.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: When he was \u2014 when he has lost his government general. And he must have seen\non the fourth of May in the morning, that a Bavarian farmer, an old guy with a\nwhite flag, rode on his horse in front of my father\u2019s office, to the Americans, and\nalso that it\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: We\u2019re surrendering.",
        "A: The [indecipherable] is surrendering.",

        "Q: Te-Tell us a little bit about this struggle. You mention it in your book, that\nHimmler had a \u2014 a representative in the government general, a kru \u2014",

        "A: Originally, my father was the chief of the civil administration.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But the civil administration also was everything, was also the police. But on the\nother hand, as every dictator does it, impera(ph) partint(ph) impera(ph). He\ndivided the responsibilities, and he gave the responsibility for the police, and for the\nSS camps and for the extermination camps to Himmler.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re talking Hitler divided, yes.June 6, 2016",
        "A: Hitler divide. He was a dictator. And my father wanted always that Himmler \u2014\nthat he was in state as a first position, as a deputy of Hitler. And also Mr.\nKruger(ph) should be his servant. And he was always keen to prove that he is in\npower of everything, also of the SS, which was \u2014 thinking in his brain was a big\nmistake, you know. Later on, during the trial, he always said it was Himmler, it\nwas only Himmler. But was rubbish. Because without the civil administration,\nhipler \u2014 him \u2014 Himmler couldn\u2019t have run the extermination camps. It was always\nwith the help of the civil administration. To get the Jews all together in th \u2014 in the\nghettos, and all this kind of stuff, it was always together with the civil\nadministration.",

        "A: He tried, together with Helena(ph) Winter, because the last one wasn\u2019t printed,\nso they could change some pages.",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t much that he was able to change.",
        "A: No. The other were really printed volumes.",
        "Q: So in other words, this is \u2014 this is proof of what he did during the time he \u2014",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: And he hands this over when he\u2019s arrested.",
        "A: Yes, voluntarily. And he told one of the psychiatrists who had access to the\nprisoners in Nuremberg, and \u2014 all my relatives, everybody urged me to destroy this\ndiary, but I wanted to show the world what I was fighting for, and so I voluntarily\nhanded it over to the Americans. And one of the \u2014 how di \u2014 attorneys \u2014 attorneys atJune 6, 2016\nNuremberg said to his secretary, there is this bloody stupid guy Hans Frank, who\nhanded over all the proofs against him. And he really was right.",
        "Q: Did you ever read any part of those diaries?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Some parts I can know by heart. For instance, when he was traveling,\nafter we invaded Soviet Union \u2014 Galicia was the capital of Lemberg, or Lviv, or\nLwow, was ki\u2014 came to the governor general, and one year after this invasion he\ncame to the city of Lemberg, addressing about 300 German administration people,\nand they had \u2014 I just came through this old Jewish nest, by the way. I didn\u2019t see\nanybody of those flat footed Indians. What have you done with them? Had you ever\n\u2014had you ever done something evil to them? And the protocol 1s writing great\nhilarity. That was \u2014",
        "Q: Can you say this to German to \u2014 in German to me? How he said it in German, if\nyou remember it?",
        "A: He said in German: [speaks German]",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So everybody knew what was going on with the Jews.",
        "Q: Okay. So he was being funny. Are there other parts of these diaries that remain\nin your memory?June 6, 2016",
        "A: Yes. Whatever happens after the war, maybe you can make mincemeat out of the\nPolish or Ukrainians, or whatever is running around here. Well-educated man my\nfather was, playing wonderfully piano, knowing Shakespeare by heart, and our\nGerman most important poet, Goethe. And he was saying sentences like this.",
        "Q: Is it through these pages that you got to know him?",
        "A: No, I knew him before, through all the documents I had. But the diary always\nwas with me.",
        "Q: And what other kinds of documents did you have, in order to \u2014",
        "A: A lot of letters he wrote. Because my mother always kept them. Also, very nice\nletters in early times of their marriage, and then very ugly ones. And the most ugly\nones is that he wanted \u2014 he really terribly wanted the divorce. And knowing what\nwas going on in his country, the mass murdering of Jews, he wrote to my mother, I\nwill go into the dark. I see mountains of corpses. Don\u2019t follow me. Please give me\nfree, and stay out of it, and give me the divorce, and [indecipherable] not written\ndown, said I can marry Lilly. So he took the Holocaust as a trick to get the divorce.\nNice guy. He gave a shit about the Jews and all the others. Like my mother. My\nmother has a lot of f-friends in the \u2014 with the Jewish agents, it\u2019s called Jtidische\nAgenten, who had all these dealings with furs, and \u2014",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking before the war.\nJune 6, 2016",
        "A: Yes, but yeah, but she met them again, and when she was entering the \u2014 the\nghetto, the Krakow ghetto, and the Warsaw ghetto, and looking for furs and other\nprecious things, she must have seen some of them again. And there\u2019s a scene which\nI wrote in my other book against my mother. There was a \u2014 a Jewish agent of hers,\nwhich \u2014 whom she had really very good business.",
        "Q: So this is a prewar rel-relationship. It started in prewar?",
        "A: Yes, yes. And \u2014 but then it was before America entered the war, all the German\nJews tried to get the visa out for the United States, and other countries. And he was\nstanding in this row, and suddenly he saw my mother walking by with two\ngirlfriends of her, and he went to her and saying, I am your old agent, Mrs.\nReichsminister. | am Flombom(ph). I terribly need a visa, could you please help\nme? And my mother answered to him, that\u2019s strange. My husband told me there are\nno difficulties. You will get your visa, I am sure of. I also got my passport for\ndiplomats. So I would say, 70 to 30, you will get your visa. See, I know of one of\nthe girlfriends who accompanied her. He didn\u2019t show up after the war, though. They\nmust have killed him, the Germans, my father. But after the war, the Schoberhof\nwas plundered.",
        "Q: Tell us about that. How did that happen?",
        "A: It was as a\u2014 in Germany you call it Zwangsarbeiter.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Forced laborers.",
        "A: Forced laborers from the Ukraine and from Russia and from Poland, especially\nfrom Poland. And now they were \u2014 suddenly they were free, and suddenly they\nwere the masters. So they entered the Schoberhof and plundered it. And my mother\ntook the three smallest children, Brigitte, Micky and me, to a neighbor of hers,\nMrs. Von Langsdorf(ph), and told her we have to \u2014 can you hide us? Because I am\nfear for the life of my children. And by the way, here is this big handbag, please\ncould you hide it as well, and I will get it back in two or three weeks, whenever\ntime goes by. And we slept on the \u2014 up there, under the roof.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, in the attic.",
        "A: And then, three weeks later, my mother ordered Mrs. Von Langsdorf(ph) to\nbring her bags back. And fortunately she was curious enough and had a look in it,\nand it was full of jewelry, and halskette, and armband \u2014",
        "Q: Necklaces, and bracelets and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and all this \u2014 necklace, all this kind of stuff. And \u2014 but she gave it, and then my\nmother, there was no Mercedes left, just her cycle, and there was a camp for\ndisplaced persons. The Jewish people who had survived were in certain areas, to\nwait for the visas. And she took two or three of this presious \u2014 precious things and\ndrove to this camp. And two of the Jews recognized her again. She \u2014 they knew herJune 6, 2016\nfrom her visits in the Krakow ghetto. And how\u2019s the Jewish humor? They\naddressed her still Frau Minister. And my mother said to them, I have this, you can\nget it. But I need flour, butter, meat, to nourish my children. And during the night\nthere come an old car with all this stuff. And they made a fortune, and we don\u2019t\nhave to starve any more. That was my mother.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: My mother, on the other hand, was, I think the only person I met in my la \u2014 life,\nwho was living strictly to reality. When the Third Reich and her luxury was over,\nshe acknowledged it immediately. It\u2019s over now. It\u2019s over. She never glorified in\nfront of me, the Third Reich, the powerful living she had. All these servants, all this\nkind of stuff. She never glorified it. Now, she was poor again, like in the beginning\nof her life, and now she had to nourish five stupid children. And she did it. She did\nit. So she died worn out in the age of 62.",
        "Q: What year?",
        "A: Fifty-nine, on my birthday. We had another interview and \u2014 this morning, where\nI answered this question for you.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, you did.",
        "A: It mustn\u2019t have been you.",
        "Q: That was the one before, rather than \u2014 we\u2019l] talk about that later.June 6, 2016",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: But I want to go back to things that you just mentioned right now, about her\nbeing in the ghettos and doing dealings. I don\u2019t think we talked about that in the\nmorning.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know much more about it. I know my \u2014 my own [indecipherable] and I\nknew by the friends, for instance by Tante Margot(ph), and all the other, said that\nvery often was in the ghettos.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Always on \u2014 and you have to imagine, the Jewish people were the last\n[indecipherable] and the last precious things. And if the wife of the governor\ngeneral shows up, they had the desperate hope that if they sell her, for a cheap price,\nmaybe she will do something that they can survive. My mother didn\u2019t do nothing\nabout it.",
        "Q: So she just took advantage of her ability to \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Now, was the Schoberhof filled with all of these types of items, of paintings, of\ngoods \u2014",
        "A: No, that was \u2014 the painting which my father stole when he left Krakow, for\ninstance Leonardo da Vinci, and two Rembrandts, and one Raphael, and a lot ofJune 6, 2016\ntapestry and jewelry from the Polish kings, and other paintings, a lot of paintings,\nand that was in his little house where also his office was.",
        "Q: So all of that was there?",
        "A: Yes. It was one of the most precious museums at that time, if you look around\nEurope. And \u2014 but this where all the wa \u2014 always \u2014 all of this was handed over to\nthe Americans. And only the Raphael is missing still nowadays. I assume that this\nRaphael is hanging in a farmer\u2019s kitchen.",
        "Q: In Germany?",
        "A: Yes, in Bavaria. Because my mother \u2014 I think my mother stole it. Because it\nwas not big, this size. And got some bread and butter and something, some\nchickens.",
        "Q: So when the \u2014 when the Schoberhof was plundered, it was \u2014 and, by the forced\nlaborers, it wasn\u2019t stuff like this that they were finding.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What were they actually taking, when they were doing their plundering?",
        "A: There were other precious things, truly also for my mother, and this kind of stuff.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was a \u2014 they found a lot of \u2014June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. So your father is arrested on May 4\", \u201945, and do you remember the\nend of the war, actually \u2014",
        "A: Well, first, as every German can tell you, youngster, then we saw the first\nNegroes. Now it\u2019s a black African American.",
        "Q: Americans.",
        "A: But \u2014 and I thought all the Americans are millionaires, and they throw down to\nus children a lot of chocolate, you know. Very nice guys, really nice guys. Very\nfriendly, very friendly. And after the plundering of the Schoberhof, the Americans\nalso put some guards around the Schoberhof.",
        "Q: Oh, did they?",
        "A: But they also drank all the wine my father has in the cellar.",
        "Q: Now, at that point, your sister, your oldest sister is 18 years old, Norman is 17\nyears old, they\u2019re already in their upper teens. What were they doing? Were they\nstill at home, were they off someplace else? Were you all together?",
        "A: Sigrid was working in a Red Cross hospital in Silesia at the time, but then she\nwas back home. But before, she wrote a very interesting letter to my mother, in a\nvery normal tone. That\u2019s correct?",
        "Q: Okay. Yeah.June 6, 2016",
        "A: Telling her, I am treating here all the wounded German soldiers, and they are all\nvery much afraid if Germany is losing the war. That was in the spring of 1945.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: Because, they say to my sister Sigrid, what we have done to the Jews, they will\nnever forgive us. So far that the Germans are telling you, nobody knew anything.\nWhen it was \u2014 Sigrid wrote it in a kind of, we know this. So it was like \u2014 and\nimagine, dear Mother, I couldn\u2019t have believed it. they say this. No. Quite normal.\nWhat we have done to the Jews, so they will kill us now.",
        "Q: When we talked before, about your father being arrested, about him being\nbrought to trial, that he\u2019s 1n the first row, why is it that you visited him only once, in\nSeptember of \u201946?",
        "A: It was prohibited that \u2014 you ti \u2014 can\u2019t visit the defendants.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And it was a time when the trial was finished, before they handed out the\nverdicts, there was suddenly the permission, that the family of the defendants, not\nknowing what the result of the trial will be for them, they could visit for once, their\nfathers.",
        "Q: Okay. What can you tell me about that visit?June 6, 2016",
        "A: That visit was the last disappointment concerning my father. I was sitting on the\nlap of my mother. He was sitting behind the window, with a small gitter, that we\ncould understand each other. And I was sitting there, and my father laughed \u2014",
        "Q: Screen, mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 and said to me, hi Niki(ph), nice to see you. Soon we will celebrate a happy\nChristmas in Schoberhof. And I said to myself, why is he lying? Why is he lying?\nHe knows that he is going to be hanged. Because I knew that.",
        "Q: Yeah, you told us earlier that there was di \u2014 it was, by then, common knowledge.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re seven years old, and you re \u2014 and you think this to yourself.",
        "A: Yeah, it was really disappointing.",
        "Q: Did he have any other words to any of the other children?",
        "A: The strange thing is that my brother Michael never told anybody what our father\ntold him. Also, not to his children. That\u2019s really strange. Now he\u2019s dead, a long time\nago. And to Norman, he was alone, without our mother, because he was grownup,\nnearly. And to Norman he said, I\u2019m \u2014 I can\u2019t leave you anything but the manuscript\nwhich I wrote in the prison. And remember always, I am a man of law, I\u2019m not a\npoet, so maybe it\u2019s not all \u2014 and then I will give you one advice. Please build up\nhere something. [speaks German]June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Bil \u2014 build up a defense.",
        "A: A defense here.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And made this [hand across throat motion]. And this \u2014 well, I struggled with\nmy brother about this command, is that wise for a life?",
        "Q: What does it mean?",
        "A: Don\u2019t talk too much. Don\u2019t talk too much. Because he was sentenced to death\nbecause of what he was talking in the first-hand. And I always say, that was an\nadvice of my father to be a coward. And my brother Norman said no, it was just to\nbe silent. And I was silent, and I said, so you was a coward, huh? As your father\nsaid to you you should be.",
        "Q: So that was \u2014 that was a point of contention between you and bra \u2014 and your\nbrother Norman.",
        "A: Yeah. And then he wrote in his last letter to my brother Norman, this is\n[indecipherable] we have to die, in this war. We will follow millions of our\nsoldiers, of our brave soldiers, who were \u2014 already has been killed in this war. And\nwhat true ar \u2014 should I do with the rest of my life, for instance? Should I be dealt in\nrevenge from immigrants, traitors? So I prefer to be dead. So the immigrants were \u2014\nwere these really, those guys like Willy Brandt, our chancellor then, who said, weJune 6, 2016\ncan\u2019t fight this dictatorship, but we don\u2019t want to do anything with it, and so they\nemigrate. So they wa \u2014 they were the brave ones, and the \u2014 the really good ones. So\nhe \u2014 he hadn't got any idea, and he never acknowledged, after a year of trial, where\nthe Americans, the English and the French, and the Russian have shown them a lot\nof documents, even a movie about Auschwitz. What kind of horrible crimes this\nbunch of criminals has committed? And then he is writing something like this. And\nhe wrote to his lawyer, Mr. Zeidel(ph), and also to our mother, please make sure\nthat the future will see the true Frank. I was never a criminal. And my mother la \u2014\nsomething is like \u2014 he never acknowledged anything.",
        "Q: And do you remember how your mother reacted to it?",
        "A: No. [indecipherable] But there was this 18\" of April in 1946, he was on the\nstand, trial. And he was asked by Mr. Zeidel(ph), his defendant \u2014 his lawyer \u2014",
        "Q: Lawyer.",
        "A: \u2014 and asked him, have you ever had something to do with the extinguishing of\nJews \u2014 extermination of Jews? And my father, after a short silence, he said yes. I\nnever ordered to build up a concentration camp, but if I now look back what we\nhave done, and my own diary is a witness against me. What we have said, what we\nhave done, I only have to acknowledge this guilt. A thousand years will pass\nwithout taking away this guilt from the German people.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Your father said this?",
        "A: Yes. Now I ask you, when I am asked from my lawyer, have you personally\nsomething to do with the extermination camps, why I suddenly distribute my guilt\non 80 million other German shoulders? And I just have finished a book from a\nGerman defense lawyer, and all the defense lawyers were sitting there, as he\nremembered, and saying, what is this Frank doing? At first he admitted his\npersonal guilt, and suddenly it\u2019s vanished about 80 million shoulders. So this was\nalso, the lead for the German people, how to react. We never acknowledged our\nguilt. We have built a lot of monuments, and we are a beautiful example for the\nother world, what we have done with our past, and how \u2014 how great we were in\nacknowledge \u2014 it\u2019s just the surface. The German people, still I am very much afraid\nof.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: They never acknowledged our crimes, never. It was just a\u2014 we have to do this\nbecause the world is looking for that the Germans have to do something. So we\nbuilt some monuments, and the German historians did a very good job. There is no\nGerman crime which was not thoroughly researched and written down. Everybody\ncan read it, but also, if you read it as a normal German, you will never acknowledge\nthis, really.\nJune 6, 2016",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Because the Germans have a lock \u2014 a lack \u2014 a lack of empathy. The Germans\ncan\u2019t put themselves in the soul, or in the situation, let\u2019s say, of a Jewish mother\nwho has two children, who is forced by German soldiers or German\n[indecipherable] police, into a cattle car, is driven through days and nights without\nany food or water, embracing the little childrens, and then thrown out of the cattle\ncar, to the ramp of Auschwitz, for instance, and then they took away the two\nchildren. They can\u2019t do this. And I am reading in schools or somewhere, I always\nsaid, have you ever tried to do this? Every German knows what really had\nhappened, what we have done. Have you ever put yourself in the situation like this?\nAnd they all went no. They don\u2019t do that, they can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s the special thing\nabout the Germans.",
        "Q: But in this, I \u2014 this takes our story away from your life, and the postwar\ndevelopment of it, but we\u2019re talking now about German society. And this is a very\ndim view of Germans, as a people. And it doesn\u2019t sound \u2014 how shall I say it? I\u2019'd\nneed \u2014 I need \u2014",
        "A: Honestly.",
        "Q: \u2014 to have more proof. I need to have more sense of how do you \u2014 how can you\nmake such an overall, arching statement that Germans have no empathy\u201d?June 6, 2016",
        "A: No, I\u2014 I live in \u2014 within my German people, I know them. Also, for instance,\nwas our chancellor, Mrs. Merkel did this open up for the refugees [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Around the world they applauded her. So that, that\u2019s a great thing. And I also\nwas suddenly proud. But now, we do have about 600 \u2014 was last year about 600\ndifferent burning downs of homes for refugees. We have beaten up people, we have\neven killings. So, you have to see the German people like a dark, a dark ball. And\non this ball, let\u2019s say we are 80 millions are this ball. Out of this 80 millions, and I\nmake it very positively, let\u2019s say are 10 million Germans who are on this dark ball.\nThey are running around. They are really, true democrats. They are really looking\nthat we stay a democracy. But this ball is still very, very ignorant, and very, very\nagainst everything was \u2014 what is hurting them in their \u2014 yeah, in their bad\nconscious, I would say.",
        "Q: Do you feel this inside yourself?",
        "A: No, Iam one \u2014I am one of the 10 millions who are \u2014 around.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s turn back. When your father said these different things to your siblings,\nand said to Norman that all I leave is maybe this manuscript, and his piece of\nadvice. Was there anything else that he said to any of the girls?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know.\nJune 6, 2016",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t talk about it.",
        "Q: All right. After you visited him, was there any discussion at home, about the\nvisit?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but there must have been.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I asked my brother Norman, but \u2014 decades later, and he said, we still had hope.\nBecause the visit was before the verdict came out.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: Which I found out very late, because in my first book I write that it was after the\nverdict came out. So you can Say it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a mistake, which makes the truth\neven stronger. I was so sure that he will be hanged, I didn\u2019t need the verdict, yes? It\nwas before the \u2014 the judge handed out the verdict. I always thought it was\nafterwards, and then I found out no.",
        "Q: It was before.",
        "A: Now I know exactly the date it wa \u2014 we were on the 17\" of September where we\nvisited him. And the verdicts came out on the first of October. The guilty and non-\nguilty was set on the 30\" of September.",
        "Q: So was \u2014 it was after your visit.June 6, 2016",
        "A: But then was a death penalty, or 20 years, or life imprisonment, came on the first\nof October.",
        "Q: Did you ever shed any tears about your father?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you ever shed any tears \u2014",
        "A: But the strange thing was when I was sitting together with Philippe Sands,\ninternational lawyer who made a film also about me. I was sitting in a cell, like the\nsame in which Hans Frank was \u2014 was sitting during the trial in Nuremberg. Not\nexactly the same measurement. But when my \u2014 when Colonel Andrews come \u2014\ncame with the \u2014 with the guards, to get him to the gallows. And the night was the\n16\" of October, 1946, they opened the door and my father was kneeling. And they\nhad to \u2014 Father O\u2019Connor accompanied Andrews and the guards. Said to him,\nFather, my mother used to give me the cross on my forehead before I went to school\nevery morning. Please do this, as well. And when I was telling this Philippe inside\nthe cell, I suddenly was very near to my father, and the first time I think I really had\nsome pity for him. Suddenly I understand that\u2019s the action of a ham actor. And\nsuddenly, in this cell, I got the idea maybe it wasn\u2019t an ham actors ar \u2014 kind of\nthing.

        "Q: Did other children of other Nazis get in touch with you after your book was\npublished?",
        "A: Yes. In a negative way.

And then he heard that I \u2014 also I will show up, and he\nimmediately canceled his appearance. And there was American author, Gerry\nPosner, who also, by the way, files closed about the killing of Kennedy. And he\nwrote a book also, about the descendants of the bigshot Nazis, and he was standingJune 6, 2016\nat my office at \u201cStern\u201d magazine, handing me over the telephone number of the\ndaughter of Hermann Goring, Edda Goring. And they said to me, Niklas, it\u2019s\nbetter if you call her first. I terribly need an interview with her for my book, it\nwould be great, you know. And I said okay, give me the number, and I dialed, and\nsaid \u2014 somebody got to the phone saying Goring. And I said hello, Mrs. Goring.\nMy name is Niklas Frank. Besides me is standing Gerry \u2014 and then she interrupted\nme, said, one moment, one moment. Are you the one who was \u2014 has written this\nunbelievable ugly book about his father? And I said yes, and bang.",
        "Q: There went the telephone.",
        "A: Was a\u2014 was [indecipherable] that. And the son of Bormann, who was a priest,\nbut later he wrote all the book about his father, is not a priest any more. And ye \u2014\nwo \u2014 has also written a book, and another journalist, Mr. Liebert(ph) interviewed\nhim, and in this interview for his book, he said he would like to \u2014 to \u2014 to get\ntogether \u2014 to come together with Niklas Frank.

        "Q: Was there \u2014 why do you think that\u2019s the case? Because you were so vociferous,\nso unrelenting about your father? Were there \u2014 and what \u2014 were there reasons that\nwere ever given to you?",
        "A: Marty Bormann, for instance, yes, he \u2014 had a lot of lessons in schools, yes?\nAnd he always used to have a picture with him, of his father. And he said to the\nauditorium, I know my father was a criminal, but I also know that he was a most\nwonderful father. And if you say this in Germany, immediately, the site of the\ncrimes which your father has committed, is gone, and in the German brains, is still\nalive, a wonderful father. What about those bloody crimes, they are gone. But the\nwonderful father. This Peter Sichrovsky you mentioned before, he is Jewish. He\nwas personally saved by an SS officer, out of a cattle car, as far as I know, yes. He\nwas blue eyed and blonde hair, yes? And I told it, in a big auditorium, only once,\nthat there also was an SS man who, for instance, saved a Jewish boy, was looking\nlike an Aryan boy, blue eyes, blonde hair. And you can see it, as well, about 300\npeople in this, they all leaned back, very happy suddenly. We haven\u2019t done anything\nbad, we have saved the little boy. So the complete crimes, were gone. So I will \u2014\nI\u2019ve never done this again.",

Therefore, he\nbecame an alcoholic, and my brother was drinking milk. If you don\u2019t acknowledge\nthe truth \u2014 I tell you how my mother was. When the death \u2014 when the sentences\nwere delivered from the judges, it was broadcasted lively, yes?

        "Q: So, how come her children didn\u2019t? I mean, a mother can influence a \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a big taboo around the world. You should honor your parents, and\nlove them, whatever they have done.",

So you have \u2014 they have the bigger \u2014 the bigger struggle, if\nthey would have succeeded. Their struggling would have been much stronger than\nmine. I couldn\u2019t stand this guy, but they really have loved him. He was very funny,\nmy father, he was very funny. He was very Bavarian style, and if he was at home,\nand he was in good mood.

        "Q: Pll try. Nevertheless, you explore, you put to the public, your \u2014 in German it\u2019s\n[speaks German] but your thoughts, your questions, your accusations, your\ncritique, your \u2014",
        "A: No, that was \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 whatever it is, you put that through the, you know, in your relationship with\nyour father first, then with your mother, and then with Norman.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And one \u2014 in one of the reviews it\u2019s sort of like you \u2014 you say that, okay, I\u2019ve\nundressed us for the world to see. Someth \u2014 that\u2019s a paraphrase, but that\u2019s\nsomething of what it\u2019s like.",
        "A: Yes, because what always disturbed me very much, that is the silence in\nGermany. This not acknowledging what we have done. We shouldn\u2019t go around\nwith a doggish eyes, always feeling ashamed. Life is much too strong, live your life.\nBut acknowledge it like [indecipherable] football. Acknowledge what we have\ndone. We are not personally responsible, but by chance, we are Germans. So you\nhave to \u2014 and if you acknowledge this, then will happen the second thing. You\nbecome very, very infuriated whenever you hear again something about the crimes\nwe have committed, yes? Like I told you before, looking at children \u2014 faces of\nJewish children who were forced to go to stay, th-there\u2019s a \u2014 every German, becauseJune 6, 2016\nof our sc-school system, they learn a lot about the Holocaust, so every German has\npictures in his mind. So that\u2019s the second thing, you don\u2019t \u2014 will be ashamed, but \u2014\nand that would be also, wrong way, but bef \u2014 become furious, and get a little bit\nmore civil courage. The more you know about the cowardice of your parents and\ngrandparents, the more you will find out what I found out, a thousand times with\nmyself. Ah, Niki(ph), now you are becoming a coward. Don\u2019t do this like your\nfather. Be strong. And it\u2019s not committing a crime, it\u2019s just a day in the \u201cStern\u201d\nmagazine, and all this kind of stuff. You can get yourself more \u2014 yeah, more civil\ncourage, and staying as a \u2014 as a democrat.",
        "Q: What do you \u2014 what do you hope, or what do you think the contribution of\nmaking your life and your relation to mother, to father, to \u2014 to Norman, public in\nthe books, what do you hope that it gives to the audiences, to the public?",
        "A: To do it themselves, in their own family. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the only reason why I\ndid it. We have to talk about it. We have to talk inside the families. I always\nrecommend it when I am finished with my \u2014 I always read out of the books, and\nthen we have always a very lively discussion. And then I am always telling them,\nlook at your home, look at \u2014 ask your grandparents, and \u2014 if they are still alive, ask\nthem, what\u2019s really \u2014 what have you experienced, what were you \u2014 and \u2014 and if they\nare strong, they will say to you, my dear grandchild, I was such a coward. I knewJune 6, 2016\nexactly that mine Jewish neighbors were thrown away, and I have to confess, I took\na big, big wonderful painting out of this Jewish family. If this is, that would be\ngreat. And I have to acknowledge, I have a lot of letters, mails, personal calls,\nwhich say, the first time I started to look in the history of my family.",
        "Q: That was my next question, yeah.",
        "A: And I found out is that \u2014 is for me, really satisfying. Last time was \u2014 my wife,\nshe 1s not very keen to have telephone calls. And there was a man who was 65 years\nold. And I \u2014 he asked me three months before, gave me a call. Niklas Frank is a\nvery rare name, he-he found me in the telephone book, and told me, I am so\ndesperate. I know my father was this and that, but I can\u2019t find anything. He was re \u2014\nreally a simple man, I have to admit. And I told him what he has to do, writing to\nthis archive, and this archive, always giving the exact dates of his father, and so on.\nAnd then he did it, and unfortunately my wife was on the phone, I was abroad, and\nhe was so crazy to thank me, and that it was so wonderful. It\u2019s the first time I found\nout what this guy had done. It wasn\u2019t so \u2014 so really famous. But, he was so happy.\nThat was a \u2014 if I get this, it\u2019s really good.",
        "Q: So to me it sounds like that\u2019s \u2014 you have gotten support.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: You have gotten people who have said, thank you for doing it.June 6, 2016",
        "A: But never forget this ball, that\u2019s always there \u2014 up there \u2014 they are \u2014 there\u2019s one\nwho\u2019s asking, oh Niklas is not bad, that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: But one could say that about almost any people. One could say that about almost\nany \u2014",
        "A: Now, I think I will finish this interview, because you can win everything, if you\ncompare it with the world.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No, be serious.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: If you compare it with the world, you have nothing in the end. You can just say,\nevery human being has an ugly face in it. It is saying nothing. If you are talking\nabout my life \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 and about the jailed Germans, then I am the biggest chauvinist you can\nimagine. It\u2019s only the German crimes, because we have done the worst thing in the\nworld, and we should know better. If you don\u2019t have civil courage, we will do it\nagain. And if you look now to Germany, with the refugee problems, we are only a\ngood [indecipherable] democracy. We have never proved since \u201945, after we lost\nthe war, that we are really a democracy, that we have really a civil courage. That isJune 6, 2016\n\u2014I don\u2019t want to hear nothing, not even about Austria, or France, or Greece, or\nPoland, or \u2014 or here, the republicans and the democrats, or the thousand mer \u2014\nthousand American dictatorships. It doesn\u2019t interest me. I am a German, and I want\nto make sure that the Germans, we are like the Jews, we are a chosen people. Not\nthrough God, through our crimes. And we should know exactly how \u2014 how far it\ncan lead if you don\u2019t have civil courage. It leads my father to the gallows, and it\nleads a million of innocent people into the death. So never mention this again, that\nother people also have done this. Bad.",
        "Q: I think you\u2019re right. I think this \u2014 I think this is the conclusion of our interview.",
        "A: Thank you. See ya.",
        "Q: And I \u2014 wait, no, no, please. We still have to do it officially. But thank you very\nmuch for that. And thank you very much for the rest of the interview, and sharing\nyour thoughts with us, and sharing much more.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: Do you have any other things you would like to say?",
        "A: Oh, I \u2014 a lot of questions which weren\u2019t asked.",
        "Q: Oh boy.",
        "A: No, no, [indecipherable] you were really great.",
        "Q: But truly, is there any final word?June 6, 2016",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That was a final word. It makes me always crazy. Sorry for my \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: \u2014 attacking you, but \u2014 but this I \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: \u2014 alway \u2014 it\u2019s always \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s two questions, I s \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u20141if I have a public discussion.",
        "Q: Presentation, yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: Presentation, discussion. The first is always, they are asking me, now you have\nwritten three books about your family, do you feel free now? All this stupid thing,\nand I always say, are you a German? You are a German. How did you deal with\nyour parents, your grandparents? There may be love, big [indecipherable]. But\nwhat have they done? Have you ever looked at it? How do you feel? You have the\npictures and \u2014 in your brain with \u2014 with the killed people. How do you react? Why I\nam example for you? Everybody has to do this. That would be good.",
        "Q: And the second is is this sort of evening out, by saying everybody, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Haven\u2019t you seen that in Greece? And haven\u2019t you seen the Americans in \u2014 in \u2014\nin [indecipherable], the crimes. And then the atom bombs of \u2014",
        "Q: Nagasaki, Hiroshima, yeah.",
        "A: Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And the Russians with the gulags. And the German\nguilt \u2014",
        "Q: It floats away.",
        "A: \u2014 diminishing, diminishing, diminishing.",
        "Q: It \u2014 that was not necessarily my sense in \u2014 in \u2014 1n making a comparison, as much\nas saying, isn\u2019t this part of our human condition?",
        "A: I don\u2019t be interested in the human condition.",
        "Q: Ah. Okay.",
        "A: If |\u20141if I go on this platform, we can talk three more days, and it\u2019s just rubbish.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because you don\u2019t have really something.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I know my German people. In the end of my presentation, I used to say, I love\nGermany, | really love Germany, but I don\u2019t trust you, the Germans. And they\nwould say [intakes breath]\n115June 6, 2016",
        "Q: So, thank you.",
        "A: Again, I ruined your microphone.",
        "Q: No, no. But what I will do now is officially end \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 and say, thank you Mr. Frank \u2014",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome.",
        "Q: \u2014 thank you Mr. Niklas Frank.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome.",
        "Q: And with this, this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with \u2014 wi\u2014 with Mr. Niklas Frank, on June 6\", 2016, in Washington,\nD.C. Fin and done.\nEnd of Part OneJune 6, 2016\nBeginning Part Two",
        "Q: This is Leslie Swift, recording a segment of an interview with Niklas Frank, on\nJune 6\"\", 2016, and we will be focusing right now on \u2014 mostly on Niklas\u2019s book,\nand what he talks about, his father and his family, in the book. So Niklas, wa \u2014 we\nspend a lot of time studying here at the museum, what leads people to other-ise\nJews and \u2014 and other \u2014 other people, and \u2014 to the point where they are no longer\nhuman, and thus disposable. Can you trace for us, to the best of your understanding,\nthis person \u2014 the personal journey that led your father from being someone who was\ntrained in the law, and presumably respected it, to the acceptance, and even\nenthusiastic participation in mass murder?",
        "A: I think \u2014 I know my father wasn\u2019t an anti-Semitic. And he wanted to have a\ncareer. And if Hitler would have chosen not the Jews, but let\u2019s say the Italians, or\nthe Gypsies, or \u2014 Gypsies had had already chosen \u2014 or let\u2019s say the Swedish people,\nhe would have said the same sentences against them. It was just that he wanted to\nbe near to Hitler, and he wanted to have a good career.",
        "Q: So he didn\u2019t have this underlying anti-Jewish feeling that some of the other true\nbelievers did.\n117June 6, 2016",
        "A: No. [have his youth diary. He wrote it \u2014 it\u2019s not very thick \u2014 he wrote it in the\ntime when he was 17 til the 20\" year of his life. And there was not a single remark\nagainst the Jews. And it was already after the first World War. So when Germany\nreally was on the button, and big inflation and took away some parts of Germany,\nand all this kind of stuff, he only complained about the French, and not about the\nJews.",
        "Q: About the occupation of the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, not \u2014 not only the occupation, I think something like they took away our\ngirls, the French.",
        "Q: And, at several points in the book, you insert brackets that serve as pleas to your\nfather to choose another course, one that would have him stand up to Hitler, and\nprevent him from becoming the man that he eventually became. Do you think that\nhe \u2014 why do you think he didn\u2019t take this path? Was it cowardice, or a combination\nof things? What \u2014 what about Hitler was so attractive to him?",
        "Q: You have to remember the situation in Germany. Before the first World War,\nGermany was really a leading nation, in industrialization. We got the most Nobel\nprizes. The American students, for instance, came, studying medicine, to Germany.\nWe really was a brilliant country. And suddenly, everything was gone, everything\nwas gone. And it was, for sure, the Treaty of Versailles after the war, which madeJune 6, 2016\nHitler possible. My father wrote in his youngster\u2019s diary, Germany needs his\nhonor back. We need a strong person, who can fulfill this task. Maybe it\u2019s me. But\nthen it was Hitler. So, the middle class in Germany, and I would say most of the\npeople, were really looking for becoming a nation again, full of honor. This was the\none side. And the other side was really the economical situation, which was very\nbad. And there was about 10 million unemployed people, growing, and we had the\ninflation. And then suddenly there were the people in the brown dress, marching in\ngood rows [indecipherable] in German, the word, yes. And they had the special\nprogram, not looking to the right, and to the left, just we have our program, and\nhitting everybody who was against it. For instance, the communists, yes. So this\nwas it \u2014 something which a lot of people attracted, in Germany. And Hitler was a\nbrilliant speaker. He was really very good. He wouldn\u2019t have succeeded if at this\ntime was already TV, for instance. It was his personal appearance, and this very,\nvery strong speeches he delivered everywhere. And when he came to power, he\nreally managed that the unemployment was nearly gone. And there was a big, big\nimprovement in Germany. There\u2019s a very famous German-Jewish historian,\nSebastian Haffner, he is dead since many years. He wrote a book about Hitler, and\nhe wrote in it, if Hitler would have died through a traffic accident in 1938, he\nwould be remembered as a great, great statesman, because he brought back Austria,June 6, 2016\nand it was a\u2014 a\u2014 now really in a good employment sitting. People, German people,\nwere satisfied. And on the other hand was this really, I would say tilt to\nhomosexuality, this relation from my father to Hitler. It was really, really, really\npersonal.",
        "Q: And so, you mentioned before that y \u2014 you don\u2019t think your father was a true\nanti-Semite, the way that many of the \u2014 the original Nazis were, and it was more a\ncase of expediency than anything else. And \u2014 and I just wondered, does that \u2014 does\nthat make him better, or worse, in your eyes? That \u2014 that he didn\u2019t have a belief, but\njust sort of went along with the tide?",
        "A: It didn\u2019t change anything. If you are an ardent believer, an ardent anti-Semite,\nyou also have your 10 commandments in your head. You don\u2019t have to kill innocent\npeople. And if you are \u20141f you are only somebody who wants to make a career, it\u2019s\nthe same. For \u2014 for me it wouldn\u2019t have changed anything.",
        "Q: Okay. And in the book I noticed that God comes up a lot. And what \u2014 what\nusefulness do you believe God served for your father? Do you think he was a true\nbeliever in any sense, even at the end? And do you have any personal memories of\nhim speaking about God, before 1945?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t have personal memories, but if you count how often all the speeches\nof top Nazis, starting with Hitler, going down til \u2014 til my father, how oft themJune 6, 2016\nmention God. You would say that was the most religious part you ever worked in\nGermany. It\u2019s always the same old trick. What you are doing, you have to \u2014 always\nhave to go out in your sentences. No.",
        "Q: Yeah. And \u2014 and so, from what I\u2019ve read on the subject, God and Nazism, the\nconcept of God and Nazism was really cynical and prac \u2014 and sort of a cynical in a\npractical purpose. But God was not allowed to really supersede Hitler. And I\u2019m just\nwondering what are \u2014 what are your own conceptions of God, if you feel okay\ntalking about that. I mean, do you \u2014 are you a believer? Do you have any notion of\nthat, or \u2014 you know, it \u2014 unless that\u2019s too personal.",
        "A: Starting with my father, when my father was in prison, he used to write a lot of\nletters back home. They always were read aloud from my mother, and I really was\nfull of contempt for those letters, because there was so much \u2014 so often mentioned\nGod. And as a child especially, you immediately feel that\u2019s all a lie, that\u2019s not really\ntrue. And my brother Norman said, when Hitler was dead, he was looking for\nanother guide, and he found it in God. And myself, I was brought up very \u2014 in a\nvery Catholic way, because Schliersee, especially upper Bavaria was, at this time,\nvery Catholic. And I had my big struggle with God, because as a Catholic, you\nalways have those confessions, and when it came to the sixth commandment, it was\nreally horrible for everybody, I would say. Especially for boys. And I loved \u2014 I\n121\nJune 6, 2016\nnever really believed in God. I never really. And in the meantime, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 there\nis a\u2014a very offending word in German. It\u2019s Kasperldiada(ph), I don\u2019t know the\nAmerican version. Yeah Kasperle(ph) is \u2014 is funny figure in \u2014 on the strings,\npuppet on the strings, for children.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. And Kasperle(ph) was a name of a little, with a big nose, who was always\nvery funny. And this Kasperlediada(ph) is something like a [indecipherable] for\nthis kind of stuff. I don\u2019t believe in \u2014 in \u2014 in any religions. For me it\u2019s an \u2014 it\u2019s\ninventions. Maybe human beings have always this \u2014 they wanted to have a\nconnection to the other world. I don\u2019t believe in another world. Til \u2014 to the\n[indecipherable] of my soul.",
        "Q: Well, I\u2019m right there with you, so \u2014 just a little editorializing. So, when your\nbook came out, Ina got into a little bit about th-th \u2014 the reception of it, and the \u2014\nwhat people \u2014 some people were shocked, and \u2014 and that kind of thing. Were you\nsurprised by the \u2014 by the reaction, and did you lose any friends, or did \u2014 did \u2014 did\nyour relations with \u2014 with other people that you knew change when the book came\nout?",
        "A: I was very much surprised. I was especially surprised about my fellow\njournalists, because I thought everybody of the journalist know exactly why I have\n122June 6, 2016\nwritten this book, because it was against [indecipherable] in Germany. But, they\nalso only part of the German people, so they accused me the same. The friendships\ndidn\u2019t change. No, they didn\u2019t change. But, what never came out up til now, there\u2019s\nnobody is really in private, asking me questions about this. Never. Til nowadays.\nThey know it\u2019s something like \u2014 there is something ugly with Niklas. Don\u2019t touch\nit. It\u2019s more this way.",
        "Q: You mean, asking you questions about th-the details, or \u2014",
        "A: The book, about the book, about the details about comparing themselves and\ntheir parents, and so it never came out also with my friends.",
        "Q: And was that an ex \u2014 so you \u2014 that was an explicit motivation for you to write\nthe book, was it because \u2014",
        "A: No, not against my friends, and so. It was the silence.",
        "Q: No, but to \u2014 the silence in Germany, that \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014",
        "A: It was the only reason.",
        "Q: \u2014 you \u2014 you wanted to \u2014 you wanted to break that, and break it in very shocking\nway, In a very \u2014",
        "A: Not shocking. I didn\u2019t know that\u2019s really shocking. I was very honest when I\nwrote this. So, if you are furious, your language isn\u2019t the best one. So I kept it. The\npublishing company tried to change it.\n123\nJune 6, 2016",
        "Q: Did they? Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I said, no, not a word. If you don\u2019t want to print it, maybe I find another\npublisher, but I will change nothing. And they \u2014 they didn\u2019t change it, in the end.",
        "Q: Okay. And was it a bestseller?",
        "A: In the whole, I would say there\u2019s two pocket editions, and about 55,000.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you receive any correspondence or fan mail that was \u2014 was really\nthankful, for you to have done this?",
        "A: Yes. There was \u2014 but was only rare in comparison to the accusation I got from\nthe people.",
        "Q: So, one of the things I really liked about the book was your use of black humor.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: [\u2014I-I really -I -I \u2014I \u2014I myself have a very difficult relationship with my\nfamily, and that\u2019s one way I get through it is to \u2014 to be funny about it, you know.\nBut one of my favorite things that you said was that you referred to ha \u2014 Hans\nFrank as Rosemary\u2019s baby, which I thought was \u2014 was great. But, can you just\nspeak a little bit about that, about how that helps you cope, how being able to be\nfunny, while at the same time talking about this really horrible subject matter.\nWhat\u2019s \u2014 what\u2019s your thinking behind that?\n124June 6, 2016",
        "A: I-I only can repeat, I wanted to be really honest, and I don\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t want to\nmake any how [indecipherable] compromise. I didn\u2019t want to make any\ncompromise. But \u2014 but if you look at our history, you can\u2019t come up with any\ncompromise. So, this I wanted to write, that we have to acknowledge what our\npeople have done.",
        "Q: And I ha \u2014I have to say that on \u2014 one thing that struck me also, about that use of\nblack humor was it \u2014 that because we work at the Holocaust Museum, and we deal\nwith this material every day, this horrible material, we also use that as a coping\nmechanism, so I sort of recognize that in the book as well. But it \u2014 here comes a non\nsequitur \u2014 so I was reading, and \u2014 and your father at one point early on, worked for\nthe film workers\u2019 union?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what \u2014 what \u2014 what exactly was that?",
        "A: There was a union, it was very short. I found it in one of the document. I\ncouldn\u2019t find any more about this profession.",
        "Q: But \u2014 but, like \u2014",
        "A: I think it was just to \u2014 to get mo \u2014 more money.",
        "Q: Working for \u2014 for people who work for ufa(ph) or something.\n125June 6, 2016",
        "A: Yes, everybody wor \u2014he was based in Munich, we had [indecipherable] it was\nall the big movie city, besides Berlin.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And maybe \u2014 but it was very short time.",
        "Q: And then \u2014 and while you were talking to Ina, you \u2014 you mentioned that your \u2014\nyour father\u2019s mother lived in Poland some of the time, is that right? She lived with\nyou?",
        "A: Yes. He wasn\u2019t quite a happy guy, my father, when he was young. His mother\nleft him, went with his little sister, to a new lover, to Prague. So he lived with his\nfather alone. And when my father became famous and rich, his mother suddenly\nshowed up again.",
        "Q: And did she, that you recall, have any opinions, feelings about th-the situation in\nPoland, either ger \u2014 you know, sort of writ large Germany\u2019s actions in Poland, or\nspecifics of what was happening to the Polish people, and \u2014 and to the Jew? Was \u2014\nwas there any kind of sense of that?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t know anything special, but I know that she \u2014 a lot of letters I have of\nhers to his son in \u2014 in prison, and he alw \u2014 she always defended him, as innocent.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And he \u2014 by the way, he hated my mother, and he was full on the side of Lilly.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Oh, okay. Okay. And then at one point you said you \u2014 when you were talking to\nIna, you said that your mother was very practical and pragmatic. She sort of really\nsaw things the way they were. But then, in the book, you say \u2014 it\u2019s just sort of one\nline where you say, your mother thought that unconditional surrender was wrong,\nwhen it came right down to it, she \u2014 I guess sh \u2014 did she think that there was some\nway of preserving Germany in \u2014 in some way, or \u2014",
        "A: Not in a political way.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My mother never was a member of the party, and when the power of the Frank\nfamily was at the highest point, she said to my father, and the other siblings were\naround, and she said, I know exactly. I will \u2014 it will come the time where I will\nnourish my children with my typewriter machine again. So she \u2014 and on the other\nhand it\u2019s clear, if you were \u2014 had a luxury life, and suddenly you would like to have\nto go it \u2014 let 1t go on now. So she tried, but was never \u2014 she was politically not\ninterested. She hated the screaming speeches of my father, and she didn\u2019t like\nsoldiers, all this kind of uniforms, no, she didn\u2019t like.",
        "Q: Mm. Okay. And \u2014 so tha \u2014 at one point you also write you mother has a\nhandwriting analysis done for your father?",
        "A: Yeah.\n127\nJune 6, 2016",
        "Q: And \u2014 and do you know why she did that?",
        "A: The family of Franks, and \u2014 no, not Franks, it was more Herbst, as she born\ninto the family of Herbst. And they were always having this kind of s\u00e9ances, and\nwith the cards.",
        "Q: Okay, so it was kind of a mystical \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: We grew up with it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I loved it very much, was very good.",
        "Q: Okay. And so now, to get to the film that you\u2019re donating. You\u2019ve probably seen\nit many times by now.",
        "A: No. I refused [indecipherable] always",
        "Q: You refuse \u2014",
        "A: But I\u2019ve \u2014 twice I must have seen it.",
        "Q: You \u2014 twice you\u2019ve seen it, okay.",
        "A: I can\u2019t stand myself.",
        "Q: Okay, yeah. And so \u2014 so Erika(ph) Noble(ph) sent \u2014 sent this footage to you \u2014",
        "A: Ah, this film.\n128June 6, 2016",
        "Q: That film, that film.",
        "A: I thought you \u2014 you were \u2014 oh, sorry, no.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Erika(ph) always answers to me, yes. Sorry.",
        "Q: Yeah, so \u2014 so I'll just go over quickly, the \u2014 the history of that, so that we have\nthat on the record. We found out about this from Erika(ph) Noble(ph), whose uncle\nwas friendly with your father at Nuremberg, right? Was he an interpreter, or \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what was the story on that?",
        "A: It was Lieutenant Stein. He was a \u2014 who arrested \u2014",
        "Q: It \u2014 okay, th-the gu \u2014 the man you were talking about, right? So s \u2014 so, do you\nknow how \u2014 how it ended up with him? Did he take it from \u2014 from your father?",
        "A: My mother was very clever. She immediately became friends with Lieutenant\nStein(ph). So my mother gave him the diary, the used diary of my father. The\noriginal has vanished, and on every page of the reprint is printed, copyright\nLieutenant Stein, Walter Stein, which not is so really honest, I would say. He also\ntook away the leather coat of my father, which I bought back from an aunt of\nErika(ph) Noble(ph) for 500 dollars.",
        "Q: Okay.June 6, 2016",
        "A: And it\u2019s now [indecipherable] at the lake, which we have at our house.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: And I am enjoying it every day when I look at the coat of my father hanging as a\n[indecipherable] Five hundred dollars, the most expensive [indecipherable] you\ncan imagine.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And so they met, Lieutenant Stein, he arrested him and sent \u2014 he must have been\nvery often together with my mother.",
        "Q: Okay. So he got it from your mother.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And he wasn\u2019t the interpreter.",
        "Q: Okay. Was there any suggestion of any romantic \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no, he was \u2014 no, no, no.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: And so \u2014 so the way we found out about it was we got an email \u2014 I got an email\nout of the blue, from Erika(ph) saying I have this footage, maybe you\u2019re interested,\nand we jumped all over it, because it was just amazing. And then, by the time we\n130June 6, 2016\nsort of were trying to make arrangements for her to send it to us, she had sent it to\nyou, because she felt \u2014 and that \u2014 this makes sense \u2014",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: \u2014 that it belonged to you, because you were the \u2014 the heir, you know. And then\nwe were so upset, because we wanted it, and \u2014 but understood, you know, where\nshe was coming from. And then, you know, many years later now, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re\nmaking this happen. But \u2014 but I st \u2014 I d \u2014I hadn't quite gotten the story of \u2014 of how\nit got from here to there to here, you know, so \u2014 so it\u2019s good to have it on record, I\nthink. And then, to continue though, to talk about the film, which we\u2019ll watch\ntomorrow, so we can talk about it together, but the d \u2014 do you th \u2014 ha \u2014 did the film\n\u2014has the film when you\u2019ve seen it, has it awakened any sympathy, or \u2014 or more\nanger, or any other kinds of emotions, or in any way changed your viewpoint on\nyour \u2014 about your family, seeing them in these intimate situations?",
        "A: No, it hasn\u2019t changed anything.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I was very glad to see my brother Norman with his carriage with the horses,\nthat\u2019s nice. And the other pictures when they\u2019re sitting in front of Kressendorf, and\nso they are always thinking they \u2014 Norman didn\u2019t know exactly, but the grownups,June 6, 2016\nthey \u2014 everybody knew what\u2019s \u2014 really what\u2019s going on, and they are sitting there in\nthe sun. That always gave me \u2014 well, it infuriates me.",
        "Q: Infuri \u2014 so it actually made \u2014 made it worse, in a way, to see this.",
        "A: As in \u20141n the beginning of this film, there 1s this \u2014 my father 1s sitting in the\nWawel, and the adjutant is kem \u2014 coming to him, he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s ah, he\u2019s pretending to\nbe a rocking \u2014 hard looking and signing something. Ooh, terrible.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. And do you think that the book would have been any different, if\nyou had had the film to refer to? Do you think you would have added details from\nthe \u2014 from the film, or anything like that? No. Let\u2019s see. So I \u2014I find the film\npersonally, especially interesting for a lot of reasons, not least because I\u2019ve now\nspent a lot of time studying the concept of amateur film, home movies, and things\nlike that, and what it can tell us, especially how it can contradict, and complement\nthe official records, such as, you know, newsreels, propaganda pieces, Nuremberg\nfootage; all of these places where your father appears in official capacities. And yet\nhere he is in this amateur film \u2014 not that he\u2019s more authentic there, but that it\u2019s a\ndifferent view.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And so you can put those two pieces together, and get a bigger picture. And, di-\ndi \u2014 I already asked you this question, an-and the answer is no, but \u2014 but to see these\n132June 6, 2016\ntwo pieces together, does that complicate your \u2014 your view of your family life at\nall?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No. I found it really interesting, this material, that I have the \u2014 especially the\nscenes with the Jews.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, that is \u2014 that\u2019s incredible.",
        "A: And there is one scene where \u2014",
        "Q: We have nothing like that. Do you remember any \u2014 were you on that trip, do you\nremember that at all? No, no. So, let\u2019s see ... I think some of these questions have\nalready been asked. So I \u2014 0-okay, so were there specific turning points for you, that\nyou can remember, as your opinion of your father developed over time, or \u2014 and\nwas the process, in coming to terms with your mother and your brother and your\nother siblings, a \u2014 a different process, bec \u2014 per-perhaps because they were still\nalive, and he was dead?",
        "A: Well, we start becoming older, we started to talk about it a lot. Whenever we\nmet, we talked about our father, and all the \u2014 more about our father, and also about\nour mother. It \u2014 it was a \u2014 what it meant, which I would say it led to \u2014 to nothing.\nWe repeated each other. I have more and more new documents, but \u2014 but we wereJune 6, 2016\nstill friendly, and we were really in a good mood. And I never accused them, saying\nyou have to change if you \u2014 and come on, and \u2014",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t trying to convince them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. It seems that \u2014",
        "A: And for me it\u2019s not they have to \u2014 my siblings I have to compare with the normal\nsurroundings I had with other people.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Nobody is really \u2014 really talking about it, and really saying something, the same\nas my siblings.",
        "Q: Right, right. And so some of the scenes in the book could be considered \u2014 I\nmean, obscene is a word that\u2019s \u2014 that has judgment attached to it, which I d \u2014I don\u2019t\nmean to imply, but there are scenes that are \u2014 that could be called obscene, and I\u2019m\njust wondering what are \u2014 what are you trying to say to your father with that, with \u2014\nwith those scenes? Are \u2014 are you trying to vent anger at him, are you trying to say \u2014",
        "A: Not trying, I really was angry.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And if you are angry about one, you are losing your \u2014 your education.",
        "Q: Right, right.June 6, 2016",
        "A: And I was \u2014 I will never forget it, when I wrote this, I was really happy that I\nreally can fight him, that I really can excuse \u2014 accuse him, and that I really can\ncounter him with very bad words.",
        "Q: And in terms of the \u2014 and I hope you don\u2019t mind me asking this, but in terms of\nthe se \u2014 scene of the masturbation, in the \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s cut out in the American edition.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: Oh, for sure.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Oh!",
        "Q: How do I know about it then? Do I read \u2014 I didn\u2019t read about it in the German\nversion.",
        "A: In the American version is \u2014 everything cut out is famous, notorious\nmasturbation scene. It\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: The only sentence is, I even got physical pleasure. That\u2019s the only thing which\nwas left.",
        "Q: Oh, okay, well I mean, maybe I read that as masturbation. But \u2014June 6, 2016",
        "A: That\u2019s a big scene with \u2014 a big scene, because it\u2019s \u2014 they had to cut out about\nfour mentions of this.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting. But anyway, my point was \u2014",
        "A: The \u2014 the guy in the \u2014 Jonathan Segal, American you \u2014 he was \u2014",
        "Q: Who?",
        "A: \u2014 the publishing \u2014 Knopf, here in New York.",
        "Q: Oh okay \u2014 okay.",
        "A: And he was so rat faced when I told him, I want to have it.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And he said, well Niklas, I know the American markets, they won\u2019t buy it, I\ndon\u2019t have to print it.",
        "Q: Oh my God, we\u2019re such prudes, aren\u2019t we? But \u2014 but li \u2014 can I just tell you my\nreading of that scene, and you will tell me how wrong I am, or if I\u2019m \u2014 you know,\ntell me a different story. My reading of that scene is that you are doing that, because\nyou\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re trying to reach the ultimate point of joy and\npleasure at your fa \u2014 that your father is dead.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. Okay, tell me.",
        "A: Exactly the other way around.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You have to imagine that the nearer the 16\" of October came, yes, when I was a\nchild, the more \u2014 not of my mother, but of my siblings, and the relatives, was the\nurge to celebrate. To celebrate a man and the innocentess of a man which I, even\nthen, despised, yes, without really knowing what he has done, when I was young.\nNine, eight, 10, 11 years old. And this is a big pleasure on a little soul like mine,\nwhen you are young. And it was just a relief, it was just a relief.",
        "Q: A relief, okay, okay, okay, interesting. So, it seems that it\u2019s clear that your father\nconstantly craved Hitler\u2019s approval, and was always disappointed because Hitler\ndidn\u2019t really have much respect for him, if any at all. And \u2014 and that reads to me, at\nleast, as a father-son relationship, the \u2014 the f \u2014 the father constantly disappointing\nthe son. And I \u2014 I wonder if that is \u2014 is a theme in the book in the sense that, you\nknow, this relationships between fathers and sons, is there a parallel there? Because\nyou \u2014 you rid \u2014 you were rejected by your father, and then you rejected your father.\nBut, your f\u2014 your \u2014 your father never rejected Hitler til the \u2014 til the end. And I-I\u2019m\njust wondering if you see any parallel there, 1f you see any cause \u2014 cause the whole\nbook seems to be about fathers and sons. Mostly about your relationship with your\n\u2014 with your father, but there\u2019s also \u2014 I kept thinking, there\u2019s this \u2014 there\u2019s some kind\nof filial relation between Hitler and \u2014 and Hans Frank that\u2019s not being fulfilled,\n137June 6, 2016\nthe way Hans Frank wants it to be fulfilled. So that\u2019s not really a question, it\u2019s just\nsort of an observation, and a \u2014 and a \u2014 and \u2014 and a\u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m just wondering what\nyou think about that \u2014 that theory. You can tell me it\u2019s bullshit, if you want.",
        "Q: Can be \u2014 can \u2014 no, no, no, can be. Always the reader finds out something which\nthe writer didn\u2019t know of, that you can read it in it. I remember writing those 12\nweeks, where for me, as if my father was \u2014 would have sitten on the opposite side,\nlike you now, and I could tell him everything, what made me furious. This was the\nsituation. And whether it\u2019s in a transitional kind of art, that something 1s reflecting\nHitler and my father, and me and my father, I really don\u2019t know. I \u2014 I hesitant \u2014 I\nhad nothing in mind. When I was sitting down the first day, in the morning, I had 10\nor 12 weeks holiday, so I could write it, from \u201cStern\u201d magazine, and I didn\u2019t know\nexactly how to write it. I had a lot of files. And then it started with the first\nsentence, and then \u2014 then I knew I had to address him personally. To you. And that\nwas it.",
        "Q: That\u2019s \u2014 I think that\u2019s a very important point, because I think that \u2014 that really\nstrengthens the book and \u2014 and makes it so much more personal, that you\u2019re \u2014 that\nyou\u2019re actually addressing him. That was \u2014 that was my feeling when I was reading\nit. Let\u2019s see. Oh, one other \u2014 another thing that\u2019s sort of related, is \u2014 is it seems to\nme that you \u2014 you s \u2014 you take several opportunities to inflict posthumous pain on\n138June 6, 2016\nyour father by \u2014 by sort of constantly pointing out how little he meant to Hitler.\nYou know, he \u2014 he \u2014 I \u2014I mean, you do that in general, but \u2014 but there are several\npoints where you\u2019re saying, you know, you didn\u2019t \u2014 you didn\u2019t mean anything to\nHitler. Hitler didn\u2019t \u2014 rejected you in the following way. So I \u2014 I thought that was\nsort of an interesting device to \u2014 to \u2014 to use. Now I\u2019m just sort of giving my own\nopinion, so I\u2019m going to try and stop that.",
        "A: I\u2019m thankful that you\u2019re giving this opinion.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see. Oh, so okay, this 1s \u2014 this is interesting. What \u2014 what did or do you\nthink about the sort of minor criminals who s \u2014 who escaped with their lives, and\neven went back to normal life? Did you ever pursue any kind of \u2014 legally, or as a \u2014\nto cover them journalistically, or try to expose them?",
        "A: No. I tried in all my articles to defend democracy, but I started as a cultural\neditor, so I wa \u2014 mostly together with the German writers, and actors, and so. And\nlater on, when I was a war correspondent for \u201cStern\u201d magazine, it was also quite\nanother thing to deal with. And no, it \u2014 it\u2019s now \u2014 now I am doing it, with my last\nbook on this earth, about denazification. I went into the \u2014 into the archives in\nGermany, too, and telling them, I don\u2019t give you names, but you hand me over files\nfrom A to Zed, just to get a clue what\u2019s a middle class, lower Nazis, th-the \u2014 theJune 6, 2016\nFurher of villages and of some areas, what they have done, and how do they defend\nthemselves? And it was really great.",
        "Q: Great.",
        "A: It\u2019s really great what you find out. You find really out that this is very strict way\nfrom there, to \u2014 to nowaday Germany. Because personally you can say, everybody\nwho is accused can defend himself, yeah? That\u2019s for sure, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s a human\nright, inside the democracy, for instance. But how they did it, it\u2019s so full of\ncowardice, again. It\u2019s so unbelievable. So I always said, before we had this cro \u2014\nbig problem now with refugees, I used to say to the people, when they asked me, do\nyou think that this will happen again? And I always used to say yes. We only \u2014 if\nwe have about five to six years really heavy economical problems, for instance, we\nwill have another Hitler, and we will build up, not the gas chambers, because they\nare known \u2014 too well known, but we will get other things to invent, to make the\nguilty new ones dead.",
        "Q: I-In Germany, or elsewhere?",
        "A: In Germany. No, I don\u2019t think [indecipherable] elsewhere, just in Germany.",
        "Q: Just in Germany.",
        "A: Because now you can see, that I never thought about refugees, because it was a\nbrand new problem, and you see it exactly how the silent majority of the Germans\n140\nJune 6, 2016\nreally think, how they really behave, what \u2014 and that \u2014 wow, that I\u2019m very much\nafraid of.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and what \u2014 have you followed at all the \u2014 the more current war crimes\ntrials against the, very old at this point, Nazis \u2014",

        "Q: Okay. And your mother, did she come from a financially well-off family?",
        "Q: I see. So she had to go earn her living very early on.",

Do you have any sense of that?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And your mother? How wa \u2014 how was she towards you in those early years?",
        "Q: Well that, you know, I was circling around these questions, around this, you\nknow, every child has an early influence, and who was your early influence, and\nyou answered my question.",
        "Q: Tell \u2014",
        "Q: Tell me, what kind of a person was Hilde(ph)?",
        "Q: You can say it in German.",
        "Q: So, a camp outside of \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Did you remember seeing those prisoners?",
        "Q: Tell me about that afternoon.",
        "Q: There\u2019s a donkey, and \u2014 and \u2014 and the prisoners are ordered to sit on it.",
        "Q: So it was a game, it was a \u2014",
        "Q: Norman, or Michael?",
        "Q: So, by game, I meant 1t was something that the guards were doing to the\nprisoners, as sport.",
        "Q: Of course. Of course. And it was cause Hilde(ph) had a reason to be there.",
        "Q: Do you remember the name of it?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Well \u2014 but when I asked you what \u2014 what kind of a person she was, in the sense\nof how did she influence you, your answer was that she had many lovers. And IJune 6, 2016\nwant to know, what did she d \u2014 give to a child? What was it in her presence in your\nlife, that made the difference?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. She had a sense of humor.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "Q: So much for her day off.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did she have any \u2014 this sounds so \u2014 I mean, even as I say it, to me it\nsounds so silly, but did she have any political leanings? Did she have any \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. How much involvement \u2014 I mean, you mentioned this a little bit in\npassing, but you were with your brother Michael when you were in this\nausenlager(ph), were y \u2014 were you two more often together, than not?",
        "Q: It was him and you?",
        "Q: Okay. So you spent your childhood with him, as well?",
        "Q: What about your older siblings? Your two sisters and your brother, where were\nthey, in your first years, during these war years?",
        "Q: So they were at home\u2019?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "Q: Which was his age.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come to that, but I\u2019d like to get a sense of the personalities. When she was\nyoung, you say she was talented, and she used to draw, yes? And she was quiet.\nWhy did you think she was stupid, as a little boy?June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Well, I know that.",
        "Q: Oh, they\u2019re useless. They\u2019re useless, you know. But what about the \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. What about the older siblings? Norman, or \u2014",
        "Q: Did he play with you?",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "Q: Defending it.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s mean.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: That\u2019s a lot of fun, yeah. So he was somebody who was engaged with the\nyounger ones. He was somebody he di \u2014 it wasn\u2019t like you were young and \u2014",
        "Q: And what about Sigrid?",
        "Q: She wasn\u2019t?",
        "Q: Yeah. Enough said. Enough said.",
        "Q: Well, she was 12 years older than you were.",
        "Q: And so she \u2014 I guess what I\u2019m trying to do is get a sense of how your \u2014 the\nsiblings in your early years interacted with each other. How involved were you \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: That is what I wanted to get a sense of.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Such as? What kind of adventures would little \u2014",
        "Q: When you say these things, though, stealing and lying can be serious, or they can\nbe the sorts of things all children do, that is candies, or \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, so these \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. But it would have been a silent kind of transmittal. That is, nobody told\nyou, of the grownups.",
        "Q: Of course not.",
        "Q: Were you, in the German word, verwohnt? Spoiled?",
        "Q: Yes, but did Hilde(ph) ever discipline you? That is, if you \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 did something wrong \u2014",
        "Q: Or talked to you and say, this is not something that you should be doing?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah. Because in every child\u2019s life, the sense of what is right, and what is\nwrong, has to be introduced by somebody.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "Q: Of course, of course. But it\u2019s \u2014 you know, if your parents weren\u2019t involved, if\nthey were, you know, distracted, or doing other things, somebody had to.",
        "Q: That was her. Tell me a little bit about your mother. And what do you remember\nof her during those years. Like I said with your father.",
        "Q: Okay, are there episodes? Like we ask \u2014 you know, you remember your father\nwith the shaving cream, and in the Bellevue and \u2014June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Michael is dead.",
        "Q: Through this long corridor.",
        "Q: What kind of a person was Michael? I asked about all the others, but about him,\nwhat kind of a \u2014June 6, 2016",
        "Q: \u2014 as your first play \u2014 playmate?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, curly hair.",
        "Q: Well, he\u2019s your older brother.",
        "Q: He loved your father.",
        "Q: How did this show itself?",
        "Q: Even when you were a little boy?",
        "Q: When you compare it that way?June 6, 2016",
        "Q: When he called you a stranger.",
        "Q: What did \u2014 what \u2014 what did he do when \u2014 when he learned of that? When you\nsay sad.",
        "Q: Oh. He was distraught.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Thirteen liters a day?June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And you put it down to the favor, from the very beginning, that your father did\nyou when he wouldn\u2019t take you in his arms.",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019ll come to that. We\u2019|l come to that.",
        "Q: I\u2019m still \u2014 I\u2019m still in the early years \u2014",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Although I\u2019ve read some of the articles that were written, some of them are very,\nvery good, very detailed. Very, very good \u2014",
        "Q: You said when you were little, and he didn\u2019t take you in his arms and \u2014 in this\nSchloss Bellevue, were \u2014 you were stunned. Is that right? How come he doesn\u2019t do\nit, \u2019'm being rejected? And that\u2019s the feeling you had of distance? Is this what I\u2019m\ntrying to understand?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: You feel it, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: You were in \u2014 uh-huh \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, it\u2019s October.",
        "Q: You knew because someone told you?",
        "Q: You knew it, but no adult had told you that this would be.",
        "Q: You were \u2014 you were in earshot of this?",
        "Q: So it\u2019s actually the first and the last visit \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 for you, and it was you and all of his children, and your mother.",
        "Q: And it was \u2014 and it\u2019s because Mr. Zeidel(ph) had come to your home, and the\nchildren talked about it with one another, that you were already aware.",
        "Q: Okay, so she had told you about this?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Of course, of course.",
        "Q: It was common knowledge.",
        "Q: Okay. I want to \u2014 Pll jump ahead, and then I'll move back.",
        "Q: But I remember in your book, you \u2014 you say afterwards, that your Aunt\nMargo(ph) had se \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 had s\u00e9ances where she would communi \u2014",
        "Q: Tante Marta(ph) would have sans \u2014 s\u00e9ances \u2014",
        "Q: My \u2014 my sincere apologies. My sincere apologies. How could I? How could I?\nOkay. So Tante Marta(ph) knew how to speak to the dead, yeah? And she would\nhave s\u00e9ances, and in those first months afterwards, your mother participated in\nthem. And lo and behold there were \u2014 there was communication with your father,\nyes? In these s\u00e9ances. And then your uncle passed away, and then that stopped.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: And why did he do that, by the way?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So maybe he was mentally ill?",
        "Q: Okay. But what I wanted to say with this, is that there is a section where you\nwrite, that when the communications with your father ceased \u2014 that is, you kept \u2014\nyou know, in the s\u00e9ance, they kept wanting to bring his spirit up, you yourself tried\nto do so. I think it was, you know, if Uncle Julius was a butterfly, then you were\nseeing, was your father here, was your father there. And it ended up with a little\ndog, that you thought maybe his spirit had rested in the little dog?",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: The butterfly.",
        "Q: The reason why I bring it up is that when I read that passage, yes, I know it was\nsupposed to be humorous, but it also gave me a sense of a child who is missing his\nfather, who wonders whether his father is here, his father is there, his father is\nsomeplace else.",
        "Q: Did you miss him?June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Prestigious, in a way?",
        "Q: Even more special.",
        "Q: I want to go back to the descriptions of the other two places. You gave us a\ndescription of Schoberhof. First, a question: why did you have the Wawel andJune 6, 2016\nKressendorf as places to live? Why was it two for the family? Or were there\ndifferent functions of each place?",
        "Q: So it was like a \u2014 a government building? It was a castle, but it was a\ngovernment building?",
        "Q: The Wawel?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So describe to me both places. What did they look like, and what were they?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Corridors?June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Tapestries, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: These \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So what kind of festivities were these?",
        "Q: So tell us, so that now is not from the eyes of a child, but so that people will\nknow, these are not just any old places in buildings, in Polish history. Can you tell\nus what was the Wawel, what was Kressendorf, what was Bellevue?",
        "Q: Hide and seek.",
        "Q: So this is sort of like the central place of Polish kings?",
        "Q: Czestochowa, yeah. And Kressendorf? Did that belo \u2014",
        "Q: Were they? And they we \u2014 these were SS, rather than another branch, or not \u2014\nnot the police, or Wehrmacht, or anything like that?",
        "Q: So you had \u2014 you had these guards at your family place, so you would be safe, in\nother words.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Today no one would do that.",
        "Q: No. What about Sigrid? Was she going to school there too?June 6, 2016",
        "Q: And Bellevue? Why was your father in Bellevue?",
        "Q: Okay. And what was Bellevue as a \u2014 as a place?",
        "Q: And did you tell Lech Walesa?",
        "Q: Walesa\u2019?",
        "Q: Did you?",
        "Q: My goodness, my goodness. But it does illustrate for us the \u2014 the rooms, the\nplace, the structures of your childhood, were not \u2014 I\u2019m talking physical structures,\nwere out of the ordinary. Very much out of the ordinary. That\u2019s why I wanted to\nhighlight it, you know. The central [indecipherable] in Poland \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay, tell us.",
        "Q: So you went by train, you would travel by train for \u2014",
        "Q: And in \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So were \u2014",
        "Q: Thank you, that was one of my questions, was the last \u2014 when was the last \u2014",
        "Q: You do, you really do. And even some I haven\u2019t thought of yet. So, you spend\nyour childhood back and forth \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 between the three places. And the last time is August \u201944, when you are in \u2014",
        "Q: Autumn. Excuse me, autumn \u201944. You mentioned earlier that your parents\u2019\nmarriage broke down in \u201942. Can you tell us a little bit about that?",
        "Q: What was her last name\u2019?",
        "Q: Banker.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So she wanted to find out what was happen \u2014 what happened to her missing child",
        "Q: \u2014 to her son, I presume.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Did she ever find out?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So your mother did this?",
        "Q: Pendulum, back and forth?",
        "Q: And yet, he is the governor general of Poland.",
        "Q: Tell me about \u2014 tell me more about your mother. You said you were on her side,\nduring this divorce proceeding \u2014 or this divorce scenario.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay.",
        "Q: Did you feel this \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Did the older children know about what was going on?",
        "Q: And why did she want to hold on so much?",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t love.",
        "Q: Very bitter.",
        "Q: Very bitter for both, you know, but very bitter. In this world that I\u2019ve asked you\nto paint for me, you\u2019ve mentioned a few times when the reality hit. You\u2019re in this\nausenlager(ph) with \u2014 with your nanny, Hilde(ph), and you see these very thin\npeople being made to jump up and down on the donkey \u2014 that is, they\u2019re on the\ndonkey, and then they\u2019re thrown down. Did \u2014 did you ever see anything, as a child?\nDid anybody say anything as a child, of the outer world, of any of the camps, or of\nany \u2014 anything of what was happening to the Jews, to the Poles?June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Oh dear.",
        "Q: You\u2019re a child.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: You \u2014 yeah, you \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Okay. So that also sort of answers my question of was there any\nmention of people like the Poles, or the Jews, in conversation.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: In Poland?",
        "Q: You?June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Yeah, sure. I mean, for heating, you mean.",
        "Q: For heating, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Was it coal heating?",
        "Q: Russ?",
        "Q: Ashes.",
        "Q: Ashes.",
        "Q: Isn\u2019t that interesting?",
        "Q: Well, he thought so, and that\u2019s the important part, you know. And it\u2019s also \u2014 so,\nokay, so now I get it \u2014 a picture. The \u2014 Kressendorf was heated by coal ovens.",
        "Q: Okay, but in certain rooms. And, of course, a room ha \u2014 the coal is in the actual\nbedroom, and you \u2014 there was \u2014 a-and there was sheets, you know, white sheets \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and the \u2014 some of the ash went on that, and for that he was going to be sent\naway. Did you meet him after the book came out, or not?",
        "Q: No.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: We have to tell the whole story then, of what \u2014 this was an assassination\nattempt?",
        "Q: Tell us \u2014 tell us what that was. Now in a \u2014 as a grownup voice, rather than as a\nchild. What happened in this instance?",
        "Q: The locomotive, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So, were the 20 caught? Were they caught?June 6, 2016",
        "Q: So, you know, one of my questions, which I had anticipated would be later on,\nbut because we\u2019re on Poland, I wanted to find out what kind of reaction your book\nhad had in Poland when you came out with it, and you wrote it. How did \u2014 how \u2014 it\nwas still before solidarity had happened, but it still was not yet an independent\nPoland, and \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 that might have had some influence.",
        "Q: Yeah.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: I mean, it\u2019s irony upon irony.",
        "Q: So that was \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: And what year did it come out, \u201988 then, \u201989? After the \u201987 [indecipherable]",
        "Q: In English. But in Polish \u2014\nQ2: In English, right.",
        "Q: But in Polish?",
        "Q: Yeah.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Yeah. So the Catholic church bought up all the copies.",
        "Q: So did it ever hit the market? Did the book ever hit \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s so ironic. It-It\u2019s just so ironic, because you write in the book of the\nGerman priest who complains about the Polish clergy.",
        "Q: As well as, you know, the \u2014 the post-war \u2014",
        "Q: Pardon?",
        "Q: Yes, I have. We\u2019re going to take a quick break now.",
        "Q: Action. Okay, before the break, we were talking an awful lot about your\nchildhood, your early years, which coincided with the war years, when you were\nhaving your very first impressions, your very first memories, and your father was\nthe director \u2014 the governor general of Poland. I\u2019d like to bri \u2014 you know, take that\nup now, with the end of the war. You say that one of your most stark memories is\nwhen he\u2019s back at your home, near Schliersee, and you break his glasses. Do you\nhave any memories of the war ending? Do you have ever any memories of your life\nchanging, before the actual end of the war?",
        "Q: You were looking forward to this?",
        "Q: Barricades.",
        "Q: And where was that?",
        "Q: When you say as the Queen of Poland, what do you mean by that?",
        "Q: So that\u2019s thir \u2014 1939.",
        "Q: And she took it seriously?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: That is when he is in his office?",
        "Q: And was it right away? That is, the army comes, the U.S. Army comes to\nNeuhaus, and is it an immediate thing, or is it that they\u2019re there for some days?",
        "Q: So he was looking for him.",
        "Q: He was \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah. It wasn\u2019t something that was \u2014 they fell upon him, and they \u2014 they realize,\nor \u2014 or that the army is there for a number of days, and only then somebody comes.\nIt was a \u2014",
        "Q: It was immediate.",
        "Q: Insulting him.",
        "Q: You knew about it in Schliersee?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: This is this year, 2016?",
        "Q: The secretary.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: This is Leslie Swift, recording a segment of an interview with Niklas Frank, on\nJune 6\"\", 2016, and we will be focusing right now on \u2014 mostly on Niklas\u2019s book,\nand what he talks about, his father and his family, in the book. So Niklas, wa \u2014 we\nspend a lot of time studying here at the museum, what leads people to other-ise\nJews and \u2014 and other \u2014 other people, and \u2014 to the point where they are no longer\nhuman, and thus disposable. Can you trace for us, to the best of your understanding,\nthis person \u2014 the personal journey that led your father from being someone who was\ntrained in the law, and presumably respected it, to the acceptance, and even\nenthusiastic participation in mass murder?",
        "Q: So he didn\u2019t have this underlying anti-Jewish feeling that some of the other true\nbelievers did.",
        "Q: About the occupation of the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And, at several points in the book, you insert brackets that serve as pleas to your\nfather to choose another course, one that would have him stand up to Hitler, and\nprevent him from becoming the man that he eventually became. Do you think that\nhe \u2014 why do you think he didn\u2019t take this path? Was it cowardice, or a combination\nof things? What \u2014 what about Hitler was so attractive to him?",
        "Q: You have to remember the situation in Germany. Before the first World War,\nGermany was really a leading nation, in industrialization. We got the most Nobel\nprizes. The American students, for instance, came, studying medicine, to Germany.\nWe really was a brilliant country. And suddenly, everything was gone, everything\nwas gone. And it was, for sure, the Treaty of Versailles after the war, which madeJune 6, 2016\nHitler possible. My father wrote in his youngster\u2019s diary, Germany needs his\nhonor back. We need a strong person, who can fulfill this task. Maybe it\u2019s me. But\nthen it was Hitler. So, the middle class in Germany, and I would say most of the\npeople, were really looking for becoming a nation again, full of honor. This was the\none side. And the other side was really the economical situation, which was very\nbad. And there was about 10 million unemployed people, growing, and we had the\ninflation. And then suddenly there were the people in the brown dress, marching in\ngood rows [indecipherable] in German, the word, yes. And they had the special\nprogram, not looking to the right, and to the left, just we have our program, and\nhitting everybody who was against it. For instance, the communists, yes. So this\nwas it \u2014 something which a lot of people attracted, in Germany. And Hitler was a\nbrilliant speaker. He was really very good. He wouldn\u2019t have succeeded if at this\ntime was already TV, for instance. It was his personal appearance, and this very,\nvery strong speeches he delivered everywhere. And when he came to power, he\nreally managed that the unemployment was nearly gone. And there was a big, big\nimprovement in Germany. There\u2019s a very famous German-Jewish historian,\nSebastian Haffner, he is dead since many years. He wrote a book about Hitler, and\nhe wrote in it, if Hitler would have died through a traffic accident in 1938, he\nwould be remembered as a great, great statesman, because he brought back Austria,June 6, 2016\nand it was a\u2014 a\u2014 now really in a good employment sitting. People, German people,\nwere satisfied. And on the other hand was this really, I would say tilt to\nhomosexuality, this relation from my father to Hitler. It was really, really, really\npersonal.",
        "Q: And so, you mentioned before that y \u2014 you don\u2019t think your father was a true\nanti-Semite, the way that many of the \u2014 the original Nazis were, and it was more a\ncase of expediency than anything else. And \u2014 and I just wondered, does that \u2014 does\nthat make him better, or worse, in your eyes? That \u2014 that he didn\u2019t have a belief, but\njust sort of went along with the tide?",
        "Q: Okay. And in the book I noticed that God comes up a lot. And what \u2014 what\nusefulness do you believe God served for your father? Do you think he was a true\nbeliever in any sense, even at the end? And do you have any personal memories of\nhim speaking about God, before 1945?",
        "Q: Yeah. And \u2014 and so, from what I\u2019ve read on the subject, God and Nazism, the\nconcept of God and Nazism was really cynical and prac \u2014 and sort of a cynical in a\npractical purpose. But God was not allowed to really supersede Hitler. And I\u2019m just\nwondering what are \u2014 what are your own conceptions of God, if you feel okay\ntalking about that. I mean, do you \u2014 are you a believer? Do you have any notion of\nthat, or \u2014 you know, it \u2014 unless that\u2019s too personal.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Well, I\u2019m right there with you, so \u2014 just a little editorializing. So, when your\nbook came out, Ina got into a little bit about th-th \u2014 the reception of it, and the \u2014\nwhat people \u2014 some people were shocked, and \u2014 and that kind of thing. Were you\nsurprised by the \u2014 by the reaction, and did you lose any friends, or did \u2014 did \u2014 did\nyour relations with \u2014 with other people that you knew change when the book came\nout?",
        "Q: You mean, asking you questions about th-the details, or \u2014",
        "Q: And was that an ex \u2014 so you \u2014 that was an explicit motivation for you to write\nthe book, was it because \u2014",
        "Q: No, but to \u2014 the silence in Germany, that \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 you \u2014 you wanted to \u2014 you wanted to break that, and break it in very shocking\nway, In a very \u2014",
        "Q: Did they? Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay. And was it a bestseller?",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you receive any correspondence or fan mail that was \u2014 was really\nthankful, for you to have done this?",
        "Q: So, one of the things I really liked about the book was your use of black humor.",
        "Q: [\u2014I-I really -I -I \u2014I \u2014I myself have a very difficult relationship with my\nfamily, and that\u2019s one way I get through it is to \u2014 to be funny about it, you know.\nBut one of my favorite things that you said was that you referred to ha \u2014 Hans\nFrank as Rosemary\u2019s baby, which I thought was \u2014 was great. But, can you just\nspeak a little bit about that, about how that helps you cope, how being able to be\nfunny, while at the same time talking about this really horrible subject matter.\nWhat\u2019s \u2014 what\u2019s your thinking behind that?",
        "Q: And I ha \u2014I have to say that on \u2014 one thing that struck me also, about that use of\nblack humor was it \u2014 that because we work at the Holocaust Museum, and we deal\nwith this material every day, this horrible material, we also use that as a coping\nmechanism, so I sort of recognize that in the book as well. But it \u2014 here comes a non\nsequitur \u2014 so I was reading, and \u2014 and your father at one point early on, worked for\nthe film workers\u2019 union?",
        "Q: And what \u2014 what \u2014 what exactly was that?",
        "Q: But \u2014 but, like \u2014",

        "Q: And did she, that you recall, have any opinions, feelings about th-the situation in\nPoland, either ger \u2014 you know, sort of writ large Germany\u2019s actions in Poland, or\nspecifics of what was happening to the Polish people, and \u2014 and to the Jew? Was \u2014\nwas there any kind of sense of that?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Oh, okay. Okay. And then at one point you said you \u2014 when you were talking to\nIna, you said that your mother was very practical and pragmatic. She sort of really\nsaw things the way they were. But then, in the book, you say \u2014 it\u2019s just sort of one\nline where you say, your mother thought that unconditional surrender was wrong,\nwhen it came right down to it, she \u2014 I guess sh \u2014 did she think that there was some\nway of preserving Germany in \u2014 in some way, or \u2014",

        "Q: That film, that film.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, so \u2014 so I'll just go over quickly, the \u2014 the history of that, so that we have\nthat on the record. We found out about this from Erika(ph) Noble(ph), whose uncle\nwas friendly with your father at Nuremberg, right? Was he an interpreter, or \u2014",
        "Q: What \u2014 what was the story on that?",
        "Q: It \u2014 okay, th-the gu \u2014 the man you were talking about, right? So s \u2014 so, do you\nknow how \u2014 how it ended up with him? Did he take it from \u2014 from your father?",
        "Q: Okay.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. So he got it from your mother.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. Was there any suggestion of any romantic \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "Q: And so \u2014 so the way we found out about it was we got an email \u2014 I got an email\nout of the blue, from Erika(ph) saying I have this footage, maybe you\u2019re interested,\nand we jumped all over it, because it was just amazing. And then, by the time we",
        "Q: \u2014 that it belonged to you, because you were the \u2014 the heir, you know. And then\nwe were so upset, because we wanted it, and \u2014 but understood, you know, where\nshe was coming from. And then, you know, many years later now, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re\nmaking this happen. But \u2014 but I st \u2014 I d \u2014I hadn't quite gotten the story of \u2014 of how\nit got from here to there to here, you know, so \u2014 so it\u2019s good to have it on record, I\nthink. And then, to continue though, to talk about the film, which we\u2019ll watch\ntomorrow, so we can talk about it together, but the d \u2014 do you th \u2014 ha \u2014 did the film\n\u2014has the film when you\u2019ve seen it, has it awakened any sympathy, or \u2014 or more\nanger, or any other kinds of emotions, or in any way changed your viewpoint on\nyour \u2014 about your family, seeing them in these intimate situations?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Infuri \u2014 so it actually made \u2014 made it worse, in a way, to see this.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. And do you think that the book would have been any different, if\nyou had had the film to refer to? Do you think you would have added details from\nthe \u2014 from the film, or anything like that? No. Let\u2019s see. So I \u2014I find the film\npersonally, especially interesting for a lot of reasons, not least because I\u2019ve now\nspent a lot of time studying the concept of amateur film, home movies, and things\nlike that, and what it can tell us, especially how it can contradict, and complement\nthe official records, such as, you know, newsreels, propaganda pieces, Nuremberg\nfootage; all of these places where your father appears in official capacities. And yet\nhere he is in this amateur film \u2014 not that he\u2019s more authentic there, but that it\u2019s a\ndifferent view.",
        "Q: And so you can put those two pieces together, and get a bigger picture. And, di-\ndi \u2014 I already asked you this question, an-and the answer is no, but \u2014 but to see these",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, that is \u2014 that\u2019s incredible.",
        "Q: We have nothing like that. Do you remember any \u2014 were you on that trip, do you\nremember that at all? No, no. So, let\u2019s see ... I think some of these questions have\nalready been asked. So I \u2014 0-okay, so were there specific turning points for you, that\nyou can remember, as your opinion of your father developed over time, or \u2014 and\nwas the process, in coming to terms with your mother and your brother and your\nother siblings, a \u2014 a different process, bec \u2014 per-perhaps because they were still\nalive, and he was dead?",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t trying to convince them.",
        "Q: Yeah. It seems that \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right, right. And so some of the scenes in the book could be considered \u2014 I\nmean, obscene is a word that\u2019s \u2014 that has judgment attached to it, which I d \u2014I don\u2019t\nmean to imply, but there are scenes that are \u2014 that could be called obscene, and I\u2019m\njust wondering what are \u2014 what are you trying to say to your father with that, with \u2014\nwith those scenes? Are \u2014 are you trying to vent anger at him, are you trying to say \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right, right.June 6, 2016",
        "Q: And in terms of the \u2014 and I hope you don\u2019t mind me asking this, but in terms of\nthe se \u2014 scene of the masturbation, in the \u2014",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: How do I know about it then? Do I read \u2014 I didn\u2019t read about it in the German\nversion.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Oh, okay, well I mean, maybe I read that as masturbation. But \u2014June 6, 2016",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting. But anyway, my point was \u2014",
        "Q: Who?",
        "Q: Oh okay \u2014 okay.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Oh my God, we\u2019re such prudes, aren\u2019t we? But \u2014 but li \u2014 can I just tell you my\nreading of that scene, and you will tell me how wrong I am, or if I\u2019m \u2014 you know,\ntell me a different story. My reading of that scene is that you are doing that, because\nyou\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re trying to reach the ultimate point of joy and\npleasure at your fa \u2014 that your father is dead.",
        "Q: No. Okay, tell me.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: A relief, okay, okay, okay, interesting. So, it seems that it\u2019s clear that your father\nconstantly craved Hitler\u2019s approval, and was always disappointed because Hitler\ndidn\u2019t really have much respect for him, if any at all. And \u2014 and that reads to me, at\nleast, as a father-son relationship, the \u2014 the f \u2014 the father constantly disappointing\nthe son. And I \u2014 I wonder if that is \u2014 is a theme in the book in the sense that, you\nknow, this relationships between fathers and sons, is there a parallel there? Because\nyou \u2014 you rid \u2014 you were rejected by your father, and then you rejected your father.\nBut, your f\u2014 your \u2014 your father never rejected Hitler til the \u2014 til the end. And I-I\u2019m\njust wondering if you see any parallel there, 1f you see any cause \u2014 cause the whole\nbook seems to be about fathers and sons. Mostly about your relationship with your\n\u2014 with your father, but there\u2019s also \u2014 I kept thinking, there\u2019s this \u2014 there\u2019s some kind\nof filial relation between Hitler and \u2014 and Hans Frank that\u2019s not being fulfilled,",
        "Q: Can be \u2014 can \u2014 no, no, no, can be. Always the reader finds out something which\nthe writer didn\u2019t know of, that you can read it in it. I remember writing those 12\nweeks, where for me, as if my father was \u2014 would have sitten on the opposite side,\nlike you now, and I could tell him everything, what made me furious. This was the\nsituation. And whether it\u2019s in a transitional kind of art, that something 1s reflecting\nHitler and my father, and me and my father, I really don\u2019t know. I \u2014 I hesitant \u2014 I\nhad nothing in mind. When I was sitting down the first day, in the morning, I had 10\nor 12 weeks holiday, so I could write it, from \u201cStern\u201d magazine, and I didn\u2019t know\nexactly how to write it. I had a lot of files. And then it started with the first\nsentence, and then \u2014 then I knew I had to address him personally. To you. And that\nwas it.",
        "Q: That\u2019s \u2014 I think that\u2019s a very important point, because I think that \u2014 that really\nstrengthens the book and \u2014 and makes it so much more personal, that you\u2019re \u2014 that\nyou\u2019re actually addressing him. That was \u2014 that was my feeling when I was reading\nit. Let\u2019s see. Oh, one other \u2014 another thing that\u2019s sort of related, is \u2014 is it seems to\nme that you \u2014 you s \u2014 you take several opportunities to inflict posthumous pain on",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see. Oh, so okay, this 1s \u2014 this is interesting. What \u2014 what did or do you\nthink about the sort of minor criminals who s \u2014 who escaped with their lives, and\neven went back to normal life? Did you ever pursue any kind of \u2014 legally, or as a \u2014\nto cover them journalistically, or try to expose them?",

        "Q: And do you think it\u2019s worthwhile to still be prosecuting these people?",
        "Q: Yeah. And why? What do you think is \u2014 is the benefit?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. And so, turning back to your book, there\u2019s \u2014 I think this is a really \u2014\nand this is the \u2014 the English translation, but I imagine it\u2019s similar in \u2014 in German.\nYou say you already had a full tank of that poisonous bile, which for me, in my\ndays of the Third Reich, was turned into chocolate and lollipops. Can you tell us\nwhat you meant by that? Does this \u2014 does this hint that you felt any guilt from\nbenefitting from these spoils?",
        "Q: And do you remember when you re \u2014 realized, or started to realize what the\ntrade-off was there, that \u2014",
        "Q: After the war.",
        "Q: And do you think that that \u2014 that the experience that he had growing up, do you\nthink that contributed to him becoming an alcoholic?",
        "Q: Because he was the oldest, and \u2014",
        "Q: So, you also write in the book that, paraphrasing, that your father stated, or made\nsome decree or something, that Jews were vectors of deceit, disease, and they were\nsubhuman. Do you think he really believed that?",
        "Q: And \u2014 and it was more of a \u2014 a sort of an expedient policy \u2014",
        "Q: A directive?",

        "Q: Mm-hm, placard, yeah.\nQ2: A poster.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And so he \u2014 he was also in \u2014 he was educated in a lot of ways. He was a piano\nplayer, you said. And there was something in the book, I believe, about him\ncomposing a song about \u2014 he \u2014 he composed a song \u2014 something to do with\ncomposing a song of \u2014 of occupying territory, or something like that? Does that \u2014",
        "Q: Am I misremembering this?",
        "Q: Oh, okay. Okay. And was it \u2014 was it set to music, or 1t was a poem?",
        "Q: It was a poem, okay.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. And so, I\u2014 \u2019'm-\u2014I\u2019m really fascinated by your mother\u2019s fascination\nwith furs, and I have to, full disclosure say that part of it is because I\u2019m a\nvegetarian, and I find it very interesting that someone would be so \u2014 just meatful \u2014\nI mean, an addiction to furs, almost, it seemed like. And I \u2014 I \u2014 I just \u2014 I guess the\nconnection that I\u2019m making in my mind is \u2014 1s that he \u2014 here\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s\nliterally stealing the skin of an animal from another animal, that animal being a\nhuman, and it seems to have a very \u2014 a v\u2014a very deep metaphorical meaning,\nsomehow, to me.",
        "Q: Well, for anybody, but yeah, especially for me, being a vegetarian. And \u2014 and\nagain here, I\u2019m just stating my \u2014 my sort of reading of it, but I just \u2014 I just wanted to\nsay that, because I thought it was so interesting that she \u2014 I \u2014 an-and obviously, she\nworked in the fur trade before, so she was \u2014",
        "Q: Before the war?",
        "Q: Right? No?",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "Q: So, do you have any sense of why she was so into furs?",
        "Q: No, but I mean, for herself, you know.",
        "Q: Because it was a luxury item, or \u2014",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: Did she have a favorite type of fur?",
        "Q: Oh.",

        "Q: Okay.\nQ2: There was the decree prohibiting shooting of these animals, remember? You\nwrote about it.",
        "Q: Well, they should be. Okay, so \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m almost done. So \u2014 so \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2014 okay. By \u2014 up to page 154, there is no, that I noticed, there\u2019s no talk of filial\nlove, or worship. The normal feelings of a young boy for his father, from the very \u2014\nfrom the young age, before you realize, before any \u2014 any child realizes that his\nparents are not perfect, and that they\u2019re flawed, and etcetera. And do you rem \u2014 do\nyou remember having any of those feelings for your father, before you started\nrealizing what was really going on?",

        "Q: Right, right, right. Let\u2019s see. Oh, what does minister without portfolio mean?",
        "Q: Okay. So that\u2019s before he became \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. And is it a\u2014 it \u2014 so it\u2019s a lesser title, because you don\u2019t have a portfolio.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. And, let\u2019s see. So \u2014 and at one point in the book, you say that your\nmother was disturbed by Kristallnacht, and you don\u2019t give much more information\nabout that. Do you know why she would have been disturbed?",
        "Q: Oh, her fur Jews.\n149\nJune 6, 2016",

        "Q: Sure.",
        "Q: Sure, sure. Okay, okay. And then \u2014 so \u2014 and \u2014 and then you also mention at one\npoint that Frank, obviously before the general government, worked with Roland\nFreisler, and if there\u2019s any \u2014 any legal person that Americans know about during\nthis period, and that\u2019s not much, that\u2019s for sure, it\u2019s Freisler, because of what\nhappened 20\" of July, and all that. So, in what capacity did he \u2014 did he work withJune 6, 2016\nFreisler, and did he ha \u2014 do you remember him having a personal opinion about\nhim, or \u2014",

And by the way,\nwhenever I was already in school, and I came to school in the autumn of \u201945. And\nJune 6, 2016\nthe Nuremberg trial was broadcasted. Every evening there was one hour they\ntalked about the day. And everybody, because we knew each other, everybody in\nthe family of the other children, the parents of them, they\u2019re talking about it.

        "A: Or has haunted me. Could be. The good thing was in this time, that a lot of\nfamilies, they lost their father due to the war. They all were killed in the\nWehrmacht. So, it was comparable to other families who \u2014 where the children also\ngrew up without a father. The special thing on the Frank family and this, it was like\nan honor. You were special because your father got a year long trial, and\nafterwards, he wasn\u2019t shot by a Russian in the war, or by a French, or an English,\nbut he was hanged, so that was special. So \u2014",

        "A: Yes. Also, my mother, and also my father, the stupid guy, was looking forward\nthat the American came. There was a\u2014 some brave young Germans, who seized theJune 6, 2016\nBavarian broadcasting radio, and delivered some new program, and my father was\nstanding there listening to the radio, and saying that\u2019s it, that\u2019s what I always\nwanted to have. That now is coming. And he thought that this will be a new \u2014\nmaybe as \u2014 thought maybe it\u2019s a new career for me. And \u2014 and then the Americans\ncame, the lake of Schliersee is on \u2014 was right inside.

        "A: This year. And she wrote me that her father arrested my father. And I wrote back\nto her that that\u2019s strange, because I knew exactly it was Lieutenant Stein, but there\nwas another soldier, and a driver, in this open Jeep. And she said, maybe it was the\nother guy was my father. He\u2019s already dead. And then I urged her, please tell me,\nwhat \u2014 what was happening, what was the remembrance of your \u2014 the memory of\nyour father? And he said that when they entered this room in this \u2014 this office room,June 6, 2016\nmy father was standing with a pistol at his head, pretending that he\u2019s now killing\nhimself. And Monica\u2019s father went to this guy, to Hans Frank, said, no, no. We\nwill take care of it. Took away the pistol, and arrested him. So I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t\nhave another proof, but \u2014 but that\u2019s brand new for me, and I told it the other family\nof mine, and two of them, two nephews, sons of my brother Mikey, they thought as\nfar as they know, it could be possible. Because my father had a golden pistol, which\nwas made from the Jews in Krakow, by force. And \u2014 but I interviewed for my\nbook, this Helena(ph), the last love of my father.",

Mrs.\nWinter, why didn\u2019t he commit suicide? And she smiled at me and said, Niklas,\ntherefore he was too much of a coward. And so I think that the new story of\nMonica\u2019s father might not fit in, in that wa \u2014",
        "A: Because I think Helena would have told me.",

And also Mr.\nKruger(ph) should be his servant. And he was always keen to prove that he is in\npower of everything, also of the SS, which was \u2014 thinking in his brain was a big\nmistake, you know. Later on, during the trial, he always said it was Himmler, it\nwas only Himmler. But was rubbish. Because without the civil administration,\nhipler \u2014 him \u2014 Himmler couldn\u2019t have run the extermination camps. It was always\nwith the help of the civil administration. To get the Jews all together in th \u2014 in the\nghettos, and all this kind of stuff, it was always together with the civil\nadministration.",

And he told one of the psychiatrists who had access to the\nprisoners in Nuremberg, and \u2014 all my relatives, everybody urged me to destroy this\ndiary, but I wanted to show the world what I was fighting for, and so I voluntarily\nhanded it over to the Americans. And one of the \u2014 how di \u2014 attorneys \u2014 attorneys atJune 6, 2016\nNuremberg said to his secretary, there is this bloody stupid guy Hans Frank, who\nhanded over all the proofs against him. And he really was right.",

For instance, when he was traveling,\nafter we invaded Soviet Union \u2014 Galicia was the capital of Lemberg, or Lviv, or\nLwow, was ki\u2014 came to the governor general, and one year after this invasion he\ncame to the city of Lemberg, addressing about 300 German administration people,\nand they had \u2014 I just came through this old Jewish nest, by the way. I didn\u2019t see\nanybody of those flat footed Indians. What have you done with them? Had you ever\n\u2014had you ever done something evil to them? And the protocol 1s writing great\nhilarity.

        "A: So everybody knew what was going on with the Jews.",
        "A: Yes. Whatever happens after the war, maybe you can make mincemeat out of the\nPolish or Ukrainians, or whatever is running around here. Well-educated man my\nfather was, playing wonderfully piano, knowing Shakespeare by heart, and our\nGerman most important poet, Goethe. And he was saying sentences like this.",

And the most ugly\nones is that he wanted \u2014 he really terribly wanted the divorce. And knowing what\nwas going on in his country, the mass murdering of Jews, he wrote to my mother, I\nwill go into the dark. I see mountains of corpses. Don\u2019t follow me. Please give me\nfree, and stay out of it, and give me the divorce, and [indecipherable] not written\ndown, said I can marry Lilly. So he took the Holocaust as a trick to get the divorce.\nNice guy.

I terribly need a visa, could you please help\nme? And my mother answered to him, that\u2019s strange. My husband told me there are\nno difficulties. You will get your visa, I am sure of. I also got my passport for\ndiplomats. So I would say, 70 to 30, you will get your visa. See, I know of one of\nthe girlfriends who accompanied her. He didn\u2019t show up after the war, though. They\nmust have killed him, the Germans, my father. But after the war, the Schoberhof\nwas plundered.",

Because I am\nfear for the life of my children. And by the way, here is this big handbag, please\ncould you hide it as well, and I will get it back in two or three weeks, whenever\ntime goes by.

And two of the Jews recognized her again. She \u2014 they knew herJune 6, 2016\nfrom her visits in the Krakow ghetto. And how\u2019s the Jewish humor? They\naddressed her still Frau Minister.

And they made a fortune, and we don\u2019t\nhave to starve any more. That was my mother.",
        "A: My mother, on the other hand, was, I think the only person I met in my la \u2014 life,\nwho was living strictly to reality. When the Third Reich and her luxury was over,\nshe acknowledged it immediately. It\u2019s over now. It\u2019s over. She never glorified in\nfront of me, the Third Reich, the powerful living she had. All these servants, all this\nkind of stuff. She never glorified it. Now, she was poor again, like in the beginning\nof her life, and now she had to nourish five stupid children. And she did it. She did\nit. So she died worn out in the age of 62.",

And \u2014 but this where all the wa \u2014 always \u2014 all of this was handed over to\nthe Americans. And only the Raphael is missing still nowadays. I assume that this\nRaphael is hanging in a farmer\u2019s kitchen.",

So far that the Germans are telling you, nobody knew anything.\nWhen it was \u2014 Sigrid wrote it in a kind of, we know this. So it was like \u2014 and\nimagine, dear Mother, I couldn\u2019t have believed it. they say this. No. Quite normal.\nWhat we have done to the Jews, so they will kill us now.",

        "A: That visit was the last disappointment concerning my father. I was sitting on the\nlap of my mother. He was sitting behind the window, with a small gitter, that we\ncould understand each other. And I was sitting there, and my father laughed \u2014",

        "A: The strange thing is that my brother Michael never told anybody what our father\ntold him. Also, not to his children. That\u2019s really strange. Now he\u2019s dead, a long time\nago. And to Norman, he was alone, without our mother, because he was grownup,\nnearly. And to Norman he said, I\u2019m \u2014 I can\u2019t leave you anything but the manuscript\nwhich I wrote in the prison. And remember always, I am a man of law, I\u2019m not a\npoet, so maybe it\u2019s not all \u2014 and then I will give you one advice. Please build up\nhere something. [speaks German]June 6, 2016",

        "A: Don\u2019t talk too much. Don\u2019t talk too much. Because he was sentenced to death\nbecause of what he was talking in the first-hand. And I always say, that was an\nadvice of my father to be a coward. And my brother Norman said no, it was just to\nbe silent. And I was silent, and I said, so you was a coward, huh? As your father\nsaid to you you should be.",
        "A: Yeah. And then he wrote in his last letter to my brother Norman, this is\n[indecipherable] we have to die, in this war. We will follow millions of our\nsoldiers, of our brave soldiers, who were \u2014 already has been killed in this war. And\nwhat true ar \u2014 should I do with the rest of my life, for instance? Should I be dealt in\nrevenge from immigrants, traitors? So I prefer to be dead. So the immigrants were \u2014\nwere these really, those guys like Willy Brandt, our chancellor then, who said, weJune 6, 2016\ncan\u2019t fight this dictatorship, but we don\u2019t want to do anything with it, and so they\nemigrate. So they wa \u2014 they were the brave ones, and the \u2014 the really good ones. So\nhe \u2014 he hadn't got any idea, and he never acknowledged, after a year of trial, where\nthe Americans, the English and the French, and the Russian have shown them a lot\nof documents, even a movie about Auschwitz. What kind of horrible crimes this\nbunch of criminals has committed? And then he is writing something like this. And\nhe wrote to his lawyer, Mr. Zeidel(ph), and also to our mother, please make sure\nthat the future will see the true Frank. I was never a criminal. And my mother la \u2014\nsomething is like \u2014 he never acknowledged anything.",
        "A: No. [indecipherable] But there was this 18\" of April in 1946, he was on the\nstand, trial. And he was asked by Mr. Zeidel(ph), his defendant \u2014 his lawyer \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and asked him, have you ever had something to do with the extinguishing of\nJews \u2014 extermination of Jews? And my father, after a short silence, he said yes. I\nnever ordered to build up a concentration camp, but if I now look back what we\nhave done, and my own diary is a witness against me. What we have said, what we\nhave done, I only have to acknowledge this guilt. A thousand years will pass\nwithout taking away this guilt from the German people.June 6, 2016",
        "A: Yes. Now I ask you, when I am asked from my lawyer, have you personally\nsomething to do with the extermination camps, why I suddenly distribute my guilt\non 80 million other German shoulders? And I just have finished a book from a\nGerman defense lawyer, and all the defense lawyers were sitting there, as he\nremembered, and saying, what is this Frank doing? At first he admitted his\npersonal guilt, and suddenly it\u2019s vanished about 80 million shoulders. So this was\nalso, the lead for the German people, how to react. We never acknowledged our\nguilt. We have built a lot of monuments, and we are a beautiful example for the\nother world, what we have done with our past, and how \u2014 how great we were in\nacknowledge \u2014 it\u2019s just the surface. The German people, still I am very much afraid\nof.",
        "A: They never acknowledged our crimes, never. It was just a\u2014 we have to do this\nbecause the world is looking for that the Germans have to do something. So we\nbuilt some monuments, and the German historians did a very good job. There is no\nGerman crime which was not thoroughly researched and written down. Everybody\ncan read it, but also, if you read it as a normal German, you will never acknowledge\nthis, really.\nJune 6, 2016",
        "A: Because the Germans have a lock \u2014 a lack \u2014 a lack of empathy. The Germans\ncan\u2019t put themselves in the soul, or in the situation, let\u2019s say, of a Jewish mother\nwho has two children, who is forced by German soldiers or German\n[indecipherable] police, into a cattle car, is driven through days and nights without\nany food or water, embracing the little childrens, and then thrown out of the cattle\ncar, to the ramp of Auschwitz, for instance, and then they took away the two\nchildren. They can\u2019t do this. And I am reading in schools or somewhere, I always\nsaid, have you ever tried to do this? Every German knows what really had\nhappened, what we have done. Have you ever put yourself in the situation like this?\nAnd they all went no. They don\u2019t do that, they can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s the special thing\nabout the Germans.",
        "A: Honestly.",
        "A: No, I\u2014 I live in \u2014 within my German people, I know them. Also, for instance,\nwas our chancellor, Mrs. Merkel did this open up for the refugees [indecipherable]",
        "A: Around the world they applauded her. So that, that\u2019s a great thing. And I also\nwas suddenly proud. But now, we do have about 600 \u2014 was last year about 600\ndifferent burning downs of homes for refugees. We have beaten up people, we have\neven killings. So, you have to see the German people like a dark, a dark ball. And\non this ball, let\u2019s say we are 80 millions are this ball. Out of this 80 millions, and I\nmake it very positively, let\u2019s say are 10 million Germans who are on this dark ball.\nThey are running around. They are really, true democrats. They are really looking\nthat we stay a democracy. But this ball is still very, very ignorant, and very, very\nagainst everything was \u2014 what is hurting them in their \u2014 yeah, in their bad\nconscious, I would say.",

        "A: Which I found out very late, because in my first book I write that it was after the\nverdict came out. So you can Say it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a mistake, which makes the truth\neven stronger. I was so sure that he will be hanged, I didn\u2019t need the verdict, yes? It\nwas before the \u2014 the judge handed out the verdict. I always thought it was\nafterwards, and then I found out no.",
        "A: Now I know exactly the date it wa \u2014 we were on the 17\" of September where we\nvisited him. And the verdicts came out on the first of October. The guilty and non-\nguilty was set on the 30\" of September.",

        "A: No.",
        "A: But the strange thing was when I was sitting together with Philippe Sands,\ninternational lawyer who made a film also about me. I was sitting in a cell, like the\nsame in which Hans Frank was \u2014 was sitting during the trial in Nuremberg. Not\nexactly the same measurement. But when my \u2014 when Colonel Andrews come \u2014\ncame with the \u2014 with the guards, to get him to the gallows. And the night was the\n16\" of October, 1946, they opened the door and my father was kneeling. And they\nhad to \u2014 Father O\u2019Connor accompanied Andrews and the guards. Said to him,\nFather, my mother used to give me the cross on my forehead before I went to school\nevery morning. Please do this, as well. And when I was telling this Philippe inside\nthe cell, I suddenly was very near to my father, and the first time I think I really had\nsome pity for him. Suddenly I understand that\u2019s the action of a ham actor. And\nsuddenly, in this cell, I got the idea maybe it wasn\u2019t an ham actors ar \u2014 kind of\nthing. But he has this terrible, terrible urging wish to be young again, to have notJune 6, 2016\ncommitted any crimes, and to be a innocent human being again. And at this\nmoment, I felt something of emotion for him, I would say.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",

        "A: My mother published the book of my father, it was at first published by a\npublishing company, but it was a total flop. And then she took over, founded her\nown publishing company, Eine Falak(ph), Brigitte Frank. And at first she\naddressed every Catholic priest. She printed the book \u2014 I will never forget it, for 4\nmark, 50 fennig, and sold it for about 19 marks, 50 fennig, and she never paid a\npenny of taxes. So, she made quite a fortune, I would say.

And she\nwrote, my little children, they are starving and so on. Please buy this copy, and you\nwill prolong our life. And so she did it, and the director of [indecipherable] for\ninstance, he immediately sent, as a gift, one car to us. So my mother immediately\nmade up a company for renting a car.",
        "A: Yes. She was really brilliant. And I \u2014 I really, as you can see, how I tell you this,\nI have a different approach to my mother, and I found out, which I\u2019ve never written,\nbecause my books were finished, I found a letter which I didn\u2019t really see before. In\nthis letter to a friend, she wrote, when I remember the times gone by, we really were\nmerciless. And that is, at least, a very honest acknowledgment also, what she has\ndone.",

The SS was completely integrated. Also this Mr.\nKruger was also sitting on the Wawel. So there were a lot of friendships in\nbetween, and sexual relationship with all the secretaries and so on.

Don\u2019t do this like your\nfather. Be strong. And it\u2019s not committing a crime, it\u2019s just a day in the \u201cStern\u201d\nmagazine, and all this kind of stuff. You can get yourself more \u2014 yeah, more civil\ncourage, and staying as a \u2014 as a democrat.",
        "A: To do it themselves, in their own family. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the only reason why I\ndid it. We have to talk about it. We have to talk inside the families.

And then I am always telling them,\nlook at your home, look at \u2014 ask your grandparents, and \u2014 if they are still alive, ask\nthem, what\u2019s really \u2014 what have you experienced, what were you \u2014 and \u2014 and if they\nare strong, they will say to you, my dear grandchild, I was such a coward. I knewJune 6, 2016\nexactly that mine Jewish neighbors were thrown away, and I have to confess, I took\na big, big wonderful painting out of this Jewish family. If this is, that would be\ngreat.

        "A: And I found out is that \u2014 is for me, really satisfying. Last time was \u2014 my wife,\nshe 1s not very keen to have telephone calls. And there was a man who was 65 years\nold. And I \u2014 he asked me three months before, gave me a call. Niklas Frank is a\nvery rare name, he-he found me in the telephone book, and told me, I am so\ndesperate. I know my father was this and that, but I can\u2019t find anything. He was re \u2014\nreally a simple man, I have to admit. And I told him what he has to do, writing to\nthis archive, and this archive, always giving the exact dates of his father, and so on.\nAnd then he did it, and unfortunately my wife was on the phone, I was abroad, and\nhe was so crazy to thank me, and that it was so wonderful. It\u2019s the first time I found\nout what this guy had done. It wasn\u2019t so \u2014 so really famous. But, he was so happy.\nThat was a \u2014 if I get this, it\u2019s really good.",

And if you look now to Germany, with the refugee problems, we are only a\ngood [indecipherable] democracy.

It doesn\u2019t interest me. I am a German, and I want\nto make sure that the Germans, we are like the Jews, we are a chosen people. Not\nthrough God, through our crimes. And we should know exactly how \u2014 how far it\ncan lead if you don\u2019t have civil courage. It leads my father to the gallows, and it\nleads a million of innocent people into the death.

And as a child especially, you immediately feel that\u2019s all a lie, that\u2019s not really\ntrue. And my brother Norman said, when Hitler was dead, he was looking for\nanother guide, and he found it in God. And myself, I was brought up very \u2014 in a\nvery Catholic way, because Schliersee, especially upper Bavaria was, at this time,\nvery Catholic.
