        "Question: Okay. Good morning. This is a United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum interview with Mr. Ernest Dutcher, Jr., on February 19, 2013, in\nEncino, California. Good morning Mr. Dutcher, and thank you for agreeing to\nspeak with us today.",
        "Answer: Good morning, and you\u2019re very welcome. [technical comments]",
        "Q: Mr. Dutcher, from what I understand, you were a liberator with U.S. forces of\nconcentration camps in Germany, and were a member of the military. So I\u2019m going\nto ask a lot of questions that leads up to those events in Dachau because we\u2019d like\nto know a little bit about your life and your military service prior to the liberation of\nthe concentration camps, and your role in helping survivors survive. So, Ill start at\nthe beginning.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Please tell us when you were born, where you were born and a little bit about\nyour family.",
        "A: I was born in May 16\" of 1920, and I was born in a s-small town in northern\nWisconsin called Antigo, and I lived with my parents on the farm. Our background\ninitially was all farming until about I reached the age of approximately 16. And I\nlived with my mother, my father and I have two sisters, both older, and I have \u2014 had\nFebruary 19, 2013\na brother about one and a half years younger than I, who also was involved in the\nwar, but never made it overseas, and I have a younger brother that was old enough\nto help out on the farm and so forth. And then I \u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me. Let me follow up on that a little bit. What kind of \u2014 what did you\ngrow on the farm?",
        "A: Oh, it was a very rocky farm. We grew basically potatoes and corn. Mainly\nthings for a family to eat and survive, because survival was the key item back in\nthose days, very, very poor conditions.",
        "Q: So did you sell any \u2014 did your family sell any of these 1tems?",
        "A: We sold a ce \u2014 a certain number, but there\u2019s not too much of a market, cause we\nwas quite a ways back in the so-called woods back there. And the farm was a very\nsmall one initially. We later moved to a much larger farm and we sold \u2014 we s \u2014 we\nsold maple \u2014 maple syrup, basically. We tapped the maple trees in the spring, and\nthen we had big pans that \u2014 within which we boiled for a 50 to one ration, we boiled\noff 49 percent of the liquid, which was water, and the residual was maple syrup.\nAnd \u2014",
        "Q: And 1s that why it\u2019s so expensive?",
        "A: It \u2014 well, that\u2019s only part of it. We took that raw maple syrup and ran it through \u2014\nwe \u2014 we mixed it with milk and the milk absorbed all the solids in it, and it came\nFebruary 19, 2013\nout beautifully clear, and \u2014 and it sold at that time for about several dollars a pint.\nAnd several dollars back then was a lot of money.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Your father and your mother, what were their names?",
        "A: My father\u2019s was Ernest E. Dutcher, Sr., my mother was \u2014 my mother\u2019s name\nwas \u2014 oh gosh, excuse me.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, take your time.",
        "A: Amanda Dutcher. And they were initially from Iowa, where they were brought\nup and educated. My mother was a s \u2014 was a schoolteacher down in Iowa, but she\nmoved up to northern Wisconsin and eventually become a \u2014 a correspondent for the\nsmall town, with the Rhinelander Daily News, which was our nearby large city,\nwhich 9,000 people.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: So I went to Rhinelander High School for two years, after which I \u2014 I become a\n\u2014I worked out in the woods, and when you say woods, it was a logging\nenvironment, and where I took care of a team of horses, I was 18, took care of a\nteam of horses about five miles off the main road and got snowed in sometimes.\nSometimes the weather become 40 to 45 below.",
        "Q: My gosh.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: And I had a cast iron stove that I chopped my own wood and kept warm with. It\nprobably was a luxury compared to what these camps went through. But anyway, I\nwas offered a job at Montgomery Ward and Company during the 19 \u2014 seven \u2014 I\nthink that 19 fo \u2014 1939, 1940, \u00b041, \u201942. 1942. And I\u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you would have been 22 years old?",
        "A: Yes, uh-huh. Yes, and then in \u2014 then we \u2014 I was also working on the \u2014 in the\nfurniture and radio department of Montgomery Ward. I loved radios and I didn\u2019t \u2014\nmy first radio that I ever heard was a little crystal set, and I had to share two \u2014 I had\nto share two earphones with anyone else lucky enough to listen to it, and we \u2014 we\nlistened to the radio on WLS Chicago, music and everything else on it. Very\nscratchy and everything, but very amazing. And then I moved on, tha-that was quite\na little earlier than my graduation. My graduation from Rhinelander high school,\nwith a \u2014 with a high school graduate degree, which was pretty good back in those\ndays. And then in showing off radios one day, I heard a big bulletin come over the\nradio, that Pearl Harbor had been bombed. And \u2014 and Roosevelt\u2019s speech I\u2019m \u2014\nsaying the \u2014 about the dastardly deed. And based on that, several of us in the \u2014 in\nthe [indecipherable] in the store, Montgomery Ward store, decided we\u2019d enlist.\nSo on the 30\" of December, we enlisted in \u2014 I \u2014 I wanted to be a pilot, and I just\nloved flying. So \u2014\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Can I interrupt just for a second?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I want to step back just a little bit to find out about your town. It was called\nRhineland(ph)? With no \u2014",
        "A: Rhinelander.",
        "Q: Rhinelander.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you say was 9,000 people there?",
        "A: 9,019 exactly.",
        "Q: 9,019.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And, well, if your mom was a correspondent from the newspaper, those are the\nsorts of facts that newspaper people know. Tell me, 1-1f you can, were they all pretty\nsimilar in background, all pretty similar in religion? Was there a predominant\nreligion?",
        "A: The predominant religion in the town was \u2014 most of them were like Lutheran\nand \u2014 and \u2014 a-and that. There were several Jewish families. One owned the\ndepartment store downtown, and \u2014 and \u2014\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: You knew what I was getting at. I wanted to find out whether or not there had\nbeen any Jews in the town, whether people knew them, whether you had gotten to\nknow anybody. That was \u2014",
        "A: I-I never did, except when we\u2019d go into the store for buying clothing and so\nforth. And that was the only ones we knew that \u2014 up there tha \u2014 at that time. So then\nfrom there, we went to Wausau, Wisconsin, which is a recruiting center and we all\nsigned up at that place. I had taken several years with the National Guard before\nthat, from the time I was 16, and on to time I enlisted.",
        "Q: Okay, I have another question.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You said that you always loved flying. You had been in an airplane before, or \u2014",
        "A: No, I just loved the thought of it, I \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014I\u2014I was really enamored with Lindberg and his \u2014 his antics and history, so\nforth. But I definitely wanted to be a pilot, so \u2014",
        "Q: So you had two passions, which you\u2019ve identified so far. One for radio, and one\nfor flying.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Okay. So let\u2019s ta-take us through then, the enlistment process, where you\nenlisted and what happened after that.",
        "A: Well, we enlisted in Wausau, Wisconsin, which is a much, much larger city, it\nmust have had at least 15,000 people in it. About 50 percent larger, I would say. But\nthat was the center of a lot of activities up there. And so we were taken down to \u2014 to\nnorthern Illinois, where they had a \u2014 a center for processing the \u2014 the troops and so\nforth, where we got all of our shots, and all of our \u2014 all of our warnings, an-and \u2014\nand early \u2014 early instruction. The fact I\u2019d been in National Guard though, made me\nkind of special, because I then was put in charge of small delegations that started\ntraining. From there we were shipped, after the initial equipping and issuing of\nclothing and blankets, and so forth, I was shipped to Jefferson barracks Missouri,\nwhich 1s adjacent to Saint Louis, Missouri. And Jefferson barracks was \u2014 it was\ncold, and middle of the \u2014 middle of the winter, virtually. And down there we were\nplaced in tents, and very, very cold. There we got all of our real tough shots. And\nthe shots made us so sick that we were afraid we wouldn\u2019t die. There, while I was at\nJefferson barracks, and that \u2014 we started our training there, I\u2019d \u2014 I did the drill\nsergeant role of taking the raw recruits and showing them how to march and how to\nturn and how to stop and the proper commands and all that. But then the newspaper\nheadlines come out; Roosevelt, we will be building 125,000 planes a year. It was\nFebruary 19, 2013\nbeyond belief, but anyway, it didn\u2019t make that much sense because during the time\nthat I had gone through medical \u2014 the medical exams, I got what is commonly\nknown as white coat fever. And the \u2014 and \u2014 and I got excited. I was so worried that\nI wouldn\u2019t pass, that I, of course, didn\u2019t, and my blood pressure went sky high\nduring the exams. Well, so, I wasn\u2019t apparently a good candidate, and probably\nwouldn\u2019t la-last too long.",
        "Q: For what?",
        "A: Well, poor health and all that part of it.",
        "Q: No, no, but what were you \u2014 was this to be accepted as \u2014 in \u2014 into the pilot\nprogram?",
        "A: That exactly right.",
        "Q: Okay, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. They had lesser than \u2014 other programs had lesser requirements, physically,\nso I had no problem with any physical and I had no problem with high blood\npressure at the time. I had no bla \u2014 trouble with eyesight, but when it \u2014 when we\nfinally got down to Jefferson barracks, I chose my second choice, which was radio.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Radio training took me to Scott Field, Illinois, just shrip \u2014 just across the river\nfrom our training at Jefferson barracks. And at Scott Field I went through the\nFebruary 19, 2013\ncourse of radio, which I just loved the course, cause I I-loved the idea so much.\nWhere I learned to \u2014 how a radio works, and I went \u2014 I was selected then to become\nan instructor, cause I had such enthusiasm for it. I instructed radio there until I got a\nwaiver on the two year requirement to join the \u2014 the radio \u2014 radio officers\u2019 program,\nand officers\u2019 cadet program. And I was sent to Yale University via \u2014 via Valley\nForge. And we spent some time at Valley Forge, again taking courses and so forth,\nleading up to the time that they accept us in Yale. And we march in \u2014 in \u2014 in and\nout the countryside [indecipherable] area. And I was \u2014",
        "Q: What year \u2014 excuse me again, I\u2019m interrupting, but what year was this when you\nwere accepted to go into Yale? How far in the 40s were we?",
        "A: We were, at that time, \u201942 probably.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u201942. Things happened so fast. \u201942 and then \u00b043. Yes, that \u2014 \u201942.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then I was a little bit \u2014 I also was, before I joined the National Guard, I was\na \u2014 played in a little band and I was a trumpeter in the band, played the coronet, and\nthe French horn and trombone and a few other things. And I was selected as the\nbugler. Now of course, every \u2014 Reveille was the mor \u2014 get them out of bed in the\nmorning.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: You must have been a popular guy.",
        "A: So, then we stayed at a beautiful mansion that we were allowed to use, we used\nthat for \u2014 marble staircases all. And then they had a \u2014 way up in the top was kind of\na little area where you could go up and look out over the terrain and there\u2019s where I\ntook \u2014 took all \u2014 care of all the bugling.",
        "Q: You had the space for it, huh?",
        "A: Yeah, and th-then \u2014 from there, I eventually went directly to ma \u2014 ru \u2014 to \u2014 went\ndirectly to New Haven, Connecticut where we were put up in the ya \u2014 Yale\ndormitories there. And we were immediately put on a program of radio, army radio\nand \u2014 and all communication, different types of communication such as teletype \u2014\nand at that time teletype was really coming into its own. And \u2014 and also, the sig \u2014\nsignal corps type of \u2014 of wire communications, telephones, laying wire \u2014",
        "Q: That must have been fascinating stuff.",
        "A: It\u2019s very \u2014 I was very f \u2014 in that th \u2014I was so thrilled with the course, that of\ncourse I paid more attention than the average person. And after a period there, I\nforget the exact number of months, but let\u2019s say during the time that I was there, we\nhad occasional nights we could go out. And I loved ice skating. Coming from\nnorthern Wisconsin, I was pretty good at it. So I did figure skating, so I went to the\nice rink in New Haven. And there I saw a young girl skating around in a short skirt\nFebruary 19, 2013\nand I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her. But I only ha-had a problem, I only had 50\ncents with me, because we hadn\u2019t been paid for weeks. So anyway, she eventually\ncame up and she had had her clothes in the same balcony seat that I had. And we\ngot acquainted and so I took her down and I blew the 50 cents on a Coke for her\nand her sister, who was along. And I was so fascinated with her that she came to my\ngraduation \u2014 we knew each other at least two weeks by that time. Came to my\ngraduation, and after graduating we went down and got all our new army uniforms,\nthey were so beautiful, long overcoat, and we just couldn\u2019t get over how great we\nlooked. Then we were, shortly thereafter, shipped to Boca Raton, Florida, because\nmy graduation score was 98.2, and the top \u2014 the top five of the gr \u2014 of the grade was\nsent to Boca Raton for radar training.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And \u2014 and then the radar \u2014 we arrived in Boca Raton, Florida. When I say we,\nthe gentleman that become the 89\" radar officer was a buddy of mine that we stuck\nkind of together. And so we landed at the train station in our heavy bu \u2014 beaver\novercoats, then we had the wool, green, then we had the pink [indecipherable]\ntrousers. But we wouldn\u2019t take them off, cause we just \u2014",
        "Q: Cause you looked so good.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 we looked so good and we just couldn\u2019t take them off. But that\u2019s some of the\nthings I remember, and \u2014 and then we went through a very, very grueling course on\nradio \u2014 radar. And radar was so new that information was coming from a mass \u2014 the\nMIT labs, where they invented s-some of the aspects, including the \u2014 a very\npowerful tube that could generate enormously strong pulses. Well, we then took it ri\n\u2014 almost from the design desk and we went through school, and learn \u2014 learning\nhow it worked and everything. And you may have seen the underbelly of some of\nthe planes that had a bubble under it. This was an antenna housing that the\npathfinder aircraft used eventually. So we didn\u2019t know a thing about what the \u2014 we\nwere doing. We were learning it and it wasn\u2019t important that we knew the whole\nstory. So anyway, after being down there about three weeks, I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t get over\nthe idea of the little girl I met. So I\u2014I wrote a letter up to her mother, and says, I\u2019d\nlove to have her come down, cause she is the one I want to spend my life with. So\nanyway, the father sent his approval down, along with his daughter. And we \u2014 we \u2014\nwe met and I had a little apartment all picked out and \u2014 and so we lived off base\nactually, but right away the big job was to get married, cause that was a time that\nyou never lived together. I mean, there was no \u2014 no way that could happen. So \u2014",
        "Q: And she had some say in this?",
        "A: Well yes, she had \u2014 she \u2014 she loved the idea, I guess.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what she saw in me, but anyway, I think she liked the idea, I was a\npretty good figure skater. I could \u2014 I could skate circles and so forth, you know, and\nbackward flips and stuff. So anyway, she came on down and so we found that we\nhad to have the mother\u2019s signature as well as the father\u2019s signature on approval.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So we immediately forged that, and \u2014 and we went down. She knew how, you\nknow, pretty well how to write. So we went down to Miami and went to the Justice\nof the Peace down there, and \u2014 and \u2014 for the ceremony. And she so happened to be\ncross-eyed, so the thing I do remember, that we were married by a cross-eyed\nJustice of the Peace, and a \u2014 and April the fifth of 1943.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And we just celebrated our 70\" wedding anniversary. So \u2014",
        "Q: Well, congratulations. Congratulations. What\u2019s your wife\u2019s name?",
        "A: Beatrice.",
        "Q: Beatrice.",
        "A: Beatrice. Beatrice Jane.",
        "Q: And while we\u2019re on this topic, how \u2014 do you have children?\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: Yes, I have a son, who went with me to the museum yesterday, and then \u2014 and a\ngrandson. And this \u2014 my son was my last, my youngest. He lives in West Hills with\nhis \u2014 my grandson. And then I have a little older brother \u2014 his older brother was\nErnest E. the third, who eventually didn\u2019t like that term the third, and changed his\nname to Ernie van Dytchen(ph). He was a relative of mine was \u2014",
        "Q: Are you from Dutch background?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Are you Dutch background?",
        "A: We\u2019re Dutch, Swiss, I think a little mixture of everything.",
        "Q: America.",
        "A: American, yeah. So anyway, then I have a daughter, and she was the a-apple of\nmy eye, Beverly. And she just gorgeous. She grew up in th \u2014 she \u2014 when I say she,\nmy wife and her family were Catholic. And I surrendered to the fact that even\nthough I was Mormon \u2014 you asked that earlier, and I forgot to tell you.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: I was brought up in the Mormon faith, but not a good \u2014 not a good follower, I\nwas arebel. And so I kind of abandoned the church and \u2014 when I was 20. And I\ndecided that yes, Ill allow her to bring up the children Catholic. So that\u2019s a story\nthere.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But Beverly went to Catholic school \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 eventually went to Catholic University in \u2014 in Denver, Colorado. And \u2014 and\nthere she become a \u2014 a nurse. And during that time she joined a \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 the motion\npicture side of it. She acted in a play with some \u2014 some professionals in \u201cThe\nSound of Music\u201d and oh, that made it \u2014 that made the day for me.",
        "Q: I can imagine. I ca \u2014",
        "A: So, let\u2019s see, from then \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, so we went down \u2014",
        "A: Oh, she become a nurse, and eventually spent 30 years with the University of\nColorado Medical Center.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Now, we\u2019ll go on fr \u2014 wherever you want me to start.",
        "Q: Okay, I\u2019m sorry, I got you off on a tangent here.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But you were in \u2014 you were in Florida and you had just married, with a forged\nsignature.",
        "A: Yes.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Totally illegal.",
        "Q: Yeah. And \u2014 and you were going to be learning a lot more about radar that was\ncoming from the MIT lab. So let\u2019s go back to your military side \u2014 this military side\nof your life.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well there we, again, we were graded based on our grades and our\naccomplishments there. And I had a s \u2014 handicap, cause I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know too much\nabout math and that was all math at the time, so \u2014 but I did have a fellow student\nthat was a\u2014 a math major, so he \u2014 he brought me along in the evenings and so forth,\nand we spent a lot of time, you know, bringing me up on that. And then \u2014 then we\nwent through learning all about these \u2014 this new device out of MIT, the \u2014 the new\nradars, t \u2014 absolutely, totally top secret. And then we were \u2014 actually went out on\nanother piece of radar, flying off the coast and finding submarines out of the water\nwith this particular anti-submarine device, which I never was involved with using\nlater. So then from my graduation there with a satisfactory rating, I was then\nassigned to a \u2014 of all things, a shooting range, while we waiting for our assignment\nto various squadrons that were being formed. In the range, I-I directed people in the\nFebruary 19, 2013\nproper stance, the proper position, using the Colt 45, the Thompson submachine\ngun and the \u2014 and the little 30 caliber carbine used by the paratroopers, and the M-1\nrifle that was used by the tr \u2014 by the liberators, these people that came in to save the\ncamps. So we \u2014 I \u2014I became expert on \u2014 on the se \u2014 Thompson submachine gun\nand the Colt 45 and sharpshooter on all the rest, just from my experience there.\nThen I was transferred up to \u2014 to Fort Wayne, Indiana, where our group was being\nreally put together, assigned to certain squadrons up there. Eventually then, we went\nto Sedalia, Missouri for real s \u2014 flight training. We actually took our places as\ndoing our thing, each of us doing our own thing, not knowing too much about what\neveryone else needed to do. We were being trained to be experts in what we were \u2014\nour education took us, you know. So that\u2019s the secret.",
        "Q: What does that \u2014 excuse me, I have to interrupt you. What does that mean? Did\nyou know what your eventual job was going to be?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what was that?",
        "A: Radar. Radar officer.",
        "Q: And so that means, for a layperson like myself, as a radar \u2014 what does a radar\nofficer do? What does \u2014\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: A radar officer was in charge of m-maybe 25 to 50 men. They were also trained\nin the same thing, but they weren\u2019t officers.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we were the teachers, we \u2014 we had to teach them all about the things that\nwe had learned about radar and so forth and they also went to school, but not as\ndetailed as we went. So then \u2014 and each squadron was the same, so then our other\njobs were constantly trying to figure a way of improving this radar and re \u2014 and\ncommunications that we had.",
        "Q: The technology that existed at the time.",
        "A: Yes, and it was evolving, and so it wasn\u2019t perfect.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So anyway \u2014 and it just goes a step further, one squadron \u2014 the thing was\nrepeated in four different squadrons that made up a group.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The group I g \u2014 that I was with was the 438\", troop carrier group, become very\nfamous, cause we spearheaded the invasion of Europe.",
        "Q: You mean Normandy?",
        "A: Yes, we were first into Normandy.",
        "Q: Wow.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: The \u2014 but, getting back to the organization \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: \u2014 a four \u2014 a four squadron group, the squadron had 13 airplanes that were flying,\nseveral more for reserves. So each squadron had 13 airplanes, the group had 13\ntimes four.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: All right? Now the group, four s \u2014 four groups formed a \u2014 a \u2014 they formed the\nnext division \u2014 it escapes me for a second. Anyway, there was \u2014",
        "Q: The next part of the structure.",
        "A: The next part of the structure up.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then there was 50 \u2014 wing, it was a wing.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We were the 53 troop carrier wing, and that consisted of a lot of groups. I \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know yet, I di \u2014 I was trying to get the statistics before the meeting here, but I\ncouldn\u2019t find them.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But anyway, then a number of these wings consisted of the ninth troop carrier\ncommand. And that\u2019s the big thing I want to come out of what we\u2019re saying here,\nFebruary 19, 2013\nbecause the ninth troop carrier command had more effect on the liberation, because\nof the fact they shortened the war by so much by what they did.",
        "Q: In wha \u2014 okay.",
        "A: And I\u2019|l describe that later.",
        "Q: Okay, okay, fine. So I want to get back to though, something. You\u2019re a radar\nofficer?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re in charge of others who are radar experts?",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s their job? Was their job to use the radar to detect where there would\nbe emen \u2014 enemy submarines? Was that it?",
        "A: No, we had nothing to do with submarines.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Everything was flying now.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Everything was air. Their job was to \u2014 to keep the radar gear in the planes in top\nworking order.",
        "Q: Okay.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: You know, y \u2014 anything made by man is going to break down, it\u2019s like \u2014 we\nwere like a Ford garage, or you know, and we took care of the defects that showed\nup. And then every day they had to go out under my supervision and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nflight test every plane before they took off.",
        "Q: Got it.",
        "A: As to \u2014 to maximize the \u2014 or minimize the chance of anything going wrong, and\nruining and possibly losing a lot of lives because of that.",
        "Q: So, 1-1f I can summarize, but I'd like to know whether or not my summary is\naccurate, is that in many ways your role in this structure was an educational role as\nwell as a maintenance role, to make sure that you understood the equipment, and to\nmake sure that the guys who were under your command understood how to\nmaintain that equipment.",
        "A: Exactly, you got it right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: An additional job of mine was to \u2014 because I was inventive and I wa \u2014 I\u2019ve been\ninventive from the time I was a young boy, 12 years old, I \u2014 I really developed a\nsystem where a very close friend and pilot of mine, Lieutenant Wilmer(ph)\nKline(ph) was in an airplane with a \u2014 in the left seat, flying with a blanked out\nwindshield, he couldn\u2019t see out.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then we had a-another pilot that could see out. We started \u2014 we started\ntrying to find a way of landing a plane blind, cause the weather was so terrible over\nthere, th \u2014 I mean, it was an unusual day, maybe one day a week that the sun came\nout. And that\u2019s why the \u2014 the st \u2014 the invasion of Europe was delayed, the weather\nwas so bad. So anyway, I invented a system where we could, actually made,\nactually 12 blind landings utilizing that system. And it\u2019s \u2014 I have a complete write-\nup on it, so \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 you'll be able to \u2014 you already have it, I think.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But anyway, that system got kind of spread ar \u2014 I didn\u2019t know all this until just\nin the last couple years. The system was memorialized on a daily record or monthly\nrecord, summarized monthly. We had to write what we had done during the month\nin a sort of a re \u2014a permanent record form \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: \u2014 and they were classified as secret. Anyway, that information started to get out\nto the group. We were only a squadron, one-fourth of the group.",
        "Q: Right.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: Then, through my friend and so forth, he witnessed \u2014 we shared the radar\nbuilding, and he witnessed what was happening and he started to follow what I was\ndoing in \u2014 in ni\u2014 in the 88\" squadron. Eventually it went through, then it went to\nthe wing, then the wing ordered all planes to be \u2014 all pilots to be trained in utilizing\nthat particular system, because it used equipment already in the plane. It used\nnothing except equipment already in the plane.",
        "Q: So it was based on what you had learned about the technology?",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: And \u2014 you must have been quite proud.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: You must have been quite proud that they adopted the system.",
        "A: I did \u2014I didn\u2019t think of anything different. I-I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know anything \u2014 I was a\n22 year old at that time, and I was concentrating on what we were doing, and I \u2014 I\nnever thought that there was any major accomplishment to it. I didn\u2019t know that\nuntil just the last couple of years. But anyway, then Wing decided to call the\ngeneral of the Ninth Air Force. The Ninth Air Force controlled 1,000 of these\nairplanes, these C-47 airplanes, the most wonderful airplane ever built. And 1-1t \u2014 I-I\n\u2014 everyone should learn about the C-47 aircraft, a dece \u2014 Douglas DC-3 was the\nforerunner of it, and it could do anything. But anyway \u2014\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 we didn\u2019t \u2014 I was concentrating on the job, and not much \u2014",
        "Q: Can I ask about \u2014 we\u2019re in Missouri. From what I understand in your story, as\nfar as getting to Europe, you\u2019re still in Missouri, correct? Training some of these\noth \u2014 now a radar officer \u2014",
        "A: At that time \u2014 no, no, all that was done overseas. A hundred percent of that was\ndone overseas.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. So tell me how \u2014 at what point did your training end, and you got\nshipped out to Europe?",
        "A: It was \u2014 we did a lot of flying, flight training. And believe it or not, we were not\nallowed on a test, on a final test we had to take, the pilots were not allowed to fly\nthese airplanes higher than five feet over the highest obstacle.",
        "Q: Oh my gosh.",
        "A: Five feet, not 500, not 5,000. Five feet. And so, we were flying this high over the\nground where it\u2019s level. And so we had to pull up to get over a fence. And the\nchickens were flying, and \u2014",
        "Q: Chickens weren\u2019t happy.",
        "A: They weren\u2019t happy at all, neither were the cows. So, anyway, that \u2014 I gave you\nsome background on that, cause that\u2019s important.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So that took place on this side of the ocean, but most of the training of the pilots\nand navigators, radio operators, crew chiefs, took place in my kind of a conference\nroom that I had in addition to the shops and so forth of my office building that was\nright off the runway of our main airfield in Greenham Common, England.",
        "Q: I see. I see, when you were already over there. So I\u2019d like to establish the date of\nwhen you left \u2014 I mean, because up til now, from when we talk about when you\nenlisted in Wisconsin to now, it sounds like such an intensive \u2014",
        "A: Oh, right. Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 training from the very basics, to something extraordinarily sophisticated.",
        "A: Oh it was, it was. It was very \u2014 when I think of it now, I was thinking of it this\nmorning, that entire thing, including the camps, everything happened in a \u2014 within a\nthree year period.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Of course, the camps went on way before that, but our reaction to it \u2014 to get \u2014",
        "Q: Well that pr \u2014",
        "A: Wi-wi-\u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm, sorry \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, ki \u2014 keep on going.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: It was only a three year window, and I \u2014 I \u2014I marvel at how we got so much\ndone in three years.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So anyway, we went overseas then, it had to be probably, oh, let me see, ground\n\u2014 air echelon went overseas by way of South America and across to Africa and\nthen eventually up to lame \u2014 England. They flew their planes over. The ground\nechelon which I was part of, went over by \u2014 by boat, under heavy armada of\ndestroyers and so forth, because a troop ship \u2014 they were sinking ships like crazy at\nthat time. Probably only half of the \u2014 of the material that was being shipped\noverseas got overseas because they \u2014",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: \u2014 were sunk by those U-boats. So that\u2019s \u2014 so we went over about \u2014 to answer\nyour question about the first part of to \u2014 of 1943 \u2014 three. No \u2014",
        "Q: 1940 \u2014",
        "A: 1940 \u2014 had to be in 1943. We were married in \u201943, so training ended. Probably\nthe latter part of 1943.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Because the invasion happens half a year later.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: Yes, you\u2019re right on.",
        "Q: In June \u201944.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: By that point \u2014 I know you, you know, from your story we get a sense of \u2014 of\nreal intensive focus on the work that you\u2019re doing, on the technology, on learning\neverything that you know about it. What about the wider political events that were\ngoing on at the time? Do you remember, do you hear, did you read newspapers\nabout how the war was progressing before the invasion? Did you hear anything\nabout what was happening to the Jews of Europe?",
        "A: We heard about it, but it wasn\u2019t concentrated like it should have been, and \u2014 and\nof course, like we discovered later. We \u2014 we knew we had to c \u2014 we had cut the\nhead off that monster.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We knew that, because they were very close to running the world. Had it not\nbeen for the power of our \u2014 our county\u2019s factories, and the \u2014 and the home front \u2014\nthey did a marvelous job. I give them so much credit for actually winning the war.\nBut the \u2014 the \u2014 unfortunately the word of the camps were treated more or less like\nFebruary 19, 2013\npropaganda. We \u2014 we couldn\u2019t believe anything like that could happen. It just was a\ncase of we were too naive to \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a case we were ins \u2014 insin \u2014 insincere, it\nwas a case we just didn\u2019t know any better. And of course, being 20 years old, you\ndon\u2019t get buried in politics anyway. So \u2014",
        "Q: No, no.",
        "A: So that was the \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m just trying \u2014 you see, the reason why I asked this question is I\u2019m trying to\nget an \u2014 a sense of the context of the time, the mood of the time, the level of\nknowledge of the time. You know, what had priority and what had less priority, and\nhow much did people know and \u2014 and what they were aware of. Which I think\nyou\u2019ve addressed, you know.",
        "A: Yeah. It \u2014 they only knew what the army \u2014 what the top peop \u2014 top generals and\nso forth, wanted them to know. They wanted their morale to stay up and they didn\u2019t\nwant to be discouraged in \u2014 in the United States, because they were doing such a\nmarvelous job of reaching that goal of Roosevelt\u2019s of 120,000 planes a year.\nCouldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t be done, but it did, it happened. And so al \u2014 they only fed them\ninformation that was relatively good, and that\u2019s one reason \u2014 one of the primary\nreasons, I believe, they didn\u2019t want too much bad news to get out, where we had | \u2014\nmade \u2014 we lost a battle, or where we made a mistake, or something like the mistake\nFebruary 19, 2013\nthat was made where all of those British paratroopers d-died because a bad mistake\nin judgment by the superiors, and \u2014",
        "Q: We can perhaps come to that \u2014 come to that point when \u2014 in your narrative I\nremember \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 it\u2019s something that you wrote about.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you hear then, about the bow \u2014 Battle of Stalingrad, which was in 1943?",
        "A: Yes, we heard about that and of course all we heard was the good part of it, you\nknow. We didn\u2019t hear \u2014 although we knew \u2014 we knew that Stalin was brutal, we\nknew that. We knew the Russians were probably not \u2014 you know, following that\ncourse, was not the nicest people on earth. So, I\u2014 we \u2014 we followed that Battle of\nStalingrad cause we were so delighted over the fact that the Germans were losing.\nAnd so that was good news to come across.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: But the news of all the people that was lost at our air base during a short period\nof time, that didn\u2019t get back to the public. No one knew about that.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s talk about that a little bit. Was this in England?",
        "A: It was in England.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Okay, so tell us the story in a \u2014 in \u2014 yeah, tell us the story, tell us what happened\nwith such losses?",
        "A: Well, the worst things Pll \u2014 Pll tell you about. The \u2014 there was \u2014 there was a\ntremendous concentration of aircraft bombing the coast and bombing inland and so\nforth. Planes were flying overhead all the time, going back and forth, a constant\ndrone, you couldn\u2019t sleep. I mean, around the clock. The two C-47s, cause of the\nweather, bad weather, two 40 se \u2014 C-40 \u2014 not C-47s, but two B-17s, bombers,\ncollided right \u2014 almost directly over our base.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And the debris scattered over a very large area. And hearing the \u2014 I was one of\nthe few people that heard the crash. It was a tremendous explosion, and \u2014 and so\npieces of everything, engines and bodies and stuff were coming down all over the\narea. I was one of the very first on the scene, because I onl \u2014 my off \u2014 radar building\nwas only a short distance away. I had a Jeep that I had assigned to me. I jumped in\nthe Jeep and drove over to the \u2014 where I knew the sound had come from, and then I\nstarted to see that debris all over. And the first sight I saw of a body was a young\nnavigator. The navigator \u2014 I knew he was a navigator because the body was quite\nintact, and it was lying on his back. And he was partially buried because the force of\ndropping to the ground. And he \u2014 his \u2014 he was a little \u2014 little gray looking and so\nFebruary 19, 2013\nforth. But he looked like he was sleeping, like peacefully sleeping. But his ta \u2014 his\nwatch was still running, that\u2019s [indecipherable] a strange thing. And then, little\nbeyond I saw a body that was decapitated from hitting \u2014 from going through a tree\nbranch. And \u2014 and \u2014 and then \u2014 then a lot of the pe \u2014 lot of the people from the base\nstarted to come over and we all were scattered through to see if there was any\nSUIVIVOTS.",
        "Q: Were there?",
        "A: Yes, there was a pilot, I think, one pilot, or maybe th \u2014 I can\u2019t recall now for\nsure, but I think at least one pilot survived. And the pilot that didn\u2019t survive, I \u2014\nI\u2019ve, in the last couple years I got \u2014 I\u2019ve got to know who \u2014 who \u2014 who their\nrelatives were and they\u2019ve written to me and so forth. They found out through\nanother \u2014 I had another interview with the BBC, and somehow or other that got out\nand they \u2014 they got ahold of me, and it was kind of \u2014 kind of sad.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But \u2014 but anyway, from that, that was number one. Number two 1s the \u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: How mu \u2014 do you know how many people died in that \u2014 1n that collision?\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: Yes, 20 \u2014 as I recall, there was 22. Because I got a figure of 51 in my mind that\ncombined the two crashes that happened the same week.",
        "Q: And was this because of the intensity and the frequency and just the sheer\nnumber of bombing missions that were taking place, that they were \u2014 there were\njust too many in the sky?",
        "A: Well, military aircraft usually flew in formation, and the formation consisted of,\nlet\u2019s say \u2014 our formations consisted of 13 airplanes, but th-that means they weren\u2019t\ntoo far apart. And the weather was so bad that they cou \u2014 you couldn\u2019t see. In other\nwords, you just lost the sight, and somehow or other, two planes brushed together\nand \u2014 and caused an explosion.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that scattered them all over, you know, so then I give you an \u2014 a article\nabout Bob Owens, the \u2014 our engineering officer that was \u2014 was big 1n all of our \u2014\nour missions and so forth, so he \u2014 well, I'll follow that later.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Or no, he \u2014 IJ-I\u2019ll pick that up now, because the Horsa glider was a British made,\nall wood, but a very large aircraft. Instead of carrying only 15 paratroopers, they\ncould carry 30.",
        "Q: Okay.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: Well, they had 29 in that, plus two pilots. And \u2014",
        "Q: So that made 31.",
        "A: That makes a total of 31. The 31 plus the 22 made the 53 that sticks in my mind\nas far as the loss. Anyway, the \u2014 he had told them, he had \u2014 they \u2014 they sent the\naircraft in and he wa \u2014 he noted in inspection of the aircraft that there was about a\nthree inch space between the tail mounting and the fuselage, where it\u2019s supposed to\nbe tight. The glue had \u2014 this was all glued together, it\u2019s a wood aircraft. Like this,\nglue had separated and he issued what they called a red tag. And every one of the\nHorsa gliders on the base was red tagged. But Wing, next step up, decided that they\nhad to have a practice run of a troop car \u2014 of 647 aircraft pulling a s \u2014 the c \u2014 this\ndigger glider. And so they assigned two 88\" pilots, glider pilots to the task.",
        "Q: Can I interrupt just for a second?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I just want to ma \u2014 establish that the manufacturer of the gliders was British.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: But they had sold them to the Americans and this was now an American military\noperation.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: It was part of our \u2014 our assigned \u2014 we didn\u2019t pay any attention who \u2014 who\nfurnished it, but we had a certain amount of planes, certain number of gliders,\ncertain number of CG-4 gliders, which is the smaller \u2014",
        "Q: Got it.",
        "A: \u2014 certain \u2014 along with the others. They wanted a test to show the capability of the\nC-47 aircraft towing that fully loaded glider. This fully loaded glider would go\nokay, even with that tail problem. So they were able to fly the gliders into the\nairport, but he said that the minute you take off, it probably will not be more than\njust a few seconds and that tail is gonna separate. Well, just exactly like he forecast,\nthe \u2014 the tail broke off when the \u2014 when the tu \u2014 the [indecipherable] plane and the\nglider was probably about a hundred feet in the air. And course, then they drove\nstraight into a little knoll. I recall the plane had dove straight into that kno-knoll,\nand every single one of those occupants was in the fr \u2014",
        "Q: In the middle.",
        "A: \u2014 ina mass of flesh in the front \u2014",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: \u2014 of that glider. I wasn\u2019t there \u2014 I wasn\u2019t certainly the first there, but they had\nremoved the bodies and then I \u2014 hearing about the crash, I drove over to that also,\nwhich 1s in the same area, in the same debris field as the crash of the two B-17s.\nFebruary 19, 2013\nAnd the guard \u2014 there was a guard assigned to it by then, and he says, well there\nwas a \u2014 there\u2019s some \u2014 a human hip or something like a \u2014 a big roast \u2014",
        "Q: Oh gosh.",
        "A: \u2014 still there. They\u2019d removed all the human remains, but they\u2019d missed that. So\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s number 30 some. Anyway, but the thing that was so \u2014 so \u2014 so\nremarkable is seeing 13 ambulances, wi \u2014 each with four bodies of people that were\nhighly trained, moving off the field toward the cemetery.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And that was imp \u2014 very impressive, I mean, in their own sort of way. Those are\nthings that were not relayed to the American public.",
        "Q: Were they co \u2014 were they considered secret, top secret? Could you speak about\nthem to your relatives, to your wife?",
        "A: Oh, we couldn\u2019t speak about anything, no, they \u2014 they took every one of our\nletters, and when they \u2014 when the relatives got them, there was a lot of black mark,\ncause they took out a lot of information, you could not mention anything.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Highly, highly \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they edited everything that went out.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Must have been that those, you know, that \u2014 that you and others on the ground,\nwhen you saw the price of somebody\u2019s decision, the mistake, it \u2014 I mean, the anger\nat the \u2014 at the price that was paid.",
        "A: Well, one step further, the man that tried to stop it, Bob Owens was on his way\nto a court martial, because he had ignored an order to allow the 88\" pilots or planes\nto fly. The unfortunate thing is, they chose two fi\u2014 pilots from the 89\" squadron,\nand a plane from the 89\" squadron. There\u2019s now a memorial there to that particular\nthing that the prince \u2014 Princess Margaret was there at the dedication of it. But they\ngot it a little wrong, I\u2019m afraid they \u2014 they sh \u2014 I think they showed 88\" pilots still\non that marker, but it was only \u2014 it was actually 89\".",
        "Q: Remind us again what part of England did this all occur?",
        "A: It \u20141t \u2014 it \u2014 1t\u2014 1t was in southern England, and Greenham Common was close\nto a town called Salisbury, and then that was a short distance towards London was\n\u2014 we were west of London about \u2014 probably about a hundred miles. There was\nSalisbury, Reading, and then London. The other way was a Salisbury Plain,\nwhere the big \u2014 that big prehistoric monument stood, you know?",
        "Q: Stonehenge.",
        "A: Stonehenge.",
        "Q: Stonehenge.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: These are little details you forget. Anyway \u2014",
        "Q: Well, I\u2019m amazed by how many details you remember, I really am. It\u2019s a lot.",
        "A: Well, you know, the whole picture never came to me. Each one of these were\nseparate little things, and I wrote about it a step at a time. I was going to use each\none of these little things as a separate chapter in my book that I was writing \u2014 I was\ngoing to write. But lack of time and the fact that I\u2019m still working, I\u2019m still o-own\nmy own business, I never got to write the book, but I didn\u2019t want these details to be\nlost, and so \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 it was just \u2014 back in those days it was just me doing one job and nothing big\nabout it, nothing. Nothing unusual about it, that\u2019s what I was supposed to do.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But then when I look at the whole picture, the ninth troop carrier order\n[indecipherable] 1,000 planes, ordered, that the entire group of 1,000 planes be eq-\nequipped, or be given the information, taught the information, I also came up with a\n\u2014 an idea to extend the range where they \u2014 you could see the signal from farther out\nwhen they\u2019re coming back, to try to find the airfield in bad weather. I was able to\nextend that by so-called piquing of the frequencies. I don\u2019t know now how I did it,\nbut I did it back then. There \u2014 there were several things that the \u2014 right up to\nFebruary 19, 2013\nGeneral Williams, who came to the base, and w \u2014 and \u2014 and interviewed everyone\nand so forth, and tried to figure out what all this fuss was about. They \u2014 he then\nordered the entire \u2014 now comes the British \u2014 I don\u2019t recall I \u2014 but it\u2019s British\nEngineering Association that was very big, and they did design a lot of beautiful\nequipment, so forth. But they kind of took credit for the fact that this \u2014 these things\nhappened, and they ordered the RAF and every \u2014 every part of their fleet to be\nusing the same equipment. And so it\u2019s just recently that I could see the whole\npicture and had an interest in seeing the whole picture, that I finally decided that\nthis was a lot more than I had ever given credit for, that every plane that flew in the\nETO, European theater of operation at that time, u-utilized these advancements.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Well then, because of that, the C-40s \u2014 the 438s performed flawlessly in the\ninvasion of Normandy. They lost no planes, they missed no targets, and the radio \u2014\nthe radar on all their planes worked perfectly, and they can \u2014 come back and\neventually got the only st \u2014 unit citation ever received by a troop carrier group.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And groups were very \u2014 kind of tiny, there\u2019s dozens and dozens of groups, so we\n\u2014 we were kind of singled out for that. Based on that, I finally realized that what I\nhad done probably helped a lot to our getting that citation.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Congratulations.",
        "A: So I had to give myself some credit later.",
        "Q: Well, congratulations.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: Congratulations.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: I\u2019m also impressed that it sounds like innovation was something that was\nallowed.",
        "A: Oh, defin \u2014",
        "Q: Innovation was something that was encouraged within the structure.",
        "A: Encourage \u2014 oh, I got to give the upper level a lot of credit. Anything they saw\nthat would improve the chances of a man getting back, and his aircraft and his crew\ngetting back safely, was encouraged and certainly adopted, if it worked. And later\nthey \u2014 I lost my train of thought for a moment.",
        "Q: Something about \u2014 about the \u2014 the innovation being encouraged.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 well, I wou \u2014 I would \u2014 I was trying to think of a\ncertain instance where it was very, very easily \u2014 oh, th-th-the \u2014 this outcome was, of\ncourse, of course, the outcome was that probably untold number of lives were saved\nby pilots that could find their way back and didn\u2019t \u2014 di-didn\u2019t have to ditch, or\nFebruary 19, 2013\ndidn\u2019t have to crash land or \u2014 or something like that. So then I told myself, you\nknow, I never killed anyone. I never had to shoot someone, that\u2019s terrible, that\u2019s\nhard to live with. I never done anything, but I believe that I\u2019ve saved lots of lives.\nAnd that \u2014 since that time I\u2019ve had no ma \u2014 nightmares, I\u2019ve slept very soundly. I\nhave no regrets for anything \u2014 any judgment I made or anything. So that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: There\u2019s peace. There\u2019s peace 1n that.",
        "A: Peace. That\u2019s exactly right.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go forward.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: We need to \u2014 we need to find out how it is that you come in contact with what\nwe \u2014 what people realized later was the Holocaust, and the genocide against\nEurope\u2019s Jews.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Tell us \u2014 so, were you part of the invasion of Normandy or were you staying in\nEngland while the \u2014",
        "A: On \u2014 on that particular mission, I stayed in England, but on the Bridge Too Far\nmission, or Operation Market Basket \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 which was a big mistake. Operation mark \u2014 Market Basket, I went along with\nmy friend that was [indecipherable] landing pilot, I went along with him because\nthe CEO thought it\u2019d be nice to have more than one navigator in the squadron, in\ncase the first plane got shot down. So he asked if I\u2019d go along as a wing navigator.",
        "Q: And Operation Market Basket was what?",
        "A: It was where they tried to save all these bridges. A Bridge Too Far is probably\nmore im \u2014 memorable.",
        "Q: But the bridges in where, what part of Europe?",
        "A: It\u2019s on the Rhine river, where they tried to \u2014 want to shorten the war by saving\nthe bridges so they didn\u2019t have to rebuild bridges across the Rhine.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And that particular mission was to preserve those bridges, that \u2014 and so that the\ntanks, Patton\u2019s tanks, when they got there, couldn\u2019t blast across without having to\nbuild pontoon bridges.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He was moving very fast, and we were terribly important in the fact that he was\nable to move so fast because a C-47 carried paratroopers into areas of drop. Then,\non the way back, they \u2014 they came back and picked up the gliders and they threw it\n\u2014 flew them in. Then they came back and they flew into \u2014 like I took a mission into\nFebruary 19, 2013\n\u2014 on D-Day plus six, we flew into Omaha Beach, and we flew into a\u2014a-\u2014a\nlanding strip that had been cut hastily in the bluffs above Omaha Beach. And we\nlanded there with flight nurses aboard, and picked up the terribly wounded \u2014 most\nterribly wounded of Omaha Beach, and we just had a constant stream of airplanes\nflying in and out, and bringing those people back to hospitals in England. And\nwhile I was there, I stepped out of the airplane, trying to help with the loading of the\n\u2014 of the litter patients and so forth. And a captain on the ground, in the infantry\nyelled at me, get back in that airplane, because you s \u2014 have greens on. The green \u2014\nI didn\u2019t have the camouflage on, and he says, there\u2019s snipers in the area. So, of\ncourse, I was forced back into the airplane then. But that \u2014 I\u2019m telling that because\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the C-47 done so many other things. On [indecipherable] rush across,\nhe outrun all of his tankers. He\u2019d run out of gas and then couldn\u2019t go any further.\nThen we started loading up 6,000 pounds of gasoline on each airplane and flew a\nconstant stream of these airplanes and flew a constant stream of these airplanes\nright behind Patton\u2019s army as he raced across Europe. We\u2019d land in \u2014 in pastures,\nwe'd land on roads. And this \u2014 these planes were so powerful, they could pull\nthemselves out of mud.",
        "Q: Wow.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: So they flew supplies, gasoline supplies and then loaded the medical patients,\nhad litters that come down from the side on inside, they loaded the litter patients up\nand got out of there, and back to hospitals in England, you know. I\u2019m trying to say\nthat the airplane itself was such a big story, what it could do. And \u2014 and then,\nnaturally, it was a natural carrier, so thousands and thousands and thousands of\ndisplaced people and survivors of the camps and survivors of the \u2014 of the slave\nlabor camps, very close together, they \u2014 in one \u2014 the area we went in, the slave\nlaborers and \u2014 and the ovens were right close by because they had to use the si \u2014\novens to dispose of the slave laborers that was too \u2014 too weak to work any more.\nAnd then they had the V-2 factory underground right there, you know.",
        "Q: So-",
        "A: And like the lady from the museum that said about a young girl, she was 16 and\n\u2014 and \u2014 and that\u2019s actually the people that we \u2014 that I was involved in helping get\nback into France and different areas.",
        "Q: Okay, so let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s go to that point.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You said you were in O-Operation Market Basket and that was \u2014 was that the\nright way of calling it?",
        "A: That was before.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: That was before.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That was to try and save the bridges.",
        "A: Yes, uh-huh.",
        "Q: And did you \u2014 did the \u2014",
        "A: No, it was a total failure, and that total failure, Montgomery talked General\nEisenhower into doing this, thinking it \u2014 it would s \u2014 cut time off the war, really it\n\u2014 it added a year to the war, because Patton\u2019s tanks didn\u2019t have the gas that we\nwere flying in. We had to fly to save bridges instead of flying the gasoline into\nPatton where he could keep going.",
        "Q: Got it.",
        "A: The war would have ended one year earlier, had it not been for that mistake.",
        "Q: So, when you\u2019re finally \u2014 the war does end, had you had any knowledge or\ncontact of what \u2014 what it is that \u2014 that you eventually saw, or was the \u2014 were these\nflights that took place \u2014 I\u2019m no \u2014 I\u2019m not phrasing this correctly. Let\u2019s go this way:\nwhat\u2019s the first time that you flew on these planes, the C-47s, where it had contact\nwith the survivors of the concentration camps, the survivors from slave labor\ncamps, and displaced persons. Set that up for us.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: It was in \u2014 it was June the se \u2014 around the f-first of June and the second part of\nMay of 1945.",
        "Q: So the war had ended?",
        "A: The war had ended by then, and we had lots of transport available and these \u2014\nthe need for getting those people out of there as fast as possible, was great. So \u2014",
        "Q: How did you kn \u2014 did you know who \u2014 what you were going to be meeting?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: At that point did you know \u2014 what is 1t \u2014 what did you know about the camps\nbefore you even got there?",
        "A: We knew we \u2014 by that time there was a lot of information out. And so \u2014 I mean,\nmonths and months earlier we knew about it. And \u2014 and that was, of course, one of\nthe great reasons that \u2014 and I\u2019m sure that it was on everyone\u2019s mind that if \u2014 if we\ndon\u2019t k \u2014 if we don\u2019t knock the head off that monster, that these people, there will\nbe nobody left. So we were aware of it, and we were very shocked by it. Of course,\nwe were very shocked by it, way before June.",
        "Q: Okay. And where did you take off from?",
        "A: We took off from Amiens, France. We had moved just right \u2014 just before that,\nwe\u2019d moved into Amiens, France in an old World War II battlefield. We had the\nold World War I\u2014 I\u2019m sorry, not two, one, World War I, correction. We had the\nFebruary 19, 2013\ntrenches from World War I all \u2014 all around us, virtually, and there was this level\npatch of ground that they laid down the airstrip, made of steel \u2014 interlocking steel\nsections. And we had to be careful, cause if we went off our general area of\noperations, there was unexploded ordinance around, and people were getting \u2014 still\ngetting killed from World War I armaments.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: And then the \u2014 the trenches were f \u2014 full of nice small birch trees, beautiful birch\ntrees, and I got some pictures that eventually the museum will get. And there\u2019s a\npicture of a 88\" and everything, made out of birch. Kind of a big entrance-like to\nour \u2014 our \u2014 our Amiens base. So that \u2014 that\u2019s where we took off from, and the idea\nwas to be closer to carrying troo \u2014 gasoline with the various tanks and so forth.\nPatton went so fast that the \u2014 his big express that they had designed to keep\ngasoline flowing to him, just couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t keep up, and he was being slowed\ndown, and they got together and just a day or two later they come up with the idea\nof flying them in by troop carrier and flying out the wounded.",
        "Q: Okay, so when you were taking off from Amiens, were y \u2014 did you take off with\ngas and came back with people?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it was primarily to go. We went there empty.",
        "Q: Okay.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: No, we probably carried supplies in. [indecipherable] I don\u2019t recall, we \u2014 I -- we\nalmost never flew empty.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we knew that that area was being liberated and so forth, so we knew the\nneed probably would be great. I\u2019m sure we took medical supplies at least, and\nthings of that sort in.",
        "Q: So, do you recall how long the flight was, when you landed, where you landed?",
        "A: We landed at Halle, Germany.",
        "Q: Halle, mm-hm.",
        "A: And I\u2014I-\u2014I\u2019m still not quite sure how far that was from the closest, I th \u2014",
        "Q: Well, Halle is in what was East Germany.",
        "A: East Germany.",
        "Q: East Germ \u2014 what became East Germany.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Buchenwald was in East Germany, and \u2014 what became East Germany, and\nDachau was near Munich, which was going to be in West Germany. So is \u2014",
        "A: This was quite a long flight.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was fairly long, because like, as I recall, and I was navigator on \u2014 on\nthat flight. As I recall, the time of take-off, and then coming back over the German-\nFrench border was quite long. So it had to be back in East Germany.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I\u2014I wa\u2014I knew nothing about geography in those days.",
        "Q: Okay. So when you landed, do you remember what you saw?",
        "A: Well, when we landed, all we saw was the very carefully selected survivors that\nwere strong enough for the flight. And they had been put \u2014 they had been organized\nby the 88\" of all things, anti-aircraft \u2014 AA, anti-aircraft something. It was a ground\nbased force that was real big 1n \u2014 in the liberation.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 and their story was told in one of the articles I\u2014 I gave you. But we met\nup with them there, and \u2014 and took their assignment. They knew how many we\ncould carry.",
        "Q: How many could you carry?",
        "A: Well, we could carry about 18 - 20 probably.",
        "Q: Per plane?",
        "A: Per plane.",
        "Q: Okay.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: And then my job 1s to be sure that going back from navigating and so forth,\nbeing sure that they \u2014 they were doing okay. They sit in long rows on each side of\nthe airplane.",
        "Q: So they were sitting up.",
        "A: They were sitting.",
        "Q: The people were sitting up.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: They people were sitting up.",
        "A: They were sitting, yes, they were sitting.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They had \u2014 some of them had sticks over their shoulder with little bandanas or\nsomething with their little worldly goods in them. Very, very pathetic.",
        "Q: And \u2014 yeah, tell me what it \u2014 what did they look like?",
        "A: They looked like skeletons. Even though they could walk and everything, they\nlooked like skeleton \u2014 miracle they would walk. Saying \u2014 some were worse, some\nwere better, but they were \u2014 their skin was kind of tallow looking and their eyes\nwere kind of hollow, their clothes were in tatters.",
        "Q: Were they wearing the striped \u2014",
        "A: No.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: By then they\u2019d changed into some other type of clothing, but it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it \u2014 it\nwasn\u2019t Brooks Brothers.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And these, a lot of these were French that we have on this \u2014 had on this\nparticular mission. And it was hard to tell, because they were mixed. Anyone\ncapable, they weren\u2019t any discrimination, anyone capable of being flown out of that\nhellhole, were \u2014 were as-assigned a spot on one of the tho \u2014 hundreds and hundreds\nof flights that came and left. Their \u2014",
        "Q: Could you tell who was a man and who was a woman\u2019?",
        "A: There \u2014 there were no women on our flight.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No women on our flight. They probably were seg-segregated, but our flights\nwere all men.",
        "Q: Were they \u2014 could you tell their ages, approximately?",
        "A: It was impossible to tell, really impo \u2014 they all look old.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But, imposs \u2014",
        "Q: How did \u2014 how did they walk?\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: They walked with \u2014 some with \u2014 with canes and \u2014 and some \u2014 we had to help\nsome of them in getting aboard the plane, cause there was a step down, kind of little\nladder that come up into the plane and so they had to be helped \u2014 most of them had\nto be helped into the plane. And then \u2014 then again, water and so forth, important\nthings that they needed, we supplied during the time. And candy bars, but we had to\nbe very careful, because they gave us orders not to feed them, because in feeding\nthem too rich a diet \u2014 they had to have a special diet \u2014 these are little details I can\nrecall \u2014 special diet, and then they were fed, instead of gallons of water at a time,\nyou know, just small amounts of water at a time and so forth. So \u2014 but it \u2014 it was\nvery pathetic, and the \u2014 and the most \u2014 the most memorable part of the trip is when\nI made the announcement \u2014 had to go back among them, made the announcement\nthat we were just crossing the French border of Germany. That\u2019s where I can\u2019t \u2014 to\nthis day I\u2014I can\u2019t talk about it. To this day I can\u2019t talk about it without breaking\ndown. The joy, seeing smiles on these ke \u2014 skeletons. When [indecipherable] give\nme a lot of thanks that I had never b \u2014 had not been on the other side of that fence.\nBut that\u2019s the \u2014 that\u2019s the main memory of that \u2014 that \u2014 we never flew any women\nto my knowledge that \u2014 you probably couldn\u2019t tell the difference between then\nanyway, but \u2014 but that was very difficult.",
        "Q: Did they say anything? Did they say anything?\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: No, they were \u2014 they could under \u2014 there \u2014 few of them could almost understand\nEnglish, and I didn\u2019t have to sign language anything that we were going to be\ncrossing over the German and French border. We were able to \u2014 course, we could\nhave been able to do it by sign language just in case there wasn\u2019t English speaking\nsurvivors there. But \u2014 but that \u2014 that \u2014 that was so powerful that it kind of blanked\nout some of the other memories I[ had of it.",
        "Q: Do you \u2014",
        "A: And \u2014 and we landed in Amiens in \u2014 in th \u2014 one of the flights that I recall, and \u2014\nand it was kind of interesting, there was also \u2014 German prisoners were stationed the\nsame place. And the German prisoners were doing pick up of cigarette butts and\nthey were doing all the maintenance around our camp and our tents and so forth.\nAnd so that was such a thing, the superpowers and then we were flying these people\nin that now a part of us, you know, that \u2014",
        "Q: Did they see them?",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure they saw them. But they were s \u2014 they were still in prisoner garb.",
        "Q: Did you recall anything about how they left the plane?",
        "A: Well, again, they had to be helped off, and \u2014 and I can just recall helping some\nof them off, and being sure they still had their belongings, and being sure they \u2014\nbeing sure they were strong enough to join \u2014 someone was there at the time, with\nFebruary 19, 2013\nambul \u2014 there were ambulances there. They were pulled up and the weaker ones\nwere taken off by American ambulance. Where they went from there, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Cause our \u2014 our job was to keep flying them back.",
        "Q: Did you do more of these trips?",
        "A: I did only two of them, and they were bo-both very similar, we come back to the\nsame place. But there were \u2014 there were hundreds and hundreds of those trips. They\nwere almost like invasion, they were just constantly \u2014 planes were flying in and\ncoming back in different areas. Our planes \u2014 actually, I didn\u2019t go along on them, but\nour planes actually flew in and picked up Russians. And they hated it, to be taken\nback to Russian lines, they just hated that, because once they got to Russian lines,\nthey communicated with the flight crews that they had to walk all the way back into\ntheir country, back to the ar\u2014 Red Army. They landed at Red Army lines \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: We dropped them there. Then from there they had to walk all the way back into\nwherever they were going, and they said after that they probably would be shot for\ntraitors, for not dying for their country.",
        "Q: It happened, it happened.",
        "A: Yeah.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: It happened.",
        "A: So-",
        "Q: So you would pick up Russian prisoners from someplace in Germany and fly\nthem to the Red Army lines, to another place in Germany\u201d",
        "A: No, the Russian prisoners were prisoners that were used as slave laborers.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You know.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and so you would fly them east.",
        "A: We would fly them east, yes.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But not too far, because the Russian lines were not that far.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Then we flew Czechs to somewhere 1n Czechoslovakia, we flew people all over.\nAnd I have a detailed analysis of that in our written record there.",
        "Q: So, it was not \u2014 so your f \u2014 1-1f I understand correctly, your flight, where you\nhelped bring survivors of the camps out to \u2014 to France was \u2014 there were two flights.",
        "A: Yeah, that I \u2014 well, there were a lot more than two.",
        "Q: I know, but the ones that you were invo \u2014\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: [had my job to do on the ground, I had to keep those radar sets working and\nstuff. So I just went along because a lack of a navigator or something of that sort, I\nfilled in.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: As I can recall, that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: Okay. Did they say anything to you? On either flight, did anyone speak with\nyou?",
        "A: I can\u2019t recall anything, except the unmistakable change in their mood when they\ncrossed the border, I can\u2019t recall any conversations. Everything was so blo-blotted\nout by that j \u2014 that demonstration of joy that I \u2014 that took mo-most of my memory\naway from that.",
        "Q: Did they stand up at that point?",
        "A: Oh, those that could. They weren\u2019t supposed to, but they were \u2014 they were just \u2014\nthey were so joyous. Cert-Certain \u2014 certainly not everyone stood up, because they\nwere \u2014 were not that strong yet. But it was like seeing a bunch of smiling dancers,\nyou know, like they were putting on a big dance, so \u2014",
        "Q: I can only imagine that they \u2014 that they moved very slowly, if they were \u2014 if they\nwere weak, you know.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: They \u2014 they \u2014 they we di \u2014 they were different, every \u2014 every person is different.\nSo they moved \u2014 but they were strong enough to stand a flight. There\u2019s those that\ncould not \u2014 they could still walk but were \u2014 weren\u2019t strong enough to survive a\nflight of any duration, they had to be under hospital care. As you know, the \u2014 as we\ndiscovered after we got to Halle that the camps were actually quarantined, and the\ndoctors move in \u2014 moved in to the quarantined areas and took care of people, trying\nto save as many lives as possible, and \u2014 until they were brought along strong\nenough to move out of the area. But we learned a lot, a lot about the camps.",
        "Q: You said mi \u2014 tell us a little more detail if you can, about the other flights that\nyou took, in addition \u2014 oh, excuse me, before I get into that, both times you flew\ninto Halle?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay, so \u2014",
        "A: Both times were almost identical.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I\u2014I could have predicted on the second flight.",
        "Q: The other flights you took in addition, with the Russian prisoners-of-war, or\nslave labors \u2014",
        "A: I didn\u2019t take that.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t take that flight?",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. That was somebody else who did?",
        "A: Yeah, the \u2014 I mean, most of the flights were without my need, thank you.",
        "Q: And what about the ones for the Czech \u2014 you said there were Czech people who\nwere flown back from \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, there \u2014 our \u2014 our records show that in the May and June period, that we\nflew just about all over the continent, flying people back to their home, or their\nhometown. Lot of flights into Paris. Many flights, there were a lot of French\nsoldiers taken prisoner, and they were treated as slave laborers.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And so a lot of them come back and we \u2014 and the stories of that, they would \u2014\nthey would take them into Paris and the \u2014 the big airfield in fra \u2014 in Paris, and they\nhad an honor guard and red carpet and so forth. And they were treated just like \u2014\nlike victors, you know, as they deplaned there. And there was a lot of those flights,\nlots of those flights. But in other flights was all over. [knocking] I got to answer\nthat.",
        "Q: Okay. Wait a second. Let me remove your trans mi \u2014",
        "A: No, no, someone can answer it.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: I know, I know \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. [break]",
        "Q: So where were we, we were in fra \u2014 are you ready, rolling?\nQ2: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. We were in France, you know, and you were taking about when French\nprisoners-of-war came home and how they were treated.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Id like to ask you now, how much longer did you stay in Europe. Tell me about\nwhat happened in your life after that.",
        "A: Let\u2019s see. That was actually in June of 1945.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Immediately after finishing the task of bringing all the survivors to their various\ndestinations, we started packing up to come home. We had to go to Europe \u2014 had to\ngo to \u2014 at that time we had to go to the South Pacific. And so, the month of June,\nlatter part of June especially, we were packing all the supplies up and so forth, to be\ntransported back to the United States. And then probably in July \u2014 July, August,\nJuly, August, September \u2014 probably about in early August, the \u2014 this is subject to\ncorrection, but it\u2019s in that time frame anyway. The air echelon, or the \u2014 all the\nairplanes loaded up all the gear that they could take aboard that was high \u2014 high \u2014\nFebruary 19, 2013\nhigher value, and they took off and flew via Iceland to Nova Scotia, back that\nroute, to \u2014 I don\u2019t even know what field they landed on, but anyway, the ground\nechelon which I was on, were packed up and put aboard a liberty ship, or is \u2014 it was\na victory ship, a victory ship. There was two types of ships; the liberty was the\nslowest and ugliest. The victory ship was a troop carrier and \u2014 and did about\neverything, but it was faster. It took less s \u2014 escort. They \u2014 they took around some \u2014\nsomewhere in August and we then board, this slower ship came in probably\nsometime in September. And we landed \u2014 we landed in Boston, and you know,\nsome \u2014 some ways the \u2014 what we did over there was clearer than what happened\nafterwards. And anyway, we landed in Boston, and course [indecipherable] every\ntime we came back there was a huge demonstration, the Red Cross people were\nthere and we got the first milk we had taste \u2014 real milk, since we left.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Everything was powdered. Then my wife met me. I can recall she had a black \u2014\nbig black hat on, dressed in black, beautiful. And again, we then drove \u2014 we di \u2014 I\nthink she came with her parents or some \u2014 somebody that was able to drive. We\ndrove back to their home in Russell Street in Connecticut. And there we decided\nwhat we\u2019re \u2014 talked about what our future was going to be. And \u2014 and back there,\nwe decided to \u2014 I had saved a lot of money, I didn\u2019t smoke or drink when I was\nFebruary 19, 2013\noverseas. So all the money that I was allotted for that went into a s \u2014 a belt around\nmy waist, and I was able to \u2014 and then I turned them into money mor \u2014 money\norders. By the time I got to the States, we were \u2014 I had quite a little, I had probably\nseveral thousand dollars, I don\u2019t know. Anyway, we bought a \u2014 the latest vehicle\nmanufactured, Pontiac, the last wave of passenger vehicles that were manufactured\nbefore the war, turned into wartime status. And we decided we\u2019d go to California\nbecause we\u2019d never been there.",
        "Q: So you were out of the war? You were out of the w \u2014 e-effort for the Pacific, the\nwar had ended for you, and everyth \u2014",
        "A: I missed one point.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: During the time that we\u2019re talking about and the time we\u2019re packing up to go,\nnews came the atomic bomb had been dropped, and so immediately we knew that\nthe war in Japan was over. We knew that our wartime experience was over. I mi \u2014 I\nmissed that.",
        "Q: Okay. What \u2014",
        "A: So anyway, we drove to California for the first \u2014 go ahead.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Hang on, I \u2014 before you \u2014 to get there. When you came back, how much of what\nyou had \u2014 how long - first of all, how long had you been overseas? If you left in\nlate 43, it was?",
        "A: I left in late \u201943.",
        "Q: And you came back in almost se \u2014",
        "A: Late *45.",
        "Q: Late *45.",
        "A: Only two years.",
        "Q: Less than two years.",
        "A: A-A-All that had been compressed into t-two years. An \u2014",
        "Q: Did you feel like you were a changed person?",
        "A: I never give it a thought.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I never give \u2014 I didn\u2019t have nightmares like so many did. We were able to look\nto the future and say okay, where do we go from here? I decided to get into business\nrather than \u2014 rather than take the G.I. Bill of Right \u2014 bill that sent so many people to\ncollege. And so we finally went across the country with this little car and \u2014 and Is \u2014\nwas able \u2014 we were staying at \u2014 we ha-had a destination of my uncle\u2019s place. My\nuncle, his name is Callie(ph). And they lived on \u2014 in Santa Monica. So we came in\nFebruary 19, 2013\nwith him, and he was a painter, and I spent several days painting. And so I started\nmaking money just about soon as I got back, because our \u2014 our pay was delayed\nagain. By that time I was a captain and \u2014 and the pay wasn\u2019t too bad from the\nservice. Anyway, leading beyond that as fast as we can, we received a lot of the\nfour engine air \u2014 U.S. Air Force planes back to Douglas aircraft field. We re \u2014 we\nstarted to renovate them, I was involved in \u2014 I knew wiring and so forth, so I was\ninvolved in the electrical side, and we spent several \u2014 I spent almost a year with\nthem, and about 1946 \u2014 \u201947. Meantime our dau \u2014 we had a daughter born in 1946,\nBeverly \u2014 Beverly June, and she is now retired. And also working, they\u2019ve had to\ncall her back. She was a nurse at University of Colorado medical center. Anyway,\ngoing on from that, in 1949, I opened my first business, which was a ra-radi \u2014 a\nradio-television operation. And I spent quite a number of years with \u2014 with the star\ncommunity like Clark Gable, and all these big stars, including this Disney \u2014 I\nmean, including the gr \u2014 the \u2014 Jack Carson, John Wayne, and many, many, I\nmean, we had the world\u2019s [indecipherable] release for signed photographs.",
        "Q: So that meant you owned a television company?",
        "A: Yes. I owned a\u2014I opened it up and it ran for about 10 years.",
        "Q: What was it called?",
        "A: Valley Video Service.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And later we opened B and D Electronics. B and D being Beatrice and Dutch, B\nand D electronics. And we handled the entire 13 western states and distribution of\nelectronic parts for television and radio and \u2014 and accessories. And then I eventually\nwanted to see more of what goes on in the real world, so I stepped out into various\njobs that led up to me designing a anti-collision device in the 60s, and I think it was\n1965 when the \u2014 the first jet aircraft flying passengers came out. Two \u2014 two TWA\nplanes had crashed over the gand \u2014 over the Grand Canyon. And I said, what a\nterrible, terrible problem, and what a terrible thing to happen, when there was a\nsolution.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And again, I used what was available in my radar training and so forth, same \u2014\nsame equipment, same stuff, and I designed an anti-collision device. And \u2014 and it \u2014\nbelieve it or not, 1t was just the same basic idea; why not take what\u2019s already proven\nby war, by everything and turn it into something to save lives? Anyway, there\nagain, after m \u2014 drawing the design kind of roughly, I decided before I waste any\nmore time that I would go back to Washington, and meet with the \u2014 the FAA, and\nso they set up an appointment a half an hour. And we got \u2014 my \u2014 my brother then\nmet me at that point, and \u2014 cause he was a pilot that had not finished his training\nFebruary 19, 2013\nbefore he was sent overseas. And he met me, and we met with the FAA, and I\nshowed the the design, I showed them the \u2014 where \u2014 where I had had success of that\nin Europe, it had actually worked, and so forth. And the half hour meeting turned\ninto four hours, the whole afternoon was taken, and at the end they says, look, we\nknow \u2014 we\u2019re pretty sure that this will probably save 95 percent of our collisions, he\nsays, but unless you get to a hundred percent, there\u2019s no way we can ever get it\nthrough Congress, or get it approved. So \u2014 and I \u2014 and I also met with people at M-\nMagnavox Corporation, a big electronics firm. They al-also designed a system. So I\nhad communications with them, and they had the same \u2014 same luck. Eventually I \u2014 I\nmade a ri \u2014a di\u2014a revelation \u2014 or I made a disclosure to Bendix Aircraft, and I\nsays, here I\u2019m disclosing this, what can you do with it? You have more power than\nany little one person. Well, they di\u2014 had the same results, they said yes, 1t would\nwork, and so all I got was the satisfaction of knowing the thing would work.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Beyond that, I got into my own business. I \u2014 I joined as a chairman of a public\nelectronics firm that made specialized cathode ray tubes, the display device that\nthey use in air traffic control. We design little tiny tubes that they use on helicopter\npilot sites \u2014 air \u2014 gun sites. And we designed \u2014 we also designed a \u2014 a ground radar\nFebruary 19, 2013\ntype of system that would cut the earth down, I don\u2019t remember how many feet, but\nthen show the side of it in layers, for finding oil.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And that was a sale \u2014 we made a sale of that device to Brown Root, a division of\n[indecipherable]. And that \u2014 let\u2019s see \u2014 lost my train of thought, what was the last \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, you were talking about some of the business ventures and \u2014 and \u2014 and the \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, I was talking about that one.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And this was \u2014 had to have a silver oxide type of \u2014 of paper that flowed past a\nheater. The heater design was \u2014 had to be very even heat over a s \u2014 a stretch of\nheater element, and the paper flowed over it, 1t was heat developed. And the fact\nthat I had worked at two heat \u2014 specialized heat manufacturers as vice president of \u2014\nof new \u2014 new product design and so forth \u2014 two separate ones, I had a lot of\nknowledge about that particular product, and we were able to solve that problem,\nand that was sold to Brown and Root, where it went from there, that\u2019s where my \u2014\nmy memory trailed off, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you may \u2014 so it sounds like you were both in business ventures, and\nalso inventing.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: Well, the inventing was kind of a \u2014 again, a side \u2014 a side product of \u2014 for the heat\ncompanies I invented a couple of devices for boats. One to guard against reversal of\nthe polarity of the power coming out of the boat from the dock. Cause if it was the\nwrong reverse, 1 \u2014 the \u2014 it would eat up the prop and everything else, it had to be the\nright di \u2014 the right polarity. And I designed a de-device that would automatically\nreverse it in the device, rather than have \u2014 have the damage. The other one was \u2014\nwhat the heck was it? The other one was pretty interesting, but I can\u2019t remember the\ndetails.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay. If you do, we\u2019ll talk about it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Those two compressed years that you were in Europe, if I recall you had two\nsons and a daughter?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. Did you ever talk to them about what you had experienced, what had gone\non there? Did you ever talk about these things?",
        "A: Not during their \u2014 because again, we didn\u2019t want to talk much about it, you\nknow, little pieces of \u2014 didn\u2019t mean anything to us. My little job, what \u2014 what\u2019s\ninter \u2014 what\u2019s interesting about having a little radar job? So, I couldn\u2019t say I was a \u2014\na big hero. By the way, one of my clients was Audie Murphy when I was in the\nFebruary 19, 2013\nradio-television business. And also the ace of South Pacific, Pappy Boyington,\nand also General [indecipherable]. These are all customers of mine, as well as\nvirtually the entire film industry. But then again, I didn\u2019t think it was important\nenough to talk about it, I was no \u2014 I was no hero, you know.",
        "Q: But the various events, I mean, kids are im \u2014 are always a \u2014 interested in what\ntheir dad did.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And for their \u2014 them, their dad is the hero, no matter what.",
        "A: Oh, of course, you could be any \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. But then, you said until recently, many things had been classified.",
        "A: That\u2019s exactly right, I couldn\u2019t talk about so much, so I just learned not to talk.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Especially the South Pacific \u2014 no, the south \u2014 southern France invasion, that\nwas top, top secret, I was with \u2014 Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. was in charge of PT\nsquadron in the South Pacific. And this was \u2014 as part of the invasion of our aircraft\nand riders and paratroopers, they had to have certain locations marked with no\ndeviations so they could make their turns to the new direction. So they could make\ntheir turns, in my case, over the last marker to hit the area in southern France that\nthe bombers had pulverized, so that they ran with the least chance of being shot\nFebruary 19, 2013\ndown. Well, I was a-assigned to \u2014 to his squadron, to operate their radar to locate\nthat spot in the middle of the Mediterranean.",
        "Q: Can you repeat this \u2014 excuse me \u2014 I think you said that he was in charge of a\nsquadron in the South Pacific. You mean \u2014",
        "A: No, I\u2014 I meant the so \u2014 southern France, southern France.",
        "Q: Okay, so Douglas Fairbanks was in charge of such a squadron in southern\nFrance?",
        "A: He \u2014 he was thought of at the time as a playboy with a degree \u2014 the june \u2014\nlieutenant rank that was just playing around, but that guy was a hero.",
        "Q: Was he?",
        "A: He was marvelous. And there\u2019s so much to tell, but couldn\u2019t. Was \u2014 his whole\noperation was top secret until after the Vietnam war.",
        "Q: No kidding.",
        "A: So, during that time, I\u2014 you know, I could not talk.",
        "Q: Well, what can you tell us now about it?",
        "A: Tell you everything now, but I \u2014 I just started to memorialize it, so I can\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014I don\u2019t want to publicize anything yet, until I\u2019ve got it in a better form, and\nyou'll get it as soon as I do.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019ll be \u2014 that was gonna be one of the chapters in my book.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, is there anything else that you would want to share with us today\nabout what it was that you experienced, what you\u2019d want people to know?",
        "A: The big \u2014 the biggest subject that I wanted people to know, was obvious at the\nmeeting yesterday, was the fact that the 90\" troop carrier squadron got a very, very\nbad rap from the author of \u201cBand of Brothers,\u201d name was Stephen Ambrose. He\nwrote that entire \u2014 supposed to be truthful series, all about the paratroopers, 101\u2018\nand 82\", which were marvelous and they \u2014 they thought the world of us. All about\nthat, but he never interviewed one air \u2014 one [indecipherable] pilot to get the story\nof who carried them in and what happened on some of their problems. They\ninterviewed people that had \u2014 had f\u2014 had been on aircraft that weren\u2019t as trained as\nthe 438\", and they dropped their paratroopers in \u2014 in the wrong spots, in the\nmarshes. And they\u2019re the people, the paratroopers were interviewed. But I have\nsomething I want to read into the \u2014 into the record, about what a paratrooper said\nabout us. And my biggest goal of this entire operation is to focus on the fact that the\n90\" troop carrier squadron of four forces \u2014 I\u2019m saying forces, or incidents or\nwhatever, four of the most important, famous in World War II, one of them was the\n90\" troop carrier command, and they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019ve been downgraded an-and kicked\nFebruary 19, 2013\nand so forth. I wanted to restore the truth about that \u2014 that squadron of a thousand\nplanes.",
        "Q: Okay, hang on a second. What time are we at right now?\nQ2: It\u2019s after 12, let me check for you.",
        "Q: All right.\nQ2: I\u2014I-\u2014 when we had our little chat with the lady, we were at 12 - oh something\n\u2014 12:24 \u2014 12:25.",
        "Q: 12:24. I would suggest \u2014 do you \u2014 let\u2019s cut right now.\nEnd of File One\nFebruary 19, 2013\nBeginning of File Two",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Mr. Ernest Dutcher, on February 19\", 2013 in Encino, California.\nAnd Mr. Dutcher, we wanted to follow up on a few things that we talked about\nearlier. Just one of them that \u2014 one question about your transport of survivors. Did\nyou ever meet any of these people who had been on the plane with you, or any of\nthe other planes that took them out from Germany to France for medical attention?",
        "A: Unfortunately, no.",
        "Q: You never did?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. And you never came across anybody\u2019s story who said that they had been on\nsuch a plane, whether they wrote about it, or 1t was filmed, or anything like that?",
        "A: That\u2019s the thing about the 90\" air force, it was just forgotten about, apparently \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 and none of the things are \u2014 were every publicized a lot.",
        "Q: Okay. Now let\u2019s step back and talk in more detail about \u2014 you mentioned\nDouglas Fairbanks Jr., and his role.",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: And we started to \u2014 to talk about that a little bit. But explain exactly where in the\npicture he fit. You know when you were talk \u2014 explaining to us about the squadrons\nand the wings and you know, the lo \u2014 what was \u2014 what was his, not just his rank,\nbut what was his job?",
        "A: His job was to mislead the Germans into where we were going to land at almost\nevery landing. His job at the specific southern France invasion was to use about 10\nof his 12 PT boats in a squadron, they were equipped with very powerful ma \u2014\namplifiers and loudspeakers. And he would race along the sh \u2014 it\u2019d race along the\nshore to about 40 knots, or 50 miles an hour, so very fast in the water. And they\nwould turn on these \u2014 these things as if there were 10,000 boats out there. Very,\nvery loud and very deceiving. At the same time he\u2019d have a fl \u2014 a plane flying and\ndropping what they call window.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s that?",
        "A: Window is strips of tin foil. And it \u2014 the strips of tinfoil would look, on the\nGerman radar, like a whole big fleet of airplanes coming. And they were all headed\nfor this \u2014 this fake landing site he designed. He also designed rubber paratroopers of\ndifferent sizes, make it look like there was a lot of them. They were inflatable, and\nthen they dropped those from the planes at some point, that looked like there\u2019s the\nplace it\u2019s gonna be, so the Germans would move all their reinforcements over there.\nFebruary 19, 2013\nWhich then, of course, made the \u2014 the real invasion point much safer for the planes\ncoming in. Specially planes like C-47s, that did not have an ounce of firepower on\nit. It was very vulnerable, so \u2014",
        "Q: So, did this happen simultaneously as the Normandy invasion or just prior, or \u2014",
        "A: No, no, me \u2014 this happened in August of the same year\u2019s invasion. We \u2014 we\nmoved down to southern \u2014 we \u2014 we were stationed in a wheat field, in the mid --\nmiddle of Italy, and \u2014 called Canino airfield \u2014 air base. And from there, we did our\ntraining and so forth. And then, I was picked out from the four radar officers of our\n438\" oroup, to be the one to go on detached service for the navy. That was a navy\noperation. So I was then broke away from the group, and moved down \u2014 or broke\naway from our squadron and moved down to Corsica. And at Corsica there\u2019s a\nbase for these \u2014 a harbor for these boats and this \u2014 adjacent to the harbor were their\nliving quarters, and \u2014 and mess halls and so forth. And \u2014 and I \u2014 I lived like a navy\nperson at that time and like \u2014 very, very graciously entertained. I was kind of the \u2014\nthe top person there for awhile, because I was the one they picked to put the marker\nbeacon in the middle of the Mediterranean so that the final turn of the aircraft with\nthe li \u2014 with the pilot \u2014 with the paratroopers first and then followed by \u2014",
        "Q: The rubber paratroopers?",
        "A: Huh?\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: The rubber paratroopers?",
        "A: No, no, these \u2014 this is the real thing \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 the real thing. The reason for me being there is I had to man that light, and we\ndid it on a PT boat. But the real tr \u2014 the fake paratroopers was his design.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And he \u2014 far from being a playboy, this guy was valuable. So valuable in fact\nthat all of our participation had to be sworn secret, we couldn\u2019t discuss it with our\nown family. You couldn\u2019t discuss it with your s \u2014 your bunkmate, you know. And \u2014\nand it \u2014 all that secrecy was not lifted til after the Vietnam war. That\u2019s why nothing\nhas been printed about it, and as far as I know, I\u2019m the only living person that has\nthe knowledge of what went on.",
        "Q: Did you meet Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Did you meet him? Douglas Fairbanks ju \u2014",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, I had lunch \u2014 we ate at the same mess hall. He was very self-\ndepreciating person, very nice person.",
        "Q: And it was his thoughts, his ideas \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: \u2014 for these types of diversionary and misleading tactics?",
        "A: Yeah, he got his \u2014 his start with Mountbatten, out of England, and he got his\ncommission out of England, and then eventually was transferred to a navy\ncommission and \u2014 and there he started doing his dirty work.",
        "Q: And would you say successfully?",
        "A: Very successfully, yes, very.",
        "Q: Okay. Is there anything else to that episode that you\u2019d like to add about him?",
        "A: All I\u2014I only saw him at \u2014 at the mess hall, that\u2019s the only time that \u2014 and\nusually \u2014 usually in the evening, after we got through with our maneuvers, and we\nwent through several weeks of training on \u2014 on the Mediterranean at different\npoints on the Mediterranean, under \u2014 I was assigned two of the PT boats that were\nheavily armed with 40 millimeter anti-aircraft guns and 20 millimeter and twin 50\ncalibers, and \u2014 and about a half a dozen death \u2014 depth chargers \u2014 charges for\nsubmarines, there were still submarines in the area. And also a couple \u2014 about four\ntorpedoes. This little 78 foot boat, wooden boat, carried all those. And to \u2014 we\npracticed targets, we practiced torpedoing the ship and we\u2019d go straight at the ship\nat high speed, and then make a hard left, and let the torpedo go before we made our\nturn. That way we were out away from the blast zone. Then, at night, you know,\nwere \u2014 we were kind of very flexible. At night we would pull into a little canal\nFebruary 19, 2013\nwhere there\u2019s trees and shrubbery over us, and we\u2019d stay the night there, and about\ndaybreak we\u2019d go back out to our training. So that part has not been documented\nyet, and that \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019m involved in trying to get pulled together before I wa \u2014\nI \u2014 I don\u2019t want to release the whole thing yet.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Cause the whole thing is not here yet.",
        "Q: Got it, yeah. You mentioned earlier also that there had been these tragic and\nsenseless mistakes in England, when due to \u2014 you know, due to decisions made by\n\u2014 by leaders, you know, military leaders and also just the sheer number of flights,\nthat there were these accidents that resulted in victims. Do you recall any other such\ninstances where \u2014 where there were \u2014 there were these sad events that happened?",
        "A: Well, the biggest one of all was Operation Market Basket.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Had that not been diverted by General Montgomery selling the idea to mi \u2014\nEisenhower \u2014 these are all our opinions, not only mine, but a lot of \u2014 lot of our\npeople, that those tanks of Patton could have been continuing on their unobstructed\ndrive to Germany, and would have saved one year war.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s the biggest of all.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014",
        "Q: And that\u2019s because the gasoline \u2014 you said that the gasoline was used \u2014",
        "A: Oh, yes, the \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 old workhorse 47, when it was carrying \u2014 we would fly gasoline in and land at\nlittle pastures, or muddy fields. Anywhere that there was a space big enough that a\nplane could roll out in. We\u2019d even help \u2014 when I say we, it\u2019s the people aboard the\nplane, cause I had enough to do at the base in England to keep the planes\u2019 radar\nprop \u2014 properly working. But they would help unload the planes with the gasoline,\nand they carried about fi \u2014 6,000 gal \u2014 6,000 pounds of gasoline. At eight pounds\nper gallon, you can calculate how many Jerry cans there were. Anyway, they were\nthe standard Jerry cans, laid inside the cabin on the floor. And they \u2014 they not only\nun \u2014 helped unload those cans and \u2014 so the tanks can be refueled, they were \u2014 they\nf-far outran their \u2014 their surface supply tr \u2014 tanker trucks. They were going that fast.\nSo we would da \u2014 we would unload the gas cans and then load up the wounded, the\nmost seriously wounded, and then bring them back with the litters that came down\nfrom the side, inside the plane, and flew them back to hospitals in England and\nFebruary 19, 2013\nthen make another \u2014 sometimes they made two trips a day, each pilot, they were\nvery tired.",
        "Q: I can imagine.",
        "A: But we \u2014 I have no doubt, myself, that the war would have ended one year\nearlier, at least a year earlier, maybe even sooner. Cause keep in mind, all this 1s\ncompressed now. Everything we\u2019re talking about is compressed into a two year per\n\u2014 time frame.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. What about civilian casualties in England?",
        "A: Oh, they were high.",
        "Q: Were they?",
        "A: In\u20141n my start of my book, I said, my book was going to be entitled, I was\nthere. On the first chapter, I describe the fact that I loved ice skating. I met my wife\nthat way, so forth, before I left. I loved ice skating. And they have a nice ice skating\nrink in one of the suburbs of London. So I used to go frequently into as soon \u2014 as\noften as we had any sort of a pass, I'd take the train into London and take the\nsubway, the famed British subway system, which was also their air raid shelters,\nwe'd take \u2014 Id take it out to the rink, which was, as I say, a suburb. And after tha \u2014\nafter that, I-I would come back to the Red Cross building, where as soon as we\nheard the sirens, everyone was supposed to dive for the shelters. We got to the point\nFebruary 19, 2013\nwhere we were playing Russian roulette, that it would \u2014 it\u2019s not going to hit us, you\nknow, type of thing, you know. And so, when the V-2s come over, they were st \u2014\nsort of a staccato sound, very staccato. And when they stopped being staccato 1s\nwhen we had to worry, because then they were \u2014 the power\u2019d been cut off and they\njust indiscriminately fell into the heart of London. And of course, there was\nthousands of British civilians killed during that time. I think they lost many more\ncivilians than they did soldiers.",
        "Q: Close \u2014",
        "A: Oh then \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 another time, we had to go on a \u2014 a trip to pick up supplies, up to Coventry,\nEngland, and you remember the Coventry thing where a bomb hit a air raid\nshelter, and they were all sealed in there, forever.",
        "Q: What about \u2014",

We didn\u2019t get very far, but we had to turn around and come back and\nFebruary 19, 2013\nget a second order of it. They were so delicious, even though they had a little print\nsometimes on a\u2014 ona French fry. So I say \u2014",

        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: You said \u2014 you mentioned earlier to me that \u2014 that there used to be dances near\nSalisbury.",
        "A: Oh, they\u2019d a hold officer dance at the officers\u2019 club and \u2014 on our base. And they\nwould go out and get these young \u2014 these girls, the ones \u2014 the \u2014 the single guys, the\nsingle pilots and all, they could go out and do that. Us old married people had to\nstick to our inventing. So anyway, they would bring them into the base and then had\nthe responsibility to take them back to their home after.",

        "Q: Well, tell us about that incident.",
        "A: Pardon?",

        "A: Yeah, well that\u2019s \u2014 this is the \u2014 during that particular period of time, the\nheadlights of the Jeeps and every ground vehicle, including civilian cars, if any, had\nto have a little slit in it. Light was projected out of that slit, enough, not to see too\nmuch of the road or anything, but for other drivers to be able to see it. So they \u2014\nthese two young \u2014 young pilots who were taking their \u2014 their girlfriends for the\nnight, they had picked them up and brought them in for the dance, then they were \u2014\nno, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s the other way around. They, having picked them up at their\nhomes, were coming into the base, before the dance. And the small headlight \u2014\nsmall square of light wasn\u2019t enough for them to \u2014 to be stopped \u2014 or have the pilot\nsee it in time for him to do something, but the pilot \u2014 a pilot was coming back from\na mission, a night mission where he was training. And he was just crossing the\nhighway where the Jeep-load of people were coming his way. And his right prop\nstarted chewing up the Jeep, and \u2014 and it did result in the \u2014 one pilot was killed\nimmediately and another pilot lost an arm and a leg, and the two girls were fatally\ninjured, but they didn\u2019t die instantly.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: They \u2014 Bob Owens tells the story, that he was right next to his office, right next\nto the accident, so he was first on the scene, and he was holding the girls in his\narms.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: And was all this classified information? Was all this \u2014",
        "A: Oh, of course.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This information never would get out to the public, cause the public was only fed\ninformation that was positive. Very few of the loss \u2014 very few of the setbacks were\never mentioned to the public. And I think even the \u201cBridge Too far\u201d movie that\nwas made, I don\u2019t think the impression was given that it was a failure at all. It was\njust another very exciting mission. And these were items that were not fed to the\npublic for one big reason. The public was doing a magnificent job of producing all\nof the war materials that were needed for that huge undertaking, for all of the\ndifferent participants, including Russia. Russia and England mainly, and the\nFrench, when they were able to. And had they released any of this information, it\nmight have destroyed some morale back home. And they had a good reason, I think\nfor doing it. So the fact that they didn\u2019t tell the home front everything, I can\nunderstand.",

        "A: Oh yeah, it was mainly a story about their \u2014 their training, their formation back\nhere in the States. There was different CDs, I think there\u2019s about seven CDs.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And the \u2014 1-1t would go from home here at their training bases here. Then they\u2019d\ngo to England and their training in England, in the countryside and all their \u2014 how\nthey got acquainted with the British people and so forth. Then they had the story of\nthe actual \u2014 one of the \u2014 I think the third CD, somewhere in there, it told about their\nFebruary 19, 2013\nactual landing in Normandy, the first people ever to touch foot in Normandy, and\n\u2014 since the Nazis took over. Wonderful story, had it been \u2014 not \u2014 not been mis-\nmistold [indecipherable] it was then the race across \u2014 across France and the\nvarious strategies and the big battles they were involved in and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nthen Bastogne, they were the heroes of Bastogne. They deserved every accolade\nthey could get, cause they were a tough bunch.",
        "Q: Okay. And at what part do you say what was shown in the movie, or in the \u2014\nwritten in the book, where you say it damaged the reputation of the 101st, is that\nwhat your \u2014 1s that what you \u2014",
        "A: No, the reputation of the ni-ninth troop carrier command.",
        "Q: Okay. How \u2014 what \u2014 how was the ninth troop carrier command portrayed?",
        "A: They were portrayed as a bunch of over-the-hill airline pilots that had been\nconverted to drive these \u2014 these big bu \u2014 these big trash trucks, or \u2014 you know, big,\nbig airplanes. It was unflattering, I can\u2019t remember the exact words, but any event, I\ngot a story from Captain Gates, was then a Major Gates \u2014",
        "Q: Hang on a second, I\u2019m still \u2014 before we go there \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, they were portrayed as over-the-hill airline pilots who didn\u2019t know what they\nwere doing, is this what the issue was, or \u2014\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: Well, they knew what they were doing, but they were just drivers of transports,\nthat\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Oh, airplane transports, okay.",
        "A: Air-Air-Airplane drivers.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They were the \u2014 the \u2014 the indicated \u2014 indications seemed to be that that group of\npilots were the lower echelon of pilots, you know.",
        "Q: Okay. So that\u2019s how it was in \u201cBand of Brothers.\u201d What was it like in your\nview, and according to your experience?",
        "A: Just the real story, that I\u2019d kind of like to get out, to help bring the fame of the \u2014\nthe real accomplishment of the 90\" troop carrier command, bring it into the truth.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they did marvelous things, they did really marvelous things. First of all,\ninstead of being old, inexperienced airline pilots, who knew nothing about night at \u2014\nnight flying or anything, they were really highly trained. They were highly trained\nin the States. I ver \u2014 I mentioned at lunch, they were highly trained in the States by\nbeing forced to fly five feet over the highest obstacle for 500 miles.",
        "Q: Right.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: And they were highly trained because I held for many weeks before D-Day, I\nheld schooling in all the different aircraft \u2014 different radar in the aircraft. Every\npilot knew how to operate the Rebecca gear, which was the main \u2014 one of the main\nairborne navigation pieces. He knew all about operating the new British G system\nthat was brought aboard by another story. We did an awful lot of training, these\nwere highly trained people. They were trained so well in fact, that on the first \u2014 they\nwere chosen by Eisenhower to be the lead group to lead the whole \u2014 whole group\nof aircraft participating in the invasion, into the fields of fire, like we say here, into\nGermany, into Normandy.",
        "Q: Okay, into Normandy, France first, yeah?",
        "A: Yeah, we were first. We \u2014 we allowed the troop carrier, the 101\u2018 air \u2014 troop\ncarrier, and the 180 \u2014 and the 82\" troop carrier to be the first put boots on the\nground. But they wouldn\u2019t have been able to put those boots on the ground were it\nnot for the fact that we were very proficient in finding the spot where they should\nbe, as well as not \u2014 not losing anyone that we were aware of, in the flight part of the\noperation. So then they turned around, and they come back to the field and picked\nup the gliders. And they hooked one glider per aircraft, and took off. Flew those\ngliders on in and one of my very close friends, and the most senior of glider pilots\nFebruary 19, 2013\nwas killed in that particular operation. Before that 1t was flawless, no one had died,\nno planes were lost. And the \u2014 they flew that group in.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: His name was Lieutenant Darling, and he has a cross at one of the close\ncemeteries there that I\u2019ve got pictures of, so forth. But the stories of those pi \u2014 those\ntroop c \u2014 not troop \u2014 the pilots of those glider pilot \u2014 pilots of the gliders, I'll get it\nstraight, became fighters when they got on the ground. They were just part of the\nfighting group, so they took their \u2014 their different weapons, and they tried hard \u2014\nthey\u2019re supposed to get back as fast as they could. And some of the \u2014 some of them\nhad some harrowing stories to tell, of how Germans would massacre the soldiers\nthat were in some of the downed gliders, and injured and so on. It was too much\ndetail to even [indecipherable] now. With one exception, the \u2014 one of the pilots\nthat came back was a very quiet redheaded glider pilot. He \u2014 they cut loose from the\ntow aircraft and while he was landing there was a German soldier in the middle of\nthe little hedgerow field, and he had a \u2014 what they call a burp gun, you know, that\u2019s\na automatic pistol. He was waiting for them to get close enough. In other words,\nthey were dead ducks. So he kicked the windshield out of his \u2014 he was a co-pilot.\nHe kicked the windshield out and took his gun, took careful aim \u2014 and the p \u2014 a\nglider, after it\u2019s cut th \u2014 cuts loose is very stable, very steady. He \u2014 he \u2014 he got the \u2014\nFebruary 19, 2013\nkilled this German soldier and saved, of course, that whole planeload. One other\nthing, the German were standing in the middle of the field with Germans in all the\nhedgerows around, waiting to shoot, and they were using wooden bullets. Now I\ndon\u2019t think \u2014 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s well known. Wooden bullets were little coated,\nhardwood bullets and they would travel a certain \u2014 they would travel a certain\ndistance before losing their velocity.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So before it hits the opposite hedgerow, that was twice as far away as the\nGerman in the middle, they would fade out.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: If they hit a person, though, they were devastating.",
        "Q: Were they like exploding bullets?",
        "A: They almost had about the same effect to your internal organs. They would\nnever pass through you, it\u2019d just tear you up terribly. So they were vicious, and \u2014\nbut as I say, I haven\u2019t heard from anyone else anywhere about them. I even brought\nsome back, and eventually my kids probably was playing with them and stuff, lost\nthem.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 so does \u2014 those bullets were being aimed at the gliders?\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: Yeah, they were being wa \u2014 they were being aimed at the glider pi \u2014 glider load.\nThe paratroopers, or glider troopers, they were called. The nose of the glider would\ntilt up on landing, and then they could race out from the front, in different\ndirections. But they \u2014 he was waiting to shoot them as they were coming out, and\nthe ones around the hedgerows were waiting to get them with the wooden bullets,\nwithout hurting their own people.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s why they used them \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 because they lost their velocity before they\u2019d hit the other hedgerow.",
        "A: Exactly, exactly.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And were they able to use them, or did they \u2014 I mean, were they \u2014 what\nhappened to the glider \u2014 were any of the gliders lost?",
        "A: On this particular one, the Ge \u2014 the Germans were not in the hedgerows, this 1s\njust \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 a Situation I brought up as a side issue.",
        "Q: Okay.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: But on this one, where he killed the \u2014 his potential executioner \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 they didn\u2019t have any in the hedge \u2014 hedgerows there, he \u2014 he was able to get\nout everyone out and he got back.",
        "Q: Okay, so why do you bel \u2014 do you think \u2014 have you given a full story, according\n\u2014 you know, according to what you believe we need to know about what was the\ntrue professionalism of the pilots and those who were piloting the glider planes, or\nis there more that you want to add to show that they really did know their stuff?",
        "A: Well, the best evidence is the fact that they got the presidential citation \u2014 it\u2019s\neither the presidential or war department sar \u2014 citation, some call it presidential. A\ncitation as being the only group of a \u2014 of the \u2014 the thousand airplanes that were\nflying, the only group to win that award. And then the 88\", other group that\nliberated your actual slave labor camp there, also the 88\", won the same\ndistinguished citation, as a unit citation. Every member of the group could wear the\nribbon.",
        "Q: Okay. What did the ri-ribbon look like?",
        "A: It was a gold framed blue, just plain blue. I was gonna bring them along, but I\ncouldn\u2019t find them.",
        "Q: Okay. So why did the \u201cBand of Brothers\u201d get it wrong?\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: Because the author got 1t wrong. He was a famous author. And of cour \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What was his name?",
        "A: His name is Stephen Ambrose.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we ax \u2014 when I say we, some of the troop carrier people, such as Major\nGates, who\u2019s now Colonel Gates, and he wrote an email to me that was very\nrevealing, he said \u2014 he\u2019s the one that said that not one troop carrier pilot to his\nknowledge \u2014 and he was quite h-high up there, had ever been interviewed for this.\nSo although we \u2014 it was a wonderful movie, and a very successful movie \u2014 we can\u2019t\nblame any of the actors, or we can\u2019t blame any of the participants in it, cause they\nhad no knowledge that he had not interviewed any of these. However, the damage\nhad been done. And a lawsuit was started \u2014 was started by the troop carrier group\nagainst Ambrose, not against \u201cBand of Brothers.\u201d And it was proceeding at the\ntime he died.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Ambrose died, and then the \u2014 the troop carrier grou-group dropped the lawsuit.",
        "Q: And what were they charging him again \u2014",
        "A: Against de \u2014 defamation, I mean \u2014 I mean, just ruining the reputation of an entire\n\u2014an entire command.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: How many people would that involve?",
        "A: Well it involved 1,000 aircraft and 1,000 aircraft involved at least five people per\naircraft and plus the ground personnel that equal that, so you can kind of use the\nmath on it",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: \u2014 and figure out that an awful lot of people \u2014 some people didn\u2019t care, you know,\nthey got out of the war, hey I\u2019m still alive, what am I complaining about? But some\ndid, and it\u2019s still hurting us through the fact that the Holocaust happened. Yesterday\nshowed the \u2014 showed the people that liberated \u2014 the different groups that liberated\nit. And it showed the 101\u00b0, it showed the 82\". But there was a vacant spot down\nbelow there that didn\u2019t show the 90\" air f\u2014 air force. Because the thought was that\nnobody but ground people were involved in the liberation. So that\u2019s the thing that \u2014",
        "Q: How was \u2014 forgive me for this, but was there a direct way that the 90\" aircraft\nwas involved?",
        "A: Well, when \u2014 our \u2014 our \u2014 our thought would be \u2014 maybe it\u2019s only mine, but our\nthought would be that the fact that this plane shortened the war so much that \u2014 that a\nlot of the Holocaust survivors benefited from the fact that \u2014 and were still alive\ntoday because of the \u2014 even Eisenhower said that.",
        "Q: Okay.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: Said that we were such a big force in ending the war, so \u2014 and so was the ground\ntroops that fought from battle \u2014 from foxholes and so forth, I\u2019m taking nothing\naway from them. They did a great job and a great number of them died. And so did\na great number of the people in for \u2014 in the ninth troop carrier command. They also\ndied. So my feeling that liberators, we were the pre-liberators if you cou \u2014 you\nmight put it that way. We shortened the time.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: Had it not been for us serving \u2014 supplying gasoline as fast as we did to Patton,\nthose ground troops that liberated the camp would not have been there yet.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Th-They didn\u2019t \u2014 they weren\u2019t free enough to be there yet. So that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s my\nposition.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you\u2019d want to add to this episode, this part of the story?\nThat you think is \u2014",
        "A: No, I think that\u2019s basically the thing that I \u2014 that\u2019s driven me for \u2014 in trying to\npiece the whole thing together, particularly in the last two years, because I didn\u2019t\nknow the whole story, I cou \u2014 I did \u2014 I couldn\u2019t put it together.",
        "Q: Okay.\nQ2: Just two points of fact that were \u2014\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Sure.\nQ2: You \u2014 you keep saying either the 90\" or the ninth?",
        "A: 90\". Nine zero.\nQ2: So, see I heard ninth and I heard 90, so it\u2019s definitely 90\", okay. And the\nsecond one was Mountbatten was a field marshal for England. If Fairbanks had a\nrelationship with him, and had another commission, was it a \u2014 a British commission\nor an American commission in the na \u2014 since you were with him on Corsica.",
        "A: I-I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 he was with the United States Navy at that time, had to be a\nnavy commission.\nQ2: So\u2014 so he \u2014 he left from the British [indecipherable] American, so that\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s an interesting [indecipherable]",
        "A: He had a \u2014 he had a title in England.",
        "Q: So if we can \u2014 we can just explore this. I don\u2019t know whether your voice is\ncaught on \u2014 on the mike when you\u2019re asking this question. If I can repeat it \u2014",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Douglas Fairbanks Jr. had both a British commission as well as a US.\ncommission, 1s that correct?",
        "A: That was the question, and he had definitely at the time I was involved, an\nAmerican commission in an American navy br \u2014 group. His British \u2014 he had ac\u2014a\nFebruary 19, 2013\ntitle there, and I think it was lieutenant, but I ca \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you. And I\u2019m not even\nsure what lieutenant meant in rank there.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I did want to mention one more humorous \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 side of the Montgomery story. During the build-up, probably about \u2014 it could\nhave even been a day before D-Day \u2014 oh no, I\u2019m sorry, this is \u2014 this is different, let\nme s \u2014 let me straighten that out.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Cause he was on the base at this time too. He was with MacArthur in that\nfamous picture of MacArthur, and \u2014",
        "Q: Who \u2014 who \u2014 who is he?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Who \u2014 who are you referring to?",
        "A: Montgomery.",
        "Q: Or Mountbatten, which one?",
        "A: Montgomery.",
        "Q: Montgomery, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, General Montgomery, the famous general.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But in \u2014 on \u2014 around December 23\", 20 \u2014 from the 20\" to the 25\" was the\nholdout at Bastogne. But there was a rumor around our air base that a German\nprisoner of war camp was gonna break out on that day and we armed everybody to\nthe teeth. So I carried a submarine \u2014 a submarine \u2014 I carried a submachine gun, a\nThompson 30 caliber submarine \u2014 sub \u2014 submachine gun. And then I was\nappointed officer of the day on that particular day. Well, in come this big, big\nBritish command car, and I had orders that nobody entered that base without\nshowing identification. And so, not that I didn\u2019t recognize him, but my orders were\nthat I had to ask for identification from everyone entering that base. And so he\ndidn\u2019t want to give it. Well, my submachine gun was held over the shoulder. I\nunstrapped it and I said, sir, could I see your I.D.? I got it real quick.",
        "Q: Did you really?",
        "A: I got it real quick, cause it\u2019s no nonsense time, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and then I laughed afterwards, thinking that if I\u2019d have used it, it might\nhave shortened the war even more.",
        "Q: Oh gosh.",
        "A: You'd better strike that one.\n100February 19, 2013",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No, this \u2014 this \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was desperate times.\nQ2: [inaudible] fish and chip story, they were going back for another \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, you were going back for another fish and chips, you know, the \u2014 what was\nthe significance when you talked to us about the fish and chips that you picked up\nand how tasty they were and you went back for another one? Was there something\nthat was part of that?",
        "A: Part of that was that we were in Coventry \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 and we was reviewing the town and getting the history of it and so forth. I\nactually went there with a \u2014 a Jeep and a trailer to pick up parts for our radar\noperation. And we were coming back from picking up the parts and we saw this fish\nand chips place along the road. We stopped and we got an order of fish and chips,\nwhich they carefully wrapped in a piece of newspaper. And we con-continued on\nour way til we got a mile or so out of town and we finished our fish and chips. They\nwere so darn good, we had to turn around, make a trip back for a second batch.",
        "Q: And did you? You get as \u2014\n101February 19, 2013",
        "A: And we did.",
        "Q: And you got a second batch.",
        "A: We got a second batch.",
        "Q: And that fish and chips was not one of the targets of the Germans.",
        "A: That was not under any \u2014 not under any di \u2014 problem whatsoever.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was just \u2014 just great, and since that time I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t pass a fish and chips\ndinner.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. There was something else that you had asked, which was the ninth\nor the 90\"?\nQ2: He \u2014 he was \u2014 he would say either the \u2014 he would \u2014 he \u2014 he would say either\nthe 90\" or the ninth, and so therefore it shows a discrepancy \u2014",
        "Q: Right.\nQ2: \u2014 so what is it? Without equivocation, he said the 90\".",
        "Q: So it\u2019s the 90\", can you explain what? Because I\u2019m not a military \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s the 90\" troop carrier group \u2014",
        "Q: The 90\" troop car \u2014",
        "A: Nine zero, 90\", yeah.",
        "Q: Nine zero, 90\" troop carrier group.\n102February 19, 2013",
        "A: Which I guarantee you haven\u2019t heard too much of in the public since the \u201cBand\nof Brothers\u201d come out.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. What else would you want a younger generation to know about what\nit is that you saw during the war, and what it is that you\u2019d want them to understand\nabout the Holocaust survivors and what they went through, that you witnessed as\nwell.",
        "A: The only thing that I\u2019d like to have you \u2014 have them know, that our experiences\nover there and experiences since that time, have made \u2014 made a non-Jewish person,\nand non-j \u2014 most of our buddies that were over there with us, feel more sympathy\nfor the Jewish race, and more \u2014 more admiration for the Jewish race. And part of the\nadmiration was, we were trying to tell ourselves, why would they go through \u2014 why\nwould they go through that torture and everything without committing suicide? We\ncouldn\u2019t figure that out. Well, the answer came in the fact that their \u2014 their great\nfaith and their great will, and \u2014 and that\u2019s \u2014 kind of answers the question, so \u2014 but\nthe younger generation \u2014 I \u2014 I was \u2014 my grandson I mentioned took me to a -- what\nthey call a \u2014 a bring and tell to a f\u2014 a first grade class. And he brought me in, the\nother kids brought toys and different things like that, he brought me in. And he says,\nthis is my grandpa and he wants to tell you something about the war. Well, they\ndidn\u2019t utter a word. I told them, and I had to be careful cause there was Japanese\n103February 19, 2013\nteachers there, so I had to be careful not to mention how bad they were. But I only\nmentioned this bad man out of Germany. And he took all those people and \u2014 and\nhe put them in camps, and he \u2014 they killed them, and this was terrible.

And then \u2014 then we\nwent through learning all about these \u2014 this new device out of MIT, the \u2014 the new\nradars, t \u2014 absolutely, totally top secret. And then we were \u2014 actually went out on\nanother piece of radar, flying off the coast and finding submarines out of the water\nwith this particular anti-submarine device, which I never was involved with using\nlater.

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: By that point \u2014 I know you, you know, from your story we get a sense of \u2014 of\nreal intensive focus on the work that you\u2019re doing, on the technology, on learning\neverything that you know about it. What about the wider political events that were\ngoing on at the time? Do you remember, do you hear, did you read newspapers\nabout how the war was progressing before the invasion?

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: No, no.",
        "Q: I\u2019m just trying \u2014 you see, the reason why I asked this question is I\u2019m trying to\nget an \u2014 a sense of the context of the time, the mood of the time, the level of\nknowledge of the time. You know, what had priority and what had less priority, and\nhow much did people know and \u2014 and what they were aware of. Which I think\nyou\u2019ve addressed, you know.",

My graduation from Rhinelander high school,\nwith a \u2014 with a high school graduate degree, which was pretty good back in those\ndays. And then in showing off radios one day, I heard a big bulletin come over the\nradio, that Pearl Harbor had been bombed.

        "A: Well, we enlisted in Wausau, Wisconsin, which is a much, much larger city, it\nmust have had at least 15,000 people in it. About 50 percent larger, I would say. But\nthat was the center of a lot of activities up there. And so we were taken down to \u2014 to\nnorthern Illinois, where they had a \u2014 a center for processing the \u2014 the troops and so\nforth, where we got all of our shots, and all of our \u2014 all of our warnings, an-and \u2014\nand early \u2014 early instruction. The fact I\u2019d been in National Guard though, made me\nkind of special, because I then was put in charge of small delegations that started\ntraining. From there we were shipped, after the initial equipping and issuing of\nclothing and blankets, and so forth, I was shipped to Jefferson barracks Missouri,\nwhich 1s adjacent to Saint Louis, Missouri. And Jefferson barracks was \u2014 it was\ncold, and middle of the \u2014 middle of the winter, virtually. And down there we were\nplaced in tents, and very, very cold. There we got all of our real tough shots. And\nthe shots made us so sick that we were afraid we wouldn\u2019t die. There, while I was at\nJefferson barracks, and that \u2014 we started our training there, I\u2019d \u2014 I did the drill\nsergeant role of taking the raw recruits and showing them how to march and how to\nturn and how to stop and the proper commands and all that. But then the newspaper\nheadlines come out; Roosevelt, we will be building 125,000 planes a year. It was\nFebruary 19, 2013\nbeyond belief, but anyway, it didn\u2019t make that much sense because during the time\nthat I had gone through medical \u2014 the medical exams, I got what is commonly\nknown as white coat fever. And the \u2014 and \u2014 and I got excited. I was so worried that\nI wouldn\u2019t pass, that I, of course, didn\u2019t, and my blood pressure went sky high\nduring the exams.

I instructed radio there until I got a\nwaiver on the two year requirement to join the \u2014 the radio \u2014 radio officers\u2019 program,\nand officers\u2019 cadet program.

        "A: It\u2019s very \u2014 I was very f \u2014 in that th \u2014I was so thrilled with the course, that of\ncourse I paid more attention than the average person. And after a period there, I\nforget the exact number of months, but let\u2019s say during the time that I was there, we\nhad occasional nights we could go out. And I loved ice skating. Coming from\nnorthern Wisconsin, I was pretty good at it. So I did figure skating, so I went to the\nice rink in New Haven. And there I saw a young girl skating around in a short skirt\nFebruary 19, 2013\nand I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her. But I only ha-had a problem, I only had 50\ncents with me, because we hadn\u2019t been paid for weeks. So anyway, she eventually\ncame up and she had had her clothes in the same balcony seat that I had. And we\ngot acquainted and so I took her down and I blew the 50 cents on a Coke for her\nand her sister, who was along. And I was so fascinated with her that she came to my\ngraduation \u2014 we knew each other at least two weeks by that time. Came to my\ngraduation, and after graduating we went down and got all our new army uniforms,\nthey were so beautiful, long overcoat, and we just couldn\u2019t get over how great we\nlooked. Then we were, shortly thereafter, shipped to Boca Raton, Florida, because\nmy graduation score was 98.2, and the top \u2014 the top five of the gr \u2014 of the grade was\nsent to Boca Raton for radar training.",
        "A: And \u2014 and then the radar \u2014 we arrived in Boca Raton, Florida. When I say we,\nthe gentleman that become the 89\" radar officer was a buddy of mine that we stuck\nkind of together. And so we landed at the train station in our heavy bu \u2014 beaver\novercoats, then we had the wool, green, then we had the pink [indecipherable]\ntrousers. But we wouldn\u2019t take them off, cause we just \u2014\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 we looked so good and we just couldn\u2019t take them off. But that\u2019s some of the\nthings I remember, and \u2014 and then we went through a very, very grueling course on\nradio \u2014 radar. And radar was so new that information was coming from a mass \u2014 the\nMIT labs, where they invented s-some of the aspects, including the \u2014 a very\npowerful tube that could generate enormously strong pulses. Well, we then took it ri\n\u2014 almost from the design desk and we went through school, and learn \u2014 learning\nhow it worked and everything. And you may have seen the underbelly of some of\nthe planes that had a bubble under it. This was an antenna housing that the\npathfinder aircraft used eventually. So we didn\u2019t know a thing about what the \u2014 we\nwere doing. We were learning it and it wasn\u2019t important that we knew the whole\nstory. So anyway, after being down there about three weeks, I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t get over\nthe idea of the little girl I met. So I\u2014I wrote a letter up to her mother, and says, I\u2019d\nlove to have her come down, cause she is the one I want to spend my life with. So\nanyway, the father sent his approval down, along with his daughter. And we \u2014 we \u2014\nwe met and I had a little apartment all picked out and \u2014 and so we lived off base\nactually, but right away the big job was to get married, cause that was a time that\nyou never lived together. I mean, there was no \u2014 no way that could happen. So \u2014",
        "A: Well yes, she had \u2014 she \u2014 she loved the idea, I guess.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what she saw in me, but anyway, I think she liked the idea, I was a\npretty good figure skater. I could \u2014 I could skate circles and so forth, you know, and\nbackward flips and stuff. So anyway, she came on down and so we found that we\nhad to have the mother\u2019s signature as well as the father\u2019s signature on approval.",
        "A: So we immediately forged that, and \u2014 and we went down. She knew how, you\nknow, pretty well how to write. So we went down to Miami and went to the Justice\nof the Peace down there, and \u2014 and \u2014 for the ceremony. And she so happened to be\ncross-eyed, so the thing I do remember, that we were married by a cross-eyed\nJustice of the Peace, and a \u2014 and April the fifth of 1943.",
        "A: And we just celebrated our 70\" wedding anniversary. So \u2014",
        "A: Beatrice.",
        "A: Beatrice. Beatrice Jane.",
        "A: Yes, I have a son, who went with me to the museum yesterday, and then \u2014 and a\ngrandson. And this \u2014 my son was my last, my youngest. He lives in West Hills with\nhis \u2014 my grandson. And then I have a little older brother \u2014 his older brother was\nErnest E. the third, who eventually didn\u2019t like that term the third, and changed his\nname to Ernie van Dytchen(ph). He was a relative of mine was \u2014",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: We\u2019re Dutch, Swiss, I think a little mixture of everything.",
        "A: American, yeah. So anyway, then I have a daughter, and she was the a-apple of\nmy eye, Beverly. And she just gorgeous. She grew up in th \u2014 she \u2014 when I say she,\nmy wife and her family were Catholic. And I surrendered to the fact that even\nthough I was Mormon \u2014 you asked that earlier, and I forgot to tell you.",
        "A: I was brought up in the Mormon faith, but not a good \u2014 not a good follower, I\nwas arebel. And so I kind of abandoned the church and \u2014 when I was 20. And I\ndecided that yes, Ill allow her to bring up the children Catholic. So that\u2019s a story\nthere.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: But Beverly went to Catholic school \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 eventually went to Catholic University in \u2014 in Denver, Colorado. And \u2014 and\nthere she become a \u2014 a nurse. And during that time she joined a \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 the motion\npicture side of it. She acted in a play with some \u2014 some professionals in \u201cThe\nSound of Music\u201d and oh, that made it \u2014 that made the day for me.",
        "A: So, let\u2019s see, from then \u2014",
        "A: Oh, she become a nurse, and eventually spent 30 years with the University of\nColorado Medical Center.",
        "A: Now, we\u2019ll go on fr \u2014 wherever you want me to start.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: Totally illegal.",
        "A: Okay.\nFebruary 19, 2013\nproper stance, the proper position, using the Colt 45, the Thompson submachine\ngun and the \u2014 and the little 30 caliber carbine used by the paratroopers, and the M-1\nrifle that was used by the tr \u2014 by the liberators, these people that came in to save the\ncamps. So we \u2014 I \u2014I became expert on \u2014 on the se \u2014 Thompson submachine gun\nand the Colt 45 and sharpshooter on all the rest, just from my experience there.\nThen I was transferred up to \u2014 to Fort Wayne, Indiana, where our group was being\nreally put together, assigned to certain squadrons up there. Eventually then, we went\nto Sedalia, Missouri for real s \u2014 flight training. We actually took our places as\ndoing our thing, each of us doing our own thing, not knowing too much about what\neveryone else needed to do. We were being trained to be experts in what we were \u2014\nour education took us, you know. So that\u2019s the secret.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Radar. Radar officer.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: A radar officer was in charge of m-maybe 25 to 50 men. They were also trained\nin the same thing, but they weren\u2019t officers.",
        "A: And we were the teachers, we \u2014 we had to teach them all about the things that\nwe had learned about radar and so forth and they also went to school, but not as\ndetailed as we went. So then \u2014 and each squadron was the same, so then our other\njobs were constantly trying to figure a way of improving this radar and re \u2014 and\ncommunications that we had.",
        "A: Yes, and it was evolving, and so it wasn\u2019t perfect.",
        "A: So anyway \u2014 and it just goes a step further, one squadron \u2014 the thing was\nrepeated in four different squadrons that made up a group.",
        "A: The group I g \u2014 that I was with was the 438\", troop carrier group, become very\nfamous, cause we spearheaded the invasion of Europe.",
        "A: Yes, we were first into Normandy.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: The \u2014 but, getting back to the organization \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 a four \u2014 a four squadron group, the squadron had 13 airplanes that were flying,\nseveral more for reserves. So each squadron had 13 airplanes, the group had 13\ntimes four.",
        "A: All right? Now the group, four s \u2014 four groups formed a \u2014 a \u2014 they formed the\nnext division \u2014 it escapes me for a second. Anyway, there was \u2014",
        "A: The next part of the structure up.",
        "A: And then there was 50 \u2014 wing, it was a wing.",
        "A: We were the 53 troop carrier wing, and that consisted of a lot of groups. I \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know yet, I di \u2014 I was trying to get the statistics before the meeting here, but I\ncouldn\u2019t find them.",
        "A: But anyway, then a number of these wings consisted of the ninth troop carrier\ncommand. And that\u2019s the big thing I want to come out of what we\u2019re saying here,\nFebruary 19, 2013\nbecause the ninth troop carrier command had more effect on the liberation, because\nof the fact they shortened the war by so much by what they did.",
        "A: And I\u2019|l describe that later.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "A: No, we had nothing to do with submarines.",
        "A: Everything was flying now.",
        "A: Everything was air. Their job was to \u2014 to keep the radar gear in the planes in top\nworking order.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: You know, y \u2014 anything made by man is going to break down, it\u2019s like \u2014 we\nwere like a Ford garage, or you know, and we took care of the defects that showed\nup. And then every day they had to go out under my supervision and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nflight test every plane before they took off.",
        "A: As to \u2014 to maximize the \u2014 or minimize the chance of anything going wrong, and\nruining and possibly losing a lot of lives because of that.",
        "A: Exactly, you got it right.",
        "A: An additional job of mine was to \u2014 because I was inventive and I wa \u2014 I\u2019ve been\ninventive from the time I was a young boy, 12 years old, I \u2014 I really developed a\nsystem where a very close friend and pilot of mine, Lieutenant Wilmer(ph)\nKline(ph) was in an airplane with a \u2014 in the left seat, flying with a blanked out\nwindshield, he couldn\u2019t see out.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: And then we had a-another pilot that could see out. We started \u2014 we started\ntrying to find a way of landing a plane blind, cause the weather was so terrible over\nthere, th \u2014 I mean, it was an unusual day, maybe one day a week that the sun came\nout. And that\u2019s why the \u2014 the st \u2014 the invasion of Europe was delayed, the weather\nwas so bad. So anyway, I invented a system where we could, actually made,\nactually 12 blind landings utilizing that system. And it\u2019s \u2014 I have a complete write-\nup on it, so \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you'll be able to \u2014 you already have it, I think.",
        "A: But anyway, that system got kind of spread ar \u2014 I didn\u2019t know all this until just\nin the last couple years. The system was memorialized on a daily record or monthly\nrecord, summarized monthly. We had to write what we had done during the month\nin a sort of a re \u2014a permanent record form \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and they were classified as secret. Anyway, that information started to get out\nto the group. We were only a squadron, one-fourth of the group.",
        "A: Then, through my friend and so forth, he witnessed \u2014 we shared the radar\nbuilding, and he witnessed what was happening and he started to follow what I was\ndoing in \u2014 in ni\u2014 in the 88\" squadron. Eventually it went through, then it went to\nthe wing, then the wing ordered all planes to be \u2014 all pilots to be trained in utilizing\nthat particular system, because it used equipment already in the plane. It used\nnothing except equipment already in the plane.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: I did \u2014I didn\u2019t think of anything different. I-I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know anything \u2014 I was a\n22 year old at that time, and I was concentrating on what we were doing, and I \u2014 I\nnever thought that there was any major accomplishment to it. I didn\u2019t know that\nuntil just the last couple of years. But anyway, then Wing decided to call the\ngeneral of the Ninth Air Force. The Ninth Air Force controlled 1,000 of these\nairplanes, these C-47 airplanes, the most wonderful airplane ever built. And 1-1t \u2014 I-I\n\u2014 everyone should learn about the C-47 aircraft, a dece \u2014 Douglas DC-3 was the\nforerunner of it, and it could do anything. But anyway \u2014\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 we didn\u2019t \u2014 I was concentrating on the job, and not much \u2014",
        "A: At that time \u2014 no, no, all that was done overseas. A hundred percent of that was\ndone overseas.",
        "A: It was \u2014 we did a lot of flying, flight training. And believe it or not, we were not\nallowed on a test, on a final test we had to take, the pilots were not allowed to fly\nthese airplanes higher than five feet over the highest obstacle.",
        "A: Five feet, not 500, not 5,000. Five feet. And so, we were flying this high over the\nground where it\u2019s level. And so we had to pull up to get over a fence. And the\nchickens were flying, and \u2014",
        "A: They weren\u2019t happy at all, neither were the cows. So, anyway, that \u2014 I gave you\nsome background on that, cause that\u2019s important.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: So that took place on this side of the ocean, but most of the training of the pilots\nand navigators, radio operators, crew chiefs, took place in my kind of a conference\nroom that I had in addition to the shops and so forth of my office building that was\nright off the runway of our main airfield in Greenham Common, England.",
        "A: Oh, right. Yeah.",
        "A: Oh it was, it was. It was very \u2014 when I think of it now, I was thinking of it this\nmorning, that entire thing, including the camps, everything happened in a \u2014 within a\nthree year period.",
        "A: Of course, the camps went on way before that, but our reaction to it \u2014 to get \u2014",
        "A: Wi-wi-\u2014",
        "A: It was only a three year window, and I \u2014 I \u2014I marvel at how we got so much\ndone in three years.",
        "A: So anyway, we went overseas then, it had to be probably, oh, let me see, ground\n\u2014 air echelon went overseas by way of South America and across to Africa and\nthen eventually up to lame \u2014 England. They flew their planes over. The ground\nechelon which I was part of, went over by \u2014 by boat, under heavy armada of\ndestroyers and so forth, because a troop ship \u2014 they were sinking ships like crazy at\nthat time. Probably only half of the \u2014 of the material that was being shipped\noverseas got overseas because they \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 were sunk by those U-boats. So that\u2019s \u2014 so we went over about \u2014 to answer\nyour question about the first part of to \u2014 of 1943 \u2014 three. No \u2014",
        "A: 1940 \u2014 had to be in 1943. We were married in \u201943, so training ended. Probably\nthe latter part of 1943.",
        "A: Yeah.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: Yes, you\u2019re right on.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We heard about it, but it wasn\u2019t concentrated like it should have been, and \u2014 and\nof course, like we discovered later. We \u2014 we knew we had to c \u2014 we had cut the\nhead off that monster.",
        "A: We knew that, because they were very close to running the world. Had it not\nbeen for the power of our \u2014 our county\u2019s factories, and the \u2014 and the home front \u2014\nthey did a marvelous job. I give them so much credit for actually winning the war.\nBut the \u2014 the \u2014 unfortunately the word of the camps were treated more or less like\nFebruary 19, 2013\npropaganda. We \u2014 we couldn\u2019t believe anything like that could happen. It just was a\ncase of we were too naive to \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a case we were ins \u2014 insin \u2014 insincere, it\nwas a case we just didn\u2019t know any better. And of course, being 20 years old, you\ndon\u2019t get buried in politics anyway. So \u2014",
        "A: So that was the \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. It \u2014 they only knew what the army \u2014 what the top peop \u2014 top generals and\nso forth, wanted them to know. They wanted their morale to stay up and they didn\u2019t\nwant to be discouraged in \u2014 in the United States, because they were doing such a\nmarvelous job of reaching that goal of Roosevelt\u2019s of 120,000 planes a year.\nCouldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t be done, but it did, it happened. And so al \u2014 they only fed them\ninformation that was relatively good, and that\u2019s one reason \u2014 one of the primary\nreasons, I believe, they didn\u2019t want too much bad news to get out, where we had | \u2014\nmade \u2014 we lost a battle, or where we made a mistake, or something like the mistake\nFebruary 19, 2013\nthat was made where all of those British paratroopers d-died because a bad mistake\nin judgment by the superiors, and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, we heard about that and of course all we heard was the good part of it, you\nknow. We didn\u2019t hear \u2014 although we knew \u2014 we knew that Stalin was brutal, we\nknew that. We knew the Russians were probably not \u2014 you know, following that\ncourse, was not the nicest people on earth. So, I\u2014 we \u2014 we followed that Battle of\nStalingrad cause we were so delighted over the fact that the Germans were losing.\nAnd so that was good news to come across.",
        "A: But the news of all the people that was lost at our air base during a short period\nof time, that didn\u2019t get back to the public. No one knew about that.",
        "A: It was in England.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: Well, the worst things Pll \u2014 Pll tell you about. The \u2014 there was \u2014 there was a\ntremendous concentration of aircraft bombing the coast and bombing inland and so\nforth. Planes were flying overhead all the time, going back and forth, a constant\ndrone, you couldn\u2019t sleep. I mean, around the clock. The two C-47s, cause of the\nweather, bad weather, two 40 se \u2014 C-40 \u2014 not C-47s, but two B-17s, bombers,\ncollided right \u2014 almost directly over our base.",
        "A: And the debris scattered over a very large area. And hearing the \u2014 I was one of\nthe few people that heard the crash. It was a tremendous explosion, and \u2014 and so\npieces of everything, engines and bodies and stuff were coming down all over the\narea. I was one of the very first on the scene, because I onl \u2014 my off \u2014 radar building\nwas only a short distance away. I had a Jeep that I had assigned to me. I jumped in\nthe Jeep and drove over to the \u2014 where I knew the sound had come from, and then I\nstarted to see that debris all over. And the first sight I saw of a body was a young\nnavigator. The navigator \u2014 I knew he was a navigator because the body was quite\nintact, and it was lying on his back. And he was partially buried because the force of\ndropping to the ground. And he \u2014 his \u2014 he was a little \u2014 little gray looking and so\nFebruary 19, 2013\nforth. But he looked like he was sleeping, like peacefully sleeping. But his ta \u2014 his\nwatch was still running, that\u2019s [indecipherable] a strange thing. And then, little\nbeyond I saw a body that was decapitated from hitting \u2014 from going through a tree\nbranch. And \u2014 and \u2014 and then \u2014 then a lot of the pe \u2014 lot of the people from the base\nstarted to come over and we all were scattered through to see if there was any\nSUIVIVOTS.",
        "A: Yes, there was a pilot, I think, one pilot, or maybe th \u2014 I can\u2019t recall now for\nsure, but I think at least one pilot survived. And the pilot that didn\u2019t survive, I \u2014\nI\u2019ve, in the last couple years I got \u2014 I\u2019ve got to know who \u2014 who \u2014 who their\nrelatives were and they\u2019ve written to me and so forth. They found out through\nanother \u2014 I had another interview with the BBC, and somehow or other that got out\nand they \u2014 they got ahold of me, and it was kind of \u2014 kind of sad.",
        "A: But \u2014 but anyway, from that, that was number one. Number two 1s the \u2014",
        "A: Yeah?\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: Yes, 20 \u2014 as I recall, there was 22. Because I got a figure of 51 in my mind that\ncombined the two crashes that happened the same week.",
        "A: Well, military aircraft usually flew in formation, and the formation consisted of,\nlet\u2019s say \u2014 our formations consisted of 13 airplanes, but th-that means they weren\u2019t\ntoo far apart. And the weather was so bad that they cou \u2014 you couldn\u2019t see. In other\nwords, you just lost the sight, and somehow or other, two planes brushed together\nand \u2014 and caused an explosion.",
        "A: And that scattered them all over, you know, so then I give you an \u2014 a article\nabout Bob Owens, the \u2014 our engineering officer that was \u2014 was big 1n all of our \u2014\nour missions and so forth, so he \u2014 well, I'll follow that later.",
        "A: Or no, he \u2014 IJ-I\u2019ll pick that up now, because the Horsa glider was a British made,\nall wood, but a very large aircraft. Instead of carrying only 15 paratroopers, they\ncould carry 30.",
        "A: Well, they had 29 in that, plus two pilots. And \u2014",
        "A: That makes a total of 31. The 31 plus the 22 made the 53 that sticks in my mind\nas far as the loss. Anyway, the \u2014 he had told them, he had \u2014 they \u2014 they sent the\naircraft in and he wa \u2014 he noted in inspection of the aircraft that there was about a\nthree inch space between the tail mounting and the fuselage, where it\u2019s supposed to\nbe tight. The glue had \u2014 this was all glued together, it\u2019s a wood aircraft. Like this,\nglue had separated and he issued what they called a red tag. And every one of the\nHorsa gliders on the base was red tagged. But Wing, next step up, decided that they\nhad to have a practice run of a troop car \u2014 of 647 aircraft pulling a s \u2014 the c \u2014 this\ndigger glider. And so they assigned two 88\" pilots, glider pilots to the task.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: It was part of our \u2014 our assigned \u2014 we didn\u2019t pay any attention who \u2014 who\nfurnished it, but we had a certain amount of planes, certain number of gliders,\ncertain number of CG-4 gliders, which is the smaller \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 certain \u2014 along with the others. They wanted a test to show the capability of the\nC-47 aircraft towing that fully loaded glider. This fully loaded glider would go\nokay, even with that tail problem. So they were able to fly the gliders into the\nairport, but he said that the minute you take off, it probably will not be more than\njust a few seconds and that tail is gonna separate. Well, just exactly like he forecast,\nthe \u2014 the tail broke off when the \u2014 when the tu \u2014 the [indecipherable] plane and the\nglider was probably about a hundred feet in the air. And course, then they drove\nstraight into a little knoll. I recall the plane had dove straight into that kno-knoll,\nand every single one of those occupants was in the fr \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 ina mass of flesh in the front \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 of that glider. I wasn\u2019t there \u2014 I wasn\u2019t certainly the first there, but they had\nremoved the bodies and then I \u2014 hearing about the crash, I drove over to that also,\nwhich 1s in the same area, in the same debris field as the crash of the two B-17s.\nFebruary 19, 2013\nAnd the guard \u2014 there was a guard assigned to it by then, and he says, well there\nwas a \u2014 there\u2019s some \u2014 a human hip or something like a \u2014 a big roast \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 still there. They\u2019d removed all the human remains, but they\u2019d missed that. So\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s number 30 some. Anyway, but the thing that was so \u2014 so \u2014 so\nremarkable is seeing 13 ambulances, wi \u2014 each with four bodies of people that were\nhighly trained, moving off the field toward the cemetery.",
        "A: And that was imp \u2014 very impressive, I mean, in their own sort of way. Those are\nthings that were not relayed to the American public.",
        "A: Oh, we couldn\u2019t speak about anything, no, they \u2014 they took every one of our\nletters, and when they \u2014 when the relatives got them, there was a lot of black mark,\ncause they took out a lot of information, you could not mention anything.",

        "A: Well, one step further, the man that tried to stop it, Bob Owens was on his way\nto a court martial, because he had ignored an order to allow the 88\" pilots or planes\nto fly. The unfortunate thing is, they chose two fi\u2014 pilots from the 89\" squadron,\nand a plane from the 89\" squadron. There\u2019s now a memorial there to that particular\nthing that the prince \u2014 Princess Margaret was there at the dedication of it. But they\ngot it a little wrong, I\u2019m afraid they \u2014 they sh \u2014 I think they showed 88\" pilots still\non that marker, but it was only \u2014 it was actually 89\".",
        "A: It \u20141t \u2014 it \u2014 1t\u2014 1t was in southern England, and Greenham Common was close\nto a town called Salisbury, and then that was a short distance towards London was\n\u2014 we were west of London about \u2014 probably about a hundred miles.

        "A: These are little details you forget. Anyway \u2014",
        "A: Well, you know, the whole picture never came to me. Each one of these were\nseparate little things, and I wrote about it a step at a time. I was going to use each\none of these little things as a separate chapter in my book that I was writing \u2014 I was\ngoing to write. But lack of time and the fact that I\u2019m still working, I\u2019m still o-own\nmy own business, I never got to write the book, but I didn\u2019t want these details to be\nlost, and so \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was just \u2014 back in those days it was just me doing one job and nothing big\nabout it, nothing. Nothing unusual about it, that\u2019s what I was supposed to do.",
        "A: But then when I look at the whole picture, the ninth troop carrier order\n[indecipherable] 1,000 planes, ordered, that the entire group of 1,000 planes be eq-\nequipped, or be given the information, taught the information, I also came up with a\n\u2014 an idea to extend the range where they \u2014 you could see the signal from farther out\nwhen they\u2019re coming back, to try to find the airfield in bad weather. I was able to\nextend that by so-called piquing of the frequencies. I don\u2019t know now how I did it,\nbut I did it back then. There \u2014 there were several things that the \u2014 right up to\nFebruary 19, 2013\nGeneral Williams, who came to the base, and w \u2014 and \u2014 and interviewed everyone\nand so forth, and tried to figure out what all this fuss was about.

But they kind of took credit for the fact that this \u2014 these things\nhappened, and they ordered the RAF and every \u2014 every part of their fleet to be\nusing the same equipment. And so it\u2019s just recently that I could see the whole\npicture and had an interest in seeing the whole picture, that I finally decided that\nthis was a lot more than I had ever given credit for, that every plane that flew in the\nETO, European theater of operation at that time, u-utilized these advancements.",
        "A: Well then, because of that, the C-40s \u2014 the 438s performed flawlessly in the\ninvasion of Normandy. They lost no planes, they missed no targets, and the radio \u2014\nthe radar on all their planes worked perfectly, and they can \u2014 come back and\neventually got the only st \u2014 unit citation ever received by a troop carrier group.",
        "A: And groups were very \u2014 kind of tiny, there\u2019s dozens and dozens of groups, so we\n\u2014 we were kind of singled out for that. Based on that, I finally realized that what I\nhad done probably helped a lot to our getting that citation.\nFebruary 19, 2013",

        "A: Encourage \u2014 oh, I got to give the upper level a lot of credit. Anything they saw\nthat would improve the chances of a man getting back, and his aircraft and his crew\ngetting back safely, was encouraged and certainly adopted, if it worked. And later\nthey \u2014 I lost my train of thought for a moment.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 well, I wou \u2014 I would \u2014 I was trying to think of a\ncertain instance where it was very, very easily \u2014 oh, th-th-the \u2014 this outcome was, of\ncourse, of course, the outcome was that probably untold number of lives were saved\nby pilots that could find their way back and didn\u2019t \u2014 di-didn\u2019t have to ditch, or\nFebruary 19, 2013\ndidn\u2019t have to crash land or \u2014 or something like that. So then I told myself, you\nknow, I never killed anyone. I never had to shoot someone, that\u2019s terrible, that\u2019s\nhard to live with. I never done anything, but I believe that I\u2019ve saved lots of lives.\nAnd that \u2014 since that time I\u2019ve had no ma \u2014 nightmares, I\u2019ve slept very soundly. I\nhave no regrets for anything \u2014 any judgment I made or anything. So that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 which was a big mistake. Operation mark \u2014 Market Basket, I went along with\nmy friend that was [indecipherable] landing pilot, I went along with him because\nthe CEO thought it\u2019d be nice to have more than one navigator in the squadron, in\ncase the first plane got shot down. So he asked if I\u2019d go along as a wing navigator.",
        "A: It was where they tried to save all these bridges. A Bridge Too Far is probably\nmore im \u2014 memorable.",
        "A: It\u2019s on the Rhine river, where they tried to \u2014 want to shorten the war by saving\nthe bridges so they didn\u2019t have to rebuild bridges across the Rhine.",
        "A: And that particular mission was to preserve those bridges, that \u2014 and so that the\ntanks, Patton\u2019s tanks, when they got there, couldn\u2019t blast across without having to\nbuild pontoon bridges.",
        "A: He was moving very fast, and we were terribly important in the fact that he was\nable to move so fast because a C-47 carried paratroopers into areas of drop. Then,\non the way back, they \u2014 they came back and picked up the gliders and they threw it\n\u2014 flew them in. Then they came back and they flew into \u2014 like I took a mission into\nFebruary 19, 2013\n\u2014 on D-Day plus six, we flew into Omaha Beach, and we flew into a\u2014a-\u2014a\nlanding strip that had been cut hastily in the bluffs above Omaha Beach. And we\nlanded there with flight nurses aboard, and picked up the terribly wounded \u2014 most\nterribly wounded of Omaha Beach, and we just had a constant stream of airplanes\nflying in and out, and bringing those people back to hospitals in England. And\nwhile I was there, I stepped out of the airplane, trying to help with the loading of the\n\u2014 of the litter patients and so forth. And a captain on the ground, in the infantry\nyelled at me, get back in that airplane, because you s \u2014 have greens on. The green \u2014\nI didn\u2019t have the camouflage on, and he says, there\u2019s snipers in the area. So, of\ncourse, I was forced back into the airplane then. But that \u2014 I\u2019m telling that because\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the C-47 done so many other things. On [indecipherable] rush across,\nhe outrun all of his tankers. He\u2019d run out of gas and then couldn\u2019t go any further.\nThen we started loading up 6,000 pounds of gasoline on each airplane and flew a\nconstant stream of these airplanes and flew a constant stream of these airplanes\nright behind Patton\u2019s army as he raced across Europe. We\u2019d land in \u2014 in pastures,\nwe'd land on roads. And this \u2014 these planes were so powerful, they could pull\nthemselves out of mud.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: So they flew supplies, gasoline supplies and then loaded the medical patients,\nhad litters that come down from the side on inside, they loaded the litter patients up\nand got out of there, and back to hospitals in England, you know. I\u2019m trying to say\nthat the airplane itself was such a big story, what it could do. And \u2014 and then,\nnaturally, it was a natural carrier, so thousands and thousands and thousands of\ndisplaced people and survivors of the camps and survivors of the \u2014 of the slave\nlabor camps, very close together, they \u2014 in one \u2014 the area we went in, the slave\nlaborers and \u2014 and the ovens were right close by because they had to use the si \u2014\novens to dispose of the slave laborers that was too \u2014 too weak to work any more.\nAnd then they had the V-2 factory underground right there, you know.",
        "A: And like the lady from the museum that said about a young girl, she was 16 and\n\u2014 and \u2014 and that\u2019s actually the people that we \u2014 that I was involved in helping get\nback into France and different areas.",

We had to fly to save bridges instead of flying the gasoline into\nPatton where he could keep going.",
        "A: The war would have ended one year earlier, had it not been for that mistake.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: It was in \u2014 it was June the se \u2014 around the f-first of June and the second part of\nMay of 1945.",
        "A: The war had ended by then, and we had lots of transport available and these \u2014\nthe need for getting those people out of there as fast as possible, was great. So \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We knew we \u2014 by that time there was a lot of information out. And so \u2014 I mean,\nmonths and months earlier we knew about it. And \u2014 and that was, of course, one of\nthe great reasons that \u2014 and I\u2019m sure that it was on everyone\u2019s mind that if \u2014 if we\ndon\u2019t k \u2014 if we don\u2019t knock the head off that monster, that these people, there will\nbe nobody left. So we were aware of it, and we were very shocked by it. Of course,\nwe were very shocked by it, way before June.",
        "A: We took off from Amiens, France. We had moved just right \u2014 just before that,\nwe\u2019d moved into Amiens, France in an old World War II battlefield. We had the\nold World War I\u2014 I\u2019m sorry, not two, one, World War I, correction. We had the\nFebruary 19, 2013\ntrenches from World War I all \u2014 all around us, virtually, and there was this level\npatch of ground that they laid down the airstrip, made of steel \u2014 interlocking steel\nsections. And we had to be careful, cause if we went off our general area of\noperations, there was unexploded ordinance around, and people were getting \u2014 still\ngetting killed from World War I armaments.",

So that \u2014 that\u2019s where we took off from, and the idea\nwas to be closer to carrying troo \u2014 gasoline with the various tanks and so forth.\nPatton went so fast that the \u2014 his big express that they had designed to keep\ngasoline flowing to him, just couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t keep up, and he was being slowed\ndown, and they got together and just a day or two later they come up with the idea\nof flying them in by troop carrier and flying out the wounded.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it was primarily to go. We went there empty.",
        "A: No, we probably carried supplies in. [indecipherable] I don\u2019t recall, we \u2014 I -- we\nalmost never flew empty.",
        "A: And we knew that that area was being liberated and so forth, so we knew the\nneed probably would be great. I\u2019m sure we took medical supplies at least, and\nthings of that sort in.",

And then \u2014 then again, water and so forth, important\nthings that they needed, we supplied during the time. And candy bars, but we had to\nbe very careful, because they gave us orders not to feed them, because in feeding\nthem too rich a diet \u2014 they had to have a special diet \u2014 these are little details I can\nrecall \u2014 special diet, and then they were fed, instead of gallons of water at a time,\nyou know, just small amounts of water at a time and so forth. So \u2014 but it \u2014 it was\nvery pathetic, and the \u2014 and the most \u2014 the most memorable part of the trip is when\nI made the announcement \u2014 had to go back among them, made the announcement\nthat we were just crossing the French border of Germany.

And they hated it, to be taken\nback to Russian lines, they just hated that, because once they got to Russian lines,\nthey communicated with the flight crews that they had to walk all the way back into\ntheir country, back to the ar\u2014 Red Army. They landed at Red Army lines \u2014",

There\u2019s those that\ncould not \u2014 they could still walk but were \u2014 weren\u2019t strong enough to survive a\nflight of any duration, they had to be under hospital care. As you know, the \u2014 as we\ndiscovered after we got to Halle that the camps were actually quarantined, and the\ndoctors move in \u2014 moved in to the quarantined areas and took care of people, trying\nto save as many lives as possible, and \u2014 until they were brought along strong\nenough to move out of the area.

We had to go to Europe \u2014 had to\ngo to \u2014 at that time we had to go to the South Pacific. And so, the month of June,\nlatter part of June especially, we were packing all the supplies up and so forth, to be\ntransported back to the United States. And then probably in July \u2014 July, August,\nJuly, August, September \u2014 probably about in early August, the \u2014 this is subject to\ncorrection, but it\u2019s in that time frame anyway. The air echelon, or the \u2014 all the\nairplanes loaded up all the gear that they could take aboard that was high \u2014 high \u2014\nFebruary 19, 2013\nhigher value, and they took off and flew via Iceland to Nova Scotia, back that\nroute, to \u2014 I don\u2019t even know what field they landed on, but anyway, the ground\nechelon which I was on, were packed up and put aboard a liberty ship, or is \u2014 it was\na victory ship, a victory ship. There was two types of ships; the liberty was the\nslowest and ugliest. The victory ship was a troop carrier and \u2014 and did about\neverything, but it was faster. It took less s \u2014 escort. They \u2014 they took around some \u2014\nsomewhere in August and we then board, this slower ship came in probably\nsometime in September. And we landed \u2014 we landed in Boston, and you know,\nsome \u2014 some ways the \u2014 what we did over there was clearer than what happened\nafterwards. And anyway, we landed in Boston, and course [indecipherable] every\ntime we came back there was a huge demonstration, the Red Cross people were\nthere and we got the first milk we had taste \u2014 real milk, since we left.",
        "A: Everything was powdered. Then my wife met me. I can recall she had a black \u2014\nbig black hat on, dressed in black, beautiful. And again, we then drove \u2014 we di \u2014 I\nthink she came with her parents or some \u2014 somebody that was able to drive. We\ndrove back to their home in Russell Street in Connecticut. And there we decided\nwhat we\u2019re \u2014 talked about what our future was going to be. And \u2014 and back there,\nwe decided to \u2014 I had saved a lot of money, I didn\u2019t smoke or drink when I was\nFebruary 19, 2013\noverseas. So all the money that I was allotted for that went into a s \u2014 a belt around\nmy waist, and I was able to \u2014 and then I turned them into money mor \u2014 money\norders. By the time I got to the States, we were \u2014 I had quite a little, I had probably\nseveral thousand dollars, I don\u2019t know. Anyway, we bought a \u2014 the latest vehicle\nmanufactured, Pontiac, the last wave of passenger vehicles that were manufactured\nbefore the war, turned into wartime status.

        "A: I never give \u2014 I didn\u2019t have nightmares like so many did. We were able to look\nto the future and say okay, where do we go from here? I decided to get into business\nrather than \u2014 rather than take the G.I. Bill of Right \u2014 bill that sent so many people to\ncollege. And so we finally went across the country with this little car and \u2014 and Is \u2014\nwas able \u2014 we were staying at \u2014 we ha-had a destination of my uncle\u2019s place. My\nuncle, his name is Callie(ph). And they lived on \u2014 in Santa Monica. So we came in\nFebruary 19, 2013\nwith him, and he was a painter, and I spent several days painting. And so I started\nmaking money just about soon as I got back, because our \u2014 our pay was delayed\nagain. By that time I was a captain and \u2014 and the pay wasn\u2019t too bad from the\nservice. Anyway, leading beyond that as fast as we can, we received a lot of the\nfour engine air \u2014 U.S. Air Force planes back to Douglas aircraft field. We re \u2014 we\nstarted to renovate them, I was involved in \u2014 I knew wiring and so forth, so I was\ninvolved in the electrical side, and we spent several \u2014 I spent almost a year with\nthem, and about 1946 \u2014 \u201947. Meantime our dau \u2014 we had a daughter born in 1946,\nBeverly \u2014 Beverly June, and she is now retired. And also working, they\u2019ve had to\ncall her back. She was a nurse at University of Colorado medical center. Anyway,\ngoing on from that, in 1949, I opened my first business, which was a ra-radi \u2014 a\nradio-television operation. And I spent quite a number of years with \u2014 with the star\ncommunity like Clark Gable, and all these big stars, including this Disney \u2014 I\nmean, including the gr \u2014 the \u2014 Jack Carson, John Wayne, and many, many, I\nmean, we had the world\u2019s [indecipherable] release for signed photographs.",
        "A: Yes. I owned a\u2014I opened it up and it ran for about 10 years.",
        "A: Valley Video Service.\nFebruary 19, 2013",
        "A: And later we opened B and D Electronics. B and D being Beatrice and Dutch, B\nand D electronics. And we handled the entire 13 western states and distribution of\nelectronic parts for television and radio and \u2014 and accessories. And then I eventually\nwanted to see more of what goes on in the real world, so I stepped out into various\njobs that led up to me designing a anti-collision device in the 60s, and I think it was\n1965 when the \u2014 the first jet aircraft flying passengers came out. Two \u2014 two TWA\nplanes had crashed over the gand \u2014 over the Grand Canyon. And I said, what a\nterrible, terrible problem, and what a terrible thing to happen, when there was a\nsolution.",
        "A: And again, I used what was available in my radar training and so forth, same \u2014\nsame equipment, same stuff, and I designed an anti-collision device. And \u2014 and it \u2014\nbelieve it or not, 1t was just the same basic idea; why not take what\u2019s already proven\nby war, by everything and turn it into something to save lives? Anyway, there\nagain, after m \u2014 drawing the design kind of roughly, I decided before I waste any\nmore time that I would go back to Washington, and meet with the \u2014 the FAA, and\nso they set up an appointment a half an hour. And we got \u2014 my \u2014 my brother then\nmet me at that point, and \u2014 cause he was a pilot that had not finished his training\nFebruary 19, 2013\nbefore he was sent overseas. And he met me, and we met with the FAA, and I\nshowed the the design, I showed them the \u2014 where \u2014 where I had had success of that\nin Europe, it had actually worked, and so forth. And the half hour meeting turned\ninto four hours, the whole afternoon was taken, and at the end they says, look, we\nknow \u2014 we\u2019re pretty sure that this will probably save 95 percent of our collisions, he\nsays, but unless you get to a hundred percent, there\u2019s no way we can ever get it\nthrough Congress, or get it approved. So \u2014 and I \u2014 and I also met with people at M-\nMagnavox Corporation, a big electronics firm. They al-also designed a system. So I\nhad communications with them, and they had the same \u2014 same luck. Eventually I \u2014 I\nmade a ri \u2014a di\u2014a revelation \u2014 or I made a disclosure to Bendix Aircraft, and I\nsays, here I\u2019m disclosing this, what can you do with it? You have more power than\nany little one person. Well, they di\u2014 had the same results, they said yes, 1t would\nwork, and so all I got was the satisfaction of knowing the thing would work.",
        "A: Beyond that, I got into my own business. I \u2014 I joined as a chairman of a public\nelectronics firm that made specialized cathode ray tubes, the display device that\nthey use in air traffic control. We design little tiny tubes that they use on helicopter\npilot sites \u2014 air \u2014 gun sites. And we designed \u2014 we also designed a \u2014 a ground radar\nFebruary 19, 2013\ntype of system that would cut the earth down, I don\u2019t remember how many feet, but\nthen show the side of it in layers, for finding oil.",
        "A: And that was a sale \u2014 we made a sale of that device to Brown Root, a division of\n[indecipherable]. And that \u2014 let\u2019s see \u2014 lost my train of thought, what was the last \u2014",

And the fact\nthat I had worked at two heat \u2014 specialized heat manufacturers as vice president of \u2014\nof new \u2014 new product design and so forth \u2014 two separate ones, I had a lot of\nknowledge about that particular product, and we were able to solve that problem,\nand that was sold to Brown and Root, where it went from there, that\u2019s where my \u2014\nmy memory trailed off, I don\u2019t know.\nFebruary 19, 2013",

One to guard against reversal of\nthe polarity of the power coming out of the boat from the dock. Cause if it was the\nwrong reverse, 1 \u2014 the \u2014 it would eat up the prop and everything else, it had to be the\nright di \u2014 the right polarity. And I designed a de-device that would automatically\nreverse it in the device, rather than have \u2014 have the damage. The other one was \u2014\nwhat the heck was it? The other one was pretty interesting, but I can\u2019t remember the\ndetails.",

He\nwrote that entire \u2014 supposed to be truthful series, all about the paratroopers, 101\u2018\nand 82\", which were marvelous and they \u2014 they thought the world of us. All about\nthat, but he never interviewed one air \u2014 one [indecipherable] pilot to get the story\nof who carried them in and what happened on some of their problems.

And they\u2019re the people, the paratroopers were interviewed. But I have\nsomething I want to read into the \u2014 into the record, about what a paratrooper said\nabout us. And my biggest goal of this entire operation is to focus on the fact that the\n90\" troop carrier squadron of four forces \u2014 I\u2019m saying forces, or incidents or\nwhatever, four of the most important, famous in World War II, one of them was the\n90\" troop carrier command, and they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019ve been downgraded an-and kicked\nFebruary 19, 2013\nand so forth.

And he would race along the sh \u2014 it\u2019d race along the\nshore to about 40 knots, or 50 miles an hour, so very fast in the water. And they\nwould turn on these \u2014 these things as if there were 10,000 boats out there. Very,\nvery loud and very deceiving.

And they were all headed\nfor this \u2014 this fake landing site he designed. He also designed rubber paratroopers of\ndifferent sizes, make it look like there was a lot of them. They were inflatable, and\nthen they dropped those from the planes at some point, that looked like there\u2019s the\nplace it\u2019s gonna be, so the Germans would move all their reinforcements over there.\nFebruary 19, 2013\nWhich then, of course, made the \u2014 the real invasion point much safer for the planes\ncoming in.

And from there, we did our\ntraining and so forth. And then, I was picked out from the four radar officers of our\n438\" oroup, to be the one to go on detached service for the navy. That was a navy\noperation. So I was then broke away from the group, and moved down \u2014 or broke\naway from our squadron and moved down to Corsica. And at Corsica there\u2019s a\nbase for these \u2014 a harbor for these boats and this \u2014 adjacent to the harbor were their\nliving quarters, and \u2014 and mess halls and so forth.

And to \u2014 we\npracticed targets, we practiced torpedoing the ship and we\u2019d go straight at the ship\nat high speed, and then make a hard left, and let the torpedo go before we made our\nturn. That way we were out away from the blast zone. Then, at night, you know,\nwere \u2014 we were kind of very flexible. At night we would pull into a little canal\nFebruary 19, 2013\nwhere there\u2019s trees and shrubbery over us, and we\u2019d stay the night there, and about\ndaybreak we\u2019d go back out to our training.

But they would help unload the planes with the gasoline,\nand they carried about fi \u2014 6,000 gal \u2014 6,000 pounds of gasoline. At eight pounds\nper gallon, you can calculate how many Jerry cans there were. Anyway, they were\nthe standard Jerry cans, laid inside the cabin on the floor.

So I used to go frequently into as soon \u2014 as\noften as we had any sort of a pass, I'd take the train into London and take the\nsubway, the famed British subway system, which was also their air raid shelters,\nwe'd take \u2014 Id take it out to the rink, which was, as I say, a suburb. And after tha \u2014\nafter that, I-I would come back to the Red Cross building, where as soon as we\nheard the sirens, everyone was supposed to dive for the shelters. We got to the point\nFebruary 19, 2013\nwhere we were playing Russian roulette, that it would \u2014 it\u2019s not going to hit us, you\nknow, type of thing, you know. And so, when the V-2s come over, they were st \u2014\nsort of a staccato sound, very staccato. And when they stopped being staccato 1s\nwhen we had to worry, because then they were \u2014 the power\u2019d been cut off and they\njust indiscriminately fell into the heart of London. And of course, there was\nthousands of British civilians killed during that time. I think they lost many more\ncivilians than they did soldiers.",

        "A: The only thing that I\u2019d like to have you \u2014 have them know, that our experiences\nover there and experiences since that time, have made \u2014 made a non-Jewish person,\nand non-j \u2014 most of our buddies that were over there with us, feel more sympathy\nfor the Jewish race, and more \u2014 more admiration for the Jewish race. And part of the\nadmiration was, we were trying to tell ourselves, why would they go through \u2014 why\nwould they go through that torture and everything without committing suicide? We\ncouldn\u2019t figure that out. Well, the answer came in the fact that their \u2014 their great\nfaith and their great will, and \u2014 and that\u2019s \u2014 kind of answers the question, so \u2014 but\nthe younger generation \u2014 I \u2014 I was \u2014 my grandson I mentioned took me to a -- what\nthey call a \u2014 a bring and tell to a f\u2014 a first grade class. And he brought me in, the\nother kids brought toys and different things like that, he brought me in. And he says,\nthis is my grandpa and he wants to tell you something about the war.

But I only\nmentioned this bad man out of Germany. And he took all those people and \u2014 and\nhe put them in camps, and he \u2014 they killed them, and this was terrible. But he s \u2014 it\n\u2014 it was a bad \u2014 it was a bad war. And then at the end, a little Korean first grader\ncame up to me and says, who won the war? I says, well, we did. He says, cool. So,\nanyway. But yeah, I think the thing I \u2014 should be done na \u2014 thing I should \u2014 thing\nshould be done now, and I\u2019ve offered to do it over the years, is to speak to high\nschool groups and high school history groups, a-as part of their curriculum. And\nI\u2019ve never had a invitation, so \u2014",
