        "Q: Could you tell me your name please?",
        "A: Uh my name is Hanna Brum.",
        "Q: And where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, uh May 30th, 1922.",
        "Q: Could you tell me something about your family, and growing up?",
        "A: I was very fortunate because we lived with my grandmother and grandfather in the same\nhouse. I was the only child. My mother had a child a year before me, but he died just before\ndelivery. So I was the first grandchild in the family. And I...all my first memories are about\nmy grandfather, and I feel very warmly about him. He died when I...three months before my\nthird birthday. But nevertheless, all my memories are about my grandfather. And we simply\nhad a love affair. Uh he would watch me to go across the street to buy his cigars. His cigars\nwere \"Virginki,\" which means that they were tobacco from Virginia. Uh we called them\n\"Virginki.\" And he watched me to cross the street and give my little money on the counter,\nand bring him uh his cigars. And he very proudly looked after me, that I was able to do it.\nSo at the very early childhood, he really pushed me to independence, to do things for\nmyself. I remember he had a little wooden stool with a crack in it. And I loved peanuts, but I\nwas very small to crack them. So I put the peanuts in that little crack, and he gave me a\nmallet; and I would push the peanuts and I could have to open it myself. And these are\nmemories that nobody could have really told me that uh about my grandfather. Or we went\nwalking; and uh I even remember the streets where we went. And he would give me a little\ncoin; and I would go inside and give my little penny on the counter, and uh--whatever it\nwas--and buy, you know, a little piece of candy. And he waited for me outside. And uh his\nbirthday was in March, and he died just shortly afterwards. And I came to him to give him\nmy little poem. I had to learn little tiny poems for the family, for the members of the family.\nThat was my gift for their birthdays--to learn a poem. And I went to tell it to him, and he\nalready didn't respond. I think he had a stroke. And I came out crying, because my\ngrandmother...uh my grandfather didn't kiss me and he didn't say, \"Thank you.\" That I don't\nremember. That I was told. It's interesting. I don't remember the kind of a rejection, which I\nthought at that time. That I only remember loving things about him. And my grandmother\nwas with us all my growing up. She had her birthday five days before mine; so we\ncelebrated, more or less, birthday together. She always kept a piece of her cake for me. She\nwas the one who told me stories. Uh I would crawl into her bed, and she would tell me a\nfairy tale I had heard about fifty-five times; but I wanted to hear it for the fifty-sixth time\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfrom her. Uh when I started going to school, she would cross the big street to help me cross\nback again. And I was more concerned about her crossing safely, but she was concerned my\ncrossing safely. So it got a little complicated there. But she was in many ways the mother on\nwhom I patterned my life. And she had in her...she had a very orderly closet. And in the\ncloset, she had a bag with her white shroud; and she knew according to the Jewish religion\nthis is how she would want to be buried, and wanted to be buried with my grandfather in the\nsame grave. She never had a chance to use that shroud even though we sent it with her to\nTheresienstadt [Czech: Terezin]. But I knew that['s] what she wanted. Uh that was a sort of\na thing to do every Sunday morning. We would go to Grandfather's grave, and we'd put\nlittle stones. That's a tradition--you put a little stone. And if she was not able to go, I always\nput a little stone for her on my grandfather's grave. And uh after the...after I returned I\nalways...when I'm in Prague go, and go to my grandfather's grave. And since we were not\nable to put her there, we had her...I had her name put on the same gravestone. And my\nrelatives in Prague are maintaining the grave, even though many...even though so many are\nneglected. And uh so she 1s there, at least in memoriam, as she wished to be.",
        "Q: What, as you grew up, as you became a young woman, what was your schooling like? What\nwere your friends like?",
        "A: For the first five years I went to a Jewish school. It was more Zionistic Jewish school, not a\nreligious school. We were twenty boys and ten girls. Out of the ten girls, we were five\nHannas--because it was a very popular name. And out of the five girls, as far as...as far I can\nsay, I'm the only one who survived. Out of the twenty boys, I know about five survived. I\nam in contact with one of them; and just recently, he sent me a picture of the second and the\nfourth grade, which was a real find for me. After that, I went to gymnasium--which was the\nacademic level. And uh then I went into a business school, and I started working and be\nvery... I was always very, very independent, very, very quickly. And my father led me to\nindependence. Uh, I--as an eleven, twelve year old, I went to collect from his...from the\nbuilders money, so he would have for his payroll. And in the beginning they looked at this\nlittle girl who's coming to collect money, and would call my father: \"Is that on the level?\"\nAnd he said, \"Yes.\" And I gave them a receipt, signed it. He told them it's OK, because\nnobody had an idea that I was bringing payroll money. So he was leading me, again, pretty\nmuch to independence. Because my mother was uh a rather sickly woman who had frequent\npneumonias, who have had at least uh five, six miscarriages after me. I was the only live\nbirth uh child. So I was uh uh freely very much led to independence, almost compensating\nfor her; because she was really very shy, very sickly and had enormously uh uh heavy thick\nglasses because she was so near-sighted. Uh I was...my character was much more like my\naunt--my mother's sister--and my father, who was much more outgoing.",
        "Q: As you grew older, um you began to become involved with the young men?",
        "A: Uh I was...uh I was fortunate in my age we were still able to have some social life and go to\ndancing schools. It's all, you know, with the long dress and uh formalities. I was still about\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe last year that['s] where we were able to do it. And at that time, I was going with uh a\nstudent who was three years my age--so I was about sixteen, he was nineteen--by the name\nof Rudolph Schiff. We called him \"Rudla.\" And uh when I was seventeen, and uh the gates\nwere closing on us uh and uh...things were starting really getting bad, we got married\nNovember 14th, 1939, at the City Hall. Again, there was no housing for us. I went home.\nHe went home in the evening, because there was no possibility. In his uh...his families lived\na couple of blocks away from us, so that was no big problem. And uh as uh the Germans\nwere closing in, we had to go into more and more cramped quarters. And his parents had a\nbig apartment what had it sub-divided. And each bedroom was given to another family. And\nuh the uh...so there was really no where to go. Then one of the families were sent with\ntransport to camp, so for couple of months we had one of the bedrooms. In the meantime,\nhe got scarlet fever. And at that time, when you had scarlet fever uh you had to go for six\nweeks into a hospital. Today, somebody with scarlet fever--it's [like] a strep throat. A\ncouple of days, and you are fine. They thought that you were infectious for six weeks, until\nyour started to peel. I had scarlet fever when I was in the first grade, so I knew what it meant\nfor six weeks to be in isolation--which I was. By the way, I was in that isolation at\nchildren|'s] hospital; and the children['s] hospital was run by nuns. And the nuns said...came\nto us and uh said, \"OK, children, get off your beds, kneel and pray.\" And I said to the nun,\n\"I'm sorry, I'm Jewish. I don't kneel.\" And so she said, \"What are you going to do?\" I said,\n\"I'm going to pray in bed the way my grandmother taught me.\" And that was that. I did not\nfollow the party line, and in many ways the nuns respected that. I was only seven--barely\nseven at that time, because I had my birthday in the hospital. And uh so he had scarlet fever.\nHe had to go to the hospital; and while he was in the hospital, they brought in his room a\nlittle four year old--little Frankie. Cute little Frankie. The parents were Polish uh emigres\nwho came to Czechoslovakia; and while he was in the hospital, they had to go with a\ntransport and leaving the child in the hospital. They didn't allow them to wait until he was\ndischarged. So my sister-in-law--my husband's sister, Margit--uh sort of adopted him and uh\nwas to take him. He went to Theresienstadt, and while he was there she took care of him.\nBut, of course, when she came with him to Auschwitz, she went to gas with him. But when\nhe...we had really difficulty during that time of all kinds. Uh during that time things were\ngetting worse in terms of uh getting supplies, buying food, working, going places. I\nremember going on the street and meeting one of my school friends. Of course, by that time\nI had the star; and as we came closer to each other, we walked slower and slower, thinking,\n\"Should I stop? Should I talk? Who was it worse for, her? Is it worse for me? What should\nwe go and do?\" So... And so we slowly came together, looked at each other, winked at each\nother, and passed again. It...1t was that sort of a situation. You had to think, \"Wait a minute.\nIs today Saturday? Saturday, I cannot go this place. Friday, I cannot get that place.\" Because\nthe restrictions were getting tighter and tighter. So it was a difficult time under any\ncircumstances. Uh, now Rudie--my husband--had a brother, Karel Schiff, who was finishing\nhis MD degree. By that time, Hitler came. And there were only two Jewish uh people who\nwere supposed to get their degree. You know, that big day in Europe--it was a much bigger\nday to get your degree. Uh they gave the degree to everybody; and they took the two Jewish\nfellows to the bathroom, and gave them their diploma in the bathroom. And uh he had, as I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsaid, a sister and a brother-in-law. None of them have returned. Uh, my father-in-law died in\nthe transport from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz. He died uh on the way. And my mother-in-\nlaw, was a very energetic woman, and brother-in-law were in the familienlager [Ger: family\ncamp]. And I was told how uh they knew what was going to happen to them. Uh, Rudla was\nwith them; and uh I understood he was quite sick. And uh he died probably before he went\nto gas--in the familienlager, you know.",
        "Q: Let's go back a little bit. Can you tell us a little more about the early years, of the German\ninvasion, what that meant?",
        "A: Uh, I remember the day they came. I remember the day I sto... remember the place, the\nstreet where I stood, and it was snowing. It was a cold day and they were pulling in - I was\nby myself. I just walked there. It was not far, maybe three-quarters of a mile from where we\nlived. And we were uh uh watching them on their wagons with their tanks, with their half-\ntracks, with guns pointing to the rooftops. And it was snowing. And we knew that the\nscrew is going to become tighter and tighter. Uh we knew what was happening in Austria.\nBut somehow we still had some foolish idea we are in Czechoslovakia. Because, I\nremember so clearly, when I was about eleven or twelve, I read a book about the Marranos.\nThese were the uh Jews in Spain who during the Inquisition had a choice either to give up\ntheir religion or be uh converted [to] Catholicism; and many of them became converted only\nin name, and still celebrated secretly all the Jewish holidays. And uh this was a very\ninteresting story about the Inquisitor, etc. And I remember--you know, the kind of vignettes\none remembers from childhood--I remember telling my grandmother, \"Aren't we fortunate\nthat we live in the 20th century in Czechoslovakia, that such a thing cannot happen to us!\"\nSix short years, six short years [later, it] happened to us. Not only as to them, but much\nworse. Uh, kind of took away from us the protection that 1t happens to somebody else but\nnot to us. One becomes and realizes how vulnerable one is.",
        "Q: When did things begin to change--for your family, in particular? How did you... Describe\nsome of it. ;",
        "A: Uh, I worked at that time what they used to call a Palestina Amt [Ger: Palestine Office].\nUh, at that time there were still people able to move, uh emigrate. And of course, when you\nsigned your paper for emigration, if I was Hanna Schiff at that time, I had to sign it as\n\"Hanna Sarah Schiff.\" All the women had to put down \"Sarah,\" and all the men had to put\nin \"Israel\" as a mid...as a middle name. And I was go...going to the Department of Treasury\nwhere I filled up some papers, and uh they had to pay that much of a... They had to give a\nlist of all their property they were going to take with us in the suitcases, and they had to pay\nthat much for this and that much for that. And so I was working on that. And therefore, I\nknew that the Jacob Edelstein was the head of the Palestina Amt, and knew some people\nthere--which later became very important to me. Uh the... (pause) I worked during the time,\nbut I cannot... My father for instance, he owned a workshop. That was taken away; and he\nhad to start working again, because he didn't have such means. But fortunate my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ngrandmother lived with my parents. Uh my parents' maid--who was worked with us\nprobably ten, eleven years, was my mother's age--uh was very helpful and undemanding.\nAnd she went shopping, and she did what she could. But of course, her ration tickets were\nregular ration tickets; but our ration tickets were marked with a \"J,\" so we couldn't shop\nwhen there was food in the stores. We could shop only at certain hours for certain things,\netc. But nevertheless, she was very instrumental in helping us. Uh my parents were... Oh, I\nshould go back to one thing. At that time uh when the Germans came, of course, they went\nto the Jewish Kultusgemeinde--the religious and cultural community--and wanted the\nname[s] of the Jews. And from there, they named...got the names of the transport. And we\nwere so stupid, we went and we registered and we did what we could at that time. At that\ntime, I had an infection in this finger, and uh it was following up my arm. And, of course, I\ncouldn't go to the hospital. By the way, at that point we were not allowed to use the hospital.\nLittle bit later, there was one private hospital converted; and Jews were able to use that little\nprivate hospital, which was very crowded. But at that time, there was nobody; and the\ninfection was continuing. Uh the uh Aryan, non-Jewish, gentile uh fianc\u00e9e of my brother-in-\nlaw--of Karel Schiff--uh took me without a star into the hospital, told them I am her cousin,\nhad me operated, and took me by taxi home. By the way, we were not allowed to use taxis.\nSo at great danger to her--because she had to tell them I am her cousin--I was operated in a\nregular hospital, and she took me home. Because otherwise I wouldn't have been able to get\nhelp. I mean, these were the kind of things one doesn't even remember, because there were\nso many things that happened so often. But uh it was only because she had took me as her\ncousin, and she was a physician herself. Uh we were trying to hide a few things with some\nfriends, and some friends were very cooperative and kept them. Uh some friends were\nafraid. And some friends decided if we don't come back, you know, they will keep it. It very\nmuch depended on which person. Uh I was just trying to think of something, and it just\nescaped me. Uh (SHORT PAUSE) that the... we helped by our listening to the orders to go\nand register people so they can be sent by transport. And it depended uh what you did,\nwhere you lived, how you went with it. So you were continuously threatened: \"Am I going\nto be on the next transport?\" Uh, of course, I'm not even talking about it that we had to give\nup uh jewelry, radio and so forth. Because if we listen to radio, it was dangerous, uh\nbecause all these restrictions were coming out. At one point, Heydrich--who was the\nprotector of Czechoslovakia--uh was uh killed on one of the streets when two paratroopers\nwho were sent from England were...threw a hand grenade under the car. And uh he was\nkilled, and they were looking for them. And it was told that one was on a bicycle. So they\ncame around us and looking and confiscating bicycles and all of that. And we knew daily\nhow many, we had uh lists of people. They were in the newspaper. They were posted lists of\npeople who were shot, who were hung, etc. etc. Friend of mine was among them. Political\nreasons, or whatever reasons there were. It was like if you were in... It was a screw. It was a\nforever tightening screw, with more regulations. And the screw was tightening over our\nheads. Uh my parents went in July-- June or July...at the end of July (cough), July of '42, uh\nto Theresienstadt. My grandmother went with them. My grandmother was at that time bed-\nridden most of the time. Her mind was fine. Her hair was black. At eighty-six her hair was\nblack and was long; and when I was good, I was allowed to braid it. And uh she...her mind\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas fine; but when my parents packed and went, uh she went with them because she lived\nwith them. And when they came to carry her down, they carried her on a litter down the\nstaircase and put her with the other old people on the bottom of a spediteur [Ger: \"moving\nvan\"], of a moving van. And that's how they took her to the gathering place. The last word\nfrom her was: \"Love each other. Be good to each other. Love each other. Be good to each\nother.\" As they carried her down the steps. There was no complaint; there was just kind of a\nblessing. And from my mother, I know--because I met my mother in Theresienstadt--she\nsaid in the moment she came to the gathering place, with all the commotion and all that\ncraziness with her, she became so confused. She didn't know what was going on. She\ndoesn't know what was happening to her. And uh they took her to Theresienstadt,\nnevertheless. They put them on trucks. You know, the kind of trucks when you move the\nbeds so to slide things off. And then how they slid the old people off when they brought\nthem to Theresien|stadt], so they put them to bed. She died three months...three weeks after\narriving at Theresienstadt. And I was told [by] somebody she was begging for couple cubes\nof sugar from somebody who came to see her. And she was buried in one of the last mass\ngraves at that time. The reason I know, when we came back after the war to Theresienstadt,\nwe went to look up the original records. And in the original records, it showed when she\nwas buried and what was the mass graves. We went to the field, because you could still see\nwhere they dug the furrows, put the bodies in and put the soil over it. So it was always like\nheaps and valleys, heaps and valleys. So we could figure out, of course; because, you know,\nGermans registered which row it was in. So we could count about which row it was, put\nsome flowers on her, and had her name put on the grave. Because that's about all I could do\nfor my grandmother at that time. But my memory of her is that her last word was \"Be good\nto each other, and love each other.\" There was not many people to whom one could transfer\nit, but that was her last words.",
        "Q: When and how were you and your husband taken ?",
        "A: Uh, as I said, we were living with the in-laws and we knew that it's tightening. And we were\nin bed reading--I remember it so clearly. Stenbeck. John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.\nAnd the knock on the door came, and our invitation to the transport. I don't think I ever\nfinished reading the book. Uh we packed very carefully the suitcases. Very carefully;\nbecause this was the only possessions we were going to have. When we came to\nTheresienstadt we never got the suitcases. Our transport, which was the first transport of\nfifteen hundred people, gave these suitcases as a gift to the German nation for the bombed-\nup people. So I was so glad we had contributed something. But we... For the next years,\nwe...we had only what we carried on our backs. Fortunately, uh when we came to the\ngathering station, uh we were told--we were fifteen hundred people--and all of a sudden said\nonly a thousand will go. All the women will be pulled out. Then they pulled us back, so I\ndidn't have the... They took my number next to my husband, and they gave me another\nnumber. So I went through all the years in Theresienstadt as \"Transport BA\" and \"Number\n1101.\" And uh in...uh during the time in this gathering place that used to be exhibition hall,\nuh we were... Over the mar...over the PA system came: \"Anybody who has money on him,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nor gold or cigarettes or matches will be shot, da da da da.\" I had all of this on me. We had\nto, because we had to protect ourselves somehow. In the lining of our coats, I had a\nmetal...you know, Yardley talc used to come in a metal box. In that box, I had some jewelry.\nAnd so you heard all of this, and nevertheless you had to sort of stay with it. We came to uh\nour BohuSovice. At BohuSovice was the train stop for Theresienstadt. And as I said--I don't\nknow if I said it, my husband was rather weak and sickly at that point. And we carried a big\nbag--each tried to hold one handle--in which were food, mostly, and in the other side we\neach had a bed roll. And on our backs, we had a knapsack with just a change of few things.\nTurned out that was the only thing we had for the next years, what we carried with us.\nWhen we came to BohuSovice there, in front of the train was Jacob Edelstein, whom I\nknew. And I said, \"Hello,\" to him; and he said to me, \"Try to get yourself to confirmed to\nwork as soon as possible.\" I didn't know what it meant. But what it meant: if you are not\ngoing to get work immediately, then be [perfect (ph)] that you could go on. And many of\nour people. Of course, I went with all possible speed about protect ourselves. At that time,\nuh all the uh civilians of Theresienstadt were evacuated; and whole Theresienstadt belonged\nto us. Because before the people were only in the kaserne [Ger: \"barracks\"], into the\nbarracks; and the civilians were in the town. We were able to move around. I was very short\nfor a house; and I went to get myself confirmed, and I found a job as a nurse. There were\ntwo small houses right opposite of the main kaserne, where the uh leadership was; and it\nwas... Germans in their organizations took away all the names of the street. And because\nTheresienstadt was built as a grid, they called all these named \"L,\" and these named \"quer,\"\n[Ger: \"crosswise\" |--\"Q\" and \"L.\" \"Lang\" [Ger: \"lengthwise\"] and \"quer.\" So Q told, you\nwould know, typical German. So we were... these two houses were L-17 and L-19, 217 and\n219. These were two smallish villas that were joined together; and that was to become the\nhospital. The first doctor was Hans Schauffer (ph), a gynecologist from--I'm sorry, a\npediatrician--from Brno; and he eventually had three young doctors with him. We had first\nchildren who had whooping coughs. At that time there was no antibiotics, no vaccination.\nThe only thing what we had was Persan...not Persantil. I can't...1 told you the name, and I\ncannot remember now. Uh, from P. It was a sulfa drug. It made by Bayer at the same time.\nAnd it was red and it created everything, dyed everything red. And there was few people\nwho had some uh uh sulfa that was Cibasol, made by Ciba in Switzerland. But that was very\nvery rare to get. And if these children got... Protosol, was I think the name. Uh when they\ngot it, even their vomit from the coughing, everything was red. Now, we had in these two\nsmall villas, there was a iron bed next to iron bed. There were not even little aisles in\nbetween them, because there was no space. Uh if laundry was possible, maybe it was\nchanged every week, maybe every two weeks for these children; because we didn't have the\nlaundry available. It was very difficult to get it. So all what we had was us and the kindness,\nto try [to] wash them. Also, so many of the children got impetigo...impet--I don't know what\nyou call. And they were only painted with some purple--I don't know what you call that--\npurple dye to neutralize it.' Uh, at that time little TB came also; and we had one beautiful\nbright thirteen year old die of TB. His brother's still alive, and is a friend of mine. Uh many\n' Possibly gentian violet?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nof these, uh the mothers couldn't visit them. There were no visiting hours. It was impossible\nto get visitors in. There was only through the windows; because it was so crowded and\nmany of these things were infectious. At that time came a very big uh ...epidemic, at that\ntime for Theresienstadt, of scarlet fever and eventually typhoid-- abdominal typhoid. And\nthe scarlet fever, the whole hospital was converted to scarlet fever hospital. Now, we came\nin and out; we didn't have any disinfection. I had sort of a...a...what we would call today a\nrunning suit, in black-- sweatsuit--and I had a...somebody gave me a white apron. And we\nhad only one advantage. And this was a terrific advantage; because of our two small villas\nthere was a small bathroom, and you were able... There...there was a kettle, and you could\nmake fire, you can have... So two of us at a time could take a bath. And that was very, very\nprecious for us. That we worked twelve hour shifts, and we could go and have a bath. Now\nwhen I meant \"shift,\" that means we had to serve the food, which was brought in kettles.\nWe had to wash the dishes. We had to wash the floors. We had to make the fire. We have to\nwash the patients. We had to do everything, because people couldn't come in to do other\nthings. We did everything. We did get a little tiny bit of extra. Little tiny bit of extra food.\nBut it was a very little tiny bit of food, and because my husband was sickly and he couldn't\nwork, I was giving him the extras, anyhow. Uh it was hard work. It was hard work with the\nchildren. It was hard work with the people. At that time, typhoid started coming in, as I said.\nAnd we had one man, his name was Rudolph...uh, Rudie Kohn...Cohen, from Germany;\nand he and Rudie...and Robert Kohn, was Cohen and Kohn were in the same room. And\nthey both had scarlet fever and typhoid. And I was on duty when Rudie died. And uh Robert\nwas there; but this was our first real... No, he wasn't the first one; but from the typhoid was\nthe first death we had in the hospital. Uh, Robert eventually did not survive. And then we\ngot seven children who had both scarlet fever and typhoid. And because they were [live or\narrive (ph)] through the yard, there were two rooms with a little bathroom and that was\nmade to the wards for them. One room had two, and the other one had the less. And there\nwas a Stove, so (cough) as I said, we had to wash the floor and keep the fire going and wash\nthe dishes, because people couldn't come in. Uh we washed them. We cleaned them. We did\nget typhoid shots. We got them in our shoulders, not in our arms, so we could work. And I\nhave...the only thing we had to protect us from the typhoid was Lysol. We had Lysol, so we\nput. And we also knew the only infection from typhoid is goes through excretions. So when\nwe dealt with excretions, we put the Lysol in the water and washed our hands. That was the\nonly thing we had. Uh we had two boys--seventeen, one sixteen--and then little girls. The\nyoungest one was Misha Lausher (ph). Uh one day I came in and they brought a little...was\na little feverish girl in. I said, \"What's your name?\" And she says, \"Misha.\" I said, \"Misha\nLausher!\" That was my cousin's child. She was only five or six years old, but she knew her\ntemperature for the last three days. A very bright child, in spite of everything. And her\ndrawings, I kept; because she couldn't talk with her parents and be in contact. I was the only\ncontact. I would take what she has written or drew, and I ironed it out with the heat; and this\nis...1 could carry it out with them. And at that time, Misha has made--now this child was six\nyears old--she drew a picture of a garden and a tree with a bird on it; and the bird had an\nopened beak and out of it came letters. And I said, \"What is this?\" And this is what she\n[said]: \"It whistles.\" And she gave me the note, \"It whistles.\" Misha is the only one who\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsurvived, of all the seven children. (Pause) Uh, and for the parents, 1t was heart-breaking.\nThey were outside. They didn't know what was happening to their children. They didn't\nknow how they were. We were the only contact what we could tell them. In the meantime,\nthey were afraid they will be called into transport and the children would be left there;\nbecause they didn't know what was going to go on.",

        "A: Uh, not much. Not much. Uh, he was in the the men's barracks the first time; and he was\nreally going down the drain. He didn't wash properly. And that was always a very bad sign,\nwhen you didn't keep up with your personal hygiene. Uh, I had to go up into the kaserne--\nand the men knew me--and clean up his bed, and clean up this and that. And uh he was\nsickly. He really couldn't do much. It was getting worse and worse; and uh he was, in many\nways, resentful that I had the work and I could do that. And I remember when I came after\nnight shift...worked on the night shift, and I wanted to sleep during the day. He woke me up,\nbecause here I was. It was very, very difficult. It was getting very difficult. And the\nmarriage...I, you know, I was seventeen at that time and a naive. And as time went on, I\nrealized more and more that the marriage could not last. When I--if I may back-track--uh,\nwhen uh I...when we came to uh Theresienstadt, my parents were there already for three\nweeks. Uh, and couple...after I was there about... So therefore I knew about my grandmother\nfrom my mother; and my mother had her suitcases, I think. I don't even remember if I got\nsomething from her or not. Because they did get their suitcases; but they were there maybe\nonly uh three weeks, month at the most, and they got called in a transport. And I went with\nthem as far as I could go before the collection place. And I was giving goodbye to my father\nand to my mother--in a way, much more emotionally to my father--and I knew in my heart\nof hearts that I was never going to see them. I really knew that I'm never going to see them\nagain. And uh as far as I can see, tracing, they were somewhere in Poland. Uh the book says\nnobody knows where it was; but our maid, our Maru (ph), was in touch with them through\nsome gendarme and sent them packages for a while. And I think they must have been\nsomewhere at that point where L'vov [Pol: Lwo\u00e9w] is--which is Ukraine now. And uh we\nwere there two years ago, and I asked what were...what were the camps around there; and\nthey told me there was a great many camps there. But nobody could put their finger on it\nwhen I asked. And uh as far as I can again trace it, my father survived there and went to\nAuschwitz. Because somebody saw him in Auschwitz; and which was quite miraculous\nbecause by that time he was 55. And as...and he probably--as I say there's no certainty--\nended when one of those three big ships that were loaded with prisoners and sank in\nFebruary of '45 in the Baltics, in the North Sea. Uh, my mother, I don't know. Uh, but I\nknew quite sure that I was not going to see them anymore. Uh, meanwhile some more\ndistance relative came through, and they went. So we were forever living under a threat.\nWho is going to be in the next transport? Who is going to be in the next transport? And\nbecause I was...we were graded, we were rostered, and I was always fairly well\neraded...rated as a nurse, I was protecting my husband for a while, even though he didn't\nwork. And how did I get confirmed for a job? I went to this big kaserne, to this big barracks.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nYou know, these were big stone barracks with many, many hallways and yards; and I was\nlooking for the labor department. And I knew the name of the labor department's name\n[NB: head] uh was Robert Weinberg, who's... I knew about him from when I worked in\nPrague in the Palestina Amt. But I didn't know him in person; and I know his nickname was\n[\"\"Winczi\" (ph)]. And I go the hallways, and I'm looking for the office; and I meet a person\nand I say, \"Where is the office of [Winczi (ph)|?\" And the man looks at me. Says, \"Well,\nhow do you know my nickname?\" And he was just that person I met. And, of course, he\nwas helpful that I got confirmed for work. It was just coincidences all along. Coincidences\nall along. Uh, so things got pretty bad that I really couldn't tolerate 1t anymore; and the\nmarriage ended. Which would have been ending, anyhow. Even if my husband had\nsurvived, it would have ended. And he went with the December transport, with his parents\nand his brother. Uh, and they went to the familienlager--Karel Schiff, the doctor--and uh he\nknew what was the end, and my mother-in-law, too. Uh Rudla died probably of encephalitis\nin the familienlager. I had heard that he was asking for some mashed potatoes, for\nsomething to eat; which was, of course, impossible. And uh I uh made a friendship and then\nbecame a wife of one of the young doctors in the hospital. His name was Bruno Mandel. He\ncame from Prost_jov, in Moravia. He...he was there with his mother. Officially, we couldn't\nget a divorce and get married; because it was outside of the other jurisdiction. But within the\njurisdiction of Theresienstadt, we got on papers changed that I would be divorced and\nmarried to Bruno after the war. And when we were... And I volunteered to go to Auschwitz\nwith Bruno. We were the first transport of fifteen hundred people. Again, the second time\naround. There were five hundred women were allowed to volunteer. There were five\ntransport of thousand men; and with the last one, five hundred women were allowed to\nvolunteer. So, of course, I volunteered. And uh Bruno was carrying with him the papers, to\nbe sure he had them with him. Uh, the... I don't know if I'm jumping from here to there...",
        "Q: Let's...let's...let's slow down a minute, before you get on the transport. Tell me about Bruno.\nTell me about how a romance could even flower under those conditions.",
        "A: We worked closely in the hospital. He was uh...he was an internist. He would have trained\nfor cardiology. He would have liked cardiology, and he would have been very good at it. Uh\nhe has uh...uh he was very involved in his patients, and I could see it. So, you know, we\nworked together day by day. This is...this is the best I can say. It was very, very difficult,\nwith all kinds of obstacles. Because these two private houses had a tiny little garden. We\nhad a tiny little plot where we could plant little radishes or something, which was the only\nfresh food one could get. And uh it...1t was both the proximity and the idea. He was also\nvery kind to me, which was very different from Rudie. Uh, he spoke um English; and we\nwere reading together Lady Windermere's Fan.\u201d And I tried to read it and had to translate it,\nbecause he was trying to help me with English. He was trying to help me. We went over all\nthe bones, so I would know them in Czech and German and Latin, in anatomy; and uh uh he\nwas teaching me a great deal. He was ten years older than I. And uh so he was teaching me\n* A play by Oscar Wilde.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\na great deal, too. And uh I knew he valued me a great deal, too. So, you know, these were\nall the things. Don't forget, I was there by myself. And at that time, his mother very much\nwanted me to be with him; while uh at Rudla's parents were also saying what am I doing. So\nI was under a great deal of pressure, besides working twelve hours a day, six days a week.\nSo it was a great deal of pressure all around it. Nevertheless, we went in the evening to\nlectures that were held on the...under the rooves of the meetings. We were working under\nthe uh we went to every cultural situation we could go to. Uh at that time, they started\nsending the transports of the older Germans. And they told them, of course, they were going\ninto a sanitor1um. So they came in fur coats and big hats. And here they were brought from\nthe train. At that time, ghetto had sixty thousand people, instead of the six thousand in\nnormal times. And they were put under the rooves of the big kaserne. Now, these were huge\nrooves with huge uh...uh wooden beams; and they were behind the beams, in front of the\nbeams. You didn't know if they were... I was in one of the transport. I was delegated to go\nand help out. You didn't know if they were sleeping, or if they were dead already; because\nthey... It was cold in winter. It was hot in summer. And here they came, with their fur coats\nand hats; and, of course, all...the most of the work in Theresienstadt was done by young\nCzech Jews, because we were the main occupation. So they would say, \"If Hitler only knew\nwhat the Czech Jews are doing to us!\" They still couldn't comprehend it, they couldn't put it\ntogether. So, of course, the survival rate there, the hygiene there, was impossible. There\nwere no bathrooms, you know. Uh it was uh...uh there were the uh the survival rate was\nvery, very small. Uh, my aunts came through Theresienstadt, and then they went on; and\nthen came my aunt, with her two children, who was most closest to me. Uh, they...we were\nfour years apart--Eva...Raymond was at that time sixteen, and Joe was twelve. And they\ncame in in October '42. In October '42, in the beginning. And my aunt was legally blind.\nShe was very, very near-sighted, just like my mother. And she was legally blind; and\nbecause I was a nurse, I was able to go with her in the...into the gathering place. And they\nwouldn't even let them go in Theresienstadt. They kept them there, in the gathering place, as\nthey arrived, immediately prepared for a transport to go on. We did everything to get them\nout, but we couldn't. So I took Eva and Joe out of there, and took them where --I have to\nexplain to you, describe to you where we lived. And I took them where we lived, and I put\nthem in my bed. And I - this is my memory - they had boots on. The two pairs of boots\nunder my bed, and they were on the bunk sleeping together so they would at least get some\nrest to go on. And when I returned them, my aunt told me, \"I know I'm not going to survive.\nI know I'm not going to be back. But I know that you will take care of the children.\" I would\nhave, had...had they survived. When I returned, I was hoping that one of them would come\nback. But, of course, they didn't. Eva threw out of the window a card on the way to\nAuschwitz, which was addressed to [Jiri Pollack (ph)], who happened to be my school-\nmate. And after the war, I met him; and he told me that he got a post card from her on the\nway to Auschwitz which she threw out and somebody picked up and mailed. They were the\nfirst transport to Auschwitz from Theresienstadt. No children and uh women survived; and\nof the men who survived, there were not too many. That was uh 27th of...they arrived 27th\nof October in '42.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: What else...about Theresienstadt ?",
        "A: Uh, a great deal. Uh (pause) when we came in, we lived in a former brewery. All the nurses\nwho worked with the infectious diseases lived in this brewery. So there was on the second\nfloor, there was a kitchen; and behind it--as I said, I don't remember--three or four rooms.\nSo if you went to the last room, you had to go through all the other rooms. And in my room,\nwhich was the second one - the first one was a very small one and there was three bunks,\nand then in ours and there were two, four, six, eight people living in the other one. And, of\ncourse, we went through to the other one. And uh in these eight bunks we were all the\nnurses who came in from day shift, night shift, you know. So we knew each other. We\nworked together. And uh the life was there...at that time men could visit. Uh, we got sheets\nas a little curtain. And the privacy was minimal. Because, if you realize, when you washed\nyour hair, you were there washing your hair from water you brought from somewhere. And\nthe men were coming into the rooms that were past your room, and seven other people were\nthere. It was difficult life, very difficult life. The one advantage was that I was able to take a\nbath in the hospital when we went off the shift. Uh, later I worked in a hospital where they\nhad encephalitis; and that was uh also at one time there was encephalitis. I worked with\nsome older people. When I worked uh I had a night shift at uh hospital where all the older\npeople were. I found my grandfather's sister there, who was in her eighties at the time. I\nwas giving out dinner, or whatever it was, and I was able to give her an extra potato. And\nAunt Antonia was so happy she got the extra potato. Uh it was such a intensive life, because\neven with all this long work, and all the social things and all the personal things was going\non, and all diseases around you. One day came a message that two hundred children from\nPoland are coming through. They were to be deloused, washed, bathed and dressed and\nprepared for a trip to Switzerland. [SOUND DISAPPEARS FOR APPROXIMATELY\nONE MINUTE OR MORE AT THIS POINT; APPPARENT TECHNICAL\nPROBLEM] [And some nurses were allowed to go and be with them; and for volunteering\nwith them, they were supposed to protect their families. I volunteered. I had my few things\npacked up, and...this was still, I was still with Rudolph].\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nTAPE #2",
        "A: So one day two hundred children were...\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: OK. We're back on camera.",
        "A: Uh, oh day two hundred children were sent to Theresienstadt from Poland to be deloused,\nwashed, fed uh...fed a little bit and put clothes on. And uh we were told that uh if uh some\nof us nurses would volunteer uh for to go with them, we would be uh able to protect our\nfamilies. I packed up few my things, but I was told that anybody who was married cannot\ngo. Only single people. I knew some of the nurses who went. They went straight to gas.\nApparently, uh there might have been some ideas; but they were misbegotten. And the\nchildren were transported back and forth, and annihilated. Uh the...uh there were many kind\nof things that one was never certain what will be happening, and that was the worst part,\nthat we were continuously in uncertainty. There was a Damocles uh sword hanging over\nyou all the time. You never knew how much time you had for what. Uh the daily\ndifficulties, the daily life difficulties. For instance, as crowded as we were, the hygiene as\npoor as it was, the laundry as impossible as it was. There were bed bugs. In summer, it was\nsuffocatingly hot. We lived so close together. So sometimes people tried to sleep out in the\nyard uh because not only that it was hot, but the bedbugs were multiplying and biting. The\nfleas were multiplying and biting, which made it also much more difficult to rest. I\nremember a scene where we got very little soap. The soap, we got rationed soap. The soap\nwas of horrible quality. It was like a little stone. And I remember being in the yard, and\nwashing my laundry with this little bit of soap, and there was a little bit left over. Every little\nbit of that soap was precious. Now at one point we were issued money, and we could buy\nthings for the money. And one of the things you could buy was a little bit of mustard, or a\nlittle bit of ketchup, or so...another piece of this terrible soap--if they, if it was available.\nNow people were getting packages from abroad. It was wonderful. At one point--you see,\nthere were always periods, they were like windows of permission, when you were able to\nget packages. And some people were able to get packages. The Danes were the best off;\nbecause the King and the Danish people, they were able to get a monthly five kilo--not\npound, eleven pounds--five kilo package with salami, butter, cheeses, from Denmark. That\nwas the gift of the Danish government to the few, few Danish Jews in Theresienstadt. There\nwas a number also of prominents. These were Germans and Austrians, who during the war\n[NB: the First World War] got an uh...uh the Iron Cross, or any of the very high medals.\nAnd they were protected in Theresienstadt. They were not sent on, at one point. For some\nreason, that was honored. Uh of course, during the time Edelstein, who was a Judenaltester,\nwas a wonderful man; and he did what he could. But he himself was deported; and we had\nother Judenaltester which made things worse. But nevertheless, there was this tremendous,\nvibrating cultural life. I remember seeing Fledermaus, a whole production of Fledermaus.\u2019\n\u00b0 Viennese operetta by Johann Strauss.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nUh, I remember going to a poem reading. There were philosophical debate. There were\nconcerts. Uh there was this need to live very intensively. And I think this was about the\nessence of Theresienstadt. You had these few years, so you have to live them so intensively.\nYou have to use every minute you had. During that time I also had pneumonia at one point.\nI had uh middle ear infection, where they had to trepanate my ear drum; and you know with\nall the things we have, I was sitting in a chair like this, and they punctured my ear drum.\nAnd uh, you know, few things of that sort one had to endure. And you either got well or you\ndidn't get well, though there were not many choices. Uh I remember in the room be...ahead\nof ours was Sister Miriam. Sister Miriam was a nun from Austria, of a Jewish background,\nbut was converted to Christianity; and was a Catholic nun for about thirty years. She was in\nher fifties when she came. A kind, gentle soul. Now, of course, as a nun, she was shaved\nand wore a wig when she went into the public. And of course, all of a sudden she had to\nshow herself without hair. But she worked as a nurse. She eventually died of cancer in\nTheresienstadt. But for her, it was an absolute--not only a cultural shock--shocking... It was\na destroying of her life in any direction in which she had. Nevertheless, she showed a great\ngentleness and great kindness towards everybody, in spite of everything. Uh for instance, if\nyou, they had a laundry. You were allowed to go there so many days, for so often, and bring\nin your laundry; and about two weeks later you got it back. So with few things it was very\ndifficult. There was also a shoe repair, where you could get some shoes repaired because\nwe could not replace anything, but everything was a difficulty. When they were opened,\nwhen you had your work hours, when you got it back. Everything was difficult. And then\nyou have the sight of Theresienstadt was the hearses. Because the hearses were brought\nfrom all over, from all over Czecho...not all over Czechoslovakia, all over Bohemia, from\nthe Jewish uh cultural groups that brought to the cemetery in their own hearses. So the\nhearses were brought in; and not only the sick people, but the bread was transported, and\nwood was transported, and everything was transported on the hearses. Because these were\nthe only wagons. Uh then there was uh the comedy--organized and directed by Germans--\nwhere one day we were supposed to get the visit by the Red Cross. The houses were painted\nonly outside, where the inspection was going to take place. We got better food for a week.\nThe children were told if they... somebody comes to interview of them... Seidl was the SS\nman there, that they had. And they were supposed to say...they were supposed to get a box\nof sardines and say, \"Uncle Seidl, Uncle Seidl! Sardinen schon wieder!\" [Ger: \"Uncle\nSeidl, Uncle Seidl! Sardines again!\"] That became the joke. Uncle \"Seidl.\" Calling him\n\"Uncle Seidl.\" \"Schon wieder\"--\"Again we are getting sardines!\" Of course, we never ate or\nsaw sardines. But here they was giving them, and showing: \"We are getting it again!\" You\nknow. It became such a joke. We did get the coffee house at the end, where this concert,\nwhere you could see. Uh we used to call about the coffee, what you, how you make the\ncoffees. You take one coffee bean, put it on a string and wave it over hot water. Uh the\nmiracle was that the water was somehow blackish. It was chicory mainly. And uh it was\nwarm. Uh then there was the counting of the people. One day there was counting of the\npeople where all people had to go to this big meadow and there was this counting that was\ndocumented in films, etc. Uh we were, we were in the with the children in the hospital, so\nwe didn't have to go; so we spent that lovely day in the hospital. But only taking of the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nchildren, but it was so terrible because we didn't know what was happening with everybody.\nWe didn't know what was going on. We didn't know what was going to happen to them. We\ndidn't know what was going to happen. It was, I remember that day was so full of tension\nand misery because what were we supposed...what's going to happen. We didn't know. It\nwas a terrible day, and then another kind of drudgery. A woman from Germany came, with\na retarded child. This is, today we would say, the most profound retarded child I have ever\nseen. Was seven years old, couldn't sit, couldn't talk. Anything. And nevertheless, this\nwoman tended this child so tenderly through seven years of... He was like a newborn child,\nexcept this big; seven years old. And you looked around, and you kept thinking of the\nhuman tragedy of this woman under these circumstances, was tending this child so tenderly.\nAnd you knew what's going to be in for her. Uh, in uh one of the other barracks was uh a\nlittle section for insane, where they were one day loaded and went in those transport, of\ncourse. I'm trying to... You know, there are so many stories that keep, you know, dropping\nout.",
        "Q: Did you have any contact with Leo Baeck?",
        "A: Leo Baeck? No, no. Uh, you know, as as I come all these different memories um pick\nup...(pause) of the various hospitals. Uh I was working for one time only... Of course,\nanother thing--there were abortions. Uh Doctor Hahn, who was a gynecologist in Brno,\ncame. And he was making abortions, because if women get pregnant they knew what it\nmeant. Uh, so abortions were performed. Nobody talked about it; but abortions were\nperformed, because they had to be performed. They were done by the gynecologist as kindly\nas could be. And that wasn't...that was a sheer necessity to do. And uh it...it was a survival.\nSee, I'm...I'm trying... You know, there are so many aspects to look at; and I was in\nTheresienstadt from '42 until '44, for two and a half years. So there are a lot of stories, you\nknow. How to replenish the few things how you you brought with you? At one point I was\nable to make contact; and I sold my... First, I sold a few of the...used up money I had on\nblack market to buy extra food. The extra food was smuggled in by the Czech gendarmes.\nUh so we bought some, as much as we could. And uh finally...we were allowed to keep a\nwedding ring, so I sold the wedding ring--exchanged it for bread. I thought the bread was\nmore important. Again through the gendarmes. Uh Misha's mother, Irma Lausher, my\ncousin who had...who was teaching the children in the youth home, she was uh...she has an\nincredible memory. And she wrote me books of poems for my birthday. And even under\nthese circumstances we tried to celebrate birthdays. You know, a slice of bread, a small loaf\nof bread was a wonderful birthday present. Somebody saved it up, or had the connections.\nUh the the tendency was to try to uh maintain as normal life as possible. Misha's father had\nthe access to go little bit uh where there was a little bit of grass; and he planted some\ntomatoes, so that Misha would have some fresh food. And tended it tenderly. The\ninventiveness of people under the circumstances was incredible. There was a group of\nwomen who worked in agriculture, so who were sometimes able to smuggle something in.\nIt was not for us they worked on the agriculture. Oh, another interesting thing was--as I say,\nthese stories keep popping in my mind--uh Lidice was the Czech village where as uh\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nrevenge for the Heydrich affair, the Germans went and killed the men and many of the\nwomen and some of the children; and the left-overs they sent to Ravensbrick. I knew some\nof them. And there was this cleaning up to do, and there were sheep and goats and cows. So\nsome of men from Aus...from Theresienstadt were commandeered to go to Lidice to clean it\nup and bring in the animals. That was not known, you know; but the guys from\nTheresienstadt did the cleaning up. Uh they were, once another group of men were sent to\nanother uh transport in some woods to do some very hard work. I don't remember where it\nwas. And the one man wanted to get out of it. And he thought that would help him; and\nhe...he drank, I don't know if it was turpentine or gasoline, or he drank some substance that's\ncompletely ruined his lower intestines. And he was...he uh defecated himself to death when\nhe, they returned him to Theresienstadt. He defecated himself to death actually trying to\nescape this way. Uh but it was through all of this pressure, there was this constantly...\nTransports are going. Are you going to be on the next transport? Are you going to be saved\nfrom the next transport? Who can you stay? Who is going to go? And, of course, the\npressure on the people who made the lists were as well. Are you going to save your family?\nWho is going? Uh, my father's cousin came through who I was very fond of. I knew he was\ngoing. So you know, how do you - as a very young woman - how do you try to keep any\nkind of normalcy under these circumstances? Very diff... with very great difficulty.

        "Q: You mentioned abortions. Did you assist him in any of these?",
        "A: Yeah, I saw a couple of them. I didn't assist but I uh... I don't know if I assisted actually. I\nwas there uh when uh when uh Hahn performed it, a couple of them in Hamburg Kaserne.\nYeah, I saw them; but I don't know how much I assisted in it actually, at the time because I\nwas total novice. He would have told me, \"Give me this, uh that.\" I didn't, you had to take\nthe dilator from the smallest to the biggest and then you have to stretch out. But I remember\nbeing there, and seeing it done. You know, they were very skillful doctors; very skillful\ndoctors who did, under impossible situations, really wonders. And who tried to be very\nhumane.",
        "Q: Is anything else you want to add about Theresienstadt ?",
        "A: Yeah, you know, the irony... Hans Schauffer (ph) was the doctor who was the head doctor\nin the children's hospital, where Bruno was.

He died with typhus later\nin the camp.",
        "Q: I understand.",
        "A: He had like a premonition. He was always afraid he will die with typhus, and he did. He too\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwent through a divorce and another marriage in Theresienstadt. I knew all about the\nintrigues from him, from his wife, and all of that. There was, you know... It was so intense\nevery day. (Pause) Uh in September of '44, there were transports going and they were\nsaying they are going to labor camps. They need labor in Poland. You know, the front was\nmoving. They need labor. And they were equipping the groups with uh shovels, with\nspades. That sounds like that labor, you know? They had also shovels, you know. And uh so\nthere were five transports of men. In the last transport, they allowed five hundred women.\nSo I volunteered to go along. Well, of course, you would volunteer. What else was to do?\nSo we packed our things; and miraculously we were in uh...not in a cattle wagon. We were\nin a regular wagon. And we were sitting on top of our luggages, crowded, everything. And\nwe arrived in Auschwitz, it must have been early afternoon. Because you know it's not so\nfar in mileage; so if we traveled all through the night and half of the morning, we would\nhave been there. When we arrived in Auschwitz, we got out of the train and we were told,\n\"Don't touch anything. Leave everything as is. Don't touch everything. Leave as it 1s.\" But\nwe still carried some things. I came from Prague to Theresienstadt in ski pants and good\nboots and a winter coat. Because, which was fortunate, I had it through all these bad\nwinters. And this is how I came to Auschwitz--with a beaver collar. And this is how I came.\nAgain I kept it, you know, for the transport. And I was still not...you know, I was still pretty\nstrong and everything--still more husky, because I'm big-boned looking. We were supposed\nto stand outside of the train, always to five. Always to five, because Germans can count\neasier that way. So uh women here and men there, as we got off the train. We are standing\nthere; and uh there's a young man in camouflage uniform, a soldier. And all around\nwere...uS were camps with wires. And out of one of the camp, runs a woman. And she yells-\n-I don't remember if it was German, Polish or Yiddish, either one of the languages--and she\nwas yelling at us, \"They will take away from you everything! What you have, throw it to\nme!\" And one of the girls had a knapsack, and she took it and she threw it to her over the\nfence. Now, you have to see this scene. I have it so much in my memory. That this young\nguy was talking to us, and I see this woman running and she's like this to catch it. And in\nthat moment, he took his gun and go \"psht\" and shoot her. That was our welcome. This\nyoung man, who friendly chatted with us in German, he just takes out his gun and goes\n\"psht.\" So that's...that was our welcome. So we are standing to five, and I was in one of the\nfirst rows. And in front of it comes the man in SS uniform, and in a white glove. And this\nwas Mengele. Of course, I didn't know at the time it was Mengele. But I knew there was\nsomething very ominous about him, because he was standing there like with his gloves and\ngoing like this. And as we came by, every person, and that's all what he did. With his finger,\nright and left. The men went first. And as my...as Bruno went by... Oh, excuse me--well, I'll\ntell you later. As Bruno went by, he was yelling at me, \"I'm not going to see you again! I'm\nnot going to see you again!\" And I didn't want him to say that. I didn't want him to say that;\nbut that what he was saying: \"I'm not going to see you again!\" And as they went by,\nMengele shoved like on this side. And when the men was gone, we was started to go. And\nwhen we came here, he shoved me on the other side. So I step up, and I said to him...uh in\nGerman I said to him, \"My...my...my husband went on this side. I want to go this, too.\" And\nhe said, \"March on the other side!\" And here were soldiers with guns around us. I just saw\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthis one shoved, so I went to the left. This was to gas, and this was to work. How did you\nknow? Fate. Total fate. You know, then we were so naive, we were so incredibly naive--of\ncourse, depended (ph)--that when we got off the train, we saw the SS men or other older\nprisoners taking the carriages and the children off the train and putting them beside. We\nsaid, \"Well, if they are not so bad. You see, they are helping.\" My foot! They were, of\ncourse, put to death. Uh, so that was our welcome. So that now by this time was getting\ndark. Now, remember this is end of October--no, end of September--in Poland. So they\nmarched us first where we had to undress. Now I had a can of oil and a can of sardines in\nmy pockets. And I had a good Swiss watch still. I...there were women from the...you know,\nprisoner's women, but who already had short hair. And we had to undress. I thought I will\nbe very smart. I go to one of them and I say, \"Look, I put in the corner my watch and the can\nof sardines and the oil. Keep it for me when I come through.\" Of course. And I thought I\nwould be smart, and I asked her, \"What is your name?\" And she said, \"Hannah Miller.\"\nThat was my maiden name. Of course, I never saw her, I never saw anything else. We were\nallowed...we were supposed to strip completely, except keep shoes. So I had my...still my\ngood shoes. Uh, we come to the next building where there was a shower. There was a\nshower shower. That means it was cold shower. We didn't have anything, but we had the\ncold shower. And we were supposed to put the shoes around the room. I go for my shoes,\nand my shoes are gone. This is the first time I to...started to cry. The shoes were the last\nthing I already had. I skipped one step. As we came and we undressed, we had to go through\na hallway, naked except in the shoes. And SS came by and looked at our breasts and looked\nat our bellies. If none of us...1f some of us might be pregnant. If they saw anybody pregnant,\nthey pulled them out. So you know, it was...so we were standing there naked; and they came\nand they looked at our breasts and our bellies. Then we went to a room where they shaved\nus. And I remember seeing sitting there one of the people I knew with long hair and at that\npoint half of her hair was shaven and half was still long. And I looked at her. And I had few\nbobbie pins, and I kept the bobbie pins. I thought when my hair grow I will have the bobbie\npins. And of course, when you all of a sudden see you bald-headed, completely shaven, you\nlook like monkeys. Everybody looks like a monkey. And not only that, with one blade,\nhundreds people. And then, with that German thoroughness, they also shaved our pubic\nhair--about a hundred people with one blade, pubic hair. Uh, no cleanliness otherwise, but\nthey shaved the pubic hair. And uh from there... So this was the bobbie pin I'm still holding,\nand we go to the shower, and my shoes are gone. We go into the next room, and uh there we\nwere given some old rags. I was given an old summer dress, some pants and something.\nNow, this is cold weather. And we...and we were given wooden shoes. The wooden shoes\nwere killers, absolute killers. In the mud of Auschwitz--uh, no socks in the cold--the\nwooden shoes were rubbing your feet. Also, they were sticking in the mud. You couldn't\npull them out. And when you had a sore on your feet, 1t would never heal. The shoes were\nkillers. Uh so we were marched into the barracks, and we saw the fire from the chimneys.\nWe...we wouldn't believe what it is. For three days...I didn't eat for three days. I was in a\nstate of shock. You didn't eat, because they were telling us this is from... How could you\nbelieve that a fire was from burning our families? I mean, it was incomprehensible. How\ncould you believe what was happening? And then you were given one big pot; and this is\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nlike the last bit of humanity was taken away. Because in the pot they gave five scoops of\nsoup, and the pot was circulated among people. And everybody slurped like an animal. You\nwere being...being made to an animal by slurping the food. So at one point, I saw somebody\ndragging a bag... bag of spoons, and one was hanging out. So I pulled it out; so I was\nalready more civilized. I had a spoon. I kept the spoon throughout. I gave it to the Museum,\nbecause anybody would say it's an old scarred spoon. But it's a special spoon. But it...1t was\npart of becoming less than a human when you have to slurp like a dog. And in the\nbeginning, we just couldn't eat. Uh...uh of course we slept five to a bunks, and we didn't\nhave any any blankets and it was cold. We were warming each other. We were five friends\nwho were staying together. But the dehumanization, when you went to the toilet. Of course,\ntoilet: there were benches with holes in them. And you didn't want to even sit down; and if\nyou didn't want to sit down, all of a sudden somebody came and pulled you down. Because\nthe women who were in charge of those holes wanted them clean. So they just pulled you\ndown very gently. Uh, periodically there was another cleanliness. I mean, this cleanliness\nbusiness! You couldn't wash. You couldn't clean. But you had to wash the floor everyday in\nthe barrack. Uh, we had to go through shower. Among us was one girl who had very heavy\nbeard, and who was shaving. We never knew she had. Of course, she couldn't shave. We\ndidn't have anything. We were just as we were born. And as we were standing there naked\nwaiting for the shower... These were these portable showers, you know--again cold, no\nsoap, no towel, nothing. We came there. These young soldiers, SS men, came and looked at\nus and said...one came to her very kindly and said, \"One of us has to shave.\" Kindly. So we\nwere taken, the laundry we had on, on that was poured disinfectant; and when we came out\nof the shower, we got somebody else's rags. If I may, so...at that time, this was the last time I\nhad... was menstruating for many months; uh because, you know, we lost menstruation.\nAnd I very carefully washed out the pants, very carefully; but, of course, I couldn't hang\nthem. I couldn't do anything with them, because they would be stolen immediately. So I\ncarefully folded them and held them under my arm. Between my arms they would dry a\nlittle bit. And then I would fold them the other way and hold them for my...under my arm\nfor about three days, hoping they would be clean and would be dry because my body\nwarmth would dry them. Finally, I was able to wear them only to lose them and get\nsomebody else's dirty pants. These were the kind of dehumanizing things, all the time. To\nbe shaved again, uh with all the people walking around. And, of course, in between we\nheard shooting; because there were what they used to call \"selection.\" The older people\nwere selected and they were running around or shooting around while we were in the\nbarracks. It was terrible. I happened to run, in our barrack, into two women who I knew\nfrom Prague before the war. One went to the same school I did. Was a... She came to the\nreligious classes from another school. [Hanka Narastrukova (ph)]--she 1s now a physician,\nlives in Switzerland. And Jera (ph), with whom I went to gym...gymnastics. Uh, she is in\nPrague now. She lived in Australia. I was in touch in with them. They were in the\nLitzmannstadt [NB: 6d_]| ghetto. They came to us, and they happened to be in the same\nbarrack. Uh it was awful there. It happens...1t so happened that uh a woman in charge of our\nhuge barrack was from Slovakia, and she learned that the...the man who is going to come\nand look for labor is a pretty good one. At that point, labor was needed; so various uh\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfactory supervisors or directors used to come to Auschwitz to select labor. And we were\ntold that this man had a pretty good set-up, so that...so they directed him to our barrack. And\nthey took two hundred women--hundred twenty Slovaks and eighty Czechs. And I...we...we\nwere the five friends together; and he took four of us. And one of the oldest he rejected, but\nshe survived. Uh she was related to Bruno, an aunt of Bruno. And so we four were\nsupposed to go. So they took us from Birkenau where we were--we were in the\nfamilienlager. We were in the Gypsy lager in the Birken...in Auschwitz; and they...in...in\nuh...in Auschwitz not but in Birkenau section. And they took us into another transit lager.\nThere, we had another experience. We were about a week there. There were the Ukrainians.\nThey had long hair. They had better dress. We had, instead of toilet, there were two uh\nbuckets. And we stood in line to use the buckets; and, of course, a lot of people had\ndiarrhea. But in when a Ukrainian came, she pushed us away and she went immediately;\nnever mind the line. The leader of that barrack was a Ukrainian. The Germans had a stack,\nthis high stack of blankets. But she wouldn't allow us to have them. By this time, it's\nOctober. The Ukrainians wouldn't allow us to have the blankets the Germans gave us. Uh,\nthere was a black triangle antisocial woman--prisoner, but 1n some sort of a uniform; and\nthere were rats. And she was shooting the rats in front of us. Fun! Uh another thing\nhappened. While we were in this barracks, one of the lower leaders--there were, you know,\nhierarchy of leaders--one of the lower leaders, was a woman, her first name is Jana (ph). I\ndon't remember her other name. And she came from the Ruthenia, the easternmost part of\nCzechoslovakia. And she lived in Nachod and had a boyfriend there; but she was taken, and\nshe was in Auschwitz for long, long time when they had to go and work and the dogs were\nbarking at their feet and all of that. And she survived. And she was telling us about it one\nevening. We were just listening to it, you know. It was pretty awful. After, the day after the\nliberation--we happened to be liberated in Nachod--I walk on the street. And, of course,\neverybody knew we were prisoners. We had no hair. And a man comes to me and says, \"I\nknow you just came back, I know it's a... But did you happen to run into Jana?\" And I told\nhim, \"Your name is so and so.\" I remembered him--the name, she gave it to us in October. I\njust remembered it in May, and I told him. It was him. And I told him and we saw in\nOctober she survived; and she did survive, and she returned, and they married. I mean, I just\nhappened to remember that. Uh, so then they took us and they gave each of us a piece of\nbread and something else, and we were loaded on trains. These were the cattle trains now.\nWe just saw a little thing, and we were supposed to go to work. They did give us some\nbetter clothes. Well, they gave us some sort of a winter coat. I had some big black winter\ncoat. Not a heavy winter coat, but some sort of a coat; and a sweater and a skirt. And\nwe...we were going on. I took a piece of the lining and out of that I made a scarf, because if\nyou have no hair it's very cold. So I made a scarf out of that lining. Uh somewhere I saw a\nbig uh bag. It was like uh being carried still in a...in a... When we were in... in uh Birkenau,\nand a sock was hanging out. And I ran and got out the sock; and I don't know, maybe just\none sock. And we had to stand in five for hours in appell [Ger: \"roll call\"], it was so cold.\nSo we always, the five of us, we'll use one of the socks; and the one who has the sock would\nstand in front, because she is getting the coldest and she is sort of uh protecting the others.\nSo I had that one sock. So later I cut it in half, and made two gloves out of it. You know,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\njust sewed it together and made two gloves out of it; 'cause otherwise we had to do only\nthis, put it an inch.... Uh we had uh... So we got on this train, and we watched the stations,\nand then we stopped; and so we knew that there were also men on the train going westward,\nyou know, from Auschwitz. It was not only women, [or] only men. Uh...oh, I know, I had a\nstriped skirt and a sweater. That's what it was. And the men were in striped outfits, and...but\nthey got hats. They didn't give us caps. And uh then we stopped for long, long time. God,\nwe were going for like 36, 48 hours. And all of a sudden, we start looking out after we are\nstanding, and to our absolute horror we realize we are going back again. Now, we knew if\nwe were going back, it's going back to Auschwitz. And we knew what it meant. But then\nthey realized they...they uncoupled some wagons; they didn't...and they moved us again, and\nwe went back again in this direction. East, we went westward. Well, we arrived in Kudowa-\nSackisch. Kudowa-Sackisch.* When we came there they told us, \"This is a spa, but not for\nyou.\" And we walked to these barracks. The barracks, wooden barracks were there. Uh we\nwere a group of two hundred women. There were already three hundred women there,\nmostly Poles and Hungarians. And uh the Lageralteste, the German Lageralteste, first was a\nSudet [NB: from Sudetenland] woman who was miserable. And she had an\nunterscharfitthrer [Ger: a corporal], which [is] a non-com official. And she had...when she\nangry with somebody, he had to beat the women. But when, after...shortly she didn't allow\npeople to peel the potatoes for our soup. They had to be thrown in as it was. But she was\nremoved, and we got an older woman who had a great advantage. She was in many ways\nmuch kinder. She allowed the potatoes to be eaten. And when an SS came for uh inspection,\nshe always slept with them and they left us in peace. So that was a great advantage.\nActually, she wasn't that bad; but she was hung after the war. I know she was hung after the\nwar. Uh, we...we were...we were twenty women, all from...we knew each other from\nTheresienstadt, together in this one room--double uh deck, you know, double deck beds.\nAnd uh that was from October '44 until May [1945], until liberation. We walked into the\nfactory. There used to be big textile factories in that area. And they were changed into\nammunition factories. Uh we particularly were making the part of airplanes in which the\npropeller sits. And next door was another factory where Russian prisoners uh were working\non the propellers. It was a uh...a tower of Babel. There were all groups in this factory. There\nwere German soldiers who went AWOL and were like prisoners under guard. They were\nthe one who moved around heavy machinery. There were French. There were Italians.\nThere were Danish. There were Dutch. Uh of course, there were the Poles. And I started\nworking on a big turning place [NB: a lathe]. I was taught by an Italian by the name\nAntonio Pezutto (ph), and he taught me how to do it. Now, normally, I don't know if you\nturning places. But when you work on a turning place, there's a very sharp knife that goes to\nthe metal and cuts, the metal cuts what it needs to be cut. But they didn't have enough\nmaterial, so they put only the edge in the metal that was wedged in, which was very inferior\nto the _. So of course, we were breaking them and they were very angry with us. Uh\nthey...first they took us to a classroom and taught us how to use a micrometer. I knew how\nto use a micrometer. But we had to do that. And they wanted to know if we know uh uh\n* Subcamp of Gross Rosen. Located in Lower Silesia.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfractions, and things like that. Uh the man who taught us was a German meister--you know,\na foreman--and uh we were in we were like in school benches. And I--you know, we were\ncurious. I looked at the school bench, and in one of the school benches I found a core of an\napple. Somebody ate an apple and left the core. I didn't care who ate the apple. I ate the\ncore. I mean, my goodness! That was fruit! Uh one day--we were there only a few days--but\none day the master said the five of us, \"Look, 1f you would like to take a bath, I will let you\ntake a shower.\" Now, that was very dangerous for him to do that. And he took five of us and\nhe took us to the shower room and let us shower. Now, mind you, we didn't have a towel.\nWe didn't have a soap. We had to put the clothes on we had. But just to be under water, and\nto be able to shower was such a relief. So we went there. It took years and years before I\nfinally allowed myself to remember why he did it. He stood in the corner and watched five\nyoung women naked taking a shower. He got his jollies; but, you know, it took me years to\nallow myself to remember why he did it, because it was very dangerous for him. Uh the\nAntonio Pezutto (ph), he sometimes brought me a piece of bread. He was one of the Italians\nwho fought in Italy with Badoglio, who turned against German. And they came in as\nprisoners, but they were better off. They could move around. They got more food, etc. And\nso once in a while, he brought me a roll or a piece of bread and he hid it somewhere and I\ncould take it. And some of the other women also got it from the meisters. Uh we\nwere...Slowly we were running out of material. Because the eastern front was coming in, the\nshipments were not coming. And at the end they finally loaded all the material, all the\nfact...all the machinery on trucks and took them to Germany. But they were bombed out on\nthe way, which we were not sorry for. But at that point, we were working. I...that was a time\nwhere for nights and we worked twelve hour shifts again, we walked in the snow and ice\nthree kilometers to the factory--which to me today three kilometers isn't much, but at that\ntime it was terrible--and three kilometers back. And some of us had to carry the uh big\nmetal containers with soup, which we had at midnight. Uh the craziness was, for instance,\nwhen they thought... They didn't know we lost menstruation; but when they thought we had\na menstruation, we didn't have to carry it. I mean logic, never logic. Uh I remember once\nmy...those shoes, those terrible shoes, were sticking in the snow and I couldn't get them out.\nAnd...and the last, and the women dragged me to the factory, absolutely dragged me. And I\nwas out of breathe for about a half hour before I could catch breathe. I was totally out of it.\nUh we walked through the village; and was night, you know--seven, or seven to seven. We\nnever saw daylight. And here there were lit windows, and at Christmas people had\nChristmas trees. And there were people living behind there, living normal lives; and we\nwere like animals, going back and forth, you know. Uh the...uh uh uh when we ran out of\nmaterial, I had to sweep. I had to run one of these big brooms. Horrible thing, to sweep for\ntwelve hours. The only thing is it gave me a possibility to move a little bit around the\nfactory, and I made contact with a Czech guy. At that time, we had some very sick people;\nand I asked him if he could get some pudding. And he did get some pudding, and he hid it\nin some material. And I went in and got the pudding and put it in my pocket, and brought it\nto this girl who was very sick. Uh I sent him a letter after the war, \"Thank you.\" And his\nfather answered that it was...he got the letter on his birthday; and he says, \"That was the best\nletter I could get, to find out how well my son behaved.\" Because, you see, these were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nCzechs. Uh Hitler gave the year 1924 to Germany; and all the Czechs who were born in\n1924 had to go and work as laborers in Germany. But they were able to go and visit, etc.\nAnd this is why I...the people with whom I made contact. Once, the Italian boys had a whole\nbig can of soup that got sour. They said, \"Do you want it?\" Of course, we ate it. We said,\n\"Well, we will think it's a potato salad. That's why it's sour.\" And we ate it. We get sick, so\nwe can't get sick. Uh uh it...it was...L..L.. This was the time when I really cried. I cried and\ncried in hours and hours, because with with the work, with everything, it was just foreign.\nAnd I was getting more and more desperate. And in uh December of that year, uh one of the\ngirls of our group--Hannah, her name was also Hannah Klein; she was exactly the year I\nwas in--became sick. And I became convinced (we didn't have a doctor) that she had\ntyphoid, because I worked so much with typhoid. There was a certain smell about it, too.\nSo she was moved into one empty room and I volunteered to be with her. And the girl\nthought...I thought really I was with so much typhoid, I'm immune. Nothing can happen to\nme. And which was not unrealistic, which was...I was pretty much immune. And the girls\ndidn't even thought I went a little crazy, you know; and I left her soup outside so the others\ncould pick it up, the two girls I met in Auschwitz. And uh she died on the 19th of December\n'44. And that was a really low point for me. That was a really low point for me. Now,\nmiraculously, this uh last Lageralteste allowed me to have a flashlight for her at night--\nwhich was unbelievable. And she did get a coffin, plain wooden coffin, for her. And so I\ndidn't have...I had washed her, and I didn't have anything. So I put newspapers. So they...I\ngot some newspaper, and I dressed her in the newspapers and stuffed it in the coffin. And it\nwasn't... And people asked, you know, \"You are crazy! Why are you doing it?\" You know.\n\"Nobody does that.\" And I said, \"That's the only piece of dignity I can give her, that I treat\nher. If I washed her when she was sick, why shouldn't I wash her now?\" This is the only\npiece of dignity I could give her. But it wasn't until years later when I realized that\nsomewhere in the back of my head--way, way back--was that the...what was the Jewish\ntradition. Visit the sick. Wash the dead. Comb them, clean them, dress them before they go.\nBut that was not conscious at all. They thought I'm crazy. Under these circumstances, I'm\nbrushing her and dressing her in newspaper. And she's buried there. In that camp, between\nOctober '44 and May '45, thirteen girls died. You might say that's not much--only thirteen.\nBut you have to remember, thirteen out of five hundred in less than...five, in six months...1n\nsix months, five...out of five hundred, thirteen people died. And we were the women\nbetween eighteen and thirty-five. So, then it's a lot. Uh one girl uh had five children. When\nshe realized that uh they were all gone, she went crazy. She went really crazy. But it took\nher that long to really accept it. Uh, miraculously that woman got coffins for these women.\nIt was unheard of. Unheard of. Once SS man came and asked us, \"What is the thing you\nwant the most?\" So we said things like a toothbrush. You know, we were used to it. You\nknow, a toothbrush was so basic. I had to repeated dreams, repeated dreams, about taking a\nbath and having a nice towel. You know? Which means, you know, necessities were for us.\nAnd so he promised us toothbrushes. Of course, we never got them. But this was kind of\nteasing, total teasing. Not being able to clean yourself. I remember in that camp, our\nwomen--some were, there was a group of people who had to wash the laundry also for the\nSS. And the SS had also lice. They said they had lice even in their handkerchiefs. I, one day,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nI saved...I didn't eat the bread at all, and I saved it and I exchanged it in some sort of a\ncontraption out of which I could make a bra. I wanted a bra so badly. For me, it was so basic\nI couldn't...so I just didn't eat the bread for a whole day so I would have a bra. You know,\nthe sort of left-overs of civilization. And I remember sitting on the bed, and looking and\nfinding my first louse. Finding my first louse was another absolute downer. This was like\nthe last drop of civilization was gone. So we had to look through for lice every day. Uh we\nall had one needle together. Needle got lost, which was a tragedy. So what did we do again?\nYou know what we did? We had uh uh... When we were all there, we had uh a game. You\nhad to make a menu card for a whole day, and then the next one had to make a menu card\nand you couldn't repeat it until everybody made all the menu cards for the week--you know,\nmaking menu cards. We were telling jokes. One of the girls read a book, uh [Margaret]\nMitchell's Gone with the Wind. I never read the book, but I remember her because she told\nus the whole contents of Gone with the Wind. We were telling, uh saying...uh reciting\npoems--anything to keep our minds going. Uh I knitted for one of the SS women a pair of\nsocks, because she was uh...gave, she gave me a printed material. We needed to read. I\nmean, for us, not being able to read was deprivation. And she gave me one of those\nHarl[equin]...uh romance-like things, you know--which was nothing, but I had something to\nread. Which was another necessity, you know. Uh she was a woman who could be...who\ncould blow hot or could blow cold. Uh when we came to the factory for the twelve hour\nshift, we got two little triangles, metal triangles, with DMV--\"Deutsche Metal Werke.\"\u201d\nAnd when we went to the john, we had to put one in. She was sitting there, so we could go\ntwice in the twelve hours. And, of course, we had diarrhea. It...1t was terrible there. And\nonce in a while, she talked to us and she told her boyfriend was at the front, etc. etc. And\nshe could...on the other hand sometimes she could beat up people. She was hot and cold.\nBut uh she did give me a piece of soap for the...for the socks. You did what you could. And\nthen we had one SS woman, Hanelle (ph), who warned...she didn't want to be SS woman.\nShe was drafted. And she warned us when the inspection came, and she escaped before the\nend of the war. Changed into a civilian. She didn't want any part of it. There were a few\ndecent people. Uh we had uh, at Christmas time, it was cold as could be (cough). The\nscrews on the inside of the barracks were white with ice. And we tried to celebrate New\nYear and do some fun and things, even under those circumstances. Uh (pause) uh you\nknow, one tried humanity even under these circumstances. And when toward the very end\nof the...of April, I didn't... didn't think I'm going to survive. I became very depressed. You\nsee how I talk now? I talked so slowly, that people didn't have patience to listen to me. I\ntrained myself to go to the bathroom every second day, to save strength. Uh...\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: You know, keeping our humanity under impossible situations was very important to us.",
        "Q: Yeah.\n> Actually denominated in Nazi records as VDM, for \"Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke.\"\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION [Sound backtracks at this point]",
        "Q: OK. We're going to continue in a minute.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Well, I didn't think I'm going to make it. The hills started to be green. Spring might come.",
        "Q: OK. We can start.",
        "A: Uh, as I say, I became very depressed. I didn't think I'm going to make it. We looked out.\nThe hills were green. It looked fine. Uh...and let me back-track. At the end, they didn't have\nany material. They shipped the machines away. The front was coming. There was a pocket\nof resistance around Breslau [Pol: Wroc_aw]. We were close to it. We could hear the\nshooting; and you know, we were happy and all the...we are [thinking], \"Maybe the end is\ncoming.\" And (cough) so they made work to do. Taking the bricks from here to there, then\nbringing them back, etc. In the camp next to us, one of the camps next to us, were Russian\nprisoners of war. But they were mostly the Mongolian--mustachioed, uh uh heavy-set uh\nSoviets. They were not Russians. They were Soviets. And we each had a bowl. That was the\nonly, we each had a bowl and...and a spoon. That was all we had. And it was so cold, you\nknow, at that time. So what we did is, uh we put it under the coat and put a string around us\nso, because we didn't have gloves. And again, we marched by five. And Mimi (ph) was the\noldest of us. She was thirty-five. She was old, you know. And Mimi was also the most flat-\nchested of all of us; and here she's going with the bowl, and one of the Mongolian guys\nstepped out of his line--with great danger--and to touch her, because he thought it was a\nbreast, and because... He touched the dish. Oh, we had...it was very dangerous for him; but\nof all of us, he happened to touch Mimi's dish. So of course, you know, this was like a irony\nof the whole thing. And uh you know, uh one of the...at the end, one of the girls was able\nthrough somebody else make a contact; because through the Czechs from the year 1924, we\nwere able to make some contact. Now, because there was not enough material, they were\ngoing to build from Nachod--which was across the border in Czechoslovakia--uh a railroad\nconnected with this on...on the Polish border. They were going to make a connection. And\nhe was supposed to go and start working on it. Some of the Czech women [NB: from the\nvillage] got together, even though it was rationing, got food and bribed the SS women by\ngiving them more food for allow our group to eat. They were wonderful. They were\nwonderful. So through them, there was also contact made with other Czechs in\nCzechoslovakia, etc., so that that walking... I was not among the group, but I knew about it.\nAnd was this contact with Nachod, and they were really truly wonderful. They did it at great\nrisk; but the SS women took the bribe of the food, because they didn't have that much either\nand thought they would allow other people to eat. Can you imagine with this rationing\neverything? And these [Czech] women at the great risk did it. Uh Bo_enna Levitova was\none of the women. Her husband was Jewish. She protected him; and her three children were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nall in camps. One in Theresienstadt, and two in Dachau. And she was doing this. Just a great\nwoman. And uh, so we knew the end was coming near, but we didn't know when. So, as I\ntold you, I trained myself not to go to the bathroom. I walked very slowly. Uh, I had these\nhorrible shoes to walk in. So these two girls had each extra shoes, so I walked. When the\nwar ended, I walked to liberation with two different shoes. But they were shoes. Uh as\ncamps go, this one was by no means the worst. This one was pretty good. Even so, we were\ngetting pretty desperate what's going on to happen. Uh came May 5, end of the war. The SS\njust opened the door and disappeared. We walked to Nachod. There was a tremendous uh\ncrowd of people, all going from east to west, escaping from the Russians, going westward.\nIn cars, wagons, uh motorcycles, bicycles--you name it. And we walked in the meantime to\nthe border. We came to the border. Nobody told us what we are going to do, nothing.\nSpontaneously, totally spontaneously, we stopped and sang the Czech anthem. It was so\nspontaneous, I can't tell you. In that moment of that anthem and crossing the border, it was\njust like this: I was to normal. I spoke normal. I walked normal. Everything was normal. It\nwas a real situation depression. And we walked into Nachod; and that night I volunteered\nfor Red Cross, because there was still shooting. The Germans were coming through. The\nRussians were chasing them. There was still shooting going on, so I volunteered for Red\nCross. And somebody brought us... Of course, they all saw in us that we are prisoners, how\nwe were dressed. Uh, uh they brought us the Czech bread--about this thick--and on it was\nthat much butter and honey. And I see the picture when I took that slice of bread with the\nbutter and honey, and I bit into it. You know, the teeth were singing! I remember that first,\neating that bread with the butter on it. We walked...uh we went to this uh Bo enna\nLevitova, and she took three of us... three of us in--this woman who had the children. She\nlet us to have a bath. She put us in a bed with pillows and covers. Uh Trude, who was a\nfriend of mine--we pinched each other at night. Is this a dream, or do we really sleep in a\nbed? And she fed us for a few days. This man whom I met on the street, who knew that\nJana, he come and gave each of us some money. On the streets, there was...they took down\nthe Hakenkreuz [NB: the Swastika] and put it on the floor. For one crown, everybody was\nallowed to clean his shoes in it. And uh this woman was just really terrific. All her three\nchildren returned. I have her picture. We visited her after the war.",

        "A: Uh my name is Hanna Brum.",
        "A: I was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, uh May 30th, 1922.",
        "A: I was very fortunate because we lived with my grandmother and grandfather in the same\nhouse. I was the only child. My mother had a child a year before me, but he died just before\ndelivery. So I was the first grandchild in the family. And I...all my first memories are about\nmy grandfather, and I feel very warmly about him. He died when I...three months before my\nthird birthday. But nevertheless, all my memories are about my grandfather. And we simply\nhad a love affair. Uh he would watch me to go across the street to buy his cigars. His cigars\nwere \"Virginki,\" which means that they were tobacco from Virginia. Uh we called them\n\"Virginki.\" And he watched me to cross the street and give my little money on the counter,\nand bring him uh his cigars. And he very proudly looked after me, that I was able to do it.\nSo at the very early childhood, he really pushed me to independence, to do things for\nmyself. I remember he had a little wooden stool with a crack in it. And I loved peanuts, but I\nwas very small to crack them. So I put the peanuts in that little crack, and he gave me a\nmallet; and I would push the peanuts and I could have to open it myself. And these are\nmemories that nobody could have really told me that uh about my grandfather. Or we went\nwalking; and uh I even remember the streets where we went. And he would give me a little\ncoin; and I would go inside and give my little penny on the counter, and uh--whatever it\nwas--and buy, you know, a little piece of candy. And he waited for me outside. And uh his\nbirthday was in March, and he died just shortly afterwards. And I came to him to give him\nmy little poem. I had to learn little tiny poems for the family, for the members of the family.\nThat was my gift for their birthdays--to learn a poem. And I went to tell it to him, and he\nalready didn't respond. I think he had a stroke. And I came out crying, because my\ngrandmother...uh my grandfather didn't kiss me and he didn't say, \"Thank you.\" That I don't\nremember. That I was told. It's interesting. I don't remember the kind of a rejection, which I\nthought at that time. That I only remember loving things about him. And my grandmother\nwas with us all my growing up. She had her birthday five days before mine; so we\ncelebrated, more or less, birthday together. She always kept a piece of her cake for me. She\nwas the one who told me stories. Uh I would crawl into her bed, and she would tell me a\nfairy tale I had heard about fifty-five times; but I wanted to hear it for the fifty-sixth time\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfrom her. Uh when I started going to school, she would cross the big street to help me cross\nback again. And I was more concerned about her crossing safely, but she was concerned my\ncrossing safely. So it got a little complicated there. But she was in many ways the mother on\nwhom I patterned my life. And she had in her...she had a very orderly closet. And in the\ncloset, she had a bag with her white shroud; and she knew according to the Jewish religion\nthis is how she would want to be buried, and wanted to be buried with my grandfather in the\nsame grave. She never had a chance to use that shroud even though we sent it with her to\nTheresienstadt [Czech: Terezin]. But I knew that['s] what she wanted. Uh that was a sort of\na thing to do every Sunday morning. We would go to Grandfather's grave, and we'd put\nlittle stones. That's a tradition--you put a little stone. And if she was not able to go, I always\nput a little stone for her on my grandfather's grave. And uh after the...after I returned I\nalways...when I'm in Prague go, and go to my grandfather's grave. And since we were not\nable to put her there, we had her...I had her name put on the same gravestone. And my\nrelatives in Prague are maintaining the grave, even though many...even though so many are\nneglected. And uh so she 1s there, at least in memoriam, as she wished to be.",
        "A: For the first five years I went to a Jewish school. It was more Zionistic Jewish school, not a\nreligious school. We were twenty boys and ten girls. Out of the ten girls, we were five\nHannas--because it was a very popular name. And out of the five girls, as far as...as far I can\nsay, I'm the only one who survived. Out of the twenty boys, I know about five survived. I\nam in contact with one of them; and just recently, he sent me a picture of the second and the\nfourth grade, which was a real find for me. After that, I went to gymnasium--which was the\nacademic level. And uh then I went into a business school, and I started working and be\nvery... I was always very, very independent, very, very quickly. And my father led me to\nindependence. Uh, I--as an eleven, twelve year old, I went to collect from his...from the\nbuilders money, so he would have for his payroll. And in the beginning they looked at this\nlittle girl who's coming to collect money, and would call my father: \"Is that on the level?\"\nAnd he said, \"Yes.\" And I gave them a receipt, signed it. He told them it's OK, because\nnobody had an idea that I was bringing payroll money. So he was leading me, again, pretty\nmuch to independence. Because my mother was uh a rather sickly woman who had frequent\npneumonias, who have had at least uh five, six miscarriages after me. I was the only live\nbirth uh child. So I was uh uh freely very much led to independence, almost compensating\nfor her; because she was really very shy, very sickly and had enormously uh uh heavy thick\nglasses because she was so near-sighted. Uh I was...my character was much more like my\naunt--my mother's sister--and my father, who was much more outgoing.",
        "A: Uh I was...uh I was fortunate in my age we were still able to have some social life and go to\ndancing schools. It's all, you know, with the long dress and uh formalities. I was still about\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe last year that['s] where we were able to do it. And at that time, I was going with uh a\nstudent who was three years my age--so I was about sixteen, he was nineteen--by the name\nof Rudolph Schiff. We called him \"Rudla.\" And uh when I was seventeen, and uh the gates\nwere closing on us uh and uh...things were starting really getting bad, we got married\nNovember 14th, 1939, at the City Hall. Again, there was no housing for us. I went home.\nHe went home in the evening, because there was no possibility. In his uh...his families lived\na couple of blocks away from us, so that was no big problem. And uh as uh the Germans\nwere closing in, we had to go into more and more cramped quarters. And his parents had a\nbig apartment what had it sub-divided. And each bedroom was given to another family. And\nuh the uh...so there was really no where to go. Then one of the families were sent with\ntransport to camp, so for couple of months we had one of the bedrooms. In the meantime,\nhe got scarlet fever. And at that time, when you had scarlet fever uh you had to go for six\nweeks into a hospital. Today, somebody with scarlet fever--it's [like] a strep throat. A\ncouple of days, and you are fine. They thought that you were infectious for six weeks, until\nyour started to peel. I had scarlet fever when I was in the first grade, so I knew what it meant\nfor six weeks to be in isolation--which I was. By the way, I was in that isolation at\nchildren|'s] hospital; and the children['s] hospital was run by nuns. And the nuns said...came\nto us and uh said, \"OK, children, get off your beds, kneel and pray.\" And I said to the nun,\n\"I'm sorry, I'm Jewish. I don't kneel.\" And so she said, \"What are you going to do?\" I said,\n\"I'm going to pray in bed the way my grandmother taught me.\" And that was that. I did not\nfollow the party line, and in many ways the nuns respected that. I was only seven--barely\nseven at that time, because I had my birthday in the hospital. And uh so he had scarlet fever.\nHe had to go to the hospital; and while he was in the hospital, they brought in his room a\nlittle four year old--little Frankie. Cute little Frankie. The parents were Polish uh emigres\nwho came to Czechoslovakia; and while he was in the hospital, they had to go with a\ntransport and leaving the child in the hospital. They didn't allow them to wait until he was\ndischarged. So my sister-in-law--my husband's sister, Margit--uh sort of adopted him and uh\nwas to take him. He went to Theresienstadt, and while he was there she took care of him.\nBut, of course, when she came with him to Auschwitz, she went to gas with him. But when\nhe...we had really difficulty during that time of all kinds. Uh during that time things were\ngetting worse in terms of uh getting supplies, buying food, working, going places. I\nremember going on the street and meeting one of my school friends. Of course, by that time\nI had the star; and as we came closer to each other, we walked slower and slower, thinking,\n\"Should I stop? Should I talk? Who was it worse for, her? Is it worse for me? What should\nwe go and do?\" So... And so we slowly came together, looked at each other, winked at each\nother, and passed again. It...1t was that sort of a situation. You had to think, \"Wait a minute.\nIs today Saturday? Saturday, I cannot go this place. Friday, I cannot get that place.\" Because\nthe restrictions were getting tighter and tighter. So it was a difficult time under any\ncircumstances. Uh, now Rudie--my husband--had a brother, Karel Schiff, who was finishing\nhis MD degree. By that time, Hitler came. And there were only two Jewish uh people who\nwere supposed to get their degree. You know, that big day in Europe--it was a much bigger\nday to get your degree. Uh they gave the degree to everybody; and they took the two Jewish\nfellows to the bathroom, and gave them their diploma in the bathroom. And uh he had, as I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsaid, a sister and a brother-in-law. None of them have returned. Uh, my father-in-law died in\nthe transport from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz. He died uh on the way. And my mother-in-\nlaw, was a very energetic woman, and brother-in-law were in the familienlager [Ger: family\ncamp]. And I was told how uh they knew what was going to happen to them. Uh, Rudla was\nwith them; and uh I understood he was quite sick. And uh he died probably before he went\nto gas--in the familienlager, you know.",
        "A: Uh, I remember the day they came. I remember the day I sto... remember the place, the\nstreet where I stood, and it was snowing. It was a cold day and they were pulling in - I was\nby myself. I just walked there. It was not far, maybe three-quarters of a mile from where we\nlived. And we were uh uh watching them on their wagons with their tanks, with their half-\ntracks, with guns pointing to the rooftops. And it was snowing. And we knew that the\nscrew is going to become tighter and tighter. Uh we knew what was happening in Austria.\nBut somehow we still had some foolish idea we are in Czechoslovakia. Because, I\nremember so clearly, when I was about eleven or twelve, I read a book about the Marranos.\nThese were the uh Jews in Spain who during the Inquisition had a choice either to give up\ntheir religion or be uh converted [to] Catholicism; and many of them became converted only\nin name, and still celebrated secretly all the Jewish holidays. And uh this was a very\ninteresting story about the Inquisitor, etc. And I remember--you know, the kind of vignettes\none remembers from childhood--I remember telling my grandmother, \"Aren't we fortunate\nthat we live in the 20th century in Czechoslovakia, that such a thing cannot happen to us!\"\nSix short years, six short years [later, it] happened to us. Not only as to them, but much\nworse. Uh, kind of took away from us the protection that 1t happens to somebody else but\nnot to us. One becomes and realizes how vulnerable one is.",
        "A: Uh, I worked at that time what they used to call a Palestina Amt [Ger: Palestine Office].\nUh, at that time there were still people able to move, uh emigrate. And of course, when you\nsigned your paper for emigration, if I was Hanna Schiff at that time, I had to sign it as\n\"Hanna Sarah Schiff.\" All the women had to put down \"Sarah,\" and all the men had to put\nin \"Israel\" as a mid...as a middle name. And I was go...going to the Department of Treasury\nwhere I filled up some papers, and uh they had to pay that much of a... They had to give a\nlist of all their property they were going to take with us in the suitcases, and they had to pay\nthat much for this and that much for that. And so I was working on that. And therefore, I\nknew that the Jacob Edelstein was the head of the Palestina Amt, and knew some people\nthere--which later became very important to me. Uh the... (pause) I worked during the time,\nbut I cannot... My father for instance, he owned a workshop. That was taken away; and he\nhad to start working again, because he didn't have such means. But fortunate my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ngrandmother lived with my parents. Uh my parents' maid--who was worked with us\nprobably ten, eleven years, was my mother's age--uh was very helpful and undemanding.\nAnd she went shopping, and she did what she could. But of course, her ration tickets were\nregular ration tickets; but our ration tickets were marked with a \"J,\" so we couldn't shop\nwhen there was food in the stores. We could shop only at certain hours for certain things,\netc. But nevertheless, she was very instrumental in helping us. Uh my parents were... Oh, I\nshould go back to one thing. At that time uh when the Germans came, of course, they went\nto the Jewish Kultusgemeinde--the religious and cultural community--and wanted the\nname[s] of the Jews. And from there, they named...got the names of the transport. And we\nwere so stupid, we went and we registered and we did what we could at that time. At that\ntime, I had an infection in this finger, and uh it was following up my arm. And, of course, I\ncouldn't go to the hospital. By the way, at that point we were not allowed to use the hospital.\nLittle bit later, there was one private hospital converted; and Jews were able to use that little\nprivate hospital, which was very crowded. But at that time, there was nobody; and the\ninfection was continuing. Uh the uh Aryan, non-Jewish, gentile uh fianc\u00e9e of my brother-in-\nlaw--of Karel Schiff--uh took me without a star into the hospital, told them I am her cousin,\nhad me operated, and took me by taxi home. By the way, we were not allowed to use taxis.\nSo at great danger to her--because she had to tell them I am her cousin--I was operated in a\nregular hospital, and she took me home. Because otherwise I wouldn't have been able to get\nhelp. I mean, these were the kind of things one doesn't even remember, because there were\nso many things that happened so often. But uh it was only because she had took me as her\ncousin, and she was a physician herself. Uh we were trying to hide a few things with some\nfriends, and some friends were very cooperative and kept them. Uh some friends were\nafraid. And some friends decided if we don't come back, you know, they will keep it. It very\nmuch depended on which person. Uh I was just trying to think of something, and it just\nescaped me. Uh (SHORT PAUSE) that the... we helped by our listening to the orders to go\nand register people so they can be sent by transport. And it depended uh what you did,\nwhere you lived, how you went with it. So you were continuously threatened: \"Am I going\nto be on the next transport?\" Uh, of course, I'm not even talking about it that we had to give\nup uh jewelry, radio and so forth. Because if we listen to radio, it was dangerous, uh\nbecause all these restrictions were coming out. At one point, Heydrich--who was the\nprotector of Czechoslovakia--uh was uh killed on one of the streets when two paratroopers\nwho were sent from England were...threw a hand grenade under the car. And uh he was\nkilled, and they were looking for them. And it was told that one was on a bicycle. So they\ncame around us and looking and confiscating bicycles and all of that. And we knew daily\nhow many, we had uh lists of people. They were in the newspaper. They were posted lists of\npeople who were shot, who were hung, etc. etc. Friend of mine was among them. Political\nreasons, or whatever reasons there were. It was like if you were in... It was a screw. It was a\nforever tightening screw, with more regulations. And the screw was tightening over our\nheads. Uh my parents went in July-- June or July...at the end of July (cough), July of '42, uh\nto Theresienstadt. My grandmother went with them. My grandmother was at that time bed-\nridden most of the time. Her mind was fine. Her hair was black. At eighty-six her hair was\nblack and was long; and when I was good, I was allowed to braid it. And uh she...her mind\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas fine; but when my parents packed and went, uh she went with them because she lived\nwith them. And when they came to carry her down, they carried her on a litter down the\nstaircase and put her with the other old people on the bottom of a spediteur [Ger: \"moving\nvan\"], of a moving van. And that's how they took her to the gathering place. The last word\nfrom her was: \"Love each other. Be good to each other. Love each other. Be good to each\nother.\" As they carried her down the steps. There was no complaint; there was just kind of a\nblessing. And from my mother, I know--because I met my mother in Theresienstadt--she\nsaid in the moment she came to the gathering place, with all the commotion and all that\ncraziness with her, she became so confused. She didn't know what was going on. She\ndoesn't know what was happening to her. And uh they took her to Theresienstadt,\nnevertheless. They put them on trucks. You know, the kind of trucks when you move the\nbeds so to slide things off. And then how they slid the old people off when they brought\nthem to Theresien|stadt], so they put them to bed. She died three months...three weeks after\narriving at Theresienstadt. And I was told [by] somebody she was begging for couple cubes\nof sugar from somebody who came to see her. And she was buried in one of the last mass\ngraves at that time. The reason I know, when we came back after the war to Theresienstadt,\nwe went to look up the original records. And in the original records, it showed when she\nwas buried and what was the mass graves. We went to the field, because you could still see\nwhere they dug the furrows, put the bodies in and put the soil over it. So it was always like\nheaps and valleys, heaps and valleys. So we could figure out, of course; because, you know,\nGermans registered which row it was in. So we could count about which row it was, put\nsome flowers on her, and had her name put on the grave. Because that's about all I could do\nfor my grandmother at that time. But my memory of her is that her last word was \"Be good\nto each other, and love each other.\" There was not many people to whom one could transfer\nit, but that was her last words.",
        "A: Uh, as I said, we were living with the in-laws and we knew that it's tightening. And we were\nin bed reading--I remember it so clearly. Stenbeck. John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.\nAnd the knock on the door came, and our invitation to the transport. I don't think I ever\nfinished reading the book. Uh we packed very carefully the suitcases. Very carefully;\nbecause this was the only possessions we were going to have. When we came to\nTheresienstadt we never got the suitcases. Our transport, which was the first transport of\nfifteen hundred people, gave these suitcases as a gift to the German nation for the bombed-\nup people. So I was so glad we had contributed something. But we... For the next years,\nwe...we had only what we carried on our backs. Fortunately, uh when we came to the\ngathering station, uh we were told--we were fifteen hundred people--and all of a sudden said\nonly a thousand will go. All the women will be pulled out. Then they pulled us back, so I\ndidn't have the... They took my number next to my husband, and they gave me another\nnumber. So I went through all the years in Theresienstadt as \"Transport BA\" and \"Number\n1101.\" And uh in...uh during the time in this gathering place that used to be exhibition hall,\nuh we were... Over the mar...over the PA system came: \"Anybody who has money on him,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nor gold or cigarettes or matches will be shot, da da da da.\" I had all of this on me. We had\nto, because we had to protect ourselves somehow. In the lining of our coats, I had a\nmetal...you know, Yardley talc used to come in a metal box. In that box, I had some jewelry.\nAnd so you heard all of this, and nevertheless you had to sort of stay with it. We came to uh\nour BohuSovice. At BohuSovice was the train stop for Theresienstadt. And as I said--I don't\nknow if I said it, my husband was rather weak and sickly at that point. And we carried a big\nbag--each tried to hold one handle--in which were food, mostly, and in the other side we\neach had a bed roll. And on our backs, we had a knapsack with just a change of few things.\nTurned out that was the only thing we had for the next years, what we carried with us.\nWhen we came to BohuSovice there, in front of the train was Jacob Edelstein, whom I\nknew. And I said, \"Hello,\" to him; and he said to me, \"Try to get yourself to confirmed to\nwork as soon as possible.\" I didn't know what it meant. But what it meant: if you are not\ngoing to get work immediately, then be [perfect (ph)] that you could go on. And many of\nour people. Of course, I went with all possible speed about protect ourselves. At that time,\nuh all the uh civilians of Theresienstadt were evacuated; and whole Theresienstadt belonged\nto us. Because before the people were only in the kaserne [Ger: \"barracks\"], into the\nbarracks; and the civilians were in the town. We were able to move around. I was very short\nfor a house; and I went to get myself confirmed, and I found a job as a nurse. There were\ntwo small houses right opposite of the main kaserne, where the uh leadership was; and it\nwas... Germans in their organizations took away all the names of the street. And because\nTheresienstadt was built as a grid, they called all these named \"L,\" and these named \"quer,\"\n[Ger: \"crosswise\" |--\"Q\" and \"L.\" \"Lang\" [Ger: \"lengthwise\"] and \"quer.\" So Q told, you\nwould know, typical German. So we were... these two houses were L-17 and L-19, 217 and\n219. These were two smallish villas that were joined together; and that was to become the\nhospital. The first doctor was Hans Schauffer (ph), a gynecologist from--I'm sorry, a\npediatrician--from Brno; and he eventually had three young doctors with him. We had first\nchildren who had whooping coughs. At that time there was no antibiotics, no vaccination.\nThe only thing what we had was Persan...not Persantil. I can't...1 told you the name, and I\ncannot remember now. Uh, from P. It was a sulfa drug. It made by Bayer at the same time.\nAnd it was red and it created everything, dyed everything red. And there was few people\nwho had some uh uh sulfa that was Cibasol, made by Ciba in Switzerland. But that was very\nvery rare to get. And if these children got... Protosol, was I think the name. Uh when they\ngot it, even their vomit from the coughing, everything was red. Now, we had in these two\nsmall villas, there was a iron bed next to iron bed. There were not even little aisles in\nbetween them, because there was no space. Uh if laundry was possible, maybe it was\nchanged every week, maybe every two weeks for these children; because we didn't have the\nlaundry available. It was very difficult to get it. So all what we had was us and the kindness,\nto try [to] wash them. Also, so many of the children got impetigo...impet--I don't know what\nyou call. And they were only painted with some purple--I don't know what you call that--\npurple dye to neutralize it.' Uh, at that time little TB came also; and we had one beautiful\nbright thirteen year old die of TB. His brother's still alive, and is a friend of mine. Uh many\n' Possibly gentian violet?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nof these, uh the mothers couldn't visit them. There were no visiting hours. It was impossible\nto get visitors in. There was only through the windows; because it was so crowded and\nmany of these things were infectious. At that time came a very big uh ...epidemic, at that\ntime for Theresienstadt, of scarlet fever and eventually typhoid-- abdominal typhoid. And\nthe scarlet fever, the whole hospital was converted to scarlet fever hospital. Now, we came\nin and out; we didn't have any disinfection. I had sort of a...a...what we would call today a\nrunning suit, in black-- sweatsuit--and I had a...somebody gave me a white apron. And we\nhad only one advantage. And this was a terrific advantage; because of our two small villas\nthere was a small bathroom, and you were able... There...there was a kettle, and you could\nmake fire, you can have... So two of us at a time could take a bath. And that was very, very\nprecious for us. That we worked twelve hour shifts, and we could go and have a bath. Now\nwhen I meant \"shift,\" that means we had to serve the food, which was brought in kettles.\nWe had to wash the dishes. We had to wash the floors. We had to make the fire. We have to\nwash the patients. We had to do everything, because people couldn't come in to do other\nthings. We did everything. We did get a little tiny bit of extra. Little tiny bit of extra food.\nBut it was a very little tiny bit of food, and because my husband was sickly and he couldn't\nwork, I was giving him the extras, anyhow. Uh it was hard work. It was hard work with the\nchildren. It was hard work with the people. At that time, typhoid started coming in, as I said.\nAnd we had one man, his name was Rudolph...uh, Rudie Kohn...Cohen, from Germany;\nand he and Rudie...and Robert Kohn, was Cohen and Kohn were in the same room. And\nthey both had scarlet fever and typhoid. And I was on duty when Rudie died. And uh Robert\nwas there; but this was our first real... No, he wasn't the first one; but from the typhoid was\nthe first death we had in the hospital. Uh, Robert eventually did not survive. And then we\ngot seven children who had both scarlet fever and typhoid. And because they were [live or\narrive (ph)] through the yard, there were two rooms with a little bathroom and that was\nmade to the wards for them. One room had two, and the other one had the less. And there\nwas a Stove, so (cough) as I said, we had to wash the floor and keep the fire going and wash\nthe dishes, because people couldn't come in. Uh we washed them. We cleaned them. We did\nget typhoid shots. We got them in our shoulders, not in our arms, so we could work. And I\nhave...the only thing we had to protect us from the typhoid was Lysol. We had Lysol, so we\nput. And we also knew the only infection from typhoid is goes through excretions. So when\nwe dealt with excretions, we put the Lysol in the water and washed our hands. That was the\nonly thing we had. Uh we had two boys--seventeen, one sixteen--and then little girls. The\nyoungest one was Misha Lausher (ph). Uh one day I came in and they brought a little...was\na little feverish girl in. I said, \"What's your name?\" And she says, \"Misha.\" I said, \"Misha\nLausher!\" That was my cousin's child. She was only five or six years old, but she knew her\ntemperature for the last three days. A very bright child, in spite of everything. And her\ndrawings, I kept; because she couldn't talk with her parents and be in contact. I was the only\ncontact. I would take what she has written or drew, and I ironed it out with the heat; and this\nis...1 could carry it out with them. And at that time, Misha has made--now this child was six\nyears old--she drew a picture of a garden and a tree with a bird on it; and the bird had an\nopened beak and out of it came letters. And I said, \"What is this?\" And this is what she\n[said]: \"It whistles.\" And she gave me the note, \"It whistles.\" Misha is the only one who\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsurvived, of all the seven children. (Pause) Uh, and for the parents, 1t was heart-breaking.\nThey were outside. They didn't know what was happening to their children. They didn't\nknow how they were. We were the only contact what we could tell them. In the meantime,\nthey were afraid they will be called into transport and the children would be left there;\nbecause they didn't know what was going to go on.",
        "A: Uh, not much. Not much. Uh, he was in the the men's barracks the first time; and he was\nreally going down the drain. He didn't wash properly. And that was always a very bad sign,\nwhen you didn't keep up with your personal hygiene. Uh, I had to go up into the kaserne--\nand the men knew me--and clean up his bed, and clean up this and that. And uh he was\nsickly. He really couldn't do much. It was getting worse and worse; and uh he was, in many\nways, resentful that I had the work and I could do that. And I remember when I came after\nnight shift...worked on the night shift, and I wanted to sleep during the day. He woke me up,\nbecause here I was. It was very, very difficult. It was getting very difficult. And the\nmarriage...I, you know, I was seventeen at that time and a naive. And as time went on, I\nrealized more and more that the marriage could not last. When I--if I may back-track--uh,\nwhen uh I...when we came to uh Theresienstadt, my parents were there already for three\nweeks. Uh, and couple...after I was there about... So therefore I knew about my grandmother\nfrom my mother; and my mother had her suitcases, I think. I don't even remember if I got\nsomething from her or not. Because they did get their suitcases; but they were there maybe\nonly uh three weeks, month at the most, and they got called in a transport. And I went with\nthem as far as I could go before the collection place. And I was giving goodbye to my father\nand to my mother--in a way, much more emotionally to my father--and I knew in my heart\nof hearts that I was never going to see them. I really knew that I'm never going to see them\nagain. And uh as far as I can see, tracing, they were somewhere in Poland. Uh the book says\nnobody knows where it was; but our maid, our Maru (ph), was in touch with them through\nsome gendarme and sent them packages for a while. And I think they must have been\nsomewhere at that point where L'vov [Pol: Lwo\u00e9w] is--which is Ukraine now. And uh we\nwere there two years ago, and I asked what were...what were the camps around there; and\nthey told me there was a great many camps there. But nobody could put their finger on it\nwhen I asked. And uh as far as I can again trace it, my father survived there and went to\nAuschwitz. Because somebody saw him in Auschwitz; and which was quite miraculous\nbecause by that time he was 55. And as...and he probably--as I say there's no certainty--\nended when one of those three big ships that were loaded with prisoners and sank in\nFebruary of '45 in the Baltics, in the North Sea. Uh, my mother, I don't know. Uh, but I\nknew quite sure that I was not going to see them anymore. Uh, meanwhile some more\ndistance relative came through, and they went. So we were forever living under a threat.\nWho is going to be in the next transport? Who is going to be in the next transport? And\nbecause I was...we were graded, we were rostered, and I was always fairly well\neraded...rated as a nurse, I was protecting my husband for a while, even though he didn't\nwork. And how did I get confirmed for a job? I went to this big kaserne, to this big barracks.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nYou know, these were big stone barracks with many, many hallways and yards; and I was\nlooking for the labor department. And I knew the name of the labor department's name\n[NB: head] uh was Robert Weinberg, who's... I knew about him from when I worked in\nPrague in the Palestina Amt. But I didn't know him in person; and I know his nickname was\n[\"\"Winczi\" (ph)]. And I go the hallways, and I'm looking for the office; and I meet a person\nand I say, \"Where is the office of [Winczi (ph)|?\" And the man looks at me. Says, \"Well,\nhow do you know my nickname?\" And he was just that person I met. And, of course, he\nwas helpful that I got confirmed for work. It was just coincidences all along. Coincidences\nall along. Uh, so things got pretty bad that I really couldn't tolerate 1t anymore; and the\nmarriage ended. Which would have been ending, anyhow. Even if my husband had\nsurvived, it would have ended. And he went with the December transport, with his parents\nand his brother. Uh, and they went to the familienlager--Karel Schiff, the doctor--and uh he\nknew what was the end, and my mother-in-law, too. Uh Rudla died probably of encephalitis\nin the familienlager. I had heard that he was asking for some mashed potatoes, for\nsomething to eat; which was, of course, impossible. And uh I uh made a friendship and then\nbecame a wife of one of the young doctors in the hospital. His name was Bruno Mandel. He\ncame from Prost_jov, in Moravia. He...he was there with his mother. Officially, we couldn't\nget a divorce and get married; because it was outside of the other jurisdiction. But within the\njurisdiction of Theresienstadt, we got on papers changed that I would be divorced and\nmarried to Bruno after the war. And when we were... And I volunteered to go to Auschwitz\nwith Bruno. We were the first transport of fifteen hundred people. Again, the second time\naround. There were five hundred women were allowed to volunteer. There were five\ntransport of thousand men; and with the last one, five hundred women were allowed to\nvolunteer. So, of course, I volunteered. And uh Bruno was carrying with him the papers, to\nbe sure he had them with him. Uh, the... I don't know if I'm jumping from here to there...",
        "A: We worked closely in the hospital. He was uh...he was an internist. He would have trained\nfor cardiology. He would have liked cardiology, and he would have been very good at it. Uh\nhe has uh...uh he was very involved in his patients, and I could see it. So, you know, we\nworked together day by day. This is...this is the best I can say. It was very, very difficult,\nwith all kinds of obstacles. Because these two private houses had a tiny little garden. We\nhad a tiny little plot where we could plant little radishes or something, which was the only\nfresh food one could get. And uh it...1t was both the proximity and the idea. He was also\nvery kind to me, which was very different from Rudie. Uh, he spoke um English; and we\nwere reading together Lady Windermere's Fan.\u201d And I tried to read it and had to translate it,\nbecause he was trying to help me with English. He was trying to help me. We went over all\nthe bones, so I would know them in Czech and German and Latin, in anatomy; and uh uh he\nwas teaching me a great deal. He was ten years older than I. And uh so he was teaching me\n* A play by Oscar Wilde.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\na great deal, too. And uh I knew he valued me a great deal, too. So, you know, these were\nall the things. Don't forget, I was there by myself. And at that time, his mother very much\nwanted me to be with him; while uh at Rudla's parents were also saying what am I doing. So\nI was under a great deal of pressure, besides working twelve hours a day, six days a week.\nSo it was a great deal of pressure all around it. Nevertheless, we went in the evening to\nlectures that were held on the...under the rooves of the meetings. We were working under\nthe uh we went to every cultural situation we could go to. Uh at that time, they started\nsending the transports of the older Germans. And they told them, of course, they were going\ninto a sanitor1um. So they came in fur coats and big hats. And here they were brought from\nthe train. At that time, ghetto had sixty thousand people, instead of the six thousand in\nnormal times. And they were put under the rooves of the big kaserne. Now, these were huge\nrooves with huge uh...uh wooden beams; and they were behind the beams, in front of the\nbeams. You didn't know if they were... I was in one of the transport. I was delegated to go\nand help out. You didn't know if they were sleeping, or if they were dead already; because\nthey... It was cold in winter. It was hot in summer. And here they came, with their fur coats\nand hats; and, of course, all...the most of the work in Theresienstadt was done by young\nCzech Jews, because we were the main occupation. So they would say, \"If Hitler only knew\nwhat the Czech Jews are doing to us!\" They still couldn't comprehend it, they couldn't put it\ntogether. So, of course, the survival rate there, the hygiene there, was impossible. There\nwere no bathrooms, you know. Uh it was uh...uh there were the uh the survival rate was\nvery, very small. Uh, my aunts came through Theresienstadt, and then they went on; and\nthen came my aunt, with her two children, who was most closest to me. Uh, they...we were\nfour years apart--Eva...Raymond was at that time sixteen, and Joe was twelve. And they\ncame in in October '42. In October '42, in the beginning. And my aunt was legally blind.\nShe was very, very near-sighted, just like my mother. And she was legally blind; and\nbecause I was a nurse, I was able to go with her in the...into the gathering place. And they\nwouldn't even let them go in Theresienstadt. They kept them there, in the gathering place, as\nthey arrived, immediately prepared for a transport to go on. We did everything to get them\nout, but we couldn't. So I took Eva and Joe out of there, and took them where --I have to\nexplain to you, describe to you where we lived. And I took them where we lived, and I put\nthem in my bed. And I - this is my memory - they had boots on. The two pairs of boots\nunder my bed, and they were on the bunk sleeping together so they would at least get some\nrest to go on. And when I returned them, my aunt told me, \"I know I'm not going to survive.\nI know I'm not going to be back. But I know that you will take care of the children.\" I would\nhave, had...had they survived. When I returned, I was hoping that one of them would come\nback. But, of course, they didn't. Eva threw out of the window a card on the way to\nAuschwitz, which was addressed to [Jiri Pollack (ph)], who happened to be my school-\nmate. And after the war, I met him; and he told me that he got a post card from her on the\nway to Auschwitz which she threw out and somebody picked up and mailed. They were the\nfirst transport to Auschwitz from Theresienstadt. No children and uh women survived; and\nof the men who survived, there were not too many. That was uh 27th of...they arrived 27th\nof October in '42.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Uh, a great deal. Uh (pause) when we came in, we lived in a former brewery. All the nurses\nwho worked with the infectious diseases lived in this brewery. So there was on the second\nfloor, there was a kitchen; and behind it--as I said, I don't remember--three or four rooms.\nSo if you went to the last room, you had to go through all the other rooms. And in my room,\nwhich was the second one - the first one was a very small one and there was three bunks,\nand then in ours and there were two, four, six, eight people living in the other one. And, of\ncourse, we went through to the other one. And uh in these eight bunks we were all the\nnurses who came in from day shift, night shift, you know. So we knew each other. We\nworked together. And uh the life was there...at that time men could visit. Uh, we got sheets\nas a little curtain. And the privacy was minimal. Because, if you realize, when you washed\nyour hair, you were there washing your hair from water you brought from somewhere. And\nthe men were coming into the rooms that were past your room, and seven other people were\nthere. It was difficult life, very difficult life. The one advantage was that I was able to take a\nbath in the hospital when we went off the shift. Uh, later I worked in a hospital where they\nhad encephalitis; and that was uh also at one time there was encephalitis. I worked with\nsome older people. When I worked uh I had a night shift at uh hospital where all the older\npeople were. I found my grandfather's sister there, who was in her eighties at the time. I\nwas giving out dinner, or whatever it was, and I was able to give her an extra potato. And\nAunt Antonia was so happy she got the extra potato. Uh it was such a intensive life, because\neven with all this long work, and all the social things and all the personal things was going\non, and all diseases around you. One day came a message that two hundred children from\nPoland are coming through. They were to be deloused, washed, bathed and dressed and\nprepared for a trip to Switzerland. [SOUND DISAPPEARS FOR APPROXIMATELY\nONE MINUTE OR MORE AT THIS POINT; APPPARENT TECHNICAL\nPROBLEM] [And some nurses were allowed to go and be with them; and for volunteering\nwith them, they were supposed to protect their families.

        "A: So one day two hundred children were...\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Uh, oh day two hundred children were sent to Theresienstadt from Poland to be deloused,\nwashed, fed uh...fed a little bit and put clothes on. And uh we were told that uh if uh some\nof us nurses would volunteer uh for to go with them, we would be uh able to protect our\nfamilies. I packed up few my things, but I was told that anybody who was married cannot\ngo. Only single people. I knew some of the nurses who went. They went straight to gas.\nApparently, uh there might have been some ideas; but they were misbegotten. And the\nchildren were transported back and forth, and annihilated. Uh the...uh there were many kind\nof things that one was never certain what will be happening, and that was the worst part,\nthat we were continuously in uncertainty. There was a Damocles uh sword hanging over\nyou all the time. You never knew how much time you had for what. Uh the daily\ndifficulties, the daily life difficulties. For instance, as crowded as we were, the hygiene as\npoor as it was, the laundry as impossible as it was. There were bed bugs. In summer, it was\nsuffocatingly hot. We lived so close together. So sometimes people tried to sleep out in the\nyard uh because not only that it was hot, but the bedbugs were multiplying and biting. The\nfleas were multiplying and biting, which made it also much more difficult to rest. I\nremember a scene where we got very little soap. The soap, we got rationed soap. The soap\nwas of horrible quality. It was like a little stone. And I remember being in the yard, and\nwashing my laundry with this little bit of soap, and there was a little bit left over. Every little\nbit of that soap was precious. Now at one point we were issued money, and we could buy\nthings for the money. And one of the things you could buy was a little bit of mustard, or a\nlittle bit of ketchup, or so...another piece of this terrible soap--if they, if it was available.\nNow people were getting packages from abroad. It was wonderful. At one point--you see,\nthere were always periods, they were like windows of permission, when you were able to\nget packages. And some people were able to get packages. The Danes were the best off;\nbecause the King and the Danish people, they were able to get a monthly five kilo--not\npound, eleven pounds--five kilo package with salami, butter, cheeses, from Denmark. That\nwas the gift of the Danish government to the few, few Danish Jews in Theresienstadt. There\nwas a number also of prominents. These were Germans and Austrians, who during the war\n[NB: the First World War] got an uh...uh the Iron Cross, or any of the very high medals.\nAnd they were protected in Theresienstadt. They were not sent on, at one point. For some\nreason, that was honored. Uh of course, during the time Edelstein, who was a Judenaltester,\nwas a wonderful man; and he did what he could. But he himself was deported; and we had\nother Judenaltester which made things worse. But nevertheless, there was this tremendous,\nvibrating cultural life. I remember seeing Fledermaus, a whole production of Fledermaus.\u2019\n\u00b0 Viennese operetta by Johann Strauss.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nUh, I remember going to a poem reading. There were philosophical debate. There were\nconcerts. Uh there was this need to live very intensively. And I think this was about the\nessence of Theresienstadt. You had these few years, so you have to live them so intensively.\nYou have to use every minute you had. During that time I also had pneumonia at one point.\nI had uh middle ear infection, where they had to trepanate my ear drum; and you know with\nall the things we have, I was sitting in a chair like this, and they punctured my ear drum.\nAnd uh, you know, few things of that sort one had to endure. And you either got well or you\ndidn't get well, though there were not many choices. Uh I remember in the room be...ahead\nof ours was Sister Miriam. Sister Miriam was a nun from Austria, of a Jewish background,\nbut was converted to Christianity; and was a Catholic nun for about thirty years. She was in\nher fifties when she came. A kind, gentle soul. Now, of course, as a nun, she was shaved\nand wore a wig when she went into the public. And of course, all of a sudden she had to\nshow herself without hair. But she worked as a nurse. She eventually died of cancer in\nTheresienstadt. But for her, it was an absolute--not only a cultural shock--shocking... It was\na destroying of her life in any direction in which she had. Nevertheless, she showed a great\ngentleness and great kindness towards everybody, in spite of everything. Uh for instance, if\nyou, they had a laundry. You were allowed to go there so many days, for so often, and bring\nin your laundry; and about two weeks later you got it back. So with few things it was very\ndifficult. There was also a shoe repair, where you could get some shoes repaired because\nwe could not replace anything, but everything was a difficulty. When they were opened,\nwhen you had your work hours, when you got it back. Everything was difficult. And then\nyou have the sight of Theresienstadt was the hearses. Because the hearses were brought\nfrom all over, from all over Czecho...not all over Czechoslovakia, all over Bohemia, from\nthe Jewish uh cultural groups that brought to the cemetery in their own hearses. So the\nhearses were brought in; and not only the sick people, but the bread was transported, and\nwood was transported, and everything was transported on the hearses. Because these were\nthe only wagons. Uh then there was uh the comedy--organized and directed by Germans--\nwhere one day we were supposed to get the visit by the Red Cross. The houses were painted\nonly outside, where the inspection was going to take place. We got better food for a week.\nThe children were told if they... somebody comes to interview of them... Seidl was the SS\nman there, that they had. And they were supposed to say...they were supposed to get a box\nof sardines and say, \"Uncle Seidl, Uncle Seidl! Sardinen schon wieder!\" [Ger: \"Uncle\nSeidl, Uncle Seidl! Sardines again!\"] That became the joke. Uncle \"Seidl.\" Calling him\n\"Uncle Seidl.\" \"Schon wieder\"--\"Again we are getting sardines!\" Of course, we never ate or\nsaw sardines. But here they was giving them, and showing: \"We are getting it again!\" You\nknow. It became such a joke. We did get the coffee house at the end, where this concert,\nwhere you could see. Uh we used to call about the coffee, what you, how you make the\ncoffees. You take one coffee bean, put it on a string and wave it over hot water. Uh the\nmiracle was that the water was somehow blackish. It was chicory mainly. And uh it was\nwarm. Uh then there was the counting of the people. One day there was counting of the\npeople where all people had to go to this big meadow and there was this counting that was\ndocumented in films, etc. Uh we were, we were in the with the children in the hospital, so\nwe didn't have to go; so we spent that lovely day in the hospital. But only taking of the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nchildren, but it was so terrible because we didn't know what was happening with everybody.\nWe didn't know what was going on. We didn't know what was going to happen to them. We\ndidn't know what was going to happen. It was, I remember that day was so full of tension\nand misery because what were we supposed...what's going to happen. We didn't know. It\nwas a terrible day, and then another kind of drudgery. A woman from Germany came, with\na retarded child. This is, today we would say, the most profound retarded child I have ever\nseen. Was seven years old, couldn't sit, couldn't talk. Anything. And nevertheless, this\nwoman tended this child so tenderly through seven years of... He was like a newborn child,\nexcept this big; seven years old. And you looked around, and you kept thinking of the\nhuman tragedy of this woman under these circumstances, was tending this child so tenderly.\nAnd you knew what's going to be in for her. Uh, in uh one of the other barracks was uh a\nlittle section for insane, where they were one day loaded and went in those transport, of\ncourse. I'm trying to... You know, there are so many stories that keep, you know, dropping\nout.",
        "A: Leo Baeck? No, no. Uh, you know, as as I come all these different memories um pick\nup...(pause) of the various hospitals. Uh I was working for one time only... Of course,\nanother thing--there were abortions. Uh Doctor Hahn, who was a gynecologist in Brno,\ncame. And he was making abortions, because if women get pregnant they knew what it\nmeant. Uh, so abortions were performed. Nobody talked about it; but abortions were\nperformed, because they had to be performed. They were done by the gynecologist as kindly\nas could be. And that wasn't...that was a sheer necessity to do. And uh it...it was a survival.\nSee, I'm...I'm trying... You know, there are so many aspects to look at; and I was in\nTheresienstadt from '42 until '44, for two and a half years. So there are a lot of stories, you\nknow. How to replenish the few things how you you brought with you? At one point I was\nable to make contact; and I sold my... First, I sold a few of the...used up money I had on\nblack market to buy extra food. The extra food was smuggled in by the Czech gendarmes.\nUh so we bought some, as much as we could. And uh finally...we were allowed to keep a\nwedding ring, so I sold the wedding ring--exchanged it for bread. I thought the bread was\nmore important. Again through the gendarmes. Uh Misha's mother, Irma Lausher, my\ncousin who had...who was teaching the children in the youth home, she was uh...she has an\nincredible memory. And she wrote me books of poems for my birthday. And even under\nthese circumstances we tried to celebrate birthdays. You know, a slice of bread, a small loaf\nof bread was a wonderful birthday present. Somebody saved it up, or had the connections.\nUh the the tendency was to try to uh maintain as normal life as possible. Misha's father had\nthe access to go little bit uh where there was a little bit of grass; and he planted some\ntomatoes, so that Misha would have some fresh food. And tended it tenderly. The\ninventiveness of people under the circumstances was incredible. There was a group of\nwomen who worked in agriculture, so who were sometimes able to smuggle something in.\nIt was not for us they worked on the agriculture. Oh, another interesting thing was--as I say,\nthese stories keep popping in my mind--uh Lidice was the Czech village where as uh\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nrevenge for the Heydrich affair, the Germans went and killed the men and many of the\nwomen and some of the children; and the left-overs they sent to Ravensbrick. I knew some\nof them. And there was this cleaning up to do, and there were sheep and goats and cows. So\nsome of men from Aus...from Theresienstadt were commandeered to go to Lidice to clean it\nup and bring in the animals. That was not known, you know; but the guys from\nTheresienstadt did the cleaning up. Uh they were, once another group of men were sent to\nanother uh transport in some woods to do some very hard work. I don't remember where it\nwas. And the one man wanted to get out of it. And he thought that would help him; and\nhe...he drank, I don't know if it was turpentine or gasoline, or he drank some substance that's\ncompletely ruined his lower intestines. And he was...he uh defecated himself to death when\nhe, they returned him to Theresienstadt. He defecated himself to death actually trying to\nescape this way. Uh but it was through all of this pressure, there was this constantly...\nTransports are going. Are you going to be on the next transport? Are you going to be saved\nfrom the next transport? Who can you stay? Who is going to go? And, of course, the\npressure on the people who made the lists were as well. Are you going to save your family?\nWho is going? Uh, my father's cousin came through who I was very fond of. I knew he was\ngoing. So you know, how do you - as a very young woman - how do you try to keep any\nkind of normalcy under these circumstances? Very diff... with very great difficulty. And\nsomehow still stay uh a human being, feeling human being.",
        "A: Yeah, I saw a couple of them. I didn't assist but I uh... I don't know if I assisted actually. I\nwas there uh when uh when uh Hahn performed it, a couple of them in Hamburg Kaserne.\nYeah, I saw them; but I don't know how much I assisted in it actually, at the time because I\nwas total novice. He would have told me, \"Give me this, uh that.\" I didn't, you had to take\nthe dilator from the smallest to the biggest and then you have to stretch out. But I remember\nbeing there, and seeing it done. You know, they were very skillful doctors; very skillful\ndoctors who did, under impossible situations, really wonders. And who tried to be very\nhumane.",
        "A: Yeah, you know, the irony... Hans Schauffer (ph) was the doctor who was the head doctor\nin the children's hospital, where Bruno was. He was uh uh he was, he had a...he was deathly\nafraid of typhus. Not typhoid. He worked with typhoid all the time. Typhus. Typhus...the\ndifference is typhoid is abdominal typhoid, which 1s different. Typhus is transferred from\nperson to person with the lice. You have to have lice to get typhus. He died with typhus later\nin the camp.",
        "A: He had like a premonition. He was always afraid he will die with typhus, and he did. He too\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwent through a divorce and another marriage in Theresienstadt. I knew all about the\nintrigues from him, from his wife, and all of that. There was, you know... It was so intense\nevery day. (Pause) Uh in September of '44, there were transports going and they were\nsaying they are going to labor camps. They need labor in Poland. You know, the front was\nmoving. They need labor. And they were equipping the groups with uh shovels, with\nspades. That sounds like that labor, you know? They had also shovels, you know. And uh so\nthere were five transports of men. In the last transport, they allowed five hundred women.\nSo I volunteered to go along. Well, of course, you would volunteer. What else was to do?\nSo we packed our things; and miraculously we were in uh...not in a cattle wagon. We were\nin a regular wagon. And we were sitting on top of our luggages, crowded, everything. And\nwe arrived in Auschwitz, it must have been early afternoon. Because you know it's not so\nfar in mileage; so if we traveled all through the night and half of the morning, we would\nhave been there. When we arrived in Auschwitz, we got out of the train and we were told,\n\"Don't touch anything. Leave everything as is. Don't touch everything. Leave as it 1s.\" But\nwe still carried some things. I came from Prague to Theresienstadt in ski pants and good\nboots and a winter coat. Because, which was fortunate, I had it through all these bad\nwinters. And this is how I came to Auschwitz--with a beaver collar. And this is how I came.\nAgain I kept it, you know, for the transport. And I was still not...you know, I was still pretty\nstrong and everything--still more husky, because I'm big-boned looking. We were supposed\nto stand outside of the train, always to five. Always to five, because Germans can count\neasier that way. So uh women here and men there, as we got off the train. We are standing\nthere; and uh there's a young man in camouflage uniform, a soldier. And all around\nwere...uS were camps with wires. And out of one of the camp, runs a woman. And she yells-\n-I don't remember if it was German, Polish or Yiddish, either one of the languages--and she\nwas yelling at us, \"They will take away from you everything! What you have, throw it to\nme!\" And one of the girls had a knapsack, and she took it and she threw it to her over the\nfence. Now, you have to see this scene. I have it so much in my memory. That this young\nguy was talking to us, and I see this woman running and she's like this to catch it. And in\nthat moment, he took his gun and go \"psht\" and shoot her. That was our welcome. This\nyoung man, who friendly chatted with us in German, he just takes out his gun and goes\n\"psht.\" So that's...that was our welcome. So we are standing to five, and I was in one of the\nfirst rows. And in front of it comes the man in SS uniform, and in a white glove. And this\nwas Mengele. Of course, I didn't know at the time it was Mengele. But I knew there was\nsomething very ominous about him, because he was standing there like with his gloves and\ngoing like this. And as we came by, every person, and that's all what he did. With his finger,\nright and left. The men went first. And as my...as Bruno went by... Oh, excuse me--well, I'll\ntell you later. As Bruno went by, he was yelling at me, \"I'm not going to see you again! I'm\nnot going to see you again!\" And I didn't want him to say that. I didn't want him to say that;\nbut that what he was saying: \"I'm not going to see you again!\" And as they went by,\nMengele shoved like on this side. And when the men was gone, we was started to go. And\nwhen we came here, he shoved me on the other side. So I step up, and I said to him...uh in\nGerman I said to him, \"My...my...my husband went on this side. I want to go this, too.\" And\nhe said, \"March on the other side!\" And here were soldiers with guns around us. I just saw\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthis one shoved, so I went to the left. This was to gas, and this was to work. How did you\nknow? Fate. Total fate. You know, then we were so naive, we were so incredibly naive--of\ncourse, depended (ph)--that when we got off the train, we saw the SS men or other older\nprisoners taking the carriages and the children off the train and putting them beside. We\nsaid, \"Well, if they are not so bad. You see, they are helping.\" My foot! They were, of\ncourse, put to death. Uh, so that was our welcome. So that now by this time was getting\ndark. Now, remember this is end of October--no, end of September--in Poland. So they\nmarched us first where we had to undress. Now I had a can of oil and a can of sardines in\nmy pockets. And I had a good Swiss watch still. I...there were women from the...you know,\nprisoner's women, but who already had short hair. And we had to undress. I thought I will\nbe very smart. I go to one of them and I say, \"Look, I put in the corner my watch and the can\nof sardines and the oil. Keep it for me when I come through.\" Of course. And I thought I\nwould be smart, and I asked her, \"What is your name?\" And she said, \"Hannah Miller.\"\nThat was my maiden name. Of course, I never saw her, I never saw anything else. We were\nallowed...we were supposed to strip completely, except keep shoes. So I had my...still my\ngood shoes. Uh, we come to the next building where there was a shower. There was a\nshower shower. That means it was cold shower. We didn't have anything, but we had the\ncold shower. And we were supposed to put the shoes around the room. I go for my shoes,\nand my shoes are gone. This is the first time I to...started to cry. The shoes were the last\nthing I already had. I skipped one step. As we came and we undressed, we had to go through\na hallway, naked except in the shoes. And SS came by and looked at our breasts and looked\nat our bellies. If none of us...1f some of us might be pregnant. If they saw anybody pregnant,\nthey pulled them out. So you know, it was...so we were standing there naked; and they came\nand they looked at our breasts and our bellies. Then we went to a room where they shaved\nus. And I remember seeing sitting there one of the people I knew with long hair and at that\npoint half of her hair was shaven and half was still long. And I looked at her. And I had few\nbobbie pins, and I kept the bobbie pins. I thought when my hair grow I will have the bobbie\npins. And of course, when you all of a sudden see you bald-headed, completely shaven, you\nlook like monkeys. Everybody looks like a monkey. And not only that, with one blade,\nhundreds people. And then, with that German thoroughness, they also shaved our pubic\nhair--about a hundred people with one blade, pubic hair. Uh, no cleanliness otherwise, but\nthey shaved the pubic hair. And uh from there... So this was the bobbie pin I'm still holding,\nand we go to the shower, and my shoes are gone. We go into the next room, and uh there we\nwere given some old rags. I was given an old summer dress, some pants and something.\nNow, this is cold weather. And we...and we were given wooden shoes. The wooden shoes\nwere killers, absolute killers. In the mud of Auschwitz--uh, no socks in the cold--the\nwooden shoes were rubbing your feet. Also, they were sticking in the mud. You couldn't\npull them out. And when you had a sore on your feet, 1t would never heal. The shoes were\nkillers. Uh so we were marched into the barracks, and we saw the fire from the chimneys.\nWe...we wouldn't believe what it is. For three days...I didn't eat for three days. I was in a\nstate of shock. You didn't eat, because they were telling us this is from... How could you\nbelieve that a fire was from burning our families? I mean, it was incomprehensible. How\ncould you believe what was happening? And then you were given one big pot; and this is\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nlike the last bit of humanity was taken away. Because in the pot they gave five scoops of\nsoup, and the pot was circulated among people. And everybody slurped like an animal. You\nwere being...being made to an animal by slurping the food. So at one point, I saw somebody\ndragging a bag... bag of spoons, and one was hanging out. So I pulled it out; so I was\nalready more civilized. I had a spoon. I kept the spoon throughout. I gave it to the Museum,\nbecause anybody would say it's an old scarred spoon. But it's a special spoon. But it...1t was\npart of becoming less than a human when you have to slurp like a dog. And in the\nbeginning, we just couldn't eat. Uh...uh of course we slept five to a bunks, and we didn't\nhave any any blankets and it was cold. We were warming each other. We were five friends\nwho were staying together. But the dehumanization, when you went to the toilet. Of course,\ntoilet: there were benches with holes in them. And you didn't want to even sit down; and if\nyou didn't want to sit down, all of a sudden somebody came and pulled you down. Because\nthe women who were in charge of those holes wanted them clean. So they just pulled you\ndown very gently. Uh, periodically there was another cleanliness. I mean, this cleanliness\nbusiness! You couldn't wash. You couldn't clean. But you had to wash the floor everyday in\nthe barrack. Uh, we had to go through shower. Among us was one girl who had very heavy\nbeard, and who was shaving. We never knew she had. Of course, she couldn't shave. We\ndidn't have anything. We were just as we were born. And as we were standing there naked\nwaiting for the shower... These were these portable showers, you know--again cold, no\nsoap, no towel, nothing. We came there. These young soldiers, SS men, came and looked at\nus and said...one came to her very kindly and said, \"One of us has to shave.\" Kindly. So we\nwere taken, the laundry we had on, on that was poured disinfectant; and when we came out\nof the shower, we got somebody else's rags. If I may, so...at that time, this was the last time I\nhad... was menstruating for many months; uh because, you know, we lost menstruation.\nAnd I very carefully washed out the pants, very carefully; but, of course, I couldn't hang\nthem. I couldn't do anything with them, because they would be stolen immediately. So I\ncarefully folded them and held them under my arm. Between my arms they would dry a\nlittle bit. And then I would fold them the other way and hold them for my...under my arm\nfor about three days, hoping they would be clean and would be dry because my body\nwarmth would dry them. Finally, I was able to wear them only to lose them and get\nsomebody else's dirty pants. These were the kind of dehumanizing things, all the time. To\nbe shaved again, uh with all the people walking around. And, of course, in between we\nheard shooting; because there were what they used to call \"selection.\" The older people\nwere selected and they were running around or shooting around while we were in the\nbarracks. It was terrible. I happened to run, in our barrack, into two women who I knew\nfrom Prague before the war. One went to the same school I did. Was a... She came to the\nreligious classes from another school. [Hanka Narastrukova (ph)]--she 1s now a physician,\nlives in Switzerland. And Jera (ph), with whom I went to gym...gymnastics. Uh, she is in\nPrague now. She lived in Australia. I was in touch in with them. They were in the\nLitzmannstadt [NB: 6d_]| ghetto. They came to us, and they happened to be in the same\nbarrack. Uh it was awful there. It happens...1t so happened that uh a woman in charge of our\nhuge barrack was from Slovakia, and she learned that the...the man who is going to come\nand look for labor is a pretty good one. At that point, labor was needed; so various uh\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfactory supervisors or directors used to come to Auschwitz to select labor. And we were\ntold that this man had a pretty good set-up, so that...so they directed him to our barrack. And\nthey took two hundred women--hundred twenty Slovaks and eighty Czechs. And I...we...we\nwere the five friends together; and he took four of us. And one of the oldest he rejected, but\nshe survived. Uh she was related to Bruno, an aunt of Bruno. And so we four were\nsupposed to go. So they took us from Birkenau where we were--we were in the\nfamilienlager. We were in the Gypsy lager in the Birken...in Auschwitz; and they...in...in\nuh...in Auschwitz not but in Birkenau section. And they took us into another transit lager.\nThere, we had another experience. We were about a week there. There were the Ukrainians.\nThey had long hair. They had better dress. We had, instead of toilet, there were two uh\nbuckets. And we stood in line to use the buckets; and, of course, a lot of people had\ndiarrhea. But in when a Ukrainian came, she pushed us away and she went immediately;\nnever mind the line. The leader of that barrack was a Ukrainian. The Germans had a stack,\nthis high stack of blankets. But she wouldn't allow us to have them. By this time, it's\nOctober. The Ukrainians wouldn't allow us to have the blankets the Germans gave us. Uh,\nthere was a black triangle antisocial woman--prisoner, but 1n some sort of a uniform; and\nthere were rats. And she was shooting the rats in front of us. Fun! Uh another thing\nhappened. While we were in this barracks, one of the lower leaders--there were, you know,\nhierarchy of leaders--one of the lower leaders, was a woman, her first name is Jana (ph). I\ndon't remember her other name. And she came from the Ruthenia, the easternmost part of\nCzechoslovakia. And she lived in Nachod and had a boyfriend there; but she was taken, and\nshe was in Auschwitz for long, long time when they had to go and work and the dogs were\nbarking at their feet and all of that. And she survived. And she was telling us about it one\nevening. We were just listening to it, you know. It was pretty awful. After, the day after the\nliberation--we happened to be liberated in Nachod--I walk on the street. And, of course,\neverybody knew we were prisoners. We had no hair. And a man comes to me and says, \"I\nknow you just came back, I know it's a... But did you happen to run into Jana?\" And I told\nhim, \"Your name is so and so.\" I remembered him--the name, she gave it to us in October. I\njust remembered it in May, and I told him. It was him. And I told him and we saw in\nOctober she survived; and she did survive, and she returned, and they married. I mean, I just\nhappened to remember that. Uh, so then they took us and they gave each of us a piece of\nbread and something else, and we were loaded on trains. These were the cattle trains now.\nWe just saw a little thing, and we were supposed to go to work. They did give us some\nbetter clothes. Well, they gave us some sort of a winter coat. I had some big black winter\ncoat. Not a heavy winter coat, but some sort of a coat; and a sweater and a skirt. And\nwe...we were going on. I took a piece of the lining and out of that I made a scarf, because if\nyou have no hair it's very cold. So I made a scarf out of that lining. Uh somewhere I saw a\nbig uh bag. It was like uh being carried still in a...in a... When we were in... in uh Birkenau,\nand a sock was hanging out. And I ran and got out the sock; and I don't know, maybe just\none sock. And we had to stand in five for hours in appell [Ger: \"roll call\"], it was so cold.\nSo we always, the five of us, we'll use one of the socks; and the one who has the sock would\nstand in front, because she is getting the coldest and she is sort of uh protecting the others.\nSo I had that one sock. So later I cut it in half, and made two gloves out of it. You know,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\njust sewed it together and made two gloves out of it; 'cause otherwise we had to do only\nthis, put it an inch.... Uh we had uh... So we got on this train, and we watched the stations,\nand then we stopped; and so we knew that there were also men on the train going westward,\nyou know, from Auschwitz. It was not only women, [or] only men. Uh...oh, I know, I had a\nstriped skirt and a sweater. That's what it was. And the men were in striped outfits, and...but\nthey got hats. They didn't give us caps. And uh then we stopped for long, long time. God,\nwe were going for like 36, 48 hours. And all of a sudden, we start looking out after we are\nstanding, and to our absolute horror we realize we are going back again. Now, we knew if\nwe were going back, it's going back to Auschwitz. And we knew what it meant. But then\nthey realized they...they uncoupled some wagons; they didn't...and they moved us again, and\nwe went back again in this direction. East, we went westward. Well, we arrived in Kudowa-\nSackisch. Kudowa-Sackisch.* When we came there they told us, \"This is a spa, but not for\nyou.\" And we walked to these barracks. The barracks, wooden barracks were there. Uh we\nwere a group of two hundred women. There were already three hundred women there,\nmostly Poles and Hungarians. And uh the Lageralteste, the German Lageralteste, first was a\nSudet [NB: from Sudetenland] woman who was miserable. And she had an\nunterscharfitthrer [Ger: a corporal], which [is] a non-com official. And she had...when she\nangry with somebody, he had to beat the women. But when, after...shortly she didn't allow\npeople to peel the potatoes for our soup. They had to be thrown in as it was. But she was\nremoved, and we got an older woman who had a great advantage. She was in many ways\nmuch kinder. She allowed the potatoes to be eaten. And when an SS came for uh inspection,\nshe always slept with them and they left us in peace. So that was a great advantage.\nActually, she wasn't that bad; but she was hung after the war. I know she was hung after the\nwar. Uh, we...we were...we were twenty women, all from...we knew each other from\nTheresienstadt, together in this one room--double uh deck, you know, double deck beds.\nAnd uh that was from October '44 until May [1945], until liberation. We walked into the\nfactory. There used to be big textile factories in that area. And they were changed into\nammunition factories. Uh we particularly were making the part of airplanes in which the\npropeller sits. And next door was another factory where Russian prisoners uh were working\non the propellers. It was a uh...a tower of Babel. There were all groups in this factory. There\nwere German soldiers who went AWOL and were like prisoners under guard. They were\nthe one who moved around heavy machinery. There were French. There were Italians.\nThere were Danish. There were Dutch. Uh of course, there were the Poles. And I started\nworking on a big turning place [NB: a lathe]. I was taught by an Italian by the name\nAntonio Pezutto (ph), and he taught me how to do it. Now, normally, I don't know if you\nturning places. But when you work on a turning place, there's a very sharp knife that goes to\nthe metal and cuts, the metal cuts what it needs to be cut. But they didn't have enough\nmaterial, so they put only the edge in the metal that was wedged in, which was very inferior\nto the _. So of course, we were breaking them and they were very angry with us. Uh\nthey...first they took us to a classroom and taught us how to use a micrometer. I knew how\nto use a micrometer. But we had to do that. And they wanted to know if we know uh uh\n* Subcamp of Gross Rosen. Located in Lower Silesia.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfractions, and things like that. Uh the man who taught us was a German meister--you know,\na foreman--and uh we were in we were like in school benches. And I--you know, we were\ncurious. I looked at the school bench, and in one of the school benches I found a core of an\napple. Somebody ate an apple and left the core. I didn't care who ate the apple. I ate the\ncore. I mean, my goodness! That was fruit! Uh one day--we were there only a few days--but\none day the master said the five of us, \"Look, 1f you would like to take a bath, I will let you\ntake a shower.\" Now, that was very dangerous for him to do that. And he took five of us and\nhe took us to the shower room and let us shower. Now, mind you, we didn't have a towel.\nWe didn't have a soap. We had to put the clothes on we had. But just to be under water, and\nto be able to shower was such a relief. So we went there. It took years and years before I\nfinally allowed myself to remember why he did it. He stood in the corner and watched five\nyoung women naked taking a shower. He got his jollies; but, you know, it took me years to\nallow myself to remember why he did it, because it was very dangerous for him. Uh the\nAntonio Pezutto (ph), he sometimes brought me a piece of bread. He was one of the Italians\nwho fought in Italy with Badoglio, who turned against German. And they came in as\nprisoners, but they were better off. They could move around. They got more food, etc. And\nso once in a while, he brought me a roll or a piece of bread and he hid it somewhere and I\ncould take it. And some of the other women also got it from the meisters. Uh we\nwere...Slowly we were running out of material. Because the eastern front was coming in, the\nshipments were not coming. And at the end they finally loaded all the material, all the\nfact...all the machinery on trucks and took them to Germany. But they were bombed out on\nthe way, which we were not sorry for. But at that point, we were working. I...that was a time\nwhere for nights and we worked twelve hour shifts again, we walked in the snow and ice\nthree kilometers to the factory--which to me today three kilometers isn't much, but at that\ntime it was terrible--and three kilometers back. And some of us had to carry the uh big\nmetal containers with soup, which we had at midnight. Uh the craziness was, for instance,\nwhen they thought... They didn't know we lost menstruation; but when they thought we had\na menstruation, we didn't have to carry it. I mean logic, never logic. Uh I remember once\nmy...those shoes, those terrible shoes, were sticking in the snow and I couldn't get them out.\nAnd...and the last, and the women dragged me to the factory, absolutely dragged me. And I\nwas out of breathe for about a half hour before I could catch breathe. I was totally out of it.\nUh we walked through the village; and was night, you know--seven, or seven to seven. We\nnever saw daylight. And here there were lit windows, and at Christmas people had\nChristmas trees. And there were people living behind there, living normal lives; and we\nwere like animals, going back and forth, you know. Uh the...uh uh uh when we ran out of\nmaterial, I had to sweep. I had to run one of these big brooms. Horrible thing, to sweep for\ntwelve hours. The only thing is it gave me a possibility to move a little bit around the\nfactory, and I made contact with a Czech guy. At that time, we had some very sick people;\nand I asked him if he could get some pudding. And he did get some pudding, and he hid it\nin some material. And I went in and got the pudding and put it in my pocket, and brought it\nto this girl who was very sick. Uh I sent him a letter after the war, \"Thank you.\" And his\nfather answered that it was...he got the letter on his birthday; and he says, \"That was the best\nletter I could get, to find out how well my son behaved.\" Because, you see, these were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nCzechs. Uh Hitler gave the year 1924 to Germany; and all the Czechs who were born in\n1924 had to go and work as laborers in Germany. But they were able to go and visit, etc.\nAnd this is why I...the people with whom I made contact. Once, the Italian boys had a whole\nbig can of soup that got sour. They said, \"Do you want it?\" Of course, we ate it. We said,\n\"Well, we will think it's a potato salad. That's why it's sour.\" And we ate it. We get sick, so\nwe can't get sick. Uh uh it...it was...L..L.. This was the time when I really cried. I cried and\ncried in hours and hours, because with with the work, with everything, it was just foreign.\nAnd I was getting more and more desperate. And in uh December of that year, uh one of the\ngirls of our group--Hannah, her name was also Hannah Klein; she was exactly the year I\nwas in--became sick. And I became convinced (we didn't have a doctor) that she had\ntyphoid, because I worked so much with typhoid. There was a certain smell about it, too.\nSo she was moved into one empty room and I volunteered to be with her. And the girl\nthought...I thought really I was with so much typhoid, I'm immune. Nothing can happen to\nme. And which was not unrealistic, which was...I was pretty much immune. And the girls\ndidn't even thought I went a little crazy, you know; and I left her soup outside so the others\ncould pick it up, the two girls I met in Auschwitz. And uh she died on the 19th of December\n'44. And that was a really low point for me. That was a really low point for me. Now,\nmiraculously, this uh last Lageralteste allowed me to have a flashlight for her at night--\nwhich was unbelievable. And she did get a coffin, plain wooden coffin, for her. And so I\ndidn't have...I had washed her, and I didn't have anything. So I put newspapers. So they...I\ngot some newspaper, and I dressed her in the newspapers and stuffed it in the coffin. And it\nwasn't... And people asked, you know, \"You are crazy! Why are you doing it?\" You know.\n\"Nobody does that.\" And I said, \"That's the only piece of dignity I can give her, that I treat\nher. If I washed her when she was sick, why shouldn't I wash her now?\" This is the only\npiece of dignity I could give her. But it wasn't until years later when I realized that\nsomewhere in the back of my head--way, way back--was that the...what was the Jewish\ntradition. Visit the sick. Wash the dead. Comb them, clean them, dress them before they go.\nBut that was not conscious at all. They thought I'm crazy. Under these circumstances, I'm\nbrushing her and dressing her in newspaper. And she's buried there. In that camp, between\nOctober '44 and May '45, thirteen girls died. You might say that's not much--only thirteen.\nBut you have to remember, thirteen out of five hundred in less than...five, in six months...1n\nsix months, five...out of five hundred, thirteen people died. And we were the women\nbetween eighteen and thirty-five. So, then it's a lot. Uh one girl uh had five children. When\nshe realized that uh they were all gone, she went crazy. She went really crazy. But it took\nher that long to really accept it. Uh, miraculously that woman got coffins for these women.\nIt was unheard of. Unheard of. Once SS man came and asked us, \"What is the thing you\nwant the most?\" So we said things like a toothbrush. You know, we were used to it. You\nknow, a toothbrush was so basic. I had to repeated dreams, repeated dreams, about taking a\nbath and having a nice towel. You know? Which means, you know, necessities were for us.\nAnd so he promised us toothbrushes. Of course, we never got them. But this was kind of\nteasing, total teasing. Not being able to clean yourself. I remember in that camp, our\nwomen--some were, there was a group of people who had to wash the laundry also for the\nSS. And the SS had also lice. They said they had lice even in their handkerchiefs. I, one day,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nI saved...I didn't eat the bread at all, and I saved it and I exchanged it in some sort of a\ncontraption out of which I could make a bra. I wanted a bra so badly. For me, it was so basic\nI couldn't...so I just didn't eat the bread for a whole day so I would have a bra. You know,\nthe sort of left-overs of civilization. And I remember sitting on the bed, and looking and\nfinding my first louse. Finding my first louse was another absolute downer. This was like\nthe last drop of civilization was gone. So we had to look through for lice every day. Uh we\nall had one needle together. Needle got lost, which was a tragedy. So what did we do again?\nYou know what we did? We had uh uh... When we were all there, we had uh a game. You\nhad to make a menu card for a whole day, and then the next one had to make a menu card\nand you couldn't repeat it until everybody made all the menu cards for the week--you know,\nmaking menu cards. We were telling jokes. One of the girls read a book, uh [Margaret]\nMitchell's Gone with the Wind. I never read the book, but I remember her because she told\nus the whole contents of Gone with the Wind. We were telling, uh saying...uh reciting\npoems--anything to keep our minds going. Uh I knitted for one of the SS women a pair of\nsocks, because she was uh...gave, she gave me a printed material. We needed to read. I\nmean, for us, not being able to read was deprivation. And she gave me one of those\nHarl[equin]...uh romance-like things, you know--which was nothing, but I had something to\nread. Which was another necessity, you know. Uh she was a woman who could be...who\ncould blow hot or could blow cold. Uh when we came to the factory for the twelve hour\nshift, we got two little triangles, metal triangles, with DMV--\"Deutsche Metal Werke.\"\u201d\nAnd when we went to the john, we had to put one in. She was sitting there, so we could go\ntwice in the twelve hours. And, of course, we had diarrhea. It...1t was terrible there. And\nonce in a while, she talked to us and she told her boyfriend was at the front, etc. etc. And\nshe could...on the other hand sometimes she could beat up people. She was hot and cold.\nBut uh she did give me a piece of soap for the...for the socks. You did what you could. And\nthen we had one SS woman, Hanelle (ph), who warned...she didn't want to be SS woman.\nShe was drafted. And she warned us when the inspection came, and she escaped before the\nend of the war. Changed into a civilian. She didn't want any part of it. There were a few\ndecent people. Uh we had uh, at Christmas time, it was cold as could be (cough). The\nscrews on the inside of the barracks were white with ice. And we tried to celebrate New\nYear and do some fun and things, even under those circumstances. Uh (pause) uh you\nknow, one tried humanity even under these circumstances. And when toward the very end\nof the...of April, I didn't... didn't think I'm going to survive. I became very depressed. You\nsee how I talk now? I talked so slowly, that people didn't have patience to listen to me. I\ntrained myself to go to the bathroom every second day, to save strength. Uh...\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",

        "A: Well, I didn't think I'm going to make it. The hills started to be green. Spring might come.",
        "A: Uh, as I say, I became very depressed. I didn't think I'm going to make it. We looked out.\nThe hills were green. It looked fine. Uh...and let me back-track. At the end, they didn't have\nany material. They shipped the machines away. The front was coming. There was a pocket\nof resistance around Breslau [Pol: Wroc_aw]. We were close to it. We could hear the\nshooting; and you know, we were happy and all the...we are [thinking], \"Maybe the end is\ncoming.\" And (cough) so they made work to do. Taking the bricks from here to there, then\nbringing them back, etc. In the camp next to us, one of the camps next to us, were Russian\nprisoners of war. But they were mostly the Mongolian--mustachioed, uh uh heavy-set uh\nSoviets. They were not Russians. They were Soviets. And we each had a bowl. That was the\nonly, we each had a bowl and...and a spoon. That was all we had. And it was so cold, you\nknow, at that time. So what we did is, uh we put it under the coat and put a string around us\nso, because we didn't have gloves. And again, we marched by five. And Mimi (ph) was the\noldest of us. She was thirty-five. She was old, you know. And Mimi was also the most flat-\nchested of all of us; and here she's going with the bowl, and one of the Mongolian guys\nstepped out of his line--with great danger--and to touch her, because he thought it was a\nbreast, and because... He touched the dish. Oh, we had...it was very dangerous for him; but\nof all of us, he happened to touch Mimi's dish. So of course, you know, this was like a irony\nof the whole thing. And uh you know, uh one of the...at the end, one of the girls was able\nthrough somebody else make a contact; because through the Czechs from the year 1924, we\nwere able to make some contact. Now, because there was not enough material, they were\ngoing to build from Nachod--which was across the border in Czechoslovakia--uh a railroad\nconnected with this on...on the Polish border. They were going to make a connection. And\nhe was supposed to go and start working on it. Some of the Czech women [NB: from the\nvillage] got together, even though it was rationing, got food and bribed the SS women by\ngiving them more food for allow our group to eat. They were wonderful. They were\nwonderful. So through them, there was also contact made with other Czechs in\nCzechoslovakia, etc., so that that walking... I was not among the group, but I knew about it.\nAnd was this contact with Nachod, and they were really truly wonderful. They did it at great\nrisk; but the SS women took the bribe of the food, because they didn't have that much either\nand thought they would allow other people to eat. Can you imagine with this rationing\neverything? And these [Czech] women at the great risk did it. Uh Bo_enna Levitova was\none of the women. Her husband was Jewish. She protected him; and her three children were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nall in camps. One in Theresienstadt, and two in Dachau. And she was doing this. Just a great\nwoman. And uh, so we knew the end was coming near, but we didn't know when. So, as I\ntold you, I trained myself not to go to the bathroom. I walked very slowly. Uh, I had these\nhorrible shoes to walk in. So these two girls had each extra shoes, so I walked. When the\nwar ended, I walked to liberation with two different shoes. But they were shoes. Uh as\ncamps go, this one was by no means the worst. This one was pretty good. Even so, we were\ngetting pretty desperate what's going on to happen. Uh came May 5, end of the war. The SS\njust opened the door and disappeared. We walked to Nachod. There was a tremendous uh\ncrowd of people, all going from east to west, escaping from the Russians, going westward.\nIn cars, wagons, uh motorcycles, bicycles--you name it. And we walked in the meantime to\nthe border. We came to the border. Nobody told us what we are going to do, nothing.\nSpontaneously, totally spontaneously, we stopped and sang the Czech anthem. It was so\nspontaneous, I can't tell you. In that moment of that anthem and crossing the border, it was\njust like this: I was to normal. I spoke normal. I walked normal. Everything was normal. It\nwas a real situation depression. And we walked into Nachod; and that night I volunteered\nfor Red Cross, because there was still shooting. The Germans were coming through. The\nRussians were chasing them. There was still shooting going on, so I volunteered for Red\nCross. And somebody brought us... Of course, they all saw in us that we are prisoners, how\nwe were dressed. Uh, uh they brought us the Czech bread--about this thick--and on it was\nthat much butter and honey. And I see the picture when I took that slice of bread with the\nbutter and honey, and I bit into it. You know, the teeth were singing! I remember that first,\neating that bread with the butter on it. We walked...uh we went to this uh Bo enna\nLevitova, and she took three of us... three of us in--this woman who had the children. She\nlet us to have a bath. She put us in a bed with pillows and covers. Uh Trude, who was a\nfriend of mine--we pinched each other at night. Is this a dream, or do we really sleep in a\nbed? And she fed us for a few days. This man whom I met on the street, who knew that\nJana, he come and gave each of us some money. On the streets, there was...they took down\nthe Hakenkreuz [NB: the Swastika] and put it on the floor. For one crown, everybody was\nallowed to clean his shoes in it. And uh this woman was just really terrific. All her three\nchildren returned. I have her picture. We visited her after the war.",
