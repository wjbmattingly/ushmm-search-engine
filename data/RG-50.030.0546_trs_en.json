        "Answer: Good afternoon.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you start by telling me where you were born, when you were born\nand what your name was at birth.",
        "A: Okay. I was born in \u2014 on November 29\", 1936, in Cluj, Kolozsvar, or\nKlausenburg, depending. Klausenburg is the Yiddish word, but depending who\nwas in power, the name was different. My \u2014",
        "Q: And who was in power when you were born?",
        "A: Actually, I believe it was Hungaria.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And \u2014 no, it was Romania, because as a little girl I remember standing and\ngreeting the Hungarian soldiers coming into town, okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So it was Romania, then it became Hungary. But as I recall, I spoke most of my\nlife, as a young child, only Hungarian, I don\u2019t remember speaking Romanian.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nNovember 9, 2008",

My father was one of 10 children,\nand my mother \u2014 his name is Aleksander(ph) Katz, or Alexander Katz, depending\nwhere \u2014 you know, what paper it appears. And my mother\u2019s name is Margit Katz,\nher maiden name is Roth, r-o-t-h, and she was one of six children. I believe both of\nthem were the second children in the family. My father became a printer, and my\nmother was a hat maker, and I love beautiful hats. I remember we lived in a very\nnice apartment, it was a multiple unit apartment. And I have some memories of\nbeing in Kolozsvar. I never called it Cluj til later. And I had a vivid, active life. I\nremember being spoiled.",
        "Q: Were you \u2014 were you an only child?",
        "A: I was the only child. My \u2014 I remember once I was being punished because early\nage on I was kind of looking around and I ended up in a Christian church, a big\nCatholic church. There was music coming out of it and I went in and my poor\nmother was looking for me. And I ended up being punished, and my punishment\nwas that my father took away my shoes, and my mother had to carry me. And I was\na little \u2014 kind of bad, so I said, this is really no punishment. I loved being carried by\nmy mother, so my father got pretty angry [indecipherable]. So early age on I had a\ncertain amount of independent spirit. And we moved, I think my parents moved\nthere when they got married, so they didn\u2019t have as many friends. And I remember\nNovember 9, 2008\nmy mother kind of talking to me always about what was going on. I was her little\nconfidant, which continued. Unfortunately, she died at age 28, so it was to \u2014 fora\nvery short time.",

        "A: Both my father and mother came from very religious family, but I believe when\nthey moved up to Cluj, some of the religion was left a little behind. And my father\nenjoyed playing cards, and I remember that causing some problem.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He played chess and cards, and it wasn\u2019t something what my mother was used\nto, so as a young girl I remember arguments about that.",
        "Q: Did you keep kosher til your move?",
        "A: We always kept kosher, yes. And I don\u2019t recall my \u2014 I didn\u2019t recall that my\nmother was working, but my aunt, who survived, her aunt \u2014 my aunt is my father\u2019s\nyounger sister, her name is Ibby(ph) Steinberger(ph) now. She remembers that\nwhen I was a baby, she came over to watch me while my mother went to work. But\nfor some reason, I had no recollection of that. My mother always dressed beautiful,\nand she was a very beautiful lady. And we ended up moving because my father\nNovember 9, 2008\nheard what was happening around him, and he was worried that in a small city,\npeople know us.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And if we go up to Budapest, we would have a better opportunity to survive.\nEven though most of the people didn\u2019t believe it can happen where we lived. It may\nhappen in Poland, but it won\u2019t happen in Kolozsvar. So my father went up and\nsecured in a\u2014 a room in Budapest, and there was such a tremendous amount of\nshortage of \u2014 of apartments already. It must have been either I was four or five, I\nhave no recollection of the date. And my father talked very little about my life\nbefore the war, after I came back. And we moved up to Budapest and all of a\nsudden we had to share one apartment unit with several families. And I remember\nthat was a little difficult. And my mother\u2019s father, who had long beard and payos,\nyou know, the usual, sometimes he stayed with us. And in one room my father\nlived, my mother, I, and occasionally my grandfather. And it was ov \u2014 you know,\ncrowded, and there were some arguments about that. I have very, very precious\nmemories of my grandfather. He always had real deep pockets and always some\ngoodies for me. He spoiled me whatever way he could. And when the \u2014 the\nNyilas(ph), which is the Arrow Cross came into power, I remember that once he\ncame home all beaten up, bloody, part of his payos being pulled out. And after that\nNovember 9, 2008\nI never seen him. He came to us, and he kind of \u2014 I don\u2019t know where he went, but\nthat was the last time I seen him. My father went to work as a printer, and my\nmother continued working as a \u2014 as a hat maker. And when the war broke out, I\nhappened to visit with my maternal grandmother in Tashnalt(ph), and they were \u2014 I\nwas visiting with my grandmother and I have vivid recollection of that, that she was\npre \u2014 baking challah, and the smell in the room was overwhelming. And all of a\nsudden they knocked on the door and they said the Jews are being collected in that\ncity. And my aunt, younger aunt, her name 1s also Ibby(ph), my mother\u2019s younger\nsister was there, and my grandmother, whose name was Sarah Roth, and she says,\nEva, you are not \u2014 she didn\u2019t call me Eva, she called me Havelah(ph) --\nHavelah(ph), you are not listed on the list, you go and hide. And when it gets dark,\nyou will go to the rabbi\u2019s house, and they will send a message for your father to\ncome and get you from Budapest. Tashnalt(ph) is pretty much in the\nTransylvania section. So my grandmother left, and I was hiding in the fields. And\nthey usually kept the keys, I remember her locking up and pointing where she 1s\nputting the key. And I was ready to go inside when a group of Gypsies appeared.\nAnd I pretended that my grandmother was inside the house, because they had s \u2014\nthey were telling stories the Gypsies steal young children, and I didn't wanted to be\nstolen by Gypsies. And I pretended that my grandmother 1s in there, and I said,\nNovember 9, 2008\nGrandma, Grandma, the Gypsies, don\u2019t leave me alone. Naturally, everything 1s in\nHungarian. And the Gypsies kind of stayed there on. And I said, just leave me\nalone, my grandma will come out and she will be very angry at you. And they left.\nAnd I felt like a sense of accomplishment. I could fool the Gypsies, I\u2019d be able to\ngo to the rabbi\u2019s house.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I did. And I think a day or so later, my father came. He was note \u2014 my\nmother\u2019s \u2014 my grandmother must have \u2014 the rabbi must have called my\ngrandmother, and my grandmother se \u2014 and my mother send message to my father,\nwho was in a labor camp by then, what happened. And my father came to get me\nfrom the rabbi\u2019s house. And my father had to wear his yellow star. And he told me,\nif by any chance something happens, and I\u2019m being arrested, you go back to the\nrabbi\u2019s house, and I will come and get you. As we were walking toward the railroad\nstation, the police stopped my father and they took him in. And I think we had some\nkind of agreement where he motioned for me to go back. I\u2019m seven, this had to be\nin April of 44, so I\u2019m seven and a half that time.",
        "Q: Right.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: And I go back to the rabbi\u2019s house. My father is being kept overnight there and\nbeaten up pretty bad. And he had the chutzpah that when they let him go, he did\nsay why he came up.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He asked for a \u2014 a note from the police station that they kept him overnight,\nbecause he had only a short duration he could come and get me. So he had the note.\nAnd next day when we went to the railroad station, we got on the train, but my\nfather couldn\u2019t come inside the train. And before the train arrived, my father\napproached a woman with a young child, and ask her if she could take me, and\npretend that I belong with her. And that\u2019s what we did. My was \u2014 father was \u2014 I\ncould see him from the window, he was between the railroad cars, you know, the\nopen place where he could stay. And this lady started flirting with the German\nsoldiers who were inside the train, and I was petrified. That time I didn\u2019t speak\nanything \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014I was quiet. And when we arrived to Budapest, my father tried to hold my\nhand, and I just run off. And I don\u2019t know how I knew the way how to get home,\nbut my father couldn\u2019t catch up with me, I run all the way home. I wanted to be \u2014 I\nwanted my mother to hold me because she \u2014 she meant safety.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: A short time later where we lived, the apartment was being emptied. And we had\nthe choice to go into the ghetto. And my mother secured papers to go into \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember if we went \u2014 I think we went first to the Swiss safe house. And when that\nwas emptied, then we ended up in the Swedish safe house. And I remember once\nwhen we were in the Swedish safe house, my mother hid me on a top of, you know\nthose \u2014 in Europe you have those big cli \u2014 furnitures, you know, which opens up\nand you have \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And on top of it was a basket, and she put me inside that basket, and she told me,\nEva, you have to be very quiet, and even if you have to go to the bathroom, you just\nstay in that basket until I come and get you. Well, I was there for several hours, and\nI think my mother hid somewhere in \u2014 they had those, like in a elevator shaft\n[indecipherable] she was hid \u2014 hidden there. It was an elevator actually there. It\nwas between the windows, which you know, it was like \u2014 I don\u2019t see it here, but it \u2014\nit\u2019s like a place where windows look out, and there is really no access to it, and she\n\u2014 I thi \u2014 that\u2019s what she told me, she was hidden in one of those places. When she\ncame to get me, I remember I was wet, I was there for many, many hours. And she\ncaressed me and told me everything is okay. And we were trying to sneak out from\nNovember 9, 2008\nthe building when the Hungarian policeman seen us. And she said \u2014 the policeman\nsaid, I don\u2019t see you. Go.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: So I remember my mother telling me that there is no other place for us, we will \u2014\nI will get somewhere some false papers, false identity. And \u2014 I have to go back. The\nperson from whom we rented the room where we stayed, she rented one room to us,\nand an other room to a woman who was actually a SS woman, became a SS woman.\nAnd the lady\u2019s name whose apartment it was originally, and the place na \u2014 I\nremember the address, it was kira(ph) utsa(ph) tisanirt(ph). Kira(ph) is street\nnumber 15, and the lady\u2019s name was Mrs. Gross. My mother befriended the person\nwhose \u2014 who was the SS woman, the brother, and we hid with him for awhile.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know what was the reason, my mother felt that that wasn\u2019t a safe\nplace \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 for \u2014 I don\u2019t know what was the reason behind it. And that\u2019s when she got a\nname and I got a new name. My name was Eva Noig(ph), and noig means in\nHungarian big, so she says, now you are a big girl, and I\u2019m going to enroll you to\nschool. She enrolled me to school, we were \u2014 she was dressed up, you know, very\nNovember 9, 2008\nfashionable, and dressed me up pretty. And I was accepted in the class and she\nfound a new place.",
        "Q: And this \u2014 was this the first time you had gone to school, or is this \u2014",
        "A: I never went to school before.",
        "Q: You never went to school.",
        "A: And I remember I was skipping, I was so happy. And in Europe you have these\nround places where they have advertising posted. And I remember going by there,\nand my mother saying, we\u2019ll just go get our belongings from that person where we\nstayed for awhile. And I have no idea the duration how long we were there. And as\nwe were passing that round thing, somebody said, Mrs. Katz? So we were turned\nin. We never got to the apartment. And we were marched to the police station. And\nat one point my mother says, come on Eva, sneak off, and I was frozen, I couldn\u2019t\nmove. And for years afterwards I was feeling that maybe if I would have moved,\nmy mother would be alive today. From the police station, they knew who we were,\nwe were taken to a place called \u2014 a brick factory [indecipherable], which was like a\nholding place.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And from there we were s \u2014 they were marching us toward Germany. You have\nto realize that most people had a little warning and had some clothes with them. We\nNovember 9, 2008\nhad absolutely nothing, my mother wore fashionable shoes. And every so often they\ngave rides for children on, you know, those horse?",
        "Q: The carr \u2014",
        "A: Carriage.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, where they carried their \u2014 and every so often \u2014 and one day my\nmother ask if s-she could come, because her feet were killing her. There were a few\nchildren on that wagon. Short time later we heard shots, and I never seen my mother\nagain. At night when we arrived, they had like a makeshift Red Cross station where\npeople were united. And I remember every time the door opened, I was listening for\nmy mother\u2019s steps. Never came. And I was crying. There was bombing going on\naround, and I just couldn\u2019t believe it. How could my mother leave me? And there\nwas a woman who was working at that Red Cross station, and she says, until your\nmomma comes, I take care of you. And actually, I was with her until we got to\nRavensbruck.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: She got \u2014 she was half Jewish, or I don\u2019t even know if she was half Jewish or she\nbra \u2014 did something, but they gave her a different position, they didn't put her in the\nlager, and I was separated from her. When I arrived to Ravensbriick they took the\nNovember 9, 2008\nclothes which I had on, which was very limited. And by that time the weather\u2019s\nchanged and it was cold, and I was freezing. They shaved my hair, and I had to go\nthrough a so-called spray where they disinfected you from \u2014 oh, by the way, when\nwe \u2014 before we arrived to Ravensbriick, I was put in cattle cars. And I remember\nsome people died in the cattle car. We were shoved in, that you couldn\u2019t even move.\nThere was no food, nothing, and it was dark, you couldn\u2019t see. In Ravensbrick I\nremember going through that disinfectant area, and I came from where \u2014 you know,\nwe didn\u2019t go naked anywhere, and I was so embarrassed being naked, and I tried to\ncover myself up. I didn\u2019t have much development yet, but still, I just \u2014 the idea of\ndoing \u2014 and I remember a woman putting a stick to me, and she said in German, put\nyour hands on the side. Yelling at me. And even though I probably didn\u2019t\nunderstand, but I knew what I needed to do, so I did it. And I remember kind of\nrunning between \u2014 it was almost like a train, you know, a stationary train, and I was\nwalking between it because I was thinking, maybe I should just fall between it. And\none of the women, she was a little older, 1t was almost like she read my mind. She\nasked my name and held me. And I kind of \u2014 she atta \u2014 she kind of adopted me.\nAnd in the barracks in Ravensbritick where I was, we were in the upper, you know,\nthey had layers of \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: \u2014 cots, you know, where you know, like bunk beds.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we were on this middle one. And I remember one morning, her arms were\naround me, but she wouldn\u2019t move. And I re \u2014 I tried to tell her wake up, we have to\nget out of bed. And they se \u2014 some women must have seen what I was doing, and\nthey said, oh my God, she died. So I laid back on her, I wanted to die, too. And the\nwomen didn\u2019t let me, they pulled me off. I have no idea how long I was in that\nbarrack. But I remember once hearing a baby cry. And the woman\u2019s whisper to me,\nhe says, you have to be \u2014 keep it. We have to keep this a secret. We are going to\nhide the mother and the child. So there was actually a baby being born in the\nbarrack where I was. And I said, oh my God, will I ever re \u2014 have children of my\nown? Will it ever happen, or \u2014 and all through the time when I was totally petrified,\nI repeated the Shema Israel over and over. I kind of went in my own private little\nworld when I said the prayer.",
        "Q: Was it like a meditation almost?",
        "A: Ina way. And I remember praying, please God, give me the opportunity. Once\nwhile we were in Ravensbriick, there were a lot of people speaking other\nlanguages. I don\u2019t know how I communicated, I really have no recollection of that. I\nthink mostly in Hungarian. But I seen a soldier at the w-wires, and he was with a\nNovember 9, 2008\nbig dog, and I was petrified of those German Shepherds. And he told me in\nHungarian, come closer, and he gave me some food. And he said, if I\u2019m here\ntomorrow come again, and I give you. I went there next day, he wasn\u2019t, but the\nRussians were approaching Ravensbrick. | didn\u2019t know about it, but the people\nwere talking about it. And they \u2014 we were being collected. Some people hid. I\ndidn\u2019t. We were pushed again in cattle cars, this time directly, we weren't being\nmarched. And I was taken from mar \u2014 Ravensbrick to Bergen-Belsen, excuse me.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: [coughing] When they opened the cattle cars, the first thing I remember seeing\nin Bergen-Belsen when they marched us in, were the big mountains of bodies. And\nI remember I just couldn\u2019t take off my eyes from it. And there was another little\ngirl, a little older than I, and she pulled on my hand, and her mother and I \u2014 her\nmother and her kind of adopted me. Except the rations when we got, sometimes the\nmother didn't give me my ration, she took some of the rations and gave it to her\ndaughter. Everybody in Bergen-Belsen \u2014 sometimes, I remember going by the area\nwhere there was a kitchen, in back of the kitchen, and they had potato peels backed\nup there. And they pushed me through, because I was so small. And the first few\ntimes I brought out the potato peels, there was nothing left for me. And I remember\nsome people telling me, oh you saving me by giving me, and I think the idea of\nNovember 9, 2008\nhelping somebody really sounded good for me. I remember the third and fourth time\nthey pushed me in, I ate first, before I brought out some potato peels. Raven \u2014\nRavensbriick was bad, but Bergen-Belsen was horrible. I don\u2019t know how long I\nwas there, but all I remember that my f\u2014I was so cold my feet got frozen. And I\nwas going to go to the hospital or clinic, whatever they had there, and the women\ndidn\u2019t let me go, because they said, you go in there, you won\u2019t have a leg left. I still\nhave a little mark on my leg where it was frozen, but my leg wasn\u2019t amputated.\nWhen I was liberated in Bergen-Belsen by the British on April 15\", I remember\ngetting some food from some of the soldiers. And they looked at it \u2014 the children in\nmarvel. I think the food I ate, or whatever, I became so sick, very soon afterwards.\nAnd while I was in \u2014 actually, it was, I didn\u2019t get sick right away, it was like a f \u2014\nlittle while later, because I remember meeting that Mrs. Gross who rented u-us the\nroom. And she told me Eva, come on, I take you back. And I told her, I\u2019m not\ngoing back to Budapest, to Hungary. I\u2019m sure my mother is dead, otherwise she\nwould have come and got me during this time. And probably my father was killed,\ntoo. I said, I\u2019m going to live in the King\u2019s castle in Sweden. I heard about the\nwoman who took care of orphans in Bergen-Belsen. People were whispering about\nit, and heard \u2014 I \u2014 all I heard was that her name is Luba(ph). And I wanted someone\nto take care of me. I wanted to be together with other orphan children. And I said,\nNovember 9, 2008\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019d be able to go to Sweden. And I don\u2019t remember the process going\nthrough, how I ended up. But before I ended up going to Sweden, I was in a ho \u2014\nfor a long time in a hospital because I was so sick with typhus. And there was a\nBritish doctor who really liked me. And he says, my wife and I don\u2019t have any\nchildren, we\u2019d like to adopt you. And I told him the same thing what I told Mrs.\nGross, I want to live in the King\u2019s castle. I had it so bad. I w \u2014 I want some\nservants, and I want people to take care of me. Well, I \u2014 just before I went on the\nboat to Sweden, I met the young girl who I connected in Bergen-Belsen, and her\nmother died. She apologized to me. And she hugged me and kissed me, she says,\nI\u2019m sorry if we \u2014 any way you were hurt. And on the boat going over to Sweden, I\nremember there was another Hungarian girl who had the sister who was \u2014 he\ncouldn\u2019t speak \u2014 deaf.",
        "Q: Deaf.",
        "A: And after the first time I was interviewed, she actually got in contact with me\nbecause it \u2014 her husband worked at Yale.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And my late husband became very sick and I never really connected with her, so\nthis is something I\u2019m \u2014 still have to do one of these days. So I ended up in Sweden.\nI don\u2019t know exactly when I went. And I was in a orphanage, first time. We didn\u2019t\nNovember 9, 2008\nhave no more schooling, but I started to learn. And we were being prepared to go to\nIsrael. First time I was told \u2019'm worth something, I\u2019m special, I can do things. Look\nat, you survived, and you will be a soldier in Israel and you will help us build\nIsrael. And I remember having campfires and singing and really had a wonderful\ncomradeship, you know, with other children. I r\u2014 I remember being \u2014 going on the\n\u2014 you know, the slides, you know sa \u2014 1-1n the snow?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And just doing everything, you know, as a [indecipherable] so for me that was\nvery special, I liked it there.",

        "A: I was \u2014 I wasn\u2019t for quite some time. And then I \u2014 I remember \u2014 and I connected\nwith Luba(ph) there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I forgot to mention something, that I had the ring. And I kept that ring all\nthrough the camps under my tongue. Because that was \u2014 I felt if I survived, that\u2019s\nthe only way they\u2019d be able to recognize me, because I changed so much.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And while I was in Sweden, my \u2014 the ring became small on my finger, and I\nmoved it to my little finger. And it slipped off, and it went down the drain. And that\nNovember 9, 2008\nLuba(ph) was holding me for hours, and said, Eva \u2014 she didn\u2019t speak Hungarian, so\nby that time I spoke Polish.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: She says, Eva, the ring is not who you are. Your mother will be always in your\nheart. And that was the end of my ring, but I had that very close connection with\nLuba(ph), and I talked about her many times. And when I was \u2014 okay, I get back to\nthat. One day I\u2019m being called that my father is alive, and he wants me to go back.\nAnd I think I had the telephone conversation with my father. Somehow they\narranged it, and I remember telling my father, the only way I come home, if you\npromise you won\u2019t argue any more, and you won\u2019t play too much cards. Naturally,\nmy father promised. And I must have spoken to him in German, because we were\neducated in German. And in 1947, January, I went back to Hungary. And I didn\u2019t\nknow how to speak Hungarian, because \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that long time, but apparently a\nchild forgets easily, and learns.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And by that time I\u2019m 10 years, I just turned 10. And they enrolled me to a\nreligious school. My father remarried, I had a new mother, and a new brother. And\nwhile chronologically I was 10, I survived for a few years by the wit, and a certain\nstreet smartness. And when somebody told me no, I wanted to know the reason\nNovember 9, 2008\nbehind it, when I came back. And my father said, what happened to you, it was\nhorrible, but we are not going to talk about it. We want you to be, quote unquote, a\nnormal child. And you will call your norm \u2014 new mother as mother, because she\u2019s\ngoing to raise you, and you have a little brother. He was six months old when I\ncame home. And you will go to school. They hired a tutor who \u2014 who was teaching\nme how to speak again Hungarian. Can we stop a minute?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. [break] This is a continuation of the interview with Eva Brettler. Now\nyou \u2014 your father came back from \u2014 for you, and you went back to Budapest, and\nyou had a new mother and a new little brother. Did it surprise you that your father\nhad remarried already? Cause it \u2014 there wasn\u2019t a long time \u2014",
        "A: I was shocked. It was very short duration, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And actually there\u2019s some family disagreement about that, because some of my\naunts, my father\u2019s sister, said, how do you know she is dead\u2019? And then he said that\nhe was told that she is dead. It happened more often. I \u2014 my father was the type of\nperson who needed someone, and she \u2014 my stepmother, in many ways was good for\nhim. She was a strict woman and everything, and she lost her first husband also, in\nthe Holocaust, so there was something. And my father, when he wanted something,\nhe went after her \u2014 and, very handsome man. And he had \u2014 she had difficulty and\nNovember 9, 2008\nshe was alone, and a lot of people connected after the war. And they got married in\nMarch \u00b045, and my brother was born in \u201946, so you \u2014 you know. So it was little after\na year. I brought up something when I was interviewed in 1982, I went and asked\ncertain questions of my father, he was still alive. And my stepmother said, you\nstinker. You were so angry at me, you refused to talk to me. And I told her, Mama, I\ndidn't speak the language. All these years she was under the impression that I was\nangry at her, and that\u2019s why I didn't speak the language. I could speak with my\nfather, my father spoke fluently Yiddish, and if you spoke German, Yiddish was\nunderstandable. It was, in a way, typical. She is a very strong woman, and\nunfortunately my brother is not doing as well as he could be doing in life. And\npartially had to do with maybe my father being a little too giving in to her needs.\nAnd I felt a little bit deserted by him. And mostly I felt deserted because I couldn\u2019t\ntalk about her. And a couple of times I approached him to talk about my mother,\nand he refused to tell me anything. So, whatever I found out about my mother was\nmuch later, when I connected with my mother\u2019s sister, who survived. Her name is \u2014\nwas Blanca. And also with my aunts and uncle through my father\u2019s side. So, I\ndidn\u2019t have an easy childhood.",
        "Q: Right.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: I came home, my father at that time was running a grocery store. And before that\nhe had some black marketing ways of doing things. I think for awhile they called\nhim the salt king, because he went to Romania, brought back salt, and there was no\nsalt in Budapest.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, he had all kinds of ins and outs.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And so he, you know \u2014 and I helped out occasionally, deliver things, you know,\nfrom the grocery store, until the communist government took over things. I ended\nup going to a Jewish school, a Orthodox school. And the first day I went to school I\nwas taken to the principal office, the principal introduced me to my teacher, and the\nteacher had to go to the bathroom and he said something to me to go into the\nclassroom. I misunderstood him, and I walked into a boys\u2019 classroom, and they\nwere saying the mor \u2014 you know, the morning prayer, the Modeh Ani. And I hang\nup my coat, and I hang up my backpack and I see everybody staring at me, feel kind\nof awkward. And the teacher ask me in Hungarian \u2014 I understood Hungarian, I just\ncouldn't speak it \u2014 and the \u2014 he ask me, what are you doing here? And I said \u2014 the\nteacher told me to come in. He says, you are on the wrong floor, you have to go a\nfloor above. Well, all of a sudden everybody heard somebody speaking German. So\nNovember 9, 2008\nI was nicknamed for awhile, the Kraut, which you can imagine how delicious that\nfelt. But all of a sudden, people heard about me. There weren\u2019t too many children\nthat came back. And from early on I kind of took on certain \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say\nleadership, but I was independent, okay?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I spoke up, like I mentioned before, I questioned things. And people found\nout that I came back from the camps, and suddenly there were a lot of people\ncoming to our home. And I remember people coming with pictures, wanting to\nknow if I remember seeing some of their relatives, and so on. I\u2019m 10 years old.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] right.",
        "A: So as a 10 year old, I kind of adapted to the situation, and I remember crying and\ntelling them, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t remember. And I promised to write. I don\u2019t know\nhow I even could promise [indecipherable]. And I remember somebody said, I'll\ngive you the money to write. I said, give me the money after you get the answer, or\nsomething to that nature. Going back \u2014 and we had a grocery store, and I remember\nonce getting a basket of like, those light biscuits.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You have to remember, I lived in a place where sweets and things like that, I\nobviously had a sweet tooth, were limited. So I decided to have one, then another\nNovember 9, 2008\none. By the time I took it home, the box of biscuits were gone. And I couldn\u2019t live it\ndown. My stepmother was bringing it up all the time. So I ended up kind of getting\nmixed messages, you know. In one hand, they admired that I survived, on the other\nhand, at home I was miserable. I really was miserable. My stepmother\u2019s mother,\nwho left illegally with her son to displaced person place, she couldn\u2019t stand it there\nand she came back. And if I turned at night, she accused me of doing something. I\ndidn\u2019t know what she was accusing me, but she \u2014 so I \u2014 I really had it difficult\nbeing home. So, I must have been about 11 and a half, I befriended a girl, and I\nsaid, can I move in with your mother? And I approached the mother, and she loved\nme. And she was a widowed woman, her husband didn't come back. And I made all\nthe arrangements. I went home to pack, and my stepmother took me aside, she says,\nyou cannot bring that kind of a shame on your father. You can\u2019t do that. So that was\nkind of my childhood. I \u2014 I remember those days, punishment was that you were\nactually beaten, and my father tried to hit my brother and I stood between my father\nand my brother. So my father took off his belt, and I ended up getting a nice\nbeating. So being home wasn\u2019t exactly comfortable. Did I crave being among the\nkids I were, where I was one of many, and we kind of looked out for each other.\nThe younger ones, you know, and the older ones looked out for me. So I \u2014 I realized\nI missed that. So from early age on, I realized that I had to look out for myself. And\nNovember 9, 2008\nI think that stayed with me for the rest of my life. Maybe it started already in the\ncamps, and it continued. I made friends. I was selective, but I made good friends,\nand I kept them. I tried to be good friends, and they were good friends for me \u2014 to\nme. I \u2014 when I went to Israel, I found out that I probably cried more than I recall,\nbecause some of my old classmates were telling me they remember me crying.",

Apparently there was way of doing it, but it cost money and they\ndecided I \u2014 not to do it for me. And from a straight A student, I went down, because\nI had the one teacher who picked on me non-stop, she was not Jewish. And I used to\nbe exceptionally good in math. And she was cruel to me, so I took a book with me\nto class, and when she was teaching, I was reading. So the pi \u2014 my parents were\ncalled in that I misbehave, and so on. So from a straight A student, she ridiculed\nme; oh, in the Jewish school they give good grades easier, don\u2019t they? Next year,\nwhen I didn\u2019t have her, my grades went back up.",

I did some mischievous thing as \u2014 like\nI said, I was a spoiled little girl",

        "Q: I guess the la \u2014 when \u2014 one of the things that I\u2019m curious about is, you know,\nyou were seeing all of these dead bodies as a child. Did it \u2014 were you afraid of\nthem, or were you afraid that you would be one of them? I mean, I guess \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s\none of those things \u2014",
        "A: You know, whenever I see dead bodies, I always look for my mother. And for, I\nthink I was already married when probably I stopped. I was always hoping that\neither she had amnesia or something, and somehow she will come back again, find\nme. I think the idea of losing my mother \u2014 she was not only my mother, but she\nreally gave me the inner strength from very, very early age on. And my mother was\namazing, I didn\u2019t bring that out.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: She risk her life, and she smuggled food in for people who were incarcenated or\nsomething. So, I looked up on her. She was beautiful, she was \u2014 she was there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: While my father was, you know, all over. He \u2014 my father was a very good man,\npeople adored him, he was hu-humorous. I mean, he made the jokes all the time,\nand my fr \u2014 girlfriends were \u2014 thought my father was somebody \u2014 you know, the-\nthey used to come over and stare at him. I think I missed my mother tremendously,\nin a sense that \u2014 especially when my \u2014 she and I were in hiding in this \u2014 you know,\nNovember 9, 2008\nand my father wasn\u2019t in the picture any more. She really talked to me like an adult,\nand confined in me and tore me like \u2014 I didn't tell you about stories that, when we\nwere on the far \u2014 fictitious \u2014 you know, for \u2014 you know, we were in hiding with that\nman. And I remember walking, and she taught me how to put the cross on me. And\nat that time already I\u2019m seven and half, eight? I\u2019m eight probably \u2014 no, not eight,\nbecause eight I was already in the camp. Instead of putting the cross, I scratched\nmyself. And my mother said, don\u2019t do that. She said with one word, and next\nminute she kissed me, that I couldn\u2019t put a cross on me. So, she kind of seen the\ngood in me, which for \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I think that reassurance meant a lot to me,\nand that acceptance. I really looked up to her, she was someone very special. And\nshe could put up with my Papa, which wasn\u2019t the easiest thing those days. It\u2019s kind\nof sad because when my father became sick he totally withdrawn. He was making\njokes and everything, and when he got sick he became withdrawn, he didn\u2019t go to\nthe shul any more. He used to go every morning, you know, to daven, you know\nwhat that means. Yeah. And when he became sick he totally withdrew himself and\nhe \u2014 when my late husband died, he died in \u201987, December 24\", it was such a big\nloss for my father, losing my husband. It was \u2014 he really looked up to him, they\nreally did a lot of things together. My late husband was a wonderful chess player,\nand my father was a good chess player, they played chess. They played pinochle\nNovember 9, 2008\ntogether, you know, cards together. So \u2014 and I took, you know, my fa \u2014 I left my\nlate husband home, he played cards with my father, or played chess with my father.\nAnd if one of them won you heard about it for days, or vice-a-versa. And I took my\nstepmother shopping, you know. So, you know, there was a division between it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I did play \u2014 I didn\u2019t play chess with my late husband, but I played a mean\nplayer \u2014 mean hand of cards, and so did my kids. My kids, from early age on got\ntremendous amount of self reliance, in a sense. You have to be independent,\nbecause my brother wasn\u2019t so independent, and we wanted to kind of \u2014 we kind of\nover \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And the kids\u2019 education was \u2014 emphasis put on, to the highest degree. And my\nlate husband took such pride in it that all of us became college graduate, including\nhis wife, you know, over here. And my kids were exceptionally good students. My\n\u2014 one of my daughter attended Harvard, you know, as a undergraduate. And \u2014 to\nbecome, you know, the professions they choose, and they are still leaders in their\ncommunity, so they learned something at home.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: And I, as a young American I had an accent, much worse probably than even\ntoday, and I was active in school activities. I was the treasurer for the Boy Scouts,\nfor the Girl Scouts. I became a room mother representative. So I\u2014 I was a typical\nAmerican. I visited women who didn\u2019t have husbands and helped them out, you\nknow, to connect them. And then my late husband says, you do it anyway, go back\nto sc \u2014 get the degree, and \u2014 and do it full time. So I went back to school and I did it\nbecause I still tend to overextend myself. I have that tendency.",
        "Q: You're living life.",
        "A: I try to give back, because I feel that I survived, and I survived because of, as a\nyoung child I probably couldn\u2019t have survived if somebody wouldn't have give a\nkindness to me, but they did. And I, if I can help somebody, I like the idea of\nhelping, and through the Child Survivor organization, I made friends, which is a\ncombination of friends and relatives. I \u2014 to some extent they are maybe closer than\nyou can be to some relatives, because you can talk about the pains and everything.\nAnd nonjudgmental.",
        "Q: Do you find that a lot? Do you find that \u2014 that people judge you because you did\nsurvive, or \u2014 have you experienced that before?",
        "A: Oh yes. My poor stepmother\u2019s mother, her son Shlymie(ph) was killed, and he\nwas apparently a saint. I never knew him. And she told me. Not once, not twice.\nNovember 9, 2008\nAnd then she apologized, you know. But she personally told me, and I have been\ntold, you know. We went to conference, I will never forget, the guy wasn\u2019t aware\nthat I was in camp. He said, what do you know, you were just a child, and you were\nnot even in the camps. Or, you were Hungarian, you were a shorter length of time.\nSo, you know, they don\u2019t even know, but they look at you as a child, and you know,\nyou were a child, how would you know what suffering really was?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I mean, suffering was pretty crucial. I mean, there was a time I had clothes, in\nBergen-Belsen I remember I put something under my hat that \u2014 and I slept on it,\nthat you know, I was together with Gypsies, couldn\u2019t get away from Gypsies. So,\nthere were Gypsies in the same barrack where I was. And in the morning, it was\ngone. And I remember putting some kind of a blank \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t a blanket, but\nsomething like it, around me. And when I had to stand achtung, you know, the line-\nup, the woman throwed it off from me, the same way, you know, with that stick.\nWhen I see those sticks it scares the daylight out of me. And for a long time I was\npetrified of darks, too. So it \u2014 it was really \u2014 I mean, I listened to some older\nsurvivor describe and it \u2014 flashes come back to you. You know, things which you\nthink you forgot, and then kind of ha \u2014I go to sleep and all of a sudden I \u2014I see\nNovember 9, 2008\ncertain things which I didn\u2019t realize that they were \u2014 some were stored in the\nmemory, they laying. And it \u2014 they come forward.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And like, recently, just in \u2014 I think 1t was in June, I was involved in the Bearing\nWitness program with UCLA, did you hear about it?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I was matched up with a young man who comes from a Iranian background,\nI think he was born here already. And we had like three or four sessions together.\nWe met for lunch, and \u2014 and I remember when I told him how old I was in Bergen-\nBelsen, he went in almost like a state of shock. And I remember touching him and\nholding him. His \u2014I said, I\u2019m here. And he just couldn\u2019t \u2014 what did you do all day,\nwas his a \u2014 a question. How could you be here? So I realized it\u2019s \u2014 even for me,\nwhen I look at my grandkids, it\u2019s hard to believe that a person at that age, I don\u2019t\nknow. God forbid nobody should be tested on it. And I\u2014 when last year I came\nback from Israel, I went to visit my daughter, because my granddaughter\u2019s birthday\nis November 15\". So I came back two days later, I flew to Seattle. And I looked on\nmy granddaughter, she just turned eight. And I realized I was in the camp, I\nprobably didn\u2019t even know what day it was.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: And tears got into my eyes and I started to cry. And my daughter and I went a\nlittle later on a ride, and she says, Mom, I can\u2019t handle it. I can\u2019t handle the idea of\nknowing what pain you went through, and I can\u2019t handle you associating it with my\ndaughter. So I heard it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I\u2014 I\u2019m respecting it, and I \u2014 I make a point of not bringing it up.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But my other daughters \u2014 my story was written up re-recently in the L.A. Jewish\nJournal. It was about four or five people were in the Indestructible Spirit project, I\ndon\u2019t know if you heard about tt.",
        "Q: I haven\u2019t heard about that, but you seem like a good subject for that.",
        "A: Well, and they quote me \u2014 they took a picture of my youngest grandson and I.\nBill Aron, did you hear of Bill Aron?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He\u2019s a very well known photographer and he \u2014 he took pictures of quite a few\nsurvivors. And there was a write-up, you know, somebody interviewed me, and er \u2014\nand the story about the potato peels was written on. And with my grandson, I am\nholding my grandson. And my 10 \u2014 12 year old grandson was reading it. That\u2019s my\nGrandma. So, in a way he \u2014 yeah.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, there are stories which happened, and cruelty which happened, some\nof them I probably still cannot talk about. And maybe they are better \u2014",
        "Q: Left unsaid, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 not to be said. I have memories of sted \u2014 trying to find a solid surface to put\nmy head against it, to kill the lice which were biting. I mean, it was so painful. I\nmean, how can you da \u2014 talk about things of that nature? It happened. And then I\nremember about my feet when it was frozen, and it was painful. And people, total\nstrangers who never knew me, were holding onto me so I don\u2019t go into there and\ndon\u2019t have my feet amputated, or probably killed. So cruelty still happens today,\nand injustice still happens today, and probably the reason I started to speak now,\nand I wanted to give my oral in \u2014 interview to you, because if we can stop only one\nperson \u2014 and that particular young man I mentioned to you I met through UCLA, he\nsaid it was one of the most meaningful experience I had til now in my life, he says,\nseeing you at UCLA, he says, to me, to meet a survivor and to see where you are\ntoday. So, you hear my reason for being here.",

    "answers": [
        "Answer: Good afternoon.",
        "A: Okay. I was born in \u2014 on November 29\", 1936, in Cluj, Kolozsvar, or\nKlausenburg, depending. Klausenburg is the Yiddish word, but depending who\nwas in power, the name was different. My \u2014",
        "A: Actually, I believe it was Hungaria.",
        "A: And \u2014 no, it was Romania, because as a little girl I remember standing and\ngreeting the Hungarian soldiers coming into town, okay.",
        "A: So it was Romania, then it became Hungary. But as I recall, I spoke most of my\nlife, as a young child, only Hungarian, I don\u2019t remember speaking Romanian.",
        "A: My father \u2014 my maiden name is Eva Katz. My father was one of 10 children,\nand my mother \u2014 his name is Aleksander(ph) Katz, or Alexander Katz, depending\nwhere \u2014 you know, what paper it appears. And my mother\u2019s name is Margit Katz,\nher maiden name is Roth, r-o-t-h, and she was one of six children. I believe both of\nthem were the second children in the family. My father became a printer, and my\nmother was a hat maker, and I love beautiful hats. I remember we lived in a very\nnice apartment, it was a multiple unit apartment. And I have some memories of\nbeing in Kolozsvar. I never called it Cluj til later. And I had a vivid, active life. I\nremember being spoiled.",
        "A: I was the only child. My \u2014 I remember once I was being punished because early\nage on I was kind of looking around and I ended up in a Christian church, a big\nCatholic church. There was music coming out of it and I went in and my poor\nmother was looking for me. And I ended up being punished, and my punishment\nwas that my father took away my shoes, and my mother had to carry me. And I was\na little \u2014 kind of bad, so I said, this is really no punishment. I loved being carried by\nmy mother, so my father got pretty angry [indecipherable]. So early age on I had a\ncertain amount of independent spirit. And we moved, I think my parents moved\nthere when they got married, so they didn\u2019t have as many friends. And I remember\nNovember 9, 2008\nmy mother kind of talking to me always about what was going on. I was her little\nconfidant, which continued. Unfortunately, she died at age 28, so it was to \u2014 fora\nvery short time.",
        "A: Both my father and mother came from very religious family, but I believe when\nthey moved up to Cluj, some of the religion was left a little behind. And my father\nenjoyed playing cards, and I remember that causing some problem.",
        "A: He played chess and cards, and it wasn\u2019t something what my mother was used\nto, so as a young girl I remember arguments about that.",
        "A: We always kept kosher, yes. And I don\u2019t recall my \u2014 I didn\u2019t recall that my\nmother was working, but my aunt, who survived, her aunt \u2014 my aunt is my father\u2019s\nyounger sister, her name is Ibby(ph) Steinberger(ph) now. She remembers that\nwhen I was a baby, she came over to watch me while my mother went to work. But\nfor some reason, I had no recollection of that. My mother always dressed beautiful,\nand she was a very beautiful lady. And we ended up moving because my father\nNovember 9, 2008\nheard what was happening around him, and he was worried that in a small city,\npeople know us.",
        "A: And if we go up to Budapest, we would have a better opportunity to survive.\nEven though most of the people didn\u2019t believe it can happen where we lived. It may\nhappen in Poland, but it won\u2019t happen in Kolozsvar. So my father went up and\nsecured in a\u2014 a room in Budapest, and there was such a tremendous amount of\nshortage of \u2014 of apartments already. It must have been either I was four or five, I\nhave no recollection of the date. And my father talked very little about my life\nbefore the war, after I came back. And we moved up to Budapest and all of a\nsudden we had to share one apartment unit with several families. And I remember\nthat was a little difficult. And my mother\u2019s father, who had long beard and payos,\nyou know, the usual, sometimes he stayed with us. And in one room my father\nlived, my mother, I, and occasionally my grandfather. And it was ov \u2014 you know,\ncrowded, and there were some arguments about that. I have very, very precious\nmemories of my grandfather. He always had real deep pockets and always some\ngoodies for me. He spoiled me whatever way he could. And when the \u2014 the\nNyilas(ph), which is the Arrow Cross came into power, I remember that once he\ncame home all beaten up, bloody, part of his payos being pulled out. And after that\nNovember 9, 2008\nI never seen him. He came to us, and he kind of \u2014 I don\u2019t know where he went, but\nthat was the last time I seen him. My father went to work as a printer, and my\nmother continued working as a \u2014 as a hat maker. And when the war broke out, I\nhappened to visit with my maternal grandmother in Tashnalt(ph), and they were \u2014 I\nwas visiting with my grandmother and I have vivid recollection of that, that she was\npre \u2014 baking challah, and the smell in the room was overwhelming. And all of a\nsudden they knocked on the door and they said the Jews are being collected in that\ncity. And my aunt, younger aunt, her name 1s also Ibby(ph), my mother\u2019s younger\nsister was there, and my grandmother, whose name was Sarah Roth, and she says,\nEva, you are not \u2014 she didn\u2019t call me Eva, she called me Havelah(ph) --\nHavelah(ph), you are not listed on the list, you go and hide. And when it gets dark,\nyou will go to the rabbi\u2019s house, and they will send a message for your father to\ncome and get you from Budapest. Tashnalt(ph) is pretty much in the\nTransylvania section. So my grandmother left, and I was hiding in the fields. And\nthey usually kept the keys, I remember her locking up and pointing where she 1s\nputting the key. And I was ready to go inside when a group of Gypsies appeared.\nAnd I pretended that my grandmother was inside the house, because they had s \u2014\nthey were telling stories the Gypsies steal young children, and I didn't wanted to be\nstolen by Gypsies. And I pretended that my grandmother 1s in there, and I said,\nNovember 9, 2008\nGrandma, Grandma, the Gypsies, don\u2019t leave me alone. Naturally, everything 1s in\nHungarian. And the Gypsies kind of stayed there on. And I said, just leave me\nalone, my grandma will come out and she will be very angry at you. And they left.\nAnd I felt like a sense of accomplishment. I could fool the Gypsies, I\u2019d be able to\ngo to the rabbi\u2019s house.",
        "A: And I did. And I think a day or so later, my father came. He was note \u2014 my\nmother\u2019s \u2014 my grandmother must have \u2014 the rabbi must have called my\ngrandmother, and my grandmother se \u2014 and my mother send message to my father,\nwho was in a labor camp by then, what happened. And my father came to get me\nfrom the rabbi\u2019s house. And my father had to wear his yellow star. And he told me,\nif by any chance something happens, and I\u2019m being arrested, you go back to the\nrabbi\u2019s house, and I will come and get you. As we were walking toward the railroad\nstation, the police stopped my father and they took him in. And I think we had some\nkind of agreement where he motioned for me to go back. I\u2019m seven, this had to be\nin April of 44, so I\u2019m seven and a half that time.",
        "A: And I go back to the rabbi\u2019s house. My father is being kept overnight there and\nbeaten up pretty bad. And he had the chutzpah that when they let him go, he did\nsay why he came up.",
        "A: He asked for a \u2014 a note from the police station that they kept him overnight,\nbecause he had only a short duration he could come and get me. So he had the note.\nAnd next day when we went to the railroad station, we got on the train, but my\nfather couldn\u2019t come inside the train. And before the train arrived, my father\napproached a woman with a young child, and ask her if she could take me, and\npretend that I belong with her. And that\u2019s what we did. My was \u2014 father was \u2014 I\ncould see him from the window, he was between the railroad cars, you know, the\nopen place where he could stay. And this lady started flirting with the German\nsoldiers who were inside the train, and I was petrified. That time I didn\u2019t speak\nanything \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I was quiet. And when we arrived to Budapest, my father tried to hold my\nhand, and I just run off. And I don\u2019t know how I knew the way how to get home,\nbut my father couldn\u2019t catch up with me, I run all the way home. I wanted to be \u2014 I\nwanted my mother to hold me because she \u2014 she meant safety.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: A short time later where we lived, the apartment was being emptied. And we had\nthe choice to go into the ghetto. And my mother secured papers to go into \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember if we went \u2014 I think we went first to the Swiss safe house. And when that\nwas emptied, then we ended up in the Swedish safe house. And I remember once\nwhen we were in the Swedish safe house, my mother hid me on a top of, you know\nthose \u2014 in Europe you have those big cli \u2014 furnitures, you know, which opens up\nand you have \u2014",
        "A: And on top of it was a basket, and she put me inside that basket, and she told me,\nEva, you have to be very quiet, and even if you have to go to the bathroom, you just\nstay in that basket until I come and get you. Well, I was there for several hours, and\nI think my mother hid somewhere in \u2014 they had those, like in a elevator shaft\n[indecipherable] she was hid \u2014 hidden there. It was an elevator actually there. It\nwas between the windows, which you know, it was like \u2014 I don\u2019t see it here, but it \u2014\nit\u2019s like a place where windows look out, and there is really no access to it, and she\n\u2014 I thi \u2014 that\u2019s what she told me, she was hidden in one of those places. When she\ncame to get me, I remember I was wet, I was there for many, many hours. And she\ncaressed me and told me everything is okay. And we were trying to sneak out from\nNovember 9, 2008\nthe building when the Hungarian policeman seen us. And she said \u2014 the policeman\nsaid, I don\u2019t see you. Go.",
        "A: So I remember my mother telling me that there is no other place for us, we will \u2014\nI will get somewhere some false papers, false identity. And \u2014 I have to go back. The\nperson from whom we rented the room where we stayed, she rented one room to us,\nand an other room to a woman who was actually a SS woman, became a SS woman.\nAnd the lady\u2019s name whose apartment it was originally, and the place na \u2014 I\nremember the address, it was kira(ph) utsa(ph) tisanirt(ph). Kira(ph) is street\nnumber 15, and the lady\u2019s name was Mrs. Gross. My mother befriended the person\nwhose \u2014 who was the SS woman, the brother, and we hid with him for awhile.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know what was the reason, my mother felt that that wasn\u2019t a safe\nplace \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for \u2014 I don\u2019t know what was the reason behind it. And that\u2019s when she got a\nname and I got a new name. My name was Eva Noig(ph), and noig means in\nHungarian big, so she says, now you are a big girl, and I\u2019m going to enroll you to\nschool. She enrolled me to school, we were \u2014 she was dressed up, you know, very\nNovember 9, 2008\nfashionable, and dressed me up pretty. And I was accepted in the class and she\nfound a new place.",
        "A: I never went to school before.",
        "A: And I remember I was skipping, I was so happy. And in Europe you have these\nround places where they have advertising posted. And I remember going by there,\nand my mother saying, we\u2019ll just go get our belongings from that person where we\nstayed for awhile. And I have no idea the duration how long we were there. And as\nwe were passing that round thing, somebody said, Mrs. Katz? So we were turned\nin. We never got to the apartment. And we were marched to the police station. And\nat one point my mother says, come on Eva, sneak off, and I was frozen, I couldn\u2019t\nmove. And for years afterwards I was feeling that maybe if I would have moved,\nmy mother would be alive today. From the police station, they knew who we were,\nwe were taken to a place called \u2014 a brick factory [indecipherable], which was like a\nholding place.",
        "A: And from there we were s \u2014 they were marching us toward Germany. You have\nto realize that most people had a little warning and had some clothes with them. We\nNovember 9, 2008\nhad absolutely nothing, my mother wore fashionable shoes. And every so often they\ngave rides for children on, you know, those horse?",
        "A: Carriage.",
        "A: You know, where they carried their \u2014 and every so often \u2014 and one day my\nmother ask if s-she could come, because her feet were killing her. There were a few\nchildren on that wagon. Short time later we heard shots, and I never seen my mother\nagain. At night when we arrived, they had like a makeshift Red Cross station where\npeople were united. And I remember every time the door opened, I was listening for\nmy mother\u2019s steps. Never came. And I was crying. There was bombing going on\naround, and I just couldn\u2019t believe it. How could my mother leave me? And there\nwas a woman who was working at that Red Cross station, and she says, until your\nmomma comes, I take care of you. And actually, I was with her until we got to\nRavensbruck.",
        "A: She got \u2014 she was half Jewish, or I don\u2019t even know if she was half Jewish or she\nbra \u2014 did something, but they gave her a different position, they didn't put her in the\nlager, and I was separated from her. When I arrived to Ravensbriick they took the\nNovember 9, 2008\nclothes which I had on, which was very limited. And by that time the weather\u2019s\nchanged and it was cold, and I was freezing. They shaved my hair, and I had to go\nthrough a so-called spray where they disinfected you from \u2014 oh, by the way, when\nwe \u2014 before we arrived to Ravensbriick, I was put in cattle cars. And I remember\nsome people died in the cattle car. We were shoved in, that you couldn\u2019t even move.\nThere was no food, nothing, and it was dark, you couldn\u2019t see. In Ravensbrick I\nremember going through that disinfectant area, and I came from where \u2014 you know,\nwe didn\u2019t go naked anywhere, and I was so embarrassed being naked, and I tried to\ncover myself up. I didn\u2019t have much development yet, but still, I just \u2014 the idea of\ndoing \u2014 and I remember a woman putting a stick to me, and she said in German, put\nyour hands on the side. Yelling at me. And even though I probably didn\u2019t\nunderstand, but I knew what I needed to do, so I did it. And I remember kind of\nrunning between \u2014 it was almost like a train, you know, a stationary train, and I was\nwalking between it because I was thinking, maybe I should just fall between it. And\none of the women, she was a little older, 1t was almost like she read my mind. She\nasked my name and held me. And I kind of \u2014 she atta \u2014 she kind of adopted me.\nAnd in the barracks in Ravensbritick where I was, we were in the upper, you know,\nthey had layers of \u2014\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: \u2014 cots, you know, where you know, like bunk beds.",
        "A: And we were on this middle one. And I remember one morning, her arms were\naround me, but she wouldn\u2019t move. And I re \u2014 I tried to tell her wake up, we have to\nget out of bed. And they se \u2014 some women must have seen what I was doing, and\nthey said, oh my God, she died. So I laid back on her, I wanted to die, too. And the\nwomen didn\u2019t let me, they pulled me off. I have no idea how long I was in that\nbarrack. But I remember once hearing a baby cry. And the woman\u2019s whisper to me,\nhe says, you have to be \u2014 keep it. We have to keep this a secret. We are going to\nhide the mother and the child. So there was actually a baby being born in the\nbarrack where I was. And I said, oh my God, will I ever re \u2014 have children of my\nown? Will it ever happen, or \u2014 and all through the time when I was totally petrified,\nI repeated the Shema Israel over and over. I kind of went in my own private little\nworld when I said the prayer.",
        "A: Ina way. And I remember praying, please God, give me the opportunity. Once\nwhile we were in Ravensbriick, there were a lot of people speaking other\nlanguages. I don\u2019t know how I communicated, I really have no recollection of that. I\nthink mostly in Hungarian. But I seen a soldier at the w-wires, and he was with a\nNovember 9, 2008\nbig dog, and I was petrified of those German Shepherds. And he told me in\nHungarian, come closer, and he gave me some food. And he said, if I\u2019m here\ntomorrow come again, and I give you. I went there next day, he wasn\u2019t, but the\nRussians were approaching Ravensbrick. | didn\u2019t know about it, but the people\nwere talking about it. And they \u2014 we were being collected. Some people hid. I\ndidn\u2019t. We were pushed again in cattle cars, this time directly, we weren't being\nmarched. And I was taken from mar \u2014 Ravensbrick to Bergen-Belsen, excuse me.",
        "A: [coughing] When they opened the cattle cars, the first thing I remember seeing\nin Bergen-Belsen when they marched us in, were the big mountains of bodies. And\nI remember I just couldn\u2019t take off my eyes from it. And there was another little\ngirl, a little older than I, and she pulled on my hand, and her mother and I \u2014 her\nmother and her kind of adopted me. Except the rations when we got, sometimes the\nmother didn't give me my ration, she took some of the rations and gave it to her\ndaughter. Everybody in Bergen-Belsen \u2014 sometimes, I remember going by the area\nwhere there was a kitchen, in back of the kitchen, and they had potato peels backed\nup there. And they pushed me through, because I was so small. And the first few\ntimes I brought out the potato peels, there was nothing left for me. And I remember\nsome people telling me, oh you saving me by giving me, and I think the idea of\nNovember 9, 2008\nhelping somebody really sounded good for me. I remember the third and fourth time\nthey pushed me in, I ate first, before I brought out some potato peels. Raven \u2014\nRavensbriick was bad, but Bergen-Belsen was horrible. I don\u2019t know how long I\nwas there, but all I remember that my f\u2014I was so cold my feet got frozen. And I\nwas going to go to the hospital or clinic, whatever they had there, and the women\ndidn\u2019t let me go, because they said, you go in there, you won\u2019t have a leg left. I still\nhave a little mark on my leg where it was frozen, but my leg wasn\u2019t amputated.\nWhen I was liberated in Bergen-Belsen by the British on April 15\", I remember\ngetting some food from some of the soldiers. And they looked at it \u2014 the children in\nmarvel. I think the food I ate, or whatever, I became so sick, very soon afterwards.\nAnd while I was in \u2014 actually, it was, I didn\u2019t get sick right away, it was like a f \u2014\nlittle while later, because I remember meeting that Mrs. Gross who rented u-us the\nroom. And she told me Eva, come on, I take you back. And I told her, I\u2019m not\ngoing back to Budapest, to Hungary. I\u2019m sure my mother is dead, otherwise she\nwould have come and got me during this time. And probably my father was killed,\ntoo. I said, I\u2019m going to live in the King\u2019s castle in Sweden. I heard about the\nwoman who took care of orphans in Bergen-Belsen. People were whispering about\nit, and heard \u2014 I \u2014 all I heard was that her name is Luba(ph). And I wanted someone\nto take care of me. I wanted to be together with other orphan children. And I said,\nNovember 9, 2008\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019d be able to go to Sweden. And I don\u2019t remember the process going\nthrough, how I ended up. But before I ended up going to Sweden, I was in a ho \u2014\nfor a long time in a hospital because I was so sick with typhus. And there was a\nBritish doctor who really liked me. And he says, my wife and I don\u2019t have any\nchildren, we\u2019d like to adopt you. And I told him the same thing what I told Mrs.\nGross, I want to live in the King\u2019s castle. I had it so bad. I w \u2014 I want some\nservants, and I want people to take care of me. Well, I \u2014 just before I went on the\nboat to Sweden, I met the young girl who I connected in Bergen-Belsen, and her\nmother died. She apologized to me. And she hugged me and kissed me, she says,\nI\u2019m sorry if we \u2014 any way you were hurt. And on the boat going over to Sweden, I\nremember there was another Hungarian girl who had the sister who was \u2014 he\ncouldn\u2019t speak \u2014 deaf.",
        "A: And after the first time I was interviewed, she actually got in contact with me\nbecause it \u2014 her husband worked at Yale.",
        "A: And my late husband became very sick and I never really connected with her, so\nthis is something I\u2019m \u2014 still have to do one of these days. So I ended up in Sweden.\nI don\u2019t know exactly when I went. And I was in a orphanage, first time. We didn\u2019t\nNovember 9, 2008\nhave no more schooling, but I started to learn. And we were being prepared to go to\nIsrael. First time I was told \u2019'm worth something, I\u2019m special, I can do things. Look\nat, you survived, and you will be a soldier in Israel and you will help us build\nIsrael. And I remember having campfires and singing and really had a wonderful\ncomradeship, you know, with other children. I r\u2014 I remember being \u2014 going on the\n\u2014 you know, the slides, you know sa \u2014 1-1n the snow?",
        "A: And just doing everything, you know, as a [indecipherable] so for me that was\nvery special, I liked it there.",
        "A: I was \u2014 I wasn\u2019t for quite some time. And then I \u2014 I remember \u2014 and I connected\nwith Luba(ph) there.",
        "A: I forgot to mention something, that I had the ring. And I kept that ring all\nthrough the camps under my tongue. Because that was \u2014 I felt if I survived, that\u2019s\nthe only way they\u2019d be able to recognize me, because I changed so much.",
        "A: And while I was in Sweden, my \u2014 the ring became small on my finger, and I\nmoved it to my little finger. And it slipped off, and it went down the drain. And that\nNovember 9, 2008\nLuba(ph) was holding me for hours, and said, Eva \u2014 she didn\u2019t speak Hungarian, so\nby that time I spoke Polish.",
        "A: She says, Eva, the ring is not who you are. Your mother will be always in your\nheart. And that was the end of my ring, but I had that very close connection with\nLuba(ph), and I talked about her many times. And when I was \u2014 okay, I get back to\nthat. One day I\u2019m being called that my father is alive, and he wants me to go back.\nAnd I think I had the telephone conversation with my father. Somehow they\narranged it, and I remember telling my father, the only way I come home, if you\npromise you won\u2019t argue any more, and you won\u2019t play too much cards. Naturally,\nmy father promised. And I must have spoken to him in German, because we were\neducated in German. And in 1947, January, I went back to Hungary. And I didn\u2019t\nknow how to speak Hungarian, because \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that long time, but apparently a\nchild forgets easily, and learns.",
        "A: And by that time I\u2019m 10 years, I just turned 10. And they enrolled me to a\nreligious school. My father remarried, I had a new mother, and a new brother. And\nwhile chronologically I was 10, I survived for a few years by the wit, and a certain\nstreet smartness. And when somebody told me no, I wanted to know the reason\nNovember 9, 2008\nbehind it, when I came back. And my father said, what happened to you, it was\nhorrible, but we are not going to talk about it. We want you to be, quote unquote, a\nnormal child. And you will call your norm \u2014 new mother as mother, because she\u2019s\ngoing to raise you, and you have a little brother. He was six months old when I\ncame home. And you will go to school. They hired a tutor who \u2014 who was teaching\nme how to speak again Hungarian. Can we stop a minute?",
        "A: I was shocked. It was very short duration, yeah.",
        "A: And actually there\u2019s some family disagreement about that, because some of my\naunts, my father\u2019s sister, said, how do you know she is dead\u2019? And then he said that\nhe was told that she is dead. It happened more often. I \u2014 my father was the type of\nperson who needed someone, and she \u2014 my stepmother, in many ways was good for\nhim. She was a strict woman and everything, and she lost her first husband also, in\nthe Holocaust, so there was something. And my father, when he wanted something,\nhe went after her \u2014 and, very handsome man. And he had \u2014 she had difficulty and\nNovember 9, 2008\nshe was alone, and a lot of people connected after the war. And they got married in\nMarch \u00b045, and my brother was born in \u201946, so you \u2014 you know. So it was little after\na year. I brought up something when I was interviewed in 1982, I went and asked\ncertain questions of my father, he was still alive. And my stepmother said, you\nstinker. You were so angry at me, you refused to talk to me. And I told her, Mama, I\ndidn't speak the language. All these years she was under the impression that I was\nangry at her, and that\u2019s why I didn't speak the language. I could speak with my\nfather, my father spoke fluently Yiddish, and if you spoke German, Yiddish was\nunderstandable. It was, in a way, typical. She is a very strong woman, and\nunfortunately my brother is not doing as well as he could be doing in life. And\npartially had to do with maybe my father being a little too giving in to her needs.\nAnd I felt a little bit deserted by him. And mostly I felt deserted because I couldn\u2019t\ntalk about her. And a couple of times I approached him to talk about my mother,\nand he refused to tell me anything. So, whatever I found out about my mother was\nmuch later, when I connected with my mother\u2019s sister, who survived. Her name is \u2014\nwas Blanca. And also with my aunts and uncle through my father\u2019s side. So, I\ndidn\u2019t have an easy childhood.",
        "A: I came home, my father at that time was running a grocery store. And before that\nhe had some black marketing ways of doing things. I think for awhile they called\nhim the salt king, because he went to Romania, brought back salt, and there was no\nsalt in Budapest.",
        "A: So, he had all kinds of ins and outs.",
        "A: And so he, you know \u2014 and I helped out occasionally, deliver things, you know,\nfrom the grocery store, until the communist government took over things. I ended\nup going to a Jewish school, a Orthodox school. And the first day I went to school I\nwas taken to the principal office, the principal introduced me to my teacher, and the\nteacher had to go to the bathroom and he said something to me to go into the\nclassroom. I misunderstood him, and I walked into a boys\u2019 classroom, and they\nwere saying the mor \u2014 you know, the morning prayer, the Modeh Ani. And I hang\nup my coat, and I hang up my backpack and I see everybody staring at me, feel kind\nof awkward. And the teacher ask me in Hungarian \u2014 I understood Hungarian, I just\ncouldn't speak it \u2014 and the \u2014 he ask me, what are you doing here? And I said \u2014 the\nteacher told me to come in. He says, you are on the wrong floor, you have to go a\nfloor above. Well, all of a sudden everybody heard somebody speaking German. So\nNovember 9, 2008\nI was nicknamed for awhile, the Kraut, which you can imagine how delicious that\nfelt. But all of a sudden, people heard about me. There weren\u2019t too many children\nthat came back. And from early on I kind of took on certain \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say\nleadership, but I was independent, okay?",
        "A: And I spoke up, like I mentioned before, I questioned things. And people found\nout that I came back from the camps, and suddenly there were a lot of people\ncoming to our home. And I remember people coming with pictures, wanting to\nknow if I remember seeing some of their relatives, and so on. I\u2019m 10 years old.",
        "A: So as a 10 year old, I kind of adapted to the situation, and I remember crying and\ntelling them, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t remember. And I promised to write. I don\u2019t know\nhow I even could promise [indecipherable]. And I remember somebody said, I'll\ngive you the money to write. I said, give me the money after you get the answer, or\nsomething to that nature. Going back \u2014 and we had a grocery store, and I remember\nonce getting a basket of like, those light biscuits.",
        "A: You have to remember, I lived in a place where sweets and things like that, I\nobviously had a sweet tooth, were limited. So I decided to have one, then another\nNovember 9, 2008\none. By the time I took it home, the box of biscuits were gone. And I couldn\u2019t live it\ndown. My stepmother was bringing it up all the time. So I ended up kind of getting\nmixed messages, you know. In one hand, they admired that I survived, on the other\nhand, at home I was miserable. I really was miserable. My stepmother\u2019s mother,\nwho left illegally with her son to displaced person place, she couldn\u2019t stand it there\nand she came back. And if I turned at night, she accused me of doing something. I\ndidn\u2019t know what she was accusing me, but she \u2014 so I \u2014 I really had it difficult\nbeing home. So, I must have been about 11 and a half, I befriended a girl, and I\nsaid, can I move in with your mother? And I approached the mother, and she loved\nme. And she was a widowed woman, her husband didn't come back. And I made all\nthe arrangements. I went home to pack, and my stepmother took me aside, she says,\nyou cannot bring that kind of a shame on your father. You can\u2019t do that. So that was\nkind of my childhood. I \u2014 I remember those days, punishment was that you were\nactually beaten, and my father tried to hit my brother and I stood between my father\nand my brother. So my father took off his belt, and I ended up getting a nice\nbeating. So being home wasn\u2019t exactly comfortable. Did I crave being among the\nkids I were, where I was one of many, and we kind of looked out for each other.\nThe younger ones, you know, and the older ones looked out for me. So I \u2014 I realized\nI missed that. So from early age on, I realized that I had to look out for myself. And\nNovember 9, 2008\nI think that stayed with me for the rest of my life. Maybe it started already in the\ncamps, and it continued. I made friends. I was selective, but I made good friends,\nand I kept them. I tried to be good friends, and they were good friends for me \u2014 to\nme. I \u2014 when I went to Israel, I found out that I probably cried more than I recall,\nbecause some of my old classmates were telling me they remember me crying.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t last long.",
        "A: No. They got the \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: They knew that I came back from Sweden. How much they knew where I was, I\nreally don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I stayed in the Orthodox school until the state took over. So that was in the sixth\ngrade.",
        "A: So seventh and eighth grade, I had to go to the local school where \u2014 the district I\nbelonged to. Apparently there was way of doing it, but it cost money and they\ndecided I \u2014 not to do it for me. And from a straight A student, I went down, because\nI had the one teacher who picked on me non-stop, she was not Jewish. And I used to\nbe exceptionally good in math. And she was cruel to me, so I took a book with me\nto class, and when she was teaching, I was reading. So the pi \u2014 my parents were\ncalled in that I misbehave, and so on. So from a straight A student, she ridiculed\nme; oh, in the Jewish school they give good grades easier, don\u2019t they? Next year,\nwhen I didn\u2019t have her, my grades went back up.",
        "A: I liked school. I liked to learn.",
        "A: When I graduated at age 14, eighth grade was mandatory. My mother called\ntogether so called advisory committee, and they decided my grades, I\u2019m not such a\ngood student, I should go learn a trade.",
        "A: And they found a place which didn\u2019t work on Sabbath, because I wasn\u2019t working\non Sabbath.",
        "A: I started to work there, and I realized that something was happening to me which\nI really don\u2019t like. And I worked 1n a textile factory, and I learned how to desi \u2014 you\nknow, you had to design textile.",
        "A: And in the olden days they had \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t have the English\nequalant of the word, but each thread you had to pull through a needle.",
        "A: Yeah, and you made the design.",
        "A: And that loom was put in a machine, and that\u2019s how they made that.",
        "A: Well, I was young, I did very fast, and I became a sztahanovista. Sztahanovista\nis a person who da \u2014 produces a lot.",
        "A: Well, the fellow workers were very upset with me, you shouldn\u2019t work so fast,\nbecause the new norm will be much higher. So, I worked very hard, and I still got\nNovember 9, 2008\ntogether occasionally with \u2014 I got together with the friends I made in the Jewish\nschool. And I belonged to a group where we kind of had after school activities. And\nI realized I have to do something. So I am about \u2014 closer to 15 by now. I didn\u2019t go\nto school for a year. I found out there is a school where they \u2014 you can become a\nchemist. I will try that.",
        "A: I like math. In order to go, you had to go through a preparation class, and I did\nthat. And I did exceptionally well, I had good math skills and so on. And they\naccepted me to school. But the problem was that the factory had to request for me to\ngo to school. And I wasn\u2019t in a communist party or anything, so I didn\u2019t qualify.\nAnd the school requested me from the factory, because this factory send a few\npeople to do, and they didn\u2019t qualify, but I did. So I worked \u2014 oh, I forgot to tell you\nthen, the hours changed, and I had to become a [indecipherable] Shabbas, that\nmeant that I had to work on the Sabbath, too. And that hurt me more than anything\nelse. And when I started school, it was at nighttime, so they couldn\u2019t put me \u2014 I\nused to work either from six to two, or from two to 10.",
        "A: And I was petrified because the factory was next to a cemetery, and at night to\nget to the bus stop I had to go by the cemetery, and I\u2019m only 14 years old.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: So I was \u2014 I\u2019m surprised they allowed children that young to work that hours.\nBut a lot of thing changed, because they took me out from the assembly line and I\nstarted to work in the lab.",
        "A: Yeah. So, you actually hear more about my after \u2014",
        "A: So-",
        "A: Yeah, so I actually was working, and then the factory in the \u2014 where I worked,\nthey send me out to work at university on research. I was going to a technical\nschool at night. And I really \u2014 I befriended the person, you know, I had to give her\nmy wages, and I befriended the person who gave me a phony paycheck. And I had\nsome money to spend, because I was supposed to give all money \u2014 so I learned\nearly on that there are certain back ways, yeah. And my relationship with my\nmother wasn\u2019t too \u2014\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: \u2014 too good. And not because \u2014 I did try. I really tried, but if I hugged her, you\nsqueezing me hard. So you know, it was \u2014 and \u2014 and my father wasn\u2019t really there \u2014\nthat much there for me so the irony is that now my step \u2014 my father died, and I\u2019m in\ncharge of my grandma \u2014 my stepmother and I do take care of her.",
        "A: My brother is \u2014 he hasn\u2019t worked for a number of years. My mother helps to\nsupport him and his family. He married, he has two young children. So, I really\ndidn\u2019t wanted to talk about that.",
        "A: I appreciate if you don\u2019t talk about that.",
        "A: So, when the revolution broke out.",
        "A: I was on my way to school when I heard there will be a big demonstration front\nof the parliament. So I went with another girl who was about to get married. And I\nsaid, it\u2019s a lot of \u2014 we \u2014 we should be there. So I was actually at the point where the\nrevolution started, when all the speeches were going on and everything. When I got\nhome that particular day, I remember I came home late, and my aunt and uncle were\nvisiting from Szatmar. And everybody was waiting for me because in Europe the\nNovember 9, 2008\ngates to the apartment building closed at 11 o\u2019clock, and I was home much later,\nbecause there was no transportation, you had to walk home. And I told them that I\nprobably will be leaving. By now I\u2019m 20, 20 years old.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t quite 20 yet, but close to 20. And the revolution was October 23\", and I\nwould be \u2014 a\u2014a few months later \u2014 a m \u2014 a month later, almost. And I went with\nanother friend to the train station, packed up. The only thing I packed up to take\nwith me was my Red Cross certificate in case I get caught, I would say that I came\nto help people who need help. And I brought my prayer book with me. And no\npictures, nothing. Those were \u2014 and my photo 1.d., which I still have. And the girl I\nstarted out with, she had more money, she could go with the transport. I met one of\nmy stepmother\u2019s cousin, who was helping other people cross, and he ended up\ntaking maybe the bus, and several other family \u2014 families, we went to a little city\ncalled Burschavkine(ph) and I crossed the border there to Austria.",
        "A: And it was during the night, and it was a bigger transport of people. And I stayed\nbehind with the family who had the young child.",
        "A: I-\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: We are cra \u2014 we actually crossed the border and we didn\u2019t realize we were\ncrossed already. So for awhile we were actually at night fumbling around in\nAustria when, you know, they were going around finding refugees. So, I was first\non the outskirts of Vienna, and this family who I crossed with, their names were\nFisher, and they were related to my stepmother\u2019s first husband.",
        "A: It\u2019s a small world.",
        "A: And there were a lot of young people who crossed, and I remember one saying\nall the Jews are leaving. So I turned to him, and what the hell are you doing here?\nSo the guy was ready to beat me up, and this family, they put me in the middle of\nthe children, next to the wives, and the husbands on the end. So they protected me.\nThe next day we left. I had an address in Vienna, and we went up to Vienna. And I\nconnected \u2014 in that particular place I connected with quite a few Orthodox kids I\nknew. And we went to somebody\u2019s home who is \u2014 actually, he was a reporter from\nAustria, and he was related to one of the young men who I crossed with. And, I\nremember going into that apartment and the husband was caught in Hungary, and\nthe wife was having a party. And when she seen us, she put us in the kitchen\nNovember 9, 2008\nbecause we looked too dirty. She didn\u2019t want it to ruin their party. So after that we\nended up going into like a holding place, you know, it was a big s-school which was\nconverted. And I stayed there for a short time, until they opened, the Orthodox\ncommunity opened that big hotel. And I stayed there for a very short time. And\nthrough the Joint and HIAS, I ended up coming to the United States. But before\nthe HIAS and the Joint accepted me, they gave me a prayer book. They wanted to\nmake sure I know how to [indecipherable] I\u2019m Jewish, because a lot of people\nclaimed to be Jewish, who weren\u2019t Jewish. And I got my traveling to the United\nStates, when my parents arrived with my young brother. I actually sent somebody\nfor them. And my father said that he had a passport fo \u2014 that was my letter with, you\nknow \u2014",

        "A: \u2014if I\u2019m here already. So I came to my stepmother\u2019s brother and sister-in-law,\nand their three children. I couldn\u2019t have been welcomed nicer if I would have gone\nto my first degree relatives. They never met me.",
        "A: This was in Los Angeles. First I went to Camp Kilmer, and from Camp Kilmer\nI had another incident when they said the Jewish \u2014 Jews are leaving and I told \u2014",

I \u2014 it was where you\nmake window shades. And he says, I give you more hours to work, stay and work.\nAnd then he says, I also want you to meet my son.

I met my late husband probably about four months after I came\nto the States. My parents arrived and then I moved back with them. And I lived in\nthe Orthodox area. And they were trying to match you up daily. I had a blind date,\nsomebody came to the house, one guy I had nothing to do with. The second one was\npretty smart.

My\ngrandmother was together with my aunt, who had twin children. And they were\nfamished. And there were witnesses who seen my grandmother, that beautiful\ngrandmother of mine, who was marched into the gas chamber holding onto one of\nher twin grandchilds. Yeah. And the husband, the son-in-law survived, and my aunt\nkept in touch with him. He remarried after war and have a other family. But most of\n\u2014 all my aunts and young uncles were killed.

I did some mischievous\nthing there too. I let out the neighbor\u2019s rabbit. I don\u2019t know what the rabbit was\ndoing there, and I know that I got in trouble. I did some mischievous thing as \u2014 like\nI said, I was a spoiled little girl",
        "A: From early age on I kind of did things which maybe I shouldn\u2019t have done. And\nI\u2019m much better now.",

        "A: You know, whenever I see dead bodies, I always look for my mother. And for, I\nthink I was already married when probably I stopped. I was always hoping that\neither she had amnesia or something, and somehow she will come back again, find\nme. I think the idea of losing my mother \u2014 she was not only my mother, but she\nreally gave me the inner strength from very, very early age on. And my mother was\namazing, I didn\u2019t bring that out.",
        "A: She risk her life, and she smuggled food in for people who were incarcenated or\nsomething. So, I looked up on her. She was beautiful, she was \u2014 she was there.",
        "A: While my father was, you know, all over. He \u2014 my father was a very good man,\npeople adored him, he was hu-humorous. I mean, he made the jokes all the time,\nand my fr \u2014 girlfriends were \u2014 thought my father was somebody \u2014 you know, the-\nthey used to come over and stare at him. I think I missed my mother tremendously,\nin a sense that \u2014 especially when my \u2014 she and I were in hiding in this \u2014 you know,\nNovember 9, 2008\nand my father wasn\u2019t in the picture any more. She really talked to me like an adult,\nand confined in me and tore me like \u2014 I didn't tell you about stories that, when we\nwere on the far \u2014 fictitious \u2014 you know, for \u2014 you know, we were in hiding with that\nman. And I remember walking, and she taught me how to put the cross on me. And\nat that time already I\u2019m seven and half, eight? I\u2019m eight probably \u2014 no, not eight,\nbecause eight I was already in the camp. Instead of putting the cross, I scratched\nmyself. And my mother said, don\u2019t do that. She said with one word, and next\nminute she kissed me, that I couldn\u2019t put a cross on me. So, she kind of seen the\ngood in me, which for \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I think that reassurance meant a lot to me,\nand that acceptance. I really looked up to her, she was someone very special. And\nshe could put up with my Papa, which wasn\u2019t the easiest thing those days. It\u2019s kind\nof sad because when my father became sick he totally withdrawn. He was making\njokes and everything, and when he got sick he became withdrawn, he didn\u2019t go to\nthe shul any more. He used to go every morning, you know, to daven, you know\nwhat that means. Yeah. And when he became sick he totally withdrew himself and\nhe \u2014 when my late husband died, he died in \u201987, December 24\", it was such a big\nloss for my father, losing my husband. It was \u2014 he really looked up to him, they\nreally did a lot of things together. My late husband was a wonderful chess player,\nand my father was a good chess player, they played chess. They played pinochle\nNovember 9, 2008\ntogether, you know, cards together. So \u2014 and I took, you know, my fa \u2014 I left my\nlate husband home, he played cards with my father, or played chess with my father.\nAnd if one of them won you heard about it for days, or vice-a-versa. And I took my\nstepmother shopping, you know. So, you know, there was a division between it.",
        "A: And I did play \u2014 I didn\u2019t play chess with my late husband, but I played a mean\nplayer \u2014 mean hand of cards, and so did my kids. My kids, from early age on got\ntremendous amount of self reliance, in a sense. You have to be independent,\nbecause my brother wasn\u2019t so independent, and we wanted to kind of \u2014 we kind of\nover \u2014",
        "A: And the kids\u2019 education was \u2014 emphasis put on, to the highest degree. And my\nlate husband took such pride in it that all of us became college graduate, including\nhis wife, you know, over here. And my kids were exceptionally good students. My\n\u2014 one of my daughter attended Harvard, you know, as a undergraduate. And \u2014 to\nbecome, you know, the professions they choose, and they are still leaders in their\ncommunity, so they learned something at home.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: And I, as a young American I had an accent, much worse probably than even\ntoday, and I was active in school activities. I was the treasurer for the Boy Scouts,\nfor the Girl Scouts. I became a room mother representative. So I\u2014 I was a typical\nAmerican. I visited women who didn\u2019t have husbands and helped them out, you\nknow, to connect them. And then my late husband says, you do it anyway, go back\nto sc \u2014 get the degree, and \u2014 and do it full time. So I went back to school and I did it\nbecause I still tend to overextend myself. I have that tendency.",
        "A: I try to give back, because I feel that I survived, and I survived because of, as a\nyoung child I probably couldn\u2019t have survived if somebody wouldn't have give a\nkindness to me, but they did. And I, if I can help somebody, I like the idea of\nhelping, and through the Child Survivor organization, I made friends, which is a\ncombination of friends and relatives. I \u2014 to some extent they are maybe closer than\nyou can be to some relatives, because you can talk about the pains and everything.\nAnd nonjudgmental.",
        "A: Oh yes. My poor stepmother\u2019s mother, her son Shlymie(ph) was killed, and he\nwas apparently a saint. I never knew him. And she told me. Not once, not twice.\nNovember 9, 2008\nAnd then she apologized, you know. But she personally told me, and I have been\ntold, you know. We went to conference, I will never forget, the guy wasn\u2019t aware\nthat I was in camp. He said, what do you know, you were just a child, and you were\nnot even in the camps. Or, you were Hungarian, you were a shorter length of time.\nSo, you know, they don\u2019t even know, but they look at you as a child, and you know,\nyou were a child, how would you know what suffering really was?",
        "A: I mean, suffering was pretty crucial. I mean, there was a time I had clothes, in\nBergen-Belsen I remember I put something under my hat that \u2014 and I slept on it,\nthat you know, I was together with Gypsies, couldn\u2019t get away from Gypsies. So,\nthere were Gypsies in the same barrack where I was. And in the morning, it was\ngone. And I remember putting some kind of a blank \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t a blanket, but\nsomething like it, around me. And when I had to stand achtung, you know, the line-\nup, the woman throwed it off from me, the same way, you know, with that stick.\nWhen I see those sticks it scares the daylight out of me. And for a long time I was\npetrified of darks, too. So it \u2014 it was really \u2014 I mean, I listened to some older\nsurvivor describe and it \u2014 flashes come back to you. You know, things which you\nthink you forgot, and then kind of ha \u2014I go to sleep and all of a sudden I \u2014I see\nNovember 9, 2008\ncertain things which I didn\u2019t realize that they were \u2014 some were stored in the\nmemory, they laying. And it \u2014 they come forward.",
        "A: And like, recently, just in \u2014 I think 1t was in June, I was involved in the Bearing\nWitness program with UCLA, did you hear about it?",
        "A: And I was matched up with a young man who comes from a Iranian background,\nI think he was born here already. And we had like three or four sessions together.\nWe met for lunch, and \u2014 and I remember when I told him how old I was in Bergen-\nBelsen, he went in almost like a state of shock. And I remember touching him and\nholding him. His \u2014I said, I\u2019m here. And he just couldn\u2019t \u2014 what did you do all day,\nwas his a \u2014 a question. How could you be here? So I realized it\u2019s \u2014 even for me,\nwhen I look at my grandkids, it\u2019s hard to believe that a person at that age, I don\u2019t\nknow. God forbid nobody should be tested on it. And I\u2014 when last year I came\nback from Israel, I went to visit my daughter, because my granddaughter\u2019s birthday\nis November 15\". So I came back two days later, I flew to Seattle. And I looked on\nmy granddaughter, she just turned eight. And I realized I was in the camp, I\nprobably didn\u2019t even know what day it was.",
        "A: And tears got into my eyes and I started to cry. And my daughter and I went a\nlittle later on a ride, and she says, Mom, I can\u2019t handle it. I can\u2019t handle the idea of\nknowing what pain you went through, and I can\u2019t handle you associating it with my\ndaughter. So I heard it.",
        "A: And I\u2014 I\u2019m respecting it, and I \u2014 I make a point of not bringing it up.",
        "A: But my other daughters \u2014 my story was written up re-recently in the L.A. Jewish\nJournal. It was about four or five people were in the Indestructible Spirit project, I\ndon\u2019t know if you heard about tt.",
        "A: Well, and they quote me \u2014 they took a picture of my youngest grandson and I.\nBill Aron, did you hear of Bill Aron?",
        "A: He\u2019s a very well known photographer and he \u2014 he took pictures of quite a few\nsurvivors. And there was a write-up, you know, somebody interviewed me, and er \u2014\nand the story about the potato peels was written on. And with my grandson, I am\nholding my grandson. And my 10 \u2014 12 year old grandson was reading it. That\u2019s my\nGrandma. So, in a way he \u2014 yeah.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: You know, there are stories which happened, and cruelty which happened, some\nof them I probably still cannot talk about. And maybe they are better \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 not to be said. I have memories of sted \u2014 trying to find a solid surface to put\nmy head against it, to kill the lice which were biting. I mean, it was so painful. I\nmean, how can you da \u2014 talk about things of that nature? It happened. And then I\nremember about my feet when it was frozen, and it was painful. And people, total\nstrangers who never knew me, were holding onto me so I don\u2019t go into there and\ndon\u2019t have my feet amputated, or probably killed. So cruelty still happens today,\nand injustice still happens today, and probably the reason I started to speak now,\nand I wanted to give my oral in \u2014 interview to you, because if we can stop only one\nperson \u2014 and that particular young man I mentioned to you I met through UCLA, he\nsaid it was one of the most meaningful experience I had til now in my life, he says,\nseeing you at UCLA, he says, to me, to meet a survivor and to see where you are\ntoday. So, you hear my reason for being here.",
        "A: Thank you, and I felt \u2014\n54November 9, 2008",
        "A: \u2014 avery strong bond with you, I don\u2019t know why. You have the face, you could\nbe one of my \u2014 you are too young to be my child, maybe a grandchild, not quite.",
