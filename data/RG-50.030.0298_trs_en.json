        "Q: You could just begin by telling me your name and date of birth and where you were born.",
        "A: Certainly. My name is Dov Levin now. And I was born like Belle Levin. Belle its means\nin Yiddish, Bill, animal, so the translation in Hebrew is Dov, but because we were all the\ntime brought up in Hebrew school, Hebrew youth movement, this also, this what many,\nmany people know me. It is -- I was born in 1925 in Kovno, it's called now Kaunas. It\nwas capital of Lithuania, because Wilno was occupied by the Polish soldiers and so on.\nSo, in 1925, it was still a Jewish autonomy, Lithuania. So, if I would lucky, so I could\nfind my certificate of birth, written in Lithuanian language and in Hebrew. Maybe one\nday I will find it, but what is more important for our conversation is that I was one of\ntwins. My sister was Basya (ph), or in Hebrew Batya (ph), and she unfortunately,\nperished in Stutthof, during the Holocaust, and after her my, one of my kids Basmat, who\nis now living in New York, she is named after her. Basmat, a very cute girl. And I have to\ntell something about my parents. My father was Hirsh Levin, in Hebrew, it's Tzvi, in\nLithuanian it's changed the word H 1s G -- Girsh. My mother -- he is also from Kovno,\nmy mother came from a small village by the name Retchna (ph). It is in north, northwest\nof Kovno, and her maiden name was Wigodel (ph), some write it with a W, some with a\nV, but her first name, I forgot to tell, that it is Bluma (ph). Bluma. Bluma it means a\nflower, therefore, my second daughter is named Nitzana (ph), it means the crisp before\nthe flower come out. My son 1s called Tzvika (ph), on the name of my father.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about Kovno before the war. Was it an exciting place to live? Was\nthere a lot to do culturally, politically?",
        "A: When I was a child, I -- for me Kovno was everything. It was everything because we\ncould find there everything what belongs to the Jewish life, from our synagogue to our\nschool in Hebrew or Yiddish, till many universal things like cinemas and so on and so on.\nSo we felt ourself as a part of Europe. Part of, I would say, Western Europe, or Europe,\nyes. It was an orientation. In our house the German language was one of the languages\nspoken, because my father used to work with German companies, and after Hitler came\nhe changed a little and went to other companies in England. So, he now house the coming\nand going people from abroad and what's most important is we have very good\nconnection with Palestine. Actually my generation, or part of my generation we were\ndreaming about Palestine like we were there, and the geography of Palestine, I knew\nbetter than the geography of our country, of Lithuania. The same also with the languages.\nThe Lithuanian language we only had to do it for examinations and so on. But the daily\nlanguage was Hebrew. Hebrew. Hebrew at the school. Hebrew in the youth movement,\nand Hebrew when I make my first date with a girl in the street, we also did Hebrew, and\nmy parents understand Hebrew. See, I wasn't one. It was a culture, a part of the culture.\nThe -- not everybody was the same kind, but let's say 50 percent of my generation was\nthe same in Kovno. This time in Kovno, I remember there were many, many shuls (ph),\nor synagogues, about 40 I remember from there, and I think it was more or less right, a\nreal number, and I attend a Hebrew primary school. Afterwards what we called\ngymanasium, it means high school. I was in Hebrew, and my youth movement was called\nHa'Shomer Ha'Tzair (ph). So, we were oriented for to go after we attend our school, to\nPalestine and there or to be on the kibbutz, or to go to the Techni, Technion in Haifa --\nthat was my other .",
        "Q: Why were you so intrigued or driven towards Palestine?",
        "A: I cannot understand it now, but it was so natural the same as a I was born Jewish. So it\nwas a part of all I been, my family, my bigger family. It was our culture, our orientation,\nso we took it for granted that so should be. Even one of my uncles went to Russia, but he\nwas an exception. His name was Borris Levin, and only this week I met his daughter. She\ncome now from Moscow to settle here in Scranton, Pennsylvania.",
        "Q: What -- I'd like to hear a little bit more about the Youth Movement that you were\ninvolved in, the group you just mentioned. What was the basis of that? What were you\ntaught? What kind of activities did you participate in?",
        "A: You know, most of the youth movements are alike more or less. They are making sport\ngames and making journeys and making camps, summer camps and other camps, singing\na lot, a lot, a lot, and telling stories. Very nice stories mostly about Israel and about the\nkibbutzim and making it very idealistic and really for me Eretz Yisrael, Palestine, was\nlike in the pictures, that palm tree with tent and chalutzim (ph), pioneers, are dancing\naround, sometimes also working. So that also was the contents of our activities. We were\n-- they told us what is the daily life, not in Tel Aviv, like in the kibbutzim. And that was\nmade by emissaries, shlichim (ph) in Hebrew, which come very often to us, so we knew\nalso the later songs from Palestine and we very up to date what's going there, what\nhappened there. Sometimes more than what happened in our own country.",
        "Q: Did they teach you how to use weapons, how to fight if you needed to, any of those sorts\nof things?",
        "A: No. Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair was one of the few organizations that were socialist minded. So,\nthe orientation of weapon was only for defense. So, they talked with us about the\nshomrim (ph), it means the guardsmen in Palestine that at night they are riding on the\nhorses and that was a . [remember even the names of these guys. So,\nbut, it was only a need, but not too much, in the opposite let's say of the Beitar\nMovement, they were really military oriented. And I remember in our class, in the\nHebrew class, let's say half of the class was -- belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, the other\nto Beitar, so we are quarrelling. One of the discussions was how do you mean to settle in\nPalestine, only by buying an acre after an acre ground and to work. Each country must be\ntaken only by force that the history is in all the countries 1n all the world, all the times.\nSo, we were quarrelling and so on and some times we are also beating each others. So it\nwas not only in our class, it was like in all places. The community is divided in many\norientations, in many ideologies, but our whole community from the Communists till the\nmost, most Orthodox people like my late grandfather, his name was David Levin. He was\na patriarchic Jew, a very strong man, like in these times. Not like my father, my father\nwas already another generation, more liberal. So, this whole community was Jewish. We\ncannot remember intermarriage, and if 1t happens, so everybody knew who is who and it\nwas something. I remember that also that in our classroom, one girl brought one day --\nwe were without hats, we were -- it was more traditional but not Orthodox, anyway,\nwhen one of my girlfriends from the class, a classmate, she brought a sandwich with\nbutter and meat, so everybody shouts, \"Look what's happened, she's eating so and so.\"\nSo, the public mind of the class was against maybe the other day she didn't know because\nshe didn't felt herself convenient. I even remember her name. It was Tanya Tzvi. Tanya\nTzvi, yes. And she's still living. She's in Tel Aviv. Yes.",
        "Q: So, it was a very religious community?",
        "A: Not very, but it was very Yiddish, Jewish minded. For instance, Shabbat (ph), I think 95\npercent of the stores, Jewish stores were closed. Orthodox, or not Orthodox, or traditional\nor anti-traditional, only the last years we are accepts, yes accepts. And only some cafe\nhouses or other places but usually they are closed and it was not an easy problem because\nfor the government we had also had to be closed Sundays. So, it was lose of two days of\nearning. Anyway, so it was.",
        "Q: So you're talking about Kovno and Slobotka, the whole area?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Which area did you grow up in?",
        "A: I grew up in the -- now we can call it the down town of Kovno, but not Slobotka.\nSlobotka was a suburb. You have to cross a river by the name of Vilitya (ph), or now it's\ncalled Nairis (ph). In Slobotka were concentrated for many, many years a more poor\npopulation. More poor, some of them very Orthodox but some -- on the other hand there\nwere many people who were Communist oriented. And that -- anyway I can think that in\nmy classroom only one boy was from Slobotka and it's also because his mother was a\ndentist there.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something because you just mentioned Communists. There were also\nyouth groups that were Communist oriented right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I'm just sort of wondering how one chose to belong to Beitar versus the Communists.\nWhat were some of the differences? Did -- was there any interaction between these\ngroups?",
        "A: Interactions were what I mentioned before, it's fighting.",
        "Q: How did you decide to join the group you chose?",
        "A: Oh. Yes, I remember that it was a very deep sympathy for this because they were also\nscouts and when I was a child I like much to be a scout. And officially Ha'Shomer\nHa'Tzair for the government we are calling Jewish Scouts. Maybe if I would be in\nanother society and my father was be very right, political right orientation, maybe, I was\nsent or not sent be encouraged to go to Beitar. I remember another thing that I have\nquarrels with my parents because I went Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair. For them it was too left.\nAfterwards when I grew up, when I was a teenager, so it was incidents, sometimes\ninstead to go to the synagogue I went to the activities there. But it was not only my\nproblem, it was a problem for a whole generation and it happens in all the countries till\nnow. Yeah.",
        "Q: What about the Communist groups. Did you know people who joined those?",
        "A: Yes, they were for us very mysterious because the Communist party and the other people\nwere in underground. This party wasn't allowed in Lithuania, because Lithuania was very\nmuch right oriented and what I remember that the -- May, first May we watched many\ntimes that police forces are ready for demonstrations and we saw that sometimes red flags\nat were hanged that night and morning the police made effort to put them down. Of\ncourse as young people we were sympathizing with the Communists, but it was for us\nvery not -- unclear who is a Communist, why and what. We knew its have to do\nsomething with Russia, Soviet Russia of course, but not too much more. I would not say\nit was a puzzle for us, but something mystery.",
        "Q: I think you said that you sort of sympathized when their demonstrations were put down.\nWhy would you sympathize with them?",
        "A: Oh, that's like a child what -- who don't police, the cops.",
        "Q: Now in 1940, I think, the Russians took over Kovno, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did that change your life?",
        "A: Oh, it was a big change, yes. I remember it was at Shabbat, Saturday, the 15th of June.\nWe were in this day in summer camp of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair and my counselor was\nafterwards a very known woman, Chaika Grossman (ph) from Bialystok. She told us this\ndays -- this day but not only this day as she left oriented -- orientated -- girl or young\nwoman escaped from the Russian in Bialystok, and came as refugee to Lithuania because\nshe was a Zionist and she could not live under the Soviets, even, even Ha'Shomer\nHa'Tzair was very, very much orient -- Soviet oriented, so it was how to tell you, half,\nhalf, mixed feelings about Soviet Russia. And now this Shabbat we heard -- the Saturday\n-- we heard noise, afterwards I understood that it was the movings of tanks and we left\neverything and we moved very quickly to house, by foot. It was about eight miles or so to\ngo back by foot. And his place was Claiboneshkis (ph). It's the opposite side of Slobotka\nbut on the Kovno side. It was a village, a small village and I remember that going home\nwe saw many Lithuanians with angry faces. Some of them took their guns because they\nbelonged to a semi-military organization called Shaulei (ph), Shootings Man. So, they\nwear uniforms some of them, and some took the guns and they were running here and\nthere like something happened and they didn't know what to do. Bur they were very\nangry and didn't so of course smile to us. Of course, the opposite. So I understood that\nsomething is going to be wrong. That is a feeling. To me as a Jewish boy, boy, I was then\n15 years old, yeah, 15 and a half. So, we came to Kovno, and Kovno was a very like a\nfestival. People are staying in the streets and making a for the Red\nArmy. Jewish, non Jewish, all mixed, the crowd. And I went straight home because to see\nwhat happened, and that was beginning of the Soviet era in Kovno that lasted one year\nand seven days. For me personally, it was a very bad -- no it was not a bad time, it was\nalso interesting time. First of all, I was shocked by the closing of school. Hebrew school\nwas abolished and we have to in the same, yes in the same building we have to learn\nYiddish. I couldn't understand it. Who is forcing me, why? I knew all because they were\nagainst zionism and Hebrew 1s like a Zionist language. We were very against, and the\nother thing was Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair was abolished. And on the other hand, it was very\ninteresting time, every second day there was a parade, a meeting, a demonstration with\nsongs, very famous songs, that we -- some of them we heard even before, like \"Katusha\"\n(ph). (humming). It's -- in Israel it's popular till now, but no more in Russia. And other\nsongs -- marches --",
        "Q: These were Russian songs?",
        "A: These were Russian songs, of course. The French did it in another way, till now, but the\nRussian song \"Katusha\". Katusha is the name of a Russian girl, Katia, Katy.",
        "Q: What other -- what other changes in terms of people's lifestyles were made when the\nSoviets took over -- were business closed? I mean, what -- was it more difficult to be a\nJew openly, or --",
        "A: No, not at all. It's the contrary, now we become really equal citizens. I could see Jewish\npolicemen. I was very proud in this, first time, but the same time for instance my father\nshould to work at Saturday. My father, how my father, but my grandfather was very\nOrthodox man so they took away him from his store, put in a comissar and he have to sit\nhome and to count his days, nothing. I'm not sure that he gets a small pension. I don't\nknow, maybe we helped him. Till this day he was a well-to-do man. What you call your\nmiddle-middle, but now he become unemployed even though he was about 70-75 years,\nbut still he was every day going to the store. The store was more than a place for earning.\nIt was occupation, there everybody came to him and so, and so it was like a club. And\nthat happened to many people. So nobody, nobody starve from hunger, nobody, but it\nhappened after things that people were rich had to go out and leave their nice apartment\nand suites and sometimes also their cars. Poor people for them it was a better change.\nAnd for me as a socialist, or socialist-oriented, I could understand it and evaluate it. Even\nfor my family it was bad. Another of my uncles was -- he visit twice Palestine and\nhesitate if to settle or not, now they took all his fabric, what's is -- factory. It was a\nfactory of leather, a big one. They were working in it I guess about 35 or 40 workers.\nAnd one of them became the commissar, he was thrown out, and I understand he was\nvery sorry he didn't go to Palestine with his wife. His name was Moses Levin. I have\nhere, I am keeping many papers and forms of his factory till now. I got them last year.\nSo, this is an example of a family that something changes the life. My mother has also to\nwork. Till then she was a housekeeper like all the balabustes (ph) in our class, also a\nmiddle-middle, upper -- no it was middle-middle, enough. Here she has to work everyday\nso there were some days that all the family didn't meet because one is working afternoon.\nOne is working from morning until noon. And Shabbos -- Saturday we can not also meet\nlike we used. So it was something new for me but I wasn't too happy about this.",
        "Q: Let me ask you one question about the different groups. Now before the Soviets took\nover, you said the Communist youth groups were really underground. Did they become\nmore important under that year of Soviet rule than some of the Zionist movements?",
        "A: Of course, they become now the rulers, the mayflowers. Of course. For them -- especially\nthese people who were sitting for months or years. One of them was 20 years sitting in\nthe prisons. They become the commissars. I remember the commissar was 1n my\ngrandfather's store. He was still without hair, you know, because in the prisons they have\nto cut their hair. So he was still very new released from the prison and the government\ngave them new clothes, mostly leather coats. The commissars, that's the tradition of\nSoviet Russia from the October revolution and so on and anyway that was the gona (ph),\nthe gona it means it closes. Also, my father didn't wear more his hat and wear a caskette\n(ph), we call it, like a Stalin hat on his head. That what modern, to be a politaria (ph) man\nand a socialist and so on and so on. And I remember also me, 1n -- when I was in the high\nschool, I have a special uniform, so the uniforms they called it \"Habits of the Bourgeoi.\"\nNo more everybody is wearing what he wants and what you are more closer to the model\nof study and all the other big shots, such a shirt not too much with a tie. So the people\nunderstood that that is more wanted now. So, it was a big change but there were many\nconcerts and the cultural life was very, very intensive. The first time to go to the theater\nwas then for me.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Because to go into the theater before, it was a problem to get a ticket in the big theater\nand here in the Yiddish theater I didn't want to go because it was kiche (ph) and I was not\ntoo much involved in the Yiddish culture, except talking Yiddish and reading Jewish\nnewspaper, daily newspaper. In our city there were about four newspapers, daily\nnewspapers, in such a small city as Kovno.",
        "Q: Jewish daily newspapers -- all four Jewish?",
        "A: Yiddish, Yiddish not Jewish. There was only one weekly in Lithuanian, and that also was\nmade more for political terms. So, coming back to your question, so please remind me.",
        "Q: We were talking the -- about how the Communist groups became much more important.",
        "A: It was very natural that they become. It was their time now. People coming from the\nunderground to the public. Well, as a members of the Communist party and the people\nwho belong in other ways to this party or to this movement or to this ideology who were\nbefore or in prisons or in non-legal situation, they become now big shots, and it was very\n-- naturally it was very -- everybody could understand it and what happened that some\npeople were far from them, now went to see, maybe one of his family is also between\nthem. Maybe he will be now helped by them, privileged by them, to get a job. It wasn't so\neasy to get a job, because everybody have to fulfill questionnaires. Who you are, who\nwas your father0, what was your income and so on and to which organizations you did\nbelong and etc. So some people even they were before bourgeoi, what belonged to the so-\ncalled bourgeoi, or it was another name. Enemy of the people. Now, if they have a good\none of the family who was a Communist and he was not afraid to help them, not afraid,\nsome denied, \"Okay you are my cousin, but I know who you are, so please leave me\nalone.\" Some of them helped also and what another thing that we have seen many people\nthat were very rich before and not only they were leaved on their places but they became\n-- they make even a progress, they are promoted. So, we were told that even before they\npaid contributions to the Communists funds. Or maybe they have them more, maybe they\nwere spies, [don't know what they were such -- we called them -- how did we call them?\nSalon (ph) Communists.",
        "Q: One more question and then I want to move onto the Germans. Yousaid -- your\norganization became illegal. Did you continue -- did Beitar and some of the other\norganizations continue but on an underground basis now?",
        "A: Yes. Some of the organizations began to -- no, officially they abolished themselves in\norder to avoid troubles. They declared -- some of the Zionist groups or even religious\ngroups who were, who were abolished, I think all of them declared officially that they\nstopped their work, their activity in order to avoid troubles. But bit by bit some of the\nmembers who were accustomed to meet every day or every few days together continue to\ndo it, and then somebody gave them an orientation that if you want you can do it, but\nnobody is responsible for you, do it yourself or you won't. And so they established small\ncells like before the Communists did it, in the near past. So, now the Zionists did it and\nmy organization, my youth movement, Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, I remember that some of\nthem, some of them were meeting each day -- no, not each day, twice a week maybe, to\nread Hebrew books. That was activity. Because it's not forbidden, but not fashionable -- it\nan understatement -- so they did it. When I want to join them, they said, \"We are too\nmuch, no, go look another place.\" After that they told me that they were afraid of me. I\ndon't know why, maybe because I have some friends who were in the Youth Communist's\nParty -- movement, youth movement called Consomole (ph). So that they told me\nafterwards. Anyway, so Idid -- what I did myself in order to express my feelings,\nafternoon or at night I come to the, to a new -- through this old building of the high\nschool and stole Hebrew books and brought them home and I was very happy. Yes. For\nme it was like I did what I have to do, what I like to do and nobody -- maybe I can be\npunished for this but only for stealing but not for reading the Hebrew books, because I\nalso, my old Hebrew books that I got for bar mitzvah and other things I -- they were kept.\nWe didn't throw them. I remember also that even the religious was very unpopular and\nsome of us were forced to come to the school Yom Kippur and Pesach, and so on. We\ntried to keep at home how we could -- and me I was not so happy with that religion in\nthis time. I understand it because that is something of all continuity so I did it also, no too\nmuch, but I did it. So I remember Shabbat when our family were together, so sometimes\nplace my father also make Kiddush (ph) and I didn't refuse. What happened at this time --\nyes -- I didn't stop to write letters to Palestine.",
        "Q: You could have gotten in trouble, yes?",
        "A: Yes or not, I don't know. It could be. The question how they would comment it, the\nauthorities. Another thing, I also heard the of Jerusalem. It was very hard, but\nit was a technical problem so I remember I wrote to one of my friends of the class, my\nclassmates, his names was Amos Rabinovitz (ph), Amos Rabinovitz, that why you will\nnot tell your authority to make better that we can hear it even in Lithuanian Kovno.",
        "Q: You can probably guess one of the reasons I'm asking you about these youth groups and\nwhether you had to go underground and all of that is because later on you were involved\nin resistance activities, and I'm wondering if any of the tricks you learned, any of the\nrelationships you formed as a boy were important later on. Were a way that you kind of\ndeveloped that helped you and got you interested in resistance activities later?",
        "A: Yes, partly, I didn't belong to the cells usually which numbered three or four members. I\ntold you why and there was no trouble on this, but I knew and also we knew, all the\ngenerations, about underground because we were brought up what I told you of Jewish\nmodern history that -- and not only Jewish history but about the socialists or\nrevolutionaries in Russia against the Czar. So, we knew what to do and we saw many\nfilms about this, so it was not very new for us. But there were some people who begin at\nthis time to publish a underground newspaper in Hebrew, but that I learned not at this\ntime but in the ghetto afterwards.",
        "Q: Okay, let's -- I want to move ahead a little bit. Do you remember what was happening the\nday that Kovno was occupied by the Germans?",
        "A: Kovno was occupied by the Germans not the first day of war, but the third day. It was\nTuesday. You know what, I felt a little better because the bombing stopped and we have\nno special shelters so we were hiding ourselves in -- on the stairs between the floors,\nbecause it was in the middle of a very heavy building, it was the safest place. And you\nhave to run, and here and there. So, first of all was its relaxation, a certain relaxation. We\ncan go to bed, maybe and we can eat a time more or less that was the first reaction. We\nknew that we have not to expect good times. That we knew very good from the refugees\nwho came to us and from the newspapers I had also knew not exactly but a lot what they\ndid when they came in Poland a year ago and so on and so on but everybody 1s thinking\nthat to me it will not come. And I remember that the day before somebody informed us\nfrom our house it was my also from my classroom his name is Avraham Yashpan (ph).\nHe is now living in Rio de Janeiro and told me, \"Look, I'm going to escape to Russia.\nThey will slaughter us.\" They, it means not only Germans, but everybody except the\nJewish. We felt that the Lithuanians don't like us, or hate us, better. We felt it, but we\ndidn't know how much. So, I told him I cannot leave my family. Or in other words, so I\nheard his mother voice through the telephone, \"You see Belle is a better son than you.\nHe's not going to leave his family.\" Yes, and this woman by the name of Rachael, or\nRochel, Rachel Yashpan, she was in the concentration camp in Stutthof, and I met her\nafter the war near Rio de Janeiro. She could not come to Palestine for certain reasons. So\nwe were expecting somebody is going to happen, and it happened very quickly. I\nremember from this only two or three things. One, it come to us, I would call them a gang\nof five or six people, people from the street. People with guns or with half-guns or\nsomething and they took us to the back yard -- not the back yard but to the -- you know,\nall the houses were a big place around, so they took us and when we come down, we\nwere living the third floor, we show all the Jewish families in the house. It means that 90\n-- 99 percent except the Gentile are staying in a line and the people come to take us are\nstaying against us with guns and we was very frightened, except when he put, one of\nthem, a young guy put his gun against me. So I remember my mother told me, \"If you\nturn now he will not harm you. He knows that you are a good boy.\" And they told us they\nhad seen the Jewish people are working against the Germans and against the Lithuanian\npartisans. They called themselves partisans. So, I don't know what happened but we were\nreleased to our houses. When we come to the house we have seen that in my daddy's\ntable, he has his own table for writing, what do you call it shaipdish (ph), so he was\nmissing his golden box for cigarettes. So, maybe this was their excuse to come here or to\nrelease us, I don't know. I don't remember. I remember another thing. I remember the\nsame day we heard in the radio the first order in Lithuanian language, \"Nobody is to go\nout and nobody is to take arms,\" and so on. What each army is doing when it's coming\ninto an occupied area, but one, I think it was the last paragraph there, was for each\nGerman soldier will be shot, it will be shot 100 Jewish people signed by Colonel\nBobyalous (ph), the commandant of Kovno, Kaunas. He was appointed right now. And\nnow, let me tell you the same, a year ago when I visited Lithuania as a member of a\ndelegation from the Knesset I met in the parliament the son of Mr. Bobyalous, head of\nthe committee of defense and foreign affairs. And he should be my host to take me so I\navoided twice to shake hands with him, and I didn't.",
        "Q: That's ironic.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: We were talking about how -- what was going on when the Nazis occupied Lithuania,\noccupied Kovno. As I understand it, there was a tremendous amount of chaos, certainly\nin the beginning. People were being beaten, killed, taken out. I don't know if this was\nsomething that you saw or experienced?",
        "A: Something I saw through the window, and I avoided such things to see, naturally, and I\nsaw through the window, for instance, that a young man is going on the street, and\nsomebody 1s arresting him or holding him. This young man took from his pocket a\ncertain paper and showed it to the others -- no I think they told him to go back. He\nrefused. That I understood from his movements, and they showed a certain paper maybe\nit was -- he get it from the Germans, or he worked for somebody already, so they become\nvery angry and took him by the two sides and arrested him. And what makes me very bad\nfeelings is that all the crowds on the streets, they are trying to make a lynch of him. So,\nthen I felt it's not only the Germans, but everybody enemy to each Jew, even to people\nwho were not Communists, who were not part of the Soviet government. It's enough to be\na Jew. So, for instance, my grandfather, I came to visit him because he was living in the\nmore quieter neighborhood than mine, so my parents decided we are living maybe too\nmuch in the center of the city, so it's more dangerous so let's go to the grandfather. The\nGrandfather was living on a small street called Nomonu (ph) Street, Nomonu 14, I think,\nand everything was very quiet. It was a garden on the corner, very idealistic, very quiet,\nand some day came a Lithuanian, civilian Lithuanian with a rifle and come to see. So, he\ntold that he is running after people to work, taking them to work. That was a daily habit.\nJewish people were taken to work. It was part of a to work or to making them\nwork -- it was part of making them that everybody can see them in bad situation, the\nJewish people. That, for instance, an old man has to go with two chairs. He's in the\nmiddle of the street and everybody is going and beating him and so on and so on. So, it\nwas much more than only physical work. So, once such man with a rifle come to take my\nold, old grandfather to work. My grandfather refused. So, he even didn't talk to him\nLithuanian. My grandfather asked me to tell him that he's too old. So, he told me that he\nwill take him by force. So, the grandfather told me to tell him that nothing will help, and\nthey can't take him. So, nothing will -- we will not go. And my grandfather has\nexperience from World War I that I knew also with all the gangs in Russia when they\nwere deported to Russia by the Czars in the -- during the revolution that each gang who\ncome -- occupies a certain city took people and arrested them sometimes he cruel to\nthem, so, he had very, very good experience of life. I would not say good, but rich, let's\nsay. So, he refused, and what happened, in a certain moment I saw two German soldiers\nare coming with a Lithuanian guy. Afterwards I was told that a neighbor from the same\nbuilding saw that the old and very distinguished Mr. Dovid Levin 1s taken by such a\nhooligan, to work, he was very shocked. So far, that her apartment where two German\nsoldiers were put to live there -- 1t happened in all houses. It was a custom that in each\nhouse had to take some soldiers and they were living there. She said, \"Look they are\ngoing to take this old man to work.\" So, they come and saved him. That was very -- I was\nvery impressed by this. Soldiers, but not Gestapo and not other soldiers. A private or a\ncorporal.",
        "Q: All this people that were taken out every day to work, were they really being taken out to\nwork?",
        "A: No. Sometimes they were taken to only to what I told you, like with the chairs. But\nwhat's more important is that some, a big part of them didn't come home. They were\ntaken to the Seventh Fort, to the prison, to another place, murdered. The woman or girls\nwere raped before and afterwards murdered, or by shooting or with knives and so on and\nso on.",
        "Q: Now how did you get information? How did you know this was happening -- at the time,\nnot what you learned later?",
        "A: I learned it later. It could be a day later even because some of these girls told us how they\nescaped, they were saved. I remember a name Ella Volpe (ph). Ella Volpe. She was also\nin my age, about 15 1/2, a nice looking girl. She told us when she was in this fortress,\nNumber 7 or Number 4, I don't remember this, but the other woman took water with sand\nand put on her face so she will look like an ugly or a handicapped woman or old woman\nso nobody will hurt her. That I remember.",
        "Q: Did it work?",
        "A: Yes. So, she told us you know it was very unconvenient to examine her.",
        "Q: The people who were taken to the forts and killed, how did you get information about\nthat? How did you know what was happening?",
        "A: As this girl, also others were released -- small, small part, I would say ten, fifteen\npercent, no more, and they told us very horrible stories. I remember one of them that they\nwere thirsty, so the Lithuanian guardsmen, also they called himself partisans, he told\nthem, \"If you bring me money I'll let you go to have a water from a swamp, or maybe\nanother place also for water.\" So, they went and on the way they were shoot. I heard also\nthat one of our teachers, former teachers, by the name Goldman, he committed -- he fight\nback. He told them very hard words, and they shoot him after he showed that he is going\nto defend himself. That's what I remember from these times.",
        "Q: Do you know who was responsible for these massacres? Was it Nazis, was it\nLithuanians?",
        "A: Lithuanians.",
        "Q: Einsatzgruppen (ph)?",
        "A: The word Einsatzgruppen we didn't heard at the time. We have seen only that usually on\neach group of Lithuanians who are going to murder or make operation for action, it they\ncalled aktzion (ph), were one or two Germans, so the proportion was one two eight, one\nto ten. I don't know exactly, but the daily work usually did the Lithuanians except that\nwhen we come to the ghetto, it was the 15th of August 1944, so there were the beginning\nhautios (ph), and the huge population everybody has to deliver everything of money,\ngold, silver, and other jewels. So, that was done only by German police force. They were\nalso very cruel. They maybe have good -- in their towns they have good training how to\ndo this. Shoot people in order to frighten the others. So, this was done only by Germans,\nnot Lithuanians.",
        "Q: They did not trust the Lithuanians for that.",
        "A: Yes, I think you are right. Yes.",
        "Q: Well, let's talk about the ghetto. How did you happen to get sent to the ghetto? How did\nyou get there? Were you able to take things? Was it -- how did this transformation come\nabout?",
        "A: First at all, it's funny but it was a good news that we are coming to the ghetto. Because\nthe feeling was that in the ghetto we will be preserved. Probably. We will be only Jewish\npeople maybe it will stop all the -- these horrible things, to catch people on the streets, in\nthe houses and to kill them etc. So, there we will work, we will do what happened in\nPoland, so that is and maybe we can survive the war, maybe. So it was good feeling. A\ngood feeling. A good feeling this time, better than before. So, we had to look after a place\nin the ghetto. The ghetto was in Slobotka, the same suburbs, Slobotka, and it was done by\ntwo ways. Or that everybody chose a place and they made exchange with the Lithuanian\nor Polish family who were living there, or to get such a place from the Jewish\nCommittee. Meanwhile there was the Jewish Committee which become afterwards, the\nJudenrat. We didn't know in this time all the names of the famous people, but we were in\nconnections with the level of officers, working in the offices of this Committee, and they\ngave us places. We have to go to the ghetto and we could take everything, everything,\nand I remember from Kovno to Slobtka were a very, very, very long line of vehicles with\neverything. Sometimes also furnitures, and the Jewish had something in the houses.\nEverything you went to the ghetto, and it was before the house search, so the Germans\ncouldn't find concentrated, they have not to go from house to house in Kovno. I\nremember an episode that we come to the Lithuanian family talking about the exchange,\nso the it happened that we also had to give them some money. My father didn't have more\nmoney, so he took out the cover of the table, 1t was a very expensive of a very good linen,\nwith colorful and so on and gave her so, \"Here you have it.\" I became very sensitive in\nthis time and if I want to cry, because it was for me a very situation of helpless. So, I\ninterfered and told this lady, \"Look, you took our -- most of our furniture, most\neverything, you have to know how to keep it.\" That was my - that I remember very good.\nShe looked at me and cried also she. I was going to cry, she cried, but she took. And --",
        "Q: Before when you were talking about all the vehicles lined up to get into the ghetto, can\nyou tell me more of what this looked like? And was it organized? Did it feel organized or\ncrazy?",
        "A: No, it was not so organized, but I felt like gypsies are moving, such views we have seen\nbefore, but not so much. It was four kilometers, four miles we see moving and moving\nand going and going, and without an end. And people were looking in the streets. For me\nit was interesting how is their reaction. Pity or the opposite, so as I remember it was not\npity. If it was so it was only several, so I was very impressed by this, by remorse, not. It\nwas like raining, it should be rain, so everybody 1s going in this way.",
        "Q: Now, did you initially live in the small ghetto or the larger ghetto?",
        "A: I was in the beginning, living in the small ghetto at a small street called Shiluvos (ph).\nAnd it was right by the fence, by the fence. I can remember that every morning when I\narose, I could see the Lithuanian, so-called partisan, looking through the window, or\nthrough the fence to us, and some of our neighbors -- they put us together, it was lack of\nspace, they put several families together. His name was Beltz (ph). It was a Russian Jew,\nAlexander Beltz (ph), a very tall man, a strong man. So, he went to the soldier, the man\nwho guard, and began to talk to him, make a deal. \"Look, why not you can not bring us\nsome vegetables, something.\" I don't know what they did, but it was some of the people\nbegan to try to see, maybe it was a examination, what he's answering, because we were\nalso frightened of them. Some of them were shooting in the middle of the day, middle of\nthe night, shooting in the windows. Not, for nothing. It was their power and they could do\nwhat they want, when they want.",
        "Q: Who were you living with? What part of your family, all of your family?",
        "A: Yes, at this time, all of my family. With my father Hirshel, my mother Bluma, and my\nsister Batya or Basya. We were living together with this old pair. Old, maybe today I'm\nolder than he was, Mr. Alexander Beltz, and I remember that they were talking about\ntheir daughter. She escaped. \"Has she reached the Soviet's country or not?\" he says. \"Or\nnot?\" Probably she left with her finance or with her husband or with a boyfriend. Maybe\nhe was not Jewish. That I don't remember, but this was one of the things that people were\ntalking about in these times. Many of them come back -- come back after they were not\nallowed to come in the Soviet border. Or some were stopped by local gangs, bombers,\nsomething happened. So nobody -- we knew only who come back or who was killed on\nthe way, somebody watched him. But who reached, nobody knows. That I remember. We\nare talking about now as a father of children, I am very -- I understand it more, so if I\ncould not do, maybe my child will be saved, so it's also good feeling, that I remember this\nepisode. And it was door exits, same small building another door were living a big family\nabout twelve or fifteen people. It was not original family, but some survivors, relatives.\nTheir family was Grodnik (ph). Grodnik. I knew one of them, in my age more or less, his\nname was Baruch (ph), or and we called him Boroch (ph). Afterwards he come with me\nto the partisans and now he 1s living in -- near Aco (ph), Acres, in Israel. His father was,\nsome of his sisters, sister-in-law, many, many women. I understood that the males were\ntaken away before, or escaped to Russia. It happened in many families there. That\nalready, it was luck of males because also in the fortress, a very certain part of the women\nwere released, after what happened there. The biggest part of the males were shot there,\nor in the streets. Or they went away. So I think that most -- 1t was a very, very\ncharcteristic amount of a family, or so-called family. That many young women with one\nold man, the father of my friend, and him. And they were also from several places. Not\neverybody were from Kovno. They are moving, some of were coming from the small\nshtetl Kovno, maybe there is more safe. Others were going from Kovno to other shtetl,\nvillage, maybe there is more safe. And so on and so on. So, in Kovno what we could find\nit's people -- it was not the original population of Kovno. I would say that 20 percent\nwere newcomers or already refugees, from other shtetlach.",
        "Q: Can you talk about what the ghetto looked like? How -- were you -- was it very\nrestricted, could you go in and out?",
        "A: Inside the ghetto, yes. But, I remember that we have -- because it was the small ghetto\nwas very narrow and we avoid to go near the fence, so we made some holes between one\ncourt to another, or small entrance by putting out part of the fence between the court. And\nthat made us a possibility also to go at night, because at night it was prohibitted to go.\nYeah. I remember another thing, also from this house my mother sent me to one of my\nuncles, this Moses Levin, that maybe it's more safe there. And I remember that at night,\nin the evenings, all the people come together like meeting, like in a club and were are\ntalking, lighting a cigarette, and talking, talking, what they were talking? I remember a\nlady which was a year before in France and told how the French people received the\nGermans there, the German soldiers. Another told about his experience in the Soviet\nfactory -- before he was an employee in their store. And the Soviets come and told him,\n\"That's not an occupation for a young man, go to work in a factory.\" And he -- they were\nworking according numbers and who 1s making the number it's enough. I remember the\nresults.",
        "Q: How -- but you were allowed to meet in groups? The Germans weren't threatened by\nthat?",
        "A: No, the Germans didn't come in the ghetto usually. Only when they came that it was\nsomething, so everybody would hide in the town and not showing himself or trying to be\nvery small that nobody can watch you.",
        "Q: So, you were surrounded by fences but sometimes you made holes in the fences so that\nyou could move around a little?",
        "A: Yes, but from one house to another house, but not from the fence outside.",
        "Q: There were fences between the houses?",
        "A: Yes, like, it was a neighborhood of a suburb, many gardens, so there was a fence between\none garden and another, that was.",
        "Q: So, they tried prevent you from even communicating from your next door neighbor?",
        "A: No, they didn't. No.",
        "Q: Why a fence between every house? I'm confused.",
        "A: Yeah but before the war there were fences, natural fences, like you can see in each city,\nthat is a suburbs they are living like in a village, like a cultural village so everybody has\naround his house a fence.",
        "Q: Was there ever a way to get out of the ghetto, itself?",
        "A: Not, not, not at all. Even to go close to the fence, and now I'm talking about the fence\nwith, not iron, but how do you call it, with the needles --",
        "Q: An electric -- barbed wire?",
        "A: Not electric, no, no.",
        "Q: Barbed wire?",
        "A: Wire, yes, but not electric. Electric, this were afterwards, yeah. But it was enough\nbecause each ten or fifteen meters should stayed another partisan with a gun and only\nlooking for a victim. Yeah, but in order to go in the other side of the ghetto we have to\ncross the bridge and there also it was not convenient to do it because there were also a\nJewish policemen, so we were not afraid of him, but also a Lithuanian armed guy. So\nwhen we went to the other side of the ghetto, so according the small ghetto, it was a big\ncity.",
        "Q: And you couldn't go freely? I'm confused, you couldn't go freely to the large ghetto?",
        "A: We could, but it was not very convenient to meet this armed Lithuanian with a uniform of\nthe old Lithuanian army.",
        "Q: But he would let you through?",
        "A: Yes, but he could do everything, you know.",
        "Q: He could be temperamental?",
        "A: No, he could --",
        "Q: He could kill you if he felt ike it?",
        "A: Yes, to find a excuse to do it or without an excuse.",
        "Q: To do what?",
        "A: To shoot me, to beat me, to do me everything. So, I didn't, for me it was very difficult to\nlook at him even. So I avoid to meet them.",
        "Q: What about the organization within the ghetto, the sort of political structure?",
        "A: Political, eh...",
        "Q: Well, you had an administrative structure, maybe that's a better way. You had a Judenrat,\nyou had a Jewish police. Tell me a little bit about how these people got selected, who\nwere they? Who served in these capacities?",
        "A: I can tell you only what I have seen, in these times I have seen Jewish policemen, and I\nwas told -- so I remember that when we come to the ghetto it should be one or two days\nbefore the 15th of August 1941. We found already Jewish police there. Some of them\nwere occupied by helping to build the fence and some of them were also staying and\nworking some places, the lines. The lines of the stores. There were special stores for\nJewish people, already in the city of Kovno, so maybe they are moved to the ghetto.\nAnyway, there were certain places to deliver food, very small homes, very small at the\nbeginning of the ghetto. So, you can feel, I could feel that somebody is -- we knew that it\nis a committee so that we can feel that someone is taking care, or delivering food.\nSomebody has to do it. And also, the policemen are, they must have more higher degrees\nof commanders and so on, so we knew that it is a certain organization which is\nresponsible for the ghetto and this 100 percent Jewish. But we didn't know how much\nthey can decide, how long, how far. That we couldn't do. I remember that one day it was\nYom Kippur when many people were praying so we saw that from, he is coming a Jewish\nman, his name is Luria (ph), Luria, and he's telling, \"Look we know you are going to\npray. It's very important for you, maybe also for us, but what's more important is you\nhave stopped to do it and everybody who is 1n a certain age,\" he tell them, \"You have to\ncome and to work very, very urgent, because Germans demand I don't know how many\nthousands or so many Jewish workers for their war effort.\" Maybr he told us the\naerodromes (ph), the airports. \"And you have to do it, I'm sorry that I have to interrupt\nyou.\" So, he went from one to another, from one place to another and people really\nstopped pray except the old people or what the kids and went to the work. I don't know if\nthe Germans did it special for Yom Kippur or maybe for them it wasn't -- they did it from\ntheir point of view, but that's what happened. So we couldn't understand that this man,\neverybody shout, \"That's Luria,\" he was, before the war he was a judge. A judge it -- we\nhad not many Jewish judges in Lithuania, so maybe it was one or two, so he was very\nauthoritatic, he were talking in language of orders, explained very short, that 1s so, we\nunderstood that it's from the Committee. We called it a committee, the word Elderstrat\n(ph), we didn't knew yet, but bit by bit we knew it and we have to -- we came to see also\nthe house. It was in the middle of the ghetto, the big ghetto. It was a brown house, two\nfloors, but we didn't call not this Elderstrat, and not Judenrat, but the Commitet (ph), in\nYiddish. Comitet, it means committee. Even till the end. On the other hand, on their\nannouncements, the papers, it was signed Elderstrat or Chairman of the Elderstrat, so and\nso, or Secretary of the Elderstrat, so bit by bit we understand also this term, and I\nremember that in the house of the staff, 1t was two floors, in one room was a certain -- on\na door was hanging a certain announcement, Va'ad (ph) in Hebrew, Va'ad Ziknei\nHa'Eidah (ph), it's old name for the Eldest of Zion. So the eldest of the community it's a\nparaphrase, so in Yiddish Elderstart and also in German and maybe also in Lithuanian, I\nsaw it. So, bit by bit we knew that this was the same thing.",
        "Q: Did you know any of these people who formed the Consul of Elders or Committee?",
        "A: Yes, we knew it bit by bit. Nobody come and told us, \"You know, we have a committee\nfrom this day and so on and so on,\" but we knew, of course we knew Dr. Elkous, the\nname. We knew Yaakov Goldberg, we knew Rabbi Shmulker (ph) and maybe others\nknew more. I was only a youngster at this time, so for me it was enough also three or four\nnames, but I knew very much that they are having the rule inside the ghetto. They are\ndelivering places to work, or jobs, better places, worse places and in order to get a good\nplace, you must have what you could -- what you called protection. Protectzia (ph), of\nprotectzieh (ph), in Yiddish. It means to be protected or known by the people who are\ndelivering the works in order to get a better one.",
        "Q: How did you get protection?",
        "A: It's protection not in the word of a mafia, but if I know that one of the people is working\nin the office of work, Arbeitzampt (ph), or he was my teacher before or maybe a neighbor\nor maybe a friend or relative somehow, so go to him and ask him, \"Here I am, and it's\nvery hard for me to work in this lousy places. Please give me another one.\" And so, it\nhappened that some people were working very hard, some people less, and what's\nimportant that the people who were working hard even could not, or have the possibilities\nto buy something, or change food for clothes, or clothes for food. So, if bad is bad at all,\nif it's good, it's better at all -- more or less everything.",
        "Q: Now, some of the names you mentioned like Dr. Elkous, Mr. Goldberg, did you -- what\nwas your feeling about these people? Did you feel they were taking good care of you?\nDid you feel that because they were having to answer to the Nazis that maybe they\nweren't so good? What was your attitude about this committee and about the Jewish\npolice also?",
        "A: When we are talking in the beginning of the ghetto, we feel that we are together in one\nbad position, and we didn't know what we knew afterwards. So, maybe who didn't get a\ngood job were more opposed, and the others was more pro, but we didn't know that we\ncan expect critical, or vital decisions from the Committee, or the Elderstrat. They can\nonly execute orders, this time.",
        "Q: Do you remember what you -- did you have an opinion of them at the time? Did you\nthink they were helping you? Did you trust them?",
        "A: More than the opposite.",
        "Q: Did you know any of them personally, other than just knowing their name?",
        "A: No, I didn't know any of them, nobody.",
        "Q: Now, you were living in the small ghetto, and very early in the life of the ghetto, the\nsmall ghetto was liquidated, correct? Where were you and can you tell me what\nhappened?",
        "A: Yes, it was called also aktzion, not the first one. So, we were told to move in a certain\ndirection and it was to where the big ghetto, the Great Ghetto, and at a certain place they\nmade a selection. I don't remember where, probably at the bridge. I don't -- that I don't\nremember, because I was in such situations I -- when I cannot help myself I become very\nintroverted, introverted, till now. But when I decide to do something this other thing. So I\ncannot remember. I remember only one thing, that we moved everybody, all four\nfamilies, four of my family, we crossed the ghetto together with my friend Bora Grodnik\n(ph). He was very upset because he left -- he lost his father. His father was with a beard,\nelderly man, maybe also younger than me today, he lost him and he understood what is\nthe meaning of losing. So he was very upset, but kept himself. And when we crossed on\nthe other side of the ghetto, we come in in the first house of the street on the other side\nand come into a Jewish family to rest or something, or to -- I don't know. They leave,\nthey left -- they allowed us to come in. Maybe somebody -- they gave us maybe water or\ntea, I don't remember, something. I remember even the name. The name was Sefer (ph),\nSefer. The head of the family was a policeman. But it was done like solidarity of Jewish\npeople. \"Something happened, come in, live, relax,\" and so on. After this, I don't\nremember how we found another flat, apartment. That I don't know, but I know that after\nwe were put in another house of the street, Linkura (ph) or Linkuvos (h), yeah, number\n56 together with other families in a wooden house. The house is still staying, one floor, a\nwooden house, and there was our house all the time that the whole family were living\ntogether in the ghetto.",
        "Q: It must have been crowded?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Many families together and at least we got -- yes we got one room and a half\nof a kitchen together with a family of three men. I forgot now their names. They came\nfrom Memille (ph), and they were talking between them German. We knew them before\nbecause when my father used to go to this area of Memille-Gebeit (ph), it means the\nGerman part of Lithuania. He was staying in a hotel called Shvartze Adler (ph), the Black\nEagle, so he was one of the owners, his wife and a small child. The relations were not\ngood. It beacuse first the kitchen, afterwards also the mess -- we didn't become friends.\nAnd they were living with us until the big action in October 28. And the night after they\ndidn't come back, so we earned, earned their place so now we had one room, a small\nroom, but only we, and more than half kitchen, I think, two thirds of a kitchen. Yes.\nDavidowitz maybe was their name.",
        "Q: Did you -- when you were forced out of the small ghetto, when you were forced out of\nthe small ghetto, I know that the hospital was burned. Were you aware of this? Could you\nsee this? What was happening?",
        "A: I saw this but I didn't believe.",
        "Q: Tell me what you saw.",
        "A: I saw a smoke. It was at the same time when all the Jewish from the Small ghetto were\ntaken to a big piatza (ph), or place. And after staying there half a day, we were all\nreleased to go home. It was cold in the ghetto. That -- it was like it's a repetition of\naction. Repetition, yes? Repetiton. It means to try how it works and there were many\nrumors why the Council did this action, or maybe, I don't know. Anyway, this time we\ncome back we have seen a big smoke, and there was a rumor that this was hospital. But I\ncould not -- I couldn't understand that somebody is going to burn -- we didn't heard any\nvoices. I remember even now them -- two floors, the color, it was yellow or white, or\ncream white of the -- of this building. So, there were rumors afterwards I heard they were\nburned and everything, but at the beginning I didn't want not to believe, because there\nwere many rumors, and certain types of the rumors were not true. So, I also didn't receive\nthis rumor, so I was not very much touched of this, what I have seen, smoke is smoke.\nOnly afterwards I was told and we also get the detailed information, but it took us several\ndays.",
        "Q: So, what had happened?",
        "A: Nothing, nothing happened.",
        "Q: I mean, what was burning? I need you to tell me. Were there people?",
        "A: It was a hospital. I don't know if the staff or the part of the staff and probably all of the\npatients including children were burned there. That I -- maybe I heard this the same day,\nbut I think that I didn't believe, maybe also it's my nature to escape from the reality.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Where we stopped, you are now living in the large ghetto, and I know you were there for\na while. What was life like there? Was there any semblance of normal activity? How --\ndid kids go to school? Did you observe Jewish holidays? Were people working? What\nwas going on?",
        "A: I was living after we were expelled from the small ghetto, in what we call the Great\nGhetto, it wasn't so great, but, I think we were about -- I was two and half years, two\nyears, or two years -- two and half years, yes. So, in the two and a half years in ghetto,\nwhat we call now the Big Ghetto -- at the beginning I remember that we when we have\nleisure time, and we have some after the work, or it was a time I should not to go to work,\nbecause I was not 17 years. So, I found a certificate from my high school with a picture\nof me that I was born this and this year, this and this month. It means 27 of January 1925,\nit means that till 27th January 1942, I have not to go to work, because it was the\nbeginning --17 years is the beginning of the first work. So, sometimes I did, I went to\nwork instead of other people who paid me. And such arrangement was called, I don't\nknow why, a malach (ph). A malach, it's in Hebrew or Yiddish, angel, and I was told that\nit was used during the period of the Czars that people were afterward with the Army and\nothers could replace them for money, so I did it, and so I could help a little bit my family,\nmyself.",
        "Q: What kind of work?",
        "A: Oh, work, usually very hard work, field work, or buildings, and we have to under the sky\n-- it means outside the houses, 1t was winter. We were not -- it was very not convenient,\nunconvinient is also, I wouldn't say the whole truth, in water, in raining, in snowing, in\ncold, and not eaten. We were very hungry all the time, to be in the fresh air, young men,\nso it was no good. So, anyway, to coming back to your first question, several times we\nwent when I had time to go around the ghetto -- not around but in the center -- like to\nmaking a walk with friends or girlfriends. So, some places in the ghetto became like a\npromenade . And as I remember it was around the building of the Elderstrat, or the\nComitet. Why? Because there come many people to -- for their business. To get another\njob, or to move in another house, or to ask for protection, so people met many people\nthere. It was a concentration of people, a big crowd. Some of them were talking politics\nand they were asking for news or talking -- telling or listening for rumors, and there were\nmany, many rumors, good and bad. So, it was a place to coming and I remember also in\nthis times people like to be dressed also well. Not as the time when they went to work, so\nthe impression was that people like to be normal as they can. I remember also during\nthese times it was the beginning of people who were selling some candies, some other\nthings, homemade or other, and that was the beginning of a bigger production of such\nthings in the ghetto. No, the beginning was cigarettes, people need cigarettes, especially\nin such a time of tension. I think that also I begin to smoke. It was a need, or a fashion, I\ndon't remember well. Anyway, we tried to be more and more -- like to be normal. In\nthese times I began also to keep a diary. The beginning I was writing the headline \"Divrei\nHa'Yamim\" (ph). Divre1 Ha'Yamim, its means the events of the days. There is also in the\nBible there is such a name of -- Chronicles it's called or something, so I -- the first I did\nnote all the events was happened with us, with our family, or with the people of the small\nghetto from the beginning of the war till now, and I put also daydreams. I don't remember\nabout school, maybe it was a school, maybe not, because I was in high school, and high\nschool anyway was not in ghetto, but I heard that there are people who are -- not people\nbut youngsters, younger than me, they are attending to schools, and I am not missing too\nmuch because I was -- according for my age I have not to go to school. So I was -- I\nshould be at the age between school and college, let's say. That's it. But on your question,\non the spirit of your question, I remember that people liked and also me, to be nice\ndressed more or less when you came outside the house. Even we were in the middle of\natrocities. That I remember.",
        "Q: Would -- when you say you tried to make life normal, what other ways? What other\nthings did you do so that you'd feel that in the in the midst of all this you still had some\nenjoyment, or some control of your lives?",
        "A: Oh, the control of our lives, that was to eat, to eat on the table, even though it hungry to\nuse a knife and a spoon, and a thing what we had to. And you greet people on the street,\nand behave more or less as free people, not as prisoners. Because prisoners have to go on\nthe right side of the street, and we had also to greet the German soldiers and of course the\nofficers. So we -- and even to make nice our stars that we have to wore on -- here and on\nthe back, in the same place on the back. So, I remember that people had made it from\nyellow paper but some did it very nice on all their robes, some of silken and some made it\neither nice form, bit by bit, so it was a steady form. Afterwards, the Germans decided\nshoul be very uniformal, that you cannot do what you want, it should be a special size\nand so on, but that I remember the trend, to do what we can.",
        "Q: To maintain dignity?",
        "A: Yes. I don't know -- dignity, this I don't know nobody thinking, but normal.",
        "Q: No, but you're talking about people taking some -- instead of just putting any yellow star\non, that they attempted to personalize it?",
        "A: Yes, as part of their guardaroba (ph), I would say.",
        "Q: What other things did you do to pretend this is a normal life? What did you enjoy? Was\nthere music? Did you have a social life?",
        "A: Yes. The social life was to meet old friends from the class, or from the youth movements,\nor new girls and from time to time there were also parties. Some people were keeping\npatiphones. Patiphones its means records or the aparatus. And dancing or singing or --\nand also they worked up this new pairs, from a young boy and a young girl, or it was a\ncontinuation from before the ghetto, or they are beginning a newer one. So --",
        "Q: Did you have a girlfriend at the time?",
        "A: Not yet, after that. I have some. I would say all, or a big part of my sister's girlfriends\nwere very close to me. Same company more or less. After that I had another one till the\nend of the ghetto, and when I went to the forests, in the end of -- when was it? The end of\n1944, in March, I gave her to keep my diary. And till now, I don't know what happened\nto it. Maybe one day it can be found.",
        "Q: Were there regular aktzions in the ghetto?",
        "A: Regular?",
        "Q: Did you normally feel safe, or --",
        "A: Till the big action, or the Great Action which occurred 28th of October 1941, so were\nmany, so nobody was sure what would happen the evening. I remember that this time, I\nremember this chapter 1n the Bible that it will be a time when in the morning you wish it\nto be evening and evening morning. That I remember. Yeah. I was thinking about this\nsentence. But after the big action, so life become more stable and there were no more\nsuch horrible actions, there were deportations. Deportations it's very inconvenient, very\nbad, maybe for hard work. It's not -- it was not surely for deaths. Many people died there,\nbut it happened not direct. So what I was afraid is to be caught to dirty walk. Dirty it's\nmeans not dirty aesthetical, but in a bad place of a walk. For instance, on the aerodrome,\nairport. So there you are walking hard, many hours you have to go, I would say maybe\nfive miles each side by foot, and you have to go and sometime to run because it's a very\nlong, Cologne is going on the way, and some are going fast and some not so. The\nGermans who are watching press that we have to make altogether to go. And what I\ndidn't like was to go and to see the people on the streets. They were so happy I would say\nor glad, how we are looking and then we were looking bad, very bad.",
        "Q: The Lithuanian people?",
        "A: Yes, there was about 90 percent of Kovno. Maybe some were Polish, I don't know. But\nthe man in the street. That I could not stand. With the Germans we knew before that that\nis, we were expecting more or less a bad relation. But the others with whom we grew up\ntogether. So, that was terrible for me, and I -- certain time I worked inside the ghetto as a\nhelper of a craftsman in the internal fac -- it wasn't a factory, but a workshop, a\nworkshop. So, he was a very old Ocarpenter, this man, and we heard about him even\nbefore. He was running a factory of furniture, he and his family, so I become his second\nor third driver, assistant. He was not very happy about me because I have -- at this time\nmy hands were not the best and when I have to do something, so I made it not in the best\nway. Anyway, I worked beyond a roof, it was winter so it was not so bad and it was\nwarm there because we took the rest of the wood and put it the stove. At home, it was\nworse. At home we had no wood enough, so sometimes we could -- we took the fences\nfrom around the house and put this in the oven or even furnitures. After they were\nfinished, so I prepared to go outside the house all the time, what I can, and only to come\nin the afternoon, later afternoon, then to have my meal, what's the meal was usually a\nsoup, each time a soup. In this soup they took everything they could, my mother, 1n our\nhouse it was pieces of bread, potatoes, some grasses, of course water, put together with a\nlittle salt and that was the dinner, so-called dinner. After the dinner we went to other\nhouses to listen to songs. Or in certain time, I began to take part in the meetings of a new\nstage of the underground, of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair. It was not far from my house, and that\nwas also a turning point for me. The beginning we were talking of every kind of\nsocialism, democratic socialism, or radical socialism, theoretical things, and what we\nhave to do after the war and what is the best way to become democratic, or undemocratic,\nmany theoretical things. I remember that I prepared also a paper that say of one guy,\nFranz Oppenheimer (ph). Franz Oppenheimer. He was a sociologist. So, I brought it and\nread it or talked it to my other friends, the of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and I\nremember I was shouting, \"Yes I can see immediately that it's not -- it was anti-socialist,\nthis man.\" He was probably a social democrat or something so it was not good for\nHa'Shomer Ha'Tzair that they were still very left. But one day or night, come to me one\nof the friends of the people there, Gita Poger, and she told me, \"I would like to talk to you\nvery secretly. You know we are meeting here, we are talking about political theories.\nThat was good for before war, now we have to do something else. What does it mean? I\nwill not say you but somebody will talk to you and you have to keep it very secretly. Not\nto tell even not your father, not your mother, not your sister.\" I promised. Another time\ncome to me somebody, it was her, and with another girl and she told me, \"Now we there\nwill be a cell. I am the commander of the cell and you the both, the two, are members. I\nwill give you orders and you have to fullfill 1t and also not to -- even if you are thinking\nof another of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair is also involved in these things, you have not to talk\nwith them about this.\" So every time she come with new orders. One day she come and\ndemand that you have to bring her many empty bottles, and here and there and other\nthings. And what was the most dramatical thing that one day she comes with part of a\nrifle. I don't know what it is in English, but it's the part of that -- the shooting part before\nyou have to push it and pull it and everything. I forgot the English name, because I was\nnever a English soldier. So it was -- and she brought it in an old newspaper. It was very\ndangerous, you know, that if for a piece of jewelry, jewel, you could be arrested and shot,\nso that was even dangerous not only for me but for the whole neighborhood. That I\nremember till today and I am meeting her all the time and I remember, \"You, you was my\nhero. I was admiring you how you are doing this.\" And bit by bit we also have lessons\ntelling you how to shoot, only theoretical and topography and about first aid, how to give,\nand how to make estimations of distances and a little Judo and many things. Until we\nheard that the Wilno Ghetto is liquidated and then we also had also newspapers written\nby hand that -- I remember that some of the words was the order of the U.P.O., the\nUnited Partisans Organization in Wilno, or the first proclamation or the other, it was\nincluded in our newspaper. So, it was very, very important for me, for us, to hear such\nthings. If they can do it, maybe we can do it also. So, we were very encouraged from this.\nYou must understand that nobody know -- we were closed like in a zoo. And here 1s\nsomething talking about, resistance, really resistance, not only to sing songs and\nencourage each other. So, it was very important to us and didn't tell no to nobody.",
        "Q: I want to ask you a few questions. You mentioned that you were taught various things,\nabout first aid or topography or theoretically how to shoot. Who taught you?",
        "A: Everybody \"she.\" This nice girl.",
        "Q: So the women were very involved in these underground activities?",
        "A: She brought it from others.",
        "Q: But it was -- but were men and women equally involved in all of this?",
        "A: Yes, yes, of course.",
        "Q: I want you to say that.",
        "A: The fact is that in the population of the ghetto, in our neighborhood, in our house, also in\nthe organization and the most of the members were not males, but females, girls. Yeah,\ngirls, they were very young, so we can call them girls. So, it was very natural that in such\na cell there was one man, if I am, I hope, with two girls. And I didn't ask questions why.\nIt didn't matter me. She's my major in this thing and I have very willingly to do all of this,\nher orders.",
        "Q: You don't know how she learned how to --",
        "A: No, I didn't ask. No.",
        "Q: I'm wondering if the Jewish police in the ghetto gave any assistance to your\norganizations?",
        "A: Yes, the Jewish police did it, but I don't remember in which stage. I know, but not -- I\ndon't remember, those are two things. It was at time for instance in 26th of October 1943,\nfor me it was a critical day, because I lost my family this days. It was deportation to\nEstonia. At that morning, I -- the ghetto was closed. Nobody went to work outside the\nghetto and I got mission, a certain mission to go in another place, to say a parole, a\ncertain parole, I think that I remember the parole, and they sent me again in another\nplace. When they sent me, it was the beginning already of the deportation. And when I\npassed my home, my building where we were living, our residence, I saw that a truck\nstaying near the house and Jewish police and others, I don't remember who, maybe\nLithuanian, or Estonian, or German are coming to take my family. I was passing very\nclose let's say about ten, fifteen meters. They have seen me, I have seen them. My sister\nwas very crying, very crying. My father was saying, in a position, or 1n a stride,\n\"Everything 1s lost.\" He saw me and made such (gesturing). He didn't say it, but, \"What\nwe can do?\" Only my mother she make me a strong wink with her eye. It means, \"Go\naway!\" and that was very, very important for me because yesterday the 26th of October\nwas 51 years after this day, and I was thinking if she would not do it, maybe I would\nbecome again a good son and join the family where they are going. Because I didn't\nexpect that they will be taken, and why? Because several days before, this my\ncommander come to me and asking me, \"I would like to know the names of your father,\nyour mother, and your sister and others in your family and the name of the identity cards,\nnumber,\" and so on. Maybe she told me or I understood that the families of the\nunderground people will be defended. So, when I saw that also they are taking I was\nshocked. I was shocked, shocked twice, so maybe this agreement that maybe was done\nwith the Elderstrat, with the authorities through the ghetto, didn't work, or maybe another\nthing, so that's a puncture. To think that my family they are taken so what makes the\ndecision for me to go further, was this movement by the eye, a wink to the eye of my\nmother, that mother, Bluma Levin, born in Wigoda. She did it and it give me a motivation\nto go farther and even not to look back. So, I went to the place I have to go. It was in a\ncertain building. It was called Blocktzai (ph), means Blocktzey (ph). And there I had to\nsay a certain parole. \"I want\" -- the parole was, \"I want to sleep here at night.\" In Yiddish\nit (speaking Yiddish), so the answer was, I don't remember, but now I'm coming to the\nyour main question, I put it already together that in this day -- before this house was\nstaying a policeman, his name was Daniel Billard (ph). He was a known policeman\nbecause before the war he was a very known box-man. Maybe he asking me the question\nor another man, so then I realized that the police or at least a part of the police is working\nin cooperation with the -- with the underground. That makes me also a good feeling. And\nafterwards, I was told to go to the cellar. I went -- a cellar. After I come to the cellar, they\nopened a door on the ground -- no the ground was with ashes or something or small\nstones. So, somebody took away the stones and told me to, \"Go there.\" I fell. I think that I\nfell. So, I remember that some hands catched me and pulled me down and what it was\ndark, dark, very dark. I can only fell --only see some fires of cigarettes. Very in silence,\nevery half an hour was an order, move here, move there, or who wants to eat, who wants\nto go to the toilets. I don't know which -- I don't remember which arrangements they\nmade. Who wants to smoke, who wants drink. One like with a chain. I am telling them\nand he is telling the other and so on and so on and a certain moment we felt that a noise,\nanoise, and somebody knocking on the iron cover of the cellar, \"Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta,\" and\npeople are calling and answering, maybe they are going to catch us and somebody telled\nthem. They are still looking for people for deportation because in this day, many were\nhiding with me, but we made it an organized form. So, I felt myself better. I don't\nremember if somebody had arms or not, but I felt so secure and so good that somebody 1s\ntaking care on me. And really, after a few minutes, everything settled maybe and silent\nagain. We were not -- I don't know because I don't remember if I looked of -- in my\nwatch. I have yet my watch. My watch that I get -- I received as a bar mitzvah. And when\nwe had to come out it was already evening. In October the evening began early like now.\nAnd we were told that now everybody is going for a while with family, \"You are free but\nyou have to come back very soon. Maybe this night we are leaving the ghetto.\" Leaving\nthe ghetto, it means to the forest. I become again very happy. So, I went to home, home\nwas empty without people, without my parents, without my sister, nothing. And I have\nseen that some -- the neighbors, next door neighbors of my family by the name of Feen\n(ph) they were very surprised to see me, \"How come you back?\" because they were sure\nif my family was taken so also me. And they gave me some to eat and to drink. We were\nnot in the best relations, but now we become very close. But I realize that many things\nare not in the same place, so maybe my family took it, or maybe they took it, I don't\nknow. But it was for me -- I didn't care because if I are leaving the ghetto this night it's\nfor me all the same, and I took some sandwiches they gave me. I didn't tell them, but I\ntold them that I will not more live here in this place. I'm going away. Maybe they\nunderstood, maybe not. And when I come back to the place of concentration, 1t was in\nanother hiding place on Stesbolyu (ph) so we were told that this night nothing will\nhappened and we have to stay. We have to stay, so we decide to not to go more home.\nBecause what's home? Home without parents is no home, or sister, no home. So, I was\nnot the only one who was in such a situation. There were more, three, four, five, six. I\ndon't remember. So, we stayed in the same place and we sleep in the same place. We\nmade arrangements to sleep. It was not in a cellar but under a roof of a small building.\nSo, it was space for everybody and actually this was the beginning of a collective or a\nkibbutz, if you want, of a part of a members of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair and the others.\nCollective or kibbutz I don't remember the name but that was the reality.",
        "Q: Now you said there was just a handful of you there? I'm trying to get a sense of how\nmany people were together at this point?",
        "A: I think 25 but not everybody were left without parents. Some of them prepared to be there\ntogether. You know, the feeling to be together it make also the people stronger. Together,\ntogether, only to be, to be. Now only some hours ago we were saved together, now we\nwill live together. Maybe we will have to go to the forest together. Nobody knows.",
        "Q: I just want to go back to one thing that you said when you learned that the policeman was\naware of all of the -- or was aware of some of the activities and probably was helping.\nWhat was -- do you remember the question he asked you? What tipped you off?",
        "A: I didn't get your question.",
        "Q: You said there was a point after your family was taken away where Jewish policemen\nasked you a question and that indicated to you that he knew about your activities.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: What was his question?",
        "A: What do you need? It was a part of the parole, 1t was a question and a answer. More or\nless, what do you need? I told him I --.",
        "Q: If you could just start over and say the policeman asked me, because my question will bw\nedited.",
        "A: The policeman was a uniformed policeman asked me a question that probably it was a\npart of the parole, the first part, \"What do you need?\" So my answer was, \"I need here to\nfind a place for sleep this night.\" In Yiddish it sounds other (speaking Yiddish), or\n(speaking Yiddish). So then, he understood and he showed me where to go in the cellar.\nYeah. And afterwards, there was many such cases that an open cooperation between the\npolicemen and the organization, but sometimes this policeman also to fulfill orders for\nthe Judenrat, for the Elderstrat in order to deport people and so on. The policeman who\ntook part of expelling or of deporting my family, I remember very good, because\nafterwards he was also a part of our organization. It was not in the middle of the\norganization, but he used to come to our kibbutz, what we called, and I told him, \"You\nknow you are the man that took my family.\" So he told me, \"Oh, why didn't you didn't\nsay that?\" I'm not sure that if I would say him thats could help but what happened to him,\nhe also perished afterwards.",
        "Q: Do you know of any other examples of police helping or the Judenrst helping the\nunderground organizations? Other ways?",
        "A: I know many, but I remember very, very significant thing. When I have to leave -- not\nwhen I have, when I was allotted to leave the ghetto with all the ammunition and\neverything, at March 1944 at night through the gate of the ghetto, so at the gate of the\nghetto were some people who were staying there all the time, all the -- even before and\nafter, including they were some policemen, and they knew we were not going as it was\nreported by one of us that we are going outside like a team of work in the woods, but we\nare going to fight with partisans. At this moment I saw also that these tremendous\ncooperations and the one moment the lights, it was electric were off. It was very dark, so\neven the German soldier or watchman could see something so it happens so that the\nconditions become very bad for realize who is who. And that was done with a policeman\nthere. Maybe there were more than one. Not only policeman, but also some officers of\nthe Judenrat or Elderstrat. They were staying day and night at the gate and controlling the\npeople who come to work and again and back, especially the people from Arbeitzant\n(ph), it was a work department. So, that I was sure -- so that I also saw, not that I only\nknew. Probably I was -- I knew about this before, 1t were rumors that somebody is going\nto help us and they had helping. We knew this, but here I saw myself.",
        "Q: It must have been very encouraging?",
        "A: Yes. No, but I was very encouraged. I didn't think too much of this. I was one step\noutside to the ghetto to the forest, so it's like going from the hell to paradise.",
        "Q: I want to ask you a couple more questions and then I want to hear about your escape and\nyour life in the forest. Did you have -- within the ghetto, did you have any special\nassignments or roles within the underground movement? Were there certain things that\nyou had to do, to perform?",
        "A: Not something. I was a private.",
        "Q: But did you deliver messages, did you go and get supplies?",
        "A: Yes, so that was very natural everything I did -- even I didn't remember them. But what I\nremember that I took all this very, very, very seriously to fill out well done job because\nit's a holy thing and I am devoted for this. Yes -- I was thinking that after all this, no --\nthis organization belongs, maybe everybody belongs to this organization and there\nsomewhere 1s sitting general staff, with maps and everybody's giving orders and they\nknew much better than me so I only have to full fill.",
        "Q: But what were the orders that you followed? What did you do?",
        "A: What I have done, I remember I brought bottles, another day I brought also to bring\nmoney. Bring money.",
        "Q: From where?",
        "A: So I tried to sell something from a house and instead to buy bread or other food, I give it.\nOr to go from one place to another place, or maybe to also steal some things for this\norganization. I remember now, lamps, electrical lamps, even used, they told to collect\nthem and I knew that it's for make small bombs or grenades, primitive. Such things.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you kept a diary. Do you think a lot of other people at this time were\nkeeping diaries?",
        "A: If you're asking me if I think, no.",
        "Q: You know?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: At the time were you aware of --.",
        "A: At the time I didn't know. Nobody told me because people doesn't -- didn't tell too much\nbecause that can be -- that can be dangerous for somebody if it would be found, nobody\nknows if it's good for him or for his family and maybe it's also not good because now his\nfamily will know -- so, no, it was very, very privately.",
        "Q: Now you know, I mean, I've looked through the Kovno ghetto diary by Mr. Torey, were a\nlot of other people keeping diaries as well?",
        "A: Yes, a lot. For him it was very easy because he --.",
        "Q: I need you to say Avraham Tory.",
        "A: Avraham Tory, that his former last name was Golup (ph) and he was the secretary of the\nJudenrat or Elderstrat, according my knowledge, for him it was very easy to keep a diary\nfor one side many, many information and also documents. He had sometimes only to\ncopy them in the -- put in his diary. On the other side he should have had more places to\nhide them because everybody knows that he's writing and that it was for his daily work,\nso he had not to be so keeping in silence because nobody would interfere with him.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: If you can just very briefly repeat to me what it was that the Jewish policeman said to you\nthat indicated he knew what was going on so that I understand that word parole.",
        "A: So change the word parole and password.",
        "Q: You can say parole or password, but I need you to begin by saying the policeman. It's a\nfull sentence.",
        "A: So, the policeman who were a very close to the entrance on their Block C or Block Tze\n(ph) as we called it, I knew him before. I knew even his name. His name was Daniel\nBillard (ph) and his question was (speaking Yiddish), 1t means, what do you need here? I\nunderstood I knew it before that this is the beginning of a password, we called it parole.\nSo, the answer on this password, or the parole was, \"We have -- we get here or we have\nhere to sleep this night.\" In Yiddish it sounds (speaking Yiddish) mir or I, I don't\nremember well, anyway to sleep here, so he was satisfied because this was the true parole\nand he let me in to come and maybe show me also the way to go inside or in the cellar\nthat I don't remember very good but afterwards somebody opened a cover on the ground\nand they also to put away the stones that were under this cover and I felt that I am falling\ndown, down, down, until several hands caught me and they bring me to a place to a\ncertain room. It was dark there, that what I remember.",
        "Q: The other question I have is, I assume there were also Communists cells or other groups\nand I'm wondering if you -- the different groups worked together or if they had separate\nresponsibilities in terms of helping people get supplies or get out of the ghetto. Do you\nknow -- what did you know about that at the time?",
        "A: At that time, we knew that we are not the only, that the other groups were organized. We\ncalled them several names one name was the Communist or the Mushtas (ph), because of\nJoe Stalin. Ofdevantzes (ph), or Coatkes (ph), Coatkes means short jackets, overjackets,\ncoats, but short. But we knew that they doesn't belong to us, they belong to the left-left\nand some of them we knew even before the ghetto. Some change their places, come from\nthe Zionists to the Communists and why? Because as we understood, they are more than\nwe. They are a lot. And one of them it was very known his name was Chaim Yellin (ph).\nHe was a very known figure even in all the ghetto, even outside the organization. We\nknew also or maybe we had the feeling that they has the best connections outside with the\npartisans and probably I was told, probably it was my feeling, but we knew that they are\nthe prominent people in the organization or their organization 1s more important than\nours in the terms of communication with outside. We knew the partisans can be only\nSoviet partisans because other partisans will not deal with us. And if Soviet partisans, it's\nCommunists, so again, so they felt themselves very strong in the ghetto even to be a\nCommunist in this time was very dangerous for the Germans and for the Lithuanians\nbecause several times they were looking after such people in order to arrest them and to\nkill them. But in the ghetto it was like in autonomy everybody could -- it was like a big\nshelter in terms of politics. So, they felt themselves very good and very secure. Even\nmore when we had to go to the forest, so it was a rumor between us that they are having a\npreference to go and also their girls, or girlfriends, or wives will get a better -- a better\nposition, or they had not to wait so long as our girls. And I will not forget one thing that\none of our girls, were organized in Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzai, we were living this time already\nin a communa, in the collective, it was -- the name was Mildos (ph) 7, because the street\nwas Mildos and the number of the house was 7. So it was called Milda 7 everybody, not\neverybody, but many knew that that belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair. The Communists\nhave also their house not far from us and also ABC, Abetze (ph) Irgun L'Tzion (ph) has\ntheir house. So, the developments of all the houses was similar. People were alone\nwithout parents, without families, decide to live together and it was also convenient for\nthe organization. Everybody can catch all his -- all their members at one time and they\nhave control and they can also hide their arms and make training with arms, so it was\ngood for everybody. So, I'm coming back to one of our girls which belonged to\nHa'Shomer Ha'Tzair, her name was Rosa, Rosa. She was already taken to the gate in\norder to be included in a group -- I don't remember the number of the group -- going by\ntruck to the forest. She was taken away at the last moment, and instead her was put in a\ngirl of the -- what we called them Communist and they are calling no or even the ghetto\nthey have a cover name. It was called Anti-Facists Fight Organizations. So, they have a\npreference and when we come, I come to the forest I found a lot of people who belonged\nto their organizations and of -- from us were only I think eleven or twelve with one, only\none girl. For girls 1t was generally more difficult. It's because the high command of the\npartisans is Ruditsky, or Rudniky for us, demand they give preference for men, male\ngood who trained not with revolvers but with long rifles, long rifles mean long arms and\nbetter males than females. The ghetto organization had another pressure to do what they\ndemand. So, it all the time were compromise, here, there. Anyway, the last decision that -\n- the factor let's say, was that most of the girls, Jewish girls and these detachments, and I\nam talking about the detachments, Kovno detatchments in the Ruditsky Forest which was\ncalled this to the German occupants that most of the girl did belong before to the\nCommunist circles or what was called Anti-Facist Fighter Organizations, that is.",
        "Q: Were the non-Communists organizations more effective with working with the Jewish\ncommunity in terms of getting supplies or hiding spaces or money or anything than the\nanti-facist organizations.",
        "A: The Zionist organizations, and there are several, one of them it was very big, it was --",
        "Q: What about the Zionist organizations in the ghetto?",
        "A: The Zionist organizations, and I am talking mostly about their underground organizations\nbecause there were many organizations like parties, but they belong to more adult people,\nbut talking about the youth movements, the Zionist youth movements of -- in the Kovno\nGhetto, we are talking about three main organizations. It Irgun Brei Tzion (ph),\norganization of bright young braves, any way now we would call them general Zionist. It\nincluded also religious Zionists, liberal Zionists and so on, that's one. The other was what\nI mentioned before Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair with the time where we\ncoordinated with Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair, or Dror (ph). It was more or less also ideological\nvery close. So they afterwards established the collective of the kibbutz together. What I\nmentioned Mildos Sheva (ph), Mildos 7 was together. I would call it in one word the --as\nit means the labor camp of the Zionists.",
        "Q: I need to understand something. What you're telling me is that most of the underground\nin the ghetto was young people?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: What about people who were 30 years old?",
        "A: Thirty year old, they're very on the border.",
        "Q: Will you say just as a complete sentence that the underground in the Kovno Ghetto was\nyoung people, if you can just make a statement like that and then continue.",
        "A: Continue, or come back to describe -- maybe it's too complicated what I'm talking about.",
        "Q: I think what you can is that the underground -- because I don't think people know this --\nwas really young people and that if you then kind of go and say the Zionist organizations\nmaybe had better cooperation with the community, or I don't know.",
        "A: I am coming to this, but first of all, it's important to describe who they are, who they\nwere. So, we are talking about underground in Kovno Ghetto, maybe also other\nghettos,we are talking mostly about young people. Young people it means maybe from\n15, 16 till 30. If they were more,they were exeptions. And I will tell you who were the\nZionists. They were divided into three or four groups. They were the general Zionists and\nthe organization was called Abetze, Irgun Brei Tzion (ph). In this organization were also\nincluded some of religious Zionists, Bnei Akiva (ph). After -- the other was Ha'Shomer\nHa'Tzair, and they with a time unified with the Dror or Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair. It also left\nworkers' organization. They were very, very close ideologically, and they established the\ncollective or the kibbutz called Mildos Sheva (ph), Mildos 7. Sheva, it means seven in\nHebrew. We used very much to talk Hebrew also in the ghetto. Therefore I am\nmentioning sheva, so it's important; it reminds me. The other group was Beitar. Beitar\nand other people were incorporated in this ideology that's three. And probably we can\nalso include to this organizations Brit Tzion (ph), were adult people let's say from 30 till\n60 or more. It was an organization who helped the Abetze, who were young people. So, if\ntalking about young people about the really underground organization who were prepared\nto do more or less everything then we are talking about organizations. The ABC, Abetze,\nnot ABC, Irgun Brei Tzion, Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair and Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and Beitar --\nthey were very involved in the life of the ghetto because their establishment of the ghetto\nwas also Zionist. If you will take Dr. Elkous and his deputy of the Elderstrat, Leib\nGarfunkel (ph) and the others were former activists or top members or leaders of the\nZionist organizations in Kovno before the war. So, it happen so also the staff of the\nElderstrat in all of officer were sitting people more Zionists than all the others. So that it\nwas natural that they could help with many things their organization, the underground\norganization, with money, with means, with transportation, and what's most important,\nwith covering them. I mean, the police. The Jewish Ghetto Police. I remember that our\norganization, also we sent some of our members to be organized in the police in order\nthat they can help us, they can tell us what is going and so on and so on. Even there was\none, two, or four people who belong to the Communist organization who also sent to\nserve in the police, in the Jewish Police in the ghetto. Anyway, the partition of work\nbecame so, or it happened without our planning so our planning was the Zionist\norganization were more active in the ghetto because they are close to the Elderstrat, they\nknow many things they can get help on the other side. The Communist, the Anti-Facist\nFight Organization they have very good connections with the outside, with the partisans,\nwith the Communists outside the ghetto. And so it was a very good combinations\nbetween the two big parts, contra parts of one big organization with that they should have\none roof in a certain place it was called, in a certain time it was called the MTC it means\nMilitary Technical Commission.",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: Oh, it was in 1943, in this time when the topic of going to the forest was very, very -- had\nbecome very hot. So, it was natural and it was also coordination between the two big\nparts. It was a coordination until a certain point. For instance, who will go if it will be in\neach group? Each group, a certain group is able to take 20 people, who will be the 20? So\nit -- maybe it was a key, it was called a political key or organizational key, 15 from this\nside and 5 from this side, and if girls, so the most girls were from the Communist and we\ntook it for granted that it cannot be others, this is, and they were begging, I don't know\nhow it was done but we could feel 1t and even when I have to go, so I could not go with\nothers, I have to wait. I remember there was a group which left before me from\nHa'Shomer Ha'Tzair and Ha' Chalutz Ha'Tzair, they left, I guess, in January 1944. I have\nto wait another two months. It was also a question with rifle. Who will give me a rifle. I\ncannot go in the street and buy it. So, I decide very easily to sell my watch, my hand-\nwatch, I remember even the firm, it was Tiso (ph). I saved it for bar mitzvah for my\nUncle Moses and I gave it to a certain man. He brought me money, I give the money my -\n- the activist of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, I remember the name, his name was Eli Rausuk\n(ph), and one day he told me, \"It's settled. When you go, you will go with a rifle.\" Of\ncourse I was very happy. Other things like boots, high boots, because without high boots\nyou cannot go to the forest. It's like arms. He went with me this guy, Eli Rausuk, like a\nbig brother or like a father, until we got two good boots fit for my legs, for my feet. And\nafterwards, he went with me to a tailor in order to make for me an overcoat also, half to\nhere, because you cannot go with a long coat in the forest and so on and so on. And also\nequipment and everything. He went with me mostly to the workshops in the ghetto. Also,\nthe management of the workshop was helping the partisan organizations, and the\ncoordination, we understood that it was made in the high level between the management\nof the workshops the organization -- underground organization and somebody in the\nElderstrat or the Judenrat. Anyway, when I went to the forest, I was very good equipped.\nAlso, with cigarettes and tobacco and with underwear and with a rugsack, a sack to put\nmy things, a raincoat and even with a white shirt, no not shirt, a white -- you know, in\norder to -- a white manufacturer, I would -- in order to use it when we are going in an\narea of snow so we could very nice to make all camouflage. It was -- they did the best.\nThey did the best, and it also give me a very good feeling that somebody 1s taking care on\nme because I was alone, without family, without nothing. And I have also to mention a\nparty before this in our collective, singing songs and drinking even vodka but of course\nthey told we have to accustom ourselves to the life in the partisans. And I remember one\nor two people come from the forest, from the groups who left before and come to make\nus -- to give us instructions how to behave. With arms and with other things, and also\nhow to use a password, we called it a parole. And some was in Russian, not everybody\nknew the Russian language. We knew more or less, but in order not to be lost, and also\nthat a good partisan must to drink vodka, not to be an exception. He have to accustom\nhimself with all the life. And they gave us a lot of advice. How to handle when it happens\nso, and when it happens so, what to do, and afterwards these two guys took us to the\nforest and they become our guides.",
        "Q: Now, I want to hear all about that escape to the forest. So, I want you to tell me --\nactually I'm thinking of one other question and maybe you can make the answer brief, but\nI know in the beginning I think this important, I know in the beginning you were\noperating in very small cells. Nobody knew what anybody else was doing. There were\nthree, maybe five people. All of a sudden you're in a commune. At what point in time did\nall of this change and how?",
        "A: After the 26th of October 1943 when we meet a big number of the organizations, not one,\nmet together in the hideout, in the Block C after we could make lights in the evening, so\nwe saw many people I know one body, somebody knew me but we're from different\norganizations. And from then, it was no more secrets. We kept other secrets, where we\nwere hiding, arms and so on and some but the belonging to the organization was no more\nsecret. Of course we kept many things, when we are going, and other things, and our\ndestination, our direction, even we didn't know exactly, only the last two days we were\nkept in a certain place, and then we get the last instructions. From there we could not go\nback home. It wasn't home it was a kibbutz, no more, and then we were given, very secret\nthings that if you are lost and you are alone what do you have to do.",
        "Q: So, how did you get out of the ghetto? Try to remember and describe for me your escape\nfrom Kovno.",
        "A: Oh, I will never forget it in my life, because I-- our coming out was postponed several\ntimes and we become -- I would say, nervous or maybe it will not fulfilled because it was\nlike a dream, like a dream, and a good dream. So one or two or some hours we have to\nwait again and to come again. I don't know what happened and why, but I trust the\norganization like it would be God, for a religious man. So, 1t comes the moment when\nthey call, \"Okay, now you have to go to the tracks.\" They prepared us, I think, with\nnumbers that not altogether will climb, and so it will not make disorder there. So, on the\ntrack, I saw two soldiers, German soldiers with uniform, maybe they belong to the police\nor Wehrmacht. After a few minutes I realize these are two from our group, and they make\nlike they would be our escorts. So, I had really to admire organization. If they are so\nclever, so sophisticated that they can prepare everything, so I hope it will be everything\ngood. And we heard that somebody's asking questions at the gate, police or other and\nthen at certain times electricity was short, closed in order to make that nobody can watch\nus and so on and somebody was asking, \"Where are you going?\" so another voice\nanswer, \"Yes, these men are going to work in the brigade of Baptai (ph),\" a certain place\nwhere Jewish use to work there, hard work. And we moved. They all begin to walk and\nwe felt more than happy, but in a certain place not far from the ghetto the truck was\nstopped. What happened? We have to be very quiet. Not to questions or nothing, and\nwhat's important, not to take with us things that can make evidence that we were Jews\nfrom the ghetto, other Jews. For example, I have to leave the pictures from my family and\nfrom me of course, many things and not one word written in Yiddish. If I would be\nreligious so I could not take with me , no, nothing. So I'm coming again\nwhen the truck stopped and we hear again voices, here and there, talking Lithuanian,\ntalking Russian. After a few moments somebody saw a big sack with -- that was about\nten or fifteen rifles. I don't remember how it was -- how I get one of them, but I did and\nby this moment or maybe before, we had a commander and a comissar, it was political\ncommander. No, I think the commander was one of the people who should be our guide\nto the forest, because he came several times there and here and he knows, and should\nknow every stone on the highway. So, in certain moment he told us, \"Now you are taking\noff your red stars and putting them in a certain place,\" or maybe eating them -- I don't\nremember, and he told, \"Now you are partisans.\" We have guns. We have maybe hiding\nin certain places because it also can be against us if somebody is coming to make a\nsearch, but maybe not because we have all our rifles and now we can now do something,\nwe can defend ourselves. So, we went very far about 40 or 50 miles and you have to\nstand up and then we have to stand in a line and we were walking by foot. To put our\nwhite shirt or lining, I don't know how to call it in English, big white things, we put it so\nthey -- we could not be very easy watched because this area was with snow and we went,\nand we went, and many miles and we had heavy packs with us. We also have not private\npacks but things to take for the forest, for the bases, maybe a radio, maybe other things,\nmaybe medicaments for the small hospital that we had in the forest, maybe other things,\nmaybe it calls for -- I don't remember but it was very heavy to go. I remember some of\nthe people collapsed on the way.",
        "Q: How many were there with you?",
        "A: Oh, we were a very big group, I think 28, and we have --",
        "Q: Men and women?",
        "A: Men and women and we have -- I remember everybody has a gun, two have machine\nguns, and one has an automatic rifle, that's called a sedete (ph) in the Russian terms. Even\nthe girls had guns, yes. And also it was heavy to have the gun and the pack. So, at night\nwe come to a place in a certain village, and we were told that we have not to go in only\none -- everybody in one house not in the middle of the village but in the side. Excuse me,\nit was not -- it was at day. At night we have to go, to go and to go and to go. At day, we\ncome to a certain house like a farm, let's call it farm. So everybody come to this farm we\nweren't allowed to leave. Till the evening, we have collected about twenty people. So it\nwas a neighbor come to see his neighbor. \"You are very nice, you are our neighbor but\nyou cannot leave.\" You know, it is because he cannot go and tell the police, and others.\nNobody 1s leaving. Afterwards come his wife to look after him. What is he doing, my\nhusband. Maybe he's drinking or maybe other things, so she come also. \"You will stay\nwith your husband.\" Sometimes you saw kids, and so on and so on. As evening, a lot of\npeople with us, and at this time some of us could relax and to sleep by a certain order.\nSome were staying with the rifle and hand radio that everything can't happen. And so we\nmake it like two or three days until we come to the forests. Yes, and before we come to\nthe forest we have to cross a very critical point. It was a railway. The railways were very\nwatched by the Germans because it was a very strategic thing. Anyway we have to make\noperation to send people here and there and to watch the Germans will not come here,\nand we did it. After that we have to cross a highway. Also, more or less the same tactic\nand then we were told now we are in the partisan area. Partisan area. Also, we have to go\nwith the arms, but you feel yourself to be more free, not be in tension so much more. But,\nfor me it was another tension. If we are already in the kingdom of the partisans, so it's the\ntension of be proud of, joy, to be glad, to be happy, you can use many words for this.\nSometimes I have seen signs on trees, heavy trees with swamps around them and\nsometimes we have to go on a very narrow tree which was lying. So, as it moved like in a\nstory, or films that we have seen about the partisans after the October revolution in\nRussia or other places, and we have seen sometimes on the trees signs red, or white, or\ntogether so I was sure that it's for us, somebody put this for us. I was so trusting of the\norganizations, the partisans, not more of the organization of the ghetto. It was another\nauthority for me. So, I was very high there, like I was took drugs. One moment we saw a\nman with a big, full hat, a Papacha (ph) it's called, of Siberia, with an automatic arm and\nhe told us a password, in Russian parole. He didn't know, but our guys they knew, before\nthey told him so he come smiling to us, \"You're partisans,\" and he shook hands with\neverybody. But we have to go farther and farther, and we were exhausted, especially the\ngirls and we have also weak people. Some people are very strong outside but here it was\na hero who can make the way can also be a . Until we come to our bases. In\nour bases also we have to pass a guard but this guard was already one that we know from\nthe ghetto, our man. Now also, we were kissing everybody and he had to leave us and to\ntold that the group came from the ghetto. He himself could let us come inside. He did it,\nhe went, and the other was watching us, it must be. And afterward come the commander\nof the attachment and invited us all with greetings, \"Now you can come in, you can\ncome.\" And that was a big celebration. Everybody was asking me what happened with\nmy uncle, with my girlfriend, and so on, the other thing, \"Have you tobacco?\" or maybe\nit was the first question. I was very large and everybody I gave my tobacco so tomorrow I\nhave nothing to smoke for myself. But it was a very, very, very happy meeting, until its\ncome to a finish and everybody has another friend to ask look we have other music it's\nnot so nice, it's very hard to be a partisan and that already perished and that were already\ntaken as prisoner of war by Germans and we knew what it means to be in prisoners a\nGerman, and partisan, and even a Jew, and that sometimes there are anti-Semitic\nincidents even between the partisans and so on and so on. But we were talking half the\nnight until we asleep.",
        "Q: Now, when you met with these other people in the forest, were they all Jews, were they\nSoviet partisans? I'm wondering who these other people were. Were they all part of your\norganization?",
        "A: This time, and we are talking about March, 1944, and detachments of\nto the occupants in Russian it's so it can be\ntranslated \"Death to the occupants or the conquerors,\" in English. So, it was a mixed unit\nfrom two or five or three paratroopers, they were the nucleus of this detachment.\nLithuanian, or Russian, people before Communists and they were parachuted into the\nforest in order to establish this detachment. A big part were former prisoner of wars,\nRussian, who escaped from their camps, P.O.W. camps. And a big part, I think in the\nbeginning the people of the ghetto made about 60, if not more percent, coming more and\nmore and more till a day what from the ghetto nobody could no more join us for internal\nthings that happened in the ghetto, so this turning point afterward we become less and\nless and less.",
        "Q: And you said there were incidents of anti-Semitism, even with the partisans?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you experience any of that?",
        "A: I have, yes. First at all, I heard the word ours and yours. What does it mean? For me\neverybody was now somebody very close. We are fighting together, and there, ours and\nyours. And I've seen that also they are living in the same -- incertain concentration of\nJewish partisans and un-Jewish, not formal, but de-facto. So, I have another example.\nOne of our guys, he was, he come really with us. A nice boy, a tall boy, he was dead\nbecause he ate too much. He was hungry too much and something happened to his\nstomach and he passed away so we buried him. So, what happened, it comes only the\ncommissar and made a speech, \"Ta, ta, ta, ta,\" and from the fighters they are not only\nJewish fighters. That's what happened. There were other things, but I'm not sure if 1t was\nanti-Semitism or not, some partisans, Jewish partisans, were shot by their comrades on\nthe way to a certain missions. They came without them and told a story there that was\nvery suspicious.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: How long were you in the forest fighting with the partisans?",
        "A: I was till the first week of July 1944, and then --",
        "Q: I'm sorry I want to hear a whole sentence, so say I was in the forest.",
        "A: I was in the forest, or better, in the Rudniky Forest, as partisan till July 1944, the 9th of\nJuly we heard the thunder of the big guns, the artillery, the Katusha of the Red Army, or\nthe Soviet Army, so we knew that -- and we knew also from other sources from radio or\nso, that the Red Army or the Soviet Army is coming back to this area. So, we were told\nalso we will go like to help the big army to help them to liberate Wilno because Wilno\nwas very close to us about 20 miles or so. But then happened a certain event that was for\nus, for me personally, very important. The 9th of July early in the morning come to us a\ngirl partisan from the Wilno detachment which were located not far. We were all the\ntime, we had, I would say, unlegal relations. She was also from Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair. She\nwas sent by Abba Kovner (ph). Abba Kovner was the commando of the Wilno\ndetachment. Her name was Ruska Kolchak (ph), a very known partisan. She told -- came\nhalf secretly to us and told us, \"You have to go now as we are doing, you will come to\nWilno, but when you come, in Wilno, please don't leave the place. You will be in a new\norganization with the aim of to go immediately by all means we can to Palestine.\" And\nwe were -- it was very logical for us and it was not big surprise and we left the forest and\nwe come to Wilno and then was the beginning of a new organization. Afterwards, this\norganization gets the name Bricha (ph), it means escaping. And I was working for the\narchives of the internal ministry of Soviet Union, it's called Ainkavede (ph), yes. I was\nvery proud that they took me. They took me because I knew several languages and I was\nintelligent. So, I attended high school, so they took me, and I was working there. One of\nmy jobs was to make use from the material the Germans left, papers. And I did it with\npleasure because I found them very interesting material, even some reports from the\nGermans made on our activity of my detachments. We also found list of names of\nLithuanian soldiers and policemen who took part in killing Jewish people, so I was again\nvery happy that I can do some important thing. But at the same time, we were building\nanother unlegal organization to go to Palestine. And one of this was to prepare false\ndocuments to go by train or by buses -- not buses but by tracks or by foot or by any\nmeans to go to Chernovtsy, it means in Bucovina in the south, southwest of Ukraine.\nFrom there to smuggle the border to Romania and there we were told maybe that we can\nfind a ship and go to Palestine. That's close enough. From Kovno, or from Wilno to\nBucuresti was about 1,000 kilometers, it's 900 miles. So, we did it bit by bit man after\nman. I left Wilno, I left my job, I left Wilno, I left my arms, with a girlfriend from the\nghetto, with her small sister like we are a family. I am the father, she is the mother and\nthe small sister is our daughter. It makes less dangerous for us. We get also a card, how to\ngo from which place to which place, to whom to apply and what will be our passports.\nAnd we did it. And for instance, I left Wilno I think the 19th of January 1945. It means a\nhalf year after I left the forest. I didn't want to come back to Kovno because I hate Kovno\nbecause every man in the street was a killer of my family or other of my friends. Wilno\nwas for me more neutral, for me personally, and the other thing that we were told also not\nto go far because if somebody needed us and I had the opportunity to go and our train\nwas to leave very fast this country, this lousy country of anti-Semitism and killers and all\nthe bad things that I suffered, not only me but our whole communities, whole generation.\nSo, we went to Wilno to Minsk, from Minsk to Baranovichi, I'm talking about\nByelorussia. From Baranovichi to Koval, from Koval to Volpe. In each place we found a\nman he some give us to eat, sometimes also to sleep. Sometimes we slept outside on a\nroof of a wagon, but we did it and in Lvov it is Galicia or west Ukraine, then we met with\nsome girls partisans we can call them liaison officers, L-I-A-S-O-N, so one of them, I\nremember was Zelda, she was also, she did such a job also between Wilno ghetto and the\nforests and we went -- and we were sleeping in the Jewish library of Lvov, on the ground,\nby there were two -- were several people, more and more and they have to go farther. So\nwe heard one day that Chernovtsy one of the groups were caught and put into the prison.\nIf so, the way is closed to that and we were talking it's burned. If so, we have to go to\nchose an alternative road. I even was sent for a while to other places in the south, to\nStansislav, it's also the area of Ukraine, in order to make sure what happened in\nChernovtsy because -- anyway I come back to Lvov, Lvov it's Lemburg, so I give a\nreport and we decided to go straight from Lvov to Poland. To go to Poland we have to\ntake new documents that we are Poles. So we made it, we crossed the border and the next\nday we were in a city called Pshemysl, or Peremyshl. There we also have to wait for\nseveral weeks, two weeks or three weeks and we made also a new kibbutz. We are living\ntogether and tried to go farther, also to make new documents because we didn't talk\nPolish. In Lithuania, the Jewish people, our generation, doesn't understand Polish. Even\nnot to talk, and if you are talking, everybody will see that we are foreigners and that was\nvery dangerous because we escaped from the Soviet Union and that only traitors are\ndoing or enemies of the people and so on and so on. They will catch us and they will send\nus to Siberia, 1f not to shoot us. So, we went from Pshemysl to Zeshev (ph). In Zeshev we\ndid a very fine thing. We went to the commander, or chief office of the county governor,\nStarosta (ph), Polish, and we told him that we are partisans who were from Greece and\nhave to go to our country back. And we were talking between us Lithuanian. A little bit\nof Yiddish and we -- the rabbi of Zeshev, he knew the truth and he was translator. Before\ncoming to this man, the governor, we make on our hands numbers like we were prisoners\nof Auschwitz or other places. We do it with very easy ink, the next day we could take it\noff. And we showed, \"You see?\" He told, \"Here are the people.\" And we showed, \"Here.\"\nSo he gave us immediately, he was a very nice man, \"Oh Greece, good.\" It was an\nincident he would -- he want that we will meet a really group from Greece and so we\nwere very afraid they will recognize that we are not. So, we said, \"No, we are very tired\nand we have to go immediately.\" He gave us documents and we went. From Zeshev to\nTransylvania, it means already Romania. Cluj, Klausenberg, from Cluj we took express\ntrain to Bucuresti because Bucuresti was former Romania and we trust that from\nBucuresti we can go to Constanta to the port and then to take a ship to go to Palestine.\nBut in Bucuresti probably the KGB or other services were following us. And we have to\nmove, we have to move and we heard that in Italy is a Jewish brigade from Palestine so\nthat could be a good way we thanks them to come. So we did. And after being three\nmonths in Bucharest, also we were living in kibbutzim, oh, we were very -- not only from\nLithuania also from Poland and Czechoslovakia and other places everybody was safe to\nremember that that is the best way to go to Palestine, but only for us former citizens from\nSoviet Russia, because Lithuania was a part of Soviet Russia, was so dangerous. So we\ndecided we are going to Italy so we went back from Bucuresti to Cluj from Cluj to\nBudapest, from Budapest to Chambatoy (ph), from there to Saltzburg, that means\nAustria. In Austria we have to cross the border again to the area which belonged to the\nBritish Army, means Italy. Also we have again to cross the border and we were arrested\nseveral times by the Russians, patrols, and they took us here and took us back and\neverytime we have another story. In each pocket we have another document, other\nnames, and we have to remember all the names all the nicknames, everything. So, we\ncome to Italy. Italy we come to Tarviso (ph), it's on the border between Italy and Austria.\nWe came the 15th or 14th of July 1945, and that was a big, big festival. What happened,\nmany leaders from the survivors come there then we met Mr. Garfunkel, who was a\nmember of the Elderstrat, and he was so nice received by the soldiers. Some of them\nwere from Lithuania who emigrated to Palestine many years ago. They knew he was a\nvery prominent man. Afterwards was Abba Kovner from Wilno, and maybe also Tzivia\n(ph) -- no, Tzivia we met on the way. Anyway, it was a big, big festival now, and from\nthere we have yes, and Abba Kovner sent me for another emissary back to the Russians\nin order to show -- to be a guide for three soldiers from the Jewish brigade who want to\ngo back to their homes. I don't know if they deserted for a certain time or get permission,\nbut he was sure that if I made the way several times I know. I didn't know, but I did it. I\ndidn't know the way, but somehow I did it and come back. When I come back I told more\nI will not go. I would like to come here to Palestine and finish with all the tasks. Iam a\nprivate man now, so I was put in another kibbutz of young people with the supervision of\nJewish soldiers in Mestre (ph), Mestre it very close to Venice, and we spend there a very\nnice Rosh Hashana, in the ghetto, Venice, in the Nafi (ph) of the English Army, with a\nchaplain, evrything, very nice. The Jewish soldiers become our parents of this kibbutz.\nOne day I was told that, \"You because you are already on the way a long time, you are\nchosen with another one to go to Palestine.\" It was in the middle of the night. Everything,\nyou know, secretly and so and so, underground noise, and you're underground.\nUnderground of the Bricha, that's made by Israel -- Palestine guys together with Jewish\nsoldiers from the Brigade, or other soldiers, it was another mafia. So, we went all the\nnight by truck, from Venice to Barre. It's all Italy, maybe took more than one night, I\ndon't remember. But we come -- it was in the south of Italy. We were put in another\ncamp, a very secret camp. We could not go out because it was secretly and the Italians\nshould not know who we are.",
        "Q: How many were there of you?",
        "A: Oh, we were then about 250 people. Also from other groups because it was like a stream,\nwhich is going and when the stream is coming near Palestine, the stream becomes bigger\nand bigger and bigger. So, we met people from other places even they come from\nAuschwitz. They were the real Auschwitz, not like me with a false number. And even\nfrom France and from Belgium and from many places. I told you it's like a river, it's\ncoming, it's coming, but this place we were isolated -- even not to buy a wine from the\npeasants. They have a good wine for us, it was very important so we did, at night we did\nit. But we lost our patience and one day they took several guys from us, I think there\nwere 180, and took us also by night -- at night to a certain place, a hiding port, a small\nport in Trento (ph), this is south of, south of Italy, and there was waiting for us a small\nship. A small ship, a small ship, like half of a normal tennis place. We were 180 people\nand when we come to the ship it is also by certain order. It reminds me when I come to\nthe truck in order to go to the forest. I wrote it afterwards also in my diary that it's the\nsame sensation I have. Anyway we were took on the ship. The ship was very small, but in\nsuch a room there were about five or six floors of places to sleep, like in a store. Every\nman has so much place and it was -- I can't describe -- 1t was made like in a field hospital\nwhen somebody is carrying you. So, it was such --",
        "Q: A cot.",
        "A: A cot, yes. Many cots, and we were lying there about seven nights, six nights only at\nnight we could go and have fresh air because British airplanes if they're watching us,\nmilitary airplanes, because in this time the British prohibited to -- were not allowing the\nJewish to come by the thousands to Palestine. It was their policy. And one night we could\nsee the lights, we were told the Carmel Mount and other things, so afterwards it was not\ntrue it was Cypress, and we have to make it around Cypress because some ships were\nrunning after us, the English marina. So, marina in the sea and the Royal Air Force in the\nskies. Everybody is running after us. After we already left Europe, but we are in a very,\nvery good mood, also singing. There were some pregnant women with us and we have\nnot too much water. We are very short on water until we came one night, it was the 23rd\nof October, 1945 to a place, very small place that ship can stay near. It was in the center\nof the coast of Palestine, Israel between Shefaim (ph) and Kibbutz -- Kibbutz Shefaim,\nand another place, let's say Kibbutz Shefaim. And there we have seen that many very\nsmall people are coming like swimming. We didn't know who they are. Afterwards we\nrealized that they were people of the Hagganah (ph), who come to take us because we\nwill not -- we have to go in the water. So, I remember that a very heavy girl took me on\nher shoulder so I told her, \"I can go by my foot.\" No she told, \"We have order, nobody\nwill go.\" After that I understood, because we had to make several kilometers by foot until\nwe came to a certain place that they took us on another truck and also us and also what\nwe have, our cargo. I had some shmates (ph) with me, that's all. Anyway, when they took\nus also, I could see that some people with Australian big hats are watching with arms on\nthe two sides. I was told that if the British police will come, they will shoot on them. So I\nwas told, I don't know if they would do it. Anyway, I felt myself very good and I\nremember that we were so thirsty that we took grapefruits from the trees and we eat it\ntogether -- all together. And the same nights we were brought to a village by the name\nGivat Chen (ph). They took me and another partisan and knocked on the door. It was in\nthe midnight. The man asked, \"Who are you?\" His answer was very funny, \"We brought\nyou a man from the sea.\" So, I am a man from the sea. I never was a sailor. \"A man of the\nsea,\" he opened immediately. Maybe it was also a password, I don't know, but he\nunderstand, he looked at me and cried. He talked with me Polish, German, Yiddish. I told\nhim I am talking Hebrew. \"Oh, very good, very good.\" All his family were sleeping and\nhe asked me, \"Don't to talk so loud.\" I told him, \"But I am happy.\" So, he put me in the\nwashroom to clean myself because I maybe was looking like a rubber something with a\nbeard, not make my hair nothing. Half military uniform, I have half civilian, a very bad\nimpression. So, he took me in the washroom leave me in the washroom to wash. When he\ncome back, he found me drinking the water, here from the water, he looked, \"What are\nyou mad?\" I tell him, \"I am still thirsty. I have not drink water for several days.\" I told\nhim, \"I can give you coffee or tea as much as you want.\" Anyway, I slept and the day\nafter they collected all the people from the farmers from this village, and everybody had\nto decide where he is going. It was a table with a green cover like in an office, and there\nwere sitting people from several organizations. Zionists, left Zionists, this Zionists,\nanyway, and also Beitar, or not Beitar, anyway, I told that I belong to Ha'Shomer\nHa'Tzair so please send me the kibbutz of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, so it happened. And\nafterwards I was living in this kibbutz, Beit Zera (ph) a year, until September 1946 and\nthen I decided to go to Jerusalem to the University. But it was a short time, I could not\nmake my studies because it occured the War of Independence and that's another story.",
        "Q: How long was this journey from the time that you were in Wilno and you made the\ndecision until the time you actually came ashore in Palestine, how many months?",
        "A: The decision was made in the 9th of July, 1944, but it was only a decision. But the really\njourney began the 19th of January 1945 and finished the 23rd of October 1945, so it\nmeans about ten months.",
        "Q: I want to ask you one more question, and it's a little bit of a different way of thinking.\nYou've had many experiences over the last 40 years in Israel and that's for another time,\nbut you rebuilt your life. You have a very fascinating life in Israel now. Are there\ninfluences from your boyhood in Kovno that you think are still a part of you?",
        "A: Boyhood, you mean --",
        "Q: The time you're growing up?",
        "A: You mean till the Holocaust or after, because you cannot put --",
        "Q: Not after so much, but I mean you came from a strong culture or strong community in\nKovno, family, friends, religion, how much did that influence what you became later on?",
        "A: Oh, I think that my childhood and what you call boyhood, is a new word for me, I never\nheard it, but I like it, it, I think it's a continuity, nothing happened because when I came\nto Palestine I found many of my family of my uncles, aunts, cousins, classmates who did\nit before from the organization from Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, so it was a road. A road that\neverybody will do it before or after, so for me it was so natural, only what happened, the\nHolocaust and all the things after and maybe also include the Soviet time 1940 and 1941,\nit was something out the order for me. But to come to Palestine what for me it was like\ntwo and two are four.",
        "Q: I was just wondering if there was anything especially unique in your growing up in\nKovno that --",
        "A: Yeah, but Kovno was a very modern community. Kovno, Lithuania of Kovno, even more\nthan Wilno was called the Eretz Yisrael of the Diaspora. So sometimes we were also -- it\nwas not all the community but we were brought up in a Jewish, Yiddish, or Communist\nideology but if we take, I would say about 60 percent of the Lithuanian Jewry they were\nbrought up in the way that I was brought up. May I give you an example. In 1935 there\nwere elections in all the world for the Zionist Congress. It happened every two years so\nin this small Lithuania with about 155,000 Jewish people inhabitants, they took part in\nthis elections about, I think, more than 45,000 people. Maybe some of them did it not\nseriously, they did automatically, and maybe they were not very strong Zionists, but\nanyway in this time 1s a need of the 30's the Zionist, I would not even tell Zionists, the\nnational feeling was very strong. The Hebrew culture was dominating. So, even religious\npeople were Zionist, so it's not a contradiction. So, I cannot see that Israel in the 40's\nwhen I came was something new for me. I'll give you another example. When the bus, no\nit was a bus, no more trucks, it was a bus from Egged company took us from the place I\nwas at night in the village Givat Chen, to the kibbutz, I was sitting and I remember a\nwoman asked me, \"Where are we now? What is here?\" It's a long way it's about four\nhours. So I told her, \"You don't know? That's the Mount Tabor.\" So, because I knew the\ngeography of Palestine, or Eretz Yisrael, more than of Lithuania. And you know like a\nfish who is in an aquarium and put back to the original water. That happened to me.",

        "Q: Why were you so intrigued or driven towards Palestine?",
        "Q: What -- I'd like to hear a little bit more about the Youth Movement that you were\ninvolved in, the group you just mentioned. What was the basis of that? What were you\ntaught? What kind of activities did you participate in?",
        "Q: Did they teach you how to use weapons, how to fight if you needed to, any of those sorts\nof things?",
        "Q: So, it was a very religious community?",

        "Q: Which area did you grow up in?",
        "Q: Let me ask you something because you just mentioned Communists. There were also\nyouth groups that were Communist oriented right?",
        "Q: I'm just sort of wondering how one chose to belong to Beitar versus the Communists.\nWhat were some of the differences? Did -- was there any interaction between these\ngroups?",
        "Q: How did you decide to join the group you chose?",
        "Q: What about the Communist groups. Did you know people who joined those?",

        "Q: Let me ask you one question about the different groups. Now before the Soviets took\nover, you said the Communist youth groups were really underground. Did they become\nmore important under that year of Soviet rule than some of the Zionist movements?",

        "Q: We were talking the -- about how the Communist groups became much more important.",
        "Q: One more question and then I want to move onto the Germans. Yousaid -- your\norganization became illegal. Did you continue -- did Beitar and some of the other\norganizations continue but on an underground basis now?",
        "Q: You could have gotten in trouble, yes?",
        "Q: You can probably guess one of the reasons I'm asking you about these youth groups and\nwhether you had to go underground and all of that is because later on you were involved\nin resistance activities, and I'm wondering if any of the tricks you learned, any of the\nrelationships you formed as a boy were important later on. Were a way that you kind of\ndeveloped that helped you and got you interested in resistance activities later?",
        "Q: Okay, let's -- I want to move ahead a little bit. Do you remember what was happening the\nday that Kovno was occupied by the Germans?",
        "Q: That's ironic.",
        "Q: We were talking about how -- what was going on when the Nazis occupied Lithuania,\noccupied Kovno. As I understand it, there was a tremendous amount of chaos, certainly\nin the beginning. People were being beaten, killed, taken out. I don't know if this was\nsomething that you saw or experienced?",

        "Q: You can say parole or password, but I need you to begin by saying the policeman. It's a\nfull sentence.",
        "Q: The other question I have is, I assume there were also Communists cells or other groups\nand I'm wondering if you -- the different groups worked together or if they had separate\nresponsibilities in terms of helping people get supplies or get out of the ghetto. Do you\nknow -- what did you know about that at the time?",

        "Q: I think what you can is that the underground -- because I don't think people know this --\nwas really young people and that if you then kind of go and say the Zionist organizations\nmaybe had better cooperation with the community, or I don't know.",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "Q: Now, I want to hear all about that escape to the forest. So, I want you to tell me --\nactually I'm thinking of one other question and maybe you can make the answer brief, but\nI know in the beginning I think this important, I know in the beginning you were\noperating in very small cells.

        "A: Certainly. My name is Dov Levin now. And I was born like Belle Levin. Belle its means\nin Yiddish, Bill, animal, so the translation in Hebrew is Dov, but because we were all the\ntime brought up in Hebrew school, Hebrew youth movement, this also, this what many,\nmany people know me. It is -- I was born in 1925 in Kovno, it's called now Kaunas. It\nwas capital of Lithuania, because Wilno was occupied by the Polish soldiers and so on.\nSo, in 1925, it was still a Jewish autonomy, Lithuania. So, if I would lucky, so I could\nfind my certificate of birth, written in Lithuanian language and in Hebrew. Maybe one\nday I will find it, but what is more important for our conversation is that I was one of\ntwins. My sister was Basya (ph), or in Hebrew Batya (ph), and she unfortunately,\nperished in Stutthof, during the Holocaust, and after her my, one of my kids Basmat, who\nis now living in New York, she is named after her. Basmat, a very cute girl. And I have to\ntell something about my parents. My father was Hirsh Levin, in Hebrew, it's Tzvi, in\nLithuanian it's changed the word H 1s G -- Girsh. My mother -- he is also from Kovno,\nmy mother came from a small village by the name Retchna (ph). It is in north, northwest\nof Kovno, and her maiden name was Wigodel (ph), some write it with a W, some with a\nV, but her first name, I forgot to tell, that it is Bluma (ph). Bluma. Bluma it means a\nflower, therefore, my second daughter is named Nitzana (ph), it means the crisp before\nthe flower come out. My son 1s called Tzvika (ph), on the name of my father.",
        "A: When I was a child, I -- for me Kovno was everything. It was everything because we\ncould find there everything what belongs to the Jewish life, from our synagogue to our\nschool in Hebrew or Yiddish, till many universal things like cinemas and so on and so on.\nSo we felt ourself as a part of Europe. Part of, I would say, Western Europe, or Europe,\nyes. It was an orientation. In our house the German language was one of the languages\nspoken, because my father used to work with German companies, and after Hitler came\nhe changed a little and went to other companies in England. So, he now house the coming\nand going people from abroad and what's most important is we have very good\nconnection with Palestine. Actually my generation, or part of my generation we were\ndreaming about Palestine like we were there, and the geography of Palestine, I knew\nbetter than the geography of our country, of Lithuania. The same also with the languages.\nThe Lithuanian language we only had to do it for examinations and so on. But the daily\nlanguage was Hebrew. Hebrew. Hebrew at the school. Hebrew in the youth movement,\nand Hebrew when I make my first date with a girl in the street, we also did Hebrew, and\nmy parents understand Hebrew. See, I wasn't one. It was a culture, a part of the culture.\nThe -- not everybody was the same kind, but let's say 50 percent of my generation was\nthe same in Kovno. This time in Kovno, I remember there were many, many shuls (ph),\nor synagogues, about 40 I remember from there, and I think it was more or less right, a\nreal number, and I attend a Hebrew primary school. Afterwards what we called\ngymanasium, it means high school. I was in Hebrew, and my youth movement was called\nHa'Shomer Ha'Tzair (ph). So, we were oriented for to go after we attend our school, to\nPalestine and there or to be on the kibbutz, or to go to the Techni, Technion in Haifa --\nthat was my other .",
        "A: I cannot understand it now, but it was so natural the same as a I was born Jewish. So it\nwas a part of all I been, my family, my bigger family. It was our culture, our orientation,\nso we took it for granted that so should be. Even one of my uncles went to Russia, but he\nwas an exception. His name was Borris Levin, and only this week I met his daughter. She\ncome now from Moscow to settle here in Scranton, Pennsylvania.",
        "A: You know, most of the youth movements are alike more or less. They are making sport\ngames and making journeys and making camps, summer camps and other camps, singing\na lot, a lot, a lot, and telling stories. Very nice stories mostly about Israel and about the\nkibbutzim and making it very idealistic and really for me Eretz Yisrael, Palestine, was\nlike in the pictures, that palm tree with tent and chalutzim (ph), pioneers, are dancing\naround, sometimes also working. So that also was the contents of our activities. We were\n-- they told us what is the daily life, not in Tel Aviv, like in the kibbutzim. And that was\nmade by emissaries, shlichim (ph) in Hebrew, which come very often to us, so we knew\nalso the later songs from Palestine and we very up to date what's going there, what\nhappened there. Sometimes more than what happened in our own country.",
        "A: No. Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair was one of the few organizations that were socialist minded. So,\nthe orientation of weapon was only for defense. So, they talked with us about the\nshomrim (ph), it means the guardsmen in Palestine that at night they are riding on the\nhorses and that was a . [remember even the names of these guys. So,\nbut, it was only a need, but not too much, in the opposite let's say of the Beitar\nMovement, they were really military oriented. And I remember in our class, in the\nHebrew class, let's say half of the class was -- belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, the other\nto Beitar, so we are quarrelling. One of the discussions was how do you mean to settle in\nPalestine, only by buying an acre after an acre ground and to work. Each country must be\ntaken only by force that the history is in all the countries 1n all the world, all the times.\nSo, we were quarrelling and so on and some times we are also beating each others. So it\nwas not only in our class, it was like in all places. The community is divided in many\norientations, in many ideologies, but our whole community from the Communists till the\nmost, most Orthodox people like my late grandfather, his name was David Levin. He was\na patriarchic Jew, a very strong man, like in these times. Not like my father, my father\nwas already another generation, more liberal. So, this whole community was Jewish. We\ncannot remember intermarriage, and if 1t happens, so everybody knew who is who and it\nwas something. I remember that also that in our classroom, one girl brought one day --\nwe were without hats, we were -- it was more traditional but not Orthodox, anyway,\nwhen one of my girlfriends from the class, a classmate, she brought a sandwich with\nbutter and meat, so everybody shouts, \"Look what's happened, she's eating so and so.\"\nSo, the public mind of the class was against maybe the other day she didn't know because\nshe didn't felt herself convenient. I even remember her name. It was Tanya Tzvi. Tanya\nTzvi, yes. And she's still living. She's in Tel Aviv. Yes.",
        "A: Not very, but it was very Yiddish, Jewish minded. For instance, Shabbat (ph), I think 95\npercent of the stores, Jewish stores were closed. Orthodox, or not Orthodox, or traditional\nor anti-traditional, only the last years we are accepts, yes accepts. And only some cafe\nhouses or other places but usually they are closed and it was not an easy problem because\nfor the government we had also had to be closed Sundays. So, it was lose of two days of\nearning. Anyway, so it was.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I grew up in the -- now we can call it the down town of Kovno, but not Slobotka.\nSlobotka was a suburb. You have to cross a river by the name of Vilitya (ph), or now it's\ncalled Nairis (ph). In Slobotka were concentrated for many, many years a more poor\npopulation. More poor, some of them very Orthodox but some -- on the other hand there\nwere many people who were Communist oriented. And that -- anyway I can think that in\nmy classroom only one boy was from Slobotka and it's also because his mother was a\ndentist there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Interactions were what I mentioned before, it's fighting.",
        "A: Oh. Yes, I remember that it was a very deep sympathy for this because they were also\nscouts and when I was a child I like much to be a scout. And officially Ha'Shomer\nHa'Tzair for the government we are calling Jewish Scouts. Maybe if I would be in\nanother society and my father was be very right, political right orientation, maybe, I was\nsent or not sent be encouraged to go to Beitar. I remember another thing that I have\nquarrels with my parents because I went Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair. For them it was too left.\nAfterwards when I grew up, when I was a teenager, so it was incidents, sometimes\ninstead to go to the synagogue I went to the activities there. But it was not only my\nproblem, it was a problem for a whole generation and it happens in all the countries till\nnow. Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, they were for us very mysterious because the Communist party and the other people\nwere in underground. This party wasn't allowed in Lithuania, because Lithuania was very\nmuch right oriented and what I remember that the -- May, first May we watched many\ntimes that police forces are ready for demonstrations and we saw that sometimes red flags\nat were hanged that night and morning the police made effort to put them down. Of\ncourse as young people we were sympathizing with the Communists, but it was for us\nvery not -- unclear who is a Communist, why and what. We knew its have to do\nsomething with Russia, Soviet Russia of course, but not too much more. I would not say\nit was a puzzle for us, but something mystery.",
        "A: Oh, that's like a child what -- who don't police, the cops.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, it was a big change, yes. I remember it was at Shabbat, Saturday, the 15th of June.\nWe were in this day in summer camp of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair and my counselor was\nafterwards a very known woman, Chaika Grossman (ph) from Bialystok. She told us this\ndays -- this day but not only this day as she left oriented -- orientated -- girl or young\nwoman escaped from the Russian in Bialystok, and came as refugee to Lithuania because\nshe was a Zionist and she could not live under the Soviets, even, even Ha'Shomer\nHa'Tzair was very, very much orient -- Soviet oriented, so it was how to tell you, half,\nhalf, mixed feelings about Soviet Russia. And now this Shabbat we heard -- the Saturday\n-- we heard noise, afterwards I understood that it was the movings of tanks and we left\neverything and we moved very quickly to house, by foot. It was about eight miles or so to\ngo back by foot. And his place was Claiboneshkis (ph). It's the opposite side of Slobotka\nbut on the Kovno side. It was a village, a small village and I remember that going home\nwe saw many Lithuanians with angry faces. Some of them took their guns because they\nbelonged to a semi-military organization called Shaulei (ph), Shootings Man. So, they\nwear uniforms some of them, and some took the guns and they were running here and\nthere like something happened and they didn't know what to do. Bur they were very\nangry and didn't so of course smile to us. Of course, the opposite. So I understood that\nsomething is going to be wrong. That is a feeling. To me as a Jewish boy, boy, I was then\n15 years old, yeah, 15 and a half. So, we came to Kovno, and Kovno was a very like a\nfestival. People are staying in the streets and making a for the Red\nArmy. Jewish, non Jewish, all mixed, the crowd. And I went straight home because to see\nwhat happened, and that was beginning of the Soviet era in Kovno that lasted one year\nand seven days. For me personally, it was a very bad -- no it was not a bad time, it was\nalso interesting time. First of all, I was shocked by the closing of school. Hebrew school\nwas abolished and we have to in the same, yes in the same building we have to learn\nYiddish. I couldn't understand it. Who is forcing me, why? I knew all because they were\nagainst zionism and Hebrew 1s like a Zionist language. We were very against, and the\nother thing was Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair was abolished. And on the other hand, it was very\ninteresting time, every second day there was a parade, a meeting, a demonstration with\nsongs, very famous songs, that we -- some of them we heard even before, like \"Katusha\"\n(ph). (humming). It's -- in Israel it's popular till now, but no more in Russia. And other\nsongs -- marches --",
        "A: These were Russian songs, of course. The French did it in another way, till now, but the\nRussian song \"Katusha\". Katusha is the name of a Russian girl, Katia, Katy.",
        "A: No, not at all. It's the contrary, now we become really equal citizens. I could see Jewish\npolicemen. I was very proud in this, first time, but the same time for instance my father\nshould to work at Saturday. My father, how my father, but my grandfather was very\nOrthodox man so they took away him from his store, put in a comissar and he have to sit\nhome and to count his days, nothing. I'm not sure that he gets a small pension. I don't\nknow, maybe we helped him. Till this day he was a well-to-do man. What you call your\nmiddle-middle, but now he become unemployed even though he was about 70-75 years,\nbut still he was every day going to the store. The store was more than a place for earning.\nIt was occupation, there everybody came to him and so, and so it was like a club. And\nthat happened to many people. So nobody, nobody starve from hunger, nobody, but it\nhappened after things that people were rich had to go out and leave their nice apartment\nand suites and sometimes also their cars. Poor people for them it was a better change.\nAnd for me as a socialist, or socialist-oriented, I could understand it and evaluate it. Even\nfor my family it was bad. Another of my uncles was -- he visit twice Palestine and\nhesitate if to settle or not, now they took all his fabric, what's is -- factory. It was a\nfactory of leather, a big one. They were working in it I guess about 35 or 40 workers.\nAnd one of them became the commissar, he was thrown out, and I understand he was\nvery sorry he didn't go to Palestine with his wife. His name was Moses Levin. I have\nhere, I am keeping many papers and forms of his factory till now. I got them last year.\nSo, this is an example of a family that something changes the life. My mother has also to\nwork. Till then she was a housekeeper like all the balabustes (ph) in our class, also a\nmiddle-middle, upper -- no it was middle-middle, enough. Here she has to work everyday\nso there were some days that all the family didn't meet because one is working afternoon.\nOne is working from morning until noon. And Shabbos -- Saturday we can not also meet\nlike we used. So it was something new for me but I wasn't too happy about this.",
        "A: Of course, they become now the rulers, the mayflowers. Of course. For them -- especially\nthese people who were sitting for months or years. One of them was 20 years sitting in\nthe prisons. They become the commissars. I remember the commissar was 1n my\ngrandfather's store. He was still without hair, you know, because in the prisons they have\nto cut their hair. So he was still very new released from the prison and the government\ngave them new clothes, mostly leather coats. The commissars, that's the tradition of\nSoviet Russia from the October revolution and so on and anyway that was the gona (ph),\nthe gona it means it closes. Also, my father didn't wear more his hat and wear a caskette\n(ph), we call it, like a Stalin hat on his head. That what modern, to be a politaria (ph) man\nand a socialist and so on and so on. And I remember also me, 1n -- when I was in the high\nschool, I have a special uniform, so the uniforms they called it \"Habits of the Bourgeoi.\"\nNo more everybody is wearing what he wants and what you are more closer to the model\nof study and all the other big shots, such a shirt not too much with a tie. So the people\nunderstood that that is more wanted now. So, it was a big change but there were many\nconcerts and the cultural life was very, very intensive. The first time to go to the theater\nwas then for me.",
        "A: Because to go into the theater before, it was a problem to get a ticket in the big theater\nand here in the Yiddish theater I didn't want to go because it was kiche (ph) and I was not\ntoo much involved in the Yiddish culture, except talking Yiddish and reading Jewish\nnewspaper, daily newspaper. In our city there were about four newspapers, daily\nnewspapers, in such a small city as Kovno.",
        "A: Yiddish, Yiddish not Jewish. There was only one weekly in Lithuanian, and that also was\nmade more for political terms. So, coming back to your question, so please remind me.",
        "A: It was very natural that they become. It was their time now. People coming from the\nunderground to the public. Well, as a members of the Communist party and the people\nwho belong in other ways to this party or to this movement or to this ideology who were\nbefore or in prisons or in non-legal situation, they become now big shots, and it was very\n-- naturally it was very -- everybody could understand it and what happened that some\npeople were far from them, now went to see, maybe one of his family is also between\nthem. Maybe he will be now helped by them, privileged by them, to get a job. It wasn't so\neasy to get a job, because everybody have to fulfill questionnaires. Who you are, who\nwas your father0, what was your income and so on and to which organizations you did\nbelong and etc. So some people even they were before bourgeoi, what belonged to the so-\ncalled bourgeoi, or it was another name. Enemy of the people. Now, if they have a good\none of the family who was a Communist and he was not afraid to help them, not afraid,\nsome denied, \"Okay you are my cousin, but I know who you are, so please leave me\nalone.\" Some of them helped also and what another thing that we have seen many people\nthat were very rich before and not only they were leaved on their places but they became\n-- they make even a progress, they are promoted. So, we were told that even before they\npaid contributions to the Communists funds. Or maybe they have them more, maybe they\nwere spies, [don't know what they were such -- we called them -- how did we call them?\nSalon (ph) Communists.",
        "A: Yes. Some of the organizations began to -- no, officially they abolished themselves in\norder to avoid troubles. They declared -- some of the Zionist groups or even religious\ngroups who were, who were abolished, I think all of them declared officially that they\nstopped their work, their activity in order to avoid troubles. But bit by bit some of the\nmembers who were accustomed to meet every day or every few days together continue to\ndo it, and then somebody gave them an orientation that if you want you can do it, but\nnobody is responsible for you, do it yourself or you won't. And so they established small\ncells like before the Communists did it, in the near past. So, now the Zionists did it and\nmy organization, my youth movement, Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, I remember that some of\nthem, some of them were meeting each day -- no, not each day, twice a week maybe, to\nread Hebrew books. That was activity. Because it's not forbidden, but not fashionable -- it\nan understatement -- so they did it. When I want to join them, they said, \"We are too\nmuch, no, go look another place.\" After that they told me that they were afraid of me. I\ndon't know why, maybe because I have some friends who were in the Youth Communist's\nParty -- movement, youth movement called Consomole (ph). So that they told me\nafterwards. Anyway, so Idid -- what I did myself in order to express my feelings,\nafternoon or at night I come to the, to a new -- through this old building of the high\nschool and stole Hebrew books and brought them home and I was very happy. Yes. For\nme it was like I did what I have to do, what I like to do and nobody -- maybe I can be\npunished for this but only for stealing but not for reading the Hebrew books, because I\nalso, my old Hebrew books that I got for bar mitzvah and other things I -- they were kept.\nWe didn't throw them. I remember also that even the religious was very unpopular and\nsome of us were forced to come to the school Yom Kippur and Pesach, and so on. We\ntried to keep at home how we could -- and me I was not so happy with that religion in\nthis time. I understand it because that is something of all continuity so I did it also, no too\nmuch, but I did it. So I remember Shabbat when our family were together, so sometimes\nplace my father also make Kiddush (ph) and I didn't refuse. What happened at this time --\nyes -- I didn't stop to write letters to Palestine.",
        "A: Yes or not, I don't know. It could be. The question how they would comment it, the\nauthorities. Another thing, I also heard the of Jerusalem. It was very hard, but\nit was a technical problem so I remember I wrote to one of my friends of the class, my\nclassmates, his names was Amos Rabinovitz (ph), Amos Rabinovitz, that why you will\nnot tell your authority to make better that we can hear it even in Lithuanian Kovno.",
        "A: Yes, partly, I didn't belong to the cells usually which numbered three or four members. I\ntold you why and there was no trouble on this, but I knew and also we knew, all the\ngenerations, about underground because we were brought up what I told you of Jewish\nmodern history that -- and not only Jewish history but about the socialists or\nrevolutionaries in Russia against the Czar. So, we knew what to do and we saw many\nfilms about this, so it was not very new for us. But there were some people who begin at\nthis time to publish a underground newspaper in Hebrew, but that I learned not at this\ntime but in the ghetto afterwards.",
        "A: Kovno was occupied by the Germans not the first day of war, but the third day. It was\nTuesday. You know what, I felt a little better because the bombing stopped and we have\nno special shelters so we were hiding ourselves in -- on the stairs between the floors,\nbecause it was in the middle of a very heavy building, it was the safest place. And you\nhave to run, and here and there. So, first of all was its relaxation, a certain relaxation. We\ncan go to bed, maybe and we can eat a time more or less that was the first reaction. We\nknew that we have not to expect good times. That we knew very good from the refugees\nwho came to us and from the newspapers I had also knew not exactly but a lot what they\ndid when they came in Poland a year ago and so on and so on but everybody 1s thinking\nthat to me it will not come. And I remember that the day before somebody informed us\nfrom our house it was my also from my classroom his name is Avraham Yashpan (ph).\nHe is now living in Rio de Janeiro and told me, \"Look, I'm going to escape to Russia.\nThey will slaughter us.\" They, it means not only Germans, but everybody except the\nJewish. We felt that the Lithuanians don't like us, or hate us, better. We felt it, but we\ndidn't know how much. So, I told him I cannot leave my family. Or in other words, so I\nheard his mother voice through the telephone, \"You see Belle is a better son than you.\nHe's not going to leave his family.\" Yes, and this woman by the name of Rachael, or\nRochel, Rachel Yashpan, she was in the concentration camp in Stutthof, and I met her\nafter the war near Rio de Janeiro. She could not come to Palestine for certain reasons. So\nwe were expecting somebody is going to happen, and it happened very quickly. I\nremember from this only two or three things. One, it come to us, I would call them a gang\nof five or six people, people from the street. People with guns or with half-guns or\nsomething and they took us to the back yard -- not the back yard but to the -- you know,\nall the houses were a big place around, so they took us and when we come down, we\nwere living the third floor, we show all the Jewish families in the house. It means that 90\n-- 99 percent except the Gentile are staying in a line and the people come to take us are\nstaying against us with guns and we was very frightened, except when he put, one of\nthem, a young guy put his gun against me. So I remember my mother told me, \"If you\nturn now he will not harm you. He knows that you are a good boy.\" And they told us they\nhad seen the Jewish people are working against the Germans and against the Lithuanian\npartisans. They called themselves partisans. So, I don't know what happened but we were\nreleased to our houses. When we come to the house we have seen that in my daddy's\ntable, he has his own table for writing, what do you call it shaipdish (ph), so he was\nmissing his golden box for cigarettes. So, maybe this was their excuse to come here or to\nrelease us, I don't know. I don't remember. I remember another thing. I remember the\nsame day we heard in the radio the first order in Lithuanian language, \"Nobody is to go\nout and nobody is to take arms,\" and so on. What each army is doing when it's coming\ninto an occupied area, but one, I think it was the last paragraph there, was for each\nGerman soldier will be shot, it will be shot 100 Jewish people signed by Colonel\nBobyalous (ph), the commandant of Kovno, Kaunas. He was appointed right now. And\nnow, let me tell you the same, a year ago when I visited Lithuania as a member of a\ndelegation from the Knesset I met in the parliament the son of Mr. Bobyalous, head of\nthe committee of defense and foreign affairs. And he should be my host to take me so I\navoided twice to shake hands with him, and I didn't.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Something I saw through the window, and I avoided such things to see, naturally, and I\nsaw through the window, for instance, that a young man is going on the street, and\nsomebody 1s arresting him or holding him. This young man took from his pocket a\ncertain paper and showed it to the others -- no I think they told him to go back. He\nrefused. That I understood from his movements, and they showed a certain paper maybe\nit was -- he get it from the Germans, or he worked for somebody already, so they become\nvery angry and took him by the two sides and arrested him. And what makes me very bad\nfeelings is that all the crowds on the streets, they are trying to make a lynch of him. So,\nthen I felt it's not only the Germans, but everybody enemy to each Jew, even to people\nwho were not Communists, who were not part of the Soviet government. It's enough to be\na Jew. So, for instance, my grandfather, I came to visit him because he was living in the\nmore quieter neighborhood than mine, so my parents decided we are living maybe too\nmuch in the center of the city, so it's more dangerous so let's go to the grandfather. The\nGrandfather was living on a small street called Nomonu (ph) Street, Nomonu 14, I think,\nand everything was very quiet. It was a garden on the corner, very idealistic, very quiet,\nand some day came a Lithuanian, civilian Lithuanian with a rifle and come to see. So, he\ntold that he is running after people to work, taking them to work. That was a daily habit.\nJewish people were taken to work. It was part of a to work or to making them\nwork -- it was part of making them that everybody can see them in bad situation, the\nJewish people. That, for instance, an old man has to go with two chairs. He's in the\nmiddle of the street and everybody is going and beating him and so on and so on. So, it\nwas much more than only physical work. So, once such man with a rifle come to take my\nold, old grandfather to work. My grandfather refused. So, he even didn't talk to him\nLithuanian. My grandfather asked me to tell him that he's too old. So, he told me that he\nwill take him by force. So, the grandfather told me to tell him that nothing will help, and\nthey can't take him. So, nothing will -- we will not go. And my grandfather has\nexperience from World War I that I knew also with all the gangs in Russia when they\nwere deported to Russia by the Czars in the -- during the revolution that each gang who\ncome -- occupies a certain city took people and arrested them sometimes he cruel to\nthem, so, he had very, very good experience of life. I would not say good, but rich, let's\nsay. So, he refused, and what happened, in a certain moment I saw two German soldiers\nare coming with a Lithuanian guy. Afterwards I was told that a neighbor from the same\nbuilding saw that the old and very distinguished Mr. Dovid Levin 1s taken by such a\nhooligan, to work, he was very shocked. So far, that her apartment where two German\nsoldiers were put to live there -- 1t happened in all houses. It was a custom that in each\nhouse had to take some soldiers and they were living there. She said, \"Look they are\ngoing to take this old man to work.\" So, they come and saved him. That was very -- I was\nvery impressed by this. Soldiers, but not Gestapo and not other soldiers. A private or a\ncorporal.",
        "A: No. Sometimes they were taken to only to what I told you, like with the chairs. But\nwhat's more important is that some, a big part of them didn't come home. They were\ntaken to the Seventh Fort, to the prison, to another place, murdered. The woman or girls\nwere raped before and afterwards murdered, or by shooting or with knives and so on and\nso on.",
        "A: I learned it later. It could be a day later even because some of these girls told us how they\nescaped, they were saved. I remember a name Ella Volpe (ph). Ella Volpe. She was also\nin my age, about 15 1/2, a nice looking girl. She told us when she was in this fortress,\nNumber 7 or Number 4, I don't remember this, but the other woman took water with sand\nand put on her face so she will look like an ugly or a handicapped woman or old woman\nso nobody will hurt her. That I remember.",
        "A: Yes. So, she told us you know it was very unconvenient to examine her.",
        "A: As this girl, also others were released -- small, small part, I would say ten, fifteen\npercent, no more, and they told us very horrible stories. I remember one of them that they\nwere thirsty, so the Lithuanian guardsmen, also they called himself partisans, he told\nthem, \"If you bring me money I'll let you go to have a water from a swamp, or maybe\nanother place also for water.\" So, they went and on the way they were shoot. I heard also\nthat one of our teachers, former teachers, by the name Goldman, he committed -- he fight\nback. He told them very hard words, and they shoot him after he showed that he is going\nto defend himself. That's what I remember from these times.",
        "A: Lithuanians.",
        "A: The word Einsatzgruppen we didn't heard at the time. We have seen only that usually on\neach group of Lithuanians who are going to murder or make operation for action, it they\ncalled aktzion (ph), were one or two Germans, so the proportion was one two eight, one\nto ten. I don't know exactly, but the daily work usually did the Lithuanians except that\nwhen we come to the ghetto, it was the 15th of August 1944, so there were the beginning\nhautios (ph), and the huge population everybody has to deliver everything of money,\ngold, silver, and other jewels. So, that was done only by German police force. They were\nalso very cruel. They maybe have good -- in their towns they have good training how to\ndo this. Shoot people in order to frighten the others. So, this was done only by Germans,\nnot Lithuanians.",
        "A: Yes, I think you are right. Yes.",
        "A: First at all, it's funny but it was a good news that we are coming to the ghetto. Because\nthe feeling was that in the ghetto we will be preserved. Probably. We will be only Jewish\npeople maybe it will stop all the -- these horrible things, to catch people on the streets, in\nthe houses and to kill them etc. So, there we will work, we will do what happened in\nPoland, so that is and maybe we can survive the war, maybe. So it was good feeling. A\ngood feeling. A good feeling this time, better than before. So, we had to look after a place\nin the ghetto. The ghetto was in Slobotka, the same suburbs, Slobotka, and it was done by\ntwo ways. Or that everybody chose a place and they made exchange with the Lithuanian\nor Polish family who were living there, or to get such a place from the Jewish\nCommittee. Meanwhile there was the Jewish Committee which become afterwards, the\nJudenrat. We didn't know in this time all the names of the famous people, but we were in\nconnections with the level of officers, working in the offices of this Committee, and they\ngave us places. We have to go to the ghetto and we could take everything, everything,\nand I remember from Kovno to Slobtka were a very, very, very long line of vehicles with\neverything. Sometimes also furnitures, and the Jewish had something in the houses.\nEverything you went to the ghetto, and it was before the house search, so the Germans\ncouldn't find concentrated, they have not to go from house to house in Kovno. I\nremember an episode that we come to the Lithuanian family talking about the exchange,\nso the it happened that we also had to give them some money. My father didn't have more\nmoney, so he took out the cover of the table, 1t was a very expensive of a very good linen,\nwith colorful and so on and gave her so, \"Here you have it.\" I became very sensitive in\nthis time and if I want to cry, because it was for me a very situation of helpless. So, I\ninterfered and told this lady, \"Look, you took our -- most of our furniture, most\neverything, you have to know how to keep it.\" That was my - that I remember very good.\nShe looked at me and cried also she. I was going to cry, she cried, but she took. And --",
        "A: No, it was not so organized, but I felt like gypsies are moving, such views we have seen\nbefore, but not so much. It was four kilometers, four miles we see moving and moving\nand going and going, and without an end. And people were looking in the streets. For me\nit was interesting how is their reaction. Pity or the opposite, so as I remember it was not\npity. If it was so it was only several, so I was very impressed by this, by remorse, not. It\nwas like raining, it should be rain, so everybody 1s going in this way.",
        "A: I was in the beginning, living in the small ghetto at a small street called Shiluvos (ph).\nAnd it was right by the fence, by the fence. I can remember that every morning when I\narose, I could see the Lithuanian, so-called partisan, looking through the window, or\nthrough the fence to us, and some of our neighbors -- they put us together, it was lack of\nspace, they put several families together. His name was Beltz (ph). It was a Russian Jew,\nAlexander Beltz (ph), a very tall man, a strong man. So, he went to the soldier, the man\nwho guard, and began to talk to him, make a deal. \"Look, why not you can not bring us\nsome vegetables, something.\" I don't know what they did, but it was some of the people\nbegan to try to see, maybe it was a examination, what he's answering, because we were\nalso frightened of them. Some of them were shooting in the middle of the day, middle of\nthe night, shooting in the windows. Not, for nothing. It was their power and they could do\nwhat they want, when they want.",
        "A: Yes, at this time, all of my family. With my father Hirshel, my mother Bluma, and my\nsister Batya or Basya. We were living together with this old pair. Old, maybe today I'm\nolder than he was, Mr. Alexander Beltz, and I remember that they were talking about\ntheir daughter. She escaped. \"Has she reached the Soviet's country or not?\" he says. \"Or\nnot?\" Probably she left with her finance or with her husband or with a boyfriend. Maybe\nhe was not Jewish. That I don't remember, but this was one of the things that people were\ntalking about in these times. Many of them come back -- come back after they were not\nallowed to come in the Soviet border. Or some were stopped by local gangs, bombers,\nsomething happened. So nobody -- we knew only who come back or who was killed on\nthe way, somebody watched him. But who reached, nobody knows. That I remember. We\nare talking about now as a father of children, I am very -- I understand it more, so if I\ncould not do, maybe my child will be saved, so it's also good feeling, that I remember this\nepisode. And it was door exits, same small building another door were living a big family\nabout twelve or fifteen people. It was not original family, but some survivors, relatives.\nTheir family was Grodnik (ph). Grodnik. I knew one of them, in my age more or less, his\nname was Baruch (ph), or and we called him Boroch (ph). Afterwards he come with me\nto the partisans and now he 1s living in -- near Aco (ph), Acres, in Israel. His father was,\nsome of his sisters, sister-in-law, many, many women. I understood that the males were\ntaken away before, or escaped to Russia. It happened in many families there. That\nalready, it was luck of males because also in the fortress, a very certain part of the women\nwere released, after what happened there. The biggest part of the males were shot there,\nor in the streets. Or they went away. So I think that most -- 1t was a very, very\ncharcteristic amount of a family, or so-called family. That many young women with one\nold man, the father of my friend, and him. And they were also from several places. Not\neverybody were from Kovno. They are moving, some of were coming from the small\nshtetl Kovno, maybe there is more safe. Others were going from Kovno to other shtetl,\nvillage, maybe there is more safe. And so on and so on. So, in Kovno what we could find\nit's people -- it was not the original population of Kovno. I would say that 20 percent\nwere newcomers or already refugees, from other shtetlach.",
        "A: Inside the ghetto, yes. But, I remember that we have -- because it was the small ghetto\nwas very narrow and we avoid to go near the fence, so we made some holes between one\ncourt to another, or small entrance by putting out part of the fence between the court. And\nthat made us a possibility also to go at night, because at night it was prohibitted to go.\nYeah. I remember another thing, also from this house my mother sent me to one of my\nuncles, this Moses Levin, that maybe it's more safe there. And I remember that at night,\nin the evenings, all the people come together like meeting, like in a club and were are\ntalking, lighting a cigarette, and talking, talking, what they were talking? I remember a\nlady which was a year before in France and told how the French people received the\nGermans there, the German soldiers. Another told about his experience in the Soviet\nfactory -- before he was an employee in their store. And the Soviets come and told him,\n\"That's not an occupation for a young man, go to work in a factory.\" And he -- they were\nworking according numbers and who 1s making the number it's enough. I remember the\nresults.",
        "A: No, the Germans didn't come in the ghetto usually. Only when they came that it was\nsomething, so everybody would hide in the town and not showing himself or trying to be\nvery small that nobody can watch you.",
        "A: Yes, but from one house to another house, but not from the fence outside.",
        "A: Yes, like, it was a neighborhood of a suburb, many gardens, so there was a fence between\none garden and another, that was.",
        "A: No, they didn't. No.",
        "A: Yeah but before the war there were fences, natural fences, like you can see in each city,\nthat is a suburbs they are living like in a village, like a cultural village so everybody has\naround his house a fence.",
        "A: Not, not, not at all. Even to go close to the fence, and now I'm talking about the fence\nwith, not iron, but how do you call it, with the needles --",
        "A: Not electric, no, no.",
        "A: Wire, yes, but not electric. Electric, this were afterwards, yeah. But it was enough\nbecause each ten or fifteen meters should stayed another partisan with a gun and only\nlooking for a victim. Yeah, but in order to go in the other side of the ghetto we have to\ncross the bridge and there also it was not convenient to do it because there were also a\nJewish policemen, so we were not afraid of him, but also a Lithuanian armed guy. So\nwhen we went to the other side of the ghetto, so according the small ghetto, it was a big\ncity.",
        "A: We could, but it was not very convenient to meet this armed Lithuanian with a uniform of\nthe old Lithuanian army.",
        "A: Yes, but he could do everything, you know.",
        "A: No, he could --",
        "A: Yes, to find a excuse to do it or without an excuse.",
        "A: To shoot me, to beat me, to do me everything. So, I didn't, for me it was very difficult to\nlook at him even. So I avoid to meet them.",
        "A: Political, eh...",
        "A: I can tell you only what I have seen, in these times I have seen Jewish policemen, and I\nwas told -- so I remember that when we come to the ghetto it should be one or two days\nbefore the 15th of August 1941. We found already Jewish police there. Some of them\nwere occupied by helping to build the fence and some of them were also staying and\nworking some places, the lines. The lines of the stores. There were special stores for\nJewish people, already in the city of Kovno, so maybe they are moved to the ghetto.\nAnyway, there were certain places to deliver food, very small homes, very small at the\nbeginning of the ghetto. So, you can feel, I could feel that somebody is -- we knew that it\nis a committee so that we can feel that someone is taking care, or delivering food.\nSomebody has to do it. And also, the policemen are, they must have more higher degrees\nof commanders and so on, so we knew that it is a certain organization which is\nresponsible for the ghetto and this 100 percent Jewish. But we didn't know how much\nthey can decide, how long, how far. That we couldn't do. I remember that one day it was\nYom Kippur when many people were praying so we saw that from, he is coming a Jewish\nman, his name is Luria (ph), Luria, and he's telling, \"Look we know you are going to\npray. It's very important for you, maybe also for us, but what's more important is you\nhave stopped to do it and everybody who is 1n a certain age,\" he tell them, \"You have to\ncome and to work very, very urgent, because Germans demand I don't know how many\nthousands or so many Jewish workers for their war effort.\" Maybr he told us the\naerodromes (ph), the airports. \"And you have to do it, I'm sorry that I have to interrupt\nyou.\" So, he went from one to another, from one place to another and people really\nstopped pray except the old people or what the kids and went to the work. I don't know if\nthe Germans did it special for Yom Kippur or maybe for them it wasn't -- they did it from\ntheir point of view, but that's what happened. So we couldn't understand that this man,\neverybody shout, \"That's Luria,\" he was, before the war he was a judge. A judge it -- we\nhad not many Jewish judges in Lithuania, so maybe it was one or two, so he was very\nauthoritatic, he were talking in language of orders, explained very short, that 1s so, we\nunderstood that it's from the Committee. We called it a committee, the word Elderstrat\n(ph), we didn't knew yet, but bit by bit we knew it and we have to -- we came to see also\nthe house. It was in the middle of the ghetto, the big ghetto. It was a brown house, two\nfloors, but we didn't call not this Elderstrat, and not Judenrat, but the Commitet (ph), in\nYiddish. Comitet, it means committee. Even till the end. On the other hand, on their\nannouncements, the papers, it was signed Elderstrat or Chairman of the Elderstrat, so and\nso, or Secretary of the Elderstrat, so bit by bit we understand also this term, and I\nremember that in the house of the staff, 1t was two floors, in one room was a certain -- on\na door was hanging a certain announcement, Va'ad (ph) in Hebrew, Va'ad Ziknei\nHa'Eidah (ph), it's old name for the Eldest of Zion. So the eldest of the community it's a\nparaphrase, so in Yiddish Elderstart and also in German and maybe also in Lithuanian, I\nsaw it. So, bit by bit we knew that this was the same thing.",
        "A: Yes, we knew it bit by bit. Nobody come and told us, \"You know, we have a committee\nfrom this day and so on and so on,\" but we knew, of course we knew Dr. Elkous, the\nname. We knew Yaakov Goldberg, we knew Rabbi Shmulker (ph) and maybe others\nknew more. I was only a youngster at this time, so for me it was enough also three or four\nnames, but I knew very much that they are having the rule inside the ghetto. They are\ndelivering places to work, or jobs, better places, worse places and in order to get a good\nplace, you must have what you could -- what you called protection. Protectzia (ph), of\nprotectzieh (ph), in Yiddish. It means to be protected or known by the people who are\ndelivering the works in order to get a better one.",
        "A: It's protection not in the word of a mafia, but if I know that one of the people is working\nin the office of work, Arbeitzampt (ph), or he was my teacher before or maybe a neighbor\nor maybe a friend or relative somehow, so go to him and ask him, \"Here I am, and it's\nvery hard for me to work in this lousy places. Please give me another one.\" And so, it\nhappened that some people were working very hard, some people less, and what's\nimportant that the people who were working hard even could not, or have the possibilities\nto buy something, or change food for clothes, or clothes for food. So, if bad is bad at all,\nif it's good, it's better at all -- more or less everything.",
        "A: When we are talking in the beginning of the ghetto, we feel that we are together in one\nbad position, and we didn't know what we knew afterwards. So, maybe who didn't get a\ngood job were more opposed, and the others was more pro, but we didn't know that we\ncan expect critical, or vital decisions from the Committee, or the Elderstrat. They can\nonly execute orders, this time.",
        "A: More than the opposite.",
        "A: No, I didn't know any of them, nobody.",
        "A: Yes, it was called also aktzion, not the first one. So, we were told to move in a certain\ndirection and it was to where the big ghetto, the Great Ghetto, and at a certain place they\nmade a selection. I don't remember where, probably at the bridge. I don't -- that I don't\nremember, because I was in such situations I -- when I cannot help myself I become very\nintroverted, introverted, till now. But when I decide to do something this other thing. So I\ncannot remember. I remember only one thing, that we moved everybody, all four\nfamilies, four of my family, we crossed the ghetto together with my friend Bora Grodnik\n(ph). He was very upset because he left -- he lost his father. His father was with a beard,\nelderly man, maybe also younger than me today, he lost him and he understood what is\nthe meaning of losing. So he was very upset, but kept himself. And when we crossed on\nthe other side of the ghetto, we come in in the first house of the street on the other side\nand come into a Jewish family to rest or something, or to -- I don't know. They leave,\nthey left -- they allowed us to come in. Maybe somebody -- they gave us maybe water or\ntea, I don't remember, something. I remember even the name. The name was Sefer (ph),\nSefer. The head of the family was a policeman. But it was done like solidarity of Jewish\npeople. \"Something happened, come in, live, relax,\" and so on. After this, I don't\nremember how we found another flat, apartment. That I don't know, but I know that after\nwe were put in another house of the street, Linkura (ph) or Linkuvos (h), yeah, number\n56 together with other families in a wooden house. The house is still staying, one floor, a\nwooden house, and there was our house all the time that the whole family were living\ntogether in the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Many families together and at least we got -- yes we got one room and a half\nof a kitchen together with a family of three men. I forgot now their names. They came\nfrom Memille (ph), and they were talking between them German. We knew them before\nbecause when my father used to go to this area of Memille-Gebeit (ph), it means the\nGerman part of Lithuania. He was staying in a hotel called Shvartze Adler (ph), the Black\nEagle, so he was one of the owners, his wife and a small child. The relations were not\ngood. It beacuse first the kitchen, afterwards also the mess -- we didn't become friends.\nAnd they were living with us until the big action in October 28. And the night after they\ndidn't come back, so we earned, earned their place so now we had one room, a small\nroom, but only we, and more than half kitchen, I think, two thirds of a kitchen. Yes.\nDavidowitz maybe was their name.",
        "A: I saw this but I didn't believe.",
        "A: I saw a smoke. It was at the same time when all the Jewish from the Small ghetto were\ntaken to a big piatza (ph), or place. And after staying there half a day, we were all\nreleased to go home. It was cold in the ghetto. That -- it was like it's a repetition of\naction. Repetition, yes? Repetiton. It means to try how it works and there were many\nrumors why the Council did this action, or maybe, I don't know. Anyway, this time we\ncome back we have seen a big smoke, and there was a rumor that this was hospital. But I\ncould not -- I couldn't understand that somebody is going to burn -- we didn't heard any\nvoices. I remember even now them -- two floors, the color, it was yellow or white, or\ncream white of the -- of this building. So, there were rumors afterwards I heard they were\nburned and everything, but at the beginning I didn't want not to believe, because there\nwere many rumors, and certain types of the rumors were not true. So, I also didn't receive\nthis rumor, so I was not very much touched of this, what I have seen, smoke is smoke.\nOnly afterwards I was told and we also get the detailed information, but it took us several\ndays.",
        "A: Nothing, nothing happened.",
        "A: It was a hospital. I don't know if the staff or the part of the staff and probably all of the\npatients including children were burned there. That I -- maybe I heard this the same day,\nbut I think that I didn't believe, maybe also it's my nature to escape from the reality.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: I was living after we were expelled from the small ghetto, in what we call the Great\nGhetto, it wasn't so great, but, I think we were about -- I was two and half years, two\nyears, or two years -- two and half years, yes. So, in the two and a half years in ghetto,\nwhat we call now the Big Ghetto -- at the beginning I remember that we when we have\nleisure time, and we have some after the work, or it was a time I should not to go to work,\nbecause I was not 17 years. So, I found a certificate from my high school with a picture\nof me that I was born this and this year, this and this month. It means 27 of January 1925,\nit means that till 27th January 1942, I have not to go to work, because it was the\nbeginning --17 years is the beginning of the first work. So, sometimes I did, I went to\nwork instead of other people who paid me. And such arrangement was called, I don't\nknow why, a malach (ph). A malach, it's in Hebrew or Yiddish, angel, and I was told that\nit was used during the period of the Czars that people were afterward with the Army and\nothers could replace them for money, so I did it, and so I could help a little bit my family,\nmyself.",
        "A: Oh, work, usually very hard work, field work, or buildings, and we have to under the sky\n-- it means outside the houses, 1t was winter. We were not -- it was very not convenient,\nunconvinient is also, I wouldn't say the whole truth, in water, in raining, in snowing, in\ncold, and not eaten. We were very hungry all the time, to be in the fresh air, young men,\nso it was no good. So, anyway, to coming back to your first question, several times we\nwent when I had time to go around the ghetto -- not around but in the center -- like to\nmaking a walk with friends or girlfriends. So, some places in the ghetto became like a\npromenade . And as I remember it was around the building of the Elderstrat, or the\nComitet. Why? Because there come many people to -- for their business. To get another\njob, or to move in another house, or to ask for protection, so people met many people\nthere. It was a concentration of people, a big crowd. Some of them were talking politics\nand they were asking for news or talking -- telling or listening for rumors, and there were\nmany, many rumors, good and bad. So, it was a place to coming and I remember also in\nthis times people like to be dressed also well. Not as the time when they went to work, so\nthe impression was that people like to be normal as they can. I remember also during\nthese times it was the beginning of people who were selling some candies, some other\nthings, homemade or other, and that was the beginning of a bigger production of such\nthings in the ghetto. No, the beginning was cigarettes, people need cigarettes, especially\nin such a time of tension. I think that also I begin to smoke. It was a need, or a fashion, I\ndon't remember well. Anyway, we tried to be more and more -- like to be normal. In\nthese times I began also to keep a diary. The beginning I was writing the headline \"Divrei\nHa'Yamim\" (ph). Divre1 Ha'Yamim, its means the events of the days. There is also in the\nBible there is such a name of -- Chronicles it's called or something, so I -- the first I did\nnote all the events was happened with us, with our family, or with the people of the small\nghetto from the beginning of the war till now, and I put also daydreams. I don't remember\nabout school, maybe it was a school, maybe not, because I was in high school, and high\nschool anyway was not in ghetto, but I heard that there are people who are -- not people\nbut youngsters, younger than me, they are attending to schools, and I am not missing too\nmuch because I was -- according for my age I have not to go to school. So I was -- I\nshould be at the age between school and college, let's say. That's it. But on your question,\non the spirit of your question, I remember that people liked and also me, to be nice\ndressed more or less when you came outside the house. Even we were in the middle of\natrocities. That I remember.",
        "A: Oh, the control of our lives, that was to eat, to eat on the table, even though it hungry to\nuse a knife and a spoon, and a thing what we had to. And you greet people on the street,\nand behave more or less as free people, not as prisoners. Because prisoners have to go on\nthe right side of the street, and we had also to greet the German soldiers and of course the\nofficers. So we -- and even to make nice our stars that we have to wore on -- here and on\nthe back, in the same place on the back. So, I remember that people had made it from\nyellow paper but some did it very nice on all their robes, some of silken and some made it\neither nice form, bit by bit, so it was a steady form. Afterwards, the Germans decided\nshoul be very uniformal, that you cannot do what you want, it should be a special size\nand so on, but that I remember the trend, to do what we can.",
        "A: Yes. I don't know -- dignity, this I don't know nobody thinking, but normal.",
        "A: Yes, as part of their guardaroba (ph), I would say.",
        "A: Yes. The social life was to meet old friends from the class, or from the youth movements,\nor new girls and from time to time there were also parties. Some people were keeping\npatiphones. Patiphones its means records or the aparatus. And dancing or singing or --\nand also they worked up this new pairs, from a young boy and a young girl, or it was a\ncontinuation from before the ghetto, or they are beginning a newer one. So --",
        "A: Not yet, after that. I have some. I would say all, or a big part of my sister's girlfriends\nwere very close to me. Same company more or less. After that I had another one till the\nend of the ghetto, and when I went to the forests, in the end of -- when was it? The end of\n1944, in March, I gave her to keep my diary. And till now, I don't know what happened\nto it. Maybe one day it can be found.",
        "A: Regular?",
        "A: Till the big action, or the Great Action which occurred 28th of October 1941, so were\nmany, so nobody was sure what would happen the evening. I remember that this time, I\nremember this chapter 1n the Bible that it will be a time when in the morning you wish it\nto be evening and evening morning. That I remember. Yeah. I was thinking about this\nsentence. But after the big action, so life become more stable and there were no more\nsuch horrible actions, there were deportations. Deportations it's very inconvenient, very\nbad, maybe for hard work. It's not -- it was not surely for deaths. Many people died there,\nbut it happened not direct. So what I was afraid is to be caught to dirty walk. Dirty it's\nmeans not dirty aesthetical, but in a bad place of a walk. For instance, on the aerodrome,\nairport. So there you are walking hard, many hours you have to go, I would say maybe\nfive miles each side by foot, and you have to go and sometime to run because it's a very\nlong, Cologne is going on the way, and some are going fast and some not so. The\nGermans who are watching press that we have to make altogether to go. And what I\ndidn't like was to go and to see the people on the streets. They were so happy I would say\nor glad, how we are looking and then we were looking bad, very bad.",
        "A: Yes, there was about 90 percent of Kovno. Maybe some were Polish, I don't know. But\nthe man in the street. That I could not stand. With the Germans we knew before that that\nis, we were expecting more or less a bad relation. But the others with whom we grew up\ntogether. So, that was terrible for me, and I -- certain time I worked inside the ghetto as a\nhelper of a craftsman in the internal fac -- it wasn't a factory, but a workshop, a\nworkshop. So, he was a very old Ocarpenter, this man, and we heard about him even\nbefore. He was running a factory of furniture, he and his family, so I become his second\nor third driver, assistant. He was not very happy about me because I have -- at this time\nmy hands were not the best and when I have to do something, so I made it not in the best\nway. Anyway, I worked beyond a roof, it was winter so it was not so bad and it was\nwarm there because we took the rest of the wood and put it the stove. At home, it was\nworse. At home we had no wood enough, so sometimes we could -- we took the fences\nfrom around the house and put this in the oven or even furnitures. After they were\nfinished, so I prepared to go outside the house all the time, what I can, and only to come\nin the afternoon, later afternoon, then to have my meal, what's the meal was usually a\nsoup, each time a soup. In this soup they took everything they could, my mother, 1n our\nhouse it was pieces of bread, potatoes, some grasses, of course water, put together with a\nlittle salt and that was the dinner, so-called dinner. After the dinner we went to other\nhouses to listen to songs. Or in certain time, I began to take part in the meetings of a new\nstage of the underground, of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair. It was not far from my house, and that\nwas also a turning point for me. The beginning we were talking of every kind of\nsocialism, democratic socialism, or radical socialism, theoretical things, and what we\nhave to do after the war and what is the best way to become democratic, or undemocratic,\nmany theoretical things. I remember that I prepared also a paper that say of one guy,\nFranz Oppenheimer (ph). Franz Oppenheimer. He was a sociologist. So, I brought it and\nread it or talked it to my other friends, the of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and I\nremember I was shouting, \"Yes I can see immediately that it's not -- it was anti-socialist,\nthis man.\" He was probably a social democrat or something so it was not good for\nHa'Shomer Ha'Tzair that they were still very left. But one day or night, come to me one\nof the friends of the people there, Gita Poger, and she told me, \"I would like to talk to you\nvery secretly. You know we are meeting here, we are talking about political theories.\nThat was good for before war, now we have to do something else. What does it mean? I\nwill not say you but somebody will talk to you and you have to keep it very secretly. Not\nto tell even not your father, not your mother, not your sister.\" I promised. Another time\ncome to me somebody, it was her, and with another girl and she told me, \"Now we there\nwill be a cell. I am the commander of the cell and you the both, the two, are members. I\nwill give you orders and you have to fullfill 1t and also not to -- even if you are thinking\nof another of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair is also involved in these things, you have not to talk\nwith them about this.\" So every time she come with new orders. One day she come and\ndemand that you have to bring her many empty bottles, and here and there and other\nthings. And what was the most dramatical thing that one day she comes with part of a\nrifle. I don't know what it is in English, but it's the part of that -- the shooting part before\nyou have to push it and pull it and everything. I forgot the English name, because I was\nnever a English soldier. So it was -- and she brought it in an old newspaper. It was very\ndangerous, you know, that if for a piece of jewelry, jewel, you could be arrested and shot,\nso that was even dangerous not only for me but for the whole neighborhood. That I\nremember till today and I am meeting her all the time and I remember, \"You, you was my\nhero. I was admiring you how you are doing this.\" And bit by bit we also have lessons\ntelling you how to shoot, only theoretical and topography and about first aid, how to give,\nand how to make estimations of distances and a little Judo and many things. Until we\nheard that the Wilno Ghetto is liquidated and then we also had also newspapers written\nby hand that -- I remember that some of the words was the order of the U.P.O., the\nUnited Partisans Organization in Wilno, or the first proclamation or the other, it was\nincluded in our newspaper. So, it was very, very important for me, for us, to hear such\nthings. If they can do it, maybe we can do it also. So, we were very encouraged from this.\nYou must understand that nobody know -- we were closed like in a zoo. And here 1s\nsomething talking about, resistance, really resistance, not only to sing songs and\nencourage each other. So, it was very important to us and didn't tell no to nobody.",
        "A: Everybody \"she.\" This nice girl.",
        "A: She brought it from others.",
        "A: Yes, yes, of course.",
        "A: The fact is that in the population of the ghetto, in our neighborhood, in our house, also in\nthe organization and the most of the members were not males, but females, girls. Yeah,\ngirls, they were very young, so we can call them girls. So, it was very natural that in such\na cell there was one man, if I am, I hope, with two girls. And I didn't ask questions why.\nIt didn't matter me. She's my major in this thing and I have very willingly to do all of this,\nher orders.",
        "A: No, I didn't ask. No.",
        "A: Yes, the Jewish police did it, but I don't remember in which stage. I know, but not -- I\ndon't remember, those are two things. It was at time for instance in 26th of October 1943,\nfor me it was a critical day, because I lost my family this days. It was deportation to\nEstonia. At that morning, I -- the ghetto was closed. Nobody went to work outside the\nghetto and I got mission, a certain mission to go in another place, to say a parole, a\ncertain parole, I think that I remember the parole, and they sent me again in another\nplace. When they sent me, it was the beginning already of the deportation. And when I\npassed my home, my building where we were living, our residence, I saw that a truck\nstaying near the house and Jewish police and others, I don't remember who, maybe\nLithuanian, or Estonian, or German are coming to take my family. I was passing very\nclose let's say about ten, fifteen meters. They have seen me, I have seen them. My sister\nwas very crying, very crying. My father was saying, in a position, or 1n a stride,\n\"Everything 1s lost.\" He saw me and made such (gesturing). He didn't say it, but, \"What\nwe can do?\" Only my mother she make me a strong wink with her eye. It means, \"Go\naway!\" and that was very, very important for me because yesterday the 26th of October\nwas 51 years after this day, and I was thinking if she would not do it, maybe I would\nbecome again a good son and join the family where they are going. Because I didn't\nexpect that they will be taken, and why? Because several days before, this my\ncommander come to me and asking me, \"I would like to know the names of your father,\nyour mother, and your sister and others in your family and the name of the identity cards,\nnumber,\" and so on. Maybe she told me or I understood that the families of the\nunderground people will be defended. So, when I saw that also they are taking I was\nshocked. I was shocked, shocked twice, so maybe this agreement that maybe was done\nwith the Elderstrat, with the authorities through the ghetto, didn't work, or maybe another\nthing, so that's a puncture. To think that my family they are taken so what makes the\ndecision for me to go further, was this movement by the eye, a wink to the eye of my\nmother, that mother, Bluma Levin, born in Wigoda. She did it and it give me a motivation\nto go farther and even not to look back. So, I went to the place I have to go. It was in a\ncertain building. It was called Blocktzai (ph), means Blocktzey (ph). And there I had to\nsay a certain parole. \"I want\" -- the parole was, \"I want to sleep here at night.\" In Yiddish\nit (speaking Yiddish), so the answer was, I don't remember, but now I'm coming to the\nyour main question, I put it already together that in this day -- before this house was\nstaying a policeman, his name was Daniel Billard (ph). He was a known policeman\nbecause before the war he was a very known box-man. Maybe he asking me the question\nor another man, so then I realized that the police or at least a part of the police is working\nin cooperation with the -- with the underground. That makes me also a good feeling. And\nafterwards, I was told to go to the cellar. I went -- a cellar. After I come to the cellar, they\nopened a door on the ground -- no the ground was with ashes or something or small\nstones. So, somebody took away the stones and told me to, \"Go there.\" I fell. I think that I\nfell. So, I remember that some hands catched me and pulled me down and what it was\ndark, dark, very dark. I can only fell --only see some fires of cigarettes. Very in silence,\nevery half an hour was an order, move here, move there, or who wants to eat, who wants\nto go to the toilets. I don't know which -- I don't remember which arrangements they\nmade. Who wants to smoke, who wants drink. One like with a chain. I am telling them\nand he is telling the other and so on and so on and a certain moment we felt that a noise,\nanoise, and somebody knocking on the iron cover of the cellar, \"Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta,\" and\npeople are calling and answering, maybe they are going to catch us and somebody telled\nthem. They are still looking for people for deportation because in this day, many were\nhiding with me, but we made it an organized form. So, I felt myself better. I don't\nremember if somebody had arms or not, but I felt so secure and so good that somebody 1s\ntaking care on me. And really, after a few minutes, everything settled maybe and silent\nagain. We were not -- I don't know because I don't remember if I looked of -- in my\nwatch. I have yet my watch. My watch that I get -- I received as a bar mitzvah. And when\nwe had to come out it was already evening. In October the evening began early like now.\nAnd we were told that now everybody is going for a while with family, \"You are free but\nyou have to come back very soon. Maybe this night we are leaving the ghetto.\" Leaving\nthe ghetto, it means to the forest. I become again very happy. So, I went to home, home\nwas empty without people, without my parents, without my sister, nothing. And I have\nseen that some -- the neighbors, next door neighbors of my family by the name of Feen\n(ph) they were very surprised to see me, \"How come you back?\" because they were sure\nif my family was taken so also me. And they gave me some to eat and to drink. We were\nnot in the best relations, but now we become very close. But I realize that many things\nare not in the same place, so maybe my family took it, or maybe they took it, I don't\nknow. But it was for me -- I didn't care because if I are leaving the ghetto this night it's\nfor me all the same, and I took some sandwiches they gave me. I didn't tell them, but I\ntold them that I will not more live here in this place. I'm going away. Maybe they\nunderstood, maybe not. And when I come back to the place of concentration, 1t was in\nanother hiding place on Stesbolyu (ph) so we were told that this night nothing will\nhappened and we have to stay. We have to stay, so we decide to not to go more home.\nBecause what's home? Home without parents is no home, or sister, no home. So, I was\nnot the only one who was in such a situation. There were more, three, four, five, six. I\ndon't remember. So, we stayed in the same place and we sleep in the same place. We\nmade arrangements to sleep. It was not in a cellar but under a roof of a small building.\nSo, it was space for everybody and actually this was the beginning of a collective or a\nkibbutz, if you want, of a part of a members of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair and the others.\nCollective or kibbutz I don't remember the name but that was the reality.",
        "A: I think 25 but not everybody were left without parents. Some of them prepared to be there\ntogether. You know, the feeling to be together it make also the people stronger. Together,\ntogether, only to be, to be. Now only some hours ago we were saved together, now we\nwill live together. Maybe we will have to go to the forest together. Nobody knows.",
        "A: I didn't get your question.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: What do you need? It was a part of the parole, 1t was a question and a answer. More or\nless, what do you need? I told him I --.",
        "A: The policeman was a uniformed policeman asked me a question that probably it was a\npart of the parole, the first part, \"What do you need?\" So my answer was, \"I need here to\nfind a place for sleep this night.\" In Yiddish it sounds other (speaking Yiddish), or\n(speaking Yiddish). So then, he understood and he showed me where to go in the cellar.\nYeah. And afterwards, there was many such cases that an open cooperation between the\npolicemen and the organization, but sometimes this policeman also to fulfill orders for\nthe Judenrat, for the Elderstrat in order to deport people and so on. The policeman who\ntook part of expelling or of deporting my family, I remember very good, because\nafterwards he was also a part of our organization. It was not in the middle of the\norganization, but he used to come to our kibbutz, what we called, and I told him, \"You\nknow you are the man that took my family.\" So he told me, \"Oh, why didn't you didn't\nsay that?\" I'm not sure that if I would say him thats could help but what happened to him,\nhe also perished afterwards.",
        "A: I know many, but I remember very, very significant thing. When I have to leave -- not\nwhen I have, when I was allotted to leave the ghetto with all the ammunition and\neverything, at March 1944 at night through the gate of the ghetto, so at the gate of the\nghetto were some people who were staying there all the time, all the -- even before and\nafter, including they were some policemen, and they knew we were not going as it was\nreported by one of us that we are going outside like a team of work in the woods, but we\nare going to fight with partisans. At this moment I saw also that these tremendous\ncooperations and the one moment the lights, it was electric were off. It was very dark, so\neven the German soldier or watchman could see something so it happens so that the\nconditions become very bad for realize who is who. And that was done with a policeman\nthere. Maybe there were more than one. Not only policeman, but also some officers of\nthe Judenrat or Elderstrat. They were staying day and night at the gate and controlling the\npeople who come to work and again and back, especially the people from Arbeitzant\n(ph), it was a work department. So, that I was sure -- so that I also saw, not that I only\nknew. Probably I was -- I knew about this before, 1t were rumors that somebody is going\nto help us and they had helping. We knew this, but here I saw myself.",
        "A: Yes. No, but I was very encouraged. I didn't think too much of this. I was one step\noutside to the ghetto to the forest, so it's like going from the hell to paradise.",
        "A: Not something. I was a private.",
        "A: Yes, so that was very natural everything I did -- even I didn't remember them. But what I\nremember that I took all this very, very, very seriously to fill out well done job because\nit's a holy thing and I am devoted for this. Yes -- I was thinking that after all this, no --\nthis organization belongs, maybe everybody belongs to this organization and there\nsomewhere 1s sitting general staff, with maps and everybody's giving orders and they\nknew much better than me so I only have to full fill.",
        "A: What I have done, I remember I brought bottles, another day I brought also to bring\nmoney. Bring money.",
        "A: So I tried to sell something from a house and instead to buy bread or other food, I give it.\nOr to go from one place to another place, or maybe to also steal some things for this\norganization. I remember now, lamps, electrical lamps, even used, they told to collect\nthem and I knew that it's for make small bombs or grenades, primitive. Such things.",
        "A: If you're asking me if I think, no.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: At the time I didn't know. Nobody told me because people doesn't -- didn't tell too much\nbecause that can be -- that can be dangerous for somebody if it would be found, nobody\nknows if it's good for him or for his family and maybe it's also not good because now his\nfamily will know -- so, no, it was very, very privately.",
        "A: Yes, a lot. For him it was very easy because he --.",
        "A: Avraham Tory, that his former last name was Golup (ph) and he was the secretary of the\nJudenrat or Elderstrat, according my knowledge, for him it was very easy to keep a diary\nfor one side many, many information and also documents. He had sometimes only to\ncopy them in the -- put in his diary. On the other side he should have had more places to\nhide them because everybody knows that he's writing and that it was for his daily work,\nso he had not to be so keeping in silence because nobody would interfere with him.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: So change the word parole and password.",
        "A: So, the policeman who were a very close to the entrance on their Block C or Block Tze\n(ph) as we called it, I knew him before. I knew even his name. His name was Daniel\nBillard (ph) and his question was (speaking Yiddish), 1t means, what do you need here? I\nunderstood I knew it before that this is the beginning of a password, we called it parole.\nSo, the answer on this password, or the parole was, \"We have -- we get here or we have\nhere to sleep this night.\" In Yiddish it sounds (speaking Yiddish) mir or I, I don't\nremember well, anyway to sleep here, so he was satisfied because this was the true parole\nand he let me in to come and maybe show me also the way to go inside or in the cellar\nthat I don't remember very good but afterwards somebody opened a cover on the ground\nand they also to put away the stones that were under this cover and I felt that I am falling\ndown, down, down, until several hands caught me and they bring me to a place to a\ncertain room. It was dark there, that what I remember.",
        "A: At that time, we knew that we are not the only, that the other groups were organized. We\ncalled them several names one name was the Communist or the Mushtas (ph), because of\nJoe Stalin. Ofdevantzes (ph), or Coatkes (ph), Coatkes means short jackets, overjackets,\ncoats, but short. But we knew that they doesn't belong to us, they belong to the left-left\nand some of them we knew even before the ghetto. Some change their places, come from\nthe Zionists to the Communists and why? Because as we understood, they are more than\nwe. They are a lot. And one of them it was very known his name was Chaim Yellin (ph).\nHe was a very known figure even in all the ghetto, even outside the organization. We\nknew also or maybe we had the feeling that they has the best connections outside with the\npartisans and probably I was told, probably it was my feeling, but we knew that they are\nthe prominent people in the organization or their organization 1s more important than\nours in the terms of communication with outside. We knew the partisans can be only\nSoviet partisans because other partisans will not deal with us. And if Soviet partisans, it's\nCommunists, so again, so they felt themselves very strong in the ghetto even to be a\nCommunist in this time was very dangerous for the Germans and for the Lithuanians\nbecause several times they were looking after such people in order to arrest them and to\nkill them. But in the ghetto it was like in autonomy everybody could -- it was like a big\nshelter in terms of politics. So, they felt themselves very good and very secure. Even\nmore when we had to go to the forest, so it was a rumor between us that they are having a\npreference to go and also their girls, or girlfriends, or wives will get a better -- a better\nposition, or they had not to wait so long as our girls. And I will not forget one thing that\none of our girls, were organized in Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzai, we were living this time already\nin a communa, in the collective, it was -- the name was Mildos (ph) 7, because the street\nwas Mildos and the number of the house was 7. So it was called Milda 7 everybody, not\neverybody, but many knew that that belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair. The Communists\nhave also their house not far from us and also ABC, Abetze (ph) Irgun L'Tzion (ph) has\ntheir house. So, the developments of all the houses was similar. People were alone\nwithout parents, without families, decide to live together and it was also convenient for\nthe organization. Everybody can catch all his -- all their members at one time and they\nhave control and they can also hide their arms and make training with arms, so it was\ngood for everybody. So, I'm coming back to one of our girls which belonged to\nHa'Shomer Ha'Tzair, her name was Rosa, Rosa. She was already taken to the gate in\norder to be included in a group -- I don't remember the number of the group -- going by\ntruck to the forest. She was taken away at the last moment, and instead her was put in a\ngirl of the -- what we called them Communist and they are calling no or even the ghetto\nthey have a cover name. It was called Anti-Facists Fight Organizations. So, they have a\npreference and when we come, I come to the forest I found a lot of people who belonged\nto their organizations and of -- from us were only I think eleven or twelve with one, only\none girl. For girls 1t was generally more difficult. It's because the high command of the\npartisans is Ruditsky, or Rudniky for us, demand they give preference for men, male\ngood who trained not with revolvers but with long rifles, long rifles mean long arms and\nbetter males than females. The ghetto organization had another pressure to do what they\ndemand. So, it all the time were compromise, here, there. Anyway, the last decision that -\n- the factor let's say, was that most of the girls, Jewish girls and these detachments, and I\nam talking about the detachments, Kovno detatchments in the Ruditsky Forest which was\ncalled this to the German occupants that most of the girl did belong before to the\nCommunist circles or what was called Anti-Facist Fighter Organizations, that is.",
        "A: The Zionist organizations, and there are several, one of them it was very big, it was --",
        "A: The Zionist organizations, and I am talking mostly about their underground organizations\nbecause there were many organizations like parties, but they belong to more adult people,\nbut talking about the youth movements, the Zionist youth movements of -- in the Kovno\nGhetto, we are talking about three main organizations. It Irgun Brei Tzion (ph),\norganization of bright young braves, any way now we would call them general Zionist. It\nincluded also religious Zionists, liberal Zionists and so on, that's one. The other was what\nI mentioned before Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair with the time where we\ncoordinated with Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair, or Dror (ph). It was more or less also ideological\nvery close. So they afterwards established the collective of the kibbutz together. What I\nmentioned Mildos Sheva (ph), Mildos 7 was together. I would call it in one word the --as\nit means the labor camp of the Zionists.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Thirty year old, they're very on the border.",
        "A: Continue, or come back to describe -- maybe it's too complicated what I'm talking about.",
        "A: I am coming to this, but first of all, it's important to describe who they are, who they\nwere. So, we are talking about underground in Kovno Ghetto, maybe also other\nghettos,we are talking mostly about young people. Young people it means maybe from\n15, 16 till 30. If they were more,they were exeptions. And I will tell you who were the\nZionists. They were divided into three or four groups. They were the general Zionists and\nthe organization was called Abetze, Irgun Brei Tzion (ph). In this organization were also\nincluded some of religious Zionists, Bnei Akiva (ph). After -- the other was Ha'Shomer\nHa'Tzair, and they with a time unified with the Dror or Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair. It also left\nworkers' organization. They were very, very close ideologically, and they established the\ncollective or the kibbutz called Mildos Sheva (ph), Mildos 7. Sheva, it means seven in\nHebrew. We used very much to talk Hebrew also in the ghetto. Therefore I am\nmentioning sheva, so it's important; it reminds me. The other group was Beitar. Beitar\nand other people were incorporated in this ideology that's three. And probably we can\nalso include to this organizations Brit Tzion (ph), were adult people let's say from 30 till\n60 or more. It was an organization who helped the Abetze, who were young people. So, if\ntalking about young people about the really underground organization who were prepared\nto do more or less everything then we are talking about organizations. The ABC, Abetze,\nnot ABC, Irgun Brei Tzion, Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair and Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and Beitar --\nthey were very involved in the life of the ghetto because their establishment of the ghetto\nwas also Zionist. If you will take Dr. Elkous and his deputy of the Elderstrat, Leib\nGarfunkel (ph) and the others were former activists or top members or leaders of the\nZionist organizations in Kovno before the war. So, it happen so also the staff of the\nElderstrat in all of officer were sitting people more Zionists than all the others. So that it\nwas natural that they could help with many things their organization, the underground\norganization, with money, with means, with transportation, and what's most important,\nwith covering them. I mean, the police. The Jewish Ghetto Police. I remember that our\norganization, also we sent some of our members to be organized in the police in order\nthat they can help us, they can tell us what is going and so on and so on. Even there was\none, two, or four people who belong to the Communist organization who also sent to\nserve in the police, in the Jewish Police in the ghetto. Anyway, the partition of work\nbecame so, or it happened without our planning so our planning was the Zionist\norganization were more active in the ghetto because they are close to the Elderstrat, they\nknow many things they can get help on the other side. The Communist, the Anti-Facist\nFight Organization they have very good connections with the outside, with the partisans,\nwith the Communists outside the ghetto. And so it was a very good combinations\nbetween the two big parts, contra parts of one big organization with that they should have\none roof in a certain place it was called, in a certain time it was called the MTC it means\nMilitary Technical Commission.",
        "A: Oh, it was in 1943, in this time when the topic of going to the forest was very, very -- had\nbecome very hot. So, it was natural and it was also coordination between the two big\nparts. It was a coordination until a certain point. For instance, who will go if it will be in\neach group? Each group, a certain group is able to take 20 people, who will be the 20? So\nit -- maybe it was a key, it was called a political key or organizational key, 15 from this\nside and 5 from this side, and if girls, so the most girls were from the Communist and we\ntook it for granted that it cannot be others, this is, and they were begging, I don't know\nhow it was done but we could feel 1t and even when I have to go, so I could not go with\nothers, I have to wait. I remember there was a group which left before me from\nHa'Shomer Ha'Tzair and Ha' Chalutz Ha'Tzair, they left, I guess, in January 1944. I have\nto wait another two months. It was also a question with rifle. Who will give me a rifle. I\ncannot go in the street and buy it. So, I decide very easily to sell my watch, my hand-\nwatch, I remember even the firm, it was Tiso (ph). I saved it for bar mitzvah for my\nUncle Moses and I gave it to a certain man. He brought me money, I give the money my -\n- the activist of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, I remember the name, his name was Eli Rausuk\n(ph), and one day he told me, \"It's settled. When you go, you will go with a rifle.\" Of\ncourse I was very happy. Other things like boots, high boots, because without high boots\nyou cannot go to the forest. It's like arms. He went with me this guy, Eli Rausuk, like a\nbig brother or like a father, until we got two good boots fit for my legs, for my feet. And\nafterwards, he went with me to a tailor in order to make for me an overcoat also, half to\nhere, because you cannot go with a long coat in the forest and so on and so on. And also\nequipment and everything. He went with me mostly to the workshops in the ghetto. Also,\nthe management of the workshop was helping the partisan organizations, and the\ncoordination, we understood that it was made in the high level between the management\nof the workshops the organization -- underground organization and somebody in the\nElderstrat or the Judenrat. Anyway, when I went to the forest, I was very good equipped.\nAlso, with cigarettes and tobacco and with underwear and with a rugsack, a sack to put\nmy things, a raincoat and even with a white shirt, no not shirt, a white -- you know, in\norder to -- a white manufacturer, I would -- in order to use it when we are going in an\narea of snow so we could very nice to make all camouflage. It was -- they did the best.\nThey did the best, and it also give me a very good feeling that somebody 1s taking care on\nme because I was alone, without family, without nothing. And I have also to mention a\nparty before this in our collective, singing songs and drinking even vodka but of course\nthey told we have to accustom ourselves to the life in the partisans. And I remember one\nor two people come from the forest, from the groups who left before and come to make\nus -- to give us instructions how to behave. With arms and with other things, and also\nhow to use a password, we called it a parole. And some was in Russian, not everybody\nknew the Russian language. We knew more or less, but in order not to be lost, and also\nthat a good partisan must to drink vodka, not to be an exception. He have to accustom\nhimself with all the life. And they gave us a lot of advice. How to handle when it happens\nso, and when it happens so, what to do, and afterwards these two guys took us to the\nforest and they become our guides.",
        "A: After the 26th of October 1943 when we meet a big number of the organizations, not one,\nmet together in the hideout, in the Block C after we could make lights in the evening, so\nwe saw many people I know one body, somebody knew me but we're from different\norganizations. And from then, it was no more secrets. We kept other secrets, where we\nwere hiding, arms and so on and some but the belonging to the organization was no more\nsecret. Of course we kept many things, when we are going, and other things, and our\ndestination, our direction, even we didn't know exactly, only the last two days we were\nkept in a certain place, and then we get the last instructions. From there we could not go\nback home. It wasn't home it was a kibbutz, no more, and then we were given, very secret\nthings that if you are lost and you are alone what do you have to do.",
        "A: Oh, I will never forget it in my life, because I-- our coming out was postponed several\ntimes and we become -- I would say, nervous or maybe it will not fulfilled because it was\nlike a dream, like a dream, and a good dream. So one or two or some hours we have to\nwait again and to come again. I don't know what happened and why, but I trust the\norganization like it would be God, for a religious man. So, 1t comes the moment when\nthey call, \"Okay, now you have to go to the tracks.\" They prepared us, I think, with\nnumbers that not altogether will climb, and so it will not make disorder there. So, on the\ntrack, I saw two soldiers, German soldiers with uniform, maybe they belong to the police\nor Wehrmacht. After a few minutes I realize these are two from our group, and they make\nlike they would be our escorts. So, I had really to admire organization. If they are so\nclever, so sophisticated that they can prepare everything, so I hope it will be everything\ngood. And we heard that somebody's asking questions at the gate, police or other and\nthen at certain times electricity was short, closed in order to make that nobody can watch\nus and so on and somebody was asking, \"Where are you going?\" so another voice\nanswer, \"Yes, these men are going to work in the brigade of Baptai (ph),\" a certain place\nwhere Jewish use to work there, hard work. And we moved. They all begin to walk and\nwe felt more than happy, but in a certain place not far from the ghetto the truck was\nstopped. What happened? We have to be very quiet. Not to questions or nothing, and\nwhat's important, not to take with us things that can make evidence that we were Jews\nfrom the ghetto, other Jews. For example, I have to leave the pictures from my family and\nfrom me of course, many things and not one word written in Yiddish. If I would be\nreligious so I could not take with me , no, nothing. So I'm coming again\nwhen the truck stopped and we hear again voices, here and there, talking Lithuanian,\ntalking Russian. After a few moments somebody saw a big sack with -- that was about\nten or fifteen rifles. I don't remember how it was -- how I get one of them, but I did and\nby this moment or maybe before, we had a commander and a comissar, it was political\ncommander. No, I think the commander was one of the people who should be our guide\nto the forest, because he came several times there and here and he knows, and should\nknow every stone on the highway. So, in certain moment he told us, \"Now you are taking\noff your red stars and putting them in a certain place,\" or maybe eating them -- I don't\nremember, and he told, \"Now you are partisans.\" We have guns. We have maybe hiding\nin certain places because it also can be against us if somebody is coming to make a\nsearch, but maybe not because we have all our rifles and now we can now do something,\nwe can defend ourselves. So, we went very far about 40 or 50 miles and you have to\nstand up and then we have to stand in a line and we were walking by foot. To put our\nwhite shirt or lining, I don't know how to call it in English, big white things, we put it so\nthey -- we could not be very easy watched because this area was with snow and we went,\nand we went, and many miles and we had heavy packs with us. We also have not private\npacks but things to take for the forest, for the bases, maybe a radio, maybe other things,\nmaybe medicaments for the small hospital that we had in the forest, maybe other things,\nmaybe it calls for -- I don't remember but it was very heavy to go. I remember some of\nthe people collapsed on the way.",
        "A: Oh, we were a very big group, I think 28, and we have --",
        "A: Men and women and we have -- I remember everybody has a gun, two have machine\nguns, and one has an automatic rifle, that's called a sedete (ph) in the Russian terms. Even\nthe girls had guns, yes. And also it was heavy to have the gun and the pack. So, at night\nwe come to a place in a certain village, and we were told that we have not to go in only\none -- everybody in one house not in the middle of the village but in the side. Excuse me,\nit was not -- it was at day. At night we have to go, to go and to go and to go. At day, we\ncome to a certain house like a farm, let's call it farm. So everybody come to this farm we\nweren't allowed to leave. Till the evening, we have collected about twenty people. So it\nwas a neighbor come to see his neighbor. \"You are very nice, you are our neighbor but\nyou cannot leave.\" You know, it is because he cannot go and tell the police, and others.\nNobody 1s leaving. Afterwards come his wife to look after him. What is he doing, my\nhusband. Maybe he's drinking or maybe other things, so she come also. \"You will stay\nwith your husband.\" Sometimes you saw kids, and so on and so on. As evening, a lot of\npeople with us, and at this time some of us could relax and to sleep by a certain order.\nSome were staying with the rifle and hand radio that everything can't happen. And so we\nmake it like two or three days until we come to the forests. Yes, and before we come to\nthe forest we have to cross a very critical point. It was a railway. The railways were very\nwatched by the Germans because it was a very strategic thing. Anyway we have to make\noperation to send people here and there and to watch the Germans will not come here,\nand we did it. After that we have to cross a highway. Also, more or less the same tactic\nand then we were told now we are in the partisan area. Partisan area. Also, we have to go\nwith the arms, but you feel yourself to be more free, not be in tension so much more. But,\nfor me it was another tension. If we are already in the kingdom of the partisans, so it's the\ntension of be proud of, joy, to be glad, to be happy, you can use many words for this.\nSometimes I have seen signs on trees, heavy trees with swamps around them and\nsometimes we have to go on a very narrow tree which was lying. So, as it moved like in a\nstory, or films that we have seen about the partisans after the October revolution in\nRussia or other places, and we have seen sometimes on the trees signs red, or white, or\ntogether so I was sure that it's for us, somebody put this for us. I was so trusting of the\norganizations, the partisans, not more of the organization of the ghetto. It was another\nauthority for me. So, I was very high there, like I was took drugs. One moment we saw a\nman with a big, full hat, a Papacha (ph) it's called, of Siberia, with an automatic arm and\nhe told us a password, in Russian parole. He didn't know, but our guys they knew, before\nthey told him so he come smiling to us, \"You're partisans,\" and he shook hands with\neverybody. But we have to go farther and farther, and we were exhausted, especially the\ngirls and we have also weak people. Some people are very strong outside but here it was\na hero who can make the way can also be a . Until we come to our bases. In\nour bases also we have to pass a guard but this guard was already one that we know from\nthe ghetto, our man. Now also, we were kissing everybody and he had to leave us and to\ntold that the group came from the ghetto. He himself could let us come inside. He did it,\nhe went, and the other was watching us, it must be. And afterward come the commander\nof the attachment and invited us all with greetings, \"Now you can come in, you can\ncome.\" And that was a big celebration. Everybody was asking me what happened with\nmy uncle, with my girlfriend, and so on, the other thing, \"Have you tobacco?\" or maybe\nit was the first question. I was very large and everybody I gave my tobacco so tomorrow I\nhave nothing to smoke for myself. But it was a very, very, very happy meeting, until its\ncome to a finish and everybody has another friend to ask look we have other music it's\nnot so nice, it's very hard to be a partisan and that already perished and that were already\ntaken as prisoner of war by Germans and we knew what it means to be in prisoners a\nGerman, and partisan, and even a Jew, and that sometimes there are anti-Semitic\nincidents even between the partisans and so on and so on. But we were talking half the\nnight until we asleep.",
        "A: This time, and we are talking about March, 1944, and detachments of\nto the occupants in Russian it's so it can be\ntranslated \"Death to the occupants or the conquerors,\" in English. So, it was a mixed unit\nfrom two or five or three paratroopers, they were the nucleus of this detachment.\nLithuanian, or Russian, people before Communists and they were parachuted into the\nforest in order to establish this detachment. A big part were former prisoner of wars,\nRussian, who escaped from their camps, P.O.W. camps. And a big part, I think in the\nbeginning the people of the ghetto made about 60, if not more percent, coming more and\nmore and more till a day what from the ghetto nobody could no more join us for internal\nthings that happened in the ghetto, so this turning point afterward we become less and\nless and less.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I have, yes. First at all, I heard the word ours and yours. What does it mean? For me\neverybody was now somebody very close. We are fighting together, and there, ours and\nyours. And I've seen that also they are living in the same -- incertain concentration of\nJewish partisans and un-Jewish, not formal, but de-facto. So, I have another example.\nOne of our guys, he was, he come really with us. A nice boy, a tall boy, he was dead\nbecause he ate too much. He was hungry too much and something happened to his\nstomach and he passed away so we buried him. So, what happened, it comes only the\ncommissar and made a speech, \"Ta, ta, ta, ta,\" and from the fighters they are not only\nJewish fighters. That's what happened. There were other things, but I'm not sure if 1t was\nanti-Semitism or not, some partisans, Jewish partisans, were shot by their comrades on\nthe way to a certain missions. They came without them and told a story there that was\nvery suspicious.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: I was till the first week of July 1944, and then --",
        "A: I was in the forest, or better, in the Rudniky Forest, as partisan till July 1944, the 9th of\nJuly we heard the thunder of the big guns, the artillery, the Katusha of the Red Army, or\nthe Soviet Army, so we knew that -- and we knew also from other sources from radio or\nso, that the Red Army or the Soviet Army is coming back to this area. So, we were told\nalso we will go like to help the big army to help them to liberate Wilno because Wilno\nwas very close to us about 20 miles or so. But then happened a certain event that was for\nus, for me personally, very important. The 9th of July early in the morning come to us a\ngirl partisan from the Wilno detachment which were located not far. We were all the\ntime, we had, I would say, unlegal relations. She was also from Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair. She\nwas sent by Abba Kovner (ph). Abba Kovner was the commando of the Wilno\ndetachment. Her name was Ruska Kolchak (ph), a very known partisan. She told -- came\nhalf secretly to us and told us, \"You have to go now as we are doing, you will come to\nWilno, but when you come, in Wilno, please don't leave the place. You will be in a new\norganization with the aim of to go immediately by all means we can to Palestine.\" And\nwe were -- it was very logical for us and it was not big surprise and we left the forest and\nwe come to Wilno and then was the beginning of a new organization. Afterwards, this\norganization gets the name Bricha (ph), it means escaping. And I was working for the\narchives of the internal ministry of Soviet Union, it's called Ainkavede (ph), yes. I was\nvery proud that they took me. They took me because I knew several languages and I was\nintelligent. So, I attended high school, so they took me, and I was working there. One of\nmy jobs was to make use from the material the Germans left, papers. And I did it with\npleasure because I found them very interesting material, even some reports from the\nGermans made on our activity of my detachments. We also found list of names of\nLithuanian soldiers and policemen who took part in killing Jewish people, so I was again\nvery happy that I can do some important thing. But at the same time, we were building\nanother unlegal organization to go to Palestine. And one of this was to prepare false\ndocuments to go by train or by buses -- not buses but by tracks or by foot or by any\nmeans to go to Chernovtsy, it means in Bucovina in the south, southwest of Ukraine.\nFrom there to smuggle the border to Romania and there we were told maybe that we can\nfind a ship and go to Palestine. That's close enough. From Kovno, or from Wilno to\nBucuresti was about 1,000 kilometers, it's 900 miles. So, we did it bit by bit man after\nman. I left Wilno, I left my job, I left Wilno, I left my arms, with a girlfriend from the\nghetto, with her small sister like we are a family. I am the father, she is the mother and\nthe small sister is our daughter. It makes less dangerous for us. We get also a card, how to\ngo from which place to which place, to whom to apply and what will be our passports.\nAnd we did it. And for instance, I left Wilno I think the 19th of January 1945. It means a\nhalf year after I left the forest. I didn't want to come back to Kovno because I hate Kovno\nbecause every man in the street was a killer of my family or other of my friends. Wilno\nwas for me more neutral, for me personally, and the other thing that we were told also not\nto go far because if somebody needed us and I had the opportunity to go and our train\nwas to leave very fast this country, this lousy country of anti-Semitism and killers and all\nthe bad things that I suffered, not only me but our whole communities, whole generation.\nSo, we went to Wilno to Minsk, from Minsk to Baranovichi, I'm talking about\nByelorussia. From Baranovichi to Koval, from Koval to Volpe. In each place we found a\nman he some give us to eat, sometimes also to sleep. Sometimes we slept outside on a\nroof of a wagon, but we did it and in Lvov it is Galicia or west Ukraine, then we met with\nsome girls partisans we can call them liaison officers, L-I-A-S-O-N, so one of them, I\nremember was Zelda, she was also, she did such a job also between Wilno ghetto and the\nforests and we went -- and we were sleeping in the Jewish library of Lvov, on the ground,\nby there were two -- were several people, more and more and they have to go farther. So\nwe heard one day that Chernovtsy one of the groups were caught and put into the prison.\nIf so, the way is closed to that and we were talking it's burned. If so, we have to go to\nchose an alternative road. I even was sent for a while to other places in the south, to\nStansislav, it's also the area of Ukraine, in order to make sure what happened in\nChernovtsy because -- anyway I come back to Lvov, Lvov it's Lemburg, so I give a\nreport and we decided to go straight from Lvov to Poland. To go to Poland we have to\ntake new documents that we are Poles. So we made it, we crossed the border and the next\nday we were in a city called Pshemysl, or Peremyshl. There we also have to wait for\nseveral weeks, two weeks or three weeks and we made also a new kibbutz. We are living\ntogether and tried to go farther, also to make new documents because we didn't talk\nPolish. In Lithuania, the Jewish people, our generation, doesn't understand Polish. Even\nnot to talk, and if you are talking, everybody will see that we are foreigners and that was\nvery dangerous because we escaped from the Soviet Union and that only traitors are\ndoing or enemies of the people and so on and so on. They will catch us and they will send\nus to Siberia, 1f not to shoot us. So, we went from Pshemysl to Zeshev (ph). In Zeshev we\ndid a very fine thing. We went to the commander, or chief office of the county governor,\nStarosta (ph), Polish, and we told him that we are partisans who were from Greece and\nhave to go to our country back. And we were talking between us Lithuanian. A little bit\nof Yiddish and we -- the rabbi of Zeshev, he knew the truth and he was translator. Before\ncoming to this man, the governor, we make on our hands numbers like we were prisoners\nof Auschwitz or other places. We do it with very easy ink, the next day we could take it\noff. And we showed, \"You see?\" He told, \"Here are the people.\" And we showed, \"Here.\"\nSo he gave us immediately, he was a very nice man, \"Oh Greece, good.\" It was an\nincident he would -- he want that we will meet a really group from Greece and so we\nwere very afraid they will recognize that we are not. So, we said, \"No, we are very tired\nand we have to go immediately.\" He gave us documents and we went. From Zeshev to\nTransylvania, it means already Romania. Cluj, Klausenberg, from Cluj we took express\ntrain to Bucuresti because Bucuresti was former Romania and we trust that from\nBucuresti we can go to Constanta to the port and then to take a ship to go to Palestine.\nBut in Bucuresti probably the KGB or other services were following us. And we have to\nmove, we have to move and we heard that in Italy is a Jewish brigade from Palestine so\nthat could be a good way we thanks them to come. So we did. And after being three\nmonths in Bucharest, also we were living in kibbutzim, oh, we were very -- not only from\nLithuania also from Poland and Czechoslovakia and other places everybody was safe to\nremember that that is the best way to go to Palestine, but only for us former citizens from\nSoviet Russia, because Lithuania was a part of Soviet Russia, was so dangerous. So we\ndecided we are going to Italy so we went back from Bucuresti to Cluj from Cluj to\nBudapest, from Budapest to Chambatoy (ph), from there to Saltzburg, that means\nAustria. In Austria we have to cross the border again to the area which belonged to the\nBritish Army, means Italy. Also we have again to cross the border and we were arrested\nseveral times by the Russians, patrols, and they took us here and took us back and\neverytime we have another story. In each pocket we have another document, other\nnames, and we have to remember all the names all the nicknames, everything. So, we\ncome to Italy. Italy we come to Tarviso (ph), it's on the border between Italy and Austria.\nWe came the 15th or 14th of July 1945, and that was a big, big festival. What happened,\nmany leaders from the survivors come there then we met Mr. Garfunkel, who was a\nmember of the Elderstrat, and he was so nice received by the soldiers. Some of them\nwere from Lithuania who emigrated to Palestine many years ago. They knew he was a\nvery prominent man. Afterwards was Abba Kovner from Wilno, and maybe also Tzivia\n(ph) -- no, Tzivia we met on the way. Anyway, it was a big, big festival now, and from\nthere we have yes, and Abba Kovner sent me for another emissary back to the Russians\nin order to show -- to be a guide for three soldiers from the Jewish brigade who want to\ngo back to their homes. I don't know if they deserted for a certain time or get permission,\nbut he was sure that if I made the way several times I know. I didn't know, but I did it. I\ndidn't know the way, but somehow I did it and come back. When I come back I told more\nI will not go. I would like to come here to Palestine and finish with all the tasks. Iam a\nprivate man now, so I was put in another kibbutz of young people with the supervision of\nJewish soldiers in Mestre (ph), Mestre it very close to Venice, and we spend there a very\nnice Rosh Hashana, in the ghetto, Venice, in the Nafi (ph) of the English Army, with a\nchaplain, evrything, very nice. The Jewish soldiers become our parents of this kibbutz.\nOne day I was told that, \"You because you are already on the way a long time, you are\nchosen with another one to go to Palestine.\" It was in the middle of the night. Everything,\nyou know, secretly and so and so, underground noise, and you're underground.\nUnderground of the Bricha, that's made by Israel -- Palestine guys together with Jewish\nsoldiers from the Brigade, or other soldiers, it was another mafia. So, we went all the\nnight by truck, from Venice to Barre. It's all Italy, maybe took more than one night, I\ndon't remember. But we come -- it was in the south of Italy. We were put in another\ncamp, a very secret camp. We could not go out because it was secretly and the Italians\nshould not know who we are.",
        "A: Oh, we were then about 250 people. Also from other groups because it was like a stream,\nwhich is going and when the stream is coming near Palestine, the stream becomes bigger\nand bigger and bigger. So, we met people from other places even they come from\nAuschwitz. They were the real Auschwitz, not like me with a false number. And even\nfrom France and from Belgium and from many places. I told you it's like a river, it's\ncoming, it's coming, but this place we were isolated -- even not to buy a wine from the\npeasants. They have a good wine for us, it was very important so we did, at night we did\nit. But we lost our patience and one day they took several guys from us, I think there\nwere 180, and took us also by night -- at night to a certain place, a hiding port, a small\nport in Trento (ph), this is south of, south of Italy, and there was waiting for us a small\nship. A small ship, a small ship, like half of a normal tennis place. We were 180 people\nand when we come to the ship it is also by certain order. It reminds me when I come to\nthe truck in order to go to the forest. I wrote it afterwards also in my diary that it's the\nsame sensation I have. Anyway we were took on the ship. The ship was very small, but in\nsuch a room there were about five or six floors of places to sleep, like in a store. Every\nman has so much place and it was -- I can't describe -- 1t was made like in a field hospital\nwhen somebody is carrying you. So, it was such --",
        "A: A cot, yes. Many cots, and we were lying there about seven nights, six nights only at\nnight we could go and have fresh air because British airplanes if they're watching us,\nmilitary airplanes, because in this time the British prohibited to -- were not allowing the\nJewish to come by the thousands to Palestine. It was their policy. And one night we could\nsee the lights, we were told the Carmel Mount and other things, so afterwards it was not\ntrue it was Cypress, and we have to make it around Cypress because some ships were\nrunning after us, the English marina. So, marina in the sea and the Royal Air Force in the\nskies. Everybody is running after us. After we already left Europe, but we are in a very,\nvery good mood, also singing. There were some pregnant women with us and we have\nnot too much water. We are very short on water until we came one night, it was the 23rd\nof October, 1945 to a place, very small place that ship can stay near. It was in the center\nof the coast of Palestine, Israel between Shefaim (ph) and Kibbutz -- Kibbutz Shefaim,\nand another place, let's say Kibbutz Shefaim. And there we have seen that many very\nsmall people are coming like swimming. We didn't know who they are. Afterwards we\nrealized that they were people of the Hagganah (ph), who come to take us because we\nwill not -- we have to go in the water. So, I remember that a very heavy girl took me on\nher shoulder so I told her, \"I can go by my foot.\" No she told, \"We have order, nobody\nwill go.\" After that I understood, because we had to make several kilometers by foot until\nwe came to a certain place that they took us on another truck and also us and also what\nwe have, our cargo. I had some shmates (ph) with me, that's all. Anyway, when they took\nus also, I could see that some people with Australian big hats are watching with arms on\nthe two sides. I was told that if the British police will come, they will shoot on them. So I\nwas told, I don't know if they would do it. Anyway, I felt myself very good and I\nremember that we were so thirsty that we took grapefruits from the trees and we eat it\ntogether -- all together. And the same nights we were brought to a village by the name\nGivat Chen (ph). They took me and another partisan and knocked on the door. It was in\nthe midnight. The man asked, \"Who are you?\" His answer was very funny, \"We brought\nyou a man from the sea.\" So, I am a man from the sea. I never was a sailor. \"A man of the\nsea,\" he opened immediately. Maybe it was also a password, I don't know, but he\nunderstand, he looked at me and cried. He talked with me Polish, German, Yiddish. I told\nhim I am talking Hebrew. \"Oh, very good, very good.\" All his family were sleeping and\nhe asked me, \"Don't to talk so loud.\" I told him, \"But I am happy.\" So, he put me in the\nwashroom to clean myself because I maybe was looking like a rubber something with a\nbeard, not make my hair nothing. Half military uniform, I have half civilian, a very bad\nimpression. So, he took me in the washroom leave me in the washroom to wash. When he\ncome back, he found me drinking the water, here from the water, he looked, \"What are\nyou mad?\" I tell him, \"I am still thirsty. I have not drink water for several days.\" I told\nhim, \"I can give you coffee or tea as much as you want.\" Anyway, I slept and the day\nafter they collected all the people from the farmers from this village, and everybody had\nto decide where he is going. It was a table with a green cover like in an office, and there\nwere sitting people from several organizations. Zionists, left Zionists, this Zionists,\nanyway, and also Beitar, or not Beitar, anyway, I told that I belong to Ha'Shomer\nHa'Tzair so please send me the kibbutz of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, so it happened. And\nafterwards I was living in this kibbutz, Beit Zera (ph) a year, until September 1946 and\nthen I decided to go to Jerusalem to the University. But it was a short time, I could not\nmake my studies because it occured the War of Independence and that's another story.",
        "A: The decision was made in the 9th of July, 1944, but it was only a decision. But the really\njourney began the 19th of January 1945 and finished the 23rd of October 1945, so it\nmeans about ten months.",
        "A: Boyhood, you mean --",
        "A: You mean till the Holocaust or after, because you cannot put --",
        "A: Oh, I think that my childhood and what you call boyhood, is a new word for me, I never\nheard it, but I like it, it, I think it's a continuity, nothing happened because when I came\nto Palestine I found many of my family of my uncles, aunts, cousins, classmates who did\nit before from the organization from Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, so it was a road. A road that\neverybody will do it before or after, so for me it was so natural, only what happened, the\nHolocaust and all the things after and maybe also include the Soviet time 1940 and 1941,\nit was something out the order for me. But to come to Palestine what for me it was like\ntwo and two are four.",
        "A: Yeah, but Kovno was a very modern community. Kovno, Lithuania of Kovno, even more\nthan Wilno was called the Eretz Yisrael of the Diaspora. So sometimes we were also -- it\nwas not all the community but we were brought up in a Jewish, Yiddish, or Communist\nideology but if we take, I would say about 60 percent of the Lithuanian Jewry they were\nbrought up in the way that I was brought up. May I give you an example. In 1935 there\nwere elections in all the world for the Zionist Congress. It happened every two years so\nin this small Lithuania with about 155,000 Jewish people inhabitants, they took part in\nthis elections about, I think, more than 45,000 people. Maybe some of them did it not\nseriously, they did automatically, and maybe they were not very strong Zionists, but\nanyway in this time 1s a need of the 30's the Zionist, I would not even tell Zionists, the\nnational feeling was very strong. The Hebrew culture was dominating. So, even religious\npeople were Zionist, so it's not a contradiction. So, I cannot see that Israel in the 40's\nwhen I came was something new for me. I'll give you another example. When the bus, no\nit was a bus, no more trucks, it was a bus from Egged company took us from the place I\nwas at night in the village Givat Chen, to the kibbutz, I was sitting and I remember a\nwoman asked me, \"Where are we now? What is here?\" It's a long way it's about four\nhours. So I told her, \"You don't know? That's the Mount Tabor.\" So, because I knew the\ngeography of Palestine, or Eretz Yisrael, more than of Lithuania. And you know like a\nfish who is in an aquarium and put back to the original water. That happened to me.",
