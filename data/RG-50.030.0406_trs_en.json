She was a very clever, so she put up a\nlittle business because my father\u2019s salary wasn't too big. He was there for -- he had been there,\ncame from Oslo because most people came into Rjukan from different towns in Norway, or\nSweden, or England, or Germany. Could come from many places, so it\u2019s the only place in\nNorway where you have no dialect, none at all. People in Norway are not aware of this, so now\nPll tell them.",

They put up an -- think that some of the workers living quarters is today occur --\neven today look like salaried people [indecipherable]. It was very good, from the very beginning.\nSo we were very lucky, and we had free schools. It was just -- books and everything was free. So\nit was extremely well done from that --",
        "Q: Now, is that unusual in Norway that the schools were free?",
        "A: Well, at that time it was unusual all over the world. So they were very ahead, I must say. The\nhydro, it\u2019s -- it was shortened to hydro, hydroelectric company, but hydro, and I think they had a\nwonderful personnel department, wonderful.",
        "Q: What did you like in school? Did you like school?",

He was\n[indecipherable] and then he was trying to become a sculptor. So he was very interested in books\nand all that. So sh -- he should really had gone on the sculptor way.",
        "Q: Your father?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So, I always felt that. But he was very fond of books. So in 1935, he came with a book to me,\nand I was there sixt -- roughly s -- six -- almost --",
        "Q: 17.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And he came with a book written by a German called Wolfgang Langhoff. That was, in\nGerman, Moorsoldaten, it means Moor soldiers. It was from a concentration camp in Germany,\nthe first one. And that book opened my eyes for Nazism. And my father came to me with it, he\nsaid, \u201cRead it. You understand a little more.\u201d And then -- from then on, I was an anti-Nazzi.\nWhen I was in s -- the second grade, it were col -- a kind of college, then we had the discussion\nalways in the class, it was 28 people in our class, was -- four were very hard against Nazism, but\n-- and the others were, of course, not Naziists at all. But they said Hitler is -- everyone has a job\nthere. Roads best in Europe, so -- so what. But if you had been through that book from\nOranienburg, when they built up right at the station there -- later on it was moved a little, the\nconcentration camps were moved a little, but at that time it was right in Oranienburg. I think it\u2019s\n-- was the first in Germany, in \u00b033. They say maybe -- they mention another place too, but I think\nit was the first, and I think I\u2019m right in that. And he got away in -- so he could --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- flee to Switzerland, and he wrote the book immediately. It was very important that we\nknew more about it, and h-he -- he more or less described it so what help -- was later, that we\nsaw later.",
        "Q: Did you discuss the book with your father?",
        "A: Oh, very much. No, I didn\u2019t need to discuss it in that way because he said, you read it, so you\nknow a little more about this. So when -- that -- we discussed it in school, but most people un --\nwas another thing, the German propaganda came to Norway already at that time. In 1936, before\nthe Olympics, th-the terrible propaganda, you know? They had more -- they had sent out young\nboys from Germany into Norwegian schools, that were called wunder -- in German\nwunderfagrin. And they had been educated, they were just 19 - 20, they were educated in\nGerman propaganda. They were going into schools, and who knew that? They thought they were\nvery nice to have German, young Germans here. But they were all specially trained people, right\n-- put right into schools in Norway.",
        "Q: So was the government of Norway in some way sympathetic that they allowed this, or they --",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t -- no --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- they were no sympathetic, they just didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t understand it. We were fooled,\nalready that -- at that time, by the Gestapo methods, and the propaganda machinery, you know?",
        "Q: But you in some sense understood because you read the book, so did you say things to these\npeople when they came into your class? Did you ask them?",
        "A: Oh yes, we discussed it, and we -- we were -- hard discussions between us. But it was talking\n-- to some people it was just 1m -- they just wouldn\u2019t understand. Was very difficult.",
        "Q: So as it got closer to when the Nazis took over, you -- you finished high s -- is it high school\ngymnasium?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And -- and when? In 1937 - \u201938?",
        "A: Yes, was all -- in \u00b038, and I -- from 1939 - \u201940, I was in the u -- at the University of Oslo.",
        "Q: In Oslo.",
        "A: So now I studied economics.",
        "Q: And wha --",
        "A: And at the same time, of course, I had a job. But at that time you would not -- I could -- my\nparent couldn\u2019t pay any education, so I started as an accountant. I was trying to become a\nchartered accountant, which was [indecipherable] and at the same time I studied economics. So\nwhen the war came in ninth April, \u201940, I was writing it.",
        "Q: You were writing your thesis?",
        "A: Yeah, in my education.",
        "Q: Why was it economics? Why were you want to -- want to do economics?",
        "A: Well, I -- I thought -- I liked it in a way, and I -- I thought the combination of chartered\naccountant and economics would do as a good future, give you a good future.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Interesting future.",
        "Q: Did -- did you have a sense that Germany would attack Norway?",
        "A: Not at all.",
        "Q: None?",
        "A: Oh no, didn\u2019t believe it, it couldn\u2019t be done, and so -- so was the rest of Europe. France? They\ndidn\u2019t believe that the Germans would attack. And the same with the British, you know,\nChamberlain? Peace in our time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Lasted a few months.",
        "Q: So there was no warning. You had no -- when they --",
        "A: No, it -- it wasn\u2019t, but of course the -- how they treated Germans in general, the very brutal\ndictatorship, we heard about that, and we thought it was terrible. And of course, we heard about\nthe Jews that were -- but nobody could really believe what later came.",
        "Q: So what was it like when the Germans occupied? What was -- what were those first few week",
        "A: Was a shock to all Norway. And then -- but you know, Hitler sent an ambassador to Norway,\ncalled Dr. Brauer, and he came with a ultimatum, and that said, he came up to the\n[indecipherable] in the morning, ninth April, 4:30 in the morning. And then he said, it\u2019s an\nultimatum. You give in or we start war. And the government, I think they withdrew for about\nquarter of an hour, they came back, we take the war. So then it was on. And it had almost start --\nit had started a little before, because Germans sent in -- the Hitler\u2019s pride was a very big warship,\nand that ship was stopped, it came almost into Oslo, then it was stopped by [indecipherable]\nfortress, fortress just before Oslo, near -- near the town of Jerbok, and that big ship was hit by --\nthey had some big guns there, German guns, by the way. And that ship was sank. That ship had\n2400 people on board, and they had an orchestra, because [indecipherable] going into Oslo, to\ntake Oslo in the morning. And it was sank at the place there, that fortress. And then the king --\nthe government and part of our congress people or parliament, they could get out to Oslo,\nbecause that\u2019s -- ship. They had 800 specially trained troops to take over -- to take the\ngovernment, arrest them in the morning. But they didn't have the chance, so the government, the\n-- the king of course, and the family, and part or most of Parliament members came out to Oslo. I\ncould -- they were saved, so they could meet outside Oslo to discuss the situation. So they had --\nthey got a little time. If not, they would have been taken in Oslo for 4:30, five o\u2019clock in the\nmorning, they would all be arrested, and then we had, of course, it had been [indecipherable]\nfighting for the government. Now they could get out, king, and then later on, we fought for about\ntwo months, Norway, and then the government, they went on fighting in England. And one thing\nwhat was very important to see, we had -- at that time, you wouldn't believe it, but we had the\nthird biggest merchant fleet in the world. We had the biggest tanker fleet in the world. Three\nmillion people. It was enormous. And the -- all the ships were out, on the world. Out in the\nworld. And it was only five ships in Norway. And then -- then the war came and the government\ncame to England. They sent out the telegram to all ships, and they said, we are now at war. You\nhave to go into allied harbors, New York, London, and they all did. And then we put up a\nshipping company, the biggest shipping company the world has ever seen. Was thou -- thousand\nships, and it -- you will never see that shipping company again. It was the world biggest, it was\nincredible. And of course, then the government had money. Now they could build up this small\nfleet, the Navy, they could build up a small Air Force in Canada. And they could up -- put up\nsome specially trained paratroopers, for all the time, that could go into Norway and start fighting\nthere, behind the enemy lines.",
        "Q: S-So the -- the king and the crown prince, and the family and part of the government went to\nLondon?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And stayed?",
        "A: They came over there, and the family, royal family came over to America, luckily. And that\nwas Crown Princess Martha and her children, three children, one of them was -- is King Harald\ntoday in Norway, and they stayed in Washington there, and they were taken good care of by\nPresident Roosevelt and his wife. They were very close to them, all the time.",
        "Q: Now, did you know this as you were in Oslo, that you -- you -- you knew that the family --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- excuse me -- the royal family had left?",
        "A: Yes. And we knew that part of the family, the -- the children and the wife of the crown prince,\nthey came out to the last ship from Finland. By the way, it -- what was an American ship that\ntook them out, over Petcimal in Finland. They got out to the States that way.",
        "Q: I see. So they went from Norway to Finland.",
        "A: To -- right to America --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And the royal fam -- the king and the crown prince, they ca -- came over to England and\nstarted there. And now the crown prince was later on commander in chief for the Norwegian part\nin England. They had to put up a ministry there, and -- within -- within the government, and they\nwere leading 1 -- our troops there, Navy, and so on.",
        "Q: So what happened to you? School stops, or doesn\u2019t stop? What happens?",
        "A: I was in the insurance company, having a job there as a assistant accountant. And then I went\ninto the office manager and I said, I\u2019m sorry, but I have to go into the war, can I have free? Can\nyou give me a -- so, it\u2019s incredible, isn\u2019t it? And he -- he just said, so, get out, get going, it\u2019s\ntime. But I thought I had to tell him, ask him if I had the admission. So I went -- then I went over\nand into the woods, north of Oslo, and joined a skiing company, with a friend of mine. So --",
        "Q: And you were going to try to meet the military in the north?",
        "A: Yeah, so that -- and next day I was fighting with the German troops coming from -- they had\nbeen then -- some of them landed in Oslo at the airport, and then they came north, and we met\nthem there, and we stopped them for about a good period, a day or two, but we had guns, we had\nrifles only. They had artillery, they had tanks, and they had all kinds of weapons which we -- you\nknow, it was the strongest army in the world, you know, so --",
        "Q: Yeah. Right.",
        "A: But we kept going two months. You know, France fell in 14 days. So I think we did okay,\nexpect what we could expect from us.",
        "Q: Now, had you been trained with guns?",
        "A: Well, I had a very little training in the King\u2019s Guard. But we had -- it\u2019s really interesting this\nis not so well known in Norway. We had the volunteering, military service among the students.\nWe put up that before the war. So in the -- li -- late \u201939, just beginning 1940, we had the\nvoluntary -- volunteers training there. So that was -- so you may have thought something could\nhappen. So we were right.",
        "Q: And who started that, students started that?",
        "A: That was one of my friends, he was a student leader, Knut Moyen, he started that. And later\non he became one of the leaders in a sec -- when we started building up small secret groups,\nmilitary groups.",
        "Q: And were there boys and girls in this or only boys?",
        "A: No, at that time it was only boys, but of course girls in -- in the resistance movement, when\nwe should go for instance, into Oslo to look after what had happened [indecipherable] we used\nour girlfriends --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- because the -- they were not suspected, see? But th-they did fine job. Also, all the -- was\ngirls in resistance movement did a wonderful job.",
        "Q: So after Norway falls, after two months, where -- where are you? Have you -- have you met\nthe -- the military in the north, or you never got there?",
        "A: Well, our -- we -- our skiing company fought for about three weeks in southern Norway, then\nwe had to give in, and I went back to Oslo. And then already some [indecipherable] I got the\nvery bad pneumonia, but I got through it and the same month, more or less, July 1940, I met with\nsome friends at the student\u2019s hut, out in the wilderness, north of Oslo. We started immediately\nthink, what are we going to do? What can we do? It\u2019s now two -- 200,000 Germans here. Where\ncan we start? But we thought we will start slowly, building up small groups. Maybe could be an\ninvasion, and we hope for that. And -- but one thing was what -- very important, it was all\nrumors. The papers were censored, all the newspapers. Radios taken, so now it was all rumors.\nAnybody. It was rumors, rumors. So we thought you have to do something with this, you have to\ninform people. So then we started secret newspapers. It was about 350 newspapers in Oslo at that\ntime, and I think it came up about at least so many secret newspapers, not with that circulation of\ncourse, but one of the newspaper had the circulation of 25,000. The newspaper what was that, we\nhad -- the Norwegian [indecipherable] had put up a -- with BBC, the Norwegian broadcast to\nNorway, every evening, 7:30. And then these peop -- the news was taken down, that was news\nfrom the free world. It was no propaganda, it was -- we had got all the news from the free world.\nAnd they were put down, and they were magnified -- I mean, they were copied, and then you\ncould have a sheet of paper, you could have 15, and you spread it round, very often where you\nwere working, at your -- 1t was spread, and then the Germans propaganda and anti-propaganda\nwas -- for them it was the worst thing. So Gestapo, it was the most terrible thing when -- if you\nare taken with the -- call it the clandestine newspaper, secretive, you would be arrested, and you\ncould easily be shot. Or you were put into concentration camps. I think about 20,000 did this\nduring the war, 5,000 are taken into custody, concentration camp, many, many died. And over\n200 Norwegian journalists -- call it journalist, they were shot, why? Because they fought Nazism\nwith pencil and paper. And they were shot, 200 of them are shot during the war, we hear about\nnow. So it was just incredible how the -- and it was two things that -- that Gestapo was after, but\nI had a real Gestapo force in Norway, secret police, security police, they were after people doing\nthese newspapers, and building up small military groups. And of course they were after other\ngroups, and later on, of course, the Jews, which we -- which we couldn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t understand.\nWe couldn\u2019t expect it at all, you know. They were Norwegians, they -- to me it was Norwegians,\nthey had Norwegian passport, they lived in Norway, had -- they were born there. That we\ncouldn\u2019t believe at all.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s talk about these newspapers. Ha -- about how many different clandestine newspapers\ndo you think there might have been during this period?",
        "A: I think it might have been 350.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes. All over Norway. About the same as we had before, but of course not with that\ncirculation. It\u2019s just natural.",
        "Q: And they were distributed what, individually, you would pass them out to people?",
        "A: Yes, for instance, when you had copied, let\u2019s say 50, you had other coming, fetching them,\nand of course we also used schoolchildren to distribute them. Could be old people, young people\nand schoolchildren, girls and boys. They were spread. But when they were grown up, they were\ntaken and of course when you had 20 people [indecipherable] you, 1t was seen by some traitors,\nsome informers, they would inform on you. They had put up the same as they had in Germany.\nSecurity police and informers. You know, in any nation you would have one to two percent\nwhich are traitors to your country. And now they found them, and they were taken -- they had the\n-- they were about 4,000 in Oslo. In -- over the two, three years, we had 4,000 informers. And\nwhen they saw man with the paper, they informed it to the Gestapo, and that man was tortured.\nAnd of course, he had been to a place getting it, and that was -- of course he -- you cannot stand\nthe torture, it\u2019s impossible with the torture. They came to Norway with Middle Age torture.\nMiddle Age torture, which I had read about, it 1 -- was history, and now they came into open with\nthe Norwegian -- with the security police and they -- then they also organized, or reorganized\nNorwegian police. So they had about, I should say, 20 percent of them got taken into a new state,\nit was federal police, state police, and they were just teached -- taught by the Gestapo, so they\nwere as good as any German Gestapo, any German security officer. So it was a very -- if you\nwere in that, call it that trade, newspaper distribution, you would have a good chance to be\narrested, tortured and killed. Was a very great risk. We all -- they all knew.",
        "Q: But it was e-equally as risky to take the newspaper and be seen with it, as it was to deliver it, I\ngather?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. Then they would arrest you, they would torture you and say where did you get\nit from? Where -- where did you get it from? And, of course, they couldn\u2019t stand it, and they --\nthen they were arrested, others were arrested. But it all the time they kept -- kept on, it was more\nand more newspapers, secret newspapers.",
        "Q: Did you write some of the stuff that went into the newspapers, or did you distribute them,\nwhat did you do?",
        "A: No, we -- I tried a little to begin with, because I started with this in 1940, we already -- we\nhad the newspaper that started already autumn -- fall, \u201940, and the -- well, I think it fall -- \u00b041, it\nwas really started, on the -- the very good newspapers. So -- but 1t was written by our best brains,\nvery good articles, and today you can read them in our resistance museum, they\u2019re all there, you\ncan read them, and very interesting to read now.",
        "Q: So how long did you work with the clandestine newspap -- were you also, by the way,\nworking at this -- as an assistant accountant still? Did you go back?",
        "A: Oh yes, I tried, but I hadn't had time for this, because now I was a resistant worker on full\ntime.",
        "Q: Full time.",
        "A: So then I started to make different aliases because after one year, the Gestapo heard about\nHans Jacobsen, he was one of the -- what the hell this is -- one of the leaders. And then the -- a\nman was tortured, and he said that well, he knew Hans Jacobsen, that was his address, and then\nof course then the Germans went out and they couldn\u2019t find any Hans Jacobsen at all, he had no\ntelephone, he had no address, he had just nothing. So they -- I was there, and then --",
        "Q: Was that your alias at the time?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Jacobsen?",
        "A: Then I was Hans Jacobsen.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: But then when that was known by the Germans, I changed into another name. And I really\nstarted to fake this myself. I learned it, and I think I -- I used -- when I had the false papers I had\nno -- I had made [indecipherable] myself. So I believed them, I knew they were correct.",
        "Q: Was this easy for you to do? To fake yourself?",
        "A: Well, no, it wasn\u2019t easy to start with, but for instance, will you -- you will see in one of my\npassports, one of the worst Gestapos we have ever had was a fellow called Martinsen, he was the\nhead of the Norwegian part of Gestapo, and I today -- even today I can write his signature,\nbecause I had the signa -- his signature on one of my passports, and I think I today could write K.\nA. Martinsen, pol -- chief of police, secret police in Norway. So 1 -- 1 -- that was -- I hadn\u2019t had it\nin school, so I had to start from the ke -- beginning, you know?",
        "Q: Tell me something, did you go -- during this period, the beginning period a-as you started in\nthe resistance in -- did you go back to your family and talk to your parents and tell them what\nyou were doing, so the -- that they --",
        "A: A that --",
        "Q: -- they wouldn\u2019t worry, or they would worry?",
        "A: That\u2019s an interesting question, because in \u201943, January, one man was tortured, and he knew\nmy real name, Gunnar Sonsteby. I think it was my real name. Then they went right up to Rjukan\nand arrested my father as a hostage for me. But I talked with him, and I thought this would\nhappen, that was the -- the way they did it. And we agreed he\u2019d take -- said -- he said to me,\n\u201cYou take your job, Ill take mine.\u201d He was in prison -- concentration camp for two and a half\nyears. But I knew I had to go on, and he was kept in Norway because they couldn\u2019t send him to\nGermany, because then they couldn\u2019t threaten to shoot him, you know? They would have -- liked\nto have in the neighborhood so they could shoot him if it was something with me. But he\nsurvived.",
        "Q: So early on, in 1940, or \u201941, you spoke to your parents, and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- it was clear to them that this was --",
        "A: And my mother knew -- my mother knew about it too.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they -- I helped them, they were -- I was living in Oslo, and when all the [indecipherable]\nwere taken. Then, she took a couple of these [indecipherable] up to Rjukan, it was used there as a\nsecret [indecipherable] for the rest of the war.",
        "Q: Hm. And your sister, was she involved in the resistance?",
        "A: Yes. Very little, because th-then it would have been too much.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So, it wasn\u2019t --",
        "Q: You mean it was too much to have two children --",
        "A: Yeah. In the small town like that, it wouldn\u2019t do, it had to be other people that took over.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So did you get bored with working on the newspaper and wanted to do something\nmore?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t get bored, because it was terribly interesting. But Ih -- then, in \u00b041, I wanted to\ngo to Sweden to report because I don\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t know what about our allies? What about our\npeople in -- over the -- overseas, in the -- in London. And knew -- I knew they had their office in\nStockholm. So I went with one of my refu -- he was a refugee, over to Sweden, to report. And\nthen they told me, we can use you as a growing -- as a career between Oslo and Stockholm. So I\nstarted that. So I had about 15 - 20 of these trips between the towns, to report. Then I knew a\nlittle more what they wanted with us, from England, wh-what the allied wanted, through the\nNorwegian government and our defense people in -- in England. So our -- after awhile, I think it\nwas in \u00b042, ninth of April, \u201942, then I was in touch with the British. And I said, we\u2019re have an\norganization, I didn\u2019t know what. It was a S.O.E., special operations executive. And then they\nasked me, are you willing to go back to Norway, put up an office in Oslo for us, secret of course.\nAnd I did. So from ninth of April \u201940 to ninth of April \u201943, I had an office in Stockholm -- in\nOslo, and every fortnight 1t came a courier to me, and I had to report -- make a report, so that had\nbe ready when he came, so I wrote the report every fortnight that year, about conditions in\nNorway.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. Prior to that, were you not taken to a refugee camp in Sweden?",
        "A: Yes, but --",
        "Q: Or -- of -- of --",
        "A: -- [had the -- I don\u2019t know how I -- it was very se -- very special in Sweden, if you left the\ncamp, you would be arrested, but I was lucky, so I was -- I was wanted in Sweden very early. So\nwhen I was in Sweden later on, I had to be -- keep in Stockholm very -- I couldn\u2019t go into hotels,\nso -- and I had some Swedes want -- could -- they dared to keep me in their small hotel, for\ninstance, but when I -- the first time I was in Stockholm, I had to stay there three months. And\nthen I spent my days going into different small coffee shops, because in daytime I couldn\u2019t go to\nthat place where I lived, so -- but it was very natural that I was wanted in Sweden because you\ncouldn\u2019t have Norwegian refugees running all around the country, in a war. So it was very\nnatural. So I was put in -- prisoner for about three months, but then I got out again, under a false\nname. I put up a new name, a new family name, and I was put to court, and they all believed me.\nSo then I got out to Stockholm, and then in secrecy back to Oslo.",
        "Q: And what was this new name? I think it\u2019s rather significant.",
        "A: Oh, that was the -- I picked the name, then I knew the British people in Stockholm, and the\nNorwegians, the army people, they wouldn't -- wouldn\u2019t know exactly what happened to me. So\nI put up a new name this time, I s -- I call myself Gunnar Lear. And my father was a station --\ngas station owner in Oslo, I -- my mother was Margda Lear, and all that, was a big family, and so\nthey all believed me, then Swedish state [indecipherable] security police, and I got out, but then I\nput the name Gunnar Lear, that means in English, you know it\u2019s Gunnar Liar. And when the\nBritish saw that, they really got a kick out of it. So they say, oh, this is Gunnar, certainly.",
        "Q: And the Swedes did not check to see whether this was a real person, or --",
        "A: Well, they checked, you see, but I -- I did it in -- in Karlstar in Sweden. Then I called the\nauthorities in Stockholm, and I say, do you know any Gunnar Lear? And then I had given up the\nname, it was a fellow, was Norwegian that was in Associated Press in nor -- in Norway. I -- and I\n-- | had taken him over the border, I had saved him. And then he said -- when he said -- I\nmentioned him, and he was a very well known man, of course. So it -- and he said\n[indecipherable] he said to himself. He was -- I knew he was brilliant. Oh yes, I know Gunnar L-\nLear. Oh, certainly I know him. He was very quick, and that helped me. Otherwise I would have\nbeen -- been in custody in Sweden for the rest of --",
        "Q: Rest of --",
        "A: -- for the war.",
        "Q: So when you became involved with the S.O.E., is it a person named Daniel Ring who brought\nyou in?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, he -- he brought me in. And we discussed what my number should be, and I -- I\nwanted the number 13. That\u2019s my lucky number. And he said well, you can\u2019t have that, another\nfellow -- so you can have 24. From then on my cover -- call it number was 24, under which I was\nknown in the resistance movement. Number 24 was -- then I knew who itt was.",
        "Q: So now, let me ask you this question. How -- how do you get money in these situations? You\ndon\u2019t get a salary from the resistance movement, how does --",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. You got the money from the British and the Norwegian liaison,\nbecause they knew I was -- you know, all refugees coming to Sweden, they had money,\nNorwegian money, with them. And the -- they were -- then they were changed into Swedish\nmoney, and all this money could be used by us. So I had this Norwegian money back to Norway,\nit was sent back to us. We used millions of kroner. [indecipherable] Again, we had money in\nEngland, because o -- of our merchant fleet, and the tanker fleet. You know, our tanker fleet,\nthey say the tanker fleet -- we -- England had to have fuel -- fuel. Fuel is a war. And they needed\nfor billions of troops, everything. 60 percent of all Jews coming to that island, came from\nNorwegian [indecipherable]. So they said -- Churchill said in parliament, this 1s about one\nmillion soldiers. [indecipherable] So that\u2019s the -- the real effort was Norway -- that was the real\neffort of Norway, this fleet.",
        "Q: When you were staying at different people\u2019s ho -- I gather you had to move around a good\ndeal, you didn\u2019t have one place where you lived. Did you pay people?",
        "A: No. But no, no, it couldn\u2019t be paid, that -- that wouldn\u2019t do. But of course, I had all kinds of\nconnections, I had enough food, I had connections everywhere. So when I went in hiding and\nlived with the family, I had all s -- always -- I couldn\u2019t sit there, eat myself, so I had all this food\nfor the whole family. I couldn\u2019t go into there with food for myself and the family didn\u2019t have it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So it was never difficult [indecipherable] that, and that meant so much to them. But they were\nanti-Nazi so they didn\u2019t [indecipherable] that. They could offer you meals, which they almost --\nit\u2019s impossible. So it were -- they were all patriots and th-they took a very great risk. If they\ncame there and I had to shoot myself out, the whole family would be in trouble.",
        "Q: So when you became part of the SOE --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- what was your -- what was your role? The SOE\u2019s connected with the British, yes?",
        "A: Yes, and later on, of course, with the Norwegian government in London, so it was all put\ntogether and coordinated, so they -- and I was reporting all kinds -- intelligence was first of all to\nbegin with, in all kinds of intelligence, but they needed everything from Norway. For instance,\npilots, books, to get all kinds of things, of the -- all kinds of information about nor -- Norwegian\nNazi authorities. Was very valuable things for -- for the allied, and of course, all troop\nmovements.",
        "Q: So you had to have -- did you choose agents in the field who would get this information and\nbring it to you? And were you --",
        "A: Yeah, I had friends. I made friends, of course, and you could si -- when -- when I came into --\noutside Oslo and needed a contact for instance, and we -- I knew it was about four or 5,000\ninformers. I usually picked doctor. They were very -- there was very few [indecipherable] so I --\nI took the chance to run and see the doctor and he could help me. Or I would go to the teacher,\nand sometimes the priest, they were all -- that\u2019s an -- that\u2019s a chance you took, and I was always -\n- | always was lucky, or -- or I picked the right people.",
        "Q: Were you frightened?",
        "A: I was lucky, I had good parents, so my -- my psyche was -- my psyche -- is that right? M-\nMust have been very good, because I didn\u2019t have any. Th -- I must have been very, very -- back\nwhen God gave us the nerves, I must have been way ba -- way back in the queue.",
        "Q: What do you think in your background, in your t -- as you were growing up? Was there\nsomething you think that prepared you for this? It se -- 1t seems as if it was something just very\nnatural to you, you just decided this was what you had to do.",
        "A: Well, in a way you are right. I just had to do it, 1t came naturally. So and that, of course, when\nyou heard how the Nazis had gone, with -- when you -- what they did to the German population,\nthe -- the Jews, and the same what they did -- did to all your friends. In a way it was not\nnecessary to hate them, but you had to fight them. It was natural to feel so angry. How they\ntreated 1 -- for instance, when they arrested women, it -- it -- it -- 1t was incredible that they\ntortured women. It was -- how could you believe? So we got very angry. And of course -- and\nthat was with the -- the rest of my friends. I -- I -- they had nerves, of course, but I think this was\n-- that was really what made them fight.",
        "Q: So you were getting information and then you were encoding information to send it to --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- to England. And how were you doing that? What was the process?",
        "A: That was done -- I put my own system. I took a book in Norway, and I started it with a page\nin that book, and I took -- I counted syllables, both ways, and then you could -- it was a hell of a\ntrouble, you see, so I got so angry and tired, this was like to be in school again, I sat nights and\ndid that, so I had a -- then I had the man that could take over. So --",
        "Q: So ex --",
        "A: So he did that [indecipherable] and it came to Stockholm, and I had the same book, the same\npage, and I could easily -- we coded only the names. The rest you wrote could be written, but the\nnames were important, and the places, of course.",
        "Q: So can you explain the system? Was it by syllable, or by letter?",
        "A: By syllable.",
        "Q: By -- by syllable.",
        "A: Yeah, you counted down in that page, on that top of the page, you find a e. Number five\ndown. So that\u2019s -- I think 1t was very simple, and I think it\u2019s almost impossible to -- if you had\nthe book and you didn\u2019t know anything about that, you couldn\u2019t solve it, I think.",
        "Q: And did they send you messages back in the same way\u2019?",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: To get -- to ask you to do things?",
        "A: Yes. But was names and places that were coded. That was the important thing.",
        "Q: And not -- not the others, right?",
        "A: No, because you know, I was in Sweden, and reported every -- every quarter. So I -- I knew\nwhat I thought they knew, what they wanted.",
        "Q: And how did you go back and forth from Oslo to Stockholm?",
        "A: Oh, I had good friends, and I knew the way. I had the good papers, so I usually took a train o -\n- up to border town called Kongsvinger, and from there, then I had that -- who did help me there?\nI found a man that was head of the -- then -- the state transportation system in that town. So he\nknew everything of course. He helped, he was my agent there. So then I -- from stock -- I-I -- in\nthat period when I came on the -- and board a train, I had the control by Gestapo officers almost\nevery time. So one of my passports, which you have seen, that has been going through about 40\nGestapo controls, I think. Then I was -- I was a stock worker, working in a stock up there. So\nthey believed it, and I looked fairly in -- innocent, you know, don\u2019t you think so? So it worked\nall the time. And then how to get into the border? It was about 25 miles. Then, in -- in summer I\nused to bicycle and in winter I used something I think you know in the States, called a kick\nsledge. Have you ever heard about that?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: You find it in some places, in Wisconsin, or some th -- they know it there, kick sledge. They\nknow it in Sweden, Norway and Finland. And this kick sledge was -- took me there, and -- very\nquick --",
        "Q: So what 1s it like? What is a kick sledge?",
        "A: It\u2019s a-- a sledge, which -- it\u2019s a kind of --",
        "Q: Do you stand behind them?",
        "A: Exactly, yeah. And it built in that way so you can stand behind it. And then you --",
        "Q: But who -- how do y --",
        "A: -- just kicked your way.",
        "Q: You kick your way?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I see, so there are no dogs?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, you did it yourself.",
        "Q: You did -- uh-huh.",
        "A: Keeping to that built up. So it was a very good thing.",
        "Q: Did you have to change your na -- use different identities each time you went, or did you use\nthe Liar name -- Lear?",
        "A: No, no, I had changed many times since that time. And it was so strict. If you came up to\nKongsvinger, and you\u2019re in -- you were controlled, then if you had a passport showing it was\nmade out in Oslo, you would be taken. So I had to make new passports, which they did for me up\nthere -- would -- and I did -- by the way, I did them s -- myself, but I got a form up there. And\nthen I had the passport being issued by the Kongsvinger police. Then they wouldn\u2019t say, oh gosh,\nhe\u2019s -- he\u2019s living here.",
        "Q: Now --",
        "A: But if you -- if you had a passport issued by Oslo police, you would be interrogated.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Because you were suspicious then. You were man outside the -- the -- the German guard in\nthat town, of course they had a couple of security police, and they said all strangers to\nKongsvinger, be careful. They might be [indecipherable] they might be resistance workers. So\nthat\u2019s was a [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So when you -- when the police would look at your I.D. card, you -- you did -- you weren't\nafraid of anything?",
        "A: No, I had so good papers. I knew they were good.",
        "Q: You knew.",
        "A: I knew I would fool them.",
        "Q: Look at that smile.",
        "A: But of course, if you had some -- some stupid thing could stop it of course, but I was lucky,\nall the time. And I was from February \u201943, I was wanted and they had nice pictures of me at the\nGestapo headquarters in Oslo. Nice pictures, but wi -- an average looking man like me, I have a\nnose, I have eyes, and a mouth, ears, that\u2019s -- you cannot pick up a man -- I think you can talk to\nthe police here, it\u2019s impossible to pick up a average looking man from a picture. I knew it was\nimpossible, I -- and I -- I still, I believed it. That made me look just [indecipherable] I walked\naround in Oslo street without trouble.",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to take a break now.",
        "A: Good. If you --\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Mr. Sonsteby, you were connected a little earlier on with the group, the resistance group\nMilorg, am I right?",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Or are you --",
        "A: That\u2019s correct [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So tell me how -- why it was that you did not stay with that group.",
        "A: Well, I did, because I followed it all the time, and I -- I mention the name called Knut Moyen.\nHe and I worked very closely together. And everything I could do to help him. Then all the SOE\nsent in instructors from Great Britain to Norway, and it was a mixture there, it was a little\ndifficult, because the Norwegian organization did one thing, and the groups from England did\nanother thing. It was the Norwegian independent company number one. But then, together with\nKnut Moyen we could discuss this, and I could help him out. We were both a little unlucky\nbecause one of the people coming from England, he was arrested, he was tortured, and he\nbecame more or less an informer. Of course, this -- he was shot, he got shot right through the\nhead, and [indecipherable] so it was terrible, but we are both a little unlucky there because many,\nmany people, 200 people are arrested because of that instructor who was tortured. But otherwise,\nI took care of -- I was asked by my authorities to take care of all people come -- all agents\ncoming in from England, from the -- coming around the central part of Norway, and I took care\nof them, that was part my job, so we could discuss this, and in the -- in a couple of years it was\nall coordinated. It was a little because the [indecipherable] thought I should built up with\nNorwegians alone, but they finally saw that some of the people inside Norway that built up the\nresistance, they were clever enough to let us -- so they could cooperate, but you know, you\ncouldn\u2019t talk to each other in that way in Norway. I-I-It was all secret, you know.\nCommunications with England was difficult, everything was difficult, but in two, three years, it\nwas all coordinated within SOE, and the Norwegian authorities in England and also the home\nfront people, the military central leadership in Oslo, it was all finally coordinated from I would\nsay, 43, it started. And we had also a very good leader who was very clever, and th -- he was\nover to England a couple of times, which I was also, but he really was a good man, and he -- they\nunderstood in England that he was a -- quite a terribly clever fellow. He re -- he impressed them.\nThat helped. And we had also, of course, Communists, which didn\u2019t agree in that kind of\nleadership. But I worked together with them, so when I met the man who fought the Germans,\nthat was the important part, whatever he was. That was the important part for me, so I was lucky.\nHad a good cooperation with them, but legally on top, they would -- they would listen more, of\ncourse, to Stockholm, Moscow, than -- instead of to us. But they were not under Moscow, but to\na certain extent they listened more to Moscow than London, which 1s -- was natural, you know.\nBut it -- it worked fairly well in Norway.",
        "Q: And how would you distinguish the Milorg people from the Linge people, from the\nCommunists? I mean, how -- ho --",
        "A: It was the same young Norwegian people, but with a different education, call it. Where --\nwhen you came over to England, you were taken care of by the British on the -- went through all\nthat training schools, and they were -- must have been the best instructors in the world, because\nwhen you met -- when you re-met Germans in the war, beginning of the war, the -- like all the\nsoldiers and all that, you -- we felt inferior. But after being instructed and trained in England, we\ndidn\u2019t feel inferior at all. We knew we had the best weapons, we knew we had the best brains to\ntrain us, so now we could be equal. And being equal, I think we were the best. I think so.",
        "Q: So wer -- were all these different groups, representatives from them, brought to England? The\nMilorg had people who were England trained also?",
        "A: Yes, there were all kinds of people, schoolboys, and people without schooling. It could be\ncarpenters, lumberjacks, everything. And they all formed these groups, they could go into the\nNavy, they could be pilots. They were trained in what\u2019s called Little Norway in Toronto,\nCanada. They were sent over and they did very well, and the -- first of all, I think everybody\nwant to be a pilot. So I remember when I was in Stockholm, I should go over to England, I said,\ncan I be a pilot? No, he said, y-you -- you can, but I think we have another [indecipherable] for\nyou, called the Norwegian independent company, we\u2019ll put you in there, probably, send you back\nto Norway.",
        "Q: And why did so many people want to be pilots?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, because they had done very well, I think in -- from -- you know, over London\nin 1941 and \u00b042, they did very well. So --",
        "Q: Were there any bad conflicts between these different groups?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Not at all. It could be, of course, when you\u2019re immigrants, it can always be little small\nquarrels, but in nor -- to Norwegians, we had been very lucky, and it was -- when we came back\nto Norway, or when it started, at the end of the war, it was only one real body, and that was the\nresistance movement in -- under the leadership of the homefront people, and they were the only -\n- the Communists were -- didn\u2019t put up a group like that, so it was all -- we had -- we had no,\nshall we say possibilities th-that they should start fighting each other in Norway. We were very --\nextremely lucky. It may be that we are -- I don\u2019t know why, really. But we agreed, or we had all\n-- one common emeny -- enemy, that was Nazis. And so that was the feeling all over. I think -- I\nwould say that 95, we had 98 percent behind us in Norway. They tried whatever they could, they\ntried to make the pupils, they tried to make the teachers into nat -- Nazis. I mean, it wasn\u2019t -- it\nwas -- I think it was impossible in Norway. I think we had -- after five years hard propaganda, I\ncannot see that they had any Norwegian turning into Nazi. Only opposite, it was the opposite. So\nthat doesn\u2019t -- pure principle is nothing for us. We have democratic rules.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit more about what the general population was doing. I understand that the\nbishops made statements all over the country when they resigned, is that right?",
        "A: Yes. That\u2019s right. And also, our -- all of our -- they call it the -- what would you call it here,\nthe top court in [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Judiciary?",
        "A: The high court --",
        "Q: The high court?",
        "A: -- people. The -- the Supreme High Court. They all withdrew already in \u201941. So they all\nwithdrew because it was no -- it was no freedom, it was no rights, it was all German propaganda,\nso they all withdrew. They were not arrested, by the way, but they disappeared into -- but didn\u2019t\ndo anything.",
        "Q: And teachers, professors?",
        "A: Yes, teachers and professors --",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t there a strike?",
        "A: -- they did a wonderful job. To begin with, from \u00b041 - \u201942, then -- the little Nazi party, they\nwanted to have schoolchildrens into uniforms. They didn\u2019t use the swastika, but they had now a\nnew kind of a sign, it was a sun, course -- cross, sun cross. It was a kind of a cross. And -- and\nschoolchildren should now be put 1n uniforms. It was almost to that. And then they put up all\nteachers, professors were put in a new organization called some teacher\u2019s association, Nazis.\nAnd they all refused. And then they took about -- arrested thousand. 500 were sent up to\nconcentra -- tra -- concentration camp up in the north, very north, at our northest town, and then\nth -- 500 were sent over to Trawnia to be shipped up to Trawnia, to this concentration camp up in\nthe north. And they had a small passenger ship, and that -- on deck it was German soldiers and\nunderneath, in -- in the room of the ship, it was put 500 teachers. And they were sent up to the --\nin that little ship. It would take about 14 days to the very north, and then -- oh, course it was,\nwhen an allied plane saw that ship, it was all Germans. It was a small troop transported. It looked\nlike that. That was the idea for Terboven, the chief Nazi in Norway, and Quisling. They thought\nthat was a good idea, maybe allied planes would bomb them, and who had done it? That kill\nthem all. And it was protested very hard from the who -- all the population to Quisling, and to\nTerboven. Please stop it, you cannot do this. They did.",
        "Q: They stopped it?",
        "A: Yeah, but the -- no, they sent them.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They -- they didn\u2019t listen to protests, they said, this is the way we want it, we want them to be\ngone. So we don\u2019t care. And luckily, nothing happened, and they came -- but most of it -- I think\nit was many teachers that die on the way, it was very little water, very little food, and then they\ncame up to the concentration camp, and the -- after about a year, the Germans [indecipherable |\nthat little party, you know, Nazi party, they came in. So the -- they won this fight, the teachers.\nAnd it was women, and men of course.",
        "Q: H-How do you account for this response on the part of Norwegians to refuse? I -- w-w-were\nthe -- is Norway filled with heroes?",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: In some way?",
        "A: -- it -- well, you saw all the troubles that -- I think that \u2019 ve seen many Germans have seen the\nsame, but it was penetrated completely by security police, and the informers, that had come so\nfar in Norway, so -- but it was -- they were trying, but luckily we -- well -- well, they had -- they\nhad a power, so we could just try to in a way sabotage it, that was the way, you know, and I\nthought it was just the way to do it. To try to help it, and they -- we are -- it\u2019s very hard to get to\nknow each [indecipherable] democracy, I think. Of course, it\u2019s very hard to explain that it was\nonly two percent, one and a half percent. I-It\u2019s still hard to explain that there was so few.",
        "Q: So few who appr -- who --",
        "A: The Nazis.",
        "Q: Nazis.",
        "A: Or who were belong -- believing in the Nazi. It\u2019s really hard to explain.",
        "Q: In 1942, things got much worse for the Jews in Norway. There were what, 1700 or 1800 Jews\nin Norway, am I correct?",
        "A: About 2,000 in all to begin with. And it was -- could have been a few Jews coming from other\ncountries to come to that safe Norway. And like Willie Brandt, for instance, and others. I know,\nof course, many Jews came, very famous Jews, doctors and musicians. But then the -- in \u00b042, it --\nthe first thing that started -- you saw my passport, they put a J there. Of course that was awful.\nWe didn\u2019t understand it, how they could do it, because in Norway, one was a Methodist, another\nwas a Baptist and another was a Jew, we didn\u2019t think of that. Now they tried to make us -- a kind\nof propaganda against Jews, but it didn\u2019t work, it -- not at all. It didn\u2019t work in -- in Norway. We\nhadn\u2019t had that impression at all. So then it started a little more, and the trouble was, now when I\nthink back, y-you know that far -- that far -- all the -- all the ar-archives, you know, all Jews.\nThey found that in [indecipherable] and in Oslo. Well, how could you help it, in a way, but then\nwas when the trouble started, you know? [indecipherable] they wouldn\u2019t know everyone, every\nfamily, and then s -- I was standing there again at the -- summer, July, August, \u201942. Then I had a\nfamily called Rubinstein, and they -- they had a feeling that it was maybe worse than they\nthought, but the trouble was that if you left for Sweden, you lost everything. You were sure to\nlose everything. You lost your house, you lost the bank account, if you had any. If -- you lost\neverything, everything when you have left Norway. Your business was taken over by authorities,\nNazi authorities. And if you didn\u2019t, then it was about -- I took the family over, and I think it was\ngood idea, but we didn\u2019t feel that all sh -- all should be done, b -- because they had Norwegian\npassports. And then the rumors came -- I would say so very much, in October, \u201942, but then\nsuddenly they went there, and the -- remember, the police had been organized, reorganized\nsomehow, it was Nazi police. And then that night, 1t was -- now it was about 700 left, about\neight, I would say, 1200 had come out to begin with, and later on it was taken over by the\nresistance the people had wanted. Every -- in those years, everyone that wanted to go out, could\nbe helped. I could easily take a family over, I had their o -- a-as I told you, I knew the people, I\ncould take easily. And I had no trouble going into Sweden. But then the 700 in all families, older\npeople, young people, and -- and children, old people. And then the -- then one day, one o -- why\n-- | heard it in this way, that one of my friends -- I knew a law -- a la -- a young lawyer, and his\nname was Hawkin [indecipherable] and he had a -- I didn\u2019t know he was a Jew, or anything, of\ncourse. I knew he had the passport, he had shown me that. Then he was a young lawyer, then\nsuddenly, six o\u2019clock in the morning, I was to hear this, they came and they said, you are arrested\nbecause of the law so and so. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that law. I never heard about it.\u201d\u201d He was a\ngood lawyer, and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, it must be wrong.\u201d So -- but then -- well, you have to\ncome with us. Your bank account is now taken, you lose your house and have you any jewels\nhere, we have to have them now. Everything. And he was so bewildered, of course, and then that\n-- it was a shock to hear that new law, two days old, and the shock to hear he had no more things\nin life. They were all taken. And then he was taken away. I heard about this, and of course, then\nit started all -- all over Norway. A few were -- then, what happened to his wife, and a little\ndaughter? Three days later, a man knocked at the door, five o\u2019clock in the morning, and they said\nget away, soon. And so she moved from the second floor, up to the third floor, to -- and the\nfamily said please come in here. Six o\u2019clock that morning the Gestapo came for her and her --\nbut she were -- they were saved. So many had --",
        "Q: She was saved?",
        "A: She was saved, and with the la -- little girl. She was taken care of and sent home to Sweden,\nso she was saved. But another thing, you know, what was terrible, I had also knew about the\nyoung man in [indecipherable]. He was a -- a Jew, 18 years old. He told me afterwards that he\nwas now in resistance. And then he got to know his parents had been told, if he doesn\u2019t report to\nthe police, they would all be taken. And of course, he gave himself up, and they took all of them.\nThe Gestapo, security police, Nazis, lies, lies, and lies, that was all they had coming from that\nGerman [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So, did the resistance warn Jews and say, things may happen, we want to take you out of\nSweden, or did the Jews make contact with the resistance to ask for help?",
        "A: No, I just -- for instance, we had a family, which I talked about, we discussed that openly.\nWhen I -- we had a -- a career, he -- they knew him very well, so they heard from Stockholm,\nthey had news from the outside world. So they -- they heard about the Crystal Night, you know,\nall that, so now they started to think, maybe it can happen here. And about the 1200, they have\nstarted to think that way. But I talked to Jule Benko my friend that is here with me. He 1s one of -\n- in our parliament he was the speaker of our [indecipherable] parliament for 12 years, and we\ndiscussed this. He was a young Jew at that time. He was in resistance, \u201942, so we discussed\nbetween ourselves now, we are discussed 1t now, what did you think -- what did I think. We had\nthe same view on this. We had just thought the same in August. So he -- then Gestapo was -- had\nwanted him, so he went over to Sweden, of course, because we had to flee, because he was now\nwanted by the Gestapo, then you had to flee. And he --",
        "Q: So what -- what was your view, that it was so alike at the time?",
        "A: That was that we didn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t believe that they would be arrested, or -- or w-we\ncould believe that they would be arrested to a camp in Norway, but the rest we didn\u2019t at all\nconsider. And he went over to Sweden and later on he came over to Canada and joined the\nNorwegian Air Force, and all his family are lost. All of them. So he knows what happened.",
        "Q: So in 1942, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening in Russia, you don\u2019t know that there are more\nthan a million people who have been shot.",
        "A: Well, in -- they -- how they treated -- when they came into Russia, of course. But coming --\ngoing on into Norway, trying to keep them -- they tried to keep us as a civilized nation, but all\nthe -- the rule there, 1t was harder and harder. Hitler had of course hoped that th-the Nordic types\nthere would be drawn in, because -- so he was furious when they had this fight -- all the\nresistance in Norway. And we lost many. Also at this time of \u201942 August, it was thousands of\nNorwegians that were waiting to get out Sweden, because Sweden were neutral. It was important\nto us that Sweden was neutral. Without the neutral Sweden I cannot see how we could have had\na resistance at all. Because all routes towards England, over the sea, were stopped in \u201942 for\nrefugees. And it -- we could take 50,000 over to Sweden during the war. And we had them out at\nthe same times, at -- this shocked us, the Jews, we had -- could have had two, 3,000 in Oslo\nwaiting to get over to Sweden to save their lives. We als -- mixed together, you know, so --",
        "Q: W-Were the Swedes like the Norwegians in the sense of even though they were politically\nneutral, were they anti-Nazi in your experience?",
        "A: In my opinion, I met only at the border in small town, Gottenberg, also, and even in\nStockholm, I didn\u2019t meet anybody that had a Nazi sympathy. I knew it was some, but I -- I didn\u2019t\nmeet any. And I had a wonderful -- but I -- 1t was difficult when I -- I had my headquarters at the\n-- at the farm, on the -- right on the Swedish Norwegian border. And then I understood that on\nthe other side, the custom officer, I was pretty sure he was intelligence officer. Before I had been\nin army, lived in Sweden, I [indecipherable] custom official, with a officer -- intelligence officer,\nand I was right. So I got in touch with him, and from then on we worked together. But if it had\nbeen known, and the police, they came up and fetched me on the border, and took me 1n this\nsleeper to Stockholm. I was -- had a free way. And I -- I could tell them about all Norwegian --\nall troops, German troops, were they difficult, or could they attack. I could tell them everything,\nand -- but if this had been known in Stockholm, in the Ministry of Justice, they would have been\narrested, because if you ha -- re -- if you, in front of Germany, in front of Hitler, it\u2019s only wer --\none way to be neutral, that is to be neutral. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s my view on it.",
        "Q: You decided at some point, I believe it was in 1942, that a man named Swenson --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- might be willing to become part of the secret police so that he could be a -- I guess one\nwould say a double agent in some way, yes?",
        "A: You\u2019re well -- very well advised. My -- I came to a small town called Notodden, very near to\nmy hometown. Had a -- I came to a small town called Notodden. There was a policeman, he was\na secret member of the military groups. I said to him, how are you liked in Notodden? Well, very\ngood. Will -- will you try to be a little more, yo -- not rude, but be difficult to the population.\nAnd then I said to him, why don\u2019t you try to come into the Nazi police in Oslo. And of course, he\napplied, and it was sent back for the police headquarters, Nazi, they send back, what kind of\npeople to the -- to the -- the party members in Notodden, that -- the Quisling party members. And\nthey said, \u201cHow is Swensen? Is he a -- could he be a resistance?\u201d No, he is not. He is one of us.\nOf course it was very ba -- very sad for Swensen, too, because the population there, they more or\nless hated him because they thought he -- that he really was that. So then I said, you come in to\nthe police, and he joined the police, state police, and the -- or the federal Nazi police. And then\none day we had two people that was arrested, so we agreed that Swensen had to be offered, he\nhad to -- now he had to take those people out and try to get out of Sweden, too -- over to Sweden\n[indecipherable]. He had the right papers, and he went up to the -- worked together with the\nGestapo people, the Germans, and they said okay, you can interrogate them. So he took them out\nfrom the prison, did not interrogated, put -- took them over to Sweden. And he had also\n[indecipherable] so we lost a very good spy of course, within federal state Nazi police. But he\nhelped me that -- that time. I got go know -- got his passport, police passport, so I made one\nsimilar. So now I will -- had also the passport as a secret police line within federal police. And I\ncould use that for special times, which I did. So it was good to have, to pretend being a -- a\nGestapo.",
        "Q: So did you have -- just to be light a little bit, did you have a big wallet filled with all these\ndifferent I.D.s, or did you keep them in your apartment and take one when you needed one?",
        "A: No, the reason -- you know, I came over to Sweden every fortnight -- every fourth month.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Then I took them over to Sweden and let them stay. And I had notes -- note, it was crosses\nand all that, and I left my books in Sweden every time I had new, new, left them over, new, all\nthe time.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So when the war was over, it was all in Sweden. So that\u2019s why I have them now, I could show\npeople. They\u2019re very -- very few know this in Norway, I think, but I think they\u2019re very unique,\nthe whole collection.",
        "Q: Why would somebody like Swensen agree to be a de --",
        "A: He -- he --",
        "Q: -- it\u2019s such a difficult position to be in, you know?",
        "A: No, he was -- I knew he was a good man, and I knew he was in -- in the -- in a military group,\nhe had started it in Notodden.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So he was one of the very good people. So -- but he was one of the few that really could do\nthis. Otherwise we\u2019re taken as being in resistance, you know, and arrested and tortured. So he\nhad been lucky.",
        "Q: So for how long was he acting as this secret --",
        "A: Oh, it was a very short time, about three months.",
        "Q: Did he have a family?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: But they were not t-taken.",
        "Q: They weren't?",
        "A: Yeah, well they stayed in Norway. That was difficult and different, very different. Some -- 1 --\nsome of the family would be taken, but very often they were -- well, maybe not -- they had not\nenough space in their prisons, so they had to realize, are they important, are they dangerous. So\nthey let them out after many housewife, or wifes of the resistance workers were set free after\ntwo, three months.",
        "Q: But that must have been difficult for him being in Sweden won-wondering what would\nhappen to his wife.",
        "A: Could happen anything.",
        "Q: Anybody, uh-huh.",
        "A: They could have been shot.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because that was very serious, what he had done [indecipherable] he was a real spy --",
        "Q: Yeah. Right.",
        "A: -- within their outfit.",
        "Q: Hm. When you wrote your book, you -- you talked about this feeling of restlessness that you\nwould get in a situation, a kind of sixth sense that something bad was going to happen. There\nwas one evening when you\u2019re with Baker Anderson, and his daughter, I believe.",
        "A: Yes. We ran --",
        "Q: And in the middle of the night, you th -- you thought something --",
        "A: Yeah, we went to the mountains because they had a beautiful place up there, and um -- far up\nin the mountains in Telemark district, not far from Rjukan by the way. And we went up there,\nand it was also a courier from -- from Stockholm, which had alls -- all kinds of false papers, too.\nBut we went up in the mountains there, and we sat discussing der night, and I had a feeling that -\n- it must have been -- I don\u2019t know if a sense, sixth sense, but must have been kind of a\ncomputer, and I put that thought in my brain, maybe -- he is there, maybe he is under\nsurveillance, what about his daughter? They had been arrested once, so it must have told me, get\naway. So in -- during the night, two o\u2019clock at night, I left. I -- they -- they laughed\n[indecipherable] think I was very stupid. So I left. Six o\u2019clock in the morning it was, 30 men\nwith three leaders from different [indecipherable] coming for me.",
        "Q: 30?",
        "A: 30 of them. And they were looking for Mr. Bloch. I had [indecipherable] got by the name Mr.\nBloch, I thought that was a nice name. So it was the Bloch this time. They had heard that Bloch\nwas with -- they were arrested, but they were let out after two, three months in prison. They\ndidn\u2019t -- they said, these people cannot -- they don\u2019t know anything, so -- but that was a chance.",
        "Q: And you biked --",
        "A: Yes, I biked --",
        "Q: -- to where, to your home?",
        "A: -- over in the mountains, over to Rjukan. And was in a way a little stupid because in Sweden I\nhad lost my real identity card for Gunnar Sonsteby. I had torn it to pieces so the secret police\nshouldn\u2019t -- the Swedish sec -- couldn\u2019t get it. So I went up to Rjukan to the police there. I knew\nthey didn\u2019t know I had been in Sweden or anything, I knew that. I took the chance and I got a\nnew, real passport, which is in my collection now, for Gunnar Sonsteby. So, I had luck.",
        "Q: And how did you explain that -- you just lost it, 1s that what you told them?",
        "A: Oh yes, I just told them I lost it in Oslo.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know. So I was lucky, they didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Now, Anderson was a baker, yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And did you not have something to do with his place in gro -- was it Groland Street in --",
        "A: Oh yes, I had -- since that, when -- after they had been out again, we started again. That was -\n- | think it was one of my central places in Oslo, it was, actu -- matter of fact, but then he was --\nlater on he was under suspicion again, so then I had to take him over to Sweden. But his wife,\nand la -- daughter, they were standing, helping us for a year, and then finally we had to send\nthem also over to Sweden as refugees because then the -- there was all blown, the Gestapo\n[indecipherable]. Then we disappeared of course, from that place.",
        "Q: Right. And how did you use that place? Was this a -- a meeting place for the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Meeting place for all kinds of resistance workers. It had started -- he started in a way, but he\nhad the bakery. The Germans came to Oslo and I said, you are putting your bakery at our\ndisposal. He said, no, I don\u2019t. And I took it. He didn\u2019t want it. I said -- one of the very few. And\nthen he started to send bread over to the prison. Was very near to his place, and he -- they got in\nsome bread to the prisoners there. So he -- that\u2019s how he started, and later on all the couriers\ncame to him and we met there. So it was a real central place for resistance.",
        "Q: Did you meet upstairs? The bakery\u2019s downstairs and you met upstairs?",
        "A: Yes. Was very important because you had to be in places where you were not seen or mixed\nin to other people. The shop was downstairs, it was hundreds of people in and out all the time.\nAnd you can go in there, and you can just go up the stairs to the second floor. And when I came\ninto the shop it was a very nice girl standing there behind a desk, and I had also eyesight with\nher. I knew if she had the usual way, she smiled and say hello, how are you Bloch, or -- she\nknew my different names. And then if she would say -- or just smile. If she had been something\nwrong, I would have known it immediately. I would have turned around. So that was my security\nsign. It was very simple and effective.",
        "Q: So a -- a lot of your work really depended upon people who were not necessarily working in\nthe resistance, but always supporting you.",
        "A: Oh yes. And you got supporters everywhere bac -- but you knew, among your supporters in\nOslo, it could be f -- one of the 4,000 informers. So you had to -- a little luck.",
        "Q: Did you have a gun on you all the time?",
        "A: It depended. When I had a sabotage to do, an operation in Oslo, I was armed. But when I\nworked -- walked around and organized and did all my resistance work, my intelligence work,\nhelping -- taking people over to Sweden, then I would never carry a pistol of course, because it\nwas controlled everywhere. I would run into control, I would be there.",
        "Q: Did you also have poison with you in case you were caught?",
        "A: No. No, I didn\u2019t want that.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t want it?",
        "A: I want -- I lived, and during the night I was sleeping behind a locked door, on the fourth floor,\nthird floor, and I knew I would -- they would wake me up and I could start fighting them. Now I\nalways [indecipherable] hand grenades, a couple of pistols, and the last six months I had also\nsome explosives beside my bed. Because I couldn\u2019t be taken. I knew -- they -- they knew, I\nknew. It wasn\u2019t if they interrogated me, they could torture -- they didn't need -- they knew I\nknew. So --",
        "Q: So you were simply going to fight. You were either going to get out or be killed?",
        "A: Yeah, I had to because I would ruin the whole organization, if I was -- was taken.",
        "Q: Because you knew too much?",
        "A: It was just natural thinking.",
        "Q: At one point in 1942 -- I don\u2019t -- it was the late summer in August, I think you got some sort\nof a order to borrow the printing plates from the bank, from Norway\u2019?",
        "A: Yes, that was a interesting job. I got the letter from the Minister of Finance in England that\nwas -- they wanted to print money in England because they were scarce of money in Norway. So\nthey asked me to go to the Bank of Norway, it\u2019s like -- like Fort Knox here, is it? And the -- fetch\nthe steel plates for 50 kroner and 100 kroner, that\u2019s about five dollars and 20 dollars, roughly.\nThat was very important to have, and I got to know some of the people, and of course their bank\nmanager, he -- when he saw me, a young boy of 23, in with the -- was a very bad -- my clothes\nwere a little filthy, and they said, this fellow must be crazy if I should believe him. And he said, I\nwant -- first of all, I want a few words. The man that -- running the radio from Great Britain, the\nNorwegian radio with BBC, he was very well known in Norway, and he was a personal friend of\nthe bank manager, and he said, I want five lines from him, five words with that and that. And\nthen he said, now I got rid of that fellow. Three weeks later I came up to his office and I showed\nhim, here it is, from your friend in England. And they saw it was, then he believed me, then that\nstarted the whole thing.",
        "Q: And this was real, you didn\u2019t forge this letter?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, this was a real one.",
        "A: No, it -- he knew it was the real letter. He knew that he wrote exactly what he had suggested.\nAnd he o -- or I -- he also could have had -- we talk -- we -- we talked about that. He could have\na special from that fellow if I had asked him, you say on the radio from London that for instance\nsomebody si -- a special sign that the weather is nice today, could be, but he could have got that.\nBut we didn\u2019t need it to do that, be -- but I could have d-done that easily. But then he -- the\nwhole board, went into hiding. They had [indecipherable] court, they didn\u2019t stay at home that\nnight when I had the pla -- plates and took them over to Sweden. The next morning, eight\no\u2019clock, I could call him and say they\u2019re all safe in Sweden and England.",
        "Q: How did you carry them? In what -- what did you put them in?",
        "A: I had, at that time we had no gasoline. I had a little, but the Germans didn\u2019t, and they --\nusually you can use gasoline, and we had a charcoal burner. And you had sacks with also\ncharcoal to burn and make the -- the -- the car running. And on the bottom of that sack, I had the\n-- that little package of steel plates. And we took them up to Kongsvinger, and -- but you know,\nit\u2019s always happening, something, it -- it was dark night, and the -- then the -- suddenly all the\nlights in the car disappeared, so we landed in a ditch. And I said to my friend the chauffeur, what\nthe hell are we doing now? And then a car came in, a German car, a big car with about 20\nGermans in. And they offered me to take us up again. And I said -- I said, oh, I said, please,\ncome on, I said. And when I left them I was glad that they le -- left us, I said -- I say, Auf\nWiedersehen, so nice, you know, Auf Wiedersehen. So then --",
        "Q: So was this -- you were in a car, or you were in a truck?",
        "A: No, I was in a car. It was -- I used a -- a taxi driver. He worked for me in Oslo. They were all\nperfect, I must say. I didn\u2019t find any taxi driver that was a Nazi, by the way, but my friend\nHornbeck, he -- he -- he -- that was be -- before I had got my own driver\u2019s license. But I found\nafter that, that I had to get my own driver\u2019s license. So I made one, and drove into the traffic, it\nwent all right, in \u00b042 - \u00b043.",
        "Q: Why did you decide that you had to have your own driver\u2019s license and drive yourself?",
        "A: Because I was all tra -- al-always a little -- you had to wait for the driver, you had to find one,\nand if you had your own car with false license plates, it\u2019s -- you wi -- may need it very soon, you\nknow, very quick. You can\u2019t wait for a driver, or a taxi driver.",
        "Q: So these Germans who helped you were not at all suspicious, were these soldiers?",
        "A: No, they were soldiers, and they were usually kind --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- of course, to the population, because after all, they were taught to be, try to be kind to them.\nBut when they were ordered to shoot 20 Norwegians, they would do it immediately. That was the\ndifference. They were disciplined, and they -- all the leaders, SA -- SS troops, you know what\nthey did. They got their orders from Gestapo, they worked closely with Gestapo, all of them, all\nthe leaders there. And then you were just arrested, shot.",
        "Q: So you got to Stockholm, you notified Oslo that the plates were there safely, then what\nhappens?",
        "A: They were -- during the night, they were -- they were copied and they were sent back to\nNorway.",
        "Q: Same way, you went back?",
        "A: Yeah, and I --",
        "Q: In the car?",
        "A: -- put it -- put in the place, back again.",
        "Q: And did you go to the bank at night to return these, or during the day?",
        "A: I -- I didn\u2019t do that, because at that time I didn\u2019t have -- I must not be seen in the\nneighborhood or any of those, it was too dangerous, where I had that -- it was one of the -- one of\nthe business there or firms that supplied paper and other things to the -- he knew them very well,\nso I had that supplier go to them. Teda Munsen, he was -- he knew -- he was one -- one of the --\nhe was one of the very few that [indecipherable] this. He helped --",
        "Q: So did he go from Stockholm to Oslo --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What --",
        "A: He -- he didn\u2019t -- no, he was in Oslo, only in Oslo.",
        "Q: Okay, so you --",
        "A: So he helped me there.",
        "Q: I see. And then you --",
        "A: We had other people.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah. That could be couriers and --",
        "Q: Now, were you in a particularly dangerous situation at that moment, because you had gone to\nthe bank originally and gotten the plates?",
        "A: No, there -- they hadn\u2019t seen me.",
        "Q: They hadn\u2019t seen you then?",
        "A: No, no, so -- and I was at that time Mr. Nilssen. [indecipherable] Oh, he had a beautiful\naddress, he was not there. But what about Nilssen, have you -- they\u2019ve never heard of any. So I\nwas -- I was not there. No trouble.",
        "Q: So what is this, your fifth or sixth or 10 name? You keep --",
        "A: Oh yes, it could now be number 20.",
        "Q: It could now be number 20. So the copies of the printing plates --",
        "A: That came to England, and --",
        "Q: And then they --",
        "A: -- at the same time, I had to go up to the paper mill in Bergen to get the right paper. That I\ndid, was sent over to England.",
        "Q: And how was it sent to England?",
        "A: That [indecipherable] paper.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Special paper for Norwegian money.",
        "Q: And was it flown to England or on a ship?",
        "A: Yes, taken over by courier planes from Stockholm to -- to Scotland. You know, that was very\nstrange that you had courier planes from Stockholm to England, and you had courier planes from\nStockholm to Germany. And in a way, they let it happen because they both needed this courier\nplanes.",
        "Q: So the Germans didn\u2019t si -- di -- did they check what was on the planes?",
        "A: Oh no, they couldn\u2019t check it in Sweden.",
        "Q: They couldn\u2019t, because it\u2019s a courier plane.",
        "A: Exactly. I mean, in Sweden, in neutral Sweden they couldn\u2019t check it. But [indecipherable]\nnot at all that -- that we couldn\u2019t check the Germans and the allied couldn\u2019t check.",
        "Q: So you got the paper on this plane, and the plates.",
        "A: Oh yes. I didn\u2019t -- that was not my business, that was done by SOE 1n Stockholm.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: British, or Norwegians.",
        "Q: But you found the paper?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what --",
        "A: They got the paper over.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I can\u2019t recall how much it was, but it was --",
        "Q: It had to be a lot, no? Because --",
        "A: Yeah, but first of all, they could make similar in England with the paper, they had to have\nsamples for all the paper [indecipherable] was very good paper in Norway.",
        "Q: So now they forged million -- I mean much money.",
        "A: Yes, but they -- I think they made about 20 million kroner over in England. It was very little\nused, because as I told you, it was -- all the refugees came with money, so of course that was the\nmost safe money to use, that was the real money from Norway, but they were so well done, of\ncourse, because the people, it was a very famous company in England, and they had been doing\nthat for Norwegians before. So they -- they knew exactly how to do it.",
        "Q: So they stockpiled this money in England waiting to see whether they would need it?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t use very much.",
        "A: The 20 millions",
        "Q: Yes, wow.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t use any, but I know some did in Norway.",
        "Q: It\u2019s quite a story.",
        "A: Oh, it\u2019s a interesting story.",
        "Q: Yes. Why did you take the name of Nordstrom, Gunnar Nordstrom? Do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: You know, I thought that was a nice name --",
        "Q: Nice name?",
        "A: -- and it was a name that was used up 1n the district. Could be [indecipherable] 1-it\u2019s a good\nNorwegian name. [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And did you ha -- you had a cover story for each of these names, yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You had to know --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- who the parents were, and what --",
        "A: And you see, I didn\u2019t dare to be lumberjack, because when I saw my hands, I say, oh this\nfellow cannot be a lumberjack. I didn\u2019t dare to do that, but I said I working in the stock -- some\nstock up there, some warehouse --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- by the way, was a warehouse worker. That suited more to my hands and the rest.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s talk a little bit about this so-called ordinary look that you have, that you can sort of\npass, that you\u2019re not suspicious.",
        "A: Well, as I said, my -- I had no special marks, I had ears, as I said, and a us-usual nose, eyes\nand it was no special -- if you should try to describe me it\u2019s very difficult. When you go out now,\nI\u2019m sure you -- 1f you should describe me in front of the police, you wouldn\u2019t be able, I\u2019m sure --\npretty sure, I\u2019m so average. Average looking, such an average man, so you have to -- not to\nbehave, but you had to feel one.",
        "Q: But your demeanor is very quiet. Is that --",
        "A: Is it?",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s what it appears to me.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know --",
        "Q: Is that unusu -- was that unusual in the resistance? Were people -- I mean, I suppose one often\nthinks about people who were in the resistance as very strong, and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- sort of -- and you\u2019re --",
        "A: Well, to begin with I thought that I had the big heavy people, lumberjacks, but after awhile of\ncourse -- they might be very brainy, too, of course, too, but they -- they understood that the most\nimportant thing was what did you have in your head. That was a -- of course was the most\nimportant thing.",
        "Q: Did it surprise you how easily you -- you\u2019re very innovative -- we -- yo -- do you know what I\nmean, you --",
        "A: It\u2019s just -- it\u2019s interesting that you ask that question because after the war, I thought everybody\nhad -- had the -- my experience. I thought that was usual. I didn\u2019t know that I had a very -- had --\nhad a very special job, or -- I thought everybody had the --",
        "Q: That everybody was doing this?",
        "A: Yeah, I thought so. So I was a little depressed when I found out that some things I had been --\nwasn\u2019t all done. It was much -- I think that was maybe a good thing.",
        "Q: Well, clearly it was a very good thing. But what did you think then when you realized that\nwhat you were doing was unusual? Did you --",
        "A: Yeah, I felt it was -- ordinarily I knew that it was many saboteurs. I knew they had been lucky\nand done lots of things. So I knew I was one of them. So, easy.",
        "Q: When you were in Stockholm in autumn of 1942, you were then made a liaison for all the\nnew agents?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: In Oslo, is that right, and what did --",
        "A: In Oslo, er --",
        "Q: And what does that mean?",
        "A: You know, the most important part of our Norwegian independent company number one, was\nnot to be saboteurs in Norway, also but first of all instructors in a secret army. So most of them\ncame, for instance, when I came by boat, into this west coast, I didn't -- was not in touch with\nthem, but when they came, very often they came through Oslo because it was -- you had all the\nrefugee routes, so you could come easily to -- over to Sweden at that way. When I had finished\n[indecipherable] I had to get -- go out to Sweden, and flown back to England. So then I had --\nthey knew I was in Oslo, so to me Oslo became such a small town. It is, but -- so I knew, and\nmany people knew where I was -- I could tell [indecipherable] some people knew. And then they\ngot hold on me, I could help them going out to Sweden, I could help them with a bicycle, I could\nhelp them with food, I could help renew his passport, anything. And I had country -- I had a\ncouple of men with me. So we had the -- we had the -- all kinds of connections. A doctor,\nanything.",
        "Q: If you would count up the number of connections you had in Oslo, how many people, do you\nthink?",
        "A: I-I think I met -- every day I met new people, up to 10 - 15, every day.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: It was incredible. When I came to England, I was interrogated by this [indecipherable]\nsecurity police in London, outside the London. And Is -- some people, they voiced their opinion.\nEverybody 1s arrested, but not 24. He is a spy. And I was very glad, I -- I knew, I had a feeling\nthat they -- they had to control that. So the policeman was put -- wi -- interrogating me and he\nsaid, write down all the names, you know, all leaders. I put 200 names on the paper. And he\nstarted. Why did you deal with that man? Because they had hundreds reports from many of these\nleaders already in England, so he could control. What did you -- why did you meet Petershim?\nWhat about the lawyer Hansen? What about Dr. So and So. And I could explain everything,\nnaturally, how they were arrested and not me. So they finally said, okay, we let him go back to\nNorway. He -- we are hundred percent that he is good. But to me, when you are a sus -- when\nyou are suspect and all that, it\u2019s very good that they -- I was so glad that they looked into this",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to take a break now.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Mr. Sonsteby, in October of 1942, a couple of agents were executed by the Gestapo, was that\n-- 1s that r -- let me ask it another way. Th -- w-was it very often that agents would get caught\nand tortured and executed?",
        "A: Yes. If you take our -- this company which I mentioned to you, the freedom company in\nEngland, it was about 200 when the -- in the middle of the war, and -- and about 55 were taken\nand shot. Was quite a high percentage. Twe -- nearly 20 percent, maybe 250 boys. And\nsometimes you didn\u2019t hear any, but suddenly they were caught, it was an informer very often,\nand then they were taken to custody. First of all, to begin with they were tortured and they were\nsitting there in the prison. But later on it came an order, a Hitler order that they should be\ntortured and shot within 24 hours [indecipherable] the last -- from \u201943. Der Fuehrer bifel, it was\ncalled. The Hitler\u2019s bifel, or the Hitler\u2019s order. But it could happen. And of course, not only\npeople from -- agents from England, but in the resistant groups, in Milorg for instance, if a man\nwas taken there, he was very badly beaten and -- and that could happen once a week. Could be\none that was taken and the whole -- and sometimes you could get -- arrest many who were\ntortured, and then they could give up, up to in one, two nights, and also it could have been almost\n200 arrested. Some will be -- but most of them were taken into custody, and -- or -- or sent for\nnew interrogations, and later on to Germany, to concentration camps to die. To work for two,\nthree years and then off.",
        "Q: Do you -- were there any particular incidences that come re -- that re -- you remember?\nFriends of yours who were working with you who were caught?",
        "A: Yes, it was one very bad, I think, actually on t -- here was arrested in an apartment in Oslo,\nand he was sent down to [indecipherable] shoes, where we had our machine. At that time it was a\nvery, very tough prison, and it was German guards everywhere [indecipherable] escape, to\nescape was sum -- almost impossible. But we tried to get them out, but we thought we couldn\u2019t\nmake it. So I had cook -- the cook there, they had a good cook, the Germans. And I asked him, if\nmy friend wants a poison pill, how can he do it?",
        "Q: \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201che can stand by the window and be pretending that he\u2019s cleaning the\nwindow and he loses the little cloth piece, and then I can take it out, I'll put the pill in there.\u201d\nThey did. So it worked, but some Germans had seen it, but the -- they couldn\u2019t prove it, so the\ncook was a very good cook, so they said, well, forget about it. But my friend got a pill. When he\nunderstood that we had given up all hope, he then thought to himself, now I try to flee from here.\nAnd he really almost made it. He came to the wall, and the -- jumped over the wall, he had come\nall the way out. Then a German soldier -- by the way it wa -- he was an under -- he was a\n[indecipherable] or something, and he took his rifle and shot him. So, it was very sad, but he had\nmade it, but it was a very -- an ordinary thing, a -- a soldier wouldn\u2019t do that, but this time he did\nit. So it was very un -- unhappy thing. He was -- we were very close. That could be, of course,\nseveral -- actually we had also when I was in England, two of my best men, they wanted to do\nsome anti-propaganda. It was a school in London what they called the anti-propaganda school,\nit\u2019s another English name for it, but they did some of that in Norway, trying to make the\nGermans believe that it was a secret opposition between German soldiers. I tried to pretend that.\nIt was -- and then they got hold of, from one of the districts, the Milorg had taken to -- had hid\ntwo German soldiers, but their -- they pretended to be -- didn\u2019t want to do any more, they were\ngetting out of the army, trying to get over to Sweden, they pretended. And my friends, they\nbelieved in it. And when I met these two guys, in Oslo, the Gestapo was there, and they were\nGestapo people, so they were both shot, shot in the -- in a restaur -- in a caf\u00e9. So there\u2019s one le --\none died immediately, and the other one, Taloxen, he survived, but very -- hardly wounded, but\nthen he was taken to hospital first and then to prison, and then he -- he hanged himself. He -- he\nknew he couldn\u2019t take it, he knew he would give in, give up some names, so he didn\u2019t want to\ntake the chance. I was in England when I heard this through the -- we had the wireless operators,\nthey wired it over to me, so I heard it. So then I had to pick up new people, two new people to\ntake them back to Norway. That happened.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Tell me, did -- did the agents, other than you, who had hundreds of names in your\nhead, did most of the agents only have a few names --",
        "A: Yes, usually.",
        "Q: -- because they would give -- oh.",
        "A: They were not in my position, they were just coming in from England, doing their jobs, and\nback again.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So that was a big difference. But they had names, of course. They could say, how did you\ncome to Norway?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well, we came by ship.",
        "Q: Ship, okay, that was [indecipherable] but who helped you when you came ashore? What was\nhis name? Was it [indecipherable] who could it be? That was very dangerous, of course. So they\nknew enough names to make trouble.",
        "Q: Did a lot of agents use aliases and keep changing their names, so -- so that --",
        "A: No, they ha -- they were given a name in England, before they left.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So that was another thing, I -- I had to send over to Stockholm, I had to send different forms\nfor different passports, that was also a thing. And they were very well done in -- in England, but\nif you had taken a name, and that man had been a policeman in that district, then he would be\nshifted out. If you came after two years, then suddenly -- and those names hadn\u2019t been checked,\none of the groups came right into [indecipherable]. He was [indecipherable] by a Nazi. It was a\nnew man, and it was a -- a small shopkeeper that they also could use. He was a Nazi at that time.\nSo all na -- everything, all information had to be very up to date. So that was always -- when they\nmade out the forms, passports in England, it would -- could be a little more chance. I didn\u2019t have\nthat chance in Norway. So our papers, they were more dependable.",
        "Q: Let me ask you another question about sort of your everyday life. Where were you eating?\nWhere did you eat lunch, where did you eat dinner?",
        "A: Tha-That\u2019s a ver-very interesting question. When I stay at a place, I didn\u2019t want to be seen in\ndaytime, so I usually went out in the morning, well, say nine o\u2019clock, then I didn\u2019t come back\nuntil 10 - 11.",
        "Q: At night.",
        "A: Yeah. Because I didn\u2019t want to go in and out from that building. So then I had my luncheon\nfor instance, down at the bakery. I had my dinner with a -- an old lady, a widow, where I could\ncome. I -- but then when night came I always went back to my hiding place, and I knew it had to\nbe shifted in, for instance, three months. Then the people could have seen me, and it was some --\nafter the war, some of the members of the Nazi party, they said, we didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\nNo, but when they saw a man going in, out -- for instance with a rucksack every night, they\nreported it, and they had to report it. If you were a member of the party you had to report it, and\nthat could be disastrous for us. Well, they didn\u2019t understand it, and you can explain it to them,\nbut that\u2019s the way of a traitor. Sometimes they are forced when they are in the organization. That\nwas the same in Germany. When you were in the party, you were forced to be -- more or less to\nbe a -- an informer. We had the same in Norway.",
        "Q: And what were you doing from early morning until 10 o\u2019clock at night? Were you actually\ngoing someplace to work?",
        "A: Oh -- meeting people.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: All day. And we -- a couple of times my second in command, we had a apartment which we\nused in the day, in the daytime, [indecipherable] so we could sit down, have coffee and sit and\ntalk and do our passports. We had a small -- we had a small office, which we had hired, so we\nhave spent some time there. And then when we had -- were -- had a sabotage job done, we also --\nthey used, very often -- the night, of course. Sometimes it was daylight when we did our\noperations, but some -- usually nights. And then the -- the place where I lived in for about a year,\nthen the -- the lady there, she understood because whenever it was some noise in the town, I had\nbeen away. So she said to me after the war that she thought that I maybe have carried -- carried\nthe -- the -- the case for -- or the rucksack for the saboteur. She thought I had been a helper.",
        "Q: Helper.",
        "A: But she never believed that I was the man, you see. So it -- if -- she did never think that I was\nable to do any sabotage operations. So I was an ordinary man.",
        "Q: Tell me about your conversations when you would sit with your -- with your colleagues.\nWere they practical conversations, were they political conversations, a combination?",
        "A: Well, it was very often not so -- I would say funny things, we were joking very often. We had\nthe -- the humor, very good. And all kinds of jokes were very popular and for instance, when I\nshould meet with the whole group of let\u2019s say six, seven, altogether, then we usually met at one\nof the big graveyards in Oslo. There was no money -- n-no people there, you know. And that\ncould be a very good way. It\u2019s -- for instance, we never met in restaurants. We didn\u2019t never meet\nin caf\u00e9s. It was too dangerous. We met in the open, and I can\u2019t recall that the whole group ever\nmet in one apartment. Would be disastrous. So sometimes then, communication between us\ncould be difficult, because of that. And that could -- could easily be some misunderstandings. So\nwhen we had one operation, we -- the first time the man that should help us, he had -- he had\noverslept. So he didn\u2019t show up, and we couldn't go because he had the fuse. Next time, he\nforgot the fuse, so we -- I was very angry with him, I\u2019ve never been so angry in my life, I think.\nSo, things like that could happen [indecipherable]. But was -- then made it more -- more simple,\nmore so the nerves could help out with -- they would have -- some had difficulties with their\nnerves, of course, but I had the -- we had about 15 operations in \u201944, and then one of the fellows,\nhe said, well, he s -- what will happen here? Can we come into trouble and get shot, or\nsomething. Then one other fellow said, no, 24 is with us. I had had so much luck, every time, and\nth-they were all -- we had no -- no -- then, 15 successful operations. So in a way, it was\ndangerous to think that way, but I had the luck.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So how would you communicate when you were going to do an operation, or you\nhad a task that someone should do --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- how would you get the word out so that people would know to meet you in [indecipherable |",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s interesting. Telephones.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Telephones were not tapped in Oslo. I think the reason why they couldn\u2019t tap all telephones,\nthey had the -- the -- Germans had the technicians, they had it, but they were dependent on\nNorwegian, on Norwegian technicians, all over you know. They call all -- these telephone boxes\nwere different places. I don\u2019t think they found any technician that was a Nazi. So they didn\u2019t\nthink of it, and they had thought they should do it, but they never did. So you could use the\ntelephone, but of course you wouldn\u2019t say, now we are going to have sabotage. You didn\u2019t say\nthat, but you say, we have to fetch the milk, or we meet in a shop because I got any more bread,\nor maybe a little goat cheese. That\u2019s Norwegian usually. So, telephone was very much used.\nThen, that day, they were [indecipherable] then we met, and I had all the information, all the\nintelligence, because I had been round there. I -- I could be always in the open, I was there\n[indecipherable] it. So what important in any military operation 1s intelligence before, and -- and\nintelligence very often can be wrong. But I could go there and see with my own eyes that it -- it\nwas like that. So that was a ve-very important thing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But made out on the telephone, very often.",
        "Q: Let me go back to January 1943. The -- apparently the -- the Gestapo was hunting for you,\nand you -- there was an incident when you came back to the apartment in which you were\nstaying. Could you describe that incident?",
        "A: Yes, how -- how would I know that I was wanted? I didn\u2019t know. For -- when they had the --\nwhen that fellow had given up my name, real name, I didn\u2019t know it. So I had, at that time, about\nseven different hiding places. I had -- in the town, so I could use several -- several around the\ntown. And then at one of these places I had a small house I had hired, or my friend, as a matter of\nfact, in -- small house in the gas station, you know, slow -- very near the -- the headquarters of\nthe police, and -- and then the -- I didn\u2019t know a thing, I came in from -- I\u2019d been in the woods, I\nthink had the little weekend, which I had in the middle of the week. So I came in, it was dark,\nand then when I came to the house, I thought -- everything had to be blinded at that time, every\nhouse, everything that no light should come out because of air raids, so on. So -- but I thought it\nwasn\u2019t well done in a way. I felt something must be wrong. So I didn\u2019t put the key in the door,\nthen I would just be shot, because there was some people waiting for me. And I r-read about this\nafterwards, because Fehmer, the Gestapo chief, he wrote the report about this. And he was very,\nvery angry with the people sitting there, because I dis -- I just -- they didn\u2019t catch me. I -- I rang\nthe bell. Then I would -- knew I would have a split second to think what to do. And the -- the\ndoor was thrown open -- open immediately and I -- there was a -- I got a pistol right in my face.\nAnd the -- h-he asked me to come in, and I said, to hell I don\u2019t want to come in here. And I saw\ntwo Germans, in -- gendarmes wer -- they were, and with gun -- with rifles, and then he -- I tried\nto get my pistol, but then he -- that pistol was right in my face. So I just -- when he yell at me to\ncome in, I said to hell I want to, and I hit the pistol, and the -- he -- the shot went in the air and\nthen the -- I jumped out in the dark, and the two Germans shot, they all missed. So then the -- I\nknew it was people there, that -- I knew it was people that didn\u2019t like me. So then I went to the\nsecond, it was only a hundred yards away, my second place. Then started shooting there, then I\ngot away there, and then the -- my es -- taxi driver who drove me at that time, he said -- he said,\n\u201cT-I don\u2019t think you should go to any of these places.\u201d I said, \u201cI have to see at least one more,\nthen I know they are sitting everywhere, but I have to.\u201d And when I came down to that flat, they\nhad put a safety chain inside, so I was warned. So I got away there. But then he -- my -- my taxi\ndriver ans -- he said, no, no, no, please no more. So I then found an -- a new -- brand new place,\nand had a good night\u2019s sleep, no trouble. So -- but that -- that night, many, many people are\narrested, because it was [indecipherable] all over.",
        "Q: Why wasn\u2019t two times enough for you? Why did you have to try the third?",
        "A: Well, I had to know, are they sitting everywhere? What about the rest of them?",
        "Q: And -- uh-huh.",
        "A: I had to. I tho -- I had thought so, I had to be safe, that they were sitting there. Then I was\npretty sure they were. And this guards, they were -- got into very big trouble in front of the\nGestapo chief. They really got hell, because they had the --",
        "Q: Because they missed you.",
        "A: Yeah. And h-he said in his report, the worst thing isn\u2019t that they missed him, but they didn\u2019t\nreport to me, so I lost -- I lost the whole thing. If they had reported immediately, we could have\ngone to some other places and got him, but they didn\u2019t dare to tell me that they had lost.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So it was a good thing [indecipherable] frightened by the Gestapo chief, and they got hell.",
        "Q: So tell me a couple of things. How did you find a hiding place that night? You had seven\nbeautiful --",
        "A: Yeah, I knew -- I knew about the merchant -- haberdasher, by the way, and I knew he was\ngood -- or a good man, so I went up to his place, and I said I wanted to -- I was welcomed\nimmediately. So you would all -- in a country like ours, we know all -- most people, anti-Nazis,\nyou would be supported. But it was also a chance that they could have been all of -- arrested\nbefore that. You could go right into the place. But you had the -- you needed luck.",
        "Q: Was this a circumstance where you dropped a book? Your diary, or am I wrong?",
        "A: Oh yes, I -- I lost that in that little house, and -- but I s -- I knew I had put na -- two names on\nthat notebook, so I put on some other clothes and after half an hour I went back there. I knew\nthey wouldn\u2019t start over again, lost -- they lost track of me. So I Just went right in -- almost\noutside and found it. Two days later, they -- it -- you had to try to think rationally, to say, why --\nwhy should I keep staying there? I had disappeared, why should I -- well, then you could be safe.",
        "Q: Did they chase you?",
        "A: Yes, but that would be done in that minute. But I disappeared in the darkness, it was\nimpossible.",
        "Q: Were you afraid at all that -- at that moment when they shot -- shot at you?",
        "A: Well, I was -- I was angry.",
        "Q: You were angry\u201d?",
        "A: Yes. I -- of course, yes [indecipherable] stupid people. They started up this. And I had no\nrespect for that fellow that came up there, I -- and we\u2019re -- I -- I saw he was nervous, could see it\nimmediately, he\u2019s standing with a pistol like that, you know. Very few people are quiet in that\nmoment, I\u2019m pretty sure.",
        "Q: So is that why it was so -- easier for you to hit his arm --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- because he in fact was shaking [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, a-and it was within my reach.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s not a good thing to do when you\u2019re try to hold up a man.",
        "Q: Now, let me ask you something. You were suspicious when you walked -- this wasn\u2019t outside,\nyou were -- you have to go inside to the apartment, am I right?",
        "A: No, no, the stair --",
        "Q: Or was it outside?",
        "A: -- it was a small house.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The stairs, right into the open.",
        "Q: Okay, so --",
        "A: So I was standing in front there, it was a little opened, just a little wa -- jump down three\nstairs.",
        "Q: So if you were suspicious, why did you ring the bell?",
        "A: Well, I wasn\u2019t sure. I had a feeling, and you couldn\u2019t stop there, you had to --",
        "Q: You had to find out.",
        "A: You had to know. I could have been wrong, I could have been -- I was right.",
        "Q: So, did this mean -- this set of circumstances mean that Fehmer, the -- the Gestapo head knew\nmore than you had thought he knew?",
        "A: No [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So you have -- so now you --",
        "A: But he knew -- he knew more or less that I knew most people in the -- the leaders.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He knew that.",
        "Q: And he now had your name?",
        "A: But he called -- he called me a -- he thought I was a spy, no, and -- an English spy or -- or\nfrom the government that had left Norway, which was bad enough for him. So -- but when he\nlost track, he -- he -- then he had my father, he thought that was good enough to stop me. But I\ndon\u2019t know if he -- but I -- he didn\u2019t have any [indecipherable] about me really, until we met\nafter the war.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Were you able to keep track of your father when he was sent to the concentration\ncamp and hear how he was, or [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah, and the thing was that he was sent to a concentration camp in Oslo --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- outside Oslo. So I knew when the car -- they were put to some work in Oslo. So I knew he\nwas coming with that car, but with German guards, of course. I had to be way out of sight of it.\nSo I knew that. And my -- I had to try to convince my mother that I was in England. So I\ncorresponded with her through Stockholm. So she got letters from a relative in Stockholm,\nsaying that she used another name -- name for a girl. And she -- I wrote her, she knew it was\nfrom me, from England. I was in Oslo, but I pretended so she -- I tried to make her believe that I\nwas in England. But at one time she came to the bakery. I almost met her in the stairs, but she\nwas sitting in this next room in the bakery [indecipherable] face, all the time. Sh -- I was in the\nnext room. But that was just what could happen.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t want her to know because you didn\u2019t want her to be afraid?",
        "A: Exactly, exactly, and get mixed into it. But first of all, they were afraid, you know, what will\nhappen. So that was an idea to keep that way.",
        "Q: And the Nazis never picked up these letters, the Germans?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They\u2019d never detected anything?",
        "A: Well, they had the -- the first night she was in the -- when I worked these different places,\nthey were there -- she stayed at one of these places, and the Gestapo came there during the night,\nand so he met my mother. He knew it was my mother, so --",
        "Q: Fehmer met her, or --",
        "A: Yeah, Fehmer himself.",
        "Q: Himself.",
        "A: The Gestapo chief, he came himself to that place, and -- 1-1n the night. Early -- usually like\ncame three, four o\u2019clock in the morning so they could do that, p-people wouldn\u2019t wake up, and\nher -- the friend that she was with, she was taken to the -- the concentration camp for about two\nyears, but because Fehmer asked her did I ever come there, and she said no. And then he -- for\nthat lie, you will be -- come to prison, he said. But my wife was -- my -- my mother was left\nthere.",
        "Q: Why do you think that was the case?",
        "A: Well, a --",
        "Q: Do you think your father was enough for him?",
        "A: Yeah, he -- yeah. I guess so.",
        "Q: And what was the name of the camp, was -- wa -- that your father was in?",
        "A: That was Grin1.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Grini, G-r-i-n-1, Grini.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Concentration camp, a -- right outside Oslo.",
        "Q: Now, when did you figure out that this man named Monsen was --",
        "A: An informer.",
        "Q: An informer. Was that around this time? After your father was taken?",
        "A: Yes. He was sent out, and was done in a very smart way by the security pol-police. They were\n-- the Germans were all afraid of all kinds of sicknesses, so they put people in showers, to have\nbath or showers, always. So they had a man, wa -- one of the prisoners were heading in a bath,\ntaking care of all that. They put in an informer who took care of all the prisoners. And of course\nprisoners would think [indecipherable] why don\u2019t you talk to my -- he\u2019s also a prisoner. So they\ngave him two, three, names. A friend of mine was given up, a-and he -- then he was -- came out\nfrom prison, pretended they were releasing him. So he came up to that [indecipherable] that he\nhad heard that from other prisoners, of course, because they believed in him. He was just one of\nthem. So they got a telephone, and he telephoned my friend, and he wanted to meet my friend,\nand we had to meet him, because it could be very valuable information from other prisoner\nfriends. So we had to take a chance. Of course, we didn\u2019t know exactly how it was, but it could\nhappen. So we met him in the evening, outside in Oslo, about eight o\u2019clock in the evening, very\ndark in winter. And he started to tell us greetings from two people, which were -- later, by the\nway, died in Germany, in concentration camps. One was a [indecipherable] manager in Shell\ncompany, and then -- but we -- we just didn\u2019t -- we had a feeling that he was not in the resistance\nmovement, we had a -- the way he said it, then we understood that -- we were pretty sure that he\nwas an informer. So Fehmer, the Gestapo chief, he was reporting this afterwards, we have it in\nhis report. And he -- he said that the -- the man was stupid, and my -- my man, he was stupid\nenough to give up his telephone number. And that cost him his life. So we won at that time.",
        "Q: So you had Monsen killed?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And who did -- who shot him? [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know whether --",
        "A: What a",
        "Q: -- was he shot?",
        "A: Yeah, he was shot.",
        "Q: He was shot.",
        "A: Part of the group. Some other --",
        "Q: And is this in the open, or do they --",
        "A: No, at night. They went into his bi -- apartment at night, because they had -- had his telephone\nnumber, they could find his address. Otherwise he had -- could have told -- he didn\u2019t get any\nnames from us, but he was very, very dangerous.",
        "Q: How does one make a decision as to who will assassinate the informer?",
        "A: Well, if he hadn\u2019t been taken that evening, it had been too late, next morning it would -- he\nwould report to Fehmer and he would say maybe and maybe could come with some tracks, you\nknow.",
        "Q: No, what I mean is how do you decide who\u2019s going to kill him?",
        "A: Oh well, that was a --",
        "Q: Is -- there\u2019s a volun --",
        "A: -- oh, it had to be one of the -- they were disciplined, they had -- they knew what it cost. So\none of the group would get that order.",
        "Q: But they -- 1t wouldn\u2019t be voluntary necessarily, it would be, you should be the one to do it?",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- yes, it could be.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Of course, if you had said, but th -- I knew. This was part of the game.",
        "Q: Of the game.",
        "A: That was our enemies. When you are in -- at the front, you see the enemy over there, but here\nis -- you don\u2019t see him, you just feel him, you -- it\u2019s much more difficult. So it\u2019s just a -- as --\nGerman soldiers fire at American soldiers, just that.",
        "Q: Did you -- was it -- was there ever a circumstance where -- where people doing that -- it was -\n- afterwards they suffered a great deal, even though they knew they were killing someone who\nwas an enemy, it was -- was it difficult for people to do it, do you think?",
        "A: Well, I think for Norwegians it was. And after the war, when I have been sitting in a -- ina\nofficial bureau, taking care of all the disabled veterans, and when we discussed this, if a man had\n-- had a very bad destiny, and needed a pension, for instance, a disabled person pension, then this\nwould mean something, because of his nerves, that he had been through that. It was mentioned as\na very hard thing to do. On the front it\u2019s maybe a little different, but -- but you were also face to\nface in the front in a war, so --",
        "Q: But this is more face to face, you\u2019re going into somebody\u2019s --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- apartment, into a living --",
        "A: It is.",
        "Q: -- it\u2019s different.",
        "A: It is.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, it was considered a very tough thing [indecipherable]",
        "Q: In May of 1943, you\u2019re -- you\u2019re sent to Britain.",
        "A: Yes, for --",
        "Q: Now, have you been trying to get to Britain for awhile?",
        "A: No, I hadn\u2019t -- I hadn\u2019t time.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I had no time. I had to do my ossage -- office job for them in Oslo. But then when it was\nduring the dark hours and days, it was easier, but then I was warned by the -- our secret -- we\nhave also secret police agents, few of them, they ha -- they were a group, and they warned me,\nand they said, you better get out this summer. They are after you all the time, so please get out of\nNorway for the summer. Then I went over to Stockholm, and I was asked inter -- invited to come\nover to this special operations executive training camps, trained in that company, so we --",
        "Q: That\u2019s the SOE group.",
        "A: -- yeah, and we then reached the independent company, number one, that was the name. Also\nunder Norwegian control.",
        "Q: But when you go over there, they do a very heavy security check. This is when you describe\nyou\u2019re writing down the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, and I -- I could -- they -- they said to me, don\u2019t use your name over here, it could be\nGerman spies. So that -- they asked me to put ano -- another name, the Erling Fjeld name. So I\ncame over as Erling Fjeld, it was only two people in the British secret service that knew it --\nsecurity force, that knew who I was, and I -- so I had to pretend to be Erling Fjeld for six m --\nfour months. Born in \u201916.",
        "Q: 1916?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re a little old.",
        "A: First March 16.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That was the -- the date, I remember it very well. That wasn\u2019t my real birthdate.",
        "Q: Right. And where -- where was Erling born?",
        "A: I was born in Oslo.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And my father, he had a -- a small shop.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And I think his -- his wife -- and my mother was Margda, I thought that was a nice name, so I\nbuilt up the whole thing there. So I had to go back to swe -- to Norway, and then when I came to\nthe border, Swedish border, I came there as a refugee called Erling Fjeld. And then I was given\nthe papers in Stockholm, and then I was wanted also in Sweden. So that\u2019s why I, in one of them,\nthat Erling Fjeld picture, I put in -- on the scarf, and a couple of window glasses, and -- just to be\nsafe, and I went through that control in Sweden without being discovered.",
        "Q: Tell me, when you were in this training -- wa -- a few things I would like to know. When you\nhave this new identity, and you can create my father, my mother, where I was born.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When people ask you things about your life, do you make up everything? Wer --",
        "A: No, no, that you could use your ordinary life.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Take -- pick another town.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: For instance, you could pick a town on the west coast, which was also industrial town, could\nhave been just the same. So you had to pick things that\u2019s real so you -- you didn\u2019t need to -- to\nmake it up. You tried to find things tha -- that was there. So you couldn\u2019t always -- that was the\nway to remember.",
        "Q: Tell me about the training. After a few weeks, you passed the security check, right? And then\nin June, you go to Scotland, I think?",
        "A: Yeah, and we had a training camp with only Norwegians.",
        "Q: Only Norwegians.",
        "A: Yeah, on that -- that camp. The others were all people coming from all Europe, from occupied\ncountries, but here we were together, and about 30 men for two months, very hard, tough\ntraining, day and night. And we had learned all kinds of sabotage.",
        "Q: That was the -- that was the point of the training --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah --",
        "Q: -- sabotage.",
        "A: -- by then.",

        "Q: Yes, can you explain that?",
        "A: -- [had a little trouble there. Well, I -- they didn\u2019t know that I had been in the resistance\nmovement for two, three years as one of the leaders. They didn\u2019t know that, they thought I was a\nyoung fellow coming. Erling Fjeld, they never heard about him, so they tried to make him be a\nlittle more disciplined. But I had difficulties. I -- but a -- first of all, so I didn\u2019t do very well in\nthe s -- that school, but I had the best marks in sabotage. I knew that was what I needed. The rest\nof them, I could actually teach them. So that\u2019s why, between the leader and me it was a little\ntrouble.",
        "Q: But your main purpose was to learn explosives --",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: -- anyway, so that you could do that.",
        "A: The rest I knew.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I knew they couldn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t learn me anything. He didn\u2019t know. And he didn\u2019t know I\nhad been in resistance for two and a half year.",
        "Q: And does he want you out of there? Does he try and sort of flunk you?",
        "A: Yes, he said I wouldn\u2019t -- I -- I couldn\u2019t be used. But when I came to London, I knew, of\ncourse, So -- so it\u2019s not often that it -- it -- 1t -- use -- useful man can be a good -- good pupil.",
        "Q: And who -- you had a friend, how -- Haugland is his name, Knut? Who --",
        "A: Yes, I had a very good friend from my hometown. He was later on the wireless operator on\nthe Kon-Tiki fleet, the raft.",
        "Q: A -- a what kind of operator?",
        "A: He was wireless operator together with [indecipherable] later on, because he needed some\nrelaxation after the war, because he had so much headache. So he joined [indecipherable] on the\nKon-Tiki. He lost all his troubles with -- after that trip with the raft, Kon-Tiki. So Knut and I, we\nwere close friends from Rjukan, and then he knew me, of course, he knew my name and\neverything. So he helped the leadership in England to get me over, because to send people back,\nit cost lots of money, you know, it -- it -- you had to send what they pretend to be the best. So --\nbut the leadership in London, they -- they knew, so they wanted me to go back.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t so easy to get back though, was it?",
        "A: No, it was -- you had to really -- you know, they put up a plane, it was terribly expensive, was\na big thing, you know, a four engine bomber, Halifax bomber, or could be an [indecipherable]\nAmerican, and sent back to Norway. So they had to try to find the best to send, or the ones they\nknew could do something.",
        "Q: So you parachuted back --",
        "A: Yes, back --",
        "Q: -- after a couple tries, back into --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you parachuted with weapons, or --",
        "A: With all kinds of weapons.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And I had Knut, we came together.",
        "Q: You and Knut?",
        "A: Knut Haugland, and we had in our planes, we had a -- almost two tons of weapons with us, in\nsmall parachutes that was dropped together with us, two tons of weapons.",
        "Q: And where in Norway would they be dropped? Towards the coast?",
        "A: That was the very -- in the middle of Norway, called -- a very neat place called Kongsberg.\nAnd then I dropped right there in the mountains.",
        "Q: And there there were people -- agents who were picking these things up, right?",
        "A: Yes, we did that, we had some of the farmers came with sledges, you know, in winter and\npicked them up by horses, sledges. And they had them down to -- to the road, the main road,\nwhere we could pick them up. For instance, in my way I -- I had the very close friend in the -- in\nthe gas company, and we had their truck, their tank truck, and we filled -- put all the weapons in\nthat truck -- tank wagon, and people -- when we came running, came on the road, they didn\u2019t\nbelieve it could be weapons on the tank, you know, in the tank. Thought it was gasoline, so now\nwe could be fooling the Germans, not the opposite. So some fun -- sometimes we\u2019re -- we\u2019re the\ncat, and then they\u2019re mices.",
        "Q: So when you ga -- came back, once -- did you go back to Oslo after you had parachuted into\nKongsberg?",
        "A: Yes, I go -- went immediately back, and I did nothing in the first two weeks. I want to get to\nknow a -- all -- to be -- find out what had happened, so --",
        "Q: So were you away for a year?",
        "A: Yeah, then I had been --",
        "Q: Almost a year?",
        "A: No, I had been away for -- for five months, you know.",
        "Q: Five months.",
        "A: Yeah. So now I was back where I could -- I really liked to be.",
        "Q: So after a couple of weeks, did you make the first decision about the first sabotage?",
        "A: Yeah, I stayed two -- two weeks before, so I get used to the climate. A clam -- a clam -- a\n[indecipherable]. So I knew then I could start again. Met my people, what\u2019s the situation now,\nwhere are the controls, how can you -- where can you stay, where -- what can you do? I was -- so\nI was just relaxing there for 14 days, then I could start over again.",
        "Q: And where did you stay? Did you get a new set of --",
        "A: You know, then I stayed with a -- a doctor at one of the hospitals, big hospitals. And then I --\nI was to find a place for my friend, Knut Haugland as a wireless operator. So he\u2019s put -- came to\nthat same hospital, a -- he took over my place, and he was in -- sending all his messages on the\ntop floor of the hospital. And then I found some other places, new places, another five, 10 new\nplaces where I can disappear completely, and -- under some name, some new name, could be\nKnutsen too. That\u2019s why one day we were very, very -- little stupid, because we had both put the\nname Knutsen. So when I met my friend, he said to me, \u201cWho are you?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m Knutsen.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m Knutsen.\u201d I said. So then it was Knutsen one and Knutsen two. But in -- in two months\nwe had different names again.",
        "Q: Was your first operation the bombing of the labor office?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s -- yeah, yeah, I would say so, it was the first where I was -- had that chance, and that\nwas in open daylight. You had --where they had conscripted the [indecipherable] meeting the\nnext day, next morning, about nine o\u2019clock and they wanted us to blow up the place --",
        "Q: Can you expla --",
        "A: -- in the evening.",
        "Q: Can you explain why it was so important to -- to do something at the Labor Office? What\nwere the Nazis trying to do at this time?",
        "A: See, they were trying to deal with a lot of Norwegians, several thousands, could be quite a\npercentage for all the youngsters. And they wanted them to be conscripted for labor. But it was a\nconcealed conscription for army, for German army. And the long week -- it was very hard to stop\nit, it was, of course that was sent over the radio, BBC radio, Norwegian broadcast to Norway,\nplease don\u2019t go in there, don\u2019t -- don\u2019t report. But if they didn\u2019t report, they -- all the youth, 18 --\nbetween 18 and 22, they would be fetched -- they would be taken by the police, would -- could\nbe shot or put in a concentration camp. So it didn\u2019t help them to refuse. But in Oslo they were\nsupposed to meet 3,000 in \u00b044, spring 44, 19\" May, they were supposed to meet. 18\", the day\nbefore, I was asked -- it was my first job, I was asked to -- they ene -- in the evening, same\nevening, blow up the office, and it was in -- in Norway it\u2019s very light in May, it\u2019s -- almost all\nnight. So about eight o\u2019clock in the evening we went up there, and had a -- some explosives, 14\npounds of explosives. And then we just -- in a small parcel. And then th -- we thought it was very\neasy to do this, but it was about 20 people working overtime, because they should have 3,000\npeople next morning. So I said to my friend, I cannot kill these people, I don\u2019t -- we cannot do\nthat, that\u2019s not our job. Our job 1s to ruin it. So I shouted -- went up to -- in the house, and I\nshouted as high as I could, get the hell out of there. Two minutes the house will be -- the whole\nthing will be blown up. And they all got out in a split second, more or less. All of them. And\nwhen we came out, it was only less than one minute before it exploded, so -- then the next\nmorning, nobody could meet there. I had a feeling that the -- I\u2019d heard from some historians that\nthree people went instead of 3,000. And they had troubles because the stairs wasn\u2019t there any\nmore. So we were lucky. And this helped. Next day they knew three -- 3,000 should meet, but\nthey had no place to meet. So that was start, we made several sabotage operations s-so we could\nhelp this, and it was stopped, finally. After six months, they gave up. So we -- we sent a ti -- sent\nin 5,000 youngsters [indecipherable] means quite a lot to people [indecipherable] three million.\nQuite a big percentage.",
        "Q: Were there a number of sabota -- was the Labor Office in Oslo the major --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- center? But there must have been centers all over.",
        "A: No -- yeah, that was always done. But no -- Oslo was so terribly important, because\neverything was centerized. The politicians today say -- they complain that we are centerized\ntoday, but at that time it was all centerized. Every town in Norway, if they needed even change\ntheir house, you had to go right to the -- to the headquarters in Oslo. So it meant so much. So this\nwas mostly done in Oslo.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So it meant very much for the whole country. You could use a telephone all over the country.\nSo it spread.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: That somebody was now hitting the Gestapo.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they were disappearing, hitting, ruining for them, and disappeared, all the time. So of\ncourse it was -- was not very nice for the Gestapo, really. They got into trouble.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019ll take a break now.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: Mr. Sonsteby, before we go on and talk about some other sabotage operations, let\u2019s get a\npicture of how many Germans there are to every Norwegian in -- in the country at this time.",
        "A: We were, at that time, three million people. And we had in from \u201942 - \u201943, we had about\n250,000, later on more than 300,000 troops. It was 10 percent of all the population. And if you\ntake the age of -- the military age, which was an important 17 - 18 to 32 - 34, then it was -- in\nsouthern Norway it was about three Germans to a Norwegian. And in north Norway, very little --\nit was not so many people, we had -- it could be about 10 Germans to a Norwegian in that age\ngroup. So [indecipherable] swarmed in [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So when you were walking around in Oslo during your daily meetings --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- did you always see a lot of troops?",
        "A: Oh yes, all the time. But I didn\u2019t care, I thought that they didn\u2019t touch me, and I didn\u2019t touch\nthem. So, just like that, especially you were always -- all the controls, you know, and when you\nconsider Norwegians, they were being traitors, they had the -- some of them had the control.\nThey were one man with a machine pistol, and it was five others, youngsters, Nazi boys with\nrifles. And then you were stopped, they looked in your pockets and in your -- your vest -- what\ndo you call these small things you have? Suitcases, and briefcases and looked through them,\nopened. And if you saw them, and you tried to get away, and you didn\u2019t stop, you would be shot.\nThey shot immediately these youngsters, young Norwegians. That was very bad to see, you\nknow. And they were Nazis and they didn't understand what they did. So it could even be on the\n[indecipherable] gosh that man -- if you then just moved another, they would stop you. And if\nyou didn\u2019t stop immediately, got shot.",
        "Q: A -- A few weeks after you bombed the Labor Office, you were supposed to blow up an\ninsurance company building, why?",
        "A: Well, they used some kind of a -- 1n order to call in people, they had to use what you call -- I\nwon\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know what you call it in English, but all the insurance companies had -- is a kind\nof starting up of data system. They could sort out things on new machines from the States. And it\nwas, of course, the company that had this, that was IBM. At that time in Norway, it had another\nname, the company, and they had these machines. And these machines were now put in to sort\nout people to find the addresses. They were sorted like anything 1s. It was a first kind of data --\ndata machine, I think, data. And then the Germans and the Norwegian -- the Nazi government,\nthey wanted to use this. I got the order to take it, to destroy it before they could start. So the first\n-- the machines, they were -- they were in a nice shop in Oslo, and one morning we heard that it -\n- they will be taken over by the Gestapo. So the day before, we came there, and we had a big\nstone through the window, and had three small charges of -- of explosives, and there were no\nmore after a minute. Then we disappeared completely. The next day they -- we had forgotten a\nbig machine up in the insurance company. And then we had got the new order to go up there and\ntake that. And then they had put four guards around the machine with a police dog. Now they\nwere sure it will not be taken, and the Gestapo and the -- they were hundred percent sure nobody\ncould come there. So it was impossible, but we found a new way. If it had been now we would\nhave maybe used a helicopter, but you didn\u2019t have helicopter at that time, so we had to crawl\nover three, four roofs, until we reached that building and got down there, and the -- there we\nknew it was -- the machine was under the -- the dining room, or the room where the fella -- the\nemployees had their meal. And during the night we came, we reached it, and put the explosive,\nthat would 10 -- it was a delayed bomb, 10 minutes, and then we went back, we -- if you then\nwent into the streets about 10:30, you would be taken, it was German guard all over town during\nthe night. Also because of these sabotage operations. If we came into the street, we would be\narrested immediately, our age. So we wen-went into the next building and had a fine view to\nwhere the explosion will go off and 10 minutes afterwards, again we -- we didn\u2019t want to take\nlives, so we called them again on the telephone, we said, two minutes, you\u2019d better get out. And\nthey knew from experience now, so they all got out, even with the dog, and then it was blown up,\nthe whole thing. And next morning they couldn\u2019t find anybody, no track whatsoever, which was\na very important thing. We didn\u2019t lose people, I didn\u2019t lose any of my men, and it was a -- should\ncalled a success.",
        "Q: You must have driven them crazy.",
        "A: I think it was not so easy to bear. Not to find a track, 1t was impossible. And of course it\nmeant that the people also, they didn\u2019t talk. They knew they had -- shouldn\u2019t talk about it. Of\ncourse it was wonderful for them to hear about it, and when I came the next day, I went down in\nthe district and talked to people and they said, oh, terrible people that\u2019s done this. So -- but it was\nvery popular, of course, within the population because they knew it was a fight towards the\nGestapo first of all, and to stop this conscription of our young persons. So in -- in the course of\n\"44 summer, autumn, it was all stopped. They gave up. And another thing, politically, Germans\nsometimes found that these Norwegian Nazis weren't always so good. So they were -- they were\nnow annoyed that they didn\u2019t make it and put [indecipherable] Gestapo in trouble. So they were -\n- it could be a little -- for us it was very important that it was a g -- not good relations between\nthe Germans and the Nazi Norwegians. That could also be a point.",
        "Q: Now, I guess it was about a month later, in the Lysaker factory, there -- you -- you blew up,\nwas June 28\", 1944, there was another bombing that you did. Was it following that that the\nNazis retaliated in terms of the ration cards?",
        "A: Yes, every Norwegian over 16 years old had to have a ration card. And then these youngsters,\nthey were all -- they were all refused to fetch the cards. And then we -- I was asked to steal a\nfew, to real -- make it a hold-up.",
        "Q: Now wait a minute, wait a minute, ex -- go back a little bit.",
        "A: Yes --",
        "Q: What were -- what were the Nazis doing with the cards that if you --",
        "A: They refused to give the cards to -- to the youngsters of 18 - 19 - 20 - 22.",
        "Q: Because they wanted to conscript them?",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Then they would have to report. If they didn\u2019t get a card, they had to report, that was the\nway.\\",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then I was asked to -- to put up a hold up, to take over 75,000 ration -- ration cards, and\nthat was one and a half ton. So it was not a pocket theft, 1t was a real [indecipherable]. So we -- it\nwas coming out from the printing shop with guards, the whole truck, and we stopped it. In\nNorway y-you have a han -- it\u2019s right driving you know, we have left and right, Norway was\nright. And then you can stop the car. My car came and stopped the other one, because it had\nstopped because of the right of way. So then we -- I took over the car. I just opened the front\ndoor of the truck and said, let me have a place here, I don\u2019t want to sit here in front. So I put my\ngun in the side of the watchman, of the guard, and he moved immediately. And at the same time,\ntwo of my friends went up on the -- on the platform, on the truck, where it was two other guards,\nso the car was ours. We took it over, the whole thing, with the one and a half ton of ration cards.\nThat was -- then we met another car, which I didn\u2019t know the number plates, I didn\u2019t know\nanything, I knew exact at 9:30 we will meet another car, I stopped there, and 1 -- all ration card\ngot taken over to the other truck, and that disappeared. If we were now arrested or taken, we\ndidn\u2019t know where to find the cards. They could have tortured us, but we didn\u2019t know. That was\nalso important at that time. So --",
        "Q: So then what happened?",
        "A: Then the -- some of our leaders, they had a telephone to the authorities, one way line. And\nthe-they told the authorities, now we have -- we have the cards, we want to make a deal with\nyou. And they say, what\u2019s your -- what\u2019s your address? Well, we haven\u2019t got any address.\nWhat\u2019s your telephone? We haven\u2019t got any telephone. But we want you to give a new order that\nthe youngsters should have the cards -- have their ration cards. And th -- how -- why did they\ngive in? Yes, they gave in because at this time, Germans were building up that most important\nfort in Europe. That\u2019s the strongest fort in Norway -- Norway from this time on. So if it had been\nan invasion, had been terrible to take back Norway. Would have cost millions, maybe. And then\nwe said, we are going to send these cards all over, sell them to make the black market way and it\nwill ruin your situation, the whole station here. What about people working on your fortress, and\nall that? They would have no -- no food, nothing. It would be terrible. It would ruin the whole\nsituation here. And then the Nazi government, Norwegian, they had to give in, because the\nGermans would be furious if their laborers, all those, didn\u2019t get any food at all, it will stop all\nwork. So they gave in. We had won. That was in September \u201944. They tried once more to\nconscript the lady -- the women, but that didn\u2019t work at all. So we didn't hear any more. And our\noffice, without address, without telephones, just disappeared from the Nazis.",
        "Q: And then once they agreed, you gave back the cards?",
        "A: Yes. Of course, this was done by another group, but I worked closely with them. I didn\u2019t do\nthat part of it, but my part was to get hold of the cards.",
        "Q: But that giving back process could also be dangerous because they could then catch the group",
        "A: Oh yes, that -- you are quite right, but the way we did it, well we just gave them first 20,000\ncards and then they -- we said, you can pick them up outside the bank, for instance.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And then part of it we put in small parcels, and on top of them we wrote, dangerous\nexplosives. And it was put round in Oslo and it was a hell of a trouble for the police, the Nazi\npolice, and they didn\u2019t dare to touch them. So they sent for a company outside, an -- German\nspecialists to -- on the -- to take over, and then they opened it very carefully, and it was ration --\nration cards. So we had a little fun also. But of course we were -- man -- many people into this,\nand -- but it was all coordinated very well from the top.",
        "Q: Now, ins -- in August of 1944, there was a bombing at Korzewall, with the airplane parts?",
        "A: Yes, that was an important place, 1t was very hard to find because the German camouflaged it\nwith a very big [indecipherable] very big, you know, the biggest in Norway. And half of it was\nput into stock of all kinds of spec-special re-repair parts for -- for fighter planes, Messerschmitt.\nAnd they had also a-about -- about 20 fuselage that was there, to put -- put up to the airport later\non, and we got to know it, and it was very hard to know where it was and what they did, but we\nhad to get intelligence, and one of my friends, he got to know all of it. So then we went in there,\nand the part -- the Norwegian part was no guarded, strangely enough. Was one guard, which I by\nthe way took -- had -- took hold of when we came there in the night and pacified him. And then\nwe went in there and then went into the German part in the basement, through three fences, and\nput down about 300 pounds of dynamite. We blew up the whole place. And I think it wasn\u2019t very\nnice for them to use their spare parts in Norway. And the same had to be done with ball bearing.\nBall bearing was terribly important for any nation. And Swedish -- Sweden had the best ball\nbearings in the world, you know, they had also a small place in Oslo, which was also blown up.\nAnother thing what -- how -- how would we know what to -- what take, of course, when we talk\nabout submarines. Submarines use batteries. Submarines batteries, that means sulfur, the acid.\nAnd we had two of them in Norway, so the way we could hit the submarine weapon to stop the\nsubmarines was to ruin these two acid factories, and they were stopped. So they couldn\u2019t produce\nany more, they were ruined for the rest of the war, and then it was not -- very few batteries\ncoming from Norway to -- norw -- to submarines, because at the coastline in Norway, during the\nwar you could hide every nation\u2019s fleet, submarines and everything, in Norwegian fjords. You\ncould have the whole -- the world could be placed into Norwegian fjords. And they did, of\ncourse, all those submarines, they disappeared in Norwegian fjords. So they were -- it was very\nimportant to hit them in a way of taking away sulfur, as in for batteries. Then you had to have\nexperts to help you [indecipherable]. But when we talked about Haugland, he was also wireless\noperator on the heavy water operation, and on my hometown. And so he had a [indecipherable]\nexperience. Two s-s-small town -- two small town boys were also there.",
        "Q: You said you pacified the guard. Is that another word for killing him?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Just to hold him up, and just keep watching him, or one man had to watch him all the time.\nBut the trouble with that, of course, if he doesn\u2019t start screaming. And people maybe done that,\nwithout helping it.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So that could be a -- then, when you hear about guards being -- you can shoot him, because of\nthe noise. So when you hear about that, it\u2019s a -- a necessity, because they can give a noise,\nscream or something like that, but he -- luckily he didn\u2019t. So he was a -- sent out --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Afterwards. So we tried to be very careful with the civilian at all. It was not our -- we were no\nterrorists. The Germans called us, of course, terrorists, but I -- I -- I don\u2019t know any type or\n[indecipherable] which was terrorism.",
        "Q: And in that operation at the air -- at Korzewall, there were cleaning women who used\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Yes, that was another difficult thing, of course, when you come into a place like that, if you\nhad -- if you had the cleaning womens and I had pacify them in a way that -- I said that we were\nnow -- you know, on all buses, you have different advertising, and I said I was a painter, so I\nshould paint some of the buses with the -- and they believed me. I -- I looked very innocent, and\nthey said, he\u2019s a nice painter. So then I -- then I -- when I saw all the explosives being carried in,\nI said, this is meat. So this is -- go to your -- your people in the -- with all the buses\n[indecipherable] it will be fine. So they believed me, but when they talked, and -- but then I had\nto tell them, I\u2019m very sorry, but it -- now it will be blown up, you come with us. So -- but they\ncould stop the whole operation, you know, if they had started. So that was not a way to be\ninnocent, try to make people believe.",
        "Q: And what was their response when you said to them, essentially, I was lying to you, it\u2019s now\ngoing to be blown up, get out. Were they angry at you, were they frightened of you?",
        "A: Oh no, they were frightened.",
        "Q: They were frightened.",
        "A: Like hell, of course, which is understandable, under -- but they got out. They couldn't --\nnobody hurt them afterwards.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They couldn\u2019t do anything. But people, when they see and hear about explosions, you know,\nfuses burning, it\u2019s very understandable that they are frightened.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a good thing, I think.",
        "Q: Were you with Haugland at the heavy water operation, or no --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- was he alone? I mean, was --",
        "A: I was then in Oslo, and they were trained in -- specially on that target in England, by some\nNorwegian professors that had really installed the heavy water plant at Rjukan. It\u2019s part of the\nelectr -- electrolyses. That\u2019s part of it, you get the heavy water from the --",
        "Q: And was he hurt at that operation?",
        "A: No, no, he just -- he -- he was -- the operat -- operator [indecipherable] to keep the\n[indecipherable] London advised all the time, do they go in now?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then he had to keep away so he could, if they had been lost, he had the report, so he was\nkeeping 1n touch with the -- England all the time, during operation.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about one more sabotage before we went back to England, which -- your\ngroup became known as the Oslo gang --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- right a-around this time, in 1944.",
        "A: Or also detachment, I said the name then, but --",
        "Q: Detachment?",
        "A: Yeah, in Norway it\u2019s a gang, see, which 1s -- can be --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- misunderstood, I think.",
        "Q: But in England it was known as the Oslo detachment?",
        "A: Yeah, that --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- was the British name for it.",
        "Q: But you -- there was a decision made to destroy thousands of gallons of oil.",
        "A: Yeah, that was, of course, also necessary because -- especially the special oils for -- could be\nlubricating oils, which was very important, very scarce. You know, the Germans, they really, in\nthe last part, they had no lubricating oil, they had no gasoline, it was just -- some part of their\nPanzer, you know, couldn\u2019t work because they hadn\u2019t any more -- so that, it was very scarce. So\nto ruin any gasoline tanks, or lubricating, was very important, that was part of how you could hit\nthe Germans. But as I said before, the real effort in Norway\u2019s war was the sailors and the -- or\nthat was the real thing, but so -- but everything you could do against the occupying powers in\nNorway would, of course help -- help out.",
        "Q: So you destroyed about 50,000 gallons of oil in that operation, am I right?",
        "A: Well, it could be, but it was more from the small groups, they did many, all over Norway.",
        "Q: On that day?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Not -- not on that day, but [indecipherable] occasionally.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That was done by several groups. So I -- I don\u2019t know how much it would be, enormous. It\nwas ruined, especially all the stocks in Norway.",
        "Q: Now why did you leave Oslo in November of 1944? You went back to be more highly trained\nthan you were?",
        "A: Ah -- yeah, I wanted to report now in England, in London. So I -- then I went over with a n --\nthird name. My name was this time Harald Sorensen. When I came to England I had good\npapers, when I came to the security police -- in England you can think in a wartime, security\npolice, and I got in now a-at the thi -- in the third, after third name, Harald Sorensen, electrical\nengineer. So then it was a very few people that, of course -- in there, so we [indecipherable] that\nI was let in. Could be a dangerous [indecipherable], I guess.",
        "Q: Mm. So you took a cour -- an STS 17 course, is that right?",
        "A: Yeah, that means -- no, I didn\u2019t, I -- I went up there because my course that had been before,\nso I just reported over there, to -- to try what happened, what about the experience did I have,\nwith the things I had learned in Great Britain. So that was a special course in sabotage.",
        "Q: Now at -- during that period of time when you were in London, you met with the crown\nprince, and the king?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That the case?",
        "A: Because --",
        "Q: And what was that meeting about?",
        "A: The sa -- the king heard about this country, and of course he had not been in Norway for four\nwinters now. And when he heard that I was there for the -- number 24, he knew. And then he\nasked me to come up to there to see him. Of course, it was very nice to meet them. And then the\nking said to me, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name today, Erling Fjyeld?\u201d They laughed a little, you see, and\nthen I said, \u201cNow today, your majesty, my name is Harald Sorensen, electrical engineer.\u201d And he\n-- | -- if I had invite him to go back to the resistance in Norway, he may have followed. But he\nwas a tall man, so it would be really strange if you had seen the Norwegian king up and down the\nmain street in Oslo.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But he -- he had really en-enjoy this, of course. But on the other hand, if -- when we talk\nabout Oslo and all, he was nearly crying. It was very serious to him, but he couldn\u2019t go back, and\nthen -- but then after six months, in June \u201945, he could go back.",
        "Q: What was that like for you to sit with the king of your country? Was that extraordinary?",
        "A: Oh, very, very special, of course. So I then didn\u2019t realize it, I think, because all things were\nquite serious, so -- but it -- it was -- 1t was nice.",
        "Q: Was the crown prince there as well, during that?",
        "A: Not at that day.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The other day. I met him with the others. Then he was commander in chief for all forces --",
        "Q: For all forces.",
        "A: -- Norwegian forces.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: From that time.",
        "Q: Then you went back to Oslo in December of 1944?",
        "A: Yes, with two new men, two new --",
        "Q: And is this a --",
        "A: -- members from the Oslo detachment.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s the situation for resistance when you come back? I mean, is it harder, are the --\nare the Germans being --",
        "A: Oh, it -- it was harder, and the Gestapo was very hard, it was -- it was terribly hard, terribly\ntough. Many, many people are shot, many people are put in concentration camps and now we\nheard more than rumors what happened to them in Germany, but not exactly what happened. We\nknew it was tough, but even in December we didn\u2019t realize. It wasn\u2019t realized before the\nAmericans came to the first camps. So we -- we couldn\u2019t believe it, and in, of course, summer, it\nwas not easy because they knew I was one of their leaders, and I very often got telephones, have\nyou heard from my s-son, have you -- have you -- my father, and -- and the -- it was about\n10,000, you know, that\u2019s -- for a nation of three millions, it\u2019s quite a lot. But it couldn\u2019t -- some\npeople -- some countries in Norway -- in Europe was worse, you know.",
        "Q: Am -- am I correct that one of your last sabotage operations was March 1945, you call it the\nOperation Cement Mixer?",
        "A: Yes, because the Germans really had a counterattack in the Ardennes [indecipherable] that\noften [indecipherable] it was called on, it was really tough, because it cost the allied -- I think\none place you lost 75,000 Americans in that [indecipherable]. And lots of people, and then this\nwill be reinforced by troops. We had -- Hitler had fresh troops in Norway. And he -- they had\nsome of the troops that had left Finland -- you know, Finland turned around and kicked the\nGerman out, you know. They came over to Norway, all of them, so it was some of the best\narmies in Germany, still, and now they shipped them down to Oslo, and shipped them over to --\nsoon as possible to Germany, to reinforce this offensive -- the [indecipherable] that offensive.\nBut then the order came out that try to ruin -- stop the railways, north - south going railways, try\nto sabotage it, try to derail trains and all that. And then the [indecipherable] all the repair thing\nwas done by -- by as -- the central office in Oslo. To repair the railroads, there were all the\npeople there, so then I was asked to blow up the whole administration building. So it would ruin\ntheir effort to repair and build it up again. And that was done, blown up, completely destroyed,\nall of it. And then the [indecipherable] the gar -- it was guarded usually very well, it was about\nsix, 10 guards there. One man was sitting behind a glass door, but we got -- we got hold of him,\nand -- but he s -- started shouting, as I told you before, so I -- so we had to -- I was going to take\nhim out -- outwards, but he shouted, tried to -- to warn the rest of the guard, but he -- then you\nhad to -- of course, to shoot him, and the guards, you couldn\u2019t think of those guards. They had th\n-- but they were our enemies, all of them. We hadn\u2019t invited them to Norway. So they say that\nwe stopped about -- it was four divisions trying to be sent to Germany, and I think, I\u2019m not sure\nhistorically that we stopped about two and a half division coming to reinforcement in Germany.",
        "Q: And around the country they were blowing up railroad tracks and offices --",
        "A: All the way.",
        "Q: All over?",
        "A: Yeah, all over, especially a train where railways were, so they derailed and all that.",
        "Q: And I guess timing here was very --",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s true --",
        "Q: -- significant, because whe -- of where the w -- the allies were coming, so they can more\nquickly stop --",
        "A: Yeah, and --",
        "Q: -- and there was no chance to rebuild.",
        "A: And of course, the Germans, they came as a shock to the Germans because it was all done\neight o\u2019clock in the evening, 14\" March 45. And by the way, on my father\u2019s birthday. So I -- it\nwas a good gift, when he was in prison, it was a good gift to give.",
        "Q: And did he find out about it while he was in prison?",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- 1 -- I doubt it, at that time. He may have, a little later. Rumors were going all the time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: SO --",
        "Q: The war ends May eighth, but on March sixth, the Oslo detachment or gang, and Milorg, go\nand get the archives, yes? Two days before the end.",
        "A: Yes, and then I was again, because a -- it -- German Gestapo and a Norwegian Nazis, that are\nburning all archives, started wi -- two, three days before the -- Norway was taken over, and then\n-- then we got the -- the order -- 1t was a order, we were under orders from the -- I got the order\nto try to -- try to st -- not to stop it, but to get hold of the archives, before they burnt them. We\nwere lucky, we went to the police department, and to the justice department. And we had some\nsecret agents there. They picked up the most important and we took it all out on a big truck, four\ndays before the -- Eisenhower said it\u2019s over. So it -- 1t meant quite a lot when we -- we had the\nnames, all the Gestapos, we had the names of the -- many of the traitors, otherwise, they had\nbeen burned. So they are still the archives.",
        "Q: Are they in the resistance museum, or are they --",
        "A: No, they are taken over by the National Archives. We have some very specially deep in the --\nin the cellars.",
        "Q: Now, on May eighth, y-you are made a captain.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Of what? In the army, or --",
        "A: Yes, yes --",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: -- because our outfit, the Linge company, the special -- as I said, the -- the independent\ncompany, number one, and then the -- I talked to my friend in the -- that was head of the -- all the\nMilorg groups all over the country, 40,000. And I said to him, \u201cWhat shall I -- what am I now?\u201d\nYou know, in England, they had the record, they didn\u2019t know of Sonsteby. They didn\u2019t know any\nSonsteby had been in the company. They couldn\u2019t do anything to him, they couldn\u2019t give him a\nrank, you cannot give a false name the rank. So Erling Fjeld didn\u2019t get the rank. So --",
        "Q: Sorensen didn\u2019t get a rank.",
        "A: No, sor --",
        "Q: Nordstrom didn\u2019t get --",
        "A: That\u2019s right. So then the -- Haugland said okay [indecipherable] my friend, the leader. Said,\nwell I think you\u2019re -- you\u2019re a captain. And then the -- afterwards the military off -- authorities,\nthey had to find out what -- this Sonsteby has never been here in England, never been in this\ncompany. So -- but, of course that was -- the result was that I was given that rank, but it had to\ncome six months later, because they had to find my name, they had to do it all properly. So I kept\nthe title.",
        "Q: So tell me, there are 40,000 men in Milorg?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And so --",
        "A: Not -- not in uniforms --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but they had all on [indecipherable] and when the Germans should give up, even in\nNorway, they said, we cannot surrender here, we cannot surrender our weapons. It\u2019s no allied\n[indecipherable] here, not one. Then they got the message from Eisenhower personally, directly.\nYou can rest assured, you will meet 40,000 young men, they have no uniforms, but they have an\n[indecipherable]. And then the German general said, what\u2019s -- why [indecipherable] like this, we\ncannot give away our weapons to this. Then Eisenhower sent a new message. They are all\ndisciplined, I can guarantee it, they have all weapons, they are very disciplined. And then\ngeneral, in the -- at the Lillehammer in Norway said okay, we -- then 300,000 Germans\nsurrendered to 40,000 [indecipherable] all their weapons, artillery, everything. So they had their -\n- it was necessary. They were -- as we say in Norway, they were en -- on ort en stellar, as they\nsay in German, they were in the right place at the right time.",
        "Q: And what about the other resistance groups, the Communists?",
        "A: Well, of course --",
        "Q: Or the --",
        "A: -- some of them went to the Milorg.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So -- so they had some sort, but it was very few, so they did -- I must say they did a very good\njob at trying to hurt the armies when they were there. And -- but it was at this time, the whole\nleadership in the home front, I said, after four days, when the government delegation is here, you\ntake over. We withdraw. And they all withdrew. No trouble whatsoever in Norway, the\ngovernment came and took over all the --",
        "Q: And took over?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: They had never any trouble, no -- never any groups that didn\u2019t follow orders.",
        "Q: Now, you guarded the crown prince when he came back on May -- in May -- June -- no, it\u2019s\nMay.",
        "A: Yeah, in -- in June, yeah, that\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Both -- both the crown prince, and the king when he came back later?",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s a -- first the crown prince came back in 13 May in \u201945, because he came back with\nthe government delegation.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Half the government, because that had to take over as soon as possible, we wanted that. And\nthen they -- it was 10,000 Germans in Oslo, and the crown prince come -- came in there, and I\nwas asked to -- was responsible for his life. So then I put the whole group, this detachment, or\ngang, they were his bodyguard, all of us.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: We were about 20 of bodyguard, all the way -- when the royal family came back, they had the\nsame. So we were about 20 people having that job.",
        "Q: And you were in the car, I believe, am I right?",
        "A: Yes, first of all, when the Crown Prince came, we had another friend called Max Manus,\nwhich I thought was a little quicker than me, because I could be maybe -- he -- he was like a --\nlike a good horse, he was -- so I thought that -- we were so afraid there were hand grenade\nlanding in the car, because the Germans were all around, so --",
        "Q: And the crown prince wanted to come back in an open car, right, he didn\u2019t want to have the\nclosed car.",
        "A: Yes, yeah, and I had the discussion with him, but he -- just did -- didn\u2019t -- only wanted an\nopen car, but he sat on the top there, on the -- so he just didn\u2019t care, but the fellow I had -- th-the\nchauffeur and Max Manus [indecipherable] they were both there, and the boys around him, so\nwe knew we could stop it, hope so.",
        "Q: I understand that when Quisling, who was prime minister, yes? Or a minister under\nTerboven?",
        "A: Yeah. An-anyway, called himself prime minister.",
        "Q: Yeah. But he didn\u2019t have very much power.",
        "A: No, it was nothing.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t a --",
        "A: And the Germans, they -- some -- when -- I think some of them laughed.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And -- but when you knew Hitler, you had to be careful to laugh about somebody. So they\nwere very -- for instance, Terboven, that [indecipherable] he was very careful, because that\u2019s --\nHitler like him. That had been the whole thing. If Hitler liked him, Terboven would be kicked\nout instead.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So it was very important to be friend of Hitler, I think, at that time.",
        "Q: I understand that you took him -- accompanied him to his trial, right?",
        "A: Yes, when he was t-tried, he was sitting in one prison, and it was a little too far to the place\nwhere we should -- he should be tried, courthouse. So I fetched him. And in a way I -- he was\nalone. I-I thought, how terrible, poor man. In a way. But of course, we knew what he had done\nand all that, he had been terrible, all the things. So I had a Black Maria you called that, and I put\nhim in there, and -- and then I said to a friend of mine who had been in all the prison camps,\nthree of the worst, and he had survived, and I said to him, Mr. [indecipherable] you sit in with\nQuisling. Tell him what you have experienced. But he said afterwards, wasn\u2019t very -- very many\nwords talked between us, he said. So I thought it was a very good thing that now he was there.",
        "Q: Interesting, yeah.",
        "A: But it -- one thing, I have never seen any soldier, Norwegian resistance spitting or even show\nanything in front of the Germans, never. So, and of course Quisling was a little different, but\nnobody came near to him, of course. They couldn\u2019t --",
        "Q: So there were no revenge attacks?",
        "A: No, no, not at all. Of course, we were afraid. Some people are -- can be crazy, you know.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But it was nothing, and we kept an eye all the time, so he should have a trial, a fair tria --\nwell, as fair as possible, which we think we gave him. They -- he had his lawyers. But you know,\nwhen a man is trying to overthrow your government, if you got in a situation like here, that you\nhad a man trying to overthrow the government here. You had to shoot him, you had to get rid of\nhim. And death penalty is the only thing. When a man is taking a whole country, being a traitor\nwith the whole country, then, at that time at least, it was no discussion at all.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Pretty much.",
        "Q: So he was sentenced to death?",
        "A: He was shot 24\" of October 45, after three, four months of trial.",
        "Q: Did he say anything that was signif --",
        "A: Oh yes, he tried all the time, he didn\u2019t understand.",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t understand.",
        "A: He pretended maybe. He pretended, I guess. H-He must have understood, but he was a\nstrange fellow.",
        "Q: And you met Gestapo -- the head of Gestapo, February.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And did you want to meet with him?",
        "A: Well, actually, not so much, but when I saw he was there, I just said hello to him. But I had\nno -- nothing to tell him.",
        "Q: Does he --",
        "A: I -- Pve nothing to speak with -- I couldn\u2019t -- what shall I talk to him about? So -- so just a\nfew words, said to my o-old opponent. But he had been -- he -- he really organized the torture in\nOslo from the very beginning. And I knew he had, for instance, tortured women. He did it ina\nway that put them in a cold room, and then they were naked, and they were put in cold water,\nand they were just -- tried to put them under water, almost til they died more or less, that was the\nterror, real. So he had been a terrible fellow. All the people that I\u2019d been torturing, the -- all the\ntorturists, were shot in Norway. There was about -- people that -- they enjoyed it. These people\nhad the death penalty. But when be -- when the war was over, I turned around with the Germans,\nthe war was over, no more war. So I went to Germany already 1950, started discussing paper\nbuyings from our paper mill in Norway. So we had forgotten -- we had not forgotten, but we\nknew we had to change, and saw -- I saw Germany built up as a democracy again, through those\nyears. I was in Germany from 1950 to 1970, one, at least a month. Every month I was there. I\nsaw the whole democracy being built up, and I knew Willie Brandt, the chancellor, later. And I\nthink, luckily, it was -- succeeded, in my opinion, hundred percent.",
        "Q: H-How do you explain your ability to -- the war is over, it\u2019s over, and now we start anew. Is\nthis --",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s natural, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know. A lot of people don\u2019t do that.",
        "A: Yes. Well, it\u2019s rational, let\u2019s put it that way. You had to be rational, you have to be\n[indecipherable] no way -- no way. And they were enemies, and no more because they done their\nbest to become -- but we have people in Norway, they try -- why don\u2019t you take it into the\n[indecipherable] can say that? And then we said, okay, if you realize that you\u2019ve done a mistake,\nthat you did a mistake when you joined the -- the Nazi ideas, or the Nazis, Holocaust and all that.\nIf you don\u2019t say that, that you -- you -- you were wrong, we still -- you are still my enemy. I'll\nnever understand that. You have to regret it. When the -- you regret it, and you have your\npunishment, okay. But we have some people, they will never regret it, they still think they were\nright. And that\u2019s incredible, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what\u2019s strange, in my opinion. They have a few in\nNorway also, but we were very few in -- I think all in Europe, I think. Very few.",
        "Q: When did you find out about the gas chambers and the genocide, and the mass killings?",
        "A: Well, immediately, when -- it was like [indecipherable] the troops, right? It was really, really\nreal, you know. American troops, they just didn\u2019t believe it. Russian troops, French. And so the\nreal thing we -- we had, of course, in the last part it was a -- when -- what -- it took a long time til\nwe heard that -- what happened to the Norwegian Jews. [indecipherable] not before the war was\nover, really, that you had the -- the truth of it.",
        "Q: So did that make you more angry, that -- that make you hate? It\u2019s -- I have a sense that you\ndon\u2019t hate.",

[indecipherable] help at all, and I talked to my friend, very close friend that\u2019s\nhere with me, Jule Benkel, he was -- was -- as I said, in the resistance and later on he became a --\nth-the leader -- the speaker of the house, and we talk about it. I -- I feel that he is -- he lost all his\nfamily. It\u2019s hard for him -- it\u2019s hard for me to go to the Holocaust. But I --",
        "Q: To the Holocaust Museum, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, here, and then everywhere. In Germany. And then my wife has taken young people\ndown to Auschwitz, I think it\u2019s many thousand schoolchildren, she has been with one of the\ngroups, and she said, they have changed when I have been there. They changed. It\u2019s really hard.\nSo when I first came into a remarkable [indecipherable] here, I -- I had to -- I couldn\u2019t take it, I\nhad to stop. I\u2019d been through it halfway, I say, well I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t feel that. The same\nwith [indecipherable]. And we have been [indecipherable] Norwegian authorities, our foreign\nministry, I think it\u2019s a good idea that we go out and inform people. Inform them in Norway,\ninform them everywhere where we have listeners. Yep.",
        "Q: Well, I want to thank you very much. Is there -- is there anything more you would like to add?",

And this, in the middle\nthere, that\u2019s my real passport under Gunnar Sonsteby, which of course couldn\u2019t be used after \u201942,\nwhen I was wanted. That\u2019s the one, yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the one -- yes, that\u2019s his real one.",

So that was the case. And you see in the sign there, that\u2019s the police sign, which\nyou had on the back o -- of the jacket. I think they did that to police here, they back -- they had in\nNorway at that time. So I had -- it had a number, a nu -- number, if you go down there, you see\nthe police.

Very few times we -- I -- it usually could\nbe used and help me. This is an ordinary police -- and this -- this 1s bri -- driver\u2019s license, the\nfuehrer court, fuehrer court. That\u2019s the driver\u2019s license, I had the made up driver\u2019s license like\nthe name I had, so I also changed the driver\u2019s license, all of them, and then it\u2019s maybe a little one\nof the -- the last I had, I had it renewed in 1945, so I never -- I shouldn\u2019t tell that to the police\nbecause I never had an exam. And here, you see, that\u2019s the one there, if you go back a little,\nthat\u2019s Erling Fjeld as a soldier in Great Britain. So it shows, you could give him any rank, Erling\nFjeld, he was a -- he was a fake name, so -- but it\u2019s incredible, it\u2019s all original soldiers\n[indecipherable] for duration of war.",
        "Q: Now that was when you went to Britain in 1943?",
        "A: Yeah, and then a [indecipherable] yes, where they advised me, the British security police, to\nuse a false name because of the spy risks in -- because I should go back into Norway. If you go a\nlittle on the side there, that green card there, then I was -- that card has been through about 50\nGestapo controls between Oslo and the border, and I had no difficulties. It\u2019s very -- I look\ninnocent, and the passport was ideal. You had to have that kind of passport when you came up to\nthe border. The border district had special passports with -- which I had.",

        "Q: The red one?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s a -- a real one under a false name. That was made up by Norwegian authorities in\nStockholm, and it was used only when I was going to England. And it had -- this has all stamps\nfrom British authorities.",

        "A: That\u2019s real one, made by Norwegian authorities outside Norway, of course, not the inside\nNorway. I could do because I had the garment and everything else [indecipherable] Norway, here\nin the war. Here you see some of the stamps which I had -- was made for me. And I used them,\nand I had stamps, I have a -- about 50 of them [indecipherable] papers, because when you had a\ncar, you had to have a license plates, they were false, you had to have a control sign on your pay\n-- on your window, or it said that you -- you could run a car, you could run through the night.\nYou had all -- I had all kinds of -- when I came into, four o\u2019clock in the morning, I had a sign\nshowing from the Gestapo cho -- top chief that I could do it. So everything was -- and I also had\nto make up a book. So when you were out, I had to say -- I had to know what kind of job have\nyou had tonight with the control. And I -- I -- I did all that. It was -- could be with a car, and all\nthat, could be three, four, five [indecipherable] you need -- they were all there.

I\ncould have got right in there when we tried to get out my friend, who was later shot and who we\ntried to give that poison pill. It must be very hard for him, instead of we taking out, he just got a\npill. Please take it [indecipherable]. It was terrible to -- for us, too, to do that. But he was terribly\ntortured.

They are terribly -- they are very -- and if you hit the\nman on the nose like that, he wouldn\u2019t talk to you for some hours, I can tell you. So it\u2019s a very\ndangerous thing. For German and Norwegian, I'll tell you that.",
        "Q: Okay, go ahead.",
        "A: Yeah, this is a passport which we used when you are nearing the border. When we were about\n25 from the border, 25 miles, then you would have a special passport. Every citizen there would\nhave this kind, so you can -- you are allowed to be in that district so near the border. And it was\nnecessary to have this. If you haven\u2019t got them, you would be arrested when you -- it was a\nrestricted area alongside a border. And that\u2019s a picture that I usually -- when you take a picture in\nthat box in the station all that, they\u2019re all different. Look like criminal anyway, don\u2019t you, when\nyou have these pictures taken.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a nice picture.",
        "A: And it\u2019s in German and Norwegian. So you can see the German, now you would read the\nGerman, so the -- the German guard would see immediately that you were supposed to be there.\nAnd you -- you would be arrested co -- if you hadn\u2019t a good reason to be visiting there, and even\nif you should go 30 miles in Norway, you had to have a permission. The written permission. And\nhere is that passport of Thor Hansen. Then -- this I very seldom used, because you see in the\nsignature th-that is from the general -- Nazi general Martinsen who was the most -- that\u2019s my\nhandwriting, but on the we -- left side, you see it\u2019s signed by Martinsen, he was one of the worst\nmen we had in Norway. He was a leader of the -- all these state police, all the federal Nazi\npolice, and I used to -- I know his handwriting so well now, so I can -- if you want me to sign it,\nI may be able to sign it even today.",
        "Q: So when would you use that?",
        "A: I would use it in -- for instance when I had to go to a special district in Norway with a -- to try\n-- if it was a real hurry, to get to tol -- tell people, give them some idea, then I could use this. And\nin the car, I had a car, it was the same state police car, federal -- could be a Chevrolet, could be a\nChrysler that I -- that I had, and that -- I had a driver\u2019s license with the same name, Thor Hansen,\nand that -- on the -- I -- plate there, it said -- the state police, federal police. So it could be three,\nfour documents which you had to have in order to go through that control, Gestapo control.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t have to wear a uniform in that situation?",
        "A: No, no, it\u2019s all civilian.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] uh-huh.",
        "A: We\u2019re all civilians. All Gestapo, they were ordinary civilians. Very seldom they show that\nthey were all S -- SS, they had high ranks, but they were -- to do that job, they had to be all, as in\nGermany, they were all civilian clothes. So I had -- I didn't need the -- and that\u2019s an ordinary\npassport, which every Norwegian had to have, with the number and everything. Luckily, if you\nsee the number on top there, if they had stopped me, and had the lightest suspicion that I was\nlying, then they would call that number, that was that.",
        "Q: Mm.",

        "Q: Or are you --",
        "Q: So tell me how -- why it was that you did not stay with that group.",

        "Q: So wer -- were all these different groups, representatives from them, brought to England? The\nMilorg had people who were England trained also?",

        "Q: No.",

        "Q: She was saved?",
        "Q: So, did the resistance warn Jews and say, things may happen, we want to take you out of\nSweden, or did the Jews make contact with the resistance to ask for help?",
        "Q: So what -- what was your view, that it was so alike at the time?",
        "Q: So in 1942, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening in Russia, you don\u2019t know that there are more\nthan a million people who have been shot.",
        "Q: W-Were the Swedes like the Norwegians in the sense of even though they were politically\nneutral, were they anti-Nazi in your experience?",

        "Q: So did you have -- just to be light a little bit, did you have a big wallet filled with all these\ndifferent I.D.s, or did you keep them in your apartment and take one when you needed one?",

        "Q: Did he have a family?",
        "Q: So --",

        "Q: Yeah. Right.",
        "Q: Hm. When you wrote your book, you -- you talked about this feeling of restlessness that you\nwould get in a situation, a kind of sixth sense that something bad was going to happen. There\nwas one evening when you\u2019re with Baker Anderson, and his daughter, I believe.",
        "Q: And in the middle of the night, you th -- you thought something --",

        "Q: Did you meet upstairs? The bakery\u2019s downstairs and you met upstairs?",
        "Q: So a -- a lot of your work really depended upon people who were not necessarily working in\nthe resistance, but always supporting you.",
        "Q: Did you have a gun on you all the time?",
        "Q: Did you also have poison with you in case you were caught?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t want it?",
        "Q: So you were simply going to fight. You were either going to get out or be killed?",
        "Q: Because you knew too much?",
        "Q: At one point in 1942 -- I don\u2019t -- it was the late summer in August, I think you got some sort\nof a order to borrow the printing plates from the bank, from Norway\u2019?",
        "Q: And this was real, you didn\u2019t forge this letter?",
        "Q: No, this was a real one.",

        "Q: Why did you decide that you had to have your own driver\u2019s license and drive yourself?",
        "Q: So these Germans who helped you were not at all suspicious, were these soldiers?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: So you got to Stockholm, you notified Oslo that the plates were there safely, then what\nhappens?",
        "Q: Same way, you went back?",
        "Q: In the car?",
        "Q: And did you go to the bank at night to return these, or during the day?",

        "Q: What --",
        "Q: Okay, so you --",
        "Q: I see. And then you --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Now, were you in a particularly dangerous situation at that moment, because you had gone to\nthe bank originally and gotten the plates?",
        "Q: They hadn\u2019t seen you then?",
        "Q: So what is this, your fifth or sixth or 10 name? You keep --",
        "Q: It could now be number 20. So the copies of the printing plates --",
        "Q: And then they --",
        "Q: And how was it sent to England?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: And was it flown to England or on a ship?",
        "Q: So the Germans didn\u2019t si -- di -- did they check what was on the planes?",
        "Q: They couldn\u2019t, because it\u2019s a courier plane.",

        "Q: Uh-huh.",

        "Q: So now they forged million -- I mean much money.",
        "Q: So they stockpiled this money in England waiting to see whether they would need it?",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t use very much.",
        "Q: Yes, wow.",
        "Q: It\u2019s quite a story.",

        "Q: But your demeanor is very quiet. Is that --",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s what it appears to me.",
        "Q: Is that unusu -- was that unusual in the resistance? Were people -- I mean, I suppose one often\nthinks about people who were in the resistance as very strong, and --",

        "Q: That everybody was doing this?",
        "Q: Well, clearly it was a very good thing. But what did you think then when you realized that\nwhat you were doing was unusual? Did you --",
        "Q: When you were in Stockholm in autumn of 1942, you were then made a liaison for all the\nnew agents?",
        "Q: In Oslo, is that right, and what did --",
        "Q: And what does that mean?",
        "Q: If you would count up the number of connections you had in Oslo, how many people, do you\nthink?",

        "Q: \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201che can stand by the window and be pretending that he\u2019s cleaning the\nwindow and he loses the little cloth piece, and then I can take it out, I'll put the pill in there.\u201d\nThey did. So it worked, but some Germans had seen it, but the -- they couldn\u2019t prove it, so the\ncook was a very good cook, so they said, well, forget about it. But my friend got a pill. When he\nunderstood that we had given up all hope, he then thought to himself, now I try to flee from here.\nAnd he really almost made it. He came to the wall, and the -- jumped over the wall, he had come\nall the way out.

He was -- we were very close. That could be, of course,\nseveral -- actually we had also when I was in England, two of my best men, they wanted to do\nsome anti-propaganda. It was a school in London what they called the anti-propaganda school,\nit\u2019s another English name for it, but they did some of that in Norway, trying to make the\nGermans believe that it was a secret opposition between German soldiers.

And then he said, it\u2019s an\nultimatum. You give in or we start war. And the government, I think they withdrew for about\nquarter of an hour, they came back, we take the war. So then it was on. And it had almost start --\nit had started a little before, because Germans sent in -- the Hitler\u2019s pride was a very big warship,\nand that ship was stopped, it came almost into Oslo, then it was stopped by [indecipherable]\nfortress, fortress just before Oslo, near -- near the town of Jerbok, and that big ship was hit by --\nthey had some big guns there, German guns, by the way. And that ship was sank. That ship had\n2400 people on board, and they had an orchestra, because [indecipherable] going into Oslo, to\ntake Oslo in the morning. And it was sank at the place there, that fortress. And then the king --\nthe government and part of our congress people or parliament, they could get out to Oslo,\nbecause that\u2019s -- ship. They had 800 specially trained troops to take over -- to take the\ngovernment, arrest them in the morning. But they didn't have the chance, so the government, the\n-- the king of course, and the family, and part or most of Parliament members came out to Oslo. I\ncould -- they were saved, so they could meet outside Oslo to discuss the situation. So they had --\nthey got a little time. If not, they would have been taken in Oslo for 4:30, five o\u2019clock in the\nmorning, they would all be arrested, and then we had, of course, it had been [indecipherable]\nfighting for the government. Now they could get out, king, and then later on, we fought for about\ntwo months, Norway, and then the government, they went on fighting in England. And one thing\nwhat was very important to see, we had -- at that time, you wouldn't believe it, but we had the\nthird biggest merchant fleet in the world. We had the biggest tanker fleet in the world. Three\nmillion people. It was enormous. And the -- all the ships were out, on the world. Out in the\nworld. And it was only five ships in Norway. And then -- then the war came and the government\ncame to England. They sent out the telegram to all ships, and they said, we are now at war. You\nhave to go into allied harbors, New York, London, and they all did. And then we put up a\nshipping company, the biggest shipping company the world has ever seen. Was thou -- thousand\nships, and it -- you will never see that shipping company again. It was the world biggest, it was\nincredible. And of course, then the government had money. Now they could build up this small\nfleet, the Navy, they could build up a small Air Force in Canada. And they could up -- put up\nsome specially trained paratroopers, for all the time, that could go into Norway and start fighting\nthere, behind the enemy lines.",

        "A: They came over there, and the family, royal family came over to America, luckily. And that\nwas Crown Princess Martha and her children, three children, one of them was -- is King Harald\ntoday in Norway, and they stayed in Washington there, and they were taken good care of by\nPresident Roosevelt and his wife. They were very close to them, all the time.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. And we knew that part of the family, the -- the children and the wife of the crown prince,\nthey came out to the last ship from Finland. By the way, it -- what was an American ship that\ntook them out, over Petcimal in Finland. They got out to the States that way.",

And he -- he just said, so, get out, get going, it\u2019s\ntime. But I thought I had to tell him, ask him if I had the admission. So I went -- then I went over\nand into the woods, north of Oslo, and joined a skiing company, with a friend of mine. So --",
        "A: Yeah, so that -- and next day I was fighting with the German troops coming from -- they had\nbeen then -- some of them landed in Oslo at the airport, and then they came north, and we met\nthem there, and we stopped them for about a good period, a day or two, but we had guns, we had\nrifles only. They had artillery, they had tanks, and they had all kinds of weapons which we -- you\nknow, it was the strongest army in the world, you know, so --",
        "A: But we kept going two months. You know, France fell in 14 days. So I think we did okay,\nexpect what we could expect from us.",
        "A: Well, I had a very little training in the King\u2019s Guard. But we had -- it\u2019s really interesting this\nis not so well known in Norway. We had the volunteering, military service among the students.\nWe put up that before the war. So in the -- li -- late \u201939, just beginning 1940, we had the\nvoluntary -- volunteers training there. So that was -- so you may have thought something could\nhappen. So we were right.",
        "A: That was one of my friends, he was a student leader, Knut Moyen, he started that. And later\non he became one of the leaders in a sec -- when we started building up small secret groups,\nmilitary groups.",
        "A: No, at that time it was only boys, but of course girls in -- in the resistance movement, when\nwe should go for instance, into Oslo to look after what had happened [indecipherable] we used\nour girlfriends --",
        "A: -- because the -- they were not suspected, see? But th-they did fine job. Also, all the -- was\ngirls in resistance movement did a wonderful job.",
        "A: Well, our -- we -- our skiing company fought for about three weeks in southern Norway, then\nwe had to give in, and I went back to Oslo. And then already some [indecipherable] I got the\nvery bad pneumonia, but I got through it and the same month, more or less, July 1940, I met with\nsome friends at the student\u2019s hut, out in the wilderness, north of Oslo. We started immediately\nthink, what are we going to do? What can we do? It\u2019s now two -- 200,000 Germans here. Where\ncan we start? But we thought we will start slowly, building up small groups. Maybe could be an\ninvasion, and we hope for that. And -- but one thing was what -- very important, it was all\nrumors. The papers were censored, all the newspapers. Radios taken, so now it was all rumors.\nAnybody. It was rumors, rumors. So we thought you have to do something with this, you have to\ninform people. So then we started secret newspapers. It was about 350 newspapers in Oslo at that\ntime, and I think it came up about at least so many secret newspapers, not with that circulation of\ncourse, but one of the newspaper had the circulation of 25,000. The newspaper what was that, we\nhad -- the Norwegian [indecipherable] had put up a -- with BBC, the Norwegian broadcast to\nNorway, every evening, 7:30. And then these peop -- the news was taken down, that was news\nfrom the free world. It was no propaganda, it was -- we had got all the news from the free world.\nAnd they were put down, and they were magnified -- I mean, they were copied, and then you\ncould have a sheet of paper, you could have 15, and you spread it round, very often where you\nwere working, at your -- 1t was spread, and then the Germans propaganda and anti-propaganda\nwas -- for them it was the worst thing. So Gestapo, it was the most terrible thing when -- if you\nare taken with the -- call it the clandestine newspaper, secretive, you would be arrested, and you\ncould easily be shot. Or you were put into concentration camps. I think about 20,000 did this\nduring the war, 5,000 are taken into custody, concentration camp, many, many died. And over\n200 Norwegian journalists -- call it journalist, they were shot, why? Because they fought Nazism\nwith pencil and paper. And they were shot, 200 of them are shot during the war, we hear about\nnow. So it was just incredible how the -- and it was two things that -- that Gestapo was after, but\nI had a real Gestapo force in Norway, secret police, security police, they were after people doing\nthese newspapers, and building up small military groups. And of course they were after other\ngroups, and later on, of course, the Jews, which we -- which we couldn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t understand.\nWe couldn\u2019t expect it at all, you know. They were Norwegians, they -- to me it was Norwegians,\nthey had Norwegian passport, they lived in Norway, had -- they were born there. That we\ncouldn\u2019t believe at all.",
        "A: I think it might have been 350.",
        "A: Yes. All over Norway. About the same as we had before, but of course not with that\ncirculation. It\u2019s just natural.",
        "A: Yes, for instance, when you had copied, let\u2019s say 50, you had other coming, fetching them,\nand of course we also used schoolchildren to distribute them. Could be old people, young people\nand schoolchildren, girls and boys. They were spread. But when they were grown up, they were\ntaken and of course when you had 20 people [indecipherable] you, 1t was seen by some traitors,\nsome informers, they would inform on you. They had put up the same as they had in Germany.\nSecurity police and informers. You know, in any nation you would have one to two percent\nwhich are traitors to your country. And now they found them, and they were taken -- they had the\n-- they were about 4,000 in Oslo. In -- over the two, three years, we had 4,000 informers. And\nwhen they saw man with the paper, they informed it to the Gestapo, and that man was tortured.\nAnd of course, he had been to a place getting it, and that was -- of course he -- you cannot stand\nthe torture, it\u2019s impossible with the torture. They came to Norway with Middle Age torture.\nMiddle Age torture, which I had read about, it 1 -- was history, and now they came into open with\nthe Norwegian -- with the security police and they -- then they also organized, or reorganized\nNorwegian police. So they had about, I should say, 20 percent of them got taken into a new state,\nit was federal police, state police, and they were just teached -- taught by the Gestapo, so they\nwere as good as any German Gestapo, any German security officer. So it was a very -- if you\nwere in that, call it that trade, newspaper distribution, you would have a good chance to be\narrested, tortured and killed. Was a very great risk. We all -- they all knew.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. Then they would arrest you, they would torture you and say where did you get\nit from? Where -- where did you get it from? And, of course, they couldn\u2019t stand it, and they --\nthen they were arrested, others were arrested. But it all the time they kept -- kept on, it was more\nand more newspapers, secret newspapers.",
        "A: No, we -- I tried a little to begin with, because I started with this in 1940, we already -- we\nhad the newspaper that started already autumn -- fall, \u201940, and the -- well, I think it fall -- \u00b041, it\nwas really started, on the -- the very good newspapers. So -- but 1t was written by our best brains,\nvery good articles, and today you can read them in our resistance museum, they\u2019re all there, you\ncan read them, and very interesting to read now.",
        "A: Oh yes, I tried, but I hadn't had time for this, because now I was a resistant worker on full\ntime.",
        "A: So then I started to make different aliases because after one year, the Gestapo heard about\nHans Jacobsen, he was one of the -- what the hell this is -- one of the leaders. And then the -- a\nman was tortured, and he said that well, he knew Hans Jacobsen, that was his address, and then\nof course then the Germans went out and they couldn\u2019t find any Hans Jacobsen at all, he had no\ntelephone, he had no address, he had just nothing. So they -- I was there, and then --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Then I was Hans Jacobsen.",
        "A: But then when that was known by the Germans, I changed into another name. And I really\nstarted to fake this myself. I learned it, and I think I -- I used -- when I had the false papers I had\nno -- I had made [indecipherable] myself. So I believed them, I knew they were correct.",
        "A: Well, no, it wasn\u2019t easy to start with, but for instance, will you -- you will see in one of my\npassports, one of the worst Gestapos we have ever had was a fellow called Martinsen, he was the\nhead of the Norwegian part of Gestapo, and I today -- even today I can write his signature,\nbecause I had the signa -- his signature on one of my passports, and I think I today could write K.\nA. Martinsen, pol -- chief of police, secret police in Norway. So 1 -- 1 -- that was -- I hadn\u2019t had it\nin school, so I had to start from the ke -- beginning, you know?",
        "A: A that --",
        "A: That\u2019s an interesting question, because in \u201943, January, one man was tortured, and he knew\nmy real name, Gunnar Sonsteby. I think it was my real name. Then they went right up to Rjukan\nand arrested my father as a hostage for me. But I talked with him, and I thought this would\nhappen, that was the -- the way they did it. And we agreed he\u2019d take -- said -- he said to me,\n\u201cYou take your job, Ill take mine.\u201d He was in prison -- concentration camp for two and a half\nyears. But I knew I had to go on, and he was kept in Norway because they couldn\u2019t send him to\nGermany, because then they couldn\u2019t threaten to shoot him, you know? They would have -- liked\nto have in the neighborhood so they could shoot him if it was something with me. But he\nsurvived.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And my mother knew -- my mother knew about it too.",
        "A: And they -- I helped them, they were -- I was living in Oslo, and when all the [indecipherable]\nwere taken. Then, she took a couple of these [indecipherable] up to Rjukan, it was used there as a\nsecret [indecipherable] for the rest of the war.",
        "A: Yes. Very little, because th-then it would have been too much.",
        "A: So, it wasn\u2019t --",
        "A: Yeah. In the small town like that, it wouldn\u2019t do, it had to be other people that took over.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t get bored, because it was terribly interesting. But Ih -- then, in \u00b041, I wanted to\ngo to Sweden to report because I don\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t know what about our allies? What about our\npeople in -- over the -- overseas, in the -- in London. And knew -- I knew they had their office in\nStockholm. So I went with one of my refu -- he was a refugee, over to Sweden, to report. And\nthen they told me, we can use you as a growing -- as a career between Oslo and Stockholm. So I\nstarted that. So I had about 15 - 20 of these trips between the towns, to report. Then I knew a\nlittle more what they wanted with us, from England, wh-what the allied wanted, through the\nNorwegian government and our defense people in -- in England. So our -- after awhile, I think it\nwas in \u00b042, ninth of April, \u201942, then I was in touch with the British. And I said, we\u2019re have an\norganization, I didn\u2019t know what. It was a S.O.E., special operations executive. And then they\nasked me, are you willing to go back to Norway, put up an office in Oslo for us, secret of course.\nAnd I did. So from ninth of April \u201940 to ninth of April \u201943, I had an office in Stockholm -- in\nOslo, and every fortnight 1t came a courier to me, and I had to report -- make a report, so that had\nbe ready when he came, so I wrote the report every fortnight that year, about conditions in\nNorway.",
        "A: Yes, but --",
        "A: -- [had the -- I don\u2019t know how I -- it was very se -- very special in Sweden, if you left the\ncamp, you would be arrested, but I was lucky, so I was -- I was wanted in Sweden very early. So\nwhen I was in Sweden later on, I had to be -- keep in Stockholm very -- I couldn\u2019t go into hotels,\nso -- and I had some Swedes want -- could -- they dared to keep me in their small hotel, for\ninstance, but when I -- the first time I was in Stockholm, I had to stay there three months. And\nthen I spent my days going into different small coffee shops, because in daytime I couldn\u2019t go to\nthat place where I lived, so -- but it was very natural that I was wanted in Sweden because you\ncouldn\u2019t have Norwegian refugees running all around the country, in a war. So it was very\nnatural. So I was put in -- prisoner for about three months, but then I got out again, under a false\nname. I put up a new name, a new family name, and I was put to court, and they all believed me.\nSo then I got out to Stockholm, and then in secrecy back to Oslo.",
        "A: Oh, that was the -- I picked the name, then I knew the British people in Stockholm, and the\nNorwegians, the army people, they wouldn't -- wouldn\u2019t know exactly what happened to me. So\nI put up a new name this time, I s -- I call myself Gunnar Lear. And my father was a station --\ngas station owner in Oslo, I -- my mother was Margda Lear, and all that, was a big family, and so\nthey all believed me, then Swedish state [indecipherable] security police, and I got out, but then I\nput the name Gunnar Lear, that means in English, you know it\u2019s Gunnar Liar. And when the\nBritish saw that, they really got a kick out of it. So they say, oh, this is Gunnar, certainly.",
        "A: Well, they checked, you see, but I -- I did it in -- in Karlstar in Sweden. Then I called the\nauthorities in Stockholm, and I say, do you know any Gunnar Lear? And then I had given up the\nname, it was a fellow, was Norwegian that was in Associated Press in nor -- in Norway. I -- and I\n-- | had taken him over the border, I had saved him. And then he said -- when he said -- I\nmentioned him, and he was a very well known man, of course. So it -- and he said\n[indecipherable] he said to himself. He was -- I knew he was brilliant. Oh yes, I know Gunnar L-\nLear. Oh, certainly I know him. He was very quick, and that helped me. Otherwise I would have\nbeen -- been in custody in Sweden for the rest of --",
        "A: -- for the war.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, he -- he brought me in. And we discussed what my number should be, and I -- I\nwanted the number 13. That\u2019s my lucky number. And he said well, you can\u2019t have that, another\nfellow -- so you can have 24. From then on my cover -- call it number was 24, under which I was\nknown in the resistance movement. Number 24 was -- then I knew who itt was.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. You got the money from the British and the Norwegian liaison,\nbecause they knew I was -- you know, all refugees coming to Sweden, they had money,\nNorwegian money, with them. And the -- they were -- then they were changed into Swedish\nmoney, and all this money could be used by us. So I had this Norwegian money back to Norway,\nit was sent back to us. We used millions of kroner. [indecipherable] Again, we had money in\nEngland, because o -- of our merchant fleet, and the tanker fleet. You know, our tanker fleet,\nthey say the tanker fleet -- we -- England had to have fuel -- fuel. Fuel is a war. And they needed\nfor billions of troops, everything. 60 percent of all Jews coming to that island, came from\nNorwegian [indecipherable]. So they said -- Churchill said in parliament, this 1s about one\nmillion soldiers. [indecipherable] So that\u2019s the -- the real effort was Norway -- that was the real\neffort of Norway, this fleet.",
        "A: No. But no, no, it couldn\u2019t be paid, that -- that wouldn\u2019t do. But of course, I had all kinds of\nconnections, I had enough food, I had connections everywhere. So when I went in hiding and\nlived with the family, I had all s -- always -- I couldn\u2019t sit there, eat myself, so I had all this food\nfor the whole family. I couldn\u2019t go into there with food for myself and the family didn\u2019t have it.",
        "A: So it was never difficult [indecipherable] that, and that meant so much to them. But they were\nanti-Nazi so they didn\u2019t [indecipherable] that. They could offer you meals, which they almost --\nit\u2019s impossible. So it were -- they were all patriots and th-they took a very great risk. If they\ncame there and I had to shoot myself out, the whole family would be in trouble.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, and later on, of course, with the Norwegian government in London, so it was all put\ntogether and coordinated, so they -- and I was reporting all kinds -- intelligence was first of all to\nbegin with, in all kinds of intelligence, but they needed everything from Norway. For instance,\npilots, books, to get all kinds of things, of the -- all kinds of information about nor -- Norwegian\nNazi authorities. Was very valuable things for -- for the allied, and of course, all troop\nmovements.",
        "A: Yeah, I had friends. I made friends, of course, and you could si -- when -- when I came into --\noutside Oslo and needed a contact for instance, and we -- I knew it was about four or 5,000\ninformers. I usually picked doctor. They were very -- there was very few [indecipherable] so I --\nI took the chance to run and see the doctor and he could help me. Or I would go to the teacher,\nand sometimes the priest, they were all -- that\u2019s an -- that\u2019s a chance you took, and I was always -\n- | always was lucky, or -- or I picked the right people.",
        "A: I was lucky, I had good parents, so my -- my psyche was -- my psyche -- is that right? M-\nMust have been very good, because I didn\u2019t have any. Th -- I must have been very, very -- back\nwhen God gave us the nerves, I must have been way ba -- way back in the queue.",
        "A: Well, in a way you are right. I just had to do it, 1t came naturally. So and that, of course, when\nyou heard how the Nazis had gone, with -- when you -- what they did to the German population,\nthe -- the Jews, and the same what they did -- did to all your friends. In a way it was not\nnecessary to hate them, but you had to fight them. It was natural to feel so angry. How they\ntreated 1 -- for instance, when they arrested women, it -- it -- it -- 1t was incredible that they\ntortured women. It was -- how could you believe? So we got very angry. And of course -- and\nthat was with the -- the rest of my friends. I -- I -- they had nerves, of course, but I think this was\n-- that was really what made them fight.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: That was done -- I put my own system. I took a book in Norway, and I started it with a page\nin that book, and I took -- I counted syllables, both ways, and then you could -- it was a hell of a\ntrouble, you see, so I got so angry and tired, this was like to be in school again, I sat nights and\ndid that, so I had a -- then I had the man that could take over. So --",
        "A: So he did that [indecipherable] and it came to Stockholm, and I had the same book, the same\npage, and I could easily -- we coded only the names. The rest you wrote could be written, but the\nnames were important, and the places, of course.",
        "A: By syllable.",
        "A: Yeah, you counted down in that page, on that top of the page, you find a e. Number five\ndown. So that\u2019s -- I think 1t was very simple, and I think it\u2019s almost impossible to -- if you had\nthe book and you didn\u2019t know anything about that, you couldn\u2019t solve it, I think.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Yes. But was names and places that were coded. That was the important thing.",
        "A: No, because you know, I was in Sweden, and reported every -- every quarter. So I -- I knew\nwhat I thought they knew, what they wanted.",
        "A: Oh, I had good friends, and I knew the way. I had the good papers, so I usually took a train o -\n- up to border town called Kongsvinger, and from there, then I had that -- who did help me there?\nI found a man that was head of the -- then -- the state transportation system in that town. So he\nknew everything of course. He helped, he was my agent there. So then I -- from stock -- I-I -- in\nthat period when I came on the -- and board a train, I had the control by Gestapo officers almost\nevery time. So one of my passports, which you have seen, that has been going through about 40\nGestapo controls, I think. Then I was -- I was a stock worker, working in a stock up there. So\nthey believed it, and I looked fairly in -- innocent, you know, don\u2019t you think so? So it worked\nall the time. And then how to get into the border? It was about 25 miles. Then, in -- in summer I\nused to bicycle and in winter I used something I think you know in the States, called a kick\nsledge. Have you ever heard about that?",
        "A: You find it in some places, in Wisconsin, or some th -- they know it there, kick sledge. They\nknow it in Sweden, Norway and Finland. And this kick sledge was -- took me there, and -- very\nquick --",
        "A: It\u2019s a-- a sledge, which -- it\u2019s a kind of --",
        "A: Exactly, yeah. And it built in that way so you can stand behind it. And then you --",
        "A: -- just kicked your way.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, you did it yourself.",
        "A: Keeping to that built up. So it was a very good thing.",
        "A: No, no, I had changed many times since that time. And it was so strict. If you came up to\nKongsvinger, and you\u2019re in -- you were controlled, then if you had a passport showing it was\nmade out in Oslo, you would be taken. So I had to make new passports, which they did for me up\nthere -- would -- and I did -- by the way, I did them s -- myself, but I got a form up there. And\nthen I had the passport being issued by the Kongsvinger police. Then they wouldn\u2019t say, oh gosh,\nhe\u2019s -- he\u2019s living here.",
        "A: But if you -- if you had a passport issued by Oslo police, you would be interrogated.",
        "A: Because you were suspicious then. You were man outside the -- the -- the German guard in\nthat town, of course they had a couple of security police, and they said all strangers to\nKongsvinger, be careful. They might be [indecipherable] they might be resistance workers. So\nthat\u2019s was a [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, I had so good papers. I knew they were good.",
        "A: I knew I would fool them.",
        "A: But of course, if you had some -- some stupid thing could stop it of course, but I was lucky,\nall the time. And I was from February \u201943, I was wanted and they had nice pictures of me at the\nGestapo headquarters in Oslo. Nice pictures, but wi -- an average looking man like me, I have a\nnose, I have eyes, and a mouth, ears, that\u2019s -- you cannot pick up a man -- I think you can talk to\nthe police here, it\u2019s impossible to pick up a average looking man from a picture. I knew it was\nimpossible, I -- and I -- I still, I believed it. That made me look just [indecipherable] I walked\naround in Oslo street without trouble.",
        "A: Good. If you --\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, I did, because I followed it all the time, and I -- I mention the name called Knut Moyen.\nHe and I worked very closely together. And everything I could do to help him. Then all the SOE\nsent in instructors from Great Britain to Norway, and it was a mixture there, it was a little\ndifficult, because the Norwegian organization did one thing, and the groups from England did\nanother thing. It was the Norwegian independent company number one. But then, together with\nKnut Moyen we could discuss this, and I could help him out. We were both a little unlucky\nbecause one of the people coming from England, he was arrested, he was tortured, and he\nbecame more or less an informer. Of course, this -- he was shot, he got shot right through the\nhead, and [indecipherable] so it was terrible, but we are both a little unlucky there because many,\nmany people, 200 people are arrested because of that instructor who was tortured. But otherwise,\nI took care of -- I was asked by my authorities to take care of all people come -- all agents\ncoming in from England, from the -- coming around the central part of Norway, and I took care\nof them, that was part my job, so we could discuss this, and in the -- in a couple of years it was\nall coordinated. It was a little because the [indecipherable] thought I should built up with\nNorwegians alone, but they finally saw that some of the people inside Norway that built up the\nresistance, they were clever enough to let us -- so they could cooperate, but you know, you\ncouldn\u2019t talk to each other in that way in Norway. I-I-It was all secret, you know.\nCommunications with England was difficult, everything was difficult, but in two, three years, it\nwas all coordinated within SOE, and the Norwegian authorities in England and also the home\nfront people, the military central leadership in Oslo, it was all finally coordinated from I would\nsay, 43, it started. And we had also a very good leader who was very clever, and th -- he was\nover to England a couple of times, which I was also, but he really was a good man, and he -- they\nunderstood in England that he was a -- quite a terribly clever fellow. He re -- he impressed them.\nThat helped. And we had also, of course, Communists, which didn\u2019t agree in that kind of\nleadership. But I worked together with them, so when I met the man who fought the Germans,\nthat was the important part, whatever he was. That was the important part for me, so I was lucky.\nHad a good cooperation with them, but legally on top, they would -- they would listen more, of\ncourse, to Stockholm, Moscow, than -- instead of to us. But they were not under Moscow, but to\na certain extent they listened more to Moscow than London, which 1s -- was natural, you know.\nBut it -- it worked fairly well in Norway.",
        "A: It was the same young Norwegian people, but with a different education, call it. Where --\nwhen you came over to England, you were taken care of by the British on the -- went through all\nthat training schools, and they were -- must have been the best instructors in the world, because\nwhen you met -- when you re-met Germans in the war, beginning of the war, the -- like all the\nsoldiers and all that, you -- we felt inferior. But after being instructed and trained in England, we\ndidn\u2019t feel inferior at all. We knew we had the best weapons, we knew we had the best brains to\ntrain us, so now we could be equal. And being equal, I think we were the best. I think so.",
        "A: Yes, there were all kinds of people, schoolboys, and people without schooling. It could be\ncarpenters, lumberjacks, everything. And they all formed these groups, they could go into the\nNavy, they could be pilots. They were trained in what\u2019s called Little Norway in Toronto,\nCanada. They were sent over and they did very well, and the -- first of all, I think everybody\nwant to be a pilot. So I remember when I was in Stockholm, I should go over to England, I said,\ncan I be a pilot? No, he said, y-you -- you can, but I think we have another [indecipherable] for\nyou, called the Norwegian independent company, we\u2019ll put you in there, probably, send you back\nto Norway.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, because they had done very well, I think in -- from -- you know, over London\nin 1941 and \u00b042, they did very well. So --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Not at all. It could be, of course, when you\u2019re immigrants, it can always be little small\nquarrels, but in nor -- to Norwegians, we had been very lucky, and it was -- when we came back\nto Norway, or when it started, at the end of the war, it was only one real body, and that was the\nresistance movement in -- under the leadership of the homefront people, and they were the only -\n- the Communists were -- didn\u2019t put up a group like that, so it was all -- we had -- we had no,\nshall we say possibilities th-that they should start fighting each other in Norway. We were very --\nextremely lucky. It may be that we are -- I don\u2019t know why, really. But we agreed, or we had all\n-- one common emeny -- enemy, that was Nazis. And so that was the feeling all over. I think -- I\nwould say that 95, we had 98 percent behind us in Norway. They tried whatever they could, they\ntried to make the pupils, they tried to make the teachers into nat -- Nazis. I mean, it wasn\u2019t -- it\nwas -- I think it was impossible in Norway. I think we had -- after five years hard propaganda, I\ncannot see that they had any Norwegian turning into Nazi. Only opposite, it was the opposite. So\nthat doesn\u2019t -- pure principle is nothing for us. We have democratic rules.",
        "A: Yes. That\u2019s right. And also, our -- all of our -- they call it the -- what would you call it here,\nthe top court in [indecipherable]",
        "A: The high court --",
        "A: -- people. The -- the Supreme High Court. They all withdrew already in \u201941. So they all\nwithdrew because it was no -- it was no freedom, it was no rights, it was all German propaganda,\nso they all withdrew. They were not arrested, by the way, but they disappeared into -- but didn\u2019t\ndo anything.",
        "A: Yes, teachers and professors --",
        "A: -- they did a wonderful job. To begin with, from \u00b041 - \u201942, then -- the little Nazi party, they\nwanted to have schoolchildrens into uniforms. They didn\u2019t use the swastika, but they had now a\nnew kind of a sign, it was a sun, course -- cross, sun cross. It was a kind of a cross. And -- and\nschoolchildren should now be put 1n uniforms. It was almost to that. And then they put up all\nteachers, professors were put in a new organization called some teacher\u2019s association, Nazis.\nAnd they all refused. And then they took about -- arrested thousand. 500 were sent up to\nconcentra -- tra -- concentration camp up in the north, very north, at our northest town, and then\nth -- 500 were sent over to Trawnia to be shipped up to Trawnia, to this concentration camp up in\nthe north. And they had a small passenger ship, and that -- on deck it was German soldiers and\nunderneath, in -- in the room of the ship, it was put 500 teachers. And they were sent up to the --\nin that little ship. It would take about 14 days to the very north, and then -- oh, course it was,\nwhen an allied plane saw that ship, it was all Germans. It was a small troop transported. It looked\nlike that. That was the idea for Terboven, the chief Nazi in Norway, and Quisling. They thought\nthat was a good idea, maybe allied planes would bomb them, and who had done it? That kill\nthem all. And it was protested very hard from the who -- all the population to Quisling, and to\nTerboven. Please stop it, you cannot do this. They did.",
        "A: Yeah, but the -- no, they sent them.",
        "A: They -- they didn\u2019t listen to protests, they said, this is the way we want it, we want them to be\ngone. So we don\u2019t care. And luckily, nothing happened, and they came -- but most of it -- I think\nit was many teachers that die on the way, it was very little water, very little food, and then they\ncame up to the concentration camp, and the -- after about a year, the Germans [indecipherable |\nthat little party, you know, Nazi party, they came in. So the -- they won this fight, the teachers.\nAnd it was women, and men of course.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: -- it -- well, you saw all the troubles that -- I think that \u2019 ve seen many Germans have seen the\nsame, but it was penetrated completely by security police, and the informers, that had come so\nfar in Norway, so -- but it was -- they were trying, but luckily we -- well -- well, they had -- they\nhad a power, so we could just try to in a way sabotage it, that was the way, you know, and I\nthought it was just the way to do it. To try to help it, and they -- we are -- it\u2019s very hard to get to\nknow each [indecipherable] democracy, I think. Of course, it\u2019s very hard to explain that it was\nonly two percent, one and a half percent. I-It\u2019s still hard to explain that there was so few.",
        "A: The Nazis.",
        "A: Or who were belong -- believing in the Nazi. It\u2019s really hard to explain.",
        "A: About 2,000 in all to begin with. And it was -- could have been a few Jews coming from other\ncountries to come to that safe Norway. And like Willie Brandt, for instance, and others. I know,\nof course, many Jews came, very famous Jews, doctors and musicians. But then the -- in \u00b042, it --\nthe first thing that started -- you saw my passport, they put a J there. Of course that was awful.\nWe didn\u2019t understand it, how they could do it, because in Norway, one was a Methodist, another\nwas a Baptist and another was a Jew, we didn\u2019t think of that. Now they tried to make us -- a kind\nof propaganda against Jews, but it didn\u2019t work, it -- not at all. It didn\u2019t work in -- in Norway. We\nhadn\u2019t had that impression at all. So then it started a little more, and the trouble was, now when I\nthink back, y-you know that far -- that far -- all the -- all the ar-archives, you know, all Jews.\nThey found that in [indecipherable] and in Oslo. Well, how could you help it, in a way, but then\nwas when the trouble started, you know? [indecipherable] they wouldn\u2019t know everyone, every\nfamily, and then s -- I was standing there again at the -- summer, July, August, \u201942. Then I had a\nfamily called Rubinstein, and they -- they had a feeling that it was maybe worse than they\nthought, but the trouble was that if you left for Sweden, you lost everything. You were sure to\nlose everything. You lost your house, you lost the bank account, if you had any. If -- you lost\neverything, everything when you have left Norway. Your business was taken over by authorities,\nNazi authorities. And if you didn\u2019t, then it was about -- I took the family over, and I think it was\ngood idea, but we didn\u2019t feel that all sh -- all should be done, b -- because they had Norwegian\npassports. And then the rumors came -- I would say so very much, in October, \u201942, but then\nsuddenly they went there, and the -- remember, the police had been organized, reorganized\nsomehow, it was Nazi police. And then that night, 1t was -- now it was about 700 left, about\neight, I would say, 1200 had come out to begin with, and later on it was taken over by the\nresistance the people had wanted. Every -- in those years, everyone that wanted to go out, could\nbe helped. I could easily take a family over, I had their o -- a-as I told you, I knew the people, I\ncould take easily. And I had no trouble going into Sweden. But then the 700 in all families, older\npeople, young people, and -- and children, old people. And then the -- then one day, one o -- why\n-- | heard it in this way, that one of my friends -- I knew a law -- a la -- a young lawyer, and his\nname was Hawkin [indecipherable] and he had a -- I didn\u2019t know he was a Jew, or anything, of\ncourse. I knew he had the passport, he had shown me that. Then he was a young lawyer, then\nsuddenly, six o\u2019clock in the morning, I was to hear this, they came and they said, you are arrested\nbecause of the law so and so. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that law. I never heard about it.\u201d\u201d He was a\ngood lawyer, and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, it must be wrong.\u201d So -- but then -- well, you have to\ncome with us. Your bank account is now taken, you lose your house and have you any jewels\nhere, we have to have them now. Everything. And he was so bewildered, of course, and then that\n-- it was a shock to hear that new law, two days old, and the shock to hear he had no more things\nin life. They were all taken. And then he was taken away. I heard about this, and of course, then\nit started all -- all over Norway. A few were -- then, what happened to his wife, and a little\ndaughter? Three days later, a man knocked at the door, five o\u2019clock in the morning, and they said\nget away, soon. And so she moved from the second floor, up to the third floor, to -- and the\nfamily said please come in here. Six o\u2019clock that morning the Gestapo came for her and her --\nbut she were -- they were saved. So many had --",
        "A: She was saved, and with the la -- little girl. She was taken care of and sent home to Sweden,\nso she was saved. But another thing, you know, what was terrible, I had also knew about the\nyoung man in [indecipherable]. He was a -- a Jew, 18 years old. He told me afterwards that he\nwas now in resistance. And then he got to know his parents had been told, if he doesn\u2019t report to\nthe police, they would all be taken. And of course, he gave himself up, and they took all of them.\nThe Gestapo, security police, Nazis, lies, lies, and lies, that was all they had coming from that\nGerman [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, I just -- for instance, we had a family, which I talked about, we discussed that openly.\nWhen I -- we had a -- a career, he -- they knew him very well, so they heard from Stockholm,\nthey had news from the outside world. So they -- they heard about the Crystal Night, you know,\nall that, so now they started to think, maybe it can happen here. And about the 1200, they have\nstarted to think that way. But I talked to Jule Benko my friend that is here with me. He 1s one of -\n- in our parliament he was the speaker of our [indecipherable] parliament for 12 years, and we\ndiscussed this. He was a young Jew at that time. He was in resistance, \u201942, so we discussed\nbetween ourselves now, we are discussed 1t now, what did you think -- what did I think. We had\nthe same view on this. We had just thought the same in August. So he -- then Gestapo was -- had\nwanted him, so he went over to Sweden, of course, because we had to flee, because he was now\nwanted by the Gestapo, then you had to flee. And he --",
        "A: That was that we didn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t believe that they would be arrested, or -- or w-we\ncould believe that they would be arrested to a camp in Norway, but the rest we didn\u2019t at all\nconsider. And he went over to Sweden and later on he came over to Canada and joined the\nNorwegian Air Force, and all his family are lost. All of them. So he knows what happened.",
        "A: Well, in -- they -- how they treated -- when they came into Russia, of course. But coming --\ngoing on into Norway, trying to keep them -- they tried to keep us as a civilized nation, but all\nthe -- the rule there, 1t was harder and harder. Hitler had of course hoped that th-the Nordic types\nthere would be drawn in, because -- so he was furious when they had this fight -- all the\nresistance in Norway. And we lost many. Also at this time of \u201942 August, it was thousands of\nNorwegians that were waiting to get out Sweden, because Sweden were neutral. It was important\nto us that Sweden was neutral. Without the neutral Sweden I cannot see how we could have had\na resistance at all. Because all routes towards England, over the sea, were stopped in \u201942 for\nrefugees. And it -- we could take 50,000 over to Sweden during the war. And we had them out at\nthe same times, at -- this shocked us, the Jews, we had -- could have had two, 3,000 in Oslo\nwaiting to get over to Sweden to save their lives. We als -- mixed together, you know, so --",
        "A: In my opinion, I met only at the border in small town, Gottenberg, also, and even in\nStockholm, I didn\u2019t meet anybody that had a Nazi sympathy. I knew it was some, but I -- I didn\u2019t\nmeet any. And I had a wonderful -- but I -- 1t was difficult when I -- I had my headquarters at the\n-- at the farm, on the -- right on the Swedish Norwegian border. And then I understood that on\nthe other side, the custom officer, I was pretty sure he was intelligence officer. Before I had been\nin army, lived in Sweden, I [indecipherable] custom official, with a officer -- intelligence officer,\nand I was right. So I got in touch with him, and from then on we worked together. But if it had\nbeen known, and the police, they came up and fetched me on the border, and took me 1n this\nsleeper to Stockholm. I was -- had a free way. And I -- I could tell them about all Norwegian --\nall troops, German troops, were they difficult, or could they attack. I could tell them everything,\nand -- but if this had been known in Stockholm, in the Ministry of Justice, they would have been\narrested, because if you ha -- re -- if you, in front of Germany, in front of Hitler, it\u2019s only wer --\none way to be neutral, that is to be neutral. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s my view on it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: You\u2019re well -- very well advised. My -- I came to a small town called Notodden, very near to\nmy hometown. Had a -- I came to a small town called Notodden. There was a policeman, he was\na secret member of the military groups. I said to him, how are you liked in Notodden? Well, very\ngood. Will -- will you try to be a little more, yo -- not rude, but be difficult to the population.\nAnd then I said to him, why don\u2019t you try to come into the Nazi police in Oslo. And of course, he\napplied, and it was sent back for the police headquarters, Nazi, they send back, what kind of\npeople to the -- to the -- the party members in Notodden, that -- the Quisling party members. And\nthey said, \u201cHow is Swensen? Is he a -- could he be a resistance?\u201d No, he is not. He is one of us.\nOf course it was very ba -- very sad for Swensen, too, because the population there, they more or\nless hated him because they thought he -- that he really was that. So then I said, you come in to\nthe police, and he joined the police, state police, and the -- or the federal Nazi police. And then\none day we had two people that was arrested, so we agreed that Swensen had to be offered, he\nhad to -- now he had to take those people out and try to get out of Sweden, too -- over to Sweden\n[indecipherable]. He had the right papers, and he went up to the -- worked together with the\nGestapo people, the Germans, and they said okay, you can interrogate them. So he took them out\nfrom the prison, did not interrogated, put -- took them over to Sweden. And he had also\n[indecipherable] so we lost a very good spy of course, within federal state Nazi police. But he\nhelped me that -- that time. I got go know -- got his passport, police passport, so I made one\nsimilar. So now I will -- had also the passport as a secret police line within federal police. And I\ncould use that for special times, which I did. So it was good to have, to pretend being a -- a\nGestapo.",
        "A: No, the reason -- you know, I came over to Sweden every fortnight -- every fourth month.",
        "A: Then I took them over to Sweden and let them stay. And I had notes -- note, it was crosses\nand all that, and I left my books in Sweden every time I had new, new, left them over, new, all\nthe time.",
        "A: So when the war was over, it was all in Sweden. So that\u2019s why I have them now, I could show\npeople. They\u2019re very -- very few know this in Norway, I think, but I think they\u2019re very unique,\nthe whole collection.",
        "A: He -- he --",
        "A: No, he was -- I knew he was a good man, and I knew he was in -- in the -- in a military group,\nhe had started it in Notodden.",
        "A: So he was one of the very good people. So -- but he was one of the few that really could do\nthis. Otherwise we\u2019re taken as being in resistance, you know, and arrested and tortured. So he\nhad been lucky.",
        "A: Oh, it was a very short time, about three months.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: But they were not t-taken.",
        "A: Yeah, well they stayed in Norway. That was difficult and different, very different. Some -- 1 --\nsome of the family would be taken, but very often they were -- well, maybe not -- they had not\nenough space in their prisons, so they had to realize, are they important, are they dangerous. So\nthey let them out after many housewife, or wifes of the resistance workers were set free after\ntwo, three months.",
        "A: Could happen anything.",
        "A: They could have been shot.",
        "A: Because that was very serious, what he had done [indecipherable] he was a real spy --",
        "A: -- within their outfit.",
        "A: Yes. We ran --",
        "A: Yeah, we went to the mountains because they had a beautiful place up there, and um -- far up\nin the mountains in Telemark district, not far from Rjukan by the way. And we went up there,\nand it was also a courier from -- from Stockholm, which had alls -- all kinds of false papers, too.\nBut we went up in the mountains there, and we sat discussing der night, and I had a feeling that -\n- it must have been -- I don\u2019t know if a sense, sixth sense, but must have been kind of a\ncomputer, and I put that thought in my brain, maybe -- he is there, maybe he is under\nsurveillance, what about his daughter? They had been arrested once, so it must have told me, get\naway. So in -- during the night, two o\u2019clock at night, I left. I -- they -- they laughed\n[indecipherable] think I was very stupid. So I left. Six o\u2019clock in the morning it was, 30 men\nwith three leaders from different [indecipherable] coming for me.",
        "A: 30 of them. And they were looking for Mr. Bloch. I had [indecipherable] got by the name Mr.\nBloch, I thought that was a nice name. So it was the Bloch this time. They had heard that Bloch\nwas with -- they were arrested, but they were let out after two, three months in prison. They\ndidn\u2019t -- they said, these people cannot -- they don\u2019t know anything, so -- but that was a chance.",
        "A: Yes, I biked --",
        "A: -- over in the mountains, over to Rjukan. And was in a way a little stupid because in Sweden I\nhad lost my real identity card for Gunnar Sonsteby. I had torn it to pieces so the secret police\nshouldn\u2019t -- the Swedish sec -- couldn\u2019t get it. So I went up to Rjukan to the police there. I knew\nthey didn\u2019t know I had been in Sweden or anything, I knew that. I took the chance and I got a\nnew, real passport, which is in my collection now, for Gunnar Sonsteby. So, I had luck.",
        "A: Oh yes, I just told them I lost it in Oslo.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know. So I was lucky, they didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, I had -- since that, when -- after they had been out again, we started again. That was -\n- | think it was one of my central places in Oslo, it was, actu -- matter of fact, but then he was --\nlater on he was under suspicion again, so then I had to take him over to Sweden. But his wife,\nand la -- daughter, they were standing, helping us for a year, and then finally we had to send\nthem also over to Sweden as refugees because then the -- there was all blown, the Gestapo\n[indecipherable]. Then we disappeared of course, from that place.",
        "A: Meeting place for all kinds of resistance workers. It had started -- he started in a way, but he\nhad the bakery. The Germans came to Oslo and I said, you are putting your bakery at our\ndisposal. He said, no, I don\u2019t. And I took it. He didn\u2019t want it. I said -- one of the very few. And\nthen he started to send bread over to the prison. Was very near to his place, and he -- they got in\nsome bread to the prisoners there. So he -- that\u2019s how he started, and later on all the couriers\ncame to him and we met there. So it was a real central place for resistance.",
        "A: Yes. Was very important because you had to be in places where you were not seen or mixed\nin to other people. The shop was downstairs, it was hundreds of people in and out all the time.\nAnd you can go in there, and you can just go up the stairs to the second floor. And when I came\ninto the shop it was a very nice girl standing there behind a desk, and I had also eyesight with\nher. I knew if she had the usual way, she smiled and say hello, how are you Bloch, or -- she\nknew my different names. And then if she would say -- or just smile. If she had been something\nwrong, I would have known it immediately. I would have turned around. So that was my security\nsign. It was very simple and effective.",
        "A: Oh yes. And you got supporters everywhere bac -- but you knew, among your supporters in\nOslo, it could be f -- one of the 4,000 informers. So you had to -- a little luck.",
        "A: It depended. When I had a sabotage to do, an operation in Oslo, I was armed. But when I\nworked -- walked around and organized and did all my resistance work, my intelligence work,\nhelping -- taking people over to Sweden, then I would never carry a pistol of course, because it\nwas controlled everywhere. I would run into control, I would be there.",
        "A: No. No, I didn\u2019t want that.",
        "A: I want -- I lived, and during the night I was sleeping behind a locked door, on the fourth floor,\nthird floor, and I knew I would -- they would wake me up and I could start fighting them. Now I\nalways [indecipherable] hand grenades, a couple of pistols, and the last six months I had also\nsome explosives beside my bed. Because I couldn\u2019t be taken. I knew -- they -- they knew, I\nknew. It wasn\u2019t if they interrogated me, they could torture -- they didn't need -- they knew I\nknew. So --",
        "A: Yeah, I had to because I would ruin the whole organization, if I was -- was taken.",
        "A: It was just natural thinking.",
        "A: Yes, that was a interesting job. I got the letter from the Minister of Finance in England that\nwas -- they wanted to print money in England because they were scarce of money in Norway. So\nthey asked me to go to the Bank of Norway, it\u2019s like -- like Fort Knox here, is it? And the -- fetch\nthe steel plates for 50 kroner and 100 kroner, that\u2019s about five dollars and 20 dollars, roughly.\nThat was very important to have, and I got to know some of the people, and of course their bank\nmanager, he -- when he saw me, a young boy of 23, in with the -- was a very bad -- my clothes\nwere a little filthy, and they said, this fellow must be crazy if I should believe him. And he said, I\nwant -- first of all, I want a few words. The man that -- running the radio from Great Britain, the\nNorwegian radio with BBC, he was very well known in Norway, and he was a personal friend of\nthe bank manager, and he said, I want five lines from him, five words with that and that. And\nthen he said, now I got rid of that fellow. Three weeks later I came up to his office and I showed\nhim, here it is, from your friend in England.

        "A: No.",

But then he -- the\nwhole board, went into hiding. They had [indecipherable] court, they didn\u2019t stay at home that\nnight when I had the pla -- plates and took them over to Sweden.

        "A: I had, at that time we had no gasoline. I had a little, but the Germans didn\u2019t, and they --\nusually you can use gasoline, and we had a charcoal burner.

And we took them up to Kongsvinger, and -- but you know,\nit\u2019s always happening, something, it -- it was dark night, and the -- then the -- suddenly all the\nlights in the car disappeared, so we landed in a ditch. And I said to my friend the chauffeur, what\nthe hell are we doing now? And then a car came in, a German car, a big car with about 20\nGermans in. And they offered me to take us up again. And I said -- I said, oh, I said, please,\ncome on, I said. And when I left them I was glad that they le -- left us, I said -- I say, Auf\nWiedersehen, so nice, you know, Auf Wiedersehen.

        "A: I can\u2019t recall how much it was, but it was --",
        "A: Yeah, but first of all, they could make similar in England with the paper, they had to have\nsamples for all the paper [indecipherable] was very good paper in Norway.",
        "A: Yes, but they -- I think they made about 20 million kroner over in England. It was very little\nused, because as I told you, it was -- all the refugees came with money, so of course that was the\nmost safe money to use, that was the real money from Norway, but they were so well done, of\ncourse, because the people, it was a very famous company in England, and they had been doing\nthat for Norwegians before. So they -- they knew exactly how to do it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The 20 millions",
        "A: I didn\u2019t use any, but I know some did in Norway.",
        "A: Oh, it\u2019s a interesting story.",
        "A: You know, I thought that was a nice name --",
        "A: -- and it was a name that was used up 1n the district. Could be [indecipherable] 1-it\u2019s a good\nNorwegian name. [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And you see, I didn\u2019t dare to be lumberjack, because when I saw my hands, I say, oh this\nfellow cannot be a lumberjack. I didn\u2019t dare to do that, but I said I working in the stock -- some\nstock up there, some warehouse --",
        "A: -- by the way, was a warehouse worker. That suited more to my hands and the rest.",
        "A: Well, as I said, my -- I had no special marks, I had ears, as I said, and a us-usual nose, eyes\nand it was no special -- if you should try to describe me it\u2019s very difficult. When you go out now,\nI\u2019m sure you -- 1f you should describe me in front of the police, you wouldn\u2019t be able, I\u2019m sure --\npretty sure, I\u2019m so average. Average looking, such an average man, so you have to -- not to\nbehave, but you had to feel one.",
        "A: Is it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, to begin with I thought that I had the big heavy people, lumberjacks, but after awhile of\ncourse -- they might be very brainy, too, of course, too, but they -- they understood that the most\nimportant thing was what did you have in your head. That was a -- of course was the most\nimportant thing.",
        "A: It\u2019s just -- it\u2019s interesting that you ask that question because after the war, I thought everybody\nhad -- had the -- my experience. I thought that was usual. I didn\u2019t know that I had a very -- had --\nhad a very special job, or -- I thought everybody had the --",
        "A: Yeah, I thought so. So I was a little depressed when I found out that some things I had been --\nwasn\u2019t all done. It was much -- I think that was maybe a good thing.",
        "A: Yeah, I felt it was -- ordinarily I knew that it was many saboteurs. I knew they had been lucky\nand done lots of things. So I knew I was one of them. So, easy.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: In Oslo, er --",
        "A: You know, the most important part of our Norwegian independent company number one, was\nnot to be saboteurs in Norway, also but first of all instructors in a secret army. So most of them\ncame, for instance, when I came by boat, into this west coast, I didn't -- was not in touch with\nthem, but when they came, very often they came through Oslo because it was -- you had all the\nrefugee routes, so you could come easily to -- over to Sweden at that way. When I had finished\n[indecipherable] I had to get -- go out to Sweden, and flown back to England. So then I had --\nthey knew I was in Oslo, so to me Oslo became such a small town. It is, but -- so I knew, and\nmany people knew where I was -- I could tell [indecipherable] some people knew. And then they\ngot hold on me, I could help them going out to Sweden, I could help them with a bicycle, I could\nhelp them with food, I could help renew his passport, anything. And I had country -- I had a\ncouple of men with me. So we had the -- we had the -- all kinds of connections. A doctor,\nanything.",
        "A: I-I think I met -- every day I met new people, up to 10 - 15, every day.",
        "A: It was incredible. When I came to England, I was interrogated by this [indecipherable]\nsecurity police in London, outside the London. And Is -- some people, they voiced their opinion.\nEverybody 1s arrested, but not 24. He is a spy. And I was very glad, I -- I knew, I had a feeling\nthat they -- they had to control that. So the policeman was put -- wi -- interrogating me and he\nsaid, write down all the names, you know, all leaders. I put 200 names on the paper. And he\nstarted. Why did you deal with that man? Because they had hundreds reports from many of these\nleaders already in England, so he could control. What did you -- why did you meet Petershim?\nWhat about the lawyer Hansen? What about Dr. So and So. And I could explain everything,\nnaturally, how they were arrested and not me. So they finally said, okay, we let him go back to\nNorway. He -- we are hundred percent that he is good. But to me, when you are a sus -- when\nyou are suspect and all that, it\u2019s very good that they -- I was so glad that they looked into this",
        "A: [indecipherable |\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Yes. If you take our -- this company which I mentioned to you, the freedom company in\nEngland, it was about 200 when the -- in the middle of the war, and -- and about 55 were taken\nand shot. Was quite a high percentage. Twe -- nearly 20 percent, maybe 250 boys. And\nsometimes you didn\u2019t hear any, but suddenly they were caught, it was an informer very often,\nand then they were taken to custody. First of all, to begin with they were tortured and they were\nsitting there in the prison. But later on it came an order, a Hitler order that they should be\ntortured and shot within 24 hours [indecipherable] the last -- from \u201943. Der Fuehrer bifel, it was\ncalled. The Hitler\u2019s bifel, or the Hitler\u2019s order. But it could happen. And of course, not only\npeople from -- agents from England, but in the resistant groups, in Milorg for instance, if a man\nwas taken there, he was very badly beaten and -- and that could happen once a week. Could be\none that was taken and the whole -- and sometimes you could get -- arrest many who were\ntortured, and then they could give up, up to in one, two nights, and also it could have been almost\n200 arrested. Some will be -- but most of them were taken into custody, and -- or -- or sent for\nnew interrogations, and later on to Germany, to concentration camps to die. To work for two,\nthree years and then off.",
        "A: Yes, it was one very bad, I think, actually on t -- here was arrested in an apartment in Oslo,\nand he was sent down to [indecipherable] shoes, where we had our machine. At that time it was a\nvery, very tough prison, and it was German guards everywhere [indecipherable] escape, to\nescape was sum -- almost impossible. But we tried to get them out, but we thought we couldn\u2019t\nmake it. So I had cook -- the cook there, they had a good cook, the Germans. And I asked him, if\nmy friend wants a poison pill, how can he do it?\none died immediately, and the other one, Taloxen, he survived, but very -- hardly wounded, but\nthen he was taken to hospital first and then to prison, and then he -- he hanged himself. He -- he\nknew he couldn\u2019t take it, he knew he would give in, give up some names, so he didn\u2019t want to\ntake the chance. I was in England when I heard this through the -- we had the wireless operators,\nthey wired it over to me, so I heard it. So then I had to pick up new people, two new people to\ntake them back to Norway. That happened.",
        "A: Yes, usually.",
        "A: They were not in my position, they were just coming in from England, doing their jobs, and\nback again.",
        "A: So that was a big difference. But they had names, of course. They could say, how did you\ncome to Norway?",
        "A: Well, we came by ship.",
        "A: No, they ha -- they were given a name in England, before they left.",
        "A: So that was another thing, I -- I had to send over to Stockholm, I had to send different forms\nfor different passports, that was also a thing. And they were very well done in -- in England, but\nif you had taken a name, and that man had been a policeman in that district, then he would be\nshifted out. If you came after two years, then suddenly -- and those names hadn\u2019t been checked,\none of the groups came right into [indecipherable]. He was [indecipherable] by a Nazi. It was a\nnew man, and it was a -- a small shopkeeper that they also could use. He was a Nazi at that time.\nSo all na -- everything, all information had to be very up to date. So that was always -- when they\nmade out the forms, passports in England, it would -- could be a little more chance. I didn\u2019t have\nthat chance in Norway. So our papers, they were more dependable.",
        "A: Tha-That\u2019s a ver-very interesting question. When I stay at a place, I didn\u2019t want to be seen in\ndaytime, so I usually went out in the morning, well, say nine o\u2019clock, then I didn\u2019t come back\nuntil 10 - 11.",
        "A: Yeah. Because I didn\u2019t want to go in and out from that building. So then I had my luncheon\nfor instance, down at the bakery. I had my dinner with a -- an old lady, a widow, where I could\ncome. I -- but then when night came I always went back to my hiding place, and I knew it had to\nbe shifted in, for instance, three months. Then the people could have seen me, and it was some --\nafter the war, some of the members of the Nazi party, they said, we didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\nNo, but when they saw a man going in, out -- for instance with a rucksack every night, they\nreported it, and they had to report it. If you were a member of the party you had to report it, and\nthat could be disastrous for us. Well, they didn\u2019t understand it, and you can explain it to them,\nbut that\u2019s the way of a traitor. Sometimes they are forced when they are in the organization. That\nwas the same in Germany. When you were in the party, you were forced to be -- more or less to\nbe a -- an informer. We had the same in Norway.",
        "A: Oh -- meeting people.",
        "A: All day. And we -- a couple of times my second in command, we had a apartment which we\nused in the day, in the daytime, [indecipherable] so we could sit down, have coffee and sit and\ntalk and do our passports. We had a small -- we had a small office, which we had hired, so we\nhave spent some time there. And then when we had -- were -- had a sabotage job done, we also --\nthey used, very often -- the night, of course. Sometimes it was daylight when we did our\noperations, but some -- usually nights. And then the -- the place where I lived in for about a year,\nthen the -- the lady there, she understood because whenever it was some noise in the town, I had\nbeen away. So she said to me after the war that she thought that I maybe have carried -- carried\nthe -- the -- the case for -- or the rucksack for the saboteur. She thought I had been a helper.",
        "A: But she never believed that I was the man, you see. So it -- if -- she did never think that I was\nable to do any sabotage operations. So I was an ordinary man.",
        "A: Well, it was very often not so -- I would say funny things, we were joking very often. We had\nthe -- the humor, very good. And all kinds of jokes were very popular and for instance, when I\nshould meet with the whole group of let\u2019s say six, seven, altogether, then we usually met at one\nof the big graveyards in Oslo. There was no money -- n-no people there, you know. And that\ncould be a very good way. It\u2019s -- for instance, we never met in restaurants. We didn\u2019t never meet\nin caf\u00e9s. It was too dangerous. We met in the open, and I can\u2019t recall that the whole group ever\nmet in one apartment. Would be disastrous. So sometimes then, communication between us\ncould be difficult, because of that. And that could -- could easily be some misunderstandings. So\nwhen we had one operation, we -- the first time the man that should help us, he had -- he had\noverslept. So he didn\u2019t show up, and we couldn't go because he had the fuse. Next time, he\nforgot the fuse, so we -- I was very angry with him, I\u2019ve never been so angry in my life, I think.\nSo, things like that could happen [indecipherable]. But was -- then made it more -- more simple,\nmore so the nerves could help out with -- they would have -- some had difficulties with their\nnerves, of course, but I had the -- we had about 15 operations in \u201944, and then one of the fellows,\nhe said, well, he s -- what will happen here? Can we come into trouble and get shot, or\nsomething. Then one other fellow said, no, 24 is with us. I had had so much luck, every time, and\nth-they were all -- we had no -- no -- then, 15 successful operations. So in a way, it was\ndangerous to think that way, but I had the luck.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s interesting. Telephones.",
        "A: Telephones were not tapped in Oslo. I think the reason why they couldn\u2019t tap all telephones,\nthey had the -- the -- Germans had the technicians, they had it, but they were dependent on\nNorwegian, on Norwegian technicians, all over you know. They call all -- these telephone boxes\nwere different places. I don\u2019t think they found any technician that was a Nazi. So they didn\u2019t\nthink of it, and they had thought they should do it, but they never did. So you could use the\ntelephone, but of course you wouldn\u2019t say, now we are going to have sabotage. You didn\u2019t say\nthat, but you say, we have to fetch the milk, or we meet in a shop because I got any more bread,\nor maybe a little goat cheese. That\u2019s Norwegian usually. So, telephone was very much used.\nThen, that day, they were [indecipherable] then we met, and I had all the information, all the\nintelligence, because I had been round there. I -- I could be always in the open, I was there\n[indecipherable] it. So what important in any military operation 1s intelligence before, and -- and\nintelligence very often can be wrong. But I could go there and see with my own eyes that it -- it\nwas like that. So that was a ve-very important thing.",
        "A: But made out on the telephone, very often.",
        "A: Yes, how -- how would I know that I was wanted? I didn\u2019t know. For -- when they had the --\nwhen that fellow had given up my name, real name, I didn\u2019t know it. So I had, at that time, about\nseven different hiding places. I had -- in the town, so I could use several -- several around the\ntown. And then at one of these places I had a small house I had hired, or my friend, as a matter of\nfact, in -- small house in the gas station, you know, slow -- very near the -- the headquarters of\nthe police, and -- and then the -- I didn\u2019t know a thing, I came in from -- I\u2019d been in the woods, I\nthink had the little weekend, which I had in the middle of the week. So I came in, it was dark,\nand then when I came to the house, I thought -- everything had to be blinded at that time, every\nhouse, everything that no light should come out because of air raids, so on. So -- but I thought it\nwasn\u2019t well done in a way. I felt something must be wrong. So I didn\u2019t put the key in the door,\nthen I would just be shot, because there was some people waiting for me. And I r-read about this\nafterwards, because Fehmer, the Gestapo chief, he wrote the report about this. And he was very,\nvery angry with the people sitting there, because I dis -- I just -- they didn\u2019t catch me. I -- I rang\nthe bell. Then I would -- knew I would have a split second to think what to do. And the -- the\ndoor was thrown open -- open immediately and I -- there was a -- I got a pistol right in my face.\nAnd the -- h-he asked me to come in, and I said, to hell I don\u2019t want to come in here. And I saw\ntwo Germans, in -- gendarmes wer -- they were, and with gun -- with rifles, and then he -- I tried\nto get my pistol, but then he -- that pistol was right in my face. So I just -- when he yell at me to\ncome in, I said to hell I want to, and I hit the pistol, and the -- he -- the shot went in the air and\nthen the -- I jumped out in the dark, and the two Germans shot, they all missed. So then the -- I\nknew it was people there, that -- I knew it was people that didn\u2019t like me. So then I went to the\nsecond, it was only a hundred yards away, my second place. Then started shooting there, then I\ngot away there, and then the -- my es -- taxi driver who drove me at that time, he said -- he said,\n\u201cT-I don\u2019t think you should go to any of these places.\u201d I said, \u201cI have to see at least one more,\nthen I know they are sitting everywhere, but I have to.\u201d And when I came down to that flat, they\nhad put a safety chain inside, so I was warned. So I got away there. But then he -- my -- my taxi\ndriver ans -- he said, no, no, no, please no more. So I then found an -- a new -- brand new place,\nand had a good night\u2019s sleep, no trouble. So -- but that -- that night, many, many people are\narrested, because it was [indecipherable] all over.",
        "A: Well, I had to know, are they sitting everywhere? What about the rest of them?",
        "A: I had to. I tho -- I had thought so, I had to be safe, that they were sitting there. Then I was\npretty sure they were. And this guards, they were -- got into very big trouble in front of the\nGestapo chief. They really got hell, because they had the --",
        "A: Yeah. And h-he said in his report, the worst thing isn\u2019t that they missed him, but they didn\u2019t\nreport to me, so I lost -- I lost the whole thing. If they had reported immediately, we could have\ngone to some other places and got him, but they didn\u2019t dare to tell me that they had lost.",
        "A: So it was a good thing [indecipherable] frightened by the Gestapo chief, and they got hell.",
        "A: Yeah, I knew -- I knew about the merchant -- haberdasher, by the way, and I knew he was\ngood -- or a good man, so I went up to his place, and I said I wanted to -- I was welcomed\nimmediately. So you would all -- in a country like ours, we know all -- most people, anti-Nazis,\nyou would be supported. But it was also a chance that they could have been all of -- arrested\nbefore that. You could go right into the place. But you had the -- you needed luck.",
        "A: Oh yes, I -- I lost that in that little house, and -- but I s -- I knew I had put na -- two names on\nthat notebook, so I put on some other clothes and after half an hour I went back there. I knew\nthey wouldn\u2019t start over again, lost -- they lost track of me. So I Just went right in -- almost\noutside and found it. Two days later, they -- it -- you had to try to think rationally, to say, why --\nwhy should I keep staying there? I had disappeared, why should I -- well, then you could be safe.",
        "A: Yes, but that would be done in that minute. But I disappeared in the darkness, it was\nimpossible.",
        "A: Well, I was -- I was angry.",
        "A: Yes. I -- of course, yes [indecipherable] stupid people. They started up this. And I had no\nrespect for that fellow that came up there, I -- and we\u2019re -- I -- I saw he was nervous, could see it\nimmediately, he\u2019s standing with a pistol like that, you know. Very few people are quiet in that\nmoment, I\u2019m pretty sure.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, a-and it was within my reach.",
        "A: That\u2019s not a good thing to do when you\u2019re try to hold up a man.",
        "A: No, no, the stair --",
        "A: -- it was a small house.",
        "A: The stairs, right into the open.",
        "A: So I was standing in front there, it was a little opened, just a little wa -- jump down three\nstairs.",
        "A: Well, I wasn\u2019t sure. I had a feeling, and you couldn\u2019t stop there, you had to --",
        "A: You had to know. I could have been wrong, I could have been -- I was right.",
        "A: No [indecipherable]",
        "A: But he knew -- he knew more or less that I knew most people in the -- the leaders.",
        "A: He knew that.",
        "A: But he called -- he called me a -- he thought I was a spy, no, and -- an English spy or -- or\nfrom the government that had left Norway, which was bad enough for him. So -- but when he\nlost track, he -- he -- then he had my father, he thought that was good enough to stop me. But I\ndon\u2019t know if he -- but I -- he didn\u2019t have any [indecipherable] about me really, until we met\nafter the war.",
        "A: Yeah, and the thing was that he was sent to a concentration camp in Oslo --",
        "A: -- outside Oslo. So I knew when the car -- they were put to some work in Oslo. So I knew he\nwas coming with that car, but with German guards, of course. I had to be way out of sight of it.\nSo I knew that. And my -- I had to try to convince my mother that I was in England. So I\ncorresponded with her through Stockholm. So she got letters from a relative in Stockholm,\nsaying that she used another name -- name for a girl. And she -- I wrote her, she knew it was\nfrom me, from England. I was in Oslo, but I pretended so she -- I tried to make her believe that I\nwas in England. But at one time she came to the bakery. I almost met her in the stairs, but she\nwas sitting in this next room in the bakery [indecipherable] face, all the time. Sh -- I was in the\nnext room. But that was just what could happen.",
        "A: Exactly, exactly, and get mixed into it. But first of all, they were afraid, you know, what will\nhappen. So that was an idea to keep that way.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, they had the -- the first night she was in the -- when I worked these different places,\nthey were there -- she stayed at one of these places, and the Gestapo came there during the night,\nand so he met my mother. He knew it was my mother, so --",
        "A: Yeah, Fehmer himself.",
        "A: The Gestapo chief, he came himself to that place, and -- 1-1n the night. Early -- usually like\ncame three, four o\u2019clock in the morning so they could do that, p-people wouldn\u2019t wake up, and\nher -- the friend that she was with, she was taken to the -- the concentration camp for about two\nyears, but because Fehmer asked her did I ever come there, and she said no. And then he -- for\nthat lie, you will be -- come to prison, he said. But my wife was -- my -- my mother was left\nthere.",
        "A: Well, a --",
        "A: Yeah, he -- yeah. I guess so.",
        "A: That was Grin1.",
        "A: Grini, G-r-i-n-1, Grini.",
        "A: Concentration camp, a -- right outside Oslo.",
        "A: An informer.",
        "A: Yes. He was sent out, and was done in a very smart way by the security pol-police. They were\n-- the Germans were all afraid of all kinds of sicknesses, so they put people in showers, to have\nbath or showers, always. So they had a man, wa -- one of the prisoners were heading in a bath,\ntaking care of all that. They put in an informer who took care of all the prisoners. And of course\nprisoners would think [indecipherable] why don\u2019t you talk to my -- he\u2019s also a prisoner. So they\ngave him two, three, names. A friend of mine was given up, a-and he -- then he was -- came out\nfrom prison, pretended they were releasing him. So he came up to that [indecipherable] that he\nhad heard that from other prisoners, of course, because they believed in him. He was just one of\nthem. So they got a telephone, and he telephoned my friend, and he wanted to meet my friend,\nand we had to meet him, because it could be very valuable information from other prisoner\nfriends. So we had to take a chance. Of course, we didn\u2019t know exactly how it was, but it could\nhappen. So we met him in the evening, outside in Oslo, about eight o\u2019clock in the evening, very\ndark in winter. And he started to tell us greetings from two people, which were -- later, by the\nway, died in Germany, in concentration camps. One was a [indecipherable] manager in Shell\ncompany, and then -- but we -- we just didn\u2019t -- we had a feeling that he was not in the resistance\nmovement, we had a -- the way he said it, then we understood that -- we were pretty sure that he\nwas an informer. So Fehmer, the Gestapo chief, he was reporting this afterwards, we have it in\nhis report. And he -- he said that the -- the man was stupid, and my -- my man, he was stupid\nenough to give up his telephone number. And that cost him his life. So we won at that time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: What a",
        "A: Yeah, he was shot.",
        "A: Part of the group. Some other --",
        "A: No, at night. They went into his bi -- apartment at night, because they had -- had his telephone\nnumber, they could find his address. Otherwise he had -- could have told -- he didn\u2019t get any\nnames from us, but he was very, very dangerous.",
        "A: Well, if he hadn\u2019t been taken that evening, it had been too late, next morning it would -- he\nwould report to Fehmer and he would say maybe and maybe could come with some tracks, you\nknow.",
        "A: Oh well, that was a --",
        "A: -- oh, it had to be one of the -- they were disciplined, they had -- they knew what it cost. So\none of the group would get that order.",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "A: -- yes, it could be.",
        "A: Of course, if you had said, but th -- I knew. This was part of the game.",
        "A: That was our enemies. When you are in -- at the front, you see the enemy over there, but here\nis -- you don\u2019t see him, you just feel him, you -- it\u2019s much more difficult. So it\u2019s just a -- as --\nGerman soldiers fire at American soldiers, just that.",
        "A: Well, I think for Norwegians it was. And after the war, when I have been sitting in a -- ina\nofficial bureau, taking care of all the disabled veterans, and when we discussed this, if a man had\n-- had a very bad destiny, and needed a pension, for instance, a disabled person pension, then this\nwould mean something, because of his nerves, that he had been through that. It was mentioned as\na very hard thing to do. On the front it\u2019s maybe a little different, but -- but you were also face to\nface in the front in a war, so --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It is.",
        "A: It is.",
        "A: So, it was considered a very tough thing [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, for --",
        "A: No, I hadn\u2019t -- I hadn\u2019t time.",
        "A: I had no time. I had to do my ossage -- office job for them in Oslo. But then when it was\nduring the dark hours and days, it was easier, but then I was warned by the -- our secret -- we\nhave also secret police agents, few of them, they ha -- they were a group, and they warned me,\nand they said, you better get out this summer. They are after you all the time, so please get out of\nNorway for the summer. Then I went over to Stockholm, and I was asked inter -- invited to come\nover to this special operations executive training camps, trained in that company, so we --",
        "A: -- yeah, and we then reached the independent company, number one, that was the name. Also\nunder Norwegian control.",
        "A: Yes, and I -- I could -- they -- they said to me, don\u2019t use your name over here, it could be\nGerman spies. So that -- they asked me to put ano -- another name, the Erling Fjeld name. So I\ncame over as Erling Fjeld, it was only two people in the British secret service that knew it --\nsecurity force, that knew who I was, and I -- so I had to pretend to be Erling Fjeld for six m --\nfour months. Born in \u201916.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: First March 16.",
        "A: That was the -- the date, I remember it very well. That wasn\u2019t my real birthdate.",
        "A: I was born in Oslo.",
        "A: And my father, he had a -- a small shop.",
        "A: And I think his -- his wife -- and my mother was Margda, I thought that was a nice name, so I\nbuilt up the whole thing there. So I had to go back to swe -- to Norway, and then when I came to\nthe border, Swedish border, I came there as a refugee called Erling Fjeld. And then I was given\nthe papers in Stockholm, and then I was wanted also in Sweden. So that\u2019s why I, in one of them,\nthat Erling Fjeld picture, I put in -- on the scarf, and a couple of window glasses, and -- just to be\nsafe, and I went through that control in Sweden without being discovered.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, that you could use your ordinary life.",
        "A: Take -- pick another town.",
        "A: For instance, you could pick a town on the west coast, which was also industrial town, could\nhave been just the same. So you had to pick things that\u2019s real so you -- you didn\u2019t need to -- to\nmake it up. You tried to find things tha -- that was there. So you couldn\u2019t always -- that was the\nway to remember.",
        "A: Yeah, and we had a training camp with only Norwegians.",
        "A: Yeah, on that -- that camp. The others were all people coming from all Europe, from occupied\ncountries, but here we were together, and about 30 men for two months, very hard, tough\ntraining, day and night. And we had learned all kinds of sabotage.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah --",
        "A: -- by then.",
        "A: I had difficulties over there because I hadn\u2019t the right discipline to be in the --",
        "A: -- [had a little trouble there. Well, I -- they didn\u2019t know that I had been in the resistance\nmovement for two, three years as one of the leaders. They didn\u2019t know that, they thought I was a\nyoung fellow coming. Erling Fjeld, they never heard about him, so they tried to make him be a\nlittle more disciplined. But I had difficulties. I -- but a -- first of all, so I didn\u2019t do very well in\nthe s -- that school, but I had the best marks in sabotage. I knew that was what I needed. The rest\nof them, I could actually teach them. So that\u2019s why, between the leader and me it was a little\ntrouble.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: The rest I knew.",
        "A: I knew they couldn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t learn me anything. He didn\u2019t know. And he didn\u2019t know I\nhad been in resistance for two and a half year.",
        "A: Yes, he said I wouldn\u2019t -- I -- I couldn\u2019t be used. But when I came to London, I knew, of\ncourse, So -- so it\u2019s not often that it -- it -- 1t -- use -- useful man can be a good -- good pupil.",
        "A: Yes, I had a very good friend from my hometown. He was later on the wireless operator on\nthe Kon-Tiki fleet, the raft.",
        "A: He was wireless operator together with [indecipherable] later on, because he needed some\nrelaxation after the war, because he had so much headache. So he joined [indecipherable] on the\nKon-Tiki. He lost all his troubles with -- after that trip with the raft, Kon-Tiki. So Knut and I, we\nwere close friends from Rjukan, and then he knew me, of course, he knew my name and\neverything. So he helped the leadership in England to get me over, because to send people back,\nit cost lots of money, you know, it -- it -- you had to send what they pretend to be the best. So --\nbut the leadership in London, they -- they knew, so they wanted me to go back.",
        "A: No, it was -- you had to really -- you know, they put up a plane, it was terribly expensive, was\na big thing, you know, a four engine bomber, Halifax bomber, or could be an [indecipherable]\nAmerican, and sent back to Norway. So they had to try to find the best to send, or the ones they\nknew could do something.",
        "A: Yes, back --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: With all kinds of weapons.",
        "A: And I had Knut, we came together.",
        "A: Knut Haugland, and we had in our planes, we had a -- almost two tons of weapons with us, in\nsmall parachutes that was dropped together with us, two tons of weapons.",
        "A: That was the very -- in the middle of Norway, called -- a very neat place called Kongsberg.\nAnd then I dropped right there in the mountains.",
        "A: Yes, we did that, we had some of the farmers came with sledges, you know, in winter and\npicked them up by horses, sledges. And they had them down to -- to the road, the main road,\nwhere we could pick them up. For instance, in my way I -- I had the very close friend in the -- in\nthe gas company, and we had their truck, their tank truck, and we filled -- put all the weapons in\nthat truck -- tank wagon, and people -- when we came running, came on the road, they didn\u2019t\nbelieve it could be weapons on the tank, you know, in the tank. Thought it was gasoline, so now\nwe could be fooling the Germans, not the opposite. So some fun -- sometimes we\u2019re -- we\u2019re the\ncat, and then they\u2019re mices.",
        "A: Yes, I go -- went immediately back, and I did nothing in the first two weeks. I want to get to\nknow a -- all -- to be -- find out what had happened, so --",
        "A: Yeah, then I had been --",
        "A: No, I had been away for -- for five months, you know.",
        "A: Yeah. So now I was back where I could -- I really liked to be.",
        "A: Yeah, I stayed two -- two weeks before, so I get used to the climate. A clam -- a clam -- a\n[indecipherable]. So I knew then I could start again. Met my people, what\u2019s the situation now,\nwhere are the controls, how can you -- where can you stay, where -- what can you do? I was -- so\nI was just relaxing there for 14 days, then I could start over again.",
        "A: You know, then I stayed with a -- a doctor at one of the hospitals, big hospitals. And then I --\nI was to find a place for my friend, Knut Haugland as a wireless operator. So he\u2019s put -- came to\nthat same hospital, a -- he took over my place, and he was in -- sending all his messages on the\ntop floor of the hospital. And then I found some other places, new places, another five, 10 new\nplaces where I can disappear completely, and -- under some name, some new name, could be\nKnutsen too. That\u2019s why one day we were very, very -- little stupid, because we had both put the\nname Knutsen. So when I met my friend, he said to me, \u201cWho are you?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m Knutsen.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m Knutsen.\u201d I said. So then it was Knutsen one and Knutsen two. But in -- in two months\nwe had different names again.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s -- yeah, yeah, I would say so, it was the first where I was -- had that chance, and that\nwas in open daylight. You had --where they had conscripted the [indecipherable] meeting the\nnext day, next morning, about nine o\u2019clock and they wanted us to blow up the place --",
        "A: -- in the evening.",
        "A: See, they were trying to deal with a lot of Norwegians, several thousands, could be quite a\npercentage for all the youngsters. And they wanted them to be conscripted for labor. But it was a\nconcealed conscription for army, for German army. And the long week -- it was very hard to stop\nit, it was, of course that was sent over the radio, BBC radio, Norwegian broadcast to Norway,\nplease don\u2019t go in there, don\u2019t -- don\u2019t report. But if they didn\u2019t report, they -- all the youth, 18 --\nbetween 18 and 22, they would be fetched -- they would be taken by the police, would -- could\nbe shot or put in a concentration camp. So it didn\u2019t help them to refuse. But in Oslo they were\nsupposed to meet 3,000 in \u00b044, spring 44, 19\" May, they were supposed to meet. 18\", the day\nbefore, I was asked -- it was my first job, I was asked to -- they ene -- in the evening, same\nevening, blow up the office, and it was in -- in Norway it\u2019s very light in May, it\u2019s -- almost all\nnight. So about eight o\u2019clock in the evening we went up there, and had a -- some explosives, 14\npounds of explosives. And then we just -- in a small parcel. And then th -- we thought it was very\neasy to do this, but it was about 20 people working overtime, because they should have 3,000\npeople next morning. So I said to my friend, I cannot kill these people, I don\u2019t -- we cannot do\nthat, that\u2019s not our job. Our job 1s to ruin it. So I shouted -- went up to -- in the house, and I\nshouted as high as I could, get the hell out of there. Two minutes the house will be -- the whole\nthing will be blown up. And they all got out in a split second, more or less. All of them. And\nwhen we came out, it was only less than one minute before it exploded, so -- then the next\nmorning, nobody could meet there. I had a feeling that the -- I\u2019d heard from some historians that\nthree people went instead of 3,000. And they had troubles because the stairs wasn\u2019t there any\nmore. So we were lucky. And this helped. Next day they knew three -- 3,000 should meet, but\nthey had no place to meet. So that was start, we made several sabotage operations s-so we could\nhelp this, and it was stopped, finally. After six months, they gave up. So we -- we sent a ti -- sent\nin 5,000 youngsters [indecipherable] means quite a lot to people [indecipherable] three million.\nQuite a big percentage.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No -- yeah, that was always done. But no -- Oslo was so terribly important, because\neverything was centerized. The politicians today say -- they complain that we are centerized\ntoday, but at that time it was all centerized. Every town in Norway, if they needed even change\ntheir house, you had to go right to the -- to the headquarters in Oslo. So it meant so much. So this\nwas mostly done in Oslo.",
        "A: So it meant very much for the whole country. You could use a telephone all over the country.\nSo it spread.",
        "A: That somebody was now hitting the Gestapo.",
        "A: And they were disappearing, hitting, ruining for them, and disappeared, all the time. So of\ncourse it was -- was not very nice for the Gestapo, really. They got into trouble.\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: We were, at that time, three million people. And we had in from \u201942 - \u201943, we had about\n250,000, later on more than 300,000 troops. It was 10 percent of all the population. And if you\ntake the age of -- the military age, which was an important 17 - 18 to 32 - 34, then it was -- in\nsouthern Norway it was about three Germans to a Norwegian. And in north Norway, very little --\nit was not so many people, we had -- it could be about 10 Germans to a Norwegian in that age\ngroup. So [indecipherable] swarmed in [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, all the time. But I didn\u2019t care, I thought that they didn\u2019t touch me, and I didn\u2019t touch\nthem. So, just like that, especially you were always -- all the controls, you know, and when you\nconsider Norwegians, they were being traitors, they had the -- some of them had the control.\nThey were one man with a machine pistol, and it was five others, youngsters, Nazi boys with\nrifles. And then you were stopped, they looked in your pockets and in your -- your vest -- what\ndo you call these small things you have? Suitcases, and briefcases and looked through them,\nopened. And if you saw them, and you tried to get away, and you didn\u2019t stop, you would be shot.\nThey shot immediately these youngsters, young Norwegians. That was very bad to see, you\nknow. And they were Nazis and they didn't understand what they did. So it could even be on the\n[indecipherable] gosh that man -- if you then just moved another, they would stop you. And if\nyou didn\u2019t stop immediately, got shot.",
        "A: Well, they used some kind of a -- 1n order to call in people, they had to use what you call -- I\nwon\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know what you call it in English, but all the insurance companies had -- is a kind\nof starting up of data system. They could sort out things on new machines from the States. And it\nwas, of course, the company that had this, that was IBM. At that time in Norway, it had another\nname, the company, and they had these machines. And these machines were now put in to sort\nout people to find the addresses. They were sorted like anything 1s. It was a first kind of data --\ndata machine, I think, data. And then the Germans and the Norwegian -- the Nazi government,\nthey wanted to use this. I got the order to take it, to destroy it before they could start. So the first\n-- the machines, they were -- they were in a nice shop in Oslo, and one morning we heard that it -\n- they will be taken over by the Gestapo. So the day before, we came there, and we had a big\nstone through the window, and had three small charges of -- of explosives, and there were no\nmore after a minute. Then we disappeared completely. The next day they -- we had forgotten a\nbig machine up in the insurance company. And then we had got the new order to go up there and\ntake that. And then they had put four guards around the machine with a police dog. Now they\nwere sure it will not be taken, and the Gestapo and the -- they were hundred percent sure nobody\ncould come there. So it was impossible, but we found a new way. If it had been now we would\nhave maybe used a helicopter, but you didn\u2019t have helicopter at that time, so we had to crawl\nover three, four roofs, until we reached that building and got down there, and the -- there we\nknew it was -- the machine was under the -- the dining room, or the room where the fella -- the\nemployees had their meal. And during the night we came, we reached it, and put the explosive,\nthat would 10 -- it was a delayed bomb, 10 minutes, and then we went back, we -- if you then\nwent into the streets about 10:30, you would be taken, it was German guard all over town during\nthe night. Also because of these sabotage operations. If we came into the street, we would be\narrested immediately, our age. So we wen-went into the next building and had a fine view to\nwhere the explosion will go off and 10 minutes afterwards, again we -- we didn\u2019t want to take\nlives, so we called them again on the telephone, we said, two minutes, you\u2019d better get out. And\nthey knew from experience now, so they all got out, even with the dog, and then it was blown up,\nthe whole thing. And next morning they couldn\u2019t find anybody, no track whatsoever, which was\na very important thing. We didn\u2019t lose people, I didn\u2019t lose any of my men, and it was a -- should\ncalled a success.",
        "A: I think it was not so easy to bear. Not to find a track, 1t was impossible. And of course it\nmeant that the people also, they didn\u2019t talk. They knew they had -- shouldn\u2019t talk about it. Of\ncourse it was wonderful for them to hear about it, and when I came the next day, I went down in\nthe district and talked to people and they said, oh, terrible people that\u2019s done this. So -- but it was\nvery popular, of course, within the population because they knew it was a fight towards the\nGestapo first of all, and to stop this conscription of our young persons. So in -- in the course of\n\"44 summer, autumn, it was all stopped. They gave up. And another thing, politically, Germans\nsometimes found that these Norwegian Nazis weren't always so good. So they were -- they were\nnow annoyed that they didn\u2019t make it and put [indecipherable] Gestapo in trouble. So they were -\n- it could be a little -- for us it was very important that it was a g -- not good relations between\nthe Germans and the Nazi Norwegians. That could also be a point.",
        "A: Yes, every Norwegian over 16 years old had to have a ration card. And then these youngsters,\nthey were all -- they were all refused to fetch the cards. And then we -- I was asked to steal a\nfew, to real -- make it a hold-up.",
        "A: Yes --",
        "A: They refused to give the cards to -- to the youngsters of 18 - 19 - 20 - 22.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Then they would have to report. If they didn\u2019t get a card, they had to report, that was the\nway.\\",
        "A: And then I was asked to -- to put up a hold up, to take over 75,000 ration -- ration cards, and\nthat was one and a half ton. So it was not a pocket theft, 1t was a real [indecipherable]. So we -- it\nwas coming out from the printing shop with guards, the whole truck, and we stopped it. In\nNorway y-you have a han -- it\u2019s right driving you know, we have left and right, Norway was\nright. And then you can stop the car. My car came and stopped the other one, because it had\nstopped because of the right of way. So then we -- I took over the car. I just opened the front\ndoor of the truck and said, let me have a place here, I don\u2019t want to sit here in front. So I put my\ngun in the side of the watchman, of the guard, and he moved immediately. And at the same time,\ntwo of my friends went up on the -- on the platform, on the truck, where it was two other guards,\nso the car was ours. We took it over, the whole thing, with the one and a half ton of ration cards.\nThat was -- then we met another car, which I didn\u2019t know the number plates, I didn\u2019t know\nanything, I knew exact at 9:30 we will meet another car, I stopped there, and 1 -- all ration card\ngot taken over to the other truck, and that disappeared. If we were now arrested or taken, we\ndidn\u2019t know where to find the cards. They could have tortured us, but we didn\u2019t know. That was\nalso important at that time. So --",
        "A: Then the -- some of our leaders, they had a telephone to the authorities, one way line. And\nthe-they told the authorities, now we have -- we have the cards, we want to make a deal with\nyou. And they say, what\u2019s your -- what\u2019s your address? Well, we haven\u2019t got any address.\nWhat\u2019s your telephone? We haven\u2019t got any telephone. But we want you to give a new order that\nthe youngsters should have the cards -- have their ration cards. And th -- how -- why did they\ngive in? Yes, they gave in because at this time, Germans were building up that most important\nfort in Europe. That\u2019s the strongest fort in Norway -- Norway from this time on. So if it had been\nan invasion, had been terrible to take back Norway. Would have cost millions, maybe. And then\nwe said, we are going to send these cards all over, sell them to make the black market way and it\nwill ruin your situation, the whole station here. What about people working on your fortress, and\nall that? They would have no -- no food, nothing. It would be terrible. It would ruin the whole\nsituation here. And then the Nazi government, Norwegian, they had to give in, because the\nGermans would be furious if their laborers, all those, didn\u2019t get any food at all, it will stop all\nwork. So they gave in. We had won. That was in September \u201944. They tried once more to\nconscript the lady -- the women, but that didn\u2019t work at all. So we didn't hear any more. And our\noffice, without address, without telephones, just disappeared from the Nazis.",
        "A: Yes. Of course, this was done by another group, but I worked closely with them. I didn\u2019t do\nthat part of it, but my part was to get hold of the cards.",
        "A: Oh yes, that -- you are quite right, but the way we did it, well we just gave them first 20,000\ncards and then they -- we said, you can pick them up outside the bank, for instance.",
        "A: And then part of it we put in small parcels, and on top of them we wrote, dangerous\nexplosives. And it was put round in Oslo and it was a hell of a trouble for the police, the Nazi\npolice, and they didn\u2019t dare to touch them. So they sent for a company outside, an -- German\nspecialists to -- on the -- to take over, and then they opened it very carefully, and it was ration --\nration cards. So we had a little fun also. But of course we were -- man -- many people into this,\nand -- but it was all coordinated very well from the top.",
        "A: Yes, that was an important place, 1t was very hard to find because the German camouflaged it\nwith a very big [indecipherable] very big, you know, the biggest in Norway. And half of it was\nput into stock of all kinds of spec-special re-repair parts for -- for fighter planes, Messerschmitt.\nAnd they had also a-about -- about 20 fuselage that was there, to put -- put up to the airport later\non, and we got to know it, and it was very hard to know where it was and what they did, but we\nhad to get intelligence, and one of my friends, he got to know all of it. So then we went in there,\nand the part -- the Norwegian part was no guarded, strangely enough. Was one guard, which I by\nthe way took -- had -- took hold of when we came there in the night and pacified him. And then\nwe went in there and then went into the German part in the basement, through three fences, and\nput down about 300 pounds of dynamite. We blew up the whole place. And I think it wasn\u2019t very\nnice for them to use their spare parts in Norway. And the same had to be done with ball bearing.\nBall bearing was terribly important for any nation. And Swedish -- Sweden had the best ball\nbearings in the world, you know, they had also a small place in Oslo, which was also blown up.\nAnother thing what -- how -- how would we know what to -- what take, of course, when we talk\nabout submarines. Submarines use batteries. Submarines batteries, that means sulfur, the acid.\nAnd we had two of them in Norway, so the way we could hit the submarine weapon to stop the\nsubmarines was to ruin these two acid factories, and they were stopped. So they couldn\u2019t produce\nany more, they were ruined for the rest of the war, and then it was not -- very few batteries\ncoming from Norway to -- norw -- to submarines, because at the coastline in Norway, during the\nwar you could hide every nation\u2019s fleet, submarines and everything, in Norwegian fjords. You\ncould have the whole -- the world could be placed into Norwegian fjords. And they did, of\ncourse, all those submarines, they disappeared in Norwegian fjords. So they were -- it was very\nimportant to hit them in a way of taking away sulfur, as in for batteries. Then you had to have\nexperts to help you [indecipherable]. But when we talked about Haugland, he was also wireless\noperator on the heavy water operation, and on my hometown. And so he had a [indecipherable]\nexperience. Two s-s-small town -- two small town boys were also there.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Just to hold him up, and just keep watching him, or one man had to watch him all the time.\nBut the trouble with that, of course, if he doesn\u2019t start screaming. And people maybe done that,\nwithout helping it.",
        "A: So that could be a -- then, when you hear about guards being -- you can shoot him, because of\nthe noise. So when you hear about that, it\u2019s a -- a necessity, because they can give a noise,\nscream or something like that, but he -- luckily he didn\u2019t. So he was a -- sent out --",
        "A: Afterwards. So we tried to be very careful with the civilian at all. It was not our -- we were no\nterrorists. The Germans called us, of course, terrorists, but I -- I -- I don\u2019t know any type or\n[indecipherable] which was terrorism.",
        "A: Yes, that was another difficult thing, of course, when you come into a place like that, if you\nhad -- if you had the cleaning womens and I had pacify them in a way that -- I said that we were\nnow -- you know, on all buses, you have different advertising, and I said I was a painter, so I\nshould paint some of the buses with the -- and they believed me. I -- I looked very innocent, and\nthey said, he\u2019s a nice painter. So then I -- then I -- when I saw all the explosives being carried in,\nI said, this is meat. So this is -- go to your -- your people in the -- with all the buses\n[indecipherable] it will be fine. So they believed me, but when they talked, and -- but then I had\nto tell them, I\u2019m very sorry, but it -- now it will be blown up, you come with us. So -- but they\ncould stop the whole operation, you know, if they had started. So that was not a way to be\ninnocent, try to make people believe.",
        "A: Oh no, they were frightened.",
        "A: Like hell, of course, which is understandable, under -- but they got out. They couldn't --\nnobody hurt them afterwards.",
        "A: They couldn\u2019t do anything. But people, when they see and hear about explosions, you know,\nfuses burning, it\u2019s very understandable that they are frightened.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a good thing, I think.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I was then in Oslo, and they were trained in -- specially on that target in England, by some\nNorwegian professors that had really installed the heavy water plant at Rjukan. It\u2019s part of the\nelectr -- electrolyses. That\u2019s part of it, you get the heavy water from the --",
        "A: No, no, he just -- he -- he was -- the operat -- operator [indecipherable] to keep the\n[indecipherable] London advised all the time, do they go in now?",
        "A: And then he had to keep away so he could, if they had been lost, he had the report, so he was\nkeeping 1n touch with the -- England all the time, during operation.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Or also detachment, I said the name then, but --",
        "A: Yeah, in Norway it\u2019s a gang, see, which 1s -- can be --",
        "A: -- misunderstood, I think.",
        "A: Yeah, that --",
        "A: -- was the British name for it.",
        "A: Yeah, that was, of course, also necessary because -- especially the special oils for -- could be\nlubricating oils, which was very important, very scarce. You know, the Germans, they really, in\nthe last part, they had no lubricating oil, they had no gasoline, it was just -- some part of their\nPanzer, you know, couldn\u2019t work because they hadn\u2019t any more -- so that, it was very scarce. So\nto ruin any gasoline tanks, or lubricating, was very important, that was part of how you could hit\nthe Germans. But as I said before, the real effort in Norway\u2019s war was the sailors and the -- or\nthat was the real thing, but so -- but everything you could do against the occupying powers in\nNorway would, of course help -- help out.",
        "A: Well, it could be, but it was more from the small groups, they did many, all over Norway.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Not -- not on that day, but [indecipherable] occasionally.",
        "A: That was done by several groups. So I -- I don\u2019t know how much it would be, enormous. It\nwas ruined, especially all the stocks in Norway.",
        "A: Ah -- yeah, I wanted to report now in England, in London. So I -- then I went over with a n --\nthird name. My name was this time Harald Sorensen. When I came to England I had good\npapers, when I came to the security police -- in England you can think in a wartime, security\npolice, and I got in now a-at the thi -- in the third, after third name, Harald Sorensen, electrical\nengineer. So then it was a very few people that, of course -- in there, so we [indecipherable] that\nI was let in. Could be a dangerous [indecipherable], I guess.",
        "A: Yeah, that means -- no, I didn\u2019t, I -- I went up there because my course that had been before,\nso I just reported over there, to -- to try what happened, what about the experience did I have,\nwith the things I had learned in Great Britain. So that was a special course in sabotage.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Because --",
        "A: The sa -- the king heard about this country, and of course he had not been in Norway for four\nwinters now. And when he heard that I was there for the -- number 24, he knew. And then he\nasked me to come up to there to see him. Of course, it was very nice to meet them. And then the\nking said to me, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name today, Erling Fjyeld?\u201d They laughed a little, you see, and\nthen I said, \u201cNow today, your majesty, my name is Harald Sorensen, electrical engineer.\u201d And he\n-- | -- if I had invite him to go back to the resistance in Norway, he may have followed. But he\nwas a tall man, so it would be really strange if you had seen the Norwegian king up and down the\nmain street in Oslo.",
        "A: But he -- he had really en-enjoy this, of course. But on the other hand, if -- when we talk\nabout Oslo and all, he was nearly crying. It was very serious to him, but he couldn\u2019t go back, and\nthen -- but then after six months, in June \u201945, he could go back.",
        "A: Oh, very, very special, of course. So I then didn\u2019t realize it, I think, because all things were\nquite serious, so -- but it -- it was -- 1t was nice.",
        "A: Not at that day.",
        "A: The other day. I met him with the others. Then he was commander in chief for all forces --",
        "A: -- Norwegian forces.",
        "A: From that time.",
        "A: Yes, with two new men, two new --",
        "A: -- members from the Oslo detachment.",
        "A: Oh, it -- it was harder, and the Gestapo was very hard, it was -- it was terribly hard, terribly\ntough. Many, many people are shot, many people are put in concentration camps and now we\nheard more than rumors what happened to them in Germany, but not exactly what happened. We\nknew it was tough, but even in December we didn\u2019t realize. It wasn\u2019t realized before the\nAmericans came to the first camps. So we -- we couldn\u2019t believe it, and in, of course, summer, it\nwas not easy because they knew I was one of their leaders, and I very often got telephones, have\nyou heard from my s-son, have you -- have you -- my father, and -- and the -- it was about\n10,000, you know, that\u2019s -- for a nation of three millions, it\u2019s quite a lot. But it couldn\u2019t -- some\npeople -- some countries in Norway -- in Europe was worse, you know.",
        "A: Yes, because the Germans really had a counterattack in the Ardennes [indecipherable] that\noften [indecipherable] it was called on, it was really tough, because it cost the allied -- I think\none place you lost 75,000 Americans in that [indecipherable]. And lots of people, and then this\nwill be reinforced by troops. We had -- Hitler had fresh troops in Norway. And he -- they had\nsome of the troops that had left Finland -- you know, Finland turned around and kicked the\nGerman out, you know. They came over to Norway, all of them, so it was some of the best\narmies in Germany, still, and now they shipped them down to Oslo, and shipped them over to --\nsoon as possible to Germany, to reinforce this offensive -- the [indecipherable] that offensive.\nBut then the order came out that try to ruin -- stop the railways, north - south going railways, try\nto sabotage it, try to derail trains and all that. And then the [indecipherable] all the repair thing\nwas done by -- by as -- the central office in Oslo. To repair the railroads, there were all the\npeople there, so then I was asked to blow up the whole administration building. So it would ruin\ntheir effort to repair and build it up again. And that was done, blown up, completely destroyed,\nall of it. And then the [indecipherable] the gar -- it was guarded usually very well, it was about\nsix, 10 guards there. One man was sitting behind a glass door, but we got -- we got hold of him,\nand -- but he s -- started shouting, as I told you before, so I -- so we had to -- I was going to take\nhim out -- outwards, but he shouted, tried to -- to warn the rest of the guard, but he -- then you\nhad to -- of course, to shoot him, and the guards, you couldn\u2019t think of those guards. They had th\n-- but they were our enemies, all of them. We hadn\u2019t invited them to Norway. So they say that\nwe stopped about -- it was four divisions trying to be sent to Germany, and I think, I\u2019m not sure\nhistorically that we stopped about two and a half division coming to reinforcement in Germany.",
        "A: All the way.",
        "A: Yeah, all over, especially a train where railways were, so they derailed and all that.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s true --",
        "A: Yeah, and --",
        "A: And of course, the Germans, they came as a shock to the Germans because it was all done\neight o\u2019clock in the evening, 14\" March 45. And by the way, on my father\u2019s birthday. So I -- it\nwas a good gift, when he was in prison, it was a good gift to give.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: -- 1 -- I doubt it, at that time. He may have, a little later. Rumors were going all the time.",
        "A: SO --",
        "A: Yes, and then I was again, because a -- it -- German Gestapo and a Norwegian Nazis, that are\nburning all archives, started wi -- two, three days before the -- Norway was taken over, and then\n-- then we got the -- the order -- 1t was a order, we were under orders from the -- I got the order\nto try to -- try to st -- not to stop it, but to get hold of the archives, before they burnt them. We\nwere lucky, we went to the police department, and to the justice department. And we had some\nsecret agents there. They picked up the most important and we took it all out on a big truck, four\ndays before the -- Eisenhower said it\u2019s over. So it -- 1t meant quite a lot when we -- we had the\nnames, all the Gestapos, we had the names of the -- many of the traitors, otherwise, they had\nbeen burned. So they are still the archives.",
        "A: No, they are taken over by the National Archives. We have some very specially deep in the --\nin the cellars.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes --",
        "A: -- because our outfit, the Linge company, the special -- as I said, the -- the independent\ncompany, number one, and then the -- I talked to my friend in the -- that was head of the -- all the\nMilorg groups all over the country, 40,000. And I said to him, \u201cWhat shall I -- what am I now?\u201d\nYou know, in England, they had the record, they didn\u2019t know of Sonsteby. They didn\u2019t know any\nSonsteby had been in the company. They couldn\u2019t do anything to him, they couldn\u2019t give him a\nrank, you cannot give a false name the rank. So Erling Fjeld didn\u2019t get the rank. So --",
        "A: No, sor --",
        "A: That\u2019s right. So then the -- Haugland said okay [indecipherable] my friend, the leader. Said,\nwell I think you\u2019re -- you\u2019re a captain. And then the -- afterwards the military off -- authorities,\nthey had to find out what -- this Sonsteby has never been here in England, never been in this\ncompany. So -- but, of course that was -- the result was that I was given that rank, but it had to\ncome six months later, because they had to find my name, they had to do it all properly. So I kept\nthe title.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not -- not in uniforms --",
        "A: -- but they had all on [indecipherable] and when the Germans should give up, even in\nNorway, they said, we cannot surrender here, we cannot surrender our weapons. It\u2019s no allied\n[indecipherable] here, not one. Then they got the message from Eisenhower personally, directly.\nYou can rest assured, you will meet 40,000 young men, they have no uniforms, but they have an\n[indecipherable]. And then the German general said, what\u2019s -- why [indecipherable] like this, we\ncannot give away our weapons to this. Then Eisenhower sent a new message. They are all\ndisciplined, I can guarantee it, they have all weapons, they are very disciplined. And then\ngeneral, in the -- at the Lillehammer in Norway said okay, we -- then 300,000 Germans\nsurrendered to 40,000 [indecipherable] all their weapons, artillery, everything. So they had their -\n- it was necessary. They were -- as we say in Norway, they were en -- on ort en stellar, as they\nsay in German, they were in the right place at the right time.",
        "A: Well, of course --",
        "A: -- some of them went to the Milorg.",
        "A: So -- so they had some sort, but it was very few, so they did -- I must say they did a very good\njob at trying to hurt the armies when they were there. And -- but it was at this time, the whole\nleadership in the home front, I said, after four days, when the government delegation is here, you\ntake over. We withdraw. And they all withdrew. No trouble whatsoever in Norway, the\ngovernment came and took over all the --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They had never any trouble, no -- never any groups that didn\u2019t follow orders.",
        "A: Yeah, in -- in June, yeah, that\u2019s correct.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s a -- first the crown prince came back in 13 May in \u201945, because he came back with\nthe government delegation.",
        "A: Half the government, because that had to take over as soon as possible, we wanted that. And\nthen they -- it was 10,000 Germans in Oslo, and the crown prince come -- came in there, and I\nwas asked to -- was responsible for his life. So then I put the whole group, this detachment, or\ngang, they were his bodyguard, all of us.",
        "A: We were about 20 of bodyguard, all the way -- when the royal family came back, they had the\nsame. So we were about 20 people having that job.",
        "A: Yes, first of all, when the Crown Prince came, we had another friend called Max Manus,\nwhich I thought was a little quicker than me, because I could be maybe -- he -- he was like a --\nlike a good horse, he was -- so I thought that -- we were so afraid there were hand grenade\nlanding in the car, because the Germans were all around, so --",
        "A: Yes, yeah, and I had the discussion with him, but he -- just did -- didn\u2019t -- only wanted an\nopen car, but he sat on the top there, on the -- so he just didn\u2019t care, but the fellow I had -- th-the\nchauffeur and Max Manus [indecipherable] they were both there, and the boys around him, so\nwe knew we could stop it, hope so.",
        "A: Yeah. An-anyway, called himself prime minister.",
        "A: No, it was nothing.",
        "A: And the Germans, they -- some -- when -- I think some of them laughed.",
        "A: And -- but when you knew Hitler, you had to be careful to laugh about somebody. So they\nwere very -- for instance, Terboven, that [indecipherable] he was very careful, because that\u2019s --\nHitler like him. That had been the whole thing. If Hitler liked him, Terboven would be kicked\nout instead.",
        "A: So it was very important to be friend of Hitler, I think, at that time.",
        "A: Yes, when he was t-tried, he was sitting in one prison, and it was a little too far to the place\nwhere we should -- he should be tried, courthouse. So I fetched him. And in a way I -- he was\nalone. I-I thought, how terrible, poor man. In a way. But of course, we knew what he had done\nand all that, he had been terrible, all the things. So I had a Black Maria you called that, and I put\nhim in there, and -- and then I said to a friend of mine who had been in all the prison camps,\nthree of the worst, and he had survived, and I said to him, Mr. [indecipherable] you sit in with\nQuisling. Tell him what you have experienced. But he said afterwards, wasn\u2019t very -- very many\nwords talked between us, he said. So I thought it was a very good thing that now he was there.",
        "A: But it -- one thing, I have never seen any soldier, Norwegian resistance spitting or even show\nanything in front of the Germans, never. So, and of course Quisling was a little different, but\nnobody came near to him, of course. They couldn\u2019t --",
        "A: No, no, not at all. Of course, we were afraid. Some people are -- can be crazy, you know.",
        "A: But it was nothing, and we kept an eye all the time, so he should have a trial, a fair tria --\nwell, as fair as possible, which we think we gave him. They -- he had his lawyers. But you know,\nwhen a man is trying to overthrow your government, if you got in a situation like here, that you\nhad a man trying to overthrow the government here. You had to shoot him, you had to get rid of\nhim. And death penalty is the only thing. When a man is taking a whole country, being a traitor\nwith the whole country, then, at that time at least, it was no discussion at all.",
        "A: Pretty much.",
        "A: He was shot 24\" of October 45, after three, four months of trial.",
        "A: Oh yes, he tried all the time, he didn\u2019t understand.",
        "A: He pretended maybe. He pretended, I guess. H-He must have understood, but he was a\nstrange fellow.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, actually, not so much, but when I saw he was there, I just said hello to him. But I had\nno -- nothing to tell him.",
        "A: I -- Pve nothing to speak with -- I couldn\u2019t -- what shall I talk to him about? So -- so just a\nfew words, said to my o-old opponent. But he had been -- he -- he really organized the torture in\nOslo from the very beginning. And I knew he had, for instance, tortured women. He did it ina\nway that put them in a cold room, and then they were naked, and they were put in cold water,\nand they were just -- tried to put them under water, almost til they died more or less, that was the\nterror, real. So he had been a terrible fellow. All the people that I\u2019d been torturing, the -- all the\ntorturists, were shot in Norway. There was about -- people that -- they enjoyed it. These people\nhad the death penalty. But when be -- when the war was over, I turned around with the Germans,\nthe war was over, no more war. So I went to Germany already 1950, started discussing paper\nbuyings from our paper mill in Norway. So we had forgotten -- we had not forgotten, but we\nknew we had to change, and saw -- I saw Germany built up as a democracy again, through those\nyears. I was in Germany from 1950 to 1970, one, at least a month. Every month I was there. I\nsaw the whole democracy being built up, and I knew Willie Brandt, the chancellor, later. And I\nthink, luckily, it was -- succeeded, in my opinion, hundred percent.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s natural, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Yes. Well, it\u2019s rational, let\u2019s put it that way. You had to be rational, you have to be\n[indecipherable] no way -- no way. And they were enemies, and no more because they done their\nbest to become -- but we have people in Norway, they try -- why don\u2019t you take it into the\n[indecipherable] can say that? And then we said, okay, if you realize that you\u2019ve done a mistake,\nthat you did a mistake when you joined the -- the Nazi ideas, or the Nazis, Holocaust and all that.\nIf you don\u2019t say that, that you -- you -- you were wrong, we still -- you are still my enemy. I'll\nnever understand that. You have to regret it. When the -- you regret it, and you have your\npunishment, okay. But we have some people, they will never regret it, they still think they were\nright. And that\u2019s incredible, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what\u2019s strange, in my opinion. They have a few in\nNorway also, but we were very few in -- I think all in Europe, I think. Very few.",
        "A: Well, immediately, when -- it was like [indecipherable] the troops, right? It was really, really\nreal, you know. American troops, they just didn\u2019t believe it. Russian troops, French. And so the\nreal thing we -- we had, of course, in the last part it was a -- when -- what -- it took a long time til\nwe heard that -- what happened to the Norwegian Jews. [indecipherable] not before the war was\nover, really, that you had the -- the truth of it.",
        "A: No, it -- no way. [indecipherable] help at all, and I talked to my friend, very close friend that\u2019s\nhere with me, Jule Benkel, he was -- was -- as I said, in the resistance and later on he became a --\nth-the leader -- the speaker of the house, and we talk about it. I -- I feel that he is -- he lost all his\nfamily. It\u2019s hard for him -- it\u2019s hard for me to go to the Holocaust. But I --",
        "A: Yeah, here, and then everywhere. In Germany. And then my wife has taken young people\ndown to Auschwitz, I think it\u2019s many thousand schoolchildren, she has been with one of the\ngroups, and she said, they have changed when I have been there. They changed. It\u2019s really hard.\nSo when I first came into a remarkable [indecipherable] here, I -- I had to -- I couldn\u2019t take it, I\nhad to stop. I\u2019d been through it halfway, I say, well I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t feel that. The same\nwith [indecipherable]. And we have been [indecipherable] Norwegian authorities, our foreign\nministry, I think it\u2019s a good idea that we go out and inform people. Inform them in Norway,\ninform them everywhere where we have listeners. Yep.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so, what -- I think you have covered a little of the sto -- of the story\n[indecipherable] a little bit.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s very nice to listen to me. I like that.\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah, you see up on the left corner, that\u2019s some of my different names, aliases which I had\nduring the war. This 1s part of it. I think I had about 25 dif -- different. And this, in the middle\nthere, that\u2019s my real passport under Gunnar Sonsteby, which of course couldn\u2019t be used after \u201942,\nwhen I was wanted. That\u2019s the one, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And these others are at different times, from 1941 til \u00b044 - \u201945.",
        "A: Yes, I -- I -- and I just --",
        "A: It\u2019s a very strange, but every picture was -- I didn't try it, but I went to these small boxes, you\nknow, you find in the railroad station, where you look at -- as a criminal anyway, when you are\nphotographed. So that was the case. And you see in the sign there, that\u2019s the police sign, which\nyou had on the back o -- of the jacket. I think they did that to police here, they back -- they had in\nNorway at that time. So I had -- it had a number, a nu -- number, if you go down there, you see\nthe police. I had also a secret police membership. The card shows that. So --",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s --",
        "A: -- now Iam a member of the secret federal police, and -- the Norwegian one. There were -- I\nwas a spy, so I could use that in case I was in trouble. Very few times we -- I -- it usually could\nbe used and help me. This is an ordinary police -- and this -- this 1s bri -- driver\u2019s license, the\nfuehrer court, fuehrer court. That\u2019s the driver\u2019s license, I had the made up driver\u2019s license like\nthe name I had, so I also changed the driver\u2019s license, all of them, and then it\u2019s maybe a little one\nof the -- the last I had, I had it renewed in 1945, so I never -- I shouldn\u2019t tell that to the police\nbecause I never had an exam. And here, you see, that\u2019s the one there, if you go back a little,\nthat\u2019s Erling Fjeld as a soldier in Great Britain. So it shows, you could give him any rank, Erling\nFjeld, he was a -- he was a fake name, so -- but it\u2019s incredible, it\u2019s all original soldiers\n[indecipherable] for duration of war.",
        "A: Yeah, and then a [indecipherable] yes, where they advised me, the British security police, to\nuse a false name because of the spy risks in -- because I should go back into Norway. If you go a\nlittle on the side there, that green card there, then I was -- that card has been through about 50\nGestapo controls between Oslo and the border, and I had no difficulties. It\u2019s very -- I look\ninnocent, and the passport was ideal. You had to have that kind of passport when you came up to\nthe border. The border district had special passports with -- which I had.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s --",
        "A: -- it\u2019s actually a cap.",
        "A: It looks like a beret, but it\u2019s a cap.",
        "A: But the -- because of the pictures. And that\u2019s an ordinary passport which I got in Stockholm.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s a -- a real one under a false name. That was made up by Norwegian authorities in\nStockholm, and it was used only when I was going to England. And it had -- this has all stamps\nfrom British authorities.",
        "A: That\u2019s real one, made by Norwegian authorities outside Norway, of course, not the inside\nNorway. I could do because I had the garment and everything else [indecipherable] Norway, here\nin the war. Here you see some of the stamps which I had -- was made for me. And I used them,\nand I had stamps, I have a -- about 50 of them [indecipherable] papers, because when you had a\ncar, you had to have a license plates, they were false, you had to have a control sign on your pay\n-- on your window, or it said that you -- you could run a car, you could run through the night.\nYou had all -- I had all kinds of -- when I came into, four o\u2019clock in the morning, I had a sign\nshowing from the Gestapo cho -- top chief that I could do it. So everything was -- and I also had\nto make up a book. So when you were out, I had to say -- I had to know what kind of job have\nyou had tonight with the control. And I -- I -- I did all that. It was -- could be with a car, and all\nthat, could be three, four, five [indecipherable] you need -- they were all there. It was a -- in my\nopinion, it should have been a little strange that you had a routine, you were -- and there were to\n-- you were too good. [tape break] -- they put in the --",
        "A: -- the hands from the back.",
        "A: Handcuffs --",
        "A: Oh yes, those handcuffs there was used, and I handcuffed the hands on the back when I trol --\ntried to control the guards. So -- but you had to be very quick to put the handcuffs on a man\n[indecipherable] bigger than you, and you had to be very quick.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s the -- for that [indecipherable] prison, those keys there, it was for the cells. I\ncould have got right in there when we tried to get out my friend, who was later shot and who we\ntried to give that poison pill. It must be very hard for him, instead of we taking out, he just got a\npill. Please take it [indecipherable]. It was terrible to -- for us, too, to do that. But he was terribly\ntortured. Could have helped him.",
        "A: Yeah, that -- is that a [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, that could be used if you are a --",
        "A: No, [ha -- I didn\u2019t, but I knew exactly, I was trained how to use it. If you hit a man just\nbehind the ears you can kill him always. They are terribly -- they are very -- and if you hit the\nman on the nose like that, he wouldn\u2019t talk to you for some hours, I can tell you. So it\u2019s a very\ndangerous thing. For German and Norwegian, I'll tell you that.",
        "A: Yeah, this is a passport which we used when you are nearing the border. When we were about\n25 from the border, 25 miles, then you would have a special passport. Every citizen there would\nhave this kind, so you can -- you are allowed to be in that district so near the border. And it was\nnecessary to have this. If you haven\u2019t got them, you would be arrested when you -- it was a\nrestricted area alongside a border. And that\u2019s a picture that I usually -- when you take a picture in\nthat box in the station all that, they\u2019re all different. Look like criminal anyway, don\u2019t you, when\nyou have these pictures taken.",
        "A: And it\u2019s in German and Norwegian. So you can see the German, now you would read the\nGerman, so the -- the German guard would see immediately that you were supposed to be there.\nAnd you -- you would be arrested co -- if you hadn\u2019t a good reason to be visiting there, and even\nif you should go 30 miles in Norway, you had to have a permission. The written permission. And\nhere is that passport of Thor Hansen. Then -- this I very seldom used, because you see in the\nsignature th-that is from the general -- Nazi general Martinsen who was the most -- that\u2019s my\nhandwriting, but on the we -- left side, you see it\u2019s signed by Martinsen, he was one of the worst\nmen we had in Norway. He was a leader of the -- all these state police, all the federal Nazi\npolice, and I used to -- I know his handwriting so well now, so I can -- if you want me to sign it,\nI may be able to sign it even today.",
        "A: I would use it in -- for instance when I had to go to a special district in Norway with a -- to try\n-- if it was a real hurry, to get to tol -- tell people, give them some idea, then I could use this. And\nin the car, I had a car, it was the same state police car, federal -- could be a Chevrolet, could be a\nChrysler that I -- that I had, and that -- I had a driver\u2019s license with the same name, Thor Hansen,\nand that -- on the -- I -- plate there, it said -- the state police, federal police. So it could be three,\nfour documents which you had to have in order to go through that control, Gestapo control.",
        "A: No, no, it\u2019s all civilian.",
        "A: We\u2019re all civilians. All Gestapo, they were ordinary civilians. Very seldom they show that\nthey were all S -- SS, they had high ranks, but they were -- to do that job, they had to be all, as in\nGermany, they were all civilian clothes. So I had -- I didn't need the -- and that\u2019s an ordinary\npassport, which every Norwegian had to have, with the number and everything. Luckily, if you\nsee the number on top there, if they had stopped me, and had the lightest suspicion that I was\nlying, then they would call that number, that was that.",
        "A: And I was finished. So -- but I never -- they never did, luckily. But if they did so, you would\nbe taken immediately. Then you are -- then you would be killed.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s Erling Jacobsen, 1s it?",
        "A: Erling -- oh this 1s Brul, that\u2019s my -- bull. Chicago Bulls.",
        "A: No, this is Erling -- Erling Johannes Brul --",
        "A: -- you see, on the top there.",
        "A: That\u2019s the family name on the top.",
        "A: And down to 16 years you had to have these passports, everybody.",
        "A: When you had that passport and you -- no, when you had that passport, on the left side you\nhad a J printed when you were a Jew. And that came in, I think it was in \u201941 - \u201942, it was terrible,\nof course, when we saw that in Norway. We had never thought of it, that he was -- was he -- that\n[indecipherable] was he we didn\u2019t ever think about it, so we thought it was awful, all Norway.",
        "A: Not at all. When I leave here, I put the drawer inside again. Now, I have taken the drawer out,\nwhen I leave this room, I put it in again.",
        "A: No, not at all.",
        "A: No. But I have to think about it tomorrow, because then I --",
        "A: -- meet my friend, and we have to talk about it. Then you have to put it in again.",
        "A: No, I am lucky there. I am just [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- tonight --",
        "A: [indecipherable] think about it.",
        "A: Oh yes. Why shouldn\u2019t it?",
        "A: It\u2019s in here -- it\u2019s in -- time now, I don\u2019t need to think that way.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. It was so long ago, you know, so -- no, don\u2019t think about it.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: Not yet.",
        "A: No, no, not at all. Well, we were many, you know. And some of the small people here, which\nhelped us, could be the hero, for instance, any of them, gave us the right intelligence. And if we\nwere taken and you know, I could get away because I was quite clever, you know, and the others,\nthey [indecipherable]. So they, the helpers were usually the heroes. That\u2019s quite clear. Oh, that\u2019s\nquite clear.",
