        "Q: But you \u2014 you weren\u2019t raised there, is that correct?",
        "A: No, I was raised in Jaroslaw, which is a city on the San river, again between\nRzeszow and Krakow.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s fairly near Rzeszow.",
        "A: Yes, it 1s.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "Q: Yes. And how come you were born in Rzesz\u00e9w and then went to Jaroslaw, do\nyou know?",

        "A: Which was Rzeszow.",
        "Q: Right. Tell me a little bit about your family. Tell me about your relationship with\nyour father and your mother. Do you remember? I mean, not when you were a baby,\nof course.",

        "A: When I was a little bit older, we used to spend \u2014 spend summers with Grandpa in\nRzeszow, and I had another grandfather in Jaroslaw, who was the grandfather on\nmy father\u2019s side, and the rest of the time \u2014 time, we lived in Jaroslaw on the San\nriver. And it was a normal, middle class Jewish household. Moderately observant, I\nwould not say strictly observant. And my father had a lumberyard, and they also\nmanufactured some bricks, and they built small houses with those bricks and with\nother building materials that were available. And that\u2019s the way \u2014 and that\u2019s the way\nmy childhood is remembered in my mind. The business that my father ran was very\nmuch like the business that my maternal grandfather ran. It was a middle of the road,\nAugust 12, 2009\nnot very large, not very small, but old enough and large enough to provide them with\na livelihood, and that\u2019s the way I remember it, by September 1, 1939, which was the\nday when Nazi Germany attacked Poland. And my first wartime memory 1s \u2014",
        "Q: Can \u2014 can we \u2014 can we go back a little bit?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Ju-Ju-Just bef-before \u2014 before the war. Because your brother was born in 1932, is\nthat correct?",
        "A: That is correct, yes.",
        "Q: What was your relationship with your father like? Was it \u2014 was it a close\nrelationship before the war?",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was a reasonably close relationship with my father and my mother.\nAnd my mother was the stricter of the two, and my father was the one that you\nalways would run for shelter and assistance when my mother was getting too tough.",
        "Q: And what ki \u2014 how tough did she get? What \u2014 wha-what did she do?",
        "A: Well, she wou \u2014 she would slap me on my behind, or she would take away some\nprivilege, or \u2014 or some special kind of dessert food. And this was, again, quite\ncommon in those days.",
        "Q: So you ran to your father to get protection?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And did he protect you?\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: He usually did. He would tell her to take it easy, or it was really not so bad, you\nknow, so what do you want from him, he\u2019s only a boy. Things of that kind.",
        "Q: And was this rather typical in that \u2014 in households that you remember, that the\nmother was much stricter than the father?",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: Th-There were conversations, but nothing very exciting or very important,\nbecause after all, I was at the most, nine years old.",
        "Q: Right.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: And my younger brother was two and a half years younger.",
        "Q: Right. And was this \u2014 you s \u2014 you said that your mother was somewhat religious,\nwas the household very religious? Were you kosher?",
        "A: Yes, we were kosher, but being kosher did not consi \u2014 it was not considered being\nstrongly religious, this was the minimum religiosity that was expected.",
        "Q: Did you go to synagogue?",
        "A: Yes, we went to synagogue quite regularly with my father and grandfather, and I\neven remember where we sat in the synagogue.",

        "A: They were all Orthodox.",
        "Q: Right. So did you wear a kepele?",
        "A: Yes, of course.",
        "Q: You did. And were you \u2014 did you wear \u2014 did you have payos as a young boy?",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I did not have \u2014 I did not have payos, and I attended a state Polish school in the\nmorning, and a moderately strict cheder in the afternoon.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And the regular school that you started going to when you were \u2014 did\nyou start when you were five or six years old?",
        "A: About that.",
        "Q: And did you like school?",

        "A: No, I went to a regular state school.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And did you have a lot of friends?",
        "A: Not that many, but I did have a few.",

        "A: Most of my friend were Jewish.",
        "Q: So the \u2014 the \u2014 where you lived, was it mainly a Jewish neighborhood?",
        "A: That\u2019s correct, 1t was predominantly Jewish.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And what sort of a home did you have? Did you have a house, or did you\nhave an apartment, do you remember?",
        "A: Yes, we had an apartment, and I even saw that apartment after the war, when we\nvisited Poland, and I remember the address, it was the Slovaski(ph) Street, house\nnumber 14 on the second floor.",
        "Q: Mm, so you were on one floor, the \u2014 of a house, and someone else lived below\nyou?",
        "A: No, someone else lived beside us.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And when your brother was born, was this a difficult time for you, or were you\nhappy to have him \u2014 an-another sibling? Do you remember?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay. Do you remember if politics were discussed at all, so that by the time the\nNazis attacked in 1939 that you were expecting this, did you hear things?",
        "A: We heard things, we were expecting things. It was not unusual, and it was not at\nall uncommon for politics to be discussed at the table. So that when the Nazis\nattacked on September 1, 1939, it did not come as a surprise. And my first memory\nAugust 12, 2009\nof the war was a Nazi airplane flying very low, and somebody living in the same\napartment building jumping out of the house with a small revolver, the kind of \u2014 the\nkind that ladies would have in their bags, and he shot at that plane.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Right. And it was to me a symbol of futility of resistance, because there wasn\u2019t a\nthing that this pla \u2014 that this shooting could do to the plane.",
        "Q: So even at such a young age you thought that?",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But 1-1n \u2014 in 1939 in September, your father was already in the Polish\narmy, 1s that correct? So his \u2014",
        "A: Right, he was in the Polish army \u2014 he was in the Polish army because there was a\ncall to arms, you know, asking all eligible males to present themselves at this, that\nand the other place. But as it turned out later on, they didn\u2019t even get to provide them\nwith uniforms, let alone with arms, when the Polish army was crushed by the Nazis.",
        "Q: So where yo \u2014 you went with your mother and your brother, an-and \u2014 and was \u2014\ndid you go with your grandparents to Tarnopol?",
        "A: No, no, because they were in Rzesz\u00e9w, and we were in Jaroslaw.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So one morning a couple of Nazi soldiers and local collaborators appeared in \u2014 in\nour apartment and they gave us five minutes to get ready, and they deported us on\nAugust 12, 2009\nthe other si \u2014 to the other side of the San river, which was to become the Soviet zone\nof occupation, as distinct from the German zone of occupation, which they decided\nto make free of Jews.",
        "Q: So you were deported, this wasn\u2019t \u2014 this wasn\u2019t a decision that was made by your\nmother to \u2014 to leave.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct, that\u2019s correct. And I remember we arrived at the bridge on the\nriver, and I clearly remember an example of Nazi humor. There was a \u2014 a roadside \u2014\na roadside sign which says in German, nach Palastina, to Palestine. And we were\njust \u2014 we were just pushed to the other side of the river, and then the Germans\nreturned to their side of the river, and we were on the other side for a few days, and\nit was not clear what those few days will bring, and where we will end up. I\nremember we stopped in this small Jewish town, and my mother wanted a place\nwhere she could wash me and my kid brother. And it turned out that the only place\nwhere you could get washed was the local mikveh, the religious bathhouse where \u2014\nwhere women would immerse themselves after their periods, to make themselves\nagain clean. And in that little town, it was a town with a single industry. The\nindustry was making twittel(ph) \u2014 making the phylacteries that observant Jews used\nfor prayers on their hands, on their arms and on their forehead. And then a few days\nlater we met my father, who was looking for us because the army, the Polish army\ndisintegrated, and the \u2014 there was absolutely nothing else for him to do. And there\nAugust 12, 2009\nwere people roaming around looking for deported relatives and friends. And that\u2019s\nhow \u2014 and that\u2019s how he found us.",
        "Q: Did he know that you had gone to Tarnopol?",
        "A: No. But he figured it out because that was the only relative that we had on that\nside of Poland. And so he went to Tarnopol, and so did we, and that\u2019s where we\nmet.",
        "Q: So, you were not deported to Tarnopol, you were deported over the San river.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and then you had to figure out what to do.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: I mean, your mother had to figure out what to do.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, right.",
        "Q: And those few days that you spent pr-prior to going to Tarnopol, were they\nterrible? I mean were there \u2014 were there a lot of people?",
        "A: Oh, there were a lot of people, but they were not terrible, because there were no\nshortages, and whoever lived in that area would try to share with us some food or\nwhatever else was available.",
        "Q: So, when you were sent over to the San river, that \u2014 that \u2014 you were walking, I\ngather.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "Q: Did you have a little backpack \u2014 not a backpack, but a knapsack with you or\nsomething?",
        "A: Yes, yes. So would have \u2014 so you would have some laundry to change into.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I think an extra pair of shoes or something like this.",
        "Q: Right, but you couldn\u2019t carry anything very heavy, clearly, right?",
        "A: No, no, of course not.",
        "Q: Did your \u2014 did your mother carry some food with her?",
        "A: A little, but not much. Again \u2014 again, it was some bread and cheese.",
        "Q: Right. And, did you walk to Tarnopol then?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And were there \u2014 you had relatives there, I gather.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s sister lived in Tarnopol.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So that\u2019s where we went.",
        "Q: And you went there and you stayed there in \u2014 in their home?",
        "A: We stayed in their home for several months until the deportation to Russia.",
        "Q: So it was just a few months?",
        "A: Just a few months.",
        "Q: So you get there in September, and you leave \u2014\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: And we left next spring, when the \u2014 the Russian authorities asked all the refugees\nwho came from the other side, who expressed their preference, the preferences being\nto remain a Soviet citizen and stay at Tarnopol, or to go back to the places from\nwhich they were ejected by the Nazis, which is what we chose to do, because that\u2019s\nwhere most of the family was, in Rzeszow, and some even in Jaroslaw, because not\nall of us were deported of the same day.",
        "Q: I see. So you wanted to go back.",
        "A: We wanted to go back because we wanted to be together with the others.",
        "Q: Right. But this was a ruse by the Russians \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s correct. And one night they appeared in my aunt\u2019s apartment, and they\nread our names and they said, you will have your wish carried out, and they took us\nto the railroad station, put us in cattle cars, and we were supposed to go to the other\nside of San river, but instead when the train began to move, it became obvious that\nwe were moving in the direction of east, rather than west, and east was Russia.",
        "Q: Right. We \u2014 let me go back a little bit. What \u2014 what was it like for you on\nTarnopol? Was this a difficult time for you, or was it okay?",
        "A: It was okay. It was not very difficult because there was no \u2014 there was no strict\nrules about behavior or buying or selling food. So, you know, th-there were a few\nrules, which were not terribly strictly observed, until they put us in those cattle cars\nAugust 12, 2009\nand begun to move in the direction opposite to the one that we expected to be moved\nto.",
        "Q: Right, right. So 1t wasn\u2019t \u2014 so \u2014 so you \u2014 did your father work during that period\nof time in Tarnopol?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: He did. Where did he work?",
        "A: He \u2014 he worked on behalf of the authorities examining state property to make\nsure that nothing would collapse, or burn down, or get stolen. But again, this was a\nvery pro forma kind of arrangement, which was supposed to change into more perm-\npermanent one, until \u2014 until we were sent to those cattle cars, and until the train\nbegan to move east.",
        "Q: And your brother was okay?",
        "A: My brother was okay.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did you have s-separate roo \u2014 I mean, ha \u2014 what were your\naccommodations like when you were staying with your \u2014 your mother\u2019s sister? Did\nyou have separate rooms, or what?",
        "A: No, no, we \u2014 the accommodations were, I think we slept in the kitchen, and they\nslept in the bedroom.",
        "Q: I see. So they had a small home.",
        "A: Yes.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "Q: Right. Did your father get paid for this work?",
        "A: He got paid some, in the form of food rations, military rations.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Now, your mother didn\u2019t work, I gather?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Right. And what was your \u2014 the husband of your mother\u2019s sister, what work did\nhe do? Was he under the Russians also?",
        "A: He was under the Russians also, and he tried to get some government approved\nwork, but they didn\u2019t get around to it.",
        "Q: Were you, by the way, as a\u2014I mean, now you are 10 years old.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right? Or 11 years old.",
        "A: 10 \u2014te \u2014 10 years old.",
        "Q: Yes. Were you frightened about going back to Poland, or did you not think about\nthat?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t think about that.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t. So, was there talk about what the Nazis were doing, what the \u2014",
        "A: No, the Nazis were not doing \u2014",
        "Q: They weren\u2019t doing much.",
        "A: They were not doing much that early in the game.",
        "Q: Right. So nobody was that afraid.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Right. Okay, so the Russians take you, they claim that they\u2019re gonna send you\nback to Poland, but they don\u2019t.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: So they send you east instead of west.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And where do you \u2014 and what\u2019s the \u2014 what\u2019s the train like?",
        "A: The train was, oh about 15 or 20 car \u2014 cars filled with people, and locked. And\ninside you had a hole so you could pee in \u2014 in it. But other than that, again, there was\nnothing special, except that they distributed a little water to drink, and a little bread\nto eat.",
        "Q: Were you fr \u2014 was this a frightening time for you?",
        "A: Yes, it was already, because we didn\u2019t know where we were \u2014 where we were\ngoing, and why we are being sent there, and what we have to do once we arrive.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re \u2014 and you\u2019re with your \u2014 your brother and your mother and your\nfather?",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Were you also with your mother\u2019s sister and her \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They had se \u2014\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: Because \u2014 because she was considered a Soviet citizen \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 without any question.",
        "Q: Right. So she could stay there.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right. Do you \u2014 do you remember your parents being nervous?",
        "A: Yes, of course they were nervous, but so was everybody else.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And the assumption was that whatever happens to the rest of us will happen to us,\nand we can do nothing to change it.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So do you remember how \u2014 about how long the trip was in the \u2014",
        "A: The trip was about \u2014 the trip was about \u2014 close to two weeks.",
        "Q: Two weeks?",
        "A: Yes, because very often we would arrive at a junction, and they would just leave\nus there for a day or two.",

        "A: And we ended up in what was then Sverdlovsk province, which is now\nYekaterinburg province after they changed the names back to the pre-Soviet ones.\nAnd they \u2014 and I actually saw the barracks, which still stand there.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I mean, I was there \u2014 I was there after the end of the Soviet regime. So we went to\nthe \u2014 the Yekaterinburg province, not too far from the large city of Tyumen, and\nwithin that, there was a lumber procurement barracks, and that\u2019s where I got \u2014 they\nleft us. They got us all together and they said, you\u2019Il be working here on\nprocurement of lumber for the needs of the Soviet state. And you better get it in your\nmind that if you work hard, we\u2019ll feed you. If you don\u2019t work hard, we won\u2019t feed\nyou, and then you\u2019|l starve to death and we\u2019ll bury you here, because there is plenty\nAugust 12, 2009\nof room for all of you, and that is the way it is with people who are trying to resist\nthe needs of the Soviet state.",
        "Q: And who was this that spoke to you? Do you remember?",
        "A: Ah, yes. I even remember his name. His name was Skavaroatnikov(ph) which\nliterally \u2014 which literally means the spatula and frying pan. He \u2014 he was \u2014 he\nrepresented the authorities, more directly authorities of the \u2014 of the NK VD, which\nwas the Soviet secret police.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Now, when you were \u2014 you were brought into barracks?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And is that where you lived as a \u2014 you lived as a family there?",
        "A: We lived as a family, plus a-an older brother of my mother\u2019s, who was deported\nwith us because he was \u2014 he was in with us together in Tarnopol at her sister\u2019s. So,\nmy father went to work immediately to next day, and this uncle of mine, being a\ntraditional Orthodox Jew, decided that he\u2019Il first s-say his prayers. And as he was\nsaying his prayers, the KGB or NKVD or secret police commander came in, took\nout a watch from his pocket, and said there is no way you will get to work on time.\nSo we are going to send you to a different camp. And they send him to a stricter\ncamp \u2014 camp, with a solitary, with common criminals. And he was beaten there by\nthe common criminals, so much so that when he came back, he was insane.",
        "Q: This was Ephraim?\n22\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: Ephraim.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re gonna have to stop the tape at this moment so they can change it.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: So we\u2019ll get back to this.\nEnd of Tape One\nAugust 12, 2009\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to Ephraim for a moment. Do you \u2014 do you re \u2014 you remember\nEphraim from Tarnopol, and then the \u2014 on the ride to Sverlovsk \u2014 Sverdlovsk?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And how did you find out what happened to him?",
        "A: We - we did not find out. He returned from that solitary, I think, where he was\nbeaten severely til he lost his mind. And I remember there was a psychiatrist among\nthe inmates, and he talked to him, and he shrugged his shoulders, and he said, there\u2019s\nnothing I can do for him here. And he went out one day and he never came back.\nAnd we never found out what happened to him.",
        "Q: What happened. And how did you find out that he had been beaten? I mean, did\nyou meet people who had been in that other camp?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And do you \u2014 do you know the name of that other camp?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was it ir \u2014 Irkutsk?",
        "A: No, Irkutsk \u2014 Irkutsk was when my \u2014 where my grandfather from my mother\u2019s\nside was, in the place called Bodaibo, b-o-d-a-i-b-o, which, believe it or not, I heard\nabout again a few days ago, because a woman who was not a Polish Jew, and who\nwas brought to this country with her son, who is a professor of mathematics at\nAugust 12, 2009\nBrown University, and who calls me because she speaks no English, and had\nnobody to talk to. She said that she lived not too far from where the deportees lived.\nAnd the \u2014 she knew that the deportees from Poland lived in this camp, not too far\naway from them, but she could do nothing for them, and she heard that ultimately\nthey were allo \u2014 allowed to go back to Poland after World War II. And she was\nasking me whether there 1s any way to find a woman who was her friend. And I said,\nI don\u2019t know of any.",
        "Q: Right. So you have no idea \u2014 Ephraim was not in the same camp \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 as \u2014 as the grandfather.",
        "A: No, grandfather was several thousand miles to the east.",
        "Q: I see. So he was closer to your camp \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: \u2014 as \u2014I see. But \u2014 and where was Aaron, who was the younger brother, was he\nwith your grandfather?",
        "A: He was with my grandfather.",
        "Q: I see. I guess I was under the impression that \u2014 that Ephraim was with him, but\nthat\u2019s not the case.",
        "A: No.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "Q: And did you \u2014 did you find out about Ephraim when you were in sv \u2014 in\nSverdlovsk, or \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did you do in Sverdlovsk?",
        "A: My -",
        "Q: Did you work?",
        "A: No, I did not. I attended school.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes, it was a school with one teacher, and children under, I think 12 or 14 were\nallowed to attend school. So I was in that school and so was my kid brother, and I\nremember I was worried about my kid brother getting us all into trouble, because he\ngot \u2014 he got a primer which had on page one, the portraits of Lenin\u2019s wife,\nKrupskaya. And since he found the classes boring, he adorned Krupskaya with a\nmoustache and a few other parts of masculine rather than feminine \u2014 masculine\nrather than \u2014 than feminine appearance. And I was sure that this little notebook\nwould be requisitioned and then they\u2019II start to figure out who must have put him up\nto it. Well \u2014",
        "Q: And that would have been you?\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: And that would have been me.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t do it, and they didn\u2019t look for it.",
        "Q: What was the school like?",
        "A: The school was a little hut with wa \u2014 with two rooms. The lower room was the\none that I went with, and my brother, and the other room was for somewhat older\nkids.",
        "Q: And was this a very ideological school? Was it communist?",
        "A: Oh yes, of course.",
        "Q: Yes. So did you \u2014 would \u2014 were you taught about Lenin and Marx?",
        "A: Yes. No, I don\u2019t think Marx.",
        "Q: But Lenin.",
        "A: But Lenin, yes.",
        "Q: Did you hate it? Or did you find it interesting?",
        "A: No, I found it boring.",
        "Q: Boring?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Why was it boring?",
        "A: Because a \u2014 it was just presented in a boring way.",
        "Q: I see. And did you have other subject matters, other than \u2014\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: Yes, they taught \u2014 they taught arithmetic and I think geography.",
        "Q: Arithmetic and geography and nothing else?",
        "A: Nothing else.",
        "Q: Hm. And did you have homework?",
        "A: Yes. You know, we \u2014 we had say four pages of mathematical problems, asking\nfor the results.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And when you were living in the barracks, was it a little bit like a small\napartment, or was it not like that?",
        "A: It was a little bit like a small apartment.",
        "Q: And did you have an inside bathroom, or an outside bathroom?",
        "A: Nobody had an inside bathroom.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So there was an outhouse in the back.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Yes. And was there some running water inside the apartment, or not even that?",
        "A: No, not even that.",
        "Q: So where did you get water from? Was there a well?",
        "A: No, I think there was a spigot outside.",
        "Q: Do you\u2019d have to bring in the water.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And your \u2014 your mother didn\u2019t work, or she did?\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: She did.",
        "Q: And do you remember what she did?",
        "A: She did, I think \u2014 she was peeling potatoes, which were then cooked and which\nwas the main source of nourishment.",
        "Q: And was there a common kitch \u2014 I mean, a cafeteria?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Is \u2014 no, you \u2014 you ate in \u2014 in your own barrack.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Barrack room.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: So, wh-what would happen then? The \u2014 some of the food would be rationed and\ngiven to each family, or what?",
        "A: Yes. [indecipherable]. If there were three of you, you got three potatoes.",
        "Q: I see. So your daily ration was potatoes.",
        "A: Right. And \u2014 and a piece of bread.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And it \u2014 and it was there that malnutrition resulted in me getting the jaundice.",
        "Q: Can you explain what that was like? What is jaundice?",
        "A: Jaundice is a \u2014 an illness caused by malnutrition, and you \u2014 the sign 1 \u2014 of it is\nthat the whites of your eyes turn yellow. Now the whites of my eyes turned\nAugust 12, 2009\npractically brown, because I did not have the kind of food or medication that you use\nto treat jaundice. And for entertainment I will go outside the barracks because a few\npeople there were to dig a grave for me. And so they would try and do it on the\nwarmer days. You know, they would start the fire, and then the soil that was under\nthe fire was warm enough for digging. Well, they never got around to burying me. I\nmanaged somehow to escape death, but the result of the jaundice is something that \u2014\nthat I had for years and years later, because the art \u2014 the jaundice that was not cured,\nresulted in problems with my \u2014 what is \u2014 what is the \u2014 wi-with-with ma \u2014 problems\nwith \u2014 with my li-liver, and th-the other thing which \u2014 gall bladder. So there was\nenough of damage done \u2014 done to those two things so that years later I was\nexempted from military service, because of problems with liver and with gall\nbladder which require a special diet and medication.",
        "Q: I see. And what was the effect, besides the \u2014 the physical effect of your \u2014 your \u2014\nthe whites of your eyes going brown, what was the effect of the jaundice on you? Do\nyou remember?",
        "A: Yes, it was \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it gave me intermittent gall \u2014 gall bladder and \u2014 and liver\nfever. And that was it. And the assumption was that if you didn\u2019t take care of that\nwith medication and proper diet, you would die.",
        "Q: Right. But you didn\u2019t.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "Q: So you went outside to watch these people digging a grave for you?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Then wa \u2014 what did you say to them?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing. You just watched them.",
        "A: I just watched them.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And I remember \u2014 and I remember in the first few days after the Nazis entered\nJaroslaw, Hitler came to see how Jaroslaw under the Nazis managed to live. And\nthe \u2014 and orders went out that on such and such a date, under the penalty of\nexecution, nobody was to be close to a window. And \u2014 but I \u2014 but I was not going to\nobey this order, because there was an important thing for me to ascertain. The\nimportant thing was that when the Nazis s-scream heil Hitler, whether Hitler will\nscream heil ich. And Hitler did not scream heil ich, he replied heil sieg, you know.\nLong \u2014 long live victory. And that was it, and nobody caught me, so I did not face\npenalty of death.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And we were in that camp on the border of Siberia, in the Urals until a few days\nafter the attack of Germany on the Soviet Union, which was June 22, 1941. And\novernight, they decided that we should no longer be confined to camps, but we\nAugust 12, 2009\nshould be allowed to live outside of camps, except only for specific large cities and\nmilitary objects. And so they told us to get the hell out of the camp. And since we\nwere all freezing in those camps, the decision that was made immediately was that\nwhatever it 1s, we shall try and escape Siberia, the Urals and go to a warmer\nclimate. And I remember somebody got a map, and on this map we circled those\ntowns where we wanted to go. And one of those towns was Jambol. Jambol which\nright now has reverted to its pre-revolutionary name, Taras. Jambol himself was a \u2014\nwas a folk singer specializing in obsequious odes to Stalin and all his henchmen.\nNow, the name of \u2014 of Taras is the one that you may have heard the last few days\nhere, because it was the name of the \u2014 of the [indecipherable] who lived \u2014 who\nlived on the other side of the frontier between the U.S.S.R and China, where they\nstill live.",
        "Q: Right. Let me go back to Sverdlovsk for \u2014 for a minute. Was it cold all the time?",
        "A: Not all the time, but a lot of the time.",
        "Q: A lot of the time. And did you have proper clothing, or you didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: So it was extremely uncomfortable.",
        "A: It was extremely uncomfortable.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "Q: Was it very snowy and icy?",
        "A: No. The snow once fell, and stayed.",
        "Q: That was it.",
        "A: That was it. I saw this after the collapse of the Soviet regime, when I went to\nOmsk in Siberia. We stayed in a hotel, and th-there was steady \u2014 there was snow the\nheight of \u2014 of five foot eight, five foot nine, and nobody ever tried to clean it.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And did you have that same kind of situation \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 when you were \u2014 when you were there?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So how did you get out of the barracks?",
        "A: Because they would dig up a \u2014 enough snow so that you could go out one by one.",
        "Q: So you could go out in line, sort of.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Was this a bad time for you in Sverdlovsk, that you remember?",
        "A: Yes, it was a bad time because we were all starving. And also because we didn\u2019t\nknow what the charges are against us, or how long we\u2019ll \u2014 we be there. But we were\nlucky because the war all of a sudden made us into allies.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we were allowed to go to Jambol.",
        "Q: Right. Were you \u2014 when it \u2014 when you were in Sverdlovsk, did you get any\ncommunication from relatives in Poland? Do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: We got a few postcards, which were sent from German occupied Poland, but not\nvery much.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t know very much about what was going on?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you hear rumors, do you remember, as a kid?",
        "A: We heard rumors, but we were not sure whether the rumors are correct. One\nrumor that reached us was that Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico, because the\nSoviets were afraid that Trotsky may offer some valuable assistance to the\nGermans, and they really expected the Germans to attack the Soviet Union.",
        "Q: They did?",
        "A: Yes, even though \u2014 even though the official line was that the Germans are our \u2014\nare our allies.",
        "Q: But what you know from history is that Stalin was \u2014 was \u2014 seemed not to be\nwanting to hear this.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: So that \u2014 because the army was not really \u2014 were not prepared.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: He had \u2014 he had just decimated his own army.",
        "Q: Did anyone else in the family get jaundice, do you know other people that got\njaundice, wer \u2014 wer \u2014 or did you think you were the only one?",
        "A: I thought I was the only one. But I never heard of anybody else getting jaundice.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t. But that\u2019s a typical disease from starvation.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: And a lot of people were not eating well.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: So it is a little surprising that you\u2019re the only one.",
        "A: It is.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But maybe I wasn\u2019t looking for that.",

        "A: May \u2014 maybe there were a few \u2014",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, two or three doors in the other direction.",
        "Q: Right. But no one in your family. Your brother didn\u2019t get it and your mother and\nfather didn\u2019t get it.",
        "A: No, no, I \u2014 it\u2019s not contagious.",
        "Q: No, I understand \u2014\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 they \u2014 they also didn\u2019t get it \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: \u2014 from the \u2014 from the food that they were eating.",
        "A: Right, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Did you lose a lot of weight?",
        "A: Oh yes, I lost a lot of weight.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Were you very tired from \u2014 from not eating so much?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So you weren\u2019t growing very much, I would imagine.",
        "A: No, I was not.",
        "Q: Yeah. When \u2014 who took out the maps? I mean, where did they get maps from?",
        "A: I think they got the maps from some drivers of \u2014 of lorries, who had the maps. I\ndon\u2019t think they got the maps, I think they were \u2014",
        "Q: They were borrowed.",
        "A: They were borrowed.",
        "Q: I see. And the decision to go south \u2014 and a lot of people went south, I gather.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Now how did you go to ja \u2014 Jambol?",
        "A: By cattle cars, the same way as we arrived in Yekaterinburg.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "Q: So, did you have to pay for these, or 1t was \u2014 were \u2014 did \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t think we had to pay for these, because we didn\u2019t have any money.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But they just gave us a certificate saying that so and so was released from this and\nthis camp by the authorities in accordance with the lo \u2014 with the rule \u2014 with \u2014 with\nthe decision of the council of ministers on such and such a date.",
        "Q: Right. And the rush \u2014 the Soviet Union, the \u2014 they didn\u2019t care where you went?",
        "A: Well, they did care, but we couldn\u2019t go west, because that\u2019s where the Nazis\nwere.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So we went \u2014 so we went from where they [indecipherable] Siberian railroad,\nwhich went only one way.",
        "Q: Which was south.",
        "A: Which was south.",
        "Q: Right. So did \u2014 did a lot of people go to Jambol from this camp?",

        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: You\u2019re welcome.",
        "A: And in Jambol you also have other deportees from other places, quite a few from\nthe Caucasus, where the Germans were advancing and the Soviets were deporting\nnative s-speakers of languages of the Caucasus, because they were sure that they\nwould greet the arrival of the Germans with joy. And so they dumped them in the\nsame Jambol.",

It was a Soviet institution that would exchange valuables that foreigners\nmay have had, for things that you couldn\u2019t otherwise get, such as food, such as\nclothing.

And in this respect it was\nbetter to be a student in the Polish school than in the state Russian school. The\nRussian school did not enjoy any special privileges and the Polish school did.

        "A: Because they failed in their blitzkrieg.

        "A: There is a language called Kazakh, which is close to Turkish. And they taught\nKazakh in the Russian school, but they didn\u2019t take it seriously, just as Kazakh\nindependence was not treated seriously. I still remember one poem, of Jambol\n[indecipherable], which went as follows [speaks foreign language here].",
        "Q: Can you translate that, sort of?",
        "A: Sort of, that we \u2014 we sing the praises of our soldiers who are the defender \u2014 the\ndefenders of our nation. And while we sing their praises, we also sing the praises of\nthe great Russian nation. That\u2019s it.",

        "A: Russian classics.",
        "Q: Like what? Do you remember?",

        "Q: Right.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: But there was nothing unusual about that. I would say that most \u2014 most kids read\nthe same books. We read whatever books were allowed to be given to us by the\nlibrary.",
        "Q: Because reading was really the primary occupation that you could \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",

        "A: To go back first to Lemberg, or Lvov. And then to cross into what would be\nagain an independent Polish state.",
        "Q: And so where did you go?",
        "A: This exactly the way we went. We had somebody who sent us \u2014 some distant\ncousin of mine who sent us a request to join him in the Polish [indecipherable] of\nAugust 12, 2009\nPoland, and on the basis of that, we got railroad tickets and we went in that\ndirection.

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what was Krakow like then?",
        "A: Well, Krak\u00e9w was the one town that was not destroyed by the war. It was pretty\nmuch like the pre-war Krakow, except that there were hardly any Jews in it. Before\nthe war, Krak\u00e9w was about half Jewish.",
        "Q: Right. And did you find out when you crossed into Poland what had happened to\nJews, I mean in terms of the murdered Jews, or what?",
        "A: We found it out when we arrived in Krakow, but later on we would get more and\nmore details on how it worked, and where.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and you believed it?",
        "A: Well, if you didn\u2019t believe it, all you had to do was find a cab, which will take\nyou to Auschwitz, which was about two hours\u2019 drive from there.",
        "Q: Were people going and visiting Auschwitz then?",

        "A: That was \u2014",
        "Q: Which was in \u00b045?",
        "A: In \u201945. It was \u2014 it was a frightening experience, but by then we couldn\u2019t say that\nwe didn\u2019t know about it, because by then \u2014 by then they had many trials of Nazis\nwho were caught, you know, and \u2014 and the trials very often were translated into\nradio. So could you \u2014 you could hear it.",
        "Q: Did you go with your family when you went to Auschwitz, did you go with other\nkids, what \u2014",
        "A: No, I went with other kids.",

        "Q: And so you decided you would \u2014 you would join them?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So \u2014 so this was a \u2014 a kind of private decision.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "Q: So tell me what that was like, for you to walk through this. Did \u2014 was \u2014 was there\na \u2014a kind of tour, was there anybody guiding you, or you just walk through?",

        "Q: And what was it like then? In \u201945? That\u2019s much earlier than most people ever saw\nit.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct. Well, you knew that you were where the horrible things were\nhappening. And this was in this barrack, and the other thing was in another barrack.\nAnd it was difficult to believe then that time would come, and there would be people\ndeno \u2014 denying the Holocaust all together.",
        "Q: Right. So you \u2014 when you went back to Krakow, did you then tell your parents\nwhat you saw\u201d?",

        "Q: Uh-huh. And did they go because you had gone, you think?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. And when they came back, did you then discuss it with them?",
        "A: There was nothing to discuss.",

        "A: Within a few weeks.",
        "Q: Of coming to Krakow.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And did \u2014 did Aaron find you in Krakow?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how did he do that? I mean, how come he went to \u2014 was Krakow a place\nthat a lot of people went after Lvov?",
        "A: Yes. But also \u2014 but also, Krakow was the place where you could get information\nabout other people who got back and where did they go. You know, for example\nthere were a few people who were directly to the former German cities in Silesia, but\nyou would find out about them in Krakow, and they would know who went where.\nYou had, in Krakow, unlike in the Soviet Union, you immediately had Jewish\norganizations, and those organizations would try to provide as much information as\nAugust 12, 2009\npossible, about the whereabouts of survivors, or liquidations of earlier ghettoes,\nwhen and where and how, and so forth, which you did not have in Russian occupied\nPoland.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: In Krakow, you had a functioning synagogues.",
        "Q: So did they \u2014 did they have lists up on walls \u2014",
        "A: Lots of them. But, you know, people would look at those lists and also append\ntheir own queries about the whereabouts of their families, and who went where, and\nwho is likely to have been in this or in that ghetto, or who 1s likely to have\ninformation about the fate of individual persons.",
        "Q: You s \u2014 you spoke about anti-Semitism in \u2014 in Zambor(ph).",
        "A: Right, in Jambol.",
        "Q: Jambol rather, in Kazakhstan. When you came back to Poland, was there also a\nlot of anti-Semitism?",
        "A: Oh yes. Quite a lot.",
        "Q: And how did that manifest itself for you?",
        "A: Well, there would be Jews who were taken off trains and killed on the spot in po\n\u2014in 1945 \u2014 \u201946 in Poland. There were Jews who were warned not to come to this\nplace or to that place because they\u2019 Il \u2014 they\u2019ll be murdered, and quite a few were.\nAugust 12, 2009\nBut it was \u2014 it was not very different from anti-Semitism that you might have before\nthe war.",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t necessarily worse than it was after the Nazis.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It was the s \u2014 it was the same kind of \u2014",
        "A: It was the same kind, except that \u2014 except that the 1945, the postwar anti-\nSemitism was made more acceptable because the war taught the Poles that to \u2014 that\nyou may kill Jews with impunity.",
        "Q: You\u2019re now 16 at the end of the war, right?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: When you go back to Krakow, do you go to school?",
        "A: Yes, I did. I went to one school in particular, which before the war was about\none-third Jewish. After the war there were t-two of us 1n that school who were\nJewish.",
        "Q: Was there any sympathy at all \u2014",
        "A: No, none.",
        "Q: None, about what had happened?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And do you explain that because everybody was suffering from the war itself, or\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: How \u2014",
        "A: No, I think that it was so because by then the propaganda of the anti-Soviet\ngroups spread the word that the new pro-Soviet government is really a Jewish\ngovernment.",
        "Q: And why do you think they did that?",
        "A: To undermine that government.",
        "Q: So it was an easy way to undermine the government by saying it was Jewish?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did you have a weapon that you carried around with you at that ti \u2014 at\nthat point?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, I did, because the police would occasionally close its eyes to the fact\nthat the Jews had weapons, because they could not provide them with protection 24\nhours a day. So they would say, if you have a gun, we will not kill you for it. You\nknow, and \u2014 and you could find guns all over the place.",
        "Q: You could?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Is that how you got a gun, you fi \u2014 you found it?",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "Q: And was this a small pistol, or what?\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: No, it was a normal pistol.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And you carried it in your pocket?",
        "A: I carried it under my belt.",
        "Q: And did you go to school with this weapon?",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: And the teacher didn\u2019t say anything and the students didn\u2019t say anything.",
        "A: Nobody said anything.",
        "Q: Were they frightened of you, you think?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: And where did you get bullets?",
        "A: Again, you could find them on the black market.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you \u2014 did your parents know that you had the gun?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And th-th-they were fine with this?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did they have one as well?",
        "A: No. But that\u2019s the place where the pogroms began. You know, there was one\npogrom that never took place, because we were told that there would be one. And so\nAugust 12, 2009\nwe organized a defense organization. And I remember that before Passover 1946, I\nwent out of the house where the Jews lived, and I saw a carton with something in it.\nSo I walked over to it to see what it is. And I saw a newborn child cut into little\npieces in that car-carton. And I took the carton away with a couple of other kids, and\nwe hid it. And within minutes, there was a large group of local people looking for\nsomething. They were obviously looking for that carton, but finding none, they went\nback and disappeared. And this was the \u2014 the pogrom that never was realized in\nKrakow. But an-another gos \u2014 pogrom in Kielce did take place, and there were\nabout 70 or 80 Jews who were killed in that pogrom. And there \u2014 there was \u2014 and\nthat \u2014 there was a press conference in the \u2014 with \u2014 with the \u2014 with the archbishop of\nKrakow, and I went to that press conference and I heard one journalist ask, is it true\nthat the Jews use Christian blood to make matzoh? And his eminence thought for a\nminute and he replied, I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: I really don\u2019t know?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Was \u2014 was the fear of pogroms what made you and your family leave \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 Poland all together?",
        "A: Yes, yes. The fear of pogroms, and the fear that Poland is going to be a Soviet\nState.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "Q: And why did the second thing frighten you, do you think?",
        "A: Because we didn\u2019t want to be \u2014 to live in a country that would be like Jambol.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And was this discussed with your parents, or did they just \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 say we\u2019re going?",
        "A: They said we are going, they said, we don\u2019t want to be the last Jews alive in\nPoland.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Was it easy to leave?",
        "A: Yes, because the Polish government wanted the Jews out, because they were a se\n\u2014a security drain, and also because they knew that the Jews will be an excuse for\nanti-Soviet, anti-communist activity.",
        "Q: What do you mean that the Jews were a security drain, what does that mean?",
        "A: That they would have to assign so many policemen to protect the places where\nthe Jews lived.",
        "Q: So they were not unhappy that the Jews wanted to leave.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Did most Jews leave, you think?",
        "A: I would say yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: This is where the refugee camps began to be organized in the American zone of\noccupation in Germany.",

        "A: No, we went to France.",
        "Q: And how did that happen?",
        "A: Somebody told us that if you go to France, you\u2019ll find it easier to go to America,\nif you have relatives in America.",
        "Q: So in 1946 you go to Paris?",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: And 1s that in \u2014 in the summer, or in \u2014 in the end of March or something, do you\nknow?",

        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Because there were Jews from all over Europe, refugees, and Hungarian Jews\ndid not understand Polish, and neither did Romanian Jews. But the lingua franca for\nall of them was Yiddish.",

        "A: No, I think because of the first. But again, there was no clear line of demarcation\nbetween the two. And there were always rumors, you know, that within a week, they\nwill allow Jews to leave for, say Venezuela. Which they did.",

        "Q: Now when you get to Paris, do you very quickly try to get visas?",
        "A: We did, but that was of no avail, because visas were usual \u2014 usually given to\ncategories of people rather than individuals.",
        "Q: And what were the categories?",

        "A: Oh, yes. Lots of family, but again, there was no visible signs of depression on his\npart.

        "A: To preserve the historical record.",

And that\u2019s the way \u2014 and that\u2019s the way\nmy childhood is remembered in my mind. The business that my father ran was very\nmuch like the business that my maternal grandfather ran. It was a middle of the road,\nAugust 12, 2009\nnot very large, not very small, but old enough and large enough to provide them with\na livelihood, and that\u2019s the way I remember it, by September 1, 1939, which was the\nday when Nazi Germany attacked Poland.

And we were\njust \u2014 we were just pushed to the other side of the river, and then the Germans\nreturned to their side of the river, and we were on the other side for a few days, and\nit was not clear what those few days will bring, and where we will end up. I\nremember we stopped in this small Jewish town, and my mother wanted a place\nwhere she could wash me and my kid brother. And it turned out that the only place\nwhere you could get washed was the local mikveh, the religious bathhouse where \u2014\nwhere women would immerse themselves after their periods, to make themselves\nagain clean. And in that little town, it was a town with a single industry. The\nindustry was making twittel(ph) \u2014 making the phylacteries that observant Jews used\nfor prayers on their hands, on their arms and on their forehead. And then a few days\nlater we met my father, who was looking for us because the army, the Polish army\ndisintegrated, and the \u2014 there was absolutely nothing else for him to do. And there\nAugust 12, 2009\nwere people roaming around looking for deported relatives and friends. And that\u2019s\nhow \u2014 and that\u2019s how he found us.",
        "A: No. But he figured it out because that was the only relative that we had on that\nside of Poland. And so he went to Tarnopol, and so did we, and that\u2019s where we\nmet.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, right.",
        "A: Oh, there were a lot of people, but they were not terrible, because there were no\nshortages, and whoever lived in that area would try to share with us some food or\nwhatever else was available.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: Yes, yes. So would have \u2014 so you would have some laundry to change into.",
        "A: And I think an extra pair of shoes or something like this.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s sister lived in Tarnopol.",
        "A: So that\u2019s where we went.",
        "A: We stayed in their home for several months until the deportation to Russia.",
        "A: Just a few months.\nAugust 12, 2009",
        "A: And we left next spring, when the \u2014 the Russian authorities asked all the refugees\nwho came from the other side, who expressed their preference, the preferences being\nto remain a Soviet citizen and stay at Tarnopol, or to go back to the places from\nwhich they were ejected by the Nazis, which is what we chose to do, because that\u2019s\nwhere most of the family was, in Rzeszow, and some even in Jaroslaw, because not\nall of us were deported of the same day.",
        "A: We wanted to go back because we wanted to be together with the others.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct. And one night they appeared in my aunt\u2019s apartment, and they\nread our names and they said, you will have your wish carried out, and they took us\nto the railroad station, put us in cattle cars, and we were supposed to go to the other\nside of San river, but instead when the train began to move, it became obvious that\nwe were moving in the direction of east, rather than west, and east was Russia.",
        "A: It was okay. It was not very difficult because there was no \u2014 there was no strict\nrules about behavior or buying or selling food. So, you know, th-there were a few\nrules, which were not terribly strictly observed, until they put us in those cattle cars\nAugust 12, 2009\nand begun to move in the direction opposite to the one that we expected to be moved\nto.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He \u2014 he worked on behalf of the authorities examining state property to make\nsure that nothing would collapse, or burn down, or get stolen.

        "A: My brother was okay.",

        "A: No.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: The train was, oh about 15 or 20 car \u2014 cars filled with people, and locked. And\ninside you had a hole so you could pee in \u2014 in it. But other than that, again, there was\nnothing special, except that they distributed a little water to drink, and a little bread\nto eat.",
        "A: Yes, it was already, because we didn\u2019t know where we were \u2014 where we were\ngoing, and why we are being sent there, and what we have to do once we arrive.",

        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes, of course they were nervous, but so was everybody else.",
        "A: And the assumption was that whatever happens to the rest of us will happen to us,\nand we can do nothing to change it.",
        "A: The trip was about \u2014 the trip was about \u2014 close to two weeks.",
        "A: Yes, because very often we would arrive at a junction, and they would just leave\nus there for a day or two.",

        "A: I mean, I was there \u2014 I was there after the end of the Soviet regime. So we went to\nthe \u2014 the Yekaterinburg province, not too far from the large city of Tyumen, and\nwithin that, there was a lumber procurement barracks, and that\u2019s where I got \u2014 they\nleft us. They got us all together and they said, you\u2019Il be working here on\nprocurement of lumber for the needs of the Soviet state. And you better get it in your\nmind that if you work hard, we\u2019ll feed you. If you don\u2019t work hard, we won\u2019t feed\nyou, and then you\u2019|l starve to death and we\u2019ll bury you here, because there is plenty\nAugust 12, 2009\nof room for all of you, and that is the way it is with people who are trying to resist\nthe needs of the Soviet state.",

And as he was\nsaying his prayers, the KGB or NKVD or secret police commander came in, took\nout a watch from his pocket, and said there is no way you will get to work on time.\nSo we are going to send you to a different camp.

So I was in that school and so was my kid brother, and I\nremember I was worried about my kid brother getting us all into trouble, because he\ngot \u2014 he got a primer which had on page one, the portraits of Lenin\u2019s wife,\nKrupskaya.

Now the whites of my eyes turned\nAugust 12, 2009\npractically brown, because I did not have the kind of food or medication that you use\nto treat jaundice. And for entertainment I will go outside the barracks because a few\npeople there were to dig a grave for me. And so they would try and do it on the\nwarmer days. You know, they would start the fire, and then the soil that was under\nthe fire was warm enough for digging. Well, they never got around to burying me. I\nmanaged somehow to escape death, but the result of the jaundice is something that \u2014\nthat I had for years and years later, because the art \u2014 the jaundice that was not cured,\nresulted in problems with my \u2014 what is \u2014 what is the \u2014 wi-with-with ma \u2014 problems\nwith \u2014 with my li-liver, and th-the other thing which \u2014 gall bladder.

And \u2014 but I \u2014 but I was not going to\nobey this order, because there was an important thing for me to ascertain.

And so they told us to get the hell out of the camp. And since we\nwere all freezing in those camps, the decision that was made immediately was that\nwhatever it 1s, we shall try and escape Siberia, the Urals and go to a warmer\nclimate. And I remember somebody got a map, and on this map we circled those\ntowns where we wanted to go. And one of those towns was Jambol.

And of course, the locals, who could \u2014 who\ncould provide a place to sleep wanted to get paid in either gold or valuables that\ncould be exchanged. And so we found one place to sleep with a local Kazakh who\nhad \u2014 who was starving. And I remember he was starving, but so was his dog, and he\ndidn\u2019t have anything to give to the dog, and the dog ultimately died of hunger. And\nwe lived in an extra room that he had in his house, for a while. And the way \u2014 and\nthe way we lived is that my \u2014 my father would get somebody who would give him\nthings that you can exchange for food or \u2014 or other necessities. And I went to school.\nThere was a normal Russian school there, which was run by the Siberian railroad \u2014 s1\n\u2014 siber \u2014 Siberian \u2014 Si-Siberian Central Asian Railroad. And so I went to that school,\nand again I was starved. But you had to go to that school because there was nothing\nelse for me to do.
