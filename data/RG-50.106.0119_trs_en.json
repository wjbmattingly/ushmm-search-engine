And then\nwas rof \u2014 Rozka, Ruchcia, Sala, Tamara and Srulek and me, of course, and then\nJosek and Bluma.",
        "Q: What can you tell me about the day that you realized that you were no longer\nunder Nazi control?",
        "A: Well, actually, when I was in Theresienstadt, we were in a room, about 38\npeople, when they took us on the death march from Buchenwald. This was the\nsecond death march, the first one was from Kittlitztreben to Buchenwald. We\nwere there for about a week and then I \u2014 I went out with the last transport from\nAugust 5, 1999\nBuchenwald. I was hiding in the wall and sudden I heard shooting into the wall\ncause some other people came. I went out through a window, cut myself, and ran in\n\u2014 outside I shouldn\u2019t get shot and they were already a line \u2014 lined up, only Jewish\npeople. They only asked for Jewish people. And we walked to Weimar by foot,\nwhich it was full glass, probably a half a foot glass from bombing and everything.\nAnd then on cattle train, put us about hundred or 110, I don\u2019t know exactly, on the\ntrain. And people were dying every day, no food, no water, anything. And we threw\nout bodies. But we didn\u2019t have place where to sit or anything. When it got more\nroomy and more place, actually took some bodies to make ourselves pillows, and\nwe sat on them. And on the fourth day they stopped at the station, which they gave\nus a soup. And it was pure salt, this probably meant to kill us off, which I threw\naway right away [indecipherable] the other people don\u2019t eat it. And on the fifth day\nthey gave us some potatoes, they stopped at the station. And then came two Russian\nairplanes, and they started strafing the locomotive. Every five minutes the two came\nback. They were there for about a minute, strafing them. And on each side of the\ntrack were German soldiers also, and the aircraft, and other transports from the\nother camp. At that time when I ran down the train, from the train everybody ran,\nbecause we were afraid of the bullets from strafing. From another train came a boy\nfrom my city. He was a young \u2014 a young kid about 15 years old, and he was a Pole\nAugust 5, 1999\nin the camp, not as a Jewish guy. Says, come on, we\u2019ll be with the Polish people,\nnot as Jews, and you will survive better and we go there, and we have more food\nthere than you do. And I says no, I will [indecipherable] with the Jewish people, I\nam going to stay, you can join me. And we were there a whole night long in the\nfield laying around and the bombs were falling we saw from [indecipherable]\neverything red, on fire, with heavy bombing from the [indecipherable]. And this is\nthe last time I saw that boy, he went back. In fact, I think they killed the whole\ntransport there, and he got killed too, he didn\u2019t survive. They \u2014 several of us got\naway, but they killed them, because even soldiers, not only the SS, they were\nlooking for us, and we walked all the way til we came to Terezin. In Terezin we\nwere very hungry, dirty, and I don\u2019t have to tell you the lice and everything, they\nate us up alive. And we waited at Terezin all night long, they didn\u2019t have a place\nfor us. We slept on the stones there, I remember. Then we came the morning, they\ngave us hot coffee, bread, and some cheese. And right away they \u2014 we had to give\naway our clothing. We were washed and everything. They gave me two new shirts,\nclean white shirts. This 1s the first time I put on a shirt in four years. And nice\nclothing, and even a pajama, I was shocked. And we were in the Hamburg\ncaserna(ph). We were there for a couple days, and people were just dying in the\nroom, sick from typhus. And I was very scared to be with them. I knew \u2014 I saw\nAugust 5, 1999\nwhat\u2019s happening. And I jumped down a window, I don\u2019t know if I was sick at that\ntime or something, but something, I jumped out the window and I don\u2019t know how\nlong I was on the feet. But in the morning I \u2014 I have, in sleep like singing Czech\nsongs, partisan songs, and when I woke up there was a Russian soldier what woke\nme up. He stood with me. And they gave me some food. I went back to the \u2014 went\nback to the room there with some other people, we only left 16 people from over 30.\nAnd then I went out, I couldn\u2019t walk because I was only about around 80 pounds,\nnot any more. And after a day, the entire long day, a guy from our barrack, he was\nvery hefty, he must be the kapo or something, but a healthy guy, he smuggled\nhimself out from Terezin, because it was quarantine, they didn\u2019t let anybody out,\nthere were Czech soldiers staying outside the [indecipherable] because a lot of\nsickness was going, typhus. Th-Thousands of people died at that time. And he came\nwith the wagon, horse and wagon and on the wagon he had wine, cases and cases of\nwine. And the Portuguese sardines in golden labels, I remember like now. And he\nbrought in there thousands and thousands of hundred mark bills, which we didn\u2019t\nhave toilet tissue, was diarrhea a lot, and we put them on a hook, on nails, and we\nput them in \u2014 we didn\u2019t know that the money will ever be good for something, how\nwould we know? We didn\u2019t have any other paper. And all I ate is the sardines and\nthe \u2014 and the wine drank. And we didn\u2019t have bread or anything. And then they told\nAugust 5, 1999\nme to go to the doctor. When I went to the doctor and he says, what have you been\neating, that you not even hungry? First of all, my stomach shrank, we couldn\u2019t eat\nmuch. And he says, you\u2019re pretty lucky, because you could have died from the\nsardines. You are lucky that you drank a lot of wine. The wine, that saved your life.\nAnd they gave us food, right away they brought in food, the same food what the\narmy, the Soviet army took. And this was the biggest, biggest mistake, because th-\nthey came in with the field kitchen, and they have kraut with bacon in it, meat, and\npotatoes and everything so fat, and people were dying like flies from the food. Then\nI heard when you were liberated by the Americans, they didn\u2019t give you no food,\nvery little, because the stomach shrank, you couldn\u2019t eat anything. And that\u2019s the\nreason a lot of people they could survive, died from the food. And I was very\ncareful. When he told me you lucky that the wine \u2014 and when they gave such a\nfood, all I ate was a little piece meat, not much, and the potatoes. And a liquid. They\ngave milk, this I drank, and \u2014 for about a week. And then th \u2014 th-they burned\n[indecipherable] there because they were full with, you know, vermin and\neverything. And dead people were all around. And then \u2014",
        "Q: Did the doctor explain to you why sardines were dangerous and would have been\nharmful to you?\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t explain, he just said that you were lucky, but they tasted so good.\nYeah, and everybody ate them, and we drank a lot of wine. We didn\u2019t have anything\nto do, cause we were afraid to go to other barracks there. They weren\u2019t barracks, but\nthe other buildings, cause this was actually the ghetto, it wasn\u2019t barracks. And we\nafraid a lot \u2014 I met there some friends, they were sick, from my hometown also.\nAnd a lot of my friends passed away. And we saw there \u2014 there I met a girl from\nYugoslavia, she was on a bench sitting, I warmed myself in the sun, and then I met\nthe girl Truwik(ph) from our city, from Dabrowa, they have a store with leather\ngoods, the ver \u2014 very fine family and we talked about it. And then came the \u2014 they\ncame for her that she went to Sweden. She begged me to go with her to Sweden.\nAnd \u2014 cause they took young kids there. And I says no, I\u2019m gonna wait, maybe I\nfind somebody or something. And I saw there guards, huge guards, they took\nGermans, the SS and other people, cleaning away the dirts and everything, and we\nscreamed at them, we [indecipherable] but we couldn\u2019t do any other thing, and I\nwas sorry I didn\u2019t kill a couple of them. But there\u2019s nothing you could do.",
        "Q: When were you liberated?",
        "A: Well, let me tell you the story what was. From the Red Cross they came, ask my\nname, from which city I am, and the information that they took from me, went the\nsame, I think, on the radio in New York. All over Europe, every night between 10\nAugust 5, 1999\nand one in the morning, they \u2014 they called out names who survive, which camp\nwere they at, so on, so on. So my sister\u2019s husband, Klugman, the one that was the\nsecretary from [indecipherable] he heard on the radio I am alive. He was in\nBudapest at that time. He was with his son, he was in the underground, and \u2014 so\nwhen they heard me, he went alone, his son, they made up that they\u2019re gonna meet\nin Prague, and he came to Terezin. Of course, they wouldn\u2019t let nobody out at that\ntime, but he had his son\u2019s pass, and with this pass they let me out, and he was as a\ncorrespondent, because he had papers as a correspondent there. And he took me out\nfrom there, I had only one pair of pants, I took along another shirt what they gave\nme, and we walked a couple miles to Buchewice(ph) because there was no train at\nthat time.",
        "Q: When were you liberated? You know the date?",
        "A: I was \u2014 I was liberated, was around the sixth or seventh of \u2014 of May, or maybe\nearlier, I will never know the date exact, but appro \u2014 approximately this is the time.\nCause don\u2019t forget, I was out, I don\u2019t know how long I was out.",
        "Q: You said that they announced on the radio your name \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 in the camps. What camps were you in during the war?\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: Well, I was \u2014 first of all, of course in the ghetto. Then I was in one camp right\nafter they took my parents away, the Jewish community send me to Szcezakowa.\nThis was a leather factory, which we work, we were about 30 men there. And after\nit was Judenrein in all Upper Silesia and we got food from the Jewish community.\nThe Juden [indecipherable] send us food. And when was no more food, about two\nweeks after Judenrein, the SS came. Now, the SS came, they took us away from\nSzezakowa and we were the ones cleaning out the [indecipherable] in Sosnowiec,\nChancer(ph) was still there, he was the Juden-Elster(ph) from [indecipherable].\nAnd we went there, I remember all the sto \u2014 all with people were sleeping and\neverything. And one morning before [indecipherable] we came \u2014 we went to work,\ncame the SS man Ludwig. He was the head that they sent all the people to the\ncamps from Silesia and everybody was petrified scared of him because we knew\nwho he was. He sent my sister to the camp also, and everybody from our city. And\nhe ask if there is a painter. And I was doing painting in the ghetto during the war for\nthe Bauleitung. This is the building company that they send us to work. I was doing\nbricklaying and painting a lot and I learned the trade very good in the war, I was\nvery good, young, and I kept my mouth shut, because I was afraid. I was a young\nboy, short, and I\u2019m not going to tell him I\u2019m a mechanic, I\u2019m a painter, I was afraid\nof him. So one from my city that was with me [indecipherable] his name, said that\nAugust 5, 1999\nthe Rosen is a painter. So he came \u2014 he came over to me, bist du ein Maler?\nJawohl Oberscharfuehrer, he gave me right away in the face [indecipherable] he\nknocks me out, all the teeth. [speaks German here]. Why do you keep your mouth\nshut? Iam a painter, I said, I am a very good painter, very good. He puts me on the\nside. I didn\u2019t know what he was going to do with me. Everybody went to work and I\nstood there for about a half hour. Then came two SS men with him. He said, I got\nthree rooms to paint and I give you three days. And he took out his pistol, tapped\nme in my head. He said, if you are not finished in three days, you lived enough. So I\ntold him, I don\u2019t have no tools, I don\u2019t have no material. If you allow me to go to\nDabrowa where we live, I got some tools that I work in the ghetto and I can\n[indecipherable]. He says, you don\u2019t need anything, you get everything. So the \u2014\nthe two SS men took me, I walk with them through Sosnowiec, this was in\nSosnowiec and while you walking on the street, I noticed a Jewish girl. Blonde hair,\nbeautiful girl, I knew her. And she passed by so fast, and \u2014 and I looked away that I\ndidn\u2019t want to pay attention where that she should get caught or something. But she\nwalked by. Then we went into a hardware store.",
        "Q: I have to just check the equipment for one moment.",
        "A: Yeah. [tape break]",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re back, I\u2019m sorry.\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: Okay, after \u2014",
        "Q: You were telling me about the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 after I worked by \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 I asked you about the camps.",
        "A: Yeah, after I worked by him, and I was working there for about four weeks, so\nhe said, well, Maler, you are not going to Auschwitz, which I didn\u2019t know what\nAuschwitz meant at all. At that time we didn\u2019t know. And he said, but I send you to\na camp. And he brought me food every day. So I ask him, is 1t possible you send me\nto a camp where my sister 1s, I don\u2019t have nobody from my family, just a sister. He\nsays, where is she? I said, she is in Gruenberg, Lower Silesia. He says well, this is\na women\u2019s camp. And then he stood for a second [indecipherable] that you will go\nthere. But meanwhile you go to another camp, a transition, which I went to\nAnnaburg, and this was around October we went to Annaburg. There was no\nwork there, but the transition beating every day. And from there I was sent \u2014 only\nthree people went, Chancer(ph), which was the Juden-Elster from \u2014 from\nDulac(ph) and Sosnowiec, and Herta(ph) Goldfinger, which it was his sweetheart.\nShe was \u2014 she went over to Christianity, but still she was Jewish. They send her and\nshe became Juden-Eltesten(ph) for the women in the camp, and by myself. I came\nthere, it was about October in \u201943, and there were already some people there, men\nAugust 5, 1999\nthere, and I walked there in the [indecipherable] where they make\n[indecipherable] and the first [indecipherable] arrived, he let me in to see my\nsister, the Juden-Elster, because you got to go through the women\u2019s barrack, the\nwomen\u2019s hall and the men went with the [indecipherable] every day, and I went to\nsee her every day and I saw my sister every day in camp. And there we were til\nabout March 1944. The SS came for us because there was \u2014 the men couldn\u2019t be\nany more with the women, it became not a labor camp, forced labor camp, but a\nconcentration camp. And we were sent to Kittlitztreben. Was a subcamp from\nGross-Rosen. It was hell there because the \u2014 the barracks were still not heated, no\nwater, anything. And from there we were til February fifth. When the Russians\ncame near, we marched out on foot and this was the first death march, of which in\nprevious tape I told my story. And we arrived sometimes in April to Buchenwald.\nAnd Buchenwald was hell too, with all the dead people around everywhere and\nmountains of people, which I saw cannibalism for the first time. And on the heap of\nthe dead bodies were still some live people half dead, one of them was Meyer\nHysharik(ph). He was a German Jew, but they chased him out. He was in our city\nand I used to play [indecipherable] ping-pong with him in the Maccabee quarters.\nAnd he asked me, don\u2019t you recognize me? I am Meyer. He says I knew \u2014 but at\nthat time when I saw the other people cutting thing, and I start screaming at them.\nAugust 5, 1999\nSo they ran to me and I ran away. And then we heard that the American army came\nclose by and they start to taking out only Jewish people, they called for Jewish\npeople first, which was, I was hiding in the wall, I told the story. And then we went\nto Weimar by trains and this was the second death march to Theresienstadt.\nTheresienstadt I arrived toward the end of April, must be the 25\" or 26\". This is\nthe date. And I was liberated in May, either the sixth or the seventh.",
        "Q: When you were liberated, tell me, what did you look like, and what was the state\nof your health?",
        "A: Well, the state of my health wasn\u2019t bad, because all during \u2014 all during my being\nin camp, I kept myself clean as can be. This was the most important thing, not the\nfood as much, but not to run after food to get beaten over a \u2014 a pea, on the death\nmarch, on a stomped cigarette like people got out and got beaten bloody, that\u2019s how\nthey died. I kept away from this. I was with a couple people, friends from camp,\nfrom Gruenberg. We kept ourselves clean, neat, we shaved, everything. And I\nwould say I wasn\u2019t very hungry, but I wasn\u2019t sick, I didn\u2019t have no diarrhea like all\nthe other people. I was watching myself, I was sometimes with \u2014 two weeks without\nfood. But the will to live and the will to live is on the death march because I have\nthe pictures from my home. That\u2019s what kept me alive. Of tor \u2014 course I lost them\nthe last day in Buchenwald. And what I wanted to live is, I wanted to see,\nAugust 5, 1999\nparticularly some of my friends, and especially when I met a young girl in\nSosnowiec, and I was hoping I can meet her. That\u2019s was the will to live, to see my\nfamily and this, and that\u2019s what kept me alive. And I wasn't thinking about food\nnever, but just to take [indecipherable] I wanted to live. And that\u2019s, I think, that I\nlived through the war. And then, as I told you, my sister\u2019s husband came and took\nme out, and this was sometimes in May around, I would say around the 14 or the\n15\" of May. And we walked through [indecipherable] there was a train didn\u2019t go\nthis way, so we went the first time \u2014 day in hotel. And we had there a dinner. Of\ncourse, they didn\u2019t have meat, but nice potatoes with the soup, and this 1s the first\ntime that I ate like a person, with a tablecloth and with a real fork and s \u2014 and\nspoon. The first time that I cried, and I says it couldn't happen. And when I came to\nthe room, the bed was all white linens, I couldn\u2019t believe. And I took a shower\nthere, went to bed. And the next morning we got up early, and we waited for the\ntrain. On the train was no place, so we walked up on the roof from the train, my\nbrother-in-law, myself. We held onto each other, a lot of people were there. We\ncame to Prague. We came to Prague, the first thing when we got off the train, we\nsaw on the street in every corner was the kiosk with food, because a lot of people, a\nlot of people came out from the camps hungry. So every corner was a heart, a red\nheart and the ches \u2014 [indecipherable]. And you have sandwiches, donuts, milk,\nAugust 5, 1999\ncoffee, tea. And then they told us noontime we should go there and there, we get\nfood. So we had soups, and they gave us meat. They were so nice, that\u2019s\nunbelievable. I \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t think that anybody would be so nice,\nespecially to Jewish people, they know we Jewish. Then after \u2014 after being there\nabout two days in the hotel, was about two \u2014 about two or three in the morning,\nsuddenly I wake up it was such a thing, about a hundred Polish women came in to\nthe hotel to sleep. And they were offniks(ph), and [indecipherable] they were good\n\u2014 they were workers from the fields and everything. I don\u2019t think so they were from\ncamps. And they jumped out of my bunk of my bed. My [indecipherable] I jump\ndown, they grab me by the thing, and in Polish, rough language, where do you think\nyou go? You stay right here. But I \u2014 they threw my shirt, I jumped down, my\nbrother-in-law jumped down, right? Cause they were awful. They \u2014 they didn\u2019t have\nmen for a long time, this was their desire. And at that time I didn\u2019t think of women.\nSo I jumped down and went to the bathroom to wash up, and in the bathroom comes\na young \u2014 a young gentleman, was about 18 years and I think \u2014 he ask me if I can\nloan the cup he wants to wash his teeth. And I look at him a red hair \u2014 a redhead\nand the way how he spoke Polish, so I -- [indecipherable] do I ask, are you\nMonek(ph)? He jumped to me and kissed me. This was my brother-in-law\u2019s son\nfrom Warsaw. And I knew he\u2019s coming and when \u2014 when I saw a redhead. And so\nAugust 5, 1999\nwe [indecipherable] went back, and then I said okay, I want to go back to Poland\nand see if anybody\u2019s alive. My brother-in-law said, okay, I\u2019m here, we are going to\nmeet up. What happened, they gave me money, they gave me ticket from the Czech\npeople. I come to the train, the train arrive from Katowice. Train arrive, a lot of\nJews came out, guys. I ask them where you going? He says, we just came from\nthere. I told him I want to go to Poland, he says, are you crazy? He says, we just\nhad to give a couple bottles vodka to the Russian guards that they should let us out\nfrom there. You are not safe there. They kill people [indecipherable] people,\nnobody\u2019s safe. So I turn back and went to saw my brother. He says, I had enough,\nhe says, I don\u2019t like the Russians. They are not any better than \u2014 I says, but they\nliberated us. He says, I don\u2019t like the communists. We are going to go over to the\nAmerican side, because the Americans were occupying part of Czechoslovakia.\nAnd from there we have a chance to go to Palestine. That\u2019s was te \u2014 okay, we\npacked his son and myself and we went on the train and he told me, by the way,\nwhen the guards will come, the American guards or something, don\u2019t tell them you\nfrom Poland because they take you off and they go and ship you to Poland. Tell\nthem you a German Jew, and you going back to Germany. We wanted to go to\nGermany. Okay, when came to the border, the Russian guards went off, the\nAmerican [indecipherable] came in for passes. You know, passport because we\nAugust 5, 1999\ncrossed the border. Didn\u2019t have anything and he ask. As he ask where I\u2019m going I\ntell them I\u2019m from Germany, I\u2019m going back to Germany. So my nephew started\ntalking to him English, in a perfect English and the same thing my brother. So they\nask how do you know such a good English? In fact, they used to have a French\nmaid at home that she spoke to them only French and English instead of Polish, and\nhe knew very well. So they took them off from the train, who they are, and he says\nyou go, I find you. So I went by myself and arrived about 12 o\u2019clock at night in\nPilsner. When I got out from the station there were American soldiers sleeping on\nthe ground with their sleeping bags and blankets. It was cold. A May day at night is\nvery cold in Europe. And I was only dressed in a shirt and a pair of pants. So I lay\ndown between them, kept pulling the blanket. They kept pulling back and I kept\ntelling th \u2014 pull them to me. Finally I fell asleep, I don\u2019t know, when I woke up it\nwas about 11 in the morning. Nobody was there ex-except me on the cement. I got\nup hungry and cold. Where do I go? I go first to the police.",

        "A: \u2014camp and survive it, and I am from Poland, Polish. The first thing they told\nme, don\u2019t ever say you\u2019re Polish, because they hated the Poles, because in \u201938 when\nAugust 5, 1999\nthe German army entered Sudetenland, [indecipherable] the Poles went to\n[indecipherable], they occupied part of Czech Republic. And they hated the Poles.\nJust tell them you were Jewish from Poland, otherwise you won\u2019t get anything and\nthey are very angry, you might even get beaten up. They were angry at the Poles.\nAnd then he tole \u2014 he gave me five kroner, food, cigarettes. And he told me, if you\njoin the communist party, you get double money and everything double. So I\nthought, for being in the party, what can it hurt? I get double money, better\ntreatment \u2014 they would treat me better. He gave me right away to put on a thing that\nI belong to the communist party and he gave me right away 10 kroner, they put me\nup where to sleep at night. But the boy scouts \u2014 the boy scouts had a nice quarters,\nthey gave me food, I showered, cigarettes. And I ask, is there Jewish people, cause I\nwant to be with the Jewish people. No, there were no Jewish people they thought.\nSo I said, I\u2019m going to go further. I go further, another place, I went to the police \u2014\nall I went to the police there, I showed up, I told them I\u2019m from the communist\nparty, also a member, and they gave me food. Again, I ask them for Jewish people. I\ncame to a third town, I think 1t was Fawlen(ph) and so I ask them, they said yeah,\nthere\u2019s Jewish people, girls, in Starachowice in the hospital. And I couldn\u2019t wait til\n\u2014 to meet them. The first thing to meet Jewish girls. I came to Starachowice, and\nthis was mostly by foot going, all the bo \u2014 the scouts, they took me by Jeep. They\nAugust 5, 1999\nall time were nice, they took me from one city to other with their Jeeps. I came into\nthe hospital, they told me yeah, there\u2019s four Jewish girls. They wouldn\u2019t give me the\nname. They\u2019re all sick on typhus, you can\u2019t go in to see them. It\u2019s quarantine, they\nwouldn\u2019t give me no information. I was so angry, here are all the four girls, tell me\nwho they are, where they are. Can\u2019t do anything. Walking out from the hospital, and\nlooking around the buildings, somebody screamed in Polish, Moniek, Moniek, it\nwas [indecipherable] don\u2019t you recognize me? I am Bella(ph) Sigilla(ph). And she\nis from my city. And she was in Gruenberg, which I was with her in Gruenberg.\nSo I \u2014 we cried both, and I asked her, can you tell me about my sister Bluma? She\nwas with you in the camp, everything. So she said she was on the death march and\nshe escaped. She saw when she escaped, they were shooting at the head, but I don\u2019t\nknow if she fell dead or not, I can\u2019t tell you. But if you want to know more about it,\nth-the transport in Volvalla(ph), which it\u2019s in Volary, in the Sudetenland. There\nyou will find, because the rest of the transport are there, we are here, four girls sick\nfrom typhus. So, I picked some field flowers, you know, in the field, they were\ncoming out spring, I put a bouquet and I send it in to her, the flowers. And I walked\naway, I stopped there by people, they gave me food and I couldn\u2019t wait. I walked 12\nhours without interruption, just to see \u2014 to come with \u2014 with the ha \u2014 where the\nJewish girls are. It took me two days to go there by foot mostly. I came to\nAugust 5, 1999\nVallin(ph), I came to the police, can you tell me \u2014 I heard there are Jewish girls.\nThey took a policeman, he took me over [indecipherable] and he showed me this is\nthe hospital, go in. Okay. As I came into the hospital I opened the door. On the top\non the steps \u2014 were about 14 or 15 steps, girls t\u2014 a historical scream, Moniek, so\nhysterical. And happened to be the sister of my best friend Sheps(ph) Sheva(ph)\nSheps(ph). She jumped down all the steps and we both fell to the wall, she would\nhave killed me, both fell on the ground, and start screaming, right, that all the girls,\nthat they were able to walk, because don\u2019t forget, they were very sick, came down\nrunning and most of them I knew from camp, and most of them from my city also,\nbecause they took to Gruenberg, 450 Jewish girls sent to this camp, my sister\nincluded. And that Sheva(ph) told me right away that her sister died, we talked\nthere and I met all the other girls, she took me to the cemetery, showed me where\nher sister is buried, that she died two days after the liberation here, and some other\ngirls that I knew that they\u2019re buried there, with a little note there written about her\nsister. And there were 45 graves there. They were buried in the field next to the\nGentile cemetery, Catholic cemetery. They couldn\u2019t bury them because Jewish\npeople, so they were in the field buried, and with little sticks, you know, who they\nare, that\u2019s all. And I came there, was there a chaplain, a Jewish chaplain from the\narmy. His name was Jakov(ph) Katzman(ph), yes, and he gave me right away a\nAugust 5, 1999\njob, you are going to work. So, he says, since you don\u2019t know English, he spoke to\nme Yiddish, I have there in the hospital there \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a hospital, just sol \u2014 you\nknow, with a couple doctors for the army, army doctors. And to clean off there and\nhelp along, give him this and that. And he gave somebody a needle, and I fainted,\nbecause I saw blood. Here I was sleep on dead bodies, here I saw a little blood and I\nfainted. And then I stood there [indecipherable] he gave another one a needle,\ncause they gave inoculation, I faint again, so I went out. I told the chaplain I can\u2019t\nwork there, fainting all the time I see blood. So he gave me a job to the officers\u2019\nkitchen, which I help clean pots and pans, help in baking pies. And when I saw the\nmeats, what they cut away the fat, meat and everything, I says why, this the best,\nthey throw this away? The big cans that we filled them, filling from the pies they\nthrew away. I says, what are you doing, my God [indecipherable] food. And on the\nnext day I started stealing oranges. I saw, and I saw food, I put in my pants, I bind\naround for the girls \u2014 to bring to that hospital for the girls [indecipherable]. So as I\nwalked around [indecipherable] there, one of the officers come over, what do you\nhave there? So I was really, you know, scared and this, and don\u2019t be scared, what do\nyou have there? I said, it\u2019s not for me, you know I\u2019m not hungry, I eat here all the\nfood. It\u2019s for the sick girls in the hospital. Take this \u2014 everything out here. Come\nwith me. He took me on a Jeep, he took me to the American PX. He took a big\nAugust 5, 1999\nsack, he put in \u2014 what you like from here? He put in chocolate, he put in soap, he\nput in toothpicks. He took a \u2014 he says, don\u2019t you steal, you come to me every time.\nWe know girls, we know about them, we help them. Anytime come to me and I\ngive you plenty. And he gave me chocolates. And I have the nice experience,\nbecause on the third floor in the hospital was a very sick girl. And there were four\nsisters. They were the best friends of my sister in camp in Gruenberg. They were\nGerman girls. And they were with her, and I brought them chocolates and oranges\nevery day and more. But what\u2019s coincident \u2014 I want to interrupt, which it\u2019s going to\ncome later, that this is the Ebi(ph) sisters. She died late, late in September. When no\nmore girls were there they took us out from there, they couldn\u2019t \u2014 so they remained\nthere, and she died there, she is buried in the cemetery. And I gave a talk before\ngoing for the 50\" anniversary to Volary, with survivors from the hospital we came\nfor a gathering there. I gave a talk on the synagogue, and I gave a talk a \u2014 by the end\nof [indecipherable] I told them I\u2019m going to Volary for the 50\" anniversary, I\u2019m\ninvited by the mayor of the city since I was there in the hospital with those girls, I\nwas the only boy between 120 girls, and I am going back there. Suddenly I hear\nbursting out to cry, a young lady start to cry. So I walked over to her and I says,\nwhy are you crying? She says, my mother\u2019s sister died there. So \u2014 and she told me\nthe story, and she told me who were they and this and this and this, how old. So\nAugust 5, 1999\nwhen I came home, was 10:30 at night, I called up Suzanna Budzelis(ph), she\nworked with me in the archives in [indecipherable]. I said, Suzanna, can you tell\nme the names of the girls, if you have anything? Oh yeah, they were three sisters,\neverything, they \u2014 th-th \u2014 this and this \u2014 they \u2014 they [indecipherable] on this, and I\ncalled up 12 o\u2019clock this woman, she is the wife of a rabbi. I don\u2019t know, they were\nyounger. I says, look, they registered older to be safe, not to send them to the\ncrematorium but to a war. And we became good friends. But when I came back\nfrom Volary, I brought the pictures of the grave and I gave her the pictures. And\nthen she told me her aunt lives in New York, another aunt. So I took the number, I\ncalled her up. I says \u2014 I called up, she didn\u2019t remember anything. I says, so you\ndon\u2019t remember I came there? You were there? I was the only boy. I says, the only\nboy what was there, his name was Moniek. I told her Morris, that\u2019s why she\n[indecipherable]. And he brought me chocolate for \u2014 for us every day with\noranges, yes, that\u2019s me. And she burst out crying. And we became the best friends\nthat all the time she calls me, every holiday. Well, I\u2019m going to continue. We were\nthere for not too long, about eight weeks. A lot of the girls went back home, one of\nthe girls [indecipherable] we go back to Poland [indecipherable] which I liked it,\nI didn \u2014 no, I\u2019m going to stay. So one of the girls, Regina Chepelska(ph), she is\nfrom Sosnowiec, says Moniek, let\u2019s go somewhere, we all the time here, let\u2019s go\nAugust 5, 1999\nvisit other cities. Okay. We went on the train and we came to Zvolin(ph), a city.\nThe train wouldn\u2019t go no further because it was demolish, you know, the railroad\ntracks have a thing, stopped here and we had to walk. And this was about one\no\u2019clock in the morning. And we didn\u2019t know where to go. We asked somebody\nwhere can we go to sleep over, an hotel or something, and it was the motorman\nfrom the train. He had the bike, he ro \u2014 he took her \u2014 since she was a young girl we\ntold them we were brother and sister, cause we were afraid, we are from camp. He\ntook her on the bike, he walked with them, we walked for about five kilometers. We\narrived about \u2014 after two in the morning. He woke up a 80 year old mother, he woke\nup, make some fire and some food, they are from camp, they are hungry, you got to\ngive them food. We were shocked. So first of all she got up, made fire and put up\nfor a soup. And she made the heavy \u2014 where you wash clothing, you know, you\nlaundry. You put hot water in the laundry, wash yourself, yeah. We washed\nourselves, gave clean towels, everything. We sat down at the table with a tablecloth,\ngave us soup, and then she gave us a room with beds, we went to sleep. In the\nmorning he said he wanted to adopt. He was a bachelor and no kids, no nothing, he\nwanted to adopt her. And to \u2014 with me, he says, you are going to be here and he\ntook me right away, what do you know, what kind pro-professionally. I said, well, I\nwas painting at camp, in the ghetto. Good. He took me to a factory where they make\nAugust 5, 1999\ntoys and I painted toys, designs and everything what was outlined, painted in\ndifferent colors. I was there for three days and she \u2014 and he gave me a room in a\nhotel which \u2014 enough money to pay, I made enough money to pay, it wasn\u2019t too\nexpensive. And she was behind there, he wanted to adopt her. I says, Regina, I\u2019m\ngoing back somewhere, because I met someone, another Jewish guy there, we are\ngoing to go. Okay, we will meet up. So I said goodbye to her and I went back to\nVolary. She came back two days later. I asked the Rabbi Katzner(ph) to check, I\nsays, do me a favor. Can you find out about the Jewish girls, Bella(ph) Sigler(ph)\nand the others? I told [indecipherable] they are from this transport, they\n[indecipherable] in the hospital. He says, I go today. He came back a couple hours\nlater, all four died. All four girls died from typhus. And I was very sad about it. And\nthen my brother-in-law came, he found me. He says, I told you I\u2019m going to find\nyou. We were there for days, he went [indecipherable] you stay with them, I\u2019m\ngoing to Salzburg. Couple days later came a order that they have to leave the \u2014 that\nthe Russian army is going to take over Volary, and the Germa \u2014 and the American\narmy had to evacuate. So the army, the American army came with three trucks, they\ntook us by trucks to Salzburg. We arrived there because there was already men, the\nwomen separate to the Riedenburg caserna(ph), and the girls didn\u2019t want to even\nknow, Moniek is going to stay with us. He is to with us in the same \u2014 in the same\nAugust 5, 1999\nroom, slept there and everything. They made a curtain just for me to sleep. We\nwon\u2019t go in without Moniek. So I was there for two days with them and I says no,\nit\u2019s no use, I have to go where the men sleep, I can\u2019t be with you. But we became\nvery close. We \u2014 particularly we \u2014 about eight girls and me, which consider like\nbrother, sister. That\u2019s how we loved each other, not as boy - girl. You know, two of\nthem were from my city, one was an \u2014 one of the youngest girls, I won\u2019t mention\nthe name, you know, in case they don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t know if I should or not. I can\ntell the names, one was Rozia(ph) Szalinga(ph) from Tarnow, Lidi(ph)\nZilbigger(ph) from Auschwitz. Was Halinka(ph) Goldberg, she was from\nCzestochowa, [indecipherable] from Benzburg(ph), Halla(ph) Malnavitsa from\nDabrowa. Cheva(ph) Chet(ph) from Dabrowa [indecipherable] what the sister\ndied there, and my best \u2014 my best friend\u2019s sister, to our \u2014 we held ourself very close.\nAnd we were \u2014 then they transported over to New Palestine. We had the\n[indecipherable] we were in the DP camp New Palestine, Salzburg. And sudden\nthey ask me can they go, we are going for dances, they all time ask me can we go,\ncome along. So I went with them and we went to Ebensee and [indecipherable].\nThere were some survivors from other camps, from Mauthausen. So we went there\nbecause they have dances, I went there with them. We had a good time, we came\nback. As I came back, somebody told me, your brother\u2019s here. That I found my\nAugust 5, 1999\nyounger brother, Josef. He came from hunger \u2014 from Budapest. He was with\nanother guy from my city and woke him up during the night, I couldn\u2019t recognize\nhim, cause he was all kinds of skinny. He was blown up. [indecipherable] can be\nvery blown up from all the soups they ate [indecipherable] everything, you know,\nfrom camp. He was in Auschwitz and then Gintagruber(ph) and the death march.\nHe was liberated in fact, the 11\" of May, two days after the war. They found him\nthere with the SS wandering. And for over a thousand people there were only 14\nthat remained alive. My older brother, Srulek(ph) and him. And you can imagine\nhow happy and everything. Then about a week later came my best friend what I told\nyou the [indecipherable] he was in Bergen-Belsen, he came pi \u2014 to pick up his\nsister [indecipherable] he is alive. And I was there til \u201946. In \u201946 I had the \u2014 the \u2014\nmy sister, my older sister Ruchcia, which she escape to the Soviet Union from the\nghetto out. She\u2019s in Regensburg, so I went there to Regensburg, I saw her and I\nsaid, let\u2019s go move to Vidin(ph), I should go over there and come. So we\n[indecipherable] Salzburg, we smuggled ourselves to the border. And I forgot to\ntell you that in my room in Salzburg, I have three rooms, and I was with my\nbrother and another guy that worked in the kitchen, from the UNRRA kitchen that\nwe had the food in the camp. And every night I have guests in my room, which they\nprobably half [indecipherable] from Germany to smuggle them over to Italy and\nAugust 5, 1999\ngo to Palestine. And in fact I went with them twice to the border, to Ironing(ph),\nFrylass(ph) and [indecipherable], also over some of the people, so it was a\ntransition camp, because I went to sleep by my friends and I gave them the three\nrooms, food I had enough.",
        "Q: When were you in the DP camps?",
        "A: Was in \u201945 and \u201946. And came to Salzburg a young girl with a friend of hers\nfrom my city and she told me my sister is alive. That she know. Karla Lunda(ph),\nyeah. Well, you can imagine, I was there and she went away, she said she is going\nillegal, she is going with the bubbichar(ph) and we said goodbye, she left me a\npicture. About a week later I get a telegram from Poland, from a friend from my\nsister that they both escape together from the death march. Back to Gruenberg they\nwent, to German people they went. And their life, well, that\u2019s all I knew. This was\nthe telegram which I still have it, and I\u2019m going to give this to the museum. And\nwhen I heard my other sister is alive, so we packed ourself, went to \u2014 with a\ntransport to Ulin, to camp also a DP camp in Ulin(ph). And then we smuggled\nourself out from Ulin(ph) because we couldn\u2019t go anything without \u2014 from the\nUNRRA you know what they tell you where to go, this \u2014 and we came to\n[indecipherable] house where my sister was. And I met my sister, so we got a\nprivate room, we lived with my sister together. Her husband was the president from\nAugust 5, 1999\nthe Jewish community in Vidin(ph) and we have some volunteers in this museum,\nthey were also invited there. My friend from my city William Luxembourg, or\nHelen Luxembourg if you know. I know them, they were married there and we\nwere good friends there. And I was there for awhile, then my other sister that\nescaped what I knew she\u2019s alive. And what happened why we didn\u2019t see her before,\nwhen she ran away, she went with the Russian army to Russia to look for my older\nsister, she knew she escaped to Russia, looking for her [indecipherable]. And then\nshe went back to Danzig with her friend, and then she came \u2014 she came to\nVidin(ph) which I met her too. And \u2014",
        "Q: How did she know where to find you? How did you all know how to find each\nother?",
        "A: How \u2014 what happened \u2014 don\u2019t forget at that time, wherever you were in a camp,\na DP camp, or you met a friend, leave a note that I am alive. And people\n[indecipherable]. For instance, the girl, Karla Lunda(ph) [indecipherable]\nSalzburg, she got somebody in Poland let them know that I am in Salzburg. That\u2019s\nhow I got the telegram. And my older brother, he was in Prague, he went in fact to\npick up my youngest sister, Bluma from Poland, how, he didn\u2019t have anything, you\nknow how it was. And what I forgot to tell you, a very interesting story in Volary,\nwhich I go back. Very interesting. I didn\u2019t have no shoes, I still walk around in my\nAugust 5, 1999\nwooden shoes. [indecipherable] So one of the officers, while I walk in the officers\u2019\nkitchen, he looked at me, he says, hop into the Jeep, come with me Moniek. And \u2014\nwhere we going? You will see. We arrived in [indecipherable], he took me to the\nstation. He knew that the Czech people threw out all the Germans, the same thing\nlike they did to the Czechs, the Germans from the Sudetenland threw out the\nCzechs, now they threw out the Germans, and they let them have 10 kilo in their\nbags, that\u2019s all they were allowed to take. So we saw there a lot of people with\nboots and everything. He goes over to one, a ex-German officer, maybe it was an\nSS man, take off your boots. Put them on Moniek. About on the fifth person, they\nfit good. He took my wooden shoes, gave them. You took away more from him. He\nwore this for many years, now you can wear them. Then he took away the camera\nfrom him, with film. He says, you took away more from him than a camera. And\nwith this camera I took pictures in the hospital with the girls there. I took about 80\npictures, I have so much film. And the historical pictures from the girls laying in the\nhospital, the girls [indecipherable] which they \u2014 now you can see them in the\nmuseum, which I gave a whole book fr \u2014 just from Volary with my friends being in\nbed sick, they are now there, these historical pictures. That\u2019s what I forgot to tell\nyou. When we were in Salzburg, I forgot to tell you, I went to see the girls when\nthey went dancing there with their friend. And going to Barbishel(ph), we stopped\nAugust 5, 1999\nin Ebensee. And another triangle, which the trains divided, one train went to Linz,\none the directions that I have to go, and one to [indecipherable]. And when I stood\nthere, we went in there to the men\u2019s room, it was outside, they didn\u2019t have no, you\nknow, in the stations. As I walk out from there, in come there, stood at the train\ncomes a German policeman with me \u2014 with a invalid \u2014a POW, a German POW on\none foot. And he said, you took this man\u2019s vallit(ph), which is release papers, a\nPOW, money, everything. I says, are you crazy? Well, you just came out there from\nthe toilet, and he was there. And he wanted to take out everything from pocket and\nmy \u2014 my other friend were a big guy. He says, you are going to tell me what to do?\nDamn Nazi, he called him, and he wouldn\u2019t do it. So he called the MP. The MP,\ncome with us. He took us in a Jeep to the constable, you know. I come in there, was\na officer and a officer at the desk. Beautiful, tall guy, handsome as can be. Take out\neverything from the pockets. I took out from the pockets. Why do you have\nAmerican scrip? Are you on black market? I says, I work for the American army\nand they pay me with scrip and that\u2019s what I have. He took it away on the side.\nThen I have what an American soldier gave me, a Jewish soldier in Volary. This\nYankee division, the Y. He took this away. And he saw pictures that I\u2019m with the\nsoldiers, with the girls, the American soldiers, this he left me. I says, how come you\nhave so many coupons, for bread and this, you know, for ya \u2014 I says, it happened to\nAugust 5, 1999\nbe that I am with eight girls and I do the buying and I do everything for them, and\nthat\u2019s why I have so many coupons here. Didn\u2019t believe me. They took us away to a\nprison. We come into the prison on third floor, there are Nazis there. Locked up.\nWe started banging at the door, what it 1s. I says, we just came out from the Nazis\nand they put us like that. There were German guards there, by the way\n[indecipherable]. So they took us on the second floor, who was there? Prostitutes.\nStill better. Yeah, locked up. So, we had to sleep in the hall, they don\u2019t have no\nother place, and we were there three days. They \u2014 I gave them the information that I\nam in Salzburg, in New Palestine, gave them there everything information. They\ntook three days to find out who we are and if we are live there, if we tell the truth.\nThree days. After three days with the Jeep they come and they took us back to the \u2014\nto the station. There was my stuff he gives me back, but the scrip and the Yankee\ndivision [indecipherable] and he give us for the trouble two carton cigarettes. I\ntook the cigarettes, stepped them down and I spit in his face. I says, you damn Nazi,\nyou put me with the doxies in camp. Well, what he\u2019s going to do to me? And I spit\nin his face. And \u2014 but this was far to go to the station, wait, 1f somebody go. We\ndon\u2019t need your help, you worse than the Nazis \u2014 because it\u2019s after the war \u2014 and we\nwalked out. What that incident happen, that coming back from Barbishel(ph), I\nwalked into the same toilet. I said, let me look. Maybe he lost that son-of-a-gun\nAugust 5, 1999\nthere. And there was a big stall where you stepped on it \u2014 you sit on it \u2014 to \u2014 you\nknow \u2014 and I see something sticking out, and it was his portfolio under the stall, he\nlost it. I threw it and I didn\u2019t even look anything, I threw it into the toilet right away.\nBut what\u2019s interesting, that was the first high holidays, Rosh Hashonah in\nSalzburg. And they \u2014 they took in the [indecipherable] where they have the\n[indecipherable] there for the American soldiers, the Rainbow division what they\ncalled it. They had services for the high holidays. So displaced persons came for the\nhigh holidays for the first time. I sit down there \u2014 I came with one of the girls, and\nsit down and I look at that beautiful dressed \u2014 that son-of-a-gun that send me to the\nprison, to the Nazis, that was behind the desk. And I looked up at him, you Nazi,\nyou in the synagogue? And I looked at him, and I walked away and went all the\nway to the back. He look at me, and I walked over again. You get out from the\nsynagogue, you Nazi. He \u2014 he didn't answer anything. They weren\u2019t nice. That\u2019s\nthat \u2014 that\u2019s what hurts still today, that 1t hurts. And he didn\u2019t know what to answer.\nHe probably did his duties, but he should at \u2014 understand better, with Jewish\nprisoners where he sent, and took three days to found. Well, anyway, I was in\nVidin(ph). Then \u2014 then was transports there and there came a gentleman by the\nname of Haskell(ph) Gansfy(ph), and he came from camp to camp, DP cam-camp,\nto take people [indecipherable] to go to Palestine, to fight for Israel, to go to\nAugust 5, 1999\nPalestine with, you know, wi-with the underground and you\u2019re going to be in\nPalestine. So my youngest sister went. And it happened that she went on the\nExodus. She went with friends and friend she met \u2014 the same person Yehaskel(ph)\nBenzef(ph), wi \u2014 they got on board and they were on the Exodus, when \u2014 she told\nme stories, they came to Palestine, they had to go back. When she came back she\nwas first in Aachen, and from Aachen she came back to Vidin(ph), naked\n[indecipherable] because when he left we bought her clothing, everything, she only\nhad one dress, that\u2019s all. We had to buy her everything new again, and she was there\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nAugust 5, 1999\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: \u2014 uation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Morris Rosen. This is tape two, side A, and you were telling me\nabout your sister who had been on the Exodus \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and who\u2019d been returned.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Please continue.",
        "A: And then she had to go back because they \u2014 she got a note that she got to come\nback because there was hope that they\u2019re gonna go to Palestine, evident, so we\nbought her new clothing, everything and she went back and in fact they went \u2014 they\nwere the first ones, because from the Exodus people had priority even from\nCyprus, that they went first. And she met her husband there on the ship, which they\ngot married, they went to Palestine, and of course he went right away to war there\nwhen he arrived, cause he was a officer in the Russian army. And then my o \u2014 when\nIsrael became a state, my other sister, Mrs. Beilauer(ph) which [indecipherable]\nname was, and he left Vidin(ph), he was the president from the Jewish community,\nhe left Vidin(ph) and I have pictures of course, how with flowers the whole\ncommunity there send her off, and they went to Israel. And then I heard news that a\nAugust 5, 1999\ngood friend of mine lived with me in Vidin(ph), he was Shlamik(ph) Merin(ph)\nfrom Benzburg(ph) [indecipherable] that when he went illegal to Palestine\nthrough Marseilles, and he \u2014 he got off the ship, in the first [indecipherable] he\ndidn\u2019t even see anything of Israel that he got killed. They send him toward\nJerusalem, he didn\u2019t even see his \u2014 anything. And I still have the death\nannouncement from the paper, from the Jewish paper, I still have it at home. And so\nwe supposed to go also to Israel, Palestine. So my brother said, look here, we lived\nthrough a war. We lost so much from our family. We have two aunts in New York,\nmy father\u2019s sisters. If we go to Palestine, we can\u2019t go to America later. If we in\nAmerica we can all time go \u2014 time go to Israel. So we decided we are going to go\nwait out, and we got affidavits from my aunts, and with the help from the HIAS, we\ncame to Bremen, it was October, this was two days before Rosh Hashonah. We\ncame to New York, and what happened, we have to get inoculation against all kind\ndiseases, everything. And since I was all the time fainting from the needle and\neverything, all in my possession I have this 50 dollar, that\u2019s all what I have. I gave\nthe nurse in Bremen the 50 dollar, please mark that everything is there, I was\npetrified for the needle. She took it, wrote everything down, I took all the needles,\neverything.",
        "Q: Before I have you leaving Europe \u2014\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 can you tell me for a few moments \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 what were the conditions like in the DP camp? Tell me about life in the DP\ncamp.",
        "A: Life in the DP camps, it wasn\u2019t bad. It depends where you were. For instance,\nNew Palestine. We were very close-knit from the camp. We \u2014 we knew each other,\nwe went out dan \u2014 that we had dances there, and pa \u2014 especially I went to \u2014 in\nSalzburg, I went to every new show, any new operetta. What happened, you\ncouldn\u2019t get tickets there, they were very hard. But, if you bribe the cashier, you\nhave it. I bought her soap, I bought a stocking, which I got from the UNRRA. Soap,\nI gave her. So from the soap, other things, I got tickets. Every time when a new\nshow came, I had several tickets, as many as I want. And at the \u2014 almost every day I\nwent out somewhere, cause in camp, there was a lot to do [indecipherable] but I\nhad to go out, I liked to go out and what I missed out right during the war as a\nyoungster, I want to catch up. And I met several girls there, which of course one\nwanted to get married, but I said not in the DP. And I wouldn\u2019t do it, I \u2014 I not going\nto have a handout from the UNRRA. This was a Hungarian girl from Budapest.\nVery beautiful, intelligent girl. Anyway, she went to Palestine, she oh \u2014 from the\nAugust 5, 1999\nship she send me [indecipherable] even a letter, which I still have it, with the other\nthings. But she went to Palestine, I came to United States.",
        "Q: What kinds of things did the survivors talk about in the DP camps?",
        "A: Well, most of them about parents, about what they went through, everybody\n[indecipherable] through. And we had the paper there that we gave out a lot, and a\nlot of people wrote articles also. And th \u2014 we liked to make out for the lost time.\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s about it. What I tried \u2014 what I forgot to mention, right after the\nliberation, this was the worst time in my life, right after the liberation, cause during\nbeing in the camps, all what I thought is how to survive. Always I was thinking is\nonly to survive, and we didn\u2019t think anything about back home or anything. You\ndidn\u2019t have time to think. But after the liberation, then came back, where do I go? I\ndon\u2019t see my parents. This one\u2019s missing, that one\u2019s missing. Then I realize, I\nbecame again a person, with my mind and this was the worst time, and I was very,\nvery nervous. And even when I came to the United States, for the first three years,\nall I did is taking pills and pills and pills til one doctor told me, you want to live?\nPut away the pills. You can do without them. Then I made up my mind and I\nstopped taking the pills, and I \u2014 and I start living a normal life. But this was in the\nUnited States.",
        "Q: I\u2019m curious as to what kinds of pills. What kinds of pills?\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: I forgot. This was in the 50\u2019s. What was it for nerves, the pills that they gave?",
        "Q: Some kind of sedative?",
        "A: Sedative. But what got me that the doctor even charged me for every pill. He had\nit as samples and he charged me 10 cents for each pill.",
        "Q: When did you first come to realize the full extent of the genocide?",
        "A: Well, I knew in camp already what happened to my parents. In camp, because a\ntransport in \u00b044 came from Auschwitz to our camp, and it was a \u2014 and it was one\nfrom our city [indecipherable] Levenstein(ph). And he says, oh your father\u2019s alive\nbecause they have it good in Auschwitz, because they were in [indecipherable]\nand because they had a little bit more food, yeah. And for him it was good, but the\nparents, they\u2019re not alive, and he told me about the burning and everything and the\nextermination. So I knew already this, I knew everything. But we didn't know to\nwhat extent. I couldn\u2019t believe at that time to what extent, because here, okay, there\nwere killings in the camp and everything, but we didn't see, in our camp was no\nburn or extermination, anything, it just that people died from hunger and from\nbeating. And I was very good at that. I never got the beating, only once, because I\nwas short and I never stood in front in the lines, all the time the middle, and all ki \u2014\npicked tall guys that they should be in front of me. When they hit I was all time\nAugust 5, 1999\nbend down and I n \u2014 I never got hit. I was selfish. But everybody looked to survive,\nthat\u2019s what it was.",
        "Q: Before you leave Europe, is there anything else about the years after the war,\nwhile you were still in Europe that you would like to \u2014 to cover, to talk about?",
        "Q: Well, about being in Europe, I just hated Europe, I wanted to get out from the\nbloody soil, especially from Germany. I wanted to get out, but we had to wait, we\ndidn\u2019t have where to go to Poland. We couldn\u2019t go back because a lot of killing\nwas going Poland. And then it wa \u2014 I was too much hurting, going back to the city\nthere, which I never wanted to go back. And then finally my time came, yes, what I\nwanted to know, right after the liberation, when my friend Moniek Sheps(ph) came\nto pick up his sister, Sheva(ph), which was in Varamoltso(ph), he told me that a\ngood friend of ours, Moniek Nifel(ph), that he is in Bergen-Belsen very, very sick.\nSo I left everything there and went by train, went to Bergen-Belsen. I found him\nstill alive. We talked, he cried, I am very sick. And of course this was under British\noccupation. Would he be under United States occupation, hundred percent he\nwould be alive. Under the British, didn\u2019t get medication, not the proper care,\nanything. And he expired there, unfortunately. And a lot of people there, if they\nwould be under the American occupation, they would do more. The British weren't\ninterested in anything to help out. That\u2019s what I wanted to mention about it. And\nAugust 5, 1999\nthey\u2019re known for it. And then what was going on, we marched there, we protested\na lot. I don\u2019t know if you remember with Belvin(ph), they didn\u2019t let the Jewish\npeople to Palestine, we protested, and we wrote in. I wrote a letter also to the\nUnited Nations, which I still have copies of it. Not [indecipherable] but then the\nExodus ship and everything, I think that\u2019s what helped Israel to become a nation.",
        "Q: Did you follow the Nuremberg trials while you were in Europe?",
        "A: Yes, because my brother-in-law, my sister\u2019s husband, he was a Jewish, the only\nJewish correspondent from the DP camps, in fact, and he covered all the\nNuremberg trials. I was there six times because he took \u2014 he was able to take along\nas guests two people. And I gave one to the museum and I still have one of the entry\ncards. And I saw everybody there. The sessions, I even have the numbers of the\nsessions there. Nuremberg was everything demolish except the building where the\ntr \u2014 the international tribunal was there, was standing. And in fact, I was \u2014 this year\nalso there, I went back to the [indecipherable] cause I exhibited Nuremberg my\nexhibit this year, and I went to the courthouse there. I took even pictures how it\nlooks now, I recognized the buildings right away when I came there.",
        "Q: You said you saw everybody there. What do you mean you saw everybody\nthere? Were you there for the main trial, or for the subsequent proceedings?\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: I went for the main trial. I saw Goering, Keitel, everybody and when I saw on\ntelevision the things I was looking if I can see my brother-in-law there, because he\nhad good connections with Redenko, which it was the Russian prosecutor. And he\ntried to listen to the American prosecutor there, in fact, we had breakfast with\nRedenko, which I am sorry I never took a picture, he was very good friend with\nhim, yes. And in fact, my brother-in-law was one of the first ones that wrote a book\nabout [indecipherable] like sheep to the slaughter, in the 50\u2019s. And he wrote a lot\nof articles in the Jewish papers and a lot of articles to the [indecipherable] that he\ncovered the \u2014 the trials. But he never got any money or anything, he never ask for\nmoney or anything. Yes, and \u2014 and now we want to know about me coming to\nUnited States.",
        "Q: Yeah, one more question still in \u2014 in Europe.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You said that you protested when you were in Europe. Can you tell me about\nthe movement in the DP camps for the partition of Palestine?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was going on, what was the politics of that.",
        "A: Well, the politics of that, that in every DP camps we screamed and we wrote\narticles, we send away to United Nations that we lost everybody, we live still on\nAugust 5, 1999\nthe bloody soil, that we can\u2019t walk on it to go back to Poland. We can\u2019t, they killing\nJews again. And we don\u2019t have no place to go. The only place we want is to have\nour own Jewish homeland, and that was that. I remember one act in Salzburg which\nI can never forget. There was two cousins, they survived the war, and one of them\nhad a carton of cigarettes with him. And the [indecipherable] policeman ask him\nwhat he have here. He didn\u2019t want to show him and he es \u2014 he ran away. As he ran\naway, he shot him dead. And at that time, all the DP camps, Linz, Ebensee, all\naround Austria, from Polking(ph), they wanted to come here and do something,\ndamage to Salzburg. And the [indecipherable] police, because it was a policeman\nthat shot him, and the MP, hide away. They covered every road leading to\nSalzburg, trucks or cars, because a lot of trucks came with DPs from Linz. There\nwere partisans a lot, that they used to be partisans. They came with hammers, they\ncame even with weapons, what everything, and we wanted to do something to\ndemolish Salzburg. And they knew about it. So when the funeral came, they\nshipped back the people, they didn\u2019t let him in [indecipherable] they didn\u2019t let\nthem, they stood at the train stations. They didn\u2019t let no \u2014 no DP person, no Jewish\nperson into Salzburg. And they covered the whole funeral march, we were\ncordoned off by the military police. We had to go in the middle of the road, they\ndidn\u2019t let nobody out. And we couldn\u2019t \u2014 we couldn\u2019t let out our anger to anything.\nAugust 5, 1999\nBut we came to the cemetery, there was one house, which it was the caretaker\u2019s, I\nthink, and we put the house to fire. Which, I have pictures from the funeral, they\u2019re\nhere in the museum, which I gave them. We attended the funeral, I will never forget\nthis. And that policeman, he ran away from Salzburg, cause we said we are going\nto kill all the police there. But, we couldn\u2019t do anything. There were the happenings,\nwhat was. I remember coming to Munich. In the Munich was a march, which I still\nhave the papers, which the Germans show what the Jews did there. They also\nstarting demonstrating and \u2014 and beating up some Germans and things. And \u2014\nbecause it was near Dachau, they wanted to march to Dachau, they didn\u2019t allow.\nBut I heard demonstrations in Munich from displaced person people, they came\nfrom all over. And I used to go from camp to camp if I can meet anything. That\u2019s\nwas the main thing. I went to Feldafing, I went to Landsberg, I went to\nErfort(ph), which I found in each camp some old friends, people from our city. I\nmet at this station in Frankfurt, a young girl, used to be friends with my sister, and\nshe gave me a picture, in fact, from her sister on it, and another one a neighbor and\nmy niece. And this picture was in the Red Cross, on the pamphlets advertising the\nRed Cross, the Holocaust [indecipherable] and I gave it also here to the museum.\nAnd that\u2019s the stories. Wherever I came, I met some people. And finally, when we\nhad the chance to go to the United States, I said I had enough. I don\u2019t want to see\nAugust 5, 1999\nany more Germany or anything and I would never go back. And came to the\nUnited States. When I came to the United States, the first thing 1s I went to my\naunts. They waited for me, we came with the [indecipherable] ship. And\neverybody got sick, seasick, throw up. I think I was the only one walking around\nlaughing, and I was the only one eating. When nobody could eat food, I was the\nonly one. I had with me two watches that I took along to have some. So one of the\ncrew people says, they going to arrest you, you can\u2019t have two watches. He just\nwanted one watch. He gave me 20 dollar, which the watch cost me over a hundred,\nand I had to give it up. But then I talk, I was foolish, I was just taken, it was too late.\nTwo days before we arrive to United States, what everybody got already well,\nwhen you should have see the screams in the morning on the ship. Everybody was\nlaying on the decks, on the floor, why did I come to die on the sea? Why couldn\u2019t\nwe die there in Europe? That\u2019s was the feeling of everybody. When everybody got\nwell, even my brother got well, I came with my brother together, I got start on\ngetting sick. So I didn\u2019t have a good arrival in New York. When came to New\nYork, my two aunts waited for me already with my brother. And I can never\nforgive them, they were so nice, too nice, they want to do something for us. We\ndidn\u2019t even go home, straight from the ship she went Fifth Avenue, bought for my\nbrother, myself, hats with silk shawls, with shirts. Wanted me to try on a suit, I was\nAugust 5, 1999\nsick like dog still. And I couldn\u2019t tell them anything, they wanted to be nice and we\ncame to the house, it was on the \u2014 prepared a big dinner. And right away, you are\ngonna be my children, you are not going to work any more in your life no more.\nYou are going to live with us, you don\u2019t have to put a finger in cold water, which I\ndidn\u2019t like it, I like to be independent. I stood there with my brother for two weeks.\nThen I went for one week to my nephew. What I forgot to tell you, my nephew, it\u2019s\nmy older sister\u2019s son, he was in Vienna, translator to General Clark, and then he\nwas translator for the American army in Vienna. In Vienna as you know, there\nwere all four, the Russians, the French, the English and the Americans. So every\nmorning they have all four on one she \u2014 if you saw on the newsreel something. And\nhe was the one, whenever they gave him orders what to do, where to go, he\ntranslated him in French, into English, into German. And I have a lot of pictures\nhim translating everything when they have the meetings, and he was the translator\nthere as a young boy. I mean, I was very proud of him. Once he came to Salzburg\nwith a young girl, she was only 14 years or 15 years old, Herta(ph) Weiss(ph). She\nwas in Stutthof in camp, in Riga in camp, which was written a book and the picture\nher father, that her father got shot there. It\u2019s a whole story, a separate story about\nher. And he came to me, introduced me that we are going to get married. I says,\nyou\u2019re crazy, he\u2019s a kid. Fell in love with her. He traced her all the way from\nAugust 5, 1999\nBudapest with her mother here. And he was \u2014 later on he found out through a\nfriend, a Russian major, he says, Tom \u2014 his name is also Moniek, after my\ngrandfather\u2019s name, but he changed his name. Tom, now, he says, you got to\nescape, because the Russians wanted to take you over to the Soviets. At that time\nthey caught, you know, a lot of people, special kind of people, and so right away he\nlet know his superiors, was during the night, it didn\u2019t take five minutes, they\ncordoned off the [indecipherable] where he lived, Jeeps with military and they\nbrought him over to Munich. From Munich him and his wife right away to the\nUnited States. And, went to United States, first job was \u2014 his first job was going\nfrom the army camp to army camp in the States, he got 50 dollar for each talk, then\nhe said, I got sick of these things and everything. He went to work for the HIAS,\nand then he wanted to go to the Columbia University. At that time, \u201947, they didn\u2019t\ntake many Jews to Columbia, and of course as a refugee, so he wrote a article in\nthe paper and the director from Columbia called him up. He \u2014 after talk with him,\nhe was accepted. He was accepted and he was accepted and for international law,\nand then si \u2014 going seven years. He made it in three years with scholarships and\nwhen I came to the States I stood with him, also for a week, which they were so\nnice to me, everything. And then I said I got to get away from New York, cause my\naunt said you are not going to work no more. Every day she tried to buy me thing\nAugust 5, 1999\nand everything, I want to be independent. And I have the older brother, which lived\nin Palestine, and he married a girl from Baltimore, that they came back when the\nwar broke out in \u201948, they have two sons. Since she was a United States citizen she\nwas scared. They burned \u2014 they burned their store in Jaffa, they were the only\nJewish people in Jaffa, the Jewish store, in back, and so I came to Baltimore.",
        "Q: When did you come to New York, and when did you come to Baltimore?",
        "A: I came to New York in September.",
        "Q: What year?",
        "A: And this was in \u201949. September 49, I came. And I remember I went \u2014 was Rosh\nHashanah time that I went for the first time to the synagogue, which I couldn\u2019t get\na ticket and then this, you know, but who cared if we stood and prayed outside the\nsynagogue? And then I came to Baltimore, was about six weeks later, I didn\u2019t want\nto stay any more there, although I could have gotten a job in New York and I was\nintroduced to someone in New York, I [indecipherable] about it. And I came, was\n\u2014 was around November 1949, I came to Baltimore.",
        "Q: When you came to this country, to New York and to Baltimore \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "Q: \u2014 I wanted to know what your first impressions of this country were, and I\nwanted to also know what impression you made on the Americans. So can you talk\nabout the different impressions?",
        "A: Yes. Well, first of all, my impression was tremendous. What I failed to tell you \u2014\nI told you that my aunt took me right away out to Fifth Avenue, and after dinner I\nwas So tired out I couldn\u2019t sleep for a month. She took us to Radio City Music Hall\nthe first evening. And I was so ashamed because I was afraid to fall asleep and\nevery minute I fell asleep, even at this beautiful show that I never saw such a big\ntheater, it made such impression on me, that\u2019s the one in the world, the Radio City\nMusic Hall. And here I had to sleep, and after that, after we walked out from there,\nhalf asleep so tired, she took us to Lindy\u2019s. And I couldn\u2019t eat because I felt more\nlike giving everything out, I was still sick. And after Lindy\u2019s, we finally came\nhome. And I brought with me, that I bought a set of dishes from [indecipherable]\nGerman dishes.

Well, we\ncame here, so I got right away a job, I took a job in painting, because I knew\npainting, which I got, by the way, 18 dollar a week. My brother couldn\u2019t get a job.\nHe called up Remington, says oh yeah, we need mechanics. When he came there,\nthey found out he is Jewish, oh no, we don\u2019t have anybody.

You see the shelves here? If something is missing, you see the\nAugust 5, 1999\nnumbers? We have parts, everything. We don\u2019t need [indecipherable]. It made him\nfeel like two cents. So he got 12 dollar a week for his work. He [indecipherable]\nup. And it was very often [indecipherable]. I cried every day, I wanted to go back.\nFirst of all, I didn\u2019t know nobody. Then when I had an apartment to get in, so s \u2014\nthere I work \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to stay by my brother, because the sister-in-law wasn\u2019t\nso well, she was an American, she had a different view and everything, and \u2014 and I\nsaw that I am not welcome, so I said, I want right away an apartment. So the first\napartment wen \u2014 my brother said, okay here, it\u2019s \u2014 we looked in the paper. It was a\nshoemaker\u2019s store, on the back of the store there was [indecipherable]. So I says, I\ndidn\u2019t come to the United States and live like this, worse than even a camp, near a\nshoemaker with the smell and everything. I went on my own and I found a room. I\nfound a nice room there and we moved in right away. This was Sunday morning,\nwe went right away to Reed\u2019s(ph) drugstore, we bought pots and pans. We went\nright away there to the grocery store, this was our cook meal the first day, on our\nown. The landlady was very nice, and Friday evening when she baked the cakes and\neverything, right away she brought in [indecipherable] which in the next morning\nit went to the garbage can. We were \u2014 I don\u2019t know, we were so that from\nsomebody\u2019s hands we didn't want to touch. It was foolish, but that\u2019s how we were,\nvery particular, that only on our own. And it was very, very tough on me. First of all\nAugust 5, 1999\nI had to go, I didn't know not a word of English. So I had to go to school, so I went\nto night school. After work nine, 10 hours a day, cause I wanted to get more hours\n[indecipherable]. Then my brother worked there, he only made 12 hours \u2014 12, I\nthink. After working for somebody, what happened that the men what we worked\ncouldn\u2019t mix the color for a person for a [indecipherable] that she wants a\nparticular color. And of course I knew colors very good and everything. So as he\nwent \u2014 as he went to get material \u2014 as he went to get material, I mix for her the\ncolor. Oh, that\u2019s exactly what I want. When he came back, she says, I want him to\ndo mixing the colors, everything. And she told me, why don\u2019t you go on your own?\nI says, I don\u2019t know nobody, I don\u2019t know the language or anything. She says, I\ngive you a customer. So I quit them and I got the customer on my own. From 18\ndollar, right away that she offered me 60. From 18 to 60 dollar, cause\n[indecipherable] a mechanic. So he says no. You didn\u2019t pay me right away, I don\u2019t\ndo it. And I walk myself up. Then I \u2014",
        "Q: I have to interrupt you, we have to change the tape.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: One moment.",
        "A: How many \u2014\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nAugust 5, 1999\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: \u2014 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview\nwith Morris Rosen. This is tape two, side B and you were telling me about the \u2014\nbasically branching now out on your own, professionally.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Then I went on my own to work, and I took my brother right away,\nwe're not going to work for 12 ah \u2014 12 dollar a week, you are going with me.\nWhatever is going to happen, is gonna happen. And it was very tough in the\nbeginning, with my English, although we went to school. And I decided I got to do\nsomething with me. First of all we wanted to get a grocery store. At that time almost\nevery survivor went into groceries, because they didn\u2019t have [indecipherable]. So\nwhile I was working, one of the nicest people was that person who was in charge of\nthe Exodus ship in Baltimore, Mr. Spierd(ph) which he\u2019s known. He was the one\nthat brought everything, and the ship was [indecipherable] right in Baltimore. And\nhis wife, she says no, you\u2019re too intelligent, you don\u2019t want to be a slave ina\ngrocery store. You\u2019re not married yet, you won\u2019t be able to find a girl. You don\u2019t\nwant to be shop. You go to school, continue and do what you\u2019re doing, never go to\na grocery. And I already had a lawyer and everything, we already got prepared to\nbuy this for everything, and I listened to her. Instead, I enlisted, I went to the\nMaryland Institute of Art, to the art school. I went seven years to the art school\nAugust 5, 1999\nfor interior design. I first graduated \u2014 honest, I was the only one in the ever class\never to get the medal, usually they give the medals for day school. I couldn\u2019t go day\nschool, I had to make a living. Worked during the day. I went post-graduate at\nseven years. Then the teacher told me, you have talent, I send you \u2014 which might\nnot cost you for scholarship, to New York. But what happened \u2014 and meanwhile I\ngot married already \u2014",
        "Q: How did you meet your wife?",
        "A: I met my wife at a blind date. And before I come to this, I want to tell you I was\nmiserable for the first year in the United States. I didn\u2019t know nobody. Baltimore\nwas like a little town. Every weekday \u2014 every Friday evening when I got my pay,\nwhen I had money, I ran to the train right away, and New York because I have a lot\nof friends. Baltimore was a little town. If you want to go out with somebody, you\nhave either to know them \u2014 you couldn\u2019t go to a dance like New York on your own,\nyou have to belong somewhere, wasn\u2019t as \u2014 even school, I was all the time called\nhere comes the greenhorn. I wasn\u2019t received not at all good. I went to the synagogue\non a Saturday, all the ti \u2014 oh, here\u2019s the greenhorn. I came for a sundae to a\ndrugstore [indecipherable] made fun because I didn\u2019t know so good English. So I\nlet them have it in German, and I said, it\u2019s miserable. They didn\u2019t treat the\nnewcomers at all good at that time. The American people were not at all\nAugust 5, 1999\n[indecipherable]. They \u2014 they treat us like third class, and I mean third class, that I\nwanted to go back to Europe. But, with the time I met my wife. I met her in \u201953, we\nwent for a year time. I met her already in \u201952. We went over a year time, and then\nMarch 31 we got married, to a Baltimorean girl, so was a little different. And I\nwork myself up, and I was looking for an apartment before, which it was very hard\nto get apartments because people thought we are going to have kids, they didn\u2019t\nwant [indecipherable]. And I worked there by a builder, na \u2014 and at that time, and I\nfinish a job early, so I went there to look for work for my own, to another builder.\nWhen I came in, he asked me what I am looking this house, [indecipherable] was\nthere a painting contract? And I couldn\u2019t say that I am looking for \u2014 for paint. So I\nsays, I am interested in a home buying. Okay. I ask him how much. It was 18 and a\nhalf thousand dollar home. And at that time thousand dollar, who had that kind of\nmoney [indecipherable]. Then I [indecipherable] suppose I don\u2019t finish this, and\nthis I will do on my own, not only my own painting, but finishing off a lot of the\nwalls and the bathrooms, knocked off this and this. He came down to about 15 and a\nhalf thousand dollar. Then I worked for this builder at that time, I did \u2014 for his\nprivate home, and I told him, he says, oh, he\u2019s a friend of mine, let me go. He came\nto him, he says, do something for him, and this and this. So he knocked it down\nanother 1500 dollar. So I said, instead of paying rent somewhere, looking for a\nAugust 5, 1999\nhouse, I gave a down payment. And I said, I am buying this home. On a Saturday I\ntook a ride, I took my future wife, I wasn\u2019t married then [indecipherable] who can\ndream [indecipherable] home. This was the first semi-detached homes in\nBaltimore, beautiful. I said, this 1s yours, this is a present, she couldn\u2019t believe.\nAnd I didn't have money for furniture, anything. And I had everything together with\nmy brother. One bankbook. It didn\u2019t matter what he makes, what a \u2014 I mean, when\nwe split up, when we went for our honeymoon to New York, when we came back, I\nonly had money for a bed and this. And of course she got some money from her\nparents, not much. And my brother, whatever we had money in the bank left, he\nbought a kitchen set, and he set up a bedroom, and we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t have any\nother furniture, but this came piece by piece. And unfortunately \u2014 or fortunately, I\nshould say, I have very expensive taste, which I Just wouldn\u2019t buy anything, I would\n\u2014 where I work, this was, I mean there lived the most richest people in \u2014 in\nMaryland, that\u2019s the customers I had. I was never listed in the phone book, I \u2014 this\nwas recommended [indecipherable] I was all the time three, four years lined up\nwith work before, I \u2014 and I didn't go everywhere, I just had a selected clientele.\nThen I wanted to go into interior design. Then I found out \u2014 that\u2019s what I graduated\nfrom \u2014 I didn\u2019t go to New York because I have already a home here. Got my wife\nhere, I couldn't \u2014 not start all over again. So, for interior design you got to have a lot\nAugust 5, 1999\nof money, you got to open a business, you got to have your own material, you got to\nhave a showcase, I just couldn\u2019t do. Then I was recommended to interior designer\nChambis(ph), which she was the most known in Baltimore, she told me okay, you\ncan. And I said no, I-I am a boss on my own, I\u2019m not going for somebody. So I\nwork myself up all alone, and you know, I hired a lot of men, and then I had my\nbuilder\u2019s work and I helped out decorating, which I got money for this too, but I\ncould never [indecipherable] for opening my own business for interior design. And\nI was happier with what I was doing and I was interested in my old hobby, this is\nphilately, stamps, which I started as a youngster six years old. I continued 1n the\nUnited States, this was by coincident. I went downtown Baltimore, I saw a stamp\nstore, it was something familiar to me, and I started again. And I came to join the\nclub in Baltimore, the philatelic club, which I was one of the first Jewish people to\njoin, because at that time there were only doctors and lawyers, only professionals,\nand I was actually the first one like to join with them. They liked me and I became\nright a member of the \u2014 there \u2014 the an \u2014 government of the \u2014 of the society. And I\nstarted also to put my collections together in topics to exhibit, and I was starting to\nget known internationally for my exhibit, my work. So \u2014",
        "Q: What exhibit? You need to explain.\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: This was philatelic exhibition, which I was specially interested in Olympics. I\nwas all the time following Olympic games in \u201936. This was the first Olympics that I\nfollowed. So, and every morning I went through the paper right away, who won\nthis. I followed everything, and I started collecting Olympic stamps at that time,\nwhich I \u2014 every penny I made in Europe, things, I \u2014 I bought stamps, and I was\nvery knowledgeable in it. And I have a good eye on good material to buy,\neverything. And I assembled one of the best collections, probably, on Olympic\nhistory. And I was invited to Europe, I think the first exhibit was in \u201974 in Israel \u2014\ninternationally the first, the other ones I exhibited mainly here, which I won a nice\nprize. Then I was exhibiting other places, in the navy too, I had invitation from the\nOlympic committee from Italy, to exhibit as an American guest in Rome. They had\n\u2014 they invited 16 people from around the world, the most known \u2014 most known\nphilatelists and Olympic committee members. First I declined, I don\u2019t have time my\nbusiness. In the philatelic [indecipherable] they told me, this is the biggest honors\nyou can have, and you are going to recline? They send you ticket. Then I \u2014 I send a\ntelegram, so right away they send a telegram back to go Philadelphia and go to\nWashington. I \u2014 from everywhere, tickets, special plane, and I had to take to the\nItalian embassy my collection, that goes by pouch, you know, which they took\nalong from the embassy, they took my collection there, and I was treated royally\nAugust 5, 1999\nthere. We were about 18 people there, every day special dinners, special things, go\nout. If I went to the synagogue on a s \u2014 on Saturday, I have a bus for a hundred\npeople going with me, with one person. Of course I took along a Polish guy\n[indecipherable] and a German guy, which they went with me, they wanted to see\nthe synagogue in Rome. And I was invited for the 95\" congress, which was the\nOlympic congress in \u2014 in Rome, and from then on I got very popular. Then I was\ninvited to most of the international shows, which I was judging also, I became an\napprentice judge first, and international. And I went to every Olympic, I was invited\nfree. They paid for my travel, they paid for my hotel, for the food. They gave me\npocket money. And I built up my collection through my knowledge, which was one\n\u2014 one of the greatest Olympic collections in the world. There were only a few \u2014\nvery few more in this [indecipherable] and I think I was the only in the United\nStates this. And then I was also interesting \u2014 in the 50\u2019s I saw a advertising in the\nGerman paper, \u201cThe Aufbau,\u201d about somebody has a [indecipherable] stamp from\nthe ghetto. I was very interesting and I bought a [indecipherable] the first was the\nBansburg(ph) ghetto. And I didn't even know it exists, this kind of material in the\n50\u2019s. And as I went from show to show, I ask [indecipherable] and this, and then I\nfound out that I can buy some material. And I started assembling a collection on\nghettos and especially on Holocaust. Which I assembled one of the largest private\nAugust 5, 1999\ncollection in the world, which I exhibited international, in [indecipherable]\nBulgaria, in Spain, in England, in Israel, which I [indecipherable] in\nJohannesburg. Last year I exhibited and \u2014 this year [indecipherable] in\nJohannesburg and Israel and I just came from Nuremberg, I exhibited there, I\ngave several lectures on the Holocaust, and mine collection is very well known, and\nI write a lot of articles on Holocaust material, and I give a lot of lectures on it. Now\nI have to put together a collection on concentration camps, and subcamps and\nforced labor camps, which I have about 8,000 pieces, but I don\u2019t have the time to\nput down. So far [indecipherable] on my ghetto collection, which I\u2019m very happy,\nand I give a lot of lectures. And in \u201991 \u2014 in \u201991, I had a phone call from the Jewish\ncouncil. They called me up that they starting to open up a Holocaust tracing center\nin Baltimore, which this is the first center in the United States all over, and\nBaltimore became the headquarters of it. They called me up, I says, I know,\nbecause they know me from exhibits all the time, the JCC, I exhibited in Baltimore\nthe city, whenever it\u2019s Yom HaShoah. Okay, I will go over there. They interviewed\nme there, it was not open yet, but they interviewed me, they locked the door, we\ndon\u2019t let you out. You know too much. You be very good for us. You know the\nlanguages and you translate [indecipherable]. Okay, since I retired from work, I\u2019m\ngoing to do something. So I started and I start to come every day there, then four\nAugust 5, 1999\ntimes a week. And then, when Gorbachev came to power, you know, they started\nto open up, you know, on there in the archives from the Holocaust, from\nAuschwitz, death books and everything. There was a young lady in Baltimore,\ncame to an idea, why don\u2019t we open up a center, we can find and something to do\nfor survivors, so on. And Washington [indecipherable] the main headquarter\n[indecipherable] was. And that\u2019s where I started out, I started out from the first day\non. Then, when they find anything, so one \u2014 one official that started working on the\nHolocaust before they opened up, he was \u2014 he let know that Red Cross that we have\nsome important material in Suitland, in the National Archives, that can be used for\nnames and so on for the Holocaust. So we had out about 12 people, twice a week,\nbefore they wanted everything twice a week. We had a driver from the Red Cross\nand took us to Suitland. After just two weeks, Haverford(ph) quit. He couldn\u2019t\ntake it, it was too much, you know, when they read the stories, and a lot of them\ncouldn\u2019t understand either, because you know, you have to know languages. I\ndecided \u2014 it was very tough on me because everything came back to me. I never\nwanted to talk about the Holocaust at home, never did. Never to nobody, I never\nmentioned, I never wanted to watch a picture of the Holocaust, anything to do with\nit. But here, everything came back on me. Horrible stories. And when I read there\nsome stories, what I thought I went through bad, then I said, I was in the luxurious\nAugust 5, 1999\nhotel, not in the camp. What people went through, especially \u2014 especially in hiding\nplace. And we remained only a few of them.",
        "Q: I need to interrupt you for one minute.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You \u2014 you reference Suitland. Can you please establish on tape what you are\ntalking about? What is Suitland?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Explain it.",
        "A: Yes. Suitland is the National Archives that\u2019s the fourth largest depository and\narchive from the war in the [indecipherable]. They were \u2014 people come from all\nover the world to look for archives and everything 1s there. If you want to see from\nthe Civil War, if you want to see about anything with the Indians, parts of lands,\nhow \u2014 everything\u2019s there. But particularly is what we were interested on war\nmaterial, they have in Suitland 33 tons, and I\u2019m talking tons of material on the\nsecond World War, what the American army confiscated from archives in\nGermany, Italy, Yugoslavia, France and Austria and Czechoslovakia. And we\nwere working, we had there \u2014 the main one from the Red Cross was Suzanne\nArtivelis(ph), which she is now head from the Christian society in Africa she\nworks. And we \u2014 several people. And we were interested in finding names. What\nAugust 5, 1999\nwe found in names, the names what we recorded, we put down \u2014 in every section\nwe put in, we put in pieces of paper and then once a month they came and they\ncopied this microfilming, which they gave to the Red Cross and then which it was\nsent to Germany, to Arlsen(ph), to the archives for the tracing, Holocaust tracing.\nIf somebody traced, you know, all the time, they sh \u2014 we knew names where they, if\nthey died there or not, but they had them, the names, they\u2019re there. And we found\nthat books which we recorded, over 400,000 names, which we gave to president\nfrom the Red Cross, Mrs. Dore(ph), it was on television, I think, I discovered a lot\nof things. But aside to looking for names on the \u2014 as a historian and from my\npersonal things, anything that concerned Judaism, or Jewish thing, important things,\nbecause people couldn\u2019t read, they just \u2014 th-the American people they didn\u2019t know\nlanguages, just names and they knew the names and they put in where to copy this.\nBut I looked through documents, and I had the sharp eye, I just ful \u2014 I knew right\naway, when I start taking a batch with documents right away, I knew right away\nwhat\u2019s there, what to look up. Whenever has to something with Jewish history, I\ncopied. I did more spend money there in copying \u2014 copying documents, which thing\n\u2014 they all are, what are you doing, what are you doing, that I am all tying up the wi\n\u2014 don\u2019t worry. I have my names everything, but besides that, I have assembled over\n10,000 Xerox copies from the museum, which a lot of it were not even declassified,\nAugust 5, 1999\nI declassified thousands and thousands of pieces there. And I came across material\nthat\u2019s not known to nowhere. Of course, I\u2019m go [indecipherable]. I \u2014 I have at\nhome that I recorded, over 500 pages of documents that came out from the\nAmerican embassy in Ankara, Turkey, which has to do with a Jewish question, a\nrequest from [indecipherable] from Palestine, and also from the United States\nwith a request to President Roosevelt to rescue 405 rabbis from Europe. In the\nbeginning, he said okay. This was in ninet \u2014 beginning \u00b041, which was already\nknown what\u2019s happening in Europe. Of course, he got in touch with Mr. Eden\nfrom England. So Eden, right away [indecipherable] anything, you are going to\ntry to rescue 405 Jews? All European Jews are going to come to you. We don\u2019t have\nships, we have a war going on. What do you need them for? Let\u2019s forget it. Well,\nanyway, it came \u2014 it came then, it came Karski also, 1t\u2019s know what he did here,\nwhat\u2019s happening, and the [indecipherable] day, I have names written down, who \u2014\nwho was the representative and everything. Even Steven Weiss was also connected\nwith it. So, he promise \u2014 he promised then, he said, where would [indecipherable]\nmeans money. Once they had to send 25,000 pounds, which they send it. 25 pow \u2014\nthousand pounds was a lot of money, it was over five dollar a pound at that time.\nThen another 15,000 pound. Finally they came up that they have to buy a ship.\nThere was a ship on the Black Sea, and they had permission from the Turkish\nAugust 5, 1999\ngovernment, when they come to Turkey, to the Black Sea, through Bulgaria, they\nwill let them in only for one night. Then they will go \u2014 go to Palestine. Palestine,\nthe British only allowed them one night to be in there to come to United States. But\nof c-course, delaying, delaying, you wi \u2014 everything \u2014 you know what happened\nwith the Holocaust, nobody\u2019s alive. What we have on record is about 35 rabbis that\nthey came out alive, which they escaped to the Soviet Union. And late in \u201944, when\nit was known there are no more Jews, finally Roosevelt gave in. They sent in \u2014 they\nsent in to all the friendly embassies in Europe, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, if\nsomebody would list the name of the rabbis and if somebody comes here, give him\nthe visa. So we have a undersecretary Long here, which he was a anti-Semite, and\nhe send \u2014 write the letters, before anything, I want to know who they are and what\nto know. I have all documents home.",
        "Q: Now, I\u2019m \u2014 I need you to clarify something that I\u2019m not \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 quite sure I understand. You said you made copies of these things from the\narchive \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and you said two things that I\u2014 I need you to clarify. One is that you\ndeclassified them, and I\u2019d \u2014\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 like you to explain that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And also you s \u2014 you said that these are now in the museum. What is \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable] the museum. [indecipherable] in the museum.",
        "Q: Okay, please clarify those two points.",
        "A: I will clarify. First of all, when we looked through, don\u2019t forget 33,000\ndocuments, a lot, 90 percent was not declassified yet because nobody came to those\ndocuments yet, which I discovered them for the first time. And when I wanted to\ncopy this, I can\u2019t copy this til they\u2019re now declassified. So I have to go to the head\nof the archives, he put in a stamp with a little note declassified the date, the day\nwith the year, everything, requested for declassification and then she put on a stamp\ndeclassified, and then I could Xerox that, yes. And I have at home at least 5,000\ndocuments which I declassified because nobody saw them before.",
        "Q: And what of your collection \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 1s now in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum?",
        "A: I would say about 60 percent, I have a lot of them, they\u2019re not. For instance, the\nnames of the rabbis. I have every name. I have from which synagogue they belong,\nAugust 5, 1999\nfrom which county. For instance, they have 105 rabbis from Lithuania, that\u2019s about\n198 rabbis exact from Poland. They have one rabbi from Estonia, from Latvia,\nfrom France, from Germany, from [indecipherable] all Europe. And this\ndocuments, I gave a talk on it which I\u2019m go \u2014 I \u2014 1n my book that I hope to write,\nthese documents are going to be shown, because a lot of them \u2014 I want to say this\n[indecipherable] some tape, but a lot of them are not declassified yet, which I have.\nSo, I\u2019m a little bit scared.",
        "Q: I have seen a few of the things that you have in your possession \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 that are not Xerox copies of documents.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: And they\u2019re not stamps.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Te \u2014 I would like you to \u2014 before I go back and find more about your personal\nlife, as long as we\u2019re on this I\u2019d like you tell me about your personal collection of\nhistorical artifacts.",
        "A: Yes, yeah, mine personal collection of historical artifacts, especially on the\nHolocaust. I acquired this through auctions, through dealers. Of course no \u2014 1-1n\nhere. And a lot of material, which I realize now, which I got information, was stolen\nAugust 5, 1999\nout from archives in Poland, especially from the Jewish \u2014 from the Jewish\nHistorical Society on the Litzmannstadt ghetto, which I didn\u2019t want to buy\nanything, but there I came to one particular item, which I said if I\u2019m not going to\nbuy, somebody is going to buy. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s never will go back to the museum\nanyway. And I know it was stolen out from the museum, but at that time, everybody\n\u2014 every Pole we had a hand in the museum, what does he think about Jewish things?\nThere were mostly Gentile people, and they stole them out, but loads of them,\nsuitcases, which they came to United States and they were auctioned off here, and I\nbought them and I have a lot of documents. I have documents from Hitler also. I\nhave documents from Himmler, signed by Himmler, other things. I bought this at\nthe auctions. I bought in Switzerland. In the 60 \u2014 I was pretty lucky, the original\ntelegram from the Crystal Night, when Crystal Night broke out, when Herschel\nGrynszpan shot vom Rath in the embassy, it was the f \u2014 one of the first telegrams\nthat came out from Paris, sent to Berlin, and it \u2014 it\u2019s a backstamp a picture of\nHerschel Grynszpan that they sent by wire, backstamp Scheidel(ph). Scheidel(ph)\nis like Reuter news, this is Scheidel(ph). It\u2019s the original telegram that\n[indecipherable] what they call him, you know, in German. Herschel Seibel\nGrynszpan, I ever \u2014 never knew that he had a middle name, nobody knew. His\nname is Seibel(ph), like the original telegram, which they have now a copy in the\nAugust 5, 1999\nmuseum. O-Of course it\u2019s gonna remain later on in the museum, but for time being\nI hold onto it, but I have copies in the museum. I have other documents. I have\ndocuments from SS even, things which were taken away by soldiers, which I got\nthem. Is one picture that I acquired even in Vidin(ph) from a friend of mine, which\nhe personally took away from a German soldier, how they cut the curls, the\nsidecurls from Jews with the beards, that I have it, all the other documents. And I\nworked for about seven years in Suitland in the archives, and then they went over\nto College Park and then I stopped, I didn\u2019t have time and I had a drive a day from\nthe Red Cross they supplied, and I did a lot of research there, plus my research that\nI know. And while I was working there, Bob Casting(ph), he should rest in peace,\none of the nicest, most knowledgeable guys probably that this institution ever had,\nhe worked in Suitland in the archives and a lot of times whatever I found, I gave it\nto him, to Bob. I was introduced, and \u2014 and then he asked me Morris, how about\ncoming over the museum, work for some. This was on a case that he had. So I did,\nand since then I\u2019m with the museum, working in the archives on a lot of things. And\nI wouldn\u2019t say that I enjoy these things, what I look, who I work on the microfilms,\non \u2014 which came out from Poland now in \u201955, the [indecipherable] they have,\nwhich I work already two years on it. And it\u2019s not pleasant you \u2014 when you read,\nbut somebody got to do it, and the people that they can translate, that we can do the\nAugust 5, 1999\nstories, if they\u2019re not going to do, who is going to do this later? There\u2019s Yiddish\nespecially. It\u2019s not a dying language, but yet very, very few people know. If it\u2019s\nprinted they know, but handwriting, if it\u2019s handwritten, which I took along a lot of\nthem, Xerox copies, maybe somebody can help me out, I have so much work. Even\nto the rabbinical college in \u2014 the college in Baltimore, the rabbi, no, they wouldn\u2019t\ndo it, 1t\u2019s too hard because it\u2019s fancy Yiddish and this, but I managed to do. And\nsomebody got to do, and I enjoy the people here to work with and I learn a lot\nthrough what I read, through \u2014 a person can never say he knows everything. It\u2019s \u2014\nit\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 believe me, I have a lot \u2014 a lot to learn to \u2014 to know. But, a lot of things\nthat I learned here, and it\u2019s good to know. I wrote many, many articles of this\nsubject, and \u2014 and I have a lot \u2014 in fact I have here an article that I just wrote about\nStutthof, the camps in Stutthof, with all archival work documents from my\ncollection, with letters from Stutthof and it\u2019s all there for future generations, and I\nhope to write a book, so for future generations, they can learn a lot about it.",
        "Q: Le-Let\u2019s pause and change tape.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nAugust 5, 1999\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: \u2014 Holocaust artifacts, and I-I\u2019m very curious to ask if you have any idea what the\nvalue of this collection is, historically and financially.",
        "A: Yeah, well, historical, it\u2019s very va-valuable. I have a lot of unique items in postal\nhistory. For instance, I have letters. A letter from Kaiser [indecipherable] which\nit\u2019s the only one known. From [indecipherable]. I have from some ghettoes that the\nghettoes were only a hundred Jews, not quite a hundred, I \u2014 from there. I have\nhistorical letters, which letters could get out from the ghettoes, the people couldn\u2019t\nget out. And everything was censored there, censored by the Jewish \u2014 by the Jewish\ncouncil has to be censored. If anything was written there, they were \u2014 they could be\npunished and even shot. But, you know, in the ghetto slang, which the Germans\ncouldn\u2019t understand right. For instance, I have a postcard from mine city, written\nfrom an aunt to a niece. And she writes, my liebers(ph) kin, this is mine last writing\nto you. We expect an Uncle Malchamovis, and I will have to go with them. The\nGermans thought Uncle Malchamovis is a name.",
        "Q: But \u2014",
        "A: But it\u2019s not. Then I \u2014",
        "Q: No, no, please explain.",
        "A: Yeah.\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "Q: What Malchamovis(ph) is.",
        "A: Uncle Malchamovis(ph) is a Hebrew name, the angel of death, so the Germans\nwouldn\u2019t understand what it is. But the person receiving this card knows Uncle\nMalchamovis what it is, and she knew where she is going. Other letters that I have\nin ghetto slang, that reveals the panic there, which in fact I\u2019m gonna write now a\narticle about postal history from the g-ghetto during the war, it reveals the pain and\nthe suffering of the Jewish people. With everyone listed in ghetto slang, we have a\nlot of material on this, of the news how many people got killed there. For instance,\nyou have postcards with a request to a Jewish consul, to a \u2014 the le \u2014 th-the head of\nthe Jewish ghetto, we don\u2019t hear from this and this family, can you write? And he\nsays, well, they\u2019re buried in this and this cemetery. So how can it be that four\npeople from one family is buried, died in the same day? Must be something. So, as\na archivist I look documents, I look through things. I found out on this and this day,\nthey murdered 650 Jews. They put them in the synagogue, and put the fire the\nsynagogue. And these are things you learn from it. And this is this \u2014 you got to\nwrite about it, what happened. And you have the documentation, it\u2019s not just that\nsomething nice can come [indecipherable] happen, it\u2019s everything written the\npostcard. And they can\u2019t deny because this was censored, by the Germans censor,\neverything. I have from the camps, going from the ghetto into the camps, letters,\nAugust 5, 1999\npostcards. And this irreplaceable, you can\u2019t put in a value on it. On a history you\ncan\u2019t put the value. And to sell, I don\u2019t know what you \u2014 depends on the collector. I\nthinks that I paid 5,000 dollars for an item, for one letter, which is extremely rare.",
        "Q: In your work in the Holocaust Museum \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 do you ever work with the public?",
        "A: With the public here, not, but I do a lot, I give talks to charities. I gave talks to\nuniversities, and I do this about 10 to 15 times a year. I gave a talk about two years\nago in Fort Meade for the army people, which it happened it was the ninth of May,\nthe anniversary of the end of the second World War. Was about 300 officers there\npresent, they wrote me up in the paper, in fact they wrote me up in two papers.\nWell, I came there. I didn\u2019t talk much about the Jewish Holocaust, because I don\u2019t\nknow who the people are. Gentile \u2014 it depends. In schools, in schools or\n[indecipherable] I tell them the Holocaust. Army people is a different thing. I\nwanted to disclose to them, which the army doesn\u2019t know if \u2014 the United States\npopulation doesn\u2019t know what happened to American POWs during the war. Their\nholocaust, which people don\u2019t understand, they don\u2019t know, which I have\ndocuments from the second World War that I copied, and it\u2019s everything in the\narchives. In what manner they killed the POWs, also death marches, which it\u2019s not\nAugust 5, 1999\nknown that they went through death marches. There\u2019s a death march with 8,000\nBritish POWs from Poland [indecipherable], they took them through the snow\nand everything, that I found in the archives, a book from a major, from a British\nmajor with the names who got killed, shot on the road, they couldn\u2019t make it. So\nmany of them, thousands got killed from the 8,000. This is not known, and the\npublic don\u2019t know. And they opened their eyes when they heard what they did to\nthe American soldiers, how they buried them with the heads up, which you can find\npictures in si \u2014 and now it\u2019s in \u2014 in college [indecipherable], with the heads up,\nburied. I have a fact, a Jewish soldier, which I have a document with the picture,\neverything. When they \u2014 when they captured him they found a prayer book, which\nthey have the army prayer books, the Jewish people, they took away everything.\nThen they wanted to take off his ring, and 1t wouldn\u2019t come off from the ki \u2014 finger.\nThey took a shovel and cut off his finger to get the ring. Then they buried them with\nthe heads up, and when the American army came in and they saw them burying the\nhead, they kept them \u2014 they kept them from the American army, we should bury\nthem here. He says, don\u2019t take no prisoners from them, look what they did to them.\nAnd this is the anger, but today the population don\u2019t understand what the Germans\ndid to them. The \u2014 they don\u2019t know that over two million Russian POWs were\nkilled by the Nazis in Buchenwald also. There were between three and 400 killings\nAugust 5, 1999\nevery day in Buchenwald, that they had the barrack there, it was called by\ntelephone, 91. When they called them up, they knew what it 1s, they were dressed as\ndoctors. They put them in \u2014 they put them into this barrack, and it was just \u2014 just\nlike a doctor effice \u2014 office for examine your eyes, the height, and everything. And\nthey took prisoners, a lot of prisoners 1n one time, every night what was going on.\nAnd they examined their teeth, they examined their eyes, everything. Then they\ntook one by one into a next room, which it was against the wall to measure the\nheight. But there was a slot there, and they put with the heads back and there he got\nright away a bullet in his back head and this was going all night long. In the\nmorning they cleaned everything off, they had to have a plumber to unplug from the\nblood and everything. They captured those people, they captured the people after\nthe war. What did they do to them? I found documents, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 1t\u2019s unbelievable\nthat the American government could do this. I have a document which a German\nofficer, a doctor decapitated a g \u2014 a-an American officer. He took his head, put them\nin a liquid, get off the flesh, everything. He bleached his skull, and it \u2014 he sent his\nwife a souvenir for mantelpiece. They caught this, and now the German told them,\nand he wanted to save his life. And he was among 45 other German prisoners what\nthey killed [indecipherable] other places. And of course, he was sentenced to death\nby hanging. So the Germans were very smart, and very smart lawyers, right away\nAugust 5, 1999\ngot \u2014 they got petitions from the people from that city which that doctor\n[indecipherable] decapitated the soldier. They got over 5,000 names that he was a\ngood citizen, he went to church every Sunday, that he has a old mother, how can\nshe die knowing if he\u2019s gonna be killed? He has two small kids. How will the kids\nlive the rest of the life he\u2019s going to get killed. And a letter included that came from\nthe Vatican, which I have a copy, a document, which it went to General Clay,\nwhich he was the governor of Europe from the American army, if you are going to\nkill those 45 people, you are not any better than the Nazis, because the war is over.\nSo they commuted them. Of course they got commuted to life. The lawyers were so\nsmart, they send in the petition to Washington, not explaining that they were\ncommuted from hanging to life, but they said they were sentenced to life. And with\nthe same thing with their signatures. So that particular person was commuted to 25\nyears. After sitting Landsberg for five years only, for good behavior they let him\nout free. I have the documents to show. What do we say to the parents from that\npoor soul that he got decapitated? They walking around free. And of course the\nCold War there so they did away everything, 1t\u2019s known for it. And it hurts.",
        "Q: You mentioned you do a lot of public speaking \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and you have quite an extensive collection\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 now.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t talk about it in the past. Do you have children and if yes, what did\nyou tell your children about your childhood and your experiences in Europe?",
        "A: Well, I never wanted to talk from anything, but my son, when I was invited to\ntalk to a church in Stevenson, there in Baltimore, so him with his wife came, and I\nthink that\u2019s the first time he ever heard this, because I never wanted to talk at home.\nAnd he knows a lot of times when I watch a film that \u2014 that I cry a lot. I don\u2019t cry, I\nwalk out, so he knows this. And he \u2014 he knows more about things. And I told him\nabout my collection. A lot of it I donated, a lot of [indecipherable]. Every time I\ncome here I give some here to the museum. Of course, I can\u2019t give everything to the\nmuseum, cause I got kids to leave some money, cause all my money, I never did the\nbank, everything went to buy this stuff, because I figured, I went through so much,\nlet me enjoy what I want with my collections.",
        "Q: How many children do you have and how old are they?",
        "A: Yeah, I have two boys. One just got his birthday in July, his 40\" birthday and\none is 38. He is married, and I have my first grandchild, which she is 18 months\nold, beautiful girl. But the only thing that I complain, he is all the time traveling on\nAugust 5, 1999\nplanes for a \u2014 his job demands a lot, he gives lectures and this, he travels all over.\nFor instance, he was only six weeks ago, the first time they send him to Israel, he\nwas only for a day and a half, he saw my sister only for 10 minutes, that\u2019s all. He 1s\nall the time on the travel, and with a young kid. But he is very well loved. My other\nboy is so-so here. And then my wife, unfortunately not so well, when you get a little\nolder, with different things, and so it\u2019s not easy, but I manage to do everything. And\nI\u2019m going to talk a lot about my family, what happened.",
        "Q: I\u2014I do want you to go over and tell me what happened to the members of your\nfamily, but I would like to ask you for a few moments to reflect about some of the\nthings that happened while you were in this country.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And the first thing that comes to my mind is the Eichmann trial.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you follow the Eichmann trials?",
        "A: Yeah, sure. Well, the Eichmann trial I did follow, and my brother-in-law was\nthere. In fact, I have letters from \u2014 from the prosecutor, from the [indecipherable]\ntrial, which they gave to my brother-in-law for writing all those articles. He \u2014 he\nwrites a lot for the army and everything. And what bothered me from the\nEichmann trials especially, when my brother-in-law wrote me a letter, he says he \u2014\nAugust 5, 1999\nI can\u2019t understand. There were Israelis at the trial, and he overheard young Israelis,\nwhat kind scared people are the Jews? Couldn\u2019t they fight back, that they were\nkilled like nothing, and everything. And I got very aggravated about it. I saw \u2014 I\nwas once on Yom HaShoah in Baltimore. It was couple days sitting past me, he\nsays, Morrie, don\u2019t you \u2014 couldn\u2019t I fight back, they go to be killed? Just \u2014 just \u2014\njust whatever they tell them to do it? And when I was \u2014 I was invited to go with a\ngroup of Polish officers for the 50\" anniversary of the Battle of Monte Cassino. So\nI figured I\u2019m gonna go, I was the only Jewish person who [indecipherable], which\nI went with them, we went to Ossiah(ph), we went to Vienna, we went to\nBudapest and then Italy, to all the cemeteries where were soldiers from the\n[indecipherable] army were killed in Italy and they are buried there. And it\u2019s a lot\nof Jewish soldiers are buried there. People don\u2019t know about it. In Verona, other\nplaces. In the Monte Cassino we have about between 36 to 40 Jewish soldiers\nburied there. So one of the ladies here, a very intelligent woman from Chicago,\nshe\u2019s a teacher for music and a artist. And we were very close because with her I\ntalk intelligent manner. And she told me, she says Morris, you tell me one thing.\nLook at the Israelis how they fight and this. How come the Jews never fought there\nin \u2014 in\u20141n Poland. So I ask her wha \u2014 and then it burned me up, so I ask a\nquestion. I says, Stasia(ph) tell me, how come that 15,000 Polish officers, they were\nAugust 5, 1999\nofficers, not regular army people, were killed in [indecipherable] murdered in\n[indecipherable], they never fought back. By the way, there were over 800 Jewish\nsoldiers that got killed, officers got killed in [indecipherable] which I have \u2014 the\nnames I have in the archives, I was working the archives in Warsaw, I found the\nnames, everything. Tell me that the same valiant soldiers from the Russian army,\nthat they captured Berlin, everything, fought so gallantly against the Nazis, over\ntwo and a half million got killed, and they went like sheep to the slaughter. They\ndidn\u2019t fight back. I said, how come so many British POWs got killed, they never\nfought back? In Poland they never fought back. I said, who were the first ones to\nfight, with nothing? It was the Jewish uprising in Warsaw ghetto. I said, you show\nme in all the mankind history, if a person \u2014 if a army [indecipherable] is in\ndefense, there is no uprising, they don\u2019t. Only when [indecipherable] there\u2019s\nuprisings. I said, the Polish uprising in Warsaw, when did it come? When the\nRussian army were near th \u2014 near the \u2014 over there. And they were near Praga and\nthey didn\u2019t come in, they la-later on killed the Polish uprising. That\u2019s what they\nwanted. So then when the \u2014 the Pole \u2014 I said, people fought back in Sobibor in the\ncamp. They fought back even Auschwitz. They fought back anywhere they can,\neven the ghettos, when they \u2014 when they saw uniforms for the army \u2014 for the army,\nI said. I said, Jewish people fought. I said, two \u2014 two and a quarter million \u2014\nAugust 5, 1999\n250,000 Russian soldiers, Jewish soldiers got killed fighting the Nazis, it\u2019s a fact.\nHow many Jews in the British army fell? In the French army, in the Greek army,\neverywhere they fought. How many Jewish soldiers fell and fought against the\nNazis, American soldiers? You go and tell me that they didn\u2019t fight back. Give them\na chance with what to fight back, but they fought.",
        "Q: During your years in the United States \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 did you become involved with any of the Holocaust organizations that were\nnot related to the museum, the \u2014 the survivors\u2019 groups, anything like that?",
        "A: Well, when we started out in Baltimore when we came, there was a survivors\u2019\ngroup, we had meetings, but only[indecipherable] for three years. What happened,\npeople didn\u2019t have time, where they have the groceries, most of them went to\ngrocery stores. They were 12 hours a day, they slept there and everything. They\nwere dis-integrated. I mean, not particularly \u2014 there was a \u2014 I tried to \u2014 I tried to\nform a group, without success. I tried even to put out a Holocaust museum in\nBaltimore, which I went to the biggest people, which they give donations in the\nheavy thousands, hundreds of thousands, but to have their name on it. But\nsomething like this, I went to them, they told me, wa \u2014 what do you need here? It\u2019s\ngoing to be a museum in Washington, it\u2019s a museum Los Angeles, what do we\nAugust 5, 1999\nneed this here? I told them, you don\u2019t need much, just give me a room, like they\nhave in Chicago, they have in Los Angeles, there\u2019s a little museum. I will give the\nmaterial. In fact, | was ashamed. Three years ago they called me from the Jewish\nCouncil, they have the teachers, the Catholic teachers convention in Baltimore. So\nthey wanted to put up a little exhibit, so there \u2014 at the table from the Jewish\nCouncil, which I exhibited there, and I was there. And they found out that I wanted\nto put up a museum and to donate this material. That priest from the church came to\nme, we will \u2014 you donate the material, we will have in the church a little museum.\nSo I says, I am very sorry. I can loan you the material, but you asking a little too\nmuch. What the Christians killed so the Jews, and \u2014 and \u2014 and the priests didn\u2019t do\nanything, you ask me from the people, from the victims to donate this kind of\nmaterial to a church?

Right in front there, where\nsurvivors came in were Nazis there marching with placards and the police didn\u2019t do\nnothing. What [indecipherable]? It\u2019s free of speech here, they say, you can do\neverything. But they don\u2019t know from these speeches, what they have now,\nespecially on the Web and everything, it can be another Holocaust. How can I\nreact? And the best thing, let them go, not to put even the papers this was a march. I\nca \u2014 I started, I never wanted to talk about the Holocaust at all, but when did I start?\nWhen I heard in Skokie what was go on the marches. Then I woke up and I says,\nnow I got to do something, now it\u2019s about time I opened my big mouth.",
        "Q: How do you think the Holocaust has ec \u2014 influenced some of the choices that\nyou\u2019re made in your life personally, professionally?",
        "A: Well, with everything I am very bitter. If you \u2014 you ask me about religion. I was\nvery bitter, because where was God, and every survivor will tell you. And if people\nwouldn\u2019t be that fanatic of religious, because a lot of people couldn\u2019t before the\nwar, go to Palestine at that time, but they said no, they have to wait til the Messiah.\nAugust 5, 1999\nIt wouldn\u2019t happen. A lot of people, if they would have cut their beards and this,\nthey could have maybe survived. They didn\u2019t. And what I found out, a lot of people\nthat they were so religious before the war, friends of mine, they became the biggest\nthing, they eat everything not kosher, they wouldn\u2019t even go to a synagogue, not\neven on Yom Kippur. And a lot of people that they were not religious, became\nreligious. And I tell you, it\u2014 ma\u2014I think my boys suffered a lot in the beginning of\nit, because they saw me and 1-it \u2014 it does something to the kids. It does something.\nBut, when you get older, and this \u2014 and myself, I thought well, it went through\neverything, let\u2019s forget it. You can\u2019t forget. The older you get, the more you remind\nyourself what happened, the more you wanted to cry what happened. You have\nmore time to think about it, before you were busy with your work, with business\nand this and this. Now when it comes you go to bed, everything comes back to you,\nand especially with me when you work in the museum. When you see all the stories\nand everything is your head \u2014 you register everything in you \u2014 in you mind, and it\ncomes back to you, everything. A lot of the times I came home from work, from\nhere, my wife, uh-oh, uh-oh, you had a tough time. She can notice, by the way, that\nI don\u2019t talk of this and this and this and this. But yet, whenever I come to company,\nI all the time with a smile, I all the time lighten up [indecipherable] and I try to do\nmy best in life what I can. When I am in Germany, and [| have a lot of German\nAugust 5, 1999\nfriends, they ask me, and this and this and this and this. I says look, the only thing\nyou can do about it, what happened, so to see that it doesn\u2019t happen again. If you\nsee somewhere the Nazi party and everything, do something about it. That\u2019s what\nyou can help, I said.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you were thinking of wring a book.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you briefly tell me a little bit about your plan for this book?",
        "A: Well, first of all, I want to talk about my whole family, what everybody in the\nfamily went through, because it\u2019s a book in itself from e \u2014 every person my family\ncan write a book. And my life at home, my life in school, which I remember from\nthe first grade on, the teachers and students and everything. And during the war\nwhat happened, from everybody from mine family what happened during the war.\nAnd right after the war, how traumatic it was, everything. And yet, you got to go on\nwith your life, and you get situated the best you can, and you try to be happy, and\ntry to raise a family, and to have a future, that\u2019s all. And that shouldn\u2019t be forgotten,\nthat\u2019s the main thing.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you knew what happened to your parents \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 during the war. Can you go through your siblings one at a time \u2014\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 and tell me with each one, their fate?",
        "A: Well, for instance, my parents. I \u2014 my parents, August 12\" was the\n[indecipherable] in our city, that the th-they \u2014 they \u2014 the Jewish community, the\ncouncil, put out notices everybody should come, in the best clothes to be\nrepresented nice, and they come there to a field which it\u2019s near the Jewish\ncommunity, and they\u2019re going \u2014 they\u2019re going to register everyone for work and this\nand this, to come, and we have to be on time. That\u2019s six o\u2019clock in the morning we\ncame. We were there six in the morning, I won\u2019t go to the \u2014 all the history, it\u2019s\nknown, but they took away mine parents at that time, and they marched them all the\nway to Benzburg(ph), where they were in an orphanage for almost three days. I\ndidn\u2019t have the keys to the house to get in, so I ran to Benzburg(ph), which the\npolice didn\u2019t let me in, the Jewish militia. One of them recognized me and I says, I\ngot to get the key. He says, you might be \u2014 not be able get out. I said I\u2019d take the\nchance. And when I came in there, I can never forget the scene what I saw. People,\na lot of them had taleism, how they prayed, an-and they banged themself in the\nheart [indecipherable]. And I will never forget the scene that it was, my father gave\nme a watch, he had the watch, and the keys to the house. And what happened, I\nworked at that time by one of the biggest SS men, Dryer(ph), I did some painting\nAugust 5, 1999\nfor his girlfriend. And a \u2014 a day before I ask him what\u2019s going to be with the parent.\nOh go, you go there [indecipherable] because I was scared. And then I came on\nwith my older bro \u2014 why didn\u2019t \u2014 you promised me they would take my parents,\nwhere are they? They took him away. Well, I will see what I can do. Then two days\nlater is where it was too late, but he didn\u2019t tell me where they went or anything. And\nwhat happened when I came out from there, from work, and I went home, I went\nthrough the fields, never through the city. I went through the fields, I notice a train.\nAnd when I look at the train I saw German army people in the roofs, and this. I see\nthrough the window Yurinis(ph) Snifell(ph), the father from mine good friend, the\none that what I told you, he died in \u2014 in \u2014 in Bergen-Belsen. He waved to me, I\nwaved back. That\u2019s how I knew this 1s the train that they went to Auschwitz. And\nit\u2019s recorded that they were killed in the 17\" of August, they were killed. And then\nthe first victim was my sister, the one that went on the Exodus. She was taken away\nin the beginning of \u201942, May, where they told all young girls, women between 14\nand 30 have to register, 14 or 13 years old. And of course, my sister was the\nyoungest at home, she was only 14 years old. And what I forgot to tell you about\nmy sister, some \u2014 which it\u2019s interesting 1-1n the ghetto what happened. I will come\nback to this wh \u2014 time will permit me. My sister saw in the window \u2014 through the\nwindow, a girlfriend of her on the bike. And this was about nine in the morning.\nAugust 5, 1999\nShe ran out to greet her, this was Basha(ph) Frotesfike(ph), very fine, beautiful\ngirl. As she ran out, it went by a gendarme, a German gendarme went by and she\ndidn\u2019t have her armband on. So she ran quick back to the house, he ran back.\n[indecipherable] to the house, he came to the house. He saw my stamp collection, I\nwas doing stamps. Right away he came, you can\u2019t have this. He took it away, he\nsays, the German government will pay you, you can\u2019t have this. He probably was\ncollecting, he took it away. And they took to court my sister and she got for three\nweeks a prisoner. Of course my mother was crying, how can she go, so my mother\nwent to prison instead of her, because a young girl, she was afraid. Three weeks. I\nwent almost every second day with food to the prison to give her kosher food. And\nthat\u2019s what happened, it was a terrible time. And then they took \u2014 what I said, they\nsaid to register the girls, they took into Sosnowiec to the dulac(ph), and they sent\n450 girls away, all the cream from the youngsters from our city, and they send them\nto a camp, Gruenberg [indecipherable] that\u2019s where I came. This is one of them.",
        "Q: And you\u2019ve mentioned some of your other siblings.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Who in your family did not survive?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, it was Leosia, the oldest. She died on the death march from\nStutthof, yeah. Then was Yehiel. He died, they took him to Auschwitz with the\nAugust 5, 1999\nwhole family, with \u2014 with four children, one which it\u2019s listed on the picture, on the\npamphlets from the Red Cross, I have the picture. And with his wife the whole\nfamily got wiped out. Then was Ruchcia and Tamara. She escaped howe \u2014 to\nRussia, which as \u2014 a witness from my city, they saw them going to the Russian\nside, and he says, come on, let\u2019s go in deep. And she says no, I have to go back\nhome, I want to see my father. When they tried to go back home, and that\u2019s where I\nknow the last thing I heard of them. One, Sala, she ran to the underground, her and\nher husband, they have a little boy. And she went on the underground and they were\nnear Krakow, and they send him \u2014\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: \u2014 it\u2019s a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Morris Rosen. This is tape three, side B, and\nyou were telling me about your sister \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 who went to the underground.",
        "A: Yeah, she went to the underground, to her husband with a little kid, and they\nsend them away to undermine some rails, you know, for train. When he came back\nthere were four girls, four Jewish girls, it was in the PPR, the pepperarr(ph), this\nAugust 5, 1999\nwas the worker\u2019s underground. They were more leftists. And when came back all\nthe four girls were cut the throats and the stomachs. And she was dead and the kid\nwas alive, all bloody from the blood. They didn\u2019t hurt him, but bloody. He grabbed\nthe kid, he washed it off, ran away, and in Krakow he went to a building \u2014 you\nknow the buildings have there staircases where you can \u2014 windows look out? And\nhe put the kid near a monastery, on the steps from a monastery. He was there for\nabout an hour watching window, and he saw somebody came out, a nun, and they\ntook the kid away. And he ran away. He ran away back to Lvov, to Lemberg,\nwhere he came from, he was in Lemberg. And what I know about it, what we\nfound out, and this is from her husband\u2019s brother, what we found out. Her\nhusband\u2019s brother was a officer in the Russian army. And when he came back to\nLemberg, when they liberated Lvov, they came from there, he found his brother,\nmine sister\u2019s husband and he told him the story what happened to her, and with the\nkid. The same day they were sitting a restaurant, a drunken Russian soldier killed\nmy sister\u2019s husband. The day from the liberation. So anyway, he knew about the\nkid, so after the war they put in the paper they\u2019re looking for this kid, and they\noffered a lot of money. In fact, I think that the HIAS or some Jewish organization\noffered a lot of money, a reward for \u2014 for give information about that kid that was\nhere \u2014 he had taken away. It took about two months, came a telephone, and they let\nAugust 5, 1999\nthem know that they know about the kid [indecipherable]. They went there, no,\ngave him away already. He went to another place where we gave him \u2014 he\u2019s on a\nfarm. When he came there toward the farm, he saw a little boy in the pasture,\nbarefoot that the cows, and the little boy started to yell in Polish, help, help, that the\nJews want to kill me. [speaks Polish here] They probably trained that little kid\nagainst the Jews that they shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 either suspect he\u2019s Jewish or something,\nthey never know. But anyway he came in, he wanted the kid, they wouldn\u2019t give\nhim. He says, I give you so much money. No, they don\u2019t have kids. They held him\nall during the war and this, it\u2019s his, that they\u2019re not give away. He says, but I want\nto pay for every \u2014 no, no money can do. We \u2014 we love him and everything. Well, he\nsaw he didn\u2019t have no \u2014 anything to do, he took a couple Jewish comrades from the\narmy, he went back with the guns there, and he says, okay, either we take him, or\nyou gonna get killed when we take him. Anyway, they grabbed the kid \u2014 there were\nfour soldiers, they grabbed the kid, they left money on the table and ran away.\nWhen they ran away they threw away their uniforms, smuggled themselve over to\nItaly, and then from Italy illegal to Palestine. And my oldest sister that came back\nfrom Russia when they came to Palestine, she found out about it, she wanted the\nkid because she\u2019s a aunt. But they went to court in Jerusalem and they gave the kid\nto the uncle because he risked his life, and \u2014 and so anyway, I met a nice \u2014 he looks\nAugust 5, 1999\nlike my brother exactly. This was happened to the other sister. And so I lost four\nsisters and a brother and the parents.",

That\u2019s him. His name, if\nyou w-want to see, is under Kah(ph) Shaptai. Klugman Shaptai(ph)\n[indecipherable]. But he was also known as Scheinfeld(ph). He changed his name,\nhe was afraid from the Polish from the underground things, so he changed his name\nafter his mother\u2019s parents, Scheinfeld [indecipherable]. And his son, his son, when\nhe came over here and changed his name also to Scheinfeld(ph). He was afraid\nKlugman because he was at the international trial, they have something, he was \u2014\nAugust 5, 1999\nand somebody recognize him from Warsaw [indecipherable] he said that\u2019s not\nhim, so he shortened his name to Field so his name is now Field, it\u2019s not\nScheinfeld, just Field.

Anything that\nwe didn\u2019t cover that you would like to include before we end the tape?",
        "A: Well, I would say, I made myself a happy life, the best I can, and was very\nconstructive. I am very busy with the philatelic organizations, which I travel a awful\nlot, I go four or five times overseas a year, which I am invited. And it\u2019s fun being\njudging at the shows because you meet so many people around the world. The only\nAugust 5, 1999\nthing that it\u2019s bad, that I have about 40 \u2014 50 letters to write monthly. But on the\nother hand, it\u2019s nice to know people everywhere. Wherever I travel, if I go I feel at\nhome and \u2014 and very nice, and that\u2019s mine payback.

The oldest was Leosia, Lila, we called her, and she\nmarried the Klugman, came out from Warsaw, they lived in Warsaw, they had\ntheir business in Warsaw, cause he was \u2014 he was secretary for Keren Kayemet\n[indecipherable] before the war.

And then\nwas rof \u2014 Rozka, Ruchcia, Sala, Tamara and Srulek and me, of course, and then\nJosek and Bluma.",
        "A: Well, actually, when I was in Theresienstadt, we were in a room, about 38\npeople, when they took us on the death march from Buchenwald. This was the\nsecond death march, the first one was from Kittlitztreben to Buchenwald. We\nwere there for about a week and then I \u2014 I went out with the last transport from\nAugust 5, 1999\nBuchenwald. I was hiding in the wall and sudden I heard shooting into the wall\ncause some other people came. I went out through a window, cut myself, and ran in\n\u2014 outside I shouldn\u2019t get shot and they were already a line \u2014 lined up, only Jewish\npeople. They only asked for Jewish people. And we walked to Weimar by foot,\nwhich it was full glass, probably a half a foot glass from bombing and everything.\nAnd then on cattle train, put us about hundred or 110, I don\u2019t know exactly, on the\ntrain. And people were dying every day, no food, no water, anything. And we threw\nout bodies. But we didn\u2019t have place where to sit or anything. When it got more\nroomy and more place, actually took some bodies to make ourselves pillows, and\nwe sat on them. And on the fourth day they stopped at the station, which they gave\nus a soup. And it was pure salt, this probably meant to kill us off, which I threw\naway right away [indecipherable] the other people don\u2019t eat it. And on the fifth day\nthey gave us some potatoes, they stopped at the station. And then came two Russian\nairplanes, and they started strafing the locomotive. Every five minutes the two came\nback. They were there for about a minute, strafing them. And on each side of the\ntrack were German soldiers also, and the aircraft, and other transports from the\nother camp. At that time when I ran down the train, from the train everybody ran,\nbecause we were afraid of the bullets from strafing. From another train came a boy\nfrom my city. He was a young \u2014 a young kid about 15 years old, and he was a Pole\nAugust 5, 1999\nin the camp, not as a Jewish guy. Says, come on, we\u2019ll be with the Polish people,\nnot as Jews, and you will survive better and we go there, and we have more food\nthere than you do. And I says no, I will [indecipherable] with the Jewish people, I\nam going to stay, you can join me. And we were there a whole night long in the\nfield laying around and the bombs were falling we saw from [indecipherable]\neverything red, on fire, with heavy bombing from the [indecipherable]. And this is\nthe last time I saw that boy, he went back. In fact, I think they killed the whole\ntransport there, and he got killed too, he didn\u2019t survive. They \u2014 several of us got\naway, but they killed them, because even soldiers, not only the SS, they were\nlooking for us, and we walked all the way til we came to Terezin. In Terezin we\nwere very hungry, dirty, and I don\u2019t have to tell you the lice and everything, they\nate us up alive. And we waited at Terezin all night long, they didn\u2019t have a place\nfor us. We slept on the stones there, I remember. Then we came the morning, they\ngave us hot coffee, bread, and some cheese. And right away they \u2014 we had to give\naway our clothing. We were washed and everything. They gave me two new shirts,\nclean white shirts. This 1s the first time I put on a shirt in four years. And nice\nclothing, and even a pajama, I was shocked. And we were in the Hamburg\ncaserna(ph). We were there for a couple days, and people were just dying in the\nroom, sick from typhus. And I was very scared to be with them. I knew \u2014 I saw\nAugust 5, 1999\nwhat\u2019s happening. And I jumped down a window, I don\u2019t know if I was sick at that\ntime or something, but something, I jumped out the window and I don\u2019t know how\nlong I was on the feet. But in the morning I \u2014 I have, in sleep like singing Czech\nsongs, partisan songs, and when I woke up there was a Russian soldier what woke\nme up. He stood with me. And they gave me some food. I went back to the \u2014 went\nback to the room there with some other people, we only left 16 people from over 30.\nAnd then I went out, I couldn\u2019t walk because I was only about around 80 pounds,\nnot any more. And after a day, the entire long day, a guy from our barrack, he was\nvery hefty, he must be the kapo or something, but a healthy guy, he smuggled\nhimself out from Terezin, because it was quarantine, they didn\u2019t let anybody out,\nthere were Czech soldiers staying outside the [indecipherable] because a lot of\nsickness was going, typhus. Th-Thousands of people died at that time. And he came\nwith the wagon, horse and wagon and on the wagon he had wine, cases and cases of\nwine. And the Portuguese sardines in golden labels, I remember like now. And he\nbrought in there thousands and thousands of hundred mark bills, which we didn\u2019t\nhave toilet tissue, was diarrhea a lot, and we put them on a hook, on nails, and we\nput them in \u2014 we didn\u2019t know that the money will ever be good for something, how\nwould we know? We didn\u2019t have any other paper. And all I ate is the sardines and\nthe \u2014 and the wine drank. And we didn\u2019t have bread or anything. And then they told\nAugust 5, 1999\nme to go to the doctor. When I went to the doctor and he says, what have you been\neating, that you not even hungry? First of all, my stomach shrank, we couldn\u2019t eat\nmuch. And he says, you\u2019re pretty lucky, because you could have died from the\nsardines. You are lucky that you drank a lot of wine. The wine, that saved your life.\nAnd they gave us food, right away they brought in food, the same food what the\narmy, the Soviet army took. And this was the biggest, biggest mistake, because th-\nthey came in with the field kitchen, and they have kraut with bacon in it, meat, and\npotatoes and everything so fat, and people were dying like flies from the food. Then\nI heard when you were liberated by the Americans, they didn\u2019t give you no food,\nvery little, because the stomach shrank, you couldn\u2019t eat anything. And that\u2019s the\nreason a lot of people they could survive, died from the food. And I was very\ncareful. When he told me you lucky that the wine \u2014 and when they gave such a\nfood, all I ate was a little piece meat, not much, and the potatoes. And a liquid. They\ngave milk, this I drank, and \u2014 for about a week. And then th \u2014 th-they burned\n[indecipherable] there because they were full with, you know, vermin and\neverything. And dead people were all around. And then \u2014",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t explain, he just said that you were lucky, but they tasted so good.\nYeah, and everybody ate them, and we drank a lot of wine. We didn\u2019t have anything\nto do, cause we were afraid to go to other barracks there. They weren\u2019t barracks, but\nthe other buildings, cause this was actually the ghetto, it wasn\u2019t barracks. And we\nafraid a lot \u2014 I met there some friends, they were sick, from my hometown also.\nAnd a lot of my friends passed away. And we saw there \u2014 there I met a girl from\nYugoslavia, she was on a bench sitting, I warmed myself in the sun, and then I met\nthe girl Truwik(ph) from our city, from Dabrowa, they have a store with leather\ngoods, the ver \u2014 very fine family and we talked about it. And then came the \u2014 they\ncame for her that she went to Sweden. She begged me to go with her to Sweden.\nAnd \u2014 cause they took young kids there. And I says no, I\u2019m gonna wait, maybe I\nfind somebody or something. And I saw there guards, huge guards, they took\nGermans, the SS and other people, cleaning away the dirts and everything, and we\nscreamed at them, we [indecipherable] but we couldn\u2019t do any other thing, and I\nwas sorry I didn\u2019t kill a couple of them. But there\u2019s nothing you could do.",
        "A: Well, let me tell you the story what was. From the Red Cross they came, ask my\nname, from which city I am, and the information that they took from me, went the\nsame, I think, on the radio in New York. All over Europe, every night between 10\nAugust 5, 1999\nand one in the morning, they \u2014 they called out names who survive, which camp\nwere they at, so on, so on. So my sister\u2019s husband, Klugman, the one that was the\nsecretary from [indecipherable] he heard on the radio I am alive. He was in\nBudapest at that time. He was with his son, he was in the underground, and \u2014 so\nwhen they heard me, he went alone, his son, they made up that they\u2019re gonna meet\nin Prague, and he came to Terezin. Of course, they wouldn\u2019t let nobody out at that\ntime, but he had his son\u2019s pass, and with this pass they let me out, and he was as a\ncorrespondent, because he had papers as a correspondent there. And he took me out\nfrom there, I had only one pair of pants, I took along another shirt what they gave\nme, and we walked a couple miles to Buchewice(ph) because there was no train at\nthat time.",
        "A: I was \u2014 I was liberated, was around the sixth or seventh of \u2014 of May, or maybe\nearlier, I will never know the date exact, but appro \u2014 approximately this is the time.\nCause don\u2019t forget, I was out, I don\u2019t know how long I was out.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I was \u2014 first of all, of course in the ghetto. Then I was in one camp right\nafter they took my parents away, the Jewish community send me to Szcezakowa.\nThis was a leather factory, which we work, we were about 30 men there. And after\nit was Judenrein in all Upper Silesia and we got food from the Jewish community.\nThe Juden [indecipherable] send us food. And when was no more food, about two\nweeks after Judenrein, the SS came. Now, the SS came, they took us away from\nSzezakowa and we were the ones cleaning out the [indecipherable] in Sosnowiec,\nChancer(ph) was still there, he was the Juden-Elster(ph) from [indecipherable].\nAnd we went there, I remember all the sto \u2014 all with people were sleeping and\neverything. And one morning before [indecipherable] we came \u2014 we went to work,\ncame the SS man Ludwig. He was the head that they sent all the people to the\ncamps from Silesia and everybody was petrified scared of him because we knew\nwho he was. He sent my sister to the camp also, and everybody from our city. And\nhe ask if there is a painter. And I was doing painting in the ghetto during the war for\nthe Bauleitung. This is the building company that they send us to work. I was doing\nbricklaying and painting a lot and I learned the trade very good in the war, I was\nvery good, young, and I kept my mouth shut, because I was afraid. I was a young\nboy, short, and I\u2019m not going to tell him I\u2019m a mechanic, I\u2019m a painter, I was afraid\nof him. So one from my city that was with me [indecipherable] his name, said that\nAugust 5, 1999\nthe Rosen is a painter. So he came \u2014 he came over to me, bist du ein Maler?\nJawohl Oberscharfuehrer, he gave me right away in the face [indecipherable] he\nknocks me out, all the teeth. [speaks German here]. Why do you keep your mouth\nshut? Iam a painter, I said, I am a very good painter, very good. He puts me on the\nside. I didn\u2019t know what he was going to do with me. Everybody went to work and I\nstood there for about a half hour. Then came two SS men with him. He said, I got\nthree rooms to paint and I give you three days. And he took out his pistol, tapped\nme in my head. He said, if you are not finished in three days, you lived enough. So I\ntold him, I don\u2019t have no tools, I don\u2019t have no material. If you allow me to go to\nDabrowa where we live, I got some tools that I work in the ghetto and I can\n[indecipherable]. He says, you don\u2019t need anything, you get everything. So the \u2014\nthe two SS men took me, I walk with them through Sosnowiec, this was in\nSosnowiec and while you walking on the street, I noticed a Jewish girl. Blonde hair,\nbeautiful girl, I knew her. And she passed by so fast, and \u2014 and I looked away that I\ndidn\u2019t want to pay attention where that she should get caught or something. But she\nwalked by. Then we went into a hardware store.",
        "A: Yeah. [tape break]\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: Okay, after \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 after I worked by \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, after I worked by him, and I was working there for about four weeks, so\nhe said, well, Maler, you are not going to Auschwitz, which I didn\u2019t know what\nAuschwitz meant at all. At that time we didn\u2019t know. And he said, but I send you to\na camp. And he brought me food every day. So I ask him, is 1t possible you send me\nto a camp where my sister 1s, I don\u2019t have nobody from my family, just a sister. He\nsays, where is she? I said, she is in Gruenberg, Lower Silesia. He says well, this is\na women\u2019s camp. And then he stood for a second [indecipherable] that you will go\nthere. But meanwhile you go to another camp, a transition, which I went to\nAnnaburg, and this was around October we went to Annaburg. There was no\nwork there, but the transition beating every day. And from there I was sent \u2014 only\nthree people went, Chancer(ph), which was the Juden-Elster from \u2014 from\nDulac(ph) and Sosnowiec, and Herta(ph) Goldfinger, which it was his sweetheart.\nShe was \u2014 she went over to Christianity, but still she was Jewish. They send her and\nshe became Juden-Eltesten(ph) for the women in the camp, and by myself. I came\nthere, it was about October in \u201943, and there were already some people there, men\nAugust 5, 1999\nthere, and I walked there in the [indecipherable] where they make\n[indecipherable] and the first [indecipherable] arrived, he let me in to see my\nsister, the Juden-Elster, because you got to go through the women\u2019s barrack, the\nwomen\u2019s hall and the men went with the [indecipherable] every day, and I went to\nsee her every day and I saw my sister every day in camp. And there we were til\nabout March 1944. The SS came for us because there was \u2014 the men couldn\u2019t be\nany more with the women, it became not a labor camp, forced labor camp, but a\nconcentration camp. And we were sent to Kittlitztreben. Was a subcamp from\nGross-Rosen. It was hell there because the \u2014 the barracks were still not heated, no\nwater, anything. And from there we were til February fifth. When the Russians\ncame near, we marched out on foot and this was the first death march, of which in\nprevious tape I told my story. And we arrived sometimes in April to Buchenwald.\nAnd Buchenwald was hell too, with all the dead people around everywhere and\nmountains of people, which I saw cannibalism for the first time. And on the heap of\nthe dead bodies were still some live people half dead, one of them was Meyer\nHysharik(ph). He was a German Jew, but they chased him out. He was in our city\nand I used to play [indecipherable] ping-pong with him in the Maccabee quarters.\nAnd he asked me, don\u2019t you recognize me? I am Meyer. He says I knew \u2014 but at\nthat time when I saw the other people cutting thing, and I start screaming at them.\nAugust 5, 1999\nSo they ran to me and I ran away. And then we heard that the American army came\nclose by and they start to taking out only Jewish people, they called for Jewish\npeople first, which was, I was hiding in the wall, I told the story. And then we went\nto Weimar by trains and this was the second death march to Theresienstadt.\nTheresienstadt I arrived toward the end of April, must be the 25\" or 26\". This is\nthe date. And I was liberated in May, either the sixth or the seventh.",
        "A: Well, the state of my health wasn\u2019t bad, because all during \u2014 all during my being\nin camp, I kept myself clean as can be. This was the most important thing, not the\nfood as much, but not to run after food to get beaten over a \u2014 a pea, on the death\nmarch, on a stomped cigarette like people got out and got beaten bloody, that\u2019s how\nthey died. I kept away from this. I was with a couple people, friends from camp,\nfrom Gruenberg. We kept ourselves clean, neat, we shaved, everything. And I\nwould say I wasn\u2019t very hungry, but I wasn\u2019t sick, I didn\u2019t have no diarrhea like all\nthe other people. I was watching myself, I was sometimes with \u2014 two weeks without\nfood. But the will to live and the will to live is on the death march because I have\nthe pictures from my home. That\u2019s what kept me alive. Of tor \u2014 course I lost them\nthe last day in Buchenwald. And what I wanted to live is, I wanted to see,\nAugust 5, 1999\nparticularly some of my friends, and especially when I met a young girl in\nSosnowiec, and I was hoping I can meet her. That\u2019s was the will to live, to see my\nfamily and this, and that\u2019s what kept me alive. And I wasn't thinking about food\nnever, but just to take [indecipherable] I wanted to live. And that\u2019s, I think, that I\nlived through the war. And then, as I told you, my sister\u2019s husband came and took\nme out, and this was sometimes in May around, I would say around the 14 or the\n15\" of May. And we walked through [indecipherable] there was a train didn\u2019t go\nthis way, so we went the first time \u2014 day in hotel. And we had there a dinner. Of\ncourse, they didn\u2019t have meat, but nice potatoes with the soup, and this 1s the first\ntime that I ate like a person, with a tablecloth and with a real fork and s \u2014 and\nspoon. The first time that I cried, and I says it couldn't happen. And when I came to\nthe room, the bed was all white linens, I couldn\u2019t believe. And I took a shower\nthere, went to bed. And the next morning we got up early, and we waited for the\ntrain. On the train was no place, so we walked up on the roof from the train, my\nbrother-in-law, myself. We held onto each other, a lot of people were there. We\ncame to Prague. We came to Prague, the first thing when we got off the train, we\nsaw on the street in every corner was the kiosk with food, because a lot of people, a\nlot of people came out from the camps hungry. So every corner was a heart, a red\nheart and the ches \u2014 [indecipherable]. And you have sandwiches, donuts, milk,\nAugust 5, 1999\ncoffee, tea. And then they told us noontime we should go there and there, we get\nfood. So we had soups, and they gave us meat. They were so nice, that\u2019s\nunbelievable. I \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t think that anybody would be so nice,\nespecially to Jewish people, they know we Jewish. Then after \u2014 after being there\nabout two days in the hotel, was about two \u2014 about two or three in the morning,\nsuddenly I wake up it was such a thing, about a hundred Polish women came in to\nthe hotel to sleep. And they were offniks(ph), and [indecipherable] they were good\n\u2014 they were workers from the fields and everything. I don\u2019t think so they were from\ncamps. And they jumped out of my bunk of my bed. My [indecipherable] I jump\ndown, they grab me by the thing, and in Polish, rough language, where do you think\nyou go? You stay right here. But I \u2014 they threw my shirt, I jumped down, my\nbrother-in-law jumped down, right? Cause they were awful. They \u2014 they didn\u2019t have\nmen for a long time, this was their desire. And at that time I didn\u2019t think of women.\nSo I jumped down and went to the bathroom to wash up, and in the bathroom comes\na young \u2014 a young gentleman, was about 18 years and I think \u2014 he ask me if I can\nloan the cup he wants to wash his teeth. And I look at him a red hair \u2014 a redhead\nand the way how he spoke Polish, so I -- [indecipherable] do I ask, are you\nMonek(ph)? He jumped to me and kissed me. This was my brother-in-law\u2019s son\nfrom Warsaw. And I knew he\u2019s coming and when \u2014 when I saw a redhead. And so\nAugust 5, 1999\nwe [indecipherable] went back, and then I said okay, I want to go back to Poland\nand see if anybody\u2019s alive. My brother-in-law said, okay, I\u2019m here, we are going to\nmeet up. What happened, they gave me money, they gave me ticket from the Czech\npeople. I come to the train, the train arrive from Katowice. Train arrive, a lot of\nJews came out, guys. I ask them where you going? He says, we just came from\nthere. I told him I want to go to Poland, he says, are you crazy? He says, we just\nhad to give a couple bottles vodka to the Russian guards that they should let us out\nfrom there. You are not safe there. They kill people [indecipherable] people,\nnobody\u2019s safe. So I turn back and went to saw my brother. He says, I had enough,\nhe says, I don\u2019t like the Russians. They are not any better than \u2014 I says, but they\nliberated us. He says, I don\u2019t like the communists. We are going to go over to the\nAmerican side, because the Americans were occupying part of Czechoslovakia.\nAnd from there we have a chance to go to Palestine. That\u2019s was te \u2014 okay, we\npacked his son and myself and we went on the train and he told me, by the way,\nwhen the guards will come, the American guards or something, don\u2019t tell them you\nfrom Poland because they take you off and they go and ship you to Poland. Tell\nthem you a German Jew, and you going back to Germany. We wanted to go to\nGermany. Okay, when came to the border, the Russian guards went off, the\nAmerican [indecipherable] came in for passes. You know, passport because we\nAugust 5, 1999\ncrossed the border. Didn\u2019t have anything and he ask. As he ask where I\u2019m going I\ntell them I\u2019m from Germany, I\u2019m going back to Germany. So my nephew started\ntalking to him English, in a perfect English and the same thing my brother. So they\nask how do you know such a good English? In fact, they used to have a French\nmaid at home that she spoke to them only French and English instead of Polish, and\nhe knew very well. So they took them off from the train, who they are, and he says\nyou go, I find you. So I went by myself and arrived about 12 o\u2019clock at night in\nPilsner. When I got out from the station there were American soldiers sleeping on\nthe ground with their sleeping bags and blankets. It was cold. A May day at night is\nvery cold in Europe. And I was only dressed in a shirt and a pair of pants. So I lay\ndown between them, kept pulling the blanket. They kept pulling back and I kept\ntelling th \u2014 pull them to me. Finally I fell asleep, I don\u2019t know, when I woke up it\nwas about 11 in the morning. Nobody was there ex-except me on the cement. I got\nup hungry and cold. Where do I go? I go first to the police.",
        "A: \u2014camp and survive it, and I am from Poland, Polish. The first thing they told\nme, don\u2019t ever say you\u2019re Polish, because they hated the Poles, because in \u201938 when\nAugust 5, 1999\nthe German army entered Sudetenland, [indecipherable] the Poles went to\n[indecipherable], they occupied part of Czech Republic. And they hated the Poles.\nJust tell them you were Jewish from Poland, otherwise you won\u2019t get anything and\nthey are very angry, you might even get beaten up. They were angry at the Poles.\nAnd then he tole \u2014 he gave me five kroner, food, cigarettes. And he told me, if you\njoin the communist party, you get double money and everything double. So I\nthought, for being in the party, what can it hurt? I get double money, better\ntreatment \u2014 they would treat me better. He gave me right away to put on a thing that\nI belong to the communist party and he gave me right away 10 kroner, they put me\nup where to sleep at night. But the boy scouts \u2014 the boy scouts had a nice quarters,\nthey gave me food, I showered, cigarettes. And I ask, is there Jewish people, cause I\nwant to be with the Jewish people. No, there were no Jewish people they thought.\nSo I said, I\u2019m going to go further. I go further, another place, I went to the police \u2014\nall I went to the police there, I showed up, I told them I\u2019m from the communist\nparty, also a member, and they gave me food. Again, I ask them for Jewish people. I\ncame to a third town, I think 1t was Fawlen(ph) and so I ask them, they said yeah,\nthere\u2019s Jewish people, girls, in Starachowice in the hospital. And I couldn\u2019t wait til\n\u2014 to meet them. The first thing to meet Jewish girls. I came to Starachowice, and\nthis was mostly by foot going, all the bo \u2014 the scouts, they took me by Jeep. They\nAugust 5, 1999\nall time were nice, they took me from one city to other with their Jeeps. I came into\nthe hospital, they told me yeah, there\u2019s four Jewish girls. They wouldn\u2019t give me the\nname. They\u2019re all sick on typhus, you can\u2019t go in to see them. It\u2019s quarantine, they\nwouldn\u2019t give me no information. I was so angry, here are all the four girls, tell me\nwho they are, where they are. Can\u2019t do anything. Walking out from the hospital, and\nlooking around the buildings, somebody screamed in Polish, Moniek, Moniek, it\nwas [indecipherable] don\u2019t you recognize me? I am Bella(ph) Sigilla(ph). And she\nis from my city. And she was in Gruenberg, which I was with her in Gruenberg.\nSo I \u2014 we cried both, and I asked her, can you tell me about my sister Bluma? She\nwas with you in the camp, everything. So she said she was on the death march and\nshe escaped. She saw when she escaped, they were shooting at the head, but I don\u2019t\nknow if she fell dead or not, I can\u2019t tell you. But if you want to know more about it,\nth-the transport in Volvalla(ph), which it\u2019s in Volary, in the Sudetenland. There\nyou will find, because the rest of the transport are there, we are here, four girls sick\nfrom typhus. So, I picked some field flowers, you know, in the field, they were\ncoming out spring, I put a bouquet and I send it in to her, the flowers. And I walked\naway, I stopped there by people, they gave me food and I couldn\u2019t wait. I walked 12\nhours without interruption, just to see \u2014 to come with \u2014 with the ha \u2014 where the\nJewish girls are. It took me two days to go there by foot mostly. I came to\nAugust 5, 1999\nVallin(ph), I came to the police, can you tell me \u2014 I heard there are Jewish girls.\nThey took a policeman, he took me over [indecipherable] and he showed me this is\nthe hospital, go in. Okay. As I came into the hospital I opened the door. On the top\non the steps \u2014 were about 14 or 15 steps, girls t\u2014 a historical scream, Moniek, so\nhysterical. And happened to be the sister of my best friend Sheps(ph) Sheva(ph)\nSheps(ph). She jumped down all the steps and we both fell to the wall, she would\nhave killed me, both fell on the ground, and start screaming, right, that all the girls,\nthat they were able to walk, because don\u2019t forget, they were very sick, came down\nrunning and most of them I knew from camp, and most of them from my city also,\nbecause they took to Gruenberg, 450 Jewish girls sent to this camp, my sister\nincluded. And that Sheva(ph) told me right away that her sister died, we talked\nthere and I met all the other girls, she took me to the cemetery, showed me where\nher sister is buried, that she died two days after the liberation here, and some other\ngirls that I knew that they\u2019re buried there, with a little note there written about her\nsister. And there were 45 graves there. They were buried in the field next to the\nGentile cemetery, Catholic cemetery. They couldn\u2019t bury them because Jewish\npeople, so they were in the field buried, and with little sticks, you know, who they\nare, that\u2019s all. And I came there, was there a chaplain, a Jewish chaplain from the\narmy. His name was Jakov(ph) Katzman(ph), yes, and he gave me right away a\nAugust 5, 1999\njob, you are going to work. So, he says, since you don\u2019t know English, he spoke to\nme Yiddish, I have there in the hospital there \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a hospital, just sol \u2014 you\nknow, with a couple doctors for the army, army doctors. And to clean off there and\nhelp along, give him this and that. And he gave somebody a needle, and I fainted,\nbecause I saw blood. Here I was sleep on dead bodies, here I saw a little blood and I\nfainted. And then I stood there [indecipherable] he gave another one a needle,\ncause they gave inoculation, I faint again, so I went out. I told the chaplain I can\u2019t\nwork there, fainting all the time I see blood. So he gave me a job to the officers\u2019\nkitchen, which I help clean pots and pans, help in baking pies. And when I saw the\nmeats, what they cut away the fat, meat and everything, I says why, this the best,\nthey throw this away? The big cans that we filled them, filling from the pies they\nthrew away. I says, what are you doing, my God [indecipherable] food. And on the\nnext day I started stealing oranges. I saw, and I saw food, I put in my pants, I bind\naround for the girls \u2014 to bring to that hospital for the girls [indecipherable]. So as I\nwalked around [indecipherable] there, one of the officers come over, what do you\nhave there? So I was really, you know, scared and this, and don\u2019t be scared, what do\nyou have there? I said, it\u2019s not for me, you know I\u2019m not hungry, I eat here all the\nfood. It\u2019s for the sick girls in the hospital. Take this \u2014 everything out here. Come\nwith me. He took me on a Jeep, he took me to the American PX. He took a big\nAugust 5, 1999\nsack, he put in \u2014 what you like from here? He put in chocolate, he put in soap, he\nput in toothpicks. He took a \u2014 he says, don\u2019t you steal, you come to me every time.\nWe know girls, we know about them, we help them. Anytime come to me and I\ngive you plenty. And he gave me chocolates. And I have the nice experience,\nbecause on the third floor in the hospital was a very sick girl. And there were four\nsisters. They were the best friends of my sister in camp in Gruenberg. They were\nGerman girls. And they were with her, and I brought them chocolates and oranges\nevery day and more. But what\u2019s coincident \u2014 I want to interrupt, which it\u2019s going to\ncome later, that this is the Ebi(ph) sisters. She died late, late in September. When no\nmore girls were there they took us out from there, they couldn\u2019t \u2014 so they remained\nthere, and she died there, she is buried in the cemetery. And I gave a talk before\ngoing for the 50\" anniversary to Volary, with survivors from the hospital we came\nfor a gathering there. I gave a talk on the synagogue, and I gave a talk a \u2014 by the end\nof [indecipherable] I told them I\u2019m going to Volary for the 50\" anniversary, I\u2019m\ninvited by the mayor of the city since I was there in the hospital with those girls, I\nwas the only boy between 120 girls, and I am going back there. Suddenly I hear\nbursting out to cry, a young lady start to cry. So I walked over to her and I says,\nwhy are you crying? She says, my mother\u2019s sister died there. So \u2014 and she told me\nthe story, and she told me who were they and this and this and this, how old. So\nAugust 5, 1999\nwhen I came home, was 10:30 at night, I called up Suzanna Budzelis(ph), she\nworked with me in the archives in [indecipherable]. I said, Suzanna, can you tell\nme the names of the girls, if you have anything? Oh yeah, they were three sisters,\neverything, they \u2014 th-th \u2014 this and this \u2014 they \u2014 they [indecipherable] on this, and I\ncalled up 12 o\u2019clock this woman, she is the wife of a rabbi. I don\u2019t know, they were\nyounger. I says, look, they registered older to be safe, not to send them to the\ncrematorium but to a war. And we became good friends. But when I came back\nfrom Volary, I brought the pictures of the grave and I gave her the pictures. And\nthen she told me her aunt lives in New York, another aunt. So I took the number, I\ncalled her up. I says \u2014 I called up, she didn\u2019t remember anything. I says, so you\ndon\u2019t remember I came there? You were there? I was the only boy. I says, the only\nboy what was there, his name was Moniek. I told her Morris, that\u2019s why she\n[indecipherable]. And he brought me chocolate for \u2014 for us every day with\noranges, yes, that\u2019s me. And she burst out crying. And we became the best friends\nthat all the time she calls me, every holiday. Well, I\u2019m going to continue. We were\nthere for not too long, about eight weeks. A lot of the girls went back home, one of\nthe girls [indecipherable] we go back to Poland [indecipherable] which I liked it,\nI didn \u2014 no, I\u2019m going to stay. So one of the girls, Regina Chepelska(ph), she is\nfrom Sosnowiec, says Moniek, let\u2019s go somewhere, we all the time here, let\u2019s go\nAugust 5, 1999\nvisit other cities. Okay. We went on the train and we came to Zvolin(ph), a city.\nThe train wouldn\u2019t go no further because it was demolish, you know, the railroad\ntracks have a thing, stopped here and we had to walk. And this was about one\no\u2019clock in the morning. And we didn\u2019t know where to go. We asked somebody\nwhere can we go to sleep over, an hotel or something, and it was the motorman\nfrom the train. He had the bike, he ro \u2014 he took her \u2014 since she was a young girl we\ntold them we were brother and sister, cause we were afraid, we are from camp. He\ntook her on the bike, he walked with them, we walked for about five kilometers. We\narrived about \u2014 after two in the morning. He woke up a 80 year old mother, he woke\nup, make some fire and some food, they are from camp, they are hungry, you got to\ngive them food. We were shocked. So first of all she got up, made fire and put up\nfor a soup. And she made the heavy \u2014 where you wash clothing, you know, you\nlaundry. You put hot water in the laundry, wash yourself, yeah. We washed\nourselves, gave clean towels, everything. We sat down at the table with a tablecloth,\ngave us soup, and then she gave us a room with beds, we went to sleep. In the\nmorning he said he wanted to adopt. He was a bachelor and no kids, no nothing, he\nwanted to adopt her. And to \u2014 with me, he says, you are going to be here and he\ntook me right away, what do you know, what kind pro-professionally. I said, well, I\nwas painting at camp, in the ghetto. Good. He took me to a factory where they make\nAugust 5, 1999\ntoys and I painted toys, designs and everything what was outlined, painted in\ndifferent colors. I was there for three days and she \u2014 and he gave me a room in a\nhotel which \u2014 enough money to pay, I made enough money to pay, it wasn\u2019t too\nexpensive. And she was behind there, he wanted to adopt her. I says, Regina, I\u2019m\ngoing back somewhere, because I met someone, another Jewish guy there, we are\ngoing to go. Okay, we will meet up. So I said goodbye to her and I went back to\nVolary. She came back two days later. I asked the Rabbi Katzner(ph) to check, I\nsays, do me a favor. Can you find out about the Jewish girls, Bella(ph) Sigler(ph)\nand the others? I told [indecipherable] they are from this transport, they\n[indecipherable] in the hospital. He says, I go today. He came back a couple hours\nlater, all four died. All four girls died from typhus. And I was very sad about it. And\nthen my brother-in-law came, he found me. He says, I told you I\u2019m going to find\nyou. We were there for days, he went [indecipherable] you stay with them, I\u2019m\ngoing to Salzburg. Couple days later came a order that they have to leave the \u2014 that\nthe Russian army is going to take over Volary, and the Germa \u2014 and the American\narmy had to evacuate. So the army, the American army came with three trucks, they\ntook us by trucks to Salzburg. We arrived there because there was already men, the\nwomen separate to the Riedenburg caserna(ph), and the girls didn\u2019t want to even\nknow, Moniek is going to stay with us. He is to with us in the same \u2014 in the same\nAugust 5, 1999\nroom, slept there and everything. They made a curtain just for me to sleep. We\nwon\u2019t go in without Moniek. So I was there for two days with them and I says no,\nit\u2019s no use, I have to go where the men sleep, I can\u2019t be with you. But we became\nvery close. We \u2014 particularly we \u2014 about eight girls and me, which consider like\nbrother, sister. That\u2019s how we loved each other, not as boy - girl. You know, two of\nthem were from my city, one was an \u2014 one of the youngest girls, I won\u2019t mention\nthe name, you know, in case they don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t know if I should or not. I can\ntell the names, one was Rozia(ph) Szalinga(ph) from Tarnow, Lidi(ph)\nZilbigger(ph) from Auschwitz. Was Halinka(ph) Goldberg, she was from\nCzestochowa, [indecipherable] from Benzburg(ph), Halla(ph) Malnavitsa from\nDabrowa. Cheva(ph) Chet(ph) from Dabrowa [indecipherable] what the sister\ndied there, and my best \u2014 my best friend\u2019s sister, to our \u2014 we held ourself very close.\nAnd we were \u2014 then they transported over to New Palestine. We had the\n[indecipherable] we were in the DP camp New Palestine, Salzburg. And sudden\nthey ask me can they go, we are going for dances, they all time ask me can we go,\ncome along. So I went with them and we went to Ebensee and [indecipherable].\nThere were some survivors from other camps, from Mauthausen. So we went there\nbecause they have dances, I went there with them. We had a good time, we came\nback. As I came back, somebody told me, your brother\u2019s here. That I found my\nAugust 5, 1999\nyounger brother, Josef. He came from hunger \u2014 from Budapest. He was with\nanother guy from my city and woke him up during the night, I couldn\u2019t recognize\nhim, cause he was all kinds of skinny. He was blown up. [indecipherable] can be\nvery blown up from all the soups they ate [indecipherable] everything, you know,\nfrom camp. He was in Auschwitz and then Gintagruber(ph) and the death march.\nHe was liberated in fact, the 11\" of May, two days after the war. They found him\nthere with the SS wandering. And for over a thousand people there were only 14\nthat remained alive. My older brother, Srulek(ph) and him. And you can imagine\nhow happy and everything. Then about a week later came my best friend what I told\nyou the [indecipherable] he was in Bergen-Belsen, he came pi \u2014 to pick up his\nsister [indecipherable] he is alive. And I was there til \u201946. In \u201946 I had the \u2014 the \u2014\nmy sister, my older sister Ruchcia, which she escape to the Soviet Union from the\nghetto out. She\u2019s in Regensburg, so I went there to Regensburg, I saw her and I\nsaid, let\u2019s go move to Vidin(ph), I should go over there and come. So we\n[indecipherable] Salzburg, we smuggled ourselves to the border. And I forgot to\ntell you that in my room in Salzburg, I have three rooms, and I was with my\nbrother and another guy that worked in the kitchen, from the UNRRA kitchen that\nwe had the food in the camp. And every night I have guests in my room, which they\nprobably half [indecipherable] from Germany to smuggle them over to Italy and\nAugust 5, 1999\ngo to Palestine. And in fact I went with them twice to the border, to Ironing(ph),\nFrylass(ph) and [indecipherable], also over some of the people, so it was a\ntransition camp, because I went to sleep by my friends and I gave them the three\nrooms, food I had enough.",
        "A: Was in \u201945 and \u201946. And came to Salzburg a young girl with a friend of hers\nfrom my city and she told me my sister is alive. That she know. Karla Lunda(ph),\nyeah. Well, you can imagine, I was there and she went away, she said she is going\nillegal, she is going with the bubbichar(ph) and we said goodbye, she left me a\npicture. About a week later I get a telegram from Poland, from a friend from my\nsister that they both escape together from the death march. Back to Gruenberg they\nwent, to German people they went. And their life, well, that\u2019s all I knew. This was\nthe telegram which I still have it, and I\u2019m going to give this to the museum. And\nwhen I heard my other sister is alive, so we packed ourself, went to \u2014 with a\ntransport to Ulin, to camp also a DP camp in Ulin(ph). And then we smuggled\nourself out from Ulin(ph) because we couldn\u2019t go anything without \u2014 from the\nUNRRA you know what they tell you where to go, this \u2014 and we came to\n[indecipherable] house where my sister was. And I met my sister, so we got a\nprivate room, we lived with my sister together. Her husband was the president from\nAugust 5, 1999\nthe Jewish community in Vidin(ph) and we have some volunteers in this museum,\nthey were also invited there. My friend from my city William Luxembourg, or\nHelen Luxembourg if you know. I know them, they were married there and we\nwere good friends there. And I was there for awhile, then my other sister that\nescaped what I knew she\u2019s alive. And what happened why we didn\u2019t see her before,\nwhen she ran away, she went with the Russian army to Russia to look for my older\nsister, she knew she escaped to Russia, looking for her [indecipherable]. And then\nshe went back to Danzig with her friend, and then she came \u2014 she came to\nVidin(ph) which I met her too. And \u2014",
        "A: How \u2014 what happened \u2014 don\u2019t forget at that time, wherever you were in a camp,\na DP camp, or you met a friend, leave a note that I am alive. And people\n[indecipherable]. For instance, the girl, Karla Lunda(ph) [indecipherable]\nSalzburg, she got somebody in Poland let them know that I am in Salzburg. That\u2019s\nhow I got the telegram. And my older brother, he was in Prague, he went in fact to\npick up my youngest sister, Bluma from Poland, how, he didn\u2019t have anything, you\nknow how it was. And what I forgot to tell you, a very interesting story in Volary,\nwhich I go back. Very interesting. I didn\u2019t have no shoes, I still walk around in my\nAugust 5, 1999\nwooden shoes. [indecipherable] So one of the officers, while I walk in the officers\u2019\nkitchen, he looked at me, he says, hop into the Jeep, come with me Moniek. And \u2014\nwhere we going? You will see. We arrived in [indecipherable], he took me to the\nstation. He knew that the Czech people threw out all the Germans, the same thing\nlike they did to the Czechs, the Germans from the Sudetenland threw out the\nCzechs, now they threw out the Germans, and they let them have 10 kilo in their\nbags, that\u2019s all they were allowed to take. So we saw there a lot of people with\nboots and everything. He goes over to one, a ex-German officer, maybe it was an\nSS man, take off your boots. Put them on Moniek. About on the fifth person, they\nfit good. He took my wooden shoes, gave them. You took away more from him. He\nwore this for many years, now you can wear them. Then he took away the camera\nfrom him, with film. He says, you took away more from him than a camera. And\nwith this camera I took pictures in the hospital with the girls there. I took about 80\npictures, I have so much film. And the historical pictures from the girls laying in the\nhospital, the girls [indecipherable] which they \u2014 now you can see them in the\nmuseum, which I gave a whole book fr \u2014 just from Volary with my friends being in\nbed sick, they are now there, these historical pictures. That\u2019s what I forgot to tell\nyou. When we were in Salzburg, I forgot to tell you, I went to see the girls when\nthey went dancing there with their friend. And going to Barbishel(ph), we stopped\nAugust 5, 1999\nin Ebensee. And another triangle, which the trains divided, one train went to Linz,\none the directions that I have to go, and one to [indecipherable]. And when I stood\nthere, we went in there to the men\u2019s room, it was outside, they didn\u2019t have no, you\nknow, in the stations. As I walk out from there, in come there, stood at the train\ncomes a German policeman with me \u2014 with a invalid \u2014a POW, a German POW on\none foot. And he said, you took this man\u2019s vallit(ph), which is release papers, a\nPOW, money, everything. I says, are you crazy? Well, you just came out there from\nthe toilet, and he was there. And he wanted to take out everything from pocket and\nmy \u2014 my other friend were a big guy. He says, you are going to tell me what to do?\nDamn Nazi, he called him, and he wouldn\u2019t do it. So he called the MP. The MP,\ncome with us. He took us in a Jeep to the constable, you know. I come in there, was\na officer and a officer at the desk. Beautiful, tall guy, handsome as can be. Take out\neverything from the pockets. I took out from the pockets. Why do you have\nAmerican scrip? Are you on black market? I says, I work for the American army\nand they pay me with scrip and that\u2019s what I have. He took it away on the side.\nThen I have what an American soldier gave me, a Jewish soldier in Volary. This\nYankee division, the Y. He took this away. And he saw pictures that I\u2019m with the\nsoldiers, with the girls, the American soldiers, this he left me. I says, how come you\nhave so many coupons, for bread and this, you know, for ya \u2014 I says, it happened to\nAugust 5, 1999\nbe that I am with eight girls and I do the buying and I do everything for them, and\nthat\u2019s why I have so many coupons here. Didn\u2019t believe me. They took us away to a\nprison. We come into the prison on third floor, there are Nazis there. Locked up.\nWe started banging at the door, what it 1s. I says, we just came out from the Nazis\nand they put us like that. There were German guards there, by the way\n[indecipherable]. So they took us on the second floor, who was there? Prostitutes.\nStill better. Yeah, locked up. So, we had to sleep in the hall, they don\u2019t have no\nother place, and we were there three days. They \u2014 I gave them the information that I\nam in Salzburg, in New Palestine, gave them there everything information. They\ntook three days to find out who we are and if we are live there, if we tell the truth.\nThree days. After three days with the Jeep they come and they took us back to the \u2014\nto the station. There was my stuff he gives me back, but the scrip and the Yankee\ndivision [indecipherable] and he give us for the trouble two carton cigarettes. I\ntook the cigarettes, stepped them down and I spit in his face. I says, you damn Nazi,\nyou put me with the doxies in camp. Well, what he\u2019s going to do to me? And I spit\nin his face. And \u2014 but this was far to go to the station, wait, 1f somebody go. We\ndon\u2019t need your help, you worse than the Nazis \u2014 because it\u2019s after the war \u2014 and we\nwalked out. What that incident happen, that coming back from Barbishel(ph), I\nwalked into the same toilet. I said, let me look. Maybe he lost that son-of-a-gun\nAugust 5, 1999\nthere. And there was a big stall where you stepped on it \u2014 you sit on it \u2014 to \u2014 you\nknow \u2014 and I see something sticking out, and it was his portfolio under the stall, he\nlost it. I threw it and I didn\u2019t even look anything, I threw it into the toilet right away.\nBut what\u2019s interesting, that was the first high holidays, Rosh Hashonah in\nSalzburg. And they \u2014 they took in the [indecipherable] where they have the\n[indecipherable] there for the American soldiers, the Rainbow division what they\ncalled it. They had services for the high holidays. So displaced persons came for the\nhigh holidays for the first time. I sit down there \u2014 I came with one of the girls, and\nsit down and I look at that beautiful dressed \u2014 that son-of-a-gun that send me to the\nprison, to the Nazis, that was behind the desk. And I looked up at him, you Nazi,\nyou in the synagogue? And I looked at him, and I walked away and went all the\nway to the back. He look at me, and I walked over again. You get out from the\nsynagogue, you Nazi. He \u2014 he didn't answer anything. They weren\u2019t nice. That\u2019s\nthat \u2014 that\u2019s what hurts still today, that 1t hurts. And he didn\u2019t know what to answer.\nHe probably did his duties, but he should at \u2014 understand better, with Jewish\nprisoners where he sent, and took three days to found. Well, anyway, I was in\nVidin(ph). Then \u2014 then was transports there and there came a gentleman by the\nname of Haskell(ph) Gansfy(ph), and he came from camp to camp, DP cam-camp,\nto take people [indecipherable] to go to Palestine, to fight for Israel, to go to\nAugust 5, 1999\nPalestine with, you know, wi-with the underground and you\u2019re going to be in\nPalestine. So my youngest sister went. And it happened that she went on the\nExodus. She went with friends and friend she met \u2014 the same person Yehaskel(ph)\nBenzef(ph), wi \u2014 they got on board and they were on the Exodus, when \u2014 she told\nme stories, they came to Palestine, they had to go back. When she came back she\nwas first in Aachen, and from Aachen she came back to Vidin(ph), naked\n[indecipherable] because when he left we bought her clothing, everything, she only\nhad one dress, that\u2019s all. We had to buy her everything new again, and she was there\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nAugust 5, 1999\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And then she had to go back because they \u2014 she got a note that she got to come\nback because there was hope that they\u2019re gonna go to Palestine, evident, so we\nbought her new clothing, everything and she went back and in fact they went \u2014 they\nwere the first ones, because from the Exodus people had priority even from\nCyprus, that they went first. And she met her husband there on the ship, which they\ngot married, they went to Palestine, and of course he went right away to war there\nwhen he arrived, cause he was a officer in the Russian army. And then my o \u2014 when\nIsrael became a state, my other sister, Mrs. Beilauer(ph) which [indecipherable]\nname was, and he left Vidin(ph), he was the president from the Jewish community,\nhe left Vidin(ph) and I have pictures of course, how with flowers the whole\ncommunity there send her off, and they went to Israel. And then I heard news that a\nAugust 5, 1999\ngood friend of mine lived with me in Vidin(ph), he was Shlamik(ph) Merin(ph)\nfrom Benzburg(ph) [indecipherable] that when he went illegal to Palestine\nthrough Marseilles, and he \u2014 he got off the ship, in the first [indecipherable] he\ndidn\u2019t even see anything of Israel that he got killed. They send him toward\nJerusalem, he didn\u2019t even see his \u2014 anything. And I still have the death\nannouncement from the paper, from the Jewish paper, I still have it at home. And so\nwe supposed to go also to Israel, Palestine. So my brother said, look here, we lived\nthrough a war. We lost so much from our family. We have two aunts in New York,\nmy father\u2019s sisters. If we go to Palestine, we can\u2019t go to America later. If we in\nAmerica we can all time go \u2014 time go to Israel. So we decided we are going to go\nwait out, and we got affidavits from my aunts, and with the help from the HIAS, we\ncame to Bremen, it was October, this was two days before Rosh Hashonah. We\ncame to New York, and what happened, we have to get inoculation against all kind\ndiseases, everything. And since I was all the time fainting from the needle and\neverything, all in my possession I have this 50 dollar, that\u2019s all what I have. I gave\nthe nurse in Bremen the 50 dollar, please mark that everything is there, I was\npetrified for the needle. She took it, wrote everything down, I took all the needles,\neverything.\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Life in the DP camps, it wasn\u2019t bad. It depends where you were. For instance,\nNew Palestine. We were very close-knit from the camp. We \u2014 we knew each other,\nwe went out dan \u2014 that we had dances there, and pa \u2014 especially I went to \u2014 in\nSalzburg, I went to every new show, any new operetta. What happened, you\ncouldn\u2019t get tickets there, they were very hard. But, if you bribe the cashier, you\nhave it. I bought her soap, I bought a stocking, which I got from the UNRRA. Soap,\nI gave her. So from the soap, other things, I got tickets. Every time when a new\nshow came, I had several tickets, as many as I want. And at the \u2014 almost every day I\nwent out somewhere, cause in camp, there was a lot to do [indecipherable] but I\nhad to go out, I liked to go out and what I missed out right during the war as a\nyoungster, I want to catch up. And I met several girls there, which of course one\nwanted to get married, but I said not in the DP. And I wouldn\u2019t do it, I \u2014 I not going\nto have a handout from the UNRRA. This was a Hungarian girl from Budapest.\nVery beautiful, intelligent girl. Anyway, she went to Palestine, she oh \u2014 from the\nAugust 5, 1999\nship she send me [indecipherable] even a letter, which I still have it, with the other\nthings. But she went to Palestine, I came to United States.",
        "A: Well, most of them about parents, about what they went through, everybody\n[indecipherable] through. And we had the paper there that we gave out a lot, and a\nlot of people wrote articles also. And th \u2014 we liked to make out for the lost time.\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s about it. What I tried \u2014 what I forgot to mention, right after the\nliberation, this was the worst time in my life, right after the liberation, cause during\nbeing in the camps, all what I thought is how to survive. Always I was thinking is\nonly to survive, and we didn\u2019t think anything about back home or anything. You\ndidn\u2019t have time to think. But after the liberation, then came back, where do I go? I\ndon\u2019t see my parents. This one\u2019s missing, that one\u2019s missing. Then I realize, I\nbecame again a person, with my mind and this was the worst time, and I was very,\nvery nervous. And even when I came to the United States, for the first three years,\nall I did is taking pills and pills and pills til one doctor told me, you want to live?\nPut away the pills. You can do without them. Then I made up my mind and I\nstopped taking the pills, and I \u2014 and I start living a normal life. But this was in the\nUnited States.\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: I forgot. This was in the 50\u2019s. What was it for nerves, the pills that they gave?",
        "A: Sedative. But what got me that the doctor even charged me for every pill. He had\nit as samples and he charged me 10 cents for each pill.",
        "A: Well, I knew in camp already what happened to my parents. In camp, because a\ntransport in \u00b044 came from Auschwitz to our camp, and it was a \u2014 and it was one\nfrom our city [indecipherable] Levenstein(ph). And he says, oh your father\u2019s alive\nbecause they have it good in Auschwitz, because they were in [indecipherable]\nand because they had a little bit more food, yeah. And for him it was good, but the\nparents, they\u2019re not alive, and he told me about the burning and everything and the\nextermination. So I knew already this, I knew everything. But we didn't know to\nwhat extent. I couldn\u2019t believe at that time to what extent, because here, okay, there\nwere killings in the camp and everything, but we didn't see, in our camp was no\nburn or extermination, anything, it just that people died from hunger and from\nbeating. And I was very good at that. I never got the beating, only once, because I\nwas short and I never stood in front in the lines, all the time the middle, and all ki \u2014\npicked tall guys that they should be in front of me. When they hit I was all time\nAugust 5, 1999\nbend down and I n \u2014 I never got hit. I was selfish. But everybody looked to survive,\nthat\u2019s what it was.\nAugust 5, 1999\nthey\u2019re known for it. And then what was going on, we marched there, we protested\na lot. I don\u2019t know if you remember with Belvin(ph), they didn\u2019t let the Jewish\npeople to Palestine, we protested, and we wrote in. I wrote a letter also to the\nUnited Nations, which I still have copies of it. Not [indecipherable] but then the\nExodus ship and everything, I think that\u2019s what helped Israel to become a nation.",
        "A: Yes, because my brother-in-law, my sister\u2019s husband, he was a Jewish, the only\nJewish correspondent from the DP camps, in fact, and he covered all the\nNuremberg trials. I was there six times because he took \u2014 he was able to take along\nas guests two people. And I gave one to the museum and I still have one of the entry\ncards. And I saw everybody there. The sessions, I even have the numbers of the\nsessions there. Nuremberg was everything demolish except the building where the\ntr \u2014 the international tribunal was there, was standing. And in fact, I was \u2014 this year\nalso there, I went back to the [indecipherable] cause I exhibited Nuremberg my\nexhibit this year, and I went to the courthouse there. I took even pictures how it\nlooks now, I recognized the buildings right away when I came there.\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: I went for the main trial. I saw Goering, Keitel, everybody and when I saw on\ntelevision the things I was looking if I can see my brother-in-law there, because he\nhad good connections with Redenko, which it was the Russian prosecutor. And he\ntried to listen to the American prosecutor there, in fact, we had breakfast with\nRedenko, which I am sorry I never took a picture, he was very good friend with\nhim, yes. And in fact, my brother-in-law was one of the first ones that wrote a book\nabout [indecipherable] like sheep to the slaughter, in the 50\u2019s. And he wrote a lot\nof articles in the Jewish papers and a lot of articles to the [indecipherable] that he\ncovered the \u2014 the trials. But he never got any money or anything, he never ask for\nmoney or anything. Yes, and \u2014 and now we want to know about me coming to\nUnited States.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, the politics of that, that in every DP camps we screamed and we wrote\narticles, we send away to United Nations that we lost everybody, we live still on\nAugust 5, 1999\nthe bloody soil, that we can\u2019t walk on it to go back to Poland. We can\u2019t, they killing\nJews again. And we don\u2019t have no place to go. The only place we want is to have\nour own Jewish homeland, and that was that. I remember one act in Salzburg which\nI can never forget. There was two cousins, they survived the war, and one of them\nhad a carton of cigarettes with him. And the [indecipherable] policeman ask him\nwhat he have here. He didn\u2019t want to show him and he es \u2014 he ran away. As he ran\naway, he shot him dead. And at that time, all the DP camps, Linz, Ebensee, all\naround Austria, from Polking(ph), they wanted to come here and do something,\ndamage to Salzburg. And the [indecipherable] police, because it was a policeman\nthat shot him, and the MP, hide away. They covered every road leading to\nSalzburg, trucks or cars, because a lot of trucks came with DPs from Linz. There\nwere partisans a lot, that they used to be partisans. They came with hammers, they\ncame even with weapons, what everything, and we wanted to do something to\ndemolish Salzburg. And they knew about it. So when the funeral came, they\nshipped back the people, they didn\u2019t let him in [indecipherable] they didn\u2019t let\nthem, they stood at the train stations. They didn\u2019t let no \u2014 no DP person, no Jewish\nperson into Salzburg. And they covered the whole funeral march, we were\ncordoned off by the military police. We had to go in the middle of the road, they\ndidn\u2019t let nobody out. And we couldn\u2019t \u2014 we couldn\u2019t let out our anger to anything.\nAugust 5, 1999\nBut we came to the cemetery, there was one house, which it was the caretaker\u2019s, I\nthink, and we put the house to fire. Which, I have pictures from the funeral, they\u2019re\nhere in the museum, which I gave them. We attended the funeral, I will never forget\nthis. And that policeman, he ran away from Salzburg, cause we said we are going\nto kill all the police there. But, we couldn\u2019t do anything. There were the happenings,\nwhat was. I remember coming to Munich. In the Munich was a march, which I still\nhave the papers, which the Germans show what the Jews did there. They also\nstarting demonstrating and \u2014 and beating up some Germans and things. And \u2014\nbecause it was near Dachau, they wanted to march to Dachau, they didn\u2019t allow.\nBut I heard demonstrations in Munich from displaced person people, they came\nfrom all over. And I used to go from camp to camp if I can meet anything. That\u2019s\nwas the main thing. I went to Feldafing, I went to Landsberg, I went to\nErfort(ph), which I found in each camp some old friends, people from our city. I\nmet at this station in Frankfurt, a young girl, used to be friends with my sister, and\nshe gave me a picture, in fact, from her sister on it, and another one a neighbor and\nmy niece. And this picture was in the Red Cross, on the pamphlets advertising the\nRed Cross, the Holocaust [indecipherable] and I gave it also here to the museum.\nAnd that\u2019s the stories. Wherever I came, I met some people. And finally, when we\nhad the chance to go to the United States, I said I had enough. I don\u2019t want to see\nAugust 5, 1999\nany more Germany or anything and I would never go back. And came to the\nUnited States. When I came to the United States, the first thing 1s I went to my\naunts. They waited for me, we came with the [indecipherable] ship. And\neverybody got sick, seasick, throw up. I think I was the only one walking around\nlaughing, and I was the only one eating. When nobody could eat food, I was the\nonly one. I had with me two watches that I took along to have some. So one of the\ncrew people says, they going to arrest you, you can\u2019t have two watches. He just\nwanted one watch. He gave me 20 dollar, which the watch cost me over a hundred,\nand I had to give it up. But then I talk, I was foolish, I was just taken, it was too late.\nTwo days before we arrive to United States, what everybody got already well,\nwhen you should have see the screams in the morning on the ship. Everybody was\nlaying on the decks, on the floor, why did I come to die on the sea? Why couldn\u2019t\nwe die there in Europe? That\u2019s was the feeling of everybody. When everybody got\nwell, even my brother got well, I came with my brother together, I got start on\ngetting sick. So I didn\u2019t have a good arrival in New York. When came to New\nYork, my two aunts waited for me already with my brother. And I can never\nforgive them, they were so nice, too nice, they want to do something for us. We\ndidn\u2019t even go home, straight from the ship she went Fifth Avenue, bought for my\nbrother, myself, hats with silk shawls, with shirts. Wanted me to try on a suit, I was\nAugust 5, 1999\nsick like dog still. And I couldn\u2019t tell them anything, they wanted to be nice and we\ncame to the house, it was on the \u2014 prepared a big dinner. And right away, you are\ngonna be my children, you are not going to work any more in your life no more.\nYou are going to live with us, you don\u2019t have to put a finger in cold water, which I\ndidn\u2019t like it, I like to be independent. I stood there with my brother for two weeks.\nThen I went for one week to my nephew. What I forgot to tell you, my nephew, it\u2019s\nmy older sister\u2019s son, he was in Vienna, translator to General Clark, and then he\nwas translator for the American army in Vienna. In Vienna as you know, there\nwere all four, the Russians, the French, the English and the Americans. So every\nmorning they have all four on one she \u2014 if you saw on the newsreel something. And\nhe was the one, whenever they gave him orders what to do, where to go, he\ntranslated him in French, into English, into German. And I have a lot of pictures\nhim translating everything when they have the meetings, and he was the translator\nthere as a young boy. I mean, I was very proud of him. Once he came to Salzburg\nwith a young girl, she was only 14 years or 15 years old, Herta(ph) Weiss(ph). She\nwas in Stutthof in camp, in Riga in camp, which was written a book and the picture\nher father, that her father got shot there. It\u2019s a whole story, a separate story about\nher. And he came to me, introduced me that we are going to get married. I says,\nyou\u2019re crazy, he\u2019s a kid. Fell in love with her. He traced her all the way from\nAugust 5, 1999\nBudapest with her mother here. And he was \u2014 later on he found out through a\nfriend, a Russian major, he says, Tom \u2014 his name is also Moniek, after my\ngrandfather\u2019s name, but he changed his name. Tom, now, he says, you got to\nescape, because the Russians wanted to take you over to the Soviets. At that time\nthey caught, you know, a lot of people, special kind of people, and so right away he\nlet know his superiors, was during the night, it didn\u2019t take five minutes, they\ncordoned off the [indecipherable] where he lived, Jeeps with military and they\nbrought him over to Munich. From Munich him and his wife right away to the\nUnited States. And, went to United States, first job was \u2014 his first job was going\nfrom the army camp to army camp in the States, he got 50 dollar for each talk, then\nhe said, I got sick of these things and everything. He went to work for the HIAS,\nand then he wanted to go to the Columbia University. At that time, \u201947, they didn\u2019t\ntake many Jews to Columbia, and of course as a refugee, so he wrote a article in\nthe paper and the director from Columbia called him up. He \u2014 after talk with him,\nhe was accepted. He was accepted and he was accepted and for international law,\nand then si \u2014 going seven years. He made it in three years with scholarships and\nwhen I came to the States I stood with him, also for a week, which they were so\nnice to me, everything. And then I said I got to get away from New York, cause my\naunt said you are not going to work no more. Every day she tried to buy me thing\nAugust 5, 1999\nand everything, I want to be independent. And I have the older brother, which lived\nin Palestine, and he married a girl from Baltimore, that they came back when the\nwar broke out in \u201948, they have two sons. Since she was a United States citizen she\nwas scared. They burned \u2014 they burned their store in Jaffa, they were the only\nJewish people in Jaffa, the Jewish store, in back, and so I came to Baltimore.",
        "A: I came to New York in September.",
        "A: And this was in \u201949. September 49, I came. And I remember I went \u2014 was Rosh\nHashanah time that I went for the first time to the synagogue, which I couldn\u2019t get\na ticket and then this, you know, but who cared if we stood and prayed outside the\nsynagogue? And then I came to Baltimore, was about six weeks later, I didn\u2019t want\nto stay any more there, although I could have gotten a job in New York and I was\nintroduced to someone in New York, I [indecipherable] about it. And I came, was\n\u2014 was around November 1949, I came to Baltimore.",
        "A: Yeah.\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: Yes. Well, first of all, my impression was tremendous. What I failed to tell you \u2014\nI told you that my aunt took me right away out to Fifth Avenue, and after dinner I\nwas So tired out I couldn\u2019t sleep for a month. She took us to Radio City Music Hall\nthe first evening. And I was so ashamed because I was afraid to fall asleep and\nevery minute I fell asleep, even at this beautiful show that I never saw such a big\ntheater, it made such impression on me, that\u2019s the one in the world, the Radio City\nMusic Hall. And here I had to sleep, and after that, after we walked out from there,\nhalf asleep so tired, she took us to Lindy\u2019s. And I couldn\u2019t eat because I felt more\nlike giving everything out, I was still sick. And after Lindy\u2019s, we finally came\nhome. And I brought with me, that I bought a set of dishes from [indecipherable]\nGerman dishes. When I looked the things that she had in her home, I was ashamed.\nI was ashame I brought such a junk, I [indecipherable]. So during the night I went\nwith my brother and took the whole cage with the dishes and dumped it in the\noutside, near the dumpster, and blankets and everything. She went out in the\nmorning, says, did you dump anything there? She says, if you don\u2019t want it, I take.\nSuch a beautiful dishes and you dump? We was \u2014 we were ashamed that this 1s\nAugust 5, 1999\ngarbage, we didn\u2019t want \u2014 yeah, but she\u2019s \u2014 she had the [indecipherable] yes. And",
        "A: Well, they ask me when I came over here, first of all I told them I\u2019m a painter,\nbecause [indecipherable] some. My brother, he spent all the money what we had in\nGermany, and he learn typewriting machines to fix. And all the money what we\nhad except the 50 dollar that I spent \u2014 I gave the nurse, I spent on the newest, most\nmodern equipment to make parts for machines \u2014 for typewriting machines. Well, we\ncame here, so I got right away a job, I took a job in painting, because I knew\npainting, which I got, by the way, 18 dollar a week. My brother couldn\u2019t get a job.\nHe called up Remington, says oh yeah, we need mechanics. When he came there,\nthey found out he is Jewish, oh no, we don\u2019t have anybody. So they wouldn\u2019t take\nJewish people there, Remington. So he went to the HIAS, they got him a job\nthrough Ebertz(ph) machine on balt \u2014 on Baltimore Street \u2014 on Fayette Street in\nBaltimore. When he came down there he came with his tools and everything, he\nsaid he\u2019s \u2014 he got his license, that he\u2019s one of the best mechanics, worked several\nyears in Germany, paid money, went \u2014 so he said, well, we don\u2019t need such a\nmechanics. You see the shelves here? If something is missing, you see the\nAugust 5, 1999\nnumbers? We have parts, everything. We don\u2019t need [indecipherable]. It made him\nfeel like two cents. So he got 12 dollar a week for his work. He [indecipherable]\nup. And it was very often [indecipherable]. I cried every day, I wanted to go back.\nFirst of all, I didn\u2019t know nobody. Then when I had an apartment to get in, so s \u2014\nthere I work \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to stay by my brother, because the sister-in-law wasn\u2019t\nso well, she was an American, she had a different view and everything, and \u2014 and I\nsaw that I am not welcome, so I said, I want right away an apartment. So the first\napartment wen \u2014 my brother said, okay here, it\u2019s \u2014 we looked in the paper. It was a\nshoemaker\u2019s store, on the back of the store there was [indecipherable]. So I says, I\ndidn\u2019t come to the United States and live like this, worse than even a camp, near a\nshoemaker with the smell and everything. I went on my own and I found a room. I\nfound a nice room there and we moved in right away. This was Sunday morning,\nwe went right away to Reed\u2019s(ph) drugstore, we bought pots and pans. We went\nright away there to the grocery store, this was our cook meal the first day, on our\nown. The landlady was very nice, and Friday evening when she baked the cakes and\neverything, right away she brought in [indecipherable] which in the next morning\nit went to the garbage can. We were \u2014 I don\u2019t know, we were so that from\nsomebody\u2019s hands we didn't want to touch. It was foolish, but that\u2019s how we were,\nvery particular, that only on our own. And it was very, very tough on me. First of all\nAugust 5, 1999\nI had to go, I didn't know not a word of English. So I had to go to school, so I went\nto night school. After work nine, 10 hours a day, cause I wanted to get more hours\n[indecipherable]. Then my brother worked there, he only made 12 hours \u2014 12, I\nthink. After working for somebody, what happened that the men what we worked\ncouldn\u2019t mix the color for a person for a [indecipherable] that she wants a\nparticular color. And of course I knew colors very good and everything. So as he\nwent \u2014 as he went to get material \u2014 as he went to get material, I mix for her the\ncolor. Oh, that\u2019s exactly what I want. When he came back, she says, I want him to\ndo mixing the colors, everything. And she told me, why don\u2019t you go on your own?\nI says, I don\u2019t know nobody, I don\u2019t know the language or anything. She says, I\ngive you a customer. So I quit them and I got the customer on my own. From 18\ndollar, right away that she offered me 60. From 18 to 60 dollar, cause\n[indecipherable] a mechanic. So he says no. You didn\u2019t pay me right away, I don\u2019t\ndo it. And I walk myself up. Then I \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: How many \u2014\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nAugust 5, 1999\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Yes, yes. Then I went on my own to work, and I took my brother right away,\nwe're not going to work for 12 ah \u2014 12 dollar a week, you are going with me.\nWhatever is going to happen, is gonna happen. And it was very tough in the\nbeginning, with my English, although we went to school. And I decided I got to do\nsomething with me. First of all we wanted to get a grocery store. At that time almost\nevery survivor went into groceries, because they didn\u2019t have [indecipherable]. So\nwhile I was working, one of the nicest people was that person who was in charge of\nthe Exodus ship in Baltimore, Mr. Spierd(ph) which he\u2019s known. He was the one\nthat brought everything, and the ship was [indecipherable] right in Baltimore. And\nhis wife, she says no, you\u2019re too intelligent, you don\u2019t want to be a slave ina\ngrocery store. You\u2019re not married yet, you won\u2019t be able to find a girl. You don\u2019t\nwant to be shop. You go to school, continue and do what you\u2019re doing, never go to\na grocery. And I already had a lawyer and everything, we already got prepared to\nbuy this for everything, and I listened to her. Instead, I enlisted, I went to the\nMaryland Institute of Art, to the art school. I went seven years to the art school\nAugust 5, 1999\nfor interior design. I first graduated \u2014 honest, I was the only one in the ever class\never to get the medal, usually they give the medals for day school. I couldn\u2019t go day\nschool, I had to make a living. Worked during the day. I went post-graduate at\nseven years. Then the teacher told me, you have talent, I send you \u2014 which might\nnot cost you for scholarship, to New York. But what happened \u2014 and meanwhile I\ngot married already \u2014",
        "A: I met my wife at a blind date. And before I come to this, I want to tell you I was\nmiserable for the first year in the United States. I didn\u2019t know nobody. Baltimore\nwas like a little town. Every weekday \u2014 every Friday evening when I got my pay,\nwhen I had money, I ran to the train right away, and New York because I have a lot\nof friends. Baltimore was a little town. If you want to go out with somebody, you\nhave either to know them \u2014 you couldn\u2019t go to a dance like New York on your own,\nyou have to belong somewhere, wasn\u2019t as \u2014 even school, I was all the time called\nhere comes the greenhorn. I wasn\u2019t received not at all good. I went to the synagogue\non a Saturday, all the ti \u2014 oh, here\u2019s the greenhorn. I came for a sundae to a\ndrugstore [indecipherable] made fun because I didn\u2019t know so good English. So I\nlet them have it in German, and I said, it\u2019s miserable. They didn\u2019t treat the\nnewcomers at all good at that time. The American people were not at all\nAugust 5, 1999\n[indecipherable]. They \u2014 they treat us like third class, and I mean third class, that I\nwanted to go back to Europe. But, with the time I met my wife. I met her in \u201953, we\nwent for a year time. I met her already in \u201952. We went over a year time, and then\nMarch 31 we got married, to a Baltimorean girl, so was a little different. And I\nwork myself up, and I was looking for an apartment before, which it was very hard\nto get apartments because people thought we are going to have kids, they didn\u2019t\nwant [indecipherable]. And I worked there by a builder, na \u2014 and at that time, and I\nfinish a job early, so I went there to look for work for my own, to another builder.\nWhen I came in, he asked me what I am looking this house, [indecipherable] was\nthere a painting contract? And I couldn\u2019t say that I am looking for \u2014 for paint. So I\nsays, I am interested in a home buying. Okay. I ask him how much. It was 18 and a\nhalf thousand dollar home. And at that time thousand dollar, who had that kind of\nmoney [indecipherable]. Then I [indecipherable] suppose I don\u2019t finish this, and\nthis I will do on my own, not only my own painting, but finishing off a lot of the\nwalls and the bathrooms, knocked off this and this. He came down to about 15 and a\nhalf thousand dollar. Then I worked for this builder at that time, I did \u2014 for his\nprivate home, and I told him, he says, oh, he\u2019s a friend of mine, let me go. He came\nto him, he says, do something for him, and this and this. So he knocked it down\nanother 1500 dollar. So I said, instead of paying rent somewhere, looking for a\nAugust 5, 1999\nhouse, I gave a down payment. And I said, I am buying this home. On a Saturday I\ntook a ride, I took my future wife, I wasn\u2019t married then [indecipherable] who can\ndream [indecipherable] home. This was the first semi-detached homes in\nBaltimore, beautiful. I said, this 1s yours, this is a present, she couldn\u2019t believe.\nAnd I didn't have money for furniture, anything. And I had everything together with\nmy brother. One bankbook. It didn\u2019t matter what he makes, what a \u2014 I mean, when\nwe split up, when we went for our honeymoon to New York, when we came back, I\nonly had money for a bed and this. And of course she got some money from her\nparents, not much. And my brother, whatever we had money in the bank left, he\nbought a kitchen set, and he set up a bedroom, and we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t have any\nother furniture, but this came piece by piece. And unfortunately \u2014 or fortunately, I\nshould say, I have very expensive taste, which I Just wouldn\u2019t buy anything, I would\n\u2014 where I work, this was, I mean there lived the most richest people in \u2014 in\nMaryland, that\u2019s the customers I had. I was never listed in the phone book, I \u2014 this\nwas recommended [indecipherable] I was all the time three, four years lined up\nwith work before, I \u2014 and I didn't go everywhere, I just had a selected clientele.\nThen I wanted to go into interior design. Then I found out \u2014 that\u2019s what I graduated\nfrom \u2014 I didn\u2019t go to New York because I have already a home here. Got my wife\nhere, I couldn't \u2014 not start all over again. So, for interior design you got to have a lot\nAugust 5, 1999\nof money, you got to open a business, you got to have your own material, you got to\nhave a showcase, I just couldn\u2019t do. Then I was recommended to interior designer\nChambis(ph), which she was the most known in Baltimore, she told me okay, you\ncan. And I said no, I-I am a boss on my own, I\u2019m not going for somebody. So I\nwork myself up all alone, and you know, I hired a lot of men, and then I had my\nbuilder\u2019s work and I helped out decorating, which I got money for this too, but I\ncould never [indecipherable] for opening my own business for interior design. And\nI was happier with what I was doing and I was interested in my old hobby, this is\nphilately, stamps, which I started as a youngster six years old. I continued 1n the\nUnited States, this was by coincident. I went downtown Baltimore, I saw a stamp\nstore, it was something familiar to me, and I started again. And I came to join the\nclub in Baltimore, the philatelic club, which I was one of the first Jewish people to\njoin, because at that time there were only doctors and lawyers, only professionals,\nand I was actually the first one like to join with them. They liked me and I became\nright a member of the \u2014 there \u2014 the an \u2014 government of the \u2014 of the society. And I\nstarted also to put my collections together in topics to exhibit, and I was starting to\nget known internationally for my exhibit, my work. So \u2014",
        "A: This was philatelic exhibition, which I was specially interested in Olympics. I\nwas all the time following Olympic games in \u201936. This was the first Olympics that I\nfollowed. So, and every morning I went through the paper right away, who won\nthis. I followed everything, and I started collecting Olympic stamps at that time,\nwhich I \u2014 every penny I made in Europe, things, I \u2014 I bought stamps, and I was\nvery knowledgeable in it. And I have a good eye on good material to buy,\neverything. And I assembled one of the best collections, probably, on Olympic\nhistory. And I was invited to Europe, I think the first exhibit was in \u201974 in Israel \u2014\ninternationally the first, the other ones I exhibited mainly here, which I won a nice\nprize. Then I was exhibiting other places, in the navy too, I had invitation from the\nOlympic committee from Italy, to exhibit as an American guest in Rome. They had\n\u2014 they invited 16 people from around the world, the most known \u2014 most known\nphilatelists and Olympic committee members. First I declined, I don\u2019t have time my\nbusiness. In the philatelic [indecipherable] they told me, this is the biggest honors\nyou can have, and you are going to recline? They send you ticket. Then I \u2014 I send a\ntelegram, so right away they send a telegram back to go Philadelphia and go to\nWashington. I \u2014 from everywhere, tickets, special plane, and I had to take to the\nItalian embassy my collection, that goes by pouch, you know, which they took\nalong from the embassy, they took my collection there, and I was treated royally\nAugust 5, 1999\nthere. We were about 18 people there, every day special dinners, special things, go\nout. If I went to the synagogue on a s \u2014 on Saturday, I have a bus for a hundred\npeople going with me, with one person. Of course I took along a Polish guy\n[indecipherable] and a German guy, which they went with me, they wanted to see\nthe synagogue in Rome. And I was invited for the 95\" congress, which was the\nOlympic congress in \u2014 in Rome, and from then on I got very popular. Then I was\ninvited to most of the international shows, which I was judging also, I became an\napprentice judge first, and international. And I went to every Olympic, I was invited\nfree. They paid for my travel, they paid for my hotel, for the food. They gave me\npocket money. And I built up my collection through my knowledge, which was one\n\u2014 one of the greatest Olympic collections in the world. There were only a few \u2014\nvery few more in this [indecipherable] and I think I was the only in the United\nStates this. And then I was also interesting \u2014 in the 50\u2019s I saw a advertising in the\nGerman paper, \u201cThe Aufbau,\u201d about somebody has a [indecipherable] stamp from\nthe ghetto. I was very interesting and I bought a [indecipherable] the first was the\nBansburg(ph) ghetto. And I didn't even know it exists, this kind of material in the\n50\u2019s. And as I went from show to show, I ask [indecipherable] and this, and then I\nfound out that I can buy some material. And I started assembling a collection on\nghettos and especially on Holocaust. Which I assembled one of the largest private\nAugust 5, 1999\ncollection in the world, which I exhibited international, in [indecipherable]\nBulgaria, in Spain, in England, in Israel, which I [indecipherable] in\nJohannesburg. Last year I exhibited and \u2014 this year [indecipherable] in\nJohannesburg and Israel and I just came from Nuremberg, I exhibited there, I\ngave several lectures on the Holocaust, and mine collection is very well known, and\nI write a lot of articles on Holocaust material, and I give a lot of lectures on it. Now\nI have to put together a collection on concentration camps, and subcamps and\nforced labor camps, which I have about 8,000 pieces, but I don\u2019t have the time to\nput down. So far [indecipherable] on my ghetto collection, which I\u2019m very happy,\nand I give a lot of lectures. And in \u201991 \u2014 in \u201991, I had a phone call from the Jewish\ncouncil. They called me up that they starting to open up a Holocaust tracing center\nin Baltimore, which this is the first center in the United States all over, and\nBaltimore became the headquarters of it. They called me up, I says, I know,\nbecause they know me from exhibits all the time, the JCC, I exhibited in Baltimore\nthe city, whenever it\u2019s Yom HaShoah. Okay, I will go over there. They interviewed\nme there, it was not open yet, but they interviewed me, they locked the door, we\ndon\u2019t let you out. You know too much. You be very good for us. You know the\nlanguages and you translate [indecipherable]. Okay, since I retired from work, I\u2019m\ngoing to do something. So I started and I start to come every day there, then four\nAugust 5, 1999\ntimes a week. And then, when Gorbachev came to power, you know, they started\nto open up, you know, on there in the archives from the Holocaust, from\nAuschwitz, death books and everything. There was a young lady in Baltimore,\ncame to an idea, why don\u2019t we open up a center, we can find and something to do\nfor survivors, so on. And Washington [indecipherable] the main headquarter\n[indecipherable] was. And that\u2019s where I started out, I started out from the first day\non. Then, when they find anything, so one \u2014 one official that started working on the\nHolocaust before they opened up, he was \u2014 he let know that Red Cross that we have\nsome important material in Suitland, in the National Archives, that can be used for\nnames and so on for the Holocaust. So we had out about 12 people, twice a week,\nbefore they wanted everything twice a week. We had a driver from the Red Cross\nand took us to Suitland. After just two weeks, Haverford(ph) quit. He couldn\u2019t\ntake it, it was too much, you know, when they read the stories, and a lot of them\ncouldn\u2019t understand either, because you know, you have to know languages. I\ndecided \u2014 it was very tough on me because everything came back to me. I never\nwanted to talk about the Holocaust at home, never did. Never to nobody, I never\nmentioned, I never wanted to watch a picture of the Holocaust, anything to do with\nit. But here, everything came back on me. Horrible stories. And when I read there\nsome stories, what I thought I went through bad, then I said, I was in the luxurious\nAugust 5, 1999\nhotel, not in the camp. What people went through, especially \u2014 especially in hiding\nplace. And we remained only a few of them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Suitland is the National Archives that\u2019s the fourth largest depository and\narchive from the war in the [indecipherable]. They were \u2014 people come from all\nover the world to look for archives and everything 1s there. If you want to see from\nthe Civil War, if you want to see about anything with the Indians, parts of lands,\nhow \u2014 everything\u2019s there. But particularly is what we were interested on war\nmaterial, they have in Suitland 33 tons, and I\u2019m talking tons of material on the\nsecond World War, what the American army confiscated from archives in\nGermany, Italy, Yugoslavia, France and Austria and Czechoslovakia. And we\nwere working, we had there \u2014 the main one from the Red Cross was Suzanne\nArtivelis(ph), which she is now head from the Christian society in Africa she\nworks. And we \u2014 several people. And we were interested in finding names. What\nAugust 5, 1999\nwe found in names, the names what we recorded, we put down \u2014 in every section\nwe put in, we put in pieces of paper and then once a month they came and they\ncopied this microfilming, which they gave to the Red Cross and then which it was\nsent to Germany, to Arlsen(ph), to the archives for the tracing, Holocaust tracing.\nIf somebody traced, you know, all the time, they sh \u2014 we knew names where they, if\nthey died there or not, but they had them, the names, they\u2019re there. And we found\nthat books which we recorded, over 400,000 names, which we gave to president\nfrom the Red Cross, Mrs. Dore(ph), it was on television, I think, I discovered a lot\nof things. But aside to looking for names on the \u2014 as a historian and from my\npersonal things, anything that concerned Judaism, or Jewish thing, important things,\nbecause people couldn\u2019t read, they just \u2014 th-the American people they didn\u2019t know\nlanguages, just names and they knew the names and they put in where to copy this.\nBut I looked through documents, and I had the sharp eye, I just ful \u2014 I knew right\naway, when I start taking a batch with documents right away, I knew right away\nwhat\u2019s there, what to look up. Whenever has to something with Jewish history, I\ncopied. I did more spend money there in copying \u2014 copying documents, which thing\n\u2014 they all are, what are you doing, what are you doing, that I am all tying up the wi\n\u2014 don\u2019t worry. I have my names everything, but besides that, I have assembled over\n10,000 Xerox copies from the museum, which a lot of it were not even declassified,\nAugust 5, 1999\nI declassified thousands and thousands of pieces there. And I came across material\nthat\u2019s not known to nowhere. Of course, I\u2019m go [indecipherable]. I \u2014 I have at\nhome that I recorded, over 500 pages of documents that came out from the\nAmerican embassy in Ankara, Turkey, which has to do with a Jewish question, a\nrequest from [indecipherable] from Palestine, and also from the United States\nwith a request to President Roosevelt to rescue 405 rabbis from Europe. In the\nbeginning, he said okay. This was in ninet \u2014 beginning \u00b041, which was already\nknown what\u2019s happening in Europe. Of course, he got in touch with Mr. Eden\nfrom England. So Eden, right away [indecipherable] anything, you are going to\ntry to rescue 405 Jews? All European Jews are going to come to you. We don\u2019t have\nships, we have a war going on. What do you need them for? Let\u2019s forget it. Well,\nanyway, it came \u2014 it came then, it came Karski also, 1t\u2019s know what he did here,\nwhat\u2019s happening, and the [indecipherable] day, I have names written down, who \u2014\nwho was the representative and everything. Even Steven Weiss was also connected\nwith it. So, he promise \u2014 he promised then, he said, where would [indecipherable]\nmeans money. Once they had to send 25,000 pounds, which they send it. 25 pow \u2014\nthousand pounds was a lot of money, it was over five dollar a pound at that time.\nThen another 15,000 pound. Finally they came up that they have to buy a ship.\nThere was a ship on the Black Sea, and they had permission from the Turkish\nAugust 5, 1999\ngovernment, when they come to Turkey, to the Black Sea, through Bulgaria, they\nwill let them in only for one night. Then they will go \u2014 go to Palestine. Palestine,\nthe British only allowed them one night to be in there to come to United States. But\nof c-course, delaying, delaying, you wi \u2014 everything \u2014 you know what happened\nwith the Holocaust, nobody\u2019s alive. What we have on record is about 35 rabbis that\nthey came out alive, which they escaped to the Soviet Union. And late in \u201944, when\nit was known there are no more Jews, finally Roosevelt gave in. They sent in \u2014 they\nsent in to all the friendly embassies in Europe, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, if\nsomebody would list the name of the rabbis and if somebody comes here, give him\nthe visa. So we have a undersecretary Long here, which he was a anti-Semite, and\nhe send \u2014 write the letters, before anything, I want to know who they are and what\nto know. I have all documents home.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: [indecipherable] the museum. [indecipherable] in the museum.",
        "A: I will clarify. First of all, when we looked through, don\u2019t forget 33,000\ndocuments, a lot, 90 percent was not declassified yet because nobody came to those\ndocuments yet, which I discovered them for the first time. And when I wanted to\ncopy this, I can\u2019t copy this til they\u2019re now declassified. So I have to go to the head\nof the archives, he put in a stamp with a little note declassified the date, the day\nwith the year, everything, requested for declassification and then she put on a stamp\ndeclassified, and then I could Xerox that, yes. And I have at home at least 5,000\ndocuments which I declassified because nobody saw them before.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I would say about 60 percent, I have a lot of them, they\u2019re not. For instance, the\nnames of the rabbis. I have every name. I have from which synagogue they belong,\nAugust 5, 1999\nfrom which county. For instance, they have 105 rabbis from Lithuania, that\u2019s about\n198 rabbis exact from Poland. They have one rabbi from Estonia, from Latvia,\nfrom France, from Germany, from [indecipherable] all Europe. And this\ndocuments, I gave a talk on it which I\u2019m go \u2014 I \u2014 1n my book that I hope to write,\nthese documents are going to be shown, because a lot of them \u2014 I want to say this\n[indecipherable] some tape, but a lot of them are not declassified yet, which I have.\nSo, I\u2019m a little bit scared.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yeah, mine personal collection of historical artifacts, especially on the\nHolocaust. I acquired this through auctions, through dealers. Of course no \u2014 1-1n\nhere. And a lot of material, which I realize now, which I got information, was stolen\nAugust 5, 1999\nout from archives in Poland, especially from the Jewish \u2014 from the Jewish\nHistorical Society on the Litzmannstadt ghetto, which I didn\u2019t want to buy\nanything, but there I came to one particular item, which I said if I\u2019m not going to\nbuy, somebody is going to buy. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s never will go back to the museum\nanyway. And I know it was stolen out from the museum, but at that time, everybody\n\u2014 every Pole we had a hand in the museum, what does he think about Jewish things?\nThere were mostly Gentile people, and they stole them out, but loads of them,\nsuitcases, which they came to United States and they were auctioned off here, and I\nbought them and I have a lot of documents. I have documents from Hitler also. I\nhave documents from Himmler, signed by Himmler, other things. I bought this at\nthe auctions. I bought in Switzerland. In the 60 \u2014 I was pretty lucky, the original\ntelegram from the Crystal Night, when Crystal Night broke out, when Herschel\nGrynszpan shot vom Rath in the embassy, it was the f \u2014 one of the first telegrams\nthat came out from Paris, sent to Berlin, and it \u2014 it\u2019s a backstamp a picture of\nHerschel Grynszpan that they sent by wire, backstamp Scheidel(ph). Scheidel(ph)\nis like Reuter news, this is Scheidel(ph). It\u2019s the original telegram that\n[indecipherable] what they call him, you know, in German. Herschel Seibel\nGrynszpan, I ever \u2014 never knew that he had a middle name, nobody knew. His\nname is Seibel(ph), like the original telegram, which they have now a copy in the\nAugust 5, 1999\nmuseum. O-Of course it\u2019s gonna remain later on in the museum, but for time being\nI hold onto it, but I have copies in the museum. I have other documents. I have\ndocuments from SS even, things which were taken away by soldiers, which I got\nthem. Is one picture that I acquired even in Vidin(ph) from a friend of mine, which\nhe personally took away from a German soldier, how they cut the curls, the\nsidecurls from Jews with the beards, that I have it, all the other documents. And I\nworked for about seven years in Suitland in the archives, and then they went over\nto College Park and then I stopped, I didn\u2019t have time and I had a drive a day from\nthe Red Cross they supplied, and I did a lot of research there, plus my research that\nI know. And while I was working there, Bob Casting(ph), he should rest in peace,\none of the nicest, most knowledgeable guys probably that this institution ever had,\nhe worked in Suitland in the archives and a lot of times whatever I found, I gave it\nto him, to Bob. I was introduced, and \u2014 and then he asked me Morris, how about\ncoming over the museum, work for some. This was on a case that he had. So I did,\nand since then I\u2019m with the museum, working in the archives on a lot of things. And\nI wouldn\u2019t say that I enjoy these things, what I look, who I work on the microfilms,\non \u2014 which came out from Poland now in \u201955, the [indecipherable] they have,\nwhich I work already two years on it. And it\u2019s not pleasant you \u2014 when you read,\nbut somebody got to do it, and the people that they can translate, that we can do the\nAugust 5, 1999\nstories, if they\u2019re not going to do, who is going to do this later? There\u2019s Yiddish\nespecially. It\u2019s not a dying language, but yet very, very few people know. If it\u2019s\nprinted they know, but handwriting, if it\u2019s handwritten, which I took along a lot of\nthem, Xerox copies, maybe somebody can help me out, I have so much work. Even\nto the rabbinical college in \u2014 the college in Baltimore, the rabbi, no, they wouldn\u2019t\ndo it, 1t\u2019s too hard because it\u2019s fancy Yiddish and this, but I managed to do. And\nsomebody got to do, and I enjoy the people here to work with and I learn a lot\nthrough what I read, through \u2014 a person can never say he knows everything. It\u2019s \u2014\nit\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 believe me, I have a lot \u2014 a lot to learn to \u2014 to know. But, a lot of things\nthat I learned here, and it\u2019s good to know. I wrote many, many articles of this\nsubject, and \u2014 and I have a lot \u2014 in fact I have here an article that I just wrote about\nStutthof, the camps in Stutthof, with all archival work documents from my\ncollection, with letters from Stutthof and it\u2019s all there for future generations, and I\nhope to write a book, so for future generations, they can learn a lot about it.\nAugust 5, 1999\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, well, historical, it\u2019s very va-valuable. I have a lot of unique items in postal\nhistory. For instance, I have letters. A letter from Kaiser [indecipherable] which\nit\u2019s the only one known. From [indecipherable]. I have from some ghettoes that the\nghettoes were only a hundred Jews, not quite a hundred, I \u2014 from there. I have\nhistorical letters, which letters could get out from the ghettoes, the people couldn\u2019t\nget out. And everything was censored there, censored by the Jewish \u2014 by the Jewish\ncouncil has to be censored. If anything was written there, they were \u2014 they could be\npunished and even shot. But, you know, in the ghetto slang, which the Germans\ncouldn\u2019t understand right. For instance, I have a postcard from mine city, written\nfrom an aunt to a niece. And she writes, my liebers(ph) kin, this is mine last writing\nto you. We expect an Uncle Malchamovis, and I will have to go with them. The\nGermans thought Uncle Malchamovis is a name.",
        "A: But it\u2019s not. Then I \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.\nAugust 5, 1999",
        "A: Uncle Malchamovis(ph) is a Hebrew name, the angel of death, so the Germans\nwouldn\u2019t understand what it is. But the person receiving this card knows Uncle\nMalchamovis what it is, and she knew where she is going. Other letters that I have\nin ghetto slang, that reveals the panic there, which in fact I\u2019m gonna write now a\narticle about postal history from the g-ghetto during the war, it reveals the pain and\nthe suffering of the Jewish people. With everyone listed in ghetto slang, we have a\nlot of material on this, of the news how many people got killed there. For instance,\nyou have postcards with a request to a Jewish consul, to a \u2014 the le \u2014 th-the head of\nthe Jewish ghetto, we don\u2019t hear from this and this family, can you write? And he\nsays, well, they\u2019re buried in this and this cemetery. So how can it be that four\npeople from one family is buried, died in the same day? Must be something. So, as\na archivist I look documents, I look through things. I found out on this and this day,\nthey murdered 650 Jews. They put them in the synagogue, and put the fire the\nsynagogue. And these are things you learn from it. And this is this \u2014 you got to\nwrite about it, what happened. And you have the documentation, it\u2019s not just that\nsomething nice can come [indecipherable] happen, it\u2019s everything written the\npostcard. And they can\u2019t deny because this was censored, by the Germans censor,\neverything. I have from the camps, going from the ghetto into the camps, letters,\nAugust 5, 1999\npostcards. And this irreplaceable, you can\u2019t put in a value on it. On a history you\ncan\u2019t put the value. And to sell, I don\u2019t know what you \u2014 depends on the collector. I\nthinks that I paid 5,000 dollars for an item, for one letter, which is extremely rare.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: With the public here, not, but I do a lot, I give talks to charities. I gave talks to\nuniversities, and I do this about 10 to 15 times a year. I gave a talk about two years\nago in Fort Meade for the army people, which it happened it was the ninth of May,\nthe anniversary of the end of the second World War. Was about 300 officers there\npresent, they wrote me up in the paper, in fact they wrote me up in two papers.\nWell, I came there. I didn\u2019t talk much about the Jewish Holocaust, because I don\u2019t\nknow who the people are. Gentile \u2014 it depends. In schools, in schools or\n[indecipherable] I tell them the Holocaust. Army people is a different thing. I\nwanted to disclose to them, which the army doesn\u2019t know if \u2014 the United States\npopulation doesn\u2019t know what happened to American POWs during the war. Their\nholocaust, which people don\u2019t understand, they don\u2019t know, which I have\ndocuments from the second World War that I copied, and it\u2019s everything in the\narchives. In what manner they killed the POWs, also death marches, which it\u2019s not\nAugust 5, 1999\nknown that they went through death marches. There\u2019s a death march with 8,000\nBritish POWs from Poland [indecipherable], they took them through the snow\nand everything, that I found in the archives, a book from a major, from a British\nmajor with the names who got killed, shot on the road, they couldn\u2019t make it. So\nmany of them, thousands got killed from the 8,000. This is not known, and the\npublic don\u2019t know. And they opened their eyes when they heard what they did to\nthe American soldiers, how they buried them with the heads up, which you can find\npictures in si \u2014 and now it\u2019s in \u2014 in college [indecipherable], with the heads up,\nburied. I have a fact, a Jewish soldier, which I have a document with the picture,\neverything. When they \u2014 when they captured him they found a prayer book, which\nthey have the army prayer books, the Jewish people, they took away everything.\nThen they wanted to take off his ring, and 1t wouldn\u2019t come off from the ki \u2014 finger.\nThey took a shovel and cut off his finger to get the ring. Then they buried them with\nthe heads up, and when the American army came in and they saw them burying the\nhead, they kept them \u2014 they kept them from the American army, we should bury\nthem here. He says, don\u2019t take no prisoners from them, look what they did to them.\nAnd this is the anger, but today the population don\u2019t understand what the Germans\ndid to them. The \u2014 they don\u2019t know that over two million Russian POWs were\nkilled by the Nazis in Buchenwald also. There were between three and 400 killings\nAugust 5, 1999\nevery day in Buchenwald, that they had the barrack there, it was called by\ntelephone, 91. When they called them up, they knew what it 1s, they were dressed as\ndoctors. They put them in \u2014 they put them into this barrack, and it was just \u2014 just\nlike a doctor effice \u2014 office for examine your eyes, the height, and everything. And\nthey took prisoners, a lot of prisoners 1n one time, every night what was going on.\nAnd they examined their teeth, they examined their eyes, everything. Then they\ntook one by one into a next room, which it was against the wall to measure the\nheight. But there was a slot there, and they put with the heads back and there he got\nright away a bullet in his back head and this was going all night long. In the\nmorning they cleaned everything off, they had to have a plumber to unplug from the\nblood and everything. They captured those people, they captured the people after\nthe war. What did they do to them? I found documents, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 1t\u2019s unbelievable\nthat the American government could do this. I have a document which a German\nofficer, a doctor decapitated a g \u2014 a-an American officer. He took his head, put them\nin a liquid, get off the flesh, everything. He bleached his skull, and it \u2014 he sent his\nwife a souvenir for mantelpiece. They caught this, and now the German told them,\nand he wanted to save his life. And he was among 45 other German prisoners what\nthey killed [indecipherable] other places. And of course, he was sentenced to death\nby hanging. So the Germans were very smart, and very smart lawyers, right away\nAugust 5, 1999\ngot \u2014 they got petitions from the people from that city which that doctor\n[indecipherable] decapitated the soldier. They got over 5,000 names that he was a\ngood citizen, he went to church every Sunday, that he has a old mother, how can\nshe die knowing if he\u2019s gonna be killed? He has two small kids. How will the kids\nlive the rest of the life he\u2019s going to get killed. And a letter included that came from\nthe Vatican, which I have a copy, a document, which it went to General Clay,\nwhich he was the governor of Europe from the American army, if you are going to\nkill those 45 people, you are not any better than the Nazis, because the war is over.\nSo they commuted them. Of course they got commuted to life. The lawyers were so\nsmart, they send in the petition to Washington, not explaining that they were\ncommuted from hanging to life, but they said they were sentenced to life. And with\nthe same thing with their signatures. So that particular person was commuted to 25\nyears. After sitting Landsberg for five years only, for good behavior they let him\nout free. I have the documents to show. What do we say to the parents from that\npoor soul that he got decapitated? They walking around free. And of course the\nCold War there so they did away everything, 1t\u2019s known for it. And it hurts.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I never wanted to talk from anything, but my son, when I was invited to\ntalk to a church in Stevenson, there in Baltimore, so him with his wife came, and I\nthink that\u2019s the first time he ever heard this, because I never wanted to talk at home.\nAnd he knows a lot of times when I watch a film that \u2014 that I cry a lot. I don\u2019t cry, I\nwalk out, so he knows this. And he \u2014 he knows more about things. And I told him\nabout my collection. A lot of it I donated, a lot of [indecipherable]. Every time I\ncome here I give some here to the museum. Of course, I can\u2019t give everything to the\nmuseum, cause I got kids to leave some money, cause all my money, I never did the\nbank, everything went to buy this stuff, because I figured, I went through so much,\nlet me enjoy what I want with my collections.",
        "A: Yeah, I have two boys. One just got his birthday in July, his 40\" birthday and\none is 38. He is married, and I have my first grandchild, which she is 18 months\nold, beautiful girl. But the only thing that I complain, he is all the time traveling on\nAugust 5, 1999\nplanes for a \u2014 his job demands a lot, he gives lectures and this, he travels all over.\nFor instance, he was only six weeks ago, the first time they send him to Israel, he\nwas only for a day and a half, he saw my sister only for 10 minutes, that\u2019s all. He 1s\nall the time on the travel, and with a young kid. But he is very well loved. My other\nboy is so-so here. And then my wife, unfortunately not so well, when you get a little\nolder, with different things, and so it\u2019s not easy, but I manage to do everything. And\nI\u2019m going to talk a lot about my family, what happened.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, sure. Well, the Eichmann trial I did follow, and my brother-in-law was\nthere. In fact, I have letters from \u2014 from the prosecutor, from the [indecipherable]\ntrial, which they gave to my brother-in-law for writing all those articles. He \u2014 he\nwrites a lot for the army and everything. And what bothered me from the\nEichmann trials especially, when my brother-in-law wrote me a letter, he says he \u2014\nAugust 5, 1999\nI can\u2019t understand. There were Israelis at the trial, and he overheard young Israelis,\nwhat kind scared people are the Jews? Couldn\u2019t they fight back, that they were\nkilled like nothing, and everything. And I got very aggravated about it. I saw \u2014 I\nwas once on Yom HaShoah in Baltimore. It was couple days sitting past me, he\nsays, Morrie, don\u2019t you \u2014 couldn\u2019t I fight back, they go to be killed? Just \u2014 just \u2014\njust whatever they tell them to do it? And when I was \u2014 I was invited to go with a\ngroup of Polish officers for the 50\" anniversary of the Battle of Monte Cassino. So\nI figured I\u2019m gonna go, I was the only Jewish person who [indecipherable], which\nI went with them, we went to Ossiah(ph), we went to Vienna, we went to\nBudapest and then Italy, to all the cemeteries where were soldiers from the\n[indecipherable] army were killed in Italy and they are buried there. And it\u2019s a lot\nof Jewish soldiers are buried there. People don\u2019t know about it. In Verona, other\nplaces. In the Monte Cassino we have about between 36 to 40 Jewish soldiers\nburied there. So one of the ladies here, a very intelligent woman from Chicago,\nshe\u2019s a teacher for music and a artist. And we were very close because with her I\ntalk intelligent manner. And she told me, she says Morris, you tell me one thing.\nLook at the Israelis how they fight and this. How come the Jews never fought there\nin \u2014 in\u20141n Poland. So I ask her wha \u2014 and then it burned me up, so I ask a\nquestion. I says, Stasia(ph) tell me, how come that 15,000 Polish officers, they were\nAugust 5, 1999\nofficers, not regular army people, were killed in [indecipherable] murdered in\n[indecipherable], they never fought back. By the way, there were over 800 Jewish\nsoldiers that got killed, officers got killed in [indecipherable] which I have \u2014 the\nnames I have in the archives, I was working the archives in Warsaw, I found the\nnames, everything. Tell me that the same valiant soldiers from the Russian army,\nthat they captured Berlin, everything, fought so gallantly against the Nazis, over\ntwo and a half million got killed, and they went like sheep to the slaughter. They\ndidn\u2019t fight back. I said, how come so many British POWs got killed, they never\nfought back? In Poland they never fought back. I said, who were the first ones to\nfight, with nothing? It was the Jewish uprising in Warsaw ghetto. I said, you show\nme in all the mankind history, if a person \u2014 if a army [indecipherable] is in\ndefense, there is no uprising, they don\u2019t. Only when [indecipherable] there\u2019s\nuprisings. I said, the Polish uprising in Warsaw, when did it come? When the\nRussian army were near th \u2014 near the \u2014 over there. And they were near Praga and\nthey didn\u2019t come in, they la-later on killed the Polish uprising. That\u2019s what they\nwanted. So then when the \u2014 the Pole \u2014 I said, people fought back in Sobibor in the\ncamp. They fought back even Auschwitz. They fought back anywhere they can,\neven the ghettos, when they \u2014 when they saw uniforms for the army \u2014 for the army,\nI said. I said, Jewish people fought. I said, two \u2014 two and a quarter million \u2014\nAugust 5, 1999\n250,000 Russian soldiers, Jewish soldiers got killed fighting the Nazis, it\u2019s a fact.\nHow many Jews in the British army fell? In the French army, in the Greek army,\neverywhere they fought. How many Jewish soldiers fell and fought against the\nNazis, American soldiers? You go and tell me that they didn\u2019t fight back. Give them\na chance with what to fight back, but they fought.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, when we started out in Baltimore when we came, there was a survivors\u2019\ngroup, we had meetings, but only[indecipherable] for three years. What happened,\npeople didn\u2019t have time, where they have the groceries, most of them went to\ngrocery stores. They were 12 hours a day, they slept there and everything. They\nwere dis-integrated. I mean, not particularly \u2014 there was a \u2014 I tried to \u2014 I tried to\nform a group, without success. I tried even to put out a Holocaust museum in\nBaltimore, which I went to the biggest people, which they give donations in the\nheavy thousands, hundreds of thousands, but to have their name on it. But\nsomething like this, I went to them, they told me, wa \u2014 what do you need here? It\u2019s\ngoing to be a museum in Washington, it\u2019s a museum Los Angeles, what do we\nAugust 5, 1999\nneed this here? I told them, you don\u2019t need much, just give me a room, like they\nhave in Chicago, they have in Los Angeles, there\u2019s a little museum. I will give the\nmaterial. In fact, | was ashamed. Three years ago they called me from the Jewish\nCouncil, they have the teachers, the Catholic teachers convention in Baltimore. So\nthey wanted to put up a little exhibit, so there \u2014 at the table from the Jewish\nCouncil, which I exhibited there, and I was there. And they found out that I wanted\nto put up a museum and to donate this material. That priest from the church came to\nme, we will \u2014 you donate the material, we will have in the church a little museum.\nSo I says, I am very sorry. I can loan you the material, but you asking a little too\nmuch. What the Christians killed so the Jews, and \u2014 and \u2014 and the priests didn\u2019t do\nanything, you ask me from the people, from the victims to donate this kind of\nmaterial to a church?

That\u2019s six o\u2019clock in the morning we\ncame. We were there six in the morning, I won\u2019t go to the \u2014 all the history, it\u2019s\nknown, but they took away mine parents at that time, and they marched them all the\nway to Benzburg(ph), where they were in an orphanage for almost three days.

Then two days\nlater is where it was too late, but he didn\u2019t tell me where they went or anything. And\nwhat happened when I came out from there, from work, and I went home, I went\nthrough the fields, never through the city. I went through the fields, I notice a train.\nAnd when I look at the train I saw German army people in the roofs, and this. I see\nthrough the window Yurinis(ph) Snifell(ph), the father from mine good friend, the\none that what I told you, he died in \u2014 in \u2014 in Bergen-Belsen. He waved to me, I\nwaved back.

She was taken away\nin the beginning of \u201942, May, where they told all young girls, women between 14\nand 30 have to register, 14 or 13 years old. And of course, my sister was the\nyoungest at home, she was only 14 years old. And what I forgot to tell you about\nmy sister, some \u2014 which it\u2019s interesting 1-1n the ghetto what happened. I will come\nback to this wh \u2014 time will permit me. My sister saw in the window \u2014 through the\nwindow, a girlfriend of her on the bike. And this was about nine in the morning.\nAugust 5, 1999\nShe ran out to greet her, this was Basha(ph) Frotesfike(ph), very fine, beautiful\ngirl. As she ran out, it went by a gendarme, a German gendarme went by and she\ndidn\u2019t have her armband on. So she ran quick back to the house, he ran back.\n[indecipherable] to the house, he came to the house. He saw my stamp collection, I\nwas doing stamps. Right away he came, you can\u2019t have this. He took it away, he\nsays, the German government will pay you, you can\u2019t have this. He probably was\ncollecting, he took it away. And they took to court my sister and she got for three\nweeks a prisoner. Of course my mother was crying, how can she go, so my mother\nwent to prison instead of her, because a young girl, she was afraid. Three weeks. I\nwent almost every second day with food to the prison to give her kosher food. And\nthat\u2019s what happened, it was a terrible time. And then they took \u2014 what I said, they\nsaid to register the girls, they took into Sosnowiec to the dulac(ph), and they sent\n450 girls away, all the cream from the youngsters from our city, and they send them\nto a camp, Gruenberg [indecipherable] that\u2019s where I came. This is one of them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, it was Leosia, the oldest. She died on the death march from\nStutthof, yeah. Then was Yehiel. He died, they took him to Auschwitz with the\nAugust 5, 1999\nwhole family, with \u2014 with four children, one which it\u2019s listed on the picture, on the\npamphlets from the Red Cross, I have the picture. And with his wife the whole\nfamily got wiped out. Then was Ruchcia and Tamara. She escaped howe \u2014 to\nRussia, which as \u2014 a witness from my city, they saw them going to the Russian\nside, and he says, come on, let\u2019s go in deep. And she says no, I have to go back\nhome, I want to see my father. When they tried to go back home, and that\u2019s where I\nknow the last thing I heard of them. One, Sala, she ran to the underground, her and\nher husband, they have a little boy. And she went on the underground and they were\nnear Krakow, and they send him \u2014\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: Yeah, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, she went to the underground, to her husband with a little kid, and they\nsend them away to undermine some rails, you know, for train. When he came back\nthere were four girls, four Jewish girls, it was in the PPR, the pepperarr(ph), this\nAugust 5, 1999\nwas the worker\u2019s underground. They were more leftists. And when came back all\nthe four girls were cut the throats and the stomachs. And she was dead and the kid\nwas alive, all bloody from the blood. They didn\u2019t hurt him, but bloody. He grabbed\nthe kid, he washed it off, ran away, and in Krakow he went to a building \u2014 you\nknow the buildings have there staircases where you can \u2014 windows look out? And\nhe put the kid near a monastery, on the steps from a monastery. He was there for\nabout an hour watching window, and he saw somebody came out, a nun, and they\ntook the kid away. And he ran away. He ran away back to Lvov, to Lemberg,\nwhere he came from, he was in Lemberg. And what I know about it, what we\nfound out, and this is from her husband\u2019s brother, what we found out. Her\nhusband\u2019s brother was a officer in the Russian army. And when he came back to\nLemberg, when they liberated Lvov, they came from there, he found his brother,\nmine sister\u2019s husband and he told him the story what happened to her, and with the\nkid. The same day they were sitting a restaurant, a drunken Russian soldier killed\nmy sister\u2019s husband. The day from the liberation. So anyway, he knew about the\nkid, so after the war they put in the paper they\u2019re looking for this kid, and they\noffered a lot of money. In fact, I think that the HIAS or some Jewish organization\noffered a lot of money, a reward for \u2014 for give information about that kid that was\nhere \u2014 he had taken away. It took about two months, came a telephone, and they let\nAugust 5, 1999\nthem know that they know about the kid [indecipherable]. They went there, no,\ngave him away already. He went to another place where we gave him \u2014 he\u2019s on a\nfarm. When he came there toward the farm, he saw a little boy in the pasture,\nbarefoot that the cows, and the little boy started to yell in Polish, help, help, that the\nJews want to kill me. [speaks Polish here] They probably trained that little kid\nagainst the Jews that they shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 either suspect he\u2019s Jewish or something,\nthey never know. But anyway he came in, he wanted the kid, they wouldn\u2019t give\nhim. He says, I give you so much money. No, they don\u2019t have kids. They held him\nall during the war and this, it\u2019s his, that they\u2019re not give away. He says, but I want\nto pay for every \u2014 no, no money can do. We \u2014 we love him and everything. Well, he\nsaw he didn\u2019t have no \u2014 anything to do, he took a couple Jewish comrades from the\narmy, he went back with the guns there, and he says, okay, either we take him, or\nyou gonna get killed when we take him. Anyway, they grabbed the kid \u2014 there were\nfour soldiers, they grabbed the kid, they left money on the table and ran away.\nWhen they ran away they threw away their uniforms, smuggled themselve over to\nItaly, and then from Italy illegal to Palestine. And my oldest sister that came back\nfrom Russia when they came to Palestine, she found out about it, she wanted the\nkid because she\u2019s a aunt. But they went to court in Jerusalem and they gave the kid\nto the uncle because he risked his life, and \u2014 and so anyway, I met a nice \u2014 he looks\nAugust 5, 1999\nlike my brother exactly. This was happened to the other sister. And so I lost four\nsisters and a brother and the parents.",

That\u2019s him. His name, if\nyou w-want to see, is under Kah(ph) Shaptai. Klugman Shaptai(ph)\n[indecipherable]. But he was also known as Scheinfeld(ph). He changed his name,\nhe was afraid from the Polish from the underground things, so he changed his name\nafter his mother\u2019s parents, Scheinfeld [indecipherable]. And his son, his son, when\nhe came over here and changed his name also to Scheinfeld(ph). He was afraid\nKlugman because he was at the international trial, they have something, he was \u2014\nAugust 5, 1999\nand somebody recognize him from Warsaw [indecipherable] he said that\u2019s not\nhim, so he shortened his name to Field so his name is now Field, it\u2019s not\nScheinfeld, just Field.

        "A: Well, I would say, I made myself a happy life, the best I can, and was very\nconstructive. I am very busy with the philatelic organizations, which I travel a awful\nlot, I go four or five times overseas a year, which I am invited. And it\u2019s fun being\njudging at the shows because you meet so many people around the world. The only\nAugust 5, 1999\nthing that it\u2019s bad, that I have about 40 \u2014 50 letters to write monthly. But on the\nother hand, it\u2019s nice to know people everywhere. Wherever I travel, if I go I feel at\nhome and \u2014 and very nice, and that\u2019s mine payback. And otherwise, I enjoy the\nmuseum, I enjoy the people here, nice to work with them, and I know that my work\nhere will help for future generations, that I do something constructive for the\nmuseum.
