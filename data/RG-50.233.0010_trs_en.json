        "Q: Today is March 25, 1992. Iam Anthony Di Iorio of the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum. I am in the home of Mr. George Brieger, New York City and\nI\u2019m here on behalf of the US Holocaust Museum to interview George about the\nexperience of his father and uncle during the Holocaust in Hungary. Good\nevening George.",
        "A: Hi, how are you. My father Anno Brieger was born in Nyathalas near Hungary\non 1925. He lived most of his childhood in Nyireghaza which was the city of the\nregion, the bigger city. Although his grandmother, that\u2019s his father\u2019s mother\nlived, continued to live there, in Nyathalas. They would sometimes take\nvacations there. And the distance between the two cities was about, I don\u2019t know,\na couple of miles but to get from Nyireghaza to Nyathalas is a big trip and it took\nhalf a day on horse and buggy. And it would be a big deal when all the kids\nwould get to go on the carriages.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s how everybody traveled in those days, horse and buggy\u201d?",
        "A: Right. And my father\u2019s grandmother was a renown baker in Nyathalas and\neveryone called her Toni, Jews and gentiles alike",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Toni.",
        "Q: Toni. You know what her last name was? This would be your father\u2019s mother\u2019s\nmother. Father\u2019s mother.",
        "A: So I don\u2019t -- let\u2019s see. It may have been -- I know that she was a descendent of a\ngreat Rabbi thirteen generations before, whose name was Aschach Rabbi\u2019s name\nthirteen generations back and they were Cohanites.",
        "Q: This is a very religious family.",
        "A: Yes, quite religious.",
        "Q: And your father\u2019s family, your father\u2019s mother and family?",
        "A: They were quite orthodox. In fact my father\u2019s father, my grandfather, was very\ninstrumental in the synagogues there, orthodox synagogues, there were three\nsynagogues, two synagogues in Nyireghaza, the orthodox and the -- something\ncalled status quo, sort of like conservative, this conservative synagogue was the\n1\nbigger one in terms of numbers of people. And my father attended the school\nattached to the orthodox synagogue when he was young, then later, when he was I\nguess elementary, middle school he attended the larger Jewish school there in the\nmorning. And in the afternoon he attended Yeshiva in the or attached to the\northodox synagogue in Nyireghaza. And he would tell me that they used to --\nthey would get into fights with the gentile children on the way home. There\nwould be a whole thing where they would --",
        "Q: Your father and...",
        "A: My father and his classmates from Jewish school would be attacked by the gentile\nchildren on their way home and it would be a big deal how to get home without\ngetting into a fight.",
        "Q: These fights were quite common?",
        "A: It seemed that it happened from time to time.",
        "Q: Did anyone ever get hurt?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think, not that my father told me so I guess they couldn\u2019t have been too\nserious at least for my father and his immediate friends. And he was, my father\nwas actually a very good student in, especially in the Yeshiva and he was, he gave\na big speech on his barmirzvah in the synagogue and he went to the Yeshiva in\nMunkatch which is now part of Russia. It\u2019s part of that ---",
        "Q: Right, the Ukraine.",
        "A: Right, the Ukraine, sorry.",
        "Q: So he actually left home \u2014\n\\",
        "A: Left home when he was thirteen at the barmitzvah and he went and attended\nYeshiva in Munkatch and he excelled, he was one of the top guys in the ---,\naccording to the Rabbi. He sat next to the Rabbi in the Sabbath for the meals and\nthat was like the big deal and he\u2019d tell me the stories about the . The\nYeshiva didn\u2019t have dormitories. They would have private Jewish families they\nwould put them up with and the people who could afford it were supposed to give\nsome money, some money to these families because you know to support them,\ncause they would give them two meals a day, these families would. And his\nfamily was pretty well off. My grandfather was pretty well off. They had an iron\nstore, a hardware store.",
        "Q: So your father\u2019s father had an iron...",
        "A: A hardware, hardware store.\n2",
        "Q: Hardware store.",
        "A: And it was pretty lucrative. He was one of the better off people in the Jewish\ncommunity.",
        "Q: What was your grandfather\u2019s name?",
        "A: Brieger.",
        "Q: No, the first name.",
        "A: Adolph, believe it or not.",
        "Q: Adolph. And his wife would be Toni or would that have been ---?",
        "A: No that would be, his mother, his mother.",
        "Q: So Adolph\u2019s mother was Toni?",
        "A: Right, right. Adolph\u2019s wife, my father\u2019s mother died in childbirth, on her third\nchild.",
        "Q: So your father\u2019s mother died ...",
        "A: My father\u2019s mother died during childbirth on her -- I\u2019m not sure which child it\nwas -- it may have been the third or the fifth. There were six siblings altogether\nincluding my father eventually but the last one was from the second wife.",
        "Q: So Adolph remarried and had one more...",
        "A: One more child, yes.",
        "Q: That would be the sixth.",
        "A: The sixth, yeah.",
        "Q: So your father had four brothers and sisters and one half-brother?",
        "A: Yes, I believe so. One of them was a sister, all the other ones were brothers. I\u2019m\nnot sure if the sister was the one that was half or not.",
        "Q: So a total of six -- one girl, five boys.",
        "A: Yeah, my father being the oldest. My father\u2019s mother, natural mother\u2019s maiden\nname was Deutsch.\n3",
        "Q: Adolph\u2019s first wife\u2019s maiden name was Deutsch. But you don\u2019t remember her\nfirst name?",
        "A: No. They were also from the Munkatch area, maybe not Munkatch proper but\nthat area.",
        "Q: Near Matermush?",
        "A: No, I think that\u2019s south. Munkatch is toward the east.",
        "Q: Okay, as I remember looking at one of the photos, Grandfather Deutsch lived in\nTransylvania.",
        "A: Right, that\u2019s my mother\u2019s. That\u2019s my mother\u2019s family. I think it\u2019s a coincidence.",
        "Q: So there\u2019s two Deutsch\u2019s in your family?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay. Now I\u2019m beginning to follow. Your father\u2019s father\u2019s first wife was named\nDeutsch and there\u2019s also a Deutsch on your mother\u2019s side of the family.",
        "A: Right. My mother is Deutsch, maiden name.",
        "Q: Okay. So your father\u2019s family was relatively well off and could afford to send\nhim to Munkatch and help pay...",
        "A: Right and he got packages from time to time with preserves or what have you. I\ndon\u2019t know stuff like that, that was the big deal and he would sometimes give to\nthe more needy children, you know give them a sandwich or whatever cause some\nof them, the ones that were poor were really poor. Like my father in his youth\nhad two shoes, one for weekday and one for the Sabbath. That was a big deal\nbecause the poor children had just one pair of shoes for the Sabbath and during\nthe weekday they would just go barefoot. You know we\u2019re talking poverty here.\nQ; Yeah, how long was your father in Munkatch?",
        "A: He was there until he was about seventeen or eighteen although I think there may\nhave been some other Yeshiva in there as well, some other towns but I think he\nwas away for a total of four or five years.",
        "Q: Now the time that he was going there this territory passed from Czechoslovakia to\nHungary. Did he tell any stories about the Hungarians taking over? Now he was,\nof course. A Hungarian citizen.\n4",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: This territory was separated from Hungary at the end of World War I and then\ntaken back right around the time that your father went up there. Now you\u2019re not\naware of any connection between his going to Munkatch (he would have been\nover thirteen years of age) that would be late 1938, early 1939 which is when the\nHungarians march in.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And he\u2019s there for how many years?",
        "A: Four or five.",
        "Q: Four or five years. So he\u2019s separated from the rest of the family for quite a while.",
        "A: Well, he would visit obviously and stuff.",
        "Q: Yeah, but I mean he\u2019s living apart.",
        "A: Yeah, although he did tell me that the people in the area spoke many languages.\nMy father didn\u2019t speak Czech, did not. But many of the, like for example, the\ntypical Jew would speak Yiddish, Hungarian, because that was the dominant\nculture so to speak. And then either Ukrainian or Czech. And of course he would\nread Hebrew because that was the prayer language.",
        "Q: So your father\u2019s family, going back home now, when they were growing up, were\nthey speaking both Yiddish and Hungarian?",
        "A: Yes but they would speak Hungarian in the house. That was their first language.",
        "Q: Hungarian speaking but they all knew Yiddish.",
        "A: They all knew Yiddish fluently, like a mother tongue. And they read Hebrew and\nthey studied in Hebrew.",
        "Q: Your father did.",
        "A: Yes, and so did all the other children.",
        "Q: But he especially in the Yeshiva training. Any other languages/",
        "A: Well later on he studied German. What happened was, I\u2019m not sure what year but\nI think he was around seventeen and eighteen he came back and they thought he\nshould learn a trade because they thought that trouble was coming and they knew\nthat the hardware store is going to be taken away or something, not by the\n5\nGermans because there weren\u2019t Germans yet, but just the rise of anti-Semitism\nand the Kolneilash.",
        "Q: The Arrow Cross",
        "A: The Arrow Cross, right.",
        "Q: The Hungarian fascists. Hungarian Nazis.",
        "A: So he learned to be a tailor and he also learned German because that was the\nlingua franca of the area.",
        "Q: So he started to study German and tailoring.",
        "A: Right, sort of like vocational school.",
        "Q: Did he actually go to a formal school?",
        "A: This is a school, a school he went to in Hungary",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know which...?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know where.",
        "Q: This would have been when he was about eighteen you say.",
        "A: Yeah. I know that he was very excelled in German, in language and the\nHungarian German teacher never gave him (one was the best grade, sort of like\nthe A. Grades from one to five, one being the highest, five being the\nlowest)...and he would never get a one, he would only got a two. And one time\nhe asked her how come I don\u2019t get a one I did the best paper in the class? She\nsaid to Jews I don\u2019t give ones.",
        "Q: Now originally did anyone plan on him becoming a Rabbi considering all the\nstudying that he was...",
        "A: He was sort of being groomed for some sort of professional role or maybe taking\nover the hardware store, I\u2019m not sure but it was clear that he was going to be the\nstudier of the family. But I don\u2019t think a Rabbi as such was considered.",
        "Q: Now Adolph, did he lose the hardware store?",
        "A: Well, yes, sure the Nazis took 1t away when they took power.",
        "Q: The Hungarian Nazis.\n6",
        "A: Hungarian Nazis. There were a series of laws passed. First there were quotas\nimposed on what Jews can and can\u2019t do in terms of university admissions or\nownership of property and then there were sort of numerous closes which means\nthey couldn\u2019t attend university at all; they couldn\u2019t have any property other than\npersonal property. So they were taken away and there was a ghetto created in\nNyireghaza and then...",
        "Q: But not in Najhalaas.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know about Najhalaas.",
        "Q: It would be too small probably but there\u2019s a ghetto in 1944 in Nyireghaza.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 1944 but it\u2019s some time in there.",
        "Q: Your father has returned by then?\nA; Oh, yeah, yeah, he was already back because when the trouble started he moved\nback home.",
        "Q: So he leaves Munkatch, he studies at a vocational school somewhere in Hungary\nand then he leaves that school to come back home.",
        "A: Well I think that school was home or near home already, the vocational school\nwas.",
        "Q: Okay, so the family is together?",
        "A: The family is together, right.",
        "Q: Including your uncle Julah?",
        "A: Yes, yes. My grandfather was very big on the family being together in the time of\ncrisis and you'll see that later on also.\nQ; What was your uncle Julah doing there in these years before we go ahead?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know whether he was going to school or planning on a trade?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: No, Okay, so back to the ghetto.\n7",
        "A: Right. The ghetto was in the area that my father lived in because my father lived\nin the Jewish community area where all the other Jews lived so I don\u2019t think they\nhad to move but they did have other people moving in with them. The people\nfrom not just Nyireghaza but the whole area because Nyireghaza was sort of the\nlocal capital there.",
        "Q: Even Nadjhalaas perhaps?",
        "A: Perhaps -- from the villages were brought in and they were shoved into the ghetto\nincluding my father\u2019s house. My father\u2019s house was relatively comfortable\nbecause again they were pretty well off. And they were moved in there and it was\npretty uncomfortable because there were many people per room. There were\nseveral families living in one room. And then I think the last year 1944 is when\nthe deportation started so all the Jews began to be rounded up and they were put\non the cattle cars. They weren\u2019t told where they\u2019re going.",
        "Q: By Hungarians or by Germans?",
        "A: I think it was mostly Hungarians. The Germans didn\u2019t have the manpower to do\nall this stuff. What they had to do was: first they had to take all their personal\nbelongings and mail it to this address that was given to them. They were told that\nthats\u2019s where they\u2019re going to this camp. It\u2019s a Hungarian address. So they had\nto package everything and mailed everything to this camp.",
        "Q: To a Hungarian address to an assumed destination. This was their assumed\ndestination.",
        "A: Assumed destination. My father said that the address was a phony address. They\nnever really read the address. It was just put on a thing and it was all taken and\nused by the Nazis or whatever.",
        "Q: Did he know that at the time?",
        "A: No, of course not.",
        "Q: So they actually mailed -- the entire family, your father, his father, everyone\nsent...",
        "A: Whatever possessions they had -- clothing or whatever had to be sent to this stuff.\nThey also buried, illegally of course, buried some stuff. One of the things that\nwere buried was my father\u2019s sort of tools of the trade, his sewing kit, his threads,\nbecause threads were ---apparently threads were very hard to come by because the\neconomy, everything was geared toward the war so civilians couldn\u2019t come by\nthread -- you know spools of thread I\u2019m talking about --\u00b0 so my father took like a\nbox of thread, different colors, needles and what have you and buried it under the\nchicken coop.\n8",
        "Q: Did he actually have a sewing machine?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think do.",
        "Q: So they had some notice. When they were told before they\u2019re actually deported\nthey were given what? A couple of days or more?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how long it was.",
        "Q: Did all this happen, mail and everything?",
        "A: No, it had to be more than one day. It must have been a couple of weeks, I guess.\nThey were told they were being relocated. They weren\u2019t told they were being\nshipped off to north. They were just told they\u2019re going to a different area.",
        "Q: So they were burying things because they didn\u2019t want to give them up, so they\ncouldn\u2019t carry them and they were hoping to return some day?",
        "A: Right, right, right. And of course I guess they believed the story that they were\nbeing fed but they all had doubts also. They certainly didn\u2019t trust the Hungarian\nNazis. And so right, like you said they had hopes of coming back one day and\ndigging up stuff.",
        "A: Did your family ever tell you what his father and mother and other family\nmembers were thinking or saying during these days? Anybody doing anything\nthat stands out in your mind besides burying things? Did anyone try to hide,\nanyone try to get away\u201d",
        "A: Actually I think that there was some sort of paper that my father acquired. I think\nit was my father who acquired it. Somebody in the family acquired it, some sort\nof forged paper that said that he was Hungarian, not Jewish which would have\nallowed him to leave the ghetto and move away. But my grandfather wanted the\nfamily to stick together. He felt the best chance of getting through this was just to\nstick together. So they gave the paper to I think a cousin. Actually it was a\npassport, a Hungarian passport. They gave it to my cousin. Actually this cousin\nis still alive today. I'll get back to him after the war.",
        "Q: Okay. That\u2019s not Frank, 1s it?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: So your father actually had a passport which he could have used but his father\nAdolph persuaded him to give it to his cousin?",
        "A: Right.\n9",
        "Q: The person who survived, did he survive because of the passport?",
        "A: I guess partly. He wasn\u2019t deported so to that extent he was spared a whole -- he\nsort of increased his chances of survival. We know it\u2019s just a question of\nincreasing your chances. You couldn\u2019t be really certain that you would survive\none way or the other.",
        "Q: Did your father and his family realize at this point that their lives were in fact in\ndanger?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they understood the magnitude of the danger.",
        "Q: They were thinking of their property being stolen, being relocated and so forth but\ndid anyone suspect that whole villages, whole communities would in fact be\nkilled?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. The whole death camp was certainly nothing that was known to\nthem.",
        "Q: Did anyone hear anything about massacres that had taken place before either in\nRussia or in Poland by word of mouth, did anyone hear of Hungarian soldiers in\nRussia returning?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think that there were some sort of prophets of doom that would\ncome by, Jawotinski I think",
        "Q: He had died",
        "A: He had died but earlier had come and warned people but he didn\u2019t have first-hand\ninformation.",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m talking about \u201942, \u201943, \u00b044. You know people are being killed by the\nmillions in Russia, in Poland. They\u2019re Hungarian soldiers in Russia. There are\nHungarian Jews who were being sent to work forced labor in Russia. No one was\ncoming back and telling stories?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, not that my father knew.",
        "Q: So we got your father\u2019s family getting ready for resettlement.",
        "A: Resettlement, right. So finally they were getting on the train and the one story he\ntold me that there was this old couple who had this jar of honey with them.\nHoney was something valuable because it lasted, it didn\u2019t spoil and so that was\nsomething that they could take with them. On the process of getting on the train\nthey dropped the jar and the jar spilled and all the honey was spilling on the floor\n10\nand so my father described how eager they were just to scoop it up, what was\nthere to scoop it up with their hands and just put it back and put the honey back in\nthe jar and how futile the attempt was because the honey would be taken away\nonly a few hours later.",
        "Q: But nobody knew.",
        "A: But nobody knew that.",
        "Q: Did they have any food? First of all the whole family got on the train together\nstill?",
        "A: I know my mother who wife was -- certainly the three of them, my father, my\nfather\u2019s brother Jussi by his father.",
        "Q: So Adolph, Yena and Jussi.",
        "A: Right, and also my grandmother, that\u2019s Adolph\u2019s wife and also her baby, the\nyoungest kid because she was just a baby then.",
        "Q: Did they have any food with them? Did he ever tell you what it was like getting\ninto this train? First of all did they know it was going to be a cattle car until they\nactually saw it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they knew anything. They were just given orders. The cattle car --\nthere\u2019s barely enough room to stand in the cattle car. You didn\u2019t have enough\nroom for packages.",
        "Q: You had said they mailed their belongings already",
        "A: Right. They had already mailed.",
        "Q: So did they have anything with them? Food?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they had any food with them, no.",
        "Q: Just get into this car, no food, no belongings. What was it like being in there?\nHad he ever described the inside of this?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure about this particular journey but late on in cattle cars in general it\nwas very crowded. One particular time, I\u2019m skipping ahead a few months, but\nthey were being shipped from one place to the other in cattle cars after they were\nIN.......0.",
        "Q: To Auschwitz.\n11",
        "A: All the prisoners had a little sort of like a cup, like a metal cup and this cup was\nused for everything from getting the soup rations to getting any water if you could\nfind some and also in the cattle cars on this particular journey they were on for\nseveral days at a time there was no room to go to the bathroom. So what the\nprisoners would do is they would -- the ones that weren\u2019t standing near the side --\nthey would sort of use this cup and then just get rid of it.",
        "Q: Use it as a portable toilet.",
        "A: Portable toilet, right.",
        "Q: And then throw it out of the cattle car?",
        "A: Throw it out or even in the cattle car, just get rid of it somehow.",
        "Q: The first trip from Hungary to Auschwitz comes as a shock. No one could\nimagine this condition. You have no toilet, no food, no belongings. How long\ndid that trip take?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how long the trip was.",
        "Q: He never did tell you what it is like being in that -- tell you what people were\nsaying? Here he is with his mother, his father, couple of brothers not knowing\nwhere they\u2019re going to end up -- any stories about what they were thinking, what\nthey were saying?",
        "A: No, not that I can remember. The anticipation -- I don\u2019t have any information\nabout that.",
        "Q: And with nothing to drink, nothing to eat.",
        "A: Nothing to drink. So they finally got to Auschwitz or the first camp. I think it\nwas Auschwitz, sort of like the big camp that everyone sort of checked in through.\nAnd they got off the cattle cars and they saw these Polish Jews who were inmates\nor prisoners, I don\u2019t know what to call them with the uniforms, with the stripes.\nThese guys would sort of have a few whispers as they walked by because they\nweren\u2019t allowed to talk to each other but the Polish prisoners who were there for\nyears because the Poles had to go to the camps before -- would tell them about --\nthey would say things like, make believe you\u2019re healthy because that way you\nwould be steered toward, what was it, the right as opposed to the left or whatever\nit was, whatever their options were. The other reason that if they made believe\nthat they\u2019re sick then they wouldn\u2019t have to work hard or something. They would\ngo to the hospital or something. That was counter-intuitive to make the....",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, you don\u2019t assume that because you\u2019re sick you\u2019re going to be killed.\nAny other suggestions they were getting? Make believe you\u2019re healthy and of\n12\ncourse how healthy can you be after the train ride like the one you just described.\nAny others? How about age? Did they talk about age?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have a lot of time to talk obviously.",
        "Q: What about children?",
        "A: There\u2019s nothing to do about children I suppose. But the Hungarian Jews, they\ncommunicated in Yiddish, thought that the ??? was arranged, that these people in\nthe camps because there are some mental problems because after years in the\ncamp they were so dehumanized and the remarks were so outlandish that they\nthought there was something wrong here.",
        "Q: There was. That\u2019s an interesting observation. Here they\u2019re getting tips, what we\nwould call tips, right? Helpful hints -- and yet as they hear this it\u2019s so difficult to\nbelieve that they actually suspect that the messengers are deranged, crazy. And\nyet what else did they see when they got there? Were these people deranged?\nWhat did your father see when he got out of that car?",
        "A: He saw the sign that \u201cWork Makes You Free\u201d and he saw there was a building\nthat you went into to strip and get rid of all the clothing. They gave you the\nprison clothing.",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t see any dead people?",
        "A: No, this is up front. The cattle cars come in. It looks like a factory or something.",
        "Q: Well it was. How about -- I mean those who\u2019ve been there recall the smell. Was\nthere anything about the smell?",
        "A: I think the smell started later because at this point they weren\u2019t burning the bodies\nyet. That only started when they were running out of time, the Germans thought\nthey were running out of time. This point they still had time to bury the bodies\nafter the gas chambers. Or at least there weren\u2019t as many crematoria or they\nweren\u2019t going at full speed.",
        "Q: So your father, is he separated from the rest of the family?",
        "A: He was separated from all but the three. That is, my father\u2019s father, my father and\nhis brother -- next to the youngest brother -- stayed together the whole time until\nmuch later. Pll get to that later.",
        "Q: So Adolph, Yeno are separated...",
        "A: ...are together, separated from the rest.\n13",
        "Q: Yeah, are separated, -- the rest meaning the mother and the child.",
        "A: I think the rest of the children were there, too. And of course they found out a\nfew days later that they were all killed because the children and the mother went\nstraight to the gas chamber.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t know that until....?",
        "A: Until much later when they got a feel for the rhythm of the camp.",
        "Q: Okay so together they get stripped?",
        "A: They get stripped, they get showered. Believe it or not they get showered, they\nget their haircuts and they have to give up their shoes and they get their uniforms.\nThey\u2019re tattooed I think. Actually I have a very interesting story about that. My\nfather\u2019s number was A3166 and his brother\u2019s must have been A3066 were very\nclose by but what I am saying is my birthday is April 30, 1966 so there\u2019s\nsomething very eerie about that. I know it\u2019s just coincidence to you but to me\nthere\u2019s something -- well anyway...",
        "Q: They\u2019re still together.",
        "A: They\u2019re still together and so they go into the camp. They were given these -- the\nfirst meal that they got was the soup that was very thick, liquidy -- very thick\ngreenish -- it was thick greenish soup that nobody knew what it was made of or\nwhat it was. My father\u2019s father, my grandfather and my father\u2019s brother didn\u2019t\nwant to eat it because it tasted horrible. It didn\u2019t taste like food at all, it tasted like\ncooked tree leaves or something. But my father said to them that we better eat\nthem now because if we get this today we get the same thing tomorrow, it\u2019s not\ngoing to be better. If we don\u2019t survive we have to eat it. That was the theme\nthroughout. My father was into survival. My father said take what we get and\nyou can\u2019t be picky because you\u2019re not going to survive. And so I guess they ate it\nor they forced themselves to eat it. And that was it. Every day they got a bowl of\nsoup, this thick greenish soup and not much else. Once in a while in the\nbeginning -- things got progressively worse as it went on -- in the beginning they\nalso got bread in the beginning, sometimes.",
        "Q: When did they arrive in Auschwitz, did he ever tell you?",
        "A: I guess it was sometime in \u201944. It was the fall of \u00b044, I think.",
        "Q: Or spring.",
        "A: The spring, that could have been it. He was there for a year, all the camps.\n14",
        "Q: Altogether a year because the war ends in the spring of \u201945 so the spring of \u201944\none year.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: How long was he in Auschwitz?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know -- a couple of months, maybe several months. I don\u2019t know exactly\nhow long. I can\u2019t name the camps that he was in. I know he was in Auschwitz; I\nknow he was in Bergen-Belsen. I don\u2019t have all the camps off-hand or how long\nhe was in each. Jussi, my father\u2019s youngest brother was very good at getting\nthings. My father described that one time they would -- the truck with the bread\nwould come by and they would load the bread into the kitchen and the way it\nwould work is that the guy on the truck would throw the bread -- like big 3 kilo\nloaves of bread -- to the guy by the kitchen. He would catch it and he would\njust....And so my father\u2019s brother Jussi was very quick. He snuck up underneath\nthe truck -- again this was all the beginning when there was still so much food --\nhe snuck up underneath the truck and between like sort of the truck and the place\nwhere the other guy stood and as the guy picked up the bread to throw it. The guy\nthrew it; immediately turned back to pick up the next piece and the other guy was\nstill sort of still bending up from the previous throw and so he jumped up and\ncaught it and he went back underneath the truck and he ran like hell because if\nyou get caught for that that\u2019s shot on sight.",
        "Q: Or hanged.",
        "A: Or hanged.",
        "Q: So he could steal bread.",
        "A: He could steal bread. This is very risky. It\u2019s the sort of thing you risk it...",
        "Q: I know and it\u2019s very hard to hide a 3 kilo loaf of bread.",
        "A: What they do was they went to the bathroom and they ate two thirds of it right\naway and they saved one third of it for my grandfather. The idea was to hide the\nevidence and eating quickly. There are two reasons why you have to eat it\nquickly. Number one you have to hide the evidence. Number two things always\nget either stolen or lost or if you work hard it gets damaged or stolen. Prisoners\nwould steal whatever they can get their hands on. So my father\u2019s father said\nalways whatever you get in rations eat it right away. Don\u2019t try to save it or ration\nwhatever for yourself.",
        "Q: It sounds like your father and your uncle found it difficult to trust other prisoners.\n15",
        "A: Yeah, there\u2019s another little story that bears on that point. It\u2019s a very\ndehumanizing experience and you got to the point where you care about your own\npersonal survival and nothing else.",
        "Q: Not someone else\u2019s survival?",
        "A: Not someone else\u2019s survival. The three of them were together. That was an\nexception but other than that...",
        "Q: So it\u2019s the three musketeers.....",
        "A: Against the world.",
        "Q: Against the world and other prisoners are part of the world.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Were there other people from your father\u2019s town with him?",
        "A: Occasionally they would have people from that town but as the time went by\npeople would either drop dead or they would be dispersed so there were less and\nless people that he knew personally. Occasionally he would bump into people he\nthought he knew. One time he was walking by near the perimeter of the camp\nand there were these guard towers. And the guard yelled down at him in\nHungarian because a Hungarian Nazi and he looked up, you know pleasantly\nsurprised and he threw down, the guard threw down a piece of bread. So he\nfigured wow, Hungarian, there\u2019s some people love me up there. He tore the piece\nof bread apart and the bread was full of little needles, little you know the kind of\nneedles you have in your shirt when it\u2019s new.",
        "Q: Pins.",
        "A: Little pins. So if he would have bit into it he could have damaged his mouth. So\nmuch for the Hungarian Nazis. Another story was that my father, Jussi again\nstole beets. And that was another hot commodity.",
        "Q: He\u2019s developing a pattern here. Stole beets. Where did he find beets?",
        "A: Near the kitchen. They would sneak into the kitchen. Again these were all\ncapital crimes. The three of them ate so many beets that for days their stool was\nred. That\u2019s all they ate was beets. Another story about my uncle Jussi -- this I\nthink is later. One of the camps -- they were building something. I think it was a\nglass factory that was being built. This was toward the end of the thing so \u2019'm\nskipping ahead a few months because the allies would bomb it. They had the\nthree shifts -- the Americans during the day and the Russians at night.\n16",
        "Q: The British at night.",
        "A: The British at night, right. So the factory was being built; they never finished\nbecause whatever they built is knocked down by the bombers. They kept\nbombing this thing",
        "Q: This was you say near Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Or Dora?",
        "A: Dora is one of the things, one of the camps. It may have been Dora. I know Dora\nwas one of the camps my father was in. and so there was a little wheelbarrow that\nthe prisoner has to push up on this little wooden plank at an angle. So they had to\nsort of run up to get enough momentum to get the wheelbarrow full of cement up\non the plank and they would only fill the wheelbarrow half way up because you\ncouldn\u2019t get enough momentum to push it all the way up the steep little plank.\nAnd so the Kapo who was a prisoner who turned, became one of them, especially\npicked out bully types, came by and he said how come you\u2019re only filling the\nwheelbarrow half way because you get more productive if you fill it fully so one\nof the prisoners explained that we can\u2019t because we can\u2019t push it up the plank that\nway. So he said let me try. So he had the thing filled up.",
        "Q: The Kapo?",
        "A: He personally had his own wheelbarrow filled up and he...",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about the Kapo?",
        "A: The Kapo, right and he tried to push it up. He couldn\u2019t because it was too heavy.\nAnd bear in mind that the Kapo was in better shape than the other prisoners\nbecause he got more rations. And so he got steaming mad. He was very upset\nbecause not only was he shown wrong but he was also...",
        "Q: Shown weak.",
        "A: Shown weak, right. And so Jussi loaded the thing completely, the wheelbarrow\ncompletely and he went up -- just then he went up and he succeeded in going up\nthe plank.",
        "Q: Jussi?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The same one that the Kapo couldn\u2019t push?\n17",
        "A: The same one that the Kapo couldn\u2019t push. So the Kapo was very pleased. He\ngave him extra rations that day. So these were little tricks that kept them alive.\nThere was one particularly long journey that they had to go on. They had to keep\nmoving east because the British were coming.",
        "Q: This was east from Buchenwald? Remember we started in Auschwitz.",
        "A: We skipped a couple.",
        "Q: From Auschwitz we go west. Now do you have any knowledge of your father\u2019s\nleaving Auschwitz because that\u2019s the first step? We\u2019ve got to get him out of\nAuschwitz before we get him to the other camps.",
        "A: Right. One of them was the cattle cars. In the beginning they still had cattle cars.\nLater on they begin to march on foot because again the German war effort\nrequired the trains.",
        "Q: And they were falling apart?",
        "A: Falling apart. So I guess I\u2019m sure the first time or two they still had the cattle cars\nand they were stuck on the train for a couple of days. They didn\u2019t have any...",
        "Q: The three of them together still?",
        "A: I believe so, I believe so.",
        "Q: How is your Grandpa holding up? I mean he\u2019s got to be a good deal older to\nbegin with.",
        "A: Yes. He was hanging in there at this point still. And the way they would get\nwater they would stick those little cups I told you about and they would take-- I\nguess they had a string around the waist to keep their pants up -- and they tied that\naround the cup, one end of the cup, one string around the cup and they would\nhang it out the little holes in the cattle cars so they\u2019d scoop some of the snow that\nwas adjacent to the train as it went by so that was the refreshment.",
        "Q: So they were being moved around in the winter.",
        "A: Right. What happened to my grandfather was that they were being relocated at\none point and they had to march on foot.\n(End of Side One)\n18",
        "Q: So we were talking about your family is being marched from one camp to another\nand you were going to tell me something about your grandfather who is too weak\nor feeling weak.",
        "A: His legs were giving out and he felt he couldn\u2019t take it. So the two boys, my\nfather and Jussi gathered around him. They didn\u2019t want to leave without him so\nmy grandfather told them to go and they still wouldn\u2019t go because they didn\u2019t\nwant to abandon him so he commanded them, you know like invoked biblical\nthou shalt honor thy father and thy mother and he commanded them to go. And\nso they left. My father later learned that this camp -- the Germans of course were\ngoing to kill everybody, destroy the camp because they had to destroy evidence\nbut this camp apparently was liberated by the Russians.",
        "Q: The camp that they were leaving?",
        "A: Right and my grandfather was liberated by the Russians it seemed, later my father\nlearned because the Germans didn\u2019t have time to shoot the prisoners.",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t know the name of the camp?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And you don\u2019t know when this happened, this separation?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Time of the year? Nothing in your father\u2019s stories that reveal the season.",
        "A: No, not that I can think of.",
        "Q: But it wasn\u2019t Auschwitz?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it was Auschwitz, no.",
        "Q: And it certainly wouldn\u2019t be Buchenwald.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay, so your grandfather was liberated by the Russians?",
        "A: Right, right and my father later learned that he was taken to Siberia but he never\ncame back. The Russians treated the Jews as prisoners -- there were freezing\nconditions in Siberia and he apparently died in Siberia. I don\u2019t have any detailed\nknowledge on what happened to him because my father only heard through sort of\npeople who came back from Siberia and it was sketchy.\n19",
        "Q: So your father and your uncle are marching...",
        "A: But had they stayed in that camp they would have been liberated by the Russians\nand the Russian camp would probably be better than the death camp so it would\nhave been a better deal.",
        "Q: Why was your father able to stay? I mean there\u2019s stories too of the Germans\nshooting people who couldn\u2019t march.",
        "A: Right, I guess they didn\u2019t have -- my grandfather -- I guess didn\u2019t have time to\nshoot him.",
        "Q: But your father and your uncle were forced literally at gunpoint?",
        "A: To march?",
        "Q: Yeah, I mean at one point it sounds like your grandfather commands them to\nmarch but at any point are they being forced marched by Germans/",
        "A: I don\u2019t think....",
        "Q: Would they have been free to stay if they had?",
        "A: I see what you\u2019re saying. If they had pretended that they were sick and couldn\u2019t\nmarch then they -- the Germans weren\u2019t going to go around sending around\ndoctors checking everybody so I guess if they were pretending they were sick\nthey could have stayed.",
        "Q: But did they realize that your grandfather would in fact survive that way? I mean\nvery often the Germans would kill people who were too sick to move",
        "A: Right and I guess they sort of expected that because their attitude of not wanting\nto abandon him shows that, I think.",
        "Q: That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking these questions.",
        "A: Right, I think they figured that he\u2019d be killed but nothing was certain.",
        "Q: Nothing was logical.",
        "A: Nothing was logical, right.",
        "Q: So how about this march that your father and your uncle.....?",
        "A: Now here\u2019s the big march what happened. First everyone was give relatively big\nloaf of bread. Again my father\u2019s philosophy was not to save it but just to eat it\n20\nright away for fear of getting lost or stolen. And they\u2019ll be marched and it was a\nlong march without food.....you had to march I think like eight or four in a row\nand if you fell behind then you\u2019ll be shot because there was a German truck\nbehind you. And see if you slow down --- but they didn\u2019t give you time to sleep\nso what happened was they would sleep, sort of sleep as they marched and so like\nlean on each other or something as they continued to walk.",
        "Q: How long did this go on?",
        "A: I think it was a three day trip.",
        "Q: Three days without sleeping? No rest?",
        "A: Without sleeping, yes. At one point they came across a marsh near the side of the\nroad and they were so thirsty that the people started running for the water and the\nGermans started shooting because they didn\u2019t tolerate the lack of discipline. My\nfather didn\u2019t run because he knew that despite like his natural urge, almost\nirresistible urge for water and for rest he kept going. And this is something else\nthat happened. This sort of thing ? repeated later. At one point they were given a\nchance for a hot shower. There was a big room full of hot showers and the people\nwould be there for a few minutes but then they had to come out, after about two\nminutes or so. And some people were so -- you know enjoyed the shower so\nmuch that they just wouldn\u2019t come out. The Germans would come in there with\nlike with sticks and start beating them and they still -- you know people would\njust collapse under the shower rather than walk out because they were so deprived\nof any sort of physical comfort.",
        "Q: And this felt good.",
        "A: Right and this felt good. My father tells me that he wished that once more in his\nlife he can get a full meal of baked potatoes and then he can die, you know like\nhis last wish but to feel satisfied with a stomach full of baked potatoes.",
        "Q: So where did they go?",
        "A: They went to another camp.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know the name.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the name, some landmarks along the way. One time one of the\nprisoners took with him a pair of phylacterites (tfillin). He put it in his shoes. He\nsnuck into the barracks at night. And so the people who were religious which I\nguess were most of them, I don\u2019t know, a lot of them stayed up all night putting\non the phylacterites, just putting it on quickly and taking it off, just for a second\nbecause they weren\u2019t given an opportunity to pray.\n21",
        "Q: Where had they come from?",
        "A: One of the prisoners snuck it in his shoes.",
        "Q: All of this time they had -- or was this a new prisoner?",
        "A: This was a new prisoner who snuck it in and it disappeared or something after a\nwhile. It wasn\u2019t like an ongoing thing. Also later on toward the end he used to\nstay out of the barracks and stay outside because the barracks were too crowded.\nIf you stayed outside and caught you\u2019d be shot but it was still worth once in a\nwhile because I think there were about four people in the bed or something. So\nwhat he did was he\u2019d hide under the dead bodies so he could have a -- stay out\nyou know.",
        "Q: Yet you don\u2019t know which camp this was? Probably Bergen-Belsen from my\nguess.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: And he was never caught sleeping outdoors?",
        "A: No, I guess he wasn\u2019t. After time went on toward the end all they had -- their sole\ntask -- they didn\u2019t have to work any more ??? enter the factors -- their sole task\nwas to pull the dead bodies and pull them into this big grave. So they would have\nthis little stick with a little thing, hook, at the end and they would put the stick like\nunderneath the dead bodies -- I mean they weren\u2019t necessarily dead, you didn\u2019t\nknow, you thought they were dead but you didn\u2019t have time to check their pulse\nor anything -- you put it underneath their chin and you pull that stick with the\nthing at the end and you pull the bodies that way into this big grave. You\n[indistinct] hide the evidence because the Germans were running out of time.",
        "Q: So prisoners like your father were doing this?",
        "A: Right, for months he did this.",
        "Q: Your father and your uncle?",
        "A: Yes. My uncle was getting very weak by this point.",
        "Q: Anything else?",
        "A: A few more things. When they were liberated...",
        "Q: This was at Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: You know the British liberated them.\n22",
        "Q: Bergen-Belsen. Do you know the time of the year?",
        "A: The time of the year, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Spring, \u00b045, April.",
        "A: Okay. So they came around with loudspeakers and it was announced in several\nlanguages that here we are to come to liberate you. My father was semi-\nconscious at this point. He was laying on the floor and he didn\u2019t really understand\nwhat was going on. He really didn\u2019t understand what liberation meant. So they --\nthe British came around with these sort of paramedics who would check who was\nstill alive and they thought my father was dead because he was in horrible shape,\nemaciate and what have you. And my father sort of unconscious let out a sigh.\nHe wasn\u2019t conscious of what was going on but I guess deep inside he had to let\nother people know that he was still alive because they were about to pull him\naway with the other dead bodies. So that\u2019s how he was saved and he was put in\nthe same --they were put in beds. There were two people per bed at this point\nbecause the British didn\u2019t have enough rations. And all the British had was these\ncans of lard that they had -- given to the prisoners. It was awful. Imagine\nswallowing lard without any other food or anything. So you had to like just\nswallow it because again my father would just eat anything to survive. My father\ninformed the people that he had a brother, Jussi and that they should bring him to\nhim. So the next night they were together. They were in the same bed They slept\nhead to foot. And Jussi couldn\u2019t swallow the lard because he was too\nmalnourished or he just couldn\u2019t do it physically but he just couldn\u2019t swallow the\nlard. Had he been able to swallow the lard or had there been proper medical\nattention at this point he still could have been saved because -- Jussi still could\nhave been saved because the --you --- he wasn\u2019t like -- he was still conscious and\nhe was still relatively speaking okay. And so like the next night my father woke\nup, the next morning and Jussi didn\u2019t move and that\u2019s when my father -- I think\nhe had a major, a major I won\u2019t call 1t a nervous breakdown but he had a major\nsort of you know a major depression for several days or several weeks because\nthis was the last member of the family, the last connection with reality that was\nstill there for him.",
        "Q: When ---I\u2019m still trying to follow the chronology described. How many days\nafter liberation did he die? You have them liberated. The British come in and\nthen...",
        "A: Within two or three days.",
        "Q: The second day your father asked the British if he could bunk with your uncle and\nthen another day and your uncle dies?",
        "A: Right, right so it would have to be the first three or four days or something.\n23",
        "Q: So you\u2019d say two or three days later. The other thing I keep wondering about is\nthe lard itself. I mean of all the things to be eating...",
        "A: Well this is surplus.",
        "Q: Yeah, I know. I\u2019m saying their stomachs and their bodies weren\u2019t used to very\nrich food. If it hadn\u2019t been lard, if it had been something more modest like just\nbread or a turnip or something it might not have done as much damage. There\nwere thousands of people who died after liberation because they couldn\u2019t handle\nthe food that the British gave them.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, the British were clearly under prepared for this thing.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, so your uncle Jussi dies in Bergen-Belsen. Your father recovers.",
        "A: Right. Actually when they were liberated what happened was they went into\nthese showers and this sort of chemical was dumped on them to sort of delouse\nthem.",
        "Q: DDT probably.",
        "A: And because they just had lice and what -- all these different parasites. Then he\ngets taken to Sweden. He was there for two year.",
        "Q: Your father went to Sweden.",
        "A: Yes. This rich benefactor donated his personal yacht to be used for the\ntransportation of the prisoners to Sweden and my father tells me that they, like\nthey -- there was this fake like leather seats and stuff. The prisoners tore the\nleather seats. And they just went berserk I\u2019m not sure if it was envy or anger or\njust not being able to deal with luxury and they just tore the leather seats -- or\n......(indistinct) have something for themselves so they tore the thing. My father\nhad TB from his experience and he was there for six months and he recovered.\nThe doctors didn\u2019t think that he would but he recovered from the TB.",
        "Q: Where was he for six months?",
        "A: In Sweden, a Swedish clinic.",
        "Q: But he\u2019s in Sweden for two years?",
        "A: Yeah, but for six months he was...",
        "Q: In a clinic for six months.\n24",
        "A: Yeah, right, and he couldn\u2019t, he couldn\u2019t --- he was very sick. For the first I don\u2019t\nknow how many months he couldn\u2019t move, he couldn\u2019t get off the bed and he\nstarted learning Swedish. He sort of spoke -- he spoke German from before -- and\nhe was able to get a German-Swedish dictionary and he got Swedish newspapers\nand he sort of taught himself Swedish. That was one of the other languages he\nspoke. He also spoke French.",
        "Q: Did he ever go back to his home- town after the war.",
        "A: Right, yeah, I\u2019m getting to that. After two years or during his stay in Sweden he\ngot in touch with his cousins who were in Nyireghaza and he opened up the\nhardware store again because again there was a period before communism after\nthe Nazis.",
        "Q: Two years.",
        "A: Two years, okay so he wasn\u2019t sure because I think he \u2014 this is sort of like\napocryphal but I think one of the nurses he got really friendly with. I\u2019m not sure\nwhat the love interest, whatever was. He rode around on a bicycle and he was\nvery impressed by the socialist, or I\u2019m not sure it was socialist but (indistinct)\nfriendly ---- the outlook. One of the things --- that if they found a piece of\nclothing on the street that was lost the Swedish would like instead of keeping it\nfor themselves they would take it and they put it on a tree or something or hang it\nsomeplace where it was visible so if these people returned, a person returned to\nlook for it they would find it, that kind of thing. He was very impressed with that.\nAnd also just the generosity that here was a clinic for free. He wasn\u2019t a taxpayer\nor anything. And the general treatment by the Swedes. So then he -- but he\ndecided to go back to his cousins in Nyireghaza. These cousins are now here in\nNew York. They left Hungary later, before my father but after the war.",
        "Q: By any chance is one of these cousins the holder of your father\u2019s passport?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Mitsu was the...yeah.",
        "Q: So your father returns.....",
        "A: Father returns and then let\u2019s see and then they got the hardware store going and\nthen the communists come. Hardware store goes again. Hardware store is taken\naway again. He goes to work in a hardware store as an employee. He marries my\nmother who\u2019s home is Budapest. She was vacationing near Nyireghaza. She\u2019s\nfrom Budapest.",
        "Q: She meets your father.",
        "A: Meets my father and then later they get a license to open a private wire fence\nmaking shop. In Hungary you\u2019re allowed little enterprises like that.\n25",
        "Q: Where was the Shop?",
        "A: Nyireghaza.",
        "Q: So your mother leaves Budapest to live there with your father?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: She must have really loved him.",
        "A: Actually she\u2019ll tell you about this but her conditions were really bad. She was an\norphan after the war living with a great-aunt that was very mean to the three\nchildren and her conditions were really -- compared to his....",
        "Q: Okay, I understand. But I mean normally a person doesn\u2019t leave Budapest to go\nto this little town in the boonies. So when do they come to America?",
        "A: 1977.",
        "Q: So late? So they lived in Hungary until 1977.",
        "A: Right. I was born there. I was born in Hungary. I was ten years old.",
        "Q: 1977 so they saw a lot. They saw Maj they saw Kadar.",
        "A: That\u2019s right and he went through communism, he went through fascism, he went\nthrough all these great twentieth century theories.",
        "Q: And there was no looking back when they came here? They never returned.",
        "A: They never returned, no. Actually they intended to go to Israel all the while but\nthen my sister married an American and she moved here. That\u2019s why they came\nto America.",
        "Q: When did they marry by the way? Did they marry in the -- it must have been the\nlate forties.",
        "A: Fifty-three I think. Uh, uh check that. Let me think. I don\u2019t know. My sister\nwas born in \u201953, I think. Let me think. I was born in \u201966 and she\u2019s twelve years\nolder than I am so she must have been born in \u00b054 and I think that they were\nmarried three years when she was born so I think they got married in *51.",
        "Q: 51. Pl put \u00b050, \u00b051. Your mother will know, I\u2019m sure. She\u2019ll know the exact\ndate.\n26",
        "A: Yeah, she will. And then they came back. Oh, I have to go back. When they\ncame back, before they came back he asked -- the Hungarians had moved into his\nhouse and so he wanted it back but they wouldn\u2019t give it back to him. There were\ncertain pieces of furniture that he wanted back and I think there were a few things\nthat he got back but there was a whole lengthy process. See the Hungarian courts\nat some point were very favorable to the Jewish claims because they knew that the\nfascists are out and...",
        "Q: And Jews could not be considered I imagine as being fascists or pro-fascist. They\nwere Safely anti-fascist. And you couldn\u2019t say the same about other Hungarians.",
        "A: Right and if you were perceived -- if the court or to the judge was being pro the\npeople who took ?? the fascists you may be..",
        "Q: You may be accused of pro-fascism.",
        "A: Right. Again this was the time when the communists, wasn\u2019t communists but saw\nthe communists were coming.",
        "Q: They were coming.",
        "A: Yeah and the communists weren\u2019t too fond of the fascists either. So that\u2019s why he\nwas able to get some of his furniture. He found some of the stuff that was hidden\nlike he found his box of thread and stuff",
        "Q: Did anyone from his family survive besides him?",
        "A: No. His five siblings and his parents died. He was the only survivor except for\nthese cousins but they were not immediate family.",
        "Q: But in the immediate family everyone died.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Grandparents, parents and siblings.",
        "A: Right. One little quick story my father told me that one particular Jew he came\nback and he, how was it, he demanded -- he demanded his property and he got\ninto a fight with the Hungarian, the non-Jewish Hungarian owner. So he got into\na fight and the Jewish guy slapped him so the Hungarian guy sued him for battery\nor something so they went to court. Again the court was sort of reluctant to award\na lot of money so they fined him a relatively small fine, fined the Jew a relatively\nsmall fine so the Jew took out twice, twice the fine that was assessed, gave it to\nthe judge and slapped the Hungarian again. He said it was worth it. Do you have\nany particular questions?\n27",
        "Q: It seems that you\u2019ve covered I mean everything that you would be able to\nremember. Obviously you weren\u2019t there. It would be nice to know the camps.\nFortunately I do have your father\u2019s summary. That\u2019s why I was able to put camps\nin your mouth so to speak. I know that he was in Dora and he was at Bergen-\nBelsen and so forth.",

        "A: Oh, Okay.",
        "Q: And I think after we\u2019ve finished with the tapes if you would I would ask you to\nname your father\u2019s other brothers and sisters.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know their names. I just know Jussi.",

        "A: Hi, how are you. My father Anno Brieger was born in Nyathalas near Hungary\non 1925. He lived most of his childhood in Nyireghaza which was the city of the\nregion, the bigger city. Although his grandmother, that\u2019s his father\u2019s mother\nlived, continued to live there, in Nyathalas. They would sometimes take\nvacations there. And the distance between the two cities was about, I don\u2019t know,\na couple of miles but to get from Nyireghaza to Nyathalas is a big trip and it took\nhalf a day on horse and buggy. And it would be a big deal when all the kids\nwould get to go on the carriages.",
        "A: Right. And my father\u2019s grandmother was a renown baker in Nyathalas and\neveryone called her Toni, Jews and gentiles alike",
        "A: Toni.",
        "A: So I don\u2019t -- let\u2019s see. It may have been -- I know that she was a descendent of a\ngreat Rabbi thirteen generations before, whose name was Aschach Rabbi\u2019s name\nthirteen generations back and they were Cohanites.",
        "A: Yes, quite religious.",
        "A: They were quite orthodox. In fact my father\u2019s father, my grandfather, was very\ninstrumental in the synagogues there, orthodox synagogues, there were three\nsynagogues, two synagogues in Nyireghaza, the orthodox and the -- something\ncalled status quo, sort of like conservative, this conservative synagogue was the\n1\nbigger one in terms of numbers of people. And my father attended the school\nattached to the orthodox synagogue when he was young, then later, when he was I\nguess elementary, middle school he attended the larger Jewish school there in the\nmorning. And in the afternoon he attended Yeshiva in the or attached to the\northodox synagogue in Nyireghaza. And he would tell me that they used to --\nthey would get into fights with the gentile children on the way home. There\nwould be a whole thing where they would --",
        "A: My father and his classmates from Jewish school would be attacked by the gentile\nchildren on their way home and it would be a big deal how to get home without\ngetting into a fight.",
        "A: It seemed that it happened from time to time.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think, not that my father told me so I guess they couldn\u2019t have been too\nserious at least for my father and his immediate friends. And he was, my father\nwas actually a very good student in, especially in the Yeshiva and he was, he gave\na big speech on his barmirzvah in the synagogue and he went to the Yeshiva in\nMunkatch which is now part of Russia. It\u2019s part of that ---",
        "A: Right, the Ukraine, sorry.\n\\",
        "A: Left home when he was thirteen at the barmitzvah and he went and attended\nYeshiva in Munkatch and he excelled, he was one of the top guys in the ---,\naccording to the Rabbi. He sat next to the Rabbi in the Sabbath for the meals and\nthat was like the big deal and he\u2019d tell me the stories about the . The\nYeshiva didn\u2019t have dormitories. They would have private Jewish families they\nwould put them up with and the people who could afford it were supposed to give\nsome money, some money to these families because you know to support them,\ncause they would give them two meals a day, these families would. And his\nfamily was pretty well off. My grandfather was pretty well off. They had an iron\nstore, a hardware store.",
        "A: A hardware, hardware store.\n2",
        "A: And it was pretty lucrative. He was one of the better off people in the Jewish\ncommunity.",
        "A: Brieger.",
        "A: Adolph, believe it or not.",
        "A: No that would be, his mother, his mother.",
        "A: Right, right. Adolph\u2019s wife, my father\u2019s mother died in childbirth, on her third\nchild.",
        "A: My father\u2019s mother died during childbirth on her -- I\u2019m not sure which child it\nwas -- it may have been the third or the fifth. There were six siblings altogether\nincluding my father eventually but the last one was from the second wife.",
        "A: One more child, yes.",
        "A: The sixth, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, I believe so. One of them was a sister, all the other ones were brothers. I\u2019m\nnot sure if the sister was the one that was half or not.",
        "A: Yeah, my father being the oldest. My father\u2019s mother, natural mother\u2019s maiden\nname was Deutsch.\n3",
        "A: No. They were also from the Munkatch area, maybe not Munkatch proper but\nthat area.",
        "A: No, I think that\u2019s south. Munkatch is toward the east.",
        "A: Right, that\u2019s my mother\u2019s. That\u2019s my mother\u2019s family. I think it\u2019s a coincidence.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right. My mother is Deutsch, maiden name.",
        "A: Right and he got packages from time to time with preserves or what have you. I\ndon\u2019t know stuff like that, that was the big deal and he would sometimes give to\nthe more needy children, you know give them a sandwich or whatever cause some\nof them, the ones that were poor were really poor. Like my father in his youth\nhad two shoes, one for weekday and one for the Sabbath. That was a big deal\nbecause the poor children had just one pair of shoes for the Sabbath and during\nthe weekday they would just go barefoot. You know we\u2019re talking poverty here.\nQ; Yeah, how long was your father in Munkatch?",
        "A: He was there until he was about seventeen or eighteen although I think there may\nhave been some other Yeshiva in there as well, some other towns but I think he\nwas away for a total of four or five years.\n4",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Four or five.",
        "A: Well, he would visit obviously and stuff.",
        "A: Yeah, although he did tell me that the people in the area spoke many languages.\nMy father didn\u2019t speak Czech, did not. But many of the, like for example, the\ntypical Jew would speak Yiddish, Hungarian, because that was the dominant\nculture so to speak. And then either Ukrainian or Czech. And of course he would\nread Hebrew because that was the prayer language.",
        "A: Yes but they would speak Hungarian in the house. That was their first language.",
        "A: They all knew Yiddish fluently, like a mother tongue. And they read Hebrew and\nthey studied in Hebrew.",
        "A: Yes, and so did all the other children.",
        "A: Well later on he studied German. What happened was, I\u2019m not sure what year but\nI think he was around seventeen and eighteen he came back and they thought he\nshould learn a trade because they thought that trouble was coming and they knew\nthat the hardware store is going to be taken away or something, not by the\n5\nGermans because there weren\u2019t Germans yet, but just the rise of anti-Semitism\nand the Kolneilash.",
        "A: The Arrow Cross, right.",
        "A: So he learned to be a tailor and he also learned German because that was the\nlingua franca of the area.",
        "A: Right, sort of like vocational school.",
        "A: This is a school, a school he went to in Hungary",
        "A: I don\u2019t know where.",
        "A: Yeah. I know that he was very excelled in German, in language and the\nHungarian German teacher never gave him (one was the best grade, sort of like\nthe A. Grades from one to five, one being the highest, five being the\nlowest)...and he would never get a one, he would only got a two. And one time\nhe asked her how come I don\u2019t get a one I did the best paper in the class? She\nsaid to Jews I don\u2019t give ones.",
        "A: He was sort of being groomed for some sort of professional role or maybe taking\nover the hardware store, I\u2019m not sure but it was clear that he was going to be the\nstudier of the family. But I don\u2019t think a Rabbi as such was considered.",
        "A: Well, yes, sure the Nazis took 1t away when they took power.\n6",
        "A: Hungarian Nazis. There were a series of laws passed. First there were quotas\nimposed on what Jews can and can\u2019t do in terms of university admissions or\nownership of property and then there were sort of numerous closes which means\nthey couldn\u2019t attend university at all; they couldn\u2019t have any property other than\npersonal property. So they were taken away and there was a ghetto created in\nNyireghaza and then...",
        "A: I don\u2019t know about Najhalaas.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 1944 but it\u2019s some time in there.\nA; Oh, yeah, yeah, he was already back because when the trouble started he moved\nback home.",
        "A: Well I think that school was home or near home already, the vocational school\nwas.",
        "A: The family is together, right.",
        "A: Yes, yes. My grandfather was very big on the family being together in the time of\ncrisis and you'll see that later on also.\nQ; What was your uncle Julah doing there in these years before we go ahead?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.\n7",
        "A: Right. The ghetto was in the area that my father lived in because my father lived\nin the Jewish community area where all the other Jews lived so I don\u2019t think they\nhad to move but they did have other people moving in with them. The people\nfrom not just Nyireghaza but the whole area because Nyireghaza was sort of the\nlocal capital there.",
        "A: Perhaps -- from the villages were brought in and they were shoved into the ghetto\nincluding my father\u2019s house. My father\u2019s house was relatively comfortable\nbecause again they were pretty well off. And they were moved in there and it was\npretty uncomfortable because there were many people per room. There were\nseveral families living in one room. And then I think the last year 1944 is when\nthe deportation started so all the Jews began to be rounded up and they were put\non the cattle cars. They weren\u2019t told where they\u2019re going.",
        "A: I think it was mostly Hungarians. The Germans didn\u2019t have the manpower to do\nall this stuff. What they had to do was: first they had to take all their personal\nbelongings and mail it to this address that was given to them. They were told that\nthats\u2019s where they\u2019re going to this camp. It\u2019s a Hungarian address. So they had\nto package everything and mailed everything to this camp.",
        "A: Assumed destination. My father said that the address was a phony address. They\nnever really read the address. It was just put on a thing and it was all taken and\nused by the Nazis or whatever.",
        "A: No, of course not.",
        "A: Whatever possessions they had -- clothing or whatever had to be sent to this stuff.\nThey also buried, illegally of course, buried some stuff. One of the things that\nwere buried was my father\u2019s sort of tools of the trade, his sewing kit, his threads,\nbecause threads were ---apparently threads were very hard to come by because the\neconomy, everything was geared toward the war so civilians couldn\u2019t come by\nthread -- you know spools of thread I\u2019m talking about --\u00b0 so my father took like a\nbox of thread, different colors, needles and what have you and buried it under the\nchicken coop.\n8",
        "A: I don\u2019t think do.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how long it was.",
        "A: No, it had to be more than one day. It must have been a couple of weeks, I guess.\nThey were told they were being relocated. They weren\u2019t told they were being\nshipped off to north. They were just told they\u2019re going to a different area.",
        "A: Right, right, right. And of course I guess they believed the story that they were\nbeing fed but they all had doubts also. They certainly didn\u2019t trust the Hungarian\nNazis. And so right, like you said they had hopes of coming back one day and\ndigging up stuff.",
        "A: Did your family ever tell you what his father and mother and other family\nmembers were thinking or saying during these days? Anybody doing anything\nthat stands out in your mind besides burying things? Did anyone try to hide,\nanyone try to get away\u201d",
        "A: Actually I think that there was some sort of paper that my father acquired. I think\nit was my father who acquired it. Somebody in the family acquired it, some sort\nof forged paper that said that he was Hungarian, not Jewish which would have\nallowed him to leave the ghetto and move away. But my grandfather wanted the\nfamily to stick together. He felt the best chance of getting through this was just to\nstick together. So they gave the paper to I think a cousin. Actually it was a\npassport, a Hungarian passport. They gave it to my cousin. Actually this cousin\nis still alive today. I'll get back to him after the war.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Right.\n9",
        "A: I guess partly. He wasn\u2019t deported so to that extent he was spared a whole -- he\nsort of increased his chances of survival. We know it\u2019s just a question of\nincreasing your chances. You couldn\u2019t be really certain that you would survive\none way or the other.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they understood the magnitude of the danger.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. The whole death camp was certainly nothing that was known to\nthem.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think that there were some sort of prophets of doom that would\ncome by, Jawotinski I think",
        "A: He had died but earlier had come and warned people but he didn\u2019t have first-hand\ninformation.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, not that my father knew.",
        "A: Resettlement, right. So finally they were getting on the train and the one story he\ntold me that there was this old couple who had this jar of honey with them.\nHoney was something valuable because it lasted, it didn\u2019t spoil and so that was\nsomething that they could take with them. On the process of getting on the train\nthey dropped the jar and the jar spilled and all the honey was spilling on the floor\n10\nand so my father described how eager they were just to scoop it up, what was\nthere to scoop it up with their hands and just put it back and put the honey back in\nthe jar and how futile the attempt was because the honey would be taken away\nonly a few hours later.",
        "A: But nobody knew that.",
        "A: I know my mother who wife was -- certainly the three of them, my father, my\nfather\u2019s brother Jussi by his father.",
        "A: Right, and also my grandmother, that\u2019s Adolph\u2019s wife and also her baby, the\nyoungest kid because she was just a baby then.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they knew anything. They were just given orders. The cattle car --\nthere\u2019s barely enough room to stand in the cattle car. You didn\u2019t have enough\nroom for packages.",
        "A: Right. They had already mailed.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they had any food with them, no.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure about this particular journey but late on in cattle cars in general it\nwas very crowded. One particular time, I\u2019m skipping ahead a few months, but\nthey were being shipped from one place to the other in cattle cars after they were\nIN.......0.\n11",
        "A: All the prisoners had a little sort of like a cup, like a metal cup and this cup was\nused for everything from getting the soup rations to getting any water if you could\nfind some and also in the cattle cars on this particular journey they were on for\nseveral days at a time there was no room to go to the bathroom. So what the\nprisoners would do is they would -- the ones that weren\u2019t standing near the side --\nthey would sort of use this cup and then just get rid of it.",
        "A: Portable toilet, right.",
        "A: Throw it out or even in the cattle car, just get rid of it somehow.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how long the trip was.",
        "A: No, not that I can remember. The anticipation -- I don\u2019t have any information\nabout that.",
        "A: Nothing to drink. So they finally got to Auschwitz or the first camp. I think it\nwas Auschwitz, sort of like the big camp that everyone sort of checked in through.\nAnd they got off the cattle cars and they saw these Polish Jews who were inmates\nor prisoners, I don\u2019t know what to call them with the uniforms, with the stripes.\nThese guys would sort of have a few whispers as they walked by because they\nweren\u2019t allowed to talk to each other but the Polish prisoners who were there for\nyears because the Poles had to go to the camps before -- would tell them about --\nthey would say things like, make believe you\u2019re healthy because that way you\nwould be steered toward, what was it, the right as opposed to the left or whatever\nit was, whatever their options were. The other reason that if they made believe\nthat they\u2019re sick then they wouldn\u2019t have to work hard or something. They would\ngo to the hospital or something. That was counter-intuitive to make the....\n12\ncourse how healthy can you be after the train ride like the one you just described.\nAny others? How about age? Did they talk about age?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t have a lot of time to talk obviously.",
        "A: There\u2019s nothing to do about children I suppose. But the Hungarian Jews, they\ncommunicated in Yiddish, thought that the ??? was arranged, that these people in\nthe camps because there are some mental problems because after years in the\ncamp they were so dehumanized and the remarks were so outlandish that they\nthought there was something wrong here.",
        "A: He saw the sign that \u201cWork Makes You Free\u201d and he saw there was a building\nthat you went into to strip and get rid of all the clothing. They gave you the\nprison clothing.",
        "A: No, this is up front. The cattle cars come in. It looks like a factory or something.",
        "A: I think the smell started later because at this point they weren\u2019t burning the bodies\nyet. That only started when they were running out of time, the Germans thought\nthey were running out of time. This point they still had time to bury the bodies\nafter the gas chambers. Or at least there weren\u2019t as many crematoria or they\nweren\u2019t going at full speed.",
        "A: He was separated from all but the three. That is, my father\u2019s father, my father and\nhis brother -- next to the youngest brother -- stayed together the whole time until\nmuch later. Pll get to that later.",
        "A: ...are together, separated from the rest.\n13",
        "A: I think the rest of the children were there, too. And of course they found out a\nfew days later that they were all killed because the children and the mother went\nstraight to the gas chamber.",
        "A: Until much later when they got a feel for the rhythm of the camp.",
        "A: They get stripped, they get showered. Believe it or not they get showered, they\nget their haircuts and they have to give up their shoes and they get their uniforms.\nThey\u2019re tattooed I think. Actually I have a very interesting story about that. My\nfather\u2019s number was A3166 and his brother\u2019s must have been A3066 were very\nclose by but what I am saying is my birthday is April 30, 1966 so there\u2019s\nsomething very eerie about that. I know it\u2019s just coincidence to you but to me\nthere\u2019s something -- well anyway...",
        "A: They\u2019re still together and so they go into the camp. They were given these -- the\nfirst meal that they got was the soup that was very thick, liquidy -- very thick\ngreenish -- it was thick greenish soup that nobody knew what it was made of or\nwhat it was. My father\u2019s father, my grandfather and my father\u2019s brother didn\u2019t\nwant to eat it because it tasted horrible. It didn\u2019t taste like food at all, it tasted like\ncooked tree leaves or something. But my father said to them that we better eat\nthem now because if we get this today we get the same thing tomorrow, it\u2019s not\ngoing to be better. If we don\u2019t survive we have to eat it. That was the theme\nthroughout. My father was into survival. My father said take what we get and\nyou can\u2019t be picky because you\u2019re not going to survive. And so I guess they ate it\nor they forced themselves to eat it. And that was it. Every day they got a bowl of\nsoup, this thick greenish soup and not much else. Once in a while in the\nbeginning -- things got progressively worse as it went on -- in the beginning they\nalso got bread in the beginning, sometimes.",
        "A: I guess it was sometime in \u201944. It was the fall of \u00b044, I think.",
        "A: The spring, that could have been it. He was there for a year, all the camps.\n14",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know -- a couple of months, maybe several months. I don\u2019t know exactly\nhow long. I can\u2019t name the camps that he was in. I know he was in Auschwitz; I\nknow he was in Bergen-Belsen. I don\u2019t have all the camps off-hand or how long\nhe was in each. Jussi, my father\u2019s youngest brother was very good at getting\nthings. My father described that one time they would -- the truck with the bread\nwould come by and they would load the bread into the kitchen and the way it\nwould work is that the guy on the truck would throw the bread -- like big 3 kilo\nloaves of bread -- to the guy by the kitchen. He would catch it and he would\njust....And so my father\u2019s brother Jussi was very quick. He snuck up underneath\nthe truck -- again this was all the beginning when there was still so much food --\nhe snuck up underneath the truck and between like sort of the truck and the place\nwhere the other guy stood and as the guy picked up the bread to throw it. The guy\nthrew it; immediately turned back to pick up the next piece and the other guy was\nstill sort of still bending up from the previous throw and so he jumped up and\ncaught it and he went back underneath the truck and he ran like hell because if\nyou get caught for that that\u2019s shot on sight.",
        "A: Or hanged.",
        "A: He could steal bread. This is very risky. It\u2019s the sort of thing you risk it...",
        "A: What they do was they went to the bathroom and they ate two thirds of it right\naway and they saved one third of it for my grandfather. The idea was to hide the\nevidence and eating quickly. There are two reasons why you have to eat it\nquickly. Number one you have to hide the evidence. Number two things always\nget either stolen or lost or if you work hard it gets damaged or stolen. Prisoners\nwould steal whatever they can get their hands on. So my father\u2019s father said\nalways whatever you get in rations eat it right away. Don\u2019t try to save it or ration\nwhatever for yourself.\n15",
        "A: Yeah, there\u2019s another little story that bears on that point. It\u2019s a very\ndehumanizing experience and you got to the point where you care about your own\npersonal survival and nothing else.",
        "A: Not someone else\u2019s survival. The three of them were together. That was an\nexception but other than that...",
        "A: Against the world.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Occasionally they would have people from that town but as the time went by\npeople would either drop dead or they would be dispersed so there were less and\nless people that he knew personally. Occasionally he would bump into people he\nthought he knew. One time he was walking by near the perimeter of the camp\nand there were these guard towers. And the guard yelled down at him in\nHungarian because a Hungarian Nazi and he looked up, you know pleasantly\nsurprised and he threw down, the guard threw down a piece of bread. So he\nfigured wow, Hungarian, there\u2019s some people love me up there. He tore the piece\nof bread apart and the bread was full of little needles, little you know the kind of\nneedles you have in your shirt when it\u2019s new.",
        "A: Little pins. So if he would have bit into it he could have damaged his mouth. So\nmuch for the Hungarian Nazis. Another story was that my father, Jussi again\nstole beets. And that was another hot commodity.",
        "A: Near the kitchen. They would sneak into the kitchen. Again these were all\ncapital crimes. The three of them ate so many beets that for days their stool was\nred. That\u2019s all they ate was beets. Another story about my uncle Jussi -- this I\nthink is later. One of the camps -- they were building something. I think it was a\nglass factory that was being built. This was toward the end of the thing so \u2019'm\nskipping ahead a few months because the allies would bomb it. They had the\nthree shifts -- the Americans during the day and the Russians at night.\n16",
        "A: The British at night, right. So the factory was being built; they never finished\nbecause whatever they built is knocked down by the bombers. They kept\nbombing this thing",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Dora is one of the things, one of the camps. It may have been Dora. I know Dora\nwas one of the camps my father was in. and so there was a little wheelbarrow that\nthe prisoner has to push up on this little wooden plank at an angle. So they had to\nsort of run up to get enough momentum to get the wheelbarrow full of cement up\non the plank and they would only fill the wheelbarrow half way up because you\ncouldn\u2019t get enough momentum to push it all the way up the steep little plank.\nAnd so the Kapo who was a prisoner who turned, became one of them, especially\npicked out bully types, came by and he said how come you\u2019re only filling the\nwheelbarrow half way because you get more productive if you fill it fully so one\nof the prisoners explained that we can\u2019t because we can\u2019t push it up the plank that\nway. So he said let me try. So he had the thing filled up.",
        "A: He personally had his own wheelbarrow filled up and he...",
        "A: The Kapo, right and he tried to push it up. He couldn\u2019t because it was too heavy.\nAnd bear in mind that the Kapo was in better shape than the other prisoners\nbecause he got more rations. And so he got steaming mad. He was very upset\nbecause not only was he shown wrong but he was also...",
        "A: Shown weak, right. And so Jussi loaded the thing completely, the wheelbarrow\ncompletely and he went up -- just then he went up and he succeeded in going up\nthe plank.",
        "A: Yes.\n17",
        "A: The same one that the Kapo couldn\u2019t push. So the Kapo was very pleased. He\ngave him extra rations that day. So these were little tricks that kept them alive.\nThere was one particularly long journey that they had to go on. They had to keep\nmoving east because the British were coming.",
        "A: We skipped a couple.",
        "A: Right. One of them was the cattle cars. In the beginning they still had cattle cars.\nLater on they begin to march on foot because again the German war effort\nrequired the trains.",
        "A: Falling apart. So I guess I\u2019m sure the first time or two they still had the cattle cars\nand they were stuck on the train for a couple of days. They didn\u2019t have any...",
        "A: I believe so, I believe so.",
        "A: Yes. He was hanging in there at this point still. And the way they would get\nwater they would stick those little cups I told you about and they would take-- I\nguess they had a string around the waist to keep their pants up -- and they tied that\naround the cup, one end of the cup, one string around the cup and they would\nhang it out the little holes in the cattle cars so they\u2019d scoop some of the snow that\nwas adjacent to the train as it went by so that was the refreshment.",
        "A: Right. What happened to my grandfather was that they were being relocated at\none point and they had to march on foot.\n(End of Side One)\n18",
        "A: His legs were giving out and he felt he couldn\u2019t take it. So the two boys, my\nfather and Jussi gathered around him. They didn\u2019t want to leave without him so\nmy grandfather told them to go and they still wouldn\u2019t go because they didn\u2019t\nwant to abandon him so he commanded them, you know like invoked biblical\nthou shalt honor thy father and thy mother and he commanded them to go. And\nso they left. My father later learned that this camp -- the Germans of course were\ngoing to kill everybody, destroy the camp because they had to destroy evidence\nbut this camp apparently was liberated by the Russians.",
        "A: Right and my grandfather was liberated by the Russians it seemed, later my father\nlearned because the Germans didn\u2019t have time to shoot the prisoners.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, not that I can think of.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it was Auschwitz, no.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Right, right and my father later learned that he was taken to Siberia but he never\ncame back. The Russians treated the Jews as prisoners -- there were freezing\nconditions in Siberia and he apparently died in Siberia. I don\u2019t have any detailed\nknowledge on what happened to him because my father only heard through sort of\npeople who came back from Siberia and it was sketchy.\n19",
        "A: But had they stayed in that camp they would have been liberated by the Russians\nand the Russian camp would probably be better than the death camp so it would\nhave been a better deal.",
        "A: Right, I guess they didn\u2019t have -- my grandfather -- I guess didn\u2019t have time to\nshoot him.",
        "A: To march?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think....",
        "A: I see what you\u2019re saying. If they had pretended that they were sick and couldn\u2019t\nmarch then they -- the Germans weren\u2019t going to go around sending around\ndoctors checking everybody so I guess if they were pretending they were sick\nthey could have stayed.",
        "A: Right and I guess they sort of expected that because their attitude of not wanting\nto abandon him shows that, I think.",
        "A: Right, I think they figured that he\u2019d be killed but nothing was certain.",
        "A: Nothing was logical, right.",
        "A: Now here\u2019s the big march what happened. First everyone was give relatively big\nloaf of bread. Again my father\u2019s philosophy was not to save it but just to eat it\n20\nright away for fear of getting lost or stolen. And they\u2019ll be marched and it was a\nlong march without food.....you had to march I think like eight or four in a row\nand if you fell behind then you\u2019ll be shot because there was a German truck\nbehind you. And see if you slow down --- but they didn\u2019t give you time to sleep\nso what happened was they would sleep, sort of sleep as they marched and so like\nlean on each other or something as they continued to walk.",
        "A: I think it was a three day trip.",
        "A: Without sleeping, yes. At one point they came across a marsh near the side of the\nroad and they were so thirsty that the people started running for the water and the\nGermans started shooting because they didn\u2019t tolerate the lack of discipline. My\nfather didn\u2019t run because he knew that despite like his natural urge, almost\nirresistible urge for water and for rest he kept going. And this is something else\nthat happened. This sort of thing ? repeated later. At one point they were given a\nchance for a hot shower. There was a big room full of hot showers and the people\nwould be there for a few minutes but then they had to come out, after about two\nminutes or so. And some people were so -- you know enjoyed the shower so\nmuch that they just wouldn\u2019t come out. The Germans would come in there with\nlike with sticks and start beating them and they still -- you know people would\njust collapse under the shower rather than walk out because they were so deprived\nof any sort of physical comfort.",
        "A: Right and this felt good. My father tells me that he wished that once more in his\nlife he can get a full meal of baked potatoes and then he can die, you know like\nhis last wish but to feel satisfied with a stomach full of baked potatoes.",
        "A: They went to another camp.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the name, some landmarks along the way. One time one of the\nprisoners took with him a pair of phylacterites (tfillin). He put it in his shoes. He\nsnuck into the barracks at night. And so the people who were religious which I\nguess were most of them, I don\u2019t know, a lot of them stayed up all night putting\non the phylacterites, just putting it on quickly and taking it off, just for a second\nbecause they weren\u2019t given an opportunity to pray.\n21",
        "A: One of the prisoners snuck it in his shoes.",
        "A: This was a new prisoner who snuck it in and it disappeared or something after a\nwhile. It wasn\u2019t like an ongoing thing. Also later on toward the end he used to\nstay out of the barracks and stay outside because the barracks were too crowded.\nIf you stayed outside and caught you\u2019d be shot but it was still worth once in a\nwhile because I think there were about four people in the bed or something. So\nwhat he did was he\u2019d hide under the dead bodies so he could have a -- stay out\nyou know.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: No, I guess he wasn\u2019t. After time went on toward the end all they had -- their sole\ntask -- they didn\u2019t have to work any more ??? enter the factors -- their sole task\nwas to pull the dead bodies and pull them into this big grave. So they would have\nthis little stick with a little thing, hook, at the end and they would put the stick like\nunderneath the dead bodies -- I mean they weren\u2019t necessarily dead, you didn\u2019t\nknow, you thought they were dead but you didn\u2019t have time to check their pulse\nor anything -- you put it underneath their chin and you pull that stick with the\nthing at the end and you pull the bodies that way into this big grave. You\n[indistinct] hide the evidence because the Germans were running out of time.",
        "A: Right, for months he did this.",
        "A: Yes. My uncle was getting very weak by this point.",
        "A: A few more things. When they were liberated...",
        "A: You know the British liberated them.\n22",
        "A: The time of the year, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Okay. So they came around with loudspeakers and it was announced in several\nlanguages that here we are to come to liberate you. My father was semi-\nconscious at this point. He was laying on the floor and he didn\u2019t really understand\nwhat was going on. He really didn\u2019t understand what liberation meant. So they --\nthe British came around with these sort of paramedics who would check who was\nstill alive and they thought my father was dead because he was in horrible shape,\nemaciate and what have you. And my father sort of unconscious let out a sigh.\nHe wasn\u2019t conscious of what was going on but I guess deep inside he had to let\nother people know that he was still alive because they were about to pull him\naway with the other dead bodies. So that\u2019s how he was saved and he was put in\nthe same --they were put in beds. There were two people per bed at this point\nbecause the British didn\u2019t have enough rations. And all the British had was these\ncans of lard that they had -- given to the prisoners. It was awful. Imagine\nswallowing lard without any other food or anything. So you had to like just\nswallow it because again my father would just eat anything to survive. My father\ninformed the people that he had a brother, Jussi and that they should bring him to\nhim. So the next night they were together. They were in the same bed They slept\nhead to foot. And Jussi couldn\u2019t swallow the lard because he was too\nmalnourished or he just couldn\u2019t do it physically but he just couldn\u2019t swallow the\nlard. Had he been able to swallow the lard or had there been proper medical\nattention at this point he still could have been saved because -- Jussi still could\nhave been saved because the --you --- he wasn\u2019t like -- he was still conscious and\nhe was still relatively speaking okay. And so like the next night my father woke\nup, the next morning and Jussi didn\u2019t move and that\u2019s when my father -- I think\nhe had a major, a major I won\u2019t call 1t a nervous breakdown but he had a major\nsort of you know a major depression for several days or several weeks because\nthis was the last member of the family, the last connection with reality that was\nstill there for him.",
        "A: Within two or three days.",
        "A: Right, right so it would have to be the first three or four days or something.\n23",
        "A: Well this is surplus.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, the British were clearly under prepared for this thing.",
        "A: Right. Actually when they were liberated what happened was they went into\nthese showers and this sort of chemical was dumped on them to sort of delouse\nthem.",
        "A: And because they just had lice and what -- all these different parasites. Then he\ngets taken to Sweden. He was there for two year.",
        "A: Yes. This rich benefactor donated his personal yacht to be used for the\ntransportation of the prisoners to Sweden and my father tells me that they, like\nthey -- there was this fake like leather seats and stuff. The prisoners tore the\nleather seats. And they just went berserk I\u2019m not sure if it was envy or anger or\njust not being able to deal with luxury and they just tore the leather seats -- or\n......(indistinct) have something for themselves so they tore the thing. My father\nhad TB from his experience and he was there for six months and he recovered.\nThe doctors didn\u2019t think that he would but he recovered from the TB.",
        "A: In Sweden, a Swedish clinic.",
        "A: Yeah, but for six months he was...\n24",
        "A: Yeah, right, and he couldn\u2019t, he couldn\u2019t --- he was very sick. For the first I don\u2019t\nknow how many months he couldn\u2019t move, he couldn\u2019t get off the bed and he\nstarted learning Swedish. He sort of spoke -- he spoke German from before -- and\nhe was able to get a German-Swedish dictionary and he got Swedish newspapers\nand he sort of taught himself Swedish. That was one of the other languages he\nspoke. He also spoke French.",
        "A: Right, yeah, I\u2019m getting to that. After two years or during his stay in Sweden he\ngot in touch with his cousins who were in Nyireghaza and he opened up the\nhardware store again because again there was a period before communism after\nthe Nazis.",
        "A: Two years, okay so he wasn\u2019t sure because I think he \u2014 this is sort of like\napocryphal but I think one of the nurses he got really friendly with. I\u2019m not sure\nwhat the love interest, whatever was. He rode around on a bicycle and he was\nvery impressed by the socialist, or I\u2019m not sure it was socialist but (indistinct)\nfriendly ---- the outlook. One of the things --- that if they found a piece of\nclothing on the street that was lost the Swedish would like instead of keeping it\nfor themselves they would take it and they put it on a tree or something or hang it\nsomeplace where it was visible so if these people returned, a person returned to\nlook for it they would find it, that kind of thing. He was very impressed with that.\nAnd also just the generosity that here was a clinic for free. He wasn\u2019t a taxpayer\nor anything. And the general treatment by the Swedes. So then he -- but he\ndecided to go back to his cousins in Nyireghaza. These cousins are now here in\nNew York. They left Hungary later, before my father but after the war.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Mitsu was the...yeah.",
        "A: Father returns and then let\u2019s see and then they got the hardware store going and\nthen the communists come. Hardware store goes again. Hardware store is taken\naway again. He goes to work in a hardware store as an employee. He marries my\nmother who\u2019s home is Budapest. She was vacationing near Nyireghaza. She\u2019s\nfrom Budapest.",
        "A: Meets my father and then later they get a license to open a private wire fence\nmaking shop. In Hungary you\u2019re allowed little enterprises like that.\n25",
        "A: Nyireghaza.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Actually she\u2019ll tell you about this but her conditions were really bad. She was an\norphan after the war living with a great-aunt that was very mean to the three\nchildren and her conditions were really -- compared to his....",
        "A: 1977.",
        "A: Right. I was born there. I was born in Hungary. I was ten years old.",
        "A: That\u2019s right and he went through communism, he went through fascism, he went\nthrough all these great twentieth century theories.",
        "A: They never returned, no. Actually they intended to go to Israel all the while but\nthen my sister married an American and she moved here. That\u2019s why they came\nto America.",
        "A: Fifty-three I think. Uh, uh check that. Let me think. I don\u2019t know. My sister\nwas born in \u201953, I think. Let me think. I was born in \u201966 and she\u2019s twelve years\nolder than I am so she must have been born in \u00b054 and I think that they were\nmarried three years when she was born so I think they got married in *51.\n26",
        "A: Yeah, she will. And then they came back. Oh, I have to go back. When they\ncame back, before they came back he asked -- the Hungarians had moved into his\nhouse and so he wanted it back but they wouldn\u2019t give it back to him. There were\ncertain pieces of furniture that he wanted back and I think there were a few things\nthat he got back but there was a whole lengthy process. See the Hungarian courts\nat some point were very favorable to the Jewish claims because they knew that the\nfascists are out and...",
        "A: Right and if you were perceived -- if the court or to the judge was being pro the\npeople who took ?? the fascists you may be..",
        "A: Right. Again this was the time when the communists, wasn\u2019t communists but saw\nthe communists were coming.",
        "A: Yeah and the communists weren\u2019t too fond of the fascists either. So that\u2019s why he\nwas able to get some of his furniture. He found some of the stuff that was hidden\nlike he found his box of thread and stuff",
        "A: No. His five siblings and his parents died. He was the only survivor except for\nthese cousins but they were not immediate family.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right. One little quick story my father told me that one particular Jew he came\nback and he, how was it, he demanded -- he demanded his property and he got\ninto a fight with the Hungarian, the non-Jewish Hungarian owner. So he got into\na fight and the Jewish guy slapped him so the Hungarian guy sued him for battery\nor something so they went to court. Again the court was sort of reluctant to award\na lot of money so they fined him a relatively small fine, fined the Jew a relatively\nsmall fine so the Jew took out twice, twice the fine that was assessed, gave it to\nthe judge and slapped the Hungarian again. He said it was worth it. Do you have\nany particular questions?\n27",
        "A: Where is this from? What are you reading here?",
        "A: Oh, Okay.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know their names. I just know Jussi.",
        "A: Actually there\u2019s a cousin that might know actually. We have a cousin who with\nhis help....[indistinct]",
