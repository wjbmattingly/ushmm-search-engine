So you didn\u2019t understand anything, because we went to\nRomanian school as children, you know.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "Q: Was it the same teachers, or did they bring in all new teachers who were\nHungarian born?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure they ki \u2014 brought in the teachers, because the teachers that we knew \u2014\nand I really didn\u2019t know whether they speak hungar \u2014 I know my father spoke\nHungarian for one reason, because the soldiers must have had on their agenda\ncertain things that Yorel(ph) Pollak was \u2014 was a g-gender(ph) urmeshda(ph) they\ncall it that time, like a \u2014 not a general \u2014 not a \u2014 1n the army, like a\u2014 how do you call\nit? A little officer, you know, in the army, in the first World War. So the soldiers\nwho passed through my town, some of them stopped in our house, and they wanted\nto have some wine to drink and this [indecipherable]. So I knew, but we were not\nallowed to go into the room when they talked to my father, as children. Nobody was\nallowed to know.",
        "Q: And your father never told the children \u2014",

[indecipherable] And he says, Ernie, you\u2019re already\n13 - 14 years old, 15 years old, 15 and a half years old. Come to me with \u2014 to\nBudapest and you'll learn a trade. What are you gonna do in this small town? I was\nMarch 2, 2010\nvery good with my hands and making, you know, certain things, you know, in\njewelry or anything. So he says, come, you\u2019re gonna become a jeweler.",
        "Q: And did you take him up on that?",
        "A: And I went right after Pesach, when he went back. I went back to Budapest and\nI couldn\u2019t get anything on the jewelry, I couldn\u2019t get \u2014 so he says, let\u2019s go to a dental\nlaboratory, maybe you\u2019re gonna be \u2014 they\u2019re going to teach you to be a dental\ntechnician, cause he was there in that place also. But he quit after a while, you know,\nso I went in there and I stood there til the Germans came in, for a year and a half,\nalmost two years.",

        "Q: And was the motivation for coming to Budapest because they thought it was\neasier to earn a living, or because \u2014\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 they were politically safer?",
        "A: No, easier to earn a living, because politically I did not \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether\nanybody as young boys and girls thought about politically at that time, but they saw\nthat you could sense certain thing. You sensed it, but you didn\u2019t make anything of it,\nas long as you were okay. But to make a living had gotten harder in the town, so I\nfigured I got to learn a trade.",
        "Q: And from the postcards that your family sent to you, did you have a sense that\ntheir life changed over those two years?",
        "A: Yes, the last year especially.",
        "Q: And how did it change?",
        "A: Changed \u2014 they were not allowed \u2014 let\u2019s say, soon as the ger \u2014 soon as the\nHungarians came in, and my father was a butcher in the \u2014 in the Jew \u2014ina\u2014ina\nstrictly Orthodox sense, you know? And a \u2014 and you have to slaughter a cow or a\ncalf or a sheep in a certain way to be kosher. You have to slaughter. You have to get\na shochet, right?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So we used to have our own place, you know, we were three butchers\n[indecipherable]. And we had the same place, we just \u2014 to take the cows, or the\nMarch 2, 2010\ncalf, or the \u2014 the \u2014 to slaughter. But as soon as the Hungarians came in, they forbid\nyou. You\u2019re not allowed to get a shochet to slaughter. How do you have to slaughter\nthe cow? You got to hit it right here.",
        "Q: And so wa \u2014",
        "A: Which is \u2014 that\u2019s ridiculous because when you\u2019re slaughtering, the reason why\nyou slaughter the cow, because you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re taking all the veins, which are here,\nand the blood comes out from the animal. So this is what you call it the kosher.\nNothing could happen to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the meat, or to whatever. So that\n[indecipherable] so, right away, even while I was still home.",
        "Q: So did your father then begin to continue on as a butcher but for non-kosher\nmeat, or did he stop working?",
        "A: No, he st \u2014 no, no, we still had the meat, kosher meat, cause instead of going in\nduring the day to slaughter, you went in two o\u2019clock at night.",
        "Q: And to provide for \u2014",
        "A: And we were hiding it.",
        "Q: And did he continue to sell it to the other \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, we took my older brother \u2014 took my older brother Moishe(ph), and me and\nmy father, and we went down and we took the shochet and they slaughtered it.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 surreptitiously as well?",
        "A: Yes, yes, they knew it, because the shochet lived in town, you know, so they\nknew it. But it gotten always a little bit worse, because when I \u2014 when Hitler came\ninto Budapest in May, I think it was in \u2014 not in May \u2014",
        "Q: March.",
        "A: March. March 17. Came into Budapest. I already had letters from my hometown,\nfrom my father, that in April, and before April, they already gathered them, you\nknow, in the synagogue, and they already started the transports to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: So I wanted to come and talk about your experience in Budapest, but let\u2019s just\nstill talk with your parents. So when did you find out that your parents had been\ndeported, and how much of your family \u2014 the Germans came in in March, and then\nyou said already the next month they were gathered up?",
        "A: Th-Th-They came in \u2014 they came into Budapest in March, but to my hometown\nthey came in earlier. This why I said, because I got a notice from my parents in\nApril yet, that we were gathered already to be shipped out somewhere, but I didn\u2019t\nknow any place where, I didn\u2019t know nothing.",

        "Q: So who was still in Romania? Was your parents and the other six siblings?",

Only my second, the one who was after my sister, David and I\n[indecipherable] the fourth, were in Budapest, the rest, six, were already a-all\nhome, didn\u2019t go no place. As a matter of fact, I found out after the war that my older\nbrother Moishe(ph) was going to run over to Poland and hide some \u2014 somewhere\nthere. But this 1s what somebody told me who I met after the war.",
        "Q: So, now let\u2019s move to Budapest, and we\u2019|l move back in time. So, in \u201942, you\ncome with your brother, and you become a dental technician.",

        "Q: And where were you living?\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: I was living in Dabutsa(ph), it was not far from the real \u2014 the synagogue, you\nknow, I was living by mys \u2014 by a \u2014 by a\u2014 an older couple who rented me a room.\nNot my own apartment, or my own [indecipherable] gave me a room \u2014",
        "Q: And you\u2019re still religious at this point?",
        "A: Yes. And as a matter of fact, the Dahani(ph) synagogue was not far away, and I\nused to go every Friday night to listen to the cantor.

        "Q: And you noticed a difference in terms of how the Hungarians treated you, apart\nfrom the Germans. The Hungar \u2014",
        "A: The Hungarians were almost the same way, you know. Almost \u2014 almost like the\nGermans. Now, but that time, I don\u2019t know how much control the Germans had yet,\nbut the Hungarian army had a lot of control. I guess Hitler gave them the \u2014 gave\nthem that they can do that.

Because by that time, the Americans \u2014 the\nAmericans did a lot of damage to Budapest. They bombed a lot of things, important\nthings in Budapest. And they marched us to clean up whatever they had there.\nMarch 2, 2010",

So I had to\ndo things on my own, even though I wasn\u2019t 18 years old yet. But they took me to\nthese kind of works. And then, month later, this was \u2014 let\u2019s see, this was May, June,\nJuly, around July already \u2014 I mean, rumors went down that they\u2019re going to ship us\naway to ric \u2014 to a camp, right.

        "A: In the ghetto, each day, they knew because they came into the hall in the bottom,\nyou know, in those \u2014 because the ghetto is, you know you're there, they have the big\napartments here, and here 1s like a garage you can come in the middle, you know.\nAnd all you had to see, all the Jewish people should come down, you know, and\nMarch 2, 2010\nthey knew who we are. So they forced us to the labor camp, because most of them\nwere Jewish, you know.",
        "Q: And so when you were in for forced labor, were you living in the ghetto? Were\nyou already moved to a labor camp?",
        "A: In the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the ghetto. In the ghetto. Because I remember the\nHolocaust Museum\u2019s name, what 1s the street where you \u2014",

But the Americans\nrefused the trucks, so the Germans came right away to cross [indecipherable]\nAustria.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "Q: So let me ask \u2014 move back a little bit and ask you two questions. One is if you\ncan describe a little bit more about the type of work you were doing in the labor\nbattalion, and the other is, when you talk about having seen Raoul Wallenberg, do\nyou know any people who made it to the glass house, and were saved through him?\nIf you can address those two areas?",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t know. Really I wouldn\u2019t know. But you know, you didn\u2019t \u2014 you\ndidn\u2019t go there every day, because you weren\u2019t in the ghetto, you know, in the place\nthat\u2019s a\u2014 maybe it was in the shul, in the synagogue that he gathered us, or\nsomewhere else. But you know when you\u2019re this age and you \u2014 one day you come\nand one day you don\u2019t come. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not something that \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014\nthat you believe something is going to happen, you know. You hope, but \u2014 and then\nthey just disappeared, everything.",
        "Q: And did you have enough to eat in the ghetto?",
        "A: In the ghetto nobody had enough to eat. That \u2014 they gave us, let\u2019s say, a bread,\nfor three days, a pound of bread, or four days. Now, you tried not to eat it, correct, in\nMauthausen, you tried to eat every day a piece. But you had to sleep with it, you\nhad to hide it, you had \u2014 otherwise somebody stole it from you.",
        "Q: So after a month, say you left \u2014 you were taken from the ghetto and \u2014\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: We were \u2014 we were \u2014 we were walked, we were not thre \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 they didn\u2019t\n\u2014 see, let\u2019s say this is Budapest, Hungary, and this 1s the border to go to Austria.\nAnd Mauthausen could be here, maybe 500 kilometers, or I don\u2019t know how much.\nSo we walked from here, over here and here.",
        "Q: So-",
        "A: Th-They made us sleep in certain places, I\u2019d say \u2014",
        "Q: How long was the march?",
        "A: It took maybe a month, or maybe six weeks, or maybe two months, I don\u2019t know\nexactly.",
        "Q: And do you know about how much \u2014 long you were marching each day? Was it\n10 kilometers, 20 kilometers?",
        "A: This \u2014 well, you marched, because \u2014 this I wouldn\u2019t know. No, you just obeyed\norders, you know.",
        "Q: Right. And but all day long, you got up in the morning, walked \u2014",
        "A: Right, right, but \u2014 but the \u2014 the funny thing 1s this, because I been saying those\nthings too. Once we crossed the border, is we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t sleep outside\nbecause it \u2014 the winter started to come, you know, 1n \u2014 in \u2014 in September, October,\nthere\u2019s cold already. So \u2014 so, in certain places where they knew the \u2014 let\u2019s say they\ntook us into a place like this, which in \u2014 can take in, 1f you want to sleep 30 - 40\nMarch 2, 2010\npeople, so they put in a hundred people. So you couldn\u2019t sleep, you couldn\u2019t lay\ndown. You could only stay. Now, if somebody died \u2014 I se \u2014 I been saying this all the\ntime, if somebody died, you didn\u2019t report it to them, you just took them as \u2014 as a\npillow, and you slept on them, you know. So that was a difficult situation, walking\nand stopping, and walking until we reached Mauthausen.",
        "Q: Who was guarding you while you were walking? Were these Hungarians, or \u2014",
        "A: No, once we crossed \u2014 we went, we crossed the \u2014 from ha \u2014 from Hungary, that\nwas the Austrian army.",
        "Q: And in Hungary it was Hungarians?",
        "A: Hungary was Hungarians, yeah.",
        "Q: And when you were walking, what were you wearing? Were these the clothes\nyou had with you from the ghetto?",
        "A: Well, I had \u2014 no, see, it was too late for that time when we came to the ghetto, or\nthe changes, the clothes like you see in the movies that you had those stripes and\n[indecipherable] no.",
        "Q: So it was civilian clothes.",
        "A: We did have \u2014 we still have the \u2014 had the \u2014 only the clothes that we came with,\nyou know. Nothing else but a pair of pants and a jacket an-and a shirt or whatever,\nand that\u2019s it. Cause you couldn\u2019t \u2014 we were not allowed to take anything with you\nMarch 2, 2010\nwhile you were walking, cause you didn\u2019t have nowhere to put it, no place, you\nknow.",
        "Q: And then when did they \u2014 did they feed you once a day, or week, or \u2014",
        "A: In the ghetto they fed us once a day, lunchtime. So in other words, they gave you\na bread for three, four days. You had to be your own master on it, to eat 1t one time,\nor you can not eat nothing for the next three days, or just cut it, or \u2014 or tear off a\npiece and eat today and tear off a piece and eat tomorrow.",
        "Q: And while you were marching?",
        "A: While we were marching, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s gonna be stopped, because\nthey have nothing to feed us when we were walk. They brought us a soup\nsometimes, you know, later on, because let\u2019s say we stopped five o\u2019clock, two hours\nlater they brought in the [indecipherable] you know, for everybody something. But\nfood, forget it, it\u2019s not really \u2014",
        "Q: And did they \u2014",
        "A: This why people died, mainly cause you didn\u2019t have any food at all.",
        "Q: So of your group \u2014 you started with about a hundred? About how many people\ndied en route, was the mortality rate \u2014\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: I wish I knew, but because y-you know, y-you\u2019re talking \u2014 first of all, you\u2019re\ntalking to a very young person, you know, who did not experience anything of the\nsort. And it didn\u2019t think that it should go into my mind to watch \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I only think I watched because they told you when you walked, let\u2019s say here,\nfive people walked in the street, and they announced it in German, if somebody\u2019s\ngoing to step out, is gonna be shot. So everybody was \u2014 was very, very alert, just to\nwalk exactly behind anybody, not to step out this way from the line.",
        "Q: Now, when you were walking, did civilians, Hungarians or Austrians ever stop\nand sort of look at you? Did you ever see people \u2014",
        "A: They stopped, but they didn\u2019t say a word, you know. They laughed, they didn\u2019t s\n\u2014 didn\u2019t say a word, I mean, it\u2019s nothing.",
        "Q: Did they come out thinking that 1t was something interesting to see, or was it just",
        "A: Oh, they enjoyed it. This 1s the way it looked to us, you know.",
        "Q: So were you walking through towns, or in the countryside?",
        "A: Most of it the countryside, you know. Sometimes you had to walk through a\ntown, because in order to find somewhere to put us up, so the towns had \u2014 either\nthey had the churches, or they had other things. [indecipherable] you could \u2014 you\nMarch 2, 2010\ncould \u2014 stalls, you know, from \u2014 for the cows. They took the cows out and they put\nus in there for the night, you know, things like this.",
        "Q: And at any point did they they tell you where you were marching to?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So eventually af \u2014 you arrive in Mauthausen, or \u2014",
        "A: Eventually we arrived in Mauthausen, but Mauthausen was so full that they\ndidn\u2019t have empty space for us where to put it \u2014 put us. So they built, you know, for\nthe outside, those \u2014 th-those \u2014 how \u2014 th-they build now f\u2014 you know, when \u2014 when\nthe \u2014",
        "Q: At barracks?",
        "A: Tents.",
        "Q: Tents.",
        "A: Tents. Tents, you know, they built for \u2014 they built tents. I mean they built not\nsmall tents, they built tents that could take in a thousand people.",
        "Q: And tell me what your reaction was when you saw Mauthausen for the first\ntime. You\u2019ve been marching for a month and then you get to this place. What was\nthe first thing that crossed your mind?",
        "A: Scary, very scary. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s hap \u2014 gonna happen. You did not\nknow nothing. The only thing you heard, a lot of bombing at night, because I think\nMarch 2, 2010\nthe Americans already bombed these places. Because they bombed Budapest and\nthe Americans [indecipherable] was still there. And they bombed, you know, so th-\nthat\u2019s the only thing we could hear.",
        "Q: And did you get to talk to any of the prisoners who had been there before?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So you had no idea what it was, or \u2014",
        "A: No, because there was Jews and non-Jews prisoners and a lot of Russian\nprisoners in there also, o-on those \u2014 in the regular barracks, you know, it was very,\nvery big.",
        "Q: And when you arrived, did they issue you camp uniforms, or you stayed \u2014",
        "A: No. This why I\u2019m saying this, I found this picture in my pocket.",
        "Q: And did you have any work assignments once you got there, or you just \u2014",
        "A: Most of the time no, because you know, every \u2014 every barrack had \u2014 had a\u2014a\nkapo, a leader, a Jewish leader, that\u2019s it. The Germans said, you\u2019re going to be the\nkapo, you\u2019re going to be responsible for those thousand people. They cannot go out\nunless you take them out. We tell you to take mi \u2014 take out 10 or 20 or 30, and go\nthere and there.",
        "Q: What was your impression of the kapo?\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, because m-maybe I \u2014 maybe when you\u2019re younger than \u2014\nthey were older people there also with us. They probably would have known certain\nthings or they would have, you know. But my a \u2014 my impression was to just keep\nquiet and don\u2019t mix in, and don\u2019t do just you are t \u2014 what you are told. That was my\nimpression and this what I did.",
        "Q: And so one day was pretty much the same as the other for your last time \u2014",
        "A: Right, the same. You see, as \u2014 as \u2014 as they came closer, the Germans \u2014 I mean,\nthe Americans, you know, occupy this part of Austria and this part, they came\n[indecipherable] closer \u2014 I\u2019m talking months later, they used to take us out to work\non schutzengraben.",
        "Q: Describe that.",
        "A: Schitzengraben. This is for the \u2014 for the army it was you go into those foxholes.",
        "Q: So you were digging them, or \u2014",
        "A: Yep, we are digging, digging and digging, di-digging, and digging and digging\nand then brought back, you know, brought back you know, but \u2014 and then the\nAmericans still came closer, right. So this was already January, February. In\nFebruary, I think, in the beginning of February they marched us out from\nMauthausen \u2014 or \u2014 or in January, I\u2019m not sure \u2014 marched us out from Mauthausen,\nand they took us to a place, Gunskirchen.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "Q: And was life there any different than Mauthausen?",
        "A: Worse. Because that was in ou \u2014 in the mountains, you know, and it was raining\nand muddy. You \u2014 you \u2014 you couldn\u2019t even go and lay down to sleep, you can only\nstay, because the mud was still here.",
        "Q: To your \u2014",
        "A: In the barracks, with no floors. Til \u2014 til May the fourth, of the liberation.",
        "Q: Describe liberation day.",
        "A: I talked so much about that liberation day. We get up in the morning from like I\nsaid, the kapo. Me \u2014 not me, because the older people who were in the camp. So the\nkapo going in and out, several kapos, knock on doors \u2014 on there. They didn\u2019t know\nwhat happened. So I don\u2019t know, at 10 o\u2019clock or 11 o\u2019clock [indecipherable]\npeople looked out, they didn\u2019t see any Germans in the uniforms, they didn\u2019t see any\nbe \u2014 if they saw a German he was running this way, you know. So they came in and\ntold everybody, something is wrong, something 1s going on, you know. But by two\no\u2019clock, you know, the kapo came in, says the German left because the Americans\nare coming. But we have to wait til the Americans are going to come here, because\nyo-you don\u2019t know where the Germans are now. They are not here. If you go out\nnow, you might find a German who can do harm to you. So we were in there, but\nsome people, older people, younger people \u2014 I was too weak and too young to s \u2014 to\nMarch 2, 2010\n\u2014 to think, went out from the \u2014 from the \u2014 from the barracks, and they went to the \u2014\nwhere they had the food that \u2014 you know \u2014 and started to open up the stores there,\nwhatever they have sas \u2014 and they started to bring it into the camp, you know. The\nreason why I remember these things, I was too weak to go there, so I stood by the\ndoor \u2014 my wife, I used to tell her that story, and this was a funny thing, what\nhappened. I see one fellow, maybe a little older, a year or two than I, which I never\nknew him, comes in with \u2014 with something in his hands like this, a jar like, you\nknow.\nA2: Honey.",
        "A: Honey. I didn\u2019t know it\u2019s honey. So I j \u2014 I was laying down there and I jump up\nand I grab it. And it made him full of honey on his face, and he was very angry at\nme. But I had some honey, and \u2014 and started eating. And then I didn\u2019t see him again,\nwe didn\u2019t \u2014 no, we didn\u2019t. But \u2014 [\u2019Il tell this later on. So by f\u2014I think it was around\nfour o\u2019clock, was no \u2014 who had watches, but we just looked at \u2014 was around four\no\u2019clock that the Americans came in. And they opened the door, so they says, you\ncan go any place you want. So where do you go from d\u2014 you don\u2019t know \u2014 nobody\nknew where. So they directed us to go into the town, it\u2019s called Wels. Wels, it\u2019s 30\nkil \u2014 30 kilometers or less than Linz \u2014 from Linz. So we all went into that town, I\ndon\u2019t know how many thousands of people, but a day later \u2014 we slept outside,\nMarch 2, 2010\nbecause there is no place where to sleep. A day later and two days later and three\ndays later, we were still walking around [indecipherable], but the Americans came\nwith their Jeeps and grabbed us, put us in in the Jeep and brought us to Wels,\nbecause Wels had room for thousands of people because it was an SS camp,\nofficers\u2019 camp. And everything was empty, so they brought us there, you know. So\nwe are there and they didn\u2019t know how to feed us, so they gave us too much food. A\nfew days later, I je \u2014 I remember on a Sunday morning, hundreds of people were\nlaying outside hardly breathing because their stomachs swelled up, you know. And \u2014\nan-and I found right there, some of my \u2014 some \u2014 two people from my hometown\nlaying there.",
        "Q: Had you known they were in the camp before?",
        "A: No, no I didn\u2019t know. What happened to them, I don\u2019t know, I think one of them\ndied, but what happened to the other one, I really don\u2019t know. But then the\nAmericans got somebody in and they \u2014 and they advised them what to cook and\nwhat to serve for those people, otherwise [indecipherable] are gonna die.",
        "Q: Were there any Austrians still in the town?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what was their attitude to what was going on?\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: Yeah. They were \u2014 just nothing, I mean, they j \u2014 they just looked, I suppose. I\nmean, nobody had any conversation with them. Not me, and not \u2014 not my friends\nwho were with me. Friends \u2014 those people who came with me. So we just looked\nand looked and looked, you know, so \u2014 but \u2014 until the Americans came and took us\ninto the Jeep, said, let\u2019s go \u2014 no, come. So, I remember else, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m a week, two\nweeks, three weeks, I think after the fourth or the fifth week, I don\u2019t remember\nexactly because nobody counted. I\u2019m in the \u2014 in the \u2014 taking a shower, because it\nhas community showers, like the people, you know, here for the women and here for\nthe men. And I\u2019m walking out dressed up to take a shave or whatever it 1s, and a girl\ncomes over to me. And she looks at me. She says, I know your name. So I almost\ndropped dead. You know, she said, what do you mean you [indecipherable] in\nYiddish [indecipherable] she says, your name is Ernie Pollak. So I figured right\naway somebody knew. Says, how do you know\u201d? She says, I was with your sister in\nthe camp. Her name is Bluma(ph) Park. So I says, oh my God, tell me exactly\nwhere, you know, this was at \u2014 it was already four or five weeks, I don\u2019t know\nexact. So she says to me, she is in Bergen-Belsen. Now, Bergen-Belsen, I don\u2019t\nknow how many hundreds of kilome \u2014 kilometers, because it was in Germany \u2014 it\nwas from there. Now I would not \u2014 I did not expect that I\u2019m gonna figure th \u2014 say to\nmyself I\u2019m going to go to Bergen-Belsen, how am I gonna go to Bergen-Belsen? |\nMarch 2, 2010\ndon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have good clothes even, I don\u2019t have [indecipherable]. So she\nsays, when I came here, I came from Feldafing, an \u2014 another DP camp. She says,\nyou come with me to Feldafing, you know. She came to see her brother, she found\nout that her brother was \u2014 was in Wels with me. And she\u2019s, you come with me, and\nthen from there you gonna go to Bergen-Belsen, which is not that far. So I went to\nBergen-Belsen, it took us three months. We got to Bergen-Belsen Erev rontef \u2014\nErev Rosh Hashanah. Can you imagine how \u2014 how long it took us to go there? I\nfound some people from my hometown, you know, and I started asking questions.\nYou know Gans(ph) [indecipherable] his brother, you know? And he says, your\nsister was never here. Whoever I asked, your sister was never here. Nobody knew\nwhat \u2014 what I\u2019m asking, nobody knew her, nobody \u2014 so, I don\u2019t know why she said\nto me that my sister is in Bergen-Belsen. But I was glad I was there amongst some\nother people that I know from my hometown. And then, a year later \u2014 and I\u2019m just\njumping certain things because there\u2019s a lot of things from here til the year later, I\njust want to bring two things together about that fellow that I took the honey.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He came with his sister from Romania back to Bergen-Belsen, because he also\nsaid something, because we are sitting, you know, in Bergen-Belsen with friends,\nhaving lunch or something. Ber-Bergen-Belsen was also a camp which it had a \u2014\nMarch 2, 2010\nA2: A DP camp.",
        "A: A DP camp, yeah, because you know where Anne Frank was?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It\u2019s jus \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 Anne Frank was in Belsen. And Bergen was a\u2014 was an SS\ncamp, which it had 10 - 15,000 officers there, you know. And ben \u2014 berry \u2014 when vi\n\u2014 the liberation was, they took from Belsen th \u2014 where Anne Frank was, all boys\nand girls in here to the Bergen camp, because they had where to live there, but in a\nconcentration camp. So it became Bergen-Belsen, together. So I sitting at a table,\nand this guy was sitting with his sister, you know, I mean that\u2019s much later, about\nhalf a year later, or \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or 10 months later. And we are talking, what do we\ntalk, with him and with him and with him, we telling the stories about camp, we\ntelling the stories about camp, we telling what happened this. And I happened to tell\nthat story. The guy sitting in front of me, he said, you son of a gun, 1t was you who\ndid this to me. And [indecipherable] you know who.",
        "Q: So-",
        "A: So I apologized, what can I do? But we were friends, all the way. We came to the\nUnited States aga \u2014 together, and he wasn\u2019t \u2014 he wasn\u2019t in a \u2014 used \u2014 I used to\ninvite him to \u2014 to my Bar Mitzvahs to the kids, and th-that. So it worked out, you\nknow, thank God, you know.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "Q: Now, did you ever find your sister?",
        "A: Well, in order for me to find my sister and the rest of them, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a story, if\nyou\u2019re ready. Bergen-Belsen was a camp for thousands of boys and girls, thousands\nof them. And we \u2014 you know how it was, there was nothing to do. There was\nnothing to do. You go again to eat lunch, you go again to eat breakfast, you go again\neat. Was nothing. It was separated by Bergen-Belsen and five different camps:\ncamp one, camp two, camp three, camp four. And each one had about a thousand\nboys and girls or \u2014 or maybe more. You had to get a bicycle to travel somewhere, so\nafter I was there six or seven months, the Haganah came down, the Israeli hag \u2014\nsoldiers, maybe a hundred of them, dressed in civilian clothes, cause Bergen-Belsen\nwas under the \u2014 the eng \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 England\u2019s occupation. No, not\nAmerican, was England, you know. And they started to get 50 people here in this\nroom, 50 people here in this room, 60 people here, or a hundred people here. And\nthey used to talk to us, what you should do. And nobody knew whether anybody\nsurvived. So they used to say like this here; you, I\u2019m gonna give you five postcards;\nyou I\u2019m gonna give five post \u2014 postcards. Write the name where the postcards\nshould go, to your hometown; whether it\u2019s Romania, Czechoslovakia, or \u2014 0-or it\u2019s\nHungary, or \u2014 or \u2014 0-or it\u2019s in Poland, or it\u2019s in any of these places. He says, I\ndon\u2019t care how long it\u2019s gonna take to get there, just write the name to go there. And\nMarch 2, 2010\nwrite not the name, just write to the city hall. This postcard should go to the city hall\nfor Osovish(ph) let\u2019s say, to my hometown. And in the other side write, my name is\nErnie Pollak.

        "A: Then I came to the United States.",
        "Q: And why did you decide to come to the United States?",
        "A: Well, to me and my younger brother, there was something, you know \u2014 in 1934,\none of my mother\u2019s sisters \u2014 my mother had four sisters and two brothers in New\nYork. One of my mo \u2014 my brother\u2019s sisters came to my hometo \u2014 our hometown,\nbecause my mother gave birth to a boy and she wanted to name him \u2014 to name the\nboy after her husband who died in \u2014 in \u2014 in New York. But the husband \u2014 in \u2014 not\nnew \u2014 yeah, but her husband had a brother in the small town \u2014 1n the middle time,\nyou know [indecipherable] brother. Now in the Jewish religion, if you want \u2014 1f the\nbrother is alive, in the Orthodox religion, and if you have a boy and you want to give\nhis name [indecipherable] the person, hi-his wife has to get Halitzah, separation.\nSo whi \u2014 she came from New York to my hometown \u2014 to our hometown, and he\ngathered the full synagogue and they made \u2014 the rabbi made Halitzah, in other\nwords a separation from her husband, who was dead, and this little boy can be\nnamed on his name. So this how I knew her, and then you know, we se \u2014 my\nMarch 2, 2010\nyounger brother said look, we have very no \u2014 whoever remained alive, your sisters\nwent to Israel. We have to wait to go to New York to see the rest of the family. And\nthis 1s what we did.",
        "Q: Let me just ask a couple concluding questions. You began the interview by\ntalking about your life before and that it was a very religious home and you were\ngoing to the synagogue every day. Did your attitude towards religion change as a\nresult of the war?",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a funny thing that you ask. We remained three brothers and\na sister. My brother married a cousin, and he was religious, but my \u2014 my \u2014 my sister\nmarried a cousin and he was religious, the one in Israel, and they observed\neverything religion \u2014 quite religion [indecipherable]. My older brother became\nOrthodox also, because he was Orthodox always, and he didn\u2019t leave. So a matter of\nfact, I have a kosher home and sometimes he realized and he used to come and eat in\nmy house. And at one time he realized that 1t might not be as kosher for certain\nreasons, I don\u2019t know. Then he says, I\u2019m not going to eat in your house again. So I\nwent to Brooklyn and I brought in food for him, you know [indecipherable]. But\nmy younger brother, Shlerma(ph) \u2014 and I used to talk to him, you know, but I didn\u2019t\nsay anything; he became an atheist. So I says [indecipherable] sometimes, why. He\nsays, 1f God could stay up there and watch two million boys and girls as young as I\nMarch 2, 2010\nget killed, He didn\u2019t do nothing, he says, why should I believe in Him? I am relig \u2014\nPll go \u2014I go to synagogue, I sometimes read the Torah sometimes here \u2014 here in\nnew yor \u2014 in Washington.\nA2: Leisure World.",
        "A: Leisure World. And we observe, we have a kosher home, but I\u2019m not as\nreligious as I should have been, or \u2014 or as \u2014 and it \u2014 I f\u2014I feel comfortable like this,\nyou know.",
        "Q: And before we ask \u2014 then we ask, is there anything else you think is important to\nknow before we conclude? How your earlier experiences changed your life after the\nwar, influenced the decisions you made after the war?",
        "A: Well \u2014",

        "Q: And then we \u2014 and your wife\u2019s name?",
        "A: Lucy. And thank God, you know, we build a nice hou \u2014 home. I have two\nchildren, a daughter and a son, and I have five grandchildren, three boys, and they\nall have a kosher home, you know.

        "A: After we finished school around two \u2014 two o\u2019clock or three o\u2019clock, I don\u2019t\nremember, we went straight to the cheder.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: Well, it was not \u2014 it was not \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I \u2014 this I cou-couldn\u2019t tell really, because\nI remember when it used to be Christmastime. We had to close the windows and\nclose the doors, and lock the windows for the protection, otherwise all \u2014 all the\nwindows would have been broken from the house. Cause this 1s the way it di \u2014\nbecause th-they demonstrated during the day Christmastime. Not the Jews, but the\nnon-Jews. And that\u2019s what brought up the hatred, a little bit. But then during the rest\nof the year, my father had the butcher store, here was kosher and here was non-\nkosher, different part. So they used to come and buy meats from us.",
        "A: This is a hard question to answer, because when children get together, you know,\nthey love each other, or they not \u2014 they hate each other, not e \u2014 but there was\nnothing really involved that we hate each other or something, just fun. But later on,\nyou know, when I was already 12 years, 13, I remember certain things, yeah, in\nschool. But by that time the Hungarians already occupied us, in 1940.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: My father spoke Hungarian, because he was in the first World War, and that was\nduring the Hungarian time. And most of them spoke Romanian and \u2014 but that \u2014\nsomebody else spoke Hungarian, I really don\u2019t know. You know, it\u2019s tough.",
        "A: I\u2014y-yes, in the same town, next door was \u2014 lived my father\u2019s sister. And the\ntown next, two kilometers away, lived his brother. So it was always together, you\ncould walk \u2014 Saturday you could walk the three kilometers and meet, you know.",
        "A: Holidays, sometimes but not really, because everybody had a big family, and you\ndidn\u2019t have homes that big, you know.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s father lived about half a kilometer away from us, on this side of the\ntown, and we lived almost on this side of the town. But the cheder was across the\nstreet from him, the cheder where I went.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: And he was a very religious person, you know. So the kids who came into the\nsyn \u2014 to the synagogue Saturday morning, they were afraid for for Selig(ph). His\nname was Selig(ph) Lassa(ph). Because he just took a look, and everybody was\ntrembling.",
        "A: This I wouldn\u2019t know, you know, what his occupation, because I think he lived to\nbe 80 or 85 or something, you know, because he was quite old when we \u2014 we knew\nhim, because my mother was the youngest get \u2014 to get married, and she was born in\n1994.",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "A: No, beca \u2014 not completely, you know. The only knowledge we could know, if\nsomebody came from that area, from somewhere in [indecipherable], because there\nwas no telephones in the town. There was no electricity in town, and once in a while\nyou just got the newspaper from somewhere else, you know. So it\u2019s \u2014 and nobody\nMarch 2, 2010\nreally knew until later, whatever happened in Poland, or whatever happened\nsomewhere else.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014 I remember that, but as a young boy, you\u2019re not that much interest what\nhe has to say, you know, because you wouldn\u2019t understand it much.",
        "A: You know, really. I\u2019m telling the truth.",
        "A: In 1940, when Hitler told Horthy, whatever his name was, from Hungary, you\ncan re-occupy this area, Maramures, you can re-occupy that you had it the first \u2014\nbefore the first World War. So the soldiers came and traveled days and nights. You\nknow, they \u2014 they could not have that many soldiers that they should go around and\nwe should see them for two weeks. But we saw the same guys coming the same day.",
        "A: It \u2014 not at the moment, the first year it didn\u2019t really change, you know? The only\nthing is, we had to learn a different language and we went to [indecipherable]\nschool, and we didn\u2019t understand anything what we \u2014 because it was Hungarian\nalready, Hungary. So you didn\u2019t understand anything, because we went to\nRomanian school as children, you know.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: I\u2019m sure they ki \u2014 brought in the teachers, because the teachers that we knew \u2014\nand I really didn\u2019t know whether they speak hungar \u2014 I know my father spoke\nHungarian for one reason, because the soldiers must have had on their agenda\ncertain things that Yorel(ph) Pollak was \u2014 was a g-gender(ph) urmeshda(ph) they\ncall it that time, like a \u2014 not a general \u2014 not a \u2014 1n the army, like a\u2014 how do you call\nit? A little officer, you know, in the army, in the first World War. So the soldiers\nwho passed through my town, some of them stopped in our house, and they wanted\nto have some wine to drink and this [indecipherable]. So I knew, but we were not\nallowed to go into the room when they talked to my father, as children. Nobody was\nallowed to know.",
        "A: He wouldn\u2019t \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t hurt us, you mean, he wouldn\u2019t say that\nthat\u2019s what they said, and things like th \u2014 but later on, we felt something 1s not right.\nBut at 1942 already, I had somebody come, a friend came from \u2014 who went to\nBudapest a half a year before. [indecipherable] And he says, Ernie, you\u2019re already\n13 - 14 years old, 15 years old, 15 and a half years old. Come to me with \u2014 to\nBudapest and you'll learn a trade. What are you gonna do in this small town? I was\nMarch 2, 2010\nvery good with my hands and making, you know, certain things, you know, in\njewelry or anything. So he says, come, you\u2019re gonna become a jeweler.",
        "A: And I went right after Pesach, when he went back. I went back to Budapest and\nI couldn\u2019t get anything on the jewelry, I couldn\u2019t get \u2014 so he says, let\u2019s go to a dental\nlaboratory, maybe you\u2019re gonna be \u2014 they\u2019re going to teach you to be a dental\ntechnician, cause he was there in that place also. But he quit after a while, you know,\nso I went in there and I stood there til the Germans came in, for a year and a half,\nalmost two years.",
        "A: Lived in Budapest.",
        "A: Yes, because we used to write, we used to write almost every week, you know, in\nYiddish we used to write the postcard. But my older brother was with me that time,\nbecause he also wanted to come to Budapest, away from the small town, let\u2019s put it\nthis way.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, easier to earn a living, because politically I did not \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether\nanybody as young boys and girls thought about politically at that time, but they saw\nthat you could sense certain thing. You sensed it, but you didn\u2019t make anything of it,\nas long as you were okay. But to make a living had gotten harder in the town, so I\nfigured I got to learn a trade.",
        "A: Yes, the last year especially.",
        "A: Changed \u2014 they were not allowed \u2014 let\u2019s say, soon as the ger \u2014 soon as the\nHungarians came in, and my father was a butcher in the \u2014 in the Jew \u2014ina\u2014ina\nstrictly Orthodox sense, you know? And a \u2014 and you have to slaughter a cow or a\ncalf or a sheep in a certain way to be kosher. You have to slaughter. You have to get\na shochet, right?",
        "A: So we used to have our own place, you know, we were three butchers\n[indecipherable]. And we had the same place, we just \u2014 to take the cows, or the\nMarch 2, 2010\ncalf, or the \u2014 the \u2014 to slaughter. But as soon as the Hungarians came in, they forbid\nyou. You\u2019re not allowed to get a shochet to slaughter. How do you have to slaughter\nthe cow? You got to hit it right here.",
        "A: Which is \u2014 that\u2019s ridiculous because when you\u2019re slaughtering, the reason why\nyou slaughter the cow, because you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re taking all the veins, which are here,\nand the blood comes out from the animal. So this is what you call it the kosher.\nNothing could happen to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the meat, or to whatever. So that\n[indecipherable] so, right away, even while I was still home.",
        "A: No, he st \u2014 no, no, we still had the meat, kosher meat, cause instead of going in\nduring the day to slaughter, you went in two o\u2019clock at night.",
        "A: And we were hiding it.",
        "A: Yeah, we took my older brother \u2014 took my older brother Moishe(ph), and me and\nmy father, and we went down and we took the shochet and they slaughtered it.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, they knew it, because the shochet lived in town, you know, so they\nknew it. But it gotten always a little bit worse, because when I \u2014 when Hitler came\ninto Budapest in May, I think it was in \u2014 not in May \u2014",
        "A: March. March 17. Came into Budapest. I already had letters from my hometown,\nfrom my father, that in April, and before April, they already gathered them, you\nknow, in the synagogue, and they already started the transports to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Th-Th-They came in \u2014 they came into Budapest in March, but to my hometown\nthey came in earlier. This why I said, because I got a notice from my parents in\nApril yet, that we were gathered already to be shipped out somewhere, but I didn\u2019t\nknow any place where, I didn\u2019t know nothing.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: Where \u2014 where my brother \u2014 only my brother who was with me in Budapest,\nthat\u2019s it. I didn\u2019t know nothing what happened with them the first two months.",
        "A: Yes, because they were \u2014 the four of them that were younger, and my sister, and\nthey were \u2014 yeah, my sister [indecipherable] so my sister was older, but were still\nhome, you know. Only my second, the one who was after my sister, David and I\n[indecipherable] the fourth, were in Budapest, the rest, six, were already a-all\nhome, didn\u2019t go no place. As a matter of fact, I found out after the war that my older\nbrother Moishe(ph) was going to run over to Poland and hide some \u2014 somewhere\nthere. But this 1s what somebody told me who I met after the war.",
        "A: Yeah, I worked in a laboratory.",
        "A: It was not bad, let\u2019s put it this way. Really not \u2014 before the \u2014 before the Germans\ncame in, it was not bad.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: I was living in Dabutsa(ph), it was not far from the real \u2014 the synagogue, you\nknow, I was living by mys \u2014 by a \u2014 by a\u2014 an older couple who rented me a room.\nNot my own apartment, or my own [indecipherable] gave me a room \u2014",
        "A: Yes. And as a matter of fact, the Dahani(ph) synagogue was not far away, and I\nused to go every Friday night to listen to the cantor. You know, it\u2019s used \u2014 things\nfrom home, so I\u2014 so I was going every Friday night to listen to the cantor because I\nwanted to, and my older brother did the same thing.",
        "A: No, no, because they didn\u2019t have big rooms enough to have two people living\nthere, so he lived in another apartment with somebody else, another older couple.",
        "A: Yes, we saw each other frequently, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, we looked out of the windows and we saw the marching. And each one\ncame to sou \u2014 there\u2019s gonna be trouble, it\u2019s gonna be trouble. Because a few days\nMarch 2, 2010\nlater, they already send out notices to the Jewish people like no \u2014 now, if I had to put\ndown a stick here, and start a [indecipherable] and if somebody killed me during\nthe day, he knew nothing is going to happen to him, because the Germans 1s not\ngoing to prosecute him, or the Hungarians, because he killed a Jew. So you were\nafraid to go out on the street.",
        "A: The Hungarians were almost the same way, you know. Almost \u2014 almost like the\nGermans. Now, but that time, I don\u2019t know how much control the Germans had yet,\nbut the Hungarian army had a lot of control. I guess Hitler gave them the \u2014 gave\nthem that they can do that. They called munka [indecipherable] zwangsarbeit, you\nknow, forced labor for the Jewish people.",
        "A: For forced labor I co \u2014 was called \u2014 even though you\u2019re supposed to be only 18 y\n\u2014 you\u2019re supposed to be 18 years old, but I was called up. And you had to wear a\ncard with the s \u2014 with the re \u2014 with the \u2014 with the yellow band here, and gather here\nand then they took you to forced labor. Because by that time, the Americans \u2014 the\nAmericans did a lot of damage to Budapest. They bombed a lot of things, important\nthings in Budapest. And they marched us to clean up whatever they had there.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: No, my brother ran \u2014 somewhere was hiding. He found a \u2014 he found a family that\nhe could hide, you know. And he had a girlfriend, you know. And to me, I think he\ndisappeared during this time already. I didn\u2019t see him and I didn\u2019t know where he 1s,\nbecause see, either he didn\u2019t want to come out, he should be recognized. So I had to\ndo things on my own, even though I wasn\u2019t 18 years old yet. But they took me to\nthese kind of works. And then, month later, this was \u2014 let\u2019s see, this was May, June,\nJuly, around July already \u2014 I mean, rumors went down that they\u2019re going to ship us\naway to ric \u2014 to a camp, right. So, because we lived already in a ghetto.",
        "A: It\u2019s called a close out there, close ou \u2014 I mean, the streets, just like let\u2019s say you \u2014\nyou \u2014 your Connecticut circle or something like this. So this is the streets that they\nhave. And that was a ghetto there.",
        "A: In the ghetto, each day, they knew because they came into the hall in the bottom,\nyou know, in those \u2014 because the ghetto is, you know you're there, they have the big\napartments here, and here 1s like a garage you can come in the middle, you know.\nAnd all you had to see, all the Jewish people should come down, you know, and\nMarch 2, 2010\nthey knew who we are. So they forced us to the labor camp, because most of them\nwere Jewish, you know.",
        "A: In the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the ghetto. In the ghetto. Because I remember the\nHolocaust Museum\u2019s name, what 1s the street where you \u2014",
        "A: Raoul Wallen \u2014 I saw him.",
        "A: He was still there when we \u2014 he gathered us \u2014 you know, a lot of Jews who were\nbelow 18, you had to be still, you know, gathered us, because I would have been 18\nin 2,000 \u2014 in na \u2014 in \u2014 in September, but that was, I think, a little before September,\nbecause I think they were \u2014 he came from \u2014 from Sweden bu \u2014 Sweden bu \u2014 but we\ndidn\u2019t know anything about it. So he told \u2014 spoke to hundreds or maybe thousands\nof Jewish boys and girls, you know. What was the talk? Hitler wants the Americans\nshould \u2014 I should [indecipherable] to the Americans. They want 10,000 trucks and\nhe\u2019s gonna let 10,000 boys and girls go to America. Jewish. But the Americans\nrefused the trucks, so the Germans came right away to cross [indecipherable]\nAustria.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t know. Really I wouldn\u2019t know. But you know, you didn\u2019t \u2014 you\ndidn\u2019t go there every day, because you weren\u2019t in the ghetto, you know, in the place\nthat\u2019s a\u2014 maybe it was in the shul, in the synagogue that he gathered us, or\nsomewhere else. But you know when you\u2019re this age and you \u2014 one day you come\nand one day you don\u2019t come. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not something that \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014\nthat you believe something is going to happen, you know. You hope, but \u2014 and then\nthey just disappeared, everything.",
        "A: In the ghetto nobody had enough to eat. That \u2014 they gave us, let\u2019s say, a bread,\nfor three days, a pound of bread, or four days. Now, you tried not to eat it, correct, in\nMauthausen, you tried to eat every day a piece. But you had to sleep with it, you\nhad to hide it, you had \u2014 otherwise somebody stole it from you.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: We were \u2014 we were \u2014 we were walked, we were not thre \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 they didn\u2019t\n\u2014 see, let\u2019s say this is Budapest, Hungary, and this 1s the border to go to Austria.\nAnd Mauthausen could be here, maybe 500 kilometers, or I don\u2019t know how much.\nSo we walked from here, over here and here.",
        "A: Th-They made us sleep in certain places, I\u2019d say \u2014",
        "A: It took maybe a month, or maybe six weeks, or maybe two months, I don\u2019t know\nexactly.",
        "A: This \u2014 well, you marched, because \u2014 this I wouldn\u2019t know. No, you just obeyed\norders, you know.",
        "A: Right, right, but \u2014 but the \u2014 the funny thing 1s this, because I been saying those\nthings too. Once we crossed the border, is we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t sleep outside\nbecause it \u2014 the winter started to come, you know, 1n \u2014 in \u2014 in September, October,\nthere\u2019s cold already. So \u2014 so, in certain places where they knew the \u2014 let\u2019s say they\ntook us into a place like this, which in \u2014 can take in, 1f you want to sleep 30 - 40\nMarch 2, 2010\npeople, so they put in a hundred people. So you couldn\u2019t sleep, you couldn\u2019t lay\ndown. You could only stay. Now, if somebody died \u2014 I se \u2014 I been saying this all the\ntime, if somebody died, you didn\u2019t report it to them, you just took them as \u2014 as a\npillow, and you slept on them, you know. So that was a difficult situation, walking\nand stopping, and walking until we reached Mauthausen.",
        "A: No, once we crossed \u2014 we went, we crossed the \u2014 from ha \u2014 from Hungary, that\nwas the Austrian army.",
        "A: Hungary was Hungarians, yeah.",
        "A: Well, I had \u2014 no, see, it was too late for that time when we came to the ghetto, or\nthe changes, the clothes like you see in the movies that you had those stripes and\n[indecipherable] no.",
        "A: We did have \u2014 we still have the \u2014 had the \u2014 only the clothes that we came with,\nyou know. Nothing else but a pair of pants and a jacket an-and a shirt or whatever,\nand that\u2019s it. Cause you couldn\u2019t \u2014 we were not allowed to take anything with you\nMarch 2, 2010\nwhile you were walking, cause you didn\u2019t have nowhere to put it, no place, you\nknow.",
        "A: In the ghetto they fed us once a day, lunchtime. So in other words, they gave you\na bread for three, four days. You had to be your own master on it, to eat 1t one time,\nor you can not eat nothing for the next three days, or just cut it, or \u2014 or tear off a\npiece and eat today and tear off a piece and eat tomorrow.",
        "A: While we were marching, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s gonna be stopped, because\nthey have nothing to feed us when we were walk. They brought us a soup\nsometimes, you know, later on, because let\u2019s say we stopped five o\u2019clock, two hours\nlater they brought in the [indecipherable] you know, for everybody something. But\nfood, forget it, it\u2019s not really \u2014",

        "A: I only think I watched because they told you when you walked, let\u2019s say here,\nfive people walked in the street, and they announced it in German, if somebody\u2019s\ngoing to step out, is gonna be shot. So everybody was \u2014 was very, very alert, just to\nwalk exactly behind anybody, not to step out this way from the line.",
        "A: They stopped, but they didn\u2019t say a word, you know. They laughed, they didn\u2019t s\n\u2014 didn\u2019t say a word, I mean, it\u2019s nothing.",
        "A: Oh, they enjoyed it. This 1s the way it looked to us, you know.",
        "A: Most of it the countryside, you know. Sometimes you had to walk through a\ntown, because in order to find somewhere to put us up, so the towns had \u2014 either\nthey had the churches, or they had other things. [indecipherable] you could \u2014 you\nMarch 2, 2010\ncould \u2014 stalls, you know, from \u2014 for the cows.

        "A: No.",
        "A: Eventually we arrived in Mauthausen, but Mauthausen was so full that they\ndidn\u2019t have empty space for us where to put it \u2014 put us.

        "A: Scary, very scary. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s hap \u2014 gonna happen. You did not\nknow nothing. The only thing you heard, a lot of bombing at night, because I think\nMarch 2, 2010\nthe Americans already bombed these places. Because they bombed Budapest and\nthe Americans [indecipherable] was still there. And they bombed, you know, so th-\nthat\u2019s the only thing we could hear.",

        "A: No. This why I\u2019m saying this, I found this picture in my pocket.",
        "A: Most of the time no, because you know, every \u2014 every barrack had \u2014 had a\u2014a\nkapo, a leader, a Jewish leader, that\u2019s it. The Germans said, you\u2019re going to be the\nkapo, you\u2019re going to be responsible for those thousand people. They cannot go out\nunless you take them out. We tell you to take mi \u2014 take out 10 or 20 or 30, and go\nthere and there.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, because m-maybe I \u2014 maybe when you\u2019re younger than \u2014\nthey were older people there also with us. They probably would have known certain\nthings or they would have, you know. But my a \u2014 my impression was to just keep\nquiet and don\u2019t mix in, and don\u2019t do just you are t \u2014 what you are told. That was my\nimpression and this what I did.",
        "A: Right, the same. You see, as \u2014 as \u2014 as they came closer, the Germans \u2014 I mean,\nthe Americans, you know, occupy this part of Austria and this part, they came\n[indecipherable] closer \u2014 I\u2019m talking months later, they used to take us out to work\non schutzengraben.",
        "A: Schitzengraben. This is for the \u2014 for the army it was you go into those foxholes.",
        "A: Yep, we are digging, digging and digging, di-digging, and digging and digging\nand then brought back, you know, brought back you know, but \u2014 and then the\nAmericans still came closer, right. So this was already January, February. In\nFebruary, I think, in the beginning of February they marched us out from\nMauthausen \u2014 or \u2014 or in January, I\u2019m not sure \u2014 marched us out from Mauthausen,\nand they took us to a place, Gunskirchen.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: Worse. Because that was in ou \u2014 in the mountains, you know, and it was raining\nand muddy. You \u2014 you \u2014 you couldn\u2019t even go and lay down to sleep, you can only\nstay, because the mud was still here.",
        "A: In the barracks, with no floors. Til \u2014 til May the fourth, of the liberation.",
        "A: I talked so much about that liberation day. We get up in the morning from like I\nsaid, the kapo. Me \u2014 not me, because the older people who were in the camp. So the\nkapo going in and out, several kapos, knock on doors \u2014 on there. They didn\u2019t know\nwhat happened. So I don\u2019t know, at 10 o\u2019clock or 11 o\u2019clock [indecipherable]\npeople looked out, they didn\u2019t see any Germans in the uniforms, they didn\u2019t see any\nbe \u2014 if they saw a German he was running this way, you know. So they came in and\ntold everybody, something is wrong, something 1s going on, you know. But by two\no\u2019clock, you know, the kapo came in, says the German left because the Americans\nare coming. But we have to wait til the Americans are going to come here, because\nyo-you don\u2019t know where the Germans are now. They are not here. If you go out\nnow, you might find a German who can do harm to you. So we were in there, but\nsome people, older people, younger people \u2014 I was too weak and too young to s \u2014 to\nMarch 2, 2010\n\u2014 to think, went out from the \u2014 from the \u2014 from the barracks, and they went to the \u2014\nwhere they had the food that \u2014 you know \u2014 and started to open up the stores there,\nwhatever they have sas \u2014 and they started to bring it into the camp, you know. The\nreason why I remember these things, I was too weak to go there, so I stood by the\ndoor \u2014 my wife, I used to tell her that story, and this was a funny thing, what\nhappened. I see one fellow, maybe a little older, a year or two than I, which I never\nknew him, comes in with \u2014 with something in his hands like this, a jar like, you\nknow.\nA2: Honey.",
        "A: Honey. I didn\u2019t know it\u2019s honey. So I j \u2014 I was laying down there and I jump up\nand I grab it. And it made him full of honey on his face, and he was very angry at\nme. But I had some honey, and \u2014 and started eating. And then I didn\u2019t see him again,\nwe didn\u2019t \u2014 no, we didn\u2019t. But \u2014 [\u2019Il tell this later on. So by f\u2014I think it was around\nfour o\u2019clock, was no \u2014 who had watches, but we just looked at \u2014 was around four\no\u2019clock that the Americans came in. And they opened the door, so they says, you\ncan go any place you want. So where do you go from d\u2014 you don\u2019t know \u2014 nobody\nknew where. So they directed us to go into the town, it\u2019s called Wels. Wels, it\u2019s 30\nkil \u2014 30 kilometers or less than Linz \u2014 from Linz. So we all went into that town, I\ndon\u2019t know how many thousands of people, but a day later \u2014 we slept outside,\nMarch 2, 2010\nbecause there is no place where to sleep. A day later and two days later and three\ndays later, we were still walking around [indecipherable], but the Americans came\nwith their Jeeps and grabbed us, put us in in the Jeep and brought us to Wels,\nbecause Wels had room for thousands of people because it was an SS camp,\nofficers\u2019 camp. And everything was empty, so they brought us there, you know. So\nwe are there and they didn\u2019t know how to feed us, so they gave us too much food. A\nfew days later, I je \u2014 I remember on a Sunday morning, hundreds of people were\nlaying outside hardly breathing because their stomachs swelled up, you know. And \u2014\nan-and I found right there, some of my \u2014 some \u2014 two people from my hometown\nlaying there.",
        "A: No, no I didn\u2019t know. What happened to them, I don\u2019t know, I think one of them\ndied, but what happened to the other one, I really don\u2019t know. But then the\nAmericans got somebody in and they \u2014 and they advised them what to cook and\nwhat to serve for those people, otherwise [indecipherable] are gonna die.",
        "A: Yes.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: Yeah. They were \u2014 just nothing, I mean, they j \u2014 they just looked, I suppose. I\nmean, nobody had any conversation with them. Not me, and not \u2014 not my friends\nwho were with me. Friends \u2014 those people who came with me. So we just looked\nand looked and looked, you know, so \u2014 but \u2014 until the Americans came and took us\ninto the Jeep, said, let\u2019s go \u2014 no, come. So, I remember else, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m a week, two\nweeks, three weeks, I think after the fourth or the fifth week, I don\u2019t remember\nexactly because nobody counted. I\u2019m in the \u2014 in the \u2014 taking a shower, because it\nhas community showers, like the people, you know, here for the women and here for\nthe men. And I\u2019m walking out dressed up to take a shave or whatever it 1s, and a girl\ncomes over to me. And she looks at me. She says, I know your name. So I almost\ndropped dead. You know, she said, what do you mean you [indecipherable] in\nYiddish [indecipherable] she says, your name is Ernie Pollak. So I figured right\naway somebody knew. Says, how do you know\u201d? She says, I was with your sister in\nthe camp. Her name is Bluma(ph) Park. So I says, oh my God, tell me exactly\nwhere, you know, this was at \u2014 it was already four or five weeks, I don\u2019t know\nexact. So she says to me, she is in Bergen-Belsen. Now, Bergen-Belsen, I don\u2019t\nknow how many hundreds of kilome \u2014 kilometers, because it was in Germany \u2014 it\nwas from there. Now I would not \u2014 I did not expect that I\u2019m gonna figure th \u2014 say to\nmyself I\u2019m going to go to Bergen-Belsen, how am I gonna go to Bergen-Belsen? |\nMarch 2, 2010\ndon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have good clothes even, I don\u2019t have [indecipherable]. So she\nsays, when I came here, I came from Feldafing, an \u2014 another DP camp. She says,\nyou come with me to Feldafing, you know. She came to see her brother, she found\nout that her brother was \u2014 was in Wels with me. And she\u2019s, you come with me, and\nthen from there you gonna go to Bergen-Belsen, which is not that far. So I went to\nBergen-Belsen, it took us three months. We got to Bergen-Belsen Erev rontef \u2014\nErev Rosh Hashanah. Can you imagine how \u2014 how long it took us to go there? I\nfound some people from my hometown, you know, and I started asking questions.\nYou know Gans(ph) [indecipherable] his brother, you know? And he says, your\nsister was never here. Whoever I asked, your sister was never here. Nobody knew\nwhat \u2014 what I\u2019m asking, nobody knew her, nobody \u2014 so, I don\u2019t know why she said\nto me that my sister is in Bergen-Belsen. But I was glad I was there amongst some\nother people that I know from my hometown. And then, a year later \u2014 and I\u2019m just\njumping certain things because there\u2019s a lot of things from here til the year later, I\njust want to bring two things together about that fellow that I took the honey.",
        "A: He came with his sister from Romania back to Bergen-Belsen, because he also\nsaid something, because we are sitting, you know, in Bergen-Belsen with friends,\nhaving lunch or something. Ber-Bergen-Belsen was also a camp which it had a \u2014\nMarch 2, 2010\nA2: A DP camp.",
        "A: A DP camp, yeah, because you know where Anne Frank was?",
        "A: It\u2019s jus \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 Anne Frank was in Belsen. And Bergen was a\u2014 was an SS\ncamp, which it had 10 - 15,000 officers there, you know. And ben \u2014 berry \u2014 when vi\n\u2014 the liberation was, they took from Belsen th \u2014 where Anne Frank was, all boys\nand girls in here to the Bergen camp, because they had where to live there, but in a\nconcentration camp. So it became Bergen-Belsen, together. So I sitting at a table,\nand this guy was sitting with his sister, you know, I mean that\u2019s much later, about\nhalf a year later, or \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or 10 months later. And we are talking, what do we\ntalk, with him and with him and with him, we telling the stories about camp, we\ntelling the stories about camp, we telling what happened this. And I happened to tell\nthat story. The guy sitting in front of me, he said, you son of a gun, 1t was you who\ndid this to me. And [indecipherable] you know who.",
        "A: So I apologized, what can I do? But we were friends, all the way. We came to the\nUnited States aga \u2014 together, and he wasn\u2019t \u2014 he wasn\u2019t in a \u2014 used \u2014 I used to\ninvite him to \u2014 to my Bar Mitzvahs to the kids, and th-that. So it worked out, you\nknow, thank God, you know.\nMarch 2, 2010",
        "A: Well, in order for me to find my sister and the rest of them, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a story, if\nyou\u2019re ready. Bergen-Belsen was a camp for thousands of boys and girls, thousands\nof them. And we \u2014 you know how it was, there was nothing to do. There was\nnothing to do. You go again to eat lunch, you go again to eat breakfast, you go again\neat. Was nothing. It was separated by Bergen-Belsen and five different camps:\ncamp one, camp two, camp three, camp four. And each one had about a thousand\nboys and girls or \u2014 or maybe more. You had to get a bicycle to travel somewhere, so\nafter I was there six or seven months, the Haganah came down, the Israeli hag \u2014\nsoldiers, maybe a hundred of them, dressed in civilian clothes, cause Bergen-Belsen\nwas under the \u2014 the eng \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 England\u2019s occupation. No, not\nAmerican, was England, you know. And they started to get 50 people here in this\nroom, 50 people here in this room, 60 people here, or a hundred people here. And\nthey used to talk to us, what you should do. And nobody knew whether anybody\nsurvived. So they used to say like this here; you, I\u2019m gonna give you five postcards;\nyou I\u2019m gonna give five post \u2014 postcards. Write the name where the postcards\nshould go, to your hometown; whether it\u2019s Romania, Czechoslovakia, or \u2014 0-or it\u2019s\nHungary, or \u2014 or \u2014 0-or it\u2019s in Poland, or it\u2019s in any of these places. He says, I\ndon\u2019t care how long it\u2019s gonna take to get there, just write the name to go there. And\nMarch 2, 2010\nwrite not the name, just write to the city hall. This postcard should go to the city hall\nfor Osovish(ph) let\u2019s say, to my hometown. And in the other side write, my name is\nErnie Pollak. The first Jew who comes into the town, give him my postcard. Don\u2019t\nyou think I wrote one day, I wrote next day. About three months later I get a\npostcard from my younger brother.",
        "A: No, he was in Auschwitz, but he \u2014 they send him from Auschwitz to a camp, to\na labor camp. And he says to me, your older brother is alive, and your older sister is\nalive, and they are in this and this town in Romania. I came to my homet \u2014 to our\nhometown, and there\u2019s nothing here. Don\u2019t come home. I\u2019m gonna come to you. Of\nc-course I wrote the address where I am, this why the postcard came to me. Says\ndon\u2019t come home. It took a few months and then he got to me. So we were already \u2014",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, he told me that my older brother \u2014 as a matter of fact, years \u2014 a little while\nlater, my older brother, like I said in the beginning, that he and his girlfriend \u2014 he\nMarch 2, 2010\nhad a girlfriend in Budapest \u2014 he found her after the war because they were\nliberated in December, I think, \u201944. He found her, they got married and they got\nhome, he went home, December [indecipherable] not in Budapest, it was \u2014 well\nmaybe to her hometown. And she had a baby girl, and she got very sick, she fell off\na table, something with her foot, she \u2014 and they had to go to Vienna. Later on, I\ndon\u2019t know when this happened, maybe a year later, she had to go to Vienna when\nshe was a year old, or three years old, in order to fix her leg. But while he was in\nVienna, he stood there already for a while, you know. And then he came to Bergen-\nBelsen. I don\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t even remember why they came to Bergen-Belsen,\nbut he came to the United States after this.",

Gans(ph), Gans(ph), I met, from my\nMarch 2, 2010\nhometown, and the first thing he told me, I was with your father, and with your\nbrother Moishe(ph) in camp together, but a few days before the liberation, they\nmoved us from one place to the next place, and we had to walk and walk. And your\nbrother went out of \u2014 ran \u2014 went out of line, Moishe, and he ran to a store, and \u2014 and\nthe SS ran after him. But your father ran after him also, to bring him back, so I heard\ntwo shots. So they must have shot both of them, cause only the SS came out, and\nyour brother and father didn\u2019t come out from that store. This is two days before the\nliberation. That\u2019s all I know.",
        "A: Because they were too young anyway, because I know my mother got killed in\nAuschwitz with the rest of the three or four sibling, a little girl. Because one was\nborn 1930 \u2014 \u201930, one was born 1938 \u2014",

One of my mo \u2014 my brother\u2019s sisters came to my hometo \u2014 our hometown,\nbecause my mother gave birth to a boy and she wanted to name him \u2014 to name the\nboy after her husband who died in \u2014 in \u2014 in New York. But the husband \u2014 in \u2014 not\nnew \u2014 yeah, but her husband had a brother in the small town \u2014 1n the middle time,\nyou know [indecipherable] brother. Now in the Jewish religion, if you want \u2014 1f the\nbrother is alive, in the Orthodox religion, and if you have a boy and you want to give\nhis name [indecipherable] the person, hi-his wife has to get Halitzah, separation.\nSo whi \u2014 she came from New York to my hometown \u2014 to our hometown, and he\ngathered the full synagogue and they made \u2014 the rabbi made Halitzah, in other\nwords a separation from her husband, who was dead, and this little boy can be\nnamed on his name. So this how I knew her, and then you know, we se \u2014 my\nMarch 2, 2010\nyounger brother said look, we have very no \u2014 whoever remained alive, your sisters\nwent to Israel. We have to wait to go to New York to see the rest of the family. And\nthis 1s what we did.",

My older brother became\nOrthodox also, because he was Orthodox always, and he didn\u2019t leave. So a matter of\nfact, I have a kosher home and sometimes he realized and he used to come and eat in\nmy house. And at one time he realized that 1t might not be as kosher for certain\nreasons, I don\u2019t know. Then he says, I\u2019m not going to eat in your house again. So I\nwent to Brooklyn and I brought in food for him, you know [indecipherable]. But\nmy younger brother, Shlerma(ph) \u2014 and I used to talk to him, you know, but I didn\u2019t\nsay anything; he became an atheist. So I says [indecipherable] sometimes, why. He\nsays, 1f God could stay up there and watch two million boys and girls as young as I\nMarch 2, 2010\nget killed, He didn\u2019t do nothing, he says, why should I believe in Him?
