        "Q: Could you please tell us your name and where and when you were born?",
        "A: Henry G., G for George, Plitt. I was born in New York City in 1918 and that, of course,\nwas late in the year that year, just two weeks after the Armistice for World War I.",
        "Q: And where were you educated?",
        "A: I started in New York City, and I went to grammar school there, and one year at DeWitt\nClinton High School, after which my family sent me to a military academy in Stanton,\nStaunton, Virginia. It's spelled Staunton. It's pronounced Stanton and there I began my\nmilitary career.",
        "Q: And you stayed at the military academy through the end of high school?",
        "A: Well, I graduated from Staunton in 1935 at which time I went to Syracuse University and\nthere I went in the ROTC, so again we've got another three or four years, three years of\nmilitary and I was eligible to become an officer by then with six years of military under\nmy belt, but I wasn't old enough. In those days you had to be twenty-one to be...",
        "Q: An officer...",
        "A: A lieutenant. So that began my relationship with the army. Now I was in law school in St.\nLawrence University, Brooklyn, and at this time...it was getting close to 1940...it was in\n'38 and '39, and my family managed through an organization called HIAS to bring into\nthis country some of my relatives who were in the German occupied areas and when\n[...when I heard their story, I just made up my mind that all this was...one man was\nresponsible for all this and his name was Hitler and somehow or other I wanted to kill\nhim. Now that sounds terrible in the light of today's world, but at that time when you\nheard those horror stories, you couldn't do anything but want to destroy this person who\nwas responsible for it, so I switched my allegiance in the army to parachute troops\nbecause at that time parachute troops were trained to blow up bridges, blow up planes,\ndrop behind the lines, assassinate, execute and all this kind of thing. But during our\nperiod of training, it was very strange but many, many people came into parachute troops\nand before the training was over, we suddenly had ourselves a a regiment of men and\nnow the tactics were not going to be the same. The regiment, incidentally, grew into\ndivisions, and by the time we jumped in Normandy there were three divisions that went\nin. There was the 10Ist, the 82nd and the British 36th Airborne, so you can see that the\nidea of jumping behind the lines and killing Hitler was a long way from potential fruition.\nIt just couldn't happen that way, so that's that's an answer to your question and when did I\nget in the army or how or why.",
        "Q: Now we won't focus on this. I know you have a very interesting aspect of your military\ncareer in terms of the landing at Normandy. Could you briefly tell us a little bit about\nthat...what...what exactly your role was?",
        "A: Well, all...all I can tell you is that the only reason...it was a quirk of fate...the only reason\nthat I ended up with the first group to jump in Normandy 1s the man that we had selected\nas our pathfinder, the day before during the period Eisenhower delayed for twenty-four\nhours, we had a chance to go up and see what he had done, and we were very dissatisfied\nwith it and my colonel said to me on the way back, Plitt, I want you to go in. Take the\npathfinder detachment in and I'll meet you on the ground and put a DSC on your neck. So\nI...",
        "Q: Distinguished Service Cross?",
        "A: Yes. So I didn't have any choice anyway, but the point is that that put me among...we had\nthree airplane loads going in, the pathfinders, a total of eighteen people per plane for a\ntotal of fifty-four people. And now the actual flight itself over England was nothing but\nwhen we got to the English Channel, we went down on the deck and there were some\nvery exciting moments when the ships at sea were flashing the V for victory sign to us\nright over...right over head and then when we got to Cherbourg we pulled up to five\nhundred feet. Imagine...up to five hundred feet and we went along the line, the road that\nwe had all been briefed so carefully on and studied so long, running from Montberg to\nValone...from Cherbourg to Montberg to Valone on down to St. Mere-Eglise and\nCarentan and so on. And when we got over our drop zone, boom...there it 1s. Now if you\nwant to know what went through my mind, I was just as scared as any human being\n01:02: could be. Here I was jumping into Festung (fortress) Europe, which was a Nazi\ndominated France, German soldiers, and I had an H on my dog tag. Now the H on my\ndog tag stood for Hebrew. At that time the army put your religion on your dog tags and\nthey did it only so that if you need last rites or what have you, they know what you are\nand what you aren't, and they only had three categories. There was P for Protestant, C for\nCatholic and H for Hebrew or Jewish, and so there I was, all alone, in France, German-\noccupied, so the first thing I did (coughing)...excuse me...in an attempt to get mobile or as\nmobile as I could, was to scrap the throwaway things that were weighing me down, such\nas a gas mask and such as binoculars and such as extra rounds of ammunition, and\nsuddenly I got so I could move around with a great degree of ease, and during this period\nI was able to pick up a hundred and one men. Strangely enough, we were the 101st\nAirborne. I picked up a hundred and one men and we attacked the gun position, which\nwas the division mission. Now the reason we did that is that we were supposed to be on\nthe ground for thirty minutes, and after that hearing our own planes come in, we would\nput the lights on. That's what we jumped for...the pathfinders...put the lights on and guide\nthe rest of the units in. For a long time, it got to be very thin and tight and for a long time\nI thought maybe Eisenhower has canceled again, in which case we got to stay here for\ntwenty-four more hours and sweat it out, or...and before the or really had a chance to take\nhold, we could hear the drone of airplanes coming over. For our whole, the first part of\nthe mission, the pathfinder mission was worthless, because these were new pilots who\nhad never flown in combat before and when the anti-aircraft started coming up at them,\nthey broke from formation. They dropped troops in the Channel. They dropped them all\nthe way north to Cherbourg and all the way south to Carentan, and so that part of the\nmission just wasn't.",
        "Q: But you still were one of the first ones to...",
        "A: Well, yeah. I was in the first fifty-four.",
        "Q: I want to move now to your role in a very important historical moment that you had and\nthat's in the capture of...1n the apprehension and the capture of two major figures in\nNazi...the Nazi rule of Germany and in the destruction of the Jews, and I understand the\nfirst one you captured was Robert Ley.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Could you tell us about that?",
        "A: Yeah, it's a very interesting story. We had an arrangement with the Burgermeisters of the\nvarious cities, that if they had any known what would later become termed as war\ncriminals, in their area, they were to notify us. If they intended to hold their job as\nBurgermeister, they better do it. And so we got a call one night. I don't know who was on\nthe board...got a call from a Burgermeister telling us about this man that was living in a\ncertain building. We went to the building and we entered the place that he was supposed\nto occupy and he did. He was in bed and the minute we came in the door, he reached for a\npill on his night table, and one of my boys knocked it out of his hand, and then he said he\ndidn't know why we were bothering him. He was a professor, a teacher. His name was\nDisselbruger (ph) and he...what can I tell you...he claimed to have...he never was a Nazi,\nknew nothing about Nazism and so on. Now I have to take you back for a moment. When\nVE Day came around, which was May the 8th, my particular unit of the 101st Airborne\nwas in an area occupied by 13,000 SS troops. Now there we were, two thousand, now in\ncharge of.,,these people had surrendered, so we took blocks where they put their\nweapons, and blocks where they did this, but in order to control these 13,000 people, we\nhad to get MP's...that's military police...from their own units. We...we...we just didn't\nhave the manpower to do this, so we did that, and in my headquarters was a full colonel\nNazi. At that time I was only a cap...I was a major. In our headquarters there was a full\ncolonel Nazi, and when I walked in with Disselbruger, he clicked his heels, popped to\nattention and said Heil. Now how in the hell can a school teacher have a full colonel do\nthis, so I called division headquarters and I said I'm sending this guy up to you. And I did,\nand he turned out to be Robert Ley, the Minister of Labor, the guy who sent people to the\ncamps and what have you. That's the Robert Ley story.",
        "Q: That's a fascinating story. So his subordinate gave him away?",
        "A: Well, yeah, you could call a full colonel his 01:04: subordinate, but once you knew that\nhe was senior to a full colonel, you knew you had something. But I didn't know who he\nwas.",
        "Q: Now you also had a very important role in the apprehension and the capture of Julius\nStreicher, who was the leading propagandist, anti-Semitic propagandist for the Nazi\nmovement...",
        "A: Well, that that was a more solitary role because I got him by myself.",
        "Q: Could you tell us about how that came about?",
        "A: We also got a tip that there was a a high ranking Nazi living in the town of Widering (ph)\nin Austria and his name we didn't know. I thought it was Heinrich Himmler from the\ndescription, but I didn't have a jeep of my own and I didn't have an interpreter of my own\nat the time, so I borrowed another guy's jeep and his driver and the three of us went up\nthe hill to this house, chalet, chateau, whatever you want to call it, and I entered, my 45 in\nhand, and I went upstairs. There was a man sitting on a chair with an easel to his right\npainting the opposite Alp, and I asked him his name and he told me Joseph Seeler (ph),\nand I said where's your identification papers, and he reached right in back and he pulled\nout an identification paper made out to the name of Joseph Seeler. Now it didn't hit me\nquite that fast that this was Julius Streicher, and I began asking him things about\nHimmler, because I thought I had the wrong guy, and he said he knew nothing about\npolitics. He was a painter. He knew nothing about anything that had to do with what I\nwas interested in and then I don't know why I said, and what about Julius Streicher, and\nhe said: \"Ja, der bin Ich.\u201d Now I got that only from the J S on his work papers.",
        "Q: JS?",
        "A: Joseph Seeler was Julius Streicher. \"Ja, der bin Ich\", which when translated into English\nreads yes, that's who I am. Now we had no further interrogation. In the car, in the jeep on\nthe way, he and I were in the back. I had my gun riding his ribs so nothing was going to\nhappen there. He wasn't going to jump out or commit suicide or anything, and I said to\nhim...this is the only interrogation he got from me...I said to him: \"Sind Sie der Streicher\nder war gegendie Juden?\", which when translated means, are you the Streicher who was\nagainst the Jews. And he very calmly said: \"Ja, der bin Ich\", which meant yes, that's who\nI am, but he might just as well have said so what. I mean he was arrogant to the very end,\nso much so that when we got to Berchtesgarten...oh, I'm sorry... stopped at my\nregimental headquarters to notify them I was bringing him in and Bertchesgarten was\nabout forty miles away from us. When I got to Bertchesgarten, as he was getting out of\nthe jeep, I booted him a little bit so that accelerate his departure, and the place was loaded\nwith reporters and this, that and the other, and one reporter came up to me and he said,\nyou know, you just killed the greatest story of the war. I said how. He said can you\nimagine if a guy named Kohn or Goldberg or Levy had captured this arch-anti-Semite,\nwhat a great story it would be. I said why. He said because a Jew would be doing this,\nand I told him I'm Jewish, and that's when the microphones came into my face and the\ncameras started clicking away and things started to happen that changed the rest of my life.",
        "Q: Did you have any chance to interrogate him further or after that...",
        "A: No. They took him. I took him to division headquarters. They took him on up to Munich\nwhere the army interrogation team was. When I say army that's a division of like a\nregiment or battalion army, and that's where those people were.",
        "Q: How did you feel capturing Ley and even and capturing Streicher?",
        "A: Well, with Ley I just felt it was a part of my job and because there was no direct\nrelationship between Ley and Streicher and between Ley and and what was going on in\nEurope and Germany at the time, but with Streicher there was a very direct relationship.\nWith Ley I didn't even go to division with him. I sent him up with a couple of my men\nbecause I didn't...we didn't know then that it was Ley either, you know, but I sent him up\nwith a couple of my men and with Streicher there was a very personal feeling about the\nwhole thing. I can tell you myself not killing him from time to time when I had the\nopportunity, but I had two other people in the jeep and war or not war you just don't kill\npeople who surrendered, so that's the story of Julius Streicher.",
        "Q: That's an important story. You also had participated I guess earlier than this in the entry\ninto Dachau.",
        "A: Oh yes. That was...",
        "Q: Could you tell us about that?",
        "A: Well, that's...that's a moment that will will live forever. The most outstanding moment of\nthis whole thing, and I'll never forget the word was as we got in there and it was a\nhorrible sight...everything was, huts they lived in, the furnaces that they were burned in,\nand which incidentally were 01:06: crematoriums and as we got there, moving up into\nthis area, one of the men I was with said look at those crematoriums, and another officer\nstanding next to him said no, it's crematoria. That's the plural for crematoriums. I'll never\nforget that because that whole moment was just unbelievable. These people were sitting\non stoops and porches and on the ground. Their bodies were totally emaciated. Their legs\nwere swollen. It was...1t was an unbelievable time and the very same date that we went\nthrough stands there today because I've been back and it's just...it's a moment that is very\ndifficult to describe.",
        "Q: Do you remember the exact day on which you entered?",
        "A: No, I don't. I remember May 8th, you know. I've got those dates, but I can't give you the\nexact day, but I can tell you that about two weeks before...maybe ten days before the 8th\nof May, I saw people walking on the road wearing what we later found out was the\nuniform of the inmates of the the concentration camp, but I had never seen that before...a\npajama looking thing with a blue and a grey. And I said what the hell is this. They got\nanother army here we don't know about. They were walking along the road, and this is in\nthe Alps, but as you got into areas like Munich and what have you, you were getting into\nthe areas of these camps and how and why they were out I can't tell you, but they were\nout there and not with a guard, because the guard would have been a German. We would\nhave shot him. We would have had a fire fight.",
        "Q: Had you been prepared by the army or anything you had read or information for what you\nwould see in the camps?",
        "A: No way. Had no idea. I knew of the horror things that had happened through the cousins\nof mine that came back from there in 1940 and '39, but they didn't describe concentration\ncamps. They didn't know anything about that. What they could describe was how a store\nwindow would be broken, a person would be taken off the street, 1f you were a doctor\nyou couldn't practice, if you were a teacher you couldn't teach, if you wrote a book it\nwouldn't be published...those things I knew, but I didn't know anything about these\ncamps.",
        "Q: The soldiers you were with and since you were an officer, the American soldiers you\nwere with, did did they understand? Did you have...did you feel that you understood in a\ndifferent way because you were a Jew? Was there something you could translate...?",
        "A: No. I think this thing was so horrible that it really didn't matter what you were, what your\nreligious background was, this thing was so horrendous that no matter who you were or\nwhat you were, it was going to plague you. You see, one of the reasons for the Holocaust\nMuseum and one of the reasons for the expression that the Jews in Israel use frequently\nnow is \"Never Again,\" and I have to tell you that anyone of my troops that went into\nDachau with us would not become a parent of a skinhead or a neo-Nazi or any one of\nthose things, because what they say could never be duplicated in history and hopefully\nnever will be, it was so horrible.",
        "Q: Turning to your return to the United States, were you able to translate, tell people when\nyou came back, what you had seen so that they could understand? Did they believe you?",
        "A: We didn't...we didn't dwell on that at all. When I came back, obviously I didn't have a\ncivilian job. I was still in the service, until January of '46, but the B'nai B'rith and the\nAnti-Defamation League had me going out to lunches and dinners to talk and it was a\nvery propitious subject at that time. The war had just ended and we focused on the Julius\nStreicher story and never on the other facets that we're talking about today, so...and we\nalso talked about Normandy, but we just never got into the concentration camp, the\nDachaus of the world or any of that. It 1t didn't come up so I didn't paint that picture as I\nhave just tried to do for you. It was...the picture was horrible.",
        "Q: Something that you will always remember.",
        "A: And everybody else that saw it will too.",
        "Q: How did it shape or change...did it change your life? Did it affect your life and your\nsubsequent career?",
        "01:08: A: Yeah, but let's don't go that far ahead yet if you don't mind. The reason I say that\nis when you use the word change, it changed my life dramatically right then because I\nwanted to capture as many of these bastards as I possibly could. Now, how to go about it.\nWhen May 8th came around, my commanding officer, a full colonel, my commanding\nofficer told me I couldn't use any of our men to go out on patrol and the reason, he said,\nwas the war's over now and I can't write a letter to somebody's mother and father tell\nthem their son was killed on the 10th, the 11th, the 12th of May. I just can't do it. The\nwar's over for us here. If they get killed, it would have to be in a traffic accident, so he\nsaid but I don't object to your continuing to do your scouting and patrolling if you will,\nbut you're going to have to do it with the SS troops that we have under our command, so\nthere I was, driving through the Alps, narrow little roads, in a Volkswagen instead of an\nAmerican jeep, with...I'm in the front right seat and I got a German driver, SS, and in\nthose days, to make it even more precarious and the hipe and what have you, the rumor\namong the SS was they're all going to be executed for being in the SS so they really had\nvery little stake at just turning the wheel a little bit and off the Alps we went, but during\nthese tours, during these trips with the SS, I managed to get the president of Vienna...his\nname was Delbruger (ph). I got...I found Jules Olberg (ph), who was the butcher of Paris,\nroaming around in a 20th Armored stockade in an enlisted man's coat and suit so that he\nwould never be caught up in all this.",
        "Q: How did you find him? How did you...?",
        "A: Well, you you began to get things from Burgermeisters mostly and tips that you were\ngetting from other Germans who were fearful of being...we we we went into a bogey (ph)\nwheel factory and we found people in there that were hiding. It was...you had to take a\nfiniculaire to get up there. We we just spent days and days and days looking for these\npeople. I didn't leave there until after September and this is May 8 we're talking about, so\nthat lasted ...that lasted quite a while.",
        "Q: Did the army object at all?",
        "A: No. They didn't object, and they were delighted when I would bring these people in, but\nhe wouldn't... my own commanding officer wouldn't let me use American troops.",
        "Q: So you left...you left Europe in September. You returned to the United States?",
        "A: No. I didn't come back until later than that. In September I left the Berchtesgarten area\nwhere we were picking these people up and then I went up to Wiesbaden where\nEisenhower's headquarters were and I mentioned earlier that I went to law school and I\nbecame the law member of a general court which 1s like...the court itself 1s like a jury and\nthe law member is the one who advises them on the law, and then I stayed there until the\nend of the year and then I came back to the United States.",
        "Q: When you returned to the United States, did you tell people about what you had seen?\nDid you talk at all about...I know you tended to emphasize Streicher and your\ninvolvement with the capture of Streicher, but did your family ask you about the camps?\nDid you talk about that at all?",
        "A: Oh, I'm sure I did but I can't recall specific instances at the moment.",
        "Q: Now to go back to my earlier question. How did this whole event affect you? How did\nyou feel coming back to the United States after the war?",
        "A: Well, you have to...you have to realize that there's a camaraderie and a fraternalism in the\nservice that doesn't exist anywhere that I know of in civilian life, particularly troops who\nhave been engaged in combat together and who have survived, and there was a\nresentment but a friendly resentment from all of my friends because as we arrived in\nBoston, there was a headline in the paper...17,000 troops returning. Included among them\nis Henry Plitt, the man who captured Julius Streicher. And so out of 17,000, they named\none name and the guys started to get pretty irked with that and when I got off the boat in\nBoston, I was interviewed by the press and they asked what my post-war plans were, and\nI said I would like to take a contingent down to South America and find Hitler because\nI'm sure he's alive down there, and I figured this was going to turn into another job. At\nthat point I didn't know what the future held for me, but of course 1t was pooh-poohed\nand it never happened, but it was another headline in Boston, so we treated it very lightly.\nWe treated it very lightly. It was kind of a fun thing except I left out a whole segment\nhere. I came back to the United States on what was known as the hero's tour. Those were\npeople who were highly decorated and what have you, and their mission was to sell war\nbonds. Now in those days we didn't finance a war from taxes or from other countries. We\nfinanced the war from our own people 1:10: putting up the money to fight the war, and\nso I spent time here and my assignment was the Paramount Theater circuit and I met the\npresident of the company and the vice president and all those people. They were very\nlovely people, and one of them said to me if you come back in one piece, call us. Now\nmy speeches for the ADL and the B'nai B'rith and what have you, had gotten kind of tired\nand I called Paramount and they said you're going to be the first executive trainee that we\nput to work post-war, and if you read Leonard Goldenson...he was the former chairman\nof the board of ABC...if you read his book called \"Beating the Odds,\" he tells the story of\nhow I came to Paramount. Now that was in 1946. In 1973 I bought half of that theater\nchain and in 1978 I bought the rest of it. And that's what Streicher had to do for me.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION - TAPE DISTORTED\nEND OF SIDE A",
        "Q: You made a big leap from entering working for Paramount to buying out their chain. Can\nyou fill us in briefly a little on some of the highlights of that that interim period? Here\nyou were a young war hero...",
        "A: Well, what what actually happened (cough) is that I was supposed to be a trainee and I\nwas supposed to learn all there was to know about theater operation, construction,\nprojection, sound, etc. with the idea in mind that I would go back to Europe and I would\nbegin to put together deals for Paramount to become as important in Europe as they were\nhere in the United States. What actually happened is during the period of my training, I\ningratiated myself...not intentionally...I didn't suck up to this guy, but I ingratiated myself\nwith a man by the name of E. B. Richards in New Orleans who was the big bad wolf of\nour industry. He was hated. He was feared. He was everything. And I didn't know how\nimportant he was and the first night that I met him, I was living in...they call it...not the\nbarracks but a dormitory where he ran this school for managers...and I was living in the\ndormitory and I got back in and I was looking around. I saw a light somewhere and I\nwent toward the light and it was a kitchen and in the kitchen was a refrigerator and I\nopened the door and I took a couple of pieces of fruit out to eat and I heard a voice inside\nsaying, who is that. And he sent a man who was with him out and the man asked me to\ncome in and I walked in and he said, oh you're the pencil-pusher from New York that\nthey sent down here, aren't you. And I said if you consider six years of active service in\nthe army and parachute troops qualifying me as a pencil-pusher, I'll have it your way,\nyeah. Now I never realized nobody ever crossed this man. I mean he was powerful. There\nare some great stories about him and I'm going to digress for a minute and give you two\nof them. Number one, when a theater manager would put signs up and where...you call\nthem 8 x 10 photographs...and they were too low, he would go into that theater and he\nwould get down on his stomach in the lobby and look at the sign and get back up and say\nto the manager, gee that's great. I hope all the rest of your audience 1s willing to do this.\nThat was one of his stories. The other one which is even more important is that\nParamount at one time wanted to put cash registers into the concession booths, areas, and\nE. B. Richards resented this. He wasn't going to have any part of it. So Leonard\nGoldensen who was then heading the theater division, but he really wasn't over E. B.\nbecause E. B. was a partner and Leonard was an employee but even though he was a head\nof a division, E. B. took a train and he went from New Orleans to New York and he got\nthere and he walked into the New York Paramount and he bought a Hershey bar, which\nin those days was five cents, and he gave the girl a $20 bill, and when she turned around\nto ring up his sale, he swooped everything off the counter into his hat, took his change\nand he went upstairs. Now the Paramount Theater was in the Paramount Building where\nour offices were. He went upstairs to Leonard's office and after they exchanged\npleasantries, he said to Leonard, say Lennie, you running a sale downstairs. And\nGoldensen said no, why Rich, what are you talking about. He says look what I bought for\na nickel and he threw the whole damn thing on his...so this is the kind of man 01:12: this\nwas. If you remember the hucksters with Clark Gable and the big fat guy who said straw\nin the wind, opened the window and threw his hat out...that was E. B. Richards type. Any\nway, he became my mentor for a while and Goldensen...in 1950 the Federal Government\nsplit the studios and the theaters and Goldensen at that time on behalf of Paramount was\nout all over the country buying up these chains, and he bought Richard's chain but it was\nto take...this was in May...but it was to take effect the 3rd of January and after he got\nback home, he began scratching his head and saying gees, what will I have by the 3rd of\nJanuary. He could move everything out. He'll have a circuit of his own, so he called\nRichards and he said I would like to send a representative down there between now and\nthe 3rd. Rich said OK. You've got one man in the company I'll take. He's a northerner but\nwe don't have any disregard for him. It was Henry Plitt. So off I go to New Orleans. I had\na very hectic period of time between the time I got there in July and the following\nJanuary 3rd because I was walking on two sides of a track. I had to...my responsibility\nwas to Paramount but at the same time I was ostensibly an employee of Paramount\nRichards, so it was a pretty tough thing and when I got to Pensacola, Leonard came down\non a trip and I said you know, Leonard, I don't have an office. If I wore a hat, I wouldn't\nhave a place to hang it. What is my future here. He said you're the heir apparent, and that\nwas enough for me. Three years later I took over.",
        "Q: Now a major portion of your life in addition, of course, to your professional career and\nyour impact in the entertainment industry, has been charitable work.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What got you...how did you get involved in...particularly in your...has it any relationship\nto your experiences during the war? Does it...?",
        "A: Initially no. Subsequently yes. My my real initial involvement in charity work was in\n1949 I was then kind of general manager of the Richards, ex-Richards circuit, now\nParamount, and Leonard Goldensen again who had a cerebral palsy daughter asked that\nwe in our theaters cooperate in fund raising and I got a trailer to run on my screen, but I\ncouldn't find anybody to make the collections so...because it was Mother's Day that\nSunday...so instead of continuing to seek people who said no, I can't go because it's\nMother's Day, I called a meeting with an ad for the cerebral palsy parents in Orleans\nParish, and they came to the meeting and because they couldn't leave their kids alone at\nhome, the kids were with them, and I saw these kids and I have to tell you that it wasn't\nDachau by any matter or means, but it was a heavy sympathy factor to see these kids that\njust didn't have appropriate treatment, didn't have appropriate diagnostic work, if the\ndiagnosis was right they didn't have the disciplines to do it because it could have been\ndental, it could have been orthopedic, it could have been any number of things, and they\njust didn't have the doctors for it and not only that, they couldn't diagnosis it, so I kind of\nfell in love with that, and in short order I took over the organization and then I became\nthe president of the Cerebral Palsy Association of New Orleans, subsequently Cerebral\nPalsy Association of Louisiana, then Regional Vice President of the national organization\ncovering the South, and during all this, I would travel to different cities and I would meet\nwith interested people and parents and I would get them going. Later on, I go to New\nYork and there I really don't do very much of anything, but subsequently to that I go to\nChicago and there I get back into cerebral palsy and I become the chairman of that\norganization for three years, which takes us now 01:14: to 1967 at which time I go to\nIsrael and the Six Day War.",
        "Q: Did you go to Israel before the Six Day War?",
        "A: No. For the last day...the last day. But the tanks were on the ground and the shoes were\nwhere the Arabs ran off and left them running so fast, and it was...it was quite a picture. It\nwas a thoroughly, thoroughly...I don't know...I just fell in love with Israel, absolutely fell\nin love with it. I met with Motte Gur? __ who was the general in charge of the air force at\nthe time...you know Motte? I noticed you nodded. My wife said to Motte, congratulations\non your work for the Six Day War. And he said to her, we were home for lunch the first\nday, and, you know, they're, they're not very reluctant to demonstrate their bravado but\nwith it all, then the next year I went back to lecture to parachute troops, and I thought,\nyou know, these guys are going to look up at the platform and see this old goat talking to\nthem and they're young and they're full of vim and vigor and they don't...they're not\ninterested in what this guy...unbelievable. They had never jumped in combat. They were\njumpers, but they had never been employed as parachute troops, and when I came in\ntelling them stories about our combat jumps and the formation of our air planes and how\nwe had to do different things, they wasn't...there wasn't anybody in the audience that\nwasn't electrified. Now that's another reason, and the next thing you know I go to Hetzoa?\nAir Force Base and I meet the commanding officer and I ask him what he needs, and he\nneeds a game room, a play room. Well, what to do. I came back to the United States and\nraised the money, and that began it all. Then I became very involved in Bar Ilan\nUniversity. Actually I became the president of the West Coast Friends of Bar Ilan and the\nnext step in my Israeli occupation was Sha'arei Tsedek Hospital in Jerusalem, and there\nwe have the Sedge(??) and Henry Plitt Heart Surgery, and the reason for that is that Dr.\nMatloff (ph) who did heart surgery on me was interested in moving his heart surgeon\nprogram to Israel. Prior to his doing that, there was an eighteen month wait between\ndiagnosis and treatment...and and and care in surgery. Now you have to realize that\nbefore they do heart surgery, they do an angiogram. There was a three month wait to get\nan angiogram done, and then after the three month wait, you're on a list. Hopefully you'll\nbe taken between twelve and eighteen months from then. If you're still alive, they'll treat\nyou in eighteen months. If you're not, of course, it's academic. So we wanted to move the\nsame system that they have here at Cedar Sinai which does a great deal of heart work,\nover to Israel and we started it based upon his jumping on my bones, we started a thing\ncalled Heart to Heart from Los Angeles to Jerusalem, and today that is functioning at the\nSha'arei Tsedek Hospital, and we're all thrilled with it.",
        "Q: Before we close, I'd like to go back just for a moment to your capture of Streicher and are\nthere any details...between the time you identified who Streicher was and you got him in\nthe jeep, or even in the jeep...did he say anything? Did he put up any resistance of any\nform?",
        "A: No. He didn't put up any resistance, but there 1s a story attached to it. First of all, I was so\nexcited at what I had that I have to tell you, I I didn't follow any rules. His wife gave him\na raincoat. I didn't examine the raincoat. I didn't know that there was no weapon in it. His\nwife took his slippers off, which he had been using out on the porch, and substituted\nshoes for them and that's no big deal, but the fact that I let him get that coat and not even\nfeel it to see if there's anything in it was a real blunder, but after I dropped him at\nBerchtesgarten with the recognition of all the mistakes I'd made because we usually\nsearch a place where you have taken somebody, from which you have taken somebody,\nso I went back to Weidring that night and his wife gave me a letter which is here 01:16:\nin the Holocaust Museum...the original is in the Museum...which indicates that this is the\nfirst night they've been separated since their marriage. They had been married about forty\ndays. She was his nurse I think, and he had left...forgotten to take his glasses with him,\nand in the letter she enclosed his glasses which she asked me to give to him and she\nstarted being extremely tearful, almost to the point of wailing, and I said you just don't\nunderstand the American way of life. If your husband is the good man that you describe\nhim as being, he'll back home to you, but if he is what we think he is, you'll never see him\nagain. That's all I have to say about that. That's all that happened.",

One man, one woman, one person can make a big\ndifference in in anything, and the words that are used so frequently in Israel today that\nshould be a watch word for all of us, Jew and gentile alike, are the words \"Never Again.\u201d",

        "A: Henry G., G for George, Plitt. I was born in New York City in 1918 and that, of course,\nwas late in the year that year, just two weeks after the Armistice for World War I.",
        "A: I started in New York City, and I went to grammar school there, and one year at DeWitt\nClinton High School, after which my family sent me to a military academy in Stanton,\nStaunton, Virginia. It's spelled Staunton. It's pronounced Stanton and there I began my\nmilitary career.",
        "A: Well, I graduated from Staunton in 1935 at which time I went to Syracuse University and\nthere I went in the ROTC, so again we've got another three or four years, three years of\nmilitary and I was eligible to become an officer by then with six years of military under\nmy belt, but I wasn't old enough. In those days you had to be twenty-one to be...",
        "A: A lieutenant. So that began my relationship with the army. Now I was in law school in St.\nLawrence University, Brooklyn, and at this time...it was getting close to 1940...it was in\n'38 and '39, and my family managed through an organization called HIAS to bring into\nthis country some of my relatives who were in the German occupied areas and when\n[...when I heard their story, I just made up my mind that all this was...one man was\nresponsible for all this and his name was Hitler and somehow or other I wanted to kill\nhim. Now that sounds terrible in the light of today's world, but at that time when you\nheard those horror stories, you couldn't do anything but want to destroy this person who\nwas responsible for it, so I switched my allegiance in the army to parachute troops\nbecause at that time parachute troops were trained to blow up bridges, blow up planes,\ndrop behind the lines, assassinate, execute and all this kind of thing. But during our\nperiod of training, it was very strange but many, many people came into parachute troops\nand before the training was over, we suddenly had ourselves a a regiment of men and\nnow the tactics were not going to be the same. The regiment, incidentally, grew into\ndivisions, and by the time we jumped in Normandy there were three divisions that went\nin. There was the 10Ist, the 82nd and the British 36th Airborne, so you can see that the\nidea of jumping behind the lines and killing Hitler was a long way from potential fruition.\nIt just couldn't happen that way, so that's that's an answer to your question and when did I\nget in the army or how or why.",
        "A: Well, all...all I can tell you is that the only reason...it was a quirk of fate...the only reason\nthat I ended up with the first group to jump in Normandy 1s the man that we had selected\nas our pathfinder, the day before during the period Eisenhower delayed for twenty-four\nhours, we had a chance to go up and see what he had done, and we were very dissatisfied\nwith it and my colonel said to me on the way back, Plitt, I want you to go in. Take the\npathfinder detachment in and I'll meet you on the ground and put a DSC on your neck. So\nI...",
        "A: Yes. So I didn't have any choice anyway, but the point is that that put me among...we had\nthree airplane loads going in, the pathfinders, a total of eighteen people per plane for a\ntotal of fifty-four people. And now the actual flight itself over England was nothing but\nwhen we got to the English Channel, we went down on the deck and there were some\nvery exciting moments when the ships at sea were flashing the V for victory sign to us\nright over...right over head and then when we got to Cherbourg we pulled up to five\nhundred feet. Imagine...up to five hundred feet and we went along the line, the road that\nwe had all been briefed so carefully on and studied so long, running from Montberg to\nValone...from Cherbourg to Montberg to Valone on down to St. Mere-Eglise and\nCarentan and so on. And when we got over our drop zone, boom...there it 1s. Now if you\nwant to know what went through my mind, I was just as scared as any human being\n01:02: could be. Here I was jumping into Festung (fortress) Europe, which was a Nazi\ndominated France, German soldiers, and I had an H on my dog tag. Now the H on my\ndog tag stood for Hebrew. At that time the army put your religion on your dog tags and\nthey did it only so that if you need last rites or what have you, they know what you are\nand what you aren't, and they only had three categories. There was P for Protestant, C for\nCatholic and H for Hebrew or Jewish, and so there I was, all alone, in France, German-\noccupied, so the first thing I did (coughing)...excuse me...in an attempt to get mobile or as\nmobile as I could, was to scrap the throwaway things that were weighing me down, such\nas a gas mask and such as binoculars and such as extra rounds of ammunition, and\nsuddenly I got so I could move around with a great degree of ease, and during this period\nI was able to pick up a hundred and one men. Strangely enough, we were the 101st\nAirborne. I picked up a hundred and one men and we attacked the gun position, which\nwas the division mission. Now the reason we did that is that we were supposed to be on\nthe ground for thirty minutes, and after that hearing our own planes come in, we would\nput the lights on. That's what we jumped for...the pathfinders...put the lights on and guide\nthe rest of the units in. For a long time, it got to be very thin and tight and for a long time\nI thought maybe Eisenhower has canceled again, in which case we got to stay here for\ntwenty-four more hours and sweat it out, or...and before the or really had a chance to take\nhold, we could hear the drone of airplanes coming over. For our whole, the first part of\nthe mission, the pathfinder mission was worthless, because these were new pilots who\nhad never flown in combat before and when the anti-aircraft started coming up at them,\nthey broke from formation. They dropped troops in the Channel. They dropped them all\nthe way north to Cherbourg and all the way south to Carentan, and so that part of the\nmission just wasn't.",
        "A: Well, yeah. I was in the first fifty-four.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah, it's a very interesting story. We had an arrangement with the Burgermeisters of the\nvarious cities, that if they had any known what would later become termed as war\ncriminals, in their area, they were to notify us. If they intended to hold their job as\nBurgermeister, they better do it. And so we got a call one night. I don't know who was on\nthe board...got a call from a Burgermeister telling us about this man that was living in a\ncertain building. We went to the building and we entered the place that he was supposed\nto occupy and he did. He was in bed and the minute we came in the door, he reached for a\npill on his night table, and one of my boys knocked it out of his hand, and then he said he\ndidn't know why we were bothering him. He was a professor, a teacher. His name was\nDisselbruger (ph) and he...what can I tell you...he claimed to have...he never was a Nazi,\nknew nothing about Nazism and so on. Now I have to take you back for a moment. When\nVE Day came around, which was May the 8th, my particular unit of the 101st Airborne\nwas in an area occupied by 13,000 SS troops. Now there we were, two thousand, now in\ncharge of.,,these people had surrendered, so we took blocks where they put their\nweapons, and blocks where they did this, but in order to control these 13,000 people, we\nhad to get MP's...that's military police...from their own units. We...we...we just didn't\nhave the manpower to do this, so we did that, and in my headquarters was a full colonel\nNazi. At that time I was only a cap...I was a major. In our headquarters there was a full\ncolonel Nazi, and when I walked in with Disselbruger, he clicked his heels, popped to\nattention and said Heil. Now how in the hell can a school teacher have a full colonel do\nthis, so I called division headquarters and I said I'm sending this guy up to you. And I did,\nand he turned out to be Robert Ley, the Minister of Labor, the guy who sent people to the\ncamps and what have you. That's the Robert Ley story.",
        "A: Well, yeah, you could call a full colonel his 01:04: subordinate, but once you knew that\nhe was senior to a full colonel, you knew you had something. But I didn't know who he\nwas.",
        "A: Well, that that was a more solitary role because I got him by myself.",
        "A: We also got a tip that there was a a high ranking Nazi living in the town of Widering (ph)\nin Austria and his name we didn't know. I thought it was Heinrich Himmler from the\ndescription, but I didn't have a jeep of my own and I didn't have an interpreter of my own\nat the time, so I borrowed another guy's jeep and his driver and the three of us went up\nthe hill to this house, chalet, chateau, whatever you want to call it, and I entered, my 45 in\nhand, and I went upstairs. There was a man sitting on a chair with an easel to his right\npainting the opposite Alp, and I asked him his name and he told me Joseph Seeler (ph),\nand I said where's your identification papers, and he reached right in back and he pulled\nout an identification paper made out to the name of Joseph Seeler. Now it didn't hit me\nquite that fast that this was Julius Streicher, and I began asking him things about\nHimmler, because I thought I had the wrong guy, and he said he knew nothing about\npolitics. He was a painter. He knew nothing about anything that had to do with what I\nwas interested in and then I don't know why I said, and what about Julius Streicher, and\nhe said: \"Ja, der bin Ich.\u201d Now I got that only from the J S on his work papers.",
        "A: Joseph Seeler was Julius Streicher. \"Ja, der bin Ich\", which when translated into English\nreads yes, that's who I am. Now we had no further interrogation. In the car, in the jeep on\nthe way, he and I were in the back. I had my gun riding his ribs so nothing was going to\nhappen there. He wasn't going to jump out or commit suicide or anything, and I said to\nhim...this is the only interrogation he got from me...I said to him: \"Sind Sie der Streicher\nder war gegendie Juden?\", which when translated means, are you the Streicher who was\nagainst the Jews. And he very calmly said: \"Ja, der bin Ich\", which meant yes, that's who\nI am, but he might just as well have said so what. I mean he was arrogant to the very end,\nso much so that when we got to Berchtesgarten...oh, I'm sorry... stopped at my\nregimental headquarters to notify them I was bringing him in and Bertchesgarten was\nabout forty miles away from us. When I got to Bertchesgarten, as he was getting out of\nthe jeep, I booted him a little bit so that accelerate his departure, and the place was loaded\nwith reporters and this, that and the other, and one reporter came up to me and he said,\nyou know, you just killed the greatest story of the war. I said how. He said can you\nimagine if a guy named Kohn or Goldberg or Levy had captured this arch-anti-Semite,\nwhat a great story it would be. I said why. He said because a Jew would be doing this,\nand I told him I'm Jewish, and that's when the microphones came into my face and the\ncameras started clicking away and things started to happen that changed the rest of my life.",
        "A: No. They took him. I took him to division headquarters. They took him on up to Munich\nwhere the army interrogation team was. When I say army that's a division of like a\nregiment or battalion army, and that's where those people were.",
        "A: Well, with Ley I just felt it was a part of my job and because there was no direct\nrelationship between Ley and Streicher and between Ley and and what was going on in\nEurope and Germany at the time, but with Streicher there was a very direct relationship.\nWith Ley I didn't even go to division with him. I sent him up with a couple of my men\nbecause I didn't...we didn't know then that it was Ley either, you know, but I sent him up\nwith a couple of my men and with Streicher there was a very personal feeling about the\nwhole thing. I can tell you myself not killing him from time to time when I had the\nopportunity, but I had two other people in the jeep and war or not war you just don't kill\npeople who surrendered, so that's the story of Julius Streicher.",
        "A: Oh yes. That was...",
        "A: Well, that's...that's a moment that will will live forever. The most outstanding moment of\nthis whole thing, and I'll never forget the word was as we got in there and it was a\nhorrible sight...everything was, huts they lived in, the furnaces that they were burned in,\nand which incidentally were 01:06: crematoriums and as we got there, moving up into\nthis area, one of the men I was with said look at those crematoriums, and another officer\nstanding next to him said no, it's crematoria. That's the plural for crematoriums. I'll never\nforget that because that whole moment was just unbelievable. These people were sitting\non stoops and porches and on the ground. Their bodies were totally emaciated. Their legs\nwere swollen. It was...1t was an unbelievable time and the very same date that we went\nthrough stands there today because I've been back and it's just...it's a moment that is very\ndifficult to describe.",
        "A: No, I don't. I remember May 8th, you know. I've got those dates, but I can't give you the\nexact day, but I can tell you that about two weeks before...maybe ten days before the 8th\nof May, I saw people walking on the road wearing what we later found out was the\nuniform of the inmates of the the concentration camp, but I had never seen that before...a\npajama looking thing with a blue and a grey. And I said what the hell is this. They got\nanother army here we don't know about. They were walking along the road, and this is in\nthe Alps, but as you got into areas like Munich and what have you, you were getting into\nthe areas of these camps and how and why they were out I can't tell you, but they were\nout there and not with a guard, because the guard would have been a German. We would\nhave shot him. We would have had a fire fight.",
        "A: No way. Had no idea. I knew of the horror things that had happened through the cousins\nof mine that came back from there in 1940 and '39, but they didn't describe concentration\ncamps. They didn't know anything about that. What they could describe was how a store\nwindow would be broken, a person would be taken off the street, 1f you were a doctor\nyou couldn't practice, if you were a teacher you couldn't teach, if you wrote a book it\nwouldn't be published...those things I knew, but I didn't know anything about these\ncamps.",
        "A: No. I think this thing was so horrible that it really didn't matter what you were, what your\nreligious background was, this thing was so horrendous that no matter who you were or\nwhat you were, it was going to plague you. You see, one of the reasons for the Holocaust\nMuseum and one of the reasons for the expression that the Jews in Israel use frequently\nnow is \"Never Again,\" and I have to tell you that anyone of my troops that went into\nDachau with us would not become a parent of a skinhead or a neo-Nazi or any one of\nthose things, because what they say could never be duplicated in history and hopefully\nnever will be, it was so horrible.",
        "A: We didn't...we didn't dwell on that at all. When I came back, obviously I didn't have a\ncivilian job. I was still in the service, until January of '46, but the B'nai B'rith and the\nAnti-Defamation League had me going out to lunches and dinners to talk and it was a\nvery propitious subject at that time. The war had just ended and we focused on the Julius\nStreicher story and never on the other facets that we're talking about today, so...and we\nalso talked about Normandy, but we just never got into the concentration camp, the\nDachaus of the world or any of that. It 1t didn't come up so I didn't paint that picture as I\nhave just tried to do for you. It was...the picture was horrible.",
        "A: And everybody else that saw it will too.",
        "01:08: A: Yeah, but let's don't go that far ahead yet if you don't mind. The reason I say that\nis when you use the word change, it changed my life dramatically right then because I\nwanted to capture as many of these bastards as I possibly could. Now, how to go about it.\nWhen May 8th came around, my commanding officer, a full colonel, my commanding\nofficer told me I couldn't use any of our men to go out on patrol and the reason, he said,\nwas the war's over now and I can't write a letter to somebody's mother and father tell\nthem their son was killed on the 10th, the 11th, the 12th of May. I just can't do it. The\nwar's over for us here. If they get killed, it would have to be in a traffic accident, so he\nsaid but I don't object to your continuing to do your scouting and patrolling if you will,\nbut you're going to have to do it with the SS troops that we have under our command, so\nthere I was, driving through the Alps, narrow little roads, in a Volkswagen instead of an\nAmerican jeep, with...I'm in the front right seat and I got a German driver, SS, and in\nthose days, to make it even more precarious and the hipe and what have you, the rumor\namong the SS was they're all going to be executed for being in the SS so they really had\nvery little stake at just turning the wheel a little bit and off the Alps we went, but during\nthese tours, during these trips with the SS, I managed to get the president of Vienna...his\nname was Delbruger (ph). I got...I found Jules Olberg (ph), who was the butcher of Paris,\nroaming around in a 20th Armored stockade in an enlisted man's coat and suit so that he\nwould never be caught up in all this.",
        "A: Well, you you began to get things from Burgermeisters mostly and tips that you were\ngetting from other Germans who were fearful of being...we we we went into a bogey (ph)\nwheel factory and we found people in there that were hiding. It was...you had to take a\nfiniculaire to get up there. We we just spent days and days and days looking for these\npeople. I didn't leave there until after September and this is May 8 we're talking about, so\nthat lasted ...that lasted quite a while.",
        "A: No. They didn't object, and they were delighted when I would bring these people in, but\nhe wouldn't... my own commanding officer wouldn't let me use American troops.",
        "A: No. I didn't come back until later than that. In September I left the Berchtesgarten area\nwhere we were picking these people up and then I went up to Wiesbaden where\nEisenhower's headquarters were and I mentioned earlier that I went to law school and I\nbecame the law member of a general court which 1s like...the court itself 1s like a jury and\nthe law member is the one who advises them on the law, and then I stayed there until the\nend of the year and then I came back to the United States.\ninvolvement with the capture of Streicher, but did your family ask you about the camps?\nDid you talk about that at all?",
        "A: Oh, I'm sure I did but I can't recall specific instances at the moment.",
        "A: Well, you have to...you have to realize that there's a camaraderie and a fraternalism in the\nservice that doesn't exist anywhere that I know of in civilian life, particularly troops who\nhave been engaged in combat together and who have survived, and there was a\nresentment but a friendly resentment from all of my friends because as we arrived in\nBoston, there was a headline in the paper...17,000 troops returning. Included among them\nis Henry Plitt, the man who captured Julius Streicher. And so out of 17,000, they named\none name and the guys started to get pretty irked with that and when I got off the boat in\nBoston, I was interviewed by the press and they asked what my post-war plans were, and\nI said I would like to take a contingent down to South America and find Hitler because\nI'm sure he's alive down there, and I figured this was going to turn into another job. At\nthat point I didn't know what the future held for me, but of course 1t was pooh-poohed\nand it never happened, but it was another headline in Boston, so we treated it very lightly.\nWe treated it very lightly. It was kind of a fun thing except I left out a whole segment\nhere. I came back to the United States on what was known as the hero's tour. Those were\npeople who were highly decorated and what have you, and their mission was to sell war\nbonds. Now in those days we didn't finance a war from taxes or from other countries. We\nfinanced the war from our own people 1:10: putting up the money to fight the war, and\nso I spent time here and my assignment was the Paramount Theater circuit and I met the\npresident of the company and the vice president and all those people. They were very\nlovely people, and one of them said to me if you come back in one piece, call us. Now\nmy speeches for the ADL and the B'nai B'rith and what have you, had gotten kind of tired\nand I called Paramount and they said you're going to be the first executive trainee that we\nput to work post-war, and if you read Leonard Goldenson...he was the former chairman\nof the board of ABC...if you read his book called \"Beating the Odds,\" he tells the story of\nhow I came to Paramount. Now that was in 1946. In 1973 I bought half of that theater\nchain and in 1978 I bought the rest of it. And that's what Streicher had to do for me.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION - TAPE DISTORTED\nEND OF SIDE A",
        "A: Well, what what actually happened (cough) is that I was supposed to be a trainee and I\nwas supposed to learn all there was to know about theater operation, construction,\nprojection, sound, etc. with the idea in mind that I would go back to Europe and I would\nbegin to put together deals for Paramount to become as important in Europe as they were\nhere in the United States. What actually happened is during the period of my training, I\ningratiated myself...not intentionally...I didn't suck up to this guy, but I ingratiated myself\nwith a man by the name of E. B. Richards in New Orleans who was the big bad wolf of\nour industry. He was hated. He was feared. He was everything. And I didn't know how\nimportant he was and the first night that I met him, I was living in...they call it...not the\nbarracks but a dormitory where he ran this school for managers...and I was living in the\ndormitory and I got back in and I was looking around. I saw a light somewhere and I\nwent toward the light and it was a kitchen and in the kitchen was a refrigerator and I\nopened the door and I took a couple of pieces of fruit out to eat and I heard a voice inside\nsaying, who is that. And he sent a man who was with him out and the man asked me to\ncome in and I walked in and he said, oh you're the pencil-pusher from New York that\nthey sent down here, aren't you. And I said if you consider six years of active service in\nthe army and parachute troops qualifying me as a pencil-pusher, I'll have it your way,\nyeah. Now I never realized nobody ever crossed this man. I mean he was powerful. There\nare some great stories about him and I'm going to digress for a minute and give you two\nof them. Number one, when a theater manager would put signs up and where...you call\nthem 8 x 10 photographs...and they were too low, he would go into that theater and he\nwould get down on his stomach in the lobby and look at the sign and get back up and say\nto the manager, gee that's great. I hope all the rest of your audience 1s willing to do this.\nThat was one of his stories. The other one which is even more important is that\nParamount at one time wanted to put cash registers into the concession booths, areas, and\nE. B. Richards resented this. He wasn't going to have any part of it. So Leonard\nGoldensen who was then heading the theater division, but he really wasn't over E. B.\nbecause E. B. was a partner and Leonard was an employee but even though he was a head\nof a division, E. B. took a train and he went from New Orleans to New York and he got\nthere and he walked into the New York Paramount and he bought a Hershey bar, which\nin those days was five cents, and he gave the girl a $20 bill, and when she turned around\nto ring up his sale, he swooped everything off the counter into his hat, took his change\nand he went upstairs. Now the Paramount Theater was in the Paramount Building where\nour offices were. He went upstairs to Leonard's office and after they exchanged\npleasantries, he said to Leonard, say Lennie, you running a sale downstairs. And\nGoldensen said no, why Rich, what are you talking about. He says look what I bought for\na nickel and he threw the whole damn thing on his...so this is the kind of man 01:12: this\nwas. If you remember the hucksters with Clark Gable and the big fat guy who said straw\nin the wind, opened the window and threw his hat out...that was E. B. Richards type. Any\nway, he became my mentor for a while and Goldensen...in 1950 the Federal Government\nsplit the studios and the theaters and Goldensen at that time on behalf of Paramount was\nout all over the country buying up these chains, and he bought Richard's chain but it was\nto take...this was in May...but it was to take effect the 3rd of January and after he got\nback home, he began scratching his head and saying gees, what will I have by the 3rd of\nJanuary. He could move everything out. He'll have a circuit of his own, so he called\nRichards and he said I would like to send a representative down there between now and\nthe 3rd. Rich said OK. You've got one man in the company I'll take. He's a northerner but\nwe don't have any disregard for him. It was Henry Plitt. So off I go to New Orleans. I had\na very hectic period of time between the time I got there in July and the following\nJanuary 3rd because I was walking on two sides of a track. I had to...my responsibility\nwas to Paramount but at the same time I was ostensibly an employee of Paramount\nRichards, so it was a pretty tough thing and when I got to Pensacola, Leonard came down\non a trip and I said you know, Leonard, I don't have an office. If I wore a hat, I wouldn't\nhave a place to hang it. What is my future here. He said you're the heir apparent, and that\nwas enough for me. Three years later I took over.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Initially no. Subsequently yes. My my real initial involvement in charity work was in\n1949 I was then kind of general manager of the Richards, ex-Richards circuit, now\nParamount, and Leonard Goldensen again who had a cerebral palsy daughter asked that\nwe in our theaters cooperate in fund raising and I got a trailer to run on my screen, but I\ncouldn't find anybody to make the collections so...because it was Mother's Day that\nSunday...so instead of continuing to seek people who said no, I can't go because it's\nMother's Day, I called a meeting with an ad for the cerebral palsy parents in Orleans\nParish, and they came to the meeting and because they couldn't leave their kids alone at\nhome, the kids were with them, and I saw these kids and I have to tell you that it wasn't\nDachau by any matter or means, but it was a heavy sympathy factor to see these kids that\njust didn't have appropriate treatment, didn't have appropriate diagnostic work, if the\ndiagnosis was right they didn't have the disciplines to do it because it could have been\ndental, it could have been orthopedic, it could have been any number of things, and they\njust didn't have the doctors for it and not only that, they couldn't diagnosis it, so I kind of\nfell in love with that, and in short order I took over the organization and then I became\nthe president of the Cerebral Palsy Association of New Orleans, subsequently Cerebral\nPalsy Association of Louisiana, then Regional Vice President of the national organization\ncovering the South, and during all this, I would travel to different cities and I would meet\nwith interested people and parents and I would get them going. Later on, I go to New\nYork and there I really don't do very much of anything, but subsequently to that I go to\nChicago and there I get back into cerebral palsy and I become the chairman of that\norganization for three years, which takes us now 01:14: to 1967 at which time I go to\nIsrael and the Six Day War.",
        "A: No. For the last day...the last day. But the tanks were on the ground and the shoes were\nwhere the Arabs ran off and left them running so fast, and it was...it was quite a picture. It\nwas a thoroughly, thoroughly...I don't know...I just fell in love with Israel, absolutely fell\nin love with it. I met with Motte Gur? __ who was the general in charge of the air force at\nthe time...you know Motte? I noticed you nodded. My wife said to Motte, congratulations\non your work for the Six Day War. And he said to her, we were home for lunch the first\nday, and, you know, they're, they're not very reluctant to demonstrate their bravado but\nwith it all, then the next year I went back to lecture to parachute troops, and I thought,\nyou know, these guys are going to look up at the platform and see this old goat talking to\nthem and they're young and they're full of vim and vigor and they don't...they're not\ninterested in what this guy...unbelievable. They had never jumped in combat. They were\njumpers, but they had never been employed as parachute troops, and when I came in\ntelling them stories about our combat jumps and the formation of our air planes and how\nwe had to do different things, they wasn't...there wasn't anybody in the audience that\nwasn't electrified. Now that's another reason, and the next thing you know I go to Hetzoa?\nAir Force Base and I meet the commanding officer and I ask him what he needs, and he\nneeds a game room, a play room. Well, what to do. I came back to the United States and\nraised the money, and that began it all. Then I became very involved in Bar Ilan\nUniversity. Actually I became the president of the West Coast Friends of Bar Ilan and the\nnext step in my Israeli occupation was Sha'arei Tsedek Hospital in Jerusalem, and there\nwe have the Sedge(??) and Henry Plitt Heart Surgery, and the reason for that is that Dr.\nMatloff (ph) who did heart surgery on me was interested in moving his heart surgeon\nprogram to Israel. Prior to his doing that, there was an eighteen month wait between\ndiagnosis and treatment...and and and care in surgery. Now you have to realize that\nbefore they do heart surgery, they do an angiogram. There was a three month wait to get\nan angiogram done, and then after the three month wait, you're on a list. Hopefully you'll\nbe taken between twelve and eighteen months from then. If you're still alive, they'll treat\nyou in eighteen months. If you're not, of course, it's academic. So we wanted to move the\nsame system that they have here at Cedar Sinai which does a great deal of heart work,\nover to Israel and we started it based upon his jumping on my bones, we started a thing\ncalled Heart to Heart from Los Angeles to Jerusalem, and today that is functioning at the\nSha'arei Tsedek Hospital, and we're all thrilled with it.",
        "A: No. He didn't put up any resistance, but there 1s a story attached to it. First of all, I was so\nexcited at what I had that I have to tell you, I I didn't follow any rules. His wife gave him\na raincoat. I didn't examine the raincoat. I didn't know that there was no weapon in it. His\nwife took his slippers off, which he had been using out on the porch, and substituted\nshoes for them and that's no big deal, but the fact that I let him get that coat and not even\nfeel it to see if there's anything in it was a real blunder, but after I dropped him at\nBerchtesgarten with the recognition of all the mistakes I'd made because we usually\nsearch a place where you have taken somebody, from which you have taken somebody,\nso I went back to Weidring that night and his wife gave me a letter which is here 01:16:\nin the Holocaust Museum...the original is in the Museum...which indicates that this is the\nfirst night they've been separated since their marriage. They had been married about forty\ndays. She was his nurse I think, and he had left...forgotten to take his glasses with him,\nand in the letter she enclosed his glasses which she asked me to give to him and she\nstarted being extremely tearful, almost to the point of wailing, and I said you just don't\nunderstand the American way of life. If your husband is the good man that you describe\nhim as being, he'll back home to you, but if he is what we think he is, you'll never see him\nagain. That's all I have to say about that. That's all that happened.",
        "A: I think there are two things I would like to say, one of which I may have said earlier but I\nthink it's important to repeat it. One man, one woman, one person can make a big\ndifference in in anything, and the words that are used so frequently in Israel today that\nshould be a watch word for all of us, Jew and gentile alike, are the words \"Never Again.\u201d",
