        "Question: This is tape one, side A, of an interview with Gerry von Halle, conducted by\nGinger Miles, on July 10\", 1999, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\nThis is a follow up interview of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum video\ninterview, conducted in 1990. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully\nacknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. First thing I want to\nask is the full names of your parents and -- and siblings, and where they were born.",
        "Answer: O-Okay. My father -- My father\u2019s name was Oscar von Halle. He was born in\nRustock, Germany, moved to Hamburg. He was an architect. He -- He -- He di -- He left\nGermany with our family in 1933, as soon as Hitler came to power, and stayed in -- he\nleft Germany and went to Amsterdam, Holland. We stayed in Amsterdam, Holland from\n1933, throughout the war. He didn\u2019t see the end of the war. He was arrested while we\nwere in hiding. My mother and I escaped, and he stayed in a Dutch concentration camp\nfor some time, and then was transported to Auschwitz, and died in Auschwitz. My\nmother ba -- she was born, her name was Henrietta von Halle, maiden name was Cohen,\nshe was born in Berlin. She -- After marrying my father, she moved to Hamburg. Same\nthing, in 1933, with my father, and my brother and I, moved to Amsterdam, and she\nsurvived the war, after having been in hiding for several years, and came to the United\nStates in 1946, and died here in the United States. She was a -- She was a nurse during\nWorld War One, treating German soldiers, and when she came to the United States, she\nbecame a baby nurse, took care of several important families, including Senator Javitz\u2019\nchildren, she -- she was the baby nurse for them, and died here. My brother, his name was\nHans dash Yurgen von Halle. He was born in Hamburg in 1921, moved to, with my\nfamily obviously, moved to Amsterdam in 1933, went to s -- high school -- to primary\nschool and high school there. And he was one of the very first Jews, together with me,\nwho were arrested in Amsterdam. The year was 1941, we were -- there were 250 young\nGerman Jews arrested, and underline the word German, only German Jews, between the\nages of 16 and 21.",
        "Q: May I ask you why do you think that it was only German Jews?",
        "A: At that time the Germans had a system. They felt if they could get first rid of German\nJews, that wouldn\u2019t disturb the Dutch Jews too much. The one thing they didn\u2019t want is\nany kind of -- I don\u2019t want to call it an uprising, but they didn\u2019t want any trouble. And by\ntaking the German ga -- the Germans developed a system where they took one part of a\ngroup of Jews. They didn\u2019t just arrest Jews, it was always a group of Jews, it was first the\nGerman Jews, then the male -- male Jews between the ages of 16 and 21, then another\nlittle group, then another little group. There was always a group, so that everybody else\nstill felt, \u201cOh my God, thank goodness they didn\u2019t take me.\u201d And this was the German\nmode of operation, one group at a time. Then they took people who were not married. It\nwas young people if not married, then young people to a certain age, who were married.\nYou know, it was always a group of people.",
        "Q: It makes me wonder, between the German Jews and the Dutch Jews, before that time,\ndid you communicate with the other Jewish community?",
        "A: Oh yes, indeed, indeed.",
        "Q: Could you talk about that a little bit?",
        "A: Well the -- the -- the Jews of Holland were very liberal in their -- in their -- in their\nlife, at -- it -- they -- we had perfect communication, there was no difference between the\nGerman Jews and the Dutch Jews. There was no anti-Semitism that I was aware of. I\nspoke fluently Dutch, so did my brother. And nobody ever asked, you know, where were\nyou born. We were -- We were Jews, living in Holland. As fact, we were living next door\nto Anne Frank. Anne Frank and I grew up together, and our history is almost identical.\nYo -- Which of course I have recorded previously, at the -- at the Holocaust Museum in --\nin Washington and -- etcetera.",
        "Q: The Frank family, were they distinctive in any way?",
        "A: No, no. He was -- He was a businessman who started -- who was a successful\nbusinessman in Frankfurt. He -- He came to Holland, and to Amsterdam, and started a\nnew business, and it was in that business of his, on the princinkraft which -- where the\nfamily and some other people were hiding. It was in his business, and of course the story\nis well known, I\u2019m not going to go through that story. He was -- He was an average\nbusinessman, and the girls --",
        "Q: And he was friends with your family?",
        "A: No, no. I would not say they were -- we were friends. We were -- We knew each\nother, let\u2019s put it that way, and that\u2019s about -- don\u2019t forget the girls -- Anne was six or\nseven years younger than I was, and when I came to Amsterdam, I was 11, and Anne was\nfive. And as an 11 year old boy, you do not have too much connections with a five year\nold girl. And even though her sister was, I think, two years older, but she also was much\nyounger. So --",
        "A: How about your pre-war recollection then, of anti-Semitism?",
        "Q: None -- Well, except for the fact that Hitler came to power in 1933, in -- I believe it\nwas January, and of course we had -- the Nazi movement was very active in Germany,\nand as far as that is concerned, we -- we were -- I wa -- I wouldn\u2019t say suffering, it was\n1933, we were very much aware of what the Nazi movement was all about. And my\nfather decided -- he was a very successful architect in Hamburg, he decided he didn\u2019t\nwant his two sons to grow up under this regime, and therefore made the sacrifice of\nleaving his successful business, and went to Holland, where in Holland we were not\nallowed to work. Anyways, he was not allowed to work. You could live there, but you\ncould not work there, that was the problem.",
        "Q: How did you make a living?",
        "A: Well, my father -- my father worked, you might call it illegally, for a Dutch bank, was\na private ban -- it was a -- in -- in -- in Europe you have a lot of these private banks, it\u2019s\nnot like Chase-Manhattan here, or so, it was just a littl -- little private bank, it so\nhappened it was owned by a member of the family, that bank. And my mother, she took\nin people to live with us, borders. She took in borders and so, between those two, we\nmade a -- a -- just barely a living.",
        "Q: Do you remember feeling poor, or were you glad to be in Holland, or --",
        "A: No, we never felt poor. It is true that we did not have a lot of things that other people\nhad, in other words, we didn\u2019t own a car, or you know, we f-finally were able to get a\nbicycle, my brother and I, each. And -- But I never felt poor, even though I think we were\npoor, but we never felt poor.",
        "Q: And your experience in the Dutch schools was?",
        "A: Oh, was perfect. I -- I loved it, I was good at it. My -- My best subject was Dutch. I --\nI -- I got the highest -- the highest numbers in -- in -- in Dutch language, and I -- and I\nspoke almost without an accent.",
        "Q: As you do now, so -- now, in going into wartime and the connections, your\nconnections with the underground, with the Dutch underground --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: I know at one time you mentioned that the underground found you and your mother\nhiding in a haystack?",
        "A: Well, no, that -- yes, we were hiding in a haystack, but we were on a -- my father --\nmy father, my mother and I -- that was after my brother already had been killed. We\u2019re\ntaking about the year 1942, my father, my mother and I went to a farmhouse, in the\nsouthern part of Holland, a province of Limberg, and there was a problem there, there\nwas another family that came, a Mr. and Mrs. Kahn, and Mrs. Kahn was a very attractive\nyoung lady. Her husband was an accountant, and he looked -- I don\u2019t know how those\ntwo ever got married, he was the opposite from her, and she started an affair with the\nfarmer, very -- wit -- I mean, a very silly thing to do, in -- under the circumstances, and\nthe wife of the farmer found out about it, and she -- they had children, and in her despair,\nand I can\u2019t blame her, she went to the Gestapo and told them what the problem was, and\nso one day, while we were all sitting for ouch -- we were sitting down at dinner time, I\nlook -- we looked out the window, and there were four or five Gestapo agents driving up\nand coming -- you know, running into the building. And Mr. Kahn -- Mrs. Kahn went out\nthe back door. My father went up -- went up in the attic, and my mother went into the\nbedroom and I went into a bathroom. I mean, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not a bathroom as we know it in\nAmerica, it\u2019s you know, it\u2019s just a toilet, and there was a little ledge, and I was hiding\nbehind the ledge. And they arrested my father, and they arrested Mr. Kahn, and my\nmother and I, we -- it\u2019s a long story, really, but she was hiding in a closet, and they --\nthey opened up every closet in the house and finally they -- to make a very long story\nshort, there\u2019s much more to it, but during the night, I put up a ladder against the house\nand ma -- got my mother out of the window, and then we went into a haystack, and then\nafter that, there was a young girl -- this was way past midnight -- a young girl of the\nDutch -- of the Dutch underground, sh-she probably was no more than 16 or 17 years old,\ncame on a bicycle to tell us that the -- th-the Germans were aware that they were -- that\nthey had missed two more Jews, that\u2019s my mother and I, and Mrs. Kahn for that matter,\nand so they were on their way back. So, we were in a haystack, yes, but only for about a\ncouple of hours, until the young girl came, and we had to leave there.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you what your experiences all together were, with the Dutch\nunderground, and if you were aided by any other philanthropic agency.",
        "A: No. I had no -- I did not have much experience with the Dutch underground, as a fact,\nI didn\u2019t even know who that young girl was. I found out much later, that she was a\nmember of the un -- I mean, a member of the underground, and the -- the person who had\noriginally -- was helping us, and we were hiding in his apartment before we went down to\nthe farmhouse, was a professor. I obm -- I went to college for one year, and he was one of\nthe professors --",
        "Q: Where did you go to college?",
        "A: In Amsterdam. It\u2019s a engineering college, which I really wasn\u2019t interested in\nengineering, but my father thought I should be in -- in architecture, which I didn\u2019t want,\nand so I wound up in -- in engineering, which I didn\u2019t want either, but that\u2019s a long story.\nAnd so, I didn\u2019t know, I had no idea until much, much later, that Mr. -- that my di --\nprofessor, whose name was Mr. Initout, was a member of the Dutch underground. He\nnever told me. It was much later, towards the end of the war, and it was when we -- when\nwe fled the farmhouse, we -- we went back to Amsterdam, and back to Mr. Initout, where\nwe were originally, in his small apartment.",
        "Q: Did he know you were coming?",
        "A: Well, when I arrived in Amsterdam, I made a telephone call from that -- from the train\nstation, and told them what had happened, that my father was arrested, and -- you know,\nand he was -- he -- he was absolutely great, without giving it a minute thought, he told us\nto come right over, which wasn\u2019t so easy because, remember, we were Jews, and I -- I\nlook pretty Jewish, and we -- every Jew was supposed to wear a yellow star, which --\nwhich we wore, but not after we went into hiding. And so here we\u2019re in Amsterdam\nwithout the Jewish star, and we were not allowed to be on a -- on a -- on a -- on a bus or -\n- or tram, as they call it in Amsterdam, so we had -- we walked all the way from\nAmsterdam central, to Amsterdam west. As fact, he lived only a few blocks from where\nAnne Frank was hiding. So actually, Anne Frank, after we went into hiding, we -- known\n-- unbeknown to each other, we were very, very close to each other, in -- in distance.",
        "Q: Is that when your mother and you began to live together silently in the one room?",
        "A: In one room. We lived in one room from 19 -- we lived in that room for two and a half\nyears. Never saw the light, never saw -- I mean, I saw light, but never saw the sunshine\ncoming, never ch --",
        "Q: There was no window in this room?",
        "A: There was a -- There was a window, yeah, you -- you could see the light, but you were\nnever exposed to the sunshine. In other words, as you know, in this country, or in most\ncivilized countries, if you\u2019re in prison, you\u2019re allowed at least one hour a day of exercise,\nand -- and being exposed to sunlight and -- and -- and etcetera, etcetera. We have not\nbeen out of that room for two and a half years.",
        "Q: Wa -- Ya -- I -- [heard your story, and hearing it, I was so curious that there could be\nall these people coming to visit him, and him a member of the underground, and yet they\n-- are you sure they did not know, or did they just not tell that they knew that you and\nyour mother were there?",
        "A: Well, I can\u2019t -- The only thing -- I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know the answer to that. I know\nthat his brother-in-law knew that we were there because -- and there -- I\u2019m sure there\nwere some other people that knew about it, who he felt he could trust. But the -- the sad\npart of the story is that four weeks, or approximately four weeks before the end of the\nwar, he was caught by the Germans on one of his missions, he was on a mission, I don\u2019t\nknow wh-what his mission was, and he was caught and he was executed. And so --",
        "Q: How did you and your mother find out?",
        "A: We -- There was, again, somebody from the underground who came to the house, t-to\ntell us that terrible news. His wife, incidentally, had died about a year before, but she died\nof natural causes. So I can\u2019t -- So we were just informed of it, and we had to, again, in a\nbig, big hurry, to leave -- leave the apartment.",
        "Q: And how was it arranged where you would go next?",
        "A: That was another -- Again, I can\u2019t tell -- through the underground, now, I don\u2019t know\nmuch about it, they had a -- a name and an address for us, it was another teacher and his\nwife, who I\u2019d never met, never heard their name mentioned, and that\u2019s where we spent\nthe last four weeks.",
        "Q: And by that time, were the professor\u2019s children teenagers?",
        "A: Yeah, they were -- they had a boy and a girl. The girl was -- The boy was my age, and\nthe girl was maybe two years older.",
        "Q: What was your relationship, if any, with them?",
        "A: Well, was a very good relationship. Y-You -- You can imagine living in -- in -- you\nknow, it was a small apartment. They had -- There were three bedrooms, I believe, and\none was occupied by the -- by the parents, one was occupied by the brother and sister,\nwho had separate bedrooms, but because of -- because of us coming there, they had to\nshare the -- a bedroom, and then my mother and I shared the other bedroom, and so it\u2019s\nbeen a --",
        "Q: So they knew you were there?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh yes, oh yes, they were -- you know --",
        "Q: Did they bring you food?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yeah. Well, of course, food in th -- probably the worst part of that entire\nwar experience was the last six - nine months, where we had no food. There was no food.\nNow, you might say, how do y -- how do you exist on no food? Well, we ate what is\ncalled pulp, which is stuff that is fed to the -- to the -- to the cows. And that\u2019s what we\nate.",
        "Q: \u2019'm curious to know more about your friendship with the teenage children, especially\nafter their father died. Were you able to keep 1n touch?",
        "A: Yes, yes, as fact, th-the daughter got married pretty soon after. She married a -- a\nminister, a -- a Protestant minister. And somehow over the years, we -- we lost contact\nand the son, I had brought over here, fo-for a visit, I wanted him to see America.",
        "Q: How did you -- How do you mean you brought him?",
        "A: Well, I -- I wanted him to see America, and so we somehow got together here in the\nUnited States for just about a week or so. And just showing him around, and --",
        "Q: What year was that?",
        "A: My goodness. I don\u2019t really remember, but 1t was probably, if I came in 1945, I would\nsay probably in 19 -- early \u201850.",
        "Q: And did you pay his way, or send him money, or --",
        "A: It so happened, no, I did not pay his way, he came here. He worked -- He worked for a\ncompany which had sent him over here, it\u2019s just that he had quite a bit of time on his\nhand, and it was whatever he had to do for his company, it -- 1t did not take that long, and\nso I had a lot of time that I could show him -- I wouldn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t show him America,\nbut I did show him New York. That\u2019s -- That\u2019s as far as I could go.",
        "Q: | -- It -- Is there anything else you want to add before we get to the liberation and\nafter?",
        "A: Well, you know, if I had to do that, I would have to start from -- from day one, and I\ndon\u2019t think, you know, and I\u2019ve done that, an-and it\u2019s on tape, and it\u2019s in the Holocaust\nmuseum in Washington. No, I -- I -- I just would say, like I said before, that the last six -\nnine months were horrible, just horrible. I mean, again, you might say, compared to\nwhat? To the poor people who were in Auschwitz, it wasn\u2019t horrible. But I am probably\none of the few people that know what hunger is. And I's -- when I say hunger, I mean\nhunger. We talk about hunger, about poor people in -- in America. Yes, that may be so,\nbut that\u2019s not hunger. Hunger means you have nothing to eat. You c -- You can eat grass,\nor you can eat, you know, you -- you just have nothing to eat, there was nothing, nothing\nto eat. And -- And that was not just us, I mean, the Dutch people living in Amsterdam.\nAnd one of the reasons was, because Holland was -- the southern part of Holland was\nliberated already in 1944. There was one little pocket of Holland, the province of north --\nnorth Holland, which had Amsterdam, and Rotterdam, and The Hague in there, that little\npocket, it\u2019s a -- you know, it\u2019s a -- Holland is a small country altogether, but that little\npocket was not liberated. Hitler already had committed suicide, and we were still under\noccupation. The entire cun -- The entire continent of Europe was liberated, except -- I\nmean, I\u2019m only talking about days now, that little part of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and ha\n-- and -- and -- and -- and The Hague, were still under German occupation for a couple of\ndays after Hitler had committed suicide, So we were the very last one, and that\u2019s why\nthere was no food, period.",
        "Q: Because there was no transport allowed through?",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell you the reason why, all I know 1s we were absolutely starving, starving.\nAnd so, I know what hunger 1s. I would wake up in the middle of the night -- in the\nmiddle of the night, I would wake up and -- and -- and jump up in bed, because why\u2019?\nBecause I saw a piece of bread in my dream, and that gave me a complete nightmare. So,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Well, \u2019'm going to turn over to -- to side B --",
        "A: Ok --",
        "Q: -- to talk about liberation.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: So I'd -- I'd really -- I-I know that I was very touched by your words, \u201cI didn\u2019t cry for\nfive years during the war, but when I saw Jewish boys, with Jewish stars on Canadian\nuniforms,\u201d --",
        "A: Well let me -- we were -- we were liberated not by the American army, but by the\nCanadian army. Attached to the Canadian army, was a small de -- brigade, or whatever\nyou want to call it, of the Jewish brigade. We were -- Now, after having been inside a\nroom for two and a half years, and that does not include the time we spent on the farm, so\nwe were finally liberated --",
        "Q: How did you find out?",
        "A: You knew it, you knew it. People were all of a sudden, you know, shouting and -- and\n-- and -- and -- and -- and -- I mean, there was just joy all over, so you knew you could\nleave. And I would leave with my mother, and truthfully, we didn\u2019t ba -- we really didn\u2019t\neven know where to go. We were just walking, and -- and all of a sudden, we saw a\nCanadian soldier. And I can\u2019t tell you the feeling that we had, after having been under\nGerman occupation, all you saw were Nazi soldiers, swastikas flying all over the place,\nand all of a sudden, for the first time in five years, we see an allied soldier in uniform. I --\nI don\u2019t think I can describe it, there is no way that I can describe the feeling. And as we\ngot closer to this Canadian soldier, I happened to see -- so I -- I went over there, and\nwanted to shake hands with him, when I saw a -- on his sleeve, the word Jewish brigade,\nwith the Jewish star. Now, if you think -- I mean, we were so enthralled by the fact that\nwe Saw a -- an allied soldier, but then, to see a Jewish soldier in a -- in a Canadian\nuniform with the -- with the Jewish star, after five years of swastikas, I -- it -- it -- it just -\n- you -- I can\u2019t describe it. And as I -- as you just said before, after having lost my father,\nafter having lost my brother, or it\u2019s in -- in reverse order, I might say, in order to keep my\nmother, you know, I never cried. But when I saw that Jewish soldier, I just -- I -- I\ncouldn\u2019t -- I -- I just broke down. I was in tears, absolutely in tears. So that was the first\nday of liberation. And -- And then, we -- we had to look for a place to live. Now, we still\n-- we had a little money, which we didn\u2019t have on us, but there was a -- one of our\nneighbors, a very lovely, elderly lady, she had some of our money, that we gave her the\nday then when we left our apartment in Amsterdam, in 1941. And -- And every penny\nthat we gave her was still there, which in itself is unusual. And we finally rented a room,\nnot an apartment, just a room, in the old neighborhood I might say.",
        "Q: Do you remember how much it cost?",
        "A: I haven\u2019t got the foggiest notion. And we -- we stayed there, my mother and I, in one\nroom. Well, we were used to that by now, after two and a half years. And about four\nweeks later, there was a knock on the door, and Dutch police knocked on the door, are\nyou, you know, at that time my first name was Gerd, not Gerald, or Gerry, as it is now.\n\u201cAre you Gerd von Halle?\u201d I said yes. \u201cIs -- Are you Henrietta von Halle?\u201d Yes. \u201cYou\u2019re\narrested.\u201d We were arrested again four weeks, or six weeks -- four weeks I would say,\nafter liberation. Why were we arrested? The Dutch police, after liberation, went back to\nthe old files that they had, and when we came to Amsterdam in 1933, we were German\ncitizens, and therefore, we were registered as Germans. And when the Dutch police after\nthe war, wanted to round up all the Germans, they went back to their old files, and lo and\nbehold, there are two more Germans, the von Halles. And so they arrested us, took us to a\nschool where they had put all Nazis. And here, I can\u2019t -- I mean, I don\u2019t know whether\nyou can picture that, but here we are in -- 1n -- in -- in the -- in a big room with all\nGerman Nazis. Well, thank goodness, after about six, eight, nine hours of telling -- you\nknow, negotiating with -- with the police in -- or not negotiating, there was nothing to\nnegotiate, I was just telling them who we were, and that we were not -- you know, we\nwere Jews, and so they let us go. But that was just a --",
        "Q: Did you recognize any specific people --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- in the Nazis?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you have any kind of interchange or dialog conversation with them?",
        "A: Darn -- Darn tootin\u2019, no.",
        "Q: Were you frightened?",
        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t call it frightened, no. I don\u2019t think we were frightened. We were -- It\nwas a terrible, terrible feeling to be in room with basically, with your family\u2019s ex-\nexecutioners. I mean, I -- I\u2019m not saying that these people in that room were -- executed\nmy father and my brother, but they were part of the same --",
        "Q: And how did you convince them you were Jewish?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a good question, I forgot. I did the -- I did the talking. I don\u2019t -- I -- I -- I --\nI really don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s more than 50 years ago, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember what I\ndid, but --",
        "Q: I\u2019ve heard this story before, that happened to people on -- upon liberation, the Jews\nwere taken in --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- you know, until they could prove --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- that they were Jewish. [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how I proved it, but I don\u2019t think it was that difficult.",
        "Q: So you then -- How soon after -- What -- What was your life like between this point of\nthe apartment, you returned back to the apartment with your mother, and the time that\nyou went to America, what was that like?",
        "A: Well, I loved -- I loved Amsterdam. That was -- you know, I grew up there, and I -- I\nloved to spend time there, but I also realized that my future was lying in America. And\nwe had, if the war, incidentally, had broken out maybe two months later, we would have\nbeen in America, because our -- our quota number was due. We just missed it by -- by --\nby -- by a month or two.",
        "Q: So you had applied long before --",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, except the German quota was -- was terribly over -- oversubscribed,\nso to speak.",
        "Q: Did you apply when your father was alive?",
        "A: Oh yes. That was -- We applied before the war, and -- but, you know, as I said, if -- if\nthe war had broken out two months later, we would have been in America. It didn\u2019t turn\nout that way. And what did I do? Well, my ambition -- I always wanted to be a dentist.\nNow, obviously, I didn\u2019t have the educational background, because five years of ma --\nyou know, from age -- the war broke out in 40 -- from -- from age 18 to age 23, I was\nunder German occupation. And so, those are the years when your education really --\nwhere you get your education. And I only had one year that -- it was even under German\noccupation, I had one year of that college. Thank goodness, because that\u2019s where I met\nmy -- my savior, th-the -- the teacher who saved our lives. And so -- so what I did,\nbecause obviously I couldn\u2019t go to dental college, I didn\u2019t have the background, I didn\u2019t\nhave the -- the original background for -- for colle -- for dental college, I went to a dental\nlaboratory, and although that took a few months til I got that lined up. And then when I\ncame to America, well, then I came -- basically I came on a ship.",
        "Q: Wait -- What -- Now, how did you decide to go and your mother to stay, and how\nmuch time was there in between liberation and your --",
        "A: My leaving? The liberation took place in May of 1945, and I left for America in the\nend of October. So --",
        "Q: And how -- Did you have family in the United States that helped you?",
        "A: Well, helped me 1s -- is the wrong word to use. They -- I had two uncles here in the\nUnited States, and --",
        "Q: Mother\u2019s?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s brothers. And they lived in -- in -- in the United States. So I came on a\ntroop carrier. When I say a troop carrier, this was a tr -- a troop carrier of the Dutch\nMerchant Marine. The -- The d -- The Dutch Merchant Marine was just about wiped out\nduring the war, and they -- the -- the Dutch government bought -- I don\u2019t know whether\nthey bought it or were given, liberty ships. And so these liberty ships wer-were supposed\nto be brought back to Holland, and so they had a troop carrier, with Dutch Merchant\nMarine sailors, who came to the United States, to pick up these ships, to take them back\nto Holland. And I was the only civilian on that -- on that troop carrier. And if you ask me\nhow I got onto that troop carrier, I haven\u2019t got the foggiest notion.",
        "Q: Was it difficult to say goodbye to your mother?",
        "A: Yes, like -- Well, she -- I knew she would -- she would come, too, so it\u2019s not a matter\nthat I wasn\u2019t going to see her. You know, I -- She came about six, seven months later.",
        "Q: Why did she wait?",
        "A: Because this troop carrier was -- was only men, there was no room for women, and so\nshe couldn\u2019t. And she finally came on a -- on -- by plane.",
        "Q: What were your expectations when you got on that carrier, of what America would be\nlike, and what you might be able to do?",
        "A: Well, like every foreigner, America -- America\u2019s the land that is -- where the streets\nare lined with gold. Now, the reality of course, is completely different. But everybody\nthought America is, you know, that\u2019s the land where you want to be. I -- I had heard a\ngreat deal about America, and I -- I had made up my mind that when I came -- when I\ncome to America, I wanted to be an American. I didn\u2019t want for the rest of my life to be\nthe refugee who can\u2019t speak the language, or -- or who speaks it with a very heavy\naccent. The -- The one thing that I wanted more than anything else, I wanted to be\nAmerican. I wanted to be looked upon as an American. I wanted to speak like an\nAmerican, I wanted to act like an American, and that was -- so when I came to this\ncountry, I paid special attention to how people speak, and --",
        "Q: Before we go too much further into America, you first started out in a refugee center.\nAnd what was that [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, no, this came here mo -- in other words, when I arrived in the United States, I\narrived in Hoboken, the ship landed in Hoboken. And there was the Steven -- Steven\nWeiss, Rabbi Steven Weiss had a refugee ce -- had a -- had a Temple on the west side of\n-- on Central Park West, and he had a refugee center, I believe it was somewhere around\n67\" Street, or 69\" Street, on -- near -- near Central Park West, in New York. And, so I\nwent directly from the ship to the refugee center, and --",
        "Q: Was there someone to greet you?",
        "A: At the refugee center?",
        "Q: At the ship, or [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, at the ship, my -- one of my uncles picked me up and took me to the refugee\ncenter.",
        "Q: He lived in New York?",
        "A: He lived in New York.",
        "Q: But he couldn\u2019t put you up?",
        "A: That\u2019s a hard question to answer. I -- I know he didn\u2019t, whether he could have, that\u2019s a\ndifferent -- that\u2019s a different question.",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t recollect any feelings about that?",
        "A: No, not really. I was so -- I was so elated to be in America, that that never really\nentered my mind. So I -- So I arrived there, and -- and I -- and the f -- one of the first\nthings -- there are two things that struck me when I arrived in the United States. The first\nthing was, when I arrived in Hoboken, oh my God, it was -- there was so much dirt on the\nstreet. And coming from Holland, where they -- where they -- where they wash the\nsidewalks -- not any more, not today, but I\u2019m talking about in the -- in the 40\u2019s, th-they --\nthey -- they washed the sidewalks, and here I come to America, and -- and -- and -- and\nthe dirt is all over the place. I -- That struck me as strange. And the second thing, when I\ngot to the refugee center, there was a radio, and I had never heard a commercial in my\nlife. In -- In -- In Holland, you pay for the privilege of listening to radio, and there are no\ncommercials, only in America. And here you hear that beautiful music, and then all of a\nsudden you hear about the -- the milk commercial, and the -- and the -- and the -- and --\nand the McDonald\u2019s, or maybe McDonald\u2019s wasn\u2019t around at that time, but whatever\ncommercials they had. And that struck me as very strange. I had to get used to that, every\n-- every five minutes, a commercial.",
        "Q: You mentioned music, do you remember what kind of music you listened to?",
        "A: Well, we -- we were, as teenagers in Holland, we listened to jazz. That was my -- That\nwas my thing. My parents listened to Beethoven, and we listened to Cab Calloway, and --\nand -- and -- and -- and you know, all the other people.",
        "Q: Big band?",
        "A: Big band. Oh yes, oh yes, we, you know.",
        "Q: Did you get -- There -- There was such a different feeling actually, in America, the\nstories of, you know, dancing, and big bands, live performances, and did you get any of\nthat when you came over? Did you have an opportunity to go to any dances, or --",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t afford it. I couldn\u2019t afford it, but that doesn\u2019t mean I -- I couldn\u2019t listen to\nthe radio, I -- I -- you know, one of the first things I got was a radio. Television, of\ncourse, came later. And so I listened -- I listened to the big bands, and I loved it, you\nknow.",
        "Q: And who was president at that time?",
        "A: President was Harry Truman. Harry Truman, the -- probably one of the greatest\npresidents this country ever had.",
        "Q: Why do you feel that way about Harry Truman\u2019?",
        "A: Harry Truman, because Harry Truman, I believe, if I am not mistaken, was -- was the\npresident who had a -- a sign on his desk which said, the buck stops here. And that\u2019s --\nHarry Truman, if he saw it as -- as yellow, he called it yellow, and if it was black, he\ncalled it black, and if 1t was white, he called it white, and there was no fudging between\nblack and white, it was just the way he saw it, and that\u2019s the way he\u2019s -- did it. I -- I --\nAlthough, at the time, when he was president, I wasn\u2019t that impressed with him, but each\nyear that goes by, and that\u2019s why I said, I think he was one of the greatest presidents this\ncountry has ever had.",
        "Q: Because he was straightforward?",
        "A: He was straightforward, and he was just honest.",
        "Q: Now I know that in your interview at the museum, you said your first job was at\nGimbel\u2019s, and I -- and I hear you again today saying that you wanted to become a real\nAmerican more than anything else. What do you mean, or did you mean by real\nAmerican?",
        "A: Well, America, to me, at that time, stood for everything that\u2019s good in the world. I\nmean, here is a country that -- maybe too late for -- for my family, but came to the rescue\nof -- of Europe. They could have, if they had wanted to, they could have been -- stayed\nout of the war, and here they -- they -- they liberated Europe, they liber -- liberated the --\nthe Far East. There may have been some self interest in this, but the fact of the matter is,\nthis was the country that stood for everything that I believed in.",
        "Q: Do you still feel this in retrospect, or in looking at -- to see -- have you ever been\nangry or worried about the fact that America waited as it did, to liberate?",
        "A: No. I -- I'll tell you what I was angry about with America, and -- you see, Mr.\nRoosevelt, I know he was a great friend of the Jews, the Jews thought he was -- he was\nnext -- sitting next to God. I never felt that way, and the reason why I didn\u2019t feel that\nway, 1S because Mr. Roosevelt could have, very easily, bombed the -- the -- the railroad\ntracks leading to Auschwitz and other concentration camps. He could have bombed the\novens and the gas chambers very easily. And I certainly don\u2019t want anybody to tell me,\n\u201cYeah, but if he had done that, he might have killed innocent people in the camp.\u201d That\ndoes not hold water with me, for good reasons, and I don't --",
        "Q: What is the reason?",
        "A: Well, the reason is, these people were on their way to the -- to -- to -- to a gas\nchamber, and if they could -- if Mr. Roosevelt could have bombed those gas chambers,\nand if he had to do it twice or three times, and over again if they rebuilt it, so be it. So,\nmy anger, if I have any, is not -- is certainly not with America, but it\u2019s with Mr.\nRoosevelt. And that\u2019s why I -- wh-when Mr. Truman came along, he was such a breath of\nfresh air, you know.",
        "Q: So, how was it that your mother came by plane?",
        "A: Well, there were -- I mean, this was not like today where -- where you have dozens\nand dozens of planes landing from -- from -- from -- from Holland, and then any other\ncountry, but there were some planes, and she was one of them -- she was on one of them.",
        "Q: How did she get the money, or did she have it [indecipherable]",
        "A: Haven\u2019t got the foggiest notion.",
        "Q: Maybe from the money that --",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: -- the neighbor saved?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. My wife thinks that she got it from her brothers and then she paid it back\nto them. I -- That -- That may be so, and it may not be so.",
        "Q: Were you there to meet her?",
        "A: Oh, sure. Oh, sure.",
        "Q: Did you have any recollection of that moment, or --",
        "A: No, it\u2019s really -- it wasn\u2019t that dramatic. You know, it\u2019s like -- like a -- a child going\noff to college and doesn\u2019t see their parents for six months, so when they come back,\nthey\u2019re very happy to see their parents, but it\u2019s not that, my goodness, you know, it\u2019s not\nsomething that would have a lasting impression on you.",
        "Q: So, by the time she arrived, did you have a place to live and a job, and --",
        "A: Well, let me t -- Would you like to hear the -- the day one, day one in America? So,\nhere I arrived in the -- in Rabbi Weiss\u2019s refugee center, and now I was told, before I came\nto hol -- before I came to America, that the thing you have to do, if you want to get a job\nin America, you have to buy the New York Times. And, so I arrived, I had five dollars in\nmy pocket, and I arrived at that refugee center, went to sleep the -- that night, woke up\nthe next morning, and now I needed a job, and I needed a job in a hurry. So, I\nremembered the New York Times, and I walked down from wherever it was, 67\" Street,\non Central Park West, I walked down Central Park West to 59\" Street, and there was, and\nstill is to -- to this very day, a kiosk, a -- a -- a newsstand. It\u2019s still there. And I went to\nask the man for the New York t -- oh, I saw the New York Times lying there, and it was a\nnickel. So I put down a nickel, and now I was down to four dollars and 95 cents. And I\ntook the newspaper and I went into Central Park, and I want to sit on a bench, and first of\nall, I was absolutely amazed, I couldn\u2019t believe it, the New York Times came in -- in\nfour, five, six sections. When I left Holland, in those days, right after the war, the\nnewspaper was one page. That was the newspaper. And here I come to New York, and --\nand I mean it was two inches thick. And so I took it into Central Park, sat down on a\nbench, and it took me -- it took me 20 minutes just to find out in what section of the New\nYork Times, do I find the wanted ads, the employment ads. And -- And finally I -- I did\nfind it. Now, of course, I spoke very, very little English, just a year or two what I had\nlearned in school. And -- And I tried to read it, and I couldn\u2019t find it because -- or I\ncouldn\u2019t read it because everything was abbreviated. APRX, now what does that stand\nfor? Approximately? I mean, you know, I had no idea. And so I said to myself, let me go\nto the next bench, there was a man sitting there, and I went over there, and I asked him, I\nsaid, \u201cI wonder whether you can help me?\u201d And what do you think he said? He says, \u201cI\nnot speak English.\u201d So -- So I was more or less forced to do it on my own, and I saw an\nad by Gimbel\u2019s on 34\" Street, they are no longer there today, but in those days Gimbel\u2019s\nwas down on 34\" Street. I went there, went to the employment office, and there was a -- a\nreal New York woman, a | -- I was going to say a lady, but to me she was not a lady, she\nwas a woman who said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m looking for a job.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we have -- we\u2019re looking for ri,\u201d -- this was just before Christmas, they were\nlooking for Christmas help. \u201cWe have a -- We have -- We\u2019re looking for wrappers.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cOh good, that\u2019s what I always wanted to be, a wrapper.\u201d I wanted to be a wrapper\nin -- in America. So I got a job. So they took me and put me in the -- 1n the toy\ndepartment, and I\u2019m wrapping toys like crazy, and all of a sudden, there is a hu -- I\u2019m --\nI\u2019m handling a huge doll, which was made out of porcelain. In those days, plastic wasn\u2019t\nthat popular. And I dropped it on the floor in 5,000,000 pieces and the supervisor -- su-\nsupervisor was coming -- running over, and he says, \u201cYou can\u2019t work here. Go up to the\n11\" floor, the rug department.\u201d So I was in the rug department, wrapping rugs.",

        "A: So, here I am in the toy department of Gimbel\u2019s, and then I learned my first lesson in\nAmerica. Christmas came and went, and I\u2019m picking up my paycheck, and what is in the\npaycheck? A pink slip. It says, \u201cYour services are no longer needed. Thank you very\nmuch, and here is your check.\u201d Well, after -- after maybe a month or two in America, I\u2019m\nunemployed, and I -- you know, I -- there was no Social Security af -- as far as I was\nconcerned, and so I had to do some fast working, and I, by luck, my uncle had a dentist,\nand I wanted to go into the dental laboratory business, because that\u2019s as close to being a\ndentist as you can get. And he got me a job on 41\u201c Street, in the Herald-Tribune building,\nand there I got a job doing basically, at the bottom of the ladder, pouring casts. And I\nwanted to -- I really wanted to advance myself, and I was held back in that laboratory.\nAnd after about six months or so working in that lab, I -- I realized that I would never\nadvance there, and I wanted to learn the business, and learn it in a hurry, so there was,\nagain through connections, I found a laboratory, a one man lab, and I told him what I\nwanted, and he says, \u201cI'll tell you what. I\u2019ll let you work for me, if you pay me.\u201d Instead\nof him paying me, I had to pay him, and I was willing to do that. I had saved -- you\nknow, I worked at Gimbel\u2019s for two months, and -- and the -- and the dental laboratory\nfor six months, and so I -- you know, I had saved a couple of dollars. So I was -- I\nactually paid him for the privilege of working for him. But I learned a great deal, and I\nthen opened up my own dental lab, on --",
        "Q: After how long in America?",
        "A: I would say probably the whole -- the -- about a year and a half, or maybe two years,\nor something like that.",
        "Q: Before we go into this career that you -- you managed so quickly, when your mother\ncame to America, did you and she have an apartment together?",
        "A: Yes, 236 East 82\u2122 Street. We had -- Actually, we had a -- we had two rooms, tiny,\ntiny, tiny, little rooms, one was a bedroom that just was big enough to hold a b -- a -- a\nbed, and a living room which had a couch and a -- and -- and a table, you know, and so\non. And so my mother would sleep in the bed, and I would sleep on the couch, and -- and",

        "A: She got a job almost immediately, through a pediatrician which my uncle knew, she\ngot a job as a baby nurse. Her very first job was in Cedarhurst, Long Island, I remember,\nand people loved her. She ha -- She was a lovely, lovely person, and a fabulous, fabulous\nbaby nurse. And so this doctor, who recommended her, this pediatrician who\nrecommended her to these people, when she was finished with that job, he had jobs lined\nup for her, one after another. So she hardly ever was at -- in the house, because she lived,\nobviously, with the people where she was the baby nurse.",

        "Q: Would this have been 1946, this time?",

        "Q: Did you meet other people who -- other survivors?",
        "A: Yes, yes, indeed I did. Some of my -- I made friends here. I met one couple who were\nneighbors of mine, next door neighbors from Hamburg, not from Amsterdam, from\nHamburg, where I was born. And so I became friends with them, and through them, you\nknow, and of course, all my friends were -- were -- were refugees, and -- and --",

        "A: I, to be very honest with you, my mother came from a very religious home. Excuse\nme. She came from a -- you know, a home where they kept kosher and so on.

        "Q: Where did you find the money\u201d?",
        "A: Well, first of all, I did it with a -- I did it with a partner there, one of the people that I\nmet in that first dental lab, where they wouldn\u2019t let me advance, there was a man who, he\nwas American, he -- he and I went in -- in business together. The -- The name of the\ndental lab was von Halle - Geiger Dental Lab, on Eighth Avenue. That building on\nEighth Avenue is no longer there, there is a motel there now, or whatever. And so we --\nwe were -- we were operating that lab, mostly I was operating it, he -- he was a smart\nboy, he -- he kept his -- he kept his job and did this on the side. But 1t worked out all\nright. But I -- After a couple of years, I realized that I could always make a good living in\na dental laboratory business, but the money is really on the side of the dentist. He makes\nthe money and the laboratory is -- just makes a living. And so I realized that if I wanted\nto advance in America, and make, quote, money, that was the wrong business, at least\nthe way I saw it. And so one day -- well, let me actually -- let me -- when I started the\nlaboratory business, I was single, but then I -- these people -- these friends of mine that\nlived next to me in Hamburg, came up to me one day, and said to me, \u201cGerry, how would\nyou like to have a blind date?\u201d A blind date. And I thought about it for a minute, and I\nsaid to them, \u201cI tell you quite frankly, I would prefer somebody who can see.\u201d So -- So I -\n- So they -- So I went on that blind date, and I came home that night -- we went out -- I --\nI think we went out to Yonkers, New York for -- for -- for a place to eat, and I came\nhome that night and I said to myself, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to marry that girl.\u201d I took her out\na second time, and --",
        "Q: What did you do when you went out to --",
        "A: We went out, the four of us. W-We had dinner in Yonkers, and -- and -- and that was\nit, and -- and they had a car, I didn\u2019t have a car. So they drove us back and forth and, you\nknow, dropped me off. And second time I took her out, I called my mother after that, and\nI said, \u201cI met a girl and I think I\u2019m going to marry her.\u201d And her comment was, \u201cYes,\nyes, yes, yes. I -- I have heard that before.\u201d And I took her out seven times, and we got\nengaged, and that\u2019s my wife of 47 years.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how much longer she\u2019s going to keep me, but for 47 years it\u2019s been --",
        "Q: And what is her full name, or befo -- before she married?",
        "A: Her name -- That\u2019s funny that you\u2019re asking a question like that, because her name\nwas Gerda -- I -- her name ts -- is Gerda, same as my name. G -- My name was G-e-r-d,\nher name is G-e-r-d-a, so there\u2019s Gerd and Gerda, except I changed my name when I\ncame to the United States, when I took my citizenship\u2019s [indecipherable]. I just added --\nbut -- Gerd, I added a - | in between, so that made it Gerald. And her name is Gerda, and\nher maiden name was Freudenberg. Now, I\u2019ll just tell you one little funny story there.\nWhen I got engaged, one of my friends called me up and said to me, \u201cGee, Gerry, I hear\nyou got engaged.\u201d I said yes. \u201cWell, congratulations, what\u2019s her name?\u201d \u201cHer name 1s\nGerda.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s her last name?\u201d And for the life of me, I could not remember that name\nFreudenberg. I could think of Schwartz, and Levy, and Cohen, and I could think of all the\nJewish names, but Freudenberg, I could not, fora million years could -- could I\nremember it. So anyhow, that\u2019s just an -- an aside.",
        "Q: Now you said that your religious life changed during this time.",
        "A: Well, my religious life changed because my wife, although my in-laws were really not\nr -- that religious either, but my wife was. Not that -- you know, she was -- she went to\nSunday school, and you know, to Friday night services with her grandmother and so on,\nnot necessarily with her parents. And so, basically, when we got married, and then -- and\nthen later on, the children came along, we -- we made sure, that is my wife made sure,\nand I followed, and -- and now we\u2019re Temple members -- we\u2019re Temple goers. Last night\nI was at a Temple, and we\u2019re -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve been members of this Temple for\n36 years, and we\u2019re regular Temple mem -- Temple goers.",
        "Q: Has this been an important part of your life?",
        "A: Yes. It has been an important part of my life, and I\u2019Il tell you why. When -- When --\nDuring the war, when I lost my brother, who was my very, very best friend, and was a\ntragic thing, I -- I -- I can\u2019t even start to tell you. And then later on I lost my father. And\nthen we -- And here we\u2019re in hiding, nobody can help us. As a Jew in occ -- under\noccupation, you can\u2019t pick up the phone and dial 911, and have the police come and\nrescue you. 91 -- 911 were the Nazis at that point. And so, here you are, desperate, and\nevery day you didn\u2019t know whether you would live another day. I all of a sudden realized\nthere\u2019s only one person who -- who can probably help -- possibly help me, and that\u2019s\nGod. So I prayed to God, in whatever language it was, and so I became -- God, I -- I bel -\n- I sh -- believed in God, the first time I ever thought of God. And so when -- when I got\nmarried, and my wife wa-wanted to take us to -- to Temple, 1t wasn\u2019t -- you know, I was\nperfectly willing to go.",
        "Q: You\u2019d been preparing for that for a long time?",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, I didn\u2019t -- I -- I-I couldn\u2019t speak he -- I couldn\u2019t read Hebrew or\nanything like that, but I -- I -- I was -- I was Jewish, I felt Jewish, I -- you know, like --",
        "Q: Did you learn Hebrew?",
        "A: Y -- My wife does. My Hebrew I don\u2019t want to brag about. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s not too good.",
        "Q: Speaking of your -- your praying, and your awareness of -- of a higher being, I --\nwhen I heard your story, there were certain times when it almost seemed as if luck, or\nelse a supreme being was looking over you and your mother. For instance, when -- when\nshe hid in the closet --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- and the put the suitc -- they looked in every closet, but that one, and then you\nmoved her under the bed, and they were stacking everything on top, and she was right\nthere.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Have you thought about th-the role of luck, or God, in --",
        "A: Well, at that pa -- very particular point when this happened, you don\u2019t think of\nanything, you\u2019re just thinking of -- of how do I -- you know, how do I save her, how do I\nsave myself. My father already was arrested. You don\u2019t think in those terms. Later on,\nwhen you have time to reflect upon it, that\u2019s when you start thinking in terms, not when it\nhappens.",
        "Q: And have you thought of -- had time to think about that?",
        "A: I think about it -- if I tell you that there is hardly a day that goes by that I don\u2019t think\nabout my brother, because he was my best friend, and there\u2019s hardly a day that goes by\nwhere I don\u2019t think of him. My father, too, but I -- I was closest to my brother. You\nknow, ma -- obviously I think of my father, too.",
        "Q: Plus his -- the brother\u2019s death seemed so --",
        "A: Oh, it was a -- 1-1t was the most gruesome, I don\u2019t even want to go into it. It was the\nmost gruesome, gruesome way that anybody could die. It -- It -- you know, it\u2019s one thing\nto be sh -- you know, to have a shot -- be shot, I mean, which is not exactly nice, either,\nbut the way they -- he was in -- in -- in Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria, and\nthat was about, I think, about the worst of all of them, if th -- 1f you can make a\ndistinction between concentration camps, which you really can\u2019t.",
        "Q: Does your -- When you think about your brother, does your sense of justice, or your\nattitude toward certain political events that have occurred in this country, and in the\nworld, do you think that experience has an effect on your response to current events?",
        "A: I must assume it has. I mean, I -- I\u2019m not aware of it, but I-I\u2019m sure, anything that you\nlive through has a-an affect on -- on -- on your outlook, and -- and on your attitude.",
        "Q: What year was it that you got married?",
        "A: 19 -- I should -- na -- 51.",
        "Q: \u201951, uh-huh.",
        "A: 1951.",
        "Q: So, now that was --",
        "A: Six -- And which -- that was about -- that was about five years after I came.",
        "Q: And that was also when --",
        "A: Or -- Or six years.",
        "Q: -- when Joseph McCarthy began his notorious McCarthy hearings. Do you --",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you relate to those hearings at all, or watch them?",
        "A: Oh yes, I watched -- I watched every day, and I was absolutely furious at his tactics.",
        "Q: Not frightened?",
        "A: No, not frightened. After all, yo -- Well, fr-frightened in -- in a -- in a -- in a different\nsense. I was frightened for -- for America, not for myself. I was frightened for America,\nuntil -- and I was disappointed, I might say, in ma -- in Mr. Eisenhower, President\nEisenhower. I thought, as president, he could have done much more than he did. Harry\nTruman would not have allowed this to go on, I can a -- I can assure you. Eisenhower, in\nthat respect -- ah, he was not a bad president, but in that respect he was wishy-washy.\nAnd I was not happy about that. And so --",
        "Q: We haven\u2019t discussed -- I haven\u2019t heard much about your relationship with the rest of\nyour family, say like when you got married, did your uncles come to your wedding?",
        "A: Yes, they -- I have to -- I have to think for a minute. The answer is no. The answer is\nno.",
        "Q: So, were they living right in New York City?",
        "A: At that point, no. One was living in California.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And the other one was living in South Carolina.",
        "Q: Had they left --",
        "A: Or in Florida.\nA2: Florida and -- and North Carolina.",
        "A: Fine, okay.",
        "Q: Had they left much earlier from Germany, or --",
        "A: Germany? Yeah, they left in 19 -- they -- they left about 1937. One -- One was a\ndoctor, and the other one was a lawyer.",
        "Q: So I know that education had -- is a regret, that you have mentioned.",
        "A: Indeed.",
        "Q: Is that still true?",
        "A: Oh yes, yeah -- well, is it still true? At -- At this point, don\u2019t forget, I am what, 76.\nYou -- You don\u2019t think that much about education any more. But oh yes, obviously, it ha\n-- it had an impact on me, because if I had the education, I probably would be a dentist.\nNot that I would have, you know --",
        "Q: And after you got married, did you change your occupation, or your business?",
        "A: Yes, I did, I did. As a matter of fact, one day, and I\u2019Il tell you how I changed my\noccupation. It was -- I told you that I could always make a -- a living, and maybe even a\ngood living in a -- in the dental laboratory field, but to make money, I realized that I was\nin the wrong profession. And so one day, my wife and I, we lived in a -- in -- in New\nYork City at that time, in a fourth floor walk-up. We went to a party where there were\nfive couples, in -- plus us. And we were the only ones that came by subway because I\ndidn\u2019t have a car. All the others came by car. And I came home that night, and I sat down\nwh -- and I talked to my wife about that, and I said, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s strange. All of these\npeople can afford a car, I can\u2019t afford a car.\u201d And then I started to realize why they could\nafford a car. They were, all of them, were in the sales field. All of them. Different sales\nfield, you know. And so what did I do? The next morning, on a Sunday morning, I get up,\nI get the New York Times again, and I\u2019m looking sales. Zillions, and I mean zillions of\nads for sales help, and so on. And there were a couple of ads I cut out, and one of them\nhappened to be with an investment firm in Wall Street, and -- who were willing to train\nand then employ you. And so I went there, and they accepted me, and they trained me,\nand then you had to make sales. Well, that was very, very difficult. That was a different\nfield. Now, you\u2019re dealing strictly with American public, and it\u2019s you, by yourself, and\nyou know. So --",
        "Q: And your language by this time?",
        "A: And the language, well, my language, I -- I -- I mentioned to you in the beginning, this\nwas one of the key things for me. I wanted to speak English like an -- like an American,\nnot like -- not like Mr. Kissinger who, after 60 years, still can\u2019t speak proper English,\nalthough he\u2019s -- he is probably th -- one of the brightest people, and one of the people I\nrespect very, very much. But I didn\u2019t want to sound like Mr. Kissinger, and so I -- I paid\na lot of attention to -- to the language, and I -- you know. So, I worked for the investment\nfirm, and it got to the point, after a couple of months, where I just didn\u2019t have any --\nyou\u2019re not -- I was not on a salary, I was on commissions, and it almost got to the point\nwhere I felt I had to leave the business. So, in that -- in the meantime, we are no longer\nliving in -- in New York, we were living in Teaneck. We had bought a house for 19,000\ndollars, or 21,000 dollars, and I didn\u2019t have the down payment, so I borrowed 2,000\ndollars from my mother and 2,000 dollars from my mother-in-law, and that\u2019s how we bill\n-- bought the house in Teaneck, New Jersey, and so, after business really -- I thought I\nhad to quit, I started, in the basement of this house in Teaneck, I built -- started to build a\nlaboratory, the physical parts of a laboratory, with the benches and all of that. And then\none day --",
        "Q: Like a dental lab?",
        "A: Back -- Back into the dental lab. I had to make a living, you know. So, then one day,\nor one month I should say, all of a sudden I had a very good month. I was top salesman in\nthe company, and from that point on, I s -- became one of the top salespeople in -- in the\ncompany, which was a nationwide company.",
        "Q: What was it?",
        "A: The name of the company\u201d First Investors Corporation, at 120 Wall Street at that time.\nAnd then I was -- then I was promoted to group manager, which means I formed my own\ngroup, and then I was promoted to vice-president of the company, with an office in\nNewark, New Jersey, and another office in Morristown. That was small office, then. The\noffice in -- in Newark, I had as -- I had about close to a hundred salesmen. As fact, I had\na hundred salesmen. And everything -- And I stayed with the company for 17 years. And\nthen --",
        "Q: Wait, before we leave Newark, I -- I just -- ve heard so much about the Jewish\ncommunity, was there a large Jewish community in Newark?",
        "A: Yes, a very large community, but not --",
        "Q: But you chose not to live there?",
        "A: No, no. The Newark -- The Jewish community in Newark, the people were born there,\nbut by the time 1950 came around, they started moving out of Newark.",
        "Q: Why was that?",
        "A: Well, I assume -- I assume that Newark, th-th-the -- the population shifted, and\nsomehow, I -- I can\u2019t put my -- exactly my finger on it, but the -- the mix-up of the\npopulation shifted.",
        "Q: You mean with Blacks?",
        "A: It became a minor -- Blacks, and -- and -- and -- and so on. And it became a mu-much\nmore dangerous city to live in.",
        "Q: Do you -- Would that be around 1954, it says that was when Brown versus the Board\nof Education, the Supreme Court ends longstanding practice of separate but equal public\nschool facilities?",
        "A: Right. Right, right, right.",
        "Q: Do you remember [indecipherable]",
        "A: Th -- A-A-And don\u2019t forget, these people had children, and the -- and the educational\nsystem -- the educational system in -- in Newark was not up to standards, just like the --\nlike today, the educational system in New York City is not up to standards, and that\u2019s\nwhere we have, you know, a lot of controversy o-over that subject.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, go ahead. You -- You surely have had -- started having children now in this",
        "A: Yes, we -- well, we waited. We waited five years. And that\u2019s what you call really\nplanned parenthood. We waited five years and after five years of -- of marriage, we felt\nwe could now afford to start a family. And so we had our first son, Robert, and then, after\nth-three more years, it -- it -- it doesn\u2019t sound very romantic, I might add, but after three\nyears, we decided we -- or -- well, actually, after two years, we decided we really would\nwant another child. And -- And exactly three years later, we had another son.",
        "Q: Born the same day\u201d?",
        "A: N-No, but same month, and --",
        "Q: And your -- your children\u2019s -- children\u2019s names?",
        "A: Yes, the -- the oldest is Robert, and the younger is Peter. And -- And that made me\nvery, very happy, because you must remember, my family, the von Halle family, and I\nmentioned to you, I have a family tree that goes back to 1672, all von Halles, and here\nwe're wiped out, at least my part of the tree was completely wiped out. I am the -- I was\nthe only male surviving. And so when Robert was born -- or -- or when I got married, I --\nI felt, now there are two von Halles. And when my -- when Robert was born, we had\nthree von Halles. And when Peter was born, there was four von Halles. And --",

        "A: So now we -- we had two children. They really were -- well, of course, every parent\nsays that, but they were really great children, easy, not difficult to bring up, no problems.\nAnd --",
        "Q: What years were they born in?",
        "A: I\u2019m afraid you were going to ask that. If my wi -- If my wife were here --\nA2: I\u2019m here.",
        "A: Robert was born in --\nA2: \u00b057.",
        "A: \u00b057, and that means Peter was born in \u201960. And they were both born in March.\nAnyhow, they -- they grew up. First they lived in Teaneck, then we moved to West\nOrange, and they went to West Orange High School. And then they went -- And then we\nmoved to Short Hills, and -- and then they left the house and went to college. Robert, the\noldest, went to Northwestern.\nA2: No, he went to Duke.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. Robert went to Duke, and then later on went to Northwestern, to\ngraduate school. Peter went to Northwestern undergrad. And the only interesting thing\nabout those boys of mine, when they were about in their last year of college, Robert came\nto me and said to me, \u201cDad, I don\u2019t even know what -- what you really do for a living.\u201d I\nmean, they knew what business I was in, but they really didn\u2019t know. In the meantime I\nmight say, I -- after 17 years with the investment firm, let me just -- I\u2019m skipping around\na little bit. After 17 years with the investment firm, I decided I wanted to be in my own\nbusiness. They were very good to me, but I wanted my -- have my own business. So, in\n19 -- oh, 40 fi -- in 1954, I believe. No, it probably was later, I -- I left the firm, and I\nstarted my own business, with a -- with a partner, and the firm became known as von\nHalle - Goldman associates. And again, the beginning was very, very difficult, but I -- I\nrealized that. Every -- Every beginning 1s difficult if -- nothing -- as they say, nothing is\nfor nothing. And so I started my own business, which was in the investment business, but\nalso in the insurance business. And we -- As I said, a very tough beginning, but then we -\n- we worked, and we worked and -- and -- and we did all right. And after about five years\nwith my partner, we decided to split, even though to this very day, we\u2019re very close\nfriends. It wasn\u2019t a matter that we couldn\u2019t get along with each other, it\u2019s just that he had\ndifferent ideas about how to conduct business than I had. And -- A-And so then the firm\nbecame von Halle Associates. Now, coming back to my two sons, who were 1n college,\nthe oldest was in Duke, and he came up to me one day, and he said to me, \u201cDad, I-I really\ndon\u2019t know what -- what you are doing, you know, wh-what -- what you -- what do you\ndo all day long?\u201d I says -- He said, \u201cCan I come to your office and -- and see what you\u2019re\ndoing?\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome any -- any time.\u201d So he came down to my office, he sat\ndown, and after a half a day, he said, \u201cDad, that\u2019s a nice business of yours, but not for\nme.\u201d And out he went, never saw him again in my -- in my office, of course, you know.\nThree years later, my younger son, Peter, at Northwestern, said the same thing to me,\nbasically. He says, \u201cDad, I really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019d like to spend the day\nwith you in the office.\u201d I said, \u201cPeter, be my guest.\u201d So he comes down, and he stays all\nday, and he says, \u201cThis is a fabulous business, Dad. I like to work for you during the\nsummer.\u201d This was just, you know, when they had summer vacations. I said, \u201cPeter,\nhere\u2019s a desk, and let me tell you couple things about the business.\u201d Well, my son Peter is\nlike a sponge. You tell him something once, and you never have to tell him again. As it\nturned out, Peter, after he graduated college, he wanted to come into my business. And I\nsaid to him, \u201cPeter, you cannot come into my business until you have a job on your own.\u201d\nNow, he graduated in -- in -- in Northwestern, in Chicago, and in -- I said, \u201cYou get\nyourself a job in the industry, and after a year, we\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d So, after -- So, he got\nhimself a job, learned a great deal. After six months he calls me up, he says, \u201cDad, I want\nto come, you know, join you.\u201d I says, \u201cRemember our agreement was a year? It\u2019s only six\nmonths. Wait another six months and we\u2019|I talk about it.\u201d So, six months later, after a\nyear, he calls me, and he joined the firm. Today, my son Peter is exceedingly successful,\neven more successful than I was, and today he owns the firm. He owns the firm. I still -- I\nstill work there, you know, not -- not from nine to five, but f-from --",

        "Q: How did you know to tell him to wait a year and work somewhere else, or why did\nyou tell him?",
        "A: Why? Because I felt anybody -- I didn\u2019t want him to feel that, you know -- he had to\nunderstand what the world is all about, and what business 1s all about, and 1-1-1 -- he has\nto be knocked around, if that\u2019s what it takes. And I felt that\u2019s the way I wanted it. I didn\u2019t\nwant him to feel, \u201cWell, I work for Dad.\u201d First show that you can do it on your own, and\nthen you can come talk to me, and then we\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll see where we go.",
        "Q: Before we leave your sons, your children, I\u2019ve talked to all survivors about how and if\nand when they talked to their children about the Holocaust. Have you spoken -- From the\ntime you were young, did you speak to them, or did you feel you need -- you needed to\nprotect them?",
        "A: Y -- That\u2019s a good question. I have not spent a great deal of time talking to them about\nwhat I went through. I -- I -- I can\u2019t even give you the reason why I didn\u2019t.

And here we are, this is 1999, almost 2000. The survivors are of an\nage where they may live another five years, 10 years, or 15 years at the most, and then\neverybody is gone.

        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Now I\u2019m -- I\u2019m relating to an article that you\u2019ve just looked at in \u201cNation and World,\u201d\nthat was there April 24\", 1998, and it\u2019s a statement that Netanyahu made about the\nHolocaust, saying, \u201cThis is the lesson of the Holocaust, this and only this. That the\nexistence of the Jewish people is tied to Jewish sovereignty, and a Jewish army that rests\non the strength of Jewish faith.\u201d And I wanted to ask Mr. von Halle\u2019s opinion about this.",
        "A: Well, you must remember, we\u2019re t -- he\u2019s -- he\u2019s being quoted in conjunction with the\nHolocaust. As a Holocaust survivor, and I\u2019m quo -- I -- I talked about it ear -- early on,\nthat when we were in Europe, we were alone. There was nobody to help us. Mr.\nRoosevelt didn\u2019t think it was necessary, or prudent, or whatever reason he had, to help\nthe people in the concentration camps directly. By that I mean he didn\u2019t feel he should --\nhe could, or he should or what -- for whatever other reason, bomb the railroads tracks,\nbomb the gas chambers, and -- and etcetera. Now Mr. Netanyanu, what he is saying 1s,\nthe Jewish people, by necessity can only -- should only rely on their own strength. I\u2019ve\nbeen asked many times the question, can what has happened in Europe, can it happen in\nthe United States, and my answer has been, \u201cUnder the right circumstances. Under the\nright circumstances, it could happen here, too.\u201d What do I mean by that? If -- It all has to\ndo with economics. If the economic situation in the United States gets so bad that people\nare desperate, people always look for a scapegoat, and the scapegoat, easily, are the\nJewish people. Have been al -- through the centuries. And therefore, when Israel was\nmade into -- into existence, I felt very, very good. Why did I feel good? There is now one\ncountry that you know has your interests at heart 100 percent. And if the situation ever\ncame where you would have to leave the country, there is one country that will accept\nyou, and defend you. And how do they defend you? By armed might, if -- if need be.\nDon\u2019t forget, let me talk about, my wife came to the United States, on the steamship Saint\nLouis, not the last one, the one before the last one. The last one, there were several\nhundred German Jews, left Germany after Hitler was in power already, trying to get to\nCuba, had Cuba visas. At the last moment they -- Cuban government refused entry. Then\nthey went to Miami. We\u2019re talking again about Mr. Roosevelt. I\u2019m -- I -- As -- By now, I\nguess you know, I\u2019m not a great friend of Mr. Roosevelt. Mr. Roosevelt didn\u2019t feel 1t was\nnecessary, or for political reasons, to admit those, whatever were, three - 400 German\nJews, and sent them back to Europe. Now, if the -- if this -- if -- if there had been an\nIsrael, these -- this ship could easily have gone to Israel, and these Jews would have been\nsaved. So, when you ask me a question about what Mr. Netanyanu said -- and I\u2019m not a\nfriend, incidentally, of Mr. Netanyanu, I don\u2019t think -- I think Mr. Rabin was a much\nbetter Prime Minister, but I agree with -- with the quote, yes. And that\u2019s strictly from a\nJewish point of view.",

        "A: Well, again, a -- I\u2019m speaking as a Holocaust survivor. It -- It -- You know, ?\u2019'm\nprobably one of the proudest -- well, no, maybe -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a very, very proud\nAmerican. I -- I -- I can\u2019t tell you -- I\u2019m probably more aware of being an American than\na native born American, because of everything I went through.

        "Q: To Israel.",
        "A: Oh yes. Na -- No. A stronger tie? No, I don\u2019t want to necessarily say that. As you\nknow, Jews have very strong emotional ties to Israel, and that\u2019s probably because of the\nHolocaust. In other words, you don\u2019t have to be a Holocaust survivor to be emotionally a-\na-attuned, and -- to -- to Israel.",

My oldest son had two boys, so now\nthere are six, eight von Halles. My younger son had three boys, so now there are 11 von\nHalles.

        "A: Yes, yes. The average individual, now of course, 1t depends on whether you\u2019re\nspeaking to Jewish people or non-Jewish people, it makes a big difference, but the Jewish\npeople are pretty well aware of what -- what happened. The non-Jewish people know the\nword Holocaust, and -- but they don\u2019t really know the details. I mean, when I say they,\nnot -- you -- you can\u2019t put a blanket s -- you can\u2019t make a blanket statement, but in -- in\ngeneral, their -- their knowledge of the Holocaust is much more limited than -- obviously,\nof the Jewish people, yeah.

        "Q: And behind that belief is what? Why, why is it important to vote?",
        "A: Because the alternative is so terrible. Because if you -- if you don\u2019t vote, then you\u2019re\nleaving the decisions up to people who have an agenda which usually isn\u2019t for the benefit\no-of the whole country, because they are -- there are always people who will, you know,\nthe more extreme, and I\u2019m not saying on the right or on the left, m-more extreme, your --\nyour -- your -- your opinions are, those people will vote, and if you don\u2019t vote, your voice\nwon\u2019t be heard, and detrimental to our system.",

        "Answer: O-Okay. My father -- My father\u2019s name was Oscar von Halle. He was born in\nRustock, Germany, moved to Hamburg. He was an architect. He -- He -- He di -- He left\nGermany with our family in 1933, as soon as Hitler came to power, and stayed in -- he\nleft Germany and went to Amsterdam, Holland. We stayed in Amsterdam, Holland from\n1933, throughout the war. He didn\u2019t see the end of the war. He was arrested while we\nwere in hiding. My mother and I escaped, and he stayed in a Dutch concentration camp\nfor some time, and then was transported to Auschwitz, and died in Auschwitz. My\nmother ba -- she was born, her name was Henrietta von Halle, maiden name was Cohen,\nshe was born in Berlin. She -- After marrying my father, she moved to Hamburg. Same\nthing, in 1933, with my father, and my brother and I, moved to Amsterdam, and she\nsurvived the war, after having been in hiding for several years, and came to the United\nStates in 1946, and died here in the United States. She was a -- She was a nurse during\nWorld War One, treating German soldiers, and when she came to the United States, she\nbecame a baby nurse, took care of several important families, including Senator Javitz\u2019\nchildren, she -- she was the baby nurse for them, and died here. My brother, his name was\nHans dash Yurgen von Halle. He was born in Hamburg in 1921, moved to, with my\nfamily obviously, moved to Amsterdam in 1933, went to s -- high school -- to primary\nschool and high school there. And he was one of the very first Jews, together with me,\nwho were arrested in Amsterdam. The year was 1941, we were -- there were 250 young\nGerman Jews arrested, and underline the word German, only German Jews, between the\nages of 16 and 21.",
        "A: At that time the Germans had a system. They felt if they could get first rid of German\nJews, that wouldn\u2019t disturb the Dutch Jews too much. The one thing they didn\u2019t want is\nany kind of -- I don\u2019t want to call it an uprising, but they didn\u2019t want any trouble. And by\ntaking the German ga -- the Germans developed a system where they took one part of a\ngroup of Jews. They didn\u2019t just arrest Jews, it was always a group of Jews, it was first the\nGerman Jews, then the male -- male Jews between the ages of 16 and 21, then another\nlittle group, then another little group. There was always a group, so that everybody else\nstill felt, \u201cOh my God, thank goodness they didn\u2019t take me.\u201d And this was the German\nmode of operation, one group at a time. Then they took people who were not married. It\nwas young people if not married, then young people to a certain age, who were married.\nYou know, it was always a group of people.",
        "A: Oh yes, indeed, indeed.",
        "A: Well the -- the -- the Jews of Holland were very liberal in their -- in their -- in their\nlife, at -- it -- they -- we had perfect communication, there was no difference between the\nGerman Jews and the Dutch Jews. There was no anti-Semitism that I was aware of. I\nspoke fluently Dutch, so did my brother. And nobody ever asked, you know, where were\nyou born. We were -- We were Jews, living in Holland. As fact, we were living next door\nto Anne Frank. Anne Frank and I grew up together, and our history is almost identical.\nYo -- Which of course I have recorded previously, at the -- at the Holocaust Museum in --\nin Washington and -- etcetera.",
        "A: No, no. He was -- He was a businessman who started -- who was a successful\nbusinessman in Frankfurt. He -- He came to Holland, and to Amsterdam, and started a\nnew business, and it was in that business of his, on the princinkraft which -- where the\nfamily and some other people were hiding. It was in his business, and of course the story\nis well known, I\u2019m not going to go through that story. He was -- He was an average\nbusinessman, and the girls --",
        "A: No, no. I would not say they were -- we were friends. We were -- We knew each\nother, let\u2019s put it that way, and that\u2019s about -- don\u2019t forget the girls -- Anne was six or\nseven years younger than I was, and when I came to Amsterdam, I was 11, and Anne was\nfive. And as an 11 year old boy, you do not have too much connections with a five year\nold girl. And even though her sister was, I think, two years older, but she also was much\nyounger. So --",
        "A: How about your pre-war recollection then, of anti-Semitism?",
        "A: Well, my father -- my father worked, you might call it illegally, for a Dutch bank, was\na private ban -- it was a -- in -- in -- in Europe you have a lot of these private banks, it\u2019s\nnot like Chase-Manhattan here, or so, it was just a littl -- little private bank, it so\nhappened it was owned by a member of the family, that bank. And my mother, she took\nin people to live with us, borders. She took in borders and so, between those two, we\nmade a -- a -- just barely a living.",
        "A: No, we never felt poor. It is true that we did not have a lot of things that other people\nhad, in other words, we didn\u2019t own a car, or you know, we f-finally were able to get a\nbicycle, my brother and I, each. And -- But I never felt poor, even though I think we were\npoor, but we never felt poor.",

        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, no, that -- yes, we were hiding in a haystack, but we were on a -- my father --\nmy father, my mother and I -- that was after my brother already had been killed. We\u2019re\ntaking about the year 1942, my father, my mother and I went to a farmhouse, in the\nsouthern part of Holland, a province of Limberg, and there was a problem there, there\nwas another family that came, a Mr. and Mrs. Kahn, and Mrs. Kahn was a very attractive\nyoung lady. Her husband was an accountant, and he looked -- I don\u2019t know how those\ntwo ever got married, he was the opposite from her, and she started an affair with the\nfarmer, very -- wit -- I mean, a very silly thing to do, in -- under the circumstances, and\nthe wife of the farmer found out about it, and she -- they had children, and in her despair,\nand I can\u2019t blame her, she went to the Gestapo and told them what the problem was, and\nso one day, while we were all sitting for ouch -- we were sitting down at dinner time, I\nlook -- we looked out the window, and there were four or five Gestapo agents driving up\nand coming -- you know, running into the building. And Mr. Kahn -- Mrs. Kahn went out\nthe back door. My father went up -- went up in the attic, and my mother went into the\nbedroom and I went into a bathroom. I mean, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not a bathroom as we know it in\nAmerica, it\u2019s you know, it\u2019s just a toilet, and there was a little ledge, and I was hiding\nbehind the ledge. And they arrested my father, and they arrested Mr. Kahn, and my\nmother and I, we -- it\u2019s a long story, really, but she was hiding in a closet, and they --\nthey opened up every closet in the house and finally they -- to make a very long story\nshort, there\u2019s much more to it, but during the night, I put up a ladder against the house\nand ma -- got my mother out of the window, and then we went into a haystack, and then\nafter that, there was a young girl -- this was way past midnight -- a young girl of the\nDutch -- of the Dutch underground, sh-she probably was no more than 16 or 17 years old,\ncame on a bicycle to tell us that the -- th-the Germans were aware that they were -- that\nthey had missed two more Jews, that\u2019s my mother and I, and Mrs. Kahn for that matter,\nand so they were on their way back. So, we were in a haystack, yes, but only for about a\ncouple of hours, until the young girl came, and we had to leave there.",
        "A: No. I had no -- I did not have much experience with the Dutch underground, as a fact,\nI didn\u2019t even know who that young girl was. I found out much later, that she was a\nmember of the un -- I mean, a member of the underground, and the -- the person who had\noriginally -- was helping us, and we were hiding in his apartment before we went down to\nthe farmhouse, was a professor. I obm -- I went to college for one year, and he was one of\nthe professors --",
        "A: In Amsterdam. It\u2019s a engineering college, which I really wasn\u2019t interested in\nengineering, but my father thought I should be in -- in architecture, which I didn\u2019t want,\nand so I wound up in -- in engineering, which I didn\u2019t want either, but that\u2019s a long story.\nAnd so, I didn\u2019t know, I had no idea until much, much later, that Mr. -- that my di --\nprofessor, whose name was Mr. Initout, was a member of the Dutch underground. He\nnever told me. It was much later, towards the end of the war, and it was when we -- when\nwe fled the farmhouse, we -- we went back to Amsterdam, and back to Mr. Initout, where\nwe were originally, in his small apartment.",
        "A: Well, when I arrived in Amsterdam, I made a telephone call from that -- from the train\nstation, and told them what had happened, that my father was arrested, and -- you know,\nand he was -- he -- he was absolutely great, without giving it a minute thought, he told us\nto come right over, which wasn\u2019t so easy because, remember, we were Jews, and I -- I\nlook pretty Jewish, and we -- every Jew was supposed to wear a yellow star, which --\nwhich we wore, but not after we went into hiding. And so here we\u2019re in Amsterdam\nwithout the Jewish star, and we were not allowed to be on a -- on a -- on a -- on a bus or -\n- or tram, as they call it in Amsterdam, so we had -- we walked all the way from\nAmsterdam central, to Amsterdam west. As fact, he lived only a few blocks from where\nAnne Frank was hiding. So actually, Anne Frank, after we went into hiding, we -- known\n-- unbeknown to each other, we were very, very close to each other, in -- in distance.",
        "A: In one room. We lived in one room from 19 -- we lived in that room for two and a half\nyears. Never saw the light, never saw -- I mean, I saw light, but never saw the sunshine\ncoming, never ch --",
        "A: There was a -- There was a window, yeah, you -- you could see the light, but you were\nnever exposed to the sunshine. In other words, as you know, in this country, or in most\ncivilized countries, if you\u2019re in prison, you\u2019re allowed at least one hour a day of exercise,\nand -- and being exposed to sunlight and -- and -- and etcetera, etcetera. We have not\nbeen out of that room for two and a half years.",
        "A: Well, I can\u2019t -- The only thing -- I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know the answer to that. I know\nthat his brother-in-law knew that we were there because -- and there -- I\u2019m sure there\nwere some other people that knew about it, who he felt he could trust. But the -- the sad\npart of the story is that four weeks, or approximately four weeks before the end of the\nwar, he was caught by the Germans on one of his missions, he was on a mission, I don\u2019t\nknow wh-what his mission was, and he was caught and he was executed. And so --",
        "A: We -- There was, again, somebody from the underground who came to the house, t-to\ntell us that terrible news. His wife, incidentally, had died about a year before, but she died\nof natural causes. So I can\u2019t -- So we were just informed of it, and we had to, again, in a\nbig, big hurry, to leave -- leave the apartment.",
        "A: That was another -- Again, I can\u2019t tell -- through the underground, now, I don\u2019t know\nmuch about it, they had a -- a name and an address for us, it was another teacher and his\nwife, who I\u2019d never met, never heard their name mentioned, and that\u2019s where we spent\nthe last four weeks.",
        "A: Yeah, they were -- they had a boy and a girl. The girl was -- The boy was my age, and\nthe girl was maybe two years older.",
        "A: Well, was a very good relationship. Y-You -- You can imagine living in -- in -- you\nknow, it was a small apartment. They had -- There were three bedrooms, I believe, and\none was occupied by the -- by the parents, one was occupied by the brother and sister,\nwho had separate bedrooms, but because of -- because of us coming there, they had to\nshare the -- a bedroom, and then my mother and I shared the other bedroom, and so it\u2019s\nbeen a --",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh yes, oh yes, they were -- you know --",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yeah. Well, of course, food in th -- probably the worst part of that entire\nwar experience was the last six - nine months, where we had no food. There was no food.\nNow, you might say, how do y -- how do you exist on no food? Well, we ate what is\ncalled pulp, which is stuff that is fed to the -- to the -- to the cows. And that\u2019s what we\nate.",
        "A: Yes, yes, as fact, th-the daughter got married pretty soon after. She married a -- a\nminister, a -- a Protestant minister. And somehow over the years, we -- we lost contact\nand the son, I had brought over here, fo-for a visit, I wanted him to see America.",
        "A: Well, I -- I wanted him to see America, and so we somehow got together here in the\nUnited States for just about a week or so. And just showing him around, and --",
        "A: My goodness. I don\u2019t really remember, but 1t was probably, if I came in 1945, I would\nsay probably in 19 -- early \u201850.",
        "A: It so happened, no, I did not pay his way, he came here. He worked -- He worked for a\ncompany which had sent him over here, it\u2019s just that he had quite a bit of time on his\nhand, and it was whatever he had to do for his company, it -- 1t did not take that long, and\nso I had a lot of time that I could show him -- I wouldn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t show him America,\nbut I did show him New York. That\u2019s -- That\u2019s as far as I could go.",
        "A: Well, you know, if I had to do that, I would have to start from -- from day one, and I\ndon\u2019t think, you know, and I\u2019ve done that, an-and it\u2019s on tape, and it\u2019s in the Holocaust\nmuseum in Washington. No, I -- I -- I just would say, like I said before, that the last six -\nnine months were horrible, just horrible. I mean, again, you might say, compared to\nwhat? To the poor people who were in Auschwitz, it wasn\u2019t horrible. But I am probably\none of the few people that know what hunger is. And I's -- when I say hunger, I mean\nhunger. We talk about hunger, about poor people in -- in America. Yes, that may be so,\nbut that\u2019s not hunger. Hunger means you have nothing to eat. You c -- You can eat grass,\nor you can eat, you know, you -- you just have nothing to eat, there was nothing, nothing\nto eat. And -- And that was not just us, I mean, the Dutch people living in Amsterdam.\nAnd one of the reasons was, because Holland was -- the southern part of Holland was\nliberated already in 1944. There was one little pocket of Holland, the province of north --\nnorth Holland, which had Amsterdam, and Rotterdam, and The Hague in there, that little\npocket, it\u2019s a -- you know, it\u2019s a -- Holland is a small country altogether, but that little\npocket was not liberated. Hitler already had committed suicide, and we were still under\noccupation. The entire cun -- The entire continent of Europe was liberated, except -- I\nmean, I\u2019m only talking about days now, that little part of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and ha\n-- and -- and -- and -- and The Hague, were still under German occupation for a couple of\ndays after Hitler had committed suicide, So we were the very last one, and that\u2019s why\nthere was no food, period.",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell you the reason why, all I know 1s we were absolutely starving, starving.\nAnd so, I know what hunger 1s. I would wake up in the middle of the night -- in the\nmiddle of the night, I would wake up and -- and -- and jump up in bed, because why\u2019?\nBecause I saw a piece of bread in my dream, and that gave me a complete nightmare. So,\nyou know.",
        "A: Ok --",
        "A: Well let me -- we were -- we were liberated not by the American army, but by the\nCanadian army. Attached to the Canadian army, was a small de -- brigade, or whatever\nyou want to call it, of the Jewish brigade. We were -- Now, after having been inside a\nroom for two and a half years, and that does not include the time we spent on the farm, so\nwe were finally liberated --",
        "A: You knew it, you knew it. People were all of a sudden, you know, shouting and -- and\n-- and -- and -- and -- and -- I mean, there was just joy all over, so you knew you could\nleave. And I would leave with my mother, and truthfully, we didn\u2019t ba -- we really didn\u2019t\neven know where to go. We were just walking, and -- and all of a sudden, we saw a\nCanadian soldier. And I can\u2019t tell you the feeling that we had, after having been under\nGerman occupation, all you saw were Nazi soldiers, swastikas flying all over the place,\nand all of a sudden, for the first time in five years, we see an allied soldier in uniform. I --\nI don\u2019t think I can describe it, there is no way that I can describe the feeling. And as we\ngot closer to this Canadian soldier, I happened to see -- so I -- I went over there, and\nwanted to shake hands with him, when I saw a -- on his sleeve, the word Jewish brigade,\nwith the Jewish star. Now, if you think -- I mean, we were so enthralled by the fact that\nwe Saw a -- an allied soldier, but then, to see a Jewish soldier in a -- in a Canadian\nuniform with the -- with the Jewish star, after five years of swastikas, I -- it -- it -- it just -\n- you -- I can\u2019t describe it. And as I -- as you just said before, after having lost my father,\nafter having lost my brother, or it\u2019s in -- in reverse order, I might say, in order to keep my\nmother, you know, I never cried. But when I saw that Jewish soldier, I just -- I -- I\ncouldn\u2019t -- I -- I just broke down. I was in tears, absolutely in tears. So that was the first\nday of liberation. And -- And then, we -- we had to look for a place to live. Now, we still\n-- we had a little money, which we didn\u2019t have on us, but there was a -- one of our\nneighbors, a very lovely, elderly lady, she had some of our money, that we gave her the\nday then when we left our apartment in Amsterdam, in 1941. And -- And every penny\nthat we gave her was still there, which in itself is unusual. And we finally rented a room,\nnot an apartment, just a room, in the old neighborhood I might say.",
        "A: I haven\u2019t got the foggiest notion. And we -- we stayed there, my mother and I, in one\nroom. Well, we were used to that by now, after two and a half years. And about four\nweeks later, there was a knock on the door, and Dutch police knocked on the door, are\nyou, you know, at that time my first name was Gerd, not Gerald, or Gerry, as it is now.\n\u201cAre you Gerd von Halle?\u201d I said yes. \u201cIs -- Are you Henrietta von Halle?\u201d Yes. \u201cYou\u2019re\narrested.\u201d We were arrested again four weeks, or six weeks -- four weeks I would say,\nafter liberation. Why were we arrested? The Dutch police, after liberation, went back to\nthe old files that they had, and when we came to Amsterdam in 1933, we were German\ncitizens, and therefore, we were registered as Germans. And when the Dutch police after\nthe war, wanted to round up all the Germans, they went back to their old files, and lo and\nbehold, there are two more Germans, the von Halles. And so they arrested us, took us to a\nschool where they had put all Nazis. And here, I can\u2019t -- I mean, I don\u2019t know whether\nyou can picture that, but here we are in -- 1n -- in -- in the -- in a big room with all\nGerman Nazis. Well, thank goodness, after about six, eight, nine hours of telling -- you\nknow, negotiating with -- with the police in -- or not negotiating, there was nothing to\nnegotiate, I was just telling them who we were, and that we were not -- you know, we\nwere Jews, and so they let us go.

I mean, I -- I\u2019m not saying that these people in that room were -- executed\nmy father and my brother, but they were part of the same --",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a good question, I forgot. I did the -- I did the talking. I don\u2019t -- I -- I -- I --\nI really don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s more than 50 years ago, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember what I\ndid, but --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how I proved it, but I don\u2019t think it was that difficult.",
        "A: Well, I loved -- I loved Amsterdam. That was -- you know, I grew up there, and I -- I\nloved to spend time there, but I also realized that my future was lying in America. And\nwe had, if the war, incidentally, had broken out maybe two months later, we would have\nbeen in America, because our -- our quota number was due. We just missed it by -- by --\nby -- by a month or two.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, except the German quota was -- was terribly over -- oversubscribed,\nso to speak.",
        "A: Oh yes. That was -- We applied before the war, and -- but, you know, as I said, if -- if\nthe war had broken out two months later, we would have been in America. It didn\u2019t turn\nout that way. And what did I do? Well, my ambition -- I always wanted to be a dentist.\nNow, obviously, I didn\u2019t have the educational background, because five years of ma --\nyou know, from age -- the war broke out in 40 -- from -- from age 18 to age 23, I was\nunder German occupation. And so, those are the years when your education really --\nwhere you get your education. And I only had one year that -- it was even under German\noccupation, I had one year of that college. Thank goodness, because that\u2019s where I met\nmy -- my savior, th-the -- the teacher who saved our lives. And so -- so what I did,\nbecause obviously I couldn\u2019t go to dental college, I didn\u2019t have the background, I didn\u2019t\nhave the -- the original background for -- for colle -- for dental college, I went to a dental\nlaboratory, and although that took a few months til I got that lined up.

The -- The d -- The Dutch Merchant Marine was just about wiped out\nduring the war, and they -- the -- the Dutch government bought -- I don\u2019t know whether\nthey bought it or were given, liberty ships. And so these liberty ships wer-were supposed\nto be brought back to Holland, and so they had a troop carrier, with Dutch Merchant\nMarine sailors, who came to the United States, to pick up these ships, to take them back\nto Holland. And I was the only civilian on that -- on that troop carrier. And if you ask me\nhow I got onto that troop carrier, I haven\u2019t got the foggiest notion.",
        "A: Yes, like -- Well, she -- I knew she would -- she would come, too, so it\u2019s not a matter\nthat I wasn\u2019t going to see her. You know, I -- She came about six, seven months later.",
        "A: Because this troop carrier was -- was only men, there was no room for women, and so\nshe couldn\u2019t. And she finally came on a -- on -- by plane.",
        "A: Well, like every foreigner, America -- America\u2019s the land that is -- where the streets\nare lined with gold. Now, the reality of course, is completely different. But everybody\nthought America is, you know, that\u2019s the land where you want to be. I -- I had heard a\ngreat deal about America, and I -- I had made up my mind that when I came -- when I\ncome to America, I wanted to be an American. I didn\u2019t want for the rest of my life to be\nthe refugee who can\u2019t speak the language, or -- or who speaks it with a very heavy\naccent. The -- The one thing that I wanted more than anything else, I wanted to be\nAmerican. I wanted to be looked upon as an American. I wanted to speak like an\nAmerican, I wanted to act like an American, and that was -- so when I came to this\ncountry, I paid special attention to how people speak, and --",
        "A: Well, no, this came here mo -- in other words, when I arrived in the United States, I\narrived in Hoboken, the ship landed in Hoboken. And there was the Steven -- Steven\nWeiss, Rabbi Steven Weiss had a refugee ce -- had a -- had a Temple on the west side of\n-- on Central Park West, and he had a refugee center, I believe it was somewhere around\n67\" Street, or 69\" Street, on -- near -- near Central Park West, in New York. And, so I\nwent directly from the ship to the refugee center, and --",
        "A: At the refugee center?",
        "A: Oh, at the ship, my -- one of my uncles picked me up and took me to the refugee\ncenter.",
        "A: He lived in New York.",

        "A: No, not really. I was so -- I was so elated to be in America, that that never really\nentered my mind. So I -- So I arrived there, and -- and I -- and the f -- one of the first\nthings -- there are two things that struck me when I arrived in the United States. The first\nthing was, when I arrived in Hoboken, oh my God, it was -- there was so much dirt on the\nstreet. And coming from Holland, where they -- where they -- where they wash the\nsidewalks -- not any more, not today, but I\u2019m talking about in the -- in the 40\u2019s, th-they --\nthey -- they washed the sidewalks, and here I come to America, and -- and -- and -- and\nthe dirt is all over the place. I -- That struck me as strange. And the second thing, when I\ngot to the refugee center, there was a radio, and I had never heard a commercial in my\nlife. In -- In -- In Holland, you pay for the privilege of listening to radio, and there are no\ncommercials, only in America. And here you hear that beautiful music, and then all of a\nsudden you hear about the -- the milk commercial, and the -- and the -- and the -- and --\nand the McDonald\u2019s, or maybe McDonald\u2019s wasn\u2019t around at that time, but whatever\ncommercials they had. And that struck me as very strange. I had to get used to that, every\n-- every five minutes, a commercial.",
        "A: Well, we -- we were, as teenagers in Holland, we listened to jazz. That was my -- That\nwas my thing. My parents listened to Beethoven, and we listened to Cab Calloway, and --\nand -- and -- and -- and you know, all the other people.",
        "A: Big band. Oh yes, oh yes, we, you know.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t afford it. I couldn\u2019t afford it, but that doesn\u2019t mean I -- I couldn\u2019t listen to\nthe radio, I -- I -- you know, one of the first things I got was a radio. Television, of\ncourse, came later. And so I listened -- I listened to the big bands, and I loved it, you\nknow.",
        "A: President was Harry Truman. Harry Truman, the -- probably one of the greatest\npresidents this country ever had.",
        "A: Harry Truman, because Harry Truman, I believe, if I am not mistaken, was -- was the\npresident who had a -- a sign on his desk which said, the buck stops here. And that\u2019s --\nHarry Truman, if he saw it as -- as yellow, he called it yellow, and if it was black, he\ncalled it black, and if 1t was white, he called it white, and there was no fudging between\nblack and white, it was just the way he saw it, and that\u2019s the way he\u2019s -- did it. I -- I --\nAlthough, at the time, when he was president, I wasn\u2019t that impressed with him, but each\nyear that goes by, and that\u2019s why I said, I think he was one of the greatest presidents this\ncountry has ever had.",
        "A: He was straightforward, and he was just honest.",
        "A: Well, America, to me, at that time, stood for everything that\u2019s good in the world.

They could have, if they had wanted to, they could have been -- stayed\nout of the war, and here they -- they -- they liberated Europe, they liber -- liberated the --\nthe Far East. There may have been some self interest in this, but the fact of the matter is,\nthis was the country that stood for everything that I believed in.",

I never felt that way, and the reason why I didn\u2019t feel that\nway, 1S because Mr. Roosevelt could have, very easily, bombed the -- the -- the railroad\ntracks leading to Auschwitz and other concentration camps. He could have bombed the\novens and the gas chambers very easily. And I certainly don\u2019t want anybody to tell me,\n\u201cYeah, but if he had done that, he might have killed innocent people in the camp.\u201d That\ndoes not hold water with me, for good reasons, and I don't --",
        "A: Well, the reason is, these people were on their way to the -- to -- to -- to a gas\nchamber, and if they could -- if Mr. Roosevelt could have bombed those gas chambers,\nand if he had to do it twice or three times, and over again if they rebuilt it, so be it. So,\nmy anger, if I have any, is not -- is certainly not with America, but it\u2019s with Mr.\nRoosevelt. And that\u2019s why I -- wh-when Mr. Truman came along, he was such a breath of\nfresh air, you know.",

        "A: Haven\u2019t got the foggiest notion.",

        "A: No, it\u2019s really -- it wasn\u2019t that dramatic.

        "A: Well, let me t -- Would you like to hear the -- the day one, day one in America? So,\nhere I arrived in the -- in Rabbi Weiss\u2019s refugee center, and now I was told, before I came\nto hol -- before I came to America, that the thing you have to do, if you want to get a job\nin America, you have to buy the New York Times. And, so I arrived, I had five dollars in\nmy pocket, and I arrived at that refugee center, went to sleep the -- that night, woke up\nthe next morning, and now I needed a job, and I needed a job in a hurry. So, I\nremembered the New York Times, and I walked down from wherever it was, 67\" Street,\non Central Park West, I walked down Central Park West to 59\" Street, and there was, and\nstill is to -- to this very day, a kiosk, a -- a -- a newsstand. It\u2019s still there. And I went to\nask the man for the New York t -- oh, I saw the New York Times lying there, and it was a\nnickel. So I put down a nickel, and now I was down to four dollars and 95 cents. And I\ntook the newspaper and I went into Central Park, and I want to sit on a bench, and first of\nall, I was absolutely amazed, I couldn\u2019t believe it, the New York Times came in -- in\nfour, five, six sections. When I left Holland, in those days, right after the war, the\nnewspaper was one page. That was the newspaper. And here I come to New York, and --\nand I mean it was two inches thick. And so I took it into Central Park, sat down on a\nbench, and it took me -- it took me 20 minutes just to find out in what section of the New\nYork Times, do I find the wanted ads, the employment ads. And -- And finally I -- I did\nfind it. Now, of course, I spoke very, very little English, just a year or two what I had\nlearned in school. And -- And I tried to read it, and I couldn\u2019t find it because -- or I\ncouldn\u2019t read it because everything was abbreviated. APRX, now what does that stand\nfor? Approximately? I mean, you know, I had no idea. And so I said to myself, let me go\nto the next bench, there was a man sitting there, and I went over there, and I asked him, I\nsaid, \u201cI wonder whether you can help me?\u201d And what do you think he said? He says, \u201cI\nnot speak English.\u201d So -- So I was more or less forced to do it on my own, and I saw an\nad by Gimbel\u2019s on 34\" Street, they are no longer there today, but in those days Gimbel\u2019s\nwas down on 34\" Street. I went there, went to the employment office, and there was a -- a\nreal New York woman, a | -- I was going to say a lady, but to me she was not a lady, she\nwas a woman who said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m looking for a job.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we have -- we\u2019re looking for ri,\u201d -- this was just before Christmas, they were\nlooking for Christmas help. \u201cWe have a -- We have -- We\u2019re looking for wrappers.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cOh good, that\u2019s what I always wanted to be, a wrapper.\u201d I wanted to be a wrapper\nin -- in America. So I got a job. So they took me and put me in the -- 1n the toy\ndepartment, and I\u2019m wrapping toys like crazy, and all of a sudden, there is a hu -- I\u2019m --\nI\u2019m handling a huge doll, which was made out of porcelain. In those days, plastic wasn\u2019t\nthat popular. And I dropped it on the floor in 5,000,000 pieces and the supervisor -- su-\nsupervisor was coming -- running over, and he says, \u201cYou can\u2019t work here. Go up to the\n11\" floor, the rug department.\u201d So I was in the rug department, wrapping rugs.\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: So, here I am in the toy department of Gimbel\u2019s, and then I learned my first lesson in\nAmerica. Christmas came and went, and I\u2019m picking up my paycheck, and what is in the\npaycheck? A pink slip. It says, \u201cYour services are no longer needed. Thank you very\nmuch, and here is your check.\u201d Well, after -- after maybe a month or two in America, I\u2019m\nunemployed, and I -- you know, I -- there was no Social Security af -- as far as I was\nconcerned, and so I had to do some fast working, and I, by luck, my uncle had a dentist,\nand I wanted to go into the dental laboratory business, because that\u2019s as close to being a\ndentist as you can get. And he got me a job on 41\u201c Street, in the Herald-Tribune building,\nand there I got a job doing basically, at the bottom of the ladder, pouring casts. And I\nwanted to -- I really wanted to advance myself, and I was held back in that laboratory.\nAnd after about six months or so working in that lab, I -- I realized that I would never\nadvance there, and I wanted to learn the business, and learn it in a hurry, so there was,\nagain through connections, I found a laboratory, a one man lab, and I told him what I\nwanted, and he says, \u201cI'll tell you what. I\u2019ll let you work for me, if you pay me.\u201d Instead\nof him paying me, I had to pay him, and I was willing to do that. I had saved -- you\nknow, I worked at Gimbel\u2019s for two months, and -- and the -- and the dental laboratory\nfor six months, and so I -- you know, I had saved a couple of dollars. So I was -- I\nactually paid him for the privilege of working for him. But I learned a great deal, and I\nthen opened up my own dental lab, on --",

        "A: Yes, 236 East 82\u2122 Street. We had -- Actually, we had a -- we had two rooms, tiny,\ntiny, tiny, little rooms, one was a bedroom that just was big enough to hold a b -- a -- a\nbed, and a living room which had a couch and a -- and -- and a table, you know, and so\non. And so my mother would sleep in the bed, and I would sleep on the couch, and -- and",

Her very first job was in Cedarhurst, Long Island, I remember,\nand people loved her. She ha -- She was a lovely, lovely person, and a fabulous, fabulous\nbaby nurse. And so this doctor, who recommended her, this pediatrician who\nrecommended her to these people, when she was finished with that job, he had jobs lined\nup for her, one after another. So she hardly ever was at -- in the house, because she lived,\nobviously, with the people where she was the baby nurse.",

        "A: I would say it probably was 1940 -- yeah, the end of \u201946, probably, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yes, indeed I did. Some of my -- I made friends here. I met one couple who were\nneighbors of mine, next door neighbors from Hamburg, not from Amsterdam, from\nHamburg, where I was born. And so I became friends with them, and through them, you\nknow, and of course, all my friends were -- were -- were refugees, and -- and --",
        "A: Yeah, Rabbi Weiss, Steven Weiss, yeah.",
        "A: I, to be very honest with you, my mother came from a very religious home. Excuse\nme. She came from a -- you know, a home where they kept kosher and so on. My father\ndidn\u2019t know how to spell the word Jewish, although he w -- you know, h-he -- he was\nJewish, and -- and -- and -- and been Jewish for -- you know, I have a family tree that\ngoes back over 300 years, al -- all the von Halles, and -- and they were all Jewish. But he\ndidn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t observe anything, and so I didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t trained in -- you know, even\nthough I was Bar Mitzvahed, it was sort of by rote.",
        "A: Was not important, not important to me at that time, not til -- until after I got married,\nwhich I'll talk about.",
        "A: So -- So then I -- I -- I formed my own dental laboratory, and I ru --",
        "A: Well, first of all, I did it with a -- I did it with a partner there, one of the people that I\nmet in that first dental lab, where they wouldn\u2019t let me advance, there was a man who, he\nwas American, he -- he and I went in -- in business together. The -- The name of the\ndental lab was von Halle - Geiger Dental Lab, on Eighth Avenue. That building on\nEighth Avenue is no longer there, there is a motel there now, or whatever. And so we --\nwe were -- we were operating that lab, mostly I was operating it, he -- he was a smart\nboy, he -- he kept his -- he kept his job and did this on the side. But 1t worked out all\nright. But I -- After a couple of years, I realized that I could always make a good living in\na dental laboratory business, but the money is really on the side of the dentist. He makes\nthe money and the laboratory is -- just makes a living. And so I realized that if I wanted\nto advance in America, and make, quote, money, that was the wrong business, at least\nthe way I saw it. And so one day -- well, let me actually -- let me -- when I started the\nlaboratory business, I was single, but then I -- these people -- these friends of mine that\nlived next to me in Hamburg, came up to me one day, and said to me, \u201cGerry, how would\nyou like to have a blind date?\u201d A blind date. And I thought about it for a minute, and I\nsaid to them, \u201cI tell you quite frankly, I would prefer somebody who can see.\u201d So -- So I -\n- So they -- So I went on that blind date, and I came home that night -- we went out -- I --\nI think we went out to Yonkers, New York for -- for -- for a place to eat, and I came\nhome that night and I said to myself, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to marry that girl.\u201d I took her out\na second time, and --",
        "A: We went out, the four of us. W-We had dinner in Yonkers, and -- and -- and that was\nit, and -- and they had a car, I didn\u2019t have a car. So they drove us back and forth and, you\nknow, dropped me off. And second time I took her out, I called my mother after that, and\nI said, \u201cI met a girl and I think I\u2019m going to marry her.\u201d And her comment was, \u201cYes,\nyes, yes, yes. I -- I have heard that before.\u201d And I took her out seven times, and we got\nengaged, and that\u2019s my wife of 47 years.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how much longer she\u2019s going to keep me, but for 47 years it\u2019s been --",
        "A: Her name -- That\u2019s funny that you\u2019re asking a question like that, because her name\nwas Gerda -- I -- her name ts -- is Gerda, same as my name. G -- My name was G-e-r-d,\nher name is G-e-r-d-a, so there\u2019s Gerd and Gerda, except I changed my name when I\ncame to the United States, when I took my citizenship\u2019s [indecipherable]. I just added --\nbut -- Gerd, I added a - | in between, so that made it Gerald. And her name is Gerda, and\nher maiden name was Freudenberg. Now, I\u2019ll just tell you one little funny story there.\nWhen I got engaged, one of my friends called me up and said to me, \u201cGee, Gerry, I hear\nyou got engaged.\u201d I said yes. \u201cWell, congratulations, what\u2019s her name?\u201d \u201cHer name 1s\nGerda.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s her last name?\u201d And for the life of me, I could not remember that name\nFreudenberg. I could think of Schwartz, and Levy, and Cohen, and I could think of all the\nJewish names, but Freudenberg, I could not, fora million years could -- could I\nremember it. So anyhow, that\u2019s just an -- an aside.",
        "A: Well, my religious life changed because my wife, although my in-laws were really not\nr -- that religious either, but my wife was. Not that -- you know, she was -- she went to\nSunday school, and you know, to Friday night services with her grandmother and so on,\nnot necessarily with her parents. And so, basically, when we got married, and then -- and\nthen later on, the children came along, we -- we made sure, that is my wife made sure,\nand I followed, and -- and now we\u2019re Temple members -- we\u2019re Temple goers. Last night\nI was at a Temple, and we\u2019re -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve been members of this Temple for\n36 years, and we\u2019re regular Temple mem -- Temple goers.",

When -- When --\nDuring the war, when I lost my brother, who was my very, very best friend, and was a\ntragic thing, I -- I -- I can\u2019t even start to tell you. And then later on I lost my father. And\nthen we -- And here we\u2019re in hiding, nobody can help us. As a Jew in occ -- under\noccupation, you can\u2019t pick up the phone and dial 911, and have the police come and\nrescue you. 91 -- 911 were the Nazis at that point. And so, here you are, desperate, and\nevery day you didn\u2019t know whether you would live another day. I all of a sudden realized\nthere\u2019s only one person who -- who can probably help -- possibly help me, and that\u2019s\nGod. So I prayed to God, in whatever language it was, and so I became -- God, I -- I bel -\n- I sh -- believed in God, the first time I ever thought of God.

My father already was arrested. You don\u2019t think in those terms. Later on,\nwhen you have time to reflect upon it, that\u2019s when you start thinking in terms, not when it\nhappens.",

But oh yes, obviously, it ha\n-- it had an impact on me, because if I had the education, I probably would be a dentist.\nNot that I would have, you know --",
        "A: Yes, I did, I did. As a matter of fact, one day, and I\u2019Il tell you how I changed my\noccupation. It was -- I told you that I could always make a -- a living, and maybe even a\ngood living in a -- in the dental laboratory field, but to make money, I realized that I was\nin the wrong profession. And so one day, my wife and I, we lived in a -- in -- in New\nYork City at that time, in a fourth floor walk-up. We went to a party where there were\nfive couples, in -- plus us. And we were the only ones that came by subway because I\ndidn\u2019t have a car. All the others came by car. And I came home that night, and I sat down\nwh -- and I talked to my wife about that, and I said, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s strange. All of these\npeople can afford a car, I can\u2019t afford a car.\u201d And then I started to realize why they could\nafford a car. They were, all of them, were in the sales field. All of them. Different sales\nfield, you know. And so what did I do? The next morning, on a Sunday morning, I get up,\nI get the New York Times again, and I\u2019m looking sales. Zillions, and I mean zillions of\nads for sales help, and so on. And there were a couple of ads I cut out, and one of them\nhappened to be with an investment firm in Wall Street, and -- who were willing to train\nand then employ you. And so I went there, and they accepted me, and they trained me,\nand then you had to make sales. Well, that was very, very difficult. That was a different\nfield. Now, you\u2019re dealing strictly with American public, and it\u2019s you, by yourself, and\nyou know. So --",
        "A: And the language, well, my language, I -- I -- I mentioned to you in the beginning, this\nwas one of the key things for me. I wanted to speak English like an -- like an American,\nnot like -- not like Mr. Kissinger who, after 60 years, still can\u2019t speak proper English,\nalthough he\u2019s -- he is probably th -- one of the brightest people, and one of the people I\nrespect very, very much. But I didn\u2019t want to sound like Mr. Kissinger, and so I -- I paid\na lot of attention to -- to the language, and I -- you know. So, I worked for the investment\nfirm, and it got to the point, after a couple of months, where I just didn\u2019t have any --\nyou\u2019re not -- I was not on a salary, I was on commissions, and it almost got to the point\nwhere I felt I had to leave the business. So, in that -- in the meantime, we are no longer\nliving in -- in New York, we were living in Teaneck. We had bought a house for 19,000\ndollars, or 21,000 dollars, and I didn\u2019t have the down payment, so I borrowed 2,000\ndollars from my mother and 2,000 dollars from my mother-in-law, and that\u2019s how we bill\n-- bought the house in Teaneck, New Jersey, and so, after business really -- I thought I\nhad to quit, I started, in the basement of this house in Teaneck, I built -- started to build a\nlaboratory, the physical parts of a laboratory, with the benches and all of that.

We waited five years and after five years of -- of marriage, we felt\nwe could now afford to start a family. And so we had our first son, Robert, and then, after\nth-three more years, it -- it -- it doesn\u2019t sound very romantic, I might add, but after three\nyears, we decided we -- or -- well, actually, after two years, we decided we really would\nwant another child.

I am the -- I was\nthe only male surviving. And so when Robert was born -- or -- or when I got married, I --\nI felt, now there are two von Halles.

First they lived in Teaneck, then we moved to West\nOrange, and they went to West Orange High School. And then they went -- And then we\nmoved to Short Hills, and -- and then they left the house and went to college. Robert, the\noldest, went to Northwestern.\nA2: No, he went to Duke.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. Robert went to Duke, and then later on went to Northwestern, to\ngraduate school. Peter went to Northwestern undergrad. And the only interesting thing\nabout those boys of mine, when they were about in their last year of college, Robert came\nto me and said to me, \u201cDad, I don\u2019t even know what -- what you really do for a living.\u201d I\nmean, they knew what business I was in, but they really didn\u2019t know. In the meantime I\nmight say, I -- after 17 years with the investment firm, let me just -- I\u2019m skipping around\na little bit. After 17 years with the investment firm, I decided I wanted to be in my own\nbusiness. They were very good to me, but I wanted my -- have my own business. So, in\n19 -- oh, 40 fi -- in 1954, I believe. No, it probably was later, I -- I left the firm, and I\nstarted my own business, with a -- with a partner, and the firm became known as von\nHalle - Goldman associates. And again, the beginning was very, very difficult, but I -- I\nrealized that. Every -- Every beginning 1s difficult if -- nothing -- as they say, nothing is\nfor nothing. And so I started my own business, which was in the investment business, but\nalso in the insurance business. And we -- As I said, a very tough beginning, but then we -\n- we worked, and we worked and -- and -- and we did all right. And after about five years\nwith my partner, we decided to split, even though to this very day, we\u2019re very close\nfriends. It wasn\u2019t a matter that we couldn\u2019t get along with each other, it\u2019s just that he had\ndifferent ideas about how to conduct business than I had. And -- A-And so then the firm\nbecame von Halle Associates. Now, coming back to my two sons, who were 1n college,\nthe oldest was in Duke, and he came up to me one day, and he said to me, \u201cDad, I-I really\ndon\u2019t know what -- what you are doing, you know, wh-what -- what you -- what do you\ndo all day long?\u201d I says -- He said, \u201cCan I come to your office and -- and see what you\u2019re\ndoing?\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome any -- any time.\u201d So he came down to my office, he sat\ndown, and after a half a day, he said, \u201cDad, that\u2019s a nice business of yours, but not for\nme.\u201d And out he went, never saw him again in my -- in my office, of course, you know.\nThree years later, my younger son, Peter, at Northwestern, said the same thing to me,\nbasically. He says, \u201cDad, I really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019d like to spend the day\nwith you in the office.\u201d I said, \u201cPeter, be my guest.\u201d So he comes down, and he stays all\nday, and he says, \u201cThis is a fabulous business, Dad. I like to work for you during the\nsummer.\u201d This was just, you know, when they had summer vacations. I said, \u201cPeter,\nhere\u2019s a desk, and let me tell you couple things about the business.\u201d Well, my son Peter is\nlike a sponge. You tell him something once, and you never have to tell him again. As it\nturned out, Peter, after he graduated college, he wanted to come into my business. And I\nsaid to him, \u201cPeter, you cannot come into my business until you have a job on your own.\u201d\nNow, he graduated in -- in -- in Northwestern, in Chicago, and in -- I said, \u201cYou get\nyourself a job in the industry, and after a year, we\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d So, after -- So, he got\nhimself a job, learned a great deal. After six months he calls me up, he says, \u201cDad, I want\nto come, you know, join you.\u201d I says, \u201cRemember our agreement was a year? It\u2019s only six\nmonths. Wait another six months and we\u2019|I talk about it.\u201d So, six months later, after a\nyear, he calls me, and he joined the firm.

        "A: Well, you must remember, we\u2019re t -- he\u2019s -- he\u2019s being quoted in conjunction with the\nHolocaust. As a Holocaust survivor, and I\u2019m quo -- I -- I talked about it ear -- early on,\nthat when we were in Europe, we were alone. There was nobody to help us. Mr.\nRoosevelt didn\u2019t think it was necessary, or prudent, or whatever reason he had, to help\nthe people in the concentration camps directly. By that I mean he didn\u2019t feel he should --\nhe could, or he should or what -- for whatever other reason, bomb the railroads tracks,\nbomb the gas chambers, and -- and etcetera. Now Mr. Netanyanu, what he is saying 1s,\nthe Jewish people, by necessity can only -- should only rely on their own strength. I\u2019ve\nbeen asked many times the question, can what has happened in Europe, can it happen in\nthe United States, and my answer has been, \u201cUnder the right circumstances. Under the\nright circumstances, it could happen here, too.\u201d What do I mean by that? If -- It all has to\ndo with economics. If the economic situation in the United States gets so bad that people\nare desperate, people always look for a scapegoat, and the scapegoat, easily, are the\nJewish people. Have been al -- through the centuries. And therefore, when Israel was\nmade into -- into existence, I felt very, very good. Why did I feel good? There is now one\ncountry that you know has your interests at heart 100 percent. And if the situation ever\ncame where you would have to leave the country, there is one country that will accept\nyou, and defend you. And how do they defend you? By armed might, if -- if need be.\nDon\u2019t forget, let me talk about, my wife came to the United States, on the steamship Saint\nLouis, not the last one, the one before the last one. The last one, there were several\nhundred German Jews, left Germany after Hitler was in power already, trying to get to\nCuba, had Cuba visas. At the last moment they -- Cuban government refused entry. Then\nthey went to Miami. We\u2019re talking again about Mr. Roosevelt. I\u2019m -- I -- As -- By now, I\nguess you know, I\u2019m not a great friend of Mr. Roosevelt. Mr. Roosevelt didn\u2019t feel 1t was\nnecessary, or for political reasons, to admit those, whatever were, three - 400 German\nJews, and sent them back to Europe. Now, if the -- if this -- if -- if there had been an\nIsrael, these -- this ship could easily have gone to Israel, and these Jews would have been\nsaved. So, when you ask me a question about what Mr. Netanyanu said -- and I\u2019m not a\nfriend, incidentally, of Mr. Netanyanu, I don\u2019t think -- I think Mr. Rabin was a much\nbetter Prime Minister, but I agree with -- with the quote, yes. And that\u2019s strictly from a\nJewish point of view.",
        "A: Yes, several times. It\u2019s --",
        "A: Well, again, a -- I\u2019m speaking as a Holocaust survivor. It -- It -- You know, ?\u2019'm\nprobably one of the proudest -- well, no, maybe -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a very, very proud\nAmerican. I -- I -- I can\u2019t tell you -- I\u2019m probably more aware of being an American than\na native born American, because of everything I went through. So, \u2019'ma -- I -- ?ma\nvery, very proud American. And whenever I go on a vacation, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m out of the\ncountry, and I come back to the United States and say, \u201cAh, feels good. Feels good to be\nback.\u201d I forgot what I was going to say in the -- in the beginning.",
        "A: Oh, Israel. Now Israel, I feel -- it feels good to see a country, where everybody in\nauthority is Jewish. In other words, the policemen are Jewish, the -- the courts are Jewish,\nthe -- the -- the army is Jewish, the Air Force is Jewish, the -- the -- you know, whatever.\nAs a-- As a Holocaust survivor, makes you feel good. Now, does that mean -- now,\ncoming back to the United States then, fa -- after I\u2019m -- was in Israel, as I said, I said,\n\u2018Ah, feels good to be back in the United States.\u201d Because, this, after all, is my country.\nBut I have certain emotional ties to Israel, yes.",
        "A: To whom?",
        "A: Oh yes. Na -- No. A stronger tie? No, I don\u2019t want to necessarily say that. As you\nknow, Jews have very strong emotional ties to Israel, and that\u2019s probably because of the\nHolocaust. In other words, you don\u2019t have to be a Holocaust survivor to be emotionally a-\na-attuned, and -- to -- to Israel.",
        "A: I di -- I did -- I did see that, yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I thought it was an excellent film, but I -- y-you see, having gone through\nthis whole thing, it doesn\u2019t affect me probably as much as it would affect you or anybody\nelse, who hasn\u2019t gone through that experience. There was nothing new in that film that --\nyou know, that I hadn\u2019t ex -- either experienced, or -- or something like that.",
        "A: No, not with my friends. Well, yeah, my wife. I -- I speak with my wife about it.",
        "A: Yeah. Not on a -- you know, I\u2019m not hung up, I\u2019m -- you know, don\u2019t forget, by now,\nit\u2019s 50 years later, I\u2019m an American. And sometimes I look back on it, and it almost feels\nlike, did I really go through all of that? I -- I\u2019m -- \u2019m so Americanized that yes, I -- I --\nobviously I -- I -- as I said, there\u2019s not a day that goes by that I not think about my\nbrother. So it\u2019s not that I forgot about it, but --",
        "A: Not really.",
        "A: Not really. I have never -- I mean, you read ab -- I read it in the newspapers, of what\nhappens, you know, swastikas on a -- on a -- On a -- ON a -- On a synagogue, but\npersonally, never. Not -- Not -- Not once.",
        "A: Most of my friends are Jewish.\nM-Most of them are American born, although I have -- I have some friends who were\nborn, you know, former refugees. As a mer fact, you know, I don\u2019t know whether you\nrealize it, but actually -- and I\u2019m not saying that as a -- actually, I\u2019m not a refugee.\nActually, I\u2019m an immigrant. You can only be a refugee -- people who left Germany\nbefore the end of the war, they are refugees, they -- they fled the country. In my case --\nand I always call myself a refugee, but technically I\u2019m not a refugee, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m an\nimmigrant, because I left after the war. I didn\u2019t have to leave, I could have stayed in\nHolland. But -- I mean that\u2019s just from -- from a technical point of view. People -- People\nask me, you know, I -- I -- I always talk about it -- myself as a refugee, yeah.",
        "A: Because there was nothing left. Their f -- Their -- Their families, you know, most of\ntheir families were gone. Those who survived, they had nothing, there was no reason for\nthem to stay. And in our case, we always had wanted to co-come to America.",

        "A: 1987. So that\u2019s --",
        "A: So she\u2019s -- That\u2019s -- She -- She lived -- She lived many years here.",
        "A: Yes. Oh yes, oh yes. She -- She wa -- She knew my wife, she knew my children, and\nno, she never knew my grandchildren, no.",
        "A: Well, I was telling you that when I came over, I was one von Halle, then I married,\nthere were two von Halles, then I had two sons, we were four von Halles, and then -- then\nthe children married, so there were six von Halles. My oldest son had two boys, so now\nthere are six, eight von Halles. My younger son had three boys, so now there are 11 von\nHalles. If Mr. Hitler would know about it, that he -- that he missed this one Jew, who now\nproduced 11 others, he would be very unhappy. He would turn over.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well, when I say -- after -- we lived there for 15 years. I mean, w-we stayed\nthere six months of the year, and six months we stayed in New Jersey. But, it\u2019s funny,\nyou were just asking that, we just -- after 15 years we just sold our house, and we\u2019re now\n-- we\u2019re going to be in New Jersey year round. That doesn\u2019t mean we -- we can\u2019t go to\nArizona, you know, on vacation and -- and rent a place for -- for a month or two, you\nknow, but my -- we\u2019re no longer -- I no longer own the house since -- since last March.",
        "A: My -- My son -- well, the one that\u2019s in the business, who -- you know, my son now\nowns my business, he lived in mut -- in Ridgewood, and my other son lives in Chicago.",
        "A: Yes, yes. The average individual, now of course, 1t depends on whether you\u2019re\nspeaking to Jewish people or non-Jewish people, it makes a big difference, but the Jewish\npeople are pretty well aware of what -- what happened. The non-Jewish people know the\nword Holocaust, and -- but they don\u2019t really know the details. I mean, when I say they,\nnot -- you -- you can\u2019t put a blanket s -- you can\u2019t make a blanket statement, but in -- in\ngeneral, their -- their knowledge of the Holocaust is much more limited than -- obviously,\nof the Jewish people, yeah. No question about it.",
        "A: Not really. I -- \u2019m -- all I can say is Pm -- I\u2019m a very -- I\u2019m a very -- you know, I --\nthis is my third country. You know, I was born in Germany, I grew up in Holland, and\nI\u2019ve lived in -- in -- in the United States for now over half a century. And to me, I -- I -- I\nfeel -- I feel so proud to live in this country, and to be an American, and I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t\nbe any happier in -- in any -- in any which way. Th -- America has been great to me, has\ngiven me all the opportunities that you could ask. Yes, you have to grasp them, and you\nhave to go for them, nobody\u2019s going to put it on -- on a -- on a silver platter, but whatever\nopportunities I wanted, I -- I -- I got, and so I\u2019m grateful. And I might say to you, and I\nwill never miss an election [indecipherable], and I feel all Americans, my fellow citizens\nshould -- should -- should realize what it means to be able to go to the polls, and -- and --\nand -- and vote. I don\u2019t know whe -- I -- maybe that doesn\u2019t belong into this -- into this\ntape, but I -- I feel --",
        "A: I -- I feel very strongly about that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Very, very, very, very important. And you have to be aware of what\u2019s go -- you know,\nwe Americans have a tendency of -- when we read the newspaper, we start off with the\nsports pages, which 1s fine, I mean, there\u2019s nothing wrong with reading the sports pages,\nlong as you don\u2019t forget to read the first page, too, and know what\u2019s going on, you know,\nin the judicial system, and -- and -- and every -- everything else in political system.",
        "A: Because the alternative is so terrible. Because if you -- if you don\u2019t vote, then you\u2019re\nleaving the decisions up to people who have an agenda which usually isn\u2019t for the benefit\no-of the whole country, because they are -- there are always people who will, you know,\nthe more extreme, and I\u2019m not saying on the right or on the left, m-more extreme, your --\nyour -- your -- your opinions are, those people will vote, and if you don\u2019t vote, your voice\nwon\u2019t be heard, and detrimental to our system.",
