        "Q: You lived in an apartment.",
        "A: We lived in an apartment and the second memory is after the Anschluss and when you\u2019re a\ntoddler you\u2019re a certain height and so I remember leather boots of the Nazis and I remember\nhiding in a closet with my parents as well. I guess we were visiting and some Germans came to\nvisit, necessitating our hiding in the closet. And I remember my father holding his finger up to\nbe quiet. And the third \u2014",
        "Q: You were like three or four years old.",
        "A: I was close to four. I must have been three, three and a half at the time because we left when\nI was four. And the next memory \u2014",

        "A: Very frightening time.",
        "Q: It was dark\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 8",
        "A: Dark and, and the sounds outside the closet and the fear transmits itself to a child so you\ncould feel it. And then my last memory of Vienna 1s our getting into a taxi very hurriedly and my\nasking why isn\u2019t my grandmother coming with us. And the reason we were leaving so hurriedly\nwas that morning we had received a notice from the Nazis to report to camp. So we left quite,\nquite hurriedly in the taxi. My parent, my father had been trying to leave Vienna since 1932\nwhen he saw what was happening in Germany.",
        "Q: Even before Hitler became chancellor?",
        "A: Even before Hitler became chancellor, he watched what was happening in Germany and\nwarned the family and went to his siblings and his father and said we should leave. Let\u2019s all go\nto South America. And the family said no, it\u2019s, nothing\u2019s going to happen here. It\u2019s Germany.\nIt'll straighten itself out. We have our businesses here and our houses. And so my father\ncontinued to persist for his own family. He would go every day to the American consulate in\nVienna but there were no visas to be given at the time. And finally his uncle in Taunton, whose\nname was Moshe Greenberg, obtained a visa for only three members. He had to choose which of\nhis family should get them. And because my parents were cousins he figured this was the\ngreatest remnant of both sides that he was saving. So that\u2019s how we got the visas. And, but there\nwas no money because the Nazis had shut down my father, my parents\u2019 grocery store and there\nwas no way to earn a living except that my father secretly took apart the shelves in the grocery\nstore and made trunks for those Jews who were able to migrate.\nAnd the neighbors in the house were very fine because they didn\u2019t report us to the\nGermans. They must have heard the hammering.",
        "Q: These are non-Jewish neighbors.",
        "A: These were non-Jewish neighbors. And so that\u2019s how he was able to earn a bit of money to\nsupport us. With the store closed, there was no other way \u2014",
        "Q: Do you know when the store closed?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 9",
        "A: In 1938, right after the Anschluss yeah and I presume that after a while, even that way of\nearning a living petered out because we had no money after a while to the point that we had to\neat in the soup kitchen. And I discovered this only from the notes that Harris was able to get\nfrom the Holocaust museum which has the records apparently of the Jewish council who were\ngiven the unpleasant job in Vienna of deciding which Jews could leave and which could not.\nAnd my father, when he went to the Jewish council, said that he could support himself\nbecause his skill was as a trunk maker. That\u2019s what he had done before he opened the grocery\nstore. And he wanted to take with him in addition to his wife and daughter, his mother in law and\nhis niece, Susan. And the Jewish council because they were limited by the Nazis couldn\u2019t allow\nthe, his mother in law who was over the age limit. The age limit was 70 and she was 72 and they\ndenied also Susan coming with them.\nSo Susan escaped with her mother and father and brother Max to Belgium and from\nthere to France and they were imprisoned by Klaus Barbee. So they never made it and \u2014",
        "Q: They did not survive \u2014",
        "A: They did not survive the war. No one else did, survive, none of the brothers or sisters really\nsurvived, with the exception of one brother and I\u2019Il tell you the story of that. And so lost track of\nhow was I going to \u2014",
        "Q: You were leaving?",
        "A: Oh we left v, oh we got the notice yes. By that time once we had the visa, we had no money\nbecause of the store closure. So my father\u2019s uncle, my great uncle Moshe in Taunton, went to a\nphilanthropist by the name of Dewey Stone. And Dewey Stone was a behind the scenes\nphilanthropist and he made available $400 for us to get passage on a ship.",
        "Q: Where did Dewey Stone live?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 10",

        "Q: Partner from the haberdashery?",

        "Q: Do you remember this or?",
        "A: I remember the boat trip which was the Saturnia and but we were not in the upper decks. We\nwere in the lower level. It just \u2014",
        "Q: Did you take anything special. You\u2019re a little girl. What did you take with you?",
        "A: My parents brought several pieces of silver which I have since distributed to our children.\nAnd a feather bed. Feather, feather duvet. And the candlesticks which had been passed down\nfrom mother to daughter. I\u2019m guessing from these candlesticks. They\u2019re very heavy brass. They\nare 1860, they were passed down from mother to daughter to grand \u2014",
        "Q: Were these Shabbat candles?",
        "A: These were Shabbat candles and so those we brought with us. And very little clothing. Very\nlittle money if any. And we sailed on the Saturnia from -- does Trieste sound right.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 11",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: From Trieste then. And on board the ship were two young boys from Vienna whose parents\ncould not get visas for themselves but could get it for the boys. And so the captain of the ship\nput these boys in charge of my parents and they watched, my parents watched those, took care of\nthose boys on the trip. Harris Slater found those two boys who are now living in Florida and\nnow own nursing homes. They were met by their relatives in New York and we went on to\nTaunton, Massachusetts.",

        "Q: As a small child did you take any special toys with you. Did you bring a doll or anything?",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe I brought any special toys. I found, after my father died, I found a package that\nwas, consisted of the clothing I had when we came. It was a lovely hand embroidered dress with\na Viennese store label inside.",
        "Q: This is for a four year old.",
        "A: For a four year old. And black Mary Jane shoes. I sent those to Tammy Adoha [ph] who will\nbe the curator and some embroidery. My mother embroidered beautifully and I don\u2019t know\nwhether it as embroidery that she did or that her mother did. But it\u2019s Eastern European style and\nEastern European colors so I tend to think that it may have been her mother who embroidered it\nin the Ukraine. So those were the minimal things that we brought.",
        "Q: Any other memories of the voyage?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 12",
        "A: Only being on board that ship. My father bought an English newspaper and an English\ndictionary and on that journey which I think must have taken a week and a half or so. I don\u2019t\nremember how long it took. He taught himself English.",
        "Q: What about your mother?",
        "A: My mother spoke many languages but I think English was difficult for her but I think she\nspoke enough because when we came to this country, they both went to work in a factory to earn\na living and my mother managed to communicate in that way.",
        "Q: Do you remember docking in the United States?",
        "A: Yes, I do. And I remember Ellis Island. It was Ellis Island. I don\u2019t remember the actual\ndocking itself. One sees pictures of immigrants waving flags and looking at the Statue of Liberty\nbut I don\u2019t remember that. I do remember going through immigration and the procedures that\nwere \u2014",

        "A: We got up to Massachusetts.",
        "Q: Did anybody meet you in New York?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t believe so. It may have been HIAS. I know my parents always felt grateful to\nHIAS. And it may have been someone met us there but I truly don\u2019t remember that. Somehow\nwe got to Taunton Massachusetts where we stayed with my uncle for a week or two and then my\nfather -- he had obtained for my father a job in the US trunk company so that we could earn a\nliving when we came, because at that time we were not allowed in the country unless you could\nascertain, support yourself and that you wouldn\u2019t be a drain on the government.",

And I suspect that it had something to do with maintaining the store.\nSo we arrived in October of 1939 because in November of 1939 I turned four so that\u2019s how I\nremember.",

My uncle, my great uncle wanted my parents and me to stay\nlonger but my father felt he wanted to begin working and to be independent as soon as possible.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 15\nSo we came to Fall River Massachusetts where this trunk factory was located. And got a\ntenement first floor tenement, owned by a Polish woman who was lovely.",
        "Q: Polish Christian?",
        "A: A Polish Christian. She owned the house but she took care of me while my parents worked.\nTook me to church. I remember the incense and the going up with her to the altar. But and she\nwas a, what, what the French call a bricoleur [ph]. She made use of what there was. I\nremember sitting with her in the park and she had bought some vegetables, some carrots and I\nsuppose I was hungry at the time. She wanted to clean the carrots so she bent down, picked up a\npiece of broken glass, washed it in the fountain and scraped the carrot for me. And this was the\nvery practical way that she lived. She raised chickens. And I being a naughty four year old used\nto love to chase the chickens. Thurusta [ph] would get very angry with me that I was chasing\nhis flock but that was my early childhood there. And if we can go back to Vienna for a minute,\nId like to tell you the story of my aunt Toni who was in the resistance.\nAnd this, Toni was the child of the second wife of my paternal grandfather and his\nsecond wife. Toni was in the resistance and they lived in an apartment house where the\npostmaster and his family lived. One day there was a knock on the door and I believe this was in\n1938 or maybe toward 1939 and there was the postmaster in Gestapo uniform. And my\ngrandfather said Herr so and so you\u2019ve joined the Gestapo and the postmaster said I had to, to\nprotect my family, but \u2019've come to warn you. The Gestapo is coming for your daughter. She\nmust leave immediately. So Toni ran down the back steps, around the corner. The Gestapo were\nputting her compatriots in the resistance into the car. She escaped and was sent later by the\nRussians to a camp in Siberia. She played the mandolin there, Russian music and worked 1n the\ncamp that the Russians had sent. And one day she was walking back from work and this man\nfollowed her and he said I don\u2019t mean to frighten you but you look very familiar to me. Where\nare you from? She said Vienna. He said, what street. Yeah the same street. What number house?\nIt turned out to be Adolf, my father\u2019s eldest brother and because he had, with his siblings left the\nhouse at an early stage when the step mother came in, they hadn\u2019t recognized each other. Adolf\ntoo had been sent by the Russians to this camp. Adolf unfortunately died. Typhoid was endemic\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 16\nin the camp and he died of typhoid. Toni met her future husband there, Eli and they migrated to\nIsrael in 1948. And they lived in these primitive huts that Israel had set up and later moved to\nNazareth Elit. Eli and Toni had two children, Soshi and Jacob, named after the grandfather.\nAnd Soshi became the principal of a high school in Naharyia [ph]. Since she was the principal\nof the high school she thought her charges should see Europe and where they came from and she\ntook them to Poland. Auschwitz and visited. And then on the way they stopped in Vienna and\nthey wanted souvenirs to bring back to families in Israel. And they went into a candy store and\nwho should be the owner of the candy store, the daughter of the postmaster who had warned\nToni and his family. And so they had a marvelous reunion. I suppose that they started talking.\nWhere are you from? My mother Toni is from Vienna and the rest followed. And my aunt\nactually went from Israel to Vienna to visit Ami. Ami unfortunately died before we got to\nVienna so I didn\u2019t have a chance to meet her. So that was the amazing coincidence there. But\nlife is full of coincidences isn\u2019t it.\nSo we came to America and I enrolled in public school there. And \u2014",
        "Q: Were you able to pick up English?",
        "A: Yes, a child can pick it up fairly quickly. I couldn\u2019t pick up certain phrases, colloquialisms.\nVery difficult to absorb. And I remember the woman upstairs in the tenement showing me a\npicture of Roosevelt who was treated as an icon because there was a sheaf of grain underneath it.\nMuch the way, people put a sheaf of grain in their icons. There was a sheaf of grain under\nRoosevelt\u2019s picture and she said do you know who this is. And I don\u2019t remember whether I knew\nat the time that it was Roosevelt. And I said something or other and she said how come? And this\nphrase would not translate itself in my mind. How come. How come. And this was how I began\nto learn English with its colloquialisms. Its idioms.\nSo we lived in Vienna, in Fall River til I was 17 and I had met Harris at that time cause\nhe lived in New Bedford.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back. Start in kindergarten. How did the other children treat you? Do you have any\nmemories?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 17",

        "Q: Hand me downs.",
        "A: Hand me downs and you know yes. There we go again with idioms. Yes. I remember the\nbutcher, the kosher butcher very kindly giving me clothing. I think my mother may have refused\nit because she felt some pride and not having to take it. But I think my clothes were not fully\nAmerican style yet. And my language wasn\u2019t yet fully and my mannerisms weren\u2019t really fully,\nfully American. But I was able to make friends. And I became Americanized over time.",

I know my parents in\nthe early years of the war were sending what money they could and clothing and food to try to\nreach their parents. In Vienna. And letters that came from my mother\u2019s sister, Regina who was\nat the time in France, saying that they were being deported. And that was the last we heard. And",
        "Q: Did they share any information with you as a young child?",
        "A: No. That was a period and I think it was common among refugee families that you didn\u2019t say\nvery much to the children. It was a difficult time and lot was held back. But I do remember the\natmosphere in the house and it was, it was difficult. It was difficult. It was sad. You could sense\nthe sadness. And then my mother died at 12, when I was 12 and \u2014",
        "Q: That was 1947.",

        "Q: What were your memories when the war was over in 45? Anything special, any celebration?\nDo you have any memories of the war being over? You were ten years old.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 19",
        "A: I remember the general, the jubilation in the city, the town of Fall River. But nothing, nothing\nbeyond that of the family. I think we still hadn\u2019t known what happened at that time. The tension\nof that still prevailed in the house.",
        "Q: When did you start feeling American?",
        "A: I think in my teens, I began to feel American. I think up to that time I was still very European\nbut in my teens. I joined Young Judea which was a great help in assimilating into American\nsociety.",
        "Q: When you were here how religious were your parents when you came to Massachusetts. Did\nthey keep up observances?",
        "A: Very little, very little. I don\u2019t think they, I remember unpacking Passover dishes, Passover\ndishes and a special feeling of special foods.",
        "Q: Did you go to Hebrew school or anything?",
        "A: No, I never did because there was not money for it. When I was 12 years old, I had a friend\nwho went to temple Beth El in Fall River who did go to Hebrew school and she told me about\nthe religious school. And I decided I would like to go at age 12. Having no money, I went to see\nthe rabbi. Rabbi Rudovin [ph] was his name. And he was a very severe figure to the\ncongregation but he was the loveliest, kindest individual and he said to me if I would learn\nHebrew over the summer he would accept me and I could go gratis to Hebrew school and\ngraduate from Hebrew school.\nSo I had a book of Hebrew and that summer I sat down and learned the Hebrew print. To\nthis day I cannot read the script because I was in a hurry for the summer months to learn the\nHebrew capital letters. And so I can read the capital letters. And I read for the rabbi in September\nand he accepted me and the rest and it was lovely. I learned history which I knew a bit of what\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 20\nmy \u2014 my mother would occasionally tell me Bible stories. But I really didn\u2019t know very much\nabout history and it was at Temple Beth El Hebrew school that I learned.",
        "Q: When you were in elementary school did the other children, American children ask you about\nwhere did you come from? Did you tell them? Were you open about your background?",
        "A: Yes, you remind me of an incident because I don\u2019t think we had been in this country more\nthan a year when I went to the playground and there were two Christian children in the\nplayground. I remember I was swinging by myself and these two children came over and said do\nyou believe in the Virgin Mary? And do you believe in Jesus Christ. And having just escaped\nthe Nazis and learned to be very quiet in what I say, I said yes I do and they left me alone, saying\noh she\u2019s all right. And when I went through elementary school, I think I must have been a little\nbit different and it was largely the teachers who would say to the children that I was from\nVienna. I had escaped from the war. And I was welcomed in the classroom.",
        "Q: So the teachers were warm and welcoming.",
        "A: The teachers were welcoming. And, and warm and understanding.",

        "Q: So that\u2019s when you first started really feeling American.",
        "A: Really feeling an American. I took up the flute. Didn\u2019t play well but it was fun being in the\nband and with the band members. And Young Judea. And later at age 14, I met Harris who\nbecame my husband because it was at a Young Judea function. And I drove, I must have been\ndriven at 14 into New Bedford where he lived and that\u2019s how we met.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 21",
        "Q: Did your mother work?",
        "A: She worked in the factory, making clothing and at that time there was a shortage of workers.\nAnd since she could always sew, she was given this job. I think later that factory \u2014",
        "Q: Did she start working as soon as she came to America?",
        "A: Yes, she started working as soon as she came to America, as did my father in the trunk\nfactory. And after a few years they saved enough money to buy a house and we moved out of\nthat, it was more a blue collar neighborhood into how should I put it without sounding \u2014 into a\nmore middle class neighborhood, yes. And we lived on the first floor and rented out the upper\nfloors and in that way we could manage to live.",
        "Q: When your parents found out what happened to their relatives are there any lasting\nimpressions that you have? When they heard the sad news?",
        "A: I think my mother died before they found out but I\u2019m not sure if it was 1947 or it may have\nbeen 1946. She died before we found out what happened fully. And I think my father later found\nout that his sister Clara had died in Treblinka and I don\u2019t think he ever found out nor did we ever\nfind out what happened to his brother Benjamin who had a clock shop in Vienna. And Adolf we\nlearned had been in the Russian camp and died.",
        "Q: Any other relatives you know about, any other extended relatives, their names and what\nhappened to them?",
        "A: The other relatives died on my father\u2019s side there were some cousins that made it to America\nwho lived in America and South America also. But the immediate family was, all died in the\nHolocaust, yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 22",
        "Q: Were there other refugees in Fall River that you were friendly with, other refugee children or\nwere you the only one?",
        "A: I seemed to be the only one. That I knew of. The other Jewish children were already from\nwell-established families and \u2014",
        "Q: Did you think about Vienna?",
        "A: I think I was too young to think about Vienna and once my mother died we switched\ncompletely from German and Yiddish to speaking English so that probably helped in my feeling\nmore like an American, from 12 on.",
        "Q: So you and your dad? Your father \u2014",
        "A: Lived together. We spoke English to each other. Yes.",
        "Q: And then you went off, you went to public high school.",
        "A: Public high school and then from there went to NYU for two years and when I became\nengaged to Harris, I went to school at Boston University so that I could be near him. And then\nwe were married when I was 20 and he was 21.",
        "Q: And then where did you live after that?",
        "A: We lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts because Harris was going to MIT at the time.",
        "Q: As an undergraduate?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 23",
        "A: As an undergraduate. He finished his year and then went for his masters in mathematics and\nwe lived in student housing which had been condemned in 1940, 1940 but we lived in it in 1956\nfor $300 a month. Or 30, I added a digit. $30 a month. We managed to live in that housing. And",
        "Q: When you were a young wife, did you think about your family history, before you had\nchildren and you were just a young married couple, did you think about Vienna, did you think\nabout the war, did you think about what happened to extended family? Was that a part of your\nthought process?",
        "A: It was a part. It\u2019s, it\u2019s a part of the thought process that never leaves you but I did but as a\nyoung wife and then later a mother, I was so busy trying to raise a family in happy circumstances\nthat the children knew that family had been in Vienna and that I was from Vienna. And they\nwere aware of the circumstances of the war. But we tried to make it a happy American family.",
        "Q: Did your husband\u2019s family, were any of them survivors?",
        "A: Yes. His grandfather came in 1890 from Lithuania and settled at an early time in New\nBedford, Massachusetts where he had a peddler\u2019s cart. And it\u2019s very interesting that New\nBedford had quite a large ethnic group, partly because it had been a whaling town and so people\nof many ethnicities came, including Japanese. And so Harris\u2019 grandfather\u2019s picture is in the New\nBedford whaling museum, along with the other ethnic groups. The Italians, Scots, the Japanese.\nIt\u2019s a lovely little memento of New Bedford\u2019s town.",
        "Q: Did he have any extended family who didn\u2019t leave Europe and did not survive the Shoah.",
        "A: Not that learned of til many years later that just about five years later when we went to\nLithuania on a trip and he learned that there were some distant relatives. But most of his\nextended family and his mother, his grandmother had 11 children, lived in New Bedford so it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 24\nwas a very close knit family and it was an unusual thing for me to go from no family at all to this\ngreat extended family. So that was \u2014",
        "Q: You finished in Cambridge and then what?",
        "A: Then we moved to New York because Harris got his master\u2019s in math and decided that he\nwould like to be a lawyer. There were seven lawyers in his family. So I guess it was in the DNA\nand he was accepted at Harvard. He was told if he would wait a year. But we were 26 at the time\nand needed to get going rapidly in our lives. And so he was accepted at Columbia. I got a\nteaching job in New York after and in Massachusetts I worked as a training instructor, John\nHancock insurance company.\nBut we left Cambridge and moved to New York. We had an old Nash at the time and we\nloaded our meagre belongings on it, including a mattress on top of the roof of the car and the\nsticker said MIT on the Nash and it was quite another transition to make. And I remember saying\nto Harris. Do you know what MIT stands for - madhouse in transit.\nBut we moved into New York into an apartment and I got a job teaching public school,\nPS141 and Harris was at law school.",
        "Q: A full time student?",
        "A: Full time student.",
        "Q: And no children yet?",
        "A: No children yet. In my third year of teaching I became pregnant with our daughter and the\nprincipal of the school very kindly kept me on til the end of the year. He was a lovely man, Mr.\nRobinson. I have never forgotten him. The vice principal was a very staid prim spinster and\nwhose brother was the bishop of I believe it was New York. And at the time the Christian school\nchildren were dismissed from school for religious school. The Jewish children waited til the end\nof the school. The dictum came down from the board of education that children were no longer\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 25\nto be dismissed early. I had a student in my class named James who was used to be dismissed for\nChristian class. He came up to me and said Mrs. Weinstein I have to leave. And I said terribly\nsorry James. The ruling from the board of education says you need to stay til the end of the\nschool day.\nHe came back the next week and said Mrs. Weinstein I need to leave and my priest says\nthat if you don\u2019t let me go that he will report you to the bishop. I went town to Ms. Flannery his\nsister, the vice principal and I said Ms. Flannery you are going to get a very bad report about me\nfrom your brother and I need to tell you about this. It was the only time in the entire time that I\nworked in that school that I saw her laugh. And she said don\u2019t worry about a thing. I will take\ncare of it. And from then on poor James never came up to me.\nBut I felt very badly because I was a Jew telling him that he couldn\u2019t be excused but I\nhad to follow the ruling of the school board.",

        "Q: As your father aged, did you talk about his losses and what \u2014",
        "A: He didn\u2019t talk about his losses. He was a stoic in that way. But he did, he did tell us and I told\nthe children and he told the children and he would tell people how he had very early on in 1932\ndetected what was going to happen. And at the last stage of our being in Vienna, before we got\nthe visa and when he was continually denied the visa from the American consulate, he was\nprepared to walk us over the mountains to Switzerland. But fortunately that visa finally came\nthrough. Yeah.",
        "Q: You\u2019re in New York and you finished your three years. You got pregnant you say.",
        "A: And Harris got a job clerking for judge Hasty in Philadelphia. He was a lovely man and we\nmoved to Philadelphia, to Elkins Park. And when our daughter was born Harris went to the\nsynagogue there in Elkins Park which was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and if you go to the\nmuseum of the Diaspora in Tel Aviv there is model of the Frank Lloyd Wright. It\u2019s a beautiful,\nyou \u2019ve seen it.\nAnd we lived there a year. And moved from there to Washington when Harris got a job\nat the law firm here.",
        "Q: And he joined a law firm in Washington.",

        "A: Yes, we had our daughter in Philadelphia and then in Washington we had our son Josh who is\nnamed after Harris\u2019 grandfather Moses Joshua Weinstein. And then we had Jacob who was\nnamed after my grandfather. And so he and my cousin in Israel have the same name. And it\u2019s\nJacob Solomon Weinstein.\nI remember one of Harris\u2019 cousins, who lived at the time in Washington went on, his son\nwas named. He said are you going to give him boxing gloves cause he\u2019s going to need it with\nthat name.",

        "A: Oh yes. I remember my father saying he was on a trolley and this was years after we came\nand someone asked him directions and my father gave him directions and he said I feel like an\nAmerican. And I feel the same way. America has given us this opportunity to live and I have\nthis feeling of gratitude and this is why I so much enjoy the work I\u2019m doing now which is\nteaching 1n nursing and retirement homes. We began a program 22 years ago which is now\ncalled the Himmelfarb mobile university which goes to senior sites. It runs the spectrum from\nretirement homes, senior centers to nursing homes and Alzheimer\u2019s units. And we are a group of\nteachers that bring classes to these homes so people\u2019s minds stay active. And I particularly love\ngoing to the army, the service homes. And the merchant marine, and navy and coast guard\nbecause when I go there to people who served their country I feel like I\u2019m serving the country\ntoo.\nSo yes, I feel like an American now.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 28",
        "Q: Did you have any additional education besides your undergraduate degree?",
        "A: I went back after, after our children were grown, I went back for a master\u2019s degree in liberal\narts at Georgetown University and was lucky to have some fantastic teachers, including Jesuits\nwho are masterful teachers. And I learned about anthropology because up to that time I had a\nbusiness education which stood me in very good stead at John Hancock as a teacher there. But I\nfelt my education was very limited. And by earning this master\u2019s degree it opened up a vast\nhorizon. And that\u2019s actually the subject I now teach in these nursing homes is anthropology\nitself. So Georgetown gave me that opportunity.",
        "Q: And any more education after the masters or \u2014",

        "Q: In what field?",
        "A: Anthropology, in anthropology.",
        "Q: When your children were your age when you were so little and the Anschluss happened,\nwhen they were three, four, five did it bring, did it resonate with you? Did it bring back\nmemories of what you went through as a child?",
        "A: Yes, yes it did.",
        "Q: German boots and things like that.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 29",
        "A: Yes, yes it did. I wanted to protect them from that but they needed to know that on a very\nmild superficial scale that there\u2019s evil in the world and that one has to be watchful and careful.\nBut not, not to an extent where they would become fearful or psychologically bothered by it.",
        "Q: Are there any sounds today, or sights that kind of remind you of the difficult time you went\nthrough before you left Austria?",
        "A: Yes. I\u2019m trying to think what sights and sounds they are but they do evoke, do evoke a\nmemory. Marching sounds do, do that. Boots do that. Even, even when state troopers wear\ntheir boots, it gives, I have to analyze why I have an uneasy feeling. And then I realize why and\ndismiss it cause it goes, cause this is America.",
        "Q: Do dogs bother you?",

        "A: Yes it did and I remember hearing a broadcast after we arrived in Massachusetts. And there\nwas a radio show where someone talked of meeting Hitler and I suppose I was five at the time.\nAnd I remember this person saying Hitler kissed her hand in a European manner. And I\nremember saying hunh, if I knew Hitler was going to do that and I met him, I\u2019d put poison on my\nhand. And that, that\u2019s the, but certainly Hitler was a known name in our household.",

        "A: No, no. I have guilt I think that I managed to escape and others didn\u2019t. But I think that\u2019s an\nintegral part of what many refugees feel, but no, no. I am not angry that, that\u2019s their life and\nthey\u2019re entitled to their life. So there\u2019s no anger there.\nThere\u2019s anger at ignorance, at revisionists who will deny that the Holocaust or ignorance\nof it which I feel is a worrisome thing but you and the Holocaust Museum are preventing that\nhopefully. But anger at children who didn\u2019t have, no not at all.",
        "Q: Did you lose a part of your childhood?",
        "A: Yes that\u2019s a good question. I think I did. I think I did. But then again it doesn\u2019t hurt to lose a\npart of a childhood. You just mature at an earlier age. And you end up in having a certain\nempathy for humanity, whoever they may be. So it\u2019s not a lost childhood in that sense. You gain\nby it. Also by being stronger. You \u2014 I realize later what I do is what the Japanese call bushido,\nthe warrior, the samurai will distance themselves from the emotion of the time so that they could\nfight. They would distance themselves from fear, anger and simply concentrate on what they\nhave been trained to do and I find myself doing that in difficult situations. I set myself apart\nfrom it, don\u2019t allow myself to feel the emotion so that I can go through what has to be done.\nAnd that I think is part of my being a refugee from those times. So that\u2019s what I mean\nthat it doesn\u2019t hurt. It helps.",
        "Q: Gave you skills that you ordinarily wouldn\u2019t have had if you were born here?",
        "A: Right, it gives you an outlook and an inner and outer strength. Inside may be turmoil but you\ndon\u2019t allow it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 31",
        "Q: Well that was going to be a question I was going to ask you. Are you two different people \u2014\nsomeone on the inside and another person on the outside.",
        "A: I think I\u2019m a unified whole, but Pve learned to control so if there\u2019s anger at a situation it\u2019s not\nanything to do with the Holocaust. But if there\u2019s anger in a situation I\u2019ve learned to cover it up so\nthat I can go ahead with what needs to be done, so there may be anger but I don\u2019t show it. Or\nthere may be sadness and I don\u2019t, try not to show it in that sense. But does your question mean,\nam I in turmoil because of the two cultures that I\u2019m straddling?",
        "Q: Yeah and the fact that you had to escape with your parents.",
        "A: Well I count myself fortunate that I was able to escape and badly that there were others who\ndidn\u2019t. But we managed to escape and unfortunately others didn\u2019t. So there\u2019s no elation over it.\nThere are no extremes of feeling over it. Simply an acceptance. It is what it is.",
        "Q: Are you more comfortable around people who were refugees like you than people who were\nborn in the United States?",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. Let me.",
        "Q: Do you feel a connection to someone who \u2014",
        "A: Well here I think I straddle two cultures again. For someone who\u2019s European I do feel a\ncertain connection. I think there\u2019s a certain behavior pattern of Europeans that isn\u2019t American\nand yet there\u2019s a certain behavior pattern in Americans that isn\u2019t in European so you simply\nstraddle the two cultures and it\u2019s not that you\u2019re a chameleon. You take on the coloration. It\u2019s\nsimply you have a certain empathy with these different cultures.",
        "Q: Comfortable with others who also came from Europe like you did.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 32",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about Israel?",
        "A: Well I\u2019ve always been pro-Zionist and certainly my belonging to Young Judea fostered,\nfostered that. I feel it\u2019s crucial that we have an Israel because with our nomenclature of the\nwandering Jew hopefully this ends that period and I fully believe that the full extent of the\nHolocaust would not have happened had we an Israel. A homeless, stateless people is a very\nvulnerable people. And I remember reading about Hitler and the Armenians and when the\nArmenian, no one really came to the Armenian aid and Hitler said the world didn\u2019t watch out for\nthe Armenians, therefore we can do the same with the Jews. So I feel that Israel is an essential\nabsolute necessity.",
        "Q: Have you been back to Vienna?",
        "A: We\u2019ve been back now five years in a row. This will be the spring, next spring will be the fifth\nyear in a row. I didn\u2019t go back \u2014",
        "Q: In other words, you go back every year.",
        "A: Because Harris mentors his group of students at Catholic University and they go into this\narbitration debating that meets in Vienna so that\u2019s how we get back there each year. Otherwise \u2014",
        "Q: Had you been back before, that was your first time back?",
        "A: Back in 72 years.",
        "Q: What was your reaction? Did you have memories?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 33",
        "A: It was like walking on a moving sidewalk. Because it was not a secure feeling. But yet it had\nbeen home and so it was a strange feeling. It is such a beautiful city and such a monumental city\nthat after a while I began to feel at home again. We found a wonderful Polish driver who\nchauffeured us to the places, the house where I had lived in, that apartment house.",
        "Q: This was a Polish driver.",
        "A: This was a Polish driver. Lovely man, lovely man.",
        "Q: A Polish driver in Austria.",
        "A: A Polish driver in Austria. And he took us all around to the places our parents store had been.\nThat was in a courtyard and the building had a plaque on it. The Viennese love to put plaques on\nbuildings and the allies apparently didn\u2019t bomb Vienna til rather late in the war so the building\nhad a plaque on it, said this was bombed by the allies in 1943. It was 1944. And then you went\nthrough a little gate and there was a courtyard that is now and where my parents\u2019 store had been\nis now a garage. But I recognized, I felt the feeling, a memory of the courtyard.\nAnd then he, the Polish driver took us to the apartment house. Couldn\u2019t\u2019 find it. We\ndrove around and around and he finally had the wonderful idea to ask a postman and he said oh\nyes, that building there had been 29 Heligestadt strasse. It was a new modern building. Jacob our\nolder son, our younger son who lives in London had gone to Vienna several years before and\ngone to that house. And taken a picture of it.",
        "Q: Before it was knocked down.",
        "A: Before it was knocked down. It was a lovely old stone building. We had an apartment in it.\nBut that had been knocked down to make way for a clinic. And we went into the clinic and I\nwanted to ascertain that was the building and because it was a long line of ill people, I didn\u2019t\nwant to break into that line. So I went to an office where there was no one and I said in my poor\nGerman, excuse me can I have a question. And they looked up and said get into line. And I said\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 34\nbut I\u2019m a tourist. I have only a question. Get into line. So we went out of the building and waited\ntil a person with a friendly face came out and then in our bad German, my bad German said can\nyou tell us how old this is. And she said oh it was two years old. So that fit. So it was a perfect\nsite for a medical clinic because Ubahn, the fantastic system, rail system that they have was just\na door or two down, so people could make it easily.\nWe went back. We found the house where my grandfather had lived and my aunt Toni\nwhich is now in a heavily Muslim building. A man there very kindly asked if we wanted to come\ninside but we didn\u2019t. we didn\u2019t want to intrude. We didn\u2019t know what apartment it was. So and\nthen we had another driver, a fellow from Turkey who took us to the Friedhoff which is the\ncemetery where my grandmother, Rosa is buried. This is my maternal grandmother who died in\nthe flu epidemic. And we tried find her grave in the Jewish section. Could not. The Turkish\ndriver was marvelous. He ran up and down the rows trying to find them. Til we finally had to say\nwe're afraid we have to get to the airport now. We need to stop but he was willing to try. He\nworked very hard. He was lovely.\nIn contrast, I had a taxi driver from Vienna and well shall I tell you this story. He was\nvery angry that he had to drive me to the Marriott which was the edge of Vienna from the center\nof Vienna and he, I guess from my poor German he understood that I had been there before. And\nI said yes I was born there. He said why did you leave Austria? It\u2019s a wonderful country. And I\nthought ach, if I have to explain. There 1s no sense in it. But that was my meeting with the\nAustrian driver. So it was, we have been back several times since. And I\u2019ve gone to the\nwonderful museums. And gives me a chance to practice my poor German, although invariably\nwhen I speak German the Viennese break into English. Show you how bad my German must be.\nBut I try to practice it before we leave so that I can at least get us about Vienna.",
        "Q: Did you take German in high school?",
        "A: I did. I took a little bit of German in addition to French. And it was an easy class for me\nbecause of it. And Yiddish of course stands you in very good stead as a dialect.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 35",
        "Q: Because you and your family were deprived of your civil rights in Austria, were you when\nyou were an adult active in any of the civil rights movements or movement here in the United\nStates? I know you had young children.",
        "A: Well we campaigned for gun control and when Martin Luther King was assassinated we and\nsome friends went to the capitol to distribute gun control pamphlets. I actually had the pamphlets\nknocked out of my hand by a man who said, what are you a commie? But we continued to work\nfor gun control. Hasn\u2019t worked very well. But we worked on that.\nAnd our daughter was, when we lived in Crestwood, our daughter wanted to enroll in a\nBrownie troop and we went to the local Baptist church where she was a member of the scout\ntroop. Unfortunately she was not made welcome. She was the only white child there and it made\nvery clear that she was not welcome. And we, after a year of trying to participate, we left.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?",
        "A: Well it was interesting to watch these trials. I was very happy that he was caught. We support\nthe center, the Wiesenthal center in Los Angeles and it was a painful trial but a very necessary\none because as the Holocaust deniers come out, as the Holocaust survivors die off, without your\ngood work and the Holocaust like this, there is a danger that the world will forget. I was very\nglad that this trial was brought to bear.",
        "Q: Have your children been affected by the fact that their mother escaped from Hitler?",
        "A: They are sensitive to it. They are sensitive to it. We never emphasize that but they know\nfrom history from our history and so they are very sensitive to it. Our older daughter in\nparticular because she 1s the first child. But the boys are quite sensitive to it also, quite sensitive\nas are our grandchildren. I think they are being taught about the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Do the older ones ask you about what you went through as a young child?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 36",
        "A: (pause) Not too much, not too much. I think they see certain habits which come from being\nhungry as a child. I cannot throw food away and they see that in me. Food cannot be wasted.",
        "Q: And they know why.",
        "A: And they know why because I explain why.",
        "Q: You know what it\u2019s like to be hungry.",
        "A: What it\u2019s like to be hungry. So I think they understand.",
        "Q: They intuit it.",
        "A: Yes, yes. In addition I do try to explain in a fairly light way. Also a degree of watchfulness 1s\nsomething else that I try to instill in them. You know Jefferson said that evil can prevail if\nenough good people don\u2019t do anything and I want them to be alert to anti-Semitism, to wrongs\ndone to any group. Everybody\u2019s got a responsibility to watch for that. But it\u2019s hard. When you\ngrow up in comfortable circumstances it\u2019s hard to imagine it. So we\u2019re a generation already\nremoved from that. So it\u2019s hard to inculcate that in a way but you do what you can when the\nmoment comes, without hammering it in.",
        "Q: Were you over protective when you were raising your children?",
        "A: Yes I think I tended to be overprotective and that\u2019s another common thing I think that that\nrefugees have.",
        "Q: That something can happen.",
        "A: That something can happen any moment. You know I read a poet, I wish I remember his\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 37\nname, from Israel. He said every Jew is born with a knife in his heart. Of course he was talking\nabout Isaac and Abraham and Isaac and the sacrifice that didn\u2019t take place but I think every Jew\nfeels that and so you worry that your children \u2014 and then it extends even to your grandchildren. It\nnever ends yeah.\nBut then you don\u2019t\u2019 have to be a refugee to worry about your children I think. A Jewish\nmother, an Italian can be a Jewish mother as well.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about the, has the world learned anything from the Holocaust.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure the world has learned enough. This is the concern. This is the best, why do things\nlike Sudan or Ethiopia, Syria. I don\u2019t\u2019 think the world learns. It\u2019s a part of our survival\ntechnique as human beings I think. We are able to what\u2019s the word categorize, compartmentalize\nthank you. That\u2019s it exactly. We compartmentalize and so we take note of evil when it happens\nbut then we are so busy trying to live that we put it aside. But I think the world needs to\ncontinue, it needs to be reminded, needs to be reminded. Continually.",
        "Q: How do you feel about the Holocaust museum being in Washington, DC?",
        "A: Excellent, excellent.",
        "Q: In the United States, even though the war did not take place in the United States.",
        "A: It is the place. It\u2019s the nation\u2019s capital. People come from all over and they need to come and\nthey need to know. I vividly remember when we went to Krakow. Harris was teaching a class\nthere. And the Jagiolian, Jagiellolian, it\u2019s named after Jagiello the king of Poland and he\nestablished a law school there. And we\u2019ve been there several times for Harris to teach. And of\ncourse Auschwitz is, I have not been, is a half hour to an hour away from Krakow. And I\nremember one morning seeing two couples from England, Christians going to Auschwitz. They\nwere laughing. They didn\u2019t know what they were going to see. I think they were probably going\nto see the salt mines which are an interesting thing to see also. And they were laughing and gay.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 38\nThey came back utterly drained and gray. And I said to myself, I know just where you\u2019ve been.\nAnd I think the world needs to see the Holocaust Museum so they know where the world has\nbeen. So I am thoroughly in favor of it. I\u2019m rather glad to see it, never mind rather. I am glad to\nsee that there are Holocaust museums throughout the country and in Europe as well. A needed\nreminder, the needed reminder to the world.",
        "Q: Is there any message you wanted to leave to your grandchildren during this interview,\nanything you wanted to say to them.",
        "A: Stay alert and stay human. I think they\u2019re nice human beings to begin with but they should\nremember their menschkeit, their humanity, that they are a part of the human race. And they\u2019re\nnot just Jews or Christians or Arabs, but humans, and we\u2019ve all evolved from the same source so\nstay human.",
        "Q: Anything else you wanted to add before we close.",

        "A: We lived in an apartment and the second memory is after the Anschluss and when you\u2019re a\ntoddler you\u2019re a certain height and so I remember leather boots of the Nazis and I remember\nhiding in a closet with my parents as well. I guess we were visiting and some Germans came to\nvisit, necessitating our hiding in the closet. And I remember my father holding his finger up to\nbe quiet. And the third \u2014",

        "A: Dark and, and the sounds outside the closet and the fear transmits itself to a child so you\ncould feel it. And then my last memory of Vienna 1s our getting into a taxi very hurriedly and my\nasking why isn\u2019t my grandmother coming with us. And the reason we were leaving so hurriedly\nwas that morning we had received a notice from the Nazis to report to camp. So we left quite,\nquite hurriedly in the taxi. My parent, my father had been trying to leave Vienna since 1932\nwhen he saw what was happening in Germany.",
        "A: Even before Hitler became chancellor, he watched what was happening in Germany and\nwarned the family and went to his siblings and his father and said we should leave. Let\u2019s all go\nto South America. And the family said no, it\u2019s, nothing\u2019s going to happen here. It\u2019s Germany.\nIt'll straighten itself out. We have our businesses here and our houses. And so my father\ncontinued to persist for his own family. He would go every day to the American consulate in\nVienna but there were no visas to be given at the time. And finally his uncle in Taunton, whose\nname was Moshe Greenberg, obtained a visa for only three members. He had to choose which of\nhis family should get them. And because my parents were cousins he figured this was the\ngreatest remnant of both sides that he was saving. So that\u2019s how we got the visas. And, but there\nwas no money because the Nazis had shut down my father, my parents\u2019 grocery store and there\nwas no way to earn a living except that my father secretly took apart the shelves in the grocery\nstore and made trunks for those Jews who were able to migrate.\nAnd the neighbors in the house were very fine because they didn\u2019t report us to the\nGermans. They must have heard the hammering.",
        "A: These were non-Jewish neighbors. And so that\u2019s how he was able to earn a bit of money to\nsupport us. With the store closed, there was no other way \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 9",
        "A: In 1938, right after the Anschluss yeah and I presume that after a while, even that way of\nearning a living petered out because we had no money after a while to the point that we had to\neat in the soup kitchen. And I discovered this only from the notes that Harris was able to get\nfrom the Holocaust museum which has the records apparently of the Jewish council who were\ngiven the unpleasant job in Vienna of deciding which Jews could leave and which could not.\nAnd my father, when he went to the Jewish council, said that he could support himself\nbecause his skill was as a trunk maker. That\u2019s what he had done before he opened the grocery\nstore. And he wanted to take with him in addition to his wife and daughter, his mother in law and\nhis niece, Susan. And the Jewish council because they were limited by the Nazis couldn\u2019t allow\nthe, his mother in law who was over the age limit. The age limit was 70 and she was 72 and they\ndenied also Susan coming with them.\nSo Susan escaped with her mother and father and brother Max to Belgium and from\nthere to France and they were imprisoned by Klaus Barbee. So they never made it and \u2014",
        "A: They did not survive the war. No one else did, survive, none of the brothers or sisters really\nsurvived, with the exception of one brother and I\u2019Il tell you the story of that. And so lost track of\nhow was I going to \u2014",
        "A: Oh we left v, oh we got the notice yes. By that time once we had the visa, we had no money\nbecause of the store closure. So my father\u2019s uncle, my great uncle Moshe in Taunton, went to a\nphilanthropist by the name of Dewey Stone. And Dewey Stone was a behind the scenes\nphilanthropist and he made available $400 for us to get passage on a ship.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 10",

They\nare 1860, they were passed down from mother to daughter to grand \u2014",

        "A: From Trieste then. And on board the ship were two young boys from Vienna whose parents\ncould not get visas for themselves but could get it for the boys. And so the captain of the ship\nput these boys in charge of my parents and they watched, my parents watched those, took care of\nthose boys on the trip. Harris Slater found those two boys who are now living in Florida and\nnow own nursing homes. They were met by their relatives in New York and we went on to\nTaunton, Massachusetts.",

My mother embroidered beautifully and I don\u2019t know\nwhether it as embroidery that she did or that her mother did. But it\u2019s Eastern European style and\nEastern European colors so I tend to think that it may have been her mother who embroidered it\nin the Ukraine.

Somehow\nwe got to Taunton Massachusetts where we stayed with my uncle for a week or two and then my\nfather -- he had obtained for my father a job in the US trunk company so that we could earn a\nliving when we came, because at that time we were not allowed in the country unless you could\nascertain, support yourself and that you wouldn\u2019t be a drain on the government.",

My uncle, my great uncle wanted my parents and me to stay\nlonger but my father felt he wanted to begin working and to be independent as soon as possible.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 15\nSo we came to Fall River Massachusetts where this trunk factory was located. And got a\ntenement first floor tenement, owned by a Polish woman who was lovely.",
        "A: A Polish Christian. She owned the house but she took care of me while my parents worked.\nTook me to church. I remember the incense and the going up with her to the altar. But and she\nwas a, what, what the French call a bricoleur [ph]. She made use of what there was. I\nremember sitting with her in the park and she had bought some vegetables, some carrots and I\nsuppose I was hungry at the time. She wanted to clean the carrots so she bent down, picked up a\npiece of broken glass, washed it in the fountain and scraped the carrot for me. And this was the\nvery practical way that she lived. She raised chickens. And I being a naughty four year old used\nto love to chase the chickens. Thurusta [ph] would get very angry with me that I was chasing\nhis flock but that was my early childhood there. And if we can go back to Vienna for a minute,\nId like to tell you the story of my aunt Toni who was in the resistance.\nAnd this, Toni was the child of the second wife of my paternal grandfather and his\nsecond wife. Toni was in the resistance and they lived in an apartment house where the\npostmaster and his family lived. One day there was a knock on the door and I believe this was in\n1938 or maybe toward 1939 and there was the postmaster in Gestapo uniform. And my\ngrandfather said Herr so and so you\u2019ve joined the Gestapo and the postmaster said I had to, to\nprotect my family, but \u2019've come to warn you. The Gestapo is coming for your daughter. She\nmust leave immediately. So Toni ran down the back steps, around the corner. The Gestapo were\nputting her compatriots in the resistance into the car. She escaped and was sent later by the\nRussians to a camp in Siberia. She played the mandolin there, Russian music and worked 1n the\ncamp that the Russians had sent. And one day she was walking back from work and this man\nfollowed her and he said I don\u2019t mean to frighten you but you look very familiar to me. Where\nare you from? She said Vienna. He said, what street. Yeah the same street. What number house?\nIt turned out to be Adolf, my father\u2019s eldest brother and because he had, with his siblings left the\nhouse at an early stage when the step mother came in, they hadn\u2019t recognized each other. Adolf\ntoo had been sent by the Russians to this camp. Adolf unfortunately died. Typhoid was endemic\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 16\nin the camp and he died of typhoid. Toni met her future husband there, Eli and they migrated to\nIsrael in 1948. And they lived in these primitive huts that Israel had set up and later moved to\nNazareth Elit. Eli and Toni had two children, Soshi and Jacob, named after the grandfather.\nAnd Soshi became the principal of a high school in Naharyia [ph]. Since she was the principal\nof the high school she thought her charges should see Europe and where they came from and she\ntook them to Poland. Auschwitz and visited. And then on the way they stopped in Vienna and\nthey wanted souvenirs to bring back to families in Israel. And they went into a candy store and\nwho should be the owner of the candy store, the daughter of the postmaster who had warned\nToni and his family. And so they had a marvelous reunion. I suppose that they started talking.\nWhere are you from? My mother Toni is from Vienna and the rest followed. And my aunt\nactually went from Israel to Vienna to visit Ami. Ami unfortunately died before we got to\nVienna so I didn\u2019t have a chance to meet her. So that was the amazing coincidence there. But\nlife is full of coincidences isn\u2019t it.\nSo we came to America and I enrolled in public school there. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes, a child can pick it up fairly quickly. I couldn\u2019t pick up certain phrases, colloquialisms.\nVery difficult to absorb. And I remember the woman upstairs in the tenement showing me a\npicture of Roosevelt who was treated as an icon because there was a sheaf of grain underneath it.\nMuch the way, people put a sheaf of grain in their icons. There was a sheaf of grain under\nRoosevelt\u2019s picture and she said do you know who this is. And I don\u2019t remember whether I knew\nat the time that it was Roosevelt. And I said something or other and she said how come? And this\nphrase would not translate itself in my mind. How come. How come. And this was how I began\nto learn English with its colloquialisms. Its idioms.\nSo we lived in Vienna, in Fall River til I was 17 and I had met Harris at that time cause\nhe lived in New Bedford.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 17",

I think my mother may have refused\nit because she felt some pride and not having to take it. But I think my clothes were not fully\nAmerican style yet. And my language wasn\u2019t yet fully and my mannerisms weren\u2019t really fully,\nfully American. But I was able to make friends. And I became Americanized over time.",

When I was 12 years old, I had a friend\nwho went to temple Beth El in Fall River who did go to Hebrew school and she told me about\nthe religious school. And I decided I would like to go at age 12. Having no money, I went to see\nthe rabbi. Rabbi Rudovin [ph] was his name. And he was a very severe figure to the\ncongregation but he was the loveliest, kindest individual and he said to me if I would learn\nHebrew over the summer he would accept me and I could go gratis to Hebrew school and\ngraduate from Hebrew school.\nSo I had a book of Hebrew and that summer I sat down and learned the Hebrew print. To\nthis day I cannot read the script because I was in a hurry for the summer months to learn the\nHebrew capital letters. And so I can read the capital letters. And I read for the rabbi in September\nand he accepted me and the rest and it was lovely. I learned history which I knew a bit of what\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 20\nmy \u2014 my mother would occasionally tell me Bible stories.

It\u2019s, it\u2019s a part of the thought process that never leaves you but I did but as a\nyoung wife and then later a mother, I was so busy trying to raise a family in happy circumstances\nthat the children knew that family had been in Vienna and that I was from Vienna. And they\nwere aware of the circumstances of the war. But we tried to make it a happy American family.",
        "A: Yes. His grandfather came in 1890 from Lithuania and settled at an early time in New\nBedford, Massachusetts where he had a peddler\u2019s cart. And it\u2019s very interesting that New\nBedford had quite a large ethnic group, partly because it had been a whaling town and so people\nof many ethnicities came, including Japanese. And so Harris\u2019 grandfather\u2019s picture is in the New\nBedford whaling museum, along with the other ethnic groups. The Italians, Scots, the Japanese.\nIt\u2019s a lovely little memento of New Bedford\u2019s town.",

But most of his\nextended family and his mother, his grandmother had 11 children, lived in New Bedford so it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 24\nwas a very close knit family and it was an unusual thing for me to go from no family at all to this\ngreat extended family. So that was \u2014",
        "A: Then we moved to New York because Harris got his master\u2019s in math and decided that he\nwould like to be a lawyer. There were seven lawyers in his family. So I guess it was in the DNA\nand he was accepted at Harvard. He was told if he would wait a year. But we were 26 at the time\nand needed to get going rapidly in our lives. And so he was accepted at Columbia. I got a\nteaching job in New York after and in Massachusetts I worked as a training instructor, John\nHancock insurance company.\nBut we left Cambridge and moved to New York. We had an old Nash at the time and we\nloaded our meagre belongings on it, including a mattress on top of the roof of the car and the\nsticker said MIT on the Nash and it was quite another transition to make.

He was a lovely man, Mr.\nRobinson. I have never forgotten him. The vice principal was a very staid prim spinster and\nwhose brother was the bishop of I believe it was New York. And at the time the Christian school\nchildren were dismissed from school for religious school. The Jewish children waited til the end\nof the school. The dictum came down from the board of education that children were no longer\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 25\nto be dismissed early. I had a student in my class named James who was used to be dismissed for\nChristian class. He came up to me and said Mrs. Weinstein I have to leave. And I said terribly\nsorry James. The ruling from the board of education says you need to stay til the end of the\nschool day.\nHe came back the next week and said Mrs. Weinstein I need to leave and my priest says\nthat if you don\u2019t let me go that he will report you to the bishop. I went town to Ms. Flannery his\nsister, the vice principal and I said Ms. Flannery you are going to get a very bad report about me\nfrom your brother and I need to tell you about this. It was the only time in the entire time that I\nworked in that school that I saw her laugh. And she said don\u2019t worry about a thing. I will take\ncare of it. And from then on poor James never came up to me.\nBut I felt very badly because I was a Jew telling him that he couldn\u2019t be excused but I\nhad to follow the ruling of the school board.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They did not.",
        "A: I had no accent except a slight Massachusetts one. But no European accent. That they could\ndetect.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t talk about it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 26",
        "A: No, no I never mentioned it to them. I was just another member of the faculty.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t talk about his losses. He was a stoic in that way. But he did, he did tell us and I told\nthe children and he told the children and he would tell people how he had very early on in 1932\ndetected what was going to happen. And at the last stage of our being in Vienna, before we got\nthe visa and when he was continually denied the visa from the American consulate, he was\nprepared to walk us over the mountains to Switzerland. But fortunately that visa finally came\nthrough. Yeah.",
        "A: And Harris got a job clerking for judge Hasty in Philadelphia. He was a lovely man and we\nmoved to Philadelphia, to Elkins Park. And when our daughter was born Harris went to the\nsynagogue there in Elkins Park which was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and if you go to the\nmuseum of the Diaspora in Tel Aviv there is model of the Frank Lloyd Wright. It\u2019s a beautiful,\nyou \u2019ve seen it.\nAnd we lived there a year. And moved from there to Washington when Harris got a job\nat the law firm here.",
        "A: And he joined the law firm in Washington.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 27",
        "A: Yes, we had our daughter in Philadelphia and then in Washington we had our son Josh who is\nnamed after Harris\u2019 grandfather Moses Joshua Weinstein. And then we had Jacob who was\nnamed after my grandfather. And so he and my cousin in Israel have the same name. And it\u2019s\nJacob Solomon Weinstein.\nI remember one of Harris\u2019 cousins, who lived at the time in Washington went on, his son\nwas named. He said are you going to give him boxing gloves cause he\u2019s going to need it with\nthat name.",
        "A: We have six grandchildren. Our son lives in Santa Monica. He\u2019s a comedy writer and he has\ntwins, a boy and a girl who are 14. Our daughter lives in Wilmette, Illinois and she has two\ngrown sons, one of whom is married to a Romanian girl. And we have our son Jacob and his\nwife Lauren, who live in London. And they have two children.",
        "A: Oh yes. I remember my father saying he was on a trolley and this was years after we came\nand someone asked him directions and my father gave him directions and he said I feel like an\nAmerican. And I feel the same way. America has given us this opportunity to live and I have\nthis feeling of gratitude and this is why I so much enjoy the work I\u2019m doing now which is\nteaching 1n nursing and retirement homes. We began a program 22 years ago which is now\ncalled the Himmelfarb mobile university which goes to senior sites. It runs the spectrum from\nretirement homes, senior centers to nursing homes and Alzheimer\u2019s units. And we are a group of\nteachers that bring classes to these homes so people\u2019s minds stay active. And I particularly love\ngoing to the army, the service homes. And the merchant marine, and navy and coast guard\nbecause when I go there to people who served their country I feel like I\u2019m serving the country\ntoo.\nSo yes, I feel like an American now.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 28",
        "A: I went back after, after our children were grown, I went back for a master\u2019s degree in liberal\narts at Georgetown University and was lucky to have some fantastic teachers, including Jesuits\nwho are masterful teachers. And I learned about anthropology because up to that time I had a\nbusiness education which stood me in very good stead at John Hancock as a teacher there. But I\nfelt my education was very limited. And by earning this master\u2019s degree it opened up a vast\nhorizon. And that\u2019s actually the subject I now teach in these nursing homes is anthropology\nitself. So Georgetown gave me that opportunity.",
        "A: I went for a few years to Catholic to work toward a doctorate but I never did get my\ndoctorate. At Catholic University, but that certainly widened my horizons as well.",
        "A: Anthropology, in anthropology.",
        "A: Yes, yes it did.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 29",
        "A: Yes, yes it did. I wanted to protect them from that but they needed to know that on a very\nmild superficial scale that there\u2019s evil in the world and that one has to be watchful and careful.\nBut not, not to an extent where they would become fearful or psychologically bothered by it.",
        "A: Yes. I\u2019m trying to think what sights and sounds they are but they do evoke, do evoke a\nmemory. Marching sounds do, do that. Boots do that. Even, even when state troopers wear\ntheir boots, it gives, I have to analyze why I have an uneasy feeling. And then I realize why and\ndismiss it cause it goes, cause this is America.",
        "A: No. No, oddly enough they don\u2019t. German shepherds perhaps when they bark viciously do.",
        "A: No, no I don\u2019t. I remember pictures of course but no I don\u2019t remember that per se.",
        "A: Yes it did and I remember hearing a broadcast after we arrived in Massachusetts. And there\nwas a radio show where someone talked of meeting Hitler and I suppose I was five at the time.\nAnd I remember this person saying Hitler kissed her hand in a European manner. And I\nremember saying hunh, if I knew Hitler was going to do that and I met him, I\u2019d put poison on my\nhand. And that, that\u2019s the, but certainly Hitler was a known name in our household.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 30",
        "A: And I could understand what was being said. About Hitler yes.",
        "A: No, no. I have guilt I think that I managed to escape and others didn\u2019t. But I think that\u2019s an\nintegral part of what many refugees feel, but no, no. I am not angry that, that\u2019s their life and\nthey\u2019re entitled to their life. So there\u2019s no anger there.\nThere\u2019s anger at ignorance, at revisionists who will deny that the Holocaust or ignorance\nof it which I feel is a worrisome thing but you and the Holocaust Museum are preventing that\nhopefully. But anger at children who didn\u2019t have, no not at all.",
        "A: Yes that\u2019s a good question. I think I did. I think I did. But then again it doesn\u2019t hurt to lose a\npart of a childhood. You just mature at an earlier age. And you end up in having a certain\nempathy for humanity, whoever they may be. So it\u2019s not a lost childhood in that sense. You gain\nby it. Also by being stronger. You \u2014 I realize later what I do is what the Japanese call bushido,\nthe warrior, the samurai will distance themselves from the emotion of the time so that they could\nfight. They would distance themselves from fear, anger and simply concentrate on what they\nhave been trained to do and I find myself doing that in difficult situations. I set myself apart\nfrom it, don\u2019t allow myself to feel the emotion so that I can go through what has to be done.\nAnd that I think is part of my being a refugee from those times. So that\u2019s what I mean\nthat it doesn\u2019t hurt. It helps.",
        "A: Right, it gives you an outlook and an inner and outer strength. Inside may be turmoil but you\ndon\u2019t allow it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 31",
        "A: I think I\u2019m a unified whole, but Pve learned to control so if there\u2019s anger at a situation it\u2019s not\nanything to do with the Holocaust. But if there\u2019s anger in a situation I\u2019ve learned to cover it up so\nthat I can go ahead with what needs to be done, so there may be anger but I don\u2019t show it. Or\nthere may be sadness and I don\u2019t, try not to show it in that sense. But does your question mean,\nam I in turmoil because of the two cultures that I\u2019m straddling?",
        "A: Well I count myself fortunate that I was able to escape and badly that there were others who\ndidn\u2019t. But we managed to escape and unfortunately others didn\u2019t. So there\u2019s no elation over it.\nThere are no extremes of feeling over it. Simply an acceptance. It is what it is.",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. Let me.",
        "A: Well here I think I straddle two cultures again. For someone who\u2019s European I do feel a\ncertain connection. I think there\u2019s a certain behavior pattern of Europeans that isn\u2019t American\nand yet there\u2019s a certain behavior pattern in Americans that isn\u2019t in European so you simply\nstraddle the two cultures and it\u2019s not that you\u2019re a chameleon. You take on the coloration. It\u2019s\nsimply you have a certain empathy with these different cultures.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 32",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Well I\u2019ve always been pro-Zionist and certainly my belonging to Young Judea fostered,\nfostered that. I feel it\u2019s crucial that we have an Israel because with our nomenclature of the\nwandering Jew hopefully this ends that period and I fully believe that the full extent of the\nHolocaust would not have happened had we an Israel. A homeless, stateless people is a very\nvulnerable people. And I remember reading about Hitler and the Armenians and when the\nArmenian, no one really came to the Armenian aid and Hitler said the world didn\u2019t watch out for\nthe Armenians, therefore we can do the same with the Jews. So I feel that Israel is an essential\nabsolute necessity.",
        "A: We\u2019ve been back now five years in a row. This will be the spring, next spring will be the fifth\nyear in a row. I didn\u2019t go back \u2014",
        "A: Because Harris mentors his group of students at Catholic University and they go into this\narbitration debating that meets in Vienna so that\u2019s how we get back there each year. Otherwise \u2014",
        "A: Back in 72 years.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 33",
        "A: It was like walking on a moving sidewalk. Because it was not a secure feeling. But yet it had\nbeen home and so it was a strange feeling. It is such a beautiful city and such a monumental city\nthat after a while I began to feel at home again. We found a wonderful Polish driver who\nchauffeured us to the places, the house where I had lived in, that apartment house.",
        "A: This was a Polish driver. Lovely man, lovely man.",
        "A: A Polish driver in Austria. And he took us all around to the places our parents store had been.\nThat was in a courtyard and the building had a plaque on it. The Viennese love to put plaques on\nbuildings and the allies apparently didn\u2019t bomb Vienna til rather late in the war so the building\nhad a plaque on it, said this was bombed by the allies in 1943. It was 1944. And then you went\nthrough a little gate and there was a courtyard that is now and where my parents\u2019 store had been\nis now a garage. But I recognized, I felt the feeling, a memory of the courtyard.\nAnd then he, the Polish driver took us to the apartment house. Couldn\u2019t\u2019 find it. We\ndrove around and around and he finally had the wonderful idea to ask a postman and he said oh\nyes, that building there had been 29 Heligestadt strasse. It was a new modern building. Jacob our\nolder son, our younger son who lives in London had gone to Vienna several years before and\ngone to that house. And taken a picture of it.",
        "A: Before it was knocked down. It was a lovely old stone building. We had an apartment in it.\nBut that had been knocked down to make way for a clinic. And we went into the clinic and I\nwanted to ascertain that was the building and because it was a long line of ill people, I didn\u2019t\nwant to break into that line. So I went to an office where there was no one and I said in my poor\nGerman, excuse me can I have a question. And they looked up and said get into line. And I said\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 34\nbut I\u2019m a tourist. I have only a question. Get into line. So we went out of the building and waited\ntil a person with a friendly face came out and then in our bad German, my bad German said can\nyou tell us how old this is. And she said oh it was two years old. So that fit. So it was a perfect\nsite for a medical clinic because Ubahn, the fantastic system, rail system that they have was just\na door or two down, so people could make it easily.\nWe went back. We found the house where my grandfather had lived and my aunt Toni\nwhich is now in a heavily Muslim building. A man there very kindly asked if we wanted to come\ninside but we didn\u2019t. we didn\u2019t want to intrude. We didn\u2019t know what apartment it was. So and\nthen we had another driver, a fellow from Turkey who took us to the Friedhoff which is the\ncemetery where my grandmother, Rosa is buried. This is my maternal grandmother who died in\nthe flu epidemic. And we tried find her grave in the Jewish section. Could not. The Turkish\ndriver was marvelous. He ran up and down the rows trying to find them. Til we finally had to say\nwe're afraid we have to get to the airport now. We need to stop but he was willing to try. He\nworked very hard. He was lovely.\nIn contrast, I had a taxi driver from Vienna and well shall I tell you this story. He was\nvery angry that he had to drive me to the Marriott which was the edge of Vienna from the center\nof Vienna and he, I guess from my poor German he understood that I had been there before. And\nI said yes I was born there. He said why did you leave Austria? It\u2019s a wonderful country. And I\nthought ach, if I have to explain. There 1s no sense in it. But that was my meeting with the\nAustrian driver. So it was, we have been back several times since. And I\u2019ve gone to the\nwonderful museums. And gives me a chance to practice my poor German, although invariably\nwhen I speak German the Viennese break into English. Show you how bad my German must be.\nBut I try to practice it before we leave so that I can at least get us about Vienna.",
        "A: I did. I took a little bit of German in addition to French. And it was an easy class for me\nbecause of it. And Yiddish of course stands you in very good stead as a dialect.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 35",
        "A: Well we campaigned for gun control and when Martin Luther King was assassinated we and\nsome friends went to the capitol to distribute gun control pamphlets. I actually had the pamphlets\nknocked out of my hand by a man who said, what are you a commie? But we continued to work\nfor gun control. Hasn\u2019t worked very well. But we worked on that.\nAnd our daughter was, when we lived in Crestwood, our daughter wanted to enroll in a\nBrownie troop and we went to the local Baptist church where she was a member of the scout\ntroop. Unfortunately she was not made welcome. She was the only white child there and it made\nvery clear that she was not welcome. And we, after a year of trying to participate, we left.",
        "A: Well it was interesting to watch these trials. I was very happy that he was caught. We support\nthe center, the Wiesenthal center in Los Angeles and it was a painful trial but a very necessary\none because as the Holocaust deniers come out, as the Holocaust survivors die off, without your\ngood work and the Holocaust like this, there is a danger that the world will forget. I was very\nglad that this trial was brought to bear.",
        "A: They are sensitive to it. They are sensitive to it. We never emphasize that but they know\nfrom history from our history and so they are very sensitive to it. Our older daughter in\nparticular because she 1s the first child. But the boys are quite sensitive to it also, quite sensitive\nas are our grandchildren. I think they are being taught about the Holocaust.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 36",
        "A: (pause) Not too much, not too much. I think they see certain habits which come from being\nhungry as a child. I cannot throw food away and they see that in me. Food cannot be wasted.",
        "A: And they know why because I explain why.",
        "A: What it\u2019s like to be hungry. So I think they understand.",
        "A: Yes, yes. In addition I do try to explain in a fairly light way. Also a degree of watchfulness 1s\nsomething else that I try to instill in them. You know Jefferson said that evil can prevail if\nenough good people don\u2019t do anything and I want them to be alert to anti-Semitism, to wrongs\ndone to any group. Everybody\u2019s got a responsibility to watch for that. But it\u2019s hard. When you\ngrow up in comfortable circumstances it\u2019s hard to imagine it. So we\u2019re a generation already\nremoved from that. So it\u2019s hard to inculcate that in a way but you do what you can when the\nmoment comes, without hammering it in.",
        "A: Yes I think I tended to be overprotective and that\u2019s another common thing I think that that\nrefugees have.",
        "A: That something can happen any moment. You know I read a poet, I wish I remember his\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 37\nname, from Israel. He said every Jew is born with a knife in his heart. Of course he was talking\nabout Isaac and Abraham and Isaac and the sacrifice that didn\u2019t take place but I think every Jew\nfeels that and so you worry that your children \u2014 and then it extends even to your grandchildren. It\nnever ends yeah.\nBut then you don\u2019t\u2019 have to be a refugee to worry about your children I think. A Jewish\nmother, an Italian can be a Jewish mother as well.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure the world has learned enough. This is the concern. This is the best, why do things\nlike Sudan or Ethiopia, Syria. I don\u2019t\u2019 think the world learns. It\u2019s a part of our survival\ntechnique as human beings I think. We are able to what\u2019s the word categorize, compartmentalize\nthank you. That\u2019s it exactly. We compartmentalize and so we take note of evil when it happens\nbut then we are so busy trying to live that we put it aside. But I think the world needs to\ncontinue, it needs to be reminded, needs to be reminded. Continually.",
        "A: Excellent, excellent.",
        "A: It is the place. It\u2019s the nation\u2019s capital. People come from all over and they need to come and\nthey need to know. I vividly remember when we went to Krakow. Harris was teaching a class\nthere. And the Jagiolian, Jagiellolian, it\u2019s named after Jagiello the king of Poland and he\nestablished a law school there. And we\u2019ve been there several times for Harris to teach. And of\ncourse Auschwitz is, I have not been, is a half hour to an hour away from Krakow. And I\nremember one morning seeing two couples from England, Christians going to Auschwitz. They\nwere laughing. They didn\u2019t know what they were going to see. I think they were probably going\nto see the salt mines which are an interesting thing to see also. And they were laughing and gay.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nSeptember 19, 2013 38\nThey came back utterly drained and gray. And I said to myself, I know just where you\u2019ve been.\nAnd I think the world needs to see the Holocaust Museum so they know where the world has\nbeen. So I am thoroughly in favor of it. I\u2019m rather glad to see it, never mind rather. I am glad to\nsee that there are Holocaust museums throughout the country and in Europe as well. A needed\nreminder, the needed reminder to the world.",
        "A: Stay alert and stay human. I think they\u2019re nice human beings to begin with but they should\nremember their menschkeit, their humanity, that they are a part of the human race. And they\u2019re\nnot just Jews or Christians or Arabs, but humans, and we\u2019ve all evolved from the same source so\nstay human.",
        "A: Is there anything that you think that I left out, that I should. I\u2019m turning it back with a Jewish\nquestion. Answer the question with a question.",
        "A: Thank you very much, Gail, for doing it. It\u2019s a lovely thing that you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re keeping\nmemories alive for a very important reason. You\u2019re keeping memories so that activity can stay\nevolved.\n"
