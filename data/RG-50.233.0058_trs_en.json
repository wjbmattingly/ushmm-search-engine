DUBBED TAPE AND ORIGINAL DO NOT SEEM TO\nMESH EITHER. NOT PROOFREAD.\npl ... fifteen minutes later they were already gone because they were\ntold cme y ORS going to einklausen[ph]2, that they are going to\nbath. I was by faith[ph3], naturally, but it\u2019s a nature. Everytime\nwhen I\u2019m sick or when I\u2019m troubled, I always say, \"Please G-d, help\nme. What shall I tell it to. I have nobody else. I can\u2019t say,\n\"Jesus Christ, help me,\" because I don\u2019t believe in it. IT was\nbrought up in a very religious home so I say, \"Please G-d, help me.\nI can\u2019t forgive that for what he let happen to our people. My boss\n\u00bb (D in the =p \u2014 ee ise SSE OT 10T he died about seventeen years\n, ago, I think. I used to see them, I worked for five years. I was\nnext to him. I was the top secretary. I have a letter here. We\nused to talk about it. He was not religious but he only ate kosher\nmeat. I said, \u201cWhy kosher meat?\" He said, \"I want, to have some\nsign that I\u2019m a Jew so at least I eat kosher meat.\"!'\"T was operated\ntwo months ago. T had a terrible infection going up ----------\n[17]. I took out five teeth. I had to be in the hospital because\nit infected my sinus and if I don\u2019t remove and drained I would get\nit in my brain. So I talk to you and I laugh and I feel terrible.\nThey want two thousand dollars for fixing it so for the time being\nI\u2019m without teeth, so forgive me. So I said to him, Mr.\nGladstone[ph21], he was a very very intelligent man. very bright.\nDe BO aga . \u2018 \u2018 2\nHe was a \u201c---=\"\u201c[22]very nice. I said, their was no G-d in\nAuschwitz, you know that. He said, I agree with you but what do\nyou want me to do take G-d to torah, take G-d to court? He says\nafter the war in 1946 all the pen men, all the writers and poets\nwent to France, to Paris. They got together from all over the\nworld. And there was Rabbi Herzog the head ga\u2019on from Israel. Was\nit Rabbi Herzog? What was his name?\nHerzog, yeah.\nI think so. With a big beard[27]. He was sitting with Rabbi\nHerzog in Paris in a little restaurant having tea or coffee and\ntalking about it and he said to Rabbi Herzog, Rabbi Herzog, where\n. was G-d in Auschwitz when they took a million innocent children and\ntortured gassed and burned them. Where was he? How could you\nplead G-d Almighty so good full of mercy because when you davin in\nschull you say G-d, full of mercy. So the Rabbi said, all right so\nwhat do you want me to do take water in toilet. Who am I, to\njudge? So he told me the same thing what the Rabbi told him. I\nsaid I don\u2019t care. He said you know what it is Molly, it\u2019s like a\nlittle hill of ants. A man goes and puts his foot on the ants and",
        "6\nand they had to stay in line for bread and people used to die and\nmy mother told me at night when it was quiet they used to risk\ntheir life and go and bring them bread and sugar and wood to heat\ntheir stoves. So the goyim despite the fact that my father was so\nreligious, they loved him, - Pan[ph192] Bastocki, Pan Bastocki, Mr.\nBastocki in other words. I hear them - he had a nice ??[193] you\nsee. They had the highest respect for him because he did a lot for\nthe Christians and I had girl from [??195] the top floor of our\nbuilding, Yeneshk[ph195] her father became the finance or the\neducational minister of Poland in our town and she was my\ngirlfriend and they were very classy people and they were very\nintelligent people but there were very few you could count them on\nthe fingers. The rest of them....You see the classy people they\nknew that the whole thing about Jesus and the whole thing ???[202]\nof baloney, you know but they made the peasants believe that the\nJews are guilty, killing their God and that\u2019s what you get from the\n???204]. Because why? For, example, a Jewish man and a goy, poor\npeople, I mean the plain\u2019??[205] they used to go to work in the\nsame factory, right. On Friday was pay day so the Jew got the pay\nday and the goy got the pay day. So the Jew went at home to the\nlittle \"kleine haizel\" [ph207] in a little place in a little room\nand the wife had washed the floor and put wood shavings or what you\ncall to keep it dry and clean and had a couple of candles burning\nand whatever she had she made the piece of chicken or whatever or\nfish and the children, old clothes but what was clean and repaired\nand he would bring her the money and she would manage everything.\nThe goyim when he got the pay day he went right away to the bar, to Ly\nthe beerhouse or whatever they call it in the shenk[ph214] and he\" \u00a9\nwould sit and drink until three o\u2019clock in the morning-and no money ' \\\"*\nwas left. And then he would come home and the wife would - it was aa\ndark and \"finster\"[ph215] and his wife was crying and saying, Jan aoe\nwhere is the money, what happened to your pay day so he would beat\n, her up. She said but look at Chaim, look how nice, ...??[218] poor\npeople, a candle burning and it\u2019s warm in the house and the kids\n| are clean and they had some food on the table. He says you know\nwhy because the Jews are thieves. They steal our money. That\u2019s\nwhy they have and we don\u2019t have it. And that\u2019s how the legend\nstarted that the Jews are thieves, that the Jews are not murderers\nbut they steal from the poor and they take it for themselves. And\nthat\u2019s how antisemitism spreads. What you teach the children the\nchildren teach their children. So Jan was starving only drunk to\ndeath and Chaim was having a piece of bread or whatever he had and\nhe had it on his table. And that\u2019s how it started, you see but\naristocracy did it on purpose because they didn\u2019t want to pay the\npeople too much money. People used to work for peanuts. But the\nJew started to make the best he could with this. Even the Rabbi\nwas starWing[?230]. But Rabbi was eating in our house because he\ncouldn\u2019t afford to make a Shabbos meal. And the goy loved to\ndrink. They\u2019re known for their alcoholism, the Polaks and the\nGermans and the British and???f231]% And the Jews never touched\nalcohol.

        "O\u2019kay in 1934, 1933, \u201834 when Hitler came to power in Germany, in\nWilno, Poland all the students, they had a big university, Stephen\nBaturilphi62]. They had the ??[163], how do you,say in English, -\nswastikas were on the windows and [indistinct164] talk about\naristocracy with the beautiful - students [???165] and I remember\nwhen I was fifteen years old, you save that picture in that little\ngarden what I showed you, you couldn\u2019t get in anymore.\nNo Jews allowed?\nNo, 2?2??[167] Christian that time, anyway, they used to go around\nwith stick, students\u2019 sticks and in their hand would stick, they\nhad razorblades and they used to attack the Jewish people if\nthey\u2019re going in the park and cut them with the razorblades.\nThis was in \u201833, \u201834?\nIn \u201833, '34 that\u2019s when Hitler came to power in Germany, the Nazis\u2122\ncame to Wilno.and they used to scream - they used to stay by the\ndoor of our store and scream, don\u2019t buy by the Jewish [spoke in\nPolish 175]. Don\u2019t buy anything from the Jews. They used to stand\nby the door and not let in...\nIn front of your store?\nRight, and other stores, too, not just our store and not let in no\nChristians to shop.\nDid people obey that? Did people not come in?\n90% and they all wanted the blood from Jews. That\u2019s all what they\nwanted.\nWere you in a Jewish neighborhood?\nWell, there wasn\u2019t, such a - no, I wasn\u2019t in Yidisha????[180] that\u2019s\nwhat the Jews [indistinct180]. I was in a very classy - across\nwhere I lived like the building here there was a court and we had\ndoctors and lawyers and [7182]. The society of Wilno\u2019s aristocracy\nlived where we lived, you see because what the street [indistinct\n183] by the famous poet [??184] the street and my mother had some\nfriends who were very classy because I wasn\u2019t born then so from the\nfirst World War my mother used to --- it was against the law to ---\nwe had bread and we had everything and there were - I remember\n[2???188] there was a family who was very aristocratic Polish family",

They said Molly, you wouldn\u2019t recognize it, all burnt and\noye the way the Russian built those houses like square that time\npf ~findistinct 126] ceilings and beautiful decorations. And the\nterraces were so gorgeous. You don\u2019t make it in the states like\nthat, too expensive. It\u2019s the beautiful architecture\na [ indi et ine t 13 0 | . es es ee a .\nYou lived in this whole building?\nNo, no. On the main floor there was the store and the bakery and\nthe second floor was our apartment overlooking the\nBuffaloberg[ph131], the famous mountains, Buffalo mountains like\nBuffalo, you know, Buffalo mountains. Later on they made a big\nstadium for soccer one of the biggest stadium there is. From our\nwindow you can see the Buffalo Mountains. What else? I attended\nthe Hebrew Gymnasium, you have it this, right? And then I\ngraduated it was 1938 and I got married. Now wait a moment. 1938\n.j%, I was - I was eighteen years old, right? So that\u2019s right, because\nI was seventeen and a half, eighteen. And then I got married and\nthe war broke out.\nSo you were married in \u201839?\nYeah, right, in the beginning of \u2018\u201939, March or April, I don\u2019t\nremember exactly when. And then the war broke out and then I had\na baby; it says here when I had a baby you can look it up. I don\u2019t\nremember when it was.\nWhen did the Nazis come into Wilno?\n1941. They made a pact with Stalin. So we still were under the\nBolsheviks, you see. And in June 1941 this was suddenly became\nwithout any - because they caught the Russians unexpectedly and\nthey killed them, 22 million Russians they killed in the war. June\n1941 the Nazis came in. I remember how the Polak was excited that\nthey saw them. They were so happy with them. They\nshould...[indistinct 150].\nBecause they were unhappy with Stalin.\nNo.\nThey thought that Hitler was going to...\nYeah, three years later they realize when 1943, 1944 they were\ncrying their head off. But for the first couple of years they were\nexcited. First of all they will get rid of the Jews and everything\nwhat the Jews had they will take it which they did you see so they\nwere very happy. But then they ate up everything what the Germans\n-- and then the Germans made them go to work and they didn\u2019t like",
        "3\n_ be? You are the young people. You have to stand. What can you\n,/\u00a3 do?. I took out some pictures.\nI\u2018d like to get a complete history from you.\nWell, you have it here\u2019 Can you read this? It\u2019s very tough to\nread because it\u2019s condensed, but you can read this here.\nOkay\nAs I said it\u2019s a very condensed history. Now this picture is\nterrible. It\u2019s smeared. This is me ~--~-------~-[87]. Okay let\u2019s\nforget. Nu eb ee\nThat\u2019s important. I\u201911 listen to that.\nI went to Gymnasium Rialys, it was called. I went to BSE a ae\n[89]. Do you want to know the street, too? Zolwana[ph89] That\nwould be in Polish, Zolwana Street in Wilna, at the Polish time.\nI graduated it was I think in 1938 but I think you have it there.\nAnd I got married in \u201839. The war broke out I think in September\nor October of \u201839 and I was marrried I think it was in April. I\ndon\u2019t even remember when I was married. You know how stupid young\npeople are. I got pregnant and I didn\u2019t even know. And I lost my\nhusband and my brother at the same time. They were running away.\nMy baby had temperature. She got sick so I didn\u2019t go. So they ran\n,o, and were caught and shot by the Nazis. I\u2019m not sure if you have it\n:\u00b0\u201cin this. We were five sisters and two brothers. And we lived in\nWilna until the war broke out. Just before the war broke out I got\nmarried and in 1941 my husband and my brother right away were\nkilled and then my older sister with her children. They don\u2019t\n| like this long too. They make it very abbreviated.\nIt is very abbreviated.\nYes, so what would you need to know? I was one of seven children\nin a very very religious home, in a very very happy home.\nYour father owned a grocery store and a bakery.\nYes. My father was a grain merchant but he was a rabbi. He was\nvery religious., okay. We had a grocery store and a bakery on\nPortowa Street. And this is in Wilna. Wilna;s7-5---[115]. Now\nit\u2019s Wilna----------------------[121] )\nWhere did you live? Did you live in a house or in an apartment\nbuilding?\nuid\nweve Shh .\nWe had a house on -------[122] before I was born but then this was\na big building, beautiful\nFile: Ingster.Mol",
        "amillion ants got killed by his foot but some of them survived and\nthat\u2019s what happened, he said, to our Jewish people. That was his\ninterpretation. And yet had memorized, I have his book with the\npoetry what he talks about this. JI can S\u00e9ttle2it not forgive and\nnever forget. And my daughter, I never talk to her about my past\nbecause it\u2019s too gruesome. I didn\u2019t want her to know what people\n, can do to other people. She was going to medical school here in\n\u201840 John Hopkins. She didn\u2019t tell me nothing. She just eloped with a\n\u2018goy\u2019 and got married then John Hopkins University. Now she\u2019s\ndivorced with three kids and I almost had a heart attack right then\nbecause she was my only child, and she has a Masters in Science.\nShe works in the National Institute of Health. But she also ruined\nher life. She was fourteen years with that man. So the middle one\nsaid, Grandma we\u2019re half Jews and half Christians. The oldest one\nsaid, he\u2019s ten years old now, he knows a little bit about the Nazis\nand bad people and he hates them; he said Grandma I hate all those\npeople, I\u2019m Jewish. He the oldest one said it because I ---------\n[53] by a very religious moel. But I can\u2019t talk to them about all\nthose things . I can\u2019t talk to my daughter about it because if she\ncould have run away witha \"goy\" and leave it me, I have nothing to\nsay. Who am I? In my heart I know what it is but the world\nforgets everything. This is very good what they\u2019re doing. I hope\nto G-d that they wouldn\u2019t demolish this memorial place because here\nwe're going ten years from now...the blacks hate the Jews too. The\nJews sacrificed the young Jewish men, remember Goodman and some\nother one who were killed in Mississippi? Jewish people sacrificed\ntheir life for them, but they still hate the Jews. Jackson, the\none who was running for President hated the Jews. We have that\nother guy, what\u2019s his name, he\u2019s a priest, pastor..\nSharfton\nBeside him. No there\u2019s the other one, the muslim.\nFarrakhan\nFarrakhan. He hates the Jews. At Purim he said what kind of\nreligion is this. Because the Arabs give them so much money they\ndo everything for the Arabs. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re\npreaching everything for the Arabs. So wherever you turn, they\nhate the Jews and I would like to know the reason. O\u2019kay the\nYankees[66] when I was a kid used to tell them because they killed\nour G-d. Why do the Arabs[67] hate the Jews? In Germany he said ,.. '\nthis porter[68] who was on television said we saw that -2@-\u201c4 lo taai wen\n--[69] said the union or the Jews are running the world and we are\ngoing to get rid of them. So the reporter said that\u2019s not true.\nThe Jews are not running the world. And this was a Christian. So\nthe only place which is a little civilized in that respect is the\nUnited States. Yet.there is so much hatred from blacks and muslims\nand goyim\u2019\u201c4++*--\" [73]. What\u2019s going on? What\u2019 going on in this\nworld? After all this hell. I remember when I was liberated I\nsaid to myself, now everybody will love each other. People will\nembrace and kiss each other. There will be no more hatred. \"A\nnechtica tug.\" This happened all over again. So what\u2019s going to"
