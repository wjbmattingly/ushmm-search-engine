        "A: My name ts Elizabeth Koenig.",
        "Q: Elizabeth, I wanted to go back and, and ask a little bit of background about your\nfamily. One of the things that you didn\u2019t say on the, on the videotape was the names\nof your parents, I believe and maybe we can just start with that.",

        "A: Yes. She, her father was a pediatrician and she grew up in a very middle-class\nenvironment, very comfortable in the first district of Vienna. She, she, they were a\nvery close family. Her, her, she had a sister, a younger sister and she went to school\nin Vienna and actually I went to the same school late. And she, she helped my\ngrandfather a little bit in, with the patients and always was interested helping the sick.\nShe, she was very happy child and by the way, I can show you the painting of my\ngreat, great, great-grandmother which is hanging here on the wall.",
        "Q: Kay, stop for one second. Can you talk a little bit more about what the\natmosphere was like in your home, when you were growing up. Do, how, I know\nyour father was political and I don\u2019t know if that was true of the whole household.\nCan you talk a little about that?",
        "A: I was born and lived in the first four years of my life in Vienna, in a,\ncomfortably apartment in Vienna\u2019s eighth district. My father\u2019s father was a lawyer\nand he had died a few months before my arrival. And it, my father was an editor at\nthe newspaper and my mother managed the household. My parents loved music,\npeople and discussions and they went out a lot, and, at, as well as having frequent\nget-together at their place. Their friends were writers and artists and the atmosphere\nat home was always very lively. My father worked at night so when he came home\nin the morning to sleep, I had to be very quiet. His paper appeared in the morning\nand, so he had to work all night. And they liked if I even left the house so I wouldn\u2019t\ndisturb him. Before my father had, he had graduated from law school and this\nenabled him to be the newspaper\u2019s responsible editor. A position which required him\nto represent the newspaper in court whenever it was sued. He also, also specialized\non reports relating to international subjects such as the League of Nations. As, as the\nworld passed the period of economic depression, my father lost his position in 1927.\nHe was appointed an editor to several publications in Berlin, and relocated his family\nto that city. I started going to elementary school in Berlin, Villmustof (ph), where\nwe lived until 1933. And returned to Vienna after Hitler\u2019s victory. It was an, I went\nto an all-girls\u2019 school and we had religious instruction once a week. We were given\nbible instruction and we were encouraged to make plays (ph) about the lives of the\ncharacters in the Bible and, such as, for instance, Esther and Ruth. In Berlin, my\nfather worked as and, responsible editor at the Montock-Morgan (ph) whose editor in\nchief was Leo , aS well as at the Togaboo (ph) and founded the\neconomic review there . In 1931, he was sent on a reporter\u2019s trip around\nthe world, visiting Russia, Manchuria, North China, Korea, Japan and the USA.\nThere is a write-up about him in the New York Times, July the 5\" and from 1931 to\n1933, he was co-editor in chief of the Daily . My mother disliked\nBerlin thoroughly, missing the charm of her daily existence. The social life was\nmuch reduced though we still had a lot of visits from family and friends. In March,\n1933, we returned to Vienna, except for my father who wanted to finish some\nprofessional obligations, but was obliged to make a sudden departure when he\nescaped arrest by the Gestapo, May 1933. From then on, he was blacklisted as an\nopponent to the Nazi Regime.",
        "Q: What, can you talk about how aware you were politically of what was going on at\nthe time?",
        "A: Oh I was a child. I had no political views. When the Nazis came of course, I was,\nI was anti-Nazi, anti-fascist. I, I was very frightened by them, very.",
        "Q: Do you remember hearing discussions, political discussions at home with your\nfather and mother and people who would come over?",
        "A: Yes, I, I listened. I didn\u2019t say anything but I listened.",
        "Q: And what was usually the, the tenor of those discussions?",
        "A: The, the, I must say that there\u2019s a vast generational change in the attitude of\nchildren, children were rarely even permitted to take part but we, we were very\ninterested and usually just listening behind the door, too. And, but we weren\u2019t asked\nabout our opinions.",
        "Q: What was the relationship between you and your brothers and sisters?",
        "A: [had only one brother and he, he was the big brother and he treated me as his little\nsister and we were, we had fun together.",
        "Q: What kind of...",
        "A: At that time, I mean at the time when I was, the time I\u2019m speaking is six, seven,\neight.",
        "Q: What kinds of things did you do with, how did you play?",
        "A: We, he had a, a rail...",
        "Q: Train?",
        "A: Train. Yeah.",
        "Q: Electric train?",
        "A: Yeah. And we liked to play with that.",
        "Q: Let me jump ahead now to when you emigrated, how old were you?",
        "A: Can I add something to the other, to your question?",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: I played mostly with my friend, girlfriend who was the daughter of a very\nprominent painter in Berlin. Her name is, was Yoseffa Shtinehart (ph) and her father\nhad a very large and we were together daily there and we, and I played\nwith her, I mean very intensively at, and very much fun plays and\ngames. And she just lived around the corner and in 1933, when the, the, Hitler came\nto power, he was immediately arrested and it was terrible for me. It was in fact, on\nthe day of my birthday and it was a terrible shock and he was released but he took off\nvery, at that, just at that moment he took off for Israel with his family. It was very\ndifficult for him to emigrate because of his paintings and how to take them along and\nsafeguard them, but that\u2019s a long story.",
        "Q: How old were you when you emigrated to the United States?",
        "A: Oh that\u2019s a few years later, I ...",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: We went back to Vienna.",
        "Q: We, we were going back just to talk about some of the things that you hadn\u2019t been\nasked in the video and now the, the main focus of this is going to be your experiences\nafter the war.",
        "A: How old was I...",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Came to the United States?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I was 17 going on 18. I was ready, I was, when I came I went to high school.\nAnd I applied for college immediately afterwards. Excuse me, what was your\nquestion before?",
        "Q: I just had asked you how old you were.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: What were, what was the emigration process like? Can you tell me a little bit like,\nwhat that was, what that was like?",
        "A: How we got into the United States?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: That was very strange experience because we had to leave Europe during 1942, at\nthe time when the transatlantic travel was very rare and we were extremely fortunate\nto get a little space on one of the rare transports that went from Portugal to the United\nStates. But by no means directly because they, the ship tried to avoid the mine, the\nmines of the ocean and we went first to Cuba then to the Bermudas and finally, we\nended up at Virginia Beach but we didn\u2019t know we were, where we were. We just\nended up and the immigration officers came on board and processed us on board and\nthen when finally we were allowed to leave the when they agreed, they\nwere afraid that the boat contained spies and or, any other people they didn\u2019t wish to\ncome on, to the United States. And that was their main concern. And so not\neverybody got off. So those that were allowed to get off finally were...",
        "Q: Blindfolded?",
        "A: Blindfolded and we were guided to a train. And the train were, was also\nblindfolded and we couldn\u2019t look outside and we didn\u2019t know where we were. We\ndidn\u2019t know we were in Virginia Beach. And then something very nice happened.\nWe received something to eat and...",
        "Q: Were you blindfolded at the time?",
        "A: Yes. Then of course they took it off in the train.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: In the train they took it off because the train was black. You couldn\u2019t see anything\nanyway. And they gave us sandwiches and I, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget my\nastonishment at the white bread that was given to us. During the war and I thought\nthis was a special welcome gift.",
        "Q: You later found out this was...",
        "A: Your daily bread. And then we were, when the train left, we weren\u2019t told where\nwe were going and we landed, not landed, we arrived at New York City, Penn\nStation, 34\" Street, the doors were opened. We were told you\u2019re on your own and\nhere we were.",
        "Q: So there you were in New York. What were your impressions of New York?",
        "A: Well, first of all, we didn\u2019t quite know what to do. Here we were, we weren\u2019t\nprepared for, for that and we had very little money and so we had to decide what to\ndo. So we actually decided to split up because, and everybody, we all had friends\nand family here in New York, but they had no clue that we had arrived. And so we\ndidn\u2019t want to overwhelm any, any one in particular so we said it\u2019s best we go each to\none person and then maybe they can put us up and that\u2019s what happened. And they\ndid put us up very kindly, each one of us separately.",
        "Q: And what did you think of, of New York?",
        "A: Yeah, I walked the first day, already, on my arrival. I walked from 34\u201d Street to, I\nthink 86\" Street on the west side. I was overwhelmed and I must say the, the word\nfreedom became something of meaning. It, you were free to go without showing a\npaper, without identifying yourself. You were free. That was my, my really, the first\nimpact.",
        "Q: Did you talk about that at all with people?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Just a feeling.",
        "A: Yeah. I think this the first time that I mentioned it.",
        "Q: And you were 17, 18 at the time?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: And you\u2019d never really experienced this kind of freedom?",
        "A: Right. No. Because, not anyway, in the, as a child I had experienced that\nfreedom, but not as a teenager.",
        "Q: Did it take some getting used to? Was it strange?",
        "A: No, I, I loved it. It and I, and that for me is the essence of America. It stayed with\nme. I, I, now even more shocked than a person who hasn\u2019t experienced that at the\nnecessity of writing the social security on everything you, you hand in now. Before\nwhen I arrived in the United States, you needed nothing, absolutely nothing. You\ngave your name, everybody believed you and if, if, if you, if they asked you do you\nhave an identification and you took out an envelope from a letter that you got\nyesterday, that was sufficient. And that was, that, I thought was marvelous.",
        "Q: And this was after having been asked for your papers at every checkpoint",
        "A: Exactly, exactly.",
        "Q: You were in school at this time. What, how did the teachers and, and your fellow\nstudents respond to you as, as a, aS an immigrant, as someone who\u2019d come from such\na horrible experience?",
        "A: Actually, nobody asked me anything. The only person who realized that was a\nteacher who, whose job actually it was to deal with children whose mother tongue 1s\nnot English. And she was, she knew it, I think, about my background and she was\nvery kind. And very helpful. She collected clothes that I needed but she didn\u2019t let\nme know that she gave it to me. She just, it appeared where I was sitting or she just\ngave, she never wanted to be thanked for it but I knew she must have been, she had\ncollected it. And, and mostly marvelous clothes that I had never even had before,\nsuch beautiful clothes. And the, the co-student, my students, colleagues never asked\nme anything. And the fact that my English was very poor of course, was very\nnoticeable and in fact, it was non-existent in, in the first few weeks. I learned fast but\nit, the first few weeks it was non-existent and so you tended to go, we had to eat at\nschool, right? And so you tended to go and sit with children that you could talk with.\nSo a little French table was sort of brought together with little refugees from\nBelgium and France and we got to know each other because of the language.",
        "Q: Did you know any other Jewish children?",
        "A: I, these children were Jewish mostly, my little friends, yes.",
        "Q: And did you discuss the, where you had come from? Did you discuss the war?",
        "A: Oh, we, we told each other our stories, yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes. I remember my Belgian friend came from a diamond family and my, and I,\nand my French friend came from a doctor\u2019s family.",
        "Q: Eventually when you learned how to speak English better, did you then talk about",
        "A: No, because it, I wasn\u2019t asked no. The only thing, where I\ntalked about actually is when I left Europe I was given certain letters and documents\nby a variety of people to bring to the United States which I kept on me with great\ncare. And amongst it was a, a request by the Truckmay (ph) family for me to contact\nthe Quaker in the United States, that was very important because the Quakers had\ngiven their support to the Luchombon (ph) Project and to, and Pastor Truckmay (ph)\nwas entirely dependent on their financial help. And so that was one of the first things\nI did it, was to go to the New York Quaker office and they were very interested and\nthey asked me to come to a meeting and they asked me to give a little talk on my\nexperience and, and they, they were fascinated by what had happened to their\nsupport, to hear about it from firsthand. And there\u2019s a little story, aside, 1s a lady\ncame up to me and she said, would I agree to stay with her during the summer and be\na companion to her daughter. And that was in springtime and so that seemed very far\naway and I agreed of course, yes I would. And then when I did spend time with that\nfamily in the summertime, what she really wanted me to do is to teach her child\nGerman. And to me, that was terrible. I didn\u2019t want to speak German. That was the\nlanguage of the enemy. But I didn\u2019t want to disappoint her either. So I did teach the\nchild German but it was, it was a great insight to my person, in a way. And I, I\nmention this because nobody would think of that, I don\u2019t think. You, you don\u2019t think\nyou, this little girl speak, this not little, this young girl speaks German so why\nshouldn\u2019t she speak German with, I, I can understand her now very well but at that\ntime, 1t made me very unhappy.",
        "Q: Did you talk to anyone else aside from the Quakers about, about your experience?\nWhen did you begin to talk to, more, more openly and were people willing to listen\nto your story?",
        "A: I, it\u2019s hard to answer. I cannot give you a time. There was no particular time\nwhen I started to talk about it. I was very occupied with doing my schoolwork and I,\nwithout being asked, I would not have started anything.",
        "Q: And you weren\u2019t asked.",
        "A: And, and nobody, nobody asked.",
        "Q: Why do you think that is?",
        "A: That\u2019s an excellent question. They, in the United States, the United States were\npreoccupied with the war and the war effort. And they were fighting the war, they\nwere not, I believe, interested in what happened before. Perhaps, maybe.",
        "Q: Maybe they thought it was impolite or... to ask if it was something that, to ask\nabout something that might have been hard to talk about.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Your brother joined, or was a member of the United States Army.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: In, in the video you talked about his...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Contribution...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: To the war effort. Do you, do you feel as though you made a contribution? Did\nyou, did you want to make a contribution?",
        "Q: Not through, not because of my brother but yes, immediately after I came, I felt\nguilty, personally. Also, I felt guilty that we were saved. Made me feel guilty. I felt\nguilty that I left France at this particular time. So, I might mention something that I\nnever mentioned before. It, 1t didn\u2019t occur to me to mention it, I guess or I forgot.\nBut just before we left France, somebody contacted me and asked me to distribute\nanti-Nazi literature. I must say today they give it a name but at that time, we didn\u2019t\nthink of ourself, neither working for the Resistance or Underground, we, we, didn\u2019t\noccur to us to think in those terms. And they, and they, today they give this a name.\nAnd they call it a coolyay (ph) but I just was a young girl on the bicycle who\ndistributed this literature. And, and I, I, I personally did it in the streets of Toulouse\nand it was very dangerous but I don\u2019t think it ever occurred to me to think that I did\nsomething dangerous. The only thing I knew was that I had to keep my mouth shut,\nnever tell anybody what I was doing, not my parents, not my friends, nobody. It was\nzero. You had to do what you were asked to do without asking any questions. And I\nfelt I was doing something important. And to leave that gave me this guilt feeling.\nAnd also, I, I had something very rare, a bicycle. And I wanted to leave it with this\norganization and so when we escaped from France to Spain and we were on the train,\nthis train stopped in Toulouse and I had my bicycle with me, on the train and I\nsuddenly jumped out of the train and it, I wanted to leave the bicycle at the station.\nAnd my father jumped after me and said, you crazy? I mean, he was right actually, it\nwas crazy. And he, he, he gave me a, a slap, he slapped me. And the stationmaster\ncame and said, what are you doing? You slapping this young lady? You mustn\u2019t do\nthat. And everybody was against my father and defended me. And so I told the\nstationmaster what I wanted to do, to leave the bicycle in Toulouse and he helped me.\nHe gave me a, he put it where the baggage is and he gave me a little receipt and I\nsent the receipt to somebody whom I told to give it to this other person and today I\nknow he never got it but, that\u2019s another story again. But anyway, I tried very hard\nand, and I also didn\u2019t want to leave Earnest (ph) because I was afraid he would not be\ntaken care of was parcels. Those were the basis for my guilt feelings actually and it\nstayed with me when I came here. So one of the first things I did was, when it was\nfounded, I went to the Free French Movement in New York. [end of side one, tape\none] One of the first things I did was, when it was founded, I went to the Free\nFrench Movement in New York and wanted, and told them I wanted to join them.\nThey, they recruited people to go to England and on, and I was told I was too young.\nBut until now, I don\u2019t believe that was the real reason. At this particular point I think\nI must have run into somebody who was an anti-Semite and didn\u2019t want me to join\nthem.",
        "Q: There were no Jews in, in this group?",
        "A: Very few and the reason I, I think this today, at that time I was just devastated. I\nthink this today is, you know how the came to New York at one time\nand the French Embassy gave him a reception, we attended. And the remarks he\nmade made me think that.",
        "Q: Was that the first time you\u2019d experienced anti-Semitism in America?",
        "A: Pretty much so, oh it\u2019s a very good question. I really have not experienced,\npersonally, anti-Semitism in America. Maybe because I, in New York, maybe of\nNew York, if I would have been sent to another region maybe I would have. But in\nNew York? No.",
        "Q: When, when did you become a citizen? American citizen?",
        "A: Well, we, just about five years after the arrival. As soon as possible.",
        "Q: Did you feel as though you were then an American? Or did you feel that before?\nOr did it take awhile? Or did you ever?",
        "A: Lask myself that. I, I feel like I\u2019m an international person, an international citizen.\nEspecially, since the United Nations started. I, I, I was very glad about the start of\nthe United Nations and it sort of fitted my personality. As a matter of fact, I don\u2019t\nknow if you remember but, no, the, the United, first United Nations session were in a\ncampus of Hunter College in the Bronx. And I went there and I was completely\nenthusiastic about the whole organization and of, when I looked for a job after I\ngraduated from school, was the first thing, I went to the United Nations. But like\nevery other of these organizations which I didn\u2019t realize, is you needed somebody to\npush you if you wanted a job. I mean you needed to know somebody and I just\nwalked in and applied and of course, I never got one. But I was very disappointed\nnot to get one.",
        "Q: What did you study at Hunter College?",
        "A: I, I prepared myself exactly for that. I studied political science, philosophy and\nart. And in the, today this would be no, no problem but at that time, they came to me\nand said, art doesn\u2019t sit with that. Why you taking art? And I thought quickly and I\nsaid well what about a political cartoonist? And they said ah, yeah, you\u2019re right. And\nso I was allowed to take those three options. But I, I, I wouldn\u2019t, I wanted art for\nsomething entirely different reason. It\u2019s to me, art gives life another dimension. And\nit isn\u2019t cartoons that I was after, I was, my thought were that art 1s, well 1s, really the\nkind of life that I wanted to pursue.",
        "Q: And you did study at a art school in New York as well as going to Hunter?",
        "A: Exactly. I took classes at the Art Student\u2019s League immediately and then I stayed\nat the art school, art student\u2019s league as full time as monitor and after, after I had\nmore time. I, I, I changed from Hunter College day to Hunter College evening and\nwent to art school during the day.",
        "Q: And did you study painting?",
        "A: Painting. And drawing, from the model.",
        "Q: What were most of your subjects about? What were most of your paintings and\ndrawings about that point?",
        "A: People.",
        "Q: And do you feel as though that it was a, a way of expressing things that had\nhappened to you earlier during, during the war and during your escape from France?",
        "A: No. The, I, I did not take art as a means of translating realism. To me, art was the,\ngave the contact of the soul and maybe replaced what other people taken their\nreligion, religious experiences.",
        "Q: Can you tell me more about the reunion with Earnest in London?",
        "A: Oh, I, I came to England officially to visit my grandmother who lived there. And\nmy father came with me. It was not officially to visit Earnest but of course\neverybody knew I was going to visit Earnest. So the first thing I did was to fix a\nmeeting place and we met at a subway station, underground. And we threw into each\nother\u2019s arms. That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: How long had it been since you\u2019d seen him?",
        "A: I saw him the last time in 1940, 1940 and this was 1947.",
        "Q: And you had communicated by writing letters?",
        "A: Very few times.",
        "Q: What happened next?",
        "A: We got married seven days later. At the, where was it, Kensington.",
        "Q: Did you know that was gonna happen when you came?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know. No.",
        "Q: Were you surprised?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You must have thought about him an awful lot during that time.",
        "A: Oh yes. Oh yes. And as I said before, I mean, it, it left me great guilt feelings that\nI, I wasn\u2019t able to help him. We did send the packages soon as we came to Lisbon\nand he got it and then I sent a package from, as soon as I came to New York and\nEarnest says he never got it. And then we couldn\u2019t send anymore anyway.",
        "Q: Did you get to go on a honeymoon?",
        "A: Well, if you call it that. We had no money and so we went to a little room, rented\na little room in, in London. That was our honeymoon, wasn\u2019t very exciting maybe\nfrom the outside but for us, it was most exciting.",
        "Q: And how long did you stay in London together?",
        "A: Not too long because I wanted to claim him, to come to the United States as soon\nas possible. And also, that 1s perhaps, I had just gotten a job in New York at the New\nYork Public Library. And they had given me one week of leave and I had already\nextended it to two weeks. So I had to come back if I wanted to keep my job and it is\nvery important that I kept my job because I wanted to send money to Earnest. So, for\nthese reasons I didn\u2019t stay long at all. I returned to England, to excuse me to the\nUnited States and immediately claimed Earnest but I was still not citizen at the time.\nSo I had to wait \u201ctil I became citizen a few months later until he, he could really come\nas the wife of an American.",
        "Q: But he did come with you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Oh, he didn\u2019t, he stayed.",
        "A: Oh no, he couldn\u2019t. He had to wait for the visa. Oh no, he couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: And how long was that? Several months?",
        "A: Oh yes, it was, he only came in, in February of the next year.",
        "Q: What was that time like?",
        "A: Here?",
        "Q: In between?",
        "A: In between it was very hard, very hard but well compared to what went before, it\nwasn\u2019t as painful.",
        "Q: So you were working as, as a librarian. As a research...",
        "A: As, yes, in the, in the, in, in New York and that became my profession. I had not\ngone to library school before and only went to library school when I arrived in\nWashington at a much later, much later.",
        "Q: Can you talk about your career?",
        "A: Oh yes, I loved my career. I loved, I loved being a librarian. When I first worked\nin New York, I worked with the, the American government had sent to various\nlibraries the books that they captured in the various countries and wanted them to\ndeposit in various libraries, of course the first library was the Library of Congress.\nBut the New York Public Library was one of the chief libraries to receive these\nbounties also. So they had received an enormous amount of Nazi literature. And\nthey engaged me actually to sift through all that material and make it available and of\ncourse it was very interesting to me, to, to do that. So my first duty as a library\nassistant that I was, was already within the, the field of World War II literature.",
        "Q: You said it was very interesting, it must have been also somewhat difficult.",
        "A: It was difficult but it was, it explained a lot to me that had happened. The, it, it, it\nfilled gasps and it, it, I was, I worked together with actually with a lot of other people\nwho had similar backgrounds and we, we were constantly discussing our work. It\nwas a very interesting time.",
        "Q: Do you recall any one particular document or any piece of literature that you came\nacross that stands out?",
        "A: Hitler\u2019s Mien Kampf (ph). It was the first time that I came across it.",
        "Q: And you read the entire ...",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t read the entire, didn\u2019t, but enough to, to be impressed.",
        "Q: And what were your impressions?",
        "A: That he was a madman. And it was just not understandable to me, how a civilized\npeople, the, the people that I had known in Germany, would fall for such a madman.\nAnd it, this is really not, this is still not resolved, I think that question. Why people\naccept mad leaders and they still do it today. So, the duty of democracy in my\nopinion is to explain that very clearly.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s, it\u2019s still a question in your mind.",
        "A: It\u2019s, yeah, not a question, it\u2019s still a challenge.",
        "Q: You had said in the Washington Post that you, that you struggle to understand\nwhat happened during the Holocaust. Is this one of the things that...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That you?",
        "A: Yes, like how people can be so evil is my, I cannot understand it and I see it every\nday today. Until very recently, I, I couldn\u2019t accept it. I, I mean I, I was always\nidealistic. I always thought that the good will win. Now I\u2019m not so sure anymore. I,\npeople always sort of laughed at me when I maintained this attitude that, they called\nme naive and, and unrealistic and, and, I guess because I had experienced so many\ngood incidents that I firmly believed that the good will win out. I\u2019m afraid to say that\nI, I have to, I have my doubts today.",
        "Q: When did that attitude change?",
        "A: Very recently.",
        "Q: Any explanation?",
        "A: Seeing what\u2019s happening in this world and how people repeat the same errors,\nwhich I would call errors, the same errors that have, that I can document, exactly for\nthe same reasons.",
        "Q: For example, Bosnia.",
        "A: Yeah. Or Ruvana (ph) or everywhere in the whole world. The whole world.",
        "Q: But it\u2019s interesting that you felt for most of your life, very optimistic and hopeful.",
        "A: Yes. It...",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about where that came from? I mean did you, you were\nincredibly, I don\u2019t know, maybe blessed is the word you could use during your\nexperiences during the war. I mean, you, you managed to find your family amidst\nincredible chaos. That had to make you feel as though somehow there was a light\nshining on you.",
        "A: No I didn\u2019t take it so personal. I thought that there are so many good people to\nmake this possible. I mean, I didn\u2019t talk to you now about Varian Fry (ph) for\ninstance. He was my hero. I don\u2019t know if you know who he is. But Varian Fry\n(ph) was the person who, he, he was assigned by the Emergency Rescue Committee\nto distribute visas in France for the intellectuals and this is how we were saved by\nobtaining one of those out of quota visas. And, but the risks this man took. He was\nin danger every day of his, of his life while he worked tn, in Marseilles and to me, he,\nhe, he did it out of idealism, out of the conviction that he had to save people. And he,\nhe saved as many as he possibly could. And when he came back to the United States,\nthe world had forgotten him. It\u2019s very sad, finally, when we came to the United\nStates, my father wanted to write a biography of, of Varian Fry (ph) but he was not\nallowed to do it. He was told somebody else is writing it which, this biography has\nnever came out, so, it was very sad. It was sad also for my father because he admired\nhim and then finally, the, there was an exhibit about him and the United States\nMemorial Museum made an exhibit about Varian Fry and he\u2019s now being recognized\nand it, he, I think you will hear about him very shortly.",
        "Q: I wanted to go back to you and Earnest and...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Settling down and he finally was able to come to join you. Can you talk a little bit\nabout your, your early years and maybe sort of...",
        "A: Yes. We, the first thing was for him to, to me, to regain his self-esteem. He\nhadn\u2019t worked, he hadn\u2019t studied for all this time and I was concerned that he, he\nshould be given every opportunity possible so, but we had no money and so the first\nconcern was to, to have enough money to live independently. So he had to find a job\nand he took any old job, whatever it was, he didn\u2019t, a long series of short jobs that he\naccomplished in the first half-year of his stay in America and then we had enough\nmoney to, to rent a little apartment on mid-Manhattan. And actually apartment is a\nbig name for a room and a kitchenette. And then he joined the, I was very concerned\nthat he should go continue his studies and he, he went to the new school and he took\na scholarship and he, he then wrote a thesis and then the thesis was sent to many\ncolleges and universities so he could ask for scholarships. And he did receive a,\nseveral scholarships and he choose to go to Johns Hopkins. And that of course meant\nthat we had to leave New York and that meant that I had to leave my job. I might say\nat this point, this is the story of my life. I had to leave my jobs whenever it just\nstarted to bloom, whenever the first blooms came out, I had to leave because my\nhusband was transferred or for such reasons. And today, I know that many married\ncouples split up because of this situation which doesn\u2019t allow the woman to continue\nher career. And, but at that time, there was no question. And so I went with Earnest\nto Baltimore and I got a job in the Veteran\u2019s Administration Hospital Library. And\nthat made me change to a specialization that I had then for quite awhile, which 1s\nmedical librarianship which is a class, sort of, in itself. We settled in, in Sparrow\u2019s\nPoint, it, it, and Earnest went to Baltimore every day and I went to my hospital\nlibrary. And he started his Ph.D. in economics. He choose economics. And after\nawhile, I said Earnest, we have to start a family. This is, I\u2019m getting impatient about\nthat. And so, he had to look for a job because he, he, he did get the scholarship and\nhe did have a very, very small contribution for his teaching when he did, 1t was sort\nof a teaching scholarship. And he taught a few classes in Johns Hopkins, but was\nnothing one could live on. So he traveled to Washington and he actually got a job in\nWashington and we moved again. And as a matter of fact, I had taken, I had started\nto go to library school that summer in New York. I, I took off for a session of the\nsummer school at Columbia University and took medical librarianship and my\nteacher there came from Washington and was chief of reference in the Armed Forces\nMedical Library which is the predecessor of the National Library of Medicine. And\nso when Earnest found his job in Washington, I went to see her and asked her if she\nwould consider hiring me and as I had had an A in her course, she offered me a\nposition in the reference library of the Armed Forces Medical Library which was\nlocated at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology which is the forerunner of the...",
        "Q: NIH?",
        "A: No of, in, the, for the army, Walter Reed (ph).",
        "Q: Walter Reed (ph).",
        "A: Yes and, the, the history of the growth of medical librarianship is very interesting\nand very influential because as you mentioned NIH, I mean NIH would be much less\nof what it is without the National Library of Medicine next door and actually it had\nan, it\u2019s own library which adjoined later.",
        "Q: You talked about wanting to have a family.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you have children?",
        "A: Yes, actually I was rather unlucky. I had miscarriages. And then I\ndid have a successful pregnancy and had a girl. I named her Nicole, Nicole Andrea\nand she was born in \u201953.",
        "Q: And is she still alive?",
        "A: Very much so.",
        "Q: Okay, I wanted to make sure, I hadn\u2019t heard. And what, what is she doing?\nWhere does she live?",
        "A: She is a teacher of biology. She studied biology and she fell in love with a, a\nBritish citizen and married him and he, he was not treating her right. He was beating\nher and she had to leave him. And so she had a very unhappy time. She passed away\nunhappy time. She had a baby at that time and my granddaughter and she, but she\nstayed in England. And so today she is in England. She had remarried and is\ndivorced and now she\u2019s teaching biology in, in excellent school in\nBrighton.",
        "Q: When did you first talk to her about, or tell her about your experiences as a young,\nas a, as a girl and as a teenager, during the war and before?",
        "A: a good question because she grew up after she, after she was four\nyears old, a little bit like, I just remember I was four years old first time I, she, my\nhusband is assigned his first foreign service appointment. My husband\u2019s position\nwas in the Department of Agriculture when he came and the, he, he will tell you\nabout his position so I won\u2019t go into this. That, he became then attached to the\nForeign Agricultural Service and he was sent overseas as assistant attach\u00e9 and his\nfirst assignment was in Germany. So that was not easy. In, to answer your question,\nwhat do you tell your little girl about the country she\u2019s just about to go to school in?\nAnd that was very difficult. We lived, when we came to Germany, this, the, there\nwas a whole compound in Bonn. We were attached to the embassy, right? And there\nwas a whole compound in, in Bonn called , It was called the golden\nghetto by the local population because it, the American embassy had beautiful\ngrounds and a lovely school and a wonderful restaurants and...",
        "A:",
        "Q: Oh yes. Do you want to take a break? Okay. Do you want to finish up this story\nor?",
        "A: Yeah, finish it up and ,\nEnd of tape 1.\nTape 2",
        "Q: You\u2019re, you\u2019re talking about, tell how difficult it was to tell your daughter about\nyour experiences in, in, in Germany.",
        "A: Yes, , yes. She, she was going to the American school in\nPittusdorf (ph), and at the same time, we wanted her, in this, we wanted her to learn\nGerman. Because we felt that she should not feel that she\u2019s living in a sort of\nseparate ghetto. And the school itself did not teach German very intensively. All the\nsubjects were in English and they had a little German but it wasn\u2019t very much. So we\nhad somebody come over to teach her German, to prepare her for it, normal transition\nif she, she wanted to, to go out of this golden ghetto. And we did not at this time, tell\nher about our previous experience in Germany but it was very difficult to keep quiet\nabout it.",
        "Q: So when, when did you finally talk to your daughter about the war experience?",
        "A: Well, to come back what I had said, I felt that as a such a young child, she could\nnot deal with this information, she would hate the country she is in, she would hate\nevery individual for doing what they did to their parents, that\u2019s the way I imagined\nshe would react because that\u2019s certainly the way I would react if I had heard this from\nmy parents. And it would not be a happy life for her to have to deal with this\nproblem, with this psychological problem so we postponed to tell her when she was\nold enough to deal with it and we told her and it was a great shock to her. And, but\nshe, she was very loyal and she, she felt very much with us and she, that\u2019s the way it\nis today.",
        "Q: How old was she?",
        "A: When we told her? About, I\u2019d say, ten, eleven.",
        "Q: And you think she understood?",
        "A: Yes. I, I don\u2019t know if you can ever understand so.",
        "Q: How was that for you to be in Germany?",
        "A: Very difficult. Very different, that\u2019s why we came to this conclusion. It was very\ndifficult, I, but we made some very good friends that are, are Germans and we still\nknow them and it, 1t made me realize that you should not generalize, that as a matter\nof fact, we met a lot of people who were in the Resistance. We, we met a group of\nthe, from the, Shtowfumbergs (ph) that had tried to kill Hitler. We met other\nResistance fighters. There was as a matter of fact, a whole group of them in\nGermany. And it was very impressive to talk to them.",
        "Q: How long were you in Germany\u201d?",
        "A: We were twice as a matter of fact. We were first for, \u2019'd say, three years, a little\nmore, maybe. Then we were called back for a year and then we were assigned again\nfor two years.",
        "Q: And what years were those?",
        "A: That was, so long ago, sixty...",
        "Q: It, it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t remember, just generally in the sixties.",
        "A: In the sixties, yes. In the late fifties and early sixties.",
        "Q: And did you experience any anti-Semitism there, in Germany?",
        "A: In Germany? Yes. Not personally but we did hear anti-Semitic remarks. Not\naddressed to us at all but when you were in a restaurant, you overheard conversations\nbetween two ex-Nazis, obviously SS people, and you understood what they were\nsaying sometimes. It was very hard not to react.",
        "Q: Did you ever go back to your neighborhood in Vienna where you grew up?",
        "A: Oh yes, recently. We wanted to show this neighborhood to my daughter and we\nintend to show it to my grandchild.",
        "Q: What was that like for you?",
        "A: Like coming to a foreign country, actually. Not countries, nothing, the, the streets\nhad changed and the environment had changed, that\u2019s what I mean by that.",
        "Q: What kind of emotions did it bring up?",
        "A: The, the emotions that any injustice that you had to live through would bring up. I\nfelt I had been unjustly, I felt is not the word, I had been unjustly treated and so did\nmy entire family and this is how you react to that. Today I think of the black people\nin America and I can understand their anger, perhaps better than other people can.\nEven though their anger is not constructive at this point. You don\u2019t choose not to be\nangry when you are.",
        "Q: Do you still have a lot of anger?",
        "A: It\u2019s not an anger at people, it\u2019s the anger of the in, injustice.",
        "Q: Towards, it\u2019s at, I\u2019m not sure I quite understand. It\u2019s that is not at the people...",
        "A: The anger is directed against the injustice of, of, of life, of the situation one has to\nface.",
        "Q: Do you feel as though you were deprived of, of large portion of your childhood?",
        "A: It\u2019s not a matter of feeling, it\u2019s the truth. It certainly is true. But because it was\nalso partly because of the war, I recognize that other people were also deprived who\nwere not in the same situation such as the American soldier, so, it\u2019s not a unique\nsituation.",
        "Q: How do you think that experience sort of shapes who you are?",
        "A: It entirely shaped who I am. I, I\u2019m not a psychiatrist but isn\u2019t any experience\nshaping the person entirely, and even the unconscious? So, I mean that is always\nwhat defines you?",
        "Q: What decisions and choices in your life do you think were made as an outgrowth\nof, of, of the war experience? For example, your marriage with Earnest or, or your\nchoice of your career? How much of those things were influenced by the war\nexperience?",
        "A: Well my, the, the greatest influence of my war experience certainly is to apply for\nthe job at the Holocaust Memorial Museum. I, I had up till then worked to, with the\nmedical library field. My last job was in Geneva, in Switzerland where I built up the\nmedical library of the university there and a colleague of mine drew my attention to\nthe advertisement in, in one of the Washington papers for that, they advertised for the\njob of the librarian of the Holocaust Memorial Museum. And I thought I was well\nqualified for what they asked and I applied and obviously they agreed with my desire\nto work there. And the experience I had gathered contributed of course immensely to\nthis job.",
        "Q: How many years did you work there?",
        "A: I got the position in \u201989. And I resigned in \u201995.",
        "Q: And in what ways did it contribute to your understanding of the Holocaust?",
        "A: In what way did?",
        "Q: Working there.",
        "A: Working there contribute \u2014 every day. Every minute of my work I learned\nsomething new and it was fascinating for me to work with the material I worked\nwith. And to build this library, I, I, when I came we had just a few hundred books on,\non a few shelves and, and some office on \u201cL\u201d Street and when I left, we had a full-\nfledged library which was my joy to build up. Also from an architectural point of\nview since I had had that experience in Geneva, working directly with the architects,\nI, I had also this opportunity here and I worked very closely with Freat (ph) who is\nthe architect of the museum and who is also a refugee child. And so we had a lot in,\nin common and it was a great experience. We could, to build up this library from\nscratch.",
        "Q: Why did you want to work at the Holocaust Memorial Museum?",
        "A: Because of my past experience. You asked were there anything in my decision, in\nmy career decisions was related to my past experience and that is the reason I applied.\nI felt now finally I can do something to, to bring this part of my life out.",
        "Q: Is there, is there any one, I asked you this about your work at the New York\nPublic Library, is there any one instance or moment or document or anything that,\nthat stands out during your time at the Holocaust Memorial that you came across that\nhad a profound impact on you?",
        "A: Well, yes. There is a book published by Klassfelds (ph) which describes the\ntransport to Auschwitz and is very comprehensive and one day we, when it came out,\nof course we acquired it as soon as possible and as, when it arrived, I opened it to the\nname Earnest Koenig and here described when and under what circumstances\nEarnest was brought to Drancy and from Drancy to, I mean it didn\u2019t, not Washington,\nDrancy to Auschwitz and it didn\u2019t describe him. It only mentioned his name but it\ndescribed the transport.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t know this?",
        "A: [had never seen it before.",
        "Q: And what impact did that have on you?",
        "A: It, it\u2019s a shaking up experience. I, I, now in the library, the majority of questions\nof people who come in now are trying to trace what happened to their ancestors and I\nwas obliged to show them and have them, have the same experience that I had and it\nwas very difficult for me to do that but I had to. I , working when you\nwork with people in the reference and I knew exactly how they would feel when they\nsaw the names of their loved ones.",
        "Q: Had Earnest talked to you much about that experience?",
        "A: No, he and I, and, and perhaps that was a mistake. I took that for his not wanting\nto talk about it and I do not know whether I was correct in this assumption. I, I just\nassumed that if he wished to talk it, he would start the conversation on, on the subject\nand I was not going to initiate or push or, I was always there to listen if he wished to\nopen up. And it was very slow in coming.",
        "Q: And has he since?",
        "A: Yes. Oh yes.",
        "Q: In the past",
        "A: Oh yes, but, but not early on.",
        "Q: Do you feel as though you and Earnest have sort of a bond or a connection\nbecause of, your experiences are different during the war but you, you did have, were\npersecuted?",
        "A: Yes of course, certainly, one does have such a unique bond.",
        "Q: Do you consider yourself a survivor?",
        "A: Iam a survivor. But so are other people. I mean if you are, if you survive a fire,\nyou\u2019re a survivor. So, I mean this, the, the, the term survivor today has broadened\nenormously. And on the one hand, on the other hand, it sort of particularized by a\ncertain group. So I, it\u2019s hard to answer, do you, I think I know what you mean?",
        "Q: I was actually getting at whether you and Earnest agree on, on that term, whether\nyou both agree whether you\u2019re a survivor because in the classic sense.",
        "A: Oh, you, I tell you something. I have found out that the people who come from\nAuschwitz think that that term is sort of reserved for Auschwitz survivors. I\u2019ve met a\nlot since then and they do not consider me a survivor. So on people or maybe also in\nperhaps other of the death camps, think the same way. When I say Auschwitz it\nmight include the other four, five death, extermination, I mean extermination camps.",
        "Q: Do you and Earnest disagree about that at all?",
        "A: No, I, I, I think his experience was vastly more wrenching than mine. I, I mean I\ndidn\u2019t have to watch people hang at 12 o\u2019clock in the morning and stay there and\nthen maybe be called as to be shot.",
        "Q: Do you, do you ever have dreams or nightmares about the war?",
        "A: Actually, no.",
        "Q: That\u2019s good.",
        "A: Do, do most people that you speak, I have never asked this question, or have been\nasked this question so I don\u2019t know what other people answer.",
        "Q: The two other interviews, I remember one specifically said that he didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t\nremember about the other one.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: I asked you about how the experience affected the choices you made. Wondering\nwhether it, what influence it have on your spirituality?",
        "A: I think we talked about it inasmuch as my experience showed me the goodness of\npeople and that has, had a lasting influence.",
        "Q: You had said when you came to America that you felt somewhat guilty, that you\nhad, I guess left behind people, do you still have those feelings?",
        "A: No. I mean the people that I left today are mostly have their own careers and 1s\nonly one of the ones that I had left behind died. He joined the Resistance and got\nshot. All the others survived. Almost, I might add, strangely enough since it was\nvery, they had very different experiences after I left. Very different, some went\nillegally to Switzerland, some went to the Resistance, some went, came illegally to\nParis, went back to Paris and hid there. It is, it\u2019s almost unbelievable that none of\nthem got hurt.",
        "Q: Have you ever seen, seen any of them since? Or spoken with them?",

        "Q: So there\u2019s some in Virginia here?",
        "A: There\u2019s, as a matter of fact, some not in Virginia but in Maryland and some in\nNew York and, but we get together and we talk on the telephone all the time and we\nknow of each other and we support each other and when, and there were reunions.\nWe went to a reunion, I think it was \u00b088, I\u2019m not mistaken, in\nLeshombon (ph) and there\u2019s going to be one this year in Leshombon (ph) for the sad\nreason to bury Maktotottmay (ph) and so we see each other very frequently.",
        "Q: And that time seems like it left a profound and lasting impression and impact on\nyour life, that time 1n Leshombon (ph).",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "Q: Why do you think that is?",
        "A: Because it\u2019s, it\u2019s a most unusual story. The, that a whole village, in fact I think it\u2019s\nthe only time an entire region, an entire region decided not to cooperate with the\npower in, of the government, to oppose the government in, in such a threatening\nsituation to them, their own lives.",
        "Q: You had said...",

        "Q: You told me at lunch that you consider yourself a pacifist. What, what do you\nthink that\u2019s, what do you think that\u2019s an outgrowth of? Where did that, I mean, was\nthat from your family or from the Quakers?",
        "A: It, it must be a combination but I just hate to see people be committed to a\nsituation which they cannot control, it\u2019s beyond their control. And in war, you give\nup the control of your destiny.",
        "Q: You had also said that your pacifism sometimes comes into conflict with, with\nwars that might be just.",

        "Q: I don\u2019t know whether I have any other questions for you? Is there anything else\nyou\u2019d wanted to say? Guess one of the things that I had asked you, in the questions\nId given you earlier was about the, whether you thought the experiences that you and\nEarnest had been through ever caused any difficulties in your relationship at all? It\u2019s a\ntough question to answer.",
        "A: Could you be more precise?",
        "Q: Well, that, that you had both been through such harrowing times that, whether you\nthought 1t meant that it was hard to get through to him or it affected your\ncommunication or that one of you didn\u2019t want to talk about something.",
        "A: No I would related it to the past experience if we, like all people who live together\nfor 50 years have differences of opinion, then it is more due to the change of the\nculture in which you live in that has occurred over those 50 years and I\u2019m particularly\nreferring to the change of women\u2019s rights for instance. And I am for complete\nlegality, always was, even before it was fashionable.",
        "A:",
        "A: The legality of women and men, meant something to me ever since I can\nremember but at that time, it was sort of unusual and, and it wasn\u2019t an issue in, 1n our\nrelationship. However, I, now that women not only demand equal treatment but also\ndemand, not only equal treatment before the law, but ask for equal treatment in any\nsituation, this might constitute sometimes a point of difference.",
        "Q: I guess my earlier question was, was sort of based on the, the phenomenon where\nmen who\u2019ve gone through experiences of war are, don\u2019t like to talk about them.\nThey sort of keep it very hidden and reserved and I just wondered whether that\nEarnest had had that with his experience and that, it result...",
        "A: What kind of, are you thinking of something in particular?",
        "Q: Oh his, well his experience at, at the concentration camp and, and not wanting to\ntalk about that and whether that made you feel somehow like you didn\u2019t understand\na part of him, or didn\u2019t know a part of him. I just wondered whether there had been\nany of that at all.",
        "A: Yes, I mentioned it before, that he was reluctant to talk about it. And I was\nreluctant to ask and I never knew whether he wanted me to ask first. And that was\nthe difficulty, we, we really didn\u2019t talk about that until he, he, he seemed to become a\nlittle more comfortable with the situation.",
        "Q: And why did it change? Why did he become more comfortable?",
        "A: I think time, time, probably. And then his wish to talk about it became stronger\nand then my, also my family encouraged him to talk about it when we visited them.\n[end of side one, tape 2]",
        "Q: Did that bring you closer?",
        "A: We were very close to begin with so I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think you, you could\nsay that because we were very close at the start.",
        "Q: Was it a positive experience that, that he began to talk and...",
        "A: Oh yes, I was very glad that he did. Very glad. Yes, it gave me a great deal of\ninsight and well like, you might find out, you might find that asking people the things\nthat you ask gives you an insight that you didn\u2019t have before and adds to your\nknowledge of this world. It surely does.",
        "Q: And did you discover whether it was the reason he didn\u2019t say anything, was it\nbecause he was waiting for you to ask or?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t, no, I think now he did.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t have any other questions. If there\u2019s more that you want to say, that...",
        "A: I would have to think about it.",
        "Q: Do you want to look over your notes?",
        "A: If not, that\u2019s okay. Well, we were talking about, that you talk, you speak about the\nHolocaust a lot these days. Can you, can you tell me what, what it is that you do\nand, and how often you, you talk about your experiences? And you, we, we talked\nabout before we started recording that, for a long time you didn\u2019t talk, you didn\u2019t\ndiscuss it much, you didn\u2019t talk to other people and talk publicly and now, and now\nyou do. Why, why is there that change? Why 1s that change?",
        "A: Well we have, ever since I\u2019m working at the museum, I bring home a lot of\nmaterial and also my husband has started to write his memoirs and that 1s probably\nthe, the main reason, because after writing his memoirs he asks me to read them and\nto give my opinion and that\u2019s how we start about. His memoirs by the way, are not\njust on the Holocaust at all, his memoirs are about his entire life which includes his\nvery happy childhood and after the war, his experience in foreign service. But of\ncourse, in the middle of these happy stories, is his experience of Auschwitz and he is\nextremely interested anything that relates to the Holocaust and its origin. And so we,\nwe come very interested in the entire question of why the question of anti-Semitism\nand the history of anti-Semitism and in particularly the history of anti-Semitism in\nGermany and Austria and in France. And that\u2019s a very vast subject if you really want\nto get knowledgeable about it. The, it also refers you to things that have not\ndisappeared and are, are, are reappearing in our days now. We have a very strong\nnationalistic party in every one of these countries, especially in France and in Austria,\nwhich is frightening.",
        "Q: Do, do you feel as though it\u2019s sort of a duty of yours, to, to speak more openly\nabout the Holocaust and help other people understand it? I mean is there, do you feel\nas though now you have more of a, kind of a mission, or that there\u2019s more of a need?",
        "A: Yes, because we are dying out. The people who can testify. There are very few\nleft and each time you talk about a subject, one or more details come up that have not\ncome up before, which might be helpful in writing this history. As an example, I just\nlearned two days ago about a happening that might be interesting to mention in this\nconnection. In, there was the, the big question in France was why the was the village\nof Leshombon (ph) spared and we never had really an answer and I don\u2019t think that\nthere is an answer right now either that is hundred percent. But one of our colleagues\nwas caught by the French police and put into a bus in order that he be transported into\na camp or we didn\u2019t know where of course. And he was all of a sudden released.\nAnd of course he jumped from the bus and disappeared but the, we all had theories\non why this had happened and his theory was is because he was so young, he was 12\nyears at the time. And the answer appeared two days ago, it wasn\u2019t at all because he\nwas too young, because as we know now, very young children were brought into\nconcentration camps. It was because the mayor of the city had written to Pitton (ph)\nsaying that the children, the Jewish children of Leshombon (ph) have, are under the\nprotection of the Swiss. Sicroa (ph) Swiss. And therefore cannot be touched. He\nhad never received an answer but apparently this was noted by the authorities. They\nmust have just of notified the police there and the little boy was left. This note, this\nletter by the mayor became known only very recently when the archives of the Red\nCross, Swiss Red Cross was finally made available which was very recently. And I\nexpect that such incidences will come up daily now that the archives of, of the former\nSoviet Union, the archives from all over the occupied countries where the German\nGestapo was the government, are coming up now. And they had been hidden before.",

        "A: Yes. She, her father was a pediatrician and she grew up in a very middle-class\nenvironment, very comfortable in the first district of Vienna. She, she, they were a\nvery close family. Her, her, she had a sister, a younger sister and she went to school\nin Vienna and actually I went to the same school late. And she, she helped my\ngrandfather a little bit in, with the patients and always was interested helping the sick.\nShe, she was very happy child and by the way, I can show you the painting of my\ngreat, great, great-grandmother which is hanging here on the wall.\natmosphere was like in your home, when you were growing up. Do, how, I know\nyour father was political and I don\u2019t know if that was true of the whole household.\nCan you talk a little about that?",
        "A: I was born and lived in the first four years of my life in Vienna, in a,\ncomfortably apartment in Vienna\u2019s eighth district. My father\u2019s father was a lawyer\nand he had died a few months before my arrival. And it, my father was an editor at\nthe newspaper and my mother managed the household. My parents loved music,\npeople and discussions and they went out a lot, and, at, as well as having frequent\nget-together at their place. Their friends were writers and artists and the atmosphere\nat home was always very lively. My father worked at night so when he came home\nin the morning to sleep, I had to be very quiet. His paper appeared in the morning\nand, so he had to work all night. And they liked if I even left the house so I wouldn\u2019t\ndisturb him. Before my father had, he had graduated from law school and this\nenabled him to be the newspaper\u2019s responsible editor. A position which required him\nto represent the newspaper in court whenever it was sued. He also, also specialized\non reports relating to international subjects such as the League of Nations. As, as the\nworld passed the period of economic depression, my father lost his position in 1927.\nHe was appointed an editor to several publications in Berlin, and relocated his family\nto that city. I started going to elementary school in Berlin, Villmustof (ph), where\nwe lived until 1933. And returned to Vienna after Hitler\u2019s victory. It was an, I went\nto an all-girls\u2019 school and we had religious instruction once a week. We were given\nbible instruction and we were encouraged to make plays (ph) about the lives of the\ncharacters in the Bible and, such as, for instance, Esther and Ruth. In Berlin, my\nfather worked as and, responsible editor at the Montock-Morgan (ph) whose editor in\nchief was Leo , aS well as at the Togaboo (ph) and founded the\neconomic review there . In 1931, he was sent on a reporter\u2019s trip around\nthe world, visiting Russia, Manchuria, North China, Korea, Japan and the USA.\nThere is a write-up about him in the New York Times, July the 5\" and from 1931 to\n1933, he was co-editor in chief of the Daily . My mother disliked\nBerlin thoroughly, missing the charm of her daily existence. The social life was\nmuch reduced though we still had a lot of visits from family and friends. In March,\n1933, we returned to Vienna, except for my father who wanted to finish some\nprofessional obligations, but was obliged to make a sudden departure when he\nescaped arrest by the Gestapo, May 1933. From then on, he was blacklisted as an\nopponent to the Nazi Regime.",

        "A: Yes, I, I listened. I didn\u2019t say anything but I listened.",
        "A: The, the, I must say that there\u2019s a vast generational change in the attitude of\nchildren, children were rarely even permitted to take part but we, we were very\ninterested and usually just listening behind the door, too. And, but we weren\u2019t asked\nabout our opinions.",

And she just lived around the corner and in 1933, when the, the, Hitler came\nto power, he was immediately arrested and it was terrible for me. It was in fact, on\nthe day of my birthday and it was a terrible shock and he was released but he took off\nvery, at that, just at that moment he took off for Israel with his family. It was very\ndifficult for him to emigrate because of his paintings and how to take them along and\nsafeguard them, but that\u2019s a long story.",

        "A: Oh.",
        "A: How we got into the United States?",
        "A: That was very strange experience because we had to leave Europe during 1942, at\nthe time when the transatlantic travel was very rare and we were extremely fortunate\nto get a little space on one of the rare transports that went from Portugal to the United\nStates. But by no means directly because they, the ship tried to avoid the mine, the\nmines of the ocean and we went first to Cuba then to the Bermudas and finally, we\nended up at Virginia Beach but we didn\u2019t know we were, where we were. We just\nended up and the immigration officers came on board and processed us on board and\nthen when finally we were allowed to leave the when they agreed, they\nwere afraid that the boat contained spies and or, any other people they didn\u2019t wish to\ncome on, to the United States.

        "A: Yes. Then of course they took it off in the train.",
        "A: In the train they took it off because the train was black. You couldn\u2019t see anything\nanyway. And they gave us sandwiches and I, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget my\nastonishment at the white bread that was given to us. During the war and I thought\nthis was a special welcome gift.",
        "A: Your daily bread. And then we were, when the train left, we weren\u2019t told where\nwe were going and we landed, not landed, we arrived at New York City, Penn\nStation, 34\" Street, the doors were opened. We were told you\u2019re on your own and\nhere we were.",
        "A: Well, first of all, we didn\u2019t quite know what to do. Here we were, we weren\u2019t\nprepared for, for that and we had very little money and so we had to decide what to\ndo. So we actually decided to split up because, and everybody, we all had friends\nand family here in New York, but they had no clue that we had arrived. And so we\ndidn\u2019t want to overwhelm any, any one in particular so we said it\u2019s best we go each to\none person and then maybe they can put us up and that\u2019s what happened. And they\ndid put us up very kindly, each one of us separately.",
        "A: Yeah, I walked the first day, already, on my arrival. I walked from 34\u201d Street to, I\nthink 86\" Street on the west side. I was overwhelmed and I must say the, the word\nfreedom became something of meaning. It, you were free to go without showing a\npaper, without identifying yourself. You were free. That was my, my really, the first\nimpact.",

        "A: No, I, I loved it. It and I, and that for me is the essence of America. It stayed with\nme. I, I, now even more shocked than a person who hasn\u2019t experienced that at the\nnecessity of writing the social security on everything you, you hand in now. Before\nwhen I arrived in the United States, you needed nothing, absolutely nothing. You\ngave your name, everybody believed you and if, if, if you, if they asked you do you\nhave an identification and you took out an envelope from a letter that you got\nyesterday, that was sufficient. And that was, that, I thought was marvelous.",
        "A: Exactly, exactly.",
        "A: Actually, nobody asked me anything. The only person who realized that was a\nteacher who, whose job actually it was to deal with children whose mother tongue 1s\nnot English. And she was, she knew it, I think, about my background and she was\nvery kind. And very helpful. She collected clothes that I needed but she didn\u2019t let\nme know that she gave it to me. She just, it appeared where I was sitting or she just\ngave, she never wanted to be thanked for it but I knew she must have been, she had\ncollected it. And, and mostly marvelous clothes that I had never even had before,\nsuch beautiful clothes. And the, the co-student, my students, colleagues never asked\nme anything. And the fact that my English was very poor of course, was very\nnoticeable and in fact, it was non-existent in, in the first few weeks. I learned fast but\nit, the first few weeks it was non-existent and so you tended to go, we had to eat at\nschool, right? And so you tended to go and sit with children that you could talk with.\nSo a little French table was sort of brought together with little refugees from\nBelgium and France and we got to know each other because of the language.",
        "A: I, these children were Jewish mostly, my little friends, yes.",
        "A: Oh, we, we told each other our stories, yes.",
        "A: Yes. I remember my Belgian friend came from a diamond family and my, and I,\nand my French friend came from a doctor\u2019s family.",
        "A: No, because it, I wasn\u2019t asked no. The only thing, where I\ntalked about actually is when I left Europe I was given certain letters and documents\nby a variety of people to bring to the United States which I kept on me with great\ncare. And amongst it was a, a request by the Truckmay (ph) family for me to contact\nthe Quaker in the United States, that was very important because the Quakers had\ngiven their support to the Luchombon (ph) Project and to, and Pastor Truckmay (ph)\nwas entirely dependent on their financial help. And so that was one of the first things\nI did it, was to go to the New York Quaker office and they were very interested and\nthey asked me to come to a meeting and they asked me to give a little talk on my\nexperience and, and they, they were fascinated by what had happened to their\nsupport, to hear about it from firsthand. And there\u2019s a little story, aside, 1s a lady\ncame up to me and she said, would I agree to stay with her during the summer and be\na companion to her daughter. And that was in springtime and so that seemed very far\naway and I agreed of course, yes I would. And then when I did spend time with that\nfamily in the summertime, what she really wanted me to do is to teach her child\nGerman. And to me, that was terrible. I didn\u2019t want to speak German. That was the\nlanguage of the enemy. But I didn\u2019t want to disappoint her either. So I did teach the\nchild German but it was, it was a great insight to my person, in a way. And I, I\nmention this because nobody would think of that, I don\u2019t think. You, you don\u2019t think\nyou, this little girl speak, this not little, this young girl speaks German so why\nshouldn\u2019t she speak German with, I, I can understand her now very well but at that\ntime, 1t made me very unhappy.",
        "A: I, it\u2019s hard to answer. I cannot give you a time. There was no particular time\nwhen I started to talk about it. I was very occupied with doing my schoolwork and I,\nwithout being asked, I would not have started anything.",
        "A: And, and nobody, nobody asked.",
        "A: That\u2019s an excellent question. They, in the United States, the United States were\npreoccupied with the war and the war effort. And they were fighting the war, they\nwere not, I believe, interested in what happened before. Perhaps, maybe.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.\nguilty, personally. Also, I felt guilty that we were saved. Made me feel guilty. I felt\nguilty that I left France at this particular time. So, I might mention something that I\nnever mentioned before. It, 1t didn\u2019t occur to me to mention it, I guess or I forgot.\nBut just before we left France, somebody contacted me and asked me to distribute\nanti-Nazi literature. I must say today they give it a name but at that time, we didn\u2019t\nthink of ourself, neither working for the Resistance or Underground, we, we, didn\u2019t\noccur to us to think in those terms. And they, and they, today they give this a name.\nAnd they call it a coolyay (ph) but I just was a young girl on the bicycle who\ndistributed this literature. And, and I, I, I personally did it in the streets of Toulouse\nand it was very dangerous but I don\u2019t think it ever occurred to me to think that I did\nsomething dangerous. The only thing I knew was that I had to keep my mouth shut,\nnever tell anybody what I was doing, not my parents, not my friends, nobody. It was\nzero. You had to do what you were asked to do without asking any questions. And I\nfelt I was doing something important. And to leave that gave me this guilt feeling.\nAnd also, I, I had something very rare, a bicycle. And I wanted to leave it with this\norganization and so when we escaped from France to Spain and we were on the train,\nthis train stopped in Toulouse and I had my bicycle with me, on the train and I\nsuddenly jumped out of the train and it, I wanted to leave the bicycle at the station.\nAnd my father jumped after me and said, you crazy? I mean, he was right actually, it\nwas crazy. And he, he, he gave me a, a slap, he slapped me. And the stationmaster\ncame and said, what are you doing? You slapping this young lady? You mustn\u2019t do\nthat. And everybody was against my father and defended me. And so I told the\nstationmaster what I wanted to do, to leave the bicycle in Toulouse and he helped me.\nHe gave me a, he put it where the baggage is and he gave me a little receipt and I\nsent the receipt to somebody whom I told to give it to this other person and today I\nknow he never got it but, that\u2019s another story again. But anyway, I tried very hard\nand, and I also didn\u2019t want to leave Earnest (ph) because I was afraid he would not be\ntaken care of was parcels. Those were the basis for my guilt feelings actually and it\nstayed with me when I came here. So one of the first things I did was, when it was\nfounded, I went to the Free French Movement in New York. [end of side one, tape\none] One of the first things I did was, when it was founded, I went to the Free\nFrench Movement in New York and wanted, and told them I wanted to join them.\nThey, they recruited people to go to England and on, and I was told I was too young.\nBut until now, I don\u2019t believe that was the real reason. At this particular point I think\nI must have run into somebody who was an anti-Semite and didn\u2019t want me to join\nthem.",
        "A: Very few and the reason I, I think this today, at that time I was just devastated. I\nthink this today is, you know how the came to New York at one time\nand the French Embassy gave him a reception, we attended. And the remarks he\nmade made me think that.",
        "A: Pretty much so, oh it\u2019s a very good question. I really have not experienced,\npersonally, anti-Semitism in America. Maybe because I, in New York, maybe of\nNew York, if I would have been sent to another region maybe I would have. But in\nNew York? No.",
        "A: Well, we, just about five years after the arrival. As soon as possible.",
        "A: Lask myself that. I, I feel like I\u2019m an international person, an international citizen.\nEspecially, since the United Nations started. I, I, I was very glad about the start of\nthe United Nations and it sort of fitted my personality. As a matter of fact, I don\u2019t\nknow if you remember but, no, the, the United, first United Nations session were in a\ncampus of Hunter College in the Bronx. And I went there and I was completely\nenthusiastic about the whole organization and of, when I looked for a job after I\ngraduated from school, was the first thing, I went to the United Nations. But like\nevery other of these organizations which I didn\u2019t realize, is you needed somebody to\npush you if you wanted a job. I mean you needed to know somebody and I just\nwalked in and applied and of course, I never got one. But I was very disappointed\nnot to get one.",
        "A: I, I prepared myself exactly for that. I studied political science, philosophy and\nart. And in the, today this would be no, no problem but at that time, they came to me\nand said, art doesn\u2019t sit with that. Why you taking art? And I thought quickly and I\nsaid well what about a political cartoonist? And they said ah, yeah, you\u2019re right. And\nso I was allowed to take those three options. But I, I, I wouldn\u2019t, I wanted art for\nsomething entirely different reason. It\u2019s to me, art gives life another dimension. And\nit isn\u2019t cartoons that I was after, I was, my thought were that art 1s, well 1s, really the\nkind of life that I wanted to pursue.",
        "A: Exactly. I took classes at the Art Student\u2019s League immediately and then I stayed\nat the art school, art student\u2019s league as full time as monitor and after, after I had\nmore time. I, I, I changed from Hunter College day to Hunter College evening and\nwent to art school during the day.",
        "A: Painting. And drawing, from the model.",
        "A: People.",
        "A: No. The, I, I did not take art as a means of translating realism. To me, art was the,\ngave the contact of the soul and maybe replaced what other people taken their\nreligion, religious experiences.",
        "A: Oh, I, I came to England officially to visit my grandmother who lived there. And\nmy father came with me. It was not officially to visit Earnest but of course\neverybody knew I was going to visit Earnest. So the first thing I did was to fix a\nmeeting place and we met at a subway station, underground. And we threw into each\nother\u2019s arms. That\u2019s it.",
        "A: I saw him the last time in 1940, 1940 and this was 1947.",

        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know. No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Oh yes. Oh yes. And as I said before, I mean, it, it left me great guilt feelings that\nI, I wasn\u2019t able to help him. We did send the packages soon as we came to Lisbon\nand he got it and then I sent a package from, as soon as I came to New York and\nEarnest says he never got it. And then we couldn\u2019t send anymore anyway.",
        "A: Well, if you call it that. We had no money and so we went to a little room, rented\na little room in, in London. That was our honeymoon, wasn\u2019t very exciting maybe\nfrom the outside but for us, it was most exciting.",
        "A: Not too long because I wanted to claim him, to come to the United States as soon\nas possible. And also, that 1s perhaps, I had just gotten a job in New York at the New\nYork Public Library. And they had given me one week of leave and I had already\nextended it to two weeks. So I had to come back if I wanted to keep my job and it is\nvery important that I kept my job because I wanted to send money to Earnest. So, for\nthese reasons I didn\u2019t stay long at all. I returned to England, to excuse me to the\nUnited States and immediately claimed Earnest but I was still not citizen at the time.\nSo I had to wait \u201ctil I became citizen a few months later until he, he could really come\nas the wife of an American.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Oh no, he couldn\u2019t. He had to wait for the visa. Oh no, he couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: Oh yes, it was, he only came in, in February of the next year.",
        "A: Here?",
        "A: In between it was very hard, very hard but well compared to what went before, it\nwasn\u2019t as painful.",
        "A: As, yes, in the, in the, in, in New York and that became my profession. I had not\ngone to library school before and only went to library school when I arrived in\nWashington at a much later, much later.",
        "A: Oh yes, I loved my career. I loved, I loved being a librarian. When I first worked\nin New York, I worked with the, the American government had sent to various\nlibraries the books that they captured in the various countries and wanted them to\ndeposit in various libraries, of course the first library was the Library of Congress.\nBut the New York Public Library was one of the chief libraries to receive these\nbounties also. So they had received an enormous amount of Nazi literature. And\nthey engaged me actually to sift through all that material and make it available and of\ncourse it was very interesting to me, to, to do that. So my first duty as a library\nassistant that I was, was already within the, the field of World War II literature.",
        "A: It was difficult but it was, it explained a lot to me that had happened. The, it, it, it\nfilled gasps and it, it, I was, I worked together with actually with a lot of other people\nwho had similar backgrounds and we, we were constantly discussing our work. It\nwas a very interesting time.",
        "A: Hitler\u2019s Mien Kampf (ph). It was the first time that I came across it.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t read the entire, didn\u2019t, but enough to, to be impressed.",
        "A: That he was a madman. And it was just not understandable to me, how a civilized\npeople, the, the people that I had known in Germany, would fall for such a madman.\nAnd it, this is really not, this is still not resolved, I think that question. Why people\naccept mad leaders and they still do it today. So, the duty of democracy in my\nopinion is to explain that very clearly.",
        "A: It\u2019s, yeah, not a question, it\u2019s still a challenge.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, like how people can be so evil is my, I cannot understand it and I see it every\nday today. Until very recently, I, I couldn\u2019t accept it. I, I mean I, I was always\nidealistic. I always thought that the good will win. Now I\u2019m not so sure anymore. I,\npeople always sort of laughed at me when I maintained this attitude that, they called\nme naive and, and unrealistic and, and, I guess because I had experienced so many\ngood incidents that I firmly believed that the good will win out. I\u2019m afraid to say that\nI, I have to, I have my doubts today.",

        "A: No I didn\u2019t take it so personal. I thought that there are so many good people to\nmake this possible. I mean, I didn\u2019t talk to you now about Varian Fry (ph) for\ninstance. He was my hero. I don\u2019t know if you know who he is. But Varian Fry\n(ph) was the person who, he, he was assigned by the Emergency Rescue Committee\nto distribute visas in France for the intellectuals and this is how we were saved by\nobtaining one of those out of quota visas. And, but the risks this man took. He was\nin danger every day of his, of his life while he worked tn, in Marseilles and to me, he,\nhe, he did it out of idealism, out of the conviction that he had to save people. And he,\nhe saved as many as he possibly could. And when he came back to the United States,\nthe world had forgotten him. It\u2019s very sad, finally, when we came to the United\nStates, my father wanted to write a biography of, of Varian Fry (ph) but he was not\nallowed to do it. He was told somebody else is writing it which, this biography has\nnever came out, so, it was very sad. It was sad also for my father because he admired\nhim and then finally, the, there was an exhibit about him and the United States\nMemorial Museum made an exhibit about Varian Fry and he\u2019s now being recognized\nand it, he, I think you will hear about him very shortly.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. We, the first thing was for him to, to me, to regain his self-esteem. He\nhadn\u2019t worked, he hadn\u2019t studied for all this time and I was concerned that he, he\nshould be given every opportunity possible so, but we had no money and so the first\nconcern was to, to have enough money to live independently. So he had to find a job\nand he took any old job, whatever it was, he didn\u2019t, a long series of short jobs that he\naccomplished in the first half-year of his stay in America and then we had enough\nmoney to, to rent a little apartment on mid-Manhattan. And actually apartment is a\nbig name for a room and a kitchenette. And then he joined the, I was very concerned\nthat he should go continue his studies and he, he went to the new school and he took\na scholarship and he, he then wrote a thesis and then the thesis was sent to many\ncolleges and universities so he could ask for scholarships. And he did receive a,\nseveral scholarships and he choose to go to Johns Hopkins. And that of course meant\nthat we had to leave New York and that meant that I had to leave my job. I might say\nat this point, this is the story of my life. I had to leave my jobs whenever it just\nstarted to bloom, whenever the first blooms came out, I had to leave because my\nhusband was transferred or for such reasons. And today, I know that many married\ncouples split up because of this situation which doesn\u2019t allow the woman to continue\nher career. And, but at that time, there was no question. And so I went with Earnest\nto Baltimore and I got a job in the Veteran\u2019s Administration Hospital Library. And\nthat made me change to a specialization that I had then for quite awhile, which 1s\nmedical librarianship which is a class, sort of, in itself. We settled in, in Sparrow\u2019s\nPoint, it, it, and Earnest went to Baltimore every day and I went to my hospital\nlibrary. And he started his Ph.D. in economics. He choose economics. And after\nawhile, I said Earnest, we have to start a family. This is, I\u2019m getting impatient about\nthat. And so, he had to look for a job because he, he, he did get the scholarship and\nhe did have a very, very small contribution for his teaching when he did, 1t was sort\nof a teaching scholarship. And he taught a few classes in Johns Hopkins, but was\nnothing one could live on. So he traveled to Washington and he actually got a job in\nWashington and we moved again. And as a matter of fact, I had taken, I had started\nto go to library school that summer in New York. I, I took off for a session of the\nsummer school at Columbia University and took medical librarianship and my\nteacher there came from Washington and was chief of reference in the Armed Forces\nMedical Library which is the predecessor of the National Library of Medicine. And\nso when Earnest found his job in Washington, I went to see her and asked her if she\nwould consider hiring me and as I had had an A in her course, she offered me a\nposition in the reference library of the Armed Forces Medical Library which was\nlocated at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology which is the forerunner of the...",
        "A: No of, in, the, for the army, Walter Reed (ph).",
        "A: Yes and, the, the history of the growth of medical librarianship is very interesting\nand very influential because as you mentioned NIH, I mean NIH would be much less\nof what it is without the National Library of Medicine next door and actually it had\nan, it\u2019s own library which adjoined later.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, actually I was rather unlucky. I had miscarriages. And then I\ndid have a successful pregnancy and had a girl. I named her Nicole, Nicole Andrea\nand she was born in \u201953.",
        "A: Very much so.\nWhere does she live?",
        "A: She is a teacher of biology. She studied biology and she fell in love with a, a\nBritish citizen and married him and he, he was not treating her right. He was beating\nher and she had to leave him. And so she had a very unhappy time. She passed away\nunhappy time. She had a baby at that time and my granddaughter and she, but she\nstayed in England. And so today she is in England. She had remarried and is\ndivorced and now she\u2019s teaching biology in, in excellent school in\nBrighton.",
        "A: a good question because she grew up after she, after she was four\nyears old, a little bit like, I just remember I was four years old first time I, she, my\nhusband is assigned his first foreign service appointment. My husband\u2019s position\nwas in the Department of Agriculture when he came and the, he, he will tell you\nabout his position so I won\u2019t go into this. That, he became then attached to the\nForeign Agricultural Service and he was sent overseas as assistant attach\u00e9 and his\nfirst assignment was in Germany. So that was not easy. In, to answer your question,\nwhat do you tell your little girl about the country she\u2019s just about to go to school in?\nAnd that was very difficult. We lived, when we came to Germany, this, the, there\nwas a whole compound in Bonn. We were attached to the embassy, right? And there\nwas a whole compound in, in Bonn called , It was called the golden\nghetto by the local population because it, the American embassy had beautiful\ngrounds and a lovely school and a wonderful restaurants and...",
        "A:",
        "A: Yeah, finish it up and ,\nEnd of tape 1.\nTape 2",
        "A: Yes, , yes. She, she was going to the American school in\nPittusdorf (ph), and at the same time, we wanted her, in this, we wanted her to learn\nGerman. Because we felt that she should not feel that she\u2019s living in a sort of\nseparate ghetto. And the school itself did not teach German very intensively. All the\nsubjects were in English and they had a little German but it wasn\u2019t very much. So we\nhad somebody come over to teach her German, to prepare her for it, normal transition\nif she, she wanted to, to go out of this golden ghetto. And we did not at this time, tell\nher about our previous experience in Germany but it was very difficult to keep quiet\nabout it.",
        "A: Well, to come back what I had said, I felt that as a such a young child, she could\nnot deal with this information, she would hate the country she is in, she would hate\nevery individual for doing what they did to their parents, that\u2019s the way I imagined\nshe would react because that\u2019s certainly the way I would react if I had heard this from\nmy parents. And it would not be a happy life for her to have to deal with this\nproblem, with this psychological problem so we postponed to tell her when she was\nold enough to deal with it and we told her and it was a great shock to her. And, but\nshe, she was very loyal and she, she felt very much with us and she, that\u2019s the way it\nis today.",
        "A: When we told her? About, I\u2019d say, ten, eleven.",
        "A: Yes. I, I don\u2019t know if you can ever understand so.",
        "A: Very difficult. Very different, that\u2019s why we came to this conclusion. It was very\ndifficult, I, but we made some very good friends that are, are Germans and we still\nknow them and it, 1t made me realize that you should not generalize, that as a matter\nof fact, we met a lot of people who were in the Resistance. We, we met a group of\nthe, from the, Shtowfumbergs (ph) that had tried to kill Hitler. We met other\nResistance fighters. There was as a matter of fact, a whole group of them in\nGermany. And it was very impressive to talk to them.",
        "A: We were twice as a matter of fact. We were first for, \u2019'd say, three years, a little\nmore, maybe. Then we were called back for a year and then we were assigned again\nfor two years.",
        "A: That was, so long ago, sixty...",
        "A: In the sixties, yes. In the late fifties and early sixties.",
        "A: In Germany? Yes. Not personally but we did hear anti-Semitic remarks. Not\naddressed to us at all but when you were in a restaurant, you overheard conversations\nbetween two ex-Nazis, obviously SS people, and you understood what they were\nsaying sometimes. It was very hard not to react.",
        "A: Oh yes, recently. We wanted to show this neighborhood to my daughter and we\nintend to show it to my grandchild.",
        "A: Like coming to a foreign country, actually. Not countries, nothing, the, the streets\nhad changed and the environment had changed, that\u2019s what I mean by that.",
        "A: The, the emotions that any injustice that you had to live through would bring up. I\nfelt I had been unjustly, I felt is not the word, I had been unjustly treated and so did\nmy entire family and this is how you react to that. Today I think of the black people\nin America and I can understand their anger, perhaps better than other people can.\nEven though their anger is not constructive at this point. You don\u2019t choose not to be\nangry when you are.",
        "A: It\u2019s not an anger at people, it\u2019s the anger of the in, injustice.",
        "A: The anger is directed against the injustice of, of, of life, of the situation one has to\nface.",
        "A: It\u2019s not a matter of feeling, it\u2019s the truth. It certainly is true. But because it was\nalso partly because of the war, I recognize that other people were also deprived who\nwere not in the same situation such as the American soldier, so, it\u2019s not a unique\nsituation.",
        "A: It entirely shaped who I am. I, I\u2019m not a psychiatrist but isn\u2019t any experience\nshaping the person entirely, and even the unconscious? So, I mean that is always\nwhat defines you?\nchoice of your career? How much of those things were influenced by the war\nexperience?",
        "A: Well my, the, the greatest influence of my war experience certainly is to apply for\nthe job at the Holocaust Memorial Museum. I, I had up till then worked to, with the\nmedical library field. My last job was in Geneva, in Switzerland where I built up the\nmedical library of the university there and a colleague of mine drew my attention to\nthe advertisement in, in one of the Washington papers for that, they advertised for the\njob of the librarian of the Holocaust Memorial Museum. And I thought I was well\nqualified for what they asked and I applied and obviously they agreed with my desire\nto work there. And the experience I had gathered contributed of course immensely to\nthis job.",
        "A: I got the position in \u201989. And I resigned in \u201995.",
        "A: In what way did?",
        "A: Working there contribute \u2014 every day. Every minute of my work I learned\nsomething new and it was fascinating for me to work with the material I worked\nwith. And to build this library, I, I, when I came we had just a few hundred books on,\non a few shelves and, and some office on \u201cL\u201d Street and when I left, we had a full-\nfledged library which was my joy to build up. Also from an architectural point of\nview since I had had that experience in Geneva, working directly with the architects,\nI, I had also this opportunity here and I worked very closely with Freat (ph) who is\nthe architect of the museum and who is also a refugee child. And so we had a lot in,\nin common and it was a great experience. We could, to build up this library from\nscratch.",
        "A: Because of my past experience. You asked were there anything in my decision, in\nmy career decisions was related to my past experience and that is the reason I applied.\nI felt now finally I can do something to, to bring this part of my life out.",
        "A: Well, yes. There is a book published by Klassfelds (ph) which describes the\ntransport to Auschwitz and is very comprehensive and one day we, when it came out,\nof course we acquired it as soon as possible and as, when it arrived, I opened it to the\nname Earnest Koenig and here described when and under what circumstances\nEarnest was brought to Drancy and from Drancy to, I mean it didn\u2019t, not Washington,\nDrancy to Auschwitz and it didn\u2019t describe him. It only mentioned his name but it\ndescribed the transport.",
        "A: [had never seen it before.",
        "A: It, it\u2019s a shaking up experience. I, I, now in the library, the majority of questions\nof people who come in now are trying to trace what happened to their ancestors and I\nwas obliged to show them and have them, have the same experience that I had and it\nwas very difficult for me to do that but I had to. I , working when you\nwork with people in the reference and I knew exactly how they would feel when they\nsaw the names of their loved ones.",
        "A: No, he and I, and, and perhaps that was a mistake. I took that for his not wanting\nto talk about it and I do not know whether I was correct in this assumption. I, I just\nassumed that if he wished to talk it, he would start the conversation on, on the subject\nand I was not going to initiate or push or, I was always there to listen if he wished to\nopen up. And it was very slow in coming.",
        "A: Yes. Oh yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, but, but not early on.",
        "A: Yes of course, certainly, one does have such a unique bond.",
        "A: Iam a survivor. But so are other people. I mean if you are, if you survive a fire,\nyou\u2019re a survivor. So, I mean this, the, the, the term survivor today has broadened\nenormously. And on the one hand, on the other hand, it sort of particularized by a\ncertain group. So I, it\u2019s hard to answer, do you, I think I know what you mean?",
        "A: Oh, you, I tell you something. I have found out that the people who come from\nAuschwitz think that that term is sort of reserved for Auschwitz survivors. I\u2019ve met a\nlot since then and they do not consider me a survivor. So on people or maybe also in\nperhaps other of the death camps, think the same way. When I say Auschwitz it\nmight include the other four, five death, extermination, I mean extermination camps.",
        "A: No, I, I, I think his experience was vastly more wrenching than mine. I, I mean I\ndidn\u2019t have to watch people hang at 12 o\u2019clock in the morning and stay there and\nthen maybe be called as to be shot.",
        "A: Actually, no.",
        "A: Do, do most people that you speak, I have never asked this question, or have been\nasked this question so I don\u2019t know what other people answer.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I think we talked about it inasmuch as my experience showed me the goodness of\npeople and that has, had a lasting influence.",
        "A: No. I mean the people that I left today are mostly have their own careers and 1s\nonly one of the ones that I had left behind died. He joined the Resistance and got\nshot. All the others survived. Almost, I might add, strangely enough since it was\nvery, they had very different experiences after I left. Very different, some went\nillegally to Switzerland, some went to the Resistance, some went, came illegally to\nParis, went back to Paris and hid there. It is, it\u2019s almost unbelievable that none of\nthem got hurt.",
        "A: I see them so frequently that we call, I call the, the Mafia. We, we, we stick\ntogether like glue.",
        "A: There\u2019s, as a matter of fact, some not in Virginia but in Maryland and some in\nNew York and, but we get together and we talk on the telephone all the time and we\nknow of each other and we support each other and when, and there were reunions.\nWe went to a reunion, I think it was \u00b088, I\u2019m not mistaken, in\nLeshombon (ph) and there\u2019s going to be one this year in Leshombon (ph) for the sad\nreason to bury Maktotottmay (ph) and so we see each other very frequently.",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: Because it\u2019s, it\u2019s a most unusual story. The, that a whole village, in fact I think it\u2019s\nthe only time an entire region, an entire region decided not to cooperate with the\npower in, of the government, to oppose the government in, in such a threatening\nsituation to them, their own lives.",
        "A: Not such a single person. That happened very often. Not just a single family or\ntwo or three devoted citizens but an entire village and their neighbors.",
        "A: It, it must be a combination but I just hate to see people be committed to a\nsituation which they cannot control, it\u2019s beyond their control. And in war, you give\nup the control of your destiny.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m, I have learned that I have to admit that there are times when you have to\ngive up your individual freedom for the, for the good of a principle which is the\nfreedom of somebody else.",
        "A: Could you be more precise?",
        "A: No I would related it to the past experience if we, like all people who live together\nfor 50 years have differences of opinion, then it is more due to the change of the\nculture in which you live in that has occurred over those 50 years and I\u2019m particularly\nreferring to the change of women\u2019s rights for instance. And I am for complete\nlegality, always was, even before it was fashionable.",
        "A:",
        "A: The legality of women and men, meant something to me ever since I can\nremember but at that time, it was sort of unusual and, and it wasn\u2019t an issue in, 1n our\nrelationship. However, I, now that women not only demand equal treatment but also\ndemand, not only equal treatment before the law, but ask for equal treatment in any\nsituation, this might constitute sometimes a point of difference.",
        "A: What kind of, are you thinking of something in particular?",
        "A: Yes, I mentioned it before, that he was reluctant to talk about it. And I was\nreluctant to ask and I never knew whether he wanted me to ask first. And that was\nthe difficulty, we, we really didn\u2019t talk about that until he, he, he seemed to become a\nlittle more comfortable with the situation.",
        "A: I think time, time, probably. And then his wish to talk about it became stronger\nand then my, also my family encouraged him to talk about it when we visited them.\n[end of side one, tape 2]",
        "A: We were very close to begin with so I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think you, you could\nsay that because we were very close at the start.",
        "A: Oh yes, I was very glad that he did. Very glad. Yes, it gave me a great deal of\ninsight and well like, you might find out, you might find that asking people the things\nthat you ask gives you an insight that you didn\u2019t have before and adds to your\nknowledge of this world. It surely does.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t, no, I think now he did.",
        "A: I would have to think about it.",
        "A: If not, that\u2019s okay. Well, we were talking about, that you talk, you speak about the\nHolocaust a lot these days. Can you, can you tell me what, what it is that you do\nand, and how often you, you talk about your experiences? And you, we, we talked\nabout before we started recording that, for a long time you didn\u2019t talk, you didn\u2019t\ndiscuss it much, you didn\u2019t talk to other people and talk publicly and now, and now\nyou do. Why, why is there that change? Why 1s that change?",
        "A: Well we have, ever since I\u2019m working at the museum, I bring home a lot of\nmaterial and also my husband has started to write his memoirs and that 1s probably\nthe, the main reason, because after writing his memoirs he asks me to read them and\nto give my opinion and that\u2019s how we start about. His memoirs by the way, are not\njust on the Holocaust at all, his memoirs are about his entire life which includes his\nvery happy childhood and after the war, his experience in foreign service. But of\ncourse, in the middle of these happy stories, is his experience of Auschwitz and he is\nextremely interested anything that relates to the Holocaust and its origin. And so we,\nwe come very interested in the entire question of why the question of anti-Semitism\nand the history of anti-Semitism and in particularly the history of anti-Semitism in\nGermany and Austria and in France. And that\u2019s a very vast subject if you really want\nto get knowledgeable about it. The, it also refers you to things that have not\ndisappeared and are, are, are reappearing in our days now. We have a very strong\nnationalistic party in every one of these countries, especially in France and in Austria,\nwhich is frightening.",
        "A: Yes, because we are dying out. The people who can testify. There are very few\nleft and each time you talk about a subject, one or more details come up that have not\ncome up before, which might be helpful in writing this history. As an example, I just\nlearned two days ago about a happening that might be interesting to mention in this\nconnection. In, there was the, the big question in France was why the was the village\nof Leshombon (ph) spared and we never had really an answer and I don\u2019t think that\nthere is an answer right now either that is hundred percent. But one of our colleagues\nwas caught by the French police and put into a bus in order that he be transported into\na camp or we didn\u2019t know where of course. And he was all of a sudden released.\nAnd of course he jumped from the bus and disappeared but the, we all had theories\non why this had happened and his theory was is because he was so young, he was 12\nyears at the time. And the answer appeared two days ago, it wasn\u2019t at all because he\nwas too young, because as we know now, very young children were brought into\nconcentration camps. It was because the mayor of the city had written to Pitton (ph)\nsaying that the children, the Jewish children of Leshombon (ph) have, are under the\nprotection of the Swiss. Sicroa (ph) Swiss. And therefore cannot be touched. He\nhad never received an answer but apparently this was noted by the authorities. They\nmust have just of notified the police there and the little boy was left. This note, this\nletter by the mayor became known only very recently when the archives of the Red\nCross, Swiss Red Cross was finally made available which was very recently. And I\nexpect that such incidences will come up daily now that the archives of, of the former\nSoviet Union, the archives from all over the occupied countries where the German\nGestapo was the government, are coming up now. And they had been hidden before.",
