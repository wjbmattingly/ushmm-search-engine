        "Q: Okay, so this is basically starting with liberation, but why don't we go back a little\nbit before you were liberated and talk about how old you were, where you were living,\nthat type of thing.",
        "A: At liberation we were still living with Father Longiree(ph) and we were free to leave\nat that point, but he had gotten attached to us and wouldn't let us go and he also\nrealized that we didn't really have a place to go back to, so we wound up staying with\nhim for another year until 1945. | was 14 at the time and eventually my father went\nback to Paris by himself and found us a place to live and it was actually very same\nfurnished room that we had occupied at the outset of World War 2.",
        "Q: When you were still with the priest, tell me where that was?",
        "A: That was in Saint Marten(ph) in French Alps.",
        "Q: So when you found out that it was liberation, do you remember the day that you\nfound out or what, what activities were starting right before that.",
        "A: Well the liberation, the Normandy landing was of course June 6, 1944, but where\nwe were, in southeastern France, we were not liberated until the middle, August 15th,\nbecause we were liberated by Navy coming in from the Mediterranean. And that\nperiod between Normandy landing and that time that we were actually liberated was\na very difficult one because the German troops were being pushed back by the troops\nin Normandy and they went on a rampage and burning towns and taking hostages,\nso actually, that period, that interim period between the two liberations, exact, almost\nthe most dangerous one for us. We had originally found out about the Normandy\nlanding on the BBC, but then the, when we actually liberated, in August, we just found\nEva Edmands 2\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 2\nout somehow, | don't really exactly know how we found out, but we, the troops came,\nthe French troops and told us that we were free.",
        "Q: Free. . How did you feel then?",
        "A: Oh, | was elated and at that point, you know, we were free to move, we were no\nlonger confined to a little boiler room where we had been hidden for three years,\nduring that worst period of the war. But then at this point, | need, we needed help.\n| did not have any clothes, all the clothes that | had, | had outgrown. And somehow,\na social worker from the organization called OZSOE, which in French is called\nOrganization enfant and it's a Jewish agency to help children and\nthey got some clothes to me and they also arranged for me to attend a high school\nin a nearby town of Antsee(ph) and since it was too far for me to commute, they\narranged to board me with a Jewish family in town, so | stayed with the family and\nwent to the College Technique and Moderne and it would have\nbeen about sixth grade. Sixth grade? No, ninth grade, I'm sorry, ninth grade.",
        "Q: How many years of school had you missed?",
        "A: Oh, the only formal schooling I've had was maybe two, two years of elementary in\nParis and maybe what would correspond to junior high, one year in southern France\nand then this would have been ninth grade and that was it and | didn't even finish,\nfinish that because then we had to go back to, to Paris, so really my education\nstopped, my formal education stopped at the ninth grade level.",
        "Q: So when you went back to Paris, did you go into school?",
        "A: No, no.\nEva Edmands 3\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 3",
        "Q: All right, talk about that.",
        "A: Okay, so we went...",
        "Q: Your, now when you were boarding somewhere, your parents weren't with you?",
        "A: No, no, they remained up on the mountaintop and | was all by myself and then\nsometimes I'd come home on the weekend. But! was very unhappy in school and\nin boarding with strangers because | had actually never been separated from my\nparents. And! was homesick and | was crying all the time and it just wasn't working\nout. So we finally, my father had gone ahead and finally found us one room, just\nvery, very primitive and we went back to Paris and when we left the priest, though, |\nhad kind of made a vow to myself that someday | wanted the world to know what he\nhad done forus. And that wish didn't get fulfilled until 1987, when I, | found out about\nthe and recommended him and finally got the designation of the\nthe nations and a medal which was posthumously awarded,\nbecause he died in 1959, but in that way | felt that he had gotten the recognition that\nhe deserved, but at the point, you know, in 1945, | didn't know, | just knew that |\nwanted people to know, but | didn't know anything about, didn't\nexist then. So we went back to Paris and we found that circumstances were really\nvery bad because even though the war was over, everything was devastated, there\nwas no coal to heat apartments with. There was very little food and so our\ncircumstances didn't appreciably improve when we went back to Paris. We were\nnot sure what to do at this point, but my parents gave me a choice, because they felt\nthat | was still so young, just barely 14 and 15 and | had my whole life in front of me\nEva Edmands 4\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 4\nand | should decide whether we should remain in France or whether we should go to\nthe United States. And | had this very romantic idea, the United States, by that time\n| had seen a couple of war movies and | just, you know, | had thought everything\nAmerican was just wonderful so | said, \"| want to go the United States.\" And so we\nhad to put our name on a list and they had a quota and we had to wait until our name\nreached the top the list and that took two years. So we actually didn't get to leave\nuntil 1948. In the meantime we were in Paris and | became ill because you know,\nlack of nourishment and you know, being run down from the war and | contracted\npleurisy and | was very ill for three months. There were no, of course no antibiotics\nin those days and | was, there was not much help available and\nit just took me forever to recover from that illness and | had to stay in bed for three\nmonths and then when it was over | found out | had lost the ability to walk, | was so\nweak my legs just wouldn't, wouldn't cooperate and my parents had to support me\nand | had to learn to walk all over again.",
        "Q: How about your parents, what was their health like?",
        "A: Not great, | mean my mother had always been in poor health and my father had a\nheart condition, but they kind of managed, but | was the one who, you know, who\ncame down with this thing.",
        "Q: How old, what were their ages?",
        "A: Well they would have been in their early 50's at the time. And so, by some\nmiracle, | got over this very dangerous illness and then my father had found a job\nworking for some movie company because before the war he worked for MGM and\nEva Edmands 9)\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 5\nhe was writing subtitles, German subtitles for American movies. And somehow, |\ndon't know exactly who was involved, but he had gotten a contract for one year and\nwe were actually able to go to the French Riviera and live there for a year in a\nvilla. And well he did whatever it was that he was supposed to\ndo and that probably was one of the happiest years of my life, because we were living\nin a gorgeous place and my health improved and that was a very good time for me.\nAnd we had met another couple who had been in Auschwitz and they still had the\nnumbers tattoo and they had met there and they were just a few years older, so they\nwere friends that remained when we came to New York. And then after a year we\nwent back to Paris and went through another year there and | didn't do much of\nanything cause couldn't figure out quite, you Know, we were going to leave anyway,\nthere was no point in my doing anything else.",
        "Q: How old were you at this time?",
        "A: Well, then | was 17, just a little over 17. And then finally we got word the word\nthat our name had reached the top of the list, the quota and we could go the United\nStates.",
        "Q: Before you talk about that, talk a little bit about how aware you were of the world\nat that time, | mean were you, the whole time you were in hiding, did you know that,\nwhat was going on?",
        "A: Not much. We had very little news from the outside world because we were just\ndependent on the clandestine BBC news and we really didn't know very much, but\nyou know, we did find out after, afterward, | mean we had all newspapers and...\nEva Edmands 6\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 6",
        "Q: Do you remember how, how you felt when you found out what had been going on\nduring the war?",
        "A: No, | just, you know there are, there're gaps in my memory, you know, certain\nthings that | remember vividly and others | don't. So | don't know really, what |\nthought. | guess, you know we're all so wrapped up in our personal problems and\nbeing ill, any kind of, you know, major things are less important probably, that they\nshould have been.",
        "Q: What about religion, you said your family was agnostic.",
        "A: That's right, never was given any religious training and this is something that | very\nmuch regretted later on because | felt that if they had given me some type of religious\ntraining, whatever, it, it would have reinforced a sense of identity which is something\nthat | lacked, | really didn't know who | was. But as young as | was, all these years\nyou know and even in Vienna was a very little girl, | had an awareness of the\nexistence of God and | don't know how because nobody told me because my parents\nhad a tendency to kind of downplay it and say oh well, you know, it's all myth. And\n| knew there was a God and | kept searching for God, and...",
        "Q: So at this time, when you were still in France, you still didn't have any real religion?",
        "A: No, nothing, | didn't, you know, | mean here we were supposedly Jewish but my\nparents had been so assimilated into the dominant culture in Austria that they\nconsidered themselves Austrian and not really Jewish at all. Asa matter of fact they\nwere almost anti-Jewish because they had formally left the Jewish religion, you know,\nyou can do that and it was just because they were, you know, my father considered\nEva Edmands 7\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 7\nhimself to be an intellectual and they just did not believe in anything. And so | didn't\nknow anything about the religion of my ancestors. My grandparents weren't that\nobservant, although probably more than my parents were, but each generation was\nmore observant and that was the irony, that we were persecuted for a faith that we\nreally didn't believe in. But the Nazis didn't make such distinctions. | didn't know\nanything about Judaism, | didn't know anything about Christianity, | didn't know\nanything about anything. So, you know, we were told that our name had reached\nthe top of the quota and we had, we have to have a sponsor on this country.\nSomebody who, in America, somebody who would make sure that you didn't go on\nwelfare when you came here and so. And my uncle and aunt on, my mother's\nbrother and his wife had managed to escape the war and go to America and my uncle\nwas a doctor and he was doing quite well, they were settled and so they said they\nwould sponsor us and so we were able to leave and we had to go by boat and it took\nnine days to get over there and | remember that we were all deathly ill, | didn't eat\nanything for nine days, | was terribly seasick and we finally, finally landed in New\nYork on my, in 1948, May, 1948, | was just about 17 and a half at the time and my\nuncle and aunt were there at the port to meet us and my aunt's first words to us were,\n\"| didn't really want you to come.\" Because she was that kind of person, she very\nmuch, you know her, she did because her husband said, \"Well this my sister and her\nfamily, we have to.\" But we were always, as far as they were concerned, the poor\nrelations and she didn't have much respect for us and she didn't want us to come.\nSo this is how we were greeted after Holocaust and all we went through and not only\nEva Edmands 8\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 8\nthat but they had a lovely home in Queens, New York, but they didn't put us, they\ndidn't take us there, they took us to a shelter run by the Hius(ph), which was the\nHebrew Immigrant Society, downtown New York and so we spent our first night in\nthe new country in a shelter with hundreds of other people on cots. It was not a very\ngood first impression. And then, somehow, my father found us a place to live, just\na, you know, a room somewhere and that's how we started. But my aunt was so\nafraid that, you know, we'd wind up costing her money that she got my mother and\nme a job in a factory and it was a real sweatshop downtown. It was some friend of\nhers was owning a factory and, it was a bead factory and we were made to string\nbeads all day long, you know, that kind of thing. It was just horrible and it was very\nhot. It was May and it was very hot. So this, we were just kind of, is this America?\nWe had this glorified picture and it just didn't turn out at all the way we thought it\nwould be. And my mother and | didn't last very long in the factory. We were fired\nbecause we didn't work fast enough. And so we lasted only about two, three days\nand that was the end of that and then we found a place to live, it was, what in those\ndays they call a railroad apartment, on the very edge of Spanish Harlem, on 98th,\nEast 98th Street. And they were just, you know, one room going to another and it\nwas very primitive, we didn't have any furniture and we went, remember we went to\nGoodwill Industries and got, just a few pieced of furniture and my father had a really\nhard time getting work. You know, he was in his 50's and he spoke English\nsomewhat but you know, when you first come here and you're immigrant, nobody's\ngoing to hire you and he had to, for a first, | don't know how long, but he, he washed\nEva Edmands 9\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 9\ndishes, he did all those things, you know, just to get some money so we could survive.\nAnd the other thing was, you know, as far as | was concerned, | did not speak English.\nAnd English is now my third language because | had to learn French first, when we\ncame to France. And so | didn't speak a word of English and yet | knew that it was\nvery important for me to learn if | was ever going to get some work. And! wound up\nreally supporting the family, but | guess | have a, you know, it's easy for me to learn\nlanguages and | did learn pretty quickly. So it wasn't that big a problem for me to, to\nlearn a language. And then things got kind of bad because my mother became very\nill. She was only in her 50's and she had a stroke, which left her permanently\ndisabled. She had contracted TB during World War 1. And then from that she got\na rheumatic heart, so her heart was not very good and she was just a tiny little\nwoman, she was five feet and the most she ever weighed in her life was 90 pounds.\nAnd she had the stroke and so she was almost unable to, one side was paralyzed\nand she had trouble walking, so she was more or less homebound after that.",
        "Q: What about medical care?",
        "A: Well she had a, we went to a doctor that we had known in Vienna, but they didn't\nhave things for people like, you know, as they do now . You\nknow, there was no talk of physical rehabilitation, any of those things, we didn't have\nthe money. | mean we would just, basically people. We never\ndid go on welfare but we had no money, we couldn't afford any of those things.",
        "Q: Was she hospitalized?\nEva Edmands 10\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 10",
        "A: Briefly and then she was just sent home and she managed as well as she could\nathome. And of course you know we had to, couldn't leave her, we had to take care\nof her, take turns. So that was, that was kind of really unfortunate. She was really\nyoung and she, she really never had a life after that.",
        "Q: Was she aware of what was going on around her?",
        "A: Oh yeah, | mean her mind was never affected, her speech was not affected, her\nmind, she died at 83 and her mind was clear as a bell, right to the end. And she was\nnever one to feel sorry for herself, she always, you know, managed to ___ herself\nand you know, keep herself neat. And she had interests, she read, she listened to\nthe radio and she had a lot of friends, so she was very remarkable that way. But her\nlife was just taken away from her basically, at that point. So really my father was still\nhaving a lot of problems getting work and it was up to me to support the family. And\nsoon as | learned English, then | started, you know, getting, looking at the classifieds\nin the paper and | don't know why, to this day | don't know why, but | answered an ad\nfor somebody who wanted a bookkeeper and I'd never done any bookkeeping and\nmath was my worst subject. But | went and it was a company called Home\nCraftsman in downtown New York. It was a magazine for hobbyists, people who\nlike to putter around, do jigsaws at home and do all those things. And for some\ninexplicable reason | was hired, but after a few days they realized that | was not a\nbookkeeper. And the boss said to me, | don't know what you did, you know, in your\nand of course | had fudged, it was a matter of survival. | didn't like having to do that\nbut it was a matter of survival. | had to pretend that | had experience because | had\nEva Edmands 11\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 11\nto start somewhere. And somehow, | don't know if he felt sorry for me or what but\nthey realized that, you know, | had not quite told the truth, but they kept me and they\nmade me into a mail clerk and so for five years | opened mail, because they had a\nmail order business and I, and | just separated the orders in neat piles and count the\nmoney and the checks at the end of the day. And so |! wound up staying with that\ncompany for, for five years.",
        "Q: And where were you living?",
        "A: We were still living in, really a tenement on East 98th Street, we still.",
        "Q: And so how would you commute?",
        "A: Subway, take the subway?",
        "Q: Were you making friends at this time?",
        "A: Well, slowly, you know, very slowly. But here, one thing is that we had, we\nthought that we had left anti-Semitism in the old country and when we came to New\nYork, the first thing that there was some friends that had come, you know, my father's\nfriend and the first thing they told us was to me, you know | was looking for work,\ndon't bother applying to any banks or any insurance companies or IBM because they\ndon't hire Jews. And there were certain places in New York where you couldn't live,\nbecause they didn't rent to Jews. And certain resorts where you couldn't go, that\nwere not, that were, so | thought, \"Oh, you know, here | thought we left all this behind\"\nand a, so a strange thing happened at this point, | was really almost ashamed of\nhaving a Jewish background and so | didn't tell anybody. | told them | was French\nbut | didn't tell them about my background of being a survivor or anything like that\nEva Edmands 12\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 12\nbecause the Germans had done such a good job of propagandizing and making you\nfeel like you were the scum of that earth, that so, it is so insidious that after a while,\nyou're being told, you know, over these years, you're scum, you're scum, you wind\nup believing. | said, \"Well maybe | am inferior, maybe I'm not good as anybody\nelse.\" And so | just determined | wasn't going to tell people and you know. And at\nwork nobody knew. The friends, | deliberately went to the YWCA and made friends\nthere, Protestants, Catholics and nobody knew. And | kept this up for a very long, |\nburied, | buried the past and just forced myself not to think about it and thinking that\nthis would be okay. Of course it didn't work that way, but...",
        "Q: What about your father, did he do the same thing?",
        "A: No, | don't, | don't think, well, cause he never considered himself Jewish. You\nknow, he had friends who knew but | don't think he made a big deal about it, you\nknow, | don't think he went out telling people, you know I'm, no, no, he, he, he was\nthe same way, he kind of downplayed it. And that's, you know, that's what you had\nto do to be accepted. | didn't really know any Jewish young people my age, all the\npeople | knew, knew Jewish were more or less my father's age, you know, so | didn't\nhave anybody, any connections there. So | worked at this job for five years and then\nwhen | felt confident enough, you know, with the English language and everything, |\ndecided | was going to look for something better and | got a job with Kodak,\ncorporation. | don't exactly remember what it was, but it was a\nstep up in salary. | had started, I'd started at, the Home Craftsman and | remember\nit was 37 dollars a week | was making there. So it was whatever | was getting, it\nEva Edmands 13\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 13\nmust have been 45 dollars, but it was a step up. And then, you know, | was just, |\nstill didn't have any formal education but | went to night school, to business school\nand | learned typing and shorthand and some business English and so that, you\nknow, gave me some type of foundation and then | had some minor jobs but the\nreally, you know, significant job that | eventually had, after a lot of clerical jobs was\nwith the magazine Outdoor Life. And | was doing advertising production there,\nkeeping track of the, the ads that people send and you know the dates that this would\nappear in a... It was an interesting job and | had, you know, friends there and it\nwas a nice, kind of a nice, it was really a step up at that point. My parents then\nmanaged to, my father finally got some work , although it wasn't at all in his line of\nbusiness. He had, was doing some freelance writing articles for foreign magazines\nand writing some, you know, just potboiler novels, just, you know, really to pay the\nrent, they were not at all what he was used to doing. But, you know, we were\nsurviving. Not, not very well, but we were surviving and he managed to upgrade our\nliving quarters. We finally moved to a place on, still on the East Side, on 89th Street.\nIt was another railroad flat and of course in those days you didn't have air conditioning\nor, you just had plumbing, but that's about it. And heat.",
        "Q: 89th and where?",
        "A: 89th...",
        "Q: Do you remember the address?",
        "A: 418 East 89th Street?",
        "Q: So that's in the German, that's the German neighborhood.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nEva Edmands 14\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 14",
        "A: Yeah, it was in the, it was called Yorkville, right. And so we lived there for quite,\nquite a long time. And | was still going to the, to the Y and | made friends there,\nfriends that | have to this day and...",
        "Q: And none of them knew about your hiding during the war?",
        "A: No, no, none of them knew.",
        "Q: Did anybody ask, since they knew you were French, or you told them you were\nFrench, what you had done during the war, were they curious or was it just not talked\nabout?",
        "A: No, | just said | was a refugee, you know. And then when | made the kind of\nfriends that | felt | could trust, you know, after I've known them for a long time, then |\nwould tell them and the curious thing is one, one friend was actually German. But\nhe was not, you know, prejudiced or anything. She was a little worried about telling\nher mother that she had made a Jewish friend and her mother said, \"So what?\" you\nknow, so that was good. So little by little, you know, it's like | came out. But! was\nvery cautious who | told, you know and | was, | had to be absolutely sure that those\npeople weren't going to turn around, because | had this bad experience, | was\ntraumatized in Vienna, when the Nazis passed, when the Nazis took over Austria,\n1938 and passed the racial laws and | was in public school at the time and | saw how\nthese kids, just from one day to the next, turn against me. People who had been my\nfriends, my classmates outside of school and then suddenly they started calling me\nnames, dirty Jew and they'd spit when | walked by and you know, to me a seven year\nold, was so hard to understand why kids would be that way, from one day to the next.\nEva Edmands 15\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 15\nJust because their parents were Nazi sympathizers and they told them, you know,\nyou don't want to have anything to do with Jews. And as young as | was, | must\nhave realized some, on some level, that prejudice is not something that, you know,\nyou're not born with it, it's something that is acquired, it is learned, it's a learned\nbehavior and it can be unlearned. But | saw stare where\nsuddenly friends turned into enemies, so that's why | think I'm so careful. Cause |\ndidn't want to be rejected again. It was very normal, | was a young girl and | had\ngreat hopes for my future and | wanted to put everything behind me and | wanted to\nbe so desperately...[end of side 1, tape 1]. | was very careful about what, who | told,\nbecause | did not want to face the rejection | had faced as_ achild in Vienna and a,\nbecause at that point | wanted to put the past behind me and | desperately just\nwanted to find some happiness.",
        "Q: Now what about the relatives, did you ever see them again? Your aunt and uncle\nand didn't you also have grandparents?",
        "A: Yes, well, | was going to come to that, you know, where we were still in France\nand it was actually after the liberation, that a gentile friend of ours who had remained\nin Vienna, somehow got word that my father's mother had been deported, that they\nhad the Nazis, the Gestapo had come to our house in Vienna looking for my father\nand when they realized that we had already fled, as a reprisal | suppose, they went\nto his parents house in, on the outskirts of Vienna and took my grandmother away,\nshe was /6 years old and they took her to the camp of Theresienstadt where, we\nwere told, that she had died and when they came, my, my, when they came to take\nEva Edmands 16\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 16\nher, my grandfather, who was about the same age, had a stroke and he eventually\ndied. And | remember that this was a terrible thing for my father, the day we got the\nnews, the letter, he just walked out by himself into the woods and he stayed there for\nmany hours because he felt he had to be alone with his thoughts and it was just, it\nwas just a terrible, terrible experience. And then, you know, in the time that | was in\nNew York and | had managed, you know, to improve my living\nwith the various jobs | have and at one point | was able to go back there to, to Austria.\nAnd my aunt and cousin were still living in Vienna and they had somehow escaped\ndeportation because my aunt had been married, if only very briefly, to a gentile, whom\nshe divorced. But in those days, if you were just half, you know, married to a gentile\nand your child, my cousin, was two years older than I, was half Jewish, that protected\nyou. And they were made to do, you know, forced labor, in Vienna itself, you know,\ncleaning streets, doing that kind of thing, but they were not deported. And so | went,\n| went to see them and then she told me the circumstances of how my grandmother\nwas taken away and how she, she begged the Nazis not to take her because she\nsaid, you know, she had a bad heart and she was /6 years old and said please, she\nbegged and pleaded and of course they didn't pay any attention. And she told me\nhow my grandmother was screaming when they took her away and that was just, to\nme it was just like somebody stabbed me in the heart. And that picture stayed with\nme and so then, when | got back to New York, this was haunting me, | kept thinking\nabout my grandmother screaming and that's all, | was, became an obsession. And\nthen | got the feeling that | wasn't entitled to be happy. And | actually came up with,\nEva Edmands 17\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 17\nyou know what later has been identified by psychologists as survivors guilt. |\nactually felt guilty for having survived when my grandmother didn't. And | thought, |\nhave no right to be happy. And so any time a little bit of happiness came my way, |\nfelt bad about it, | said, \"| don't, | don't have any right to feel that.\" And this took a\nlong time and you know I, | didn't know that this was a psychological problem or this\nwas a syndrome, | mean this is how | felt and it took me years and years to get over\nthat. | finally did and nobody helped me with it, | just finally came to realization that\nit wasn't my fault. But! think that that was the start of it. And you know, it leaves,\nthe whole years leave psychological scars. | had an anxiety syndrome, you know,\nwhen we were already in New York and | would see, you know, policemen in the\nstreet, anything, a uniform, you Know, you get, you startle, you just freeze because\nyou're so used to seeing uniforms as belonging to the SR, the SS, as a menace.\nAnd it's a reaction that you can't help and also if we were at home and somebody\nunexpectedly rang a doorbell or knocked on a door, | would start shaking and my\nheart would pound like crazy, | just froze. Because you know, there's that knock on\nthe door and even though we knew we were now in America and we were safe, you\nretain that and it doesn't leave that quickly.",
        "Q: Did your parents also have the same reaction?",
        "A: Probably but maybe not, because | was lot more impressionable and a lot younger,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Did you verbalize what you were feeling or did you keep it to yourself?\nEva Edmands 18\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 18",
        "A: No, | think | told them, they knew, you know, what was going on. And then,\nunfortunately, some bad things happened when we were still living in our first\ntenement, because of course we didn't have any air conditioning or fans and we had\nto leave the windows open at night in the summertime and one night | was in my, in\nmy bedroom and a man came in and | don't know, he crawled into, to the courtyard\nand | just woke up with a hand around my throat and a hand on my mouth. And |\nmanaged to wrench it free and scream and my parents came running. The man\nfled, but that was just another thing that shook me up, right after, you know, all this\nbusiness, so | steadily, you Know, went downhill after that. Psychologically, | went\nreally, you know, | had these terrible anxiety attacks and | had to force myself to, just\nto function. You know, that took a very long time.",
        "Q: Meanwhile, the people at your office, they didn't, were they aware of what was\nhappening?",
        "A: No, because | did, | was a pretty good actress, you know, | managed to, to keep\nthings and | managed to function and then I'd fall apart, you know. Then, let's see,\nthen | got another, oh yeah, | was working for Outdoor Life, okay and...",
        "Q: Where were those offices, do you remember?",
        "A: It was midtown and | don't exactly know where. It was in the 30's | think, midtown.",
        "Q: During this time, were you taking advantage of the culture in New York? Were\nyour parents, your father was definitely a cultured person.",
        "A: Right, right. Well, you know, as much as | could, you know, | went to movies and,\nbut you know, | still didn't have any money because | wasn't making that much, you\nEva Edmands 19\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 19\nknow, women especially weren't paid very well, office people. And whatever | made,\nwhatever extra, | had to give to my parents, you know, for food and\n. Cause | still was, was living with them so | had very little spare\nmoney and of course there were free concerts sometimes and in those days you\ncould still go out at night and ride the subways, which you can't do now. And |, |\nsuppose, yes, |, but you know, | couldn't go to Broadway or anything like that, it was...",
        "Q: But what about museums?",
        "A: Museums yes, you know, | went to museums and went to some little trips with the\nYWCA, they had a camp in Pauling(ph) and so we went . The\nonly trip that | did take is the one in 1956 where | just saved and saved and saved,\nyou know from, like basically from 1948 til, til | got the money together for the trip and\nthat was the big thing and | wanted to go back but when | did go back to Vienna, |\ndidn't want to see the place where we had lived and | just, you know, visited my\ncousin and | felt really a stranger in Vienna, it was, to me was like a dead city. |\ndidn't feel any emotional connection with it any more.",
        "Q: What about the aunt that lived in Queens, your, did you have anything\nwith them?",
        "A: Well, we had very little contact because they had treated us so badly and they\ndidn't help us in any way, | mean they knew we were hard up and we didn't have any\nfurniture and we didn't have clothes and we didn't have money and they never offered\nto do anything. They felt they did their job, they sponsored us, they got us here and\nthat was the end of it. And then they wind up treating my grandfather the same way.\nEva Edmands 20\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 20\nHe is my mother's father, he had managed to go to London, just at the outset of war\nand then came here and they wound up putting him in a nursing home, in one of the\nworst nursing homes in New York City, so, and he was a person who had done so\nmuch for them. And so they were just bad people, you know and we had very little,\nvery little contact with them. | went, | joined a, I've, you know | went into, | was\nmeeting some people but, you know, | had dates, but there wasn't anything, you\nknow, spectacular. And | wound up going to the Unitarian church, All Souls\nUnitarian Church, New York City. They had a young people's group and | just went\nthere to have a little more intellectual atmosphere and that's where | met my future\nhusband. They had, this was just before Thanksgiving, they had a dance and | met\nhim there. And that was in November of 1958. And his story was just so totally\ndifferent from mine, | mean, we, we had come really, literally from the ends of the\nworld, opposite ends of the world and met. It was very, very strange. He had, his\nname was William. Bill, we called him Bill and he had been raised in the Philippine\nIslands, he was actually born in San Francisco but he was raised in the Philippines\nbecause his father was an officer in the army there. He was a lieutenant colonel in\nthe Philippine Scouts, he was in charge of native troops there in the Philippines, you\nknow and this the time of MacArthur and so on, Eisenhower ;\nAnd so my husband had a sister who was a year older, his mother and father all lived\nin the Philippines and he lived there until Pearl Harbor, he was about 17 at the time.\nAnd then when, at Pearl Harbor the family was evacuated back to the States, mother\nhad a, was originally from Kansas, she was from Wichita and so my husband, my\nEva Edmands 21\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 21\nfuture husband and his sister and mother came back to the United States while his\nfather remained in the Philippines and then later the family got word that he had been\nmade prisoner of war of the Japanese and he wound up dying in Japanese prison of\nwar camp. So my husband had a, you know, traumatic experiences in his life, very,\nvery, at a very young age too. And then when they went back to Wichita he, he\njoined the service, he went in first in the Army Air Corps and then in the Marines, he\nkept enlisting, just so that, you know, he just wanted to do something for his country\nand he wanted to get away from this, you know, memory of this father, you know, he\ndidn't want to deal with it. And then somehow he wound up in, in New York City\nwhere, where we met. But his family were as WASP as you can get. His father\nhad traced an ancestor who had actually come over on the Mayflower. They were,\nyou know, Episcopalian, Republicans and very anti-Semitic, because of one incident\nin the camp, one Jewish officer they'd had some fight with and they decide all Jewish\npeople were bad, so he had come from this environment but then, he inherited some\nmoney from when his mother died in 50's, in Wichita and he was able to travel around\nthe world, literally around the world and he was able to broaden his mind and to meet\nall different cultures and, and then he just shed all those prejudices that he had when\nhe was younger so by the time he met me, you know, he didn't have any prejudice\nand he went to the Unitarian place because he thought, well he was very liberal, by\nthat time he'd become liberal in his politics and soon. This is the place to be. But\nyou know, | was afraid to tell him about my background because here was a man\nthat | really cared about and | was afraid again that if he'd found out | was Jewish he\nEva Edmands 22\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 22\nwould drop me like a hot potato, so | didn't say anything. And it wasn't, so that was\nNovember, we got engaged in May of '59.",
        "Q: You still hadn't told him about yourself?",
        "A: No and we got married on August eighth, in New York, in the Unitarian church and\njust a few people, friends and you know, my mother and father ,\nAnd it wasn't til we were married for several months that | finally told him.",
        "Q: Was this something that was worrying you a lot the whole time?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And | finally told him and he said, and | figured, well now he's married\nme, he can't just divorce me for . And he said, \"I know. I've\nknown all along.\" Because there was one person there, it was a young man my age,\nyou know, we had grown up together in Vienna and he was the only one from the\nother side that | knew. And | had introduced Bill to him and at some point he told Bill\nabout my background. But Bill never said anything to me about it, he figured well\nwhen | was ready, | would say so. So then, when | thought was a big surprise, he\nsaid, \"| know. Tom told me.\"",
        "Q: Now this is someone that he had met at the wedding or even before that?",
        "A: No, even before that. You know, when we were engaged, | introduced him to a\nfew friends that | had. So he wasn't at all surprised and that was the end of it, that\nwas the end of it. And so after that, you know, | started being much more open\nabout it, although his sister, who still lived in, she had moved to Liberal(ph) Kansas\nat that time and she was still not crazy about, you know, he didn't want to, he didn't\nwant to tell his sister he'd married a Jewish girl, and...\nEva Edmands 23\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 23",
        "Q: What, what about his parents or his mom?",
        "A: Well his mom had died before he ever met me, so she was gone, yeah. So we\ngot married in '59 and...",
        "Q: And you were living where? In New York?",
        "A: | was living New York and | was still working for Outdoor Life and he had just, he\nwas out of work at the moment and so supporting the two\n, two of us. And then we finally, he got some work and we finally\nwere able to, | moved into his apartment, he had an apartment in the Bronx, which,\na five floor walk-up which very, you know, very primitive.",
        "Q: Did you have to continue to support your parents?",
        "A: No, at this point, not. They had, my father was making sufficient money at the\ntime. He had gradually worked his way up and to the point where he wound up\ngoing into partnership with some guy and they have little advertising agencies,\nagency and they were doing publicity for movies, something like that. So, by no\nmeans, you know, doing very well, but enough to, to support themselves and so.\nAnd so my husband and | wouldn't, you know, | wouldn't have been able to support\nthem because we had just, we weren't making that much money between us, just\nenough for us to get a little place, so the first place, nicer place we had was again, it\nwas on 88th Street, 88th, well 84th Street, close to the East River in New York City.\nJust a one room apartment, that was it. And this went on for awhile and then we\ngot, restless. We were dissatisfied with our jobs, we felt they were dead end jobs.",
        "Q: This is in 1959?\nEva Edmands 24\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 24",
        "A: Well this would be now going in the 60's already and we just felt, you know, there\nwas no future and we wanted to go somewhere else. We never did like living ina\nbig city and so we thought we would try our luck elsewhere and we sent for different\nfolders and wound up going west and it turned out to be a disaster because there\nwas no work there.",
        "Q: Where?",
        "A: Where we, we, for some reason we decided to go to the state of Washington.\nSpokane and Seattle and there was no work there. So that was sort of a disastrous\nmove because we had given up our apartment in New York. But you know, we were\nstill fairly young. My husband was six years older than | was, so. But we were still\nresilient enough to cope with whatever came our way. We wound up, in this trek, in\nSan Francisco and couldn't find work there because they didn't want to hire\nsomebody just arrived, you know. And so finally, what we wind up doing is my\nhusband had gone to the University of Kansas, in Lawrence and he had, he was only\nshy a few credits to get a BA. and so he decided we'd go back to the University, get,\nto try to get readmitted and if he had his BA., he felt he would improve his chances\nof getting a better job and so that's what we did. That was 1962 and we came to\nLawrence and he enrolled at the University. | worked at the library, Watson Library\nat the University of Kansas and again we lived under very precarious circumstance.\nWe didn't have much money and we were living in a rooming house. Before one\nyear and he got his degree.",
        "Q: When, what year?\nEva Edmands 25\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 25",
        "A: That was in 1962. And then we went back to New York, we figured okay, now he\nhas a BA., maybe we can find something else and by some fluke, he found work in\na private school in New York city, that dealt with emotionally disturbed youngsters.",
        "Q: What school?",
        "A: Searing(ph) School. And he was teaching history and math there. And | was\nworking at the time, I'd gotten another job at Harold Orum(ph) corporation,\nincorporated, it was a public relations firm, but it was just something to tide us over\nbecause | was on the switchboard, you know, nothing really great. And this\nSearing(ph) School had a boarding school in upstate New York, in Westchester\nCounty, for boys. And then one day the principal called him, my husband in and\nsaid, \"Your wife is from, from Europe, isn't she?\" And he said, \"Yes.\" \"Well we\nneed somebody in our boarding school, we need some teachers in our boarding\nschool and in Soamers(ph) New York and we need a Latin teacher and your wife's\nfrom Europe, she knows Latin, doesn't she?\" And he said, \"Oh, sure.\" Never,\nnever learned Latin, nothing, cause with that, that one year that was in Unsee(ph),\nyou know, right after the war, in the ninth grade, | took English, not that it helped any,\nbut | was more interested in Latin, so he said, \"Oh, yeah.\" So he came home and\ntold me this and | said, \"Are you crazy?\" | said, \"| don't know Latin.\" He said, \"Oh,\nwell | brought you some books, you can learn.\" And he brought me some grammar\nbooks and | sat there night after night teaching myself the verbs and the conjugations\nand so. And | taught myself two years of Latin, just be myself. And | was hired, the\nwoman never asked to see any papers. We wound up in the boarding school for\nEva Edmands 26\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 26\nboys and | taught Latin. And then | wound up teaching, because it was more a\ntutorial school, so it was very one on one or at the most, two or three and then here\n| am, an Austrian, you know, English is my third language, but what do | teach?\nEnglish. Because | was good in grammar. Because you know, you have to have\nall these languages, so grammar was a cinch forme. And that's what they needed.\nAnd | had to get kids ready for the SATs and the grammar was an important thing\nand composition, | was good at that, | could always write. So that was fine. So |\ndid quite well and we did, we stayed there for two years.",
        "Q: Now you had no degree?",
        "A: No, nothing.",
        "Q: At all? And you were teaching Latin and then English.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: It's incredible.",
        "A: And really making out, | mean my reputation was made. The kids were passing\nthe tests with flying colors. And these were emotionally disturbed kids who had a\nlearning, they had learning disabilities, they had dyslexia, you name it.",
        "Q: And back in those days, it wasn't even defined yet.",
        "A: No. And yet those kids were doing okay, so.",
        "Q: Did you enjoy this?",
        "A: Oh yeah, very much, | mean this was something that, you know, | didn't know |\nhad it in me to be a teacher, but | identified with the kids because | was pretty messed\nup myself psychologically and you know, it was something | could identify with and |\nEva Edmands 27\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 27\nguess it takes a lot of patience to do this. You know, | mean, if you make very, very\nslow progress. But enjoyed it, yes, it was...",
        "Q: Now you were in your 40's?",
        "A: Yeah, 30's, my...",
        "Q: Had you and your husband decided at that point about children?",
        "A: No, we talked about it and then, you know, | was always very nervous and my\nhusband was nervous and we said, \"No, we too nervous to have kids.\" And you\nknow, | was already 29 when we got married and then of course, finances were so\ntight that we couldn't afford to have it, you Know, would have been a catastrophe.\nAnd then it got to be too late, you know, in your middle 30's it gets a little risky so we\nkind of, you Know, decided that was not, that was not for us.",
        "Q: So was working with children, was that a good feeling for you, to have that\nexperience?",
        "A: Yeah, it was a good feeling, it would, you know, there were, you know, high school\nage, | mean | had some that were a little younger than that but they were basically\nbetween 13 and 18 boys and girls too, later on, so. And we were given our quarters\nin the boarding school, then we were house parents and | enjoyed that, it was good\nexperience. And then, then somehow, you know there are some gaps, but\nsomehow we decided we, after two years, we'd had enough of this, you Know, scene\nand my husband decided to go back to Kansas to get a degree in education, cause\nhe...",
        "Q: And your parents are still living in New York?\nEva Edmands 28\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 28",
        "A: My parents are still living in New York. And so in 1965, we came back to\nLawrence, Kansas. My husband enrolled for his, gets his education degree, | went\nback to work at the library. And that's at the point where, you know, people always\nask me, \"Why did you come to Lawrence?\" You know, and | said, because we had\nties here, we liked Lawrence and | always, you know, I'd lived in a lot of great capitals\nof the world, Paris, Vienna, New York and yet | never was comfortable living in a big\ncity because | think from the days when | lived with, at the priest's house, you know,\nin the mountaintops and | got used to being close to nature and | always felt like a\nfish out of water in the big city and the noise, | became extra, extra sensitive to noise.\nEverything just bothered me, | couldn't sleep at night and | just wanted away, | just\nwanted a quiet life so Lawrence was perfect. Even though we didn't have any\nmoney and we lived in a rooming house, but we could walk everywhere and we read\na lot and you know, it was, it was pretty good. But then unfortunately we got the\nnews from New York that my father was dying of lung cancer, because he had been\na smoker all his life, from the time he was 15 and the only time he couldn't smoke\nwas during the war, but he started right after and he got lung cancer and he was\nhopeless and then we got word he was dying. So we had to go back to New York,\ntemporarily and get my mother, cause my mother was totally helpless by that time\nbecause of a stroke and we had to liquidate the apartment and then bring my mother\nback with us. She didn't have heat, he, he left nothing. He had never, there was\nhardly, a little bit of Social Security but otherwise, he didn't have his savings or\nanything so she was just basically left destitute. And so we took her back on the\nEva Edmands 29\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 29\nplane with us and here we were in two tiny rooms and, and you know, three people\nand a cat, we had to bring the cat, too. So we lived that way for awhile and then my\nhusband got his education degree and he got a job in New Mexico in a place called\nAlimagordo(ph) and teaching history in high school and it was a strange thing\nbecause he had been stationed there when he was in the army air corps, training on\na missile base there. So it was...",
        "Q: not hit the, this part, because ,",
        "A: Yeah. So we, somehow he, he got a job at teaching high school in New Mexico,\nso we went New Mexico and lived there for a year.",
        "Q: With your mother?",
        "A: With my mother.",
        "Q: But then we couldn't stay there because the climate didn't agree with my husband.\nHe was coughing all the time , probably the sand, there was a lot\nof sand, dust storms and he just couldn't take that and also at school it was very, very\nconservative terrain there and he was never one who could keep his thoughts about\nhistory to himself, his liberal thoughts so he got in trouble and actually his life was\nthreatened and you know, and we decided we couldn't stay there. And so again at\nthis point, we didn't know what to do. And! was working at the public library in New\nMexico in Alimagordo(ph).",
        "Q: Were you afraid then, when, when that happened?",
        "A: Yeah, we were afraid, yeah we were afraid.",
        "Q: Do you want to talk about that at all?\nEva Edmands 30\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 30",
        "A: Yeah, we were just scared all the time, they had come and during the night and\nlet the air out of the tires our car and...",
        "Q: Because of his political beliefs?",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: Was, it was a very conservative area?",
        "A: Very John Birch, yeah. And in, you know and they just, there, they were just, their\nminds are closed and we knew that we weren't safe there.",
        "Q: Did they know your background?",
        "A: No. No, because there was, my husband, you know, that's. And so then\nsomehow, when | was working at the library, | found out that...\nEnd of Tape 1.\nEva Edmands 31\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 31\nTape 2",
        "Q: And then you were working in the library?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: While | was working at the public library in Alimagordo(ph), New Mexico, | found\nout that New York City was looking for social workers in the welfare department and\nall that was required was a BA. degree. So | told my husband about it and he\nthought it sounded good, it was certainly worth taking a chance, so we left New\nMexico at the end of the school year and drove back to New York City. My husband\nwent to the Department of Welfare and got hired immediately as a social worker.\nAnd this, this was a very, very good move, because just shortly after that, the city of\nNew York froze all new hiring and he got in just under the wire and he wound up\nworking for the department for 19 years. First he worked in welfare centers and then\nhe worked as a case worker, he became a supervisor and worked with, in, in hotels,\nwelfare hotels where they put families who had been burned out and he saw to their,\ntheir need, whatever, you know, they required, he would get for them and he enjoyed\nthis type of work, it's like, we were very, very much alike in that respect, that he, he\nwas happy when he was with people, he was very outgoing, he liked the idea of\nhelping people, it appealed to his sense of altruism and so for him it was a good\nmove, the benefits were good and finally for the first time in our married lives, we\nwere able to live a little better than we had heretofore and as for me, I, of course my\nEva Edmands 32\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 32\nmother was still with us and we were all, at that point we were living in Greenwich\nVillage and we had two apartments side by side on Sullivan Street.",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: This would have been 1967. | went back to the Searing(ph) School in New York\nCity and asked them if they would rehire me and they said yes and so | wound up\ngoing with not Latin, but | taught French and German and English there. And...",
        "Q: And they still never, did they know at the time that you had no degrees?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But it wasn't an issue?",
        "A: It wasn't an issue because all they cared about, since they were a private school,\nthey didn't have to, you know, there was no certification and they knew | was\nqualified, probably better than some people who did have degrees and that's all they\ncared about, that | could do the work. And |! wound up staying there for 10 years, in\nthat school. Just, again, just doing the same thing, working with emotionally\ndisturbed kids. And we were able then to get, with two salaries coming in, steady\nwork coming in, we were able to get a better apartment and we moved to the Bronx,\nto a very nice building on the Grand Concourse, which was really a step. Even\nthough it wasn't Manhattan, we could not have afforded the rents for a decent\napartment in Manhattan and at the time, Bronx was still pretty nice and we had a two\nbedroom apartment, my mother had her own room and her own bathroom and it was,\nit was, it was a nice and we were comfortable there. So that's how things went on,\nmy husband working at the welfare department. Sometimes it was, it was\nEva Edmands 33\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 33\ndangerous work because he'd sometimes, he'd be called away at night. And | was,\n| was, | was worried about him a lot of times, that wno knows what might happen.\nAnd then in, so this went all through the, nothing really, you know, special happened.\nWe were able to make a couple trips together back to, to Austria and to France and\nto England.",
        "Q: What was it like going to France? Did you go to the countryside\nin southern France?",
        "A: Yes, well | wanted, it was very important for me to show my husband all the places\nwhere | had lived during the war and so we wound up really retracing all this. And |\nhad remained friends and in correspondence all these years with a man and his wife\nwho were the school teacher in the little one room school house in San Marten(ph)\non top of the mountaintop. And he was just 10 years older than | was. And\nmeanwhile they had moved to the town of Antsee(ph) and so we had been in\ncorrespondence and my husband and | looked them up and we stayed with them\nand were received very well. Of course the priest had died by then and we met the\nnew priest, who really didn't know that much about us. And we went to Vienna and\nmy cousin, my, my husband met my cousin and we went to Paris where | just had a\ncouple friends, no relatives and we went down to southern France and we went\nwhere we never did go to the village where we, we stayed during the war, we just, it\nwas, we had picked the wrong time of year and it was so death, really hot, that we\njust couldn't take the heat and so that's one place we didn't go to but we traced all\nthe other places | had lived and it was very important. | couldn't go back to the\nEva Edmands 34\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 34\nPhilippines to see where he had lived but at least he could see where | had lived, so\nthat, that kind of helped.",
        "Q: What did it feel like seeing this place again?",
        "A: Well it was, it was very emotional and you know when you, whenever we've been\nback to the mountaintop, things are not quite the same as | had remembered them.\nYou know, things change and, but you, it was an emotional meeting with all those\npeople and | had occasion to make more of these trips and each time, you know, the\nold feelings were there, they all came back.",
        "Q: Your mom, she stayed at home?",
        "A: Yeah, she stayed at home. She was able to make one trip back, in the 70's, |\ndon't recall exactly what date, but | managed to get her back to Vienna because |\nknew my aunt was pretty elderly by that time and ill with emphysema and my mother\nwas of course not in good shape either and we thought this would probably the very\nlast time that these two women would, sisters-in-law would get to see each other.\nSo somehow | managed, my mother and | went and my husband stayed behind in\nNew York, you know I, by means of getting wheel chairs for her at airports, | got her\nthere and it was a very emotional reunion in Vienna with her sister-in-law and we\nwound up staying in a little resort, a mountain in Austria and had a really nice time\nand my aunt died just about maybe a year later, so they had just, you know, able to\nsee each other. Then in, in 1983, my mother died. She, her health had been\n, she'd been seeing a doctor regularly and she was taking\nmedication. She had high blood pressure, which had caused her, her stroke in the\nEva Edmands 35\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 35\nfirst place. She had been taking medication for heart blood\npressure, but after all, she was 82 and her health had deteriorated, she had\ncongestive heart failure, she was hospitalized briefly and then just, the eve before my\nbirthday, on October 26, 1983, | walked in her room, as | did every morning to say\ngoodbye to her before | went to work and | found her dead in her bed. And so she\nwas 82 in '83, so that was, that was a shock, because we had, we had always been\nrather close and you know, the whole circumstances of her death, which is pretty\ntraumatic. And so we had a little, you Know, memorial service, invited her friends\nand, and she was cremated and so my husband and | were just the only ones left.\nAnd then after that things started going downhill for me, | had always suffered from\nanxieties and sometimes they were so severe | had the feeling | was choking in the\nmiddle of the night and couldn't breathe and he'd have to rush me to the emergency\nand | was put on tranquilizers, but then | started getting more and more depressed\nand | realized that, really afterward | realized that I'd always had a tendency, it tend\nto run in our family on my mother's side, but that | had never really been totally happy\nno matter what the circumstances were but | thought that was normal because | had\nno, | had no gauge. But | know that, the first thing was, | was, | couldn't sleep at\nnight and the less | could sleep the worse it got and was really hard for me to function\nand work. Oh, | have to backtrack a little bit, | worked at the Searing(ph) School as\n| said, for 10 years and then something else very bad happened. The owner died\nand the school was sold and all the teachers, everybody was out the street. We had\nno place to go, we were jobless...\nEva Edmands 36\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 36",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: This would have been in 1975. And so this was a shock, as | had liked the job\nand suddenly here we were, all out without jobs on the street and so at this point, |\ndecided | need to upgrade my, my office skills and | went and took a course in\nspeedwriting and passed that and then |, | saw a job that was advertised at\nSmithsonian Magazine, which was, they had their offices in New York City, they had\ntheir advertising, promotional services and circulation offices in New York City. The\nmain office, editorial was in Washington D.C., but they were putting out the\nSmithsonian Magazine in New York. So | applied, the job was for an executive\nsecretary and | got the job. And so | became secretary to the associate publisher\nand | was also in, they also put me in charge of customer service and | was\nconducting all the correspondence of the, client correspondence for Smithsonian\nMagazine and in a way it was probably the best job | ever had, the money was good,\nbenefits were good, it was semi, semi-civil service. But the atmosphere, the working\natmosphere was the best | had had because everybody was educated and it was a\nmix, you know and there were a lot of gay people there and Orientals and it was just,\nit was just a great, stimulating atmosphere. And| wound up working there from 1976\nto 1985. But...",
        "Q: So you were working there when your mom passed away?",
        "A: Yeah, right. But as | said, | started getting more and more depressed, | couldn't\nsleep and we went to see all kinds of doctors and started getting anti-depressants,\nwhich just didn't work. And! was going downhill. | wouldn't eat, my weight dropped\nEva Edmands 37\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 37\nand finally had to be hospitalized for depression and you know, I'd often thought, why\nwas it, it's so easy, would be very easy to say well the war did it. | think that probably\n| had it in my jeans because | said | had depression on, on, on my mother's side,\nsome relatives, but | think it probably needed a trigger and it probably, that the war,\nyou know, acted as a trigger and brought it all out. And | always had a tendency to\nreact to things many months after the event, you know. So it's hard to say and |\nknow that in my case it was a chemical imbalance, you know, hormonal imbalance,\nbut | was not responding to the, to the drugs and | was just doing worse.",
        "Q: What about therapy?",
        "A: Well, like psychotherapy or something? | was seeing this guy who was supposed\nto be a psychiatrist but he never helped me that | could see it, you know, | mean he\njust didn't do anything, it just kept getting worse and worse and worse.",
        "Q: Was he going back to your past or?",
        "A: Not really, he was not, he was not of the, the school, the analytical school of Freud\nwhere you go back to your past, he wasn't really interested in my past, he was just\ninterested in dealing with the present, you know. And he, he was just not very\neffective, | don't think. And...",
        "Q: How was your husband during all this time, was he understanding?",
        "A: Well, yeah, but he had, unfortunately he had problems of his own, he had become\nan alcoholic and he was in his world and | think that probably also triggered it because\nas long as my mother was alive, | felt | had an ally there, | had a friend, somebody |\ncould talk to and when she died | felt all alone. He was in his alcoholic haze, he\nEva Edmands 38\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 38\nmanaged to function but then he would just drink throughout the weekend and things,\nyou know, our marriage started to go downhill. We had had a very close marriage\nand things just started disintegrating. And | reached a point, you know, together with\nthe depression where | felt that there was nothing more for me to live for. | had, we\ndidn't have many friends because then, the Bronx became sort of bad area. People\nwere afraid to visit us at night and we were isolated. We were just really isolated.\nThe only contact | had with the outside world was people at work and then you got\nhome and ,",
        "Q: Did the people at work know what was going on?",
        "A: Yeah. And my boss was very understanding. She tried to get help for my\nhusband and she, she really, she was just absolutely wonderful, she, | must say, she\nwas just the most understanding boss | ever had. But things were just, | mean they\nwere just so, so bad, cause my husband couldn't deal with my illness because of his\nown addiction.",
        "Q: Was he working?",
        "A: He was working and at one point he was sent for, away, you know, to try to get\nalcohol rehabilitation and it didn't work. It didn't work. He was carrying some\nemotional baggage on his end because of his father having been killed and it, it came\nout in him too. So we were both living in our own miserable worlds. And so you\nknow, they reached a point where | couldn't work any more and they told me that,\nyou know, you just can't work any more and | had to leave my job because it was\nimpossible for me to concentrated because | couldn't sleep at night so | was of course\nEva Edmands 39\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 39\ntotally zonked out during the day. And | just had, and the job was getting more\ndemanding because of customer service, | would deal with angry people all day long\nand the pressure, | couldn't take pressure, that's one thing I've never been able to\ntake is pressure, any kind of pressure, since the war. So this didn't work out and my\nboss was very understanding, she managed to get me on disability and so then, that\nwas in 1985 and so then | remained alone at home, my husband went to work, | had\nlost a job | liked, | had no contact with anybody, was all alone on the 10th floor in an\napartment all day and, and |, and | was constantly thinking about doing away with\nmyself which | now realize is one of the classic symptoms of a major depression.\nAnd one day | actually did, I, | and | have to say, | wrestled with that because\nsomehow | felt, well if there was a God, he wouldn't be very happy and | felt it was\nlike throwing my life back at Him and that | would pay for it but | was and in such a\nstate that | just didn't think | could live the way | did. So one day while my husband\nwas work, | went in the bathtub and slit my wrists. And he found me there when he\ncame home and of course | had left the apartment, left and hid in the stairwell and\nthe police found me there and took me to the hospital and it was after that that | was\ntaken to the hospital and got shock treatments but they were not effective. They\nwere using and for a hospital was, Mount, no, Beth Israel Hospital in New York City\nand for a New York Hospital they used really antiquated methods.",
        "Q: This was in 198-?\nEva Edmands 40\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 40",
        "A: Oh this was, would have been in '85, mm-hm. They didn't treat me like a human\nbeing, they strapped me on a metal slab and they and they used no injections,\nnothing, | was aware what was going on, it was just horrible, it was like the snake pit.",
        "Q: Was there an over, a doctor overseeing your treatment?",
        "A: Yeah, that, supposedly that doctor that | was seeing, but it was not and, and the\nfunny thing, one recollection | have, because by that time | was getting paranoid too,\n| mean everybody was out to get me and | remember when | was going for these in\nthe hospital, one doctor came up to me and said to me, \"| hear that you're a holocaust\nsurvivor\" and | imagined that he said it as a, in an accusing way, you know and | kind\nof just pulled back and didn't say anything and | don't know why he said that, guess\nhe was trying to probably find out whether that had anything, get me to talk, but |\nclammed up and, because | was so paranoid, | thought, \"Oh this man is, you know,\nhe's going to kill me, he's like Hitler.\" So | didn't say anything. And so the shock\ntreatments didn't work, | was sent home.",
        "Q: How many, you remember the shock treatments?",
        "A: Yeah, oh golly yes, | had 10 and 10, you know. And | was in and out of the\nhospitals and then, so | came home and | was worse off than before.",
        "Q: Did you have any friends from work that were visiting you?",
        "A: No, they would call but | wouldn't answer anybody. | would take the phone off the\nhook and the few friends that | had finally gave up because they couldn't get ahold of\nme, | did not want to talk to anybody. | was totally, totally paranoid. And then, you\nknow, here | was back at home, all by myself, totally isolate, my husband was getting\nEva Edmands 41\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 41\nworse, of course because that of course, must have been a terrible shock for him, |\nmean. Sohehad more excuse. And so | thought, well didn't work the first time, got\nto try again. Sol made another attempt. And this time | decided | would do it out\nof the house, so | had saved up sleeping pills, | had carefully saved them up til |\nthought | had enough to kill myself and | took a bottle of sherry, checked myself into\na hotel in downtown Manhattan, under an assumed name. Took the whole bottle of\npills, drank the bottle of sherry and was absolutely convinced that this had to do it.\nWell | woke up in Belleview Hospital in the emergency room again and | don't know,\nit's a miracle, not only that I'm alive, but my mind is intact. It's just absolutely a\nmiracle. And I'm, the only thing | remember is the doctors there were trying to tell\nme to say who | was, so they could contact somebody and | wouldn't tell them. And\nhe finally wormed it out of me, a phone number and he called my husband, he came\nover and, so | was hospitalized, | got aspiration pneumonia, you know, from this old\nstuff. And then of course | had, when | got home, | had to go back for shock\ntreatments again, they didn't work. So...",
        "Q: How did your husband deal with this?",
        "A: Not well, | mean he just, he kind of fell apart, he really, he just totally fell apart\nand he, he was begging me, he said, \"Eva, | can't deal with this.\". And when |\nwouldn't eat, | mean he was so totally, he had no comprehension really, when |\nwouldn't eat, because | couldn't eat, he would go to balcony and threaten to jump,\nyou know, things like that. | mean he would just respond totally inappropriately\nbecause he didn't know, he didn't know how to deal with it. He had no\nEva Edmands 42\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 42\nand he had his own problem and it was just a terrible mess.\nAnd so finally we decided we couldn't stay in New York any more, that it was killing\nus. Because | wasn't making any money any more, | was just getting this little\ndisability check, but that didn't come for | think six months, you know, so. And so\nwe decided that our only salvation was to move out of New York and go back to\nLawrence, Kansas, where we felt safe. And my husband by that time, you know, he\nhad worked for the welfare for 19 years and he took early retirement, he was 62 at\nthe time, so he took early retirement. And we just, you know, got rid of our furniture\nand took what we could and packed up things and he had a book collection cause\nhe was, history, military history was his passion and we had 3,000 books, history\nbooks, so he all packed and sent out. And somehow, you know, | was just out of\nthe hospital, it was in June of '86 and we managed to, to come back, to go back to\nKansas and we found a place, an apartment for rent. But when | was here already,\nthen things went even farther, deteriorated with me, cause | didn't know anybody\nhere.",
        "Q: Well you had never resolved...",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You were going through the death of your mother...",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: ...and all that stuff, that you had never resolved that.",
        "A: No. And all the other stuff. And then the added pressure of living with an\nalcoholic, which is enough to test anybody's sanity, somebody who, whom you loved\nEva Edmands 43\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 43\nand who you watched destroy himself day after day afterday. It was just, there were\ntoo many pressures building up that | couldn't deal with. And so here we were in\nLawrence and | started getting worse, | was hospitalized again and then | was totally,\ntotally, | mean, | think another one of the symptoms is inability to make decisions. |\ncould not make the simplest decisions, what, what to wear or what to eat. | couldn't\ngo to a supermarket and pick out a single item, | mean it was just impossible, because\nyou couldn't concentrate. And you know, you wake up in the morning and you feel\nlike you have this huge, like a stone on your chest and you can't get up.",
        "Q: You weren't taking any medication?",
        "A: No, by that time | wasn't taking any medication and | got to be, | mean my normal\nweight is like 145 or so, | was down to 80 pounds, cause | couldn't eat and | was so\nweak and | was, everybody was out to kill me. If my, if we went to a fast food store,\n| was, | was convinced that they were putting rat poison in my hamburgers, you know,\nSO.",
        "Q: Were you seeing doctors here?",
        "A: Not at first, no. Until it got so bad and my husband felt | was going to die and |\nwas hospitalized and that didn't, they didn't do anything for me here in Lawrence. |\nmean they were not equipped and then finally on my husband's insistence, | was\ntransferred to the Kansas City Medical Center, KU- Med(ph) and finally, there, they\nstarted shock treatments again and this time they were state of the art, they gave you\nmuscle relaxant, they put you out and they worked. And | started coming around, it\nwas like a miracle. After 10, 10 shots or so, | was coming around and | had some\nEva Edmands 44\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 44\nvery good doctors, very understanding people. So | was coming out of depression\nand, but then, you know, my legs had swelled up terribly when | was in\nhospital, he had never caught it. And so when they thought |\ncould take it, they told me that | had a deep venous thrombosis, which is a blood clot\nin my leg and they were so afraid it was going to go to my lung, so | had to be, remain\nthe hospital although the depression was waning and | would have been able, but |\nwas immobilized for another three weeks and given blood clot dissolvers and, and\nthen, if that wasn't enough, then the doctor came to me one day and then kept taking\nblood and | thought, why are they taking so much blood and the doctor said | had a\nhemolytic anemia and | didn't know what that was, but two of my uncles on my\nmother's side had died of leukemia when they were in their 30's and | was absolutely\nsure that's what | had and they weren't telling me the truth. So | said, \"Is it\nleukemia?\" No, but they said it's a disease that causes the destruction of red blood\ncells, there was no, it was either acquired or inherited and there was no cure. So|\nthought, fine, you know, this is great. Got a blood clot, | got a fatal disease, this is\njust what | needed, you know. And so at this point | said, okay, is the first time | think\n| said, \"All right, | am not in control,\" and | talked to God, really and | said, \"I'm put\nmyself in your hands and do what you will, |, you know | mainly, | give up, it's your\nturn.\" And so they kept taking blood and then one day they came in they were\nshaking their heads, they said, we can't understand it, because your blood pictures\nis returning to normal. Your red cells are increasing and we don't know why. They\njust couldn't understand. And after a week | got well enough to leave and they\nEva Edmands 45\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 45\nwanted me to come back and have blood tests, you know, to make sure, because\nthey, they thought oh, this is a fluke and | came back a month later and there was no\nevidence of the disease, it was gone. And meanwhile, | had to have follow up for\nthe blood clot, you know, here in Lawrence, but that was, that was okay, and\neventually that was kind of all right and then they wanted me to have follow up\ntherapy, psycho-therapy for the depression and | went a couple times and | thought,\n\"| don't need this, I'm fine.\" You know?\n[end of side 1 of tape 2]",
        "Q: All this time...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You said that you didn't need the psychotherapy.",
        "A: | didn't need the psychotherapy, | felt that | could deal with, with things, | had to\ndeal with things on my own and you know, this has been, we're now, in 1996 and this\nwas 1986, | have not taken any medication since, no tranquilizer, no anti-depressant,\n| have not had any psychotherapy and | have been fine for 10 years. They didn't\nthink that this would happen, they thought, you know, it might come back in two years.\nThey never gave me a guarantee that there would be a total remission, but | been in\nthis remission for 10 years and | expect fully that | will remain so, because | made up\nmy mind that it was going to happen, that l...",
        "Q: What about your husband also, ?",
        "A: Well he was, he was going steadily downhill because | think retiring was really the\nworst thing that could have happened because now he had, he had no interest\nEva Edmands 46\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 46\noutside of his books. | encouraged him to volunteer, to maybe teach or, just on a\nvolunteer basis or get just his mind busy and he wouldn't do this, he just absolutely\nsunk into his alcoholic stupor and his health started deteriorating, his liver was going\nand then he was showing early signs of dementia. So it was a very, very difficult\ntime and | had to you know, cope with the whole thing, cause he was totally, | had to\ntake over all the finances, all the managing the household. He had been driving\nwhen we first came here and then | realized that he couldn't drive any more, it was\ntoo dangerous. But | didn't drive because we never had to have a car in New York\nCity and so at age 56, | had to take driving lessons and passed and got my license\nand started driving, which was, you know, it took a lot of courage for me to do this\nbecause | was really scared, but something strange happened when | left the Med\nCenter in 1986. First of all | decided, | don't Know what happened actually,\nsomething happened there, but all my priorities changed. All the things that had\nseemed so important to me before, you know, exterior things, appearance, whatever,\nwhat people thought of me, this didn't matter any more, it was a total reversal of\npriorities. All | thought was what really mattered now was to make my life count for\nsomething, cause | didn't know at that point, you know, how much time | had left, but\n| decided that | would conquer my inner demons my own way and | would be\nsuccessful at it. And so | wrote some rules for myself and | even pasted it on the\nmirror in my bedroom and it said, whatever these difficult tasks that | had to do, I'll\nsay, | can do it, | must do it, | will do it. And this helped me enormously when | had\nto take driving lessons, | was scared stiff and | had to pass the test, but | did that.\nEva Edmands 47\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 47\nThen, when we first, when | first came out of the hospital in '86 in Lawrence, |\nsuddenly found that | had acquired a fear of going, agoraphobia, fear of going outside\nbecause probably because | had been cooped up in hospitals for so long and | had\nthis absolute fear of going outside and, even you know, just in front of the house and\nif my husband was still driving at that time and we'd go to a\nsupermarket and | would cling to him and | would beg him not to leave me\nbecause | would be absolutely panic stricken, so this was this\nlingering thing, but it was a new thing which | never had before, which | had to\nconquer. So | decided that | wasn't going to be, you know, home bound and\nbecause of this and so | decided | would go down, because we lived on the third floor,\n| would go downstairs and | would set a goal, | would walk as far as the street and\nthen boy if | could do that, that was fine. Then the next day | set a goal that was a\nlittle farther. And so little by little, over a period of some weeks, | got to the point\nwhere | could walk to a supermarket, which was about a half a mile each way, to my\nhouse and when | could do that, then | Knew I'd gotten over my phobia and | would\nbe fine, but...",
        "Q: Did your husband realize how you were improving yourself so much?",
        "A: | don't think so, because what, what happens with alcoholics, that they're totally\nself-centered. This is not criticism, you know, it's not a criticism, but he was so\nwrapped up in his world that he, he could not realize what was going on, he just\ncouldn't.",
        "Q: So you were completely alone in this?\nEva Edmands 48\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 48",
        "A: Completely alone. And so that's why | knew that, who, he, to whom | always\nlooked to in the beginning, you know, in the early years he was my rock and my\nsecurity and | suddenly realized that | couldn't count on him for support for anything\nand that | was really on my own and | had to do everything on my own. And it was,\n| guess in a way, | had to take over the finance as | said and | guess in a way it was\na good thing because when he died, | was just totally, you know, at a lost, know what\nto do, | mean | had prepared myself psychologically for this event, cause the doctor\nhad told me at one point he had six months to live because his liver's going and\nexactly six months later he was dead. But well, you know, this was in 1993, he died,\nhe was 69 years old, but in the meantime, | decided that you know, | had to do\nsomething with my life, | wasn't just going to, | was never one that could just sit home\nand do nothing and so first | went and signed up to teach reading in an adult literacy\ncourse to people, adults who couldn't read and | did that for awhile and then | went\nto the public library and volunteered my services here in Lawrence, cause | told them\n| had worked at the University Library and so | would be volunteering there once a\nweek and then | thought | should put my language knowledge to some use and so |\nwent to the senior center and they didn't have any language classes and | told them\nthat | taught French and German and offered to teach classes and they were very\nglad to have somebody there who could do this. And so over the years | built up a,\nyou know, a membership and it's been going since, oh 1987, we have two classes\nthat meet regularly at the, French classes. | had German classes on and off, but\nthey didn't take off as well as the French classes, but all told | had about 15 people\nEva Edmands 49\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 49\nand they'll be University, retired University professors from all, people really from all\nwalks of life, but it's been, this has been my salvation, to, to have this and to get back\ninto teaching again, which is what | really liked best of all, of all the jobs I've had.",
        "Q: You think you would have studied teaching?",
        "A: Yeah, | mean, if | had been able to, the other thing | always regretted, | wanted to\nbe a librarian, but of course you know, college degree, going to\nlibrary school, it's all these dreams that | could never fulfill. But that, yeah | probably\nwould have gone quite a way if |, if I'd had the opportunity for the education, but in\nthis way | felt | could make a contribution to the community. And then...",
        "Q: And your husband was still alive during those?",
        "A: Yeah, right. And then, we joined a local Unitarian fellowship here. And my\nhusband went for awhile, but not very long, he got tired of that and he wouldn't go\nand | went by myself. Made some friends there and slowly | started telling them\nabout my background again, you know, during the Holocaust and | was a little leery\nbecause, in the midwest, you know, | always, you had this feeling, misconception\nthat people are narrow minded and you know, you know, | was still afraid of rejection\nand discrimination but | found that people were so interested because in New York,\nHolocaust survivors are a dime a dozen, but here really, they don't have this access\nand | found out that they were very interested. And so this encouraged me and so\nat the fellowship on Sunday, they have programs on Sunday mornings, they have\noutside speakers and speakers from their own group and so they encouraged me to\ngive atalk. And this is the very first time that | talked publicly about what happened.\nEva Edmands 50\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 50\nAnd it was a great success and of course | was very nervous, I've never done, and\nthere's another thing that | had. | had of course, terrible stage fright all my life, even\njust on the, in very small groups, if | had to get up in a group of four people and make\na brief announcement, | was just, my knee turned to jelly and so | thought, oh, you\nknow, how can | face all these people? And then again, | put this thing to work and\n| said, | have to do it and I'm going to conquer this and | made up my mind | wasn't\ngoing to be afraid and then | wasn't. And from the first talk after that, | could go up\nthere and it wouldn't matter whether there were 500 people, 100, | was not scared\nany more. And some people heard me, local teachers and they ask me to speak to\ntheir students and so | built up a reputation, it was all word of mouth and at times |\nmyself went out and contacted different groups, primarily church groups and other\norganizations and little by little, you know, | acquired a reputation as a Holocaust\nspeaker and now I've been doing this since basically 1987 and to date I've kept a log\nbut | haven't really added it up but at last count, which was last year, I'd given over\n130 talks. And now | concentrate primarily on children from grades six to 12 and\nI'm, you know, a registered speaker with the, our local school system, | go to all the\nsecondary schools and | also get calls from vicinities outside of Lawrence, you know,\nin the state of Kansas. And | have, | have written the book that | had written during\nthe war, which is translated into English, | had given to every, copies to every\nsecondary school in Lawrence, so that the kids can access it in the public library as\nwell. And so this, during the school year, I'm very busy, going from school to school\nand giving talks.\nEva Edmands 51\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 51",
        "Q: The book, you said this book that you wrote?",
        "A: Mm-hm?",
        "Q: This is about your war experiences?",
        "A: This is about, it's called Childhood Memoirs of World War 2, and as | said, it's from\na diary | kept as a child when | was 14 and eventually translated to English so that\nmy husband and my friend here could read it. And | have found that, of course I've\ngotten other invitations from civic groups, church groups, just a variety of groups and\nI've always been amazed how great the desire for knowledge is, cause people really\nknow very little about what happened during that period. And how warmly | am\nreceived and | have hundreds and hundreds of letters from school children,\nhandwritten little notes to say how much they appreciated my talking and it's been\nmy raison d'\u00e9tre. \\It's been a catharsis for me and | have, you know, my speech\ntotally memorized, never refer to notes, | have visuals, | collect things out of the paper,\nanything having to do with the Holocaust and | keep adding to that. And so | feel\nthat, you know, because before | was ashamed to speak and now I'm, I'm kind of,\nyou know, making up for that and | always tell people when | give the talks that there\nare some reasons why | do this, because sometimes people say, you know, \"Why\ndo you do this?\" And why you put, they think it's really difficult for me and emotional\nand | said, \"Well, in the beginning it was, but after awhile you manage to get a certain\ndistance, emotional distance from your subject, because if | were emotionally, you\nknow, involved, every time | give a talk, | couldn't do it. And so I've had to learn to\ndisassociate myself as though it were really not my story, it's the only way I, | can do\nEva Edmands 52\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 52\nit. And | found out that's a coping mechanism that you learn instinctively during the\nwar is you kind of put away things that you don't want to deal with and that's a self-\npreservation thing. So | tell them there are three reasons why | give this talk, is, one\nis to keep alive the memory of the six million victims of Hitler, including my\ngrandparents. And two is to counter the, the revisionist lies of people who would\nsay that, you know, there was no Holocaust, oh it was exaggerated, it wasn't as bad\nand then third is so it wouldn't ever happen again and in the end | ask the kids, | said,\n\"| need your help in keeping the story alive, because we are called the last witnesses\nand my fear is that once, once we're gone, my generation, there won't be anyone left\nto keep the story alive, so I'm counting on you.\" And, and you know, I've gotten\nthese darling little letters, they said, \"Don't worry Mrs. Edmands, we won't ever forget\nyou, what you said,\" and you know, it was very, very, very gratifying and I've never\nencountered any hostility, I've talked to all different kinds of groups and they've\nalways been most friendly, there's never any hostile comments or anything like that.\nBut the one wonderful experience | had, well one good experience was in 1990, when\nFather Longiree(ph), the priest who had really hidden us and saved our lives had\nbeen awarded the Medal of the Just, from Yahdvashem(ph) and then organizers in\nhis hometown of Antsee(ph), which is the town closest to where his parish was,\ndecided to have a commemorative ceremony for him and from some other priests\nwho had helped people like us. And | was invited to the ceremonies, which were\nheld in 1990, in May 1990 and | stayed with my friend there and it was just a\nwonderful, wonderful ceremony, they had dignitaries from Yahdvashem(ph), from\nEva Edmands 53\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 53\nIsrael they had the Grand Rabbi of the region, they had priests and ministers and\npeople from the French government and some 600 invited guests and | was able to\nagain tell, talk, tell these people, in French this time, about the priest and what he\nhad done for us and then since he had died, his medal was awarded to him\nposthumously and it was given to me and | asked that the medal be put in a glass\ncase and put in his former church so that everybody would, would see it. So this\nwas one of the high points. And then | found out about other priests and their heroic\ndeeds and all the wonderful things they had done, so | came back with a whole\ncollection of stories of just, you know, sheer heroism and what | was pointing out is,\nthe heroes during World War 2 were not the generals, you know, and who won the\nwar, like MacArthur and so on, because that was their job. It was the little people,\nthe little people were the true heroes. And you, you met, you know, instances of\naltruism which you would never think possible. People risking their lives and their\nfamilies lives to help strangers. At the risk of their own lives, see. So that was, that\nwas just a unique experience. Then a year later, in 1991, | found out that there was\na new organization formed called, for people who had been hidden as children during\nWorld War 2. Now there already have been organizations for Holocaust survivors\nand they've had regular meetings but they're mostly for people who had been in the\ncamps. And we were a breed apart, and you know, and somebody finally\nrecognized that, because and we were sort of a little bit disparaged by the people\nwho'd been in camps, they say, \"Oh well, you know, you didn't go through what we\ndid.\" And that's true. But, on the other hand, we had a very unique problems as\nEva Edmands 54\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 54\nchildren being hidden, having to live day after day with the terror of being discovered,\nbeing separated from your loved ones. It was situation all by itself and it deserved\nsome recognition. So the Hidden Children was formed. They had the first\ninternational reunion of Hidden Children in New York City at the Marriott Hotel in\n1991, three day and they had workshops and sessions. And\nthey had originally expected some 500 people and 1600 showed up. From all,\nliterally all parts of . People came from Australia, Poland, you know,\nGermany, Great Britain, just all over the world. And in addition to the former hidden\nchildren, they also had rescuers who came and for some, some were very, very\nelderly, some were on crutches or in wheelchairs and for some it was their very first\nreunion with the, the children that they had rescued, so it was very emotional. And\n| had, you know, | wanted to go, but | had mixed feelings about it. | thought | knew\nall there was to know about the Holocaust, | said, oh well, you Know. And |, | was\nafraid in a way, stirring up all those memories, cause | said okay | talk about it, that's\nfine, but emotionally I'm detached, why stir up this? But in the end, | went and | was\nso glad | did. Because the minute | walked in there, | suddenly, you know, here, |\nwho had never been raised Jewish and now all these people, all Jewish and that was\nsuch a bond, there's just immediate bond. You felt that all these people, after just a\nfew hours, that they were your brothers and sisters. It was the most wonderful\nfeeling. A lot of them were my age, some were older. The age ranged from 50's to\nyou know, /O0's and 80's. First woman | met there was a woman, | mean she was a\nprototype of an Aryan, she was blonde hair, blue eyes, porcelain skin, Jewish, had\nEva Edmands 95\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 55\nbeen abandoned, not really abandoned, but left by her mother in Poland when she\nwas two years old. Her mother had dropped her on doorstep of a convent to save\nher and her mother didn't make it and she was raised by gentiles. And so she and\n| met and she was very, she still had a lot of bitterness towards, you know, the\nGermans and cause she had then somehow found, an uncle found her and she'd\nfound her true roots and she moved to Arizona, married a Jewish man, now she's\nvery active. But she was very, she had a lot of bitterness about, you know, German\npeople and, and really not knowing that much about her background cause she was\nso young. But you know, there were just million stories there and we had some very\ninspirational speakers, we had Elie Wiesel(ph) and Serge Klaufeld(ph), the famous\nFrench Nazi hunter there. And then we had workshops,\nworkshops and we had a list of things we could choose, for instance, the issue of\nguilt. People who felt guilty, as | did and then there were workshops for people who\ndidn't know who they were, whether they were Christian or Jewish because they had\nbeen raised by Christians and they had this kind of schizophrenic attitude to weather.\nSo | went to several of workshops and | was listening to the people talking and then\n| thought, this can't be, they're telling my story. And in so many instances the stories\nthey told were so similar to mine, they were rescued by a priest, you know\n. [mean it was almost like they'd taken pages out of my book, |\ncould not believe this, it was, it was spooky, you know, it was really spooky.",
        "Q: Who sponsored this whole thing?\nEva Edmands 56\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 56",
        "A: Well, it was called the Hidden Children which was an organization that had been\nformed by former hidden children.",
        "Q: Did it have anything to do with the Holocaust Museum, or?",
        "A: No, nothing at all, no, it was just all independent.",
        "Q: Had you already done your testimony?",
        "A: At the Holocaust Museum yes, uh-huh, but this was something that just came up\nand then since then they've had other reunions every two years on Israel and Los\nAngeles, but | haven't gone to any others. And then you know, they have workshops\nfor people say, who had been very young, rescued by Christians and raised as\nChristians and they were totally divided in their allegiance because they, they felt\nthey owed some allegiance to the Christians who rescued them and yet they felt they\nalso had an allegiance to their Jewish and they were, they had conflicts that they\ncouldn't resolve and those conflicts resolved it in psychological problems and, and |\ncould really identify with them because this is the way | felt, even though | was never\nraised Jewish, | felt more Christian than | felt Jewish, cause that's the only thing |\nknew. When yet! have guilt feelings because I'm not practicing the Jewish religion,\nbut | really, | only learned about the Jewish religion when | made contact with\nChristianity. It's the first time | ever read the old testament. So | don't have any\nemotional bond with Judaism.",
        "Q: Are you a religion now, are you practicing religion?",
        "A: Yes, now | consider myself a, you know, a Protestant, | have joined a Lutheran\nchurch because of the fact that it is the closest to me to Old Testament, you know,\nEva Edmands of\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 57\nreligion, that, more so than others. Cause | had become somewhat of a Bible\nscholar and read a lot, you know, read the whole Old Testament and New Testament\nand | feel that in a way, Christianity has enabled me to find my Jewish roots and yet\n| cannot be Jewish. | cannot be Jewish because there are things that, you know,\njust are foreign to me.",
        "Q: Like what?",
        "A: And | feel, you know, it's the same God, you know, it's, it's the same thing.",
        "Q: Well when you were in the hospital and you talked to God that first time, was that...",
        "A: Yeah, he didn't have any religion.",
        "Q: That was just God?",
        "A: Yeah. That was just, yeah, right. Which this is, | mean there is no, God doesn't\nknow how to have a religion.",
        "Q: When you were, when you had your, the testimony, the video that | saw, you had\njust or you were still kind of, well | guess you had just come out of a real hell. None\nof that came out in the video. Was that your own decision, that you didn't, or is it\njust because they didn't ask you the questions?",
        "A: No, cause | was just, it was just talking about my life during, you know, the\nHolocaust and that's what | did.",
        "Q: So what you've been through in the...",
        "A: Since?\nEva Edmands 58\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 58",
        "Q: Well all that, everything that you went through, the suicide attempts and your\nshock treatments, have you spoken with other Holocaust survivors and children like\nat that conference?",
        "A: Yeah, a little bit, you know, you could only do it very peripherally but there were\nothers who had come to this thing, same thing, who had been hospitalized and there\nwere some who were still in treatment, they had been in treatment for the last 20\nyears. And still going to psychiatrists and still trying to resolve these issues and | felt\na lot more fortunate, you know, that | had been able, cause some people, | think they\nuse it as a crutch and they don't move on. There were people who, who kept living\nin the past, that's, you know, that's the thing. And | determined that that didn't do\nany good. The past is past, now is now and you have to make your life count. You\ncan't, you know, what if and the same thing that, is business of bitterness, you know,\nprofound bitterness, | can never forgive the Nazis. Well | heard something very\ninteresting, at the, when we went to commemorative ceremony\npriest about this business of not being able to forgive and said, \"It is not up to the\nliving to forgive, only the dead can forgive and they can't, you know and they're dead.\"\nBut it's not up to us to either, you know, hate or forgive and | do not have any\nbitterness to anyone, because bitterness and hate, in this context is a self-destructive\nemotion. It really doesn't hurt anyone else, doesn't hurt the Nazis, it only hurts\nyourself, it can destroy you. And | realized that | couldn't let that destroy me and that\nlove was a much more powerful emotion than hate. You know, that love could\naccomplish things that hate couldn't and so therefore | have no bitterness in my heart\nEva Edmands 59\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 59\ntoward anyone. Not even to the people who killed my grandparents because it's, it's\nnot a concrete thing, you know.",
        "Q: The years that you were really growing and prospering and | take it your husband\nwas really falling apart, was he aware of what was happening with you, of how much\nyou were growing and getting better? | know | asked you that before, you said that,\nfrom the time that he started getting really sick, was he able to comprehend that you\nwere actually finally coming out of this hell that you were in?",
        "A: Just maybe on one level, but only on one very elementary level. He was proud\nof what | was doing, yes, he was always proud and he always encouraged me, but\non the other hand, he resented my being away from home so much. You know, he\nfelt | should be there with him all the time, night and day. And he came to resent,\nhe was really of two minds about it. In one way he was proud of me and the other\none he resented my success. Because he always regarded himself as a failure, you\nknow. He had this terrible inferiority complex. | don't know why, cause he was a\nbrilliant man. But that's part of the syndrome, so as | say, he was always of two\nminds about it.",
        "Q: When, when you look back at this now and you look back at the time that your,\nwhen your mom died, can you kind of piece together, has it been long enough so that\nyou can piece together what happened to you exactly, that her loss really kind of\ntriggered all this stuff?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nEva Edmands 60\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 60",
        "A: Yeah, | think it triggered it because | really had no one to talk to but her and when\nshe was gone, | had no one to express my feelings of frustration and fear and anger\nand resentment that | had bottled up inside of me.",
        "Q: She was your best friend...",
        "A: She was my best friend and she was very understanding, | could talk to her about\nanything. So, and | know she was suffering a lot.\nEnd of Tape 2.\nEva Edmands 61\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 61\nTape 3",
        "A: It was, she was suffering a lot because she saw how, you know, my husband's\nalcoholism was destroying the marriage and destroying us. And so when she was\ngone, it's though as somebody just pulled the rug out from under me, | had lost every\nsupport that I've ever had.",
        "Q: Talk about your life now. Now, now that you're, you have friends, you have a full\nlife. When did you move into your house?",
        "A: | moved into my house three years ago and it was the very first time that | had\never owned a house, we had always lived in apartments and it was a lifelong dream\nto own something that was really mine and to have a little garden and to grow stuff.\n| feel blessed in so many ways, cause |, | can truly say, | don't have, you know, that\nmuch money, | have a small pension to live on, but | can pay my mortgage and | can\npay my bills and | feel blessed because | have everything now that | have ever\nwanted. | have peace of mind and | don't really have any worries, | take care of\nmyself. My husband died in 1993 as | said and that was, that was a hard blow, but\nit wasn't unexpected because he had been so ill and he was just absolutely\ndetermined to kill himself. He had, he did have a death wish, which for reasons that,\nyou know, | will never know and he was just absolutely determined to do away with\nhimself. And, and | figure, well he finally got his wish and then, but | realized that life\nhad to go one and so going on with my life and buying the house was, was the first\nstep and | had already quite a circle of friends too, my volunteer work and to other\norganizations, so | just really kept doing what, what | was doing before, only now |\nEva Edmands 62\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 62\ndidn't feel guilty about it for being away from home. And during the school year as |\nsaid, | give talks and | still volunteer at the public library and otherwise | keep busy.\nThere's always housework to be done, garden work. | go, | take walks, | read a lot,\nI'm trying to learn more about history, especially during the pre-Nazi period to find out\nwhat happened, that what were the circumstances that led to the rise of Nazis in\nGermany. | have a lot of, lot of different interests, I've interest in linguistics and\nhistory, geology, so many different things, that I'll probably never be able in a lifetime\nto satisfy them all, but I'm fortunate that | have a nice library and it keeps me busy.\nAnd | try, you know, | take some trips. And, oh, one of the main things that | wanted\nto relate is | had a very unusual experience last year in October. | had, during the\nwar, after we left Paris, in 1940 or so, we wound up in a little village in southern\nFrance, called Kalvisol(ph) and there we stayed for a year when my father was in the\nlabor camp there and then, this was at the time, the free zone, the rest of France\nbeing occupied by Germany. And then when the Germans broke their pact with\nFrance to, to leave part of France free and occupied the southern zone, my father's\nlife was again in danger. And so due to a local partisan pastor, who was also the\ntown doctor, we were able to get away cause he had made a certificate saying my\nfather had a dangerous illness and couldn't be moved and he also arranged for my\nfamily to get fake ID's that enabled us, with fake names that enabled us to finally\nleave this village and the rest is recorded, you know, what followed after that is\nrecorded in the original video | made for the Holocaust Museum in Washington. But\nwe had never, none of us had ever gone back, except for my father, he made a trip\nEva Edmands 63\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 63\nback to that little village and among other places, somewhere in the, you know, | don't\nknow, 60's or so, I'm not sure, early 70's, but he went on his own. And he did see\nthis pastor and his wife and then this pastor died at age 90 in 1974. So |, for my\npart, had lost all contact with the village. And then a strange thing happened, | had\ngiven a copy of my book to the people in the town of Antsee(ph). The Archbishop\nwanted a copy because you know, it was about a priest and so on and then the\norganizers of the commemorative ceremony for the priest, with whom | had become\nvery good friends and we'd been corresponding and they had come and visit us here,\nSO we were really good friends by then. And they had lent my book to a friend of\ntheirs who was a priest and of course, he knew Father Longiree(ph), but then, when\nhe came to the chapter that dealt with the one year that we spent in southern France,\nthe name of the town, Kavisol(ph) rang a bell. He said, \"Oh, | know that town, | know\nsomebody who lives there.\" And you know, it was such a coincidence because of\nall the places in France it could have been, this particular one he knew. And it was\njust a tiny hamlet. And what happened, this man named Marcel Coulier(ph), was a\nyoung man during the war and he was hiding from, he didn't want, all young\nFrenchmen have to do forced labor in Germany and those who didn't want to do that\nwent underground. And this priest that helped this young man hide, and they had\nstayed in contact and then many, many years later, you know this man had moved\nto Paris, gotten married and then in his retirement he came back to the town of\nKalvisol(ph) and where he was living. And so this priest copied my chapter that dealt\nwith our lives in southern France and send it to his friends, hey look you know, this\nEva Edmands 64\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 64\ntalks about your town. And of course then, oh this is just extraordinary cause this\nfriend shared it with, he had made some very good friends in the village and he\nshared it with all them. And they were just so thrilled, because not only here's\nsomebody had written about their village, so long ago and they said everything was\naccurate, the names, everything was accurate in every detail. And of course they\ndidn't know that their pastor had done all this cause he wasn't one to, to brag about\nit. So they were terribly excited and they got in contact with me and we started\ncorrespondence and we talked on the phone and it just so happened that just at the\ntime when they discovered my existence in America, they were planning a ceremony\nfor the pastor because there was a new part of town that was street that needed a\nname and so they decided to name the street after this pastor, so everything was in\nplace and then they found out about me and what this pastor had done, which they\ndidn't even know, you know. They just named the street because he was a good\nman and as doctor he had brought many of them to life, so they want to honor him,\nbut they had no idea what he done during the war. So then of course they wanted\nme to come to the ceremony and there was just too short notice, you Know, amount.\n| said | can't, you know, | just can't pick up and go in April, in the middle of my busiest\ntime. So | said, well | tell you what, they said, \"Well could you write something and\nwe could read?\" So | said I'd do that. So | wrote a little soeech in French and\nmailed it to them and it was read at the ceremony and they had other dignitaries and\nof course they told the whole story. The newspaper picked it up and it was such a\nbig deal and they send me the articles and it was almost comical because it said,\nEva Edmands 65\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 65\n\"Jewish girl, former resident of Kavisol(ph),\" you know, \"found living in America.\" So\nyou know, | was like, ha, it was so funny, it was the biggest thing that ever happened\nto them, in that of the village, maybe. And so, and | was in\ncontact basically with this one man who had been the organizer of the family and\nthere were three families that were friends besides Marcel Coulier(ph) and his wife\nand then two other couples and they were, they had form an organization as the\nfriends of Dr. Bonet(ph), which is the name of this pastor priest. So all my\ncorrespondence was with them and we just became really good friends and then |\nstarted remembering names of people I'd gone to school with. And | wrote it to them\nand he said, \"Yeah that's true and they remember you.\" You know, things started\ncoming back. And then those darling people made a video tape, not only of the\nceremony, where | could just watch myself where they, while they read the speech\nI'd written, but they made a videotape of the town and sort of going around and\nsaying, this is school you went to and this is that abandoned house you lived in, it's\nalways just wonderful. But then of course they kept putting the pressure on me, they\nwanted to meet me and | had to promise them that | would come, you know and visit\nthem. And the following year | finally decided okay, it's now or nothing, you know.\nAnd | mean, they were so nice, you know, in letters so cordial, but | didn't know them.\nYou know, you go to a strange place, you don't know anybody, | felt a little bit, but |\nsaid, \"This is something | have to do.\". Because | felt that | had honored the priest\nbut there was still a page that had to be written in this book. It's closure, you know.\nSo then | turned out that my friends in Antsee(ph), knew this other couple, the\nEva Edmands 66\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 66\nCouliers(ph), they had become friends and so my friend in Antsee(ph) said, \"If you\ncome, come stay with us and then we will take you by car to this village.\" Cause\notherwise | said, you know, \"How am | going to get there, it's like in the middle of\nnowhere.\" And so that's what | wound up doing and originally | just was planning\nwhen | planned my trip, | planned, you know, two or three days because | said, \"I\ndon't Know these people.\" | didn't even know where | was going to stay. And then\nwhen | wrote my dates, they said, \"Oh, this will never do, this'll never do, you're going\nto have to stay with us for a week at least, cause we have all these plans.\" And you\nknow, you have, so | had to change all my flights, everything. Finally went to\nAntsee(ph) and then they drove me there. | come there and the three family met\nme and | mean, | mean, | felt like a rock star. | mean, it was just the most wonderful\nwelcome and it turned out that of the three couples, | Knew the husband and wife\ncause I'd gone to school with them. And then of course they called in the media,\nthey had a reporter from a local paper come and interview me and they had more\narticles in the paper and | mean, this was big deal and they took me around and the\nnext day to the village to show me all the places where I'd grown up and they were\nso thrilled, | mean they took more pleasure and maybe even more than | did, but it\nwas weird for me to see it, abandoned house where my family had lived. And you\nknow, it all looked really, basically, | mean it was upgraded, but you know, all these\nmemories keep coming back, but they were not bad memories, you know, even\nthough they were bad times, but it was just so good and to see the people that were\nso wonderful. And then they had, when | first and | stayed with one of the couples\nEva Edmands 67\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 67\nand my goodness, | had a whole, practically a whole house to myself, my own\nquarters, they were pretty well off, you Know it was wonderful. And then the first day\n| was there he pulled out a long list of things and complete, complete schedule,\nitinerary. Every day, every hour planned, what they were going to do with me. And\nthey had realized that when | lived there during the war, you know, | didn't have time,\n| mean there was no time to go sightseeing and there are a lot of beautiful things, so\nthey determined they're going to take me to the seashore, they're going to take me\nto the mountain, surrounding towns, you know, the whole bit. So in one week we\nwere constantly on the way, we got in the van in the morning, came home at night\nand just went all around the countryside and | saw all these things | just had heard\nabout and they were just, | mean of course, | was totally their guest, never pay a cent\nfor anything and | got charming gifts, | couldn't go to a gift shop they want to buy me\neverything in the store. It was, it was so wonderful and then they had organized two\nceremonies, one was at the little, little village where my father had been in the labor\ncamp. There was an official reception at City Hall, | was received by the mayor,\nspeeches, you know, the whole bit. And then there was another ceremonies, very\nsimilar one, in that little village itself. Again with the mayor, the City Council, the\nwhole bit, you know, the people coming up to me and | got a medal. And | gota\nplaque and flowers and oh! And | kept saying to them, | don't know why they're\ndoing all this, | didn't do anything to deserve this, all | did was live there for a year.\nAnd they said, \"Oh, but you don't understand.\" And then you know, sort of talking\nto people later, it came to me that it was more about them than it was about me. It\nEva Edmands 68\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 68\nmade them feel good. It showed them that there had been good people in their\ntown, because you see, anyone of them, they knew we were living there, anyone of\nthem could have denounced us and nobody talked, which is remarkable. Nobody\ntalked. And | guess that made them feel good and it made them\nand some of them were too young to even remember the war\nand they learned something and they actually met somebody, you know, who had\nlived among them and it was just a great experience for them and forme. So it was\njust probably the most, the best experience of my life.",
        "Q: That's amazing. Do you have future plans? Anything happening that you want\nto, that you can talk about? What do you want to do, | mean you're still relatively\nyoung, what do you want to do with your life?",
        "A: No, | don't because | have learned not to plan ahead to far. | just take each day\nas it comes and | don't really plan that far. | don't, | don't have any, any immediate\nplans. What | hope to do is that, | got a letter, last year, from the Austrian\ngovernment saying that after all these years they're recognizing that they did us alla\nbig, great wrong and they were going to make financial restitution just for the fact\nthat, you know, we were forced to leave a country and | was deprived an education\nand so on and so they finally, Germany has done this a long time ago, but Austria's\nbeen dragging their feet and there's supposed to be a lump sum given to people like\nme, not enormous you know, under 10,000. But first they're getting the very old\npeople, people in their 80's and their 70's, so my turn probably won't come for a year\nor two and | thought, well, if that were the case, I'd like to just kind of go back to\nEva Edmands 69\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 69\nAustria and just stay there for a month or two months, you know and just, instead of\ngoing back and forth and really, you know, just stay there, because | do love Austria,\nit's a beautiful country, but | couldn't do this unless | had this, so this is really the only\nplan | have.",
        "Q: What about plans with dating, meeting other men, is that something you ever even\nthink about?",
        "A: No. No, | have, you know, | have absolutely no interest in meeting men. _| feel\nwell, okay, | mean my husband and | had a good marriage except for his alcoholism.\n| just felt that | could never meet anybody with whom | was as well suited as | was\nwith him. And to me that's not really important because any, | know that any man |\nwould meet would be at least my age or older and | think it's a matter of self-\npreservation that | don't want to deal with somebody, getting attached to somebody\nand that person getting sick and dying, you know. _| finally at the point where | really\nonly have to worry about myself and | don't want to get emotionally involved with\nanyone else, ever.",
        "Q: But you feel that you have friends that are like a family to you?",
        "A: Yeah, well yes, you know, | have good friends and | don't really find that | don't\nreally, | mean if | didn't have, it's nice to have friends, but I'm perfectly comfortable\nwith myself, because | think, | think they say that people who don't like being alone,\nit's that they don't like themselves and this was true at some point in my life, but now\n| got to the point, | say, | like who | am, you know what, I've accepted that and I'm feel\ncomfortable with who lam. So! don't mind being alone because | have my music,\nEva Edmands 70\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 70\n| listen to records, | read books. I'm never, never lonely and I'm never bored. _| feel\nthat my life is rich enough as it is, | don't need a man if | want to go to the movie | can\npay myself, you know, pay my way. So it's, it's not, it's not something that's part of\nmy life any more.",
        "Q: And Lawrence is your home?",
        "A: Lawrence is my home, yes, | feel, you know I've always wanted to live in a small\ntown and | would never, you know, I've gone back to New York City a number of\ntimes just for a visit, although now | don't have anybody left there and | thought, oh, |\nwould never want to live there any more, never. I'm glad I'm, I'm thankful. You\nknow I, well here's another thing. | feel now that everything that happens in life,\nhappens for a purpose, good or bad, that we may not always know what the purpose\nis, but it's not all for us to question. But nothing happens for no reason, so | can see\na trend to my entire life, that things had happened and there's always worked out for\nthe good at the end and if | hadn't had this depression, we may not have come to\nLawrence and then | would have wind up in New York City and maybe my husband\nwould have died in New York and | would have been even more alone because\nthere's nothing like being alone in a big city, you can be surrounded by millions of\npeople and still feel all alone and I've never had this feeling here. So and | would\nhave never had my house and | mean, everything just works out for the good in the\nend, if you just trust.",
        "Q: Your decision to speak out, a lot, meant, | think what is being learned is that it's\ncommon for a lot of people not to talk about what happened...\nEva Edmands 71\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 71",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: ...until they get a little bit older. Did you find that at this conference, did people\ntalk about that?",
        "A: Well, you know, | found that a lot of people, a lot of people this was, the conference\nwas the very first time they ever talked about what happened. This gave them, you\nknow, the venue. A lot of people don't want to deal with it, they want to put it behind\nthem and | think people like me and say Jack Mandelbaum(ph) are, are the exception\nreally. | mean there are some Holocaust speakers in New York, but overall, a lot of\npeople | met, some friends of mine who lost their parents you know, in Auschwitz,\nthey just now starting to talk publicly about it, so.",
        "Q: What about dreams, do you find that you dream anything?",
        "A: | don't have any dreams about the past, no nothing connected with the past.",
        "Q: We really, we've talked about how you feel about God.",
        "A: Yeah, the only thing | want to say is that | don't want people, especially people\nlistening to this interview to, to misunderstand, that | have in no way turned my back\non my Jewish heritage, | am proud of my Jewish heritage. | think it's a great, glorious\nheritage. But on the other hand, | had to do what | felt was best for me, so while I'm\nnot denying ever having had a Jewish background, at the same time one has to\nrealize that since | was not raised in the Jewish faith, | can't find any emotional,\notherwise any bond with it and that's why I've chosen to, to, to worship in what seems\nthe right way for me, but that does not mean that | don't have some guilt feelings, that\nat times | say, \"Well, you know, | really ought to have tried to identified with Judaism\nEva Edmands 72\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 72\nand so I'm still pulled and as many people are. And I'll probably be til the day | die.\n| will always have mixed feelings about it.",
        "Q: Do you have Jewish friends, do you ever go to Temple?",
        "A: | have a few Jewish friends, there is no, there is no Temple here in Lawrence,\nthere's a Jewish community, but I've gone several times to services and you know,\nit's like totally foreign to me, cause they do Hebrew and | don't know Hebrew. And\nwhat has turned me off | think, is because they are terribly divided. They have the\nOrthodox, the Conservative and the Reformed and they don't get alone each other.\nOn their high holidays they have to keep it in separate rooms. And | don't think, you\nknow, to me this is a, this is a, this is a turn off.",
        "Q: | think that what you had said about what you tell your classmates, | mean not the,\nthe students about the three reasons, that kind of summarizes you right now, you\nknow, what you're doing and you had mentioned something about the deniers, when\nyou hear Holocaust deniers, that must make you just...",
        "A: Yeah. Oh yeah, | mean nothing, | mean they could insult me to my face, they\ncould call me names, but nothing upsets me more than if | hear. Fortunately | have\nnever met anyone in person, but | know that they're on the college campuses and\nnothing upsets me more than people who say, you know, that try to downplay it or\nsay it didn't happen. And so | feel that | have a duty to speak out. And you know\nthe other reason too, is, which | didn't mention, which | have started telling people\nnow, is that because | have survived and | don't know why my life was spared. You\nknow, one time a woman, that was the only semi-hostile comment | got, it was in\nEva Edmands 73\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 73\nPresbyterian church and this woman and then | said that you know, | feel so fortunate\nand . Well why do you think your life was spared and all these others\ndidn't. Sol, and she said it sort of a hostile way and | said, \"| don't know why my life\nwas spared, but | know one thing, because my life was spared, | have an obligation\nto tell other people what happened because maybe that was the reason, | don't\nknow.\" But that's what | feel very, very strongly right now. But you know, | cannot\nwatch, | cannot watch movies about the Holocaust. | have read Schindler's List, but\n| cannot watch the movie. | never watch anything on TV. And | remember that\nthere was an Anne Frank exhibit here at KU, shortly after we came and my husband\nand | went and it had all these pictures of Anne Frank and from her life and after five\nminutes | had to run out. You see, what I, what | went through doesn't affect me the\nway that what other people went through. | could not look at Anne Frank. | simply\ncould not do it. And that's why | can't read books or watch movies. It just, you\nknow, | just, it hurts too much.",

        "A: Right and as | said, | have managed to, to detach myself from my own life and\nsometimes it's really a strange feeling, | feel as though, you know when | speak | see\nall these images of the past, but it's all as though | were watching this on the screen\nand the person | was talking about wasn't really me, it was someone else, someone\nelse's life. That's how | have managed to detach myself from it.",

        "A: Not really.",

        "A: Yeah, yeah. Because you know, during the war, | mean, we always had hoped\nwe would come out of it and my father especially, he really Kept us going, he was the\neternal optimist. | mean every day, no matter how black things looked, he'd say,\n\u201cTomorrow will be better\" you know and we kept our courage up and our morale up\nand you know, there's always hope, but in this situation, when you're in a depression,\nEva Edmands 75\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 75\nthere is no hope. You know, you just face a wall and there's, there's no exit and so\nthat's a totally different situation.",
        "Q: When you talked about when you first came to this country, in New York and you'd\nsee soldiers, do you still get that same feeling when you see policemen?",

Things are too unstable there, but it\nwould have been something that | would have liked to do.",
        "Q: Anything else that you want to talk about?",
        "A: No I, | was just glad to have an opportunity to, to share this part of my life.",
        "Q: We were just talking about the political atmosphere in the country right now.",
        "A: Yes, well when we first came to this country, you know, | think things were so\ndifferent, we were just after World War 2 and everything was rebuilding, the economy\nwas good. People had hope. We, we, | think everybody felt that all things were\npossible and this, you know, after all | have to realize | grew up, so to speak, you\nknow, my late teens and early 20's is during the 50's and that is the period which is\nnow idealized almost in movies and so on, you know, where people could still have\nEva Edmands 76\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 76\ntheir own home and live better than their parents did, it was...[end of side 1 of tape\n3]...the political picture was just totally different because the economy was on the\nupswing and you know, take myself as just an example. As little education | had\nand little training in business, | was always able to get a job, which would never be\nthe case now, you know, | was never, never without a job and we had anything in\nthose days, you know, we had, what | consider leaders, people that were figures, you\nknow, Roosevelt. Roosevelt was so loved in France, | remember right after the war,\n| was in the school in Antsee(ph) and teacher came in, tears streaming down her\nface and said, \"Children | just have terrible news, President Roosevelt died.\" And\nhere we were in this little town in France and everybody burst out crying, that's how\nloved he was. Even Truman, you know, there, there, there are leaders that we felt\nhad basic integrity and which is, you know, today I'm becoming more apolitical, but |\nhave to say this, that wnen we came to New York in '48, we immediately, you know,\nwe got our first papers and then we had to wait five years to be American citizens\nand we really, you know, first opportunity, we became citizens and | remember we\nhad this mass ceremony in Yankee Stadium and it was just a wonderful experience,\nwe felt so proud to be Americans and the first time | was able to vote, | voted and |\nregistered democrat and I've been really a lifelong democrat. | worked on Adlai\nStevenson's campaign, but it was | couldn't vote then cause | wasn't citizen. But as\n| got involved early on, | was married to somebody who was really very liberal, hated\nthe war in Vietnam, hated direction our country was going and | think | absorbed\nsome of that. And today really, I'm, I'm awfully proud to be an American, | even\nEva Edmands 77\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 77\nwrote a letter to the editor which was published, saying that |, I'm distressed at the\nseeming decline in patriotism, it used to be on the Fourth of July everybody would\nhave a flag out. Now you know, you can go to entire neighborhoods, not ever see\na single flag and | always, you know, to me it's such a wonderful privilege to be able\nto put my flag out on a holiday. And another one is people, you know, don't bother\nto vote, there's a certain amount of apathy and for me, it is, after having lived under\na dictatorship for so long, it's a great privilege for me to be able to participate in the\ndemocratic process. And | also have a great debt of gratitude to the, to the heroic\nAmericans who died, fought and died so that people like me could be free. I'll never\nforget that, | have had the privilege of meeting some World War 2 veterans, some\nwho were in Normandy and | was able to thank them personally, you know, for what\nthey did for me. And |, I, I've always loved, unabashedly, you know, it's just | love\nAmerica, | love America with all my heart and soul because | felt that it gave us a\nchance to start our lives afresh and it welcomed us when no other country would\nreally do so. And, you know, | can never forget this and so when | do give talks in\nschools, | tell the kids how important their American citizenship is and why they\nshould always cherish it, protect it and defend it. Cause that's really, truly, you know\n| thought, this sounds corny nowadays, but this is really how | feel. You have no\nidea, it's still, you know, America has a lot of faults, but it's still, | think, the greatest\ncountry in the world and when you have lived, you know, under those terrible\ndictatorships, you really get to appreciate it, you Know and you have to, you know,\nthis is it, for better or for worse and we could, | don't think that any, any presidential\nEva Edmands 78\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 78\ncandidates today, running in '96 are especially inspirational and | think politics have\ntaken a very negative turn, very nasty turn and | do feel turn off, I'll probably still vote,\nbut I, at this time, | don't know who for, but I'm, I'm discouraged at the, at the direction\nthe country's going with the decline in the family structures, the rising crime, the, and\njust, the senselessness of some, you know, crimes that are committed, just for the\nsheer heck of it, it's, I'm not optimistic about the future of this country and at times |\nthink that I'm grateful that we didn't have children, because | would be extremely\nworried about their future, and not only economically, but drug scene and AIDS and\nall these things which, you know, we really didn't have to deal with when | was young.",

And that\nperiod between Normandy landing and that time that we were actually liberated was\na very difficult one because the German troops were being pushed back by the troops\nin Normandy and they went on a rampage and burning towns and taking hostages,\nso actually, that period, that interim period between the two liberations, exact, almost\nthe most dangerous one for us. We had originally found out about the Normandy\nlanding on the BBC, but then the, when we actually liberated, in August, we just found\nEva Edmands 2\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 2\nout somehow, | don't really exactly know how we found out, but we, the troops came,\nthe French troops and told us that we were free.",

But then at this point, | need, we needed help.\n| did not have any clothes, all the clothes that | had, | had outgrown. And somehow,\na social worker from the organization called OZSOE, which in French is called\nOrganization enfant and it's a Jewish agency to help children and\nthey got some clothes to me and they also arranged for me to attend a high school\nin a nearby town of Antsee(ph) and since it was too far for me to commute, they\narranged to board me with a Jewish family in town, so | stayed with the family and\nwent to the College Technique and Moderne and it would have\nbeen about sixth grade. Sixth grade? No, ninth grade, I'm sorry, ninth grade.",
        "A: Oh, the only formal schooling I've had was maybe two, two years of elementary in\nParis and maybe what would correspond to junior high, one year in southern France\nand then this would have been ninth grade and that was it and | didn't even finish,\nfinish that because then we had to go back to, to Paris, so really my education\nstopped, my formal education stopped at the ninth grade level.",

But! was very unhappy in school and\nin boarding with strangers because | had actually never been separated from my\nparents. And! was homesick and | was crying all the time and it just wasn't working\nout. So we finally, my father had gone ahead and finally found us one room, just\nvery, very primitive and we went back to Paris and when we left the priest, though, |\nhad kind of made a vow to myself that someday | wanted the world to know what he\nhad done forus. And that wish didn't get fulfilled until 1987, when I, | found out about\nthe and recommended him and finally got the designation of the\nthe nations and a medal which was posthumously awarded,\nbecause he died in 1959, but in that way | felt that he had gotten the recognition that\nhe deserved, but at the point, you know, in 1945, | didn't know, | just knew that |\nwanted people to know, but | didn't know anything about, didn't\nexist then. So we went back to Paris and we found that circumstances were really\nvery bad because even though the war was over, everything was devastated, there\nwas no coal to heat apartments with. There was very little food and so our\ncircumstances didn't appreciably improve when we went back to Paris. We were\nnot sure what to do at this point, but my parents gave me a choice, because they felt\nthat | was still so young, just barely 14 and 15 and | had my whole life in front of me\nEva Edmands 4\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 4\nand | should decide whether we should remain in France or whether we should go to\nthe United States. And | had this very romantic idea, the United States, by that time\n| had seen a couple of war movies and | just, you know, | had thought everything\nAmerican was just wonderful so | said, \"| want to go the United States.\" And so we\nhad to put our name on a list and they had a quota and we had to wait until our name\nreached the top the list and that took two years. So we actually didn't get to leave\nuntil 1948. In the meantime we were in Paris and | became ill because you know,\nlack of nourishment and you know, being run down from the war and | contracted\npleurisy and | was very ill for three months. There were no, of course no antibiotics\nin those days and | was, there was not much help available and\nit just took me forever to recover from that illness and | had to stay in bed for three\nmonths and then when it was over | found out | had lost the ability to walk, | was so\nweak my legs just wouldn't, wouldn't cooperate and my parents had to support me\nand | had to learn to walk all over again.",
        "A: Not great, | mean my mother had always been in poor health and my father had a\nheart condition, but they kind of managed, but | was the one who, you know, who\ncame down with this thing.",
        "A: Well they would have been in their early 50's at the time. And so, by some\nmiracle, | got over this very dangerous illness and then my father had found a job\nworking for some movie company because before the war he worked for MGM and\nEva Edmands 9)\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 5\nhe was writing subtitles, German subtitles for American movies. And somehow, |\ndon't know exactly who was involved, but he had gotten a contract for one year and\nwe were actually able to go to the French Riviera and live there for a year in a\nvilla. And well he did whatever it was that he was supposed to\ndo and that probably was one of the happiest years of my life, because we were living\nin a gorgeous place and my health improved and that was a very good time for me.\nAnd we had met another couple who had been in Auschwitz and they still had the\nnumbers tattoo and they had met there and they were just a few years older, so they\nwere friends that remained when we came to New York. And then after a year we\nwent back to Paris and went through another year there and | didn't do much of\nanything cause couldn't figure out quite, you Know, we were going to leave anyway,\nthere was no point in my doing anything else.",
        "A: Well, then | was 17, just a little over 17. And then finally we got word the word\nthat our name had reached the top of the list, the quota and we could go the United\nStates.",
        "A: Not much. We had very little news from the outside world because we were just\ndependent on the clandestine BBC news and we really didn't know very much, but\nyou know, we did find out after, afterward, | mean we had all newspapers and...\nEva Edmands 6\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 6",
        "A: No, | just, you know there are, there're gaps in my memory, you know, certain\nthings that | remember vividly and others | don't.

But as young as | was, all these years\nyou know and even in Vienna was a very little girl, | had an awareness of the\nexistence of God and | don't know how because nobody told me because my parents\nhad a tendency to kind of downplay it and say oh well, you know, it's all myth. And\n| knew there was a God and | kept searching for God, and...",
        "A: No, nothing, | didn't, you know, | mean here we were supposedly Jewish but my\nparents had been so assimilated into the dominant culture in Austria that they\nconsidered themselves Austrian and not really Jewish at all. Asa matter of fact they\nwere almost anti-Jewish because they had formally left the Jewish religion, you know,\nyou can do that and it was just because they were, you know, my father considered\nEva Edmands 7\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 7\nhimself to be an intellectual and they just did not believe in anything. And so | didn't\nknow anything about the religion of my ancestors. My grandparents weren't that\nobservant, although probably more than my parents were, but each generation was\nmore observant and that was the irony, that we were persecuted for a faith that we\nreally didn't believe in. But the Nazis didn't make such distinctions. | didn't know\nanything about Judaism, | didn't know anything about Christianity, | didn't know\nanything about anything. So, you know, we were told that our name had reached\nthe top of the quota and we had, we have to have a sponsor on this country.\nSomebody who, in America, somebody who would make sure that you didn't go on\nwelfare when you came here and so. And my uncle and aunt on, my mother's\nbrother and his wife had managed to escape the war and go to America and my uncle\nwas a doctor and he was doing quite well, they were settled and so they said they\nwould sponsor us and so we were able to leave and we had to go by boat and it took\nnine days to get over there and | remember that we were all deathly ill, | didn't eat\nanything for nine days, | was terribly seasick and we finally, finally landed in New\nYork on my, in 1948, May, 1948, | was just about 17 and a half at the time and my\nuncle and aunt were there at the port to meet us and my aunt's first words to us were,\n\"| didn't really want you to come.\" Because she was that kind of person, she very\nmuch, you know her, she did because her husband said, \"Well this my sister and her\nfamily, we have to.\" But we were always, as far as they were concerned, the poor\nrelations and she didn't have much respect for us and she didn't want us to come.\nSo this is how we were greeted after Holocaust and all we went through and not only\nEva Edmands 8\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 8\nthat but they had a lovely home in Queens, New York, but they didn't put us, they\ndidn't take us there, they took us to a shelter run by the Hius(ph), which was the\nHebrew Immigrant Society, downtown New York and so we spent our first night in\nthe new country in a shelter with hundreds of other people on cots. It was not a very\ngood first impression. And then, somehow, my father found us a place to live, just\na, you know, a room somewhere and that's how we started. But my aunt was so\nafraid that, you know, we'd wind up costing her money that she got my mother and\nme a job in a factory and it was a real sweatshop downtown. It was some friend of\nhers was owning a factory and, it was a bead factory and we were made to string\nbeads all day long, you know, that kind of thing. It was just horrible and it was very\nhot. It was May and it was very hot. So this, we were just kind of, is this America?\nWe had this glorified picture and it just didn't turn out at all the way we thought it\nwould be. And my mother and | didn't last very long in the factory. We were fired\nbecause we didn't work fast enough. And so we lasted only about two, three days\nand that was the end of that and then we found a place to live, it was, what in those\ndays they call a railroad apartment, on the very edge of Spanish Harlem, on 98th,\nEast 98th Street. And they were just, you know, one room going to another and it\nwas very primitive, we didn't have any furniture and we went, remember we went to\nGoodwill Industries and got, just a few pieced of furniture and my father had a really\nhard time getting work. You know, he was in his 50's and he spoke English\nsomewhat but you know, when you first come here and you're immigrant, nobody's\ngoing to hire you and he had to, for a first, | don't know how long, but he, he washed\nEva Edmands 9\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 9\ndishes, he did all those things, you know, just to get some money so we could survive.\nAnd the other thing was, you know, as far as | was concerned, | did not speak English.\nAnd English is now my third language because | had to learn French first, when we\ncame to France. And so | didn't speak a word of English and yet | knew that it was\nvery important for me to learn if | was ever going to get some work. And! wound up\nreally supporting the family, but | guess | have a, you know, it's easy for me to learn\nlanguages and | did learn pretty quickly. So it wasn't that big a problem for me to, to\nlearn a language. And then things got kind of bad because my mother became very\nill. She was only in her 50's and she had a stroke, which left her permanently\ndisabled. She had contracted TB during World War 1. And then from that she got\na rheumatic heart, so her heart was not very good and she was just a tiny little\nwoman, she was five feet and the most she ever weighed in her life was 90 pounds.\nAnd she had the stroke and so she was almost unable to, one side was paralyzed\nand she had trouble walking, so she was more or less homebound after that.",
        "A: Well she had a, we went to a doctor that we had known in Vienna, but they didn't\nhave things for people like, you know, as they do now . You\nknow, there was no talk of physical rehabilitation, any of those things, we didn't have\nthe money. | mean we would just, basically people. We never\ndid go on welfare but we had no money, we couldn't afford any of those things.",
        "A: Briefly and then she was just sent home and she managed as well as she could\nathome. And of course you know we had to, couldn't leave her, we had to take care\nof her, take turns. So that was, that was kind of really unfortunate. She was really\nyoung and she, she really never had a life after that.",
        "A: Oh yeah, | mean her mind was never affected, her speech was not affected, her\nmind, she died at 83 and her mind was clear as a bell, right to the end. And she was\nnever one to feel sorry for herself, she always, you know, managed to ___ herself\nand you know, keep herself neat. And she had interests, she read, she listened to\nthe radio and she had a lot of friends, so she was very remarkable that way. But her\nlife was just taken away from her basically, at that point. So really my father was still\nhaving a lot of problems getting work and it was up to me to support the family. And\nsoon as | learned English, then | started, you know, getting, looking at the classifieds\nin the paper and | don't know why, to this day | don't know why, but | answered an ad\nfor somebody who wanted a bookkeeper and I'd never done any bookkeeping and\nmath was my worst subject. But | went and it was a company called Home\nCraftsman in downtown New York. It was a magazine for hobbyists, people who\nlike to putter around, do jigsaws at home and do all those things. And for some\ninexplicable reason | was hired, but after a few days they realized that | was not a\nbookkeeper. And the boss said to me, | don't know what you did, you know, in your\nand of course | had fudged, it was a matter of survival. | didn't like having to do that\nbut it was a matter of survival. | had to pretend that | had experience because | had\nEva Edmands 11\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 11\nto start somewhere. And somehow, | don't know if he felt sorry for me or what but\nthey realized that, you know, | had not quite told the truth, but they kept me and they\nmade me into a mail clerk and so for five years | opened mail, because they had a\nmail order business and I, and | just separated the orders in neat piles and count the\nmoney and the checks at the end of the day.

        "A: Subway, take the subway?",
        "A: Well, slowly, you know, very slowly. But here, one thing is that we had, we\nthought that we had left anti-Semitism in the old country and when we came to New\nYork, the first thing that there was some friends that had come, you know, my father's\nfriend and the first thing they told us was to me, you know | was looking for work,\ndon't bother applying to any banks or any insurance companies or IBM because they\ndon't hire Jews.

So it was whatever | was getting, it\nEva Edmands 13\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 13\nmust have been 45 dollars, but it was a step up. And then, you know, | was just, |\nstill didn't have any formal education but | went to night school, to business school\nand | learned typing and shorthand and some business English and so that, you\nknow, gave me some type of foundation and then | had some minor jobs but the\nreally, you know, significant job that | eventually had, after a lot of clerical jobs was\nwith the magazine Outdoor Life.

And as young as | was, | must\nhave realized some, on some level, that prejudice is not something that, you know,\nyou're not born with it, it's something that is acquired, it is learned, it's a learned\nbehavior and it can be unlearned. But | saw stare where\nsuddenly friends turned into enemies, so that's why | think I'm so careful. Cause |\ndidn't want to be rejected again. It was very normal, | was a young girl and | had\ngreat hopes for my future and | wanted to put everything behind me and | wanted to\nbe so desperately...[end of side 1, tape 1]. | was very careful about what, who | told,\nbecause | did not want to face the rejection | had faced as_ achild in Vienna and a,\nbecause at that point | wanted to put the past behind me and | desperately just\nwanted to find some happiness.",
        "A: Yes, well, | was going to come to that, you know, where we were still in France\nand it was actually after the liberation, that a gentile friend of ours who had remained\nin Vienna, somehow got word that my father's mother had been deported, that they\nhad the Nazis, the Gestapo had come to our house in Vienna looking for my father\nand when they realized that we had already fled, as a reprisal | suppose, they went\nto his parents house in, on the outskirts of Vienna and took my grandmother away,\nshe was /6 years old and they took her to the camp of Theresienstadt where, we\nwere told, that she had died and when they came, my, my, when they came to take\nEva Edmands 16\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 16\nher, my grandfather, who was about the same age, had a stroke and he eventually\ndied. And | remember that this was a terrible thing for my father, the day we got the\nnews, the letter, he just walked out by himself into the woods and he stayed there for\nmany hours because he felt he had to be alone with his thoughts and it was just, it\nwas just a terrible, terrible experience. And then, you know, in the time that | was in\nNew York and | had managed, you know, to improve my living\nwith the various jobs | have and at one point | was able to go back there to, to Austria.\nAnd my aunt and cousin were still living in Vienna and they had somehow escaped\ndeportation because my aunt had been married, if only very briefly, to a gentile, whom\nshe divorced. But in those days, if you were just half, you know, married to a gentile\nand your child, my cousin, was two years older than I, was half Jewish, that protected\nyou. And they were made to do, you know, forced labor, in Vienna itself, you know,\ncleaning streets, doing that kind of thing, but they were not deported. And so | went,\n| went to see them and then she told me the circumstances of how my grandmother\nwas taken away and how she, she begged the Nazis not to take her because she\nsaid, you know, she had a bad heart and she was /6 years old and said please, she\nbegged and pleaded and of course they didn't pay any attention. And she told me\nhow my grandmother was screaming when they took her away and that was just, to\nme it was just like somebody stabbed me in the heart. And that picture stayed with\nme and so then, when | got back to New York, this was haunting me, | kept thinking\nabout my grandmother screaming and that's all, | was, became an obsession. And\nthen | got the feeling that | wasn't entitled to be happy. And | actually came up with,\nEva Edmands 17\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 17\nyou know what later has been identified by psychologists as survivors guilt. |\nactually felt guilty for having survived when my grandmother didn't. And | thought, |\nhave no right to be happy. And so any time a little bit of happiness came my way, |\nfelt bad about it, | said, \"| don't, | don't have any right to feel that.\" And this took a\nlong time and you know I, | didn't know that this was a psychological problem or this\nwas a syndrome, | mean this is how | felt and it took me years and years to get over\nthat. | finally did and nobody helped me with it, | just finally came to realization that\nit wasn't my fault. But! think that that was the start of it. And you know, it leaves,\nthe whole years leave psychological scars. | had an anxiety syndrome, you know,\nwhen we were already in New York and | would see, you know, policemen in the\nstreet, anything, a uniform, you Know, you get, you startle, you just freeze because\nyou're so used to seeing uniforms as belonging to the SR, the SS, as a menace.\nAnd it's a reaction that you can't help and also if we were at home and somebody\nunexpectedly rang a doorbell or knocked on a door, | would start shaking and my\nheart would pound like crazy, | just froze. Because you know, there's that knock on\nthe door and even though we knew we were now in America and we were safe, you\nretain that and it doesn't leave that quickly.",
        "A: Probably but maybe not, because | was lot more impressionable and a lot younger,\nyou know.",
        "A: No, | think | told them, they knew, you know, what was going on. And then,\nunfortunately, some bad things happened when we were still living in our first\ntenement, because of course we didn't have any air conditioning or fans and we had\nto leave the windows open at night in the summertime and one night | was in my, in\nmy bedroom and a man came in and | don't know, he crawled into, to the courtyard\nand | just woke up with a hand around my throat and a hand on my mouth. And |\nmanaged to wrench it free and scream and my parents came running. The man\nfled, but that was just another thing that shook me up, right after, you know, all this\nbusiness, so | steadily, you Know, went downhill after that.

        "A: Well, we had very little contact because they had treated us so badly and they\ndidn't help us in any way, | mean they knew we were hard up and we didn't have any\nfurniture and we didn't have clothes and we didn't have money and they never offered\nto do anything. They felt they did their job, they sponsored us, they got us here and\nthat was the end of it. And then they wind up treating my grandfather the same way.\nEva Edmands 20\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 20\nHe is my mother's father, he had managed to go to London, just at the outset of war\nand then came here and they wound up putting him in a nursing home, in one of the\nworst nursing homes in New York City, so, and he was a person who had done so\nmuch for them. And so they were just bad people, you know and we had very little,\nvery little contact with them. | went, | joined a, I've, you know | went into, | was\nmeeting some people but, you know, | had dates, but there wasn't anything, you\nknow, spectacular. And | wound up going to the Unitarian church, All Souls\nUnitarian Church, New York City. They had a young people's group and | just went\nthere to have a little more intellectual atmosphere and that's where | met my future\nhusband. They had, this was just before Thanksgiving, they had a dance and | met\nhim there. And that was in November of 1958. And his story was just so totally\ndifferent from mine, | mean, we, we had come really, literally from the ends of the\nworld, opposite ends of the world and met. It was very, very strange. He had, his\nname was William. Bill, we called him Bill and he had been raised in the Philippine\nIslands, he was actually born in San Francisco but he was raised in the Philippines\nbecause his father was an officer in the army there. He was a lieutenant colonel in\nthe Philippine Scouts, he was in charge of native troops there in the Philippines, you\nknow and this the time of MacArthur and so on, Eisenhower ;\nAnd so my husband had a sister who was a year older, his mother and father all lived\nin the Philippines and he lived there until Pearl Harbor, he was about 17 at the time.\nAnd then when, at Pearl Harbor the family was evacuated back to the States, mother\nhad a, was originally from Kansas, she was from Wichita and so my husband, my\nEva Edmands 21\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 21\nfuture husband and his sister and mother came back to the United States while his\nfather remained in the Philippines and then later the family got word that he had been\nmade prisoner of war of the Japanese and he wound up dying in Japanese prison of\nwar camp. So my husband had a, you know, traumatic experiences in his life, very,\nvery, at a very young age too. And then when they went back to Wichita he, he\njoined the service, he went in first in the Army Air Corps and then in the Marines, he\nkept enlisting, just so that, you know, he just wanted to do something for his country\nand he wanted to get away from this, you know, memory of this father, you know, he\ndidn't want to deal with it. And then somehow he wound up in, in New York City\nwhere, where we met. But his family were as WASP as you can get. His father\nhad traced an ancestor who had actually come over on the Mayflower. They were,\nyou know, Episcopalian, Republicans and very anti-Semitic, because of one incident\nin the camp, one Jewish officer they'd had some fight with and they decide all Jewish\npeople were bad, so he had come from this environment but then, he inherited some\nmoney from when his mother died in 50's, in Wichita and he was able to travel around\nthe world, literally around the world and he was able to broaden his mind and to meet\nall different cultures and, and then he just shed all those prejudices that he had when\nhe was younger so by the time he met me, you know, he didn't have any prejudice\nand he went to the Unitarian place because he thought, well he was very liberal, by\nthat time he'd become liberal in his politics and soon. This is the place to be. But\nyou know, | was afraid to tell him about my background because here was a man\nthat | really cared about and | was afraid again that if he'd found out | was Jewish he\nEva Edmands 22\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 22\nwould drop me like a hot potato, so | didn't say anything. And it wasn't, so that was\nNovember, we got engaged in May of '59.",
        "A: No and we got married on August eighth, in New York, in the Unitarian church and\njust a few people, friends and you know, my mother and father ,\nAnd it wasn't til we were married for several months that | finally told him.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And | finally told him and he said, and | figured, well now he's married\nme, he can't just divorce me for . And he said, \"I know. I've\nknown all along.\" Because there was one person there, it was a young man my age,\nyou know, we had grown up together in Vienna and he was the only one from the\nother side that | knew. And | had introduced Bill to him and at some point he told Bill\nabout my background. But Bill never said anything to me about it, he figured well\nwhen | was ready, | would say so. So then, when | thought was a big surprise, he\nsaid, \"| know. Tom told me.\"",
        "A: No, even before that. You know, when we were engaged, | introduced him to a\nfew friends that | had. So he wasn't at all surprised and that was the end of it, that\nwas the end of it. And so after that, you know, | started being much more open\nabout it, although his sister, who still lived in, she had moved to Liberal(ph) Kansas\nat that time and she was still not crazy about, you know, he didn't want to, he didn't\nwant to tell his sister he'd married a Jewish girl, and...\nEva Edmands 23\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 23",
        "A: Well his mom had died before he ever met me, so she was gone, yeah. So we\ngot married in '59 and...",
        "A: | was living New York and | was still working for Outdoor Life and he had just, he\nwas out of work at the moment and so supporting the two\n, two of us. And then we finally, he got some work and we finally\nwere able to, | moved into his apartment, he had an apartment in the Bronx, which,\na five floor walk-up which very, you know, very primitive.",
        "A: No, at this point, not. They had, my father was making sufficient money at the\ntime. He had gradually worked his way up and to the point where he wound up\ngoing into partnership with some guy and they have little advertising agencies,\nagency and they were doing publicity for movies, something like that. So, by no\nmeans, you know, doing very well, but enough to, to support themselves and so.\nAnd so my husband and | wouldn't, you know, | wouldn't have been able to support\nthem because we had just, we weren't making that much money between us, just\nenough for us to get a little place, so the first place, nicer place we had was again, it\nwas on 88th Street, 88th, well 84th Street, close to the East River in New York City.\nJust a one room apartment, that was it. And this went on for awhile and then we\ngot, restless. We were dissatisfied with our jobs, we felt they were dead end jobs.",
        "A: Well this would be now going in the 60's already and we just felt, you know, there\nwas no future and we wanted to go somewhere else. We never did like living ina\nbig city and so we thought we would try our luck elsewhere and we sent for different\nfolders and wound up going west and it turned out to be a disaster because there\nwas no work there.",
        "A: Where we, we, for some reason we decided to go to the state of Washington.\nSpokane and Seattle and there was no work there. So that was sort of a disastrous\nmove because we had given up our apartment in New York. But you know, we were\nstill fairly young. My husband was six years older than | was, so. But we were still\nresilient enough to cope with whatever came our way. We wound up, in this trek, in\nSan Francisco and couldn't find work there because they didn't want to hire\nsomebody just arrived, you know. And so finally, what we wind up doing is my\nhusband had gone to the University of Kansas, in Lawrence and he had, he was only\nshy a few credits to get a BA. and so he decided we'd go back to the University, get,\nto try to get readmitted and if he had his BA., he felt he would improve his chances\nof getting a better job and so that's what we did. That was 1962 and we came to\nLawrence and he enrolled at the University. | worked at the library, Watson Library\nat the University of Kansas and again we lived under very precarious circumstance.\nWe didn't have much money and we were living in a rooming house. Before one\nyear and he got his degree.",
        "A: That was in 1962. And then we went back to New York, we figured okay, now he\nhas a BA., maybe we can find something else and by some fluke, he found work in\na private school in New York city, that dealt with emotionally disturbed youngsters.",
        "A: Searing(ph) School. And he was teaching history and math there. And | was\nworking at the time, I'd gotten another job at Harold Orum(ph) corporation,\nincorporated, it was a public relations firm, but it was just something to tide us over\nbecause | was on the switchboard, you know, nothing really great. And this\nSearing(ph) School had a boarding school in upstate New York, in Westchester\nCounty, for boys. And then one day the principal called him, my husband in and\nsaid, \"Your wife is from, from Europe, isn't she?\" And he said, \"Yes.\" \"Well we\nneed somebody in our boarding school, we need some teachers in our boarding\nschool and in Soamers(ph) New York and we need a Latin teacher and your wife's\nfrom Europe, she knows Latin, doesn't she?\" And he said, \"Oh, sure.\" Never,\nnever learned Latin, nothing, cause with that, that one year that was in Unsee(ph),\nyou know, right after the war, in the ninth grade, | took English, not that it helped any,\nbut | was more interested in Latin, so he said, \"Oh, yeah.\" So he came home and\ntold me this and | said, \"Are you crazy?\" | said, \"| don't know Latin.\" He said, \"Oh,\nwell | brought you some books, you can learn.\" And he brought me some grammar\nbooks and | sat there night after night teaching myself the verbs and the conjugations\nand so. And | taught myself two years of Latin, just be myself. And | was hired, the\nwoman never asked to see any papers. We wound up in the boarding school for\nEva Edmands 26\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 26\nboys and | taught Latin. And then | wound up teaching, because it was more a\ntutorial school, so it was very one on one or at the most, two or three and then here\n| am, an Austrian, you know, English is my third language, but what do | teach?\nEnglish. Because | was good in grammar. Because you know, you have to have\nall these languages, so grammar was a cinch forme. And that's what they needed.\nAnd | had to get kids ready for the SATs and the grammar was an important thing\nand composition, | was good at that, | could always write. So that was fine. So |\ndid quite well and we did, we stayed there for two years.",
        "A: No, nothing.",
        "A: Right.",

        "A: Oh yeah, very much, | mean this was something that, you know, | didn't know |\nhad it in me to be a teacher, but | identified with the kids because | was pretty messed\nup myself psychologically and you know, it was something | could identify with and |\nEva Edmands 27\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 27\nguess it takes a lot of patience to do this. You know, | mean, if you make very, very\nslow progress. But enjoyed it, yes, it was...",
        "A: Yeah, 30's, my...",
        "A: No, we talked about it and then, you know, | was always very nervous and my\nhusband was nervous and we said, \"No, we too nervous to have kids.\" And you\nknow, | was already 29 when we got married and then of course, finances were so\ntight that we couldn't afford to have it, you Know, would have been a catastrophe.\nAnd then it got to be too late, you know, in your middle 30's it gets a little risky so we\nkind of, you Know, decided that was not, that was not for us.",

And we were given our quarters\nin the boarding school, then we were house parents and | enjoyed that, it was good\nexperience. And then, then somehow, you know there are some gaps, but\nsomehow we decided we, after two years, we'd had enough of this, you Know, scene\nand my husband decided to go back to Kansas to get a degree in education, cause\nhe...\nEva Edmands 28\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 28",
        "A: My parents are still living in New York. And so in 1965, we came back to\nLawrence, Kansas. My husband enrolled for his, gets his education degree, | went\nback to work at the library. And that's at the point where, you know, people always\nask me, \"Why did you come to Lawrence?\" You know, and | said, because we had\nties here, we liked Lawrence and | always, you know, I'd lived in a lot of great capitals\nof the world, Paris, Vienna, New York and yet | never was comfortable living in a big\ncity because | think from the days when | lived with, at the priest's house, you know,\nin the mountaintops and | got used to being close to nature and | always felt like a\nfish out of water in the big city and the noise, | became extra, extra sensitive to noise.\nEverything just bothered me, | couldn't sleep at night and | just wanted away, | just\nwanted a quiet life so Lawrence was perfect. Even though we didn't have any\nmoney and we lived in a rooming house, but we could walk everywhere and we read\na lot and you know, it was, it was pretty good. But then unfortunately we got the\nnews from New York that my father was dying of lung cancer, because he had been\na smoker all his life, from the time he was 15 and the only time he couldn't smoke\nwas during the war, but he started right after and he got lung cancer and he was\nhopeless and then we got word he was dying. So we had to go back to New York,\ntemporarily and get my mother, cause my mother was totally helpless by that time\nbecause of a stroke and we had to liquidate the apartment and then bring my mother\nback with us. She didn't have heat, he, he left nothing. He had never, there was\nhardly, a little bit of Social Security but otherwise, he didn't have his savings or\nanything so she was just basically left destitute. And so we took her back on the\nEva Edmands 29\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 29\nplane with us and here we were in two tiny rooms and, and you know, three people\nand a cat, we had to bring the cat, too. So we lived that way for awhile and then my\nhusband got his education degree and he got a job in New Mexico in a place called\nAlimagordo(ph) and teaching history in high school and it was a strange thing\nbecause he had been stationed there when he was in the army air corps, training on\na missile base there.

So | told my husband about it and he\nthought it sounded good, it was certainly worth taking a chance, so we left New\nMexico at the end of the school year and drove back to New York City. My husband\nwent to the Department of Welfare and got hired immediately as a social worker.\nAnd this, this was a very, very good move, because just shortly after that, the city of\nNew York froze all new hiring and he got in just under the wire and he wound up\nworking for the department for 19 years. First he worked in welfare centers and then\nhe worked as a case worker, he became a supervisor and worked with, in, in hotels,\nwelfare hotels where they put families who had been burned out and he saw to their,\ntheir need, whatever, you know, they required, he would get for them and he enjoyed\nthis type of work, it's like, we were very, very much alike in that respect, that he, he\nwas happy when he was with people, he was very outgoing, he liked the idea of\nhelping people, it appealed to his sense of altruism and so for him it was a good\nmove, the benefits were good and finally for the first time in our married lives, we\nwere able to live a little better than we had heretofore and as for me, I, of course my\nEva Edmands 32\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 32\nmother was still with us and we were all, at that point we were living in Greenwich\nVillage and we had two apartments side by side on Sullivan Street.",

        "A: No.",

And |! wound up staying there for 10 years, in\nthat school. Just, again, just doing the same thing, working with emotionally\ndisturbed kids. And we were able then to get, with two salaries coming in, steady\nwork coming in, we were able to get a better apartment and we moved to the Bronx,\nto a very nice building on the Grand Concourse, which was really a step. Even\nthough it wasn't Manhattan, we could not have afforded the rents for a decent\napartment in Manhattan and at the time, Bronx was still pretty nice and we had a two\nbedroom apartment, my mother had her own room and her own bathroom and it was,\nit was, it was a nice and we were comfortable there. So that's how things went on,\nmy husband working at the welfare department. Sometimes it was, it was\nEva Edmands 33\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 33\ndangerous work because he'd sometimes, he'd be called away at night. And | was,\n| was, | was worried about him a lot of times, that wno knows what might happen.\nAnd then in, so this went all through the, nothing really, you know, special happened.\nWe were able to make a couple trips together back to, to Austria and to France and\nto England.\nin southern France?",
        "A: Yes, well | wanted, it was very important for me to show my husband all the places\nwhere | had lived during the war and so we wound up really retracing all this. And |\nhad remained friends and in correspondence all these years with a man and his wife\nwho were the school teacher in the little one room school house in San Marten(ph)\non top of the mountaintop. And he was just 10 years older than | was. And\nmeanwhile they had moved to the town of Antsee(ph) and so we had been in\ncorrespondence and my husband and | looked them up and we stayed with them\nand were received very well. Of course the priest had died by then and we met the\nnew priest, who really didn't know that much about us. And we went to Vienna and\nmy cousin, my, my husband met my cousin and we went to Paris where | just had a\ncouple friends, no relatives and we went down to southern France and we went\nwhere we never did go to the village where we, we stayed during the war, we just, it\nwas, we had picked the wrong time of year and it was so death, really hot, that we\njust couldn't take the heat and so that's one place we didn't go to but we traced all\nthe other places | had lived and it was very important. | couldn't go back to the\nEva Edmands 34\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 34\nPhilippines to see where he had lived but at least he could see where | had lived, so\nthat, that kind of helped.",
        "A: Well it was, it was very emotional and you know when you, whenever we've been\nback to the mountaintop, things are not quite the same as | had remembered them.\nYou know, things change and, but you, it was an emotional meeting with all those\npeople and | had occasion to make more of these trips and each time, you know, the\nold feelings were there, they all came back.",
        "A: Yeah, she stayed at home. She was able to make one trip back, in the 70's, |\ndon't recall exactly what date, but | managed to get her back to Vienna because |\nknew my aunt was pretty elderly by that time and ill with emphysema and my mother\nwas of course not in good shape either and we thought this would probably the very\nlast time that these two women would, sisters-in-law would get to see each other.\nSo somehow | managed, my mother and | went and my husband stayed behind in\nNew York, you know I, by means of getting wheel chairs for her at airports, | got her\nthere and it was a very emotional reunion in Vienna with her sister-in-law and we\nwound up staying in a little resort, a mountain in Austria and had a really nice time\nand my aunt died just about maybe a year later, so they had just, you know, able to\nsee each other. Then in, in 1983, my mother died. She, her health had been\n, she'd been seeing a doctor regularly and she was taking\nmedication. She had high blood pressure, which had caused her, her stroke in the\nEva Edmands 35\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 35\nfirst place. She had been taking medication for heart blood\npressure, but after all, she was 82 and her health had deteriorated, she had\ncongestive heart failure, she was hospitalized briefly and then just, the eve before my\nbirthday, on October 26, 1983, | walked in her room, as | did every morning to say\ngoodbye to her before | went to work and | found her dead in her bed. And so she\nwas 82 in '83, so that was, that was a shock, because we had, we had always been\nrather close and you know, the whole circumstances of her death, which is pretty\ntraumatic. And so we had a little, you Know, memorial service, invited her friends\nand, and she was cremated and so my husband and | were just the only ones left.\nAnd then after that things started going downhill for me, | had always suffered from\nanxieties and sometimes they were so severe | had the feeling | was choking in the\nmiddle of the night and couldn't breathe and he'd have to rush me to the emergency\nand | was put on tranquilizers, but then | started getting more and more depressed\nand | realized that, really afterward | realized that I'd always had a tendency, it tend\nto run in our family on my mother's side, but that | had never really been totally happy\nno matter what the circumstances were but | thought that was normal because | had\nno, | had no gauge. But | know that, the first thing was, | was, | couldn't sleep at\nnight and the less | could sleep the worse it got and was really hard for me to function\nand work. Oh, | have to backtrack a little bit, | worked at the Searing(ph) School as\n| said, for 10 years and then something else very bad happened. The owner died\nand the school was sold and all the teachers, everybody was out the street. We had\nno place to go, we were jobless...\nEva Edmands 36\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 36",
        "A: This would have been in 1975. And so this was a shock, as | had liked the job\nand suddenly here we were, all out without jobs on the street and so at this point, |\ndecided | need to upgrade my, my office skills and | went and took a course in\nspeedwriting and passed that and then |, | saw a job that was advertised at\nSmithsonian Magazine, which was, they had their offices in New York City, they had\ntheir advertising, promotional services and circulation offices in New York City. The\nmain office, editorial was in Washington D.C., but they were putting out the\nSmithsonian Magazine in New York. So | applied, the job was for an executive\nsecretary and | got the job. And so | became secretary to the associate publisher\nand | was also in, they also put me in charge of customer service and | was\nconducting all the correspondence of the, client correspondence for Smithsonian\nMagazine and in a way it was probably the best job | ever had, the money was good,\nbenefits were good, it was semi, semi-civil service. But the atmosphere, the working\natmosphere was the best | had had because everybody was educated and it was a\nmix, you know and there were a lot of gay people there and Orientals and it was just,\nit was just a great, stimulating atmosphere. And| wound up working there from 1976\nto 1985. But...",
        "A: Yeah, right. But as | said, | started getting more and more depressed, | couldn't\nsleep and we went to see all kinds of doctors and started getting anti-depressants,\nwhich just didn't work. And! was going downhill. | wouldn't eat, my weight dropped\nEva Edmands 37\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 37\nand finally had to be hospitalized for depression and you know, I'd often thought, why\nwas it, it's so easy, would be very easy to say well the war did it. | think that probably\n| had it in my jeans because | said | had depression on, on, on my mother's side,\nsome relatives, but | think it probably needed a trigger and it probably, that the war,\nyou know, acted as a trigger and brought it all out. And | always had a tendency to\nreact to things many months after the event, you know. So it's hard to say and |\nknow that in my case it was a chemical imbalance, you know, hormonal imbalance,\nbut | was not responding to the, to the drugs and | was just doing worse.",
        "A: Well, like psychotherapy or something? | was seeing this guy who was supposed\nto be a psychiatrist but he never helped me that | could see it, you know, | mean he\njust didn't do anything, it just kept getting worse and worse and worse.",
        "A: Not really, he was not, he was not of the, the school, the analytical school of Freud\nwhere you go back to your past, he wasn't really interested in my past, he was just\ninterested in dealing with the present, you know. And he, he was just not very\neffective, | don't think. And...",
        "A: Well, yeah, but he had, unfortunately he had problems of his own, he had become\nan alcoholic and he was in his world and | think that probably also triggered it because\nas long as my mother was alive, | felt | had an ally there, | had a friend, somebody |\ncould talk to and when she died | felt all alone. He was in his alcoholic haze, he\nEva Edmands 38\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 38\nmanaged to function but then he would just drink throughout the weekend and things,\nyou know, our marriage started to go downhill. We had had a very close marriage\nand things just started disintegrating. And | reached a point, you know, together with\nthe depression where | felt that there was nothing more for me to live for. | had, we\ndidn't have many friends because then, the Bronx became sort of bad area. People\nwere afraid to visit us at night and we were isolated. We were just really isolated.\nThe only contact | had with the outside world was people at work and then you got\nhome and ,",
        "A: Yeah. And my boss was very understanding. She tried to get help for my\nhusband and she, she really, she was just absolutely wonderful, she, | must say, she\nwas just the most understanding boss | ever had. But things were just, | mean they\nwere just so, so bad, cause my husband couldn't deal with my illness because of his\nown addiction.",
        "A: He was working and at one point he was sent for, away, you know, to try to get\nalcohol rehabilitation and it didn't work. It didn't work. He was carrying some\nemotional baggage on his end because of his father having been killed and it, it came\nout in him too. So we were both living in our own miserable worlds. And so you\nknow, they reached a point where | couldn't work any more and they told me that,\nyou know, you just can't work any more and | had to leave my job because it was\nimpossible for me to concentrated because | couldn't sleep at night so | was of course\nEva Edmands 39\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 39\ntotally zonked out during the day. And | just had, and the job was getting more\ndemanding because of customer service, | would deal with angry people all day long\nand the pressure, | couldn't take pressure, that's one thing I've never been able to\ntake is pressure, any kind of pressure, since the war. So this didn't work out and my\nboss was very understanding, she managed to get me on disability and so then, that\nwas in 1985 and so then | remained alone at home, my husband went to work, | had\nlost a job | liked, | had no contact with anybody, was all alone on the 10th floor in an\napartment all day and, and |, and | was constantly thinking about doing away with\nmyself which | now realize is one of the classic symptoms of a major depression.\nAnd one day | actually did, I, | and | have to say, | wrestled with that because\nsomehow | felt, well if there was a God, he wouldn't be very happy and | felt it was\nlike throwing my life back at Him and that | would pay for it but | was and in such a\nstate that | just didn't think | could live the way | did. So one day while my husband\nwas work, | went in the bathtub and slit my wrists. And he found me there when he\ncame home and of course | had left the apartment, left and hid in the stairwell and\nthe police found me there and took me to the hospital and it was after that that | was\ntaken to the hospital and got shock treatments but they were not effective. They\nwere using and for a hospital was, Mount, no, Beth Israel Hospital in New York City\nand for a New York Hospital they used really antiquated methods.",
        "A: Oh this was, would have been in '85, mm-hm. They didn't treat me like a human\nbeing, they strapped me on a metal slab and they and they used no injections,\nnothing, | was aware what was going on, it was just horrible, it was like the snake pit.",
        "A: Yeah, that, supposedly that doctor that | was seeing, but it was not and, and the\nfunny thing, one recollection | have, because by that time | was getting paranoid too,\n| mean everybody was out to get me and | remember when | was going for these in\nthe hospital, one doctor came up to me and said to me, \"| hear that you're a holocaust\nsurvivor\" and | imagined that he said it as a, in an accusing way, you know and | kind\nof just pulled back and didn't say anything and | don't know why he said that, guess\nhe was trying to probably find out whether that had anything, get me to talk, but |\nclammed up and, because | was so paranoid, | thought, \"Oh this man is, you know,\nhe's going to kill me, he's like Hitler.\" So | didn't say anything. And so the shock\ntreatments didn't work, | was sent home.",
        "A: Yeah, oh golly yes, | had 10 and 10, you know. And | was in and out of the\nhospitals and then, so | came home and | was worse off than before.",
        "A: No, they would call but | wouldn't answer anybody. | would take the phone off the\nhook and the few friends that | had finally gave up because they couldn't get ahold of\nme, | did not want to talk to anybody. | was totally, totally paranoid. And then, you\nknow, here | was back at home, all by myself, totally isolate, my husband was getting\nEva Edmands 41\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 41\nworse, of course because that of course, must have been a terrible shock for him, |\nmean. Sohehad more excuse. And so | thought, well didn't work the first time, got\nto try again. Sol made another attempt. And this time | decided | would do it out\nof the house, so | had saved up sleeping pills, | had carefully saved them up til |\nthought | had enough to kill myself and | took a bottle of sherry, checked myself into\na hotel in downtown Manhattan, under an assumed name. Took the whole bottle of\npills, drank the bottle of sherry and was absolutely convinced that this had to do it.\nWell | woke up in Belleview Hospital in the emergency room again and | don't know,\nit's a miracle, not only that I'm alive, but my mind is intact. It's just absolutely a\nmiracle. And I'm, the only thing | remember is the doctors there were trying to tell\nme to say who | was, so they could contact somebody and | wouldn't tell them. And\nhe finally wormed it out of me, a phone number and he called my husband, he came\nover and, so | was hospitalized, | got aspiration pneumonia, you know, from this old\nstuff. And then of course | had, when | got home, | had to go back for shock\ntreatments again, they didn't work. So...",
        "A: Not well, | mean he just, he kind of fell apart, he really, he just totally fell apart\nand he, he was begging me, he said, \"Eva, | can't deal with this.\". And when |\nwouldn't eat, | mean he was so totally, he had no comprehension really, when |\nwouldn't eat, because | couldn't eat, he would go to balcony and threaten to jump,\nyou know, things like that. | mean he would just respond totally inappropriately\nbecause he didn't know, he didn't know how to deal with it. He had no\nEva Edmands 42\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 42\nand he had his own problem and it was just a terrible mess.\nAnd so finally we decided we couldn't stay in New York any more, that it was killing\nus. Because | wasn't making any money any more, | was just getting this little\ndisability check, but that didn't come for | think six months, you know, so. And so\nwe decided that our only salvation was to move out of New York and go back to\nLawrence, Kansas, where we felt safe. And my husband by that time, you know, he\nhad worked for the welfare for 19 years and he took early retirement, he was 62 at\nthe time, so he took early retirement. And we just, you know, got rid of our furniture\nand took what we could and packed up things and he had a book collection cause\nhe was, history, military history was his passion and we had 3,000 books, history\nbooks, so he all packed and sent out. And somehow, you know, | was just out of\nthe hospital, it was in June of '86 and we managed to, to come back, to go back to\nKansas and we found a place, an apartment for rent. But when | was here already,\nthen things went even farther, deteriorated with me, cause | didn't know anybody\nhere.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: No. And all the other stuff. And then the added pressure of living with an\nalcoholic, which is enough to test anybody's sanity, somebody who, whom you loved\nEva Edmands 43\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 43\nand who you watched destroy himself day after day afterday. It was just, there were\ntoo many pressures building up that | couldn't deal with. And so here we were in\nLawrence and | started getting worse, | was hospitalized again and then | was totally,\ntotally, | mean, | think another one of the symptoms is inability to make decisions. |\ncould not make the simplest decisions, what, what to wear or what to eat. | couldn't\ngo to a supermarket and pick out a single item, | mean it was just impossible, because\nyou couldn't concentrate. And you know, you wake up in the morning and you feel\nlike you have this huge, like a stone on your chest and you can't get up.",
        "A: No, by that time | wasn't taking any medication and | got to be, | mean my normal\nweight is like 145 or so, | was down to 80 pounds, cause | couldn't eat and | was so\nweak and | was, everybody was out to kill me.

        "A: Not at first, no. Until it got so bad and my husband felt | was going to die and |\nwas hospitalized and that didn't, they didn't do anything for me here in Lawrence. |\nmean they were not equipped and then finally on my husband's insistence, | was\ntransferred to the Kansas City Medical Center, KU- Med(ph) and finally, there, they\nstarted shock treatments again and this time they were state of the art, they gave you\nmuscle relaxant, they put you out and they worked. And | started coming around, it\nwas like a miracle. After 10, 10 shots or so, | was coming around and | had some\nEva Edmands 44\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 44\nvery good doctors, very understanding people. So | was coming out of depression\nand, but then, you know, my legs had swelled up terribly when | was in\nhospital, he had never caught it. And so when they thought |\ncould take it, they told me that | had a deep venous thrombosis, which is a blood clot\nin my leg and they were so afraid it was going to go to my lung, so | had to be, remain\nthe hospital although the depression was waning and | would have been able, but |\nwas immobilized for another three weeks and given blood clot dissolvers and, and\nthen, if that wasn't enough, then the doctor came to me one day and then kept taking\nblood and | thought, why are they taking so much blood and the doctor said | had a\nhemolytic anemia and | didn't know what that was, but two of my uncles on my\nmother's side had died of leukemia when they were in their 30's and | was absolutely\nsure that's what | had and they weren't telling me the truth. So | said, \"Is it\nleukemia?\" No, but they said it's a disease that causes the destruction of red blood\ncells, there was no, it was either acquired or inherited and there was no cure. So|\nthought, fine, you know, this is great. Got a blood clot, | got a fatal disease, this is\njust what | needed, you know. And so at this point | said, okay, is the first time | think\n| said, \"All right, | am not in control,\" and | talked to God, really and | said, \"I'm put\nmyself in your hands and do what you will, |, you know | mainly, | give up, it's your\nturn.\" And so they kept taking blood and then one day they came in they were\nshaking their heads, they said, we can't understand it, because your blood pictures\nis returning to normal. Your red cells are increasing and we don't know why. They\njust couldn't understand. And after a week | got well enough to leave and they\nEva Edmands 45\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 45\nwanted me to come back and have blood tests, you know, to make sure, because\nthey, they thought oh, this is a fluke and | came back a month later and there was no\nevidence of the disease, it was gone. And meanwhile, | had to have follow up for\nthe blood clot, you know, here in Lawrence, but that was, that was okay, and\neventually that was kind of all right and then they wanted me to have follow up\ntherapy, psycho-therapy for the depression and | went a couple times and | thought,\n\"| don't need this, I'm fine.\" You know?\n[end of side 1 of tape 2]",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: | didn't need the psychotherapy, | felt that | could deal with, with things, | had to\ndeal with things on my own and you know, this has been, we're now, in 1996 and this\nwas 1986, | have not taken any medication since, no tranquilizer, no anti-depressant,\n| have not had any psychotherapy and | have been fine for 10 years.

        "A: Well he was, he was going steadily downhill because | think retiring was really the\nworst thing that could have happened because now he had, he had no interest\nEva Edmands 46\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 46\noutside of his books. | encouraged him to volunteer, to maybe teach or, just on a\nvolunteer basis or get just his mind busy and he wouldn't do this, he just absolutely\nsunk into his alcoholic stupor and his health started deteriorating, his liver was going\nand then he was showing early signs of dementia. So it was a very, very difficult\ntime and | had to you know, cope with the whole thing, cause he was totally, | had to\ntake over all the finances, all the managing the household. He had been driving\nwhen we first came here and then | realized that he couldn't drive any more, it was\ntoo dangerous. But | didn't drive because we never had to have a car in New York\nCity and so at age 56, | had to take driving lessons and passed and got my license\nand started driving, which was, you know, it took a lot of courage for me to do this\nbecause | was really scared, but something strange happened when | left the Med\nCenter in 1986. First of all | decided, | don't Know what happened actually,\nsomething happened there, but all my priorities changed. All the things that had\nseemed so important to me before, you know, exterior things, appearance, whatever,\nwhat people thought of me, this didn't matter any more, it was a total reversal of\npriorities. All | thought was what really mattered now was to make my life count for\nsomething, cause | didn't know at that point, you know, how much time | had left, but\n| decided that | would conquer my inner demons my own way and | would be\nsuccessful at it. And so | wrote some rules for myself and | even pasted it on the\nmirror in my bedroom and it said, whatever these difficult tasks that | had to do, I'll\nsay, | can do it, | must do it, | will do it. And this helped me enormously when | had\nto take driving lessons, | was scared stiff and | had to pass the test, but | did that.\nEva Edmands 47\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 47\nThen, when we first, when | first came out of the hospital in '86 in Lawrence, |\nsuddenly found that | had acquired a fear of going, agoraphobia, fear of going outside\nbecause probably because | had been cooped up in hospitals for so long and | had\nthis absolute fear of going outside and, even you know, just in front of the house and\nif my husband was still driving at that time and we'd go to a\nsupermarket and | would cling to him and | would beg him not to leave me\nbecause | would be absolutely panic stricken, so this was this\nlingering thing, but it was a new thing which | never had before, which | had to\nconquer. So | decided that | wasn't going to be, you know, home bound and\nbecause of this and so | decided | would go down, because we lived on the third floor,\n| would go downstairs and | would set a goal, | would walk as far as the street and\nthen boy if | could do that, that was fine. Then the next day | set a goal that was a\nlittle farther. And so little by little, over a period of some weeks, | got to the point\nwhere | could walk to a supermarket, which was about a half a mile each way, to my\nhouse and when | could do that, then | Knew I'd gotten over my phobia and | would\nbe fine, but...",
        "A: | don't think so, because what, what happens with alcoholics, that they're totally\nself-centered. This is not criticism, you know, it's not a criticism, but he was so\nwrapped up in his world that he, he could not realize what was going on, he just\ncouldn't.\nEva Edmands 48\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 48",
        "A: Completely alone. And so that's why | knew that, who, he, to whom | always\nlooked to in the beginning, you know, in the early years he was my rock and my\nsecurity and | suddenly realized that | couldn't count on him for support for anything\nand that | was really on my own and | had to do everything on my own. And it was,\n| guess in a way, | had to take over the finance as | said and | guess in a way it was\na good thing because when he died, | was just totally, you know, at a lost, know what\nto do, | mean | had prepared myself psychologically for this event, cause the doctor\nhad told me at one point he had six months to live because his liver's going and\nexactly six months later he was dead. But well, you know, this was in 1993, he died,\nhe was 69 years old, but in the meantime, | decided that you know, | had to do\nsomething with my life, | wasn't just going to, | was never one that could just sit home\nand do nothing and so first | went and signed up to teach reading in an adult literacy\ncourse to people, adults who couldn't read and | did that for awhile and then | went\nto the public library and volunteered my services here in Lawrence, cause | told them\n| had worked at the University Library and so | would be volunteering there once a\nweek and then | thought | should put my language knowledge to some use and so |\nwent to the senior center and they didn't have any language classes and | told them\nthat | taught French and German and offered to teach classes and they were very\nglad to have somebody there who could do this. And so over the years | built up a,\nyou know, a membership and it's been going since, oh 1987, we have two classes\nthat meet regularly at the, French classes. | had German classes on and off, but\nthey didn't take off as well as the French classes, but all told | had about 15 people\nEva Edmands 49\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 49\nand they'll be University, retired University professors from all, people really from all\nwalks of life, but it's been, this has been my salvation, to, to have this and to get back\ninto teaching again, which is what | really liked best of all, of all the jobs I've had.",

        "A: Yeah, right. And then, we joined a local Unitarian fellowship here. And my\nhusband went for awhile, but not very long, he got tired of that and he wouldn't go\nand | went by myself. Made some friends there and slowly | started telling them\nabout my background again, you know, during the Holocaust and | was a little leery\nbecause, in the midwest, you know, | always, you had this feeling, misconception\nthat people are narrow minded and you know, you know, | was still afraid of rejection\nand discrimination but | found that people were so interested because in New York,\nHolocaust survivors are a dime a dozen, but here really, they don't have this access\nand | found out that they were very interested. And so this encouraged me and so\nat the fellowship on Sunday, they have programs on Sunday mornings, they have\noutside speakers and speakers from their own group and so they encouraged me to\ngive atalk. And this is the very first time that | talked publicly about what happened.\nEva Edmands 50\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 50\nAnd it was a great success and of course | was very nervous, I've never done, and\nthere's another thing that | had. | had of course, terrible stage fright all my life, even\njust on the, in very small groups, if | had to get up in a group of four people and make\na brief announcement, | was just, my knee turned to jelly and so | thought, oh, you\nknow, how can | face all these people? And then again, | put this thing to work and\n| said, | have to do it and I'm going to conquer this and | made up my mind | wasn't\ngoing to be afraid and then | wasn't. And from the first talk after that, | could go up\nthere and it wouldn't matter whether there were 500 people, 100, | was not scared\nany more. And some people heard me, local teachers and they ask me to speak to\ntheir students and so | built up a reputation, it was all word of mouth and at times |\nmyself went out and contacted different groups, primarily church groups and other\norganizations and little by little, you know, | acquired a reputation as a Holocaust\nspeaker and now I've been doing this since basically 1987 and to date I've kept a log\nbut | haven't really added it up but at last count, which was last year, I'd given over\n130 talks. And now | concentrate primarily on children from grades six to 12 and\nI'm, you know, a registered speaker with the, our local school system, | go to all the\nsecondary schools and | also get calls from vicinities outside of Lawrence, you know,\nin the state of Kansas. And | have, | have written the book that | had written during\nthe war, which is translated into English, | had given to every, copies to every\nsecondary school in Lawrence, so that the kids can access it in the public library as\nwell.

And | have found that, of course I've\ngotten other invitations from civic groups, church groups, just a variety of groups and\nI've always been amazed how great the desire for knowledge is, cause people really\nknow very little about what happened during that period. And how warmly | am\nreceived and | have hundreds and hundreds of letters from school children,\nhandwritten little notes to say how much they appreciated my talking and it's been\nmy raison d'\u00e9tre. \\It's been a catharsis for me and | have, you know, my speech\ntotally memorized, never refer to notes, | have visuals, | collect things out of the paper,\nanything having to do with the Holocaust and | keep adding to that. And so | feel\nthat, you know, because before | was ashamed to speak and now I'm, I'm kind of,\nyou know, making up for that and | always tell people when | give the talks that there\nare some reasons why | do this, because sometimes people say, you know, \"Why\ndo you do this?\" And why you put, they think it's really difficult for me and emotional\nand | said, \"Well, in the beginning it was, but after awhile you manage to get a certain\ndistance, emotional distance from your subject, because if | were emotionally, you\nknow, involved, every time | give a talk, | couldn't do it. And so I've had to learn to\ndisassociate myself as though it were really not my story, it's the only way I, | can do\nEva Edmands 52\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 52\nit. And | found out that's a coping mechanism that you learn instinctively during the\nwar is you kind of put away things that you don't want to deal with and that's a self-\npreservation thing. So | tell them there are three reasons why | give this talk, is, one\nis to keep alive the memory of the six million victims of Hitler, including my\ngrandparents. And two is to counter the, the revisionist lies of people who would\nsay that, you know, there was no Holocaust, oh it was exaggerated, it wasn't as bad\nand then third is so it wouldn't ever happen again and in the end | ask the kids, | said,\n\"| need your help in keeping the story alive, because we are called the last witnesses\nand my fear is that once, once we're gone, my generation, there won't be anyone left\nto keep the story alive, so I'm counting on you.\" And, and you know, I've gotten\nthese darling little letters, they said, \"Don't worry Mrs. Edmands, we won't ever forget\nyou, what you said,\" and you know, it was very, very, very gratifying and I've never\nencountered any hostility, I've talked to all different kinds of groups and they've\nalways been most friendly, there's never any hostile comments or anything like that.\nBut the one wonderful experience | had, well one good experience was in 1990, when\nFather Longiree(ph), the priest who had really hidden us and saved our lives had\nbeen awarded the Medal of the Just, from Yahdvashem(ph) and then organizers in\nhis hometown of Antsee(ph), which is the town closest to where his parish was,\ndecided to have a commemorative ceremony for him and from some other priests\nwho had helped people like us. And | was invited to the ceremonies, which were\nheld in 1990, in May 1990 and | stayed with my friend there and it was just a\nwonderful, wonderful ceremony, they had dignitaries from Yahdvashem(ph), from\nEva Edmands 53\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 53\nIsrael they had the Grand Rabbi of the region, they had priests and ministers and\npeople from the French government and some 600 invited guests and | was able to\nagain tell, talk, tell these people, in French this time, about the priest and what he\nhad done for us and then since he had died, his medal was awarded to him\nposthumously and it was given to me and | asked that the medal be put in a glass\ncase and put in his former church so that everybody would, would see it. So this\nwas one of the high points. And then | found out about other priests and their heroic\ndeeds and all the wonderful things they had done, so | came back with a whole\ncollection of stories of just, you know, sheer heroism and what | was pointing out is,\nthe heroes during World War 2 were not the generals, you know, and who won the\nwar, like MacArthur and so on, because that was their job. It was the little people,\nthe little people were the true heroes. And you, you met, you know, instances of\naltruism which you would never think possible. People risking their lives and their\nfamilies lives to help strangers. At the risk of their own lives, see. So that was, that\nwas just a unique experience. Then a year later, in 1991, | found out that there was\na new organization formed called, for people who had been hidden as children during\nWorld War 2. Now there already have been organizations for Holocaust survivors\nand they've had regular meetings but they're mostly for people who had been in the\ncamps. And we were a breed apart, and you know, and somebody finally\nrecognized that, because and we were sort of a little bit disparaged by the people\nwho'd been in camps, they say, \"Oh well, you know, you didn't go through what we\ndid.\" And that's true. But, on the other hand, we had a very unique problems as\nEva Edmands 54\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 54\nchildren being hidden, having to live day after day with the terror of being discovered,\nbeing separated from your loved ones. It was situation all by itself and it deserved\nsome recognition. So the Hidden Children was formed. They had the first\ninternational reunion of Hidden Children in New York City at the Marriott Hotel in\n1991, three day and they had workshops and sessions. And\nthey had originally expected some 500 people and 1600 showed up. From all,\nliterally all parts of . People came from Australia, Poland, you know,\nGermany, Great Britain, just all over the world. And in addition to the former hidden\nchildren, they also had rescuers who came and for some, some were very, very\nelderly, some were on crutches or in wheelchairs and for some it was their very first\nreunion with the, the children that they had rescued, so it was very emotional. And\n| had, you know, | wanted to go, but | had mixed feelings about it. | thought | knew\nall there was to know about the Holocaust, | said, oh well, you Know. And |, | was\nafraid in a way, stirring up all those memories, cause | said okay | talk about it, that's\nfine, but emotionally I'm detached, why stir up this? But in the end, | went and | was\nso glad | did. Because the minute | walked in there, | suddenly, you know, here, |\nwho had never been raised Jewish and now all these people, all Jewish and that was\nsuch a bond, there's just immediate bond. You felt that all these people, after just a\nfew hours, that they were your brothers and sisters. It was the most wonderful\nfeeling. A lot of them were my age, some were older. The age ranged from 50's to\nyou know, /O0's and 80's. First woman | met there was a woman, | mean she was a\nprototype of an Aryan, she was blonde hair, blue eyes, porcelain skin, Jewish, had\nEva Edmands 95\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 55\nbeen abandoned, not really abandoned, but left by her mother in Poland when she\nwas two years old. Her mother had dropped her on doorstep of a convent to save\nher and her mother didn't make it and she was raised by gentiles. And so she and\n| met and she was very, she still had a lot of bitterness towards, you know, the\nGermans and cause she had then somehow found, an uncle found her and she'd\nfound her true roots and she moved to Arizona, married a Jewish man, now she's\nvery active. But she was very, she had a lot of bitterness about, you know, German\npeople and, and really not knowing that much about her background cause she was\nso young. But you know, there were just million stories there and we had some very\ninspirational speakers, we had Elie Wiesel(ph) and Serge Klaufeld(ph), the famous\nFrench Nazi hunter there. And then we had workshops,\nworkshops and we had a list of things we could choose, for instance, the issue of\nguilt. People who felt guilty, as | did and then there were workshops for people who\ndidn't know who they were, whether they were Christian or Jewish because they had\nbeen raised by Christians and they had this kind of schizophrenic attitude to weather.\nSo | went to several of workshops and | was listening to the people talking and then\n| thought, this can't be, they're telling my story. And in so many instances the stories\nthey told were so similar to mine, they were rescued by a priest, you know\n. [mean it was almost like they'd taken pages out of my book, |\ncould not believe this, it was, it was spooky, you know, it was really spooky.",
        "A: Well, it was called the Hidden Children which was an organization that had been\nformed by former hidden children.",
        "A: No, nothing at all, no, it was just all independent.",
        "A: At the Holocaust Museum yes, uh-huh, but this was something that just came up\nand then since then they've had other reunions every two years on Israel and Los\nAngeles, but | haven't gone to any others. And then you know, they have workshops\nfor people say, who had been very young, rescued by Christians and raised as\nChristians and they were totally divided in their allegiance because they, they felt\nthey owed some allegiance to the Christians who rescued them and yet they felt they\nalso had an allegiance to their Jewish and they were, they had conflicts that they\ncouldn't resolve and those conflicts resolved it in psychological problems and, and |\ncould really identify with them because this is the way | felt, even though | was never\nraised Jewish, | felt more Christian than | felt Jewish, cause that's the only thing |\nknew. When yet! have guilt feelings because I'm not practicing the Jewish religion,\nbut | really, | only learned about the Jewish religion when | made contact with\nChristianity. It's the first time | ever read the old testament. So | don't have any\nemotional bond with Judaism.",
        "A: Yes, now | consider myself a, you know, a Protestant, | have joined a Lutheran\nchurch because of the fact that it is the closest to me to Old Testament, you know,\nEva Edmands of\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 57\nreligion, that, more so than others. Cause | had become somewhat of a Bible\nscholar and read a lot, you know, read the whole Old Testament and New Testament\nand | feel that in a way, Christianity has enabled me to find my Jewish roots and yet\n| cannot be Jewish. | cannot be Jewish because there are things that, you know,\njust are foreign to me.",
        "A: And | feel, you know, it's the same God, you know, it's, it's the same thing.",
        "A: Yeah, he didn't have any religion.",
        "A: Yeah. That was just, yeah, right. Which this is, | mean there is no, God doesn't\nknow how to have a religion.",
        "A: No, cause | was just, it was just talking about my life during, you know, the\nHolocaust and that's what | did.",
        "A: Since?\nEva Edmands 58\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 58",
        "A: Yeah, a little bit, you know, you could only do it very peripherally but there were\nothers who had come to this thing, same thing, who had been hospitalized and there\nwere some who were still in treatment, they had been in treatment for the last 20\nyears. And still going to psychiatrists and still trying to resolve these issues and | felt\na lot more fortunate, you know, that | had been able, cause some people, | think they\nuse it as a crutch and they don't move on. There were people who, who kept living\nin the past, that's, you know, that's the thing. And | determined that that didn't do\nany good. The past is past, now is now and you have to make your life count. You\ncan't, you know, what if and the same thing that, is business of bitterness, you know,\nprofound bitterness, | can never forgive the Nazis. Well | heard something very\ninteresting, at the, when we went to commemorative ceremony\npriest about this business of not being able to forgive and said, \"It is not up to the\nliving to forgive, only the dead can forgive and they can't, you know and they're dead.\"\nBut it's not up to us to either, you know, hate or forgive and | do not have any\nbitterness to anyone, because bitterness and hate, in this context is a self-destructive\nemotion. It really doesn't hurt anyone else, doesn't hurt the Nazis, it only hurts\nyourself, it can destroy you. And | realized that | couldn't let that destroy me and that\nlove was a much more powerful emotion than hate. You know, that love could\naccomplish things that hate couldn't and so therefore | have no bitterness in my heart\nEva Edmands 59\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 59\ntoward anyone. Not even to the people who killed my grandparents because it's, it's\nnot a concrete thing, you know.",
        "A: Just maybe on one level, but only on one very elementary level. He was proud\nof what | was doing, yes, he was always proud and he always encouraged me, but\non the other hand, he resented my being away from home so much. You know, he\nfelt | should be there with him all the time, night and day. And he came to resent,\nhe was really of two minds about it. In one way he was proud of me and the other\none he resented my success. Because he always regarded himself as a failure, you\nknow. He had this terrible inferiority complex. | don't know why, cause he was a\nbrilliant man. But that's part of the syndrome, so as | say, he was always of two\nminds about it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nEva Edmands 60\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 60",

        "A: It was, she was suffering a lot because she saw how, you know, my husband's\nalcoholism was destroying the marriage and destroying us. And so when she was\ngone, it's though as somebody just pulled the rug out from under me, | had lost every\nsupport that I've ever had.",
        "A: | moved into my house three years ago and it was the very first time that | had\never owned a house, we had always lived in apartments and it was a lifelong dream\nto own something that was really mine and to have a little garden and to grow stuff.\n| feel blessed in so many ways, cause |, | can truly say, | don't have, you know, that\nmuch money, | have a small pension to live on, but | can pay my mortgage and | can\npay my bills and | feel blessed because | have everything now that | have ever\nwanted. | have peace of mind and | don't really have any worries, | take care of\nmyself. My husband died in 1993 as | said and that was, that was a hard blow, but\nit wasn't unexpected because he had been so ill and he was just absolutely\ndetermined to kill himself. He had, he did have a death wish, which for reasons that,\nyou know, | will never know and he was just absolutely determined to do away with\nhimself. And, and | figure, well he finally got his wish and then, but | realized that life\nhad to go one and so going on with my life and buying the house was, was the first\nstep and | had already quite a circle of friends too, my volunteer work and to other\norganizations, so | just really kept doing what, what | was doing before, only now |\nEva Edmands 62\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 62\ndidn't feel guilty about it for being away from home. And during the school year as |\nsaid, | give talks and | still volunteer at the public library and otherwise | keep busy.\nThere's always housework to be done, garden work. | go, | take walks, | read a lot,\nI'm trying to learn more about history, especially during the pre-Nazi period to find out\nwhat happened, that what were the circumstances that led to the rise of Nazis in\nGermany. | have a lot of, lot of different interests, I've interest in linguistics and\nhistory, geology, so many different things, that I'll probably never be able in a lifetime\nto satisfy them all, but I'm fortunate that | have a nice library and it keeps me busy.\nAnd | try, you know, | take some trips. And, oh, one of the main things that | wanted\nto relate is | had a very unusual experience last year in October. | had, during the\nwar, after we left Paris, in 1940 or so, we wound up in a little village in southern\nFrance, called Kalvisol(ph) and there we stayed for a year when my father was in the\nlabor camp there and then, this was at the time, the free zone, the rest of France\nbeing occupied by Germany. And then when the Germans broke their pact with\nFrance to, to leave part of France free and occupied the southern zone, my father's\nlife was again in danger. And so due to a local partisan pastor, who was also the\ntown doctor, we were able to get away cause he had made a certificate saying my\nfather had a dangerous illness and couldn't be moved and he also arranged for my\nfamily to get fake ID's that enabled us, with fake names that enabled us to finally\nleave this village and the rest is recorded, you know, what followed after that is\nrecorded in the original video | made for the Holocaust Museum in Washington. But\nwe had never, none of us had ever gone back, except for my father, he made a trip\nEva Edmands 63\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 63\nback to that little village and among other places, somewhere in the, you know, | don't\nknow, 60's or so, I'm not sure, early 70's, but he went on his own. And he did see\nthis pastor and his wife and then this pastor died at age 90 in 1974. So |, for my\npart, had lost all contact with the village. And then a strange thing happened, | had\ngiven a copy of my book to the people in the town of Antsee(ph). The Archbishop\nwanted a copy because you know, it was about a priest and so on and then the\norganizers of the commemorative ceremony for the priest, with whom | had become\nvery good friends and we'd been corresponding and they had come and visit us here,\nSO we were really good friends by then. And they had lent my book to a friend of\ntheirs who was a priest and of course, he knew Father Longiree(ph), but then, when\nhe came to the chapter that dealt with the one year that we spent in southern France,\nthe name of the town, Kavisol(ph) rang a bell. He said, \"Oh, | know that town, | know\nsomebody who lives there.\" And you know, it was such a coincidence because of\nall the places in France it could have been, this particular one he knew. And it was\njust a tiny hamlet. And what happened, this man named Marcel Coulier(ph), was a\nyoung man during the war and he was hiding from, he didn't want, all young\nFrenchmen have to do forced labor in Germany and those who didn't want to do that\nwent underground. And this priest that helped this young man hide, and they had\nstayed in contact and then many, many years later, you know this man had moved\nto Paris, gotten married and then in his retirement he came back to the town of\nKalvisol(ph) and where he was living. And so this priest copied my chapter that dealt\nwith our lives in southern France and send it to his friends, hey look you know, this\nEva Edmands 64\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 64\ntalks about your town. And of course then, oh this is just extraordinary cause this\nfriend shared it with, he had made some very good friends in the village and he\nshared it with all them. And they were just so thrilled, because not only here's\nsomebody had written about their village, so long ago and they said everything was\naccurate, the names, everything was accurate in every detail. And of course they\ndidn't know that their pastor had done all this cause he wasn't one to, to brag about\nit. So they were terribly excited and they got in contact with me and we started\ncorrespondence and we talked on the phone and it just so happened that just at the\ntime when they discovered my existence in America, they were planning a ceremony\nfor the pastor because there was a new part of town that was street that needed a\nname and so they decided to name the street after this pastor, so everything was in\nplace and then they found out about me and what this pastor had done, which they\ndidn't even know, you know. They just named the street because he was a good\nman and as doctor he had brought many of them to life, so they want to honor him,\nbut they had no idea what he done during the war. So then of course they wanted\nme to come to the ceremony and there was just too short notice, you Know, amount.\n| said | can't, you know, | just can't pick up and go in April, in the middle of my busiest\ntime. So | said, well | tell you what, they said, \"Well could you write something and\nwe could read?\" So | said I'd do that. So | wrote a little soeech in French and\nmailed it to them and it was read at the ceremony and they had other dignitaries and\nof course they told the whole story. The newspaper picked it up and it was such a\nbig deal and they send me the articles and it was almost comical because it said,\nEva Edmands 65\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 65\n\"Jewish girl, former resident of Kavisol(ph),\" you know, \"found living in America.\" So\nyou know, | was like, ha, it was so funny, it was the biggest thing that ever happened\nto them, in that of the village, maybe. And so, and | was in\ncontact basically with this one man who had been the organizer of the family and\nthere were three families that were friends besides Marcel Coulier(ph) and his wife\nand then two other couples and they were, they had form an organization as the\nfriends of Dr. Bonet(ph), which is the name of this pastor priest. So all my\ncorrespondence was with them and we just became really good friends and then |\nstarted remembering names of people I'd gone to school with. And | wrote it to them\nand he said, \"Yeah that's true and they remember you.\" You know, things started\ncoming back. And then those darling people made a video tape, not only of the\nceremony, where | could just watch myself where they, while they read the speech\nI'd written, but they made a videotape of the town and sort of going around and\nsaying, this is school you went to and this is that abandoned house you lived in, it's\nalways just wonderful. But then of course they kept putting the pressure on me, they\nwanted to meet me and | had to promise them that | would come, you know and visit\nthem. And the following year | finally decided okay, it's now or nothing, you know.\nAnd | mean, they were so nice, you know, in letters so cordial, but | didn't know them.\nYou know, you go to a strange place, you don't know anybody, | felt a little bit, but |\nsaid, \"This is something | have to do.\". Because | felt that | had honored the priest\nbut there was still a page that had to be written in this book. It's closure, you know.\nSo then | turned out that my friends in Antsee(ph), knew this other couple, the\nEva Edmands 66\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 66\nCouliers(ph), they had become friends and so my friend in Antsee(ph) said, \"If you\ncome, come stay with us and then we will take you by car to this village.\" Cause\notherwise | said, you know, \"How am | going to get there, it's like in the middle of\nnowhere.\" And so that's what | wound up doing and originally | just was planning\nwhen | planned my trip, | planned, you know, two or three days because | said, \"I\ndon't Know these people.\" | didn't even know where | was going to stay. And then\nwhen | wrote my dates, they said, \"Oh, this will never do, this'll never do, you're going\nto have to stay with us for a week at least, cause we have all these plans.\" And you\nknow, you have, so | had to change all my flights, everything. Finally went to\nAntsee(ph) and then they drove me there. | come there and the three family met\nme and | mean, | mean, | felt like a rock star. | mean, it was just the most wonderful\nwelcome and it turned out that of the three couples, | Knew the husband and wife\ncause I'd gone to school with them. And then of course they called in the media,\nthey had a reporter from a local paper come and interview me and they had more\narticles in the paper and | mean, this was big deal and they took me around and the\nnext day to the village to show me all the places where I'd grown up and they were\nso thrilled, | mean they took more pleasure and maybe even more than | did, but it\nwas weird for me to see it, abandoned house where my family had lived. And you\nknow, it all looked really, basically, | mean it was upgraded, but you know, all these\nmemories keep coming back, but they were not bad memories, you know, even\nthough they were bad times, but it was just so good and to see the people that were\nso wonderful. And then they had, when | first and | stayed with one of the couples\nEva Edmands 67\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 67\nand my goodness, | had a whole, practically a whole house to myself, my own\nquarters, they were pretty well off, you Know it was wonderful. And then the first day\n| was there he pulled out a long list of things and complete, complete schedule,\nitinerary. Every day, every hour planned, what they were going to do with me. And\nthey had realized that when | lived there during the war, you know, | didn't have time,\n| mean there was no time to go sightseeing and there are a lot of beautiful things, so\nthey determined they're going to take me to the seashore, they're going to take me\nto the mountain, surrounding towns, you know, the whole bit. So in one week we\nwere constantly on the way, we got in the van in the morning, came home at night\nand just went all around the countryside and | saw all these things | just had heard\nabout and they were just, | mean of course, | was totally their guest, never pay a cent\nfor anything and | got charming gifts, | couldn't go to a gift shop they want to buy me\neverything in the store. It was, it was so wonderful and then they had organized two\nceremonies, one was at the little, little village where my father had been in the labor\ncamp. There was an official reception at City Hall, | was received by the mayor,\nspeeches, you know, the whole bit. And then there was another ceremonies, very\nsimilar one, in that little village itself. Again with the mayor, the City Council, the\nwhole bit, you know, the people coming up to me and | got a medal. And | gota\nplaque and flowers and oh! And | kept saying to them, | don't know why they're\ndoing all this, | didn't do anything to deserve this, all | did was live there for a year.\nAnd they said, \"Oh, but you don't understand.\" And then you know, sort of talking\nto people later, it came to me that it was more about them than it was about me. It\nEva Edmands 68\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 68\nmade them feel good. It showed them that there had been good people in their\ntown, because you see, anyone of them, they knew we were living there, anyone of\nthem could have denounced us and nobody talked, which is remarkable. Nobody\ntalked. And | guess that made them feel good and it made them\nand some of them were too young to even remember the war\nand they learned something and they actually met somebody, you know, who had\nlived among them and it was just a great experience for them and forme. So it was\njust probably the most, the best experience of my life.",
        "A: No, | don't because | have learned not to plan ahead to far. | just take each day\nas it comes and | don't really plan that far. | don't, | don't have any, any immediate\nplans. What | hope to do is that, | got a letter, last year, from the Austrian\ngovernment saying that after all these years they're recognizing that they did us alla\nbig, great wrong and they were going to make financial restitution just for the fact\nthat, you know, we were forced to leave a country and | was deprived an education\nand so on and so they finally, Germany has done this a long time ago, but Austria's\nbeen dragging their feet and there's supposed to be a lump sum given to people like\nme, not enormous you know, under 10,000. But first they're getting the very old\npeople, people in their 80's and their 70's, so my turn probably won't come for a year\nor two and | thought, well, if that were the case, I'd like to just kind of go back to\nEva Edmands 69\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 69\nAustria and just stay there for a month or two months, you know and just, instead of\ngoing back and forth and really, you know, just stay there, because | do love Austria,\nit's a beautiful country, but | couldn't do this unless | had this, so this is really the only\nplan | have.",

        "A: Yeah, well yes, you know, | have good friends and | don't really find that | don't\nreally, | mean if | didn't have, it's nice to have friends, but I'm perfectly comfortable\nwith myself, because | think, | think they say that people who don't like being alone,\nit's that they don't like themselves and this was true at some point in my life, but now\n| got to the point, | say, | like who | am, you know what, I've accepted that and I'm feel\ncomfortable with who lam. So! don't mind being alone because | have my music,\nEva Edmands 70\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 70\n| listen to records, | read books. I'm never, never lonely and I'm never bored. _| feel\nthat my life is rich enough as it is, | don't need a man if | want to go to the movie | can\npay myself, you know, pay my way. So it's, it's not, it's not something that's part of\nmy life any more.",
        "A: Lawrence is my home, yes, | feel, you know I've always wanted to live in a small\ntown and | would never, you know, I've gone back to New York City a number of\ntimes just for a visit, although now | don't have anybody left there and | thought, oh, |\nwould never want to live there any more, never. I'm glad I'm, I'm thankful. You\nknow I, well here's another thing. | feel now that everything that happens in life,\nhappens for a purpose, good or bad, that we may not always know what the purpose\nis, but it's not all for us to question. But nothing happens for no reason, so | can see\na trend to my entire life, that things had happened and there's always worked out for\nthe good at the end and if | hadn't had this depression, we may not have come to\nLawrence and then | would have wind up in New York City and maybe my husband\nwould have died in New York and | would have been even more alone because\nthere's nothing like being alone in a big city, you can be surrounded by millions of\npeople and still feel all alone and I've never had this feeling here. So and | would\nhave never had my house and | mean, everything just works out for the good in the\nend, if you just trust.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, you know, | found that a lot of people, a lot of people this was, the conference\nwas the very first time they ever talked about what happened. This gave them, you\nknow, the venue. A lot of people don't want to deal with it, they want to put it behind\nthem and | think people like me and say Jack Mandelbaum(ph) are, are the exception\nreally. | mean there are some Holocaust speakers in New York, but overall, a lot of\npeople | met, some friends of mine who lost their parents you know, in Auschwitz,\nthey just now starting to talk publicly about it, so.",
        "A: | don't have any dreams about the past, no nothing connected with the past.",
        "A: Yeah, the only thing | want to say is that | don't want people, especially people\nlistening to this interview to, to misunderstand, that | have in no way turned my back\non my Jewish heritage, | am proud of my Jewish heritage. | think it's a great, glorious\nheritage. But on the other hand, | had to do what | felt was best for me, so while I'm\nnot denying ever having had a Jewish background, at the same time one has to\nrealize that since | was not raised in the Jewish faith, | can't find any emotional,\notherwise any bond with it and that's why I've chosen to, to, to worship in what seems\nthe right way for me, but that does not mean that | don't have some guilt feelings, that\nat times | say, \"Well, you know, | really ought to have tried to identified with Judaism\nEva Edmands 72\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 72\nand so I'm still pulled and as many people are. And I'll probably be til the day | die.\n| will always have mixed feelings about it.",
        "A: | have a few Jewish friends, there is no, there is no Temple here in Lawrence,\nthere's a Jewish community, but I've gone several times to services and you know,\nit's like totally foreign to me, cause they do Hebrew and | don't know Hebrew. And\nwhat has turned me off | think, is because they are terribly divided. They have the\nOrthodox, the Conservative and the Reformed and they don't get alone each other.\nOn their high holidays they have to keep it in separate rooms. And | don't think, you\nknow, to me this is a, this is a, this is a turn off.",
        "A: Yeah. Oh yeah, | mean nothing, | mean they could insult me to my face, they\ncould call me names, but nothing upsets me more than if | hear. Fortunately | have\nnever met anyone in person, but | know that they're on the college campuses and\nnothing upsets me more than people who say, you know, that try to downplay it or\nsay it didn't happen. And so | feel that | have a duty to speak out. And you know\nthe other reason too, is, which | didn't mention, which | have started telling people\nnow, is that because | have survived and | don't know why my life was spared. You\nknow, one time a woman, that was the only semi-hostile comment | got, it was in\nEva Edmands 73\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 73\nPresbyterian church and this woman and then | said that you know, | feel so fortunate\nand . Well why do you think your life was spared and all these others\ndidn't. Sol, and she said it sort of a hostile way and | said, \"| don't know why my life\nwas spared, but | know one thing, because my life was spared, | have an obligation\nto tell other people what happened because maybe that was the reason, | don't\nknow.\" But that's what | feel very, very strongly right now. But you know, | cannot\nwatch, | cannot watch movies about the Holocaust. | have read Schindler's List, but\n| cannot watch the movie. | never watch anything on TV. And | remember that\nthere was an Anne Frank exhibit here at KU, shortly after we came and my husband\nand | went and it had all these pictures of Anne Frank and from her life and after five\nminutes | had to run out. You see, what I, what | went through doesn't affect me the\nway that what other people went through. | could not look at Anne Frank. | simply\ncould not do it. And that's why | can't read books or watch movies. It just, you\nknow, | just, it hurts too much.",
        "A: Even now.",
        "A: Even now. And now people say, \"Oh, this is a book about the Holocaust and this\nis amovie and you ought to see it.\". So | don't, no | don't want to see it. And | said,\nyou know, | don't need to see this. | mean, you need to see it, | don't need to see it.\nEva Edmands 74\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 74",
        "A: Right and as | said, | have managed to, to detach myself from my own life and\nsometimes it's really a strange feeling, | feel as though, you know when | speak | see\nall these images of the past, but it's all as though | were watching this on the screen\nand the person | was talking about wasn't really me, it was someone else, someone\nelse's life. That's how | have managed to detach myself from it.",
        "A: Not really.",
        "A: No, no, no. What was more difficult was during the depression as\nsaid, when | was depressed that was, yeah that was worse to\nbear than what | went through during the war, yeah. Not, not, not, not...",
        "A: Not now, no, no.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Because you know, during the war, | mean, we always had hoped\nwe would come out of it and my father especially, he really Kept us going, he was the\neternal optimist. | mean every day, no matter how black things looked, he'd say,\n\u201cTomorrow will be better\" you know and we kept our courage up and our morale up\nand you know, there's always hope, but in this situation, when you're in a depression,\nEva Edmands 75\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 75\nthere is no hope. You know, you just face a wall and there's, there's no exit and so\nthat's a totally different situation.",
        "A: | don't think so, no. But it lingered for a long, long time. You know, I'm still a little\nbit afraid of authority, you know. | mean, just a little leery.",
        "A: Well, | would like to do it for, just because of my interest in the Old Testament and\nthe New and that would be, | think it would be wonderful but | don't think it's in the\ncards cause it's very far away, it's very expensive and I'm a little scared too, | mean\n| have to admit it, you know, I'm a little scared. Things are too unstable there, but it\nwould have been something that | would have liked to do.",
        "A: No I, | was just glad to have an opportunity to, to share this part of my life.",
        "A: Yes, well when we first came to this country, you know, | think things were so\ndifferent, we were just after World War 2 and everything was rebuilding, the economy\nwas good. People had hope. We, we, | think everybody felt that all things were\npossible and this, you know, after all | have to realize | grew up, so to speak, you\nknow, my late teens and early 20's is during the 50's and that is the period which is\nnow idealized almost in movies and so on, you know, where people could still have\nEva Edmands 76\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 76\ntheir own home and live better than their parents did, it was...[end of side 1 of tape\n3]...the political picture was just totally different because the economy was on the\nupswing and you know, take myself as just an example. As little education | had\nand little training in business, | was always able to get a job, which would never be\nthe case now, you know, | was never, never without a job and we had anything in\nthose days, you know, we had, what | consider leaders, people that were figures, you\nknow, Roosevelt. Roosevelt was so loved in France, | remember right after the war,\n| was in the school in Antsee(ph) and teacher came in, tears streaming down her\nface and said, \"Children | just have terrible news, President Roosevelt died.\" And\nhere we were in this little town in France and everybody burst out crying, that's how\nloved he was. Even Truman, you know, there, there, there are leaders that we felt\nhad basic integrity and which is, you know, today I'm becoming more apolitical, but |\nhave to say this, that wnen we came to New York in '48, we immediately, you know,\nwe got our first papers and then we had to wait five years to be American citizens\nand we really, you know, first opportunity, we became citizens and | remember we\nhad this mass ceremony in Yankee Stadium and it was just a wonderful experience,\nwe felt so proud to be Americans and the first time | was able to vote, | voted and |\nregistered democrat and I've been really a lifelong democrat. | worked on Adlai\nStevenson's campaign, but it was | couldn't vote then cause | wasn't citizen. But as\n| got involved early on, | was married to somebody who was really very liberal, hated\nthe war in Vietnam, hated direction our country was going and | think | absorbed\nsome of that. And today really, I'm, I'm awfully proud to be an American, | even\nEva Edmands 77\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 77\nwrote a letter to the editor which was published, saying that |, I'm distressed at the\nseeming decline in patriotism, it used to be on the Fourth of July everybody would\nhave a flag out. Now you know, you can go to entire neighborhoods, not ever see\na single flag and | always, you know, to me it's such a wonderful privilege to be able\nto put my flag out on a holiday. And another one is people, you know, don't bother\nto vote, there's a certain amount of apathy and for me, it is, after having lived under\na dictatorship for so long, it's a great privilege for me to be able to participate in the\ndemocratic process. And | also have a great debt of gratitude to the, to the heroic\nAmericans who died, fought and died so that people like me could be free. I'll never\nforget that, | have had the privilege of meeting some World War 2 veterans, some\nwho were in Normandy and | was able to thank them personally, you know, for what\nthey did for me. And |, I, I've always loved, unabashedly, you know, it's just | love\nAmerica, | love America with all my heart and soul because | felt that it gave us a\nchance to start our lives afresh and it welcomed us when no other country would\nreally do so. And, you know, | can never forget this and so when | do give talks in\nschools, | tell the kids how important their American citizenship is and why they\nshould always cherish it, protect it and defend it. Cause that's really, truly, you know\n| thought, this sounds corny nowadays, but this is really how | feel. You have no\nidea, it's still, you know, America has a lot of faults, but it's still, | think, the greatest\ncountry in the world and when you have lived, you know, under those terrible\ndictatorships, you really get to appreciate it, you Know and you have to, you know,\nthis is it, for better or for worse and we could, | don't think that any, any presidential\nEva Edmands 78\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 78\ncandidates today, running in '96 are especially inspirational and | think politics have\ntaken a very negative turn, very nasty turn and | do feel turn off, I'll probably still vote,\nbut I, at this time, | don't know who for, but I'm, I'm discouraged at the, at the direction\nthe country's going with the decline in the family structures, the rising crime, the, and\njust, the senselessness of some, you know, crimes that are committed, just for the\nsheer heck of it, it's, I'm not optimistic about the future of this country and at times |\nthink that I'm grateful that we didn't have children, because | would be extremely\nworried about their future, and not only economically, but drug scene and AIDS and\nall these things which, you know, we really didn't have to deal with when | was young.\n"
