And they\nran across this concentration camp, Mauthausen, and they\nradioed in and said: We have come across something--we\ndon't know what it is. It is like a big jail and there's\npeople running all over. And I said: All right, you come\nback. So patrol returned to our headquarters. I reinforced\nthe patrol, you must remember the war was still on, and I\nwent back and I made a thorough inspection the best I could\nof Mauthausen, not knowing anything about a concentration\ncamp. And made the inspection and I returned to our\nheadquarters and I reported to our commanding general, Ge,\nDager, and told him what it was. Along with that. there was\ntwo Americans in the camp, and one in particular, Lt. Jack\nTaylor, who was a member of the OSS, he told me what\nMauthausen was. Then I told Gen. Dager what it was, and I\nwent to get some lunch. And the telephone rang. It was\nGen. Dager wanted to talk me. And he said: Dick, he said,\nI want you to return to Mauthausen and take supreme command\nof the camp. He said: You got a lousy job to do and he\nSaid, you cannot accept any orders from anybody, and _ he\nsaid, I have enough confidence in you to know that you will\ndo what is right,and therefore you will take command and",
        "Stay there and run it. And that's how it all about and\nthat's how I wound up in Mauthausen with the capture and the\noccupation of the camp.\nSandy: OK, now go back to when you first came in before you\nreported that---how people reacted to you.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/14/95 COL RICHARD SEIBEL\nPage 2\nCOL RICHARD SEIBEL:\nWell, actually and truly, it was unbelievable. I had never\nseen anything like this before in my life. I knew nothing\nof a concentration camp. We had heard of them, but that was\nthe extent of it, and to see all of these bodies piled up\nand these starving sick people in the camp, I just couldn't\nimagine it. We we didn't know what, actually and truly, we\ndidn't know what to do. And then, as I said, I returned,\nbut my initial shock when we found about 700 bodies lying\naround and just piled up like wood, if you will. I couldn't\nbelieve it, I just couldn't believe it. The -man's\ninhumanity to man actually existed between men and women and\nthe starving, sick, dead people in that camp--unbelievable.",
        "I, I, I stop and think about and I I don't know how I ever\nmanaged to stay through it. It was, in my opinion, it was\nthat awful.\nSandy: When you first came back, what did the people in the\ncamp do to you?\nCOL RICHARD SEIBEL:\nThey, they were so happy that we were there. Of course, we\nfelt that we had done a tremendous thing by capturing the\nplace and turning it to the Americans to solve a problem, if\nyou will. But it it, I can't describe to you exactly--we\nwere there and it was the second day. One of my people came\ninto the headquarters and said: You better come quick into\nthe main compound. He said: there's trouble. So I went\nout, and there are four people on the pavement with their\nthroats cut. Which I had never seen before in my life. And\nthe political unrest in the camp, I couldn't believe it\nbecause we were shocked actually and truly, that those\npeople would be fighting among themselves, and I think it\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/14/95 COL RICHARD SEIBEL\nPage 3",
        "was primarily in control of the camp. I just couldn't\nbelieve it. Because, ah, here they are liberated people,\nand fighting among themselves. I don't know what they were\nfighting about, of course, it's it's a political, let's put\nit that way, and so, then from that time on, we become very\nstrict. And we, we segregated camp, 18,000 people. We\nsegregated the camp by nationality, and got all of the\nvarious nations nations living together rather than.... The\nPoles hated the RusSians, and so they were locked up\nseparately. And the other nations, like the Yugoslavians ah\nanybody who was who was there, I learned this from from the\nah ah Yugoslavians. People who were the followers of King ?\n, King Peter and Mahailowisz, they were not accepted by the\npeople who followed Tito. And therefore, there was great\nunrest among those people. And it was all political, and we\nwere, we were really shocked. We thought, we here we are,\nthe great white father has liberated these people from a\nconcentration camp and here they are fighting among\nthemselves. So we took some very severe action and put a\nstop to it--real guick.\nSandy: What about the initial reaction of the people when\nyou first came in?\nCOL RICHARD SEIBEL:\nMixed emotions, really and truly. Some people, I know,\nwould come up they want to touch me. Other people ah, were\nnot particularly concerned. But after we were there a\nlittle while that all changed. And they they recognized us",
        "as their saviors, if you will.\nSandy: What about--wasn't there one prisoner who had taken\nover an office. Tell me about that.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/14/95 COL RICHARD SEIBEL\nPage 4\nCOL RICHARD SEIBEL:\nWell, that's sort of one of the highlights. Ah. We came\nback. When we came back to occupy the camp and take it\nover, we went into the headquarters and first of all I must\ntell you, I speak only English and not too good at that, and\nhere are all these different nationalities, and for me to\ncorrespond with them, no way. So there waS a prisoner\nthere, and he still lives in London. His name is Premislav\nDobios, and correspond him, and it fat, I'll be seeing him\nin Austria in May. He volunteered to be my interpreter, He\nspoke 6 languages. And so, he was with me, and this fellow\nwho was sitting behind the desk, and, I don't know, 3-4\nother people behind him. I said by an interpreter, I said:\nWhat's he doing there? And he asked me. WEII1, he was a\nRussian major who was prisoner in the camp, and they had",
        "taken over command of the camp. I said: Is that so? I\nsaid will you please inform him that this is in the American\nzone, and we are responsible for it and therefore we are in\ncommand of the camp. He wouldn't budge, he wouldn't move.\nI said: Please tell him again that we are responsible for\nthis camp and that I am personally in command. He wouldn't\nmove. So, I reached down and pulled out my 45 pistol and I\ncocked it and I shoved it right across the desk in his face.\nI said: Now you tell that s.o.b. to get out of here or I'm\ngoing to shoot him. Boy, they took off just like that and\nthat was one of the highlights of our occupation. But they\nwouldn't budge, they wouldn't move at all until I used some\nforce and that they understood.\nRoll 2\nSandy: Tell me how bitter the enmities were and how much\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/14/95 COL RICHARD SEIBEL\nPage 5\nthey wanted to bring their perpetrators to justice.\nCOL RICHARD SEIBEL:",
        "Well, that was one thing that we had to all of the people\ndown because under the stress and strain that they had been\nand all of a sudden they are free people,and it was very\ndifficult for them to accept that fact. And they had\ncertain rivalries, I'll say, in the camp, and we had to stop\nthat because so many people would be hurt. And ah, the the\nfeelings, we we were so surprised that they thought, we\nthought, that they would just bow down and scrape, you know,\nbecause here we had saved their lives and such. And so, we\nwere trying to be good guys. if you will, and then we had to\nstop being good guys and be quite severe, if that's\u2019 the\nproper word, to get them to understand that it was still a\nconcentration camp and we were going to run it to the very\nbest of our ability and take care of them and we expected\ncooperation from all of the people in the camp. And That's\nthat that was our feeling and how we got them in line to be\nnormal beings again.\nSandy: Tell me about how the Jews requested not be put with\ntheir countries.\nCOL RICHARD SEIBEL:\nAll right. Ah, of course, I came from a very small town in\nOhio. Population at that time was somewhere in the\nneighborhood of 9000 people, and we had two Jewish families.\nThey weren't Jewish , as far aS were concerned, they were\nmembers of the community and didn't recognize them as Jews.\nSo my education in that respect was nil. One day, one of\nthe boys came in and said: There iS a prisoner out here who",
        "wants to see you. And I said: All right, bring him in. And\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/14/95 COL RICHARD SEIBEL\nPage 6\nhe came in and I said: What do you want? And he said: I am\na Jew. And he said: I want to know why all the Jews in the\ncamp are not together. I said: That a good question. I\nsaid: What's your nationality? He said: I'm a Hungarian.\nHe spoke excellent English. I said of all the hell you\npeople have been through before, being, ah, wearing the Star\nof David on your on your clothing and being treated as Jews\nand to severe punishment and severe actions, ah, that\ndoesn't happen anymore. I said: You may be a Jew, but to\nme you are a Hungarian. I said: Judaism is your religion.\nHe said: Yes. He said: I know, but I think all the Jews\nShould be together. I said: Not according to my book. I\nSaid: You are a Hungarian, therefore, you will live with\nthe Hungarians. And so finally, he accepted it. And this\nis kind of odd. When he got ready to leave, he thanked me,\nand he said: Sir. He said: Could you give me a couple of\nHershey bars. And from that time on, the Jewish zionist\norganization from Switzerland, the chief of the zionist\norganization plus other members of the organization came to",
        "Mauthausen and really put the stem on me to put the Jews all\ntogether. And I wouldn't do it. I said: Absolutely not.\nI sid: I do not recognize these as Jews. I said: I\nrecognize them as a nationality, and that's the way it is\ngonna be, and nobody is gonna change. And so they accepted\nit, but not willingly, I'll put it that way. So from that\ntime on, we didn't have any problem, but I would not put\nJews together because they had been living under horrible\nconditions isolated as Jews, and I wasn't gonna stand for\nthat, cause I didn't believe in it.\nSandy: When you tried to bring order in that first month or\nso that you were there, what were your primary goals. and\nproblems?\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/14/95 COL RICHARD SEIBEL\nPage 7\nCOL RICHARD SEIBEL:\nWell, I would say, that the big problem we had was the\nSickness that we had among the prisoners, primarily typhus\nand Tuberculosis. I had doctors with me who kept me very\nwell posted and we deloused every prisoner in the camp with",
        "DDT powder, and those people, and we called in two clearing\nhospitals, big hospitals, army hospitals, and anybody who\nwas ill they were confined to a hospital. And so we\nhospitalized while we were there, we hospitalized 1000s. of\npeople and got them back on their feet and got and with\nproper medical treatment and such, got them to where they\nwere normal beings again. We had abut 1300 people die while\nwe were there because they were beyond help. And we were\ngiving them the very best medical attention that we could.\nEverybody was in the huge clearing hospital tents, and they\nwere all on cots. So that we tried to give them the best.\nThen the other thing that was so important was\u2019 food. And\nupon the advice of my doctor friends, told me what I could\nand couldn't do. so we started out giving them the same type\nof food they had been receiving, very watered potato soup.\nI mean it was just colored water, that's all. And so we did\nthat for, I don't know, for or three days, and then we\nthinned it up a bit and made it a little thicker and then we\nhad found a warehouse in Linz, Austria of dehydrated\nvegetables. And so we brought those in, so then we started\nadding some vegetables to the potato soup and that was\nlovely. They all liked it very much. And as it progressed,\nthey went on solid food--boiled potatoes and vegetables,\nthese dehydrated vegetable, but not in soup. And meat,\nhorse meat. See, in the German army, a mechanized division\nhas got umpteen horses and so in in the combat action,\nyou're driving all these horses ahead plus the ones-~ that",
        "Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/14/95 COL RICHARD SEIBEL\nPage 8\nwere there in Austria on the farms. So we butchered horses\nand we fed them meat, potatoes and vegetables. And\ncoffee,of course. And bread. Now bread, that was something\nthat presented a bit of a problem. We found a bakery and we\ngot some people who were prisoners in the camp to do the\nbaking. We didn't have any yeast, all we had was oats, and\nmixed oats mixed with water turned into bread--I think maybe\nI'm responsible for for the oatbread in the United States\ntoday. But, ah, we baked thousands and thousands of loaves\nand we had to put because when they are first baked and they\ncome out, they are just nothing but squishy water. if you\nwill. So we put them in the warehouse to dry out. And after\nthey got dry enough that we could slice, every prisoner got\none slice of bread. and then after a little while, they got\ntwo slices. And brad, eh, eh, prior to our occupation,\nbread was the most the precious article of food that they\nhad in the camp or ever had or ever will. And so then it\ngot to where we could give them a quarter loaf of bread.\nAh, and our stock of bread kept building and building, so\nfinally, I said: OK. Give everybody half a loaf of bread.\nOne day one of the prisoners came in and said: Colonel, We\ndon't want anymore bread. We've got enough. [laughs] Which",
        "was quite rare because bread, I say, you could get your head\nbashed in or your throat cut for a half a piece of bread.\nAnd they used to store in in their bunks and sleep on it.\nIf they hadn't eaten it.\nRoll 3\nSandy: Did you bring in German civilians to help you with\nthe running of the camp?\nCOL RICHARD SEIBEL:\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/14/95 COL RICHARD SEIBEL\nPage 9\nNo. We didn't bring any civilians in, but we did bring in\nabout 400 German Wehrmacht soldiers. We had, see, the SS,\nwhen they left, they disrupted everything. And they were\ngonna burn the place down, but the prisoners said: Please\ndon't. And they didn't do it. But they had disrupted all\nof the water supplies, the sewage, the electricity,\neverything, there wasn't anything in the camp. And so we\nfound out that there was a prisoner of war camp where\u2019 they\nhad a lot of prisoners who were capable of doing special",
        "things. And so we got 400 German POW and brought them in to\ndo all of the things that were necessary, which helped us\ntremendously. And they were they were conducted as soldiers\nand they were not treated as prisoners, and we got along\nvery well. And they brought life back into the camp.\nSandy: How do you think they felt?\nCOL RICHARD SEIBEL:\nWell, I remember the captain who was in put in command of\nthis detachment. His name was von Bruhl and he was an\nAustrian. Ah, he couldn't believe it. They they were\ncombat soldiers and they they they really and truly didn't\nbelieve that their own people and other people were being\ntreated like that. It was an experience for them the\u2019 same\nas for us.\nSandy: Tell me again about the sensory things like the\nsmell and the sound and the women's barracks.\nCOL RICHARD SEIBEL:\nWell, I'll tell you. To explain or describe the condition of\nthe women in that barracks --words fail me.

It 1s beyond\nimagination. The women ah, living under these horrible\nhorrible conditions, they were all gotten out of there, they\nwere all cleaned up, they were all deloused, and we just\nburned the buildings down. Got rid of them, they were no\ngood. It's a--I don't know, to see these women, why they\nwere treated as they were and under the horrible conditions\nthat they were living, I don't know, I I have no answer for\nthat except the brutality.

        "Sandy: Tell me about the kommandant of Mauthausen.\nCOL RICHARD SEIBEL:\nOh, Franz Ziereis was a colonel in the SS and he was in\ncommand of of Mauthausen and two small camps down the road\ncalled Gusen. In fact, Mauthausen was a control camp for 23\ncamps. And Ziereis was the boss man. And, of course, when\nwe captured the place, he was gone, and we were looking for\nSS. And you know how you could find SS? They all had a\ntatoo. Their blood type was tattooed here. And if they'd\ngot rid of their uniform and you didn't weren't sure, all\nyou had to do is tear open his sleeve and if there was a",
        "tattoo there or a scar, they were former SS. And so Ziereis\nleft the camp. And we got word that he was down in the\nvillage, living with his mistress. So we sent a patrol down\nto get him. And they went up to this house--they had been\ntold where it was--and he started to run away, and he was\nshot three times. He was shot once in the middle of the\nback, once in the side of his arm, and the other side of his\nbody. And they brought him back,and I was told they brought\nhim into the camp. They said: Do you want to see him? I\nsaid: I sure do. And so he was being interrogated and it\nlasted for quite a little while. And he was being kept\nalive on blood plasma and cigarettes. And in the\ninterrogation, he denied that he had ever hurt anyone. Or\ncaused anyone to be hurt, he was an innocent man. He did no\nharm at all. So we got through questioning him, and, of\ncourse, it is all being done by an interpreter,and then\nrelayed to me. And finally, he got tired and finished, no\nmore questions. And we didn't know--they said to me: What\nShall we do with him? Oh, I said: We are all through with\nthe interrogation. Ah.
