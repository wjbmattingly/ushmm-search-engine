        "A: The name of the village was Gaukonigshofen, about twel -- according to the history about\n1250 years old. It came very early, it -- it -- it finally, I think eight -- 17 or 1600 the names were\nchanged and it ended up in Gaukonigshofen. The hofen means a courtyard and the gau means a\ndistrict. And the konig means that it was dominated by the rulers from either the Catholic church,\nthe bishops, or the -- the other rulers in Munich. At that time Bavaria was independent from\nGermany.",

        "Q: And tell about your home, where you lived in -- in this little --",
        "A: I lived -- we lived in a home that was like an old fortress. It -- originally they ta -- they -- we\nhad a boy in -- in the village, the grandson of the Nazi mayor, he went to a university in Bamberg\nand he wrote a book about the village, a 700 page book and he researched everything. And he\nfound out the will -- th-the ha -- the ha -- house was surrounded by water and they used it to -- to\nbuy ha -- hides from the animals and they treated it to make leather out of the hides. And those\ntreatments developed a certain odor, and there was running water going through the streams\naround the house and the -- it had like a walk to go in that was supposed to be a bridge that they\ncaw -- pull up if they didn\u2019t want anybody. When we lived there, there was no running water in\nthe house. The walls were very thick, at least eight or 10 inches, and all stone, heavy stone. And\nfinally, in about 1928, the water was -- was put through the village and came into the house.\nCold water, of course.",

        "Q: And we\u2019re going to be referring throughout this interview to your memoir which you wrote,\nit\u2019s called, \u201cFrom Dachau to D-Day\u201d. So we\u2019re going to be pulling some stories from that.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: But I would li -- [interruption] Okay, here we\u2019re back. Tell me what it was like, the small\ntown life, when you were a young boy.",
        "A: It was a -- 1-1t -- it -- a simple life, it\u2019s a religious life. You -- you obeyed all the rules and\nregulations, and there was not much social life. You had relatives in the village and friends, but\notherwise it was no big problem.",
        "Q: And were -- how many Jewish families were in your village?",
        "A: W-Was about 50 Jewish families, I would say, probably 10 percent of the population was a --\nthey had their own synagogue and we had a Hebrew teacher who lived in a special house that\nwas built for the religious school. He had the apartment upstairs, and it was pretty much a normal\nlife. It was one of the larger congregations in that district that had Jews. There were three, four\nother congregations that were much smaller with the Jewish population.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So the Jews were in quite a minority at that -- in that part of Germany?",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- we were a minority, but we were respected. My father was part of the con -- of the -- of the\ncommunity, of the town council. He was a member and he had to go to the meetings and debate\nwhat was good and bad for the village.",
        "Q: When you were a young boy in the t -- like in the 20\u2019s and early 30\u2019s, did you feel different?\nDid you feel singled out in any way at that time because you were Jewish? Or did you feel\nassimilated?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t feel anything til about 1932 when the Nazis came slowly into power.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Up -- up to that time there was no -- the village was all Catholic and everybody knew\neverybody and there was no bad -- no bad feelings about anything.",
        "Q: And how did that change, gradually?",
        "A: That changed the minute that Hitler was elected as a ma -- as a pr -- chancellor. Then -- then\nsome people in the village decided they wanted to join him and they started creating problems.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What were some of the early problems that you experienced?",
        "A: Well, the -- the government start passing laws and within a few years ya -- Jews couldn\u2019t own\na business any more, they couldn\u2019t do anything, they weren\u2019t even allowed -- or anything to\nnormal life.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They were just tr-treated like criminals.",
        "Q: And you were in the public school?",
        "A: I was in the public school til I went to the high school in Wurzburg.",
        "Q: And -- and were you -- I\u2019m trying to think, do the math in my head and think what year were\nyou in elementary school. Were you --",
        "A: About 1933, I was kicked out with all the other Jewish boy. A friend of mine who went to\nschool with me, his father sent him to Switzerland to finish his education. He studied and became\na -- a physical education teacher. But h-his family owned some galleries in Holland, and so from\nSwitzerland he went to Holland and when the war started he was not allowed to emigrate any\nmore and he was deported with his parents to one of the c -- camps in the east and exterminated.",
        "Q: Mm. What was like for you in school? Were the other -- were your schoolmates making\ncomments to you, were the teachers making comments to you? Did it build up?",
        "A: Not really, but you could feel the tension.",
        "Q: How? Did you remember any stories about things that happened to you?",
        "A: Not really, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Not personal stories.",
        "Q: But -- but then you and all your siblings were kicked out of school at the same time?",
        "A: Right, we had to -- we had to -- to -- to go without an education, you can say.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Those -- those year -- the best years of your education were lost.",
        "Q: An-And how did you react to that? Were you afraid? Were you confused?",
        "A: Well, you couldn\u2019t do anything about it except emigrate, leave Germany. And that was not\neasy, because all -- most countries had no quota for you to come in and get a -- get a visa to\nsettle. So you had to have -- you have to try to make a-any arrangements you could. I was trying\nto get to Israel, and I was not successful. My brother went to Israel in 1936. He was the first one\nto leave from Germany. And otherwise it was really proble -- problematic, you couldn\u2019t ge -- go\nanyplace. Finally, about 1937, I wrote to a relative, a cousin who was living in Omaha, Nebraska\nand he was kind enough to help me.",
        "Q: But that took some time, yeah.",
        "A: He put a deposit in the bank in my name and sent the receipt to the American consulate, who\nwas at that time in Stuttgart and the consulate registered me and confirmed the receipt and I had\nto wait for my number to be called, which was about a year or two away. So the -- when came\nthe bru -- the Kristallnacht and the Nazis put me into Dachau after a few weeks and so. And\nwhile I was there my mother had a relative in London who vouched for me to stay there while I\nwas waiting for my visa to go to America. That was after I got out of Dachau. It took me two\nweeks to pack up and go to London. And I got there, I think, January 1939.",
        "Q: Right. Let me ask you, in those years between 1932 and 1936, when your brother left, your\nparents and other relatives, were they all very keen on having family members leave? Because so\nmany Jews did not leave, or didn\u2019t --",
        "A: Oh no, we were determined to leave. We-We wanted to leave and we tried everything under\nthe sun to get out. My oldest brother finally got a visa the day Kristallnacht appeared.",
        "Q: Tell me that story about taking him.",
        "A: He got a -- a -- a visa and he got an invitation to go to the American consulate in Stuttgart and\nwe drove there together on -- we still had our own car. I even had a driver\u2019s license. And we\nwent to th -- on the nember -- November ninth he was summoned to the American consulate. So\nwe went to Stuttgart, we checked into a hotel and he went there in the morning. And during the\nday was the destruction of the Kristallnacht. I stayed in a hotel and he was in a -- in the consulate\ngetting his -- he had his passport to get his visa entered. And he stayed there -- they kept him all\nday and he came out five o\u2019clock at night and we saw the destruction all around us, all the Jewish\nshops were destroyed. Where the Jews were living the windows were slashed, the bedding was\nthrown out through the windows. It was a mass hysteria. So at five o\u2019clock he came out and we\ndecided -- he decided, he had his passport, he didn\u2019t have his ticket for the boat. He had bought\nit, but he didn\u2019t bring it to Stuttgart. And he went to the railroad station and bought a ticket to go\nto Basel in Switzerland. We had a relative living in Basel. So he cleared out and I checked out\nfrom the hotel and started to drive home.",
        "Q: What time of day was it?",
        "A: Five o\u2019clock in the afternoon --",
        "Q: And with this --",
        "A: -- it was dark already, November. So I started to drive home and I got to -- to the -- a city\ncalled Wachmergenheim and I stopped, I saw -- I saw a public telephone and I called my father\nand he said, don\u2019t come home, they\u2019re coming here. In other words, he knew they were coming\nto start destroying whatever they wanted to destroy.",
        "Q: The Germans?",
        "A: The Germans, the Nazis, yeah. So I drove another 20 kilomed and I checked into a farmer I\nknew well for the night. I didn\u2019t want to go home and be part of that. So he le -- he let me stay wi\n-- in his home. I put the car inside the court, but in the morning, five o\u2019clock, he said he\u2019s got\nservants, he will feel better if I would leave because they might report him.",
        "Q: He wasn\u2019t Jewish? Was he Jewish?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. No, no, he was not Jewish. He was a good Christian. So I left and I went to another\nvillage with another farmer whom I knew had no servants. And he let me stay til seven o\u2019clock.\nThen I had no more choice but go home. And I drove home and I found myself facing the\nworld\u2019s worst. The house -- the door was broken down, every window was broken, the house\nwas completely demolished. And before I knew it, one of the officers came and says, you\u2019re the\nre -- you are arrested and he took me to the gendarme to sit in his office til they had re -- ru -- re -\n- a way to transport me to the prison.",
        "Q: And there was nobody there? Your parents and your siblings, they were gone?",
        "A: My father was gone, my mother was in the house. That was all.",
        "Q: What did she say to you?",
        "A: She co -- she -- she was all broken down. Finally a neighbor came in and help with the -- ope\n-- to lift up some [indecipherable] and fix the house door a little, so she could close it. It was -- it\nwas the most miserable thing you could have ever experienced.",
        "Q: Was she able to tell you what had happened?",
        "A: She wasn\u2019t in no mood to even talk about it, because you saw with your own eyes, it was\nnothing but destruction. Every closet had been turned over, everything broken, I -- un-\nunbelievable. They were acting like criminals. And we knew them.",
        "Q: You knew the people who\u2019d come there?",
        "A: Well, they came from the next town on a truck with wooden sticks to hit the people, and yeah,\nwe knew some of them. One -- one of them stood in front of my father and said, no-nothing can\nhappen to Mr. Kleeman. Because he was a -- he owned a -- a -- a [indecipherable] in a village\nthat my father used to go 1n once in awhile.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That\u2019s what he said, but it was alright for him to beat up the other Jews.",
        "Q: So you -- you were arrested and taken into the offices --",
        "A: I was taken into the same prison and put into the room with my father.",
        "Q: And you were 15 years old?",
        "A: No, I was 18.",
        "Q: 18 years old.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: No, 19.",
        "Q: -- where was that prison?",
        "A: That was in Ochsenfurt, was f-five kilometer away, the next small town, which was the -- the\nregional office, like a county here.",
        "Q: And who else was in that prison?",
        "A: All the Jews that they had arrested in the whole county, they had put them into that prison.",
        "Q: So when you got there, you knew most of the people in there?",
        "A: Yeah, you knew most of them, but you weren\u2019t able to talk to them. Each one was locked in\nthis room. They were allowed 15 minutes in the afternoon to walk around the courtyard, but you\ncouldn't talk to any one of them. They were s -- they were supervising.",
        "Q: And what did you know about what was going to happen to you?",
        "A: You knew nothing, because you had no -- you couldn\u2019t get a newspaper, you had no radio.\nYou knew nothing from day to day what would happen to you. Nobody knew anything. They\nfinally took some of the older people, like my father, World War I veteran, and let them go\nhome, discharged them. But not the younger ones.",
        "Q: What happened to the younger ones?",
        "A: Well, after two weeks or so, they took us to another prison in a large city and there we were\nprocessed, pictures taken and fingerprinted and prepare to be shipped to the concentration camp.\nWe didn't know what was going on, but that was the rumor.",
        "Q: At that time in Germany though, you knew that there were concentration camps?",
        "A: Yes, it was known. There was Dachau, there was Buchenwald. They were prepared for this.\nThey were built up and were waiting for the big shipments of Jews. They brought them in from\nAustria, they brought them in from -- from all of Bavaria. Was filled up. They didn\u2019t care how\ncrowded it was, it was just -- they were the bosses. Was electric wire fence all around the place\nso you had no chance to escape, and so on.",
        "Q: How -- how did you get to Dachau?",
        "A: On the bus. They put you on -- there was -- they had four or five buses running, everyone\nfilled with people and lots of policemen. Took about five to six hours to te -- to -- the ride to\nDachau. You didn\u2019t even know where you were going, you just suspected it.",
        "Q: And what -- what happened when they -- when you got there?",
        "A: In Dachau they started to cut your hair and process you, take your clothes away and give you\nthe minimum, like a pair of pajamas and a pair of fo -- shoes that didn\u2019t fit. You were stripped of\neverything you owned, and -- and thrown in with other prisoners. You didn\u2019t know what was\ngoing on. You were a -- practically, you didn\u2019t exist. You -- you -- if you got a bowl of soup for\nday -- for the day, you were lucky. And they made all the prisoners do the work for them. They\nonly made themselves as the -- as the guard, as the policemen. And they had vicious dogs and\neverything in the camp already. If you didn\u2019t behave they put the dog on you to tear you to\npieces. People died every day. In -- in the morning they loaded up the dead bodies and took them\nout someplace, we don\u2019t know where. But people were dying from heart attacks, from problems,\neverything. I-It was a shameful existence, you couldn't do anything about it.",
        "Q: Did you work? Were you forced to do work there?",
        "A: You -- no, there was no work. You had to stand around the parade ground and wait for them\nto tell you something. You -- you stood for six hours, eight hours, 10 hours a day in the cold\nweather. They didn\u2019t care.",
        "Q: Did you get sick?",
        "A: Not -- I didn\u2019t get sick there, no, but you had to s -- keep your health. You had to try the best\nto hope to get out sometime. My day came December 22\", I believe it was that they told me in\nthe evening that you go home tomorrow.",
        "Q: And how did they tell you that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember how that went, but in the morning you got your own clothes back and get\nready to leave and they took you to the railroad and the railroad took you to Munich, which was\na -- the nearest city, about 10 to 12 miles away. And in Munich the Jewish community had a\nroom in the railroad station where they took you in. You had no money to buy a ticket or\nanything, so they took care of you. Next morning I was home.",
        "Q: When you were -- when you were let out, did they tell you that you had to leave the country,\nor did they just say go out --",
        "A: Well they -- they told me I\u2019m le -- being left because I can get out of the country. I\u2019m being\nlet out because of that. They also tell you don\u2019t speak about what happened in Dachau, don\u2019t tell\nanybody. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all. You were glad to get out and keep your mouth shut for awhile.\nYou couldn\u2019t say anything til after you left Germany.",
        "Q: And your paperwork had come through then from -- from your relative in Omaha?",
        "A: Yeah, that paper was coming through, and the -- the consul from Stuttgart sent it to London\nwhen I was there and then I had to wait in London about 11 months before my number came up.\nYou were registered and then in December I was able to -- I get -- went to London in January\nand in December I was able to go to new y -- to -- to -- to -- on a boat to New York.",

        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re back. When you came back to your home, what did you find when you got\nhome?",
        "A: I found my mother and father there, the house was fixed up a little, the windows had been\nreplaced and everything -- anything you did was ready to go and leave as fast as you can. I\nbought a few things and I was anxious to get out.",
        "Q: And did -- did your parents think at that time that they were going to help you get out as fast\nas possible so that -- that you could help them, was that the plan?",
        "A: Well, they were hoping. I didn\u2019t know what -- how I -- how -- how I could help til I was able\nto get to London and meet some people and look for help.",
        "Q: But had -- did you all plan that together? Was that --",
        "A: Mentally -- well, no, I didn\u2019t discuss it, but I -- mentally I hoped that I could do something\nonce I get to London.",

        "Q: Mm. [interruption]. So you were the second one to leave then, in your family?",
        "A: No, I was the third one. The one to Israel first --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- and then the brother and then me.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s right, the -- one went in \u00b036.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right. And were you getting -- were you hearing from him? Was he writing?",
        "A: Who, the one in is -- yeah, he wrote, but I -- I -- when I came to London I wrote him a letter\nand I got a reply.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Those days there was no air mail, you know, it was boat. Three weeks for a letter. You don\u2019t -\n- you don\u2019t remember those days.",
        "Q: No, I don\u2019t. So how -- tell about your crossing -- your leaving Germany and getting to\nLondon, tell how you did that.",
        "A: I -- I bought a railroad ticket and the ticket went from Germany to London. That included a\nferry ride from Holland into England and then another train ride into London. That was a -- the\nway of travel, because that -- there was no airplanes, you could say. There were a few small\nplanes to deliver mail or something, but people couldn\u2019t travel yet by airplane.",
        "Q: And why did you go to London?",
        "A: Because the other cousin -- the cousin who helped me lived in London. And that was the\nnormal procedure to go to.",
        "Q: And what did your cousin do there?",
        "A: He had a business. He picked me up at the railroad station and put me into a boarding home.\nHe paid for -- for two weeks stay and that was my beginning of life in London.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And you got work there?",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t allowed to work because I was a -- like a guest, I was transient. You weren\u2019t y --\nofficially you weren't allowed to work because the British had [indecipherable] on us. Was --\nwas still sort of depression and they didn\u2019t want us refugees to take jobs away from them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So you couldn\u2019t, even if you found a job where to work, it wouldn\u2019t help you because the\nBritish were very loyal and they didn\u2019t want you to be in trouble.",
        "Q: And what did you do while you were there?",
        "A: I volunteered wer -- to work in the social cl -- like federation in the cl -- British make-up of\nthe so -- of the federation. And they let you volunteer and work for -- for nothing. They needed\nhelp because there was so much mail coming in to them and so much help needed, that it was\neasy to get that job.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That was my luck.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because once I was in that boarding house, there was a card game every Wednesday night\nand one of the players heard my name and he says, I want to talk to you. And I waited for the\ngame to be over and then we talked and he told me his name and where he came from, and his\nfather and my father were friends.",
        "Q: And what was his name?",
        "A: Ha -- Norbert Leaman, like the Leaman brothers. And they also came from a small village,\nthe same village where my father was born. And he was the Godsend for me. He offered to help\nme and this -- this was like a miracle. The relatives did not offer any help, but he did. Within t --\nweek or two he signed an affidavit for my parents and arranged for my brother and sister to get\nto London and they even came in to learn a profession to work. He was outstanding.",
        "Q: From what I know about how much trouble people had getting out of Germany, you were so\nlucky.",
        "A: I was very lucky. I was one of the few who was able to save a family. I was very lucky. I-It\u2019s\nhard to describe it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because there was -- they f -- they came about three months after I got there and they had to\nwait in London for the visa to come to America, but that was very, very lucky. Unheard of,\npractically. And luckily my brother in Israel had a little money so he was able to send some\nmoney to live on.",
        "Q: And what was it like when your parents came? Do you remember meeting them?",
        "A: Yeah, I met -- I went to the railroad station, and picked them up and I had rented a little\napartment where to live in the north section of London near the boarding house where I was first\nput. And w-we managed. My brother and sister got a little job. He were -- he learned as a\ncarpenter and my sister did some homework, housecleaning and we managed.",
        "Q: So your brother and sister came with your parents?",
        "A: No, they came a week or two later.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Their papers weren\u2019t ready when my parents came.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But they came within a week or two.",
        "Q: And your sister was the youngest one, how old was she at that time?",
        "A: She was that -- she was born \u201923 and that was 1939, so 16.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Rough -- rough life.",
        "Q: Yeah. So you\u2019re all there together in north London?",
        "A: Yeah, we lived in a small apartment.",
        "Q: And what were your days like, what did you do?",
        "A: Oh, I went to work as a volunteer in the -- in the office, I went every day. I didn\u2019t want to give\nup my job and I helped quite a few other people to get out from Germany. I f -- I --",
        "Q: Can you describe the -- did that agency have a name, that you worked with?",
        "A: Yeah, Bloomsbury House. It was known as the only agency that controlled th-the -- the\nGerman Jews to come to England. It was called Bloomsbury House. But they -- they couldn\u2019t\nemploy me, they couldn\u2019t pay me, let\u2019s put it this way, they couldn\u2019t -- they weren\u2019t allowed to --\nto hire anybody who came temporarily, which I could understand. And they -- they had one big\nbanker from London who came every afternoon and signed so many papers that were processed\nduring the day and those papers were sent to the home office and within 10 days or so, the people\nwhose name was on the papers would get the permit to come to England. That was Sir Otto\nSchiff, a -- a famous banker in London.",
        "Q: And wa -- why did his signature mean so much?",
        "A: He was appointed by the British to handle the immigration of the refugees. And he had to sign\napplications every day. And he had a very good secretary, Ruth Fellner. She came from Vienna\nand she prepared all the papers for him, and he came every afternoon, four or five o\u2019clock to sign\nthe papers. Without his signature the papers wouldn\u2019t have done anything.",
        "Q: And how many people do you think were getting out, every day or every week because of that\nwork?",
        "A: Ma-Maybe between 60 and a hundred.",
        "Q: A week?",
        "A: A -- a day.",
        "Q: A day?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Maybe. Well, they -- they -- they spread all over London or Manchester or\nwhatever. Wherever they had people they knew. It was a -- a -- a process, a daily process and th-\nthere was lawyers involved and I go -- I got -- I handled a few cases, I had to hire a lawyer to put\nthe applications in. And one of the lawyers liked me. He also was a refugee, but he must have\nbeen in London five years already. He was well-mannered, well-dressed and he says to me, I -- I\nneed you. And he offered to help me. He says, I'll give you some money every week, but you\nhave to help me with my cases. So I watched his cases as they come in and I reported to him\nonce a week and told him ho-how -- how they\u2019re standing, when he can expect the recess. And\nhe was very good to me. He gave me a few dollars every week and bought me a lunch. That was\nnot legal, but he felt he needed me and I did help him. I helped quite a few other people to come\nto London.",
        "Q: And something that I didn\u2019t ask you about, you spoke English because you had learned it in\nschool, is that right?",
        "A: Yeah, I had three years English in school, I was able to -- to con -- to converse and listen and\nhave conversation, yes.",
        "Q: Mm, that was fortunate.",
        "A: That was very fortunate. That\u2019s why I was able to do things.",
        "Q: And your parents, what did your parents do all day?",
        "A: Na -- they couldn\u2019t do anything. The -- cook three meals, two meals and walk around the\nneighborhood and do a little shopping. That\u2019s all. They couldn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t know English,\nthey -- they didn't have money to do anything. You -- you -- you were marking time, if you know\nwhat that means.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You -- from day to day you were hoping that some -- soon you will be able to leave and get\naway.",
        "Q: Now, when you came out and when they came out, what did you bring with you?",
        "A: Few clothes, fe -- necessary clothes. Wasn\u2019t important. You were ready to go without\nanything worthwhile.",
        "Q: And did you -- were you able to bring money?",
        "A: No, no. T-Two dollars, three dollars. You weren\u2019t able to bring any money, anything of value.\nTh-They searched you at the railroad station before you boarded your train. You couldn\u2019t take\nanything. You weren\u2019t allowed to leave any money -- the opposite. I was forced to pay 2,000\nmarks -- money to the Germans for -- for letting me go. There -- you couldn\u2019t take anything. My\nfather had money, couldn\u2019t bring any dollar. You had to give it away to his family and so on\nbefore leaving Germany. Was -- was impossible to bring any money. They didn\u2019t care. They --\nthey were just ready to steal everything so they didn\u2019t want you to take anything.",
        "Q: Were there a lot of -- were there a lot of Jewish refugees in that part of London where you\nlived?",
        "A: Yes, there were -- there were quite a few Jewish refugees, yes. Who is that?\nA2: Your daughter.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: Want me to stop for a second?\nA2: Hello.",
        "Q: Hi. [tape break]. Okay, we\u2019re going to roll again. I asked you about other Jews that had come\nto London, was there a big community of people there?",
        "A: Well, they were spread all over London. They -- there was one section northwest, Hampstead\nthey call it, there were quite a few up there, and they were living all over, wherever they could\nfind cheap accommodations. Couldn\u2019t live in the west end.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And everybody that came was hoping to have a -- relatives in America already to send them a\nfew dollars to exist, cause nobody was allowed to work.",
        "Q: And when you got there, did you immediately make plans to go to America?",
        "A: Ye -- there\u2019s nothing you could do. You -- you -- you had to sit and wait and do -- sometime\nin November, or -- yeah, in November, I got there in January -- November I got a letter from the\nAmerican consulate in London that I should come and get my visa. So they -- they s -- that was\nthe -- the consulate, not the embassy. But the consulate office was in the -- in the same building\nwhere the embassy was. So I went there on a Saturday morning and I got my visa. And when I\nhad my visa I had to make arrangements for a boat to take me to New York. And you -- you go\nto the -- to the sh-ship -- C-Cunard line and they tell you this boat is leaving in a week or so and\nyou can have it, but you have to buy a ticket. And the ticket in those days was, I believe, 30\npounds and I didn't have the money. And I didn\u2019t want to take the last dollar from my parents, so\nI went around people I knew already, English people and I ended up collect -- collecting 30\npounds to buy my ticket. And wh-what I had was the -- the lowest room in the boat, on the --\nway on the bottom, but it didn\u2019t matter. It was wartime already, war started September first and I\nleft the end of November. And we weren\u2019t allowed on deck, the boat was all blacked out and\neverything, but we managed. We didn\u2019t know if a submarine would hit us or not, because the\nsubmarines were out in the ocean already.",
        "Q: When you got your visa, what had you had -- what did you have to go through to get a visa?",
        "A: Nothing. Nothing, just present my passport. They had the -- the papers that the man deposited\n5,000 dollars in my name. He didn\u2019t ask any more questions.",
        "Q: That was the relative from Omaha?",
        "A: Yeah, he -- I never was able to go and visit him and he never asked me to come. But I\u2019m sure\nafter he found I da -- was in America, he took his money back, probably. I didn\u2019t get it.",
        "Q: So he had it on deposit in your name, that\u2019s -- that was the procedure?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: He would put that money on deposit?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That -- that was -- instead of an affidavit he -- he put the 5,000 in my name and -- and the\nconsul recognized that. Maybe I should have taken it away from the bank, I don\u2019t know, maybe I\nwas too honest.",
        "Q: Do you remember when you came on the boat into New York harbor?",
        "A: Yeah, I remember.",
        "Q: Were you allowed to come up on deck at that point?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. You were allowed to get up and get your little suitcase, whatever you had and get\nready to -- to -- you had to go through customs and you had to go -- I forgot, you -- well, you\nalready had a card that you could go to work from the consul in London, he gave you the blue\ncard.",
        "Q: What time of day did you come into New York?",
        "A: 12 o\u2019clock in the morning -- 10 o\u2019clock. Twel -- the boat went up, you passed the Statue of\nLiberty and we docked about 11 - 12 o\u2019clock.",
        "Q: What were you thinking at that point?",
        "A: Well, it was freedom. St -- liberty. It was a beautiful feeling. You a -- you achieved\nsomething, accomplishment.",
        "Q: Yeah. And when you got off the boat, what did you do?",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- I put my head together, I took my luggage and I inquired the subway and I\nwalked to 42\u2122 Street where I finally was able to catch a subway to take to Long Island, because I\nhad a cousin living in Jackson Heights. And I went there all by myself with my luggage and I got\noff at the right station and I went up and I knocked at the door, here I am.",
        "Q: Did they know you were coming?",
        "A: I think they had an idea, but they didn\u2019t know when or anything.",
        "Q: What di -- what happened then?",
        "A: Well, they took me in.",
        "Q: Luckily.",
        "A: And -- and I stayed it -- a few days later I went to work in long -- in New York.",
        "Q: How did you get a job?",
        "A: I we -- I went -- I walked up and down Broadway looking for a job. I -- I had to start working\nto make some money. So I got settled down fast and I stayed there. I slept on the living room\nsofa. They didn\u2019t throw me out.",
        "Q: And what was it like those first few weeks there? What was it like for you? Were you happy,\nwere you --",
        "A: I was very happy. I was free. I -- I was able to breathe fresh air. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very -- it\u2019s\nnot easy to describe what happens those days, but I managed. That was 1939. America was in\nuproar then, the politics. Some wanted war, some wanted not to fight the Germans. You know, in\nWashington was no peace. Roosevelt already was president for the second term and they were\nfighting him and there was a lot of uproar in America. But you didn\u2019t worry about that, you\ncouldn\u2019t change anything. You just watched it. But there were a lot of forces who wanted to side\nwith Germany. That was another chapter.",
        "Q: Did you get involved in those discussions with people?",
        "A: No. I tried not to, because I was a guest -- well here I was not a guest any more, but I was\nvery careful. I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t get up in discussions what\u2019s right and wrong. Was -- it was\nsomething and you -- you -- you had to lay low. But it was an experience.",
        "Q: And what -- what work did you get there on Broadway?",
        "A: I worked in a department store in the stockroom. And we were t-tw -- twelve dollars a week\nfor 48 hours, but 1t was -- 1t was money. You could live on it.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: [had to give my cousin eight dollars a week to fi -- to -- to eat and sleep there and I had four\ndollars to spend. Was all right. I didn\u2019t starve.",
        "Q: And -- and you s -- made plans then to bring your parents, is that right?",
        "A: Well, the parents were -- were sitting in London waiting also to -- and they got a -- a month or\nsix weeks later they got their visa to come to America. And they came on the same boat I came\nover.",
        "Q: And how did they -- did somebody put money in the bank for them?",
        "A: No, they had to -- a -- a relative in Philadelphia who signed the affidavit for them. A -- a --\nwidow, very nice lady. I paid her a lis -- a visit a few years later. She was very generous. She\npaid -- she -- she -- she signed the papers, she didn't give them any money or anything, but she\nsigned the papers to bring them here.",
        "Q: So when di -- when did they come?",
        "A: They came about six weeks after I came.",
        "Q: That fast?",
        "A: That fast, yeah.",
        "Q: You were lucky, they were lucky too.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- and I was lucky to get out from England because the British were starting to take\nthe refugees and sending them either to Canada or to Australia. They didn\u2019t allow them to st -- to\nsettle in England. In other words, they were all temporary. And they started to -- to send them\nout to their colonies, which they cou -- no one could refuse because they were just told to go -- to\nget on a boat and go. They didn\u2019t have to buy a ticket or anything, the British government forced\nthem to go, either to Canada or to Australia.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: And quite a few left when their visa didn\u2019t come up as fast as mine came up, they went. They\nhad to go. I knew -- then later on, some of those people came back to New York.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: We had la -- quite a few people like that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But at least they were free. That -- that\u2019s another story.",
        "Q: When your parents came, did they come to New York? Did your parents come into New\nYork?",
        "A: Yeah, my parents came to New York and I picked them up and took them to the same\napartment where I was. Yeah, yes.",
        "Q: And they all -- and then all of -- and your sister, too, and brother?",
        "A: Yeah, they all -- they came and they went. They went to Baltimore because my older brother\nsettled in Baltimore and I had aunt who had settled in Baltimore, the family settled in Baltimore,\nbut I stayed in New York. I figured I\u2019d try to make a go in New York.",
        "Q: You liked it?",
        "A: No -- no -- never regret it.",
        "Q: You like New York? You liked it?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: You liked it right away? Did you like New York afa --",
        "A: Yeah, I liked New York. It was a -- a metropolitan city. I didn\u2019t have money to see anything,\nbut I liked it. It was -- after London comes New York.",
        "Q: Yeah [indecipherable] right. So your parents were in Baltimore and you were here.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you were working and did you get an apartment of your own?",
        "A: No. I stayed there til I was drafted. No, I didn't look for an apartment my own, I didn\u2019t have\nenough money to even consider one and I didn\u2019t need it. I was taken care of, and so I was da --\nwa-was about two years and the war had started November -- December 7\"\", 1941, and we the --\nwe were drafted in 1942. I was drafted in -- it\u2019s in the book. No, I think it was mo -- May -- May\nor June 1942. And --",
        "Q: And -- and what did you think when you got that notice? Were you happy, or did you --",
        "A: Well, I couldn\u2019t fight it. I had to go, I was at the right age and I was healthy. And we had to\ncontribute to win the war. That was all there was to it. You couldn\u2019t fight it, you had to do your\npart. That\u2019s how it started, and to -- we -- we were taken -- you -- you don\u2019t know the routine\nthey had in New York. You had to go to your draft board, then they took you over to Governor\u2019s\nIsland, which is way down Manhattan, and there they swore you in. Then they took you to Penn\nStation, you got on a train and they took you to Camp Upton, way ou -- way out near Riverhead.\nAnd there you changed into uniforms and you got a few tests and you send your clothes home.\nAnd that was the end of being your own boss. You got your three meals a day and you got\nmedical examinations. You -- you got -- you were part of the army.",
        "Q: And by that time did you feel like -- did you feel like an American, or --",
        "A: Yes, well you were wearing the American uniform. You were a part of the system.",
        "Q: But did it feel odd to you? I mean, didn\u2019t it feel iro --",
        "A: No, you felt you were better off being there than being in Germany in a concentration camp.\nSo you felt good about it. And you -- yo-you grew up in the army. You -- you had to learn the\nslang wen -- language. You had to do a lot of things you weren\u2019t used to, but you managed.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re going to switch tapes.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Okay. So you\u2019ve -- you\u2019re inducted into the U.S. Army?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When was it? June of \u201942?",
        "A: June of \u00b042.",
        "Q: And basic training, what was that like for you?",
        "A: We trained out to la -- to Camp Upton. We stayed there four or five days to get uniform, to\nget all -- and certain tests and medical examination, that was -- you were in. You couldn\u2019t -- you\ncouldn\u2019t run away any more. You had to send your civilian clothes home. Y-You were tol -- they\ntold you, not allowed to wear civilian clothes any more. You -- you\u2019re in for duration plus six\nmonths. So you don\u2019t know duration was a month or a year or five years.",
        "Q: Right. Wow. When you went in, you said it was better -- you know, you prefer to be in the\nU.S. Army than to be back in Germany.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Did you know about concentration camps in Germany at that time? Did -- how much did you\nknow about what was going on?",
        "A: We knew that Dachau had existed and the other camps, because you heard a lot about them.\nBut you really didn't know what was going on til they finally put you in there and you\nexperienced it.",
        "Q: After -- after you arrived.",
        "A: But -- but -- but it -- that was a definite future for them, to use them and to punish people who\nwere -- politically didn\u2019t agree with them. In other words, people who were more t --\nCommunists or certain other tribes, they didn\u2019t want them, so they put them in there and\ncontrolled them so they couldn\u2019t undermine the Nazi government.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That was one of the reasons they built the concentration camp.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Of course, then they used them to put the Jews 1n af -- especially after the war started and\nnobody could leave Germany any more, that was a -- a different story.",
        "Q: Now your -- your whole family got out.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But did you have other relatives who were not able to get out?",
        "A: Oh yes, I had uncles and aunts and cousins, they weren\u2019t able to get out. They were -- they\nbecame part of the system that were destroyed, yes. You still got a few letters from them p-\npleading with you to help them, but you couldn\u2019t do anything, because first of all we had no\nmoney and they had no connections to make to -- to -- to leave Germany. It was -- it was\ndesperate pleas for -- for them to come and look for help. I was a rare case that I was able to save\nmy family.",
        "Q: It must have been hard to get those letters.",
        "A: It was hard to get the letters, yes. But th-th -- I had some, my father left some for me, it was\nheartbreaking, if you know what I mean. Even some I -- I had a couple of uncles where the son\nalready was in America and he couldn\u2019t do anything for them. He had no money and he had no --\nno way of anybody signing an affidavit for them. It was -- and the war came very suddenly,\nwhen the borders were closed, if you know what I\u2019m saying. And like I say to schoolchi -- a\nfriend of mine, whose family was well-to-do with paintings and everything, he -- they couldn\u2019t\nget out. They -- they were settling in Holland and nobody realized overnight Holland can be\noverrun and connected to Germany and there was no mu -- nobody allowed to leave Holland any\nmore. And some people went into France and they were caught in France. You -- you don\u2019t\nknow what was -- what -- wha-what was right and wrong. It was impossible to plan anything. It\u2019s\n-- it\u2019s really hard to describe. And then there were a lot of American relatives who didn\u2019t want to\nhelp and didn\u2019t bend over to help. It\u2019s -- you -- you don\u2019t know what to do. You don\u2019t know how\nlucky I was, besides saving myself.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s hard to describe it. My -- my children always ask me questions about that, because they\nadmired me, the way I was able to handle it. You read it -- you read it in the book, too. I was so\nlucky. And that\u2019s why I felt I have to give back something, and I did my best in the army to do\nthe right thing.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about your military service, cause you -- you went in in June of 1942, and where\ndid you go for basic training?",
        "A: Camp Wheeler, Georgia. The -- th -- from Fort Upton they put you on a troop train, you don\u2019t\nknow where you\u2019re going, but the train took you to Camp Wheeler near Macon, Georgia. And it\nwas a big camp that was built up for that purpose and there is 90 days tough training. An-And --\nbut no matter what -- how tough it was, you couldn\u2019t compare anything to remind you of the\nconcentration camp. You had three good meals a day. It was hot during the summer, but you had\nto learn to live with the climate, but you managed and you knew it was 1 -- you were in for\nawhile. And from Camp Wheeler I was lucky, I met another friend who was good to me, Freddy\nStrauss.",
        "Q: And who was Freddy?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Who was Freddy Strauss?",
        "A: He -- he was an -- his mother was a distant relative of my mother, who came from New York\nand he was working in Cincinnati and he got drafted and he was in Camp Wheeler a few months\nbefore me and he was graduate from New York University, he al -- he al-already was a sergeant\nand he worked in a regimental headquarters. So I met him some -- some weekend, Saturday\nsomeplace and he took care of me. He started to take me to Atlanta for a weekend, he -- he took\nover. We had good meals in Atlanta, we -- we were like a -- like brothers. It was unbelievable\nthat I as a trainee was allowed -- he went to the sergeant to get permission to take me and I\nalready was a little bit elevated, if you know what I mean.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And we stayed friends all our lives. He passed away very young, in middle of 1955 or \u201960. I\nstill in touch with his three boys.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Once I make a friendship, it lasts. They -- they just hang on to me.",
        "Q: And when did you --\nQ2: Could you fix his sweater [indecipherable] on the left side.",
        "Q: On the left side? Okay. I\u2019m going to f -- I\u2019m going to fix your sweater, it\u2019s kind of folded\nhere.",
        "A: Okay, okay.",
        "Q: There you go.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: Okay? That look good?\nQ2: Yes, perfect, thank you.",
        "A: Is it all right now?\nQ2: Yeah, it\u2019s perfect, thank you.",
        "Q: That\u2019s good, okay.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re 1n -- you\u2019re in Georgia?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And when did you ship out for --",
        "A: 90 days. They took you on a truck to Macon, there\u2019s a federal courthouse there and they took\nyou in and the judge swears you in with all the other non-citizens. There was Italians, there was\nGreeks, they weren\u2019t all Jews. And you get sworn in. After 90 days you become an American\ncitizen. You didn\u2019t have to wait five years. They figured -- this is the routine they took. They\ndidn\u2019t isolate us like they isolated the Japanese citizens and put them in camps. They gave us the\nprivilege of becoming a citizen so they didn\u2019t have to worry where we would have to go in the\nwar.",
        "Q: Did you know about the Japanese being interned in California at that time?",
        "A: I may have read something in the paper, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Did you ever have any fears or concerns that you would be --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Once I was a citizen, I was equal.",
        "Q: But before that, did you have any?",
        "A: Before that? Well, it was only 90 days.",
        "Q: No, but you had been in the country for a couple of years.",
        "A: Yeah, no, then you had your papers to stay. You were allowed to work. You --",
        "Q: But you -- you -- you were never --",
        "A: I was never in danger, no. I had papers --",
        "Q: Or fearful?",
        "A: -- to wait five years to become a citizen.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I was never in danger of being arrested or deported or anything like that. While the\nJapanese, you know, they weren\u2019t asked questions, 1t was just a government ruling to put them\naway.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The government was nervous, that\u2019s all I can say.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Some of them became good soldiers, yo-you -- you understand what I mean.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t ask for that isolation, but no, we had no problem. After 90 days you were sworn\nin, and that was full fledged citizen.",
        "Q: And then you went to England?",
        "A: No, they sent me to Augusta to another outfit.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: A regular fort infantry division that th-th-they -- they were filling the army divisions with the\nnew recruits, so so many went here, so many went -- we were sent all over. I want -- went in a\ngroup to go to Augusta, Georgia, and I was put in the fourth infantry division. And there were\nproblems, but you had to overcome it. I was a refugee, I was a Jew, I was a -- a Yankee. I was\neverything but as -- American.",
        "Q: To them.",
        "A: Yeah. Hillbillies. Hillbillies, some of them, a lot of them had never seen a Jew, they thought\nthat Jews had to grow horns. And it was a tough life for awhile. Eve-Even the officers, some of\nwhom were regular army officers, some of them were reserve officers and then a little later came\nthe young ones, the -- what we call the 90 day wonders. They were the college kids who were\nsent to some kind of a school in Fort Benning and after 90 days they got sworn in as a second\nlieutenant. They were mixed, from all over the country. But the old-time officers were not too\nfriendly to us refugees. They were their own -- their own people and they -- they spent every\nyear two weeks in the army reserve for two weeks training and they let you know that they are\nregular army people. Th-They felt differently.",
        "Q: And how many of you were there? How many refugees were there?",
        "A: [have no idea.",
        "Q: But, around the group that you were with, a lot? Th --",
        "A: I have no idea how many --",
        "Q: -- a few?",
        "A: -- | -- I don\u2019t know how many Jews. I think we had in the fourth division, six percent Jews in\nthe division, but how many of the Jews were refugees, I don\u2019t know. It -- it -- we weren\u2019t\ngrouped as a group to associate with one another. There was too many different units that we\nwere distributed.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t seek each other out?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t -- we me -- we met. There was a rabbi in the division and he held the service\nFriday night and we met maybe 20 - 25 boys there. But a -- but the-the-they were not refugees,\nthey were Americans. So you met Jews, but you didn\u2019t know exactly how many. But we always\nhad the figure of about six percent. In other words, the division wa -- had about 14,000 people\nand there was supposed to be about six or 700 Jews amongst -- distributed between the officers\nand the men. It 1 -- it -- it was never an isolated group. We were always mixed in. And like I say,\nafter awhile you were respected. But it was not easy.",
        "Q: What were some of the difficult things?",
        "A: Well, you were a minority, you were a refugee, which they all could understand and they just\ndidn\u2019t love you. When -- when it was time for a detail, they picked on you. You do this tonight,\nyou do that. You had no choice. But sooner or later you grew up and you demanded more\nrespect, and --",
        "Q: Did you get into fights with people?",
        "A: No, no, no. Never. No fights with anybody, because I wasn\u2019t made to be a fighting man. But\nit was tough. And we had a rabbi, who was a -- a good man from the seminary and he had a\ntough job also. He was part in the chapel to have services Friday night and he had to go to the\ndifferent regiments to maintain services, and he had to take the interest of the Jewish boys. It was\npart of his job.",
        "Q: So when -- when were you sent to England? When did you go to England?",
        "A: To England? I told you I went to England January 1939.",
        "Q: No, the second time --",
        "A: Oh, oh --",
        "Q: -- the second time.",
        "A: -- wi -- wi -- oh. That\u2019s something else.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: The second time you went.",
        "A: The army -- the army sent the fourth division from Georgia to Fort Dix, New Jersey, 16,000\nmen. In Fort Dix we were supposed to go to Africa to fight the war in Africa.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what they told you?",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s why they sent us to Fort Dix, Fort Dix was near lu -- near Brooklyn where they\nloaded up the troops and sent them. While in Fort Dix they realized they had no facilities\nshipping to -- to handle us. So we couldn\u2019t go. Marking time in Fort Dix, they -- then they sent\norders and sent us to Florida. In Florida they sent us out in the wilderness. There is a wilderness\nin Florida, it\u2019s west of sa -- Tallahassee. It\u2019s on the Gulf of Mexico. They had little huts there,\nlittle barracks, they had floors, rattlesnakes crawling all over. And there we got our first taste of\namphibious training. In other words, we were marked to partake in Europe at something special.\nSo they gave us training, small old boats to go out on the gulf, and it -- it was there,\nThanksgiving day 1943 and a storm came up and some of the boats turned over and a couple of\nfellows drowned. They didn\u2019t care, they said, you got to be trained.",
        "Q: So you were practicing landing crafts.",
        "A: Yeah, broken down landing crafts, not the -- not the new ones. The navy was there, the coast\nguard was there, there was an island off the coast, it was called Dark Islands. The air force used\nit to put their bombs into certain buildings there. It was -- it was a rough training.",
        "Q: Was that near Panama City, or pen --",
        "A: Not too far away.",
        "Q: -- Pensacola?",
        "A: Pensacola. Tallahassee. Apalachicola was the next town, if you know the neighborhood.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was 50 miles away from Tallahassee.",
        "Q: 50 miles from Tallahassee.",
        "A: Yeah. Anyhow, we stayed there from about September to November -- November, I believe.\nThree months or something for training. And they told you you can\u2019t go home, you can\u2019t get a\nfurlough unless you know how to swim 50 yards. They had a pool there, you forced yourself to\nswim it so you get a furlough to go home.",
        "Q: Did you know how to swim before that?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, but they gave me a pass anyhow. Then they loaded us up again on a train and\nsent us to South Carolina, Fort Jackson. They -- I was home on furlough when the orders came,\ndon\u2019t come back to Florida, go to Fort Jackson, South Carolina. So I went there and we stayed\nthere a month for more, what they call strip down and preparation. Then they shipped us up to\nNew Jersey, Fort ca -- Camp Kilmer, near New Brunswick. There we had to stay two weeks to\nget our shots and our overseas equipment and all that stuff. And then we left early January.",
        "Q: Early January.",
        "A: Early January for -- for the s -- trip to lond -- to England, yes.",
        "Q: Crossing the Atlantic in January.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And the submarines were out there waiting for us. You had no choice.",
        "Q: Did you get fired on?",
        "A: No, n-no --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- no submarines deta -- was a convoy of about 50 boats and destroyers going around all the\ntime, no, no submarine came, no. No nothing. We were lucky, that\u2019s all, because pa -- prior to\nthat they lost boats with troops [indecipherable] on the ocean. But we were -- we were lucky,\nnobody actually worried, because they needed us in Europe.",
        "Q: Were you excited to go? Did you --",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t have. I want -- I\u2019m glad I went to Europe and not to Pacific. That -- that feeling I\nhad, because at -- at -- at least I knew I w -- I had a language and I -- I felt I belonged there.",
        "Q: Did you have a feeling that you wanted to fight Germans, or --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yeah, I had the feeling. And -- and my break came when they invited me for an interview to\ngo up f -- division as an interpreter. And that\u2019s when I got a job and I became a mensch.",
        "Q: When you got to England that happened?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: When you got to England that happened?",
        "A: Yeah, but when I -- n-no, it happened in March, so it was about a month or two after coming\nto England that it happened, yeah. I have the dates down.",
        "Q: And why do you say that\u2019s when you became a mensch?",
        "A: Well, you were with different people, you were doing different things. I -- I became a -- a\nJeep driver, I became somebody that was important.",
        "Q: You had privileges?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: You had some privileges?",
        "A: Yes, privileges, and wi-with a different group of people. You met officers who were ranking\nand educated and with entirely different life.",
        "Q: So you knew then from the spring, from March on, that you were going to be a translator. If\nyou hadn\u2019t been asked to do that, what would you have been doing?",
        "A: Ihave been -- I would have been fighting 1n the front line. Would have been one of the first to\nland on the beach. And th-the -- the beach we invaded was -- was wa -- lucky, th-they -- they\npractically walked across. And was -- was like -- not like a war time. E-Even Colonel Reider told\nme he was pulling flags out [indecipherable] and it means wor-worry they\u2019re mines, but there\nwere only flags, there were no mines in the ground. If there would have been mines, we would\nhave had lots of casualties. But they didn\u2019t -- either they didn\u2019t have mines or they didn\u2019t want\nthem there. Rommel might have been da -- may have done it on purpose, we don\u2019t know. He\ndidn\u2019t live long enough to tell us.",
        "Q: Right. When you -- when the invasion was launched, can you tell some stories about\npreparing yourself the night before -- but you knew you weren't going to go onshore with a gun\nlike in a first wave. Did you --",
        "A: No, y-you -- you were out on the water, on the channel for practically four days, because we\nloaded up on a Friday night and the boat pulled out to make room for another boat. There were --\nthere were 5,000 boats to be loaded, and go out into the channel to prepare. And it took time to\nload these boats, because you had to drive on your equipment, you had to pack it onto the boat so\nyou could drive off. Nothing was normal, everything was practically upside-down. And in -- in\nthe midst of everything, you looked up in the sky, where are the German planes? You worried\nwhen they come out and put the bombs on you or anything like that. And it didn\u2019t come out. And\nthe weather, once we were out on the channel, the weather turned bad. Was a big storm coming\nup, so they -- they decided they couldn\u2019t land that day, on the fifth of June. The -- the sea was too\nrough, they couldn\u2019t unload or anything. So they delayed it 24 hours, we were circling more on\nthe water, worried, where are the German planes? And they didn't show up. So we were more\nthan lucky that there was no interference for -- for the whole fle -- crew. The British, the French,\nthe American, everybody was calm. And then, finally they decided if they don\u2019t la-land the next\nday, they have to delay it another two or three weeks, because of the moon and the tide. They\nwere worried that it\u2019s high water, to get the boats in closer. So they decided to land as -- on June\nsixth. The decision came 24 hours before, that Eisenhower made the decision, this 1s it, we have\nto land.",
        "Q: Do you remember hearing that --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- announcement?",
        "A: Yeah. So wa -- we were on the boat, the -- the captain of the boat had to know. And in a way\nit -- we felt 1t was good to get it over with, because if it would have been another day, they would\nhave had to turn around, put more fuel into the boats, because they were going to run low on fuel\nafter circling four days out on the water. So the -- June six opened it up, and there still was no\nGerman airplanes, which wa-was like a miracle. And the German pilots had -- they had moved\ntheir -- their airplanes away from the front in France, way back to practically the German border,\nso they were confused also. Rommel had gone home to visit his wife for that week.",
        "Q: It was her birthday.",
        "A: Yeah. So, she cooperated. [laughter] We should have given her a medal. What are you\nlaughing?",
        "Q: Was -- so tell me when you personally went on -- on shore? What do you remember about\nwhen you landed? What did you -- what were you doing?",
        "A: I described it in the book. I did nothing, I was -- my -- my Jeep was not allowed to be a part of\nthe invasion fleet, 1t wasn\u2019t deemed necessary enough for me to have it the first week.",
        "Q: You chief?",
        "A: My Jeep, yeah. I left it back in England.",
        "Q: Your Jeep.",
        "A: My Jeep, yeah.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So I went without anything, just my personal equipment.",
        "Q: And you were a translator, but who were you attached to?",
        "A: Division -- division headquarters. I wa -- I could be shifted around wherever they needed me,\nbut I didn\u2019t have my own Jeep the first two weeks because th-they couldn\u2019t handle all the\nequipment so they left some transportation behind, and that came in two weeks later when --\nwhen I got my own Jeep. So --",
        "Q: So when you -- on the first day, what did you do? Did you have to translate?",
        "A: I -- I stayed with my truck where we all were, and we moved inland about five, six miles and\nwe started to eat supper and settle down a little. We were eating the box K rations, what they\nused to call it, and it helped that -- we ate the same food aboard the ship. The navy couldn\u2019t feed\nus, they didn\u2019t have the know-how or the time or the equipment.",
        "Q: What time of day did you go ashore?",
        "A: About four -- five o\u2019clock in the afternoon.",
        "Q: And the invasion had started that morning?",
        "A: The morning, you -- nothing, you stood around and looked over and see if the airplanes are\ncoming.",
        "Q: No, but w -- the invasion had s -- already begun that morning, right? And you --",
        "A: Yeah, seven o\u2019clock this morning -- in the morning.",
        "Q: -- and you came at five in the afternoon of the same day?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. The invasion started seven in the morning, clock-wise.",
        "Q: Was there still gunfire, shooting going on in the --",
        "A: You heard gunfire, yes, yeah. You had sh -- you had shells coming in and small arms fire, but\nyo-you -- you didn\u2019t worry, you just went and hoped for the best, that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: So that was your first day in combat?",
        "A: That was the first day in France.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, you passed, you looked, you read the report how Colonel Gaitling observed the first\nfarmer, how they lead a comfortable life. They didn\u2019t know the war was going on. You -- you\ncan\u2019t believe everything. But it was un-unreal, if you know what I mean.",
        "Q: Were you called upon -- okay, we need to take a break.",
        "A: When I think back, I -- I --\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: Okay, you got something on your lip. There you go.",
        "A: Wipe off the Chinese food.",
        "Q: Yes, that\u2019s good. Okay.",
        "A: Okay, and thank you.",
        "Q: You\u2019re welcome.",
        "A: Anything else not in order?",
        "Q: No, it looks good. It\u2019s looking good. When we stopped, you had s -- you were telling me\nabout coming ashore in France --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- in June of 1944. You were a translator. How long was it before you got to employ your\ntranslator skills?",
        "A: Well, th -- it was either the first or second night, I went out on a patrol by myself and I\ncaptured a German soldier; he came out of the woods. So I was able to talk to him, he was not\nreally German, he was Czechoslovak, but he -- he knew German. That\u2019s when I started using it.",
        "Q: Yeah. And after that experience, what --",
        "A: After that you don\u2019t know when you ran into something. I was not in char -- in charge to\ninterrogate prisoners. They had special teams on each regiment called interrogation of prisoners\nof war. They had at least three German speaking fellows there, in each team. And they took care\nof the prisoners. It was not my responsibility.",
        "Q: What kinds of things were you doing? What kinds of translation were you doing?",
        "A: Well, I was doing a ch -- military government and division headquarters if they had problems.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And what -- and what would happen? Would they call you and say we\u2019re going\nsomeplace, we need you to come?",
        "A: Yeah, an officer would say, let\u2019s go here and there, that\u2019s it. And th -- and then I drove and he\nsat next to me and when we hit Germans, I talked f-for him and translated. That -- that went on\nall -- all week, all day, every day something special.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Sunday morning sometimes we went to -- we had to give them permission if they wanted a\nchurch service. They weren\u2019t allowed to gather without our permission.",
        "Q: Who?",
        "A: The Germans. German civilians. So one of the majors always said, let\u2019s check the church\nservice. So I -- we drove over to the next village where the church was and went in. And that\nservice usually was nine o\u2019clock -- eight o\u2019clock, nine o\u2019clock we went in and we sat in the back.\nAnd I had to listen to what was going on and tell him. So at the end they usually had three Ave\nMarias for their old people, for their children, for their sick people. And when they were finished\nwith that, I got up and I yelled, and one Ave Maria for our liberators. And they didn\u2019t like it, but\nthey s -- they sa -- recited it. And the major always said, very good, I like the way you did it. We\nhad to let them know we are watching.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you go into Paris when Paris was liberated?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: My -- the fourth division liberated Paris.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We were -- we were hand picked for that beca -- I don\u2019t know -- wa -- wa -- one of the\nreasons I know, there was a -- a-an -- an officer or a colonel, a very elegant fellow, he spent two\nyears in Paris in the American embassy as military attach\u00e9 before the war. So he knew Paris\ninside-out. So they told his regiment to be the leading regiment into Paris, because he knew\nevery corner -- and I wa -- I was going to say, every elegant woman. I think that may have been\nthe reason th -- the for -- not th-the reason, but the regiment was picked as the leading regiment.",
        "Q: Because of him?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Because of him?",
        "A: Because of him, yeah. You know, you -- you -- the average officer didn\u2019t know anything\nabout Paris and Paris was a blackout city, no streetlight, no other light, nothing. It was daylight\nor -- or | -- or dark. I was having my Major Fissette for three days, we were riding up and down\nParis. He had to take care of lots of things. And they attached a French professor to us to -- to\nguide us, to help us. So this professor, he -- he lived in Neuille, which is north of Paris, elegant\nsap -- elegant wife, but he would have to sleep home at night. He wouldn\u2019t a -- be able to sleep\nwith us. So at 10 o\u2019clock, 11 o\u2019clock at night, I had to drive through Paris in a blackout and --\nwith my major and bring him home. And then come back to find our headquarters, which was in\na zoo. We were sleeping in the zoo in Paris, we didn\u2019t go to the Ritz hotel.",
        "Q: I bet you had -- every day was completely different, and --",
        "A: Every day was a little bit different.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: E-Even when -- if the headquarters didn\u2019t move, there was always something different to do.\nAnd of course the first -- the first big challenge came when we hit Cherbourg, 20 -- 24 - 25 days\nafter landing on D-Day. That was the -- the first city that came -- that was liberated o -- the\nmayor may have come in --",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: -- if I heard something. And that -- that city was important because they needed the deep dock\nfor the big boats to come in.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the freight and everything. So into Paris -- in-into Cherbourg, I was alone, I had no\nofficer with me. So I drove in and I -- I didn\u2019t speak French, a few words, and I decided -- I\nchecked myself into the German military hospital. I figured some of the bi-big Nazi bastards may\nput bandages on, or cl -- or -- or -- legs or arms or something, and give themselves up as soldiers\nso they wouldn\u2019t get arrested. But I -- I couldn\u2019t find any in the hospital under that duration, and\nthe smell in that hospital was impossible. So after an hour or so I checked out. I couldn\u2019t -- I\ncouldn\u2019t find anybody and I didn't -- couldn\u2019t stay any longer, th-the smell -- they had dead\npeople, they buried them in the backyard, and it was miserable. So I checked out and I went to\nthe Hotel Atlantic where the division had set up headquarters and I put a blanket on the floor in\nthe lobby and I slept there for a few hours. General Roosevelt was -- had been appointed\ncommanding officer of the Cherbourg area.",
        "Q: Did you know him?",
        "A: I met him, but I didn\u2019t know him, but Major Fissette worked with him for -- for -- lived with\nhim for three, four months.",
        "Q: This was President Roosevelt\u2019s son?",
        "A: The first president\u2019s son.",
        "Q: Yes, Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s son.",
        "A: Yeah, Teddy -- Teddy Roosevelt, yeah. The first president\u2019s son. He wa -- he was -- what can\nI say, he was all hepped up to be there. He already had fought in Africa and he came to the\ndivision. They assigned him to help the fourth division and he loved it.",
        "Q: Let me ask you this. Because you were -- knew the German language and because you grew\nup in Germany, do you think that you had insight into German soldiers or German movements,\nor German military operations in any way that was helpful?",
        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t help the military because I wasn\u2019t supposed to talk to capt -- to --\nto prisoners.",
        "Q: But -- but did you have knowledge of how things worked?",
        "A: I had knowledge if I could -- could sit down with them and question them, but I wasn\u2019t\nsupposed to do this, I had to stick to my headquarters.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Because they had special guys in each regiment who were supposed to -- to stick to these\nsoldiers and try to get them to talk and find out. That\u2019s why one of the fellows in the 22\ninfantry hit a German soldier and he -- he claims, if you give me a map, I\u2019ll show you exactly\nwhere Rommel\u2019s headquarters is. So he opened up a map and the guy really pointed it out, it was\na certain chateau in a small village. And that information they gave to the air corps and within a\nfew days they bombed the road leading to the headquarters and Rommel was driving on that road\nand was wounded very badly. He was unconscious for a week. Of course, they didn\u2019t know he\nwanted to be our friend. So it shows you what can happen.",
        "Q: Yeah. I want to go back to Paris. Any other -- did -- any other good stories from anything that\nhappened to you in Paris? How long were you there?",
        "A: No, I was there three days with a Major Fissette. We were together day and night. We closed\nwhore houses, we -- we did all kinds of crazy things.",
        "Q: Like what? Can you remember some of them?",
        "A: I have -- I have to read up the book or something.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I -- I know what -- three days we ran at -- back and forth at day -- daybreak and at night to --\nto north of Paris to bring the professor home and pick him up in the morning.",
        "Q: Were there very many Germans in Paris at that time or had they --",
        "A: There were some -- mayb -- I would say between 10 and 15,000.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They were -- most of them were taken prisoners and they wanted to be taken prisoners by the\nAmericans because the free French wanted to kill them. So they\u2019d rather offered themselves to\nthe Americans to feel more secure.",
        "Q: Right. And after Paris, where did you go? That was in the late summer of 1944, right?\nAugust?",
        "A: That was in June -- i-in s -- August 24. August 25\" Paris was liberated.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And where did you after that?",
        "A: North into Belgium. We were in Belgium about s -- about September first, probably. I have\nthe history.",
        "Q: And it was in the low countries that you met Ernest Hemingway, is that right?",
        "A: Ernest Hemingway, we -- he already was in Paris, but I didn't meet him. He came in\npractically before the American soldiers. He had his own little army and he was able -- he spoke\nFrench, he was able to go wherever he wanted to go. He had a Jeep for himself and he had\nanother Jeep for si -- five or six or eight French volunteers from the FFI who protected him and\ndid everything we wanted him -- he was like a general.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: He was -- militarily he was a big -- a man of lots of experience, and he went in division\nheadquarters, he was allowed into any office, anything, and the generals asked him sometimes\nfor his opinion. And he also carried a gun. He wasn\u2019t supposed to, but he carried a gun. He was\nnearly thrown out from Europe for that.",
        "Q: And where did you meet him?",
        "A: I met him the first time in Germany when we liberate -- when we evacuated that town where -\n- where you have those pictures over there, pu [indecipherable]. It was dec -- September 16\" or\nsomething we met, and when we evacuated the town, he came in with John Rose tos -- together.",
        "Q: An artist, yeah.",
        "A: And that\u2019s when he -- when he -- [indecipherable] sat in a bay window and drew pictures all -\n- nobo -- not talking to anybody, and Hemingway was snooping around for wine, for whiskey.",
        "Q: Did you talk with him?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I wa -- I one time asked him how he made out with the two famous women, Ingrid Bergman\nand Marla Dietrich. He said, I couldn\u2019t touch them. [laughs]. I had guts to ask him.",
        "Q: So you knew who he was, he was famous by that time, you knew who he was.",
        "A: Oh, he was very famous.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You could see his -- his build, his uniform. He wor -- he wore a German fur lined jacket, a sh\n-- a Sheepskin jacket. He wore a big belt. [indecipherable]. He captured that in an African wars\nfrom a German officer. You could spot him a mile away.",
        "Q: Flamboyant.",
        "A: Beard most of the time. But very, very humble, very low key and very high class mind.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: He -- he was a -- and he was liked and they all wanted him to be attached to them. So he\nhappened to choose the fourth division, he spent three, four months with us --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- without moving. They gave him enough [indecipherable] they gave him enough -- whatever\nhe wanted to drink, they created for him.",
        "Q: So, did he spend that winter with you, then?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Winter -- winter of \u201944 - \u00b045 he was with you?",
        "A: Yeah, he was with us.",
        "Q: So you saw him regularly?",
        "A: Yeah, he went home j -- I think in January \u00b045, I think he went home.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He had enough.",
        "Q: It was a tough winter.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Then he went home to -- I -- I don\u2019t know whether he went to Cuba or whether he went to the\n-- to Florida, the beach, where he had a house.",
        "Q: And what -- what -- what was the winter like for you? What wa -- what kinds of things di --",
        "A: It was cold, miserable, snow, rain, everything. And then of course was the counterattack from\nthe Germans, December 16\", and that was no picnic for us. Was very tough. I -- I must tell y --\nte-tell you a story. We were in Swiya -- 1n bl -- in Zweifall, a German town, a small town, two,\nmaybe two, 3,000 [indecipherable] south of Aachen. Th-The battle of the Huertgen forest, I have\nthe story in German if you want it, I can give you. And there, we were in the -- in the town, and\nit was miserable. Water in the foxhole, fog, snow, everything. And they made me go out in the\nmorning, eight o\u2019clock to the next -- a big farm, to get milk for the children in the town. So every\nmorning I drove out and I got a couple of cans of milk. And one time a woman says to me, she\nwants to talk to an officer. I said, I'll bring you an officer. So next morning I said to Fissette, I\nsaid, there\u2019s a woman out there on the -- on the ranch, she wants to talk to an officer. He says,\nPll go with you. So I took him there and I showed him the house. I -- I knew she talked English\nso I didn\u2019t bother going in with him, I sent him in, and he talked to her. She asked him if he\nknew a Major Collin. So he said, yes, I know a Major Collins, he is General Collins now, he\u2019s a\ncorps commander, he\u2019s right here in the neighborhood. Well, she told him her name, I have it\nwritten down, ma -- phone so and so. He was -- he was her boyfriend in World War I. She was\nlooking for him. [laughs] You -- you laugh.",
        "Q: That\u2019s crazy, wow.",
        "A: See what a war can do?",
        "Q: People are people, huh? Yeah.",
        "A: So -- so Fissette fixed him up, he -- he -- he made sure the general goes and meets and looks\nup the old girlfriend.",
        "Q: Now, during this time in -- in -- in the -- the winter, you were still translating all the time, did\nyou ever have to fight in a --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You never did.",
        "A: No, the only time I shi -- I was doing a little shooting in Paris. I was on a bridge and they\nwere shooting down from a high-rise building and I took my gun and shoot back at them. But yo\n-- | didn\u2019t see anybody, but everybody else was shooting, so I was shooting also.",
        "Q: Again you were lucky, huh?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Again you were lucky.",
        "A: I was lucky, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Because I -- I -- I -- I tell you something, I was careful. I didn\u2019t stick my neck out when I\ndidn\u2019t have to, because I didn\u2019t see -- I couldn\u2019t see my being shipped home in a box to my\nfather. So I did not take any special dangerous missions. One time word came around they\nlooking for a German speaking fellow. The Germans had demanded that an American pe -- ma --\nofficer come over and look at an area where there\u2019s a prisoner of war camp so they wouldn\u2019t\nshoot and kill our own prisoners. So I said to myself, it\u2019s not my day. You know it, sometimes\nyou wake up in the morning, you have that feeling. I took my Jeep and went out hiding for a few\nhours. I figured, this is not for me today. Because sometimes if they hit a Jew, they can kill him\nand to send back and [indecipherable] he was in an accident, or something. So I didn\u2019t go that\nday. That afternoon I felt this is not for me. I went into hiding for a few hours and then I come\nback and then I found out they had an officer in one of the regiments, lieutenant something, and\nthey sent him over. But he came back all right with the information. You know, sometimes you\nwake up with a feeling, and -- and you have to take care of yourself. Another time, when we\nbroke out from Normandy, I was up in a villa -- in an -- in a -- in a town, was just taken. There\nwas still fighting there, Saint-Pois, it was right in Normandy. And I -- I drove into town like a big\nshot, and the officer, Captain Walker says to me, get the hell out of here, you have no business\nbeing here. I was ready to put up proclamations for the -- for the French people. So he says, get\nout. So I turned around and I got out. I figured if the mayor -- major throws you out, you\u2019re out. I\nwent back. Next day, I had -- th-the town was taken and I came back with my proclamations.\nAnd the town was on a little hill and it had -- when you go up it had like an S curve in order to\nget there. So on my way up to the town, I see a Jeep blown up. I passed this, and I said to myself,\nI don\u2019t know what happened. When I got up into the town and th -- the regiment from the 22\"\ninfantry was right next on the outskirts, one of the fellows, he knew me, he says, got bad news\nfor you. He says, your friend, Feinberg, whatever his name was, was killed last night. I said, he\nwas on patrol on a Jeep? He said yes. I said, I passed the Jeep. So I said nothing to -- the bodies\nwere torn to pieces, four of them. I said no-nothing and I felt -- I [indecipherable] I was on the\nroad the day before and nothing happened, so I figure the Germans came in during the night, put\nmines in the road. Because that Jeep was hit with a mine. So what can -- I could do nothing, if\nyou know what I mean. I just had bad news. He was a very smart fellow and we were friends, in\na way. Anyhow, coming home from the war, about -- must have been six, eight years later, I said\nto myself, I\u2019m going to Brooklyn to visit the family. The -- the least I can do. Th-Then -- I\nstarted out on a Sunday afternoon to go to Brooklyn. I had the address. Halfway down I said to\nmyself, if I tell them the truth, they\u2019Il be hurt, if I lie to them, they don\u2019t let me go til I break\ndown and tell them the truth. I turned around and went home. If you know what I mean. That\u2019s\nfeelings.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Tell me about when -- what -- when the war ended, in April --",
        "A: When the -- I was in the hospital when the war ended.",
        "Q: Before we -- before we go on, can you sit up a little bit? Because when you lean down I can\u2019t\nsee your face.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Okay, when you lean over like that, I can\u2019t see your face.",
        "A: Oh, okay.",
        "Q: Okay? We want to see your face, okay?",
        "A: Okay, you want me to move a little closer?\nQ2: No, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Q: You know what -- you know -- are you with me on that? I don\u2019t want him to have -- have to\nfeel so uncomfortable.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is it -- are you comfortable sitting up?",
        "A: \u2019'm comfortable.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I just can hear you better when I --",
        "Q: Okay, well Pll try and remember to talk louder.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t -- I just don\u2019t want you to -- I want -- I want us to see your face, okay?",
        "A: Wait a second, let me wipe my --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I try to help you. [tape break] Go ahead.",
        "Q: Okay. April -- where -- where were you in April? When the war ended, where were you?",
        "A: I was in a hospital in Dijon, France, I believe, because I had an o -- in April I had an appendix\nattack, and I turned myself in-into infirmary and they -- they -- the infirmary couldn\u2019t know\nmuch, they were not equipped for it, so they send me to another hospital, another hospital and the\n-- that la -- the \u2018nother hospital sent me down on a troo -- on a hospital train to Dijon, France,\nwhich was a general hospital. And there they decided I don\u2019t need the operation, I just need a\nfew days rest. So I was in that hospital and the guy in charge, the doctor in charge was a -- a -- a\nbig drunk. I do -- he came from Detroit, he was a major, but I could see no -- no future. He gave\nme about 40 pills to take in one day, and he just didn\u2019t know. I think he was filled up with liquor\nall the time. Anyhow, they finally let me go, three weeks later or something. And when you go in\nthe hospital you lose yourself. You can\u2019t pr -- you can\u2019t take a gun in with you, you can\u2019t take a\nknife in with you because they are very cautious that -- people go crazy, you -- you understand\nwhat I mean? So the -- all that they take away from you. Well anyhow, they discharged me and I\ngot a troop train up to cher -- into Germany. Worms, a city near the Rhine. And that was what\u2019s\ncalled a replacement depot. And I was in there waiting to get assigned. Meanwhile the war had\nended, and I forgot to tell you, the fourth division, in October \u201944, General Marshall came over\nto France and he made the speech in division headquarters, I wasn\u2019t there. He said, some of you\nboys will have to go to Japan when you finish the war here. So what can you do? You\u2019re part of\nthe division, division goes, you have to go. Anyhow, I didn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t too anxious to go back\nto the division, so they assigned me to six army group in Heidelberg. From the -- from Worms, I\nwas sent to Heidelberg and I joined -- I was in there, I was driving a Jeep, I was going on a few\ntrips with an officer. And I had, from civilian life I had a friend who was stationed in Heidelberg.\nHe worked for the signal corps. So I looked him up and we were friends, we were together and\nso on. So sure enough, in June the division was sent home, ready to redo -- regroup and go to\nJapan. They had no choice, General Marshall selected them. Yeah. Ye-Yeah. They took out the\nGerman speaking fellows and left them in Europe.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They figured they\u2019re no good in Japan. Anyhow, that\u2019s what happened, so I stayed in Europe,\nand I got myself another assignment. That\u2019s when I went to another replacement and took off\nand went to my hometown.",
        "Q: Now, tell me that story. Sit up -- sa -- can you sit up --\nQ2: No, before you -- we would like to change tapes before --",
        "Q: Oh, we\u2019re going to change --\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: -- in the role that you had, you had a lot of autonomy.",
        "A: I?",
        "Q: You si -- it seems like you had a lot of autonomy while you were in the service.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I mean, you -- you were able to -- you had a -- you did a lot of things on your own.",
        "A: I did.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I did. I had a Jeep.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I was -- I was not scared, I was courageous. I would go out on a patrol, I -- if I don\u2019t\nhave -- 1-1f I didn\u2019t have to drive an officer, I still went out and looked and see what I can do. I-\nIt\u2019s in the book, one time I picked up two officers that were shot through the arm. There\u2019s always\nsomething coming up you could do.",
        "Q: Yeah. Now let\u2019s tell the story now about how you ended up going back to your hometown.",
        "A: I went back to my hometown the first time I was stationed in Heidelberg. I said to the captain,\nI need a Jeep and I want to go and visit my hometown. He gave me a pass and the Jeep for a day\n-- for a day and a half.",
        "Q: This was in the summer?",
        "A: That was in the summer, yeah. That was in May a -- probably in June. And I drove there and\nI-I went in. I -- I -- I visited a good farmer that I knew was no Nazi and I felt safe to go in and w-\nwe had some lunch and he was glad to see me, he couldn\u2019t believe it. So I stayed there and I\nwent to the military government in Ochsenfurt and I told that captain who I am, and I said, I\u2019d\nlike to come and work for you. He says, I need you. And he was so pepped up, he got into his\nJeep and followed me in my Jeep to Heidelberg --",
        "Q: Because he wanted --",
        "A: -- which was about two to three hour drive.",
        "Q: Because he wanted you?",
        "A: Yeah, he wanted me. And he -- he followed right behind me and he went into the same\ncaptain who gave me the Jeep, he says, I need this man. And the captain says, I can\u2019t let you\nhave him. Just like that he -- he denied it ca -- ca -- I think 1t was Captain Friedman. Anyhow,\nthat was it, so a few days later Captain Friedman says to me, I want you to go out, I need some\nwine. I want you to go and get me a couple of hundred bottles of wine. I said, give me a Jeep, I'll\nget your wine. So I drove down to Mannheim and I see a sign, winery and I went in and I tell\nguy, I need some good wine. He says, I have it. He opened up cobblestones in his courtyard and\nhe pulled out a couple of cases of Moselle wine. I took 200 bottles, and I paid him a nickel a\nbottle. I didn\u2019t steal it. And after that the captain says to me, I\u2019m supposed to tell you the colonel\nsaid he never drank wine like that. I said, you tell him he\u2019ll never get it again like that. And that\nmiserable captain didn\u2019t even say to me, take a bottle for yourself, 1f you know what I mean. I\ndidn't need it, I always had a bottle of wine when I needed one. Anyhow, then a-all of a sudden\nthe order came transferring me to a replacement near Frankfurt. So I figured this 1s -- I\u2019m getting\naway from that captain. So I went to Frankfurt, but now -- but -- but now [indecipherable |\nHamburg, where the replacement office was and I checked in. And when I walked out in the\nbuilding, my friend Colonel Gaitling walks in the street. He had come back from aus -- he had\ncome back from somewhere and was ready for re-assignment. So he says, come up to my office,\nI want to talk to you. He had a -- a private room, a -- a major or a colonel gets treated well. So I\nwent up to his office, he\u2019s -- tried to hand me a bottle of cognac. He says, I want you to come\nwith me, I\u2019ve become security officer in Linz, which was Austria. I said, Colonel, as much as I\nlike to go with you, but I won\u2019t -- I have a de -- I have a desire to go to my hometown and take\ncare of things. He says, if you feel that way, you go and I get you some other time. So next\nmorning I pack my bundle and I go to the information -- no-not information office, the -- the --\nthe communication office where they handled the mail and so on. I said to the guy, a -- e -- a --\nare you going out into Germany with your distributings, your mail? He says yeah. I says, can I\ncome along? He says yeah, sit in the back of the Jeep. So I had my bundle with me, nothing but a\n-- in those days you had a ha -- half a duffel bag full. A set of underwear, and shoes, nothing\nmuch. So I sat, and within two hours we were at the very place I wanted to go. And I checked in\nwith the captain, I said, I\u2019m here to stay, unofficially. No --",
        "Q: Where --",
        "A: -- no papers.",
        "Q: Where were you?",
        "A: In Germany.",
        "Q: But --",
        "A: No papers, no nothing, I just packed and left. I didn't go in the office and tell them nothing. I\nfigured, if they find -- if they want me, they\u2019ll find me. So I went in and I started working. The\ncaptain was very happy, I had -- I knew people, I knew information, I knew what was going on.\nSo I worked there and I stayed there and nothing happened until about September first. Then all\nof a sudden they sent an order for me to go to Austria. I said no more, I had enough. I packed my\nbundle and I went into the next hospital and I told them I feel sick, I\u2019m out. And they -- they take\nme to another hos-hospital and then I got a hospital with a nice Jewish doctor from New York\nand he says, I\u2019m going to send you home. I said, I appreciate it. I took him out for -- w-we went\nback to where I was stationed, I poured some wine for him. I had place where the German army\nhad le-leather saddles from the horse ho -- from the cavalry days, and I gave him a -- I opened up\nthe door, I said here, you take yourself a couple -- he had the horse in Central Park at the time,\nfor the wife to ride. So I gave him a couple of saddles, he was out of this world. Brand new\nleather saddles, if you know what I\u2019m talking about. So anyhow, he sent me home. It took two,\nthree months, but I got home on the hospital ship.",
        "Q: When was it that you went back to your hometown, and wer --",
        "A: That was when I -- after I went to the -- to the military government, that\u2019s when I took the\ntime out to go to the hometown and arrest these fellows, and --",

        "A: Those [indecipherable |",
        "Q: So you -- you told me before that you went to your town for one night.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then --",
        "A: But that was just to acquaint myself.",
        "Q: Okay. Then what did you do?",
        "A: Then -- then when I packed from the replacement depot and got myself a ride with the chief\nto go, I went for good.",
        "Q: To your town?",
        "A: To the town, to the mili -- military government. I slept in their quarters and I worked for\nthem.",
        "Q: And what town was that in? What town was that in?",
        "A: Ochsen -- Ochsenfurt.",
        "Q: Which was just close-by to your hometown?",
        "A: Yes, it was four kilometer.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s where I settled down.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: For about six, eight weeks, maybe.",
        "Q: Okay, so in that six or eight weeks then, you went back to your village.",
        "A: Yeah, that -- that\u2019s the story written up in the Times.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They did a good job.",
        "Q: Right. But you have to tell me that.",
        "A: I -- I -- I started to work there and whatever I -- I -- the captain gave me assignments, do this,\ndo that and do all kinds of things. And these people in the military government, they were, in my\neyes not good soldiers. They were not brought up like -- like we were in the infantry, like real\nspit and span good soldiers, they --",
        "Q: The military government was there to oversee like the occupation.",
        "A: To oversee the rebuilding of the German system.",
        "Q: Right, it was not the same as the m-military.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s part of the military.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They wore the uniform, but they were civil service workers, schoolteachers, all kinds of\nprofessions, but they were not military --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- to be out fighting and winning a war.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: They -- they -- they did their own life. They were a little bit different from us. We all -- us old\nsoldiers, we all felt the same way. They -- they took two hour lunch breaks and they lived like\nkings and the war was over for them, they had all the time in the world to straighten out, to --\nwhat they -- their how -- their main job was to check civilians, who was a party member, who\nhad to be denazified, who had to be sent away to a camp or something. That was their main job,\nand then they started recruiting people to start, if they didn\u2019t belong to the party, to become a -- a\nlawyer or aj -- court judge or a civil service job to rebuild Germany. They had to ra -- to make\nsure the electric was rebuilt, the railroads were rebuilt. Everything was in shambles. Nothing was\nworking. Because when you fight a total war in your own home, then everything gets destroyed.\nIt\u2019s -- it\u2019s under -- you cannot describe it. Unless you have seen it and lived through it, you -- you\ncannot imagine what it is to be in a city, no light, no streetlight, th-the sidewalks was fu-full of\nsha -- garbage from the bombing, from the walls. You can\u2019t believe it. And they had to clean up\nthemselves, the Americans were not there to clean up the rubble for them. They had to clean it or\nelse it would still be laying.",
        "Q: So you were working for the military government in Ochsenfurt?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And did you get assigned to go back to your town?",
        "A: Yeah, I had a Jeep there, I was allowed to go anyplace I wanted to.",
        "Q: So how did you get to the point where you went back to arrest people?",
        "A: Well, wa -- after I worked there for awhile, I figured it was time to -- to look for these\nfellows. And I inquired, I had a German policeman who helped me get the names together, and\nthen I had the names of about 10 or 12 of them. And I decided it\u2019s time for me to pick them up\nand put them in the jail, and I did.",
        "Q: How did you do this, on what -- did you have some orders that allowed you to do this, cause -",
        "A: I cou -- I -- I couldn\u2019t do it as an -- I could do it as an American soldier, but they didn\u2019t\ncommit a crime against the Amer-merican soldier, they committed a crime about civilian --\nagainst civilian people. So I was allowed to arrest them and put them into jail. But then it was\nsupposed to be that the Germans take over, but there were no Germans in office yet to do that. So\nwhen I left -- when I re -- was ready to go into a hospital to -- not to have to go to Austria, I let\nthem sit in the jail, but the captain finally got their confessions and he had to do something about\nthem, so he -- he kept the confessions and he let them out to go home. And I haven\u2019t heard from\nit since, except when this fellow wrote the book 20 or 30 years later, he got from the court the\npapers what happened to them in 1948.",
        "Q: How did you find them? Were they all living there in that town?",
        "A: They were all living there. There were some of them that ha -- that were fighting in the war in\nRussia and hadn\u2019t come back, but the ones I found were all living there.",
        "Q: And -- and did you confront them personally?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t arrest them, I tra -- I made the German police arrest them and put them into jail. And\nthen first I had to change the warden 1n jail because he was a Nazi, I couldn\u2019t trust him. So I had\nto kick him out and put a new man in. Otherwise, he would have let them go anyhow.",
        "Q: And did you just stay in your town for --",
        "A: I stayed in the town. And then I -- I visited a fr -- another friend of mine in my village. I had\nvisited him ri-right after I got there and a little later after I arrested them, I paid him a visit and he\nwarned me. He said, be careful, they\u2019re after you. So I -- I got the message that they were ready\nto do something to me, so I changed my habits. I stayed in at night, I put a German police in\nfront of the entrance, and I didn\u2019t let anybody come in without knowing who they are. I was\nvery, very careful, because I had a good warning. And if they want to do away with you, they\nhad the power and the weapon to do it. So I was very careful, because my life was important to\nme at that stage.",
        "Q: How long did it take you to get all of these men rounded up, arrested?",
        "A: Oh that -- that was a few hours, that\u2019s --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Really. That was nothing, that was within -- I think they were -- they marched them down to\nthe prison. I don\u2019t think we supplied a Jeep or anything. Only the one guy I arrested in my\nvillage, him I put on a Jeep because it was four or five kilometer to the -- to the jail.",
        "Q: So it took you weeks to find everybody, 1s that why you were there that long?",
        "A: No, I took my time. I -- I -- I took my time. I figured that they can\u2019t run away, and it took me\nawhile to decide, and I -- I didn\u2019t tell the captain when I was doing it, because he might have\nstopped me, I don\u2019t know. There was certain things you had to do on your own, because when\nyou asked too many questions, you get too many answers and too many problems.",
        "Q: So they were all -- they were all arrested on the same day?",
        "A: Yeah. They were all arrested within an -- two hours, all of them.",
        "Q: And where were you at that time?",
        "A: I was in my office.",
        "Q: You knew what was going on at that moment?",
        "A: I knew what was going on, yeah. And I went right away to the -- to the man in charge of the\njail, I said no visitors, no nothing. They get 15 minutes to walk in the courtyard in the afternoon\nand that\u2019s it. I said, no packages in, no packages out, I gave him strict instructions, the way we\nwere treated a few years before. I -- I was the boss.",
        "Q: And how were -- did you feel good about that?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Were you feeling good about that?",
        "A: Yes, I was feeling good about that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The Americans would have never arrested them. I felt very good about that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I -- I feel this is th-the golden opportunity.",
        "Q: And did -- did people in the town respond in any way? Other people in the town?",
        "A: Well, th-the people in the -- the relatives came to my office. I didn\u2019t let them in, but they all\ntried lo, he wasn\u2019t so bad, let him home. I said -- I didn\u2019t ackn -- I ignored everything. I didn\u2019t\nlisten to anybody. I felt, let them know I\u2019m the boss. It\u2019s -- it was good feeling.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: A-And for what I went through, I deserved to be -- to -- to show them where the bo -- who the\nboss is. They never expected this to happen.",
        "Q: By that time were there any Jews left in your village?",
        "A: No, no Jews came back from my village. There were some Jews 1-1n the big city, Wurzburg,\nwho had come back, whom I knew from before, and I helped them, I went there at night\nsometimes to bring them some food or something. I bought hundred pounds of flo -- white flour\nfrom a mill to bring to them so they could bake some cakes and so on. That was a different life,\nthat was not -- not part of my mission, that was human -- humanitarian.",
        "Q: And by this time, in the summer of 1945, people knew about the concentration camps --",
        "A: Oh yes, by that time they were --",
        "Q: -- all of that was public information by that time.",
        "A: -- they were already opened and overrun and publicized. Oh yeah, they knew. In April they\noverran the first concentration camp. I never -- one of the officers said to me, I want to go to\nMunich and pass the concentration camp. I says, I was in there once, I don\u2019t want to see it. Th-\nThey wanted me to -- to drive with them I ref -- I refused, I just didn\u2019t need it -- necessary to go\nback. Another guy, he says -- 0-oh, one guy says, I need a ca -- every officer\u2019s supposed to have\na German car for the weekends when they went socializing. So he says, can you find me a car? I\nsays, give me a little time, I\u2019ll find you a car. I snooped around and I found a beautiful red\nMercedes in a vil -- in a town, covered with straw, was hidden away. So I told him, we pulled it\nout. The roof had collapsed for over the years with the weight, so I told him I have a mechanic in\nmy village, he can fix it. And we put a battery in, we drove the car out and fixed it, and then\nwhen the car was fixed he says to me, I\u2019m going to make the first trip to Garmisch where Hitler\u2019s\nheadquarters was. You want to come with me? I said no thank you. [laughs]. I -- I went to\nNuremberg to pick up my friend Raul whose letter is in your book.",
        "Q: When -- when those 11 men we-were priso -- imprisoned in your village, what happened to\nthem after --",
        "A: They ca -- th --",
        "Q: -- ho-how long did you stay there?",
        "A: The captain let them go. He didn\u2019t have charges against them, he -- they didn\u2019t do anything\nthe Americans. So he let them go but the papers must have gone to court that they were tried in\n1948, which is about three years later. By that time I guess the Americans had built up the\nGerman court system enough to handle something like this.",
        "Q: Waha -- when he let them go, how did you respond to that?",
        "A: Wa -- who --",
        "Q: When he let them go?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t ask me, I was gone. I was on my way home.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t ask me, he didn\u2019t have to ask me, he could do what he wanted. Bi -- I -- y-you\n[indecipherable] when he sent me to the hospital to get quinine tablets, and I played dumb. I\nsays, I need a -- a -- a -- a -- a piece of paper telling me to get this, so he signed it for me, and\nyou know what happened to the quinine tablets.",
        "Q: Well, I know because I read the book but you should tell the story. You need to tell the story\nfor the tape.",
        "A: Yeah, ta -- th-the -- the nun in charge gave me the tablets and she explained to me how they\nshould be used. The -- the girl should sit -- the -- the girl had to be pregnant to take them. She\nshould sit in a bathtub with a few inches of water, and practice like riding a bicycle before -- and\ntake the tablets before, and that might help to have like an abortion. So I gave it to him with the\ninstructions from the nun. But I had it in writing.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s an indication to you of what kind of men these were, these military government\nofficers were.",
        "A: Yeah, they didn\u2019t care.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They -- they weren\u2019t allowed to fraternize with German women. It was still forbidden.\nEisenhower had three months where no one was allowed to touch German women, so they\ncarried Holland women with them when they came from Holland to Germany, so they were not\nin bru -- had no problems.",
        "Q: And the women just stayed with them in their quarters?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: The women just stayed with them in their quarters?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know where they put them up, I didn\u2019t look at -- I didn\u2019t check, it didn\u2019t bother me.\nThey must have put them up someplace.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But they carried their own women from a different country, so they couldn\u2019t be brought up on\ncharges. There was ways of doing things.",
        "Q: So when you left Germany, you thought those men were all in prison. They were in prison\nthen?",
        "A: When I left Germany, them -- I think they were still in prison, yeah, yeah. And I couldn\u2019t care\nless, I didn\u2019t want to stay around and wait til the German court system was strong enough to take\ncare of everything. But th-the -- the papers I made him sign, he must have kept on his desk and\neventually give them to the German court system.",
        "Q: You made all of those men sign confessions?",
        "A: Each one I made sign a confession what he did the night of Kristallnacht. Yeah, I made the --\nI did that.",
        "Q: And was one of those 11 men wi -- had one of those people come to your parent\u2019s house?",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: While I was visiting a good German, and -- who was happy to see me, and he went into a\nroom and he came out with a little suitcase. And he said, I got something for you. He handed me\nthis and this. These were -- these were items that were used in the synagogue. This is for the\nwine cup, and this is a spice box with a candle on it that was used Saturday night to end the\nSabbath.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Let me have this paper, let me have this paper. You hold that up a little bit, hold that\nup a little bit. Little higher. Can you hold it up higher? There you go. That\u2019s okay, this is okay.\nOkay. And he gave those to you? And he had saved them? Where did he --",
        "A: He had saved it. I don\u2019t know how he got. And with it was an old book, 300 years old, a\nmemorial book from the congregation. That he gave me also, it was three items, and I treasured\nthem. I treasured them because I felt that was worth the honor to bring them home. And I did\nbring them home, and of course I showed them to my father and 1-1-it wa -- it was heartwarming\nto -- to see -- to get something like this. And I -- I w -- never would want to give it away because\nI felt I deserved it. To make the trip and spend two, three years in hell, I mean at least I deserve\nthis, and I -- it should go into a museum, but I feel I let my daughters decide what they want to\ndo with it. I will not give it away. I cleaned it, I polished it. This is silver, this 1s I don\u2019t know,\nbut --",
        "Q: And when you brought those back -- when you came back and you went to see your parents,\ndid you go straight to see your parents?",
        "A: No, I came back on a hospital ship and I was put in a hospital on Staten Island. They were --\nall the patients went there, it was called Halloran General Hospital. And after being in there a\nday they tell you you can go home for 30 days. So they gave me a 30 day pass, that\u2019s when I\nwent home and so -- start seeing people.",
        "Q: And when you went back home, were you able to tell stories right away or did you not want\nto talk?",
        "A: Well, it was emotional. You didn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t talk, everything was -- too much happened\nin four years. In order to split out everything, and I was very slow, and you -- you were not\nyourself yet, you had to calm down slowly. And th -- all of a sudden you wanted to see ma --\nmore people that you knew, and you were proud that you came back. And so it didn\u2019t -- it didn\u2019t\ngo that easy. It was very emotional, but I made it.",
        "Q: Were you eventually able to tell your father and mother what you had done, and --",
        "A: Yeah, eventually I was able to tell them, slowly. But I already had told -- I already had told\nthem a lot in letters, because after the war ended, I was able to write home in German. And I\ncould write every night or something and s -- tell them what has happened and so on. So they\nknew a lot more already from my letters.",
        "Q: And before the -- while the war was still going on you couldn\u2019t write letters that --",
        "A: You c -- they couldn\u2019t read English, so I -- that was no s -- a -- a -- I couldn\u2019t write in German\nbecause it had to go through a censor. So I couldn\u2019t communicate the way you normally\ncommunicate. That only opened up when the war ended. Next day was no more censor. That\nwent for the news reporters also.",
        "Q: Yeah. Okay, we need to change tapes.\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",

        "Q: -- they\u2019ve got everything, but they -- goodness knows who can find it.",
        "A: But you understand what I mean? That book 1s also very valuable.",
        "Q: Yeah. So you came back -- you came back in the fall of 1945?",
        "A: Yeah, but when I came back --",
        "Q: You\u2019d been in the service --",
        "A: -- I came back it was, I think December \u201945 and I had a 30 day fa -- furlough and then I had to\ngo back to the hospital and they decided I was suffering -- besides the hearing I was suffering\nfrom arthritis for sleeping eight, nine months on the wet ground and the doctor had diagnosed it\nand they flew me to Hot Springs, Arkansas for 30 days to take the hot bath. Hot Springs,\nArkansas was the spa for polio people, and the army, navy had a big general hospital there and\nthey went -- I went there for 30 days to take the bath and it cured me of the arthritis. And after\nthat they tent -- they -- they tried to get rid of me to sign out, I said no, I want to help -- I need\nsome help with my hearing. And they sent me to a hospital in oklaho -- in Oklahoma, called\nBorden General Hospital, which was for -- for n-nose, eyes and ears. And over there they looked\nat me, they can\u2019t help much. I said, yeah, but I\u2019m here. So they also wanted to discharge me. I\nsays, I\u2019m not taking a discharge unless you give me a medical discharge. Nothing doing. So a\nweek later, some young doctor from Saint Louis, fellow looked like 30 years old, one night says\nto me, tomorrow morning if you come to this room they\u2019Il be a board meeting and I can get you\nyour medical discharge. I said, Dr., it\u2019s a deal. So I got dressed my uniform, and I appeared and\nthey passed it that I got a medical discharge. I wanted a medical discharge because I didn\u2019t want\nto go to Korea, I didn\u2019t want to go to Vietnam. So with a medical discharge I was safe.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I figured I\u2019d put in enough time. So that\u2019s how I happened, and that\u2019s when a few -- a year or\ntwo later they gave me a 10 percent pension for the hearing. Which 1s -- I didn\u2019t fight, I just took\nit and left them alone. Now y -- now you know the story.",
        "Q: Yeah. And I know it\u2019s hard to -- and that was -- that was 1945 - \u201946, early 1946, and you\nknow, here we are now 60 years later.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you\u2019ve just written this book about your experience. But I know that you\u2019ve also been\nback to your hometown a couple of times.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: And during one of those visits you were asked to speak to the gathered people.",
        "A: Yes, they -- they rebuilt the synagogue to -- like a museum and they dedicated it and they\ninvited us to come and partake at the ceremony.",
        "Q: Who was invited?",
        "A: Me, my brothers from Israel, my brothers from Baltimore. They invited all the people they\ncould find who -- who were related to the village one time. So we went there and that was\nalready -- the guy who wrote the book about the history, he already had finished the book. And a\ncouple of -- a week or two before, they celebrated the dedication of his book.",
        "Q: This is the book about the Jews from --",
        "A: Yeah, Jews in the village, so I was -- I was invited to that celebration and this fellow had quite\na few students from the university come, and a couple of professors, was a little affair. And so I\nstayed for the other celebration and I found out they didn\u2019t invite me to say anything. So I-I got\nupset and I had a conference with this author of his book, what I could do. And he wasn\u2019t invited\nto say anything either, so he says, put your foot down just before and tell Dr. so and so, if he\ndoesn\u2019t give you a chance, you\u2019re going to boycott the affair. And I did, and he said, we allow\nyou to say something. That\u2019s when I stood up and dashed it out to them in German and in\nEnglish. And they didn\u2019t like it.",
        "Q: Can you summarize for me what you said that day?",
        "A: Y-Yes. I said, th-the people you destroyed suffered in the worst way possible. None of you\nstood up to help them. I -- I -- I -- I really dished it out very strongly. And there were a couple of\nnews reporters, they shook my hands afterwards and congratulated me. The people didn\u2019t like it.\nWa -- the priest sent me a letter afterwards, how dare I was to accuse his people of something\nthey had nothing to do with. I -- I told him, they were there and they could have helped people.\nAnd that was it.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: And as a matter of fact, the -- the Germans were in a building and had machines going to\nrecord it. And the Americans, NBC was there to record it and the Americans gave me -- the NBC\ngave me the tapes to take home when I flew home a week or so later. And they told me, when\nyou go through the airport, try not to go through the machines, it might destroy them. So I passed\nthe tapes outside and when I got to New York I delivered them to NBC. About 10 years later the\ngirl from the German station is -- called me in and she says, I got those tapes. I said, I'll take\nthem. But I couldn\u2019t play them, their system was different from the American system. So I\nbrought them home, three or four tapes, cassettes like yours, and about, I guess eight or 10 years\nago, when I got busy with working at Leo Beck, I told them I got some tapes. They\u2019re -- they\u2019re\nvery strong, I -- I gave it to them. I would have loved to listen to them, but they never invited me\ndown and I never reminded them, but they have them.",
        "Q: Leo Beck Institute.",
        "A: Leo Beck Institute, because they wanted the history of the German speaking Jews who were\nchased out of Germany. We keep that Leo Beck going. And it is a very historic documents they\nhave. I gave them a lot of stuff. They wanted old letters, old photographs, everything. They take\nwhatever I could give them. That\u2019s how they exist. And so now -- now that\u2019s your competition.\nYou -- you are -- your museum is only what, 15 years old? I know that, I know. Wh-When it was\nfirst opened, my army outfit had a reunion in Virginia, not far from the museum, and before the\nreunion I wrote the boys from the fourth division who run the reunion, I said, the museum 1s\nopened. I\u2019d like for you to get 50 tickets for us to go and see it. And they wrote and they got 50\ntickets.",
        "Q: Great.",
        "A: So come Saturday morning, a couple of officers I knew, friends from Colonel Reider, they\ncornered me. We want you to take us to the museum. I said, all right, I want to go too, so we go\ntogether. I think we rode the subway over. And going in, you had to go up to the fourth floor and\nwork your way down. So they see a -- a big window with shoes and they ask me, what does this\nmean\u2019? Yo-You understand what I mean? They were Christians who had no idea what went on in\nthe camps or anyplace. So I spent three hours with them, going through the museum. I was new\nmyself, I mean, I knew the rail trucks up on the shelf -- you understand what I mean? But I\ndevoted my time to them. And they thanked me and we went back to the hotel and ate lunch. So\nnow -- so now you know.",
        "Q: Yeah, well, can I ask you to --",
        "A: It was -- that was I -- an early vis -- an early visitor in the museum, unknown --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- if you know what I mean.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But these fellows had no idea. They were not o-openly received, there was no one to explain\nto them. And I didn\u2019t know the museum that well, I only knew from what I read and what I saw.",
        "Q: Oh. When you came back -- when you were back in the States and -- and you were here in\nNew York and you had a business and you were starting to -- you got married and you had a --\nraised a family here. Did you study a lot about the Holocaust?",
        "A: No, no --",
        "Q: I know that in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s --",
        "A: -- I didn\u2019t have time --",
        "Q: -- people didn\u2019t talk much about it.",
        "A: -- I -- I needed all my energy to b -- run and build my business. That was important to me, I\nwanted to be successful and I devoted [indecipherable] in my life to the business, until I was a\nlittle -- I was more affluent when I was about 65, and then I started traveling. My business was\nslow from December 15\" to January fifth. The hospitals had parties and they had no room for me\nand I was able to go to Switzerland for a week, or go to Israel to visit my brother. And that\u2019s\nwhen I developed socially, if you know what I mean. But during the early years in life, you did\nnot recall the Holocaust so much. You did not recall what you did, you didn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t even\nfeel like talking about it sometimes.",
        "Q: But you -- you attended synagogue, your raised your children to be religious?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And among your friends was there much talk --",
        "A: Well, you --",
        "Q: -- or were you one of those people who didn\u2019t want to talk but other people did?",
        "A: I -- I didn\u2019t try to talk because like -- like I told you, Colonel Reider said, I -- I -- I is not the\nword. Yo-You understand?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I was very reluctant to speak about it. I slowly explained something to my children. I -- I\ndid go to army reunions once a year, and when I walked in the hotel -- I usually went Friday\nmornings or Sunday afternoon. And when I walked in the boys looked at me, here comes Dr.\nKissinger. And I said, but I\u2019m not playing with the same girls he\u2019s playing with. It must have\nbeen the accent that they got reminded.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, in those days he was famous.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So the boys always reminded me, here comes Dr. Kissinger.",
        "Q: During those years, did it ever surprise you how little people knew about Jews in Germany\u2019?",
        "A: How many people?",
        "Q: How little people knew about it.",
        "A: I think they all knew a little. I think they all knew. They didn\u2019t want to admit to it that they --\nthey played holy, holy, holy, as innocent. That goes for the -- for the Pope in Rome and all the\nCardinals and all the Bishops. If they didn\u2019t know they were not human beings. They must have\nknown what went on but they were scared and they didn\u2019t do anything about it. Th-th-the Pope\nsu-supported the criminals and sent them to South America to save their lives. I want to know --\nI want to send my b -- the Pope is coming next week to Washington, did you know that?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He\u2019s get -- being wined and dined at the White House. I want to find a way to send him my\nbook. I -- I even called last night my friend who runs Der Speigel. I want to know if he as a news\nreporter 1s invited somewhere where he can hand him my book. He is a friend of mine, he was\nhere for a day to -- to tape me.",
        "Q: And when -- when was it that you started to get interested in writing a book, and why did you\nwant to write a book?",
        "A: Well, the -- why? Well, I -- fr-from what my daughters tell me, I was loaded with\ninformation. I -- I was a -- a walking library, they used to say, which was true. I observed and I\nobserved, and I didn\u2019t write it down, but I kept it. And they -- they started hinting me why I don\u2019t\nwrite things down and one led to the other and sooner or later I gave in. But they helped me to\nhire the right woman. Because before I hired her, I became very friendly with a German consul\nwho was stationed in New York, consul number two. And he was already two years in Israel and\nwe became very friendly. So -- and the wife was a -- a -- a newspaper woman. And I -- a -- she\ninvited me to her house for dinner one time, and she lived on -- on the West Side on 66\" Street.\nAnd we sat down and I said to her, how about you writing my book? She thinks about it, she\nsays, well -- I must have approached her before because that night I -- I si -- offered her 10,000\ndollars if she would write it for me. Speaks German, speaks English. Educated woman. She says\nno, I\u2019m going back to Germany. She wa -- they were transferred back to Berlin and she says even\nthough she was -- quality was there, if you know what I mean, and she was very warm and she\nwas like you, born after the war, had no -- no -- nothing to do with anybody, you know, but she\nrefused me. I couldn\u2019t do anything about it, but that\u2019s when I tried, because I felt she was\nqualified. Even if she was back in Berlin she could do it. But then my daughter found this one by\naccident. And she came and she sat there and after two hours she says, I\u2019ll take the job. And I\nsaid, send me a contract.",
        "Q: So then you started writing and collecting --",
        "A: I already started writing --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- s-stories, three pages, four pages and I started giving -- feeding her with typed stories.",
        "Q: Hm, and when you -- when you finished writing, or when you had it all collected, did you\nunderstand anything about yourself or about your experience that you hadn\u2019t understood before?\nDid you gain some perspective that you didn\u2019t have before?",
        "A: Did -- did I do what?",
        "Q: When you finished writing it --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- did you -- were you able to look at your experience in a different way? Did you gain some\nnew knowledge by writing it down?",
        "A: Well, I -- no, I wracked my head to get the old stories together as -- as good as possible, and\nshe trimmed them, and she made questions to add. She knew how to handle it, and I was very\nsatisfied. I -- now I feel there\u2019s three, four more stories should have been in, but there was a time\nlimit, when she said enough is enough, we\u2019re going to finish it the way it is. And that\u2019s when I\ngave you that big book.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: She used that, I think. She must have sent it to the publisher or something.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I felt it was a good book, but when the letters came in and people come and -- and the\nmost unusual, there\u2019s some Germans here in New York [indecipherable] and other people who\ngot hold of the book and they came and they admired it. And when I sent a draft to the consul\nbecause I -- I wanted opinions, 1f you understand what I mean, so the consul came back to\nAmerica for four years to -- to Houston, Texas, and once -- first time he was here he came to\nNew York, we had lunch together and I sent him a draft. And he said it\u2019s beautiful. He says, the\nnicest part is the way you carried yourself when you went back into your home village. So\neverybody picks something different that shakes him. So I felt good to get an opinion like that, if\nyou -- you understand. Because the German opinion to me is worth also, and they should be\nheard now, because this is a different generation two generations away from the Nazis. And --\nand they -- they -- they claim it could never happen again, they say. We don\u2019t know. There\u2019s still\nanti-Semitism in Germany today and there\u2019s a new group coming up. I got, month ago, a German\nmagazine called Deutsche [indecipherable]. How did I get it? I have a friend in New Jersey, he\u2019s\nlike me, he\u2019s practically the same age. And some of his friends in Germany sent him the\nmagazine and he went through the magazine and in it he found an article about me, in the\nmagazine, in German. So I read it, and I -- I started -- I told my bankers friend from Germany\nand one of them said, oh I know the magazine, that\u2019s on the right side. They are not mine -- they\nare not broadminded like we are. So I already know what he meant. He said, they are not leftists,\nthey are rightists. So -- but it -- the article is from the wall str -- not the Wall Street there, from\nthe New York Times. They -- they practically copied it. And I called the guy who wrote the\narticle, he says only the Times can sue him for copyright. I didn\u2019t write to the Times. But it\nshows you what goes on and to me, for the Germans, it\u2019s important that they read what goes on.\nTh-They wouldn\u2019t buy this book if a German wrote it, 1-1f you know what I mean.",
        "Q: No, explain that. Why is that?",
        "A: Because they feel that he was on D-Day, he\u2019s an American, he knows what he is talking\nabout. I feel that\u2019s why they want to buy it. The ber -- Bavarian government\u2019s supposed to buy it\nand put it in some of their libraries. A woman I spoke to but so far she hasn\u2019t cal-called me and t\n-- how many copies she wants. But for th -- for them it\u2019s important to -- to have the relations\nwarm up again. They invited me, they dedi -- dedicated the Jewish museum in Nuremberg, 1987\nthey invited me and sent me books and everything. And so they -- they recognize that they need\nus to help them, if you understand what I mean. The -- the -- the -- the people -- the Bavarian\ngovernment, about six, eight months ago, wrote me -- I wrote to them, they wrote me a letter\nback and they sent me a booklet about Dachau. All th-the pictures, everything about Dachau. I --\nI got excited and I said to myself, I\u2019m not keeping this in my house, I don\u2019t want my daughters to\nsee it. I took it to the local congressman and told him he can put it in any library he wants, I don\u2019t\nwant to see it. Now, he refuses to give me a receipt for it that I can take a tax deduction. I also\ngave him a copy of my book.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you -- why didn\u2019t you want your daughters to see that book? They know what you",
        "A: I -- I felt -- 1t excited me so much, they shouldn\u2019t see it, what I went through.",
        "Q: But they know?",
        "A: No, I didn't tell them that I got that book.",
        "Q: But do they know what you went through?",
        "A: Well, they know I was in concentration camp.",
        "Q: But that\u2019s all?",
        "A: That\u2019s all, yeah. But that book described to -- the meat hooks, everything. Shows you\neverything in the place, and I just couldn\u2019t take it. That\u2019s how I felt. I -- 1f you want the book I\ngive you the address in Germany where you can a -- write for a copy.",
        "Q: Well, I\u2019m curious about your experience.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting to me about your experience with that book.",
        "A: Yeah. But I couldn\u2019t stomach it.",
        "Q: Because it brought back memories? Were those things you knew about?",
        "A: Too -- too many memories. Wh-When you see the barracks and everything, I couldn\u2019t take it.\nI didn\u2019t want to keep it in my house, not even a week. So I\u2019m telling you the truth.",
        "Q: You wrote a long book, but is there a lot that you left out?",
        "A: Is there long --",
        "Q: Is there a lot that you left out of your book?",
        "A: There is enough for another book, but I\u2019m not ready for one. I feel that there\u2019s some -- some\ngood stories that only wake up after the book was out, if you know what I mean. But it -- it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s not that important that I write it down. I wrote up enough the important parts. Like now I\nhave to do work with the lady whose letter I showed you. I could put in more in her book if I\nwanted to. Th-That will be an important book, if you know what -- I feel that she might give me\nhalf of the book if I let her.",
        "Q: Maybe.",
        "A: I might need your help.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. [indecipherable]",
        "A: She would love -- I think she would love to sit in here.\nQ2: [indecipherable] minutes left on this tape.",
        "A: Do you hear what I said?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I would like -- I think she would love to sit here and watch us.",
        "Q: And listen, yeah, maybe. Maybe. We\u2019re going to stop now and do the photographs.\nQ2: And, anytime.",
        "Q: Okay, this is our first photograph. Can you tell me who is in this picture?",
        "A: My oldest brother Siegfried, my --",
        "Q: Don\u2019t -- can you not use your hand?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. Just -- okay.",
        "A: My -- the second brother, Theo, I\u2019m on the right side. Left one is my younger brother and\nthat\u2019s a sir -- the sister.",
        "Q: And you look to be what, about 10 years old here?",
        "A: No, about eight, seven.",
        "Q: So this would have been around what year?",
        "A: Oh, ninet -- born 1919, about 1927, I would say.",
        "Q: And where do you think this photograph was taken?",
        "A: In front of the house.",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: That\u2019s yi -- that\u2019s where phot -- the photographer came.",
        "Q: You all have -- look pretty nice there, pretty nice, pretty happy.",
        "A: It look -- it looks antique, yeah.",
        "Q: Pretty happy kids.",
        "A: Yous -- you see, they look like -- what can I say, like uniforms a little bit.",
        "Q: Okay.\nQ2: It\u2019s a -- let me -- yeah, we have to put a little tape on. And, anytime.",
        "Q: Okay. Who is this fellow?",
        "A: That\u2019s my father. That must have been when he came home from the war.",
        "Q: Can --",
        "A: Maybe during the war, World War I.",
        "Q: Can you tell me his full name?",
        "A: It\u2019s also in front of the house, because we had two or three steps going up to get into the\nhouse.",
        "Q: Can you tell me his name?",
        "A: Louie Kleeman.",
        "Q: Louie?",
        "A: Louie, yeah. He was born 1882.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay, next one.",
        "A: This is Werner Kleeman, immediately after release from Dachau. You see the haircut, which\nwas this [indecipherable] the -- the identification that you were a prisoner in a concentration\ncamp.",
        "Q: Because people wouldn\u2019t have worn their hair like that?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t hav -- never wore hair like that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Not -- not even in the American army. They also wanted it short, but not that short.",
        "Q: And do you remember where this was taken?",
        "A: Right -- probably in Ochsenfurt where the passport was made out, because we did not have a\nphotographer in the village, so I -- it ha -- I\u2019m sure it had to be taken there.",
        "Q: Okay.\nQ2: You know, we need to change tapes.",
        "Q: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This is the p -- the p -- the passport that I got after being released from the concentration camp\nin order to leave Germany. The -- the man who signed it, who had the power, was very\nmiserable, and he looked for all kinds of excuses not to give it to you, even though the consul\nhad written that they want me to appear with a passport. When I came back and was stationed in\nthe town, I sent people up to tr -- and I needed a bed to sleep in, and had them remove his own\nbed to bring to my new quarters in Ochsenfurt. I didn\u2019t care if he slept on the floor or not, but I\nfixed him up then.",
        "Q: And describe what 1 -- the red --",
        "A: The K is that you\u2019re a Jew. The red K, they put that in every passport so you couldn\u2019t say\nyou\u2019re -- it\u2019s not yours. That was only done -- about 1938 they started to issue a red K into every\nJewish passport.",
        "Q: And your name?",
        "A: My name is Kleeman, and they add -- added Israel to every Jew, that was an -- a state | -- a\nstate law, so you couldn\u2019t sneak out an-and not be identified as a Jew.",
        "Q: Hm. Okay.\nQ2: All right, any time.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This is the house, it used to be called a castle. I believe it was built 1717. It had a weapon at\nthe front entrance and it was originally surrounded by water. There were a couple of little\nstreams going around the building, and they -- the village bought it from my father for a very low\nprice. They wanted to put the schoolhouse -- a school in there. And then the war started, they\ndidn\u2019t do anything with it except they rented out the rooms. And then, after awhile, they used it\nto put in 50 French pe -- Frenchmen who were forced to work on the farms. And they were\nlocked in at eight o\u2019clock at night and the gendarme came in the morning to open it up to go to\nwork. They were very badly treated by the farmers and I don\u2019t know what they did when they\nwere free, but from what I understand they killed a couple of pigs and started to live up a little\nbit.",
        "Q: Hm. And this is the house that the Nazis came to on Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Yea, this is the house they came, they destroyed every window, every closet, every bed was\nslice -- slit open. That was completely in shambles.",
        "Q: And do you know when this picture was taken, this photograph?",
        "A: No, this was right after the war. It looks very dilapidated and it must have been taken after the\nwar ended, I don\u2019t know. Maybe I took it, because I had a camera with me sometimes. It\u2019s very\npossible that I took this picture myself.",
        "Q: Okay. Did this house have a name?",
        "A: No, no --",

        "A: It was a castle, yeah, and the walls were thick tha -- you couldn\u2019t do anything. All brick --\nheavy stone, no brick, no veneer. Everything was heavy. And the windows were big and it was a\nvery strong house. And there were 16 smaller homes around it and some of them fell apart, but\nthe Germans rebuild them the way they were hundred years ago, and the people are living in\nthem now.",
        "Q: Did you have your own room in this house?",
        "A: Yes, I had my own room in the house. The upstairs was no heat. It was cold in the winter with\none big stove downstairs in the living room and one bedroom, and the kitchen had the stove to\ncook on. It was not the most comfortable house.",

        "A: This is Colonel Gaitling, we became very good friends. This was in a rough time of the\nwinter, I can see the boots he was wearing. They were hard to get by, but it probably was in\nHuertgen forest, it looks like all -- all trees around it. He was a gentleman and very human and\nvery kind and very considerate. I never forget that we -- we broke out of Normandy and we hit\nthe first French town and there was a little restaurant on the side, and he sent me in to buy a\nlunch. He was outside on the bench and ate a K-ration. And when I got inside I found my friend\nSalinger and John Keenan sitting at the counter eating already, so I joined them. We were at\nhome, we were cle -- happy together. This colonel was a very outstanding soldier. He -- he\ngraduated from the Virginia Military Institute, which is as good as West Point. Then he\ngraduated Columbia Law School and he was working for a big law firm, a [indecipherable] law\nfirm on broad -- on Wall Street in New York. He never told us where he was working. The boss\nat the Wall Street firm became Secretary of the Army under President Franklin Roosevelt. With\none letter he could have been sitting in Washington for the duration, but he was too much of a\nsoldier to let anybody know who he was. He st -- he was British descent, and he was very, very\nwarm with you. You couldn\u2019t help it but respect him. The first or second night in France, he\nwent on a -- he went to visit Sainte M\u00e9re Eglise, the first [indecipherable] where the paratroopers\nhad dropped in, and while he was gone, I started t-to dig a foxhole for him, I was finished\ndigging mine. And when he came back midnight, he scolded me because he doesn\u2019t allow me to\nbig -- dig a foxhole for him, he\u2019s digging his own foxholes. So I apologized and I said, next time\nI know. He was very, very considerate. He want to make sure you eat and you clean and\neverything that needed for you to be care of. He never cared about anything special in his\nuniform. He wore the same clothes we were wearing, and every time we got into a new\ncommand post what [indecipherable] being called, he walked around and looked if there was a\nlittle stream. When he found one, he found a -- a private corner, he took his uniform off and gave\nhimself a -- a bath in the ice cold water. I couldn\u2019t have done that, but he did every time we hit a\nnew som -- CP. He was very articulate and he was very easy and warm to be with. Fortunately, I\nwas able to contact him after the war. When I bought my house, I approached him and he ba --\nhe made the contract and title for me. He hardly took any money. And then, of course, we were -\n- became friends. We stayed together til he passed away in 1980-something. I went to his house\nthree, four times a year for dinner. We had wonderful times together. And I went down to the\nWall Street firm and we had lunch together. It was an unusual friendship and we always find\nsomething to discuss and -- and -- and -- and enlighten us about things what have happened. One\nof the big things that happened was in my -- when I was in a K company, 22\" infantry, there was\na big fuss, to-do, north against south. The southern boys, the hillbillies accused a couple of\nnorthern fellows for not leading a normal life, sexually. And they accused them, and the -- the\ncompany commander was brainwashed by those fellows, and he more or less listened to them.\nSo he -- he took the accused fellow and put him into a stockade, and started bringing charges.\nAnother sergeant whom I knew very well, of -- a very good friend of mine who was supply\nsergeant, he was a friend of the accused and he went to another regiment to find a lawyer to sup -\n- to s -- defend this fellow. So he went to the 12\" regiment and found Colonel Gaitling. He was\nthen a captain, I believe, but he was a lawyer and had th-the best of degrees. So Colonel Gaitling\ntook the case and they brought in a very g -- big court martial. They came down from corps to\nhandle it, they had armed guards around the building and everything. And when he did his\nresearch, he found a woman in Augusta who would swear and had the experience that she slept\nwith that fellow.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t want to mention his name, there may be relatives listening to it. And whenever I asked\nthe colonel to write this down for me because my language was not ready foras--a--as--a\ncase like this, he always told me, Kleeman, it is too spicy. I -- I reminded him every time I came\nto his house to please write it down for me, and he said it\u2019s too spicy. He refused, he -- he kept a\ndiary of his life in the division and he did not write this accident into his diary. I -- I couldn\u2019t get\nangry at him, but he was just too much. He produced a woman at the court martial that testified\nshe slept with this fellow and the case was dismissed.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: The captain was sent out to Fort Benning as a punishment and the first sergeant was removed\nfrom the company, and there was a big shake-up in the regiment, because he knew how to handle\nit. He was a de-definite fine lawyer and he knew that this -- the fellow was not guilty.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: You can\u2019t believe what went on in the army. I told you many times I said, the -- the Caine\nMutiny was a case like this and they brought a film out of it, why can\u2019t you write it up? He says,\ntoo spicy. He never told his wife about it, he never told his son and daughter about it. I\u2019m the\nonly man who questioned him about this all the time. But I was not a -- I was not successful. I --\nI feel to this day it should have been publicized. Th-The -- the fellow eventually got a discharge\nand got home and everybody was fine. We got a new captain in the army, a young fellow, and\nhe\u2019s -- he\u2019s -- when he came in he says, I\u2019m a tough son-of-a-bitch, you boys better behave.\n[laughs]",

        "A: There\u2019s a [indecipherable] Theodore Roosevelt, he is the son of the first President Roosevelt.\nHe was 57 years old and didn\u2019t have to be in a war, but he insisted on being there. He was first\nserving in Africa and then he came back to England and they assigned him to help guide the\nFourth Division. He was a down to earth soldier who was in World War I already, and he was a\nregular fellow. He never wore unif -- leggings or anything like that. He did not want to show off\nthat he is anything different. He always walked with a cane and was a very unusual man. He\ninsisted on landing on the beach in -- in Normandy, or -- in the first hour to guide the boys. He\nfelt his presence there would stimulate them to go and march in -- into the country fast. So he\nwas there from the morning on and when them -- there\u2019s a gu -- fellow lawyer I know who wrote\na book about him, and in a letter home he wrote to his wife, I must have hiked 20 miles the first\nday up and down the beach to get the boys to move inland.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: For his work there he got the Congressional Medal of Honor, but he didn't live to see it\nbecause he died in Normandy of a heart attack about five or six weeks after the landing. His son\nwas the captain in the First Division and also landed on D-Day. And it was when the Utah beach\nwas hooked up with Omaha beach, the son came over to visit the father in the evening --\nafternoon about six o\u2019clock. And they spent two hours together and this must have excited the\nfather so much that within an hour he had a heart attack and passed away. A very s-sad story, but\nit so happened wi -- and about 10 - 12 years ago I got an invitation for a Kristallnacht celebration\nin Brooklyn and the invitation said, the German consul will be there, and re -- ru -- Teddy\nRoosevelt the fourth will be there. So I packed up my history books with him in it and my two\ndaughters and we traveled to Brooklyn and I met the fo -- the -- both the consul and this -- the --\nthe grandson.

So --",
        "Q: Say who his father was.",

At first he was commanding the\nAfrica corps, where he got beaten by the Americans and the British and then he took over the --\nthe -- the east -- the western defense, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Holland. That was all under\nhis command, and he tried to do whatever e-equipment and men he had available. At the -- he\nalways bragged that he is going to throw any invader back into the sea within 24 hours and we\nwere afraid he might have power. But they didn\u2019t give him enough troops to really defend that\ncoast, and Hitler had three or four Panther Divisions about a hundred miles away from the front,\nand he didn\u2019t release them the first or second day, and no general had the power to order them to\ncome to the beach. So what really happened, the German command failed to realize that the\nallies are -- are going to be there to stay, and that the -- the tanks from the German army were\nsitting in the mi-middle of France someplace and they couldn\u2019t move. When they did start\nmoving, the American Air Force came and put the hell out of them as they were traveling on a\nhighway. It was so bad that they gave up and only traveled at night. And they -- when they\nfinally reached the front, the Americans had enough anti-tank guns and everything to fight them.\nIt was Rommel that I wrote to, that is the reason why his father had no chance. As a matter of\nfact, when I -- when I got the book from the Gaitling family about the history of the 12\u2122 infantry\nregiment, I sent it to Rommel with the remark, if he reads this he\u2019s going to know why his father\ncould never win against the Americans.

Where the Jews were living the windows were slashed, the bedding was\nthrown out through the windows. It was a mass hysteria. So at five o\u2019clock he came out and we\ndecided -- he decided, he had his passport, he didn\u2019t have his ticket for the boat. He had bought\nit, but he didn\u2019t bring it to Stuttgart. And he went to the railroad station and bought a ticket to go\nto Basel in Switzerland. We had a relative living in Basel. So he cleared out and I checked out\nfrom the hotel and started to drive home.",
        "A: Five o\u2019clock in the afternoon --",
        "A: -- it was dark already, November. So I started to drive home and I got to -- to the -- a city\ncalled Wachmergenheim and I stopped, I saw -- I saw a public telephone and I called my father\nand he said, don\u2019t come home, they\u2019re coming here. In other words, he knew they were coming\nto start destroying whatever they wanted to destroy.",
        "A: The Germans, the Nazis, yeah. So I drove another 20 kilomed and I checked into a farmer I\nknew well for the night. I didn\u2019t want to go home and be part of that. So he le -- he let me stay wi\n-- in his home. I put the car inside the court, but in the morning, five o\u2019clock, he said he\u2019s got\nservants, he will feel better if I would leave because they might report him.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. No, no, he was not Jewish. He was a good Christian. So I left and I went to another\nvillage with another farmer whom I knew had no servants. And he let me stay til seven o\u2019clock.\nThen I had no more choice but go home. And I drove home and I found myself facing the\nworld\u2019s worst. The house -- the door was broken down, every window was broken, the house\nwas completely demolished. And before I knew it, one of the officers came and says, you\u2019re the\nre -- you are arrested and he took me to the gendarme to sit in his office til they had re -- ru -- re -\n- a way to transport me to the prison.",
        "A: My father was gone, my mother was in the house. That was all.",
        "A: She co -- she -- she was all broken down. Finally a neighbor came in and help with the -- ope\n-- to lift up some [indecipherable] and fix the house door a little, so she could close it. It was -- it\nwas the most miserable thing you could have ever experienced.",
        "A: She wasn\u2019t in no mood to even talk about it, because you saw with your own eyes, it was\nnothing but destruction. Every closet had been turned over, everything broken, I -- un-\nunbelievable. They were acting like criminals. And we knew them.",
        "A: Well, they came from the next town on a truck with wooden sticks to hit the people, and yeah,\nwe knew some of them. One -- one of them stood in front of my father and said, no-nothing can\nhappen to Mr. Kleeman. Because he was a -- he owned a -- a -- a [indecipherable] in a village\nthat my father used to go 1n once in awhile.",
        "A: That\u2019s what he said, but it was alright for him to beat up the other Jews.",
        "A: I was taken into the same prison and put into the room with my father.",
        "A: No, I was 18.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, 19.",
        "A: That was in Ochsenfurt, was f-five kilometer away, the next small town, which was the -- the\nregional office, like a county here.",
        "A: All the Jews that they had arrested in the whole county, they had put them into that prison.",
        "A: Yeah, you knew most of them, but you weren\u2019t able to talk to them. Each one was locked in\nthis room. They were allowed 15 minutes in the afternoon to walk around the courtyard, but you\ncouldn't talk to any one of them. They were s -- they were supervising.",
        "A: You knew nothing, because you had no -- you couldn\u2019t get a newspaper, you had no radio.\nYou knew nothing from day to day what would happen to you. Nobody knew anything. They\nfinally took some of the older people, like my father, World War I veteran, and let them go\nhome, discharged them. But not the younger ones.",
        "A: Well, after two weeks or so, they took us to another prison in a large city and there we were\nprocessed, pictures taken and fingerprinted and prepare to be shipped to the concentration camp.\nWe didn't know what was going on, but that was the rumor.",
        "A: Yes, it was known. There was Dachau, there was Buchenwald. They were prepared for this.\nThey were built up and were waiting for the big shipments of Jews. They brought them in from\nAustria, they brought them in from -- from all of Bavaria. Was filled up. They didn\u2019t care how\ncrowded it was, it was just -- they were the bosses. Was electric wire fence all around the place\nso you had no chance to escape, and so on.",
        "A: On the bus. They put you on -- there was -- they had four or five buses running, everyone\nfilled with people and lots of policemen. Took about five to six hours to te -- to -- the ride to\nDachau. You didn\u2019t even know where you were going, you just suspected it.",
        "A: In Dachau they started to cut your hair and process you, take your clothes away and give you\nthe minimum, like a pair of pajamas and a pair of fo -- shoes that didn\u2019t fit. You were stripped of\neverything you owned, and -- and thrown in with other prisoners. You didn\u2019t know what was\ngoing on. You were a -- practically, you didn\u2019t exist. You -- you -- if you got a bowl of soup for\nday -- for the day, you were lucky. And they made all the prisoners do the work for them. They\nonly made themselves as the -- as the guard, as the policemen. And they had vicious dogs and\neverything in the camp already. If you didn\u2019t behave they put the dog on you to tear you to\npieces. People died every day. In -- in the morning they loaded up the dead bodies and took them\nout someplace, we don\u2019t know where. But people were dying from heart attacks, from problems,\neverything. I-It was a shameful existence, you couldn't do anything about it.",
        "A: You -- no, there was no work. You had to stand around the parade ground and wait for them\nto tell you something. You -- you stood for six hours, eight hours, 10 hours a day in the cold\nweather. They didn\u2019t care.",
        "A: Not -- I didn\u2019t get sick there, no, but you had to s -- keep your health. You had to try the best\nto hope to get out sometime. My day came December 22\", I believe it was that they told me in\nthe evening that you go home tomorrow.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember how that went, but in the morning you got your own clothes back and get\nready to leave and they took you to the railroad and the railroad took you to Munich, which was\na -- the nearest city, about 10 to 12 miles away. And in Munich the Jewish community had a\nroom in the railroad station where they took you in. You had no money to buy a ticket or\nanything, so they took care of you. Next morning I was home.",
        "A: Well they -- they told me I\u2019m le -- being left because I can get out of the country. I\u2019m being\nlet out because of that. They also tell you don\u2019t speak about what happened in Dachau, don\u2019t tell\nanybody. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all. You were glad to get out and keep your mouth shut for awhile.\nYou couldn\u2019t say anything til after you left Germany.",
        "A: Yeah, that paper was coming through, and the -- the consul from Stuttgart sent it to London\nwhen I was there and then I had to wait in London about 11 months before my number came up.\nYou were registered and then in December I was able to -- I get -- went to London in January\nand in December I was able to go to new y -- to -- to -- to -- on a boat to New York.",
        "A: I had to buy a new ticket, I had bought a ticket in Germany to go to America before I-I --\nbefore Kristallnacht.",
        "A: But it was worthless because Germany was at war.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: I found my mother and father there, the house was fixed up a little, the windows had been\nreplaced and everything -- anything you did was ready to go and leave as fast as you can. I\nbought a few things and I was anxious to get out.",
        "A: Well, they were hoping. I didn\u2019t know what -- how I -- how -- how I could help til I was able\nto get to London and meet some people and look for help.",
        "A: Mentally -- well, no, I didn\u2019t discuss it, but I -- mentally I hoped that I could do something\nonce I get to London.",
        "A: He left and he was able to leave. He took a train from Basel to Le Havre and catched the boat\nhe had a ticket for, yeah.",
        "A: To United States.",
        "A: Yeah, he ne-never went back to -- to the home in Germany.",
        "A: No, I wa -- there was no way of going in touch with him. He was just lucky, he was able to --\nto leave.",
        "A: No, I was the third one. The one to Israel first --",
        "A: -- and then the brother and then me.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Who, the one in is -- yeah, he wrote, but I -- I -- when I came to London I wrote him a letter\nand I got a reply.",
        "A: Those days there was no air mail, you know, it was boat. Three weeks for a letter. You don\u2019t -\n- you don\u2019t remember those days.",
        "A: I -- I bought a railroad ticket and the ticket went from Germany to London. That included a\nferry ride from Holland into England and then another train ride into London. That was a -- the\nway of travel, because that -- there was no airplanes, you could say. There were a few small\nplanes to deliver mail or something, but people couldn\u2019t travel yet by airplane.",
        "A: Because the other cousin -- the cousin who helped me lived in London. And that was the\nnormal procedure to go to.",
        "A: He had a business. He picked me up at the railroad station and put me into a boarding home.\nHe paid for -- for two weeks stay and that was my beginning of life in London.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t allowed to work because I was a -- like a guest, I was transient. You weren\u2019t y --\nofficially you weren't allowed to work because the British had [indecipherable] on us. Was --\nwas still sort of depression and they didn\u2019t want us refugees to take jobs away from them.",
        "A: So you couldn\u2019t, even if you found a job where to work, it wouldn\u2019t help you because the\nBritish were very loyal and they didn\u2019t want you to be in trouble.",
        "A: I volunteered wer -- to work in the social cl -- like federation in the cl -- British make-up of\nthe so -- of the federation. And they let you volunteer and work for -- for nothing. They needed\nhelp because there was so much mail coming in to them and so much help needed, that it was\neasy to get that job.",
        "A: That was my luck.",
        "A: Because once I was in that boarding house, there was a card game every Wednesday night\nand one of the players heard my name and he says, I want to talk to you. And I waited for the\ngame to be over and then we talked and he told me his name and where he came from, and his\nfather and my father were friends.",
        "A: Ha -- Norbert Leaman, like the Leaman brothers. And they also came from a small village,\nthe same village where my father was born. And he was the Godsend for me. He offered to help\nme and this -- this was like a miracle. The relatives did not offer any help, but he did. Within t --\nweek or two he signed an affidavit for my parents and arranged for my brother and sister to get\nto London and they even came in to learn a profession to work. He was outstanding.",
        "A: I was very lucky. I was one of the few who was able to save a family. I was very lucky. I-It\u2019s\nhard to describe it.",
        "A: Because there was -- they f -- they came about three months after I got there and they had to\nwait in London for the visa to come to America, but that was very, very lucky. Unheard of,\npractically. And luckily my brother in Israel had a little money so he was able to send some\nmoney to live on.",
        "A: Yeah, I met -- I went to the railroad station, and picked them up and I had rented a little\napartment where to live in the north section of London near the boarding house where I was first\nput. And w-we managed. My brother and sister got a little job. He were -- he learned as a\ncarpenter and my sister did some homework, housecleaning and we managed.",
        "A: No, they came a week or two later.",
        "A: Their papers weren\u2019t ready when my parents came.",
        "A: But they came within a week or two.",
        "A: She was that -- she was born \u201923 and that was 1939, so 16.",
        "A: Rough -- rough life.",
        "A: Yeah, we lived in a small apartment.",
        "A: Oh, I went to work as a volunteer in the -- in the office, I went every day. I didn\u2019t want to give\nup my job and I helped quite a few other people to get out from Germany. I f -- I --",
        "A: Yeah, Bloomsbury House. It was known as the only agency that controlled th-the -- the\nGerman Jews to come to England. It was called Bloomsbury House. But they -- they couldn\u2019t\nemploy me, they couldn\u2019t pay me, let\u2019s put it this way, they couldn\u2019t -- they weren\u2019t allowed to --\nto hire anybody who came temporarily, which I could understand. And they -- they had one big\nbanker from London who came every afternoon and signed so many papers that were processed\nduring the day and those papers were sent to the home office and within 10 days or so, the people\nwhose name was on the papers would get the permit to come to England. That was Sir Otto\nSchiff, a -- a famous banker in London.",
        "A: He was appointed by the British to handle the immigration of the refugees. And he had to sign\napplications every day. And he had a very good secretary, Ruth Fellner. She came from Vienna\nand she prepared all the papers for him, and he came every afternoon, four or five o\u2019clock to sign\nthe papers. Without his signature the papers wouldn\u2019t have done anything.",
        "A: Ma-Maybe between 60 and a hundred.",
        "A: A -- a day.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Maybe. Well, they -- they -- they spread all over London or Manchester or\nwhatever. Wherever they had people they knew. It was a -- a -- a process, a daily process and th-\nthere was lawyers involved and I go -- I got -- I handled a few cases, I had to hire a lawyer to put\nthe applications in. And one of the lawyers liked me. He also was a refugee, but he must have\nbeen in London five years already. He was well-mannered, well-dressed and he says to me, I -- I\nneed you. And he offered to help me. He says, I'll give you some money every week, but you\nhave to help me with my cases. So I watched his cases as they come in and I reported to him\nonce a week and told him ho-how -- how they\u2019re standing, when he can expect the recess. And\nhe was very good to me. He gave me a few dollars every week and bought me a lunch. That was\nnot legal, but he felt he needed me and I did help him. I helped quite a few other people to come\nto London.",
        "A: Yeah, I had three years English in school, I was able to -- to con -- to converse and listen and\nhave conversation, yes.",
        "A: That was very fortunate. That\u2019s why I was able to do things.",
        "A: Na -- they couldn\u2019t do anything. The -- cook three meals, two meals and walk around the\nneighborhood and do a little shopping. That\u2019s all. They couldn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t know English,\nthey -- they didn't have money to do anything. You -- you -- you were marking time, if you know\nwhat that means.",
        "A: You -- from day to day you were hoping that some -- soon you will be able to leave and get\naway.",
        "A: Few clothes, fe -- necessary clothes. Wasn\u2019t important. You were ready to go without\nanything worthwhile.",
        "A: No, no. T-Two dollars, three dollars. You weren\u2019t able to bring any money, anything of value.\nTh-They searched you at the railroad station before you boarded your train. You couldn\u2019t take\nanything. You weren\u2019t allowed to leave any money -- the opposite. I was forced to pay 2,000\nmarks -- money to the Germans for -- for letting me go. There -- you couldn\u2019t take anything. My\nfather had money, couldn\u2019t bring any dollar. You had to give it away to his family and so on\nbefore leaving Germany. Was -- was impossible to bring any money. They didn\u2019t care. They --\nthey were just ready to steal everything so they didn\u2019t want you to take anything.",
        "A: Yes, there were -- there were quite a few Jewish refugees, yes. Who is that?\nA2: Your daughter.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Well, they were spread all over London. They -- there was one section northwest, Hampstead\nthey call it, there were quite a few up there, and they were living all over, wherever they could\nfind cheap accommodations. Couldn\u2019t live in the west end.",
        "A: And everybody that came was hoping to have a -- relatives in America already to send them a\nfew dollars to exist, cause nobody was allowed to work.",
        "A: Ye -- there\u2019s nothing you could do. You -- you -- you had to sit and wait and do -- sometime\nin November, or -- yeah, in November, I got there in January -- November I got a letter from the\nAmerican consulate in London that I should come and get my visa. So they -- they s -- that was\nthe -- the consulate, not the embassy. But the consulate office was in the -- in the same building\nwhere the embassy was. So I went there on a Saturday morning and I got my visa. And when I\nhad my visa I had to make arrangements for a boat to take me to New York. And you -- you go\nto the -- to the sh-ship -- C-Cunard line and they tell you this boat is leaving in a week or so and\nyou can have it, but you have to buy a ticket. And the ticket in those days was, I believe, 30\npounds and I didn't have the money. And I didn\u2019t want to take the last dollar from my parents, so\nI went around people I knew already, English people and I ended up collect -- collecting 30\npounds to buy my ticket. And wh-what I had was the -- the lowest room in the boat, on the --\nway on the bottom, but it didn\u2019t matter. It was wartime already, war started September first and I\nleft the end of November. And we weren\u2019t allowed on deck, the boat was all blacked out and\neverything, but we managed. We didn\u2019t know if a submarine would hit us or not, because the\nsubmarines were out in the ocean already.",
        "A: Nothing. Nothing, just present my passport. They had the -- the papers that the man deposited\n5,000 dollars in my name. He didn\u2019t ask any more questions.",
        "A: Yeah, he -- I never was able to go and visit him and he never asked me to come. But I\u2019m sure\nafter he found I da -- was in America, he took his money back, probably. I didn\u2019t get it.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That -- that was -- instead of an affidavit he -- he put the 5,000 in my name and -- and the\nconsul recognized that. Maybe I should have taken it away from the bank, I don\u2019t know, maybe I\nwas too honest.",
        "A: Yeah, I remember.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. You were allowed to get up and get your little suitcase, whatever you had and get\nready to -- to -- you had to go through customs and you had to go -- I forgot, you -- well, you\nalready had a card that you could go to work from the consul in London, he gave you the blue\ncard.",
        "A: 12 o\u2019clock in the morning -- 10 o\u2019clock. Twel -- the boat went up, you passed the Statue of\nLiberty and we docked about 11 - 12 o\u2019clock.",
        "A: Well, it was freedom. St -- liberty. It was a beautiful feeling. You a -- you achieved\nsomething, accomplishment.",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- I put my head together, I took my luggage and I inquired the subway and I\nwalked to 42\u2122 Street where I finally was able to catch a subway to take to Long Island, because I\nhad a cousin living in Jackson Heights. And I went there all by myself with my luggage and I got\noff at the right station and I went up and I knocked at the door, here I am.",
        "A: I think they had an idea, but they didn\u2019t know when or anything.",
        "A: Well, they took me in.",
        "A: And -- and I stayed it -- a few days later I went to work in long -- in New York.",
        "A: I we -- I went -- I walked up and down Broadway looking for a job. I -- I had to start working\nto make some money. So I got settled down fast and I stayed there. I slept on the living room\nsofa. They didn\u2019t throw me out.",
        "A: I was very happy. I was free. I -- I was able to breathe fresh air. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very -- it\u2019s\nnot easy to describe what happens those days, but I managed. That was 1939. America was in\nuproar then, the politics. Some wanted war, some wanted not to fight the Germans. You know, in\nWashington was no peace. Roosevelt already was president for the second term and they were\nfighting him and there was a lot of uproar in America. But you didn\u2019t worry about that, you\ncouldn\u2019t change anything. You just watched it. But there were a lot of forces who wanted to side\nwith Germany. That was another chapter.",
        "A: No. I tried not to, because I was a guest -- well here I was not a guest any more, but I was\nvery careful. I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t get up in discussions what\u2019s right and wrong. Was -- it was\nsomething and you -- you -- you had to lay low. But it was an experience.",
        "A: I worked in a department store in the stockroom. And we were t-tw -- twelve dollars a week\nfor 48 hours, but 1t was -- 1t was money. You could live on it.",
        "A: [had to give my cousin eight dollars a week to fi -- to -- to eat and sleep there and I had four\ndollars to spend. Was all right. I didn\u2019t starve.",
        "A: Well, the parents were -- were sitting in London waiting also to -- and they got a -- a month or\nsix weeks later they got their visa to come to America. And they came on the same boat I came\nover.",
        "A: No, they had to -- a -- a relative in Philadelphia who signed the affidavit for them. A -- a --\nwidow, very nice lady. I paid her a lis -- a visit a few years later. She was very generous. She\npaid -- she -- she -- she signed the papers, she didn't give them any money or anything, but she\nsigned the papers to bring them here.",
        "A: They came about six weeks after I came.",
        "A: That fast, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- and I was lucky to get out from England because the British were starting to take\nthe refugees and sending them either to Canada or to Australia. They didn\u2019t allow them to st -- to\nsettle in England. In other words, they were all temporary. And they started to -- to send them\nout to their colonies, which they cou -- no one could refuse because they were just told to go -- to\nget on a boat and go. They didn\u2019t have to buy a ticket or anything, the British government forced\nthem to go, either to Canada or to Australia.",
        "A: And quite a few left when their visa didn\u2019t come up as fast as mine came up, they went. They\nhad to go. I knew -- then later on, some of those people came back to New York.",
        "A: We had la -- quite a few people like that.",
        "A: But at least they were free. That -- that\u2019s another story.",
        "A: Yeah, my parents came to New York and I picked them up and took them to the same\napartment where I was. Yeah, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, they all -- they came and they went. They went to Baltimore because my older brother\nsettled in Baltimore and I had aunt who had settled in Baltimore, the family settled in Baltimore,\nbut I stayed in New York. I figured I\u2019d try to make a go in New York.",
        "A: No -- no -- never regret it.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah, I liked New York. It was a -- a metropolitan city. I didn\u2019t have money to see anything,\nbut I liked it. It was -- after London comes New York.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No. I stayed there til I was drafted. No, I didn't look for an apartment my own, I didn\u2019t have\nenough money to even consider one and I didn\u2019t need it. I was taken care of, and so I was da --\nwa-was about two years and the war had started November -- December 7\"\", 1941, and we the --\nwe were drafted in 1942. I was drafted in -- it\u2019s in the book. No, I think it was mo -- May -- May\nor June 1942. And --",
        "A: Well, I couldn\u2019t fight it. I had to go, I was at the right age and I was healthy. And we had to\ncontribute to win the war. That was all there was to it. You couldn\u2019t fight it, you had to do your\npart. That\u2019s how it started, and to -- we -- we were taken -- you -- you don\u2019t know the routine\nthey had in New York. You had to go to your draft board, then they took you over to Governor\u2019s\nIsland, which is way down Manhattan, and there they swore you in. Then they took you to Penn\nStation, you got on a train and they took you to Camp Upton, way ou -- way out near Riverhead.\nAnd there you changed into uniforms and you got a few tests and you send your clothes home.\nAnd that was the end of being your own boss. You got your three meals a day and you got\nmedical examinations. You -- you got -- you were part of the army.",
        "A: Yes, well you were wearing the American uniform. You were a part of the system.",
        "A: No, you felt you were better off being there than being in Germany in a concentration camp.\nSo you felt good about it. And you -- yo-you grew up in the army. You -- you had to learn the\nslang wen -- language. You had to do a lot of things you weren\u2019t used to, but you managed.\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: June of \u00b042.",
        "A: We trained out to la -- to Camp Upton. We stayed there four or five days to get uniform, to\nget all -- and certain tests and medical examination, that was -- you were in. You couldn\u2019t -- you\ncouldn\u2019t run away any more. You had to send your civilian clothes home. Y-You were tol -- they\ntold you, not allowed to wear civilian clothes any more. You -- you\u2019re in for duration plus six\nmonths. So you don\u2019t know duration was a month or a year or five years.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: We knew that Dachau had existed and the other camps, because you heard a lot about them.\nBut you really didn't know what was going on til they finally put you in there and you\nexperienced it.",
        "A: But -- but -- but it -- that was a definite future for them, to use them and to punish people who\nwere -- politically didn\u2019t agree with them. In other words, people who were more t --\nCommunists or certain other tribes, they didn\u2019t want them, so they put them in there and\ncontrolled them so they couldn\u2019t undermine the Nazi government.",
        "A: That was one of the reasons they built the concentration camp.",
        "A: Of course, then they used them to put the Jews 1n af -- especially after the war started and\nnobody could leave Germany any more, that was a -- a different story.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, I had uncles and aunts and cousins, they weren\u2019t able to get out. They were -- they\nbecame part of the system that were destroyed, yes. You still got a few letters from them p-\npleading with you to help them, but you couldn\u2019t do anything, because first of all we had no\nmoney and they had no connections to make to -- to -- to leave Germany. It was -- it was\ndesperate pleas for -- for them to come and look for help. I was a rare case that I was able to save\nmy family.",
        "A: It was hard to get the letters, yes. But th-th -- I had some, my father left some for me, it was\nheartbreaking, if you know what I mean. Even some I -- I had a couple of uncles where the son\nalready was in America and he couldn\u2019t do anything for them. He had no money and he had no --\nno way of anybody signing an affidavit for them. It was -- and the war came very suddenly,\nwhen the borders were closed, if you know what I\u2019m saying. And like I say to schoolchi -- a\nfriend of mine, whose family was well-to-do with paintings and everything, he -- they couldn\u2019t\nget out. They -- they were settling in Holland and nobody realized overnight Holland can be\noverrun and connected to Germany and there was no mu -- nobody allowed to leave Holland any\nmore. And some people went into France and they were caught in France. You -- you don\u2019t\nknow what was -- what -- wha-what was right and wrong. It was impossible to plan anything. It\u2019s\n-- it\u2019s really hard to describe. And then there were a lot of American relatives who didn\u2019t want to\nhelp and didn\u2019t bend over to help. It\u2019s -- you -- you don\u2019t know what to do. You don\u2019t know how\nlucky I was, besides saving myself.",
        "A: It\u2019s hard to describe it. My -- my children always ask me questions about that, because they\nadmired me, the way I was able to handle it. You read it -- you read it in the book, too. I was so\nlucky. And that\u2019s why I felt I have to give back something, and I did my best in the army to do\nthe right thing.",
        "A: Camp Wheeler, Georgia. The -- th -- from Fort Upton they put you on a troop train, you don\u2019t\nknow where you\u2019re going, but the train took you to Camp Wheeler near Macon, Georgia. And it\nwas a big camp that was built up for that purpose and there is 90 days tough training. An-And --\nbut no matter what -- how tough it was, you couldn\u2019t compare anything to remind you of the\nconcentration camp. You had three good meals a day. It was hot during the summer, but you had\nto learn to live with the climate, but you managed and you knew it was 1 -- you were in for\nawhile. And from Camp Wheeler I was lucky, I met another friend who was good to me, Freddy\nStrauss.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: He -- he was an -- his mother was a distant relative of my mother, who came from New York\nand he was working in Cincinnati and he got drafted and he was in Camp Wheeler a few months\nbefore me and he was graduate from New York University, he al -- he al-already was a sergeant\nand he worked in a regimental headquarters. So I met him some -- some weekend, Saturday\nsomeplace and he took care of me. He started to take me to Atlanta for a weekend, he -- he took\nover. We had good meals in Atlanta, we -- we were like a -- like brothers. It was unbelievable\nthat I as a trainee was allowed -- he went to the sergeant to get permission to take me and I\nalready was a little bit elevated, if you know what I mean.",
        "A: And we stayed friends all our lives. He passed away very young, in middle of 1955 or \u201960. I\nstill in touch with his three boys.",
        "A: Once I make a friendship, it lasts. They -- they just hang on to me.",
        "A: Okay, okay.",
        "A: Thank you.\nQ2: Yes, perfect, thank you.",
        "A: Is it all right now?\nQ2: Yeah, it\u2019s perfect, thank you.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: 90 days. They took you on a truck to Macon, there\u2019s a federal courthouse there and they took\nyou in and the judge swears you in with all the other non-citizens. There was Italians, there was\nGreeks, they weren\u2019t all Jews. And you get sworn in. After 90 days you become an American\ncitizen. You didn\u2019t have to wait five years. They figured -- this is the routine they took. They\ndidn\u2019t isolate us like they isolated the Japanese citizens and put them in camps. They gave us the\nprivilege of becoming a citizen so they didn\u2019t have to worry where we would have to go in the\nwar.",
        "A: I may have read something in the paper, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Once I was a citizen, I was equal.",
        "A: Before that? Well, it was only 90 days.",
        "A: Yeah, no, then you had your papers to stay. You were allowed to work. You --",
        "A: I was never in danger, no. I had papers --",
        "A: -- to wait five years to become a citizen.",
        "A: But I was never in danger of being arrested or deported or anything like that. While the\nJapanese, you know, they weren\u2019t asked questions, 1t was just a government ruling to put them\naway.",
        "A: The government was nervous, that\u2019s all I can say.",
        "A: Some of them became good soldiers, yo-you -- you understand what I mean.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t ask for that isolation, but no, we had no problem. After 90 days you were sworn\nin, and that was full fledged citizen.",
        "A: No, they sent me to Augusta to another outfit.",
        "A: A regular fort infantry division that th-th-they -- they were filling the army divisions with the\nnew recruits, so so many went here, so many went -- we were sent all over. I want -- went in a\ngroup to go to Augusta, Georgia, and I was put in the fourth infantry division. And there were\nproblems, but you had to overcome it. I was a refugee, I was a Jew, I was a -- a Yankee. I was\neverything but as -- American.",
        "A: Yeah. Hillbillies. Hillbillies, some of them, a lot of them had never seen a Jew, they thought\nthat Jews had to grow horns. And it was a tough life for awhile. Eve-Even the officers, some of\nwhom were regular army officers, some of them were reserve officers and then a little later came\nthe young ones, the -- what we call the 90 day wonders. They were the college kids who were\nsent to some kind of a school in Fort Benning and after 90 days they got sworn in as a second\nlieutenant. They were mixed, from all over the country. But the old-time officers were not too\nfriendly to us refugees. They were their own -- their own people and they -- they spent every\nyear two weeks in the army reserve for two weeks training and they let you know that they are\nregular army people. Th-They felt differently.",
        "A: [have no idea.",
        "A: I have no idea how many --",
        "A: -- | -- I don\u2019t know how many Jews. I think we had in the fourth division, six percent Jews in\nthe division, but how many of the Jews were refugees, I don\u2019t know. It -- it -- we weren\u2019t\ngrouped as a group to associate with one another. There was too many different units that we\nwere distributed.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t -- we me -- we met. There was a rabbi in the division and he held the service\nFriday night and we met maybe 20 - 25 boys there. But a -- but the-the-they were not refugees,\nthey were Americans. So you met Jews, but you didn\u2019t know exactly how many. But we always\nhad the figure of about six percent. In other words, the division wa -- had about 14,000 people\nand there was supposed to be about six or 700 Jews amongst -- distributed between the officers\nand the men. It 1 -- it -- it was never an isolated group. We were always mixed in. And like I say,\nafter awhile you were respected. But it was not easy.",
        "A: Well, you were a minority, you were a refugee, which they all could understand and they just\ndidn\u2019t love you. When -- when it was time for a detail, they picked on you. You do this tonight,\nyou do that. You had no choice. But sooner or later you grew up and you demanded more\nrespect, and --",
        "A: No, no, no. Never. No fights with anybody, because I wasn\u2019t made to be a fighting man. But\nit was tough. And we had a rabbi, who was a -- a good man from the seminary and he had a\ntough job also. He was part in the chapel to have services Friday night and he had to go to the\ndifferent regiments to maintain services, and he had to take the interest of the Jewish boys. It was\npart of his job.",
        "A: To England? I told you I went to England January 1939.",
        "A: Oh, oh --",
        "A: -- wi -- wi -- oh. That\u2019s something else.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: The army -- the army sent the fourth division from Georgia to Fort Dix, New Jersey, 16,000\nmen. In Fort Dix we were supposed to go to Africa to fight the war in Africa.",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s why they sent us to Fort Dix, Fort Dix was near lu -- near Brooklyn where they\nloaded up the troops and sent them. While in Fort Dix they realized they had no facilities\nshipping to -- to handle us. So we couldn\u2019t go. Marking time in Fort Dix, they -- then they sent\norders and sent us to Florida. In Florida they sent us out in the wilderness. There is a wilderness\nin Florida, it\u2019s west of sa -- Tallahassee. It\u2019s on the Gulf of Mexico. They had little huts there,\nlittle barracks, they had floors, rattlesnakes crawling all over. And there we got our first taste of\namphibious training. In other words, we were marked to partake in Europe at something special.\nSo they gave us training, small old boats to go out on the gulf, and it -- it was there,\nThanksgiving day 1943 and a storm came up and some of the boats turned over and a couple of\nfellows drowned. They didn\u2019t care, they said, you got to be trained.",
        "A: Yeah, broken down landing crafts, not the -- not the new ones. The navy was there, the coast\nguard was there, there was an island off the coast, it was called Dark Islands. The air force used\nit to put their bombs into certain buildings there. It was -- it was a rough training.",
        "A: Not too far away.",
        "A: Pensacola. Tallahassee. Apalachicola was the next town, if you know the neighborhood.",
        "A: It was 50 miles away from Tallahassee.",
        "A: Yeah. Anyhow, we stayed there from about September to November -- November, I believe.\nThree months or something for training. And they told you you can\u2019t go home, you can\u2019t get a\nfurlough unless you know how to swim 50 yards. They had a pool there, you forced yourself to\nswim it so you get a furlough to go home.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, but they gave me a pass anyhow. Then they loaded us up again on a train and\nsent us to South Carolina, Fort Jackson. They -- I was home on furlough when the orders came,\ndon\u2019t come back to Florida, go to Fort Jackson, South Carolina. So I went there and we stayed\nthere a month for more, what they call strip down and preparation. Then they shipped us up to\nNew Jersey, Fort ca -- Camp Kilmer, near New Brunswick. There we had to stay two weeks to\nget our shots and our overseas equipment and all that stuff. And then we left early January.",
        "A: Early January for -- for the s -- trip to lond -- to England, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And the submarines were out there waiting for us. You had no choice.",
        "A: No, n-no --",
        "A: -- no submarines deta -- was a convoy of about 50 boats and destroyers going around all the\ntime, no, no submarine came, no. No nothing. We were lucky, that\u2019s all, because pa -- prior to\nthat they lost boats with troops [indecipherable] on the ocean. But we were -- we were lucky,\nnobody actually worried, because they needed us in Europe.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t have. I want -- I\u2019m glad I went to Europe and not to Pacific. That -- that feeling I\nhad, because at -- at -- at least I knew I w -- I had a language and I -- I felt I belonged there.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I had the feeling. And -- and my break came when they invited me for an interview to\ngo up f -- division as an interpreter. And that\u2019s when I got a job and I became a mensch.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah, but when I -- n-no, it happened in March, so it was about a month or two after coming\nto England that it happened, yeah. I have the dates down.",
        "A: Well, you were with different people, you were doing different things. I -- I became a -- a\nJeep driver, I became somebody that was important.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yes, privileges, and wi-with a different group of people. You met officers who were ranking\nand educated and with entirely different life.",
        "A: Ihave been -- I would have been fighting 1n the front line. Would have been one of the first to\nland on the beach. And th-the -- the beach we invaded was -- was wa -- lucky, th-they -- they\npractically walked across. And was -- was like -- not like a war time. E-Even Colonel Reider told\nme he was pulling flags out [indecipherable] and it means wor-worry they\u2019re mines, but there\nwere only flags, there were no mines in the ground. If there would have been mines, we would\nhave had lots of casualties. But they didn\u2019t -- either they didn\u2019t have mines or they didn\u2019t want\nthem there. Rommel might have been da -- may have done it on purpose, we don\u2019t know. He\ndidn\u2019t live long enough to tell us.",
        "A: No, y-you -- you were out on the water, on the channel for practically four days, because we\nloaded up on a Friday night and the boat pulled out to make room for another boat. There were --\nthere were 5,000 boats to be loaded, and go out into the channel to prepare. And it took time to\nload these boats, because you had to drive on your equipment, you had to pack it onto the boat so\nyou could drive off. Nothing was normal, everything was practically upside-down. And in -- in\nthe midst of everything, you looked up in the sky, where are the German planes? You worried\nwhen they come out and put the bombs on you or anything like that. And it didn\u2019t come out. And\nthe weather, once we were out on the channel, the weather turned bad. Was a big storm coming\nup, so they -- they decided they couldn\u2019t land that day, on the fifth of June. The -- the sea was too\nrough, they couldn\u2019t unload or anything. So they delayed it 24 hours, we were circling more on\nthe water, worried, where are the German planes? And they didn't show up. So we were more\nthan lucky that there was no interference for -- for the whole fle -- crew. The British, the French,\nthe American, everybody was calm. And then, finally they decided if they don\u2019t la-land the next\nday, they have to delay it another two or three weeks, because of the moon and the tide. They\nwere worried that it\u2019s high water, to get the boats in closer. So they decided to land as -- on June\nsixth. The decision came 24 hours before, that Eisenhower made the decision, this 1s it, we have\nto land.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. So wa -- we were on the boat, the -- the captain of the boat had to know. And in a way\nit -- we felt 1t was good to get it over with, because if it would have been another day, they would\nhave had to turn around, put more fuel into the boats, because they were going to run low on fuel\nafter circling four days out on the water. So the -- June six opened it up, and there still was no\nGerman airplanes, which wa-was like a miracle. And the German pilots had -- they had moved\ntheir -- their airplanes away from the front in France, way back to practically the German border,\nso they were confused also. Rommel had gone home to visit his wife for that week.",
        "A: Yeah. So, she cooperated. [laughter] We should have given her a medal. What are you\nlaughing?",
        "A: I described it in the book. I did nothing, I was -- my -- my Jeep was not allowed to be a part of\nthe invasion fleet, 1t wasn\u2019t deemed necessary enough for me to have it the first week.",
        "A: My Jeep, yeah. I left it back in England.",
        "A: My Jeep, yeah.",
        "A: So I went without anything, just my personal equipment.",
        "A: Division -- division headquarters. I wa -- I could be shifted around wherever they needed me,\nbut I didn\u2019t have my own Jeep the first two weeks because th-they couldn\u2019t handle all the\nequipment so they left some transportation behind, and that came in two weeks later when --\nwhen I got my own Jeep. So --",
        "A: I -- I stayed with my truck where we all were, and we moved inland about five, six miles and\nwe started to eat supper and settle down a little. We were eating the box K rations, what they\nused to call it, and it helped that -- we ate the same food aboard the ship. The navy couldn\u2019t feed\nus, they didn\u2019t have the know-how or the time or the equipment.",
        "A: About four -- five o\u2019clock in the afternoon.",
        "A: The morning, you -- nothing, you stood around and looked over and see if the airplanes are\ncoming.",
        "A: Yeah, seven o\u2019clock this morning -- in the morning.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. The invasion started seven in the morning, clock-wise.",
        "A: You heard gunfire, yes, yeah. You had sh -- you had shells coming in and small arms fire, but\nyo-you -- you didn\u2019t worry, you just went and hoped for the best, that\u2019s all.",
        "A: That was the first day in France.",
        "A: Yeah, you passed, you looked, you read the report how Colonel Gaitling observed the first\nfarmer, how they lead a comfortable life. They didn\u2019t know the war was going on. You -- you\ncan\u2019t believe everything. But it was un-unreal, if you know what I mean.",
        "A: When I think back, I -- I --\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: Wipe off the Chinese food.",
        "A: Okay, and thank you.",
        "A: Anything else not in order?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, th -- it was either the first or second night, I went out on a patrol by myself and I\ncaptured a German soldier; he came out of the woods. So I was able to talk to him, he was not\nreally German, he was Czechoslovak, but he -- he knew German. That\u2019s when I started using it.",
        "A: After that you don\u2019t know when you ran into something. I was not in char -- in charge to\ninterrogate prisoners. They had special teams on each regiment called interrogation of prisoners\nof war. They had at least three German speaking fellows there, in each team. And they took care\nof the prisoners. It was not my responsibility.",
        "A: Well, I was doing a ch -- military government and division headquarters if they had problems.",
        "A: Yeah, an officer would say, let\u2019s go here and there, that\u2019s it. And th -- and then I drove and he\nsat next to me and when we hit Germans, I talked f-for him and translated. That -- that went on\nall -- all week, all day, every day something special.",
        "A: Sunday morning sometimes we went to -- we had to give them permission if they wanted a\nchurch service. They weren\u2019t allowed to gather without our permission.",
        "A: The Germans. German civilians. So one of the majors always said, let\u2019s check the church\nservice. So I -- we drove over to the next village where the church was and went in. And that\nservice usually was nine o\u2019clock -- eight o\u2019clock, nine o\u2019clock we went in and we sat in the back.\nAnd I had to listen to what was going on and tell him. So at the end they usually had three Ave\nMarias for their old people, for their children, for their sick people. And when they were finished\nwith that, I got up and I yelled, and one Ave Maria for our liberators. And they didn\u2019t like it, but\nthey s -- they sa -- recited it. And the major always said, very good, I like the way you did it. We\nhad to let them know we are watching.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: My -- the fourth division liberated Paris.",
        "A: We were -- we were hand picked for that beca -- I don\u2019t know -- wa -- wa -- one of the\nreasons I know, there was a -- a-an -- an officer or a colonel, a very elegant fellow, he spent two\nyears in Paris in the American embassy as military attach\u00e9 before the war. So he knew Paris\ninside-out. So they told his regiment to be the leading regiment into Paris, because he knew\nevery corner -- and I wa -- I was going to say, every elegant woman. I think that may have been\nthe reason th -- the for -- not th-the reason, but the regiment was picked as the leading regiment.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Because of him, yeah. You know, you -- you -- the average officer didn\u2019t know anything\nabout Paris and Paris was a blackout city, no streetlight, no other light, nothing. It was daylight\nor -- or | -- or dark. I was having my Major Fissette for three days, we were riding up and down\nParis. He had to take care of lots of things. And they attached a French professor to us to -- to\nguide us, to help us. So this professor, he -- he lived in Neuille, which is north of Paris, elegant\nsap -- elegant wife, but he would have to sleep home at night. He wouldn\u2019t a -- be able to sleep\nwith us. So at 10 o\u2019clock, 11 o\u2019clock at night, I had to drive through Paris in a blackout and --\nwith my major and bring him home. And then come back to find our headquarters, which was in\na zoo. We were sleeping in the zoo in Paris, we didn\u2019t go to the Ritz hotel.",
        "A: Every day was a little bit different.",
        "A: E-Even when -- if the headquarters didn\u2019t move, there was always something different to do.\nAnd of course the first -- the first big challenge came when we hit Cherbourg, 20 -- 24 - 25 days\nafter landing on D-Day. That was the -- the first city that came -- that was liberated o -- the\nmayor may have come in --",
        "A: -- if I heard something. And that -- that city was important because they needed the deep dock\nfor the big boats to come in.",
        "A: And the freight and everything. So into Paris -- in-into Cherbourg, I was alone, I had no\nofficer with me. So I drove in and I -- I didn\u2019t speak French, a few words, and I decided -- I\nchecked myself into the German military hospital. I figured some of the bi-big Nazi bastards may\nput bandages on, or cl -- or -- or -- legs or arms or something, and give themselves up as soldiers\nso they wouldn\u2019t get arrested. But I -- I couldn\u2019t find any in the hospital under that duration, and\nthe smell in that hospital was impossible. So after an hour or so I checked out. I couldn\u2019t -- I\ncouldn\u2019t find anybody and I didn't -- couldn\u2019t stay any longer, th-the smell -- they had dead\npeople, they buried them in the backyard, and it was miserable. So I checked out and I went to\nthe Hotel Atlantic where the division had set up headquarters and I put a blanket on the floor in\nthe lobby and I slept there for a few hours. General Roosevelt was -- had been appointed\ncommanding officer of the Cherbourg area.",
        "A: I met him, but I didn\u2019t know him, but Major Fissette worked with him for -- for -- lived with\nhim for three, four months.",

        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t help the military because I wasn\u2019t supposed to talk to capt -- to --\nto prisoners.",

        "A: Because they had special guys in each regiment who were supposed to -- to stick to these\nsoldiers and try to get them to talk and find out. That\u2019s why one of the fellows in the 22\ninfantry hit a German soldier and he -- he claims, if you give me a map, I\u2019ll show you exactly\nwhere Rommel\u2019s headquarters is. So he opened up a map and the guy really pointed it out, it was\na certain chateau in a small village. And that information they gave to the air corps and within a\nfew days they bombed the road leading to the headquarters and Rommel was driving on that road\nand was wounded very badly. He was unconscious for a week. Of course, they didn\u2019t know he\nwanted to be our friend. So it shows you what can happen.",
        "A: No, I was there three days with a Major Fissette. We were together day and night. We closed\nwhore houses, we -- we did all kinds of crazy things.",

        "A: They were -- most of them were taken prisoners and they wanted to be taken prisoners by the\nAmericans because the free French wanted to kill them. So they\u2019d rather offered themselves to\nthe Americans to feel more secure.",

He had a Jeep for himself and he had\nanother Jeep for si -- five or six or eight French volunteers from the FFI who protected him and\ndid everything we wanted him -- he was like a general.",
        "A: He was -- militarily he was a big -- a man of lots of experience, and he went in division\nheadquarters, he was allowed into any office, anything, and the generals asked him sometimes\nfor his opinion. And he also carried a gun. He wasn\u2019t supposed to, but he carried a gun. He was\nnearly thrown out from Europe for that.",
        "A: I met him the first time in Germany when we liberate -- when we evacuated that town where -\n- where you have those pictures over there, pu [indecipherable]. It was dec -- September 16\" or\nsomething we met, and when we evacuated the town, he came in with John Rose tos -- together.",

        "A: You could see his -- his build, his uniform. He wor -- he wore a German fur lined jacket, a sh\n-- a Sheepskin jacket. He wore a big belt. [indecipherable]. He captured that in an African wars\nfrom a German officer. You could spot him a mile away.",

        "A: Then he went home to -- I -- I don\u2019t know whether he went to Cuba or whether he went to the\n-- to Florida, the beach, where he had a house.",
        "A: It was cold, miserable, snow, rain, everything. And then of course was the counterattack from\nthe Germans, December 16\", and that was no picnic for us. Was very tough. I -- I must tell y --\nte-tell you a story. We were in Swiya -- 1n bl -- in Zweifall, a German town, a small town, two,\nmaybe two, 3,000 [indecipherable] south of Aachen. Th-The battle of the Huertgen forest, I have\nthe story in German if you want it, I can give you. And there, we were in the -- in the town, and\nit was miserable. Water in the foxhole, fog, snow, everything. And they made me go out in the\nmorning, eight o\u2019clock to the next -- a big farm, to get milk for the children in the town. So every\nmorning I drove out and I got a couple of cans of milk. And one time a woman says to me, she\nwants to talk to an officer. I said, I'll bring you an officer. So next morning I said to Fissette, I\nsaid, there\u2019s a woman out there on the -- on the ranch, she wants to talk to an officer. He says,\nPll go with you. So I took him there and I showed him the house. I -- I knew she talked English\nso I didn\u2019t bother going in with him, I sent him in, and he talked to her. She asked him if he\nknew a Major Collin. So he said, yes, I know a Major Collins, he is General Collins now, he\u2019s a\ncorps commander, he\u2019s right here in the neighborhood. Well, she told him her name, I have it\nwritten down, ma -- phone so and so. He was -- he was her boyfriend in World War I. She was\nlooking for him. [laughs] You -- you laugh.",
        "A: See what a war can do?",
        "A: So -- so Fissette fixed him up, he -- he -- he made sure the general goes and meets and looks\nup the old girlfriend.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, the only time I shi -- I was doing a little shooting in Paris. I was on a bridge and they\nwere shooting down from a high-rise building and I took my gun and shoot back at them. But yo\n-- | didn\u2019t see anybody, but everybody else was shooting, so I was shooting also.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: I was lucky, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Because I -- I -- I -- I tell you something, I was careful. I didn\u2019t stick my neck out when I\ndidn\u2019t have to, because I didn\u2019t see -- I couldn\u2019t see my being shipped home in a box to my\nfather. So I did not take any special dangerous missions. One time word came around they\nlooking for a German speaking fellow. The Germans had demanded that an American pe -- ma --\nofficer come over and look at an area where there\u2019s a prisoner of war camp so they wouldn\u2019t\nshoot and kill our own prisoners. So I said to myself, it\u2019s not my day. You know it, sometimes\nyou wake up in the morning, you have that feeling. I took my Jeep and went out hiding for a few\nhours. I figured, this is not for me today. Because sometimes if they hit a Jew, they can kill him\nand to send back and [indecipherable] he was in an accident, or something. So I didn\u2019t go that\nday. That afternoon I felt this is not for me. I went into hiding for a few hours and then I come\nback and then I found out they had an officer in one of the regiments, lieutenant something, and\nthey sent him over. But he came back all right with the information. You know, sometimes you\nwake up with a feeling, and -- and you have to take care of yourself. Another time, when we\nbroke out from Normandy, I was up in a villa -- in an -- in a -- in a town, was just taken. There\nwas still fighting there, Saint-Pois, it was right in Normandy. And I -- I drove into town like a big\nshot, and the officer, Captain Walker says to me, get the hell out of here, you have no business\nbeing here. I was ready to put up proclamations for the -- for the French people. So he says, get\nout. So I turned around and I got out. I figured if the mayor -- major throws you out, you\u2019re out. I\nwent back. Next day, I had -- th-the town was taken and I came back with my proclamations.\nAnd the town was on a little hill and it had -- when you go up it had like an S curve in order to\nget there. So on my way up to the town, I see a Jeep blown up. I passed this, and I said to myself,\nI don\u2019t know what happened. When I got up into the town and th -- the regiment from the 22\"\ninfantry was right next on the outskirts, one of the fellows, he knew me, he says, got bad news\nfor you. He says, your friend, Feinberg, whatever his name was, was killed last night. I said, he\nwas on patrol on a Jeep? He said yes. I said, I passed the Jeep. So I said nothing to -- the bodies\nwere torn to pieces, four of them. I said no-nothing and I felt -- I [indecipherable] I was on the\nroad the day before and nothing happened, so I figure the Germans came in during the night, put\nmines in the road. Because that Jeep was hit with a mine. So what can -- I could do nothing, if\nyou know what I mean. I just had bad news. He was a very smart fellow and we were friends, in\na way. Anyhow, coming home from the war, about -- must have been six, eight years later, I said\nto myself, I\u2019m going to Brooklyn to visit the family. The -- the least I can do. Th-Then -- I\nstarted out on a Sunday afternoon to go to Brooklyn. I had the address. Halfway down I said to\nmyself, if I tell them the truth, they\u2019Il be hurt, if I lie to them, they don\u2019t let me go til I break\ndown and tell them the truth. I turned around and went home. If you know what I mean. That\u2019s\nfeelings.",

        "A: I was in a hospital in Dijon, France, I believe, because I had an o -- in April I had an appendix\nattack, and I turned myself in-into infirmary and they -- they -- the infirmary couldn\u2019t know\nmuch, they were not equipped for it, so they send me to another hospital, another hospital and the\n-- that la -- the \u2018nother hospital sent me down on a troo -- on a hospital train to Dijon, France,\nwhich was a general hospital. And there they decided I don\u2019t need the operation, I just need a\nfew days rest. So I was in that hospital and the guy in charge, the doctor in charge was a -- a -- a\nbig drunk. I do -- he came from Detroit, he was a major, but I could see no -- no future. He gave\nme about 40 pills to take in one day, and he just didn\u2019t know. I think he was filled up with liquor\nall the time. Anyhow, they finally let me go, three weeks later or something. And when you go in\nthe hospital you lose yourself. You can\u2019t pr -- you can\u2019t take a gun in with you, you can\u2019t take a\nknife in with you because they are very cautious that -- people go crazy, you -- you understand\nwhat I mean? So the -- all that they take away from you. Well anyhow, they discharged me and I\ngot a troop train up to cher -- into Germany. Worms, a city near the Rhine. And that was what\u2019s\ncalled a replacement depot. And I was in there waiting to get assigned. Meanwhile the war had\nended, and I forgot to tell you, the fourth division, in October \u201944, General Marshall came over\nto France and he made the speech in division headquarters, I wasn\u2019t there. He said, some of you\nboys will have to go to Japan when you finish the war here. So what can you do? You\u2019re part of\nthe division, division goes, you have to go. Anyhow, I didn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t too anxious to go back\nto the division, so they assigned me to six army group in Heidelberg. From the -- from Worms, I\nwas sent to Heidelberg and I joined -- I was in there, I was driving a Jeep, I was going on a few\ntrips with an officer. And I had, from civilian life I had a friend who was stationed in Heidelberg.\nHe worked for the signal corps. So I looked him up and we were friends, we were together and\nso on. So sure enough, in June the division was sent home, ready to redo -- regroup and go to\nJapan. They had no choice, General Marshall selected them. Yeah. Ye-Yeah. They took out the\nGerman speaking fellows and left them in Europe.",
        "A: They figured they\u2019re no good in Japan. Anyhow, that\u2019s what happened, so I stayed in Europe,\nand I got myself another assignment. That\u2019s when I went to another replacement and took off\nand went to my hometown.\nBeginning Tape Five",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I did.",

I would go out on a patrol, I -- if I don\u2019t\nhave -- 1-1f I didn\u2019t have to drive an officer, I still went out and looked and see what I can do. I-\nIt\u2019s in the book, one time I picked up two officers that were shot through the arm. There\u2019s always\nsomething coming up you could do.",
        "A: I went back to my hometown the first time I was stationed in Heidelberg. I said to the captain,\nI need a Jeep and I want to go and visit my hometown. He gave me a pass and the Jeep for a day\n-- for a day and a half.",
        "A: That was in the summer, yeah. That was in May a -- probably in June. And I drove there and\nI-I went in. I -- I -- I visited a good farmer that I knew was no Nazi and I felt safe to go in and w-\nwe had some lunch and he was glad to see me, he couldn\u2019t believe it. So I stayed there and I\nwent to the military government in Ochsenfurt and I told that captain who I am, and I said, I\u2019d\nlike to come and work for you. He says, I need you. And he was so pepped up, he got into his\nJeep and followed me in my Jeep to Heidelberg --",
        "A: -- which was about two to three hour drive.",
        "A: Yeah, he wanted me. And he -- he followed right behind me and he went into the same\ncaptain who gave me the Jeep, he says, I need this man. And the captain says, I can\u2019t let you\nhave him. Just like that he -- he denied it ca -- ca -- I think 1t was Captain Friedman. Anyhow,\nthat was it, so a few days later Captain Friedman says to me, I want you to go out, I need some\nwine. I want you to go and get me a couple of hundred bottles of wine. I said, give me a Jeep, I'll\nget your wine. So I drove down to Mannheim and I see a sign, winery and I went in and I tell\nguy, I need some good wine. He says, I have it. He opened up cobblestones in his courtyard and\nhe pulled out a couple of cases of Moselle wine. I took 200 bottles, and I paid him a nickel a\nbottle. I didn\u2019t steal it. And after that the captain says to me, I\u2019m supposed to tell you the colonel\nsaid he never drank wine like that. I said, you tell him he\u2019ll never get it again like that. And that\nmiserable captain didn\u2019t even say to me, take a bottle for yourself, 1f you know what I mean. I\ndidn't need it, I always had a bottle of wine when I needed one. Anyhow, then a-all of a sudden\nthe order came transferring me to a replacement near Frankfurt. So I figured this 1s -- I\u2019m getting\naway from that captain. So I went to Frankfurt, but now -- but -- but now [indecipherable |\nHamburg, where the replacement office was and I checked in. And when I walked out in the\nbuilding, my friend Colonel Gaitling walks in the street. He had come back from aus -- he had\ncome back from somewhere and was ready for re-assignment. So he says, come up to my office,\nI want to talk to you. He had a -- a private room, a -- a major or a colonel gets treated well. So I\nwent up to his office, he\u2019s -- tried to hand me a bottle of cognac. He says, I want you to come\nwith me, I\u2019ve become security officer in Linz, which was Austria. I said, Colonel, as much as I\nlike to go with you, but I won\u2019t -- I have a de -- I have a desire to go to my hometown and take\ncare of things. He says, if you feel that way, you go and I get you some other time. So next\nmorning I pack my bundle and I go to the information -- no-not information office, the -- the --\nthe communication office where they handled the mail and so on. I said to the guy, a -- e -- a --\nare you going out into Germany with your distributings, your mail? He says yeah. I says, can I\ncome along? He says yeah, sit in the back of the Jeep. So I had my bundle with me, nothing but a\n-- in those days you had a ha -- half a duffel bag full. A set of underwear, and shoes, nothing\nmuch. So I sat, and within two hours we were at the very place I wanted to go. And I checked in\nwith the captain, I said, I\u2019m here to stay, unofficially. No --",

        "A: In Germany.",
        "A: No papers, no nothing, I just packed and left. I didn't go in the office and tell them nothing. I\nfigured, if they find -- if they want me, they\u2019ll find me. So I went in and I started working. The\ncaptain was very happy, I had -- I knew people, I knew information, I knew what was going on.\nSo I worked there and I stayed there and nothing happened until about September first. Then all\nof a sudden they sent an order for me to go to Austria. I said no more, I had enough. I packed my\nbundle and I went into the next hospital and I told them I feel sick, I\u2019m out. And they -- they take\nme to another hos-hospital and then I got a hospital with a nice Jewish doctor from New York\nand he says, I\u2019m going to send you home. I said, I appreciate it. I took him out for -- w-we went\nback to where I was stationed, I poured some wine for him. I had place where the German army\nhad le-leather saddles from the horse ho -- from the cavalry days, and I gave him a -- I opened up\nthe door, I said here, you take yourself a couple -- he had the horse in Central Park at the time,\nfor the wife to ride. So I gave him a couple of saddles, he was out of this world. Brand new\nleather saddles, if you know what I\u2019m talking about. So anyhow, he sent me home. It took two,\nthree months, but I got home on the hospital ship.",

They had to ra -- to make\nsure the electric was rebuilt, the railroads were rebuilt. Everything was in shambles. Nothing was\nworking.

So I was allowed to arrest them and put them into jail. But then it was\nsupposed to be that the Germans take over, but there were no Germans in office yet to do that. So\nwhen I left -- when I re -- was ready to go into a hospital to -- not to have to go to Austria, I let\nthem sit in the jail, but the captain finally got their confessions and he had to do something about\nthem, so he -- he kept the confessions and he let them out to go home.

        "A: The Americans would have never arrested them. I felt very good about that.",
        "A: I -- I feel this is th-the golden opportunity.",
        "A: Well, th-the people in the -- the relatives came to my office. I didn\u2019t let them in, but they all\ntried lo, he wasn\u2019t so bad, let him home. I said -- I didn\u2019t ackn -- I ignored everything. I didn\u2019t\nlisten to anybody. I felt, let them know I\u2019m the boss. It\u2019s -- it was good feeling.",
        "A: A-And for what I went through, I deserved to be -- to -- to show them where the bo -- who the\nboss is. They never expected this to happen.",
        "A: No, no Jews came back from my village. There were some Jews 1-1n the big city, Wurzburg,\nwho had come back, whom I knew from before, and I helped them, I went there at night\nsometimes to bring them some food or something. I bought hundred pounds of flo -- white flour\nfrom a mill to bring to them so they could bake some cakes and so on. That was a different life,\nthat was not -- not part of my mission, that was human -- humanitarian.",
        "A: Oh yes, by that time they were --",
        "A: -- they were already opened and overrun and publicized. Oh yeah, they knew. In April they\noverran the first concentration camp. I never -- one of the officers said to me, I want to go to\nMunich and pass the concentration camp. I says, I was in there once, I don\u2019t want to see it. Th-\nThey wanted me to -- to drive with them I ref -- I refused, I just didn\u2019t need it -- necessary to go\nback. Another guy, he says -- 0-oh, one guy says, I need a ca -- every officer\u2019s supposed to have\na German car for the weekends when they went socializing. So he says, can you find me a car? I\nsays, give me a little time, I\u2019ll find you a car. I snooped around and I found a beautiful red\nMercedes in a vil -- in a town, covered with straw, was hidden away. So I told him, we pulled it\nout. The roof had collapsed for over the years with the weight, so I told him I have a mechanic in\nmy village, he can fix it. And we put a battery in, we drove the car out and fixed it, and then\nwhen the car was fixed he says to me, I\u2019m going to make the first trip to Garmisch where Hitler\u2019s\nheadquarters was. You want to come with me? I said no thank you. [laughs]. I -- I went to\nNuremberg to pick up my friend Raul whose letter is in your book.",
        "A: They ca -- th --",
        "A: The captain let them go. He didn\u2019t have charges against them, he -- they didn\u2019t do anything\nthe Americans. So he let them go but the papers must have gone to court that they were tried in\n1948, which is about three years later. By that time I guess the Americans had built up the\nGerman court system enough to handle something like this.",
        "A: Wa -- who --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t ask me, I was gone. I was on my way home.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t ask me, he didn\u2019t have to ask me, he could do what he wanted. Bi -- I -- y-you\n[indecipherable] when he sent me to the hospital to get quinine tablets, and I played dumb. I\nsays, I need a -- a -- a -- a -- a piece of paper telling me to get this, so he signed it for me, and\nyou know what happened to the quinine tablets.",
        "A: Yeah, ta -- th-the -- the nun in charge gave me the tablets and she explained to me how they\nshould be used. The -- the girl should sit -- the -- the girl had to be pregnant to take them. She\nshould sit in a bathtub with a few inches of water, and practice like riding a bicycle before -- and\ntake the tablets before, and that might help to have like an abortion. So I gave it to him with the\ninstructions from the nun. But I had it in writing.",
        "A: Yeah, they didn\u2019t care.",
        "A: They -- they weren\u2019t allowed to fraternize with German women. It was still forbidden.\nEisenhower had three months where no one was allowed to touch German women, so they\ncarried Holland women with them when they came from Holland to Germany, so they were not\nin bru -- had no problems.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know where they put them up, I didn\u2019t look at -- I didn\u2019t check, it didn\u2019t bother me.\nThey must have put them up someplace.",
        "A: But they carried their own women from a different country, so they couldn\u2019t be brought up on\ncharges. There was ways of doing things.",
        "A: When I left Germany, them -- I think they were still in prison, yeah, yeah. And I couldn\u2019t care\nless, I didn\u2019t want to stay around and wait til the German court system was strong enough to take\ncare of everything. But th-the -- the papers I made him sign, he must have kept on his desk and\neventually give them to the German court system.",
        "A: Each one I made sign a confession what he did the night of Kristallnacht. Yeah, I made the --\nI did that.",
        "A: Did one of them?",
        "A: Yes, they were all there.",
        "A: Ye-Yes, they were all -- they were all there in my parent\u2019s house.",
        "A: Yeah, I think so. I also must show you -- how -- how -- how long is this wire? Oh.",
        "A: Ah, I forgot something.",
        "A: While I was visiting a good German, and -- who was happy to see me, and he went into a\nroom and he came out with a little suitcase. And he said, I got something for you. He handed me\nthis and this. These were -- these were items that were used in the synagogue. This is for the\nwine cup, and this is a spice box with a candle on it that was used Saturday night to end the\nSabbath.",
        "A: He had saved it. I don\u2019t know how he got. And with it was an old book, 300 years old, a\nmemorial book from the congregation. That he gave me also, it was three items, and I treasured\nthem. I treasured them because I felt that was worth the honor to bring them home. And I did\nbring them home, and of course I showed them to my father and 1-1-it wa -- it was heartwarming\nto -- to see -- to get something like this. And I -- I w -- never would want to give it away because\nI felt I deserved it. To make the trip and spend two, three years in hell, I mean at least I deserve\nthis, and I -- it should go into a museum, but I feel I let my daughters decide what they want to\ndo with it. I will not give it away. I cleaned it, I polished it. This is silver, this 1s I don\u2019t know,\nbut --",
        "A: No, I came back on a hospital ship and I was put in a hospital on Staten Island. They were --\nall the patients went there, it was called Halloran General Hospital. And after being in there a\nday they tell you you can go home for 30 days. So they gave me a 30 day pass, that\u2019s when I\nwent home and so -- start seeing people.",
        "A: Well, it was emotional. You didn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t talk, everything was -- too much happened\nin four years. In order to split out everything, and I was very slow, and you -- you were not\nyourself yet, you had to calm down slowly. And th -- all of a sudden you wanted to see ma --\nmore people that you knew, and you were proud that you came back. And so it didn\u2019t -- it didn\u2019t\ngo that easy. It was very emotional, but I made it.",
        "A: Yeah, eventually I was able to tell them, slowly. But I already had told -- I already had told\nthem a lot in letters, because after the war ended, I was able to write home in German. And I\ncould write every night or something and s -- tell them what has happened and so on. So they\nknew a lot more already from my letters.",
        "A: You c -- they couldn\u2019t read English, so I -- that was no s -- a -- a -- I couldn\u2019t write in German\nbecause it had to go through a censor. So I couldn\u2019t communicate the way you normally\ncommunicate. That only opened up when the war ended. Next day was no more censor. That\nwent for the news reporters also.\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: But you understand what I mean? That book 1s also very valuable.",
        "A: Yeah, but when I came back --",
        "A: -- I came back it was, I think December \u201945 and I had a 30 day fa -- furlough and then I had to\ngo back to the hospital and they decided I was suffering -- besides the hearing I was suffering\nfrom arthritis for sleeping eight, nine months on the wet ground and the doctor had diagnosed it\nand they flew me to Hot Springs, Arkansas for 30 days to take the hot bath. Hot Springs,\nArkansas was the spa for polio people, and the army, navy had a big general hospital there and\nthey went -- I went there for 30 days to take the bath and it cured me of the arthritis. And after\nthat they tent -- they -- they tried to get rid of me to sign out, I said no, I want to help -- I need\nsome help with my hearing. And they sent me to a hospital in oklaho -- in Oklahoma, called\nBorden General Hospital, which was for -- for n-nose, eyes and ears. And over there they looked\nat me, they can\u2019t help much. I said, yeah, but I\u2019m here. So they also wanted to discharge me. I\nsays, I\u2019m not taking a discharge unless you give me a medical discharge. Nothing doing. So a\nweek later, some young doctor from Saint Louis, fellow looked like 30 years old, one night says\nto me, tomorrow morning if you come to this room they\u2019Il be a board meeting and I can get you\nyour medical discharge. I said, Dr., it\u2019s a deal. So I got dressed my uniform, and I appeared and\nthey passed it that I got a medical discharge. I wanted a medical discharge because I didn\u2019t want\nto go to Korea, I didn\u2019t want to go to Vietnam. So with a medical discharge I was safe.",
        "A: I figured I\u2019d put in enough time. So that\u2019s how I happened, and that\u2019s when a few -- a year or\ntwo later they gave me a 10 percent pension for the hearing. Which 1s -- I didn\u2019t fight, I just took\nit and left them alone. Now y -- now you know the story.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yes, they -- they rebuilt the synagogue to -- like a museum and they dedicated it and they\ninvited us to come and partake at the ceremony.",
        "A: Me, my brothers from Israel, my brothers from Baltimore. They invited all the people they\ncould find who -- who were related to the village one time. So we went there and that was\nalready -- the guy who wrote the book about the history, he already had finished the book. And a\ncouple of -- a week or two before, they celebrated the dedication of his book.",
        "A: Yeah, Jews in the village, so I was -- I was invited to that celebration and this fellow had quite\na few students from the university come, and a couple of professors, was a little affair. And so I\nstayed for the other celebration and I found out they didn\u2019t invite me to say anything. So I-I got\nupset and I had a conference with this author of his book, what I could do. And he wasn\u2019t invited\nto say anything either, so he says, put your foot down just before and tell Dr. so and so, if he\ndoesn\u2019t give you a chance, you\u2019re going to boycott the affair. And I did, and he said, we allow\nyou to say something. That\u2019s when I stood up and dashed it out to them in German and in\nEnglish. And they didn\u2019t like it.",
        "A: Y-Yes. I said, th-the people you destroyed suffered in the worst way possible. None of you\nstood up to help them. I -- I -- I -- I really dished it out very strongly. And there were a couple of\nnews reporters, they shook my hands afterwards and congratulated me. The people didn\u2019t like it.\nWa -- the priest sent me a letter afterwards, how dare I was to accuse his people of something\nthey had nothing to do with. I -- I told him, they were there and they could have helped people.\nAnd that was it.",
        "A: And as a matter of fact, the -- the Germans were in a building and had machines going to\nrecord it. And the Americans, NBC was there to record it and the Americans gave me -- the NBC\ngave me the tapes to take home when I flew home a week or so later. And they told me, when\nyou go through the airport, try not to go through the machines, it might destroy them. So I passed\nthe tapes outside and when I got to New York I delivered them to NBC. About 10 years later the\ngirl from the German station is -- called me in and she says, I got those tapes. I said, I'll take\nthem. But I couldn\u2019t play them, their system was different from the American system. So I\nbrought them home, three or four tapes, cassettes like yours, and about, I guess eight or 10 years\nago, when I got busy with working at Leo Beck, I told them I got some tapes. They\u2019re -- they\u2019re\nvery strong, I -- I gave it to them. I would have loved to listen to them, but they never invited me\ndown and I never reminded them, but they have them.",
        "A: Leo Beck Institute, because they wanted the history of the German speaking Jews who were\nchased out of Germany. We keep that Leo Beck going. And it is a very historic documents they\nhave. I gave them a lot of stuff. They wanted old letters, old photographs, everything. They take\nwhatever I could give them. That\u2019s how they exist. And so now -- now that\u2019s your competition.\nYou -- you are -- your museum is only what, 15 years old? I know that, I know. Wh-When it was\nfirst opened, my army outfit had a reunion in Virginia, not far from the museum, and before the\nreunion I wrote the boys from the fourth division who run the reunion, I said, the museum 1s\nopened. I\u2019d like for you to get 50 tickets for us to go and see it. And they wrote and they got 50\ntickets.",
        "A: So come Saturday morning, a couple of officers I knew, friends from Colonel Reider, they\ncornered me. We want you to take us to the museum. I said, all right, I want to go too, so we go\ntogether. I think we rode the subway over. And going in, you had to go up to the fourth floor and\nwork your way down. So they see a -- a big window with shoes and they ask me, what does this\nmean\u2019? Yo-You understand what I mean? They were Christians who had no idea what went on in\nthe camps or anyplace. So I spent three hours with them, going through the museum. I was new\nmyself, I mean, I knew the rail trucks up on the shelf -- you understand what I mean? But I\ndevoted my time to them. And they thanked me and we went back to the hotel and ate lunch. So\nnow -- so now you know.",
        "A: It was -- that was I -- an early vis -- an early visitor in the museum, unknown --",
        "A: -- if you know what I mean.",
        "A: But these fellows had no idea. They were not o-openly received, there was no one to explain\nto them. And I didn\u2019t know the museum that well, I only knew from what I read and what I saw.",
        "A: No, no --",
        "A: -- I didn\u2019t have time --",
        "A: -- I -- I needed all my energy to b -- run and build my business. That was important to me, I\nwanted to be successful and I devoted [indecipherable] in my life to the business, until I was a\nlittle -- I was more affluent when I was about 65, and then I started traveling. My business was\nslow from December 15\" to January fifth. The hospitals had parties and they had no room for me\nand I was able to go to Switzerland for a week, or go to Israel to visit my brother. And that\u2019s\nwhen I developed socially, if you know what I mean. But during the early years in life, you did\nnot recall the Holocaust so much. You did not recall what you did, you didn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t even\nfeel like talking about it sometimes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, you --",
        "A: I -- I didn\u2019t try to talk because like -- like I told you, Colonel Reider said, I -- I -- I is not the\nword. Yo-You understand?",
        "A: And I was very reluctant to speak about it. I slowly explained something to my children. I -- I\ndid go to army reunions once a year, and when I walked in the hotel -- I usually went Friday\nmornings or Sunday afternoon. And when I walked in the boys looked at me, here comes Dr.\nKissinger. And I said, but I\u2019m not playing with the same girls he\u2019s playing with. It must have\nbeen the accent that they got reminded.",
        "A: You know, in those days he was famous.",
        "A: So the boys always reminded me, here comes Dr. Kissinger.",
        "A: How many people?",
        "A: I think they all knew a little. I think they all knew. They didn\u2019t want to admit to it that they --\nthey played holy, holy, holy, as innocent. That goes for the -- for the Pope in Rome and all the\nCardinals and all the Bishops. If they didn\u2019t know they were not human beings. They must have\nknown what went on but they were scared and they didn\u2019t do anything about it. Th-th-the Pope\nsu-supported the criminals and sent them to South America to save their lives. I want to know --\nI want to send my b -- the Pope is coming next week to Washington, did you know that?",
        "A: He\u2019s get -- being wined and dined at the White House. I want to find a way to send him my\nbook. I -- I even called last night my friend who runs Der Speigel. I want to know if he as a news\nreporter 1s invited somewhere where he can hand him my book. He is a friend of mine, he was\nhere for a day to -- to tape me.",
        "A: Well, the -- why? Well, I -- fr-from what my daughters tell me, I was loaded with\ninformation. I -- I was a -- a walking library, they used to say, which was true. I observed and I\nobserved, and I didn\u2019t write it down, but I kept it. And they -- they started hinting me why I don\u2019t\nwrite things down and one led to the other and sooner or later I gave in. But they helped me to\nhire the right woman. Because before I hired her, I became very friendly with a German consul\nwho was stationed in New York, consul number two. And he was already two years in Israel and\nwe became very friendly. So -- and the wife was a -- a -- a newspaper woman. And I -- a -- she\ninvited me to her house for dinner one time, and she lived on -- on the West Side on 66\" Street.\nAnd we sat down and I said to her, how about you writing my book? She thinks about it, she\nsays, well -- I must have approached her before because that night I -- I si -- offered her 10,000\ndollars if she would write it for me. Speaks German, speaks English. Educated woman. She says\nno, I\u2019m going back to Germany. She wa -- they were transferred back to Berlin and she says even\nthough she was -- quality was there, if you know what I mean, and she was very warm and she\nwas like you, born after the war, had no -- no -- nothing to do with anybody, you know, but she\nrefused me. I couldn\u2019t do anything about it, but that\u2019s when I tried, because I felt she was\nqualified. Even if she was back in Berlin she could do it. But then my daughter found this one by\naccident. And she came and she sat there and after two hours she says, I\u2019ll take the job. And I\nsaid, send me a contract.",
        "A: I already started writing --",
        "A: -- s-stories, three pages, four pages and I started giving -- feeding her with typed stories.",
        "A: Did -- did I do what?",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Well, I -- no, I wracked my head to get the old stories together as -- as good as possible, and\nshe trimmed them, and she made questions to add. She knew how to handle it, and I was very\nsatisfied. I -- now I feel there\u2019s three, four more stories should have been in, but there was a time\nlimit, when she said enough is enough, we\u2019re going to finish it the way it is. And that\u2019s when I\ngave you that big book.",
        "A: She used that, I think. She must have sent it to the publisher or something.",
        "A: But I felt it was a good book, but when the letters came in and people come and -- and the\nmost unusual, there\u2019s some Germans here in New York [indecipherable] and other people who\ngot hold of the book and they came and they admired it. And when I sent a draft to the consul\nbecause I -- I wanted opinions, 1f you understand what I mean, so the consul came back to\nAmerica for four years to -- to Houston, Texas, and once -- first time he was here he came to\nNew York, we had lunch together and I sent him a draft. And he said it\u2019s beautiful. He says, the\nnicest part is the way you carried yourself when you went back into your home village. So\neverybody picks something different that shakes him. So I felt good to get an opinion like that, if\nyou -- you understand. Because the German opinion to me is worth also, and they should be\nheard now, because this is a different generation two generations away from the Nazis. And --\nand they -- they -- they claim it could never happen again, they say. We don\u2019t know. There\u2019s still\nanti-Semitism in Germany today and there\u2019s a new group coming up. I got, month ago, a German\nmagazine called Deutsche [indecipherable]. How did I get it? I have a friend in New Jersey, he\u2019s\nlike me, he\u2019s practically the same age. And some of his friends in Germany sent him the\nmagazine and he went through the magazine and in it he found an article about me, in the\nmagazine, in German. So I read it, and I -- I started -- I told my bankers friend from Germany\nand one of them said, oh I know the magazine, that\u2019s on the right side. They are not mine -- they\nare not broadminded like we are. So I already know what he meant. He said, they are not leftists,\nthey are rightists. So -- but it -- the article is from the wall str -- not the Wall Street there, from\nthe New York Times. They -- they practically copied it. And I called the guy who wrote the\narticle, he says only the Times can sue him for copyright. I didn\u2019t write to the Times. But it\nshows you what goes on and to me, for the Germans, it\u2019s important that they read what goes on.\nTh-They wouldn\u2019t buy this book if a German wrote it, 1-1f you know what I mean.",
        "A: Because they feel that he was on D-Day, he\u2019s an American, he knows what he is talking\nabout. I feel that\u2019s why they want to buy it. The ber -- Bavarian government\u2019s supposed to buy it\nand put it in some of their libraries. A woman I spoke to but so far she hasn\u2019t cal-called me and t\n-- how many copies she wants. But for th -- for them it\u2019s important to -- to have the relations\nwarm up again. They invited me, they dedi -- dedicated the Jewish museum in Nuremberg, 1987\nthey invited me and sent me books and everything. And so they -- they recognize that they need\nus to help them, if you understand what I mean. The -- the -- the -- the people -- the Bavarian\ngovernment, about six, eight months ago, wrote me -- I wrote to them, they wrote me a letter\nback and they sent me a booklet about Dachau. All th-the pictures, everything about Dachau. I --\nI got excited and I said to myself, I\u2019m not keeping this in my house, I don\u2019t want my daughters to\nsee it. I took it to the local congressman and told him he can put it in any library he wants, I don\u2019t\nwant to see it. Now, he refuses to give me a receipt for it that I can take a tax deduction. I also\ngave him a copy of my book.",
        "A: I -- I felt -- 1t excited me so much, they shouldn\u2019t see it, what I went through.",
        "A: No, I didn't tell them that I got that book.",
        "A: Well, they know I was in concentration camp.",
        "A: That\u2019s all, yeah. But that book described to -- the meat hooks, everything. Shows you\neverything in the place, and I just couldn\u2019t take it. That\u2019s how I felt. I -- 1f you want the book I\ngive you the address in Germany where you can a -- write for a copy.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah. But I couldn\u2019t stomach it.",
        "A: Too -- too many memories. Wh-When you see the barracks and everything, I couldn\u2019t take it.\nI didn\u2019t want to keep it in my house, not even a week. So I\u2019m telling you the truth.",
        "A: Is there long --",
        "A: There is enough for another book, but I\u2019m not ready for one. I feel that there\u2019s some -- some\ngood stories that only wake up after the book was out, if you know what I mean. But it -- it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s not that important that I write it down. I wrote up enough the important parts. Like now I\nhave to do work with the lady whose letter I showed you. I could put in more in her book if I\nwanted to. Th-That will be an important book, if you know what -- I feel that she might give me\nhalf of the book if I let her.",
        "A: I might need your help.",
        "A: She would love -- I think she would love to sit in here.\nQ2: [indecipherable] minutes left on this tape.",

        "A: This is the p -- the p -- the passport that I got after being released from the concentration camp\nin order to leave Germany. The -- the man who signed it, who had the power, was very\nmiserable, and he looked for all kinds of excuses not to give it to you, even though the consul\nhad written that they want me to appear with a passport. When I came back and was stationed in\nthe town, I sent people up to tr -- and I needed a bed to sleep in, and had them remove his own\nbed to bring to my new quarters in Ochsenfurt. I didn\u2019t care if he slept on the floor or not, but I\nfixed him up then.",
        "A: The K is that you\u2019re a Jew. The red K, they put that in every passport so you couldn\u2019t say\nyou\u2019re -- it\u2019s not yours. That was only done -- about 1938 they started to issue a red K into every\nJewish passport.",

        "A: This is the house, it used to be called a castle. I believe it was built 1717. It had a weapon at\nthe front entrance and it was originally surrounded by water. There were a couple of little\nstreams going around the building, and they -- the village bought it from my father for a very low\nprice. They wanted to put the schoolhouse -- a school in there. And then the war started, they\ndidn\u2019t do anything with it except they rented out the rooms. And then, after awhile, they used it\nto put in 50 French pe -- Frenchmen who were forced to work on the farms. And they were\nlocked in at eight o\u2019clock at night and the gendarme came in the morning to open it up to go to\nwork. They were very badly treated by the farmers and I don\u2019t know what they did when they\nwere free, but from what I understand they killed a couple of pigs and started to live up a little\nbit.",
        "A: Yea, this is the house they came, they destroyed every window, every closet, every bed was\nslice -- slit open. That was completely in shambles.",
        "A: No, this was right after the war. It looks very dilapidated and it must have been taken after the\nwar ended, I don\u2019t know. Maybe I took it, because I had a camera with me sometimes. It\u2019s very\npossible that I took this picture myself.",
        "A: No, no --",
        "A: -- the house didn\u2019t have a name. It was part of a -- some kind of a family and they had 16\nsmall homes around it, where poor people were living. First there were the Jews in -- it\u2019s writ --\nit\u2019s written up in this fellow\u2019s book, and --",
        "A: It was a castle, yeah, and the walls were thick tha -- you couldn\u2019t do anything. All brick --\nheavy stone, no brick, no veneer. Everything was heavy. And the windows were big and it was a\nvery strong house. And there were 16 smaller homes around it and some of them fell apart, but\nthe Germans rebuild them the way they were hundred years ago, and the people are living in\nthem now.",
        "A: Yes, I had my own room in the house. The upstairs was no heat. It was cold in the winter with\none big stove downstairs in the living room and one bedroom, and the kitchen had the stove to\ncook on. It was not the most comfortable house.",
        "A: It was a big house, yes.",
        "A: The rooms were big, was solidly built. Very big house. And then after the war, maybe eight or\n10 years later, the Germans re-bought it, and they paid more money to my father and they tore it\ndown and put a schoolhouse up on that place. That\u2019s how it worked.",
        "A: Aft-After the -- we finished the basic training, that was nine -- three months, 90 days, w-we --\nwe were a group of non-citizens, we were aliens and they took us -- loaded us on a truck and\ntook us to Macon, Georgia where there was a federal court building and we were taken into a\nroom and there appeared a judge who swore us in as American citizens. You didn\u2019t have to pass\nany tests or anything, the uniform was your weapon that you will pass. That was the happy\nmoment in the life of being in the American Army.",

        "A: Ready?",
        "A: This is Colonel Gaitling, we became very good friends. This was in a rough time of the\nwinter, I can see the boots he was wearing. They were hard to get by, but it probably was in\nHuertgen forest, it looks like all -- all trees around it. He was a gentleman and very human and\nvery kind and very considerate. I never forget that we -- we broke out of Normandy and we hit\nthe first French town and there was a little restaurant on the side, and he sent me in to buy a\nlunch. He was outside on the bench and ate a K-ration. And when I got inside I found my friend\nSalinger and John Keenan sitting at the counter eating already, so I joined them. We were at\nhome, we were cle -- happy together. This colonel was a very outstanding soldier. He -- he\ngraduated from the Virginia Military Institute, which is as good as West Point. Then he\ngraduated Columbia Law School and he was working for a big law firm, a [indecipherable] law\nfirm on broad -- on Wall Street in New York. He never told us where he was working. The boss\nat the Wall Street firm became Secretary of the Army under President Franklin Roosevelt. With\none letter he could have been sitting in Washington for the duration, but he was too much of a\nsoldier to let anybody know who he was. He st -- he was British descent, and he was very, very\nwarm with you. You couldn\u2019t help it but respect him. The first or second night in France, he\nwent on a -- he went to visit Sainte M\u00e9re Eglise, the first [indecipherable] where the paratroopers\nhad dropped in, and while he was gone, I started t-to dig a foxhole for him, I was finished\ndigging mine. And when he came back midnight, he scolded me because he doesn\u2019t allow me to\nbig -- dig a foxhole for him, he\u2019s digging his own foxholes. So I apologized and I said, next time\nI know. He was very, very considerate. He want to make sure you eat and you clean and\neverything that needed for you to be care of. He never cared about anything special in his\nuniform. He wore the same clothes we were wearing, and every time we got into a new\ncommand post what [indecipherable] being called, he walked around and looked if there was a\nlittle stream. When he found one, he found a -- a private corner, he took his uniform off and gave\nhimself a -- a bath in the ice cold water. I couldn\u2019t have done that, but he did every time we hit a\nnew som -- CP. He was very articulate and he was very easy and warm to be with. Fortunately, I\nwas able to contact him after the war. When I bought my house, I approached him and he ba --\nhe made the contract and title for me. He hardly took any money. And then, of course, we were -\n- became friends. We stayed together til he passed away in 1980-something. I went to his house\nthree, four times a year for dinner. We had wonderful times together. And I went down to the\nWall Street firm and we had lunch together. It was an unusual friendship and we always find\nsomething to discuss and -- and -- and -- and enlighten us about things what have happened. One\nof the big things that happened was in my -- when I was in a K company, 22\" infantry, there was\na big fuss, to-do, north against south. The southern boys, the hillbillies accused a couple of\nnorthern fellows for not leading a normal life, sexually. And they accused them, and the -- the\ncompany commander was brainwashed by those fellows, and he more or less listened to them.\nSo he -- he took the accused fellow and put him into a stockade, and started bringing charges.\nAnother sergeant whom I knew very well, of -- a very good friend of mine who was supply\nsergeant, he was a friend of the accused and he went to another regiment to find a lawyer to sup -\n- to s -- defend this fellow. So he went to the 12\" regiment and found Colonel Gaitling. He was\nthen a captain, I believe, but he was a lawyer and had th-the best of degrees. So Colonel Gaitling\ntook the case and they brought in a very g -- big court martial. They came down from corps to\nhandle it, they had armed guards around the building and everything. And when he did his\nresearch, he found a woman in Augusta who would swear and had the experience that she slept\nwith that fellow.",
        "A: I don\u2019t want to mention his name, there may be relatives listening to it. And whenever I asked\nthe colonel to write this down for me because my language was not ready foras--a--as--a\ncase like this, he always told me, Kleeman, it is too spicy. I -- I reminded him every time I came\nto his house to please write it down for me, and he said it\u2019s too spicy. He refused, he -- he kept a\ndiary of his life in the division and he did not write this accident into his diary. I -- I couldn\u2019t get\nangry at him, but he was just too much. He produced a woman at the court martial that testified\nshe slept with this fellow and the case was dismissed.",
        "A: The captain was sent out to Fort Benning as a punishment and the first sergeant was removed\nfrom the company, and there was a big shake-up in the regiment, because he knew how to handle\nit. He was a de-definite fine lawyer and he knew that this -- the fellow was not guilty.",
        "A: You can\u2019t believe what went on in the army. I told you many times I said, the -- the Caine\nMutiny was a case like this and they brought a film out of it, why can\u2019t you write it up? He says,\ntoo spicy. He never told his wife about it, he never told his son and daughter about it. I\u2019m the\nonly man who questioned him about this all the time. But I was not a -- I was not successful. I --\nI feel to this day it should have been publicized. Th-The -- the fellow eventually got a discharge\nand got home and everybody was fine. We got a new captain in the army, a young fellow, and\nhe\u2019s -- he\u2019s -- when he came in he says, I\u2019m a tough son-of-a-bitch, you boys better behave.\n[laughs]",
        "A: You\u2019re laughing.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s better to make you laugh than to cry.",
        "A: There\u2019s a [indecipherable] Theodore Roosevelt, he is the son of the first President Roosevelt.\nHe was 57 years old and didn\u2019t have to be in a war, but he insisted on being there. He was first\nserving in Africa and then he came back to England and they assigned him to help guide the\nFourth Division. He was a down to earth soldier who was in World War I already, and he was a\nregular fellow. He never wore unif -- leggings or anything like that. He did not want to show off\nthat he is anything different. He always walked with a cane and was a very unusual man. He\ninsisted on landing on the beach in -- in Normandy, or -- in the first hour to guide the boys. He\nfelt his presence there would stimulate them to go and march in -- into the country fast. So he\nwas there from the morning on and when them -- there\u2019s a gu -- fellow lawyer I know who wrote\na book about him, and in a letter home he wrote to his wife, I must have hiked 20 miles the first\nday up and down the beach to get the boys to move inland.",
        "A: For his work there he got the Congressional Medal of Honor, but he didn't live to see it\nbecause he died in Normandy of a heart attack about five or six weeks after the landing. His son\nwas the captain in the First Division and also landed on D-Day. And it was when the Utah beach\nwas hooked up with Omaha beach, the son came over to visit the father in the evening --\nafternoon about six o\u2019clock. And they spent two hours together and this must have excited the\nfather so much that within an hour he had a heart attack and passed away. A very s-sad story, but\nit so happened wi -- and about 10 - 12 years ago I got an invitation for a Kristallnacht celebration\nin Brooklyn and the invitation said, the German consul will be there, and re -- ru -- Teddy\nRoosevelt the fourth will be there. So I packed up my history books with him in it and my two\ndaughters and we traveled to Brooklyn and I met the fo -- the -- both the consul and this -- the --\nthe grandson. I opened my books for him and he couldn\u2019t believe it. When he passed away, they\nnever sent any material home what he possessed. And I le -- gave -- I told him I would take care\nof him. I finally got a history book, a D-Day book and a -- and I -- th-the Gaitling children gave\nme his map from D-Day, which I should show you a copy of it, which was a masterpiece, and I\ndonated that map to the Roosevelt Museum in Oyster Bay, which is the home of the first\npresident.

At the -- he\nalways bragged that he is going to throw any invader back into the sea within 24 hours and we\nwere afraid he might have power. But they didn\u2019t give him enough troops to really defend that\ncoast, and Hitler had three or four Panther Divisions about a hundred miles away from the front,\nand he didn\u2019t release them the first or second day, and no general had the power to order them to\ncome to the beach. So what really happened, the German command failed to realize that the\nallies are -- are going to be there to stay, and that the -- the tanks from the German army were\nsitting in the mi-middle of France someplace and they couldn\u2019t move. When they did start\nmoving, the American Air Force came and put the hell out of them as they were traveling on a\nhighway. It was so bad that they gave up and only traveled at night.
