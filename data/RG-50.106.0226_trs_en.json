The children when they graduated from high school they got into Brandeis and one\nson went to the University of Connecticut. So when they were at Brandeis they made friends of\ncourse and they, that was where they settled and they just felt at home and why else would they\ngo somewhere else. They felt. And then why else would where\u2019d we go. So we settled in\nBrookline also for the same reason. Cause we have four grandchildren now.

I lost my whole family.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 25, 2014\nCarol: Interestingly there was a fellow in his house, his house where he was living before he was\ntaken away by the name of Leventhal, Zalman Leventhal. And it\u2019s strange by coincidence this\nfellow became a Sondercommander at Auschwitz. I think he was in charge of putting dead\nbodies into the crematorium. And this is a fellow that Marc temporarily went to school with. But\neventually he was murdered and then also he wrote a lot of information. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a lot\nof information. But he wrote information and hid it around the concentration camp. So he must\nhave left a little bit of a legacy but it can be seen and there\u2019s a mention of this Zalman Leventhal\nin the Auschwitz album. I don\u2019t know if you know about that.

I mean not that there was anything unlikeable about these other\npeople. But maybe they thought they would have a better chance at surviving. And Marc was\nvery weak and so he was in this, what they called a hospital. But it wasn\u2019t and there was no\nmedicine or care. But this Dr. Rusa was in charge and he called Marc and told him to please\ncome in and he would help take care of him. And so then he came to Marc.

That you saw the prisoners eating. Now Marc says that nobody\nsat down. They weren\u2019t allowed to sit down while they ate. They all had to stand around and eat.\nBut that just goes to show the inhumanity of these people. They were sadist. They were very\nsadistic. They were pathological murderers and criminals. They were sociopaths and\npsychopaths. And this 1s the existence they had to live among. These crazy hateful people.",
        "A: Thad, Jewish people, very nice people that were my friends. All the nice people were friends.\nCarol: But as a matter of fact, an interesting also an interesting situation is especially during the\nwar when we were married at the end of the 50s, we didn\u2019t know whether to buy German\nproducts or not. A lot of Jews were not doing it. In fact I even came across someone recently\nwho won\u2019t buy at Trader Joe. I don\u2019t\u2019 know if you have a Trader Joe in your neighborhood. They\nwill not buy a British, German goods and so Marc said that well the state of Israel buys its buses\nand trucks and a lot of their Volkswagens from Germany so not that he was suggesting that we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 25, 2014\nnot buy from Germany. But it seems to be that that phase is over now. And Germany is one of\nIsrael\u2019s good friends. They don\u2019t have very many friends in Europe any more, or even in China.\nThere is a lot of anti-Semitism. And so \u2014",
        "A: I get that sub \u2014\nCarol: Yes, Marc said that Germany didn\u2019t suffer enough. The Germans didn\u2019t suffer enough.\nAnd they didn\u2019t. They just walked home after the war. Only a few of them were hung at the\nEichmann trial and a few other places. But they didn\u2019t suffer enough.",

        "A: You have better \u2014\nCarol: Ok our oldest son\u2019s name is Steven. I know this is a Christian name which is a popular\nname among Jews because there are so many Shmuels around and so we, since our last name\nwas Samuels, and Marc wanted to call him Samuel, Samuels. That\u2019s what his name would have\nbeen. I said nothing doing. He said I hate you when he gets older for naming him Samuel\nSamuels, although it strangely enough Marc was, my son Steve was helping out, he was an\nassistant to a librarian at Brandeis and he came across the name Samuel Samuels. Then he came\nacross the middle initial S in the middle. Samuel S Samuels. And then eventually he found out\nthat the guy\u2019s name was Samuel, Samuel, Samuels. That doesn\u2019t even sound possible but he\nwasn\u2019t joking either. But I refused to name him Samuel with the last name of Samuels. So we\ncalled him Steven for that reason.\nAnd then Steven. Jonas which was the brother who was killed in Auschwitz, who gave him this\ncrust of bread, gave Marc this crust of bread and then was killed. And then, oh yes he was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 25, 2014\nbeaten up and they took his boots away. I don\u2019t know if Marc mentioned that to you. Took his\nboots away and then they beat him up. And then he was gassed or whatever they do.",

        "A: He was murdered in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: And your other children\u2019s names.\nCarol: Oh yes, oh that\u2019s right. So that Steven Jonas Samuels. And Jonathan Gabriel Samuels.\nGabriel was my grandfather\u2019s name. Jonathan sounds like Jonas and so I kind of snuck that in\ncause you are not supposed to give the same name to your children. So in Johan\u2019s time. Then\nDavid. I always liked the name David. It\u2019s just the ultimate Jewish name. I feel the Jewish, the\nmost meaningful Jewish name I think. So David Michael. Since Jonathan\u2019s middle name is\nGabriel. I have one angel. I named David, David Michael, the other angel. And then Debby is\nMarc\u2019s, Marc\u2019s mother. Deborah, Devora. So she has the name of Devora. Let\u2019s see.",
        "A: She\u2019s a professor in the college, in Wheelock college here.\nCarol: Yes, Wheelock College. She just came back from Italy and she was also in Munich\nteaching the Holocaust. This is her second trip in the course at Wheelock College. It was highly\ninteresting and she got a lot of students to go with her.",
        "Q: Have you worked?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 25, 2014\nCarol: I personally. No because I was filled with kids and also there were a lot of synagogue\nthings I had to go to. All the bar mitzvahs and the Hadassah and the Sisterhood, and the\nSisterhood board, the Hadassah board. And this goes on and on. People who invite you which is\nvery nice but enough is enough. So I didn\u2019t, but I did go to school at night. I didn\u2019t go to, I\ndidn\u2019t graduate college because my parents just didn\u2019t have the money. My father was divorced\nand their parents were divorced so they had their separate families. So it took me about ten years\nor more, 12 years to get my bachelor\u2019s degree at the University of Pittsburgh when we were in\nWashington, Pennsylvania. And then we moved and so we were in the Springfield area. And I\nwent to the University of Massachusetts and I finished my degree.\nOh yes, I got a degree from the University of Pittsburgh in English and I got a master of arts in\nteaching at the University of Massachusetts which is now a very good state school. And then I\nhad nothing to do when we went to Connecticut. Willimantic Connecticut, Emanuel center. So I\ngot another degree, a bachelor of fine arts this time in graphic design. So I\u2019ve kept myself busy at\nnight but not to get too involved with his work.",

        "A: Grandchildren, they\u2019re very young now.\nCarol: Nobody is really interested in becoming a rabbi and not only that but we\u2019re very\ndisappointed that they don\u2019t even take books out of this very large library. Marc donate more\nthan 1500 books to the University of Connecticut, where he taught by the way and we still have\nover about 1600 books left right now in our very small apartment. So we really don\u2019t know what\nto do about that. So we have one of the largest book collections that any Judaica library has.\nAnd it\u2019s called the Rabbi Marc E. Samuels Judaica collection. Yes. So they\u2019re not interested for\nsome reason. Of course they\u2019re very young now. But they probably will be interested later on but\nwe still don\u2019t know what to do with them.

Is there anything else you wanted to add or do you feel you\u2019ve said \u2014\nCarol: Yes, about Germany today. Years ago Marc mentioned the fact that the Germans of today\nare not necessarily the way they were or not the same country as it was. And that you can\u2019t\nblame Germany, German people today at least most of them. There\u2019s always anti-Semites\naround. That you can\u2019t get mad at them. They had nothing to do with it. But the fact that they\nare supportive of Israel is a very good, it\u2019s a good sign.

        "A: We were there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 25, 2014\nCarol: No I don\u2019t think when we were there. There\u2019s a more recent building perhaps. I don\u2019t\nknow. Maybe we did. I think we did, I think we did.",
        "A: Yad Vashem.",
        "A: I might. I don\u2019t know.\nCarol: There\u2019s one thing. It\u2019s not important but it seems that there are certain people who were\nbetter liked than other people. I mean not that there was anything unlikeable about these other\npeople. But maybe they thought they would have a better chance at surviving. And Marc was\nvery weak and so he was in this, what they called a hospital. But it wasn\u2019t and there was no\nmedicine or care. But this Dr. Rusa was in charge and he called Marc and told him to please\ncome in and he would help take care of him. And so then he came to Marc. I don\u2019t know how\nmany days later, a few days later maybe, and said Marc get ready to leave because the guards are\ngoing to come and make a selection.",
        "A: That was in camp.\nCarol: Yes, that\u2019s right that was in camp and so they quickly hustled Marc out of there and then\nof course the guards picked out whoever they wanted.",
        "A: That was in Golleschau.\nCarol: That helped Marc to survive, to have friends. And I get by with my little friends.",
        "A: Thad a lot of friends too, there.\nCarol: With help from his friends.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 25, 2014",
        "A: You go home and suddenly you know to be ready tell us \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No you know but most people lived in our house because they put in families in addition to\nour own families. We only had three rooms and they put in neighbors because they took the,\nthey take for themselves.\nCarol: And by the way Schindler\u2019s list and sometimes there might, probably are other movies\nwhich touched on the Holocaust. That you saw the prisoners eating. Now Marc says that nobody\nsat down. They weren\u2019t allowed to sit down while they ate. They all had to stand around and eat.\nBut that just goes to show the inhumanity of these people. They were sadist. They were very\nsadistic. They were pathological murderers and criminals. They were sociopaths and\npsychopaths. And this 1s the existence they had to live among. These crazy hateful people.",
        "A: Thad, Jewish people, very nice people that were my friends. All the nice people were friends.\nCarol: But as a matter of fact, an interesting also an interesting situation is especially during the\nwar when we were married at the end of the 50s, we didn\u2019t know whether to buy German\nproducts or not. A lot of Jews were not doing it. In fact I even came across someone recently\nwho won\u2019t buy at Trader Joe. I don\u2019t\u2019 know if you have a Trader Joe in your neighborhood. They\nwill not buy a British, German goods and so Marc said that well the state of Israel buys its buses\nand trucks and a lot of their Volkswagens from Germany so not that he was suggesting that we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 25, 2014\nnot buy from Germany. But it seems to be that that phase is over now. And Germany is one of\nIsrael\u2019s good friends. They don\u2019t have very many friends in Europe any more, or even in China.\nThere is a lot of anti-Semitism. And so \u2014",
        "A: I get that sub \u2014\nCarol: Yes, Marc said that Germany didn\u2019t suffer enough. The Germans didn\u2019t suffer enough.\nAnd they didn\u2019t. They just walked home after the war. Only a few of them were hung at the\nEichmann trial and a few other places. But they didn\u2019t suffer enough.",
        "A: Of course you know they all committed suicide.",
        "A: You have better \u2014\nCarol: Ok our oldest son\u2019s name is Steven. I know this is a Christian name which is a popular\nname among Jews because there are so many Shmuels around and so we, since our last name\nwas Samuels, and Marc wanted to call him Samuel, Samuels. That\u2019s what his name would have\nbeen. I said nothing doing. He said I hate you when he gets older for naming him Samuel\nSamuels, although it strangely enough Marc was, my son Steve was helping out, he was an\nassistant to a librarian at Brandeis and he came across the name Samuel Samuels. Then he came\nacross the middle initial S in the middle. Samuel S Samuels. And then eventually he found out\nthat the guy\u2019s name was Samuel, Samuel, Samuels. That doesn\u2019t even sound possible but he\nwasn\u2019t joking either. But I refused to name him Samuel with the last name of Samuels. So we\ncalled him Steven for that reason.\nAnd then Steven. Jonas which was the brother who was killed in Auschwitz, who gave him this\ncrust of bread, gave Marc this crust of bread and then was killed. And then, oh yes he was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 25, 2014\nbeaten up and they took his boots away. I don\u2019t know if Marc mentioned that to you. Took his\nboots away and then they beat him up. And then he was gassed or whatever they do.",
        "A: He was murdered in Auschwitz.",
        "A: She\u2019s a professor in the college, in Wheelock college here.\nCarol: Yes, Wheelock College. She just came back from Italy and she was also in Munich\nteaching the Holocaust. This is her second trip in the course at Wheelock College. It was highly\ninteresting and she got a lot of students to go with her.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 25, 2014\nCarol: I personally. No because I was filled with kids and also there were a lot of synagogue\nthings I had to go to. All the bar mitzvahs and the Hadassah and the Sisterhood, and the\nSisterhood board, the Hadassah board. And this goes on and on. People who invite you which is\nvery nice but enough is enough. So I didn\u2019t, but I did go to school at night. I didn\u2019t go to, I\ndidn\u2019t graduate college because my parents just didn\u2019t have the money. My father was divorced\nand their parents were divorced so they had their separate families. So it took me about ten years\nor more, 12 years to get my bachelor\u2019s degree at the University of Pittsburgh when we were in\nWashington, Pennsylvania. And then we moved and so we were in the Springfield area. And I\nwent to the University of Massachusetts and I finished my degree.\nOh yes, I got a degree from the University of Pittsburgh in English and I got a master of arts in\nteaching at the University of Massachusetts which is now a very good state school. And then I\nhad nothing to do when we went to Connecticut. Willimantic Connecticut, Emanuel center. So I\ngot another degree, a bachelor of fine arts this time in graphic design. So I\u2019ve kept myself busy at\nnight but not to get too involved with his work.",
        "A: Grandchildren, they\u2019re very young now.\nCarol: Nobody is really interested in becoming a rabbi and not only that but we\u2019re very\ndisappointed that they don\u2019t even take books out of this very large library. Marc donate more\nthan 1500 books to the University of Connecticut, where he taught by the way and we still have\nover about 1600 books left right now in our very small apartment. So we really don\u2019t know what\nto do about that. So we have one of the largest book collections that any Judaica library has.\nAnd it\u2019s called the Rabbi Marc E. Samuels Judaica collection. Yes. So they\u2019re not interested for\nsome reason. Of course they\u2019re very young now. But they probably will be interested later on but\nwe still don\u2019t know what to do with them. We moved into assisted living.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJuly 25, 2014",

But when they got to the camps there was no way that\nthey could hide it anymore. And it was useless anyway. You couldn\u2019t buy your way out. They\u2019d\nkill you anyway, after taking the money.",
