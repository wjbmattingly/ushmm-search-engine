On\nSeptember second, if I am not wrong to the dates, about I can be day or two off, the\nbomb hit the back of the building and destroyed everything what was in the back. If\nI say back, in Poland usually the apartments had the front entrance and the back\nentrance, you know, for deliveries and maids was from the back and from the front.\nSo everything from back, no more entrance through the maid. This \u2014 she was there,\nI think \u2014 the maid was, a day or two more after this bombing and she decided to go\nback to neighborhood of Kielce, which usually my mother was sending the maids\nbeing sure that they are the right ones, she went back and I found myself in this\napartment, waiting until they would come. In meantime I found out that my brother-\nin-law was already in the service, and my sister came few days later with the both\ngirls, and \u2014 yeah. Then a few days later again SS came, high officers of SS, and \u2014",

So she kept this coat, my sisters kept the coat in the closet and when\nhe looked, saw the officer\u2019s coat, she told him that that\u2019s what she got from\nsomebody who brought this. And then he changed for a moment and he said that he\nwill be \u2014 in few days the people will come and will confiscate everything. He\ndoesn\u2019t want to write anything, whatever they will find, they will confiscate. And\nthey left, and my sister sold everything almost, in the next two days, or was giving\naway, but to get rid. And really when they came, they didn\u2019t have too much to take\nit out.",

        "Q: Closet?",
        "A: The safe.",
        "Q: Safe.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: And in the safe he took out only a one pin, diamond pin, put on his uniform and\nsaid looks nice, and of course then put back. But I think that this officer coat saved\nthis time my sister. And later, I wasn\u2019t there when they came to confiscate, but I\nfound out that they didn\u2019t because wasn\u2019t any more.",
        "Q: Then where did you go?",
        "A: Then I decided that I will go and find out if my father \u2014 if my brother-in-law is\ndead and my sister is alone, or I will find him and I will bring back. And I decided\nto go to the Russian side. Poland was divided this time. And because he was, before\nhe became a lawyer, he was a judge in the town of Bialystok, which probably you\nheard about, so \u2014",
        "Q: What was your brother-in-law\u2019s name?",
        "A: Nathan(ph) Erlich(ph). And so I decided to go there and to find out if anybody\nheard, and I found him there. He had just came from hospital. The coat was brought\nby a friend, also an officer, who was almost sure that he is dead and couldn\u2019t face\nmy sister, so he left the coat there and he took off the bandages. We went to make a\npicture and with this picture I came back to my sister and we were there for quite\nawhile until my brother came from Kielce. Left the parents and came there because\nparents sent some money for my sister and for my brother-in-law who was still in\nBialystok. So we decided that we\u2019ll go there and deliver this money. It wasn\u2019t so\nOctober 7, 1993\nsimple crossing the border, neither with Germans or Russians, so we split the\nmoney between, but we delivered money together.",
        "Q: We?",
        "A: We, my brother and myself and we were separated for a moment, but we found\nourself. My brother \u2014 I left my brother there, together with my brother-in-law and I\nwent back to Warsaw because I didn't want my sister to be alone. Even that two of\nthe sisters who were just then together. And because they had only two daughters,\nso they were only girls, so I decided that I will go because this side \u2014 my brother-in-\nlaw was not in condition to come. Just before war started between Russians and\nGermans, they came, they left Russian side and they came back to Warsaw and my\nbrother left right away for my parents to Kielce and were there. And later was\nchanging, we needed to give up the apartments because they were moving people to\nghetto, which was \u2014",
        "Q: This is in Kielce now?",
        "A: This is Warsaw.",
        "Q: Oh, now you're talking about Warsaw, right.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, I\u2019m talking more now here about myself than I am talking\nabout the \u2014 the reason I am here, to talk about the Germans. And I hate to talk about\nmyself, this reminds me always, you know, when you\u2019re going to the bank and you\nOctober 7, 1993\nwant the loan, you need to show off how ri-rich you are, and believe me I wasn\u2019t a\nhero during the war. I was more a coward than \u2014 than a hero, so I hate to talk about,\nbut I know that the \u2014 I went to Kielce to visit my parents \u2014 this is, I\u2019m backing up\nnow a little bit and this needed to be in 1940 and I was there for a few days only \u2014 I\ndecided to be only for a few days, but in this few days I went to visit my friends\nfrom school, and of course when I visited them, they hated to see that I am wearing\nthe Jewish \u2014 because they were not Jews, so they told me to take off, and with them,\nthey don\u2019t see the difference. And \u2014 and I spent out \u2014",
        "Q: Jewish star you\u2019re talking about?",
        "A: The Jewish star which we were wearing. And I took off and I \u2014 I was with them\nand when I left them, I forgot that I had the star in my pocket and two regular\nGerman soldiers, not SS, stopped me and I don\u2019t know how \u2014 oh no, no, I know \u2014\nnow I didn\u2019t know how, but now I know. Two soldiers, German, were walking and\nI remind myself this time that I didn\u2019t put, so I put my hand in the pocket and I put\non. They saw this and they stopped me and they pushed me in their hallway and\nthey asked for money. But I didn\u2019t have too much and I offered them also a watch,\nand this was not enough. So I told them that if they will walk with me home, I will\ngive from my parents, I will get money and I will give. And that\u2019s what it was, I\nwas going in front, they were walking behind. An SS stopped three of us, there\u2019s\nOctober 7, 1993\ntwo soldiers and them, asking why they are walking behind this Jew. So they told\nhim that, so they were arrested by SS for mixing in, and I was arrested for not\nwearing the \u2014 the s \u2014 this was, by law, even that you could be sentenced for death.\nBut my parents used the intervention of my ex-German teacher, who was married to\na Italian foreign diplomat, and they went to her, and she was able to pull me out\nfrom the jail. I was only two days in jail. And I left, of course, Kielce the day after,\nit was my accident \u2014 experience was \u2014",
        "Q: Le-Let\u2019s go back a little bit, you \u2014 you were \u2014 came back to be with your sister.\nWe jumped ahead a little bit, and you had seen your brother [indecipherable] came\nback.",
        "A: Yeah, they had the beautiful apartment in [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay, and then \u2014 and then what happened to \u2014",
        "A: Everybody needed to start to move, to give up this apartment, but it was time\nthat they permitted you to exchange, so that \u2014",
        "Q: Is this still 1939?",
        "A: No, 1941. \u201940 - \u00b041.",
        "Q: Oh, okay, but you had visited your \u2014 your brother-in-law and then came back to\nbe with your sister. I\u2019m moving behi \u2014 back \u2014 back again.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: No, no, no, when \u2014 we talking about when the brother-in-law came back, they\nwere together and I was together with them.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So he came back to his apartment.",
        "Q: He did come back, okay.",
        "A: Oh yes, and my brother only went to bi \u2014 to the parents, to Kielce. He was \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, and then did you stay living with your brother-in-law, and \u2014",
        "A: And my sister and my two nieces.",
        "Q: And what did you do?",
        "A: As a matter of fact, who \u2014 we\u2019re funny [indecipherable]. Many Jewish people\nwanted to sell their properties. Of course, not to Jewish people who were buying.\nNow, if this deal would be made after the Germans came, wouldn\u2019t be legal. So\nwhat was done, that was predated that it started before the war, it started some time\nin 1939, and then didn\u2019t finish, and in the beginning of the 1939, when war started,\nit means on end of ni \u2014 \u201939, by picking up mutual guy was sign as an agreement to\nfill. I was the guy whose supposed to be the guy who signed his own papers. So of\ncourse this way they were getting quite cheap the properties. Our friends were\ngetting the money and we\u2019re getting our pay for it. And that\u2019s what was a living\ncontinuously scared. From time to time they were catching us, the Germans were\nOctober 7, 1993\ncatching on the street and taking to labor. Sometimes one day only and sometimes\nwas a few days and a few nights.",
        "Q: Did anything happen to you in 1940 in \u2014",
        "A: Yes, I was caught a few times to \u2014 to work.",

        "A: But \u2014 Warsaw, everything Warsaw, or in \u2014 or around Warsaw. They \u2014 this\ntime they were taking us by trucks and bringing back the \u2014",
        "Q: Where were you living? Were you still living with your sister?",
        "A: Always \u2014 always \u2014 this time I was living with my sister and my brother-in-law, it\nwas in their apartment. Later the apartment was changed for apartment \u2014 different\napartment and also 1s a big as this, but they had other friends which are leaving.\nAnd this was going on until they started just to close. This time my father got a\nproblem with the prostate in Kielce, and needed to be operated. And I think that I\nam coming now close to 1942, this was \u2014",
        "Q: Well, we\u2019re still \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yes, I \u2014 in this time \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 we\u2019re still 1940, were \u2014 anything else in 19 \u2014\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: You know, this is \u2014 this \u2014 everything is \u2014",
        "Q: The same.",

        "Q: In 1941 \u2014",
        "A: \u201941, I don\u2019t remember \u201941 or something like this, because wait a second, wait a\nsecond, wait a second, wait \u2014 yeah, the \u2014",
        "Q: The ghettos \u2014",
        "A: Ghetto started in 1940.",
        "Q: October 19 \u2014",
        "A: And this was this, what I was just saying before was everything about already in\nthe ghetto, what we\u2019re doing together with my brother-in-law and my sister, you\nknow, sending this \u2014 this was already in the ghetto. This time was very simple,\nbecause the courts, which were on the border between the ghetto, one entrance was\nfrom the ghetto side, the other entrance was \u2014 from the other side was very simple\nto get in. So that\u2019s what was this \u2014 the [indecipherable] were possible to do it,\nbecause you could go to the court and to \u2014 put in everything le \u2014 to make it legal,\nthis everything. Now, in 19 \u2014 sorry, in 1942, my father had already this problem\nwith prostate and was not permitted by Germans to be operated in Kielce. Was my\nmother who had so-called good looks, Aryan looks, decided to cover most of the\nOctober 7, 1993\nface of my father, he was very sick this time, took him by the train and she brought\nto Warsaw. He looked this way, that if wou \u2014 my mother wouldn\u2019t be there, I\nwouldn\u2019t recognize my own father. He had already infection, urine in the blood.\nAnd they tried, you know, to help him before operation, but in \u2014 he died soon after.\nSo this was only one member of the family that because of Germans, but was buried",
        "Q: Wa \u2014 so what \u2014 when did he die?",
        "A: 1942, and I would say this was January 18. I will tell you why. Because January\n19 - 18, in 1943 was th \u2014 by Jewish, after 11 months you stopped talk \u2014 saying\nKaddish, and then a month later you saying the Kaddish, so I said this Kaddish and\nthe next day I lost my mother and my sister. So almost exactly.",
        "Q: What were the conditions in 1941 in the ghetto? Did you have enough food? Do\nyou \u2014",
        "A: As I said before, we were lucky because we were ha-having help from our\nparents financially and we were making money, like I told you before. Yes, I am\nmaybe right now ashamed to say, to compare what was in Warsaw, yes we did\nhave \u2014 we didn\u2019t have \u2014 we didn\u2019t suffer hunger.",
        "Q: What were your living arrangements that you \u2014 it was just your family?\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: As I said before, this was, on the beginning was a big apartment change for\nbigger, but some of the rooms were giving to the friends, mostly lawyers.",
        "Q: So you shared?",
        "A: From other si \u2014 from not necessary Warsaw. Mostly not from Warsaw, from\ndifferent cities, but by profession lawyers and they had so \u2014 was crowded but still,\nthere were still two rooms for \u2014 for us. And they \u2014",
        "Q: Well now it\u2019s 1942, and you say your father died in the early part of the year.",
        "A: Oh, this was terrible \u2014",
        "Q: Then what happened?",
        "A: \u2014 because example \u2014 example, I decided once to take a bicycle and to take a\nchance and to go to cemetery. And believe or not, I gr \u2014 I didn\u2019t make it. This was\nonce that I couldn\u2019t make it to cemetery because of Germans. Second time, when\nwar was over and I came back to Warsaw and I found my wife, I decided to go \u2014\nfirst I went to Kielce back \u2014 no, no, to Warsaw. Mixing up. And I decided to go to\nsee the grave of my father. I couldn\u2019t get in because this time Russians had the fa \u2014\nthe exercises \u2014",
        "Q: Did your father \u2014 was your father able to have a funeral?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: He was. Okay, now we\u2019re \u2014\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: If you call it \u2014 this funeral. But anyway, not at least like others said, you know,\ntogether 20 - 30 bodies.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He had this \u2014",
        "Q: Now it\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re in 1942, anything in the spring of \u201942 that you recall?",
        "A: \u201942, a very important thing was that August 12, this date sticking in our memory,\nin group of our friends we decided that we\u2019re married, and also decided that we\u2019 ll\nnot stay together because it\u2019s not too safe, and especially that it\u2019s war, so you know,\nyou never know what will happen. So we\u2019re not together, but so-called, the whole\ntime when I was in all the concentration camps, I was wa \u2014 tho \u2014 thinking about my\nsisters, about \u2014 I knew that my mother and the younger sister are out. In\nconcentration camp I found out from my brother-in-law that my sister was arrested,\nthe older one. So I also wasn\u2019t too sure. Him, I didn\u2019t give a chance, her I \u2014 my wife\nI didn\u2019t give a chance to \u2014 she was too fragile, in my opinion. She was too much\nunder the cover of her older sister.",
        "Q: So you say you got in \u2014 you \u2014 this is August \u2014",
        "A: I thought that my two nieces would survive.",
        "Q: So that \u2014 so in August of \u201942, you decided to get married.",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nOctober 7, 1993",

        "A: Just \u2014\nA2: We didn\u2019t have papers, we didn't \u2014",
        "A: Almost \u2014 almost two \u2014 three years later \u2014 no, two years later, actually\n[indecipherable] almost two years later, September of 1945, I found my wife.",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019ll get to that.",
        "A: I found my brother-in-law, the name only, and I found the name of two my\nnieces, they made it.",
        "Q: Okay, it\u2019s August of 40 \u2014 of \u201942, and then what happened?",
        "A: This is still going on til 1943. In 1943, I went to \u2014\nA2: Uprising.",
        "A: \u2014 Lublin. Upri \u2014 oh, this is uprising, I forgot it completely about the uprising,\nwhich I had preferred not to remember again, because its organization which I\nsupposed to represent, represent to be a member of it, which I found out was giving\nthe position where to be and a gun, only not bullets in it. And I was put together\nwith the other fellow.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: This was on the fight of \u2014 get \u2014 ghetto fight. And the \u2014 the German machine,\nautomatic machines shoo \u2014 was shooting and one of the bullets hit the guy which\nwas next window to me, hit in the face and took off the \u2014 half of the head, and he\nwas dead at this spot, and I thought that I got also a bullet, but not the face, only that\nthe head and seeing him, I thought that my head is off. So scary, which I told you I\nnever was a hero. I looked my hand and I saw blood, and I passed out. So the\nGermans woke me up and [indecipherable] and going and they pulled us to a\nplace, to a spot where was a big hole, because the other group of the fighters,\ndifferent groups, did mar \u2014 put the mine and Germans were killed when they came\nto this spot. So they were putting guys around and shooting them. And probably if\nthey would have enough, they would put somebody else, but I don\u2019t know. As long\nas we are waiting for [indecipherable] they pull my watch and they pulled my ring.\nThey didn\u2019t put us, they took us, and this was where I was taken to concentration\ncamp on the train and I was sick, because I had open only wound right here, and\ncontinuously bleeding, but what worse was, when stop bleeding, was closing my\neye. And this time I found myself on the train with my dear friend who just passed\naway, Henry Fenigstein from Toronto.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little before, and we\u2019ll talk about your train ride. Were you active in\nthe resistance at all?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You were not.",
        "A: In the last moment \u2014",
        "Q: The last \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they \u2014 they put this in, the saying about hero, because after the war I met some\nof the guys who did belong to it and \u2014 and they wrote it on [indecipherable] paper\nthat I was, and didn\u2019t touch it because I wasn\u2019t a hero, I wasn\u2019t fighter, I was only\nfooled by myself and I was hit by a bullet, which I shouldn\u2019t stay there, at the\nwindow. But \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, when you\u2019re talking about that, I hate to talk about myself, is that\nfrom all my members of family, I was definitely the worst.",
        "Q: All right. We are \u2014 okay, now you are \u2014 y-you were talking about the April of\n1943 uprising in Warsaw.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And now you\u2019re on the train.",
        "A: Yeah. The train went to Lublin, which was Majdanek.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "Q: What kind and what was the con \u2014 what were the conditions on the train?",
        "A: Terrible. As I started to say, this was not regular train only, you know, for\nanimals and we were \u2014 crowded is not the word. We \u2014 you \u2014 you couldn\u2019t fall\ndown. Wherever you could sit down, you were sitting, if somebody was laying on\ntop of you, conditions were awful. And as I said, my friend is \u2014 this physician,\nHenry Fenigstein, who was with me as a matter of fact, 1f I am alive now, partially\nbecause of him, because with a pocket knife, from time to time before coming, you\nknow, for inspection of Germans, you know, how we looked, he was cutting in,\nopening the wound, so was opening my wound, my [indecipherable]. And we were\nin Majdanek for a few days \u2014",
        "Q: And how long is it \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 as a matter of fact, I need to look up this, this is the Lublin, it\u2019s the first, one\nstop \u2014",
        "Q: No, no, how \u2014 how long did the train ride take?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember \u2014",
        "Q: Was it only men in the train?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: Only men?",
        "A: Only men.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "Q: Only men in the train.",
        "A: On this train were only me \u2014 I don\u2019t remember [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And so you got \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall, could be that the women were there too. I don\u2019t know, because I \u2014\nas I said, I wasn\u2019t feeling well, I was sick this time, because as a matter of fact, I\ndon\u2019t remember too well about the staying in Lublin, in the camp, and as a matter\nof fact, whatever I remembered, was funny story, Henry re-remembered differently.\nAnd we were sitting and talking about and he didn\u2019t remember some of the things\nwhich I said, I didn\u2019t remember some things which he said.",
        "Q: What were \u2014 what were some of the things you remembered about being in\nLublin?",
        "A: Example, I remembered that there was a woman this time in Lublin and she was\na wife of a lawyer, young lawyer, whom I knew f\u2014 whom I met in Warsaw. And\nwhen she came and she saw me \u2014 she was working there \u2014 when she saw me and\nask me what \u2014 why I am, you know, ti \u2014 my suit was full of holes because, you\nknow, ghetto was burning and on the top \u2014 on the attics were most of the feathers,\nso there was \u2014",
        "Q: Flying down?\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: Flying down and was making holes in everything. So she went and she brought a\nnew \u2014 not a new, but a good one, jacket for me and Dr. Fenigstein. And I remember\nthis exactly, I cannot recall her name. He doesn\u2019t remember \u2014 he didn\u2019t remember\nthis. Now, I don\u2019t think that I made up this story, because I remember even who\nwas it, I cannot remember the name. I see her, I see him, even. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you work in Lublin? What did you \u2014",
        "A: No, no, this \u2014 we were \u2014 only this was a all transition to send into different\ncamps. And I remember only that we had the inspection. Again the Germans came\nand picked up 600 guys. And with the help of Dr. Fenigstein I passed because he\nopened, and m-my eyes were open, the left eye was open too, and I was among the\n600 together with him, and \u2014 and again is a story which I remember, he remembers\nonly partially, that when the 600 of us were there, the guys who were working, and\nthere were Jews who used to be in the Polish army, they told us if we leave the gate\nand we\u2019 ll go straight, then we\u2019re going for \u2014 they will finish us. If they will \u2014 will \u2014\nwill pass the gate and will turn to the right, 1t means we are shipped to the other\ncamp. So this time I thought that this friend, this doctor told me, let\u2019s stay on the\noutside, so in case they taking us straight, we\u2019ll go up there \u2014 because they told us,\ndo whatever you\u2019re doing when you go inside, because you\u2019re going for finish. And\nhe doesn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember exactly, but anyway it was not\nOctober 7, 1993\nimportant because we came out and we turned around. I am sitting here, so we\ndidn\u2019t go straight and we didn\u2019t do anything. Came a guy by the name of\nFlaggs(ph), whom I wouldn\u2019t recognize except that I remember very w-well the\nname, and took us to the first camp, labor camp, which was Budzyn. And if you\nwant, because I have right here this box, which my friend was engraving when we\nwere there, and this was Budzyn, if we can read here, was on April 30\", 1943, and\nwe were there til February 14, 1944.",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do there?",
        "A: Now, when we came there, this is funny story, when we came there, I didn\u2019t do\nanything because I went right away to hospital. And \u2014 and they decided that I have\n\u2014 surprisingly, that I have a malaria, this German \u2014 Au-Austrian doctor, Dr.\nFirsten(ph). I remember him because after the war, again, he became the Red Cross\ndoctor in Vienna. He told me when I came out from hospital, after few days, I don\u2019t\nremember, or a week, he told me not to get scared when I will feel bad, because I\nam coming back because usually repeats, and that\u2019s what it was. But I know that\nwhenever \u2014 how long I was in the camp, when I woke up, I asked the male nurse\nwho was there, who \u2014 with whom I became later friendly, I ask him, where 1s the\nmen\u2019s room? And he said to me, you are going every day, so why are you asking\nOctober 7, 1993\nme? I didn\u2019t know. He told me all my life\u2019s story because supposedly I was talking.\nReally, I went, after a few days, working again, this time working, going to.",
        "Q: What kind of \u2014",
        "A: And what we were doing? Now, when we came to this camp, Budzyn, they told\nus not to admit that you have a free profession, except dentists and doctors. I wasn't\na dentist, I wasn\u2019t a doctor, so everybody else should say that he is a locksmith.\nNow, I never saw, in my te \u2014 I never held in my hand [indecipherable] but\nlocksmith. So there were few hundred locksmiths. And the next day they told us to\nclean the roof. That\u2019s was the locksmiths. Anyway, they didn\u2019t believe it that being\na Polish locksmith, we know what means locksmith, so they get us umschalag(ph).\nIt means a school again, and I this time, first time in my life I knew what means\n[indecipherable], I knew what is a [indecipherable] and I knew how to make it.\nThis was made there. And \u2014",
        "Q: What were your living conditions like? Where were you living?",
        "A: Were living in barracks, sleeping on the [indecipherable]. I think we had\n[indecipherable] one next to the other. What I remember from this time, I\nremember only most of it. I remember that the whole night I was running only to\nurinate, you know, that\u2019s what it was, because I decided one thing, food was not\nenough. Again, I\u2019m talking only about myself. But I wouldn\u2019t sell my bread. I was a\nOctober 7, 1993\nsmoker, and I wouldn\u2019t smoke. I wouldn\u2019t buy bread because I didn\u2019t have money. I\nwouldn\u2019t sell my bread either. So I stopped smoking and I was drinking plenty, like\neverybody was doing. Guys who were selling the bread for cigarettes were falling,\nyou know, swelling and dying. And \u2014 and I survived. Was one slice of bread for a\nday, and not a big slice, and bread was awful. But I shouldn\u2019t say this because I met\nin this camp a client of mine from before the war, who always, I remember him as a\nsick man, he had the ulcers, and rich fellow, but suffering terrible, all kinds of\nmedication. And I am talking about before 1939, even America didn\u2019t have too\nmuch medication of ulcers li \u2014 today we have miracles [indecipherable]. And in\nthe camp he suddenly didn\u2019t have any ulcers. This bread, he would eat as much as\npossible, and he didn\u2019t have any ulcers.",
        "Q: What was the \u2014 what was a typical day like?",
        "A: Getting up very early in the morning, get together for counting outside. Getting a\ncup of the cold coffee, dirty water and this time you got the slice of bread, which I,\non the beginning I was breaking to eat half on the beginning and half later until they\nstole this other half, so I was eating, finishing completely. And this was not a bad\ncamp to compare with the other camps. And then, together we were marching to the\nfactory, which was not far away, by the name of Heinkel(ph). They were preparing\nthe people for making planes later, which in other camps I was working on planes,\nOctober 7, 1993\nwhich \u2014 we didn\u2019t suffer, but Germans suffered because no one plane took off. And\nwe, in my opinion, we didn\u2019t do this with purpose, we just didn't know how to do it.\nAnd if anybo \u2014\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: \u2014 talking about your staying in Budzyn and working in the factory.",
        "A: Yes, after \u2014 this is an \u2014 every day the same story repeating, and when it comes,\nyou know, to conditions, as I said before, were awful, people were dying because\nthis was one of the camps, this was so-called labor camp, not concentration camp\nyet, and I am talking now because \u2014 about this Budzyn because from experience of\nthe other camps which I had later, they were not used \u2014 we were not used to these\nconditions. Example, I was dreaming always about a pair of underwear. Socks. I\nwas dreaming all the time in all the concentration camps, I was dreaming about\npotatoes, I don\u2019t know why not bread, but potatoes. Now, we can \u2014 we came to one\nday, they picked up in \u2014 in Budzyn \u2014 let me only recall what was the reason. Oh,\nthey call \u2014 pick up a group of people to send to different camp. And we didn\u2019t know\n\u2014 anyway, I didn't know this time that they are \u2014 they decided already to change\nBudzyn for concentration camp. I wasn\u2019t there when they changed. I was sent with\nOctober 7, 1993\nthe group to Mielitz(ph). And this was, looking in on my box here \u2014 excuse me.\nMielitz(ph) was February 16 to \u2014 \u201944 to July 24, 1944.",
        "Q: How did you get from one place to the other?",
        "A: Oh, the ba \u2014 definitely by trains again, the same ones, but not as bad as was from\nWarsaw to Lublin or from Lublin to Budzyn was a little bit better then. This was\nnot as bad, but the same crowd and the same kind of trains. And we arrived in\nMieletz(ph) and we got a lousy welcome. A good welcome from the guy in charge\nof the camp, the Jewish fellow, but a lousy from other people, because I don\u2019t know\nwhy, because not everybody was the fighter on Warsaw ghetto and they called\nfighters [indecipherable] heroes, and they didn\u2019t like us.",
        "Q: What was your health like at that point?",
        "A: I probably was in excellent condition before I went, because when I \u2014 when war\nwas over I was very light, but the UGA(ph) when checked, they found out\neverything okay, was exceptional. One left eye \u2014 and I thought that this \u2014 and this\nwas not, because if this, then the right eye would be wrong, but that\u2019s\n[indecipherable]. No, this \u2014 this was not on my mind never, and as a matter of fact,\nanswering this question, all my years in the camp, I don\u2019t compare to the way my\nwife went through not being in concentration camp. Because I had my number, I\nhad my yellow and blue Jewish star on then, this was showing that I am a Jewish\nOctober 7, 1993\ncommunist, because all Jews had this, and the number. And I knew that not today,\nso would be tonight, or tomorrow, this is the end, but I am \u2014 I was myself, I was\nalways myself. She never was herself.",
        "Q: Did you always wear your \u2014 your star?",
        "A: Yes, yeah, because I \u2014 the sign we were wearing only when was concentration\ncamp. Mielitz(ph) was changed to concentration camp. That\u2019s what we got, those\ntwo letters, which means concentrations lager. And we found out later that this\nwas under the Dachau. Everything from then, from Mielitz(ph) we\u2019re going,\nincluding that we went to Dachau itself, too.",
        "Q: So you got to Mielitz(ph) and \u2014",
        "A: To Mielitz(ph).",
        "Q: \u2014 in February.",
        "A: In Mielitz(ph) \u2014 in Mielitz(ph) we were working again in a factory.",
        "Q: What kind of factory?",
        "A: Th-\u2014 everything was prepared for war. As a matter of fact, again I need to go to\nex \u2014 my experience. I supposed to drill on an electric drill press, to drill one of the\npieces on an angle. And being later here in United States in the metal business,\nwhich I was, and I will come back later to you, how the life 1s playing tricks on us, I\nwas \u2014 I broke one of the bits. Now when you usually were getting five bits and one\nOctober 7, 1993\nbroke, you were going to \u2014 for more, which again, one of us was there and was\ngiving you not markings, so this way they didn\u2019t find out how many were broke.\nBut when I broke this piece, the piece was spoiled, because you couldn\u2019t get this\nhalf of the bits back. So I took out and I didn\u2019t know that the Germans were staying\nbehind me. When I took out this he says, you spoiled the piece. So I needed to pull\nmy hands, and he was giving me five whip on the right and wi \u2014 five of left. And\nthis cracked. And you would say bad, right? No, this was not bad, this was good\nbecause I was sent to the camp and in the camp the doctor put the stitches; 12, I\nthink, stitches he put, and the \u2014 I was sent back to the camp \u2014 to the factory. When I\ncame there, there were Germans, they knew everything. One hand, two hands, three\nhands, one leg. They send me to machine which 1s working only with one hand. But\nthen they came and they said, who knows how to write and read? And again\neverybody 1s afraid, but I had only one hand, so I picked up, I know how to read\nand write. To hell with it, what wa \u2014 wi-will be, will be. And they send me into a\nroom which was sitting a German at the desk and he was a \u2014 a draftsman. And he\ntold me that \u2014 and bu \u2014 I forgot to say only that in school my foreign language was\nGerman, so I could talk, and he told me that he will show me how to make \u2014 to\nbecome a draftsman, and will be his helper. Now, I don\u2019t know if he was provoking\nme or not, but every morning when I was coming there, there was a sandwich, I\nOctober 7, 1993\nthink a sandwich in the paper, and he never said that I should take it, but I never\ntook it. So this \u2014 that my hand was hit and I got the stitches, was only help me that I\nwas in a clean place. He permitted me even to wash my shirt, and to dry there and\nthen to put again on, and he ti\u2014 taught me how to be a draftsman. Not only to be a\ndraftsman, but German draftsmen needed to make on the machines the first piece,\nso he taught me even how to work on the machine. From there this \u2014 this camp was\nchanged to concentration camp, as I said before, and we got the letters and we got\nthe concentration camp uniforms, in Mielitz(ph). And \u2014",
        "Q: What \u2014 what month was that, do you know?",
        "A: Now what month was this? I will not be able to tell you because I told you how\nlong we were in Mielitz(ph) \u2014",
        "Q: Right, okay.",
        "A: \u2014 and then we were \u2014 this was not long before leaving Mielitz(ph).",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And this time we are already in concentration camp, Mielitz(ph) changed to\nconcentration camp, and of course \u2014",
        "Q: And how did the conditions change when it became \u2014\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: How we felt the condition changed? I think \u2014 because again, is something, what\nhappened, which I told you on the beginning, never was a hero, was a coward, I\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 this is only one army, the German army that I cannot recognize what \u2014\nA2: Rank.",
        "A: \u2014 they are officers, or \u2014",
        "Q: Rank, the rank.",
        "A: \u2014 rank, never, never could. I know everythi \u2014 everybody\u2019s else\u2019s, I couldn\u2019t\nrecognize. Russian is very hard, but I got it. But here \u2014 or my head doesn\u2019t want to\nremember, or I couldn\u2019t remember this way, no faces. Now, I think that the \u2014\nnumber one, that we got electric wires around the camp. I think this time we got,\nwhich was not too good for us, not only because nobody was running away, but the\nguy in charge, this SS man had the horse there, outside the camp, and the horse\nonce, fly or something bother, and he started to kick, and kicked the fence, and\ndropped dead. So we were suffering because we killed the horse, so when you want\nto know about the conditions \u2014 I think the change was also that instead of \u2014 of guys,\nspecial army, SS came in and they were in charge of the camp. But other ways the\nconditions were similar ones.",
        "Q: Still the one piece of bread a day?\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: Yes, the same, that\u2019s almost the same, didn\u2019t change. Not that I recall. From\nMielitz(ph), as already, we went to Wieliczka. I remember now, I think that\nWieliczka, which were not too long there. We were from July 25\", to August first,\nso what was this, a week?",
        "Q: A week.",
        "A: Something like this. We were there and from there we were sent to Flossenbirg,\nI don\u2019t remember if Flossenbtrg was Germany or Austria, but anyway we went to\nF-Flossenburg, and we were there \u2014 the trip was quite long. Now \u2014 now \u2014 now I\ndon\u2019t recall here \u2014 you see, he made a mistake here and he crossed out this, and here\nis li\u2014 written that on September four, we came to Flossenbirg.",
        "Q: Do you remember \u2014",
        "A: And I don\u2019t remember if we left Flossenbiirg, because he has only one date,\nSeptember 4\", 1944 li \u2014 Flossenbiirg. Flossenbiirg was a very different camp. No\nother camp that I ever was, was the same. The \u2014 first, was in the mountains, and\nwas in a different levels of the \u2014 of the mountains. On the very top were Americans\nprisoners of war, on the very top. Now, we were, when we came there, they first,\nthey undressed us and they changed the \u2014 the places, so if you had something you\nhide \u2014 was hiding, you lost, because they took you naked to the other place. We got\nthe shower and then they gave you a potato sack. And everybo-body needed to go to\nOctober 7, 1993\nsleep in this potato \u2014 I was sure that this is the end probably, he will \u2014 we\u2019ll go to\nthe potato sack and this will be the end, but no. And the next day they gave us clean\nuniforms and we were there, we were not doing anything in Flossenbirg. Every\nday was only to get up, to counted that \u2014 that we were \u2014 that\u2019s what \u2014 probably what\nhe wrote to Flossenbirg, that we were very short time, and probably days only.\nAnd floss \u2014 Flossenburg we were sent to Leitmeritz. And I am almost positive that\nLeitmeritz was in aus \u2014 Austria, not \u2014 not in Germany. And there we were from\nJuly 10 \u2014 no, no, no, wait a second, June \u2014 that\u2019s right, no, August 10 \u2014 how can be\nSeptember there and August 10 to October 1944 in Leitmeritz. Leitmeritz,\nLeitmeritz, Leitmeritz is not far away from, because we heard about, was from\nthis show camp \u2014\nA2: Theresienstadt.",
        "A: Theresienstadt. And I think Theresienstadt was not in Germany, right, this\nwas Austria?",
        "Q: Austria.",
        "A: So this was Austria too. And in Leitmeritz I have a very funny experience, that\nI was sent once by the guy in charge of our group to pick up the bread, you know,\nfor \u2014 for everybody. S-So many guys were sent, and I came there and the guys who\nwere giving out the bread was talking Polish. And so I turned to them and I started\nOctober 7, 1993\nto talk to them. And one of them walk away, comes to me and he says, where are\nyou from? And I was used this time, being so many years in Warsaw to say from\nWarsaw. And he says oh, so not you, because you remind me somebody. I said, not\nfrom Kielce? He says yes. And he not only get me the bread, for everybody, but he\nalso put the package of salami, which not only I ate, everybody, and everybody got\nsick. Okay, so this where my [indecipherable] Flossenbiirg \u2014 Leitmeritz, excuse\nme. In Leitmeritz \u2014 what would bring Leitmeritz?",
        "Q: Were you working there?",
        "A: I always wor-working. Experience was \u2014\nA2: [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014I seen a \u2014 the [indecipherable] were almost that [indecipherable]",
        "Q: There were so many of them. [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable] Do you ever \u2014 do you remember ever being terribly, terribly\nfrightened up to the \u2014",
        "A: I was always frightened.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts?\nA2: About suicide [indecipherable]\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: Because you see, as I told you before, I knew it. Said any day will come the end.\nI didn\u2019t know only how. And if I am not wrong, this was Leitmeritz even. In\nLeitmeritz, in our barracks specially, were quite few Yugoslavs. And very often,\nwhen you got up in the morning, one of the Yugoslav was hanging, suicide. From\nmy experience, the nicest people with whom I was in the camp, were the\nYugoslavs. Maybe because of language was similar and maybe of their behavior\nand maybe because of this experience, that I didn\u2019t come across in concentration\ncamp, of suicides committed by anybody else but Yugoslavs. And I promise myself,\nthis time I thought so, said when \u2014 I will not fall asleep. Only I will be waiting, and\nif I will see that somebody\u2019s doing, I will follow and I will do the same. A funny\nstory, when I didn\u2019t fall asleep, I was tired the next day and nobody did commit\nsuicide. But when I did fall asleep, somebody did. So what I figure out, probably\nwhen I heard the noises that somebody\u2019s trying to commit, being a coward, I fall\nasleep. I-I\u2019m not joking, but probably that\u2019s how it was.",
        "Q: When you were in these different camps, how aware were you of what else was\nhappening in the rest?",
        "A: On the beginning I knew, when I was in the \u2014 in Budzyn, even Mielitz(ph),\nWieliczka, sometimes we got some news. As a matter of fact in Budzyn I got the\nnews from my brother-in-law that my sister was arrested.\nOctober 7, 1993\nA2: Now this was Poland.",
        "A: Because these are all Polish \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, I got to the sister of this Dr. Fenigstein, who was playing a\nAryan, brought money from my brother-in-law. So we had \u2014 later we didn\u2019t. We\nwere getting some news. How they were coming, I don\u2019t know. I think that the first\nreal news what was going out, we got in Dachau. Then later, after the war I found\nout that they had the underground. But then we got what is going on, and Dachau\nwas already \u2014",
        "Q: But we\u2019re still in Leitmeritz, so \u2014",
        "A: Yes, Leitmeritz. No, Leitmeritz we didn't know. We knew only \u2014 Leitmeritz\nwe got only news that Theresienstadt is not far away. That there is better, but\nnobody was sent there. And as a matter of fact, in Leitmeritz, and I read here what\nhe wrote there, that friends were someplace when \u2014 and I thought that in Leitmeritz\nthis was, but it\u2019s not \u2014 he \u2014 he wrote in some place that our friends \u2014 because there\nwere two camps, and you see, very often when the groups were sent to different\ncamps, there were at least to two different camps. And you could switch, you could\ngo from one to the other because I don\u2019t think that they did care really, if x,y,z went\nto one camp, even that they were release, because the \u2014 most of the release were not\nOctober 7, 1993\ncompleted because people were dead already by this time, or that they did care\nwhich ones are going. So if you moved from one group to the other group, they\ndidn\u2019t make a issue of it. And I\u2019m saying this because I am holding in my hand this\nbox which this Greenstein(ph) made, and he was there, young fellow, he was\nprobably four or five years younger than I was, and had even younger brother and\nwherever I went he was saying he wants to go to and I \u2014 in Leitmeritz especially, I\nremember that we\u2019re choosing and I said boy like that\u2019s enough it\u2019s enough. Maybe\nI am picking up the wor \u2014 the bad camp and you will suffer because you follow me.\nDon\u2019t. But he did.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: And so, from Flossenbirg, we went \u2014",
        "Q: Leitmer \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to Leitmeritz.",
        "Q: And then from \u2014",
        "A: And Leitmeritz we went to Grakow(ph). Now, I don\u2019t remember\n[indecipherable] \u2014 to Dachau, first to Dachau. And in Dachau we were from 23\nto 29 of October \u201944.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And from there \u2014\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "Q: What \u2014 do you remember that week?",
        "A: Dachau yes, I remember. I remember the first, I will never forget in my life, on\nthe gate was written Arbeit macht frei. And the \u2014 Horthy(ph) was on the \u2014 on the\ngate, the gardener there. He was one in the uniform. I don\u2019t know even who showed\nus that this is Horthy(ph), but when we came here \u2014 and the other experience was\nthat they were keeping us outside on the \u2014 you know, not going to the barracks.\nBefore we enter even, they kept us for 12 hours with the toilets, you know, on the\nfield, because they thought that maybe people will \u2014 could hide something, you\nknow, that \u2014 that \u2014 so they had all worked out scientific \u2014 scientifically. And then\nwe were sent and I \u2014 if you saying about Dachau these few days, I remember only\nthat that guy in charge of this barrack, which welcome us, was number red triangle,\nwhich means he was a communist and had number 999. He was in the Dachau\nsince 1933. German, older guy, beautiful spoken, welcome us and told us that every\nguy, we get two covers. And please, when you will be leaving, I beg you, leave this\ntoo.",
        "Q: The blankets.",
        "A: The blankets [indecipherable] ghetto. But \u2014",
        "Q: Were you still \u2014 you were still wearing your Jewish star all this ti \u2014\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: Di \u2014 di \u2014 always you had this triangle and the number, which was changing from\ncamp to camp. As a matter of fact, I never remember my number. I remember what\nI was wearing, and I had to remember, because from quite long time, and I think I\nmet him in Mielitz(ph) but I got very close with him in Augsburg, or someplace\nthere, was a deaf mute fellow, an excellent tailor, excellent. As a matter of fact, in\nthe camps he was getting extra bread from Germans because he was fixing their\nuniforms. He \u2014 he was a artist. And whenever they were \u2014 we\u2019re called, he couldn\u2019t\nhear his name, his number, so what I was, and I could talk with him by hands. I\ndon\u2019t know language, but my hands, I could talk to him. So I pushed him when his\nnumber was called. And he was just deciding, if they said right and he wanted to go\nleft, he played dumb and he went left. So he was choosing, and he survived the war,\ntoo. Now \u2014",
        "Q: What \u2014 what \u2014 what else did you do in Dachau? Did you do any work in that\nweek, or \u2014",
        "A: No, Dachau was only, we were in this barrack, only few si-sis \u2014 you know, few\ndays and from Dachau we\u2019re sent for work to \u2014 first was Augsburg. In the\nAugsburg, believe or not, we were staying outside, out of the city, in suburbs, and\nevery morning we were walking through the city of Augsburg to the other side of\n[indecipherable] preparing for a airport, for future airport. And I don\u2019t know if this\nOctober 7, 1993\nwas really for the airport, that\u2019s what they were calling. We were doing stupid\nthings, digging and closing and filling and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and nothing, nothing\nproductive, but that\u2019s what it was.",
        "Q: How long were you in Augsburg?",
        "A: In \u2014 in \u20141in Dachau?",
        "Q: No, in Augsburg?",
        "A: In Augsburg we were from October 29 to December first of 1944.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And then from Augsburg we were sent to Leonberg. Leonberg. Do you think\nthat I remember now Leonberg? I don\u2019t remember Leonberg too good because I\nknow \u2014 I remember that from \u2014 how long we were in Leonberg? We were in from\nDecember \u2014 December first, the same day. So you see, Augsburg and Leonberg\nare very close to each other because the same day we were there. Til \u00b044 \u2014 til\nFebruary of \u201945, only two months. So again probably \u2014 again doing nothing \u2014 not \u2014\nnothing important, nothing productive, no more was building the planes or\nsomething, that\u2019s what I recall. Then we were sent again to Kaufering, which\neveryth \u2014 every single one, Augsburg, Nuremberg, Kaufering, lager one, lager\ntwo and Landau and Ganacker, these are all camps of Dachau, which was\n[indecipherable]. And I don\u2019t recall doing anything except few \u2014 few experiences\nOctober 7, 1993\nagain which you had the example, in one of this Kaufering lagers, a guy wanted to\n\u2014 was walking too close to the fence, wire fence, electric wire fence, probably\nbecause somebody was throwing something. I was not a hero like I told you before,\nI wouldn\u2019t bother cross, and the gar \u2014 guy on the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Tower?",
        "A: Tower, sh \u2014 did the shoot in his direction and hit his testicles. And he grabbed\nthe testicles and run to this male nurse and he never knew what to do with that, and\nhe put plenty of bandages around, and few hours later we deci \u2014 they decided that\nwe changing the camp and going. And that guy was suffering, but this was shortly\nbefore the end of it. Americans came and they operated him. And as a matter of\nfact, we met him after the war, he was not only married, but he had children too.\nWhat else? Other camp, one vo \u2014 one of the lager, two, during the night, we were in\nthe barracks which different \u2014 you know, digged out from in the ground and on the\nroof above, and not too many guys, maybe 12 guys in one of this. And during the\nnight this \u2014 that mute guy w \u2014 was shaking me, I woke up in dark. I was asking\nwhat is it, and he showed me that we\u2019ll be going. Now, nobody heard this. He was\nright, and we were going to other camp. This was one of the very end. We went to\nKaufering. The name was \u2014 this was April fourth. And this is already 1945, so this\nis just \u2014 just before the end of the war, and we were in lager \u2014 lager one, lager two.\nOctober 7, 1993\nIf you want to hear \u2014 this not about me, but about the guys who were in the camp\nwith me. You know, in one of the camps, Americans came down and were shooting\naround the camp because around the camp the Germans put the small planes, and\nthe Americans found out about this, so they came down and they were shooting\nfrom inside the camp, not to hit us, to the planes, and the planes went on fire. And\nthe guys from the camp used this to cook something on the belly the planes.",
        "Q: So was this where you were liberated from?",
        "A: Yeah, this is the experience of \u2014 the last one was Ganacker, and in Ganacker\none day \u2014 it was Landau or Ganacker, was one day and they decided the whole\ncamp, wh-which if I am not wrong were close to a thousand of guys, oh, to take us,\nand the Germans said that we\u2019re going to Landshut. You probably heard about, this\nwas quite the camp too, and the specific camp, because when I was in Dachau the\nchimneys were not working, 1t means they were not burning anybody. But\nLandshut was still working. W-We knew that is active. And they were supposed to\ntransport us walking there. On the way, on a big one field, they told us to sit down\non the ground. And few minutes later, they disappeared, their whole group of s-m \u2014\nSS mans disappeared. We found ourselves without a guard. And as I said, thousand\npeople. And a German fellow, who had that green triangle, green triangle it means\nhe was a killer who was sent from a jail to the concentration camp, that\u2019s what he\nOctober 7, 1993\nhad, the green one. Tall one fellow, he told us why he was in jail. He killed a owner\nof a villa which he thought that is empty, and he went there and he found him, so\nwas one solution, him or her, or the owner. So they found him and they sent him\nback there to concentration camp. This guy, when he saw that the SS men\ndisappeared, went on a big \u2014\nA2: Podium?",
        "A: Not podium, though it was a podium [indecipherable] only pieces of wood and\nhe said to us, look fellows, we are in southern part of Germany, which is called\nNiederbayern. This is Catholic part of Germany. These people hate Hitler and\nJews. That\u2019s what he said. So from now on, no one is a Jew. We are Catholics, even\nwhen you are Protestants. Then you will get help from these people. And now we\ncannot go thousands, so let\u2019s make small groups and go. So we made small groups\nand we decided to go all different ways. Thousand people and only one fellow, who\nacted very nicely in all the camps, by the name of Markowski(ph), which was a\nsecretary in few camps, it means he was keeping books and everything, and he was\nvery nice. He told me that he is a lawyer from the part of Lvov, Poland. And I\nremember that in the camp, where we were this time, I needed to say Kaddish after\nmy father. And I went to him and I said to him \u2014 I was very friendly with him, and I\nsaid to him that I have a problem. I need to have 10 Jews to say the Kaddish. And\nOctober 7, 1993\nhe looked at me and he says, look, I don\u2019t know Jewish religion, but \u2014 you know,\nI\u2019m not a Jew, but I think that your religion is saying 10 men, not 10 Jews. Now if\nyou will not ask if somebody is Jew or not, I will call the people and I will say\nJoseph, it means we are 10 here. And you go to the window and you do whatever\nyou want. And so it was. He decided to take a group of Polacks. Polacks it means\nnot like us Polacks, only Polacks \u2014 Catholics, and I should take a group of 10\nJewish with us, and we will go together. We went together only for two days. After\ntwo days we had bloody noses. It started the calling names, and fights.",
        "Q: Between the Jews?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And we needed to split. He went with his group, we went with our\ngroup. Now, in this time, we\u2019re running away, not knowing we are in Germany,\nnot knowing where we\u2019re running. We were afraid \u2014 we still didn\u2019t know what\u2019s\ngoing on, if we will not come against \u2014 against SS or whomever.\nA2: And everybody thought [indecipherable]",
        "A: So we \u2014 we decided \u2014 we decided to hide during the day and move only in the\nevenings. And so we\u2019re doing. One woman \u2014 we came to a place, and we thought\nthat we are safe, then two SS men showed up and they grabbed us and they brought\nus to a\u2014a farm where they had already few other people, I don\u2019t know if from our\nex-camp or different camps. And in this we were watching and were two entrances.\nOctober 7, 1993\nOne was from the left and one was from the right. And the two SS men were\nwalking around this building, so we could see them where they are on one side, and\nwhen they coming on other. And being next to one guy, I told him, when they will\ncome on this side and they will pass, I am going out this way. I don\u2019t want to be\nhere any more. We made a mistake, I want to \u2014 and he says, I am going, too. Before\nknowing, six of us \u2014 ye \u2014 one knew about the other, when they came here, we took\noff, and we run. I-If you ever saw coward running, we were \u2014 we could break all\nrecords, until we came to the woods. After the woods there was a wall, brick wall,\nwe jumped over and we didn\u2019t hear anything any more, and walking. I told this\nstory because I want to tell you, after the war, when we found ourself again \u2014 we,\nmy wife and myself, in this part, in Germany, I took my wife to show her, and I\nwent to the same place, I showed her where are the two doors, and I said on the\nright door when they were on the left, we run, let\u2019s walk. And we walk and there\nwas a forest. And we went through the forest, we came on the end of the forest and\nthere was a brick wall seven feet tall. And I looked on it and I said no, this was not\nthis. Probably I made the mistake. This is the other side, it\u2019s the other door. I might\n\u2014 no, there was no the other door. I took all the guys who jumped this wall and they\ndidn\u2019t want, even one wanted to believe that we made this seven foot wall. She saw\nit. It was impossible. What you could do when you are scared. And that\u2019s what we\nOctober 7, 1993\nrun, we were s \u2014 hiding me and the other guy, because we split that more and more\nfor safety. And with the other fellow who didn\u2019t \u2014 who survived the war, but we\nsplit it after the war because he married a German young girl. She was younger than\nthe youngest daughter of here would be. And because of it \u2014 so we split it. We were\nduring the day in the woods and during the night were sleeping at the farmer, who\nknew that we are hiding because we were [indecipherable] of course. And one\nafternoon we were already tired to sit in the woods, we decided it\u2019s not dark yet, but\nlet\u2019s go, cause no movement. And as we\u2019re walking out from the forest, we see a\nJeep on the \u2014 on the highway and we stop and the machine gun went to our\ndirection and the soldiers shouting to run. So we started to run not moving, only run\nup and down, and I say I am running back to the woods. And the fellow says, I\ndon\u2019t think that we have a chance. And we came \u2014 we were so scared, that we\ndidn\u2019t see the American star.",
        "Q: And then you \u2014 and then what happened?",
        "A: Then \u2014 this was called freedom. Few days later, when we got together, a few of\nour fellows from different hiding places there, from different farmers, we thought\nthat that\u2019s all what is leftover, you know, survivors. Everybody else died, probably.\nSo we wanted to know if any Jews are in American army. So we\u2019re waiting and\nwe\u2019re talking Polish and one of the Polish fellow American, when we ask in Polish\nOctober 7, 1993\nif there are any Jews in the American army, he said to me, Jews? Jews are in \u2014 in\nAmerica making money. Now, he didn\u2019t know who is his major because the next\nday was a big sign that they major by this \u2014 this name I don\u2019t remember now,\nAmerican name, wants to see all Jews. And we said this is the end, we\u2019re not going.\nSo we had one fellow who knew a little bit English, and we said, he will not grab\nthis one when he knows that there are other ones. So when he will not come back, it\nmeans that to me he wants the Jews. If he will come back we will know what is\nabout. No, he came back to tell us that he is a Jew, and he won\u2019t beat you.",
        "Q: Then you met with the \u2014 the \u2014 the Jewish officer, American Jewish officer \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, as a matter of fact \u2014",
        "Q: And what happened then?",
        "A: \u2014 as a matter of fact, he was a major of the army, he was quite touched when he\nsaw quite a group, because I \u2014 he was the one who told us that we are not the only\none who survived, that there are other guys too. We were in terrible physical\ncondition. Terrible I am saying this way, that some of the [indecipherable] were\nnot more in the war, we were free. When we looked, I could see the \u2014 exactly all the\nbones on the face and of the [indecipherable] especially guy by the name of\nAckerman(ph) who few months later \u2014 and I am exactly a few months later\nOctober 7, 1993\nbecause we talking we were freed on May 1\u201c, 1945, and on the beginning of 1946, I\nwas back in the same part with my wife already. And we met this Ackerman(ph).",
        "Q: So what \u2014 what happened right after, after you were free? Where did you go?",
        "A: We were \u2014 right after we were free, the first reaction was from the farmer, that\nwe didn\u2019t admit that we are Jews because we thought that this will be not nice to\nhim that we are playing Catholics to save us, that to \u2014 now to \u2014 to tease, so we were\nstaying there. I remember only that he wanted to give us to eat anything he has there\nand he moved us to his bedroom and he moved out from the bedroom. Two of us,\nhe put. And I didn\u2019t want to drink milk. I was afraid. I was skinny and I was afraid\nof fat. I loved milk, but I was adding water to it, and meat altogether I couldn\u2019t look\non it. So he killed a pigeon and \u2014 and \u2014 and prepared. But my friend who didn\u2019t care\nabout and was eating the meat, he survived too, and he \u2014 and he was okay. I was a\ncoward, I was afraid of everything. And as a matter of fact, I don\u2019t think \u2014 I don\u2019t\nthink that I ever admitted to this farmer, small farmer, I never admitted that I am\nJewish, even when I came later with my wife to visit him, because I thought he was\na nice fellow. Remember his name even, Markmel(ph). And \u2014 Peter\nMarkmel(ph). And as a matter of fact, he liked this fellow from concentration\ncamp, this was a green triangle, said that they are \u2014 they hate Jews and Hitler. He\nOctober 7, 1993\nhated Hitler, really he hated Hitler. Ha \u2014 about Jews, I never spoke to him about,\nso I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Where did you go after you saw the major?",
        "A: After \u2014 after I felt a little bit stronger, I found out that not far away from\n[indecipherable] where I was staying, this time I was freed there in\nLangerfelden(ph), I decided to go to next town, which was [indecipherable]\nbecause I heard that there this Markowski(ph), which I told you before, this fellow\nwho was splitted, was preparing the Polish pe-people for repatriation to Poland. So\nI wanted to see him. In funny way I felt that I must go to him and to say that in my\nopinion, he is a Jew. And I came there, and I told him. And he said to me, thank\nyou, but I will to disappoint you, I am not a Jew. And \u2014 but it\u2019s nice of you, because\nI understand what you mean. And this was everything what I heard about him. He\nask me also if I\u2019m going to Poland, and I said yes I am going because I need to find\nout what happened to my family. And you know, in the beginning I told you that I\nfound my wife, my two nieces and my \u2014",
        "Q: So you went \u2014 you got back \u2014",
        "A: After I got back to Poland.",
        "Q: How did you get back from where you were?\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: By that same train, which was taking the official repatriates, I went with the \u2014\nthe Polack \u2014 I went there and I just walked together with them and \u2014 but I wasn\u2019t\nofficially coming, but I found myself in Poland. As I said, I found my wife, I found\nmy two nieces, I fen \u2014 found my ex-brother-in-law.",
        "Q: Was this in Warsaw? Where was this?",
        "A: The \u2014 my \u2014 the \u2014 the story was this way. My wife, as I mentioned before, she\nwas false papers. She survived. She wasn\u2019t as \u2014 as \u2014 as delicate as I thought she\nwas. She needed to be strong and she showed that she is a strong woman. My two\nnieces were placed with Catholic families. My brother-in-law found himself in a\nconcentration camp for a short time on the very end. My sister [indecipherable] he\nnoti \u2014 notified me in camp that was arrested \u2014 was arrested because she helped him\nto survive and she was arrested and she was killed also by Germans.\nA2: Your other sister, too?",
        "A: My other sister was killed together with my mother, but this was in ghetto. My\nbrother-in-law was shot. They were taken to probably Treblinka, which later I\nfigure out.",
        "Q: How long did you stay then in Poland?",
        "A: Very short. I was \u2014 was one month alre \u2014\nA2: No, but [indecipherable]\n37October 7, 1993",
        "A: \u2014no, no, I pi\u2014 I p\u2014I\u2014I remember where we left, because I came September\n1945.\nA2: In November \u2014",
        "A: And November 11, 1945 we left Poland.",
        "Q: To go where?",
        "A: Because we went in po \u2014\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nOctober 7, 1993\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: Can you tell us something about what happened in Poland after the war was\nover, between September \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 after September 1945?",
        "A: Number one, when I came to Warsaw I went to the Jewish Committee, like I\nsaid, to find out if anybody survived and I found out there that my two nieces and\nmy brother-in-law were registered. And \u2014 and my wife, which my friend said not \u2014\nyou will not find her in Warsaw, you will find her in Lodz. And I didn\u2019t look for ne\n\u2014 neither one of the nieces or my brother-in-law, I decided to go to L\u00e9dz. A one\nhour or two hours trip usually was taking the whole night, or the whole day,\nwhichever you preferred. I came to L\u00e9dz and I lost myself because I didn\u2019t ask this\nfriend of ours what is address of my wife. So he said to go to L\u00e9dz to the Jewish\ncommittee. I just took the train and went back to Warsaw to get the address, and\nthe next night I decided to go back to L\u00e9dz. Now, when I came \u2014\nA2: But I was under my false name.",
        "A: When I came there, knowing the address what I supposed to go, so I came. This\nwas a second or third floor walkup, of course. And I saw iron door, because\nsomeone had s \u2014 before the war even too, safety doors. Saw two cards on the door.\nOctober 7, 1993\nOne was the false one name of my wife and the other was written ell \u2014 I.\nWokaszevicz(ph), major \u2014 M.D., major of Polish mil \u2014 military.\nA2: Army",
        "A: I looked on it, door was closed, nobody home, I looked on it and I said I came\ntoo late. Because I don\u2019t know, probably from the stories you heard from other\npeople, that the husband were coming to the weddings of \u2014 of their wives. Here\nwouldn\u2019t be because we\u2019re le \u2014 really not \u2014 we\u2019re not legally married. So \u2014 and she\ncouldn\u2019t believe that I survived, and she couldn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t believe it that she will.\nSo I thought better let her think that I am dead, and I turned back and went to these\npeople where I was staying, only \u2014 family of my brother-in-law. And I came back\nand I told them that I saw this, and was a nice fellow. So sitting at the \u2014 in the\nevening and having the supper \u2014 because you know, we think differently in Europe,\nthe big meal you see in the lunchtime. So the small meal \u2014 he says to me, don\u2019t do\nit. You understand and you are honest. Go, tell her and just say that, bless her and\nthat\u2019s all. But at least let her know. I said, this is teasing, and \u2014 but I decided to go,\nlater \u2014 few hours later I went and the door was open, this \u2014 this iron door. So I\nknocked at the door. She came and backed up. So I said, hey, you made a mistake.\nSo I thought, turn around and go. But she says, what you staying, what you waiting?\nAnd I [indecipherable] and I said, who is the Major Doctor? She says this is Irene\nOctober 7, 1993\n[indecipherable]. She wasn\u2019t a doctor, she wasn\u2019t a major. But she had guts enough\nthat the war \u2014 she became later a doctor, M.D.\nA2: And she married a Christian and she didn\u2019t tell him anything.",
        "A: But she \u2014 this time she already was. And this time I told my wife, sitting there\nand telling about how I went and how she went, and I told her, what I went is\nnothing to compare what you went. And we decided that Poland is no more place\nfor us. Warsaw was a cemetery. Like I told you before when I went to Warsaw\nbecause I wanted to see the grave of my father, I couldn\u2019t get in. So, was only one\nthing to go. And to go [indecipherable] officially from Poland, I got to \u2014 one, I\nwas nominated as a judge for Breslau Wroclaw. Second, to get the paper to go to\nWest Germany, when I got nomination and they ask me when I was born, I said\nthis time, Eggenfelden niederbayer. And the secretary looked at me, I said, don\u2019t\nlook so at me, because I am Polish citizen, only my mother was pregnant when they\nwere in Germany, and I was born there, but my home 1s really Kielce and I got\neverything in Kielce. But when you asking me I need to tell you where was this?\nThis was, you know, southern part of Germany, that\u2019s where I was born. I figure\nmyself, I am from \u2014 born, and really the birth means so important. I am going back\nbecause my parents, when were in Germany, and they never were, and I was born\nthere, they decided to stay there for awhile and they buy \u2014 bought some of real\nOctober 7, 1993\nestate. Now, war is over, I want to sell the real estate, so I want to go there. So\ntogether we left, you know, Warsaw and we were going to Rychbak(ph), this was\nRychbak(ph) but through Wroclaw. And when we came there, we met a fellow\nwho was with me in the concentration camp, but he was working already for the\npolitical \u2014\nA2: Secret service [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014 ta\u2014 eff \u2014 F.B.L.",
        "Q: Intelligence \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: That\u2019s right, Intelligence, Polish Intelligence. And we were sitting and after\nawhile talking, talking, he said to me, you know what? You\u2019re not staying here.\nYou will not be a judge here. You want to leave Poland. I say, I will tell you\nsomething, if I cannot tell you the truth, then I will not be able to tell anybody truth,\nyes I am. He says, with my blessing. I will do the same soon. And I said \u2014 and my\nwife told him experience which we had in L\u00e9dz. Right after I came, and I was very\ndis \u2014 weak this time. I was in good condition still to compare to everybody, but I\nwas skinny and weak. We were going and we decided to go to bakery to buy\nsomething, cake or bread, I don\u2019t remember and were few steps, as we were\nOctober 7, 1993\nreaching this bakery, a Polish drunk, about completely drunk, he couldn\u2019t stay on\nhis feet, was walking down and he recognize right away that I am a Jew and he said\noh my God \u2014 in Polish, of course, oh my God, I thought that Hitler finish all the\nJews, but there are more. And as weak as I was I grabbed him by the shoulders, and\nto the wall and my wife behind me, leave him alone, leave him alone. And I left him\nalone and she told this guy, and I said I still didn\u2019t forgive her because I should kill\nhim. And he says wait, hold a second. You wouldn\u2019t be able to kill him\n[indecipherable]. Now it depends who would come there. If I would come I would\nfinish this guy with a gun and not tell you to go, but if this would be a different\ngroup and this would not be a Jew, you would be the dead one. So you didn\u2019t do\nthose stupid things, but that\u2019s what was my welcome. So Warsaw was a cemetery,\nPoland was no more for me. We passed the border and of course I went to this part\nof Germany which I was free. Before we stop in the \u2014 on the way in Berlin, she got\nthe typhus from the German soldiers who were running away. I probably went\nthrough this in concentration camp, not knowing even about. And \u2014 and we were \u2014\nwe got to spend, because she went to hospital, excuse me, in Berlin. And then after,\nin 1946, we got the \u2014 because the New Year\u2019s Eve of 1945 we spent still in Berlin.\nAnd a few days later, officially the Americans took us \u2014\nA2: It was American \u2014\nOctober 7, 1993",

The coat was brought\nby a friend, also an officer, who was almost sure that he is dead and couldn\u2019t face\nmy sister, so he left the coat there and he took off the bandages. We went to make a\npicture and with this picture I came back to my sister and we were there for quite\nawhile until my brother came from Kielce. Left the parents and came there because\nparents sent some money for my sister and for my brother-in-law who was still in\nBialystok. So we decided that we\u2019ll go there and deliver this money. It wasn\u2019t so\nOctober 7, 1993\nsimple crossing the border, neither with Germans or Russians, so we split the\nmoney between, but we delivered money together.",
        "A: We, my brother and myself and we were separated for a moment, but we found\nourself. My brother \u2014 I left my brother there, together with my brother-in-law and I\nwent back to Warsaw because I didn't want my sister to be alone. Even that two of\nthe sisters who were just then together. And because they had only two daughters,\nso they were only girls, so I decided that I will go because this side \u2014 my brother-in-\nlaw was not in condition to come. Just before war started between Russians and\nGermans, they came, they left Russian side and they came back to Warsaw and my\nbrother left right away for my parents to Kielce and were there. And later was\nchanging, we needed to give up the apartments because they were moving people to\nghetto, which was \u2014",
        "A: This is Warsaw.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, I\u2019m talking more now here about myself than I am talking\nabout the \u2014 the reason I am here, to talk about the Germans. And I hate to talk about\nmyself, this reminds me always, you know, when you\u2019re going to the bank and you\nOctober 7, 1993\nwant the loan, you need to show off how ri-rich you are, and believe me I wasn\u2019t a\nhero during the war. I was more a coward than \u2014 than a hero, so I hate to talk about,\nbut I know that the \u2014 I went to Kielce to visit my parents \u2014 this is, I\u2019m backing up\nnow a little bit and this needed to be in 1940 and I was there for a few days only \u2014 I\ndecided to be only for a few days, but in this few days I went to visit my friends\nfrom school, and of course when I visited them, they hated to see that I am wearing\nthe Jewish \u2014 because they were not Jews, so they told me to take off, and with them,\nthey don\u2019t see the difference. And \u2014 and I spent out \u2014",
        "A: The Jewish star which we were wearing. And I took off and I \u2014 I was with them\nand when I left them, I forgot that I had the star in my pocket and two regular\nGerman soldiers, not SS, stopped me and I don\u2019t know how \u2014 oh no, no, I know \u2014\nnow I didn\u2019t know how, but now I know. Two soldiers, German, were walking and\nI remind myself this time that I didn\u2019t put, so I put my hand in the pocket and I put\non. They saw this and they stopped me and they pushed me in their hallway and\nthey asked for money. But I didn\u2019t have too much and I offered them also a watch,\nand this was not enough. So I told them that if they will walk with me home, I will\ngive from my parents, I will get money and I will give. And that\u2019s what it was, I\nwas going in front, they were walking behind. An SS stopped three of us, there\u2019s\nOctober 7, 1993\ntwo soldiers and them, asking why they are walking behind this Jew. So they told\nhim that, so they were arrested by SS for mixing in, and I was arrested for not\nwearing the \u2014 the s \u2014 this was, by law, even that you could be sentenced for death.\nBut my parents used the intervention of my ex-German teacher, who was married to\na Italian foreign diplomat, and they went to her, and she was able to pull me out\nfrom the jail. I was only two days in jail. And I left, of course, Kielce the day after,\nit was my accident \u2014 experience was \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, they had the beautiful apartment in [indecipherable]",
        "A: Everybody needed to start to move, to give up this apartment, but it was time\nthat they permitted you to exchange, so that \u2014",
        "A: No, 1941. \u201940 - \u00b041.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: No, no, no, when \u2014 we talking about when the brother-in-law came back, they\nwere together and I was together with them.",
        "A: So he came back to his apartment.",
        "A: Oh yes, and my brother only went to bi \u2014 to the parents, to Kielce. He was \u2014",
        "A: And my sister and my two nieces.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, who \u2014 we\u2019re funny [indecipherable]. Many Jewish people\nwanted to sell their properties. Of course, not to Jewish people who were buying.\nNow, if this deal would be made after the Germans came, wouldn\u2019t be legal. So\nwhat was done, that was predated that it started before the war, it started some time\nin 1939, and then didn\u2019t finish, and in the beginning of the 1939, when war started,\nit means on end of ni \u2014 \u201939, by picking up mutual guy was sign as an agreement to\nfill. I was the guy whose supposed to be the guy who signed his own papers. So of\ncourse this way they were getting quite cheap the properties. Our friends were\ngetting the money and we\u2019re getting our pay for it. And that\u2019s what was a living\ncontinuously scared. From time to time they were catching us, the Germans were\nOctober 7, 1993\ncatching on the street and taking to labor. Sometimes one day only and sometimes\nwas a few days and a few nights.",
        "A: Yes, I was caught a few times to \u2014 to work.",
        "A: The physical work, digging and moving furniture and whatever they had to do.",
        "A: But \u2014 Warsaw, everything Warsaw, or in \u2014 or around Warsaw. They \u2014 this\ntime they were taking us by trucks and bringing back the \u2014",
        "A: Always \u2014 always \u2014 this time I was living with my sister and my brother-in-law, it\nwas in their apartment. Later the apartment was changed for apartment \u2014 different\napartment and also 1s a big as this, but they had other friends which are leaving.\nAnd this was going on until they started just to close. This time my father got a\nproblem with the prostate in Kielce, and needed to be operated. And I think that I\nam coming now close to 1942, this was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yes, I \u2014 in this time \u2014\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: You know, this is \u2014 this \u2014 everything is \u2014",
        "A: War was the same.",
        "A: \u201941, I don\u2019t remember \u201941 or something like this, because wait a second, wait a\nsecond, wait a second, wait \u2014 yeah, the \u2014",
        "A: Ghetto started in 1940.",
        "A: And this was this, what I was just saying before was everything about already in\nthe ghetto, what we\u2019re doing together with my brother-in-law and my sister, you\nknow, sending this \u2014 this was already in the ghetto. This time was very simple,\nbecause the courts, which were on the border between the ghetto, one entrance was\nfrom the ghetto side, the other entrance was \u2014 from the other side was very simple\nto get in. So that\u2019s what was this \u2014 the [indecipherable] were possible to do it,\nbecause you could go to the court and to \u2014 put in everything le \u2014 to make it legal,\nthis everything. Now, in 19 \u2014 sorry, in 1942, my father had already this problem\nwith prostate and was not permitted by Germans to be operated in Kielce. Was my\nmother who had so-called good looks, Aryan looks, decided to cover most of the\nOctober 7, 1993\nface of my father, he was very sick this time, took him by the train and she brought\nto Warsaw. He looked this way, that if wou \u2014 my mother wouldn\u2019t be there, I\nwouldn\u2019t recognize my own father. He had already infection, urine in the blood.\nAnd they tried, you know, to help him before operation, but in \u2014 he died soon after.\nSo this was only one member of the family that because of Germans, but was buried",
        "A: 1942, and I would say this was January 18. I will tell you why. Because January\n19 - 18, in 1943 was th \u2014 by Jewish, after 11 months you stopped talk \u2014 saying\nKaddish, and then a month later you saying the Kaddish, so I said this Kaddish and\nthe next day I lost my mother and my sister. So almost exactly.",
        "A: As I said before, we were lucky because we were ha-having help from our\nparents financially and we were making money, like I told you before. Yes, I am\nmaybe right now ashamed to say, to compare what was in Warsaw, yes we did\nhave \u2014 we didn\u2019t have \u2014 we didn\u2019t suffer hunger.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: As I said before, this was, on the beginning was a big apartment change for\nbigger, but some of the rooms were giving to the friends, mostly lawyers.",
        "A: From other si \u2014 from not necessary Warsaw. Mostly not from Warsaw, from\ndifferent cities, but by profession lawyers and they had so \u2014 was crowded but still,\nthere were still two rooms for \u2014 for us. And they \u2014",
        "A: Oh, this was terrible \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because example \u2014 example, I decided once to take a bicycle and to take a\nchance and to go to cemetery. And believe or not, I gr \u2014 I didn\u2019t make it. This was\nonce that I couldn\u2019t make it to cemetery because of Germans. Second time, when\nwar was over and I came back to Warsaw and I found my wife, I decided to go \u2014\nfirst I went to Kielce back \u2014 no, no, to Warsaw. Mixing up. And I decided to go to\nsee the grave of my father. I couldn\u2019t get in because this time Russians had the fa \u2014\nthe exercises \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: If you call it \u2014 this funeral. But anyway, not at least like others said, you know,\ntogether 20 - 30 bodies.",
        "A: He had this \u2014",
        "A: \u201942, a very important thing was that August 12, this date sticking in our memory,\nin group of our friends we decided that we\u2019re married, and also decided that we\u2019 ll\nnot stay together because it\u2019s not too safe, and especially that it\u2019s war, so you know,\nyou never know what will happen. So we\u2019re not together, but so-called, the whole\ntime when I was in all the concentration camps, I was wa \u2014 tho \u2014 thinking about my\nsisters, about \u2014 I knew that my mother and the younger sister are out. In\nconcentration camp I found out from my brother-in-law that my sister was arrested,\nthe older one. So I also wasn\u2019t too sure. Him, I didn\u2019t give a chance, her I \u2014 my wife\nI didn\u2019t give a chance to \u2014 she was too fragile, in my opinion. She was too much\nunder the cover of her older sister.",
        "A: I thought that my two nieces would survive.",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: No.\nA2: No, we didn\u2019t have anything.",
        "A: Just \u2014\nA2: We didn\u2019t have papers, we didn't \u2014",
        "A: Almost \u2014 almost two \u2014 three years later \u2014 no, two years later, actually\n[indecipherable] almost two years later, September of 1945, I found my wife.",
        "A: I found my brother-in-law, the name only, and I found the name of two my\nnieces, they made it.",
        "A: This is still going on til 1943. In 1943, I went to \u2014\nA2: Uprising.",
        "A: \u2014 Lublin. Upri \u2014 oh, this is uprising, I forgot it completely about the uprising,\nwhich I had preferred not to remember again, because its organization which I\nsupposed to represent, represent to be a member of it, which I found out was giving\nthe position where to be and a gun, only not bullets in it. And I was put together\nwith the other fellow.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: This was on the fight of \u2014 get \u2014 ghetto fight. And the \u2014 the German machine,\nautomatic machines shoo \u2014 was shooting and one of the bullets hit the guy which\nwas next window to me, hit in the face and took off the \u2014 half of the head, and he\nwas dead at this spot, and I thought that I got also a bullet, but not the face, only that\nthe head and seeing him, I thought that my head is off. So scary, which I told you I\nnever was a hero. I looked my hand and I saw blood, and I passed out. So the\nGermans woke me up and [indecipherable] and going and they pulled us to a\nplace, to a spot where was a big hole, because the other group of the fighters,\ndifferent groups, did mar \u2014 put the mine and Germans were killed when they came\nto this spot. So they were putting guys around and shooting them. And probably if\nthey would have enough, they would put somebody else, but I don\u2019t know. As long\nas we are waiting for [indecipherable] they pull my watch and they pulled my ring.\nThey didn\u2019t put us, they took us, and this was where I was taken to concentration\ncamp on the train and I was sick, because I had open only wound right here, and\ncontinuously bleeding, but what worse was, when stop bleeding, was closing my\neye. And this time I found myself on the train with my dear friend who just passed\naway, Henry Fenigstein from Toronto.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: In the last moment \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they \u2014 they put this in, the saying about hero, because after the war I met some\nof the guys who did belong to it and \u2014 and they wrote it on [indecipherable] paper\nthat I was, and didn\u2019t touch it because I wasn\u2019t a hero, I wasn\u2019t fighter, I was only\nfooled by myself and I was hit by a bullet, which I shouldn\u2019t stay there, at the\nwindow. But \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, when you\u2019re talking about that, I hate to talk about myself, is that\nfrom all my members of family, I was definitely the worst.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. The train went to Lublin, which was Majdanek.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: Terrible. As I started to say, this was not regular train only, you know, for\nanimals and we were \u2014 crowded is not the word. We \u2014 you \u2014 you couldn\u2019t fall\ndown. Wherever you could sit down, you were sitting, if somebody was laying on\ntop of you, conditions were awful. And as I said, my friend is \u2014 this physician,\nHenry Fenigstein, who was with me as a matter of fact, 1f I am alive now, partially\nbecause of him, because with a pocket knife, from time to time before coming, you\nknow, for inspection of Germans, you know, how we looked, he was cutting in,\nopening the wound, so was opening my wound, my [indecipherable]. And we were\nin Majdanek for a few days \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 as a matter of fact, I need to look up this, this is the Lublin, it\u2019s the first, one\nstop \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember \u2014",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: Only men.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: On this train were only me \u2014 I don\u2019t remember [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall, could be that the women were there too. I don\u2019t know, because I \u2014\nas I said, I wasn\u2019t feeling well, I was sick this time, because as a matter of fact, I\ndon\u2019t remember too well about the staying in Lublin, in the camp, and as a matter\nof fact, whatever I remembered, was funny story, Henry re-remembered differently.\nAnd we were sitting and talking about and he didn\u2019t remember some of the things\nwhich I said, I didn\u2019t remember some things which he said.",
        "A: Example, I remembered that there was a woman this time in Lublin and she was\na wife of a lawyer, young lawyer, whom I knew f\u2014 whom I met in Warsaw. And\nwhen she came and she saw me \u2014 she was working there \u2014 when she saw me and\nask me what \u2014 why I am, you know, ti \u2014 my suit was full of holes because, you\nknow, ghetto was burning and on the top \u2014 on the attics were most of the feathers,\nso there was \u2014\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: Flying down and was making holes in everything. So she went and she brought a\nnew \u2014 not a new, but a good one, jacket for me and Dr. Fenigstein. And I remember\nthis exactly, I cannot recall her name. He doesn\u2019t remember \u2014 he didn\u2019t remember\nthis. Now, I don\u2019t think that I made up this story, because I remember even who\nwas it, I cannot remember the name. I see her, I see him, even. And \u2014",
        "A: No, no, this \u2014 we were \u2014 only this was a all transition to send into different\ncamps. And I remember only that we had the inspection. Again the Germans came\nand picked up 600 guys. And with the help of Dr. Fenigstein I passed because he\nopened, and m-my eyes were open, the left eye was open too, and I was among the\n600 together with him, and \u2014 and again is a story which I remember, he remembers\nonly partially, that when the 600 of us were there, the guys who were working, and\nthere were Jews who used to be in the Polish army, they told us if we leave the gate\nand we\u2019 ll go straight, then we\u2019re going for \u2014 they will finish us. If they will \u2014 will \u2014\nwill pass the gate and will turn to the right, 1t means we are shipped to the other\ncamp. So this time I thought that this friend, this doctor told me, let\u2019s stay on the\noutside, so in case they taking us straight, we\u2019ll go up there \u2014 because they told us,\ndo whatever you\u2019re doing when you go inside, because you\u2019re going for finish. And\nhe doesn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember exactly, but anyway it was not\nOctober 7, 1993\nimportant because we came out and we turned around. I am sitting here, so we\ndidn\u2019t go straight and we didn\u2019t do anything. Came a guy by the name of\nFlaggs(ph), whom I wouldn\u2019t recognize except that I remember very w-well the\nname, and took us to the first camp, labor camp, which was Budzyn. And if you\nwant, because I have right here this box, which my friend was engraving when we\nwere there, and this was Budzyn, if we can read here, was on April 30\", 1943, and\nwe were there til February 14, 1944.",
        "A: Now, when we came there, this is funny story, when we came there, I didn\u2019t do\nanything because I went right away to hospital. And \u2014 and they decided that I have\n\u2014 surprisingly, that I have a malaria, this German \u2014 Au-Austrian doctor, Dr.\nFirsten(ph). I remember him because after the war, again, he became the Red Cross\ndoctor in Vienna. He told me when I came out from hospital, after few days, I don\u2019t\nremember, or a week, he told me not to get scared when I will feel bad, because I\nam coming back because usually repeats, and that\u2019s what it was. But I know that\nwhenever \u2014 how long I was in the camp, when I woke up, I asked the male nurse\nwho was there, who \u2014 with whom I became later friendly, I ask him, where 1s the\nmen\u2019s room? And he said to me, you are going every day, so why are you asking\nOctober 7, 1993\nme? I didn\u2019t know. He told me all my life\u2019s story because supposedly I was talking.\nReally, I went, after a few days, working again, this time working, going to.",
        "A: And what we were doing? Now, when we came to this camp, Budzyn, they told\nus not to admit that you have a free profession, except dentists and doctors. I wasn't\na dentist, I wasn\u2019t a doctor, so everybody else should say that he is a locksmith.\nNow, I never saw, in my te \u2014 I never held in my hand [indecipherable] but\nlocksmith. So there were few hundred locksmiths. And the next day they told us to\nclean the roof. That\u2019s was the locksmiths. Anyway, they didn\u2019t believe it that being\na Polish locksmith, we know what means locksmith, so they get us umschalag(ph).\nIt means a school again, and I this time, first time in my life I knew what means\n[indecipherable], I knew what is a [indecipherable] and I knew how to make it.\nThis was made there. And \u2014",
        "A: Were living in barracks, sleeping on the [indecipherable]. I think we had\n[indecipherable] one next to the other. What I remember from this time, I\nremember only most of it. I remember that the whole night I was running only to\nurinate, you know, that\u2019s what it was, because I decided one thing, food was not\nenough. Again, I\u2019m talking only about myself. But I wouldn\u2019t sell my bread. I was a\nOctober 7, 1993\nsmoker, and I wouldn\u2019t smoke. I wouldn\u2019t buy bread because I didn\u2019t have money. I\nwouldn\u2019t sell my bread either. So I stopped smoking and I was drinking plenty, like\neverybody was doing. Guys who were selling the bread for cigarettes were falling,\nyou know, swelling and dying. And \u2014 and I survived. Was one slice of bread for a\nday, and not a big slice, and bread was awful. But I shouldn\u2019t say this because I met\nin this camp a client of mine from before the war, who always, I remember him as a\nsick man, he had the ulcers, and rich fellow, but suffering terrible, all kinds of\nmedication. And I am talking about before 1939, even America didn\u2019t have too\nmuch medication of ulcers li \u2014 today we have miracles [indecipherable]. And in\nthe camp he suddenly didn\u2019t have any ulcers. This bread, he would eat as much as\npossible, and he didn\u2019t have any ulcers.",
        "A: Getting up very early in the morning, get together for counting outside. Getting a\ncup of the cold coffee, dirty water and this time you got the slice of bread, which I,\non the beginning I was breaking to eat half on the beginning and half later until they\nstole this other half, so I was eating, finishing completely. And this was not a bad\ncamp to compare with the other camps. And then, together we were marching to the\nfactory, which was not far away, by the name of Heinkel(ph). They were preparing\nthe people for making planes later, which in other camps I was working on planes,\nOctober 7, 1993\nwhich \u2014 we didn\u2019t suffer, but Germans suffered because no one plane took off. And\nwe, in my opinion, we didn\u2019t do this with purpose, we just didn't know how to do it.\nAnd if anybo \u2014\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Yes, after \u2014 this is an \u2014 every day the same story repeating, and when it comes,\nyou know, to conditions, as I said before, were awful, people were dying because\nthis was one of the camps, this was so-called labor camp, not concentration camp\nyet, and I am talking now because \u2014 about this Budzyn because from experience of\nthe other camps which I had later, they were not used \u2014 we were not used to these\nconditions. Example, I was dreaming always about a pair of underwear. Socks. I\nwas dreaming all the time in all the concentration camps, I was dreaming about\npotatoes, I don\u2019t know why not bread, but potatoes. Now, we can \u2014 we came to one\nday, they picked up in \u2014 in Budzyn \u2014 let me only recall what was the reason. Oh,\nthey call \u2014 pick up a group of people to send to different camp. And we didn\u2019t know\n\u2014 anyway, I didn't know this time that they are \u2014 they decided already to change\nBudzyn for concentration camp. I wasn\u2019t there when they changed. I was sent with\nOctober 7, 1993\nthe group to Mielitz(ph). And this was, looking in on my box here \u2014 excuse me.\nMielitz(ph) was February 16 to \u2014 \u201944 to July 24, 1944.",
        "A: Oh, the ba \u2014 definitely by trains again, the same ones, but not as bad as was from\nWarsaw to Lublin or from Lublin to Budzyn was a little bit better then. This was\nnot as bad, but the same crowd and the same kind of trains. And we arrived in\nMieletz(ph) and we got a lousy welcome. A good welcome from the guy in charge\nof the camp, the Jewish fellow, but a lousy from other people, because I don\u2019t know\nwhy, because not everybody was the fighter on Warsaw ghetto and they called\nfighters [indecipherable] heroes, and they didn\u2019t like us.",
        "A: I probably was in excellent condition before I went, because when I \u2014 when war\nwas over I was very light, but the UGA(ph) when checked, they found out\neverything okay, was exceptional. One left eye \u2014 and I thought that this \u2014 and this\nwas not, because if this, then the right eye would be wrong, but that\u2019s\n[indecipherable]. No, this \u2014 this was not on my mind never, and as a matter of fact,\nanswering this question, all my years in the camp, I don\u2019t compare to the way my\nwife went through not being in concentration camp. Because I had my number, I\nhad my yellow and blue Jewish star on then, this was showing that I am a Jewish\nOctober 7, 1993\ncommunist, because all Jews had this, and the number. And I knew that not today,\nso would be tonight, or tomorrow, this is the end, but I am \u2014 I was myself, I was\nalways myself. She never was herself.",
        "A: Yes, yeah, because I \u2014 the sign we were wearing only when was concentration\ncamp. Mielitz(ph) was changed to concentration camp. That\u2019s what we got, those\ntwo letters, which means concentrations lager. And we found out later that this\nwas under the Dachau. Everything from then, from Mielitz(ph) we\u2019re going,\nincluding that we went to Dachau itself, too.",
        "A: To Mielitz(ph).",
        "A: In Mielitz(ph) \u2014 in Mielitz(ph) we were working again in a factory.",
        "A: Th-\u2014 everything was prepared for war. As a matter of fact, again I need to go to\nex \u2014 my experience. I supposed to drill on an electric drill press, to drill one of the\npieces on an angle. And being later here in United States in the metal business,\nwhich I was, and I will come back later to you, how the life 1s playing tricks on us, I\nwas \u2014 I broke one of the bits. Now when you usually were getting five bits and one\nOctober 7, 1993\nbroke, you were going to \u2014 for more, which again, one of us was there and was\ngiving you not markings, so this way they didn\u2019t find out how many were broke.\nBut when I broke this piece, the piece was spoiled, because you couldn\u2019t get this\nhalf of the bits back. So I took out and I didn\u2019t know that the Germans were staying\nbehind me. When I took out this he says, you spoiled the piece. So I needed to pull\nmy hands, and he was giving me five whip on the right and wi \u2014 five of left. And\nthis cracked. And you would say bad, right? No, this was not bad, this was good\nbecause I was sent to the camp and in the camp the doctor put the stitches; 12, I\nthink, stitches he put, and the \u2014 I was sent back to the camp \u2014 to the factory. When I\ncame there, there were Germans, they knew everything. One hand, two hands, three\nhands, one leg. They send me to machine which 1s working only with one hand. But\nthen they came and they said, who knows how to write and read? And again\neverybody 1s afraid, but I had only one hand, so I picked up, I know how to read\nand write. To hell with it, what wa \u2014 wi-will be, will be. And they send me into a\nroom which was sitting a German at the desk and he was a \u2014 a draftsman. And he\ntold me that \u2014 and bu \u2014 I forgot to say only that in school my foreign language was\nGerman, so I could talk, and he told me that he will show me how to make \u2014 to\nbecome a draftsman, and will be his helper. Now, I don\u2019t know if he was provoking\nme or not, but every morning when I was coming there, there was a sandwich, I\nOctober 7, 1993\nthink a sandwich in the paper, and he never said that I should take it, but I never\ntook it. So this \u2014 that my hand was hit and I got the stitches, was only help me that I\nwas in a clean place. He permitted me even to wash my shirt, and to dry there and\nthen to put again on, and he ti\u2014 taught me how to be a draftsman. Not only to be a\ndraftsman, but German draftsmen needed to make on the machines the first piece,\nso he taught me even how to work on the machine. From there this \u2014 this camp was\nchanged to concentration camp, as I said before, and we got the letters and we got\nthe concentration camp uniforms, in Mielitz(ph). And \u2014",
        "A: Now what month was this? I will not be able to tell you because I told you how\nlong we were in Mielitz(ph) \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and then we were \u2014 this was not long before leaving Mielitz(ph).",
        "A: And this time we are already in concentration camp, Mielitz(ph) changed to\nconcentration camp, and of course \u2014\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: How we felt the condition changed? I think \u2014 because again, is something, what\nhappened, which I told you on the beginning, never was a hero, was a coward, I\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 this is only one army, the German army that I cannot recognize what \u2014\nA2: Rank.",
        "A: \u2014 they are officers, or \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 rank, never, never could. I know everythi \u2014 everybody\u2019s else\u2019s, I couldn\u2019t\nrecognize. Russian is very hard, but I got it. But here \u2014 or my head doesn\u2019t want to\nremember, or I couldn\u2019t remember this way, no faces. Now, I think that the \u2014\nnumber one, that we got electric wires around the camp. I think this time we got,\nwhich was not too good for us, not only because nobody was running away, but the\nguy in charge, this SS man had the horse there, outside the camp, and the horse\nonce, fly or something bother, and he started to kick, and kicked the fence, and\ndropped dead. So we were suffering because we killed the horse, so when you want\nto know about the conditions \u2014 I think the change was also that instead of \u2014 of guys,\nspecial army, SS came in and they were in charge of the camp. But other ways the\nconditions were similar ones.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: Yes, the same, that\u2019s almost the same, didn\u2019t change. Not that I recall. From\nMielitz(ph), as already, we went to Wieliczka. I remember now, I think that\nWieliczka, which were not too long there. We were from July 25\", to August first,\nso what was this, a week?",
        "A: Something like this. We were there and from there we were sent to Flossenbirg,\nI don\u2019t remember if Flossenbtrg was Germany or Austria, but anyway we went to\nF-Flossenburg, and we were there \u2014 the trip was quite long. Now \u2014 now \u2014 now I\ndon\u2019t recall here \u2014 you see, he made a mistake here and he crossed out this, and here\nis li\u2014 written that on September four, we came to Flossenbirg.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t remember if we left Flossenbiirg, because he has only one date,\nSeptember 4\", 1944 li \u2014 Flossenbiirg. Flossenbiirg was a very different camp. No\nother camp that I ever was, was the same. The \u2014 first, was in the mountains, and\nwas in a different levels of the \u2014 of the mountains. On the very top were Americans\nprisoners of war, on the very top. Now, we were, when we came there, they first,\nthey undressed us and they changed the \u2014 the places, so if you had something you\nhide \u2014 was hiding, you lost, because they took you naked to the other place. We got\nthe shower and then they gave you a potato sack. And everybo-body needed to go to\nOctober 7, 1993\nsleep in this potato \u2014 I was sure that this is the end probably, he will \u2014 we\u2019ll go to\nthe potato sack and this will be the end, but no. And the next day they gave us clean\nuniforms and we were there, we were not doing anything in Flossenbirg. Every\nday was only to get up, to counted that \u2014 that we were \u2014 that\u2019s what \u2014 probably what\nhe wrote to Flossenbirg, that we were very short time, and probably days only.\nAnd floss \u2014 Flossenburg we were sent to Leitmeritz. And I am almost positive that\nLeitmeritz was in aus \u2014 Austria, not \u2014 not in Germany. And there we were from\nJuly 10 \u2014 no, no, no, wait a second, June \u2014 that\u2019s right, no, August 10 \u2014 how can be\nSeptember there and August 10 to October 1944 in Leitmeritz. Leitmeritz,\nLeitmeritz, Leitmeritz is not far away from, because we heard about, was from\nthis show camp \u2014\nA2: Theresienstadt.",
        "A: Theresienstadt. And I think Theresienstadt was not in Germany, right, this\nwas Austria?",
        "A: So this was Austria too. And in Leitmeritz I have a very funny experience, that\nI was sent once by the guy in charge of our group to pick up the bread, you know,\nfor \u2014 for everybody. S-So many guys were sent, and I came there and the guys who\nwere giving out the bread was talking Polish. And so I turned to them and I started\nOctober 7, 1993\nto talk to them. And one of them walk away, comes to me and he says, where are\nyou from? And I was used this time, being so many years in Warsaw to say from\nWarsaw. And he says oh, so not you, because you remind me somebody. I said, not\nfrom Kielce? He says yes. And he not only get me the bread, for everybody, but he\nalso put the package of salami, which not only I ate, everybody, and everybody got\nsick. Okay, so this where my [indecipherable] Flossenbiirg \u2014 Leitmeritz, excuse\nme. In Leitmeritz \u2014 what would bring Leitmeritz?",
        "A: I always wor-working. Experience was \u2014\nA2: [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014I seen a \u2014 the [indecipherable] were almost that [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: I was always frightened.",
        "A: Because you see, as I told you before, I knew it. Said any day will come the end.\nI didn\u2019t know only how. And if I am not wrong, this was Leitmeritz even. In\nLeitmeritz, in our barracks specially, were quite few Yugoslavs. And very often,\nwhen you got up in the morning, one of the Yugoslav was hanging, suicide. From\nmy experience, the nicest people with whom I was in the camp, were the\nYugoslavs. Maybe because of language was similar and maybe of their behavior\nand maybe because of this experience, that I didn\u2019t come across in concentration\ncamp, of suicides committed by anybody else but Yugoslavs. And I promise myself,\nthis time I thought so, said when \u2014 I will not fall asleep. Only I will be waiting, and\nif I will see that somebody\u2019s doing, I will follow and I will do the same. A funny\nstory, when I didn\u2019t fall asleep, I was tired the next day and nobody did commit\nsuicide. But when I did fall asleep, somebody did. So what I figure out, probably\nwhen I heard the noises that somebody\u2019s trying to commit, being a coward, I fall\nasleep. I-I\u2019m not joking, but probably that\u2019s how it was.",
        "A: On the beginning I knew, when I was in the \u2014 in Budzyn, even Mielitz(ph),\nWieliczka, sometimes we got some news. As a matter of fact in Budzyn I got the\nnews from my brother-in-law that my sister was arrested.\nOctober 7, 1993\nA2: Now this was Poland.",
        "A: Because these are all Polish \u2014",
        "A: As a matter of fact, I got to the sister of this Dr. Fenigstein, who was playing a\nAryan, brought money from my brother-in-law. So we had \u2014 later we didn\u2019t. We\nwere getting some news. How they were coming, I don\u2019t know. I think that the first\nreal news what was going out, we got in Dachau. Then later, after the war I found\nout that they had the underground. But then we got what is going on, and Dachau\nwas already \u2014",
        "A: Yes, Leitmeritz. No, Leitmeritz we didn't know. We knew only \u2014 Leitmeritz\nwe got only news that Theresienstadt is not far away. That there is better, but\nnobody was sent there. And as a matter of fact, in Leitmeritz, and I read here what\nhe wrote there, that friends were someplace when \u2014 and I thought that in Leitmeritz\nthis was, but it\u2019s not \u2014 he \u2014 he wrote in some place that our friends \u2014 because there\nwere two camps, and you see, very often when the groups were sent to different\ncamps, there were at least to two different camps. And you could switch, you could\ngo from one to the other because I don\u2019t think that they did care really, if x,y,z went\nto one camp, even that they were release, because the \u2014 most of the release were not\nOctober 7, 1993\ncompleted because people were dead already by this time, or that they did care\nwhich ones are going. So if you moved from one group to the other group, they\ndidn\u2019t make a issue of it. And I\u2019m saying this because I am holding in my hand this\nbox which this Greenstein(ph) made, and he was there, young fellow, he was\nprobably four or five years younger than I was, and had even younger brother and\nwherever I went he was saying he wants to go to and I \u2014 in Leitmeritz especially, I\nremember that we\u2019re choosing and I said boy like that\u2019s enough it\u2019s enough. Maybe\nI am picking up the wor \u2014 the bad camp and you will suffer because you follow me.\nDon\u2019t. But he did.",
        "A: And so, from Flossenbirg, we went \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to Leitmeritz.",
        "A: And Leitmeritz we went to Grakow(ph). Now, I don\u2019t remember\n[indecipherable] \u2014 to Dachau, first to Dachau. And in Dachau we were from 23\nto 29 of October \u201944.",
        "A: And from there \u2014\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: Dachau yes, I remember. I remember the first, I will never forget in my life, on\nthe gate was written Arbeit macht frei. And the \u2014 Horthy(ph) was on the \u2014 on the\ngate, the gardener there. He was one in the uniform. I don\u2019t know even who showed\nus that this is Horthy(ph), but when we came here \u2014 and the other experience was\nthat they were keeping us outside on the \u2014 you know, not going to the barracks.\nBefore we enter even, they kept us for 12 hours with the toilets, you know, on the\nfield, because they thought that maybe people will \u2014 could hide something, you\nknow, that \u2014 that \u2014 so they had all worked out scientific \u2014 scientifically. And then\nwe were sent and I \u2014 if you saying about Dachau these few days, I remember only\nthat that guy in charge of this barrack, which welcome us, was number red triangle,\nwhich means he was a communist and had number 999. He was in the Dachau\nsince 1933. German, older guy, beautiful spoken, welcome us and told us that every\nguy, we get two covers. And please, when you will be leaving, I beg you, leave this\ntoo.",
        "A: The blankets [indecipherable] ghetto. But \u2014\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: Di \u2014 di \u2014 always you had this triangle and the number, which was changing from\ncamp to camp. As a matter of fact, I never remember my number. I remember what\nI was wearing, and I had to remember, because from quite long time, and I think I\nmet him in Mielitz(ph) but I got very close with him in Augsburg, or someplace\nthere, was a deaf mute fellow, an excellent tailor, excellent. As a matter of fact, in\nthe camps he was getting extra bread from Germans because he was fixing their\nuniforms. He \u2014 he was a artist. And whenever they were \u2014 we\u2019re called, he couldn\u2019t\nhear his name, his number, so what I was, and I could talk with him by hands. I\ndon\u2019t know language, but my hands, I could talk to him. So I pushed him when his\nnumber was called. And he was just deciding, if they said right and he wanted to go\nleft, he played dumb and he went left. So he was choosing, and he survived the war,\ntoo. Now \u2014",
        "A: No, Dachau was only, we were in this barrack, only few si-sis \u2014 you know, few\ndays and from Dachau we\u2019re sent for work to \u2014 first was Augsburg. In the\nAugsburg, believe or not, we were staying outside, out of the city, in suburbs, and\nevery morning we were walking through the city of Augsburg to the other side of\n[indecipherable] preparing for a airport, for future airport. And I don\u2019t know if this\nOctober 7, 1993\nwas really for the airport, that\u2019s what they were calling. We were doing stupid\nthings, digging and closing and filling and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and nothing, nothing\nproductive, but that\u2019s what it was.",
        "A: In \u2014 in \u20141in Dachau?",
        "A: In Augsburg we were from October 29 to December first of 1944.",
        "A: And then from Augsburg we were sent to Leonberg. Leonberg. Do you think\nthat I remember now Leonberg? I don\u2019t remember Leonberg too good because I\nknow \u2014 I remember that from \u2014 how long we were in Leonberg? We were in from\nDecember \u2014 December first, the same day. So you see, Augsburg and Leonberg\nare very close to each other because the same day we were there. Til \u00b044 \u2014 til\nFebruary of \u201945, only two months. So again probably \u2014 again doing nothing \u2014 not \u2014\nnothing important, nothing productive, no more was building the planes or\nsomething, that\u2019s what I recall. Then we were sent again to Kaufering, which\neveryth \u2014 every single one, Augsburg, Nuremberg, Kaufering, lager one, lager\ntwo and Landau and Ganacker, these are all camps of Dachau, which was\n[indecipherable]. And I don\u2019t recall doing anything except few \u2014 few experiences\nOctober 7, 1993\nagain which you had the example, in one of this Kaufering lagers, a guy wanted to\n\u2014 was walking too close to the fence, wire fence, electric wire fence, probably\nbecause somebody was throwing something. I was not a hero like I told you before,\nI wouldn\u2019t bother cross, and the gar \u2014 guy on the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Tower, sh \u2014 did the shoot in his direction and hit his testicles. And he grabbed\nthe testicles and run to this male nurse and he never knew what to do with that, and\nhe put plenty of bandages around, and few hours later we deci \u2014 they decided that\nwe changing the camp and going. And that guy was suffering, but this was shortly\nbefore the end of it. Americans came and they operated him. And as a matter of\nfact, we met him after the war, he was not only married, but he had children too.\nWhat else? Other camp, one vo \u2014 one of the lager, two, during the night, we were in\nthe barracks which different \u2014 you know, digged out from in the ground and on the\nroof above, and not too many guys, maybe 12 guys in one of this. And during the\nnight this \u2014 that mute guy w \u2014 was shaking me, I woke up in dark. I was asking\nwhat is it, and he showed me that we\u2019ll be going. Now, nobody heard this. He was\nright, and we were going to other camp. This was one of the very end. We went to\nKaufering. The name was \u2014 this was April fourth. And this is already 1945, so this\nis just \u2014 just before the end of the war, and we were in lager \u2014 lager one, lager two.\nOctober 7, 1993\nIf you want to hear \u2014 this not about me, but about the guys who were in the camp\nwith me. You know, in one of the camps, Americans came down and were shooting\naround the camp because around the camp the Germans put the small planes, and\nthe Americans found out about this, so they came down and they were shooting\nfrom inside the camp, not to hit us, to the planes, and the planes went on fire. And\nthe guys from the camp used this to cook something on the belly the planes.",
        "A: Yeah, this is the experience of \u2014 the last one was Ganacker, and in Ganacker\none day \u2014 it was Landau or Ganacker, was one day and they decided the whole\ncamp, wh-which if I am not wrong were close to a thousand of guys, oh, to take us,\nand the Germans said that we\u2019re going to Landshut. You probably heard about, this\nwas quite the camp too, and the specific camp, because when I was in Dachau the\nchimneys were not working, 1t means they were not burning anybody. But\nLandshut was still working. W-We knew that is active. And they were supposed to\ntransport us walking there. On the way, on a big one field, they told us to sit down\non the ground. And few minutes later, they disappeared, their whole group of s-m \u2014\nSS mans disappeared. We found ourselves without a guard. And as I said, thousand\npeople. And a German fellow, who had that green triangle, green triangle it means\nhe was a killer who was sent from a jail to the concentration camp, that\u2019s what he\nOctober 7, 1993\nhad, the green one. Tall one fellow, he told us why he was in jail. He killed a owner\nof a villa which he thought that is empty, and he went there and he found him, so\nwas one solution, him or her, or the owner. So they found him and they sent him\nback there to concentration camp. This guy, when he saw that the SS men\ndisappeared, went on a big \u2014\nA2: Podium?",
        "A: Not podium, though it was a podium [indecipherable] only pieces of wood and\nhe said to us, look fellows, we are in southern part of Germany, which is called\nNiederbayern. This is Catholic part of Germany. These people hate Hitler and\nJews. That\u2019s what he said. So from now on, no one is a Jew. We are Catholics, even\nwhen you are Protestants. Then you will get help from these people. And now we\ncannot go thousands, so let\u2019s make small groups and go. So we made small groups\nand we decided to go all different ways. Thousand people and only one fellow, who\nacted very nicely in all the camps, by the name of Markowski(ph), which was a\nsecretary in few camps, it means he was keeping books and everything, and he was\nvery nice. He told me that he is a lawyer from the part of Lvov, Poland. And I\nremember that in the camp, where we were this time, I needed to say Kaddish after\nmy father. And I went to him and I said to him \u2014 I was very friendly with him, and I\nsaid to him that I have a problem. I need to have 10 Jews to say the Kaddish. And\nOctober 7, 1993\nhe looked at me and he says, look, I don\u2019t know Jewish religion, but \u2014 you know,\nI\u2019m not a Jew, but I think that your religion is saying 10 men, not 10 Jews. Now if\nyou will not ask if somebody is Jew or not, I will call the people and I will say\nJoseph, it means we are 10 here. And you go to the window and you do whatever\nyou want. And so it was. He decided to take a group of Polacks. Polacks it means\nnot like us Polacks, only Polacks \u2014 Catholics, and I should take a group of 10\nJewish with us, and we will go together. We went together only for two days. After\ntwo days we had bloody noses. It started the calling names, and fights.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And we needed to split. He went with his group, we went with our\ngroup. Now, in this time, we\u2019re running away, not knowing we are in Germany,\nnot knowing where we\u2019re running. We were afraid \u2014 we still didn\u2019t know what\u2019s\ngoing on, if we will not come against \u2014 against SS or whomever.\nA2: And everybody thought [indecipherable]",
        "A: So we \u2014 we decided \u2014 we decided to hide during the day and move only in the\nevenings. And so we\u2019re doing. One woman \u2014 we came to a place, and we thought\nthat we are safe, then two SS men showed up and they grabbed us and they brought\nus to a\u2014a farm where they had already few other people, I don\u2019t know if from our\nex-camp or different camps. And in this we were watching and were two entrances.\nOctober 7, 1993\nOne was from the left and one was from the right. And the two SS men were\nwalking around this building, so we could see them where they are on one side, and\nwhen they coming on other. And being next to one guy, I told him, when they will\ncome on this side and they will pass, I am going out this way. I don\u2019t want to be\nhere any more. We made a mistake, I want to \u2014 and he says, I am going, too. Before\nknowing, six of us \u2014 ye \u2014 one knew about the other, when they came here, we took\noff, and we run. I-If you ever saw coward running, we were \u2014 we could break all\nrecords, until we came to the woods. After the woods there was a wall, brick wall,\nwe jumped over and we didn\u2019t hear anything any more, and walking. I told this\nstory because I want to tell you, after the war, when we found ourself again \u2014 we,\nmy wife and myself, in this part, in Germany, I took my wife to show her, and I\nwent to the same place, I showed her where are the two doors, and I said on the\nright door when they were on the left, we run, let\u2019s walk. And we walk and there\nwas a forest. And we went through the forest, we came on the end of the forest and\nthere was a brick wall seven feet tall. And I looked on it and I said no, this was not\nthis. Probably I made the mistake. This is the other side, it\u2019s the other door. I might\n\u2014 no, there was no the other door. I took all the guys who jumped this wall and they\ndidn\u2019t want, even one wanted to believe that we made this seven foot wall. She saw\nit. It was impossible. What you could do when you are scared. And that\u2019s what we\nOctober 7, 1993\nrun, we were s \u2014 hiding me and the other guy, because we split that more and more\nfor safety. And with the other fellow who didn\u2019t \u2014 who survived the war, but we\nsplit it after the war because he married a German young girl. She was younger than\nthe youngest daughter of here would be. And because of it \u2014 so we split it. We were\nduring the day in the woods and during the night were sleeping at the farmer, who\nknew that we are hiding because we were [indecipherable] of course. And one\nafternoon we were already tired to sit in the woods, we decided it\u2019s not dark yet, but\nlet\u2019s go, cause no movement. And as we\u2019re walking out from the forest, we see a\nJeep on the \u2014 on the highway and we stop and the machine gun went to our\ndirection and the soldiers shouting to run. So we started to run not moving, only run\nup and down, and I say I am running back to the woods. And the fellow says, I\ndon\u2019t think that we have a chance. And we came \u2014 we were so scared, that we\ndidn\u2019t see the American star.",
        "A: Then \u2014 this was called freedom. Few days later, when we got together, a few of\nour fellows from different hiding places there, from different farmers, we thought\nthat that\u2019s all what is leftover, you know, survivors. Everybody else died, probably.\nSo we wanted to know if any Jews are in American army. So we\u2019re waiting and\nwe\u2019re talking Polish and one of the Polish fellow American, when we ask in Polish\nOctober 7, 1993\nif there are any Jews in the American army, he said to me, Jews? Jews are in \u2014 in\nAmerica making money. Now, he didn\u2019t know who is his major because the next\nday was a big sign that they major by this \u2014 this name I don\u2019t remember now,\nAmerican name, wants to see all Jews. And we said this is the end, we\u2019re not going.\nSo we had one fellow who knew a little bit English, and we said, he will not grab\nthis one when he knows that there are other ones. So when he will not come back, it\nmeans that to me he wants the Jews. If he will come back we will know what is\nabout. No, he came back to tell us that he is a Jew, and he won\u2019t beat you.",
        "A: Oh yes, as a matter of fact \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 as a matter of fact, he was a major of the army, he was quite touched when he\nsaw quite a group, because I \u2014 he was the one who told us that we are not the only\none who survived, that there are other guys too. We were in terrible physical\ncondition. Terrible I am saying this way, that some of the [indecipherable] were\nnot more in the war, we were free. When we looked, I could see the \u2014 exactly all the\nbones on the face and of the [indecipherable] especially guy by the name of\nAckerman(ph) who few months later \u2014 and I am exactly a few months later\nOctober 7, 1993\nbecause we talking we were freed on May 1\u201c, 1945, and on the beginning of 1946, I\nwas back in the same part with my wife already. And we met this Ackerman(ph).",
        "A: We were \u2014 right after we were free, the first reaction was from the farmer, that\nwe didn\u2019t admit that we are Jews because we thought that this will be not nice to\nhim that we are playing Catholics to save us, that to \u2014 now to \u2014 to tease, so we were\nstaying there. I remember only that he wanted to give us to eat anything he has there\nand he moved us to his bedroom and he moved out from the bedroom. Two of us,\nhe put. And I didn\u2019t want to drink milk. I was afraid. I was skinny and I was afraid\nof fat. I loved milk, but I was adding water to it, and meat altogether I couldn\u2019t look\non it. So he killed a pigeon and \u2014 and \u2014 and prepared. But my friend who didn\u2019t care\nabout and was eating the meat, he survived too, and he \u2014 and he was okay. I was a\ncoward, I was afraid of everything. And as a matter of fact, I don\u2019t think \u2014 I don\u2019t\nthink that I ever admitted to this farmer, small farmer, I never admitted that I am\nJewish, even when I came later with my wife to visit him, because I thought he was\na nice fellow. Remember his name even, Markmel(ph). And \u2014 Peter\nMarkmel(ph). And as a matter of fact, he liked this fellow from concentration\ncamp, this was a green triangle, said that they are \u2014 they hate Jews and Hitler. He\nOctober 7, 1993\nhated Hitler, really he hated Hitler. Ha \u2014 about Jews, I never spoke to him about,\nso I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: After \u2014 after I felt a little bit stronger, I found out that not far away from\n[indecipherable] where I was staying, this time I was freed there in\nLangerfelden(ph), I decided to go to next town, which was [indecipherable]\nbecause I heard that there this Markowski(ph), which I told you before, this fellow\nwho was splitted, was preparing the Polish pe-people for repatriation to Poland. So\nI wanted to see him. In funny way I felt that I must go to him and to say that in my\nopinion, he is a Jew. And I came there, and I told him. And he said to me, thank\nyou, but I will to disappoint you, I am not a Jew. And \u2014 but it\u2019s nice of you, because\nI understand what you mean. And this was everything what I heard about him. He\nask me also if I\u2019m going to Poland, and I said yes I am going because I need to find\nout what happened to my family. And you know, in the beginning I told you that I\nfound my wife, my two nieces and my \u2014",
        "A: After I got back to Poland.\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: By that same train, which was taking the official repatriates, I went with the \u2014\nthe Polack \u2014 I went there and I just walked together with them and \u2014 but I wasn\u2019t\nofficially coming, but I found myself in Poland. As I said, I found my wife, I found\nmy two nieces, I fen \u2014 found my ex-brother-in-law.",
        "A: The \u2014 my \u2014 the \u2014 the story was this way. My wife, as I mentioned before, she\nwas false papers. She survived. She wasn\u2019t as \u2014 as \u2014 as delicate as I thought she\nwas. She needed to be strong and she showed that she is a strong woman. My two\nnieces were placed with Catholic families. My brother-in-law found himself in a\nconcentration camp for a short time on the very end. My sister [indecipherable] he\nnoti \u2014 notified me in camp that was arrested \u2014 was arrested because she helped him\nto survive and she was arrested and she was killed also by Germans.\nA2: Your other sister, too?",
        "A: My other sister was killed together with my mother, but this was in ghetto. My\nbrother-in-law was shot. They were taken to probably Treblinka, which later I\nfigure out.",
        "A: Very short. I was \u2014 was one month alre \u2014\nA2: No, but [indecipherable]\n37October 7, 1993",
        "A: \u2014no, no, I pi\u2014 I p\u2014I\u2014I remember where we left, because I came September\n1945.\nA2: In November \u2014",
        "A: And November 11, 1945 we left Poland.",
        "A: Because we went in po \u2014\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nOctober 7, 1993\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Number one, when I came to Warsaw I went to the Jewish Committee, like I\nsaid, to find out if anybody survived and I found out there that my two nieces and\nmy brother-in-law were registered. And \u2014 and my wife, which my friend said not \u2014\nyou will not find her in Warsaw, you will find her in Lodz. And I didn\u2019t look for ne\n\u2014 neither one of the nieces or my brother-in-law, I decided to go to L\u00e9dz. A one\nhour or two hours trip usually was taking the whole night, or the whole day,\nwhichever you preferred. I came to L\u00e9dz and I lost myself because I didn\u2019t ask this\nfriend of ours what is address of my wife. So he said to go to L\u00e9dz to the Jewish\ncommittee. I just took the train and went back to Warsaw to get the address, and\nthe next night I decided to go back to L\u00e9dz. Now, when I came \u2014\nA2: But I was under my false name.",
        "A: When I came there, knowing the address what I supposed to go, so I came. This\nwas a second or third floor walkup, of course. And I saw iron door, because\nsomeone had s \u2014 before the war even too, safety doors. Saw two cards on the door.\nOctober 7, 1993\nOne was the false one name of my wife and the other was written ell \u2014 I.\nWokaszevicz(ph), major \u2014 M.D., major of Polish mil \u2014 military.\nA2: Army",
        "A: I looked on it, door was closed, nobody home, I looked on it and I said I came\ntoo late. Because I don\u2019t know, probably from the stories you heard from other\npeople, that the husband were coming to the weddings of \u2014 of their wives. Here\nwouldn\u2019t be because we\u2019re le \u2014 really not \u2014 we\u2019re not legally married. So \u2014 and she\ncouldn\u2019t believe that I survived, and she couldn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t believe it that she will.\nSo I thought better let her think that I am dead, and I turned back and went to these\npeople where I was staying, only \u2014 family of my brother-in-law. And I came back\nand I told them that I saw this, and was a nice fellow. So sitting at the \u2014 in the\nevening and having the supper \u2014 because you know, we think differently in Europe,\nthe big meal you see in the lunchtime. So the small meal \u2014 he says to me, don\u2019t do\nit. You understand and you are honest. Go, tell her and just say that, bless her and\nthat\u2019s all. But at least let her know. I said, this is teasing, and \u2014 but I decided to go,\nlater \u2014 few hours later I went and the door was open, this \u2014 this iron door. So I\nknocked at the door. She came and backed up. So I said, hey, you made a mistake.\nSo I thought, turn around and go. But she says, what you staying, what you waiting?\nAnd I [indecipherable] and I said, who is the Major Doctor? She says this is Irene\nOctober 7, 1993\n[indecipherable]. She wasn\u2019t a doctor, she wasn\u2019t a major. But she had guts enough\nthat the war \u2014 she became later a doctor, M.D.\nA2: And she married a Christian and she didn\u2019t tell him anything.",
        "A: But she \u2014 this time she already was. And this time I told my wife, sitting there\nand telling about how I went and how she went, and I told her, what I went is\nnothing to compare what you went. And we decided that Poland is no more place\nfor us. Warsaw was a cemetery. Like I told you before when I went to Warsaw\nbecause I wanted to see the grave of my father, I couldn\u2019t get in. So, was only one\nthing to go. And to go [indecipherable] officially from Poland, I got to \u2014 one, I\nwas nominated as a judge for Breslau Wroclaw. Second, to get the paper to go to\nWest Germany, when I got nomination and they ask me when I was born, I said\nthis time, Eggenfelden niederbayer. And the secretary looked at me, I said, don\u2019t\nlook so at me, because I am Polish citizen, only my mother was pregnant when they\nwere in Germany, and I was born there, but my home 1s really Kielce and I got\neverything in Kielce. But when you asking me I need to tell you where was this?\nThis was, you know, southern part of Germany, that\u2019s where I was born. I figure\nmyself, I am from \u2014 born, and really the birth means so important. I am going back\nbecause my parents, when were in Germany, and they never were, and I was born\nthere, they decided to stay there for awhile and they buy \u2014 bought some of real\nOctober 7, 1993\nestate. Now, war is over, I want to sell the real estate, so I want to go there. So\ntogether we left, you know, Warsaw and we were going to Rychbak(ph), this was\nRychbak(ph) but through Wroclaw. And when we came there, we met a fellow\nwho was with me in the concentration camp, but he was working already for the\npolitical \u2014\nA2: Secret service [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014 ta\u2014 eff \u2014 F.B.L.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, Intelligence, Polish Intelligence. And we were sitting and after\nawhile talking, talking, he said to me, you know what? You\u2019re not staying here.\nYou will not be a judge here. You want to leave Poland. I say, I will tell you\nsomething, if I cannot tell you the truth, then I will not be able to tell anybody truth,\nyes I am. He says, with my blessing. I will do the same soon. And I said \u2014 and my\nwife told him experience which we had in L\u00e9dz. Right after I came, and I was very\ndis \u2014 weak this time. I was in good condition still to compare to everybody, but I\nwas skinny and weak. We were going and we decided to go to bakery to buy\nsomething, cake or bread, I don\u2019t remember and were few steps, as we were\nOctober 7, 1993\nreaching this bakery, a Polish drunk, about completely drunk, he couldn\u2019t stay on\nhis feet, was walking down and he recognize right away that I am a Jew and he said\noh my God \u2014 in Polish, of course, oh my God, I thought that Hitler finish all the\nJews, but there are more. And as weak as I was I grabbed him by the shoulders, and\nto the wall and my wife behind me, leave him alone, leave him alone. And I left him\nalone and she told this guy, and I said I still didn\u2019t forgive her because I should kill\nhim. And he says wait, hold a second. You wouldn\u2019t be able to kill him\n[indecipherable]. Now it depends who would come there. If I would come I would\nfinish this guy with a gun and not tell you to go, but if this would be a different\ngroup and this would not be a Jew, you would be the dead one. So you didn\u2019t do\nthose stupid things, but that\u2019s what was my welcome. So Warsaw was a cemetery,\nPoland was no more for me. We passed the border and of course I went to this part\nof Germany which I was free. Before we stop in the \u2014 on the way in Berlin, she got\nthe typhus from the German soldiers who were running away. I probably went\nthrough this in concentration camp, not knowing even about. And \u2014 and we were \u2014\nwe got to spend, because she went to hospital, excuse me, in Berlin. And then after,\nin 1946, we got the \u2014 because the New Year\u2019s Eve of 1945 we spent still in Berlin.\nAnd a few days later, officially the Americans took us \u2014\nA2: It was American \u2014\nOctober 7, 1993",
        "A: \u2014 from \u2014 because I was born in Germany, so they took us back to Germany and\nsince then we were there, waiting always that we\u2019ll go someplace, and this waiting,\nwaiting was til 1949. And what \u2014 our biggest mistake, especially my, because at\nleast my wife made it up, I didn\u2019t, was that through this five years of being in\nGermany \u2014\nA2: Three and a half.",
