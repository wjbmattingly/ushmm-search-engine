I was a sweet little frail little child,\nblue eyed and some blond hair and they \u2014 but I could speak German fluently and I said please, let\nme go with my mother. I am only 13 years old. And he said no, you stay there. He knew what\nwould happen if I went with them. Then another SS came and I asked him and he said ok, go\nahead. And the first SS said no, you stay there. And when they put my family, mother\ngrandmother, the old people and my mother was holding the sisters\u2019 hand so they put them in the\nshower and gas came out. Then they put the women and me in a shower. Before we went in the\nshower we had to drop all our clothes on the floor and whatever else we had with us. And \u2014",
        "Q: How does a 13 year old girl feel about doing something like that? Do you remember being\nembarrassed or humiliated \u2014",
        "A: Well it was humiliated because you didn\u2019t know what was happening. We went in and the\nshower, when we came out, we were naked and then you had to pick up any of the outfits on top\nof the pile. Take one and put it on. And just happens so that the one on top when I came out, the\none on top was a white flowered very long, of a woman\u2019s, an adult\u2019s dress, thin, real thin,\nsummer one. It was June but in Auschwitz it was bitter cold. And I had to put it on. And when\ncan I tell you, and they had, they had latrines outside and it was only some boards across. You\nhad to sit on that. But there was no paper, no nothing and the German soldiers were standing\nbehind you with guns. And so when we came out, I picked up that dress and it was lucky for me\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 20\nbecause after that whenever I went to the latrines, and I needed to use paper which we didn\u2019t\nhave, I tore off a piece of the bottom of my dress and I used this. And then after a while the dress\nalmost fit me.\nSo when we came out they got us ready to go on wherever. We didn\u2019t know where and that\u2019s\nwhen they took us to Auschwitz. We had to march for quite a while. Oh, and because it was so\ncold, my mother tore off no she had, no. she had a scarf and she put it on my head which made\nme look older. And that is why I even survived, because I was not as tiny and young as my\nsisters. This 11 year old and I was 13. I wasn\u2019t much bigger or, or older looking.",
        "Q: Now you\u2019ve finished, you\u2019ve gotten your dress on and then they take you to a barracks where",
        "A: No, no. We marched, we marched for a long time.",
        "Q: To where?",
        "A: And made beatings to walk faster and no food and when we got to Auschwitz, they loaded us\ninto barracks, about 1200 people in one barrack. Which means there were no beds, there were no\nblankets. There was nothing. You had to sleep on the floor and with 1200 people in it, you didn\u2019t\neven have much room. People were kicking each other at night. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you know anybody there from home?",
        "A: Not from home.",
        "Q: Did you see any familiar faces?",
        "A: No, but later on I had some, I made friends with people. There was one girl. I was 13, she was\n18. Her name was Blanca Brown and we were like family, like sisters. And I\u2019m going to tell\nyou, you heard of Mengele. Well Mengele would come to make selections to take the skinny\npeople, the sick looking ones. And he pulled them out of the line and put them inside the barrack\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 21\nuntil the search was finished. And that night a bus or truck came and they loaded those sick\nlooking people on and took them to the gas chamber. And killed them because they had no use\nfor sick people.\nOnly what they figured is 18 to 35 people who could eventually go and work in their factories.\nNow while I was, it\u2019s very important to me. While I was in Auschwitz, we were, Blanca and I\nwere very close. And because she was already a nurse back in Hungary before they took her\naway young, they had, they put her in the infirmary to help the German nurse. One day the SS\ncame when they had the selection, when Mengele put a young woman inside the barrack that\nhappened to have been Blanca\u2019s best girlfriend from home. They put her in and Blanca knew\nwhat was coming. That night they would take her away and kill. So she tried to get her out of\nthere. And they had only little window like very narrow little bitty window on top, up high. You\ncould not get in or out and so she found a box and I don\u2019t know how because I can\u2019t recall any\nplace that\u2019s possibly could have found one.\nSo she stood on the box, reached in and tried to pull her girlfriend out the window so she doesn\u2019t\nget killed. But they noticed it. They saw it and they put her in with her which means she would\nbe killed. The nurse from the infirmary walked into the barrack and said to her, Blanca what are\nyou doing here. Get back to work. She saved her life. That was most, most fantastic thing. So\nafter a while \u2014",
        "Q: To go back to \u2014 did you get a tattoo? Did you get a number?",
        "A: No because we got there in the middle of the night. They did not give tattoos. Otherwise I\nhave none but \u2014",
        "Q: And did you keep your hair.",
        "A: Oh, no, no. I\u2019m glad you mentioned. They shaved your head and when, before we were\nmarching to Auschwitz, I tore off a piece from the bottom, because it was freezing and tore off a\npiece of my dress and wrapped it around my head. And the German SS came to me, slapped me\nand pulled it off my back, head.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 22",
        "Q: Did you, you\u2019re in Auschwitz now. You\u2019re in the barracks. Did you go to work at all?",
        "A: No at Auschwitz there was no work. What they did was ridiculous enough. They had us go,\ncarry bricks from one end of the camp to the other. And then back. That\u2019s it. For no reason at all.\nAnd after a while when I was so weak from weeks after that I could barely hold myself up, no\nless carry the bricks.",
        "Q: What did they give you to eat?",
        "A: In the morning black coffee or tea, mostly black coffee but they, we had us lined up five rows\nof people. So we had from the first to the last like that. We had, there were five people that they\nwere giving coffee to in a pot. So they gave it to the first one. You drank some coffee, gave it to\nthe person behind and then to the next one and sometimes by the time it came to the last one, it\nwas all gone. That\u2019s all black coffee in the morning.\nAt noontime they had, everything was always that way in a, in one pot. It was a soup that was\ngreen, thin green thing. And when you drank it, you had dirt going into your mouth because it\nwas grass. They pulled it out of the grass and put it in the soup pot. That\u2019s what they cooked.\nThat was all. So I could not even drink that.\nAt night time they had, they cut the loaf of bread in small pieces. They gave you a slice of bread\nand you had either a piece of cheese which is one little slice and that was Clodiglee was the\nname of it, which was smelly cheese but it was very good cheese. Either the cheese or a piece, a\nlittle piece of margarine or a spoonful of jello, jelly, a spoonful. So one slice of bread with\nsomething on top. And \u2014",
        "Q: What did you know about your mother and your sisters at that point?",
        "A: At that point the, you know in the barracks there was one woman always who had, from\nPoland who came two years before and they killed all of them except some of these young\nwomen that they put them in charge of the new transports. When they came they were in charge\nof the barrack. And they had one little room at the end of the barrack. It was one long, long\nempty, dirty room. And they had a small room back there and they had a little stove there that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 23\nthese women had kept warm. They were not allowed to, these Polish women but they did\nbecause they had men come in from transports. Polish men were meeting the transports from\nHungary. And do all the dirty work or what they had to do. And they would occasionally come\nand give these Polish or Czechoslovak women something that they would steal from the train.\nSo they lit the stove and they could heat something. And now that was only for them. And they\nhad another tiny little room very small with a bed. And they slept there. They had cover. These\nmen had supplied them once and for all. And they didn\u2019t come, they couldn\u2019t come to visit. They\ncame to do some work.\nSo these women gave me once in a blue moon they gave me a little something to drink or a little\npiece of bread because when I got my bread at night, when I slept, some of those women around\nme stole my bread. So they gave me a little something.",
        "Q: Were there any women who helped others? In other words what was the atmosphere? Was it\nwomen helping women or, as you said somebody stole from you. But what about other \u2014",
        "A: Well it was rare. If you had somebody next to you that you were sleeping next to. And if they\nwere hungry I guess they took the piece but it was not as a rule.",
        "Q: Was it generally that women were helping other women to get through this?",
        "A: Well we were together. We had the same problems and \u2014",
        "Q: Were you the youngest?",
        "A: Yes I was the youngest, 13 because all the women were from 18 to 35.",
        "Q: The only one that young?",
        "A: Now at the -- oh yes, so then because I could speak German they made me a Iueforen [ph],\nwhich means a messenger girl. Can you come closer? A messenger girl and they would send me\noh and they gave me luckily, they gave me a jacket, a gray and blue striped jacket to wear and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 24\nwhen it was bitter cold we had to stand outside for hours in wet and cold and I would have that\non and it helped me. And so they would send me to the other barracks, to the women in charge\nor they would send me to the SS women who were guarding us. Or last of all they would send\nme to the gate, to the entrance, yeah to the gate to the SS soldiers with messages. I was always\nafraid to go there because I never knew what to expect, what\u2019s going to happen.\nAnd but, there was one woman I wish I could find her. There was one older SS woman. Her\nname was Bruner and she was tough. But she, they all loved me because I was a child and I was\na miracle child to be there with the women. So the people, these block guards or whatever in the\nbarrack, the women that were in charge, they were not allowed to light the fire in the little stove.\nBut and they used to put me outside the front of the barrack to watch if anybody was coming and\nif they did I had to run back and tell them and then they would put the fire out. So this time\nBruner came. And I was watching. And I had no time to run back. She wanted to go back with\nme. So she went way back and she saw the fire in the little tiny stove. She said who did that. I\nsaid I don\u2019t know. The window was open and she said who was jumping out the window. I said I\ndon\u2019t know. And she said was it someone who had hair or was, or did not. And I would not tell\nbecause those women had their hair. They didn\u2019t cut their hair and so she said was it a woman\nwith or without the hair. I said just bare, no hair. And she knew that anybody who lit the fire\nwho was in the back there it was the women who were in charge. And she loved the fact that I\nwas so wonderful that I did not tell the truth because that woman would have had trouble. So I\nsaid it was no hair and she was sort of smiling and walked out.\nAnd then this I have to tell you in a, before the rest of the story comes. But she loved me. And\nbecause I was such a, an innocent little child. And after at the end when they were dissolving\nAuschwitz, they sent all these women to factories and she came in and said williste kleine mit\nde blauer algen [ph], where is the little one with the blue eyes. And they said she went on a\ntransport. Ah, that was, she was happy because she wanted to take me out of there. Out of\nAuschwitz. So there were wonderful people too who could do as little or as much as possible to\nhelp you.",
        "Q: Did you see any bodies, any dead bodies, when you were in Auschwitz?",
        "A: No.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 25",
        "Q: You did not?",
        "A: No. And when we, when they came from factories to pick people to go on the transport to\nwork at the factory, others into cities, one there was a beautiful tall beautiful German SS, young\nSS woman who actually tried or wanted to get out of there with a Polish man. They were going\nto sneak away from there. But that was impossible. But she was very sweet and sweet to me\nalways. And she said I'll tell you something. Don\u2019t go just with any transport. I will tell you\nwhat is the best and that\u2019s the one that you should go with. So but first the transports came and\nthey were looking at the dainty fingers and somehow blue eyes are good eyes, blue eyes. And\nthey picked me to go to that factory. And they also picked Blanca to go to that factory. It was\nsuch a thrill that we still were together. So she got me to change wherever I was, she got me out\nto go with that transport. So next day they took us. We marched and marched to Weisswasser. It\nwas another city away. We had to march there. It was an ammunition factory.",
        "Q: What month was this, do you know?",
        "A: Oh who knew months? And so we were marching unbelievable hours, days. We didn\u2019t\nknow. And we didn\u2019t get any food on the march there. And we got to this little town and lo and\nbehold they had a house where they put us in there and they had bunk beds and they had some\nkind of water or shower or something. Once every in a blue moon you know they let us take a\nshower. But we had, you could wash your hands. There was water. You could wash your hands.\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Agnes Hoffman. This 1s track number two and you were talking about now being\nin this house with a little bit of water.\nAgnes Hoffman: Yes, yes, yes. It was amazing. There was a bathroom. You could go to the\nbathroom and not outside. In the latrine. Because while we were in Auschwitz, they woke us up\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 26\nat three in the morning to go to the latrine. And then back to sleep on the floor. So it was\nwonderful. Clean and we would sit on the bunk beds in the evening and we would talk about\nwhat we would eat when we got free. And we would only be able to think 1n association what we\nhad. Bread, coffee, and soup. That\u2019s what, we never could remember any other food except to\ncompare with what we had to eat. We got up very, very early in the morning. The stars were still\nshining. And we would march through the city, through the town, whatever, to the factory. And",
        "Q: Were you still wearing your white summer dress that you had gotten?",
        "A: Yes, the whole time. And it was amazing, the people. First of all the women, the SS women\nwere local women who really did not know how to be bad. They, but after a while they taught\nthem and a few of them were tough on us. But there was a family who had a little girl and as we\nwere marching, the little girl ran out and gave me. She was looking. They knew I was a young\nchild. She ran out and gave me some food and then ran back home, out. If they would have\ncaught them they would have been punished. But they did not care. And they did that. It was\nfantastic. And she would come every so often and bring me something.\nIn the factory, where I was working, you had to have very delicate hands with, you had to\nstraighten out tiny little wires which was part of an airplane part. And they were sort of twisted\nand you had to straighten them out. And that\u2019s what I was doing. Other, some people were\nblowing bulbs and heat with hot, with heat and they had tough work. But most of us were just\ndoing parts of this for the airplane parts.\nBut they were standing behind us, the German and they made us work faster and faster. And we\nwere -- and then we worked til late at night. And then they, we went back and they took us back\nhome. Home. And the next day, we were there the longest time in Weisswasser. But it was\nbetter than Auschwitz.\nWhen we started, we heard that there were airplanes coming and bomb these German factories\nand things. And they had us go outside and lie on the ground, on, and just be there while the\nbombs were coming. And we said thank God, maybe the bombs will hit them and we can get out\nof here. We were praying for that. But nothing happened. Then after some few months, we\nnever knew what day it was or date or anything, then they moved us to another factory,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 27\nHorneborg and if I tell you how one or the other was, I wouldn\u2019t know which one was which.\nSo we were, I can say that one of the factories that we went to had, it was in a salt mine. Inside,\nthat\u2019s where the factory was. And that\u2019s where we had to go. And it was hard to walk on the salt\nand all and that was a horrible place for us. So Auschwitz, Weisswasser, Port \u2014 oh Portar,\nPortwesfall was one before Hone, then Horneborg, port, no Horneborg, Portal, Bendorf [ph]\nwas the worst. And when we got there, people, everybody was full, who were there, they were\nfull of, a man is looking in here. What is he saying? Please, named us. You tell me. Ok.\nBendorf was the worst place. It was filthy. The people were full of lice. And it was just horrible.\nYou couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom. You could not have -- wash your hands or anything. It was\njust a horrible, filthy, dirty place. And we were there for a while. And from the, Port of\nBendorf, then they sent us to Hamburg. And then they had a bestial SS who beat us a lot.\nAnd it was a scary horrible place where we just didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to us. He\nbeat us. He just abused, abusive person, yeah SS.",
        "Q: You\u2019re a young girl. Is this and this is happening to you. Did you talk it over with the older\nwomen about what was happening to all of you?",
        "A: It happened to all of us the same way.",
        "Q: I understand that. Is it something you shared with each other about your feelings or thoughts\nabout what you all were going through? Or was it so traumatic that you \u2014",
        "A: Oh we were talking. We were all talking to each other about all this. What\u2019s going to be,\nwhat\u2019s going to happen. And it, yeah we talked but there \u2014",
        "Q: Were any of them very motherly towards you being such a young girl?",
        "A: We were, we were all like close family so there were some girls and I think when they came\nto Sweden, one beautiful one. She got married there. But I feel and Blanca had a cousin and she\ncame to America. And so we knew but otherwise, there we all stuck together.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 28",
        "Q: About how many women were you with?",
        "A: Thousand women in one barrack.",
        "Q: No, but then when you left to go to the different factories.",
        "A: Oh it was, I don\u2019t know how many fit in each \u2014",
        "Q: So now you\u2019re with this abusive guard. And you said he beat you \u2014",
        "A: Yes oh he was vicious. He was very, very vicious, very bad. But we were there for a little\nwhile.",
        "Q: Did he beat you particularly? Did he \u2014 you were not beaten? Did he beat you?",
        "A: No, no, no. But that was the last place. But when we were in the better places, like\nWeisswasser, we would dream about being home and we would sing and being, Blanca and the\nolder girls, they were, when we marched. We had to march 100 kilometers one time and we\nwould sing so the others don\u2019t cry.",
        "Q: What did you sing?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",

        "A: No, I don\u2019t know but we sang the whole time as we walked, we marched. We stuck together.\nAnd the unfortunate thing was well they had no use for children and babies. They took them all\naway. But one woman was pregnant. And she was due and Blanca took her into the barrack and\nshe delivered a baby. And then she took the baby to the German nurse and asked her to take\nsome care of. What they did was though, they destroyed the baby, most likely but she could not\ndo anything. But she wasn\u2019t allowed to have a pregnant woman. She wasn\u2019t allowed anything.\nBut we, sisters, that they had, the horrible brutal behavior of the SS by that time, it was all new\nSS, not the ones that were in Weisswasser. They had women, soldiers who were used to being\nbad. So it was very, very devastating.",
        "Q: So the last factory, the last camp you were 1n?",
        "A: The last place was Hamburg and I don\u2019t know if it was a factory or that was just a, I don\u2019t\nknow which is which. I know that we were working in ammunitions factory in the beginning. I\nthink. I don\u2019t want to quote Weisswasser was the big one that where we were there the longest.\nBut we were working in other factories but I don\u2019t want to say it because if people will know\nthere, they may say they didn\u2019t have one there. But I know that there were places that were out of\nsight. Like the salt mine. In there they were hiding those factories there. So they, we went\nthrough the hardest, the toughest and it was a miracle that I survived. I kept saying I wish we\nwere all, did we wished that God would take us away so we wouldn\u2019t have to suffer any more.\nI was a skeleton by then.

        "A: Hamburg.",
        "Q: For liberation.",
        "A: Yes. Ok. So one day we had a girl who they let us get out of the wagon to be outside the\nwagons. And one day she comes in and says I have news. Today they are going to cut the bread,\nthe loaf of bread, cut the bread in six, in four. And we are going to get some other margarine and\nthings but they will cut it in four which means you get a bigger piece, and not cut in six. And\nthen when it came, he said no, it was still cut in six. That they lied to her. And we still had the\nsame thing. And we always said oh, that girl, she always comes with these news and they are\nnever true. So we did not know that the war was over until she, yeah then she came in and says\nthe war is over and Hitler is dead. And we said ah, she comes with these stories. We did not\nbelieve her.\nThen they let us get off the, out of the wagons. And there was an engine, a train on the other\ntrack. And the engineer gave me a cup of hot water and I wrote in my story I couldn\u2019t believe it.\nI could wash my dirty hands and face. And then he gave me and Maggi cube and from the rest of\nthe water I put that in the hot water so I could have like a chicken soup.",
        "Q: It was like a bullion?",

So they loaded us in real trains and they took us, we really\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 31\ntook them to Denmark. And you asked the questions you want to ask.

He would kill us before, so it cannot be true that we are\nliberated. So but then I said but it was really true. They brought us to Denmark. And they put us\nin a school, empty school. They had fixed up bunk beds and white sheets and blankets and white\nnightgowns. We could not believe we got them.",
        "Q: Is this in Copenhagen? Or where, in Copenhagen?",
        "A: No. No. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember. It was close to the border. So it was the most heavenly\nfeeling. And then we sang and we talked about happy things and what we\u2019re going to do, when\nwe get home and then \u2014",
        "Q: Did you think your mother was still alive?",
        "A: No, no because the women that were there before, they said that they had put them in shower\nand they were gone. And, and then when I spoke to a lady here who researched it for me, my\nfather. Because he was the only one that I knew nothing about and she reached, and then she sent\nme the information and she told me that the last place that they took him was Bergen-Belsen and\nno more news after that. And that\u2019s where they were killing them. So \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 33",
        "Q: So now you\u2019re in Denmark?",
        "A: We\u2019re in Denmark and when we got, the train stopped. The people, the Danish people were\nrushing to us and brought us all kinds of things, cookies, chocolates, food, drink, everything.\nAnd little children and I wrote in my story that that was the most, the saddest thing because we\nremembered that our family were killed. They were gone. And we\u2019ll never see older people, Our\nolders and our children. We remembered that they are all gone. And what are we going to do\nnow without the family. And you want me to \u2014",
        "Q: Keep going. So how long did you stay in Denmark?",
        "A: So we stayed overnight and they brought us food and couldn\u2019t believe the wonderful things\nlike oatmeal or things. They had to feed us light food for the first, in the beginning and we could\nhave all we want. And it was terrific. The next day they put us on a ferry boat and took us across\nto Sweden, because Sweden went to Germany and asked them for, at the end of the war, and\nasked them to give, they should give them 5000 survivors. They wanted to take the Red Cross,\nwanted to take them to Sweden. And they did. That\u2019s why we went to Denmark and Sweden.\nSo then we arrived in Sweden. Next day. And they took us to another big school. And again\nthey had fixed up all the bunk beds and all the \u2014 they had us, they fed us wonderful foods again,\nall we wanted. And it was unreal. We \u2014 it was hard to really grasp that after one whole year we\nwere free. And, but then they took all the people who were sick and to the hospital and that was\none of them was me. And I also had an infection on my finger that was very, very, very bad.\nAnd they did surgery on it. You know, they took care of it and they fixed it. And then they x\nrayed and all the things. I was coughing. They found that I had a spot on my lung.\nI don\u2019t know here in America what you would call it but it was on one spot that was like it was a\nsign of lung trouble. And oh and in that wagon. You know when they put us in the wagon and\npushed the wagon into the woods, when they opened it, I don\u2019t know if I mentioned, 54 people\nwere dead in my wagon and I was one of the six that was still breathing.\nSo when I came to Sweden, they had to put me together. They had to nurse me back to life. And\nI was in the hospital for a while. And after that they fed me and got me healthy and didn\u2019t let me\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 34\nout until I was ok. And there we were very close again with all our friends because we were in\nthe same wagon. And they had a lot of visitors coming. First of all they had people from every\npaper in the world, overseas and Sweden and everywhere. My uncle in Australia saw this story\nand saw that I was alive. It was amazing. And so it took quite a while before they let me out of\nthe hospital. I have some pictures, very little but Pll show it to you afterwards. And they put us\nin \u2014 they had us in the school yard and people were coming. We were locked, closed off from the\npublic because we were sick, but when we were at the fence and the Swedish people came on the\nother side of the fence and they kept throwing things over to us. And because I was a small child,\nthey threw a small suitcase, this little one. That was the most precious thing in my life. That was\nthe only belonging that I had.\nAnd there was a young man, Leonard, fantastic. He was a gymnast and terrific. I don\u2019t know. He\nwas 20 maybe or 20, whatever. And he would come every day to the -- and one day he took his\nsister with Ann Marie and then she would come every day with him. And they said when you get\nout, will you please come and live with us. I said I\u2019ll tell you when we get out of here, they are\ngoing to take us to a school. But after I get out of the school, I will come to you. I would love\nto.\nAnd when I came back ten years ago to Sweden, the newspapers came out because they came out\nthe first time when I was there. They came out and they asked Leonard, how come that you got\nfriendly with her, a child. He said that\u2019s because she was so sweet. She looked so sweet that I\nhad to, a sweet, a child that I had to take care of her. You know have and Ann Marie, his sister,\nhe wanted her to come and live with us. And their mother had died, long time before, but their\nfather, Fabro Gustav, Uncle Gustav was the sweetest man in the whole wide world and he loved\nme like he loves his own children. And he pampered me. He was so \u2014 I lived with them for quite\na while.",
        "Q: How long did you live with them?",
        "A: At least one year, at least. I don\u2019t remember, but I know at least a year.",
        "Q: And then where did you go after, where in Sweden, what town in Sweden were you?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 35",
        "A: Ok, wait, wait. I'll tell you. First after we got out of that school",
        "Q: The hospital?",
        "A: And the, yes.",
        "Q: Then you went to the school after the hospital.",
        "A: And they took us first to Visings6 which was an island in Sweden, beautiful island. And there\nthey had us in a school. They were teaching us. They had profess \u2014 they came from everywhere.\nThey taught us everything and they were both Hungarians and Polish and young and boys and\ngirls and women. But the women, they had little cute little houses. It was like a resort. And we\nwere very happy there. And from there on, later on they sent us to a school up north. Was\nanother school. And we were there for quite a while. And last of all, they brought us back to\nStockholm and by then we were well and \u2014",
        "Q: When you keep saying they, you mean the Red Cross?",
        "A: Yes oh yes. Red Cross or the UN or whoever, all the people that were giving us their lives.\nYou know help. And \u2014",
        "Q: So now you\u2019re in Stockholm?",
        "A: Yes, but outside of Stockholm was a town called Helsingborg and that\u2019s where they brought\nus. It was a boarding school. And then they had people coming from everywhere. There were\nactors, there were \u2014 I mean every kind of company or organizations that would come and\nwanted, and wrote articles and treated us to certain things. So when we got out of there, one day I\nhave to tell you a story. One day that is after, in Sweden after camp, that was the last school.\nAnd one day I said to a girlfriend of mine, let\u2019s go visit another school on the other side of\nStockholm\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 36",
        "Q: You sound like a very independent young woman.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Yes. Well they told us how to take the train and take the bus to the other school. By\nthat time we knew what was around. So we got on the bus and we went to the school but I had \u2014\noh I had my little suitcase with me. And when we were in Stockholm, in the street we saw a lady\nmunching on an ice cream cone. And we had a little bit of money, not much. And we were\nexcited. We wanted one. So we went up to the guy, the cart and we said two please. And he\nopened the top and gave us and opened up the buns, hot dog. And that\u2019s and when we saw it we\nwere shocked. We never had seen that. We wanted ice cream. So we gave him the money and\ngot the hot dog. So we were ashamed of having it because in Hungary when you went to the\nmarket people were selling sausage, hot dogs. And that was not nice thing to do. You know. I\nknow in Budapest and 1n big cities they would sell those things but we didn\u2019t know. Its children.\nAnd so what we did was I put the hot dogs inside the suitcase and I was going to throw it away\nwhen we got to a place.\nSo we went to the school and then we came, when the end of the day, we came back. We were\nstanding at the bus stop waiting. And the bus came, had to rush to get on it. And I forgot the\nsuitcase on, in the street outside the bus. So then oh my god, once I was on the bus, took off, I\nsaid I left my suitcase and so I asked the driver and he said you can call lost and found. And I\ndidn\u2019t even know what it was or the name. I called next day. I called lost and found and they said\ncan you describe it. I said yes, a small suitcase. And he said what was inside of it. And I said a\ncold dog. Oh no he didn\u2019t ask then. So we went to pick it up next day and that\u2019s when he asked\nwhat was inside. And when I \u2014 I was so embarrassed, opened it up and there was the hot dog.\nAnd he laughed so hard and gave me the little suitcase.\nAnd I had a fantastic life for a year with Ann Marie and Leonard. They were brother and sister\nto me. And then the newspapers came out to Ann Marie\u2019s, to their house. And they wrote the\narticle. Oh but I forgot to say is that when we got back, the first thing they did to us before we\neven stepped into any clean place, they disinfected us. Cleaned us. No lice, no, no nothing so we\nwere clean already. And but Ann Marie was working for a company but she was only a few\nmaybe, six, seven years older. Maybe she was 23 or 25 but she was like a mother to me. And\nLeonard was like a brother who spoiled me and he was a gymnast and when he went on a trip\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 37\noverseas with the gym, national gymnasts. He came back and he brought me a little ring from\nsome other Middle Eastern country. I haven\u2019t got it. Somebody got it from me.",
        "Q: Did you want to go back to Hungary at that point?",

        "Q: No, I meant did you want to go back.",
        "A: No, no. I wanted to come to America. But first in Sweden, I was in Sweden for five years and\nthey sent me to boarding school and they, then when I got out and I lived with Ann Marie, then I\ngot a job at, with five of \u2014 by then I could, I taught myself Swedish. I looked the words up in the\ndictionaries and I was one of the few who could speak Swedish after such a short time. So I let\u2019s\nsee.",
        "Q: Now it\u2019s 1950.",
        "A: Yes, but before that, in Sweden, I got a job with five of the top women\u2019s magazine to translate\nstories because I could speak languages from other countries to, into Swedish and that was such\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 38\na thrill that here is a greenhorn who can work in, to do this for a magazine. It was unheard of,\nunbelievable. So but before that I had my first job there. I\u2019m telling you about the fun one.\nBefore they were making marzipan in big kettle and all I had to do is stir the big kettle with the\nmarzipan. But after that I got that good job and it was fantastic. And we had this is \u2014 we had\nlots, in Helsingborg in that boarding school, we had lots and lots, the last place, lots of visitors.\nAnd they were like I said actors. They were pianists, they were \u2014 to entertain us and things.\nThey had a Hungarian ballet dancer who had a place. You know she had a school to teach ballet.\nAnd she would come to the boarding school to check to see who would be good to bring to her\nschool.\nIt\u2019s so funny. And of course I\u2019m dancing with the movements and because my father used to\nteach me to dance. And I did Latin and tango and fox, everything, but here when the music was\non, I was gyrating with my Latin movements. She says no, that won\u2019t do. No ballerina. So that\nwas very funny. And then we, yes and then we had a pianist. A young man that was very good\nlooking. And all the girls were surrounded him, with him. And I did not. I was a child still but I\nwas still, I didn\u2019t. And so that was Yalmar, Yalmar. And that was the one time that I saw him.\nThen many, many years later, I mean towards the last year in Sweden, I was in, at a party and\nwhom do I see but Yalmar. Then he started to take me out. And he had asked me to marry him.\nAnd I wanted to go to America. I said no but I \u2014 here I was a young woman before I was \u2014 oh\nthank you, thank you.\nBefore I was a child and now I was a young woman that he asked me to marry him. He wanted\nme to stay in Sweden and I just turned him down and I said when I come to America, if I don\u2019t\nlike it Pll write to you of course. That did not happen but it was exciting to be considered a\nhuman being after that. So then Ann Marie said \u2014 oh we joined, they joined. They were in a\nsports club where the sports club had a base in, close to a wood. They had a building and the\nfamilies could come with children or the young people to come and for weekends. And they had\nall kinds of outdoor sports and all so Ann Marie said to me, the vacation is coming. And we, the\nother girl , Bisa from the building, other friend and her, we\u2019re going to the sports club\u2019s\nheadquarters, the ten. Are you going? I said no. Because I read a magazine that the Swedish\npeace organization will pay for any young people, anywhere in the world to come to outside of\nStockholm to a farmer that will give you a job for six weeks and give you and pay you for the\nwork. And you had to sleep and live in tents. I said that\u2019s where I\u2019m going because they want to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 39\nprove that young people, all kinds of people in the world can live together in peace. And I said\nthat\u2019s where I\u2019m going.\nSo when I went there they came out to visit us from the UN. And the Swedish organization.\nThey said we are going to Switzerland to a UN world conference for three weeks. Would you\nlike to go with us? We will cover all your expenses. And that was because I could speak all the\nlanguages and the Swedes at that time hardly knew English. They did. So I said yes, I would\nlove to go and then in the mean, I said I'd love to go. As I said we\u2019re going in six cars and with\nthe statesmen and their wives.\nBut then in the camp where I was in the tents, this young woman stopped by one night and said\nyou know I was hitchhiking here and a man, 65 year old man, had given me a ride. And he asked\nme if I would want to be a governess for his 11 year old child, son. And he lived in a mansion\nand he was a president of the biggest steel factory. And she said I would have loved to but I told\nhim that I\u2019m getting married so I can\u2019t. But Agnes, judging you, the way that you speak\nlanguages, you are acting perfect for a job like that and I recommend you to the man. So she\nwrote to him and he invited me to his mansion to see if I would like it.\nSo when I got there, the chauffeur met me and then they drove into the front of the mansion. It\nwas like a dream. And he, after a while, after he talked to me for a while. He said I\u2019d love for\nyou to come and take the job. I said I would love to but I can\u2019t because I am going to\nSwitzerland to a UN world conference for three weeks. And he said I will wait. You come back\nand after that you come here. So I did and I took the job of a dream. The mansion was absolutely\nbreath taking. He had all the servants, all the workers but he wanted someone who could always\nbe a family member so when he went. He traveled a lot for business and he wanted someone who\nwas close to the boy, not just the servants. So I said ok. Pll be back, yeah when I came and I\ntook the job. My friends were dukes, baronesses and barons, all and every weekend he had lots\nof guests. He had this was his second marriage for the 11 year old boy and a six year old girl\nwho was with her mother. But he had grown son who was running their plant in South America.\nHe had a daughter who was in New York in a theater. She was a designer, stage designer. They\nwere grown people. They were and so it was fantastic that he had chosen me to be able to meet\nall those famous people. They were all kinds of, and locally. And there was an engineer\u2019s hotel\nthere. That he was associated with too. And every time he got an invitation to any big affair\nthere, they sent me an invitation too.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 40",

A huge lounge where the people when they came to the movie theater and had to wait,\nthey went up there and sat and relaxed.

        "A: Well it was very nice. The people that we knew had a nice place. And we were not there\nvery long. And they started to bomb Hungary. And actually they started, not in the ghetto. They\nstarted to bomb where we lived at first, in like a small house. But not like the American kind of\nhouses. And they were bombing and we had to go down to the shelter. And my grandmother\u2019s\nsister Johanna, she would not go. She didn\u2019t hear the sirens to go. She didn\u2019t hear the airplanes\nand the bombing and we told her we had to go down. She says no. She sat down by the window\nand she was praying from her prayers book. So she stayed there while we were down below.\nAnd when we came back up, all around, they had bombed the area. But where she sat was\nperfect. She didn\u2019t even hear the bombs because that window where she sat was perfect.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 15",
        "A: Just 1t was a normal home that they had. The children were not in those days and in that kind\nof times, it was not like you. I don\u2019t recall us doing anything on the outside. They wouldn\u2019t want\nus to go outside.",
        "A: At the very end, from there, they, it was an empty, in a factory, how do you call. Brick. A\nbrick factory. And it had a place outside, a huge one, no sides. Only an awning over it. And we\nwere there.",
        "A: Well they made us. The Germans came and they brought everybody how they let us know, I\ndon\u2019t know. But everybody had to move in there. That was the next step before Auschwitz. And\nit, all you could take with you from your home was what you could carry with you in your hands.\nSo we took blankets and pillow and whatever necessity we could carry with us in our hands.\nBecause the people that we stayed with initially they had a home. And we were ok there. But \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "A: Well I do want to tell you something. When, the last time, just before we moved to the ghetto\nthe first time, we had to leave our home, lock the door and give them the key. So as we stepped\noutside, last, after we locked the door, gave up the key, the mailman came and brought a\npostcard addressed to me. From my father. Because when they caught my father, they put him\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 16\nin a camp in Hungary, in some kind of \u2014 and that was for political prisoners. Because he would,\nhe took off the star. So \u2014",
        "A: No. We never knew. So the card said, Agnes, you are, you should help your mother with\nyour sisters and you are now old enough to read Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace and it is on the shelf\nand he exactly explained where it was located. He hid it. And it was too late to get it. The reason\nwhy he was saying that I\u2019m old enough to read it and tell me he was hoping. He didn\u2019t know\nthat we were going to the ghetto and he wanted us to, me to take the book, wherever we went.\nBut it wouldn\u2019t have done any good because they would have taken, they took everything away\nfrom us anyway. So. That was \u2014 and, and then we were under the \u2014",
        "A: In the brick factory. We were there for I don\u2019t know, one week or two weeks. I really cannot\njudge anymore how long, but not that long. And they were ready to load us up in car wagons and\ntake us, destination Auschwitz.",
        "A: They brought some, they brought some but it wasn\u2019t very much. I offered to help serve.\nActually they asked me how I could help and I don\u2019t know if I helped in the kitchen maybe one\nday. To do dishes or whatever that was. But that was it. Loaded us up and on the way to\nAuschwitz. We didn\u2019t really know where we were going. But my father was gone already you\nknow, taken away before.",
        "A: Never came back. And I got the research here and can I tell you what it said.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 17",
        "A: It said that from Hungary they took him to Auschwitz, but only for two days. From\nAuschwitz to Dachau, not Dachau. Another camp and from there to Bergen-Belsen and that was\nthe last stop. The last information. And when I called my aunt who is older than I am and she\nwas in Germany and after the war, she stayed for a while. I told her what they said to me about\nmy father. And she said Bergen-Belsen, that\u2019s where they were killing them. That\u2019s why they\nhad no more information after that. That was it.",
        "A: Yes. I wrote that she was only 35 years old but she had showed strength and did not show any\nfear and my grandmother also. She held some sisters\u2019 hand and she also was very strong. And\ngave us a lot of strength, not to, not to know really what was going to happen.",

They said that women, they took women\nfrom 18 to 35 that they put in one group. So they took me, the SS took me and put me in with the\nwomen from 18 to 35.",
        "A: No. I didn\u2019t. I will show you sort of a picture afterwards. I was a sweet little frail little child,\nblue eyed and some blond hair and they \u2014 but I could speak German fluently and I said please, let\nme go with my mother. I am only 13 years old. And he said no, you stay there. He knew what\nwould happen if I went with them. Then another SS came and I asked him and he said ok, go\nahead. And the first SS said no, you stay there. And when they put my family, mother\ngrandmother, the old people and my mother was holding the sisters\u2019 hand so they put them in the\nshower and gas came out. Then they put the women and me in a shower. Before we went in the\nshower we had to drop all our clothes on the floor and whatever else we had with us. And \u2014",

We went in and the\nshower, when we came out, we were naked and then you had to pick up any of the outfits on top\nof the pile. Take one and put it on. And just happens so that the one on top when I came out, the\none on top was a white flowered very long, of a woman\u2019s, an adult\u2019s dress, thin, real thin,\nsummer one. It was June but in Auschwitz it was bitter cold. And I had to put it on. And when\ncan I tell you, and they had, they had latrines outside and it was only some boards across. You\nhad to sit on that. But there was no paper, no nothing and the German soldiers were standing\nbehind you with guns. And so when we came out, I picked up that dress and it was lucky for me\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 20\nbecause after that whenever I went to the latrines, and I needed to use paper which we didn\u2019t\nhave, I tore off a piece of the bottom of my dress and I used this. And then after a while the dress\nalmost fit me.\nSo when we came out they got us ready to go on wherever. We didn\u2019t know where and that\u2019s\nwhen they took us to Auschwitz. We had to march for quite a while. Oh, and because it was so\ncold, my mother tore off no she had, no. she had a scarf and she put it on my head which made\nme look older. And that is why I even survived, because I was not as tiny and young as my\nsisters. This 11 year old and I was 13. I wasn\u2019t much bigger or, or older looking.",
        "A: No, no. We marched, we marched for a long time.",
        "A: And made beatings to walk faster and no food and when we got to Auschwitz, they loaded us\ninto barracks, about 1200 people in one barrack. Which means there were no beds, there were no\nblankets. There was nothing. You had to sleep on the floor and with 1200 people in it, you didn\u2019t\neven have much room. People were kicking each other at night. And \u2014",
        "A: Not from home.",
        "A: No, but later on I had some, I made friends with people. There was one girl. I was 13, she was\n18. Her name was Blanca Brown and we were like family, like sisters. And I\u2019m going to tell\nyou, you heard of Mengele. Well Mengele would come to make selections to take the skinny\npeople, the sick looking ones. And he pulled them out of the line and put them inside the barrack\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 21\nuntil the search was finished. And that night a bus or truck came and they loaded those sick\nlooking people on and took them to the gas chamber. And killed them because they had no use\nfor sick people.\nOnly what they figured is 18 to 35 people who could eventually go and work in their factories.\nNow while I was, it\u2019s very important to me. While I was in Auschwitz, we were, Blanca and I\nwere very close. And because she was already a nurse back in Hungary before they took her\naway young, they had, they put her in the infirmary to help the German nurse. One day the SS\ncame when they had the selection, when Mengele put a young woman inside the barrack that\nhappened to have been Blanca\u2019s best girlfriend from home. They put her in and Blanca knew\nwhat was coming. That night they would take her away and kill. So she tried to get her out of\nthere. And they had only little window like very narrow little bitty window on top, up high. You\ncould not get in or out and so she found a box and I don\u2019t know how because I can\u2019t recall any\nplace that\u2019s possibly could have found one.\nSo she stood on the box, reached in and tried to pull her girlfriend out the window so she doesn\u2019t\nget killed. But they noticed it. They saw it and they put her in with her which means she would\nbe killed. The nurse from the infirmary walked into the barrack and said to her, Blanca what are\nyou doing here. Get back to work. She saved her life. That was most, most fantastic thing. So\nafter a while \u2014",
        "A: No because we got there in the middle of the night. They did not give tattoos. Otherwise I\nhave none but \u2014",
        "A: Oh, no, no. I\u2019m glad you mentioned. They shaved your head and when, before we were\nmarching to Auschwitz, I tore off a piece from the bottom, because it was freezing and tore off a\npiece of my dress and wrapped it around my head. And the German SS came to me, slapped me\nand pulled it off my back, head.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 22",
        "A: No at Auschwitz there was no work. What they did was ridiculous enough. They had us go,\ncarry bricks from one end of the camp to the other. And then back. That\u2019s it. For no reason at all.\nAnd after a while when I was so weak from weeks after that I could barely hold myself up, no\nless carry the bricks.",
        "A: In the morning black coffee or tea, mostly black coffee but they, we had us lined up five rows\nof people. So we had from the first to the last like that. We had, there were five people that they\nwere giving coffee to in a pot. So they gave it to the first one. You drank some coffee, gave it to\nthe person behind and then to the next one and sometimes by the time it came to the last one, it\nwas all gone. That\u2019s all black coffee in the morning.\nAt noontime they had, everything was always that way in a, in one pot. It was a soup that was\ngreen, thin green thing. And when you drank it, you had dirt going into your mouth because it\nwas grass. They pulled it out of the grass and put it in the soup pot. That\u2019s what they cooked.\nThat was all. So I could not even drink that.\nAt night time they had, they cut the loaf of bread in small pieces. They gave you a slice of bread\nand you had either a piece of cheese which is one little slice and that was Clodiglee was the\nname of it, which was smelly cheese but it was very good cheese. Either the cheese or a piece, a\nlittle piece of margarine or a spoonful of jello, jelly, a spoonful. So one slice of bread with\nsomething on top. And \u2014",
        "A: At that point the, you know in the barracks there was one woman always who had, from\nPoland who came two years before and they killed all of them except some of these young\nwomen that they put them in charge of the new transports. When they came they were in charge\nof the barrack. And they had one little room at the end of the barrack. It was one long, long\nempty, dirty room. And they had a small room back there and they had a little stove there that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 23\nthese women had kept warm. They were not allowed to, these Polish women but they did\nbecause they had men come in from transports. Polish men were meeting the transports from\nHungary. And do all the dirty work or what they had to do. And they would occasionally come\nand give these Polish or Czechoslovak women something that they would steal from the train.\nSo they lit the stove and they could heat something. And now that was only for them. And they\nhad another tiny little room very small with a bed. And they slept there. They had cover. These\nmen had supplied them once and for all. And they didn\u2019t come, they couldn\u2019t come to visit. They\ncame to do some work.\nSo these women gave me once in a blue moon they gave me a little something to drink or a little\npiece of bread because when I got my bread at night, when I slept, some of those women around\nme stole my bread. So they gave me a little something.",
        "A: Well it was rare. If you had somebody next to you that you were sleeping next to. And if they\nwere hungry I guess they took the piece but it was not as a rule.",
        "A: Well we were together. We had the same problems and \u2014",
        "A: Yes I was the youngest, 13 because all the women were from 18 to 35.",
        "A: Now at the -- oh yes, so then because I could speak German they made me a Iueforen [ph],\nwhich means a messenger girl. Can you come closer? A messenger girl and they would send me\noh and they gave me luckily, they gave me a jacket, a gray and blue striped jacket to wear and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 24\nwhen it was bitter cold we had to stand outside for hours in wet and cold and I would have that\non and it helped me. And so they would send me to the other barracks, to the women in charge\nor they would send me to the SS women who were guarding us. Or last of all they would send\nme to the gate, to the entrance, yeah to the gate to the SS soldiers with messages. I was always\nafraid to go there because I never knew what to expect, what\u2019s going to happen.\nAnd but, there was one woman I wish I could find her. There was one older SS woman. Her\nname was Bruner and she was tough. But she, they all loved me because I was a child and I was\na miracle child to be there with the women. So the people, these block guards or whatever in the\nbarrack, the women that were in charge, they were not allowed to light the fire in the little stove.\nBut and they used to put me outside the front of the barrack to watch if anybody was coming and\nif they did I had to run back and tell them and then they would put the fire out. So this time\nBruner came. And I was watching. And I had no time to run back. She wanted to go back with\nme. So she went way back and she saw the fire in the little tiny stove. She said who did that. I\nsaid I don\u2019t know. The window was open and she said who was jumping out the window. I said I\ndon\u2019t know. And she said was it someone who had hair or was, or did not. And I would not tell\nbecause those women had their hair. They didn\u2019t cut their hair and so she said was it a woman\nwith or without the hair. I said just bare, no hair. And she knew that anybody who lit the fire\nwho was in the back there it was the women who were in charge. And she loved the fact that I\nwas so wonderful that I did not tell the truth because that woman would have had trouble. So I\nsaid it was no hair and she was sort of smiling and walked out.\nAnd then this I have to tell you in a, before the rest of the story comes. But she loved me. And\nbecause I was such a, an innocent little child. And after at the end when they were dissolving\nAuschwitz, they sent all these women to factories and she came in and said williste kleine mit\nde blauer algen [ph], where is the little one with the blue eyes. And they said she went on a\ntransport. Ah, that was, she was happy because she wanted to take me out of there. Out of\nAuschwitz. So there were wonderful people too who could do as little or as much as possible to\nhelp you.",
        "A: No.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 25",
        "A: No. And when we, when they came from factories to pick people to go on the transport to\nwork at the factory, others into cities, one there was a beautiful tall beautiful German SS, young\nSS woman who actually tried or wanted to get out of there with a Polish man. They were going\nto sneak away from there. But that was impossible. But she was very sweet and sweet to me\nalways. And she said I'll tell you something. Don\u2019t go just with any transport. I will tell you\nwhat is the best and that\u2019s the one that you should go with. So but first the transports came and\nthey were looking at the dainty fingers and somehow blue eyes are good eyes, blue eyes. And\nthey picked me to go to that factory. And they also picked Blanca to go to that factory. It was\nsuch a thrill that we still were together. So she got me to change wherever I was, she got me out\nto go with that transport. So next day they took us. We marched and marched to Weisswasser. It\nwas another city away. We had to march there. It was an ammunition factory.",
        "A: Oh who knew months? And so we were marching unbelievable hours, days. We didn\u2019t\nknow. And we didn\u2019t get any food on the march there. And we got to this little town and lo and\nbehold they had a house where they put us in there and they had bunk beds and they had some\nkind of water or shower or something. Once every in a blue moon you know they let us take a\nshower. But we had, you could wash your hands. There was water. You could wash your hands.\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Agnes Hoffman. This 1s track number two and you were talking about now being\nin this house with a little bit of water.\nAgnes Hoffman: Yes, yes, yes. It was amazing. There was a bathroom. You could go to the\nbathroom and not outside. In the latrine. Because while we were in Auschwitz, they woke us up\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 26\nat three in the morning to go to the latrine. And then back to sleep on the floor. So it was\nwonderful. Clean and we would sit on the bunk beds in the evening and we would talk about\nwhat we would eat when we got free. And we would only be able to think 1n association what we\nhad. Bread, coffee, and soup. That\u2019s what, we never could remember any other food except to\ncompare with what we had to eat. We got up very, very early in the morning. The stars were still\nshining. And we would march through the city, through the town, whatever, to the factory. And",
        "A: Yes, the whole time. And it was amazing, the people. First of all the women, the SS women\nwere local women who really did not know how to be bad. They, but after a while they taught\nthem and a few of them were tough on us. But there was a family who had a little girl and as we\nwere marching, the little girl ran out and gave me. She was looking. They knew I was a young\nchild. She ran out and gave me some food and then ran back home, out. If they would have\ncaught them they would have been punished. But they did not care. And they did that. It was\nfantastic. And she would come every so often and bring me something.\nIn the factory, where I was working, you had to have very delicate hands with, you had to\nstraighten out tiny little wires which was part of an airplane part. And they were sort of twisted\nand you had to straighten them out. And that\u2019s what I was doing. Other, some people were\nblowing bulbs and heat with hot, with heat and they had tough work. But most of us were just\ndoing parts of this for the airplane parts.\nBut they were standing behind us, the German and they made us work faster and faster. And we\nwere -- and then we worked til late at night. And then they, we went back and they took us back\nhome. Home. And the next day, we were there the longest time in Weisswasser. But it was\nbetter than Auschwitz.\nWhen we started, we heard that there were airplanes coming and bomb these German factories\nand things. And they had us go outside and lie on the ground, on, and just be there while the\nbombs were coming. And we said thank God, maybe the bombs will hit them and we can get out\nof here. We were praying for that. But nothing happened. Then after some few months, we\nnever knew what day it was or date or anything, then they moved us to another factory,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 27\nHorneborg and if I tell you how one or the other was, I wouldn\u2019t know which one was which.\nSo we were, I can say that one of the factories that we went to had, it was in a salt mine. Inside,\nthat\u2019s where the factory was. And that\u2019s where we had to go. And it was hard to walk on the salt\nand all and that was a horrible place for us. So Auschwitz, Weisswasser, Port \u2014 oh Portar,\nPortwesfall was one before Hone, then Horneborg, port, no Horneborg, Portal, Bendorf [ph]\nwas the worst. And when we got there, people, everybody was full, who were there, they were\nfull of, a man is looking in here. What is he saying? Please, named us. You tell me. Ok.\nBendorf was the worst place. It was filthy. The people were full of lice. And it was just horrible.\nYou couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom. You could not have -- wash your hands or anything. It was\njust a horrible, filthy, dirty place. And we were there for a while. And from the, Port of\nBendorf, then they sent us to Hamburg. And then they had a bestial SS who beat us a lot.\nAnd it was a scary horrible place where we just didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to us. He\nbeat us. He just abused, abusive person, yeah SS.",
        "A: It happened to all of us the same way.",
        "A: Oh we were talking. We were all talking to each other about all this. What\u2019s going to be,\nwhat\u2019s going to happen. And it, yeah we talked but there \u2014",
        "A: We were, we were all like close family so there were some girls and I think when they came\nto Sweden, one beautiful one. She got married there. But I feel and Blanca had a cousin and she\ncame to America. And so we knew but otherwise, there we all stuck together.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 28",
        "A: Thousand women in one barrack.",
        "A: Oh it was, I don\u2019t know how many fit in each \u2014",
        "A: Yes oh he was vicious. He was very, very vicious, very bad. But we were there for a little\nwhile.",
        "A: No, no, no. But that was the last place. But when we were in the better places, like\nWeisswasser, we would dream about being home and we would sing and being, Blanca and the\nolder girls, they were, when we marched. We had to march 100 kilometers one time and we\nwould sing so the others don\u2019t cry.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 29",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know but we sang the whole time as we walked, we marched. We stuck together.\nAnd the unfortunate thing was well they had no use for children and babies. They took them all\naway. But one woman was pregnant. And she was due and Blanca took her into the barrack and\nshe delivered a baby. And then she took the baby to the German nurse and asked her to take\nsome care of. What they did was though, they destroyed the baby, most likely but she could not\ndo anything. But she wasn\u2019t allowed to have a pregnant woman. She wasn\u2019t allowed anything.\nBut we, sisters, that they had, the horrible brutal behavior of the SS by that time, it was all new\nSS, not the ones that were in Weisswasser. They had women, soldiers who were used to being\nbad. So it was very, very devastating.",
        "A: The last place was Hamburg and I don\u2019t know if it was a factory or that was just a, I don\u2019t\nknow which is which. I know that we were working in ammunitions factory in the beginning. I\nthink. I don\u2019t want to quote Weisswasser was the big one that where we were there the longest.\nBut we were working in other factories but I don\u2019t want to say it because if people will know\nthere, they may say they didn\u2019t have one there. But I know that there were places that were out of\nsight. Like the salt mine. In there they were hiding those factories there. So they, we went\nthrough the hardest, the toughest and it was a miracle that I survived. I kept saying I wish we\nwere all, did we wished that God would take us away so we wouldn\u2019t have to suffer any more.\nI was a skeleton by then. And at the end of the war, Hamburg was the last place. I had sores. I\nhad --",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Oh [had lice from Bendorf. And it was -- you were not a human being anymore. Skeleton. I\nwas a Skeleton. I \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 30",
        "A: Yes, yes. So-",
        "A: Hamburg.",
        "A: Yes. Ok. So one day we had a girl who they let us get out of the wagon to be outside the\nwagons. And one day she comes in and says I have news. Today they are going to cut the bread,\nthe loaf of bread, cut the bread in six, in four. And we are going to get some other margarine and\nthings but they will cut it in four which means you get a bigger piece, and not cut in six. And\nthen when it came, he said no, it was still cut in six. That they lied to her. And we still had the\nsame thing. And we always said oh, that girl, she always comes with these news and they are\nnever true. So we did not know that the war was over until she, yeah then she came in and says\nthe war is over and Hitler is dead. And we said ah, she comes with these stories. We did not\nbelieve her.\nThen they let us get off the, out of the wagons. And there was an engine, a train on the other\ntrack. And the engineer gave me a cup of hot water and I wrote in my story I couldn\u2019t believe it.\nI could wash my dirty hands and face. And then he gave me and Maggi cube and from the rest of\nthe water I put that in the hot water so I could have like a chicken soup.",
        "A: A bullion and I said at home the chicken soup didn\u2019t taste as good as this. But again he also\nsaid the war is over and the head had fallen. Hitler 1s dead. And you are going to Denmark. We\ncould not believe that we were free. So they loaded us in real trains and they took us, we really\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 31\ntook them to Denmark. And you asked the questions you want to ask. Then I'll tell you about\nthe \u2014",
        "A: Oh well, oh I see. Except the fact that we, from early morning til 10:00 at night we got back\nto the, to our quarters. And just \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, and freezing. Freezing.",
        "A: Yes, yes. There was nowhere, and luckily the jacket saved my life too. Because you know\nhow these jackets are. They are not, they were heavier.",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: No, actually I started in the ghetto. For the first time, I didn\u2019t even know what it was. But\nthey gave us the water they gave us had this medicine in there that stopped you from getting it.\nSo at that time I didn\u2019t have it yet.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 32",
        "A: After that I didn\u2019t get 1t anymore. And I don\u2019t remember then when I got it again. And \u2014",
        "A: OK they said we\u2019re going to Denmark and we said we can\u2019t, that\u2019s not true. We were talking\nto each other. Because \u2014",
        "A: Wait, wait, wait, wait. They said it\u2019s not true because Hitler would kill us, murder us before.\nHe would not let us be free again. He would kill us before, so it cannot be true that we are\nliberated. So but then I said but it was really true. They brought us to Denmark. And they put us\nin a school, empty school. They had fixed up bunk beds and white sheets and blankets and white\nnightgowns. We could not believe we got them.",
        "A: No. No. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember. It was close to the border. So it was the most heavenly\nfeeling. And then we sang and we talked about happy things and what we\u2019re going to do, when\nwe get home and then \u2014",
        "A: No, no because the women that were there before, they said that they had put them in shower\nand they were gone. And, and then when I spoke to a lady here who researched it for me, my\nfather. Because he was the only one that I knew nothing about and she reached, and then she sent\nme the information and she told me that the last place that they took him was Bergen-Belsen and\nno more news after that. And that\u2019s where they were killing them. So \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 33",
        "A: We\u2019re in Denmark and when we got, the train stopped. The people, the Danish people were\nrushing to us and brought us all kinds of things, cookies, chocolates, food, drink, everything.\nAnd little children and I wrote in my story that that was the most, the saddest thing because we\nremembered that our family were killed. They were gone. And we\u2019ll never see older people, Our\nolders and our children. We remembered that they are all gone. And what are we going to do\nnow without the family. And you want me to \u2014",
        "A: So we stayed overnight and they brought us food and couldn\u2019t believe the wonderful things\nlike oatmeal or things. They had to feed us light food for the first, in the beginning and we could\nhave all we want. And it was terrific. The next day they put us on a ferry boat and took us across\nto Sweden, because Sweden went to Germany and asked them for, at the end of the war, and\nasked them to give, they should give them 5000 survivors. They wanted to take the Red Cross,\nwanted to take them to Sweden. And they did. That\u2019s why we went to Denmark and Sweden.\nSo then we arrived in Sweden. Next day. And they took us to another big school. And again\nthey had fixed up all the bunk beds and all the \u2014 they had us, they fed us wonderful foods again,\nall we wanted. And it was unreal. We \u2014 it was hard to really grasp that after one whole year we\nwere free. And, but then they took all the people who were sick and to the hospital and that was\none of them was me. And I also had an infection on my finger that was very, very, very bad.\nAnd they did surgery on it. You know, they took care of it and they fixed it. And then they x\nrayed and all the things. I was coughing. They found that I had a spot on my lung.\nI don\u2019t know here in America what you would call it but it was on one spot that was like it was a\nsign of lung trouble. And oh and in that wagon. You know when they put us in the wagon and\npushed the wagon into the woods, when they opened it, I don\u2019t know if I mentioned, 54 people\nwere dead in my wagon and I was one of the six that was still breathing.\nSo when I came to Sweden, they had to put me together. They had to nurse me back to life. And\nI was in the hospital for a while. And after that they fed me and got me healthy and didn\u2019t let me\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 34\nout until I was ok. And there we were very close again with all our friends because we were in\nthe same wagon. And they had a lot of visitors coming. First of all they had people from every\npaper in the world, overseas and Sweden and everywhere. My uncle in Australia saw this story\nand saw that I was alive. It was amazing. And so it took quite a while before they let me out of\nthe hospital. I have some pictures, very little but Pll show it to you afterwards. And they put us\nin \u2014 they had us in the school yard and people were coming. We were locked, closed off from the\npublic because we were sick, but when we were at the fence and the Swedish people came on the\nother side of the fence and they kept throwing things over to us. And because I was a small child,\nthey threw a small suitcase, this little one. That was the most precious thing in my life. That was\nthe only belonging that I had.\nAnd there was a young man, Leonard, fantastic. He was a gymnast and terrific. I don\u2019t know. He\nwas 20 maybe or 20, whatever. And he would come every day to the -- and one day he took his\nsister with Ann Marie and then she would come every day with him. And they said when you get\nout, will you please come and live with us. I said I\u2019ll tell you when we get out of here, they are\ngoing to take us to a school. But after I get out of the school, I will come to you. I would love\nto.\nAnd when I came back ten years ago to Sweden, the newspapers came out because they came out\nthe first time when I was there. They came out and they asked Leonard, how come that you got\nfriendly with her, a child. He said that\u2019s because she was so sweet. She looked so sweet that I\nhad to, a sweet, a child that I had to take care of her. You know have and Ann Marie, his sister,\nhe wanted her to come and live with us. And their mother had died, long time before, but their\nfather, Fabro Gustav, Uncle Gustav was the sweetest man in the whole wide world and he loved\nme like he loves his own children. And he pampered me. He was so \u2014 I lived with them for quite\na while.",
        "A: At least one year, at least. I don\u2019t remember, but I know at least a year.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 35",
        "A: Ok, wait, wait. I'll tell you. First after we got out of that school",
        "A: And the, yes.",
        "A: And they took us first to Visings6 which was an island in Sweden, beautiful island. And there\nthey had us in a school. They were teaching us. They had profess \u2014 they came from everywhere.\nThey taught us everything and they were both Hungarians and Polish and young and boys and\ngirls and women. But the women, they had little cute little houses. It was like a resort. And we\nwere very happy there. And from there on, later on they sent us to a school up north. Was\nanother school. And we were there for quite a while. And last of all, they brought us back to\nStockholm and by then we were well and \u2014",
        "A: Yes oh yes. Red Cross or the UN or whoever, all the people that were giving us their lives.\nYou know help. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes, but outside of Stockholm was a town called Helsingborg and that\u2019s where they brought\nus. It was a boarding school. And then they had people coming from everywhere. There were\nactors, there were \u2014 I mean every kind of company or organizations that would come and\nwanted, and wrote articles and treated us to certain things. So when we got out of there, one day I\nhave to tell you a story. One day that is after, in Sweden after camp, that was the last school.\nAnd one day I said to a girlfriend of mine, let\u2019s go visit another school on the other side of\nStockholm\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 36",
        "A: Yes, yes. Yes. Well they told us how to take the train and take the bus to the other school. By\nthat time we knew what was around. So we got on the bus and we went to the school but I had \u2014\noh I had my little suitcase with me. And when we were in Stockholm, in the street we saw a lady\nmunching on an ice cream cone. And we had a little bit of money, not much. And we were\nexcited. We wanted one. So we went up to the guy, the cart and we said two please. And he\nopened the top and gave us and opened up the buns, hot dog. And that\u2019s and when we saw it we\nwere shocked. We never had seen that. We wanted ice cream. So we gave him the money and\ngot the hot dog. So we were ashamed of having it because in Hungary when you went to the\nmarket people were selling sausage, hot dogs. And that was not nice thing to do. You know. I\nknow in Budapest and 1n big cities they would sell those things but we didn\u2019t know. Its children.\nAnd so what we did was I put the hot dogs inside the suitcase and I was going to throw it away\nwhen we got to a place.\nSo we went to the school and then we came, when the end of the day, we came back. We were\nstanding at the bus stop waiting. And the bus came, had to rush to get on it. And I forgot the\nsuitcase on, in the street outside the bus. So then oh my god, once I was on the bus, took off, I\nsaid I left my suitcase and so I asked the driver and he said you can call lost and found. And I\ndidn\u2019t even know what it was or the name. I called next day. I called lost and found and they said\ncan you describe it. I said yes, a small suitcase. And he said what was inside of it. And I said a\ncold dog. Oh no he didn\u2019t ask then. So we went to pick it up next day and that\u2019s when he asked\nwhat was inside. And when I \u2014 I was so embarrassed, opened it up and there was the hot dog.\nAnd he laughed so hard and gave me the little suitcase.\nAnd I had a fantastic life for a year with Ann Marie and Leonard. They were brother and sister\nto me. And then the newspapers came out to Ann Marie\u2019s, to their house. And they wrote the\narticle. Oh but I forgot to say is that when we got back, the first thing they did to us before we\neven stepped into any clean place, they disinfected us. Cleaned us. No lice, no, no nothing so we\nwere clean already. And but Ann Marie was working for a company but she was only a few\nmaybe, six, seven years older. Maybe she was 23 or 25 but she was like a mother to me. And\nLeonard was like a brother who spoiled me and he was a gymnast and when he went on a trip\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 37\noverseas with the gym, national gymnasts. He came back and he brought me a little ring from\nsome other Middle Eastern country. I haven\u2019t got it. Somebody got it from me.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Not then, no.",
        "A: So I, from Hungary. No I didn\u2019t go back to Hungary til ten, ten years.",
        "A: No, no. I wanted to come to America. But first in Sweden, I was in Sweden for five years and\nthey sent me to boarding school and they, then when I got out and I lived with Ann Marie, then I\ngot a job at, with five of \u2014 by then I could, I taught myself Swedish. I looked the words up in the\ndictionaries and I was one of the few who could speak Swedish after such a short time. So I let\u2019s\nsee.",
        "A: Yes, but before that, in Sweden, I got a job with five of the top women\u2019s magazine to translate\nstories because I could speak languages from other countries to, into Swedish and that was such\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 38\na thrill that here is a greenhorn who can work in, to do this for a magazine. It was unheard of,\nunbelievable. So but before that I had my first job there. I\u2019m telling you about the fun one.\nBefore they were making marzipan in big kettle and all I had to do is stir the big kettle with the\nmarzipan. But after that I got that good job and it was fantastic. And we had this is \u2014 we had\nlots, in Helsingborg in that boarding school, we had lots and lots, the last place, lots of visitors.\nAnd they were like I said actors. They were pianists, they were \u2014 to entertain us and things.\nThey had a Hungarian ballet dancer who had a place. You know she had a school to teach ballet.\nAnd she would come to the boarding school to check to see who would be good to bring to her\nschool.\nIt\u2019s so funny. And of course I\u2019m dancing with the movements and because my father used to\nteach me to dance. And I did Latin and tango and fox, everything, but here when the music was\non, I was gyrating with my Latin movements. She says no, that won\u2019t do. No ballerina. So that\nwas very funny. And then we, yes and then we had a pianist. A young man that was very good\nlooking. And all the girls were surrounded him, with him. And I did not. I was a child still but I\nwas still, I didn\u2019t. And so that was Yalmar, Yalmar. And that was the one time that I saw him.\nThen many, many years later, I mean towards the last year in Sweden, I was in, at a party and\nwhom do I see but Yalmar. Then he started to take me out. And he had asked me to marry him.\nAnd I wanted to go to America. I said no but I \u2014 here I was a young woman before I was \u2014 oh\nthank you, thank you.\nBefore I was a child and now I was a young woman that he asked me to marry him. He wanted\nme to stay in Sweden and I just turned him down and I said when I come to America, if I don\u2019t\nlike it Pll write to you of course. That did not happen but it was exciting to be considered a\nhuman being after that. So then Ann Marie said \u2014 oh we joined, they joined. They were in a\nsports club where the sports club had a base in, close to a wood. They had a building and the\nfamilies could come with children or the young people to come and for weekends. And they had\nall kinds of outdoor sports and all so Ann Marie said to me, the vacation is coming. And we, the\nother girl , Bisa from the building, other friend and her, we\u2019re going to the sports club\u2019s\nheadquarters, the ten. Are you going? I said no. Because I read a magazine that the Swedish\npeace organization will pay for any young people, anywhere in the world to come to outside of\nStockholm to a farmer that will give you a job for six weeks and give you and pay you for the\nwork. And you had to sleep and live in tents. I said that\u2019s where I\u2019m going because they want to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 39\nprove that young people, all kinds of people in the world can live together in peace. And I said\nthat\u2019s where I\u2019m going.\nSo when I went there they came out to visit us from the UN. And the Swedish organization.\nThey said we are going to Switzerland to a UN world conference for three weeks. Would you\nlike to go with us? We will cover all your expenses. And that was because I could speak all the\nlanguages and the Swedes at that time hardly knew English. They did. So I said yes, I would\nlove to go and then in the mean, I said I'd love to go. As I said we\u2019re going in six cars and with\nthe statesmen and their wives.\nBut then in the camp where I was in the tents, this young woman stopped by one night and said\nyou know I was hitchhiking here and a man, 65 year old man, had given me a ride. And he asked\nme if I would want to be a governess for his 11 year old child, son. And he lived in a mansion\nand he was a president of the biggest steel factory. And she said I would have loved to but I told\nhim that I\u2019m getting married so I can\u2019t. But Agnes, judging you, the way that you speak\nlanguages, you are acting perfect for a job like that and I recommend you to the man. So she\nwrote to him and he invited me to his mansion to see if I would like it.\nSo when I got there, the chauffeur met me and then they drove into the front of the mansion. It\nwas like a dream. And he, after a while, after he talked to me for a while. He said I\u2019d love for\nyou to come and take the job. I said I would love to but I can\u2019t because I am going to\nSwitzerland to a UN world conference for three weeks. And he said I will wait. You come back\nand after that you come here. So I did and I took the job of a dream. The mansion was absolutely\nbreath taking. He had all the servants, all the workers but he wanted someone who could always\nbe a family member so when he went. He traveled a lot for business and he wanted someone who\nwas close to the boy, not just the servants. So I said ok. Pll be back, yeah when I came and I\ntook the job. My friends were dukes, baronesses and barons, all and every weekend he had lots\nof guests. He had this was his second marriage for the 11 year old boy and a six year old girl\nwho was with her mother. But he had grown son who was running their plant in South America.\nHe had a daughter who was in New York in a theater. She was a designer, stage designer. They\nwere grown people. They were and so it was fantastic that he had chosen me to be able to meet\nall those famous people. They were all kinds of, and locally. And there was an engineer\u2019s hotel\nthere. That he was associated with too. And every time he got an invitation to any big affair\nthere, they sent me an invitation too.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJanuary 10, 2014 40",

And I had a cousin who met me. I had another uncle in New York and had two \u2014 a son\nand a daughter. These were grown people. Grown, not like me.
