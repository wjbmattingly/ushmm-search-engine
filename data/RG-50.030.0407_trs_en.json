        "Q: Good morning Professor Mommsen.",
        "A: Good morning.",
        "Q: Nice to see you here in Washington.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: Tell me when you were born, and what your name was at birth.",
        "A: Well, I was -- I was born on the fifth of November, 1930, and certainly I had the same\nname as I have, Hans Mommsen.",
        "Q: Same name. Tell me something about your -- your family, your mother and your father,\nand your -- you have a twin brother, I gather.",
        "A: S -- I had the twin brother, and my father was historian at Marburg, and -- because many\npeople ask that, Theodor Mommsen is the great-grandfather.",
        "Q: Right. And he won a -- a Nobel Prize, didn\u2019t he --",
        "A: Yes, he did, yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- in 1903. So, at what age did you start being very conscious of this very prominent\nbackground in your family?",
        "A: Quite late, you know. There was no -- there was no -- no tendency to miternigize Theodor\nMommsen at home.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: You know, that was not necessary.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We rather were timid to -- to talk about Theodor, and especially not to use that relation, if\none had contact to the outside.",
        "Q: And was your mother a professional as well?",
        "A: No, my mother is a -- just a housewife, she is from Prame and -- and she comes from a\nbank-banking fam-family, and they broke down in the hyper-inflation in 1923, and thus\nin a way, had a negative impact on the relation between my parents.",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "A: Well, it -- there was no money left.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And my mother, you know, she was used to have s -- plenty of money all the time, and\nnow -- and suddenly there was none, because the salary of a German [indecipherable]\nprofessor was not too high, if he now had four kids, and that was our case. And certainly\nhe | -- lost many of his income after the Nazis took over.",
        "Q: So that meant that your par -- th -- your relationship between your parents was not --",
        "A: Right, 1t could have been a bit better.",
        "Q: -- was not so easy -- better. Did that affect you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think so.",
        "Q: Mm. You said four kids?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, twin brother, older brother, and?",
        "A: Had two older brothers, we were four brothers, yes.",
        "Q: I see. And what\u2019s the difference in age between --",
        "A: Well, the oldest one is born in 1923, next in \u201927, and we are 1930.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So --",
        "A: And the oldest are [indecipherable]. They had a lot of war experience in the second\nWorld War.",
        "Q: When do you first become conscious of the -- the Nazis, what -- I mean, what kind of a\ndec -- do you remember as a kid seeing things 1n the streets? Hearing things on the radio?",
        "A: Well, it -- Well, it\u2019s difficult to say, you know, because to recognize the Nazis as\nsomething which 1s really distinct from the general conditions, you wouldn\u2019t, I think, be\naware. Before the war -- although, you know, my first interesting, and -- experience in\nthe contemporary history, was arige Crystal Night. And it was a quite strange story,\nbecause my father wanted to see what was going on. The synagogue which was burning,\nwas directly besides of the lecture building of the university, and my father was teaching\nat the university, and by that he had a pretext to go there. Because it was not accessible\nfor the public, it was only SA men who were there. In order to get into that, and oh -- he\ntook the twins, and by that, it looked that way, he [indecipherable] but we all the time,\nasked him, \u201cFather, why doesn\u2019t the firefighters come?\u201d And he said, \u201cPsst, psst, psst.\u201d\nAnd I remember the scenery, and certainly the thing which is interesting then, for the\nhistorian, 1s that there was no public people, there was only the SA. It was certainly not as\nGoebbels had tried to let it appear, as a riot of the German people, it was just only the --\nthe Nazi activists, and the others didn\u2019t have any access to the place.",
        "Q: And how did you -- And how did -- Do you ha-have any idea how your dad got access, or\nwere you far away?",
        "A: No, we go -- we went to the -- the adjacent building, we knew that way well, you know --",
        "Q: Were you frightened?",
        "A: Because he got exception. No, that was nearby, nearb --",
        "Q: Were you scared by this?",
        "A: Not -- Not random, oh, I don\u2019t know, maybe. You know, but I remember it only --\nrecollect it only because of the fact that the father has such strange answers.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That was it.",
        "Q: When you went back home, I mean when he -- when you asked him there, you know,\nwhy isn\u2019t there a fire truck stopping this, and he tells you to be quiet, was there any talk\nwhen you went back home? None?",
        "A: No, wouldn\u2019t talk about that.",
        "Q: No, huh?",
        "A: Yep. We got the feeling that he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. He wouldn\u2019t talk about any\npolitics at home. Certainly he had some contact to some representatives to the resistance\nmovement, with one of the advisors of William Loishner, the [indecipherable] board visit\nhim regularly. And we got aware only of the fact that he left the house, he didn\u2019t receive\nth -- him in the house, and -- and everything was very secret, and -- and by that th-the\nkids got afraid there was something happening, and in [indecipherable] that was his\nconduct. And once, you know, I just picked up a sentence that was quite symptomatic, in\nGerman, that ronteheron in Berlin with an auchnie pas etou and so on. That means the\npeople in the ministry down there wouldn\u2019t do either, you know. And certainly that\nreflected the situation as the German resistance, that they couldn\u2019t, in a way, use the\ngovernmental institutions to raise a resistance, because everything was Nazified, or -- or\nthe administration was without any influence because the Nazi party had a -- a -- a\nbypass, or surpass them. That was the situation, but this is also a later [indecipherable]\nand a potential.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the other thing I remember were the -- two things I remember o-of the Nazi period.\nOne is that it has a vidi -- visit of the famous historian, Freidich Meineker, who was\nknown for his distance precision versus the Nazi regime. But he visited us in the summer\nof 1941. Then the German troops had conquered the Aprole, that was highest mountain in\nthe Carpathors. And after Meineker had left, Sunday the father said, \u201cEe, Meineker\u2019s\nproud of that.\u201d We couldn\u2019t get to that, you know. But cernly all the money was owned in\nsome respects, nationalist that -- although he criticized the regime, on the other hand, he\nwas proud of the merit of the German troops, while my father, as an also World War One\nofficer, all the time was deeply skeptical of what was going on in the Soviet Union,\nbecause he could not believe that this would end other than in a defeat.",
        "Q: Your dad was not a member of the party?",
        "A: He was a member of the party, he was --",
        "Q: He was?",
        "A: -- in 1940, he got a -- the -- the pressure of the district leader Karvitski that he should end\nthe party, and then he was taken into the party, but pre-dated to 1937, but he, in a way, he\ncame very late to the party. But you know, the party membership, as such, hasn\u2019t much\nmeaning about what the people really thought of. And we have a lot of nominal members\nin that time. He had some problem, because he was a liberal historian, in the one paid he\nwas a democrat, and in the -- 1943, he suddenly got some pressure that he would have to\nleave that university and -- and it was very difficult round then, there were somehow\npeople in the education ministry in Berlin, who helped him, by that he could preserve his\nchair. But he lost the periodical he was editing and he -- his -- it was a ri -- way\npolitically minored, and he would have liktus every day of that, everything was gone, and\nby that, he was in a bit di-difficult position, but he tried to adapt himself to a certain\nextent. Certainly that is what raise him to manifold that group who was not really\nconservative. And er -- which on the other hand, you know, lost the confidence in the\nrestoration, or the continuation of the parliamentary democ -- democratic system. There\nwas some disorientation. Certainly, he was strongly directed against the prevailing\ntendency of the so called Reich mythology, and he still was very strong in pressing for\nthe importance of the Bismark 1n tradition, so that that was a little bit directed against the\ngreat German tendencies. And so far he had a peculiar position, but he was -- he was not\nreally a member of the opposition. He was in the midst between the camps, I think. And\nin a way he also had to fear that he got political pressure again, as it happened then, in\n1944, I\u2019ll never forget then the famous Gunter Franzel was the historian for the peasants\nwho were in the Third Reich, came from Strassburg. Strassburg had been lost, and now\nwe were sitting at Marburg. So they had, years ago, a while been SS, and now my\nfather\u2019s and -- said that he was just as helm, and I -- I never forget that the father was\nway, way for -- fearful that they wanted to get his chair. It looked like they had, you\nknow. And then I met the same Franzel five months later, after the break down of the\nregime, you know, in another uniform, and a -- the way, free, different type, you know\nthere you see the change. I never forgot that, you know. And so far, I think the position of\nmy father\u2019s was a bit precarious, but he was now a hero.",
        "Q: And your -- your two older brothers, were they brought into the army in \u201939, or later?",
        "A: Well, my o-oldest brother, certainly he was brought into the army with 18, and then he\nserved all the time, first in -- in the eastern front, and then in Africa, but he -- fortunately\nhe didn\u2019t get to northern Africa because there end of the main -- because then -- there was\neverything finished. And then he went back to the Soviet Union, and he survived in a way\nbecause he -- in April 1947, fled, and swam through the er -- Oude river in order to get\ninto the hands of the Americans. That was that story. So the -- he had the pressure o --\nyou know, of being all the time a soldier at the front, and he was also ma -- sa -- two\ntimes wounded, and so on. That way, typical war -- war age cahount.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the younger one, he went in -- first was what you call in German fleckhaffer, that\nmeans he had to -- to serve as a suen in the entire air company, and then later on, he also\ngot soldier, and -- but he was younger, and in a way -- he didn\u2019t get to the Soviet Union,\nbut to France. And you know, that\u2019s a really strange story, because when he went back to\nSchlevig Kolchda, that\u2019s in the north of Germany, that was a region where still the great\nAdmiral Doernitz had his _ . And there they dwell for two or three weeks, they preserved\nas independent military units, and what is fairly not known, that they had that, what one\ncalls in German, Ate tu exetsianser. Exercise the great thing, Heil Doenitz. You know\nthat Doenitz wanted to continue, instead of having the Heil Hitler, they now should use a\nHeil Doenitz, and that was -- is almost unbelievable. And then he came home with\neverything one wanted to have, because I know there was a lot of foot stuff. And\n[indecipherable] over there at that time, while the other came in American -- ga --\ncustody.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Tell me about school during this period, when you started going to school. I\nknow you have no comparison, because you go to school, and it\u2019s in -- within the context\nof the National Socialism, but what was it like?",
        "A: But it\u2019s strange, you know, the school was called Adolf Hitler school.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Got the name after 1933. About the time I take -- round that gymnasium -- in Germany\nwe'd say gymnasium, that was the second day of school, you know. It was one of the --\nnot of the old k -- gymnasium, which have Latin and Greek in the center of the lessons,\nbut they had modern languages, that was something, and mod -- more modern type of the\nGerman secondary school. And the -- the man who was running that, the director, he was\ndefinitely non -- a non-Nazi, that\u2019s quite clear. And he tried to avoid too much in\nindoctrination in that time. And I have the personal experience, I always warn people to\noverestimate the decree of ideological indoctrination a -- during the Nazi period. You\nknow, that was very strong in the years after 1935, but later on, it was really German,\nNationalists certainly, 1t was -- it was not liberal, it was not democratic. But I can\u2019t\nremember that there was any talk about -- about race, and racial ideology or so -- th-that\nwould play a big role, and I remember it in the later war years, we had then a specific\nNazi teacher, who came with a brown uniform, and so we had a [indecipherable] start,\nyou know. It was not a -- the experience which then occurred after, in 1944. It\u2019s because\nthey had the same men, and also after [indecipherable] and they had a way bad life, you\ncan -- and that was, you know, not a serious type, he was way d -- he was, I think, really\ndifferent from the other professors, you know? And it -- so far, I can\u2019t remember that\nthere was a specific Nazi indoctrination in the school. Certainly some, you know, and\nwell, you would have the -- the typical school pil -- festivals or something, but I can\u2019t\nremember that we were sitting together to listen to the Hitler speech or something. Maybe\nthat happened, but it was not very significant, I think. And as a historian, I add on the\ncommentary, that after 1935, Goebbels in the way, certainly the propaganda on the one\nhand was very rapidly and tr -- especially in the Jewish case, but there was also some\ndeportization of the whole system be -- if the citizens remained loyal, everything was not\n-- and -- and so far, I think the school was not too much Nazified. And there was not too\nmuch change after -- in the teacher staff, after 1945, and certainly in 1944, we got a little\nbit more aware of the politic conditions and so on, but there was not much talk, and every\nf -- thing -- you had to be very busy all the time, and certainly we are -- spent every\nSunday to have collecting this or that in the service, or the Deutsch yungfolk, the youth\norganization of the hi -- of the Hitler youth, or later on even in the Hitler youth. I th -- I\nthink, well usually when people think the whole time is a time of interconnection, it\u2019s not\nso much. At least I didn\u2019t understand anything about the Jewish question before the war\nwas over, then I learned a little bit about it before the -- I was very naive in that way, you\nknow. So they -- we -- the difference was that the father wouldn\u2019t talk about politics at\nall, you know?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And that\u2019s what I have to say to the school.",
        "Q: You know, in the -- in the museum we have, on the fourth floor, this thing about the\nschool, and we show something about \u201cThe Poisonous Mushroom.\u201d Do you ever\nremember reading that book, or books like it?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. So this was not so typical.",
        "A: Se-Serious school teachers wouldn\u2019t use that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But that\u2019s a problem you know where 1-it\u2019s a -- now, and there\u2019s a lot of tendency in the\nresearch to start it at -- but when should we weigh causes, you know. These things were\nvery tedious. I can only tell my experience with it --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- with the Deutsch yungfolk, you know, so the --",
        "Q: Yes, please do.",
        "A: We had to go into the Deutsch yungfolk when we were 10, and I was in the Deutsch\nyungfolk from the age of 10 to the age of 14. And so that we were living in specifics\nquarter at Marburg, and there was something like the academic elite there, but that our --\nour [indecipherable] some unit of the yungfolk, you know, had a lot of intellectuals, and\nyou know, it\u2019s quite good. We had a library and I wa -- the -- Wolfgang, my twin brother\nand I, had to run the library, the fanela library, and had a lot of books, but you know,\nwhat did it guys lend out. So they lend out calimai, and technical literature. There\u2019s no\nuniversum literature dealing with a technical future, and something like that. They\nwouldn\u2019t read anything which is related to Nazi ideology, that was quite symptomatic.\nAnd you know, if you have to run a -- a youth group, you know, and you have to take one\nevening in the week, you know, which should -- what the Germans call that heimarm,\nthat means, I have some program, you know. The pr -- The Nazi ideology is very poor,\nand after awhile it\u2019s very difficult to do something, and by that, you know, it was a little\nbit, you know, they had very different topics, but in Farenow, the specific ideological\nissues were not debated very much. So the e -- went -- there was criticism against it, but it\nwasn\u2019t -- it -- it was not so much in the minds, I think, of the people as -- from the -- from\nhindsight, one per -- would believe, if he looks at the specific literature. And I want to\nadd one experience that then, in 1944, late in 1944, we were assembled and to be taken\nover to the Hitler youth, that is the organization of the 14 to 18 old boys, and they had to\nswear the oath on Adolf Hitler. It -- The whole thing happened within the inner circle of\nthe marble castle. And there were about 1200 boys, and we\u2019re way much packed. But the\nwhole thing was a little bits disturbed, because there were two lightnings, and there was -\n- we -- we -- we would have preferred to go, you know, in it so far. In 1944 there was no\nmuch chance to indoctrinate people any longer. And -- But that\u2019s on -- all of my\nexperience I had.",
        "Q: And in your sense, at least in the world in which you traveled, was that while people were\nnot necessarily going to resist the Nazis, and the regime. They were not necessarily\nbelieving.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s ish -- they were -- just to -- in the middle of that, you know. And do you\nknow what was the problem with only if you wanted to -- to decide for assistance and --\nthere was some identity between the nation and the personality of Hitler, it was quite\ndifficult for -- for I think ordinary people, you know, where you can say -- members of\nthe elite, that\u2019s different, or Conservatives, or even Communists, that\u2019s different. But the\nordinary people, what should they do, just you know, the -- the -- the -- the gentleman,\ntentative was, they criticize all the time the regime, and Goebbels and Himmler, and\neverybody, but would exempt Hitler from that. So they had a split consciousness, and you\nhave that famous sentence, \u201cVen dusta fuhrer wusta,\u201d \u201cIf Hitler would know that, then it\nwouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d you know. And certainly that was a psychological mechanism,\nbecause you can\u2019t easily revolt against your own nation. And so far, Hitler was taken\nfrom out of that criticism, while certainly all the soldiers would say, after the war, then\nwe will change the regime. And that was the other side of the other interrogations of\nGerman prisoners of war by the Americans. You know, we have a lot of material for that.\nYou see, I am not a very good eye witness, you know. A historian usually --",
        "Q: Is not, right?",
        "A: -- reflects his own experience too much. No.",
        "Q: Yeah, was it hard during the war? Did you ha --",
        "A: Well, we had a good life because we are living a little town at Marburg. There was some\nair attacks, but not many. I never forget that I also was caring, and to help people, and if\nsomebody wouldn\u2019t have taken me and -- and -- and thrown me back, then I would have\nnot survived, and so on. And -- But in general, I think the conditions at Marburg were not\ntoo -- too bad, while certainly in the big cities, where you have the wide air raids, it must\nhave been very problematic, you know. And especially in the last ter -- months of the\nwar. I never forget when the Americans attacked the city of Giessen, that\u2019s just 30\nkilometers away. That was in the night at three. And we were -- had a house with a good\nlooking -- you could looks out a little bit on the -- on the hill. We could read on the\nbalcony.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Then Giessen was burning, we could read on the balcony, 30 kilometers away.",
        "Q: Oh [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, that was the last face of the al-allied bombing of encef. That certainly was difficult.\nAnd it depended certainly also where the political pressure 1s concerned, how -- how --\nhow the local functionaries would behave, surely different.",
        "Q: -- wouldn\u2019t talk about these things. Would your mother talk about these things with you?",
        "A: No, she was apolitical, no, she would not.",
        "Q: She was apolitical.",
        "A: I know there was, I think some agreement not to talk about anything.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, the only thing I remember, that sometimes I didn\u2019t understand, my father ordered to\nus, please don\u2019t be too kind, or don\u2019t make friendship with the sons of Professor\nFunshdeal. 30 years later I learn that a Professor Funshdeal, who was a colleague in the\nmedical faculty, was a -- participating in the concentration camp -- how is that called?\nMedical experiments. He must have known.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So your father would hint slightly at things?",
        "A: Yes, you know, in this situation, if you have something like an political double life, then\nyou probably wa -- should -- should -- wouldn\u2019t ta -- to tell anything to the kids, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Another question certainly was that he would tell so many nice stories, that he would\nlisten, and evening be recie. And you know there was his -- his working room, and that\nwould -- had to be dark, and nobody was allowed to go there. This was clear that\nsomething was happening. But he did not know that my older brother, before he came to\nthe -- to the entire air troop, together with his friend, had a telephone connection to that\nradio, and were sitting in a neighboring house, and listening to the BBC too, you know,\nwhich, as you can imagine, was very dangerous. But th-there was some feeling that there\nwas something, and you\u2019d been -- better wouldn\u2019t talk about it, you know?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And may -- you know, but certainly that depends on my recollection, you know, no\npromise.",
        "Q: Right, I know the promise. Why do you think historians make very bad witnesses?",
        "A: Historians make bad witness because they put everything only the -- in history in\nperspective, and what you need 1s -- and what a historian needs if he is working with\nhistorical witnesses, that they just recollect immediately, which I hadn -- you have to get\nthem bef -- and we have the re -- in the situation, to ask them the first time. And I am --\nso a little bit ca -- or we could -- you can say afterwards, you have to shoot them, because\nit\u2019s quite clear that they would change an opinion, and have a -- you know, th -- that\nexperience with the expiration of a ristock fire, where all the witnesses would change\ntheir opinion if they were in favor of a Communist, or of a National Socialist background,\ndoesn\u2019t matter. The witness who told in 1933 that and that, they would tell them the\nopposite in -- after 1945, and the -- the other way around. It\u2019s very interesting, and I -- I\nhad a way -- it was we -- when I had to study on the Volkswagen company in the Third\nReich, and I had a good contact to the former -- former man of the management, who was\nresponsible for the accunt -- commercial ex -- aspects. And I asked him, why are they put\nin Jewesses in the work to do to -- could use some pasokas because that was certainly not\nvery important, and especially -- certainly they -- it was now pr-profiteering motivation\n[indecipherable] you know. First he immediately sa -- spontaneously answered, \u201cBecause\nwe had to fill the capacity.\u201d A week later, or two, he called me and said he wanted talk\nabout me, and now he added [indecipherable] of second day liberations, why that was\nthere, but he never had reflected that the most interesting thing is when the -- th -- over\n50 years, never had reflected that the occupied Jewish concentration camp inmates in the\nc-company. You know that, I think, was the most interesting. And then he got the original\nmotive, that he didn\u2019t think that it just put in whom they got, in order to fill the capacity,\nnot to lose anything of the capacity for -- well, possibly a later peace production. It was\nSO primitive, that was it. This is one of the cases where I got him at a situation where he\ndidn\u2019t reflect it, and then he told the truth.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And otherwise, they don\u2019t tell --",
        "Q: The truth.",
        "A: -- things that they are.",
        "Q: What was it like soon after the war? Your brothers come back. Is there --",
        "A: Well, you know, it\u2019s quite interesting that when all is cu -- he talks about he -- the hour\nzero, you know, and that was a tobide whether it\u2019s a liberation, or whether it is a defeat.\nBut what is, I think forgotten, is that there was a constellation which lasted several\nmonths, with a total disorientation, because it didn\u2019t know whether there would be a\nGerman state again, or something, or what would be a political structure, there was --\nthere was no future. And also, what my personal situation was concerned, I didn\u2019t know\nwhether the -- whether we would continue the secondary school, then I didn\u2019t know\nwhether there would be a chance to go to the university. There was, in a way, everything\nbroke down, and I think that left an imprint on that generation, and those -- are those age\ncohorts, who -- who went through that situation of this extreme disorientation I think\nthey are different from the next ones, who haven\u2019t, I don\u2019t think, gone through that. I\nnever forget one situation, and I think, which has a -- being very, very important for my\npersonal development. But those -- April 27\", 1945, in the early morning, the Germans --\nthe German troops left the city in disarray, you know, it was ger -- my father went to\nthem, and said throw the rifles into the garden, ya -- bi -- please put it down the street and\nso on, and I went into the garden wa -- and so on, then they fled, and at last, the general\nwho was there, there was some -- some -- had division staff there, and he hosed, then fled\nt -- by foot, you know, that was the end of the -- of the borf wars. And then there was\nsomething, Germans had left, and Americans would come, but nobody would know\nwhen. And then my notables, and my peers were all plundering. They were some deport\nof the German army, and they\u2019re plundering, you know, and I, for my first and last time,\nlearned what is it, if there is never law and order, and no authority. And s -- you know, I\ndidn\u2019t have much respect when I went to school, noby -- here\u2019s all these people, you\nknow, I\u2019m very nervous, don\u2019t you notice. It was just nothing, well, they could rape there,\nbut they did what they could do, and -- and even the -- the directors of the schools, and\nthe professors, and everybody belonging to the elite, that was it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know? And this has -- had, I think, left an imprint on me, and cer-certainly may be\nsomewhat responsible for my lack of accepting authority, and being very nervous if I got\nthe authority [indecipherable] conditions.",
        "Q: And wha-what do you think made those people do that, the plundering, at the end?",
        "A: Well, you know, besides all -- as you know, far more important than any Nazi\nindoctrination was the terrible loss of -- of moral radius, something like a -- a -- people\ngot accustomed to moral indifference. And all these radius were gone undone, there were\nno longer norms, and by that, you have then this certain de-decay of a civilization.\nCertainly if you look at the Jewish question, you have that very clear, you know, it\u2019s the\nsame thing. And there is also, I think the [indecipherable] not only anti-Semitic\nindoctrination, but it\u2019s, you know, a mentality where people just do what is in their --\ntheir primary interest, and where we have something like an amoral vitality. And I always\ngrow the -- the famous atrons of -- of Hannibal James Homerker, the leader of the\nGerman resistance group, the so-called crisis [indecipherable] who said the foremost talk\nof the resistance is to restore to picture of man in the hearts of our fellow citizens, in\norder just to -- to come back to something like a civilized society, so the -- the extreme\ndecay of all radius, of all habits, and so on, and -- we-well we had something like more\nanarchy. This is very important.",
        "Q: Did that affect you?",
        "A: Yes, certainly.",
        "Q: So that you felt this lack in yourself?",
        "A: Yes, I -- if you have it, if you are a young guy, and you don\u2019t have any -- any morals, any\npersons you can adore, or to follow their ideas, you know the oldest -- the old Nazis were\ngone, and the other ones, who were -- who was left?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We were in that -- in that respect, I think psychologically alone.",
        "Q: Psychologically?",
        "A: Psychologically alone.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Without -- Without guidance. Who could at -- help us? Also, we had to li -- also, when\nwe learned what was happening, we had some distance to the -- to the parents, too, you\nknow. The whole peer generation was just without any -- we didn\u2019t have any respect\ntowards the peer generation. And that\u2019s the way it differ -- ca -- education ca -- has a --\nhas a certain [indecipherable] you know, it\u2019s way difficult. And to get there somebody\norientation, and that made for that -- made a -- a youth career very difficult. Next -- The\nnext generation certainly didn\u2019t have these problems any longer, because they looked,\nand they had economic progress, and some put -- a positive [indecipherable] and so on.\nBut in that situation of the ultimate decay of all moral radius, and also of national radius,\nand up, the Germans of that time, certainly was completely a national, and without any\nengagement, and a famous mentality as -- that\u2019s like signified by the word onimish. That\nmeans, without my participation, and no, they wouldn\u2019t engage themselves. They were\ntotally isolated people. And this situation, I think, is what youngsters, I think, are quite --\nquite exceptional, and quite important.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I think it had a negative impact, insofar as I -- I was -- it was difficult to adapt me to\nconditions, which I -- already existed, and made me in a way -- in a way a critic -- a-- a\ncritic of traditionalism, yes, maybe.",
        "Q: Was it equally difficult for your -- for your twin brother? There he was --",
        "A: Oh certainly, that\u2019s the same experience.",
        "Q: Yeah, the same. Do you have a recollection when you and your brother, and your other\nbrothers knew about the genocide, and about the killing of groups, o-other than Jews? I\nmean, that there was this mass death?",
        "A: Well, that became immediately known a --",
        "Q: After?",
        "A: -- b-by the American re-orientation, and re-education, immediately after the war. Then it\nbees -- became quite clear, you know? Before that, they didn\u2019t really know that.",
        "Q: So you must have been in -- 1n enormous shock from that.",
        "A: Well, you know, that was -- there was a lot of shocks all the time, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: It -- It has to be put into the context of --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- the loss of the total political ori-orientation. And as historian, I was -- I add, you know,\nthat at the time of the Nuremberg trials, the Holocaust in it\u2019s reality, wasn\u2019t really in the\nminds, you know. Even Americans didn\u2019t realize that this was the biggest crime by the\nregime, and still people like Odeelok Lobochnick could be witnesses at a -- at a trial,\ninstead of being persecuted by themselves. You know, it\u2019s very symptomatic. But you\nknow, step by step, that became quite clear, and certainly the -- but the -- the American\nfilms on the concentration camps, Bergen-Belsen and so on, were more known than the\nHolocaust, because the Holocaust was far away, you know, and the myth I think\npersevered, that -- that this was nothing that the German people was related to, and it took\nus, as historians many, many -- and you as many years to get that into the\n[indecipherable] where the Holocaust was not, if I went -- done by -- performed by\nHimmler and his chieftain. It was also a lot of people involved. But I don\u2019t know, maybe\nthe -- you\u2019re a bit more, but I re-recollect, you know, that -- you know there -- these\ntypical anti-sem -- anti-Semitic songs sung in the -- in the -- in the Hitler youth, I think\nwe didn\u2019t realize what we were singing. And sometimes it was corrected , then there is\none of the essentials today belongs as Germany, and -- and -- and tomorrow the whole\nworld, you know, it was corrected, and it will say that it\u2019s only today will be -- will be\nheard by Germany, and tomorrow by the whole world, you know. Some of these guys in\nmy hired entourage, they thought that this couldn\u2019t be -- couldn\u2019t be really real, and by\nthat they changed that you know, that\u2019s certainly exceptional. But that also shows -- show\nnow, as a historian, I\u2019ve learned that, you know, people do not reflect too much the\n[indecipherable]. If they would, you know, the main problem of the Third Reich is that\nthe Third Reich was successful in preventing the people to have any time and leisure, in\norder to reflect. If they would have had the possibility, then I think that -- I think the\nwhole thing would be proten down.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting. You think that was on purpose, the way in which the --",
        "A: Well, it was not so much on purpose, but it was a -- was a mentality of the party. You\nknow, if you have such an organization which relies on continuous dynamics, you know,\nand they have a feeling, if there is no longer any dynamic, then there\u2019s nothing left, you\nknow. And I run all this theory that there is a -- a connection between the Munich\nagreement, which meant that Hitler couldn\u2019t have his little war against Besarakia, and the\nparty we have forgotten, stood on alert all the time, well -- because they just thought they\nwould have a per -- a permanent role in the war later on, that it was dropped anyhow.\nAnd the Reich\u2019s Crystal Night. Because, exactly at a moment then, the German people\nbelieve now we c -- got a bit more quiet situation, and the peace is -- is rescued and so on.\nThen it\u2019s like a logical reaction of the party, was to push the Jewish question ahead.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: There\u2019s a psychologic connection bet -- between both events. You have a radical\nassession especially in situations in which otherwise, that would happen -- who would\ncome into being a stable, political situation. And then -- then they -- you know, their\nunrest, their inability to -- to wait, or something like that, could use a certainly dynamics,\nand the steady mobilization, and it -- so far, I think 1t wasn\u2019t a -- a deliberate policy, but it\nwas a specific political style they had only learned in the 20\u2019s. That would be my theory.",
        "Q: At the end of the war, does your father have to go through de-Nazification, because he\nwas a member of the party?",
        "A: Yes, he -- he -- he had some --",
        "Q: And what did --",
        "A: -- problems because -- well, that is a very difficult story. First of all, he had -- he had\nsome problem because he had American students, and one of them was a man who was in\nthe headquarters of Eisenhower, and he got the unfortunate -- unfortunate idea to ask him\nwhether he should take the position of Minister of cultures in -- in the -- the land of\nHessia, because it was a reformer of the university system in the 20\u2019s and the\n[indecipherable], all the colleagues did everything to get him out of that, but that also put\nso much [indecipherable]. Then there was an American CID officer, he is still existing,\nhe is politic -- political scientist in California. He ist -- came from Vienna, and you won\u2019t\nbelieve it, he wanted to press my father to support ESED. He was a leftist. And after my\nfather declined, then he wrote a terrible expertise on him, and that dis-destroyed his\ncareer. He was losing his office, he had problems with the de-Nazification o -- although\nat the end he -- he was acquitted, but it took him like a couple of years, and so that -- that\naffected the kids, because all of the years he didn\u2019t have any income. So now you take a\nfamily from a upper, bourgeois class, with that background, and suddenly there is no\nmoney at all. It was very difficult for them. It was difficult for us, too. Later on, it -- that\nwasn\u2019t so -- so important. But if that -- if Major Dorn wouldn\u2019t have that wonderful idea,\nyou know, it would have been better for the family.",
        "Q: So how did you survive? Did you lose your house, or were you able to ge --",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t lose our house, but well, it was -- it was very, very difficult, and certainly\nwe -- we Sold everything what we could, and so on, and Fritz, that was the older brother,\nhe was able to -- to use a black market, and so on, and somehow that worked, but only\nsomehow, it was very hard time. And I think it wasn\u2019t just -- it was really bad. And now\nwith that becomes a little bit known, because people are doing some research on the\nMarburg University, it\u2019s very interesting. Well, it\u2019s interesting sa -- that case, you know,\nbecause most all these people, all these professors, [indecipherable] officers, only very,\nvery few were thrown out, but in this case, it was very bitter. But that was -- well, for me\nit was very interesting then, and Major Dorn came and then what\u2019s her name, other man\nwho runs for many years, he asked me [indecipherable] Berlin. Had a moment, forget a\nname, also. You know, I never forget a -- suddenly there comes in an American officer,\nfirst ttme I see an American officer in uniform in so on, 1t was very impressive. I was 14,\nand then they -- when came, you know, before the war ended, you know?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Because the war ended in [indecipherable] with big slayeron you know, and so on. It\u2019s a\nvery interesting experience. And they had started with my father, you know.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: It was -- so Mr. Sweezy [indecipherable] who then was in Prame, and wa -- was the only\none who accepted the antifar committees, and so on, which existed in Germany by that\ntime. Oh --",
        "Q: How long was it before you were able to go back to school?",
        "A: Well, I think we could continue in school. That was interrupted anyhow, half a year,\nbecause the Americans got that crazy idea, just to have a collective taking into custody of\nall people who had a title rat. The German word 1s rat, and means counselor, th -- you\nknow, that\u2019s in the German civil service, and there was a position, but then suddenly all\nthe teachers sat in the internment camps, and the [indecipherable] was -- was gone.\nWhether we were Nazis or not, you know, that was a really crazy idea, and it took time,\nthen to -- to put the school system into function again, and so on. By that, I lost a year in\nthe school.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But then the -- we stayed in the school, and later on there was some improvement. I don\u2019t\nknow why that was done.",
        "Q: Let me ask you again, maybe I missed it. Did your father ever get back to teaching, or\nwas his career --",
        "A: No, he wud -- there was a compromise, and he gots a -- got an emeritus on that\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: And that was it?",
        "A: Yes, that was it. But he was giving lectures all the time as emeritus.",
        "Q: Uh, huh. And does that mean he was also getting a salary as an emeritus?",
        "A: Yes, he got some pensions, you know --",
        "Q: Some pensions.",
        "A: -- but the problem was that -- that in the meantime the very nice colleagues had to put\nsomebody on his chair.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And after the teenis vacation trial was finished, he -- the chair was -- was not available,\nand that was it, you know. And I had to study with that man, I didn\u2019t like that man much,\nas you can imagine. Now it turns out that he had way close relations with the SS\napparatus, that man, the Fritz Wagner, you know, who ended that chair. But he was uni --\nunisancta of the Catholic organization, and that had a much influence at that time.",
        "Q: D-Do you recall, if you can be a witness to this, that this experience of your father was\nvery depressing for him. Did he change because of this, or did -- was this just --",
        "A: Well, he tried to write books, but in a way it was reda -- really depressing for him",
        "Q: Uh-huh. I would imagine. Did you know for, I don\u2019t know, a long time, that you wanted\nto go into history, or was it --",
        "A: W-We certainly didn\u2019t want to. We tried to avoid it, because of the family, you know?\nAnd Wolfgang, he started physics, and -- but he was still interested in philosophy and the\n-- and philosophy of history, and suddenly he was a historian. And I started German\nlanguage, and everything, but suddenly I was a historian. Maybe we had a -- in the years\nwhen the father was with our business, we also, all the time, helped him to write many\nbooks, and so on. I don\u2019t know, but anyhow, we both wer -- became historians, although\nwe don\u2019t wanted to become it. Well that -- that happens, you know.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re a reluctant historian.",
        "A: I had been.",
        "Q: Had been a reluctant historian.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And your two older brothers?",
        "A: Yes, the oldest one, he was archivist, but he had a -- certainly some trouble to gain a\nposition, because it was -- he had to study, then later on, you know, he was already rather\nold, and what he -- when -- he lived on his whistle, I guess. The next one got a Protestant\npriest.",
        "Q: Interesting. So, once you started in your reluctant career, what did you start studying?\nWhe -- How -- How did you move into history? What was the --",
        "A: Well, we -- we would study many -- in two fields, or two and a half fields in Germany,\nand did Communistic, and as a second field, history, and at first I was at Marburg, and\nthe only field in history which was interesting, was Medieval history, and certainly\nmodern history was also there. The Fritz Wagner, whom I didn\u2019t like very much, as you\ncan imagine -- although I had examinations with him, I\u2019ll never forget it, because he was\nreally fearful, you know. In a way he didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t want to make blunders in the\nexamination. Now -- And by that I -- I got a Medievalist, and then I made my exam there.\nI wrote a examination paper, which I deft -- I think quite interesting besides, on the\ndevelopment of the region in the west of the Rhine, which is to ca -- today called the\nnaicowanda. But that didn\u2019t fit into the theories of my professor, and he gave me only a B\nminus. And I decided then I\u2019Il leave that, and go to teebing, to Hans Rodefass, about that\nI went back to contemporary history, and certainly to the Tside cacheefta\nessensasencherm. That means the history of National Socialism, although I did my\ndissertation work on the nationality problem in the Hapsburg monarchy, and the period\nbetween 18 -- 1867 and 1907, which was quite interesting, and certainly had a lot to do\nwith the German Czech relations at that time.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to stop the tape now, so they can change tapes.",
        "A: It\u2019s okay.",
        "Q: And we\u2019|l take a slight break.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Mr. Mommsen, during the break you started talking more about your own naivet\u00e9. So\nbefore we go back to your career, talk -- talk a little bit about what that reflection feels\nlike, that you were so -- you say about yourself that you were so naive about what was\ngoing on. You didn\u2019t notice.",
        "A: Well, as a youngster, you wouldn\u2019t notice so much, and we were not polit -- very\npolitical. And if you are living in a situation where -- no-nobody would talk about that,\nthen certainly some naivet\u00e9 is arising. I told that I d-didn\u2019t know what Jews are, what\nJewish life is, that in the post-war years there, it took me awhile to realize not only that\nthere was the Holocaust, and the Jewish persecution, that was easy, but -- but that Jews\nwere interesting individuals, you know, because you have to -- we\u2019re living in a German\nlittle town, Jews would d-disappear from the city, you wouldn\u2019t know who they -- where\nthey -- wh-where are Jews, and even those Jews who lived there we-were not discernible,\nand were the -- they would cut all communications to the so-called Aryan population. By\nthat, if you grow up as a kid, Jews didn't have any arriello -- idea of what that -- that was,\nyou know. And certainly I was told that we were su-surviving as a -- as a -- babies,\nbecause of a Jewish professor, who was a junior colleggest -- trolegest, and knew what to\ndo with early birds, and so on, and we knew that there was a lot of Jewish colleagues, and\nthe father told us about that, but you know, that was no all reality of the Jews -- y-you\ndidn\u2019t know much about that. I think that was very symptomatic for my age cohorder,\nyeah. And that they certainly were told in the Hitler youth, there was a Jewish question\nsomething, in Moscow, or somewhere, but they never realized that it\u2019s our Jews.\nCertainly those people who were with the olderunder -- really understood what was going\non inorise Crystal Night, and so on. They must have realized that, you know. That -- But\nthat is also part of what I -- I mentioned earlier, of that incremental depolitization.",
        "Q: You mention in the break that you had gone into a kosher restaurant, you didn\u2019t even\nrealize it.",

        "A: A chit -- you know, the whole -- the whole time, mention of Jewish life had disappeared\nin our minds, and now that was no longer existing.",
        "Q: I see. So, when did you come to decide that you would study the period of National\nSocialism? How did it happen that you decided that?",
        "A: Well, I decided on the one hand because we were influenced by Hans Roadface, who was\nrunning the -- the leading periodical, and also after I ta -- finished my Ph.D. there, I went\ninto the Institute Ratied Catcheechta, that means the leading institute for contemporary\nhistory, in Munich. And certainly wat -- and I was primary -- primarily in that business.\nBut think that\u2019s not all, but it\u2019s very symptomatic for our -- our ca -- generation that they\njust we -- were preoccupied to learn why the father generation had accepted the rule o-of\nAdolf Hitler you know, that was -- was a pressing issue, and therefore, many of my\nfellow students would also deal with -- especially the Wimayears, in order to understand\nthe seizure of power later on, then we would enter also the second phase of the regime,\nafter 1934, and studied that. That is, I think a typical process. And the following\ngeneration then, would look into 19\" century. What are the basic reasons for the German\nway -- for the deformation of German politics. That was when, signified by the so-called\nBeedafeld school.",
        "Q: And how do you understand the -- th-the -- if -- if you could summarize the sort of\nhistoriography of what\u2019s going on in Germany, and how historians are trying to\nunderstand the Nazi era. Are there very clear demarcations as you see them, in how\npeople are studying this, and --",
        "A: Well, the deka -- a lot of demarcation lines. In our first [indecipherable] you know, in the\nearly post-war, those people who dealt with that, even in journalism, or 1-in history,\ncertainly professional historians had a apprehension against -- to doing contemporary\nhistory, they did that on account of some sort epilaga -- epilagactic position, you know.\nAnd then they have the dichotomy between the SS state on the one hand, you know, the\nsuppression, the police state, the apparatus, and on the other hand the German resistance,\nwhich we call the other Germany, and in the midst were also some people, but you know,\nthis tule -- this picture was a way [indecipherable] one. And that was mixed then with the\nfear of totalitarian dictatorship, and the idea of the molithic structure of the regime, and\nthe predominant role of Adolf Hitler. That was the old position, which I think was\nprevailing in through the middle -- into the end of the 60\u2019s. Now there happened one\nchange that the American government returned the captured German files in 1967. And\nour generation of [indecipherable] had the first time the opportunity to look really into the\nfiles, and not only in the selected documents, which we are typical for the Nuremberg\ntrials, or living from memoirs of contemporaries and witnesses. We looked into the files,\nand we got a very different picture than that of the monolithic state, and so all the\ncontradiction within a system, and that\u2019s why the -- but then developed it -- a quite\ndifferent understanding of how the regime functioned then. For instance, Hans Roadface\nor Caldidish baha [indecipherable] older generation. And they also -- the so-called\nFunctionalist school emerged. I belonged to the Functionalist school. I would certainly\npoint it out that it -- it not sufficient only to look at the ideology on the one hand, and to --\nto say that Hitler wrote his program down in the Mein Kampf, and then everything\nhappened like that, it\u2019s nonsense. And that is also a apologetic element, just to put Hitler\nin the foreground all the time, because -- and our function was to show that the\nresponsibility of what had happened, had to be put on broader sco -- shoulders, and that\nwas, over there, some mechanisms of the -- the one hand, the -- the style of politics, and\nthe perception of politics, which was specific Fascist, and a specific structure, which put\nJews then what I call cumulative radicalization, which may explain the proceedings, or\nthe -- the way Nazi policy took, and t -- that can be especially, I think shown with respect\nto the Jewish persecution.",

        "Q: -- debate. On the one had, the Intentionalist can often be considered to be Apologists, but\nthere are many Jews, there are many victims who are very sympathetic with that view.",
        "A: Well, I know that, you know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and especially the Israelis, because certainly the Israelis also have that -- that\n[indecipherable] reason for that one-ness that the -- the Israelian historiography has been\ndeveloped by German professors who were mainly representatives of the history of ideas.\nThat has been continued by men like Talman, and the others, I know them, you know?\nAnd certainly also the background of the Jewish religion is very favored for history of\nideas, you know. But that, yeah they have still today, problems to -- to do a simple social\nhistory. But mainly they are -- they are working in history of ideas. Therefore, they have\none bias in that direction. Secondly, you know, the strong connection between notion of\nthe creation of the state of Israel, and the role anti-Semitism stands in the background.\nAnd so had sa -- the survivors, they have problems, I can understand that, to -- to accept\nwhat already was a conflict with Hana-ah, and to accept the trivial elements in that\npolicy. It\u2019s very, very comprehensible that they don\u2019t want to have these very trivial\nelements as elements of explanation, and -- and so forth, the Functionalists have a\ndifficult time if they talk to those people. Although we say one can\u2019t explain everything\nwhere the ideological factor, or the personal factor Hitler, and they have to put in that\nelement of bureaucratic competition, and so on, and no -- but you know the whole --\nwhole controversy between Functionalists and Intentionalists is coming to an end, you\nknow. Eruda Bower says that, and -- and sometimes Karl Hiberg would say that he is a\nStructuralist, and -- and what Chris Browning did in writing the [indecipherable] 101, he\nsuddenly got a -- got a notion that it wouldn\u2019t work with the Intentionalist explanation,\nwhich he originally had, you know, I never forgot, and that was [indecipherable] debate\nwith them, you know. At that time, he was in another camp. But today, most of the\nresearchers in a way of taking up our Functionalist -- Functionalist elements of\nexplanation, and everybody gets aware that Hitler was not a man who was -- had -- had\nthat [indecipherable] personality, you know, that this was a merth, and that things are\neven more -- were even worse, because there are many people who -- who pushed the\nprocess, I think, atafond, and certainly this viewpoint increases a responsibility, and a\nmoral responsibility of the nation, versus a specific Nazi perpetrators, you know. And my\ngeneration, we fought against that position, that there are only very few people besides of\nHimmler, and [indecipherable] Hitler, that they -- seduced, is the term. For fear they\nseduced the German nation, you know. That was your -- the main argument. And we\nstarted to -- just to get rid of that crazy idea, I wanted to show how that could happen, I\ncertainly -- that was, and still is our question, how could that happen? And certainly I\nwould argue then -- your argument -- I can\u2019t go to the next generation and say there was\nsome stupid, crazy individual called Adolf Hitler, that\u2019s why they killed five million\nJews. I don\u2019t think that this is sufficient. It seems to be real plausible, but then it\u2019s not\nplausible by -- because why could one man do that? And so on, we\u2019re -- in a way we have\nto describe the background on which Hitler could then have that function. And so far, I\nthink in the fear -- the misunderstanding of both fronts, I think have overcome. There\u2019s\njust the next polarization between younger historians who want -- who would go back to\nsome ideological explanation, said as Uri Shalbud, and the other ones who were some\nexperience and say, well, you will have the same development as we had at -- that he\noriginally stud-studied all the time, the Nazi [indecipherable] longer, and we got a idea\nthat it\u2019s not so important. Certainly there was a basic anti-Jewish resentment, no question,\nbut that there had been other mechanisms we share, what then may explain the perversion\nof a civilicized nation into a -- a apparatus of criminals, and that is still the problem.",
        "Q: Is -- Is the functional -- Was the functional -- I don\u2019t know, my study of history would s -\n- would suggest to me that this is a very odd dichotomy. I don\u2019t know of any other event\nwhere all of this -- where you have this -- is it a kind of fake dichotomy? How do you not\ntalk about ideas, and how do you not talk about the structure in terms of which these\nideas function?",
        "A: That\u2019s okay, but you know, there is some difference. You know, the terms have been\ncoined by Jim Mason at a conference near Lornan many years ago, when there was -- was\na clear cut, I think, distinction of the -- of the explanation between something like a\nhistory of ideas, and something like social history, that\u2019s different, you know? And so far,\nthat was also related to the explanation of the field, and certainly the whole metalogical\ndifference wouldn\u2019t play such a big role if they wa-wouldn\u2019t have been loden with some\nrole -- with some moral legacies, you know. Because the Germans need a strong Hitler,\nbecause if Hitler would be weak, they can\u2019t [indecipherable]. I never forgot that famous\nLouden conference, where there was a discussion where Hitler could preserve his rule for\nso long, it was very long, in a way, while he was -- I coined that formula, in some\nrespects, a weak dictator.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And certainly I wasn\u2019t tact all the time, because u -- I always thought I would defend\nHitler, I didn\u2019t want to -- want to, but turn out that with the -- that the emotional element,\nthat was very symptomatic, and then I said, really, look, if you have a dictatorship, then\nit\u2019s really likely that perseveres. Take Idi Amin. Oh, I was already wint by that, because\nthat violated the chair of national pride. We want to have a strong Hitler, not Idi Amin,\nnow that -- that shouldn\u2019t be done, you know. That\u2019s a basic background, all that, and to\nunderstand that, one has to come back to what we talked about, where the Germans\nwould take the personality of Hitler out of the responsibility of the crimes and decay,\nbecause they preverse them -- pre-preserve them something like icon for their national\nidentity. Now, in 1945, they certainly got aware that this was wrong. And not -- now the\nemotion turned against Hitler.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And if then somebody like Hans Mommsen [indecipherable] the other week in Germany,\nHitler was not only the subject, but also the object of politics. You get immediately a very\nangry criticisms, even by -- by very good historians. Karl Dietrich baha -- he immediately\nwrote and said, \u201cHow can you say that Hitler\u2019s objects are [indecipherable]. Well, why\nnot, you know. If you talk that -- If you talk about that in England or America, it\u2019s not so\ndifficult, be -- but there is a -- apologetic element, the emotional elements, which I think\nare guided the debate, and also the research. And that\u2019s why we have that -- that\u2019s not\nonly a metalogic distinction, or dim -- different starting point, but they had then this\ncontroversy between Functionalists and Intentionalists. That is certainly gone with the\nnext generation, which doesn\u2019t have that necessity to defend in a way, indirectly, the\nGermans [indecipherable] pointing out the manipulative character of Nazi dictatorship\nand all that. But they needed, in order to believe that they had been seduced. Certainly the\nopposite was true, they made Hitler, they in turn wanted to use him certainly then Hitler\nused them, you know, but that still proves with which certainly they -- nobody would\nreject them outright, but th-they are not very convenient. And then so far, I think I am\nstill not too old fashioned [indecipherable] an old historian, you know. The next\ngeneration certainly doesn\u2019t have that problem. They don\u2019t see also this specific\nconstellation under which we developing contemporary history.",
        "Q: Let me ask you about a quote from your piece, and from Vimar, to Auschwitz. You say\nthat the Nazi system of rule completely lacked internal coherence.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you explain that for our --",
        "A: Well, you know, there was a Sherman Oaks, one of the leading English experts in the\nfield, and he talked about the re-organization of the party in 1932, in December 1932,\nimmediately before the seizure of power, and he then said that from then on, they had 37\ndifferent territories, with a rather independent Gauleiter, and so far, as they can do what\nthey want. And you know, the problem is -- is not coordination within the system.\nEverybody can act, everybody can make initiatives and so on, as far as that stays, as they\naccept the authority, or the prestige abi -- Adolf Hitler. And the thing we have to do with\nthe specific style of Nazi politics -- it\u2019s very difficult, especially for a European say,\nAmericans are better, to understand this regime, which doesn\u2019t have any institutionalized\ngovernmental board, or some representation. But after 1937, we don\u2019t have a cabinet,\nthere is no political discourse between the different ministries. We don\u2019t have that on the\nparty side either. There is nothing which would integrate diverging political interests, in\nsa -- in the -- the very diverging politic interests are then -- are brought to conflict or not,\nis by personal feuds. That\u2019s the reason why everybody among the Nazi regime hates the\nothers. And some of the later Gauleiter would say if Hitler -- Himmler comes into my\nterritory, my gow, I will imprison him, you know. They hated -- They hated each other,\nyou know. And the whole system is built on that -- watha -- non-structure. At the same\ntime, you have a system of non-communication. If you were in the high position of that\nregime, let\u2019s say you are the secretary of state in your [indecipherable]. You know\nsomething, but you don\u2019t know everything. The case of Mr. Kritchinger, who was a -- a\nmember of the confessor -- confessing church, but he -- he was present at the Wannsee\nconference. Was really took -- Because he didn\u2019t get a clear cut picture of the Holocaust\nbefore, I think the middle of 1942. And then he wanted to get dismissed, and the lama\nsaid, \u201cNo, no, stay. It would be better if you stay here,\u201d you know. And there was a\nsystematic non-communication. In the newspaper, you wouldn\u2019t get the necessary\ninformation of what was really going on, and then there was the so-called\nshtimmelsburchter report of the securities service, made by -- these so -- should in a way\nreplace them -- lack of information for the leading functionaries within this history -- s --\nwithin the system. But after they became inconvenient, because of too many inconvenient\ntrusay they also were no longer permitted. Where did you get information from? It\u2019s very\neasy to read today the d-diary of Goebbels, and you see that even Goebbels, who is at a\n[indecipherable] sometimes at a [indecipherable] the system, because they\u2019re changed all\nthe time, he isn\u2019t very well informed about important ada -- aspects of politics. And that\nis a -- cer -- specific nature of that regime. And we have th -- we have also a travelma, to\nprove who was then really responsible for the onicol, because that happened, and there\nwas no precise mechanism. And you know, I point that out, no-not only -- not to say that\npeople were not responsible for what they were doing, you know, but to explain why\nthere was no opposition, you know. And it -- In the question of the Holocaust, there could\nhave been opposition on the side of the army, or other groups, not because they were not\nanti-Jewish, I wouldn\u2019t say that, but because of th -- the ta -- c-competing interests,\nbecause Jews the -- a certain amount of -- of manpower and resources in order to do the --\nthe Holocaust. Cosponick has shown that in 1943, they had 300 men just to liquidate\nJews in the east -- and the whole army at that time has only 1,000,800. You know? But\nunder those specific ambivalent condition, where you didn\u2019t have any institutional set of\npolitics, then something like Holocaust could occur. That\u2019s a tatrol out of the analysis,\nand I\u2019ve had this also a conclusion which may have -- be some importance for future\nevents, because genocidal acts usually would come into being, if there is no clear cut\ncommand structure, not the other way around. If we look at Vietnam, we know that we\nwill -- certainly that could be it -- not -- no comparable level, but you know, certainly, if\nwe look at the Holocaust, we also look helpul existence are like, which would then be a --\nable to be per-perverted in that direction, that there is no protest against the destruction of\nall the foundations of law, and destruction of all the radius, which is certainly\naccompanying the implementation of the Holocaust, according to my conviction.",
        "Q: But that is somewhat counter to what one might think, right?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: That there -- Is there no notion that this is what somebody wants to be done, even if\nthere\u2019s no clear cut order?",
        "A: There is certainly -- well, that\u2019s -- the long run, they got accustomed to get rid of the\nJews, and suddenly they learned, under the conditions of the occupied Soviet territory,\nwhere the recent study said a -- under certain conditions, then certainly then, see that it\u2019s\npossible, that it\u2019s the easiest thing just to kill those people. First, before that, they want to\nhave some reservations, solutions, that turn out to be impossible, and so on, and at the\nend it was for them, the easy d -- way, to kill the Jews. And after they had started with\nthat, then certainly the German bureaucratic perfectionism got into the business, and then\nthey had the systematic liquidation of every Jewish women and kids which they could\nfind in Ukraine, or elsewhere. You know, that is really in -- that is -- well, impresses me a\nlot, and well there you have then the marriage between Nazi fanatism, and Prussian state\ntradition, and this terrible affect -- affectivity of the Germans. Other nations would have\njust said, well that in -- why -- we -- we -- th-that -- that\u2019s not interesting for us. But the\nGermans, and the way they are on a problem, then they do that up to the way and -- and\nthey hold icemen so he shows that that 1s still -- that business of killing the Hungarian\nJews, after he had a counter order, obviously a counter order by Himmler, you know,\nthat\u2019s very symptomatic for that process. And it -- so far, we have not only to do with\nanti-Semitic moderation, but also with attitudes which are things stemming from the\nPrussian state tradition, in a way. -- murdered Fromme, certainly.",
        "Q: And do you really think there\u2019s something very special about the German state, and the --\nand Prussian history, given all the help that Germany got doing this?",
        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t overestimate the impact of national history on the process, but certainly\nthere is something like a -- a -- the -- well -- that has been called by -- from the\nauthoritarian character, and the authoritarian character plays a role, I think, f -- to fulfill\nthe expectation by the Nazis and by Hitler, you know, th-they then just did, and you can\nsee that with their example, the Reich\u2019s Crystal Night, and all the -- the German\npopulation protested way much against the violent acts in the night of the ninth of\nNovember already, and the eighth, and so on. But then the Gestapo gave the explicit\norder that they should take into custody 20, or 20 thous -- 25,000 Jews. That was a state\nmeasure, they accepted that, you know? This is a strange element. Law and order can\nwork under certain conditions. That they criticize the Nazi policy, but in -- then also can\nsupport Nazi policy. And in a way it did, especially if you look how they then proceeded\nin getting these European Jewry from the last isle in Greece, or elsewhere. You know, it\u2019s\nreally nonsense, nobody would have done that in the whole world. In that respect I think\nit\u2019s uniquely German. Maybe the Russians, and some people there have a -- have some\nheritage from Germany to do that in their day, if they start then to bring it to a -- toa -- I\nthink complete, and that\u2019s, I think one specific element. But, on the other hand, we\u2019re\nstarting to study what the French police did, and maybe they count a very depressing\nresults [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Do you think that people -- that historians now are more accepting of your view of -- of\nHitler?",
        "A: Well, I think it\u2019s gone -- it\u2019s -- everybody is of that opinion, because w -- you know, we\nknow more documents. We know that Hitler didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t -- he was a ideological motor\nall the time, especially in the Jewish question. But, on the other hand, he didn\u2019t always\npush things ahead, and now it turns out that also the Wannsee conference has to be\ninterpreted in a somewhat different context. The main problem of Heydrich, besides of\ngetting, or increasing his competence for the so-called Jewish question, was that he didn\u2019t\nwant to proceed with the Nuremberg laws, and hi -- difference between Jews and half\nJews, and Jews living in mixed marriages, you know, that very complicated system, to\ndistinguish between a more assimilated, and a less assimilating [indecipherable].\nBecause, certainly on the one hand, a party from the star wanted to include everybody\nwho was of Jewish descent, up to the quarter Jew, and to the -- all the first -- the\n[indecipherable] exclusion from Germany, and later on the liquidation. And the problem\narose that Hitler didn\u2019t want to change the Nuremberg laws, and he was not following the\nsuggestions of Heydrich, and Himmler, and the so-called mishling question, the -- the k --\nthe question of -- how do you say that in English?",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: That means a half, quarter, and so on, Jews. And Heydrich invited the ministers to the\nWannsee conference, to decuss -- discuss that issue, and to get approval of the ministries,\nand the Reich chancellor, which were involved. In order then to press on Hitler, to get the\napproval to include the half Jews, and the Jews living in mixed marriages. And Hitler at\nthat point was a -- was something like a brake. Certainly motivation is very clear, he -- he\ndidn\u2019t change -- want to change in later years, anything, and he thought it terribly inp --\nunpopular if he would touch the assimilated Jews. And he was less strict in that issue than\nHeydrich, and Himmler and others. That gives to the Wannsee conference certainly, quite\nanew meaning, and Eichmann, who was expert on the mishlings question, that means the\nquestion of half and quarter Jews, he wanted to di -- let disappear his role. And by that,\nhe over -- he pointed at the ongoing liquidation in that famous speech delivered by\nHeydrich, wh -- and now -- by now we know very well that Heydrich had in mind what\nwas going on with the construction of that so-called rollbarn defore, that was a big street\nbetween Lublin and -- and Krakow. And from there he had a -- Jewish labor camps, and\nwhere he practized quote unquote, annihilation through labor, and that is then mentioned\nin this speech by Heydrich. Because 20 days later he would, in Prague, still talk about all\nthe deportation, all the 11,000,000 Jews -- European Jews, to the Icemeer region, where\nthe Gestapo wanted to have a -- it\u2019s own territory, and a continuing the archy period in\nthe gulag. You know, that was really simple. But in the ensuing weeks, suddenly\neverything changed, and then they did not he-hesitate then, to implement the systematic\nliquidation of the European Jews, but not so much at the Wannsee conference. And you\nknow, and so far, still the central part of that history, opened to different interpretations\nby now, but certainly that doesn\u2019t change anything in the very terrible development, and\nthe criminal character of that, but it makes it, I think, a bit more comprehensible. And\ncertainly the problem still is that -- that it\u2019s not only Hitler who is doing that, certainly\nhe\u2019s supporting that all the time. The discussion is to what extent Hitler was informed.\nCertainly I -- I wouldn\u2019t say that Hitler was not, but on the other hand, he didn\u2019t want to\nknow too much. And therefore, there was not too much discourse between the underlings\nand him, Hitler, as everybody assumed. But the -- obviously that was not necessarily the\ncase. Hitler was living in the ideological world, he all the time was characterized by a\nflight from reality, and he was not a man who looked at things day to day, you know.\nThat was a original position when I started that business of Nazi history. Well, is that\nsome sufficient explanation of your question?",
        "Q: Yes, you did. Let me ask you about your involvement with studying Hannah Arant,\nbecause you seem much more sympathetic than many historians.",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Yes --",
        "Q: Which --",
        "A: Well, at that time, this was very difficult to get anybody who was ready to talk about\nHannah Arant in Israel, and -- forget it. And also Hans Wartfels, he was a clear cut\nopponent of Hannah Arant. Why\u2019d I think Hannah Arant had some good points? We\nknow today that this was not very reliable, that he used the book of Raoul Hillberg to a\ngood part, and that he -- that she, you know, all the time tends to -- to overshoot the mark,\nyou know, and so on, but in general I think she was right with the main thesis\n[indecipherable] available. And all that certainly was a problem that is so difficult to\nunderstand for the survivor side. I do understand that very well, while that issue on the --\nRaoul -- of the Jewish council, I think have been otherwise too [indecipherable]. But the\nmain problem certainly is that, in fact, Iseman was very active, but he was on the other\nhand not a man who [indecipherable] and new research has found out that Iseman comes\ninto that business first because of the resettlement of the ethnic Germans in 1939, because\nof the German-Soviet agreement. And he is responsible for the interpretation of the\npillars, and the Jews, and other groups from Vladica, in order to resettle the Germans\nthere. And there they make their first experiences, and by that they are working for the\nestablishment of the greater German Reich, and that\u2019s not only that negative element, and\nlater on you know everything 1n that [indecipherable] resettlement in [indecipherable]\naffairs, and it didn\u2019t work, but then something like an overcompensation down there,\nwork very hard and honor -- at least -- at least, to implement the Holocaust, they did it.\nYou know, I think that\u2019s a psychological mechanism, it\u2019s very important to give an\ninterpretation of the group of the -- of the local and regional perpetrators.",
        "Q: How do you understand -- I have seen, over the years, not a lessening of anger at her -- at\nHannah Arant, but in some sense an enlargement of the anger. When the book came out\nabout her relationship with Heideger, it gave people even more reason to --",
        "A: Well, but change, the -- the other year, I have been in Jerusalem, they had on a scolley\nconference on Hannah Arant, and they took over the admiration of Hannah Arant, which\nis I think symptomatic for the United States, we would be more critical in Germany. And\nher problem certainly is that both sides don\u2019t understand that Hannah Arant is basically\ninfluenced by the [indecipherable] your Conservative -- tism. Which 1s different from\nbigots. One has to know that in order to understand Hannah Arant. In all her theories, you\nknow, of the philasinhite, of the loneliness of man, and then there comes back the -- a\nmodel -- that the Jews are the model for the world population. Well, and if you look in a\nGerman idea, there\u2019s philosophy of the 19\" century of Fishter, and all these people, you\nsuddenly get it, that\u2019s her. But she t -- I think masschoserv has to be a pragmatic\nphilosopher, she 1s not. Therefore --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. No, she\u2019s an idealist -",
        "A: She is -- Well, about an -- with that crazy mixture, you know.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And a -- a -- th-- the easer -- it is -- don\u2019t understand that either, I think we -- I --\naccording to my opinion. I am not a specialist for Hannah Arant, but I met her. I never\nforget when I met her, because I was invited by American history department of the\nColumbia University. When was that? In 70 -- in \u201978, I think or \u201974. And my wife was\nthere, and that was in affecta club of the Columbia University. And they had very bad\norganizer, sadly it turned out that also Henry Freidlander was invited to deliver-liver a\nlecture, and then they decided that we had each a half an hour rather than hour lectures.\n[indecipherable] care. And there were about 200 people there, once was very lively, and\nthen suddenly somebody entered the room, that was Hannah Arant. I saw they knew her\nfrom the television, that was very clear. The whole atmosphere changed immediately, the\n-- the talk silenced down. She was there, you know, that was -- she had a radiation, no\nproblem, no. Then we had to give our papers, then she said, \u201cWell, both papers are very\nbad.\u201d This is wrong, that is wrong, she [indecipherable]. But anyhow -- And after that --\nthat was finished, the debate, I went with Wilfreda to her, and said hello, and she invited\nus immediately to go to her flat that was in Riverside Drive. And I forgot that she took a\ncab for that 300 meters or something, but that was the time there that was still very\ndangerous, you know. And then we were sitting there until two in the night, and that was\n-- that didn\u2019t change much, there were all the papers of her husband still there, the name\nof the husband at the entrance to the flat, and we had a very, very interesting talk. And\nshe was really good, I never forgot it.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit more about what you talked about, and what it was like?",
        "A: Not a problem, it\u2019s difficult to say what we talk. Certainly we reported a lot about\nGermany, German history and so on, and possibly she was a receiver more than -- I have\nto talk with my wife, she is better in recollecting these things, I don\u2019t know, but I only\nrecollect that th -- the -- the graduation of her personality, and on the other hand, you\nknow, she had learned in Germany that openness of the American academics, you know?\nImmediately you talk about what you\u2019re doing, what you want to do, and so on. She was\nreally good, you know.",
        "Q: So you were impressed?",
        "A: I was very much impressed, and also from the surrounding, these many books and papers,\nwho knows, was a lit -- anything but orderly, and I think she didn\u2019t change too much\nsince her husband died, and well -- and so far, I was very much impressed by her. That\ndidn\u2019t much influence what -- what my -- because I -- I wrote about the Eichmann trial\nbukfa earlier.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Th-That was far before she -- I met her then, and I was not influenced personally, but I\nthink that she had some good points at -- at that book.",
        "Q: Had she read what you had written?",
        "A: She must have known -- at least she knew who I was, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember that, you know. But I never got, you know, the openness\nand she was really ready to -- to talk with us, in spite of the criticism of that paper, you\nknow, so.",
        "Q: Tell me how you -- We all -- I don\u2019t know what I want to say, suffered through the\nGoldhagen controversy. Is there -- Was there something about that book that both took on\nthe Intentionalists, and the Functionalists together, trying to come up with the\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, it was quite good, because you know, there was a [indecipherable] written by --\nwhat is this Stuttgart destroy, and again, and a mountain -- and he -- bec -- and he\ncriticized then, or could ha -- was criticized to be a hyper-Intentionalist. And that was\nquite true. And -- But that all my enemies, you know, say -- opponents, they would then\nargue with Functionalist arguments against Goldhagen. And that was in a way, the end of\nthe Intentionalist school. Even if you take what the -- what the -- what Chris Browning\nsaid there, you know what, all the Functionalists are the ones against Goldhagen, and\nGoldhagen in a way, you know, by -- by expanding the Intentionalist position to the\nutmost, you know, it des -- he destroyed it, you know. And so far, it was in the -- it was\nquite interesting. I know him very well, I met him first in \u201985, in a conference which was\nrun in Berkeley by Gary Feldman, and there he delivered a paper on the [indecipherable]\nrepublic, and he was very, very critical about [indecipherable] republican said there was\nstill extreme anti-Semitism, which he would deny today, and he had, for instance, this\nstrange conclusion that in the Secret Service, there are more party members than have\nbeen in the Third Reich. You know, so I mean, that may be true, and so far, as nobody\ncould enter the Secret Service in the Third Reich, there was no member of the Nazi party.\nBut you know, he really thought that the [indecipherable] republic was completely Nazi\nparty, and anti-Semitic. And then later on, you -- now, his publisher told him not to tell\nthat, and Jerry Feldman -- Gary Feldman should publish that conference, I ne -- I met him\nin Oxford, and said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s with the conference?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have yet the\npaper of -- of Daniel Goldhagen.\u201d I say, \u201cYou will never get it,\u201d you know, he would --\nhe\u2019s [indecipherable] himself, he\u2019s doing that. And I never forgot I said to him, \u201cWell,\nDaniel, if you go to my class and [indecipherable] on the other hand that we are\nsympathetic to you, they wouldn\u2019t accept that, you would have hard time.\u201d And that\nimpressed him a little. And then I met him at a conference in -- on Hannah Arant, and\nothers -- other things in -- in Harvard. And we are sitting on a panel and he attacked me\nsharply and [indecipherable] republic, I never forgot it. On the same line, you know, that\nanti-Semitism is still there, and there -- course, when I was answering, I said to the -- to\nthe [indecipherable] also, you got it from the audience, anti-Semitism is still hanging, you\nknow, it was really -- it was a really not a very friendly climate. Then I said to the\naudience, well people, you must know the German Jew, the younger generation is doing\nanything to study the Holocaust, and to go to Israel, and to improve the German Jewish\nrelations, it\u2019s not fair if you say that. And I never forget that someday you tha -- that mud\nchange, you know, that was clear, that this was no longer the topic, German anti-\nSemitism. And then he told them -- I invited him for dinner, and he told me what he\nwanted to do in Germany, the whole [indecipherable] things, so and so on. I know him.\nKnow? Well, in a way, I glad that he got a prisoner of his own thesis, and of the whole\naffair, because I don\u2019t see that he has an academic future by that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because, as y -- he -- I know, the father very well, ri -- when I was in Harvard, I met the\nfather several times. That was in \u201972, and I also met that -- the very young Daniel, you\nknow. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- In a way it\u2019s a pity, and the book 1s so terribly bad, from the -- from\nthe scholarly viewpoint. It\u2019s not a -- so much a problem with the position, but he doesn\u2019t\nknow anything about folkish anti-Semitism, and you know, it\u2019s quite interesting, where\ndid he got his idea of the -- how 1s that anti-Semitism called, e-el --",
        "Q: Eliminationists.",
        "A: Eliminatri -- Eliminatri, or Eliminationists anti-Semitist. That\u2019s Julius Langbean.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But he never read la -- Jultus Langbean, the [indecipherable] that very impressive and --\nand very popular anti-Semitic book of the [indecipherable]. He never read it. He got it by\nGeorgie Massey. There he got some information of Langbean that was also a bit one-\nsided, but well Georgie was a wonderful man, anyhow, and then he took that up without\nreally knowing what he took up, you know. Because he never understood the context of\nthe early -- that means the li -- 19\" century Wagnerian anti-Semitism, which was strongly\nconnected with the idea that the Jews are, in -- was -- some respects, a model nation for\nthe German one, and then they got the idea that the German nation can\u2019t be built, except\nof the elimination of the Jews from the German nation, so that -- that was not meant in\nthe sense of killing. Now see, all this assumes [indecipherable] he\u2019s as bad that he -- he c\n-- he -- he doesn\u2019t -- he isn\u2019t able to read German text correctly, you know. His\ninterpretation of one quotation of pishta Israel is really terrible. He wants them to -- to\nsay that there already was a idea of a systematic killing of choice. But, on the other side,\nwhere you have that, in the fergush movement, he doesn\u2019t mention it e-either, you know?\nBut you know, that\u2019s a story for -- o-of itself, and the reason was that he discovered a bit\nlate that Chris Browning had already written the book he wanted to write.",
        "Q: So he had to write something else.",
        "A: And by that, he added that part on the 19\" century, and added that part on the labor\ncamps, and the Death Marches.",
        "Q: What do you think of George Massey\u2019s work as a sort of culturalist orien?",
        "A: Well, George Massey, I knew him very well, we were together at Jerusalem, and he was a\nman one can\u2019t but adore, you know. But his book has some weaknesses. He is -- He is a\nhistorian of th -- of ideas, you know, and he also, I think, over exenderency anti-Semitic\nissues, Or -- In a way he 1s a forerunner of Daniel Goldhagen, in a way, you know. And he\nhas a lot of material that\u2019s very important. I wouldn\u2019t accept his a little bit monocausal\ninterpretation.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And certainly he is also one of those people who -- who if they have anti-Semitism, then\nthey think they have to explain the Holocaust. That\u2019s not my opinion. But it\u2019s\nindispensable, it\u2019s very good at that time, but he published that, that was pioneering, and\nfar better than everything which existed on the history of the German anti-Semitism it\u2019s\nquite clear. He put that in a broader politic context, you know, I can\u2019t have a lot of\npositive arguments, but in the principle -- principle, mathological point, I would say\npresent research is -- 1s, I think, has developed farther, and couldn\u2019t -- would avoid to\nhave this harda monocausal, and mainly I -- illogical interpretation, and but -- but I\nrecommend to read these books, anyhow.",
        "Q: D-Do you -- Cause I didn\u2019t speak with him about this. When Daniel Goldhagen\u2019s book\ncame out, was George sympathetic to the book, or not? I don\u2019t --",
        "A: I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know? I doubt it, yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, because he must have seen the weaknesses, because George knows the\nmaterial very well, you know, and what he\u2019s writing about in 19\" century, you know. No,\nGeor-George must have wudwich senicher undehenderben kauf to sunwichlong, can you\ntranslate that?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: D\u2019you know, you -- I said, if you are upset, then you -- then you\u2019ll say that, you know.\nHe can\u2019t accept that -- can\u2019t have accepted that, I think, because of the weakness of\nscholener research, you know. He was a really good scholar.",
        "Q: Yes. And how are you -- h-how do you view Raoul Hillberg\u2019s work?",
        "A: Well, that was a pioneering study, pioneering study. Unfortunately, it hasn\u2019t been\ntranslated to the German pur before 1982, and you know the reasons. It\u2019s not only the\nGerman disinterest, and it is today indispensable, you know, as a first book. But, on the\nother hand, the recent research, you know, did a lot more. Awhile ago, in 1932, I invited\nhim to deliver a lecture in -- in my university at Buckholm, telling him, if you could enter\n-- reclude the resettlement policy of Heinrich Himmler, in 1939 - 1940, you know? And\nhe answered he couldn\u2019t do that, then he would deliver what he usually delivers, you\nknow, his very competent survey on how the implementation of the Holocaust occurred\nstep by step. And then -- I met him in 1933, we -- at a museum, at that conference.",
        "Q: You mean 792, we\u2019re talking about 92. You said \u201932.",
        "A: 93. N -- I know, \u201993, you know?",
        "Q: \u00b093, right, the conference, yes.",
        "A: Another famous conference.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Where it was a main issue, what is the future of Holocaust research? Then he said the\nfuture of the Holocaust research lies in the context. Where was it? Because today we see\nthat we have to connect that with the other polit -- policy fields, especially the\nterminization and resettlement policy of Himmler, in order to understand why that could\nbe performed without any significant opposition. And that makes it then also better\ncomprehensible for next generations, who have difficulties to study only the little bit\nisolated Jewish field. Those are my position -- my field here, I thought I should be the\ngeneralist a little bit, in the midst of all these special -- specialists, and experts on certain\nfields of the Holocaust. They are far better than I am, but to know my role should be also\nin the lexus to give a little bit more the general context, because in the next generations\nwill be ready only to see this aspect, and I think -- well that\u2019s -- I continue the idea by Mr.\nRaoul Hillberg, you know, I adore him, he\u2019s a really good man.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019|l stop tape number two, and change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Tell me about the emergence of the Klemperer diaries in Germany, y -- in your lecture to\nthe Leo Beck Institute, you said that it was actually a bigger best seller than the\nGoldhagen book.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: How do you account for that? I mean, what do you think about these diaries?",
        "A: Well, the diaries are very impressive, especially for those youngsters, and for those\nstudents who want to realize how the living condition of Jews in Germany, and posey\nwith other parts of Europe at that time, really were. Certainly he is living in a mixed\nmarriage, that\u2019s -- a mixed po -- the -- Polish marriage. By that, he even certainly has\nbetter conditions than the average Jews, that\u2019s quite clear. But anyhow, what gets -- what\ngets a vivid, I think, picture of how -- what the Jewish situation in Nazi Germany was.\nAnd that\u2019s helps for the youngsters, I think, to understand what was going on. S -- You\nknow, for the first time, they get an interpretation of Jews, and Jewish life, and how they\nhad, or tried to survive, and so on. And because it\u2019s translated by a man who belongs to\nthe m -- basically to the German culture, and so on, it\u2019s obviously easier to understand\nthat, anyhow, that belongs to that new wave of sensitivity towards the Jewish question,\nwhich also was to be seen in the \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d film.",
        "Q: When -- When you read the diaries, and you think back upon your saying about yourself\nthat you were naive. Now, I understand you were a child, and he was an adult person, so\nI\u2019m not trying to compare your naivet\u00e9, and his la -- so-called lack of it, but it was\nfascinating to me how much he figured out.",
        "A: Yes, a --",
        "Q: Even given where he was. It seems really extraordinary.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s right, yes, but I must atsee as a child I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t hear that at the -- and\n-- and -- and I think in my hometown, that didn\u2019t -- that didn\u2019t occur too much. At least I\ndon\u2019t know, you know, I --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and, d\u2019you know, when I was growing up, in order to see something, you know, the\nJews had disappeared to the big cities, there was nothing left, and by that, I\u2019m a bad\nwitness in that respect.",
        "Q: But it is interesting to see those diaries, because it\u2019s clear that 1f you were adult person,\nand you would take the information that was coming in if you thought about it, which is\nwhat you said before, if you actually thought about it, you -- you\u2019d know.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, or at least know what the general direction was like.",

        "Q: An explanation of what?",
        "A: An explana -- no, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not an explanation of the attitudes of the population, you\u2019re\nright, but it\u2019s an explanation of how the isolation came into being, you know?",

        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right, yes.",
        "Q: So, can you tell me what you think is so problematic about this use of the word,\nuniqueness, and what it -- what it destroys.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s problematic, but you know, if I study historical events, I don\u2019t study\nthem for their u-uniqueness, but in order to learn from that, to have a better understanding\nof comparable, or prospeels, or opposite situations. And by that, that category of\nuniqueness is not very variable, I think. And, well certainly there is an u -- u-uniqueness\ninsofar as this systematic liquidation of millions of people in the 20\" century. It\u2019s\nincomparable to other developments. But I\u2019m -- I\u2019m always a bit cautious for what --\nwhat uniqueness can mean, you know -- you know. Or, the other day I have been in\nYucatan. What [indecipherable] with those populations. Well, it took them a century or\ntwo, the Germans did that within two years. That is maybe the uniqueness, that means our\ncentury. But the size of killing whole people, they maybe not so ni -- u-unique if you take\nin comparison to size of populations today, and in earlier periods. And so far, I would\nalso have a principle objection to use the term unique, because in a way, we don\u2019t much\nabout what is really unique.",
        "Q: We don\u2019t know.",
        "A: We don\u2019t know much about, compare -- well, history is a very broad business, I think.",

        "Q: Broad business.",
        "A: -- experience, you know. Well, you know, would have been in ancient societies, and so\nfar, but that\u2019s not a very important point. For me, it\u2019s not a principle question, whether\nthe -- the pate or the uniqueness. But certainly, it\u2019s only from a German viewpoint, the\naverage German viewpoint\u2019s only -- it\u2019s necessary to -- to connect that with the question\nof the murder of the Soviet prisoners of war, or the murder of Slav people, and Gypsies,\nand others. You know, that\u2019s quite clear ba -- th -- by that, it gets more comprehensible.\nAnd -- And if you look at that in order to show the pre-conditions for any pre-ju-jub --\nany genocidal policy, you know, then it shouldn\u2019t isolate that, and so far, the term\nuniqueness is not very helpful, but I wouldn\u2019t re -- wouldn\u2019t reject the -- that on the other\nhand, this is a unique event, which isn\u2019t comparable directly with the [indecipherable |\ngulag under Stalinism, and so on, although it | -- it lies on the same level. They are -- We\nwill discuss, I think, in future years a little bit, to what extent the -- the German\nperpetrators learned from -- from the local anti-Semitic populations in the east, and the\nRussians in the way. You know, the death marches are an invention by a Soviet -- by the\nSoviets. They did that with their own people. And then the German suddenly came to the\nidea to do it also, first with prisoners of wars, and at -- at the end, with concentration\ncamp inmates. That\u2019s Soviet, the idea of that in -- can -- let -- march people about,\nhundreds and kilometers, was very familiar in a -- start in this period. And so far,\nsometimes there are comparabilities which are -- shouldn\u2019t be precluded by accepting the\nunique character of the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Let -- Let me push this uniqueness just a little bit, be-because I -- there are certainly\ndebates about -- and you take it on, though not in these terms. The Holocaust is about the\nJews, the Jewish experience is unique. And then there\u2019s a -- a view that there\u2019s a\nuniversal way to look at the Holocaust, that there are many victims during the Holocaust.\nThe Jews may have been the major, or the primary ones. How -- How do you think it\u2019s\nbest to actually look at this event?",
        "A: Well, I would say -- would take up the argument that 1 -- on account of a -- a -- quite a lot\nof reasons. Some is certainly the traditional occ-Occidental anti-Semitism. The Jews were\nkilled, and the others not, just because the Nazis didn\u2019t have enough time to kill the\nothers. And my friend Kurt Salley, he would talk about the top of the iceman to know.\nWhere\u2019s the iceberg, or where --",
        "Q: Iceberg, yes, [indecipherable]",
        "A: Iceberg, you know. And I mentioned that, at a talk to -- and now I got about the\nresettlement policy, you know, it\u2019s quite the -- after -- there was some compensation\nmechanism which [indecipherable] at first met the Jews. And suddenly they are the -- the\nprejudice, and anti-Judaism, and not only a distinct anti-Semitic philosophy was\nresponsible, that the selection was then made, and a lot of other factors. But that - in -- in\nthe long run, that wouldn\u2019t have been an isolated phenomenon, they would have killed\nother groups, also. So th -- it was in a way, to put it in question marks, the easiest to kill\nthe Jews, because they didn\u2019t get opposition from their local populations, and you know,\nand you know, and you know. But the tendency to kill other groups as well, is\nunmistakably t-there. And it so far, you know, you can say there was a uniqueness on\ntheir -- within the general picture, there was something like a uniqueness, like maybe\nkind of ca -- try to put that in that way. And there is something which certainly explains\nthat the -- the Jews were killed foremost, and the others anyway survived, although\nkilling processes were underway all the time.",
        "Q: There is --",
        "A: Is that a sufficient answer?",
        "Q: Yes. There is a way in which -- when I read your stuff, and I think about reading other\npeople\u2019s material, that one gets the feeling that Nazism is either self-mutilating or\nsuicidal, that in the end it would eat itself up with death.",
        "A: That\u2019s my thesis, yes. So now, in the last months of the -- of the war, you know, they\nsuddenly said, we don\u2019t need only racial homogeneity, we need only political\nhomogeneity, and started to kill everybody in this time, 10 thousands of Germans, either,\nyou know. And then so far, you know, that was symptomatic for that form of -- of -- that\nstyle of politics.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know? If you -- If you have politics which are unable to have something like a\nlasting compromise, and then you have only destruction as the alternative, you know,\nthat\u2019s really --",

        "A: Well, usually historians are very critical, I\u2019m not. I think \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d is quite a\ngood film, and I think the historical data are mainly, I think, reliable. One can talk about\nsome interpretations here, but in general I think it helped to understand the process in the\nminds of many youngsters in Germany. And well, it doesn\u2019t replace the historical work,\nwhich is certainly more abstract, and less simple, but on the other hand, I think it was\nmore helpful than the documentary films we had in the -- in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s, which\ndidn\u2019t left an imprint on the German mentality, or at least not too much.",

        "A: I don\u2019t understand it very well, you know, we have an interchannel change, and suddenly\nwe have a generation which starts, and you -- well, it goes a whole way. We did, as\nhistorians, starting with the ideas, and turning back to issues they don\u2019t know -- want to\nknow that. And it\u2019s so forth they have, and -- and fairly increased interest in the second\nWorld War, and the Jewish issue, and so on. Among the younger students today, and\nthat\u2019s quite a phenomenon, and -- but it has to be interpreted in terms of interchannel\nchange. Do you know, after those generations have left office, or the positions who was --\nwho were in this or that kind involved, now the next generation wants to know, and to\nprovide information and -- and that -- start anew, I think.",
        "Q: So, 1s that connected with what you said in your Leo Beck lecture? Implicitly and\nexplicitly, the legacy of Auschwitz forms the historical framework for the process of\nacquiring a new national self-concept?",

        "Q: So tell me what this means. Why is this so necessary for it -- for a new self national -- a\nn-national self-confidence?",
        "A: You know we had a national indifference in Germany at the time, and the nation stayed\ntraditional 19\" century, almost disappeared. If you talk to the kids today about Bismarck,\nthey don\u2019t know who he is, you know, and if you talk about students in the war area,\nabout the French scoo occupations, and they ask whether that\u2019s in the 17\" century, or in\nthe [indecipherable]. That\u2019s got national history in a traditional sense, 1n Germany has, in\na way, faded out among the next generations. And there 1s, I think, growing a new\nnational identity, which looks more at the chain of events, starting in the Third Reich,\nleading to the second World War, and the Holocaust, and certainly then, being in the\nbackground for the formation of the [indecipherable] republic. That\u2019s rit -- quite a\ndifferent side of historical basic facts, which have -- they have in mind, and to which I\nthink the experience of Auschwitz belongs, in a way, you know?",

        "A: Well, [indecipherable] books on that, d\u2019you ever read them? You know, and I found it\nvery interesting, the -- the recent book by Ted Hurwitz his name, on the -- on the\nmiterzation of the Holocaust, you know, and he brings that interpretation that they want\nto put a positive meaning by stressing the Americans as liberators, and so on, in\ncomparison to what is going on 1n wa -- Yad Vashem, you know. Well, from a German\nviewpoint, that is -- that\u2019s not very convincing. And I -- I always told that story that a\nGermans wanted to have a room for the resistance movement, but unfortunately that is\ntoo anti-Semitic [indecipherable] to wage that -- at --idea, you know, but that was very\nsymptomatic. But we don\u2019t have the possibility to connect the -- that, even to bend with\nsome sort of suppositive national tradition, you know. That\u2019s it\u2019s -- has to do with what I\ntold you about, the emergence of a new consciousness. We just can\u2019t [indecipherable]. At\nleast the other Germany resistance no -- we have done five people, or 50, that\u2019s not\nenough, you know. It\u2019s not representative. And then so far, sh -- from a German\nviewpoint, you look at that as certainly a bit skeptically with all the politish and nutson\nwent on the attendance to -- to have some general consequential slogans, or what do you\nsay, you know. We are far more skeptical as -- us Germans who went through that\nexperience. But anyhow, it\u2019s a very impressive exhibition, and is a -- is a very, very good\nand interesting material, 1n many respects, but it would be [indecipherable] to say that a\nmost impressive place is where you have the pictures of that little town, what\u2019s the name?",

In order to get into that, and oh -- he\ntook the twins, and by that, it looked that way, he [indecipherable] but we all the time,\nasked him, \u201cFather, why doesn\u2019t the firefighters come?\u201d And he said, \u201cPsst, psst, psst.\u201d\nAnd I remember the scenery, and certainly the thing which is interesting then, for the\nhistorian, 1s that there was no public people, there was only the SA. It was certainly not as\nGoebbels had tried to let it appear, as a riot of the German people, it was just only the --\nthe Nazi activists, and the others didn\u2019t have any access to the place.",
        "A: No, we go -- we went to the -- the adjacent building, we knew that way well, you know --",
        "A: Because he got exception. No, that was nearby, nearb --",
        "A: Not -- Not random, oh, I don\u2019t know, maybe. You know, but I remember it only --\nrecollect it only because of the fact that the father has such strange answers.",
        "A: That was it.",
        "A: No, wouldn\u2019t talk about that.",
        "A: Yep. We got the feeling that he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. He wouldn\u2019t talk about any\npolitics at home. Certainly he had some contact to some representatives to the resistance\nmovement, with one of the advisors of William Loishner, the [indecipherable] board visit\nhim regularly. And we got aware only of the fact that he left the house, he didn\u2019t receive\nth -- him in the house, and -- and everything was very secret, and -- and by that th-the\nkids got afraid there was something happening, and in [indecipherable] that was his\nconduct. And once, you know, I just picked up a sentence that was quite symptomatic, in\nGerman, that ronteheron in Berlin with an auchnie pas etou and so on. That means the\npeople in the ministry down there wouldn\u2019t do either, you know. And certainly that\nreflected the situation as the German resistance, that they couldn\u2019t, in a way, use the\ngovernmental institutions to raise a resistance, because everything was Nazified, or -- or\nthe administration was without any influence because the Nazi party had a -- a -- a\nbypass, or surpass them. That was the situation, but this is also a later [indecipherable]\nand a potential.",
        "A: And the other thing I remember were the -- two things I remember o-of the Nazi period.\nOne is that it has a vidi -- visit of the famous historian, Freidich Meineker, who was\nknown for his distance precision versus the Nazi regime. But he visited us in the summer\nof 1941. Then the German troops had conquered the Aprole, that was highest mountain in\nthe Carpathors. And after Meineker had left, Sunday the father said, \u201cEe, Meineker\u2019s\nproud of that.\u201d We couldn\u2019t get to that, you know. But cernly all the money was owned in\nsome respects, nationalist that -- although he criticized the regime, on the other hand, he\nwas proud of the merit of the German troops, while my father, as an also World War One\nofficer, all the time was deeply skeptical of what was going on in the Soviet Union,\nbecause he could not believe that this would end other than in a defeat.",
        "A: He was a member of the party, he was --",
        "A: -- in 1940, he got a -- the -- the pressure of the district leader Karvitski that he should end\nthe party, and then he was taken into the party, but pre-dated to 1937, but he, in a way, he\ncame very late to the party. But you know, the party membership, as such, hasn\u2019t much\nmeaning about what the people really thought of. And we have a lot of nominal members\nin that time. He had some problem, because he was a liberal historian, in the one paid he\nwas a democrat, and in the -- 1943, he suddenly got some pressure that he would have to\nleave that university and -- and it was very difficult round then, there were somehow\npeople in the education ministry in Berlin, who helped him, by that he could preserve his\nchair. But he lost the periodical he was editing and he -- his -- it was a ri -- way\npolitically minored, and he would have liktus every day of that, everything was gone, and\nby that, he was in a bit di-difficult position, but he tried to adapt himself to a certain\nextent. Certainly that is what raise him to manifold that group who was not really\nconservative. And er -- which on the other hand, you know, lost the confidence in the\nrestoration, or the continuation of the parliamentary democ -- democratic system. There\nwas some disorientation. Certainly, he was strongly directed against the prevailing\ntendency of the so called Reich mythology, and he still was very strong in pressing for\nthe importance of the Bismark 1n tradition, so that that was a little bit directed against the\ngreat German tendencies. And so far he had a peculiar position, but he was -- he was not\nreally a member of the opposition. He was in the midst between the camps, I think. And\nin a way he also had to fear that he got political pressure again, as it happened then, in\n1944, I\u2019ll never forget then the famous Gunter Franzel was the historian for the peasants\nwho were in the Third Reich, came from Strassburg. Strassburg had been lost, and now\nwe were sitting at Marburg. So they had, years ago, a while been SS, and now my\nfather\u2019s and -- said that he was just as helm, and I -- I never forget that the father was\nway, way for -- fearful that they wanted to get his chair. It looked like they had, you\nknow. And then I met the same Franzel five months later, after the break down of the\nregime, you know, in another uniform, and a -- the way, free, different type, you know\nthere you see the change. I never forgot that, you know. And so far, I think the position of\nmy father\u2019s was a bit precarious, but he was now a hero.",
        "A: Well, my o-oldest brother, certainly he was brought into the army with 18, and then he\nserved all the time, first in -- in the eastern front, and then in Africa, but he -- fortunately\nhe didn\u2019t get to northern Africa because there end of the main -- because then -- there was\neverything finished. And then he went back to the Soviet Union, and he survived in a way\nbecause he -- in April 1947, fled, and swam through the er -- Oude river in order to get\ninto the hands of the Americans. That was that story. So the -- he had the pressure o --\nyou know, of being all the time a soldier at the front, and he was also ma -- sa -- two\ntimes wounded, and so on. That way, typical war -- war age cahount.",
        "A: And the younger one, he went in -- first was what you call in German fleckhaffer, that\nmeans he had to -- to serve as a suen in the entire air company, and then later on, he also\ngot soldier, and -- but he was younger, and in a way -- he didn\u2019t get to the Soviet Union,\nbut to France. And you know, that\u2019s a really strange story, because when he went back to\nSchlevig Kolchda, that\u2019s in the north of Germany, that was a region where still the great\nAdmiral Doernitz had his _ . And there they dwell for two or three weeks, they preserved\nas independent military units, and what is fairly not known, that they had that, what one\ncalls in German, Ate tu exetsianser. Exercise the great thing, Heil Doenitz. You know\nthat Doenitz wanted to continue, instead of having the Heil Hitler, they now should use a\nHeil Doenitz, and that was -- is almost unbelievable. And then he came home with\neverything one wanted to have, because I know there was a lot of foot stuff. And\n[indecipherable] over there at that time, while the other came in American -- ga --\ncustody.",
        "A: But it\u2019s strange, you know, the school was called Adolf Hitler school.",
        "A: Got the name after 1933. About the time I take -- round that gymnasium -- in Germany\nwe'd say gymnasium, that was the second day of school, you know. It was one of the --\nnot of the old k -- gymnasium, which have Latin and Greek in the center of the lessons,\nbut they had modern languages, that was something, and mod -- more modern type of the\nGerman secondary school. And the -- the man who was running that, the director, he was\ndefinitely non -- a non-Nazi, that\u2019s quite clear. And he tried to avoid too much in\nindoctrination in that time. And I have the personal experience, I always warn people to\noverestimate the decree of ideological indoctrination a -- during the Nazi period. You\nknow, that was very strong in the years after 1935, but later on, it was really German,\nNationalists certainly, 1t was -- it was not liberal, it was not democratic. But I can\u2019t\nremember that there was any talk about -- about race, and racial ideology or so -- th-that\nwould play a big role, and I remember it in the later war years, we had then a specific\nNazi teacher, who came with a brown uniform, and so we had a [indecipherable] start,\nyou know. It was not a -- the experience which then occurred after, in 1944. It\u2019s because\nthey had the same men, and also after [indecipherable] and they had a way bad life, you\ncan -- and that was, you know, not a serious type, he was way d -- he was, I think, really\ndifferent from the other professors, you know? And it -- so far, I can\u2019t remember that\nthere was a specific Nazi indoctrination in the school. Certainly some, you know, and\nwell, you would have the -- the typical school pil -- festivals or something, but I can\u2019t\nremember that we were sitting together to listen to the Hitler speech or something. Maybe\nthat happened, but it was not very significant, I think. And as a historian, I add on the\ncommentary, that after 1935, Goebbels in the way, certainly the propaganda on the one\nhand was very rapidly and tr -- especially in the Jewish case, but there was also some\ndeportization of the whole system be -- if the citizens remained loyal, everything was not\n-- and -- and so far, I think the school was not too much Nazified. And there was not too\nmuch change after -- in the teacher staff, after 1945, and certainly in 1944, we got a little\nbit more aware of the politic conditions and so on, but there was not much talk, and every\nf -- thing -- you had to be very busy all the time, and certainly we are -- spent every\nSunday to have collecting this or that in the service, or the Deutsch yungfolk, the youth\norganization of the hi -- of the Hitler youth, or later on even in the Hitler youth. I th -- I\nthink, well usually when people think the whole time is a time of interconnection, it\u2019s not\nso much. At least I didn\u2019t understand anything about the Jewish question before the war\nwas over, then I learned a little bit about it before the -- I was very naive in that way, you\nknow. So they -- we -- the difference was that the father wouldn\u2019t talk about politics at\nall, you know?",
        "A: And that\u2019s what I have to say to the school.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Se-Serious school teachers wouldn\u2019t use that.",
        "A: But that\u2019s a problem you know where 1-it\u2019s a -- now, and there\u2019s a lot of tendency in the\nresearch to start it at -- but when should we weigh causes, you know. These things were\nvery tedious. I can only tell my experience with it --",
        "A: -- with the Deutsch yungfolk, you know, so the --",
        "A: We had to go into the Deutsch yungfolk when we were 10, and I was in the Deutsch\nyungfolk from the age of 10 to the age of 14. And so that we were living in specifics\nquarter at Marburg, and there was something like the academic elite there, but that our --\nour [indecipherable] some unit of the yungfolk, you know, had a lot of intellectuals, and\nyou know, it\u2019s quite good. We had a library and I wa -- the -- Wolfgang, my twin brother\nand I, had to run the library, the fanela library, and had a lot of books, but you know,\nwhat did it guys lend out. So they lend out calimai, and technical literature. There\u2019s no\nuniversum literature dealing with a technical future, and something like that. They\nwouldn\u2019t read anything which is related to Nazi ideology, that was quite symptomatic.\nAnd you know, if you have to run a -- a youth group, you know, and you have to take one\nevening in the week, you know, which should -- what the Germans call that heimarm,\nthat means, I have some program, you know. The pr -- The Nazi ideology is very poor,\nand after awhile it\u2019s very difficult to do something, and by that, you know, it was a little\nbit, you know, they had very different topics, but in Farenow, the specific ideological\nissues were not debated very much. So the e -- went -- there was criticism against it, but it\nwasn\u2019t -- it -- it was not so much in the minds, I think, of the people as -- from the -- from\nhindsight, one per -- would believe, if he looks at the specific literature. And I want to\nadd one experience that then, in 1944, late in 1944, we were assembled and to be taken\nover to the Hitler youth, that is the organization of the 14 to 18 old boys, and they had to\nswear the oath on Adolf Hitler. It -- The whole thing happened within the inner circle of\nthe marble castle. And there were about 1200 boys, and we\u2019re way much packed. But the\nwhole thing was a little bits disturbed, because there were two lightnings, and there was -\n- we -- we -- we would have preferred to go, you know, in it so far. In 1944 there was no\nmuch chance to indoctrinate people any longer. And -- But that\u2019s on -- all of my\nexperience I had.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s ish -- they were -- just to -- in the middle of that, you know. And do you\nknow what was the problem with only if you wanted to -- to decide for assistance and --\nthere was some identity between the nation and the personality of Hitler, it was quite\ndifficult for -- for I think ordinary people, you know, where you can say -- members of\nthe elite, that\u2019s different, or Conservatives, or even Communists, that\u2019s different. But the\nordinary people, what should they do, just you know, the -- the -- the -- the gentleman,\ntentative was, they criticize all the time the regime, and Goebbels and Himmler, and\neverybody, but would exempt Hitler from that. So they had a split consciousness, and you\nhave that famous sentence, \u201cVen dusta fuhrer wusta,\u201d \u201cIf Hitler would know that, then it\nwouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d you know. And certainly that was a psychological mechanism,\nbecause you can\u2019t easily revolt against your own nation. And so far, Hitler was taken\nfrom out of that criticism, while certainly all the soldiers would say, after the war, then\nwe will change the regime. And that was the other side of the other interrogations of\nGerman prisoners of war by the Americans. You know, we have a lot of material for that.\nYou see, I am not a very good eye witness, you know. A historian usually --",
        "A: -- reflects his own experience too much. No.",
        "A: Well, we had a good life because we are living a little town at Marburg. There was some\nair attacks, but not many. I never forget that I also was caring, and to help people, and if\nsomebody wouldn\u2019t have taken me and -- and -- and thrown me back, then I would have\nnot survived, and so on. And -- But in general, I think the conditions at Marburg were not\ntoo -- too bad, while certainly in the big cities, where you have the wide air raids, it must\nhave been very problematic, you know. And especially in the last ter -- months of the\nwar. I never forget when the Americans attacked the city of Giessen, that\u2019s just 30\nkilometers away. That was in the night at three. And we were -- had a house with a good\nlooking -- you could looks out a little bit on the -- on the hill. We could read on the\nbalcony.",

But he did not know that my older brother, before he came to\nthe -- to the entire air troop, together with his friend, had a telephone connection to that\nradio, and were sitting in a neighboring house, and listening to the BBC too, you know,\nwhich, as you can imagine, was very dangerous.

        "A: Historians make bad witness because they put everything only the -- in history in\nperspective, and what you need 1s -- and what a historian needs if he is working with\nhistorical witnesses, that they just recollect immediately, which I hadn -- you have to get\nthem bef -- and we have the re -- in the situation, to ask them the first time. And I am --\nso a little bit ca -- or we could -- you can say afterwards, you have to shoot them, because\nit\u2019s quite clear that they would change an opinion, and have a -- you know, th -- that\nexperience with the expiration of a ristock fire, where all the witnesses would change\ntheir opinion if they were in favor of a Communist, or of a National Socialist background,\ndoesn\u2019t matter. The witness who told in 1933 that and that, they would tell them the\nopposite in -- after 1945, and the -- the other way around. It\u2019s very interesting, and I -- I\nhad a way -- it was we -- when I had to study on the Volkswagen company in the Third\nReich, and I had a good contact to the former -- former man of the management, who was\nresponsible for the accunt -- commercial ex -- aspects. And I asked him, why are they put\nin Jewesses in the work to do to -- could use some pasokas because that was certainly not\nvery important, and especially -- certainly they -- it was now pr-profiteering motivation\n[indecipherable] you know. First he immediately sa -- spontaneously answered, \u201cBecause\nwe had to fill the capacity.\u201d A week later, or two, he called me and said he wanted talk\nabout me, and now he added [indecipherable] of second day liberations, why that was\nthere, but he never had reflected that the most interesting thing is when the -- th -- over\n50 years, never had reflected that the occupied Jewish concentration camp inmates in the\nc-company. You know that, I think, was the most interesting. And then he got the original\nmotive, that he didn\u2019t think that it just put in whom they got, in order to fill the capacity,\nnot to lose anything of the capacity for -- well, possibly a later peace production. It was\nSO primitive, that was it. This is one of the cases where I got him at a situation where he\ndidn\u2019t reflect it, and then he told the truth.",

And also, what my personal situation was concerned, I didn\u2019t know\nwhether the -- whether we would continue the secondary school, then I didn\u2019t know\nwhether there would be a chance to go to the university. There was, in a way, everything\nbroke down, and I think that left an imprint on that generation, and those -- are those age\ncohorts, who -- who went through that situation of this extreme disorientation I think\nthey are different from the next ones, who haven\u2019t, I don\u2019t think, gone through that.

Some of these guys in\nmy hired entourage, they thought that this couldn\u2019t be -- couldn\u2019t be really real, and by\nthat they changed that you know, that\u2019s certainly exceptional. But that also shows -- show\nnow, as a historian, I\u2019ve learned that, you know, people do not reflect too much the\n[indecipherable]. If they would, you know, the main problem of the Third Reich is that\nthe Third Reich was successful in preventing the people to have any time and leisure, in\norder to reflect. If they would have had the possibility, then I think that -- I think the\nwhole thing would be proten down.",
        "A: Well, it was not so much on purpose, but it was a -- was a mentality of the party. You\nknow, if you have such an organization which relies on continuous dynamics, you know,\nand they have a feeling, if there is no longer any dynamic, then there\u2019s nothing left, you\nknow. And I run all this theory that there is a -- a connection between the Munich\nagreement, which meant that Hitler couldn\u2019t have his little war against Besarakia, and the\nparty we have forgotten, stood on alert all the time, well -- because they just thought they\nwould have a per -- a permanent role in the war later on, that it was dropped anyhow.\nAnd the Reich\u2019s Crystal Night. Because, exactly at a moment then, the German people\nbelieve now we c -- got a bit more quiet situation, and the peace is -- is rescued and so on.\nThen it\u2019s like a logical reaction of the party, was to push the Jewish question ahead.",

And then -- then they -- you know, their\nunrest, their inability to -- to wait, or something like that, could use a certainly dynamics,\nand the steady mobilization, and it -- so far, I think 1t wasn\u2019t a -- a deliberate policy, but it\nwas a specific political style they had only learned in the 20\u2019s. That would be my theory.",
        "A: Yes, he -- he -- he had some --",
        "A: -- problems because -- well, that is a very difficult story. First of all, he had -- he had\nsome problem because he had American students, and one of them was a man who was in\nthe headquarters of Eisenhower, and he got the unfortunate -- unfortunate idea to ask him\nwhether he should take the position of Minister of cultures in -- in the -- the land of\nHessia, because it was a reformer of the university system in the 20\u2019s and the\n[indecipherable], all the colleagues did everything to get him out of that, but that also put\nso much [indecipherable]. Then there was an American CID officer, he is still existing,\nhe is politic -- political scientist in California. He ist -- came from Vienna, and you won\u2019t\nbelieve it, he wanted to press my father to support ESED. He was a leftist. And after my\nfather declined, then he wrote a terrible expertise on him, and that dis-destroyed his\ncareer. He was losing his office, he had problems with the de-Nazification o -- although\nat the end he -- he was acquitted, but it took him like a couple of years, and so that -- that\naffected the kids, because all of the years he didn\u2019t have any income. So now you take a\nfamily from a upper, bourgeois class, with that background, and suddenly there is no\nmoney at all. It was very difficult for them. It was difficult for us, too. Later on, it -- that\nwasn\u2019t so -- so important. But if that -- if Major Dorn wouldn\u2019t have that wonderful idea,\nyou know, it would have been better for the family.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t lose our house, but well, it was -- it was very, very difficult, and certainly\nwe -- we Sold everything what we could, and so on, and Fritz, that was the older brother,\nhe was able to -- to use a black market, and so on, and somehow that worked, but only\nsomehow, it was very hard time. And I think it wasn\u2019t just -- it was really bad. And now\nwith that becomes a little bit known, because people are doing some research on the\nMarburg University, it\u2019s very interesting. Well, it\u2019s interesting sa -- that case, you know,\nbecause most all these people, all these professors, [indecipherable] officers, only very,\nvery few were thrown out, but in this case, it was very bitter. But that was -- well, for me\nit was very interesting then, and Major Dorn came and then what\u2019s her name, other man\nwho runs for many years, he asked me [indecipherable] Berlin. Had a moment, forget a\nname, also. You know, I never forget a -- suddenly there comes in an American officer,\nfirst ttme I see an American officer in uniform in so on, 1t was very impressive.

        "A: Well, we -- we would study many -- in two fields, or two and a half fields in Germany,\nand did Communistic, and as a second field, history, and at first I was at Marburg, and\nthe only field in history which was interesting, was Medieval history, and certainly\nmodern history was also there. The Fritz Wagner, whom I didn\u2019t like very much, as you\ncan imagine -- although I had examinations with him, I\u2019ll never forget it, because he was\nreally fearful, you know. In a way he didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t want to make blunders in the\nexamination. Now -- And by that I -- I got a Medievalist, and then I made my exam there.\nI wrote a examination paper, which I deft -- I think quite interesting besides, on the\ndevelopment of the region in the west of the Rhine, which is to ca -- today called the\nnaicowanda. But that didn\u2019t fit into the theories of my professor, and he gave me only a B\nminus. And I decided then I\u2019Il leave that, and go to teebing, to Hans Rodefass, about that\nI went back to contemporary history, and certainly to the Tside cacheefta\nessensasencherm. That means the history of National Socialism, although I did my\ndissertation work on the nationality problem in the Hapsburg monarchy, and the period\nbetween 18 -- 1867 and 1907, which was quite interesting, and certainly had a lot to do\nwith the German Czech relations at that time.",

        "A: Well, as a youngster, you wouldn\u2019t notice so much, and we were not polit -- very\npolitical. And if you are living in a situation where -- no-nobody would talk about that,\nthen certainly some naivet\u00e9 is arising. I told that I d-didn\u2019t know what Jews are, what\nJewish life is, that in the post-war years there, it took me awhile to realize not only that\nthere was the Holocaust, and the Jewish persecution, that was easy, but -- but that Jews\nwere interesting individuals, you know, because you have to -- we\u2019re living in a German\nlittle town, Jews would d-disappear from the city, you wouldn\u2019t know who they -- where\nthey -- wh-where are Jews, and even those Jews who lived there we-were not discernible,\nand were the -- they would cut all communications to the so-called Aryan population. By\nthat, if you grow up as a kid, Jews didn't have any arriello -- idea of what that -- that was,\nyou know. And certainly I was told that we were su-surviving as a -- as a -- babies,\nbecause of a Jewish professor, who was a junior colleggest -- trolegest, and knew what to\ndo with early birds, and so on, and we knew that there was a lot of Jewish colleagues, and\nthe father told us about that, but you know, that was no all reality of the Jews -- y-you\ndidn\u2019t know much about that. I think that was very symptomatic for my age cohorder,\nyeah. And that they certainly were told in the Hitler youth, there was a Jewish question\nsomething, in Moscow, or somewhere, but they never realized that it\u2019s our Jews.\nCertainly those people who were with the olderunder -- really understood what was going\non inorise Crystal Night, and so on. They must have realized that, you know. That -- But\nthat is also part of what I -- I mentioned earlier, of that incremental depolitization.",

        "A: Well, I decided on the one hand because we were influenced by Hans Roadface, who was\nrunning the -- the leading periodical, and also after I ta -- finished my Ph.D. there, I went\ninto the Institute Ratied Catcheechta, that means the leading institute for contemporary\nhistory, in Munich. And certainly wat -- and I was primary -- primarily in that business.\nBut think that\u2019s not all, but it\u2019s very symptomatic for our -- our ca -- generation that they\njust we -- were preoccupied to learn why the father generation had accepted the rule o-of\nAdolf Hitler you know, that was -- was a pressing issue, and therefore, many of my\nfellow students would also deal with -- especially the Wimayears, in order to understand\nthe seizure of power later on, then we would enter also the second phase of the regime,\nafter 1934, and studied that. That is, I think a typical process. And the following\ngeneration then, would look into 19\" century. What are the basic reasons for the German\nway -- for the deformation of German politics. That was when, signified by the so-called\nBeedafeld school.",
        "A: Well, the deka -- a lot of demarcation lines. In our first [indecipherable] you know, in the\nearly post-war, those people who dealt with that, even in journalism, or 1-in history,\ncertainly professional historians had a apprehension against -- to doing contemporary\nhistory, they did that on account of some sort epilaga -- epilagactic position, you know.\nAnd then they have the dichotomy between the SS state on the one hand, you know, the\nsuppression, the police state, the apparatus, and on the other hand the German resistance,\nwhich we call the other Germany, and in the midst were also some people, but you know,\nthis tule -- this picture was a way [indecipherable] one. And that was mixed then with the\nfear of totalitarian dictatorship, and the idea of the molithic structure of the regime, and\nthe predominant role of Adolf Hitler. That was the old position, which I think was\nprevailing in through the middle -- into the end of the 60\u2019s. Now there happened one\nchange that the American government returned the captured German files in 1967. And\nour generation of [indecipherable] had the first time the opportunity to look really into the\nfiles, and not only in the selected documents, which we are typical for the Nuremberg\ntrials, or living from memoirs of contemporaries and witnesses. We looked into the files,\nand we got a very different picture than that of the monolithic state, and so all the\ncontradiction within a system, and that\u2019s why the -- but then developed it -- a quite\ndifferent understanding of how the regime functioned then. For instance, Hans Roadface\nor Caldidish baha [indecipherable] older generation. And they also -- the so-called\nFunctionalist school emerged. I belonged to the Functionalist school. I would certainly\npoint it out that it -- it not sufficient only to look at the ideology on the one hand, and to --\nto say that Hitler wrote his program down in the Mein Kampf, and then everything\nhappened like that, it\u2019s nonsense. And that is also a apologetic element, just to put Hitler\nin the foreground all the time, because -- and our function was to show that the\nresponsibility of what had happened, had to be put on broader sco -- shoulders, and that\nwas, over there, some mechanisms of the -- the one hand, the -- the style of politics, and\nthe perception of politics, which was specific Fascist, and a specific structure, which put\nJews then what I call cumulative radicalization, which may explain the proceedings, or\nthe -- the way Nazi policy took, and t -- that can be especially, I think shown with respect\nto the Jewish persecution.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I know that, you know --",
        "A: -- and especially the Israelis, because certainly the Israelis also have that -- that\n[indecipherable] reason for that one-ness that the -- the Israelian historiography has been\ndeveloped by German professors who were mainly representatives of the history of ideas.\nThat has been continued by men like Talman, and the others, I know them, you know?\nAnd certainly also the background of the Jewish religion is very favored for history of\nideas, you know. But that, yeah they have still today, problems to -- to do a simple social\nhistory. But mainly they are -- they are working in history of ideas. Therefore, they have\none bias in that direction. Secondly, you know, the strong connection between notion of\nthe creation of the state of Israel, and the role anti-Semitism stands in the background.\nAnd so had sa -- the survivors, they have problems, I can understand that, to -- to accept\nwhat already was a conflict with Hana-ah, and to accept the trivial elements in that\npolicy. It\u2019s very, very comprehensible that they don\u2019t want to have these very trivial\nelements as elements of explanation, and -- and so forth, the Functionalists have a\ndifficult time if they talk to those people. Although we say one can\u2019t explain everything\nwhere the ideological factor, or the personal factor Hitler, and they have to put in that\nelement of bureaucratic competition, and so on, and no -- but you know the whole --\nwhole controversy between Functionalists and Intentionalists is coming to an end, you\nknow. Eruda Bower says that, and -- and sometimes Karl Hiberg would say that he is a\nStructuralist, and -- and what Chris Browning did in writing the [indecipherable] 101, he\nsuddenly got a -- got a notion that it wouldn\u2019t work with the Intentionalist explanation,\nwhich he originally had, you know, I never forgot, and that was [indecipherable] debate\nwith them, you know. At that time, he was in another camp. But today, most of the\nresearchers in a way of taking up our Functionalist -- Functionalist elements of\nexplanation, and everybody gets aware that Hitler was not a man who was -- had -- had\nthat [indecipherable] personality, you know, that this was a merth, and that things are\neven more -- were even worse, because there are many people who -- who pushed the\nprocess, I think, atafond, and certainly this viewpoint increases a responsibility, and a\nmoral responsibility of the nation, versus a specific Nazi perpetrators, you know. And my\ngeneration, we fought against that position, that there are only very few people besides of\nHimmler, and [indecipherable] Hitler, that they -- seduced, is the term. For fear they\nseduced the German nation, you know. That was your -- the main argument. And we\nstarted to -- just to get rid of that crazy idea, I wanted to show how that could happen, I\ncertainly -- that was, and still is our question, how could that happen? And certainly I\nwould argue then -- your argument -- I can\u2019t go to the next generation and say there was\nsome stupid, crazy individual called Adolf Hitler, that\u2019s why they killed five million\nJews. I don\u2019t think that this is sufficient. It seems to be real plausible, but then it\u2019s not\nplausible by -- because why could one man do that? And so on, we\u2019re -- in a way we have\nto describe the background on which Hitler could then have that function. And so far, I\nthink in the fear -- the misunderstanding of both fronts, I think have overcome. There\u2019s\njust the next polarization between younger historians who want -- who would go back to\nsome ideological explanation, said as Uri Shalbud, and the other ones who were some\nexperience and say, well, you will have the same development as we had at -- that he\noriginally stud-studied all the time, the Nazi [indecipherable] longer, and we got a idea\nthat it\u2019s not so important. Certainly there was a basic anti-Jewish resentment, no question,\nbut that there had been other mechanisms we share, what then may explain the perversion\nof a civilicized nation into a -- a apparatus of criminals, and that is still the problem.",
        "A: That\u2019s okay, but you know, there is some difference. You know, the terms have been\ncoined by Jim Mason at a conference near Lornan many years ago, when there was -- was\na clear cut, I think, distinction of the -- of the explanation between something like a\nhistory of ideas, and something like social history, that\u2019s different, you know? And so far,\nthat was also related to the explanation of the field, and certainly the whole metalogical\ndifference wouldn\u2019t play such a big role if they wa-wouldn\u2019t have been loden with some\nrole -- with some moral legacies, you know. Because the Germans need a strong Hitler,\nbecause if Hitler would be weak, they can\u2019t [indecipherable]. I never forgot that famous\nLouden conference, where there was a discussion where Hitler could preserve his rule for\nso long, it was very long, in a way, while he was -- I coined that formula, in some\nrespects, a weak dictator.",
        "A: And certainly I wasn\u2019t tact all the time, because u -- I always thought I would defend\nHitler, I didn\u2019t want to -- want to, but turn out that with the -- that the emotional element,\nthat was very symptomatic, and then I said, really, look, if you have a dictatorship, then\nit\u2019s really likely that perseveres. Take Idi Amin. Oh, I was already wint by that, because\nthat violated the chair of national pride. We want to have a strong Hitler, not Idi Amin,\nnow that -- that shouldn\u2019t be done, you know. That\u2019s a basic background, all that, and to\nunderstand that, one has to come back to what we talked about, where the Germans\nwould take the personality of Hitler out of the responsibility of the crimes and decay,\nbecause they preverse them -- pre-preserve them something like icon for their national\nidentity. Now, in 1945, they certainly got aware that this was wrong. And not -- now the\nemotion turned against Hitler.",
        "A: And if then somebody like Hans Mommsen [indecipherable] the other week in Germany,\nHitler was not only the subject, but also the object of politics. You get immediately a very\nangry criticisms, even by -- by very good historians. Karl Dietrich baha -- he immediately\nwrote and said, \u201cHow can you say that Hitler\u2019s objects are [indecipherable]. Well, why\nnot, you know. If you talk that -- If you talk about that in England or America, it\u2019s not so\ndifficult, be -- but there is a -- apologetic element, the emotional elements, which I think\nare guided the debate, and also the research. And that\u2019s why we have that -- that\u2019s not\nonly a metalogic distinction, or dim -- different starting point, but they had then this\ncontroversy between Functionalists and Intentionalists. That is certainly gone with the\nnext generation, which doesn\u2019t have that necessity to defend in a way, indirectly, the\nGermans [indecipherable] pointing out the manipulative character of Nazi dictatorship\nand all that. But they needed, in order to believe that they had been seduced. Certainly the\nopposite was true, they made Hitler, they in turn wanted to use him certainly then Hitler\nused them, you know, but that still proves with which certainly they -- nobody would\nreject them outright, but th-they are not very convenient. And then so far, I think I am\nstill not too old fashioned [indecipherable] an old historian, you know. The next\ngeneration certainly doesn\u2019t have that problem. They don\u2019t see also this specific\nconstellation under which we developing contemporary history.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, you know, there was a Sherman Oaks, one of the leading English experts in the\nfield, and he talked about the re-organization of the party in 1932, in December 1932,\nimmediately before the seizure of power, and he then said that from then on, they had 37\ndifferent territories, with a rather independent Gauleiter, and so far, as they can do what\nthey want. And you know, the problem is -- is not coordination within the system.\nEverybody can act, everybody can make initiatives and so on, as far as that stays, as they\naccept the authority, or the prestige abi -- Adolf Hitler. And the thing we have to do with\nthe specific style of Nazi politics -- it\u2019s very difficult, especially for a European say,\nAmericans are better, to understand this regime, which doesn\u2019t have any institutionalized\ngovernmental board, or some representation. But after 1937, we don\u2019t have a cabinet,\nthere is no political discourse between the different ministries. We don\u2019t have that on the\nparty side either. There is nothing which would integrate diverging political interests, in\nsa -- in the -- the very diverging politic interests are then -- are brought to conflict or not,\nis by personal feuds. That\u2019s the reason why everybody among the Nazi regime hates the\nothers. And some of the later Gauleiter would say if Hitler -- Himmler comes into my\nterritory, my gow, I will imprison him, you know. They hated -- They hated each other,\nyou know. And the whole system is built on that -- watha -- non-structure. At the same\ntime, you have a system of non-communication. If you were in the high position of that\nregime, let\u2019s say you are the secretary of state in your [indecipherable]. You know\nsomething, but you don\u2019t know everything. The case of Mr. Kritchinger, who was a -- a\nmember of the confessor -- confessing church, but he -- he was present at the Wannsee\nconference. Was really took -- Because he didn\u2019t get a clear cut picture of the Holocaust\nbefore, I think the middle of 1942. And then he wanted to get dismissed, and the lama\nsaid, \u201cNo, no, stay. It would be better if you stay here,\u201d you know. And there was a\nsystematic non-communication. In the newspaper, you wouldn\u2019t get the necessary\ninformation of what was really going on, and then there was the so-called\nshtimmelsburchter report of the securities service, made by -- these so -- should in a way\nreplace them -- lack of information for the leading functionaries within this history -- s --\nwithin the system. But after they became inconvenient, because of too many inconvenient\ntrusay they also were no longer permitted. Where did you get information from? It\u2019s very\neasy to read today the d-diary of Goebbels, and you see that even Goebbels, who is at a\n[indecipherable] sometimes at a [indecipherable] the system, because they\u2019re changed all\nthe time, he isn\u2019t very well informed about important ada -- aspects of politics. And that\nis a -- cer -- specific nature of that regime. And we have th -- we have also a travelma, to\nprove who was then really responsible for the onicol, because that happened, and there\nwas no precise mechanism. And you know, I point that out, no-not only -- not to say that\npeople were not responsible for what they were doing, you know, but to explain why\nthere was no opposition, you know. And it -- In the question of the Holocaust, there could\nhave been opposition on the side of the army, or other groups, not because they were not\nanti-Jewish, I wouldn\u2019t say that, but because of th -- the ta -- c-competing interests,\nbecause Jews the -- a certain amount of -- of manpower and resources in order to do the --\nthe Holocaust. Cosponick has shown that in 1943, they had 300 men just to liquidate\nJews in the east -- and the whole army at that time has only 1,000,800. You know? But\nunder those specific ambivalent condition, where you didn\u2019t have any institutional set of\npolitics, then something like Holocaust could occur. That\u2019s a tatrol out of the analysis,\nand I\u2019ve had this also a conclusion which may have -- be some importance for future\nevents, because genocidal acts usually would come into being, if there is no clear cut\ncommand structure, not the other way around. If we look at Vietnam, we know that we\nwill -- certainly that could be it -- not -- no comparable level, but you know, certainly, if\nwe look at the Holocaust, we also look helpul existence are like, which would then be a --\nable to be per-perverted in that direction, that there is no protest against the destruction of\nall the foundations of law, and destruction of all the radius, which is certainly\naccompanying the implementation of the Holocaust, according to my conviction.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: There is certainly -- well, that\u2019s -- the long run, they got accustomed to get rid of the\nJews, and suddenly they learned, under the conditions of the occupied Soviet territory,\nwhere the recent study said a -- under certain conditions, then certainly then, see that it\u2019s\npossible, that it\u2019s the easiest thing just to kill those people. First, before that, they want to\nhave some reservations, solutions, that turn out to be impossible, and so on, and at the\nend it was for them, the easy d -- way, to kill the Jews. And after they had started with\nthat, then certainly the German bureaucratic perfectionism got into the business, and then\nthey had the systematic liquidation of every Jewish women and kids which they could\nfind in Ukraine, or elsewhere. You know, that is really in -- that is -- well, impresses me a\nlot, and well there you have then the marriage between Nazi fanatism, and Prussian state\ntradition, and this terrible affect -- affectivity of the Germans. Other nations would have\njust said, well that in -- why -- we -- we -- th-that -- that\u2019s not interesting for us. But the\nGermans, and the way they are on a problem, then they do that up to the way and -- and\nthey hold icemen so he shows that that 1s still -- that business of killing the Hungarian\nJews, after he had a counter order, obviously a counter order by Himmler, you know,\nthat\u2019s very symptomatic for that process. And it -- so far, we have not only to do with\nanti-Semitic moderation, but also with attitudes which are things stemming from the\nPrussian state tradition, in a way. -- murdered Fromme, certainly.",
        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t overestimate the impact of national history on the process, but certainly\nthere is something like a -- a -- the -- well -- that has been called by -- from the\nauthoritarian character, and the authoritarian character plays a role, I think, f -- to fulfill\nthe expectation by the Nazis and by Hitler, you know, th-they then just did, and you can\nsee that with their example, the Reich\u2019s Crystal Night, and all the -- the German\npopulation protested way much against the violent acts in the night of the ninth of\nNovember already, and the eighth, and so on. But then the Gestapo gave the explicit\norder that they should take into custody 20, or 20 thous -- 25,000 Jews. That was a state\nmeasure, they accepted that, you know? This is a strange element. Law and order can\nwork under certain conditions. That they criticize the Nazi policy, but in -- then also can\nsupport Nazi policy. And in a way it did, especially if you look how they then proceeded\nin getting these European Jewry from the last isle in Greece, or elsewhere. You know, it\u2019s\nreally nonsense, nobody would have done that in the whole world. In that respect I think\nit\u2019s uniquely German. Maybe the Russians, and some people there have a -- have some\nheritage from Germany to do that in their day, if they start then to bring it to a -- toa -- I\nthink complete, and that\u2019s, I think one specific element. But, on the other hand, we\u2019re\nstarting to study what the French police did, and maybe they count a very depressing\nresults [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, I think it\u2019s gone -- it\u2019s -- everybody is of that opinion, because w -- you know, we\nknow more documents. We know that Hitler didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t -- he was a ideological motor\nall the time, especially in the Jewish question. But, on the other hand, he didn\u2019t always\npush things ahead, and now it turns out that also the Wannsee conference has to be\ninterpreted in a somewhat different context. The main problem of Heydrich, besides of\ngetting, or increasing his competence for the so-called Jewish question, was that he didn\u2019t\nwant to proceed with the Nuremberg laws, and hi -- difference between Jews and half\nJews, and Jews living in mixed marriages, you know, that very complicated system, to\ndistinguish between a more assimilated, and a less assimilating [indecipherable].\nBecause, certainly on the one hand, a party from the star wanted to include everybody\nwho was of Jewish descent, up to the quarter Jew, and to the -- all the first -- the\n[indecipherable] exclusion from Germany, and later on the liquidation. And the problem\narose that Hitler didn\u2019t want to change the Nuremberg laws, and he was not following the\nsuggestions of Heydrich, and Himmler, and the so-called mishling question, the -- the k --\nthe question of -- how do you say that in English?",
        "A: That means a half, quarter, and so on, Jews. And Heydrich invited the ministers to the\nWannsee conference, to decuss -- discuss that issue, and to get approval of the ministries,\nand the Reich chancellor, which were involved. In order then to press on Hitler, to get the\napproval to include the half Jews, and the Jews living in mixed marriages. And Hitler at\nthat point was a -- was something like a brake. Certainly motivation is very clear, he -- he\ndidn\u2019t change -- want to change in later years, anything, and he thought it terribly inp --\nunpopular if he would touch the assimilated Jews. And he was less strict in that issue than\nHeydrich, and Himmler and others. That gives to the Wannsee conference certainly, quite\nanew meaning, and Eichmann, who was expert on the mishlings question, that means the\nquestion of half and quarter Jews, he wanted to di -- let disappear his role. And by that,\nhe over -- he pointed at the ongoing liquidation in that famous speech delivered by\nHeydrich, wh -- and now -- by now we know very well that Heydrich had in mind what\nwas going on with the construction of that so-called rollbarn defore, that was a big street\nbetween Lublin and -- and Krakow. And from there he had a -- Jewish labor camps, and\nwhere he practized quote unquote, annihilation through labor, and that is then mentioned\nin this speech by Heydrich. Because 20 days later he would, in Prague, still talk about all\nthe deportation, all the 11,000,000 Jews -- European Jews, to the Icemeer region, where\nthe Gestapo wanted to have a -- it\u2019s own territory, and a continuing the archy period in\nthe gulag. You know, that was really simple. But in the ensuing weeks, suddenly\neverything changed, and then they did not he-hesitate then, to implement the systematic\nliquidation of the European Jews, but not so much at the Wannsee conference. And you\nknow, and so far, still the central part of that history, opened to different interpretations\nby now, but certainly that doesn\u2019t change anything in the very terrible development, and\nthe criminal character of that, but it makes it, I think, a bit more comprehensible. And\ncertainly the problem still is that -- that it\u2019s not only Hitler who is doing that, certainly\nhe\u2019s supporting that all the time. The discussion is to what extent Hitler was informed.\nCertainly I -- I wouldn\u2019t say that Hitler was not, but on the other hand, he didn\u2019t want to\nknow too much. And therefore, there was not too much discourse between the underlings\nand him, Hitler, as everybody assumed. But the -- obviously that was not necessarily the\ncase. Hitler was living in the ideological world, he all the time was characterized by a\nflight from reality, and he was not a man who looked at things day to day, you know.\nThat was a original position when I started that business of Nazi history. Well, is that\nsome sufficient explanation of your question?",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Yes --",
        "A: Well, at that time, this was very difficult to get anybody who was ready to talk about\nHannah Arant in Israel, and -- forget it. And also Hans Wartfels, he was a clear cut\nopponent of Hannah Arant. Why\u2019d I think Hannah Arant had some good points? We\nknow today that this was not very reliable, that he used the book of Raoul Hillberg to a\ngood part, and that he -- that she, you know, all the time tends to -- to overshoot the mark,\nyou know, and so on, but in general I think she was right with the main thesis\n[indecipherable] available. And all that certainly was a problem that is so difficult to\nunderstand for the survivor side. I do understand that very well, while that issue on the --\nRaoul -- of the Jewish council, I think have been otherwise too [indecipherable]. But the\nmain problem certainly is that, in fact, Iseman was very active, but he was on the other\nhand not a man who [indecipherable] and new research has found out that Iseman comes\ninto that business first because of the resettlement of the ethnic Germans in 1939, because\nof the German-Soviet agreement. And he is responsible for the interpretation of the\npillars, and the Jews, and other groups from Vladica, in order to resettle the Germans\nthere. And there they make their first experiences, and by that they are working for the\nestablishment of the greater German Reich, and that\u2019s not only that negative element, and\nlater on you know everything 1n that [indecipherable] resettlement in [indecipherable]\naffairs, and it didn\u2019t work, but then something like an overcompensation down there,\nwork very hard and honor -- at least -- at least, to implement the Holocaust, they did it.\nYou know, I think that\u2019s a psychological mechanism, it\u2019s very important to give an\ninterpretation of the group of the -- of the local and regional perpetrators.",
        "A: Well, but change, the -- the other year, I have been in Jerusalem, they had on a scolley\nconference on Hannah Arant, and they took over the admiration of Hannah Arant, which\nis I think symptomatic for the United States, we would be more critical in Germany. And\nher problem certainly is that both sides don\u2019t understand that Hannah Arant is basically\ninfluenced by the [indecipherable] your Conservative -- tism. Which 1s different from\nbigots. One has to know that in order to understand Hannah Arant. In all her theories, you\nknow, of the philasinhite, of the loneliness of man, and then there comes back the -- a\nmodel -- that the Jews are the model for the world population. Well, and if you look in a\nGerman idea, there\u2019s philosophy of the 19\" century of Fishter, and all these people, you\nsuddenly get it, that\u2019s her. But she t -- I think masschoserv has to be a pragmatic\nphilosopher, she 1s not. Therefore --",
        "A: She is -- Well, about an -- with that crazy mixture, you know.",
        "A: And a -- a -- th-- the easer -- it is -- don\u2019t understand that either, I think we -- I --\naccording to my opinion. I am not a specialist for Hannah Arant, but I met her. I never\nforget when I met her, because I was invited by American history department of the\nColumbia University. When was that? In 70 -- in \u201978, I think or \u201974. And my wife was\nthere, and that was in affecta club of the Columbia University. And they had very bad\norganizer, sadly it turned out that also Henry Freidlander was invited to deliver-liver a\nlecture, and then they decided that we had each a half an hour rather than hour lectures.\n[indecipherable] care. And there were about 200 people there, once was very lively, and\nthen suddenly somebody entered the room, that was Hannah Arant. I saw they knew her\nfrom the television, that was very clear. The whole atmosphere changed immediately, the\n-- the talk silenced down. She was there, you know, that was -- she had a radiation, no\nproblem, no. Then we had to give our papers, then she said, \u201cWell, both papers are very\nbad.\u201d This is wrong, that is wrong, she [indecipherable]. But anyhow -- And after that --\nthat was finished, the debate, I went with Wilfreda to her, and said hello, and she invited\nus immediately to go to her flat that was in Riverside Drive. And I forgot that she took a\ncab for that 300 meters or something, but that was the time there that was still very\ndangerous, you know. And then we were sitting there until two in the night, and that was\n-- that didn\u2019t change much, there were all the papers of her husband still there, the name\nof the husband at the entrance to the flat, and we had a very, very interesting talk. And\nshe was really good, I never forgot it.",
        "A: Not a problem, it\u2019s difficult to say what we talk. Certainly we reported a lot about\nGermany, German history and so on, and possibly she was a receiver more than -- I have\nto talk with my wife, she is better in recollecting these things, I don\u2019t know, but I only\nrecollect that th -- the -- the graduation of her personality, and on the other hand, you\nknow, she had learned in Germany that openness of the American academics, you know?\nImmediately you talk about what you\u2019re doing, what you want to do, and so on. She was\nreally good, you know.",
        "A: I was very much impressed, and also from the surrounding, these many books and papers,\nwho knows, was a lit -- anything but orderly, and I think she didn\u2019t change too much\nsince her husband died, and well -- and so far, I was very much impressed by her. That\ndidn\u2019t much influence what -- what my -- because I -- I wrote about the Eichmann trial\nbukfa earlier.",
        "A: Th-That was far before she -- I met her then, and I was not influenced personally, but I\nthink that she had some good points at -- at that book.",
        "A: She must have known -- at least she knew who I was, you know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember that, you know. But I never got, you know, the openness\nand she was really ready to -- to talk with us, in spite of the criticism of that paper, you\nknow, so.",
        "A: Well, it was quite good, because you know, there was a [indecipherable] written by --\nwhat is this Stuttgart destroy, and again, and a mountain -- and he -- bec -- and he\ncriticized then, or could ha -- was criticized to be a hyper-Intentionalist. And that was\nquite true. And -- But that all my enemies, you know, say -- opponents, they would then\nargue with Functionalist arguments against Goldhagen. And that was in a way, the end of\nthe Intentionalist school. Even if you take what the -- what the -- what Chris Browning\nsaid there, you know what, all the Functionalists are the ones against Goldhagen, and\nGoldhagen in a way, you know, by -- by expanding the Intentionalist position to the\nutmost, you know, it des -- he destroyed it, you know. And so far, it was in the -- it was\nquite interesting. I know him very well, I met him first in \u201985, in a conference which was\nrun in Berkeley by Gary Feldman, and there he delivered a paper on the [indecipherable]\nrepublic, and he was very, very critical about [indecipherable] republican said there was\nstill extreme anti-Semitism, which he would deny today, and he had, for instance, this\nstrange conclusion that in the Secret Service, there are more party members than have\nbeen in the Third Reich. You know, so I mean, that may be true, and so far, as nobody\ncould enter the Secret Service in the Third Reich, there was no member of the Nazi party.\nBut you know, he really thought that the [indecipherable] republic was completely Nazi\nparty, and anti-Semitic. And then later on, you -- now, his publisher told him not to tell\nthat, and Jerry Feldman -- Gary Feldman should publish that conference, I ne -- I met him\nin Oxford, and said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s with the conference?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have yet the\npaper of -- of Daniel Goldhagen.\u201d I say, \u201cYou will never get it,\u201d you know, he would --\nhe\u2019s [indecipherable] himself, he\u2019s doing that. And I never forgot I said to him, \u201cWell,\nDaniel, if you go to my class and [indecipherable] on the other hand that we are\nsympathetic to you, they wouldn\u2019t accept that, you would have hard time.\u201d And that\nimpressed him a little. And then I met him at a conference in -- on Hannah Arant, and\nothers -- other things in -- in Harvard. And we are sitting on a panel and he attacked me\nsharply and [indecipherable] republic, I never forgot it. On the same line, you know, that\nanti-Semitism is still there, and there -- course, when I was answering, I said to the -- to\nthe [indecipherable] also, you got it from the audience, anti-Semitism is still hanging, you\nknow, it was really -- it was a really not a very friendly climate. Then I said to the\naudience, well people, you must know the German Jew, the younger generation is doing\nanything to study the Holocaust, and to go to Israel, and to improve the German Jewish\nrelations, it\u2019s not fair if you say that. And I never forget that someday you tha -- that mud\nchange, you know, that was clear, that this was no longer the topic, German anti-\nSemitism. And then he told them -- I invited him for dinner, and he told me what he\nwanted to do in Germany, the whole [indecipherable] things, so and so on. I know him.\nKnow? Well, in a way, I glad that he got a prisoner of his own thesis, and of the whole\naffair, because I don\u2019t see that he has an academic future by that.",
        "A: Because, as y -- he -- I know, the father very well, ri -- when I was in Harvard, I met the\nfather several times.

It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- In a way it\u2019s a pity, and the book 1s so terribly bad, from the -- from\nthe scholarly viewpoint. It\u2019s not a -- so much a problem with the position, but he doesn\u2019t\nknow anything about folkish anti-Semitism, and you know, it\u2019s quite interesting, where\ndid he got his idea of the -- how 1s that anti-Semitism called, e-el --",

He got it by\nGeorgie Massey. There he got some information of Langbean that was also a bit one-\nsided, but well Georgie was a wonderful man, anyhow, and then he took that up without\nreally knowing what he took up, you know. Because he never understood the context of\nthe early -- that means the li -- 19\" century Wagnerian anti-Semitism, which was strongly\nconnected with the idea that the Jews are, in -- was -- some respects, a model nation for\nthe German one, and then they got the idea that the German nation can\u2019t be built, except\nof the elimination of the Jews from the German nation, so that -- that was not meant in\nthe sense of killing. Now see, all this assumes [indecipherable] he\u2019s as bad that he -- he c\n-- he -- he doesn\u2019t -- he isn\u2019t able to read German text correctly, you know. His\ninterpretation of one quotation of pishta Israel is really terrible. He wants them to -- to\nsay that there already was a idea of a systematic killing of choice. But, on the other side,\nwhere you have that, in the fergush movement, he doesn\u2019t mention it e-either, you know?\nBut you know, that\u2019s a story for -- o-of itself, and the reason was that he discovered a bit\nlate that Chris Browning had already written the book he wanted to write.",
        "A: And by that, he added that part on the 19\" century, and added that part on the labor\ncamps, and the Death Marches.",

He put that in a broader politic context, you know, I can\u2019t have a lot of\npositive arguments, but in the principle -- principle, mathological point, I would say\npresent research is -- 1s, I think, has developed farther, and couldn\u2019t -- would avoid to\nhave this harda monocausal, and mainly I -- illogical interpretation, and but -- but I\nrecommend to read these books, anyhow.",

Awhile ago, in 1932, I invited\nhim to deliver a lecture in -- in my university at Buckholm, telling him, if you could enter\n-- reclude the resettlement policy of Heinrich Himmler, in 1939 - 1940, you know? And\nhe answered he couldn\u2019t do that, then he would deliver what he usually delivers, you\nknow, his very competent survey on how the implementation of the Holocaust occurred\nstep by step.

And that makes it then also better\ncomprehensible for next generations, who have difficulties to study only the little bit\nisolated Jewish field. Those are my position -- my field here, I thought I should be the\ngeneralist a little bit, in the midst of all these special -- specialists, and experts on certain\nfields of the Holocaust.

You know, that\u2019s quite clear ba -- th -- by that, it gets more comprehensible.\nAnd -- And if you look at that in order to show the pre-conditions for any pre-ju-jub --\nany genocidal policy, you know, then it shouldn\u2019t isolate that, and so far, the term\nuniqueness is not very helpful, but I wouldn\u2019t re -- wouldn\u2019t reject the -- that on the other\nhand, this is a unique event, which isn\u2019t comparable directly with the [indecipherable |\ngulag under Stalinism, and so on, although it | -- it lies on the same level. They are -- We\nwill discuss, I think, in future years a little bit, to what extent the -- the German\nperpetrators learned from -- from the local anti-Semitic populations in the east, and the\nRussians in the way. You know, the death marches are an invention by a Soviet -- by the\nSoviets. They did that with their own people. And then the German suddenly came to the\nidea to do it also, first with prisoners of wars, and at -- at the end, with concentration\ncamp inmates. That\u2019s Soviet, the idea of that in -- can -- let -- march people about,\nhundreds and kilometers, was very familiar in a -- start in this period. And so far,\nsometimes there are comparabilities which are -- shouldn\u2019t be precluded by accepting the\nunique character of the Holocaust.",
        "A: Well, I would say -- would take up the argument that 1 -- on account of a -- a -- quite a lot\nof reasons. Some is certainly the traditional occ-Occidental anti-Semitism. The Jews were\nkilled, and the others not, just because the Nazis didn\u2019t have enough time to kill the\nothers. And my friend Kurt Salley, he would talk about the top of the iceman to know.\nWhere\u2019s the iceberg, or where --",
        "A: Iceberg, you know. And I mentioned that, at a talk to -- and now I got about the\nresettlement policy, you know, it\u2019s quite the -- after -- there was some compensation\nmechanism which [indecipherable] at first met the Jews. And suddenly they are the -- the\nprejudice, and anti-Judaism, and not only a distinct anti-Semitic philosophy was\nresponsible, that the selection was then made, and a lot of other factors. But that - in -- in\nthe long run, that wouldn\u2019t have been an isolated phenomenon, they would have killed\nother groups, also. So th -- it was in a way, to put it in question marks, the easiest to kill\nthe Jews, because they didn\u2019t get opposition from their local populations, and you know,\nand you know, and you know. But the tendency to kill other groups as well, is\nunmistakably t-there. And it so far, you know, you can say there was a uniqueness on\ntheir -- within the general picture, there was something like a uniqueness, like maybe\nkind of ca -- try to put that in that way. And there is something which certainly explains\nthat the -- the Jews were killed foremost, and the others anyway survived, although\nkilling processes were underway all the time.",
        "A: Is that a sufficient answer?",
        "A: That\u2019s my thesis, yes. So now, in the last months of the -- of the war, you know, they\nsuddenly said, we don\u2019t need only racial homogeneity, we need only political\nhomogeneity, and started to kill everybody in this time, 10 thousands of Germans, either,\nyou know. And then so far, you know, that was symptomatic for that form of -- of -- that\nstyle of politics.",
        "A: You know? If you -- If you have politics which are unable to have something like a\nlasting compromise, and then you have only destruction as the alternative, you know,\nthat\u2019s really --",
        "A: Well, usually historians are very critical, I\u2019m not. I think \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d is quite a\ngood film, and I think the historical data are mainly, I think, reliable. One can talk about\nsome interpretations here, but in general I think it helped to understand the process in the\nminds of many youngsters in Germany. And well, it doesn\u2019t replace the historical work,\nwhich is certainly more abstract, and less simple, but on the other hand, I think it was\nmore helpful than the documentary films we had in the -- in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s, which\ndidn\u2019t left an imprint on the German mentality, or at least not too much.",
        "A: Landsman\u2019s \u201cShoah\u201d is different, but you know, Landsman\u2019s \u201cShoah\u201d has something for\na few intellectuals who will sit there for 24 hours, I don\u2019t know how long that is, you\nknow.",
        "A: Nine hours, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: You know, that\u2019s not symptomatic for a -- for the public. It\u2019s very impressive, you know,\nand [indecipherable].",
        "A: I don\u2019t understand it very well, you know, we have an interchannel change, and suddenly\nwe have a generation which starts, and you -- well, it goes a whole way. We did, as\nhistorians, starting with the ideas, and turning back to issues they don\u2019t know -- want to\nknow that. And it\u2019s so forth they have, and -- and fairly increased interest in the second\nWorld War, and the Jewish issue, and so on. Among the younger students today, and\nthat\u2019s quite a phenomenon, and -- but it has to be interpreted in terms of interchannel\nchange. Do you know, after those generations have left office, or the positions who was --\nwho were in this or that kind involved, now the next generation wants to know, and to\nprovide information and -- and that -- start anew, I think.",
        "A: Well, not necessarily, but that\u2019s certainly connected to that, that we have that\nphenomenon in Germany, which I think it\u2019s really remarkable.",
        "A: You know we had a national indifference in Germany at the time, and the nation stayed\ntraditional 19\" century, almost disappeared. If you talk to the kids today about Bismarck,\nthey don\u2019t know who he is, you know, and if you talk about students in the war area,\nabout the French scoo occupations, and they ask whether that\u2019s in the 17\" century, or in\nthe [indecipherable]. That\u2019s got national history in a traditional sense, 1n Germany has, in\na way, faded out among the next generations. And there 1s, I think, growing a new\nnational identity, which looks more at the chain of events, starting in the Third Reich,\nleading to the second World War, and the Holocaust, and certainly then, being in the\nbackground for the formation of the [indecipherable] republic. That\u2019s rit -- quite a\ndifferent side of historical basic facts, which have -- they have in mind, and to which I\nthink the experience of Auschwitz belongs, in a way, you know?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: I\u2019ve seen it -- yes, I have been in it, yes.",
        "A: Well, [indecipherable] books on that, d\u2019you ever read them? You know, and I found it\nvery interesting, the -- the recent book by Ted Hurwitz his name, on the -- on the\nmiterzation of the Holocaust, you know, and he brings that interpretation that they want\nto put a positive meaning by stressing the Americans as liberators, and so on, in\ncomparison to what is going on 1n wa -- Yad Vashem, you know. Well, from a German\nviewpoint, that is -- that\u2019s not very convincing. And I -- I always told that story that a\nGermans wanted to have a room for the resistance movement, but unfortunately that is\ntoo anti-Semitic [indecipherable] to wage that -- at --idea, you know, but that was very\nsymptomatic. But we don\u2019t have the possibility to connect the -- that, even to bend with\nsome sort of suppositive national tradition, you know. That\u2019s it\u2019s -- has to do with what I\ntold you about, the emergence of a new consciousness. We just can\u2019t [indecipherable]. At\nleast the other Germany resistance no -- we have done five people, or 50, that\u2019s not\nenough, you know. It\u2019s not representative. And then so far, sh -- from a German\nviewpoint, you look at that as certainly a bit skeptically with all the politish and nutson\nwent on the attendance to -- to have some general consequential slogans, or what do you\nsay, you know. We are far more skeptical as -- us Germans who went through that\nexperience. But anyhow, it\u2019s a very impressive exhibition, and is a -- is a very, very good\nand interesting material, 1n many respects, but it would be [indecipherable] to say that a\nmost impressive place is where you have the pictures of that little town, what\u2019s the name?",
        "A: You know, that is --",
        "A: But that would be also the reaction of the -- of the German yosterday, you know. Because\nthat\u2019s like \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u2019, or that\u2019s the Klemperer diary. It shows the people again,\nyou know. And what is our task as historians, is to -- not to -- well, the people should stay\nalive in the whole description of the process, that\u2019s difficult. And that is done, 1n a way,\nby the exhibition.",
        "A: Well I -- He is a good friend of mine, I like him. The book is wonderful in respect -- with\nrespect to the style and the language and the -- I think the breadth of the material he uses.\nI differ in one respect, that I think that he doesn\u2019t show the political process leading to the\nevents, you know. That -- I want to write now a small history of the Holocaust, and I am\nnot so bright as my friend Saul [indecipherable]. Wh-What I want to show is how -- why\nthe Nuremberg laws were in 1935, and not in 1943, or so on. And how did the rise\nkastern, cris - Crystal night occur in Sep-September 19 -- no, in November 1938, and --\nd\u2019you know, that he doesn\u2019t show, you know. What are the -- the political mechanisms\nwhich were involved, and that is a little bit what I think I can contribute to the business of\nall these experts who -- that\u2019s very impressive, but we have to -- to -- also to explain why\nthat came into being, you know, and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s difficult and -- and so far, it\u2019s\nwonderful, but -- but it\u2019s written from hindsight.",
        "A: But one should try --",
        "A: -- to write in the way that you still, as a reader, are not aware what 1s going on. Later on\nows, that\u2019s still open -- open -- open -- open. And suddenly then, it will change. That\u2019s\nwhat I want to do. Whether I\u2019Il be able is another question.",
        "A: Oh I don -- no, no, not yet.",
        "A: I -- Ina way, I started with tha -- doing these nextashear, put a lot of work into them. I\nlearned something.",
        "A: Yes, first of all, to interpret the Holocaust as political process, and to put it in the context.",
        "A: That simple, clear, and difficult.",
