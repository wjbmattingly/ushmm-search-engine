        "Q: ... please, and when you were born?",
        "A: Uh, my name is Paul Matasovski. And uh I was born in a small town in Moldavia--\nRomania--called Bac_u, in December 1933.",
        "Q: OK. Tell me about the family. Tell me about your family.",
        "A: Uh, well, uh it's an interesting story is my family. My father--Leonid, his name was--he was\nborn in Russia, near Kiev. And he came to Romania in 1917, probably with the Russian\nArmy. Nineteen...maybe early 1915, 1916; and after the Russian revolution in 1917, he\ndecided to stay in Moldavia. It's a small town, Bac_u. So he was a young man, and uh he\nwas interested in uh automobiles and cars. At that time was very new things, cars. So in,\neven in the Army, if I recall my father's stories, he was in a unit who handled car repairs. So\nhe was a kind of specialist in cars. So he starts some, some kind of work in car repair in my\nsmall town. My mother, Maria, was born in another small town, my guess, called Falticeni,\nin northern Moldavia. And with her parents come this small town Bac_u.",
        "Q: How would you spell that town that she came from?",
        "A: Uh, yes, uh, the town of Falticeni is F-A-L-T-I-C-E-N-I, approximately. So we are close to\nsay Falticeni. And uh her father, if I recall, my grandfather, he died before the Second War,\nand she had a sister who uh died during the war. Was a lot of diseases at that time. And she\nwas with her mother in the small town Bac_u. So my father once walked downtown\napproximately where my mother lived and saw nice girl outside in front of the house and\nstarted to talk to her. And he came a couple of times, the same way, because he has the\nfeeling that he likes her. So shortly after probably a couple of months, if I recall, my father\ntold to my mother that he wants to talk to her mother. And why to talk to her mother?\nBecause I want to ask your hand. I want to marry you. So it's a kind of excitement, and uh,\nin principle they agreed to marry and start to see more often. And probably after one years,\nthey married. So uh, my family life started I guess in the 20's after the war. I don't know if I\nwas clear enough, but this is our start, the whole family.",
        "Q: What was it like for you as a child growing up in Bac_u?",
        "A: It was interesting. Uh, now after so many years, when I recall how it was to be a child, it's,\nmaybe it's different and my last years I went, and I grow and I leave and I work in very big\ncities, but at that time, even I know that it was a small city. For me, for all the children,\nBac_u was a very, very big city. And if I can recall, maybe I was when I recall first time, I\nmay be five years old or four years old. I went to kindergarten. We start to play on the\nstreets. We always, my friends, we tried to play on our backyards and front yards. And again\nthe streets, we, we played, we used to spend lots of time on the streets running and playing\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand all kinds of things. As I recall our street was a dirty street and we liked at that time\nwhen it was raining, to go under the rain, and after the big rain on the street was a lot of uh\ncreeks, water creeks. Running water. And we liked to, to run uh barefoot and to\nmake all kinds of paper boats to throw away. And was a lot of fun. What can I tell you. At\nthat age. And to know for sure no matter what happened, we have to go home very early in\nthe evening. To be ready for dinner. Was a tradition, probably in our family, other families,\nfor families to be together for lunch, for dinner, for whatever. Whenever we eat. And I\nremember my mother told me once, you can go where ever want, approximately, but be\nhome at five o'clock or six o'clock, what time was for the dinner. So was, I have very nice\nfeelings and we didn't have any very big problems at that time. We didn't know about\nproblems. We tried to plan you know. Like every kids every where, you know, have the\nsame, probably saw the kind of beeing. We were no different from other people, other\nyoung people, other kids.",
        "Q: OK. What, were, did you have any sense of uh, what was it like to be a Jew in Bac_u?",
        "A: Bac_u even was a small town, had a big Jewish community over there. And uh, the Jewish\ncommunity, even some section of the city, like uh I cannot say ghetto, but uh some two,\nthree, four streets, famous because the Jews live over there. And most of the middle class\nand maybe poor Jewish people live in the same section of the town. And other streets in\nother part were lot of Jewish families over there. So uh first time I uh, I start to, to think\nabout to be Jews, when we go for the holy days to the synagogue. My parents, especially my\ngrandmother, uh, start to take, to take us, me and later on my brother, for the holy days in\nthe fall and the spring to the synagogue. So we start to, to, to know about the Jewish life and\nto know about uh other Jewish children over there, and what I remember, which was a lot of\nfun for us, for uh Passover, Passover, there are two things which I recall today. We use\nsome special uh dishes, special plates for Passover, and we kept in attic, so and packing all\nkinds of paper. I notice my mother, before the Passover, told us to go in attic and to bring\nthe dishes. And so was very big event to go, you know, to climb, in the attic and to come\nback. Another thing which I recall, besides other things, to get uh matzos, what you call\nthis, matzos? Was, you couldn't buy in the stores like we go today in all the stores and buy,\nyou know, we want for uh Passover. It was only one manufacturer where the Jewish\ncommunity center. We have a big Jewish community center, as I recall, and you have to go\nand they start to manufacture during the, before the Passover. So was a big line. You don't\nhave to uh to make a reservation. Everybody comes and stay on the line and take the matzos\nhome. So it was a big, big event to go and to go as a cart, as a carriage, people to take the\nmatzos to bring home. And other interesting uh story that I remember, may be like a\ntradition, I don't know what. Before the Passover, always, my parents bought new clothes\nfor us, you know. So they bought all the time you know, clothes. But for Passover, it was,\nwe were kids with this and new clothes, and go in the street and everybody wanted to show.\nLook to me how good clothes I'm wearing. Kids, but everybody wanted to show what kind\nof new clothes as we have over there, so it was kind of fun, you know, for Passover. And\nuh, later on, I start to go to the school, to elementary school and uh, to junior high school.\nThe system of schools is different than here and now. But first time, we uh found 1n our\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nclasses some Jewish and non-Jewish kids, and we knew some families in neighborhood. So\nuh many, we start to make friends, it's true non-Jewish and Jewish friends. But the time\nwent by, and the more after the year start to appear some sign of anti-Semitism. The more\nthe Jewish kids, Jewish students come together, because they sometimes was the object of\nsome bad words, maybe bad action. After a, after a while some uh Jewish students\nsometimes start to congregate, to gatherings during breaks and uh after work and before\nwork, so uh was a big connection between uh I can say Jewish students of all ages.",
        "Q: Were there, what changes, did any changes take place in 1933 when Hitler came to power in\nGermany? What began in the '30s to happen in Romania, if anything?",
        "A: I guess happened many things, like in the all world and uh I was very young, uh young boy\nat the time. But already I remember very well in my family, my father and I guess in that\nperiod was '33, '34, was the first trme a radio in our house and we (were) not wery rich, I\nguess, like middle class, we didn't have a radio, so he bought a second-hand radio. And we\nstart to listen to the radio. And we started at that time to hear more and more about\nGermany, about Hitler, about what's going on. So the people start to, to talk and I heard in\nour family, talking with some friends, talking about what happened in Germany. And\npeople already become to be anxious about what the future will bring because we had some\nfeelings, not to I say we, we kids, but Jewish people said something's starting to, to, to\nchange. It's a quietness and it's a quiet life which was before over there. And if I remember\nagain was a lot of articles in the press at the time about the events. And uh, was some kind\nof discussion now and people start to talk more, but was only talk at this time about\nGermany, about Hitler, about the situation in our town.",
        "Q: And when the war actually broke out, what happened?",
        "A: Now we come to the period of time when I guess I remember most about what happened\nand to my recollection I have more lively now, you know. And matter of fact, even before,\nbefore the war started, the war started in '41, if Iremember June, I say 21, '41, the war\nstarted, the German started to cross the Soviet Union's border. But before '41 already the\nsituation was very tense. Number one, in '39, '38, when Hitler start to act aggressively and to\nenter Austria in '38 and Czechoslovakia if I remember, we were more anxious and many\npeople, many Jewish people, start to think to emigrate from Romania. And our lot of town\nis the young organization over there, and uh, always uh Zionist uh movement try to\nconvince people to immigrate to Palestine even before the war. By the events that\nhappening before the war, 1n '38, '39, the international events start to show to the people,\nspecially to the Jewish people, to find a way to escape in case Hitler would come close to\nour borders. But between or besides the international conditions, uh domestic conditions\nchange. Some fascist organizations like Iron Guard and other organizations start to become\nmore, more aggressive. And they start to take action against the Jewish people. They start\non the street to, to beat some Jewish people in '39 with some, some, some uh big uh, uh\ngrow of this organization encouraged by Germans, by other groups. So in '30, '39 the\nsituation start to be very tense for all the people. And I have to, to tell you no probably and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nI'm sure that when the German went to Poland and occupied in September, I don't know,\nSeptember Ist if I recall, beginning of September, we heard by the radio, but after two, three\ndays already the Polish troop start to run from Poland and to come toward Moldavia to\nRomania. And one day, one morning, I remember like now, it was four in the morning, we\nheard a large noise, big noise on the, my street, and like a big column of tanks or heavy\nvehicles start to moving. Unusual noise for a small city. So everybody went out. It was four,\nfive in the morning. And we saw some columns of trucks, loaded with uh Polish soldiers.\nDirty, uh thirsty, very very uh tired, like escaped from, from the war. And the first thing they\nalways asked for water, some food and was a very very depressed situation. It would\ndepress anybody. And to know for yourself as the first time what the war means. We saw\non our streets, and was in '39, and uh the Polish troops start to, to get out of the vehicle, ask\nfor more food. They start to trade something, want it to be free, and there's long story what\nhappens uh Polish troop. But began the first sign when we saw the war in our uh, in the\nmiddle of our house. So we understand that the situation aggravate and aggravate more and\nmore. So even before the war started in '40 other international events and domestic events\nstarting to, to, to uh, to occur over there and the Iron Guard and other fascist organizations\nbecome more powerful. And the political situation start to uh, to be very tense and as we\nknow, in '40 and beginning on '41 was a big change. The king was take over from the\nthrone, was uh expelled out, and uh General Antonescu the power and installed a\nvery fasciest dictatorship together with Iron Guard, which was very extremist, but after the\nwar start a fight for many reasons, not now the place to go to tell between Iron Guard and\nGeneral Antonescu. And General Antonescu become very powerful and in charge of the\nsituation. And he start uh, '40, end of the '40, beginning of '41, to take some uh very drastic\nmeasures against the Jewish people over there. So before the war start, I can say that we felt\nstrong already the impact of fascist dictatorship government in our country. I can elaborate\nmore if you want what happened.",
        "Q: No, no. That's fine. That's fine. Uh, what, talk a little bit about uh, what kind of groups were\nyou in at that time? Were you members of youth groups, were you involved in anything as\nthe war approached, '39, '40?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. This is other interesting story. Like I told you when uh in our city and in other\nprobably city, there was a lot of uh Zionist organizations. Young organizations, not young,\nand other political organizations, non-Jewish, with democratic tendency for more kinds of\nuh political uh beliefs. And they understand, uh many people understand that the time\ncomes to do something. It's not only to wait to see what happen will happen. So there\nstarted a lot of discussion between uh young people, maybe old people too, to find a way to\norganize something to do. And uh, specially I can say, in uh '40, the government, the fascist\ngovernment, uh issue a lot of laws against the Jewish people. And one of them between\nmany was a uh forbidding children, students, Jewish students was expelled from the public\nschool. And here comes a very, very interesting situation position of the Jewish community,\nbecause when all the students, Jewish students, were expelled from the school, immediately\nwas the Jewish local, Jewish leaders and the rabbis have big meetings what to do. So they\ndecided again maybe my recollection time-wise not exactly month or year, but and '40,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbeginning or end or the fall of '40 or beginning of '41, the Jewish community sent or\ndecided to organize own school for Jewish students. They promised to find the space, to\nfind the teachers, and was a big problem. And I recall something about they decide to give\nthe space and other space available was the Jewish community center and start to organize\nthe first high school in the, in our town. And there a lot of professional people who never in\ntheir lives they were teachers. They offer their service to be teachers. They got engineers, we\nhave architects, and maybe other professional people, lawyer I remember, who become\nteachers. So we start to have our, our schools. So we start an hour of school to discuss a lot\nabout what has to be done and besides uh learning and teaching and the teachers, the\nstudents start to talk about to do something. So we start to organize some group, as a\nmixture of Zionist young people, non-Zionist people, and to have some friends who are\nnon-Jewish in other school. And we start to talk to them as much as possible. It was very\ndifficult to start to make connections. And was other political parties, democrat parties start\nto, to, to uh enter, to think about organize some. At that point we decide to organize some\ngroup over there to do something because we have some signal from abroad what start to\nhappen to the Jewish people in uh Czechoslovakia and Poland. So we start to organize some\ngroup and to find a way to fight the German. Because now in the '41 the war started, the\nJewish people more restricted in movements. They were confined to their home, specially to\nthe Jewish young people, specially, and uh sent in uh the labor camp and mandatory factory\nto dig trenches for the war. Uh, they close the hospital, public hospital, to the Jewish uh\npatients, etc. etc. So was started to, to, talk and to think to do something, and we start to\norganize some groups. At one point between Jewish young people and non-Jewish young\npeople over there.",
        "Q: What kind of groups were they? What did they do?",
        "A: Now this is very, very interesting uh question because basic is the beginning. The most\nimportant thing I guess, thinking now, we didn't, we didn't have any information about what\nwas going on in the war because all the press was already the first of all, was uh interdict\nradio sets was taken from the Jewish people. All the Jewish people has to give_ beginning\n'40, '41, the radio sets. So was not a way to, to listen to the radio. The press was under the\ncontrol, and they publish only what was interest, in the German interest was this way. And\nbefore the war and after the war starting to publish only war, German what you call\ncommuniques about the war. So one of the first things we sought was to find what was\ngoing on. So some, our friends have some connections, have some friends who are non-\nJewish and start to, to have uh networks to find information what is going on through the\npeople who had radios, have information based on their position, parents' position. And I\nremember even was two, three Jewish people who interested in the electronic like today and\ntwo of them decided to build from, from scratch, from nothing some small radio uh\nequipment in order to listen what is going on. So this one was the first action, and we start\nfrom time to time to have some uh, some news. They succeeded to uh get some information\nthrough some if I recall BBC from London and from probably from Russia they catch some,\nsome news over there. But the interesting part with that uh the young people who, who put\ntogether this radio, during the day they dismantled the radio because if some police came in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhouse, they don't find the radio even and hiding the pieces and during the evening they put\ntogether. Was a very difficult operation. Basically, this is a fact, that was not uh parts put\nthis way, and together parts was a big problem. So the first action was to get information\nand the, the second part was to uh disseminate this information. So we start to write the\nnews in some small piece of paper and to give to other young people to, to read. So was a\nshade of transmission of the news. And I recall at one point, we start to find many ways to\nhide this small paper on which we, we wrote some, some news. So we start to take for\nexample, some soaps and cut in half the soaps and make some, some holes, and put together\nand keep the uh hard papers, small papers, and using the paper and to give the soaps. Or\nother way to hide them and to transmit them as material some all kind of doors at one point\nI remember. Some, some toys we used. So this is the first part of the action, was related to\nknowing what was going on and where we stand. Later on we decided to, to start to do\nmore, more action, more uh specially action against if we could the German, and if not the\nGerman uh troops, against the German uh place where they manufacture war products. So\nin our town was a couple of factory. If I recall one was textile factory manufacturing textile\nto prepare to uh, for uh military uniforms say. Was a big factory prepare leather, paper and\nother kinds of industry. And all this industry at one point works like forced labour, a lot of\nJewish young people. And sure non-Jewish people were there. But many, many workmen\nwere sent to fight against the Russians, the front. So a lot of young Jewish and young, non-\nJewish people, young people fifteen years old was brought to this factory to work. So in this\nplace is start to have some connection and to start to do all kind of sabotage. Say, if I recall,\nto slow down the production for example. To start to uh, to break some machines over\nthere. And was very, very, uh, at that time very audacious actions. Was not maybe very big,\nwe don't blow bridges, but we start a movement to organize the young people to fight\nagainst the Germany and this movement start to extend to non-Jewish. Some non-Jewish\nyoung people refused to go in the Army to fight the war along the Germans. So uh all kind\nof action. At one point was a discussion to start to do something about the German, and\nmany nights, uh many Jewish young people and non-Jewish young people succeeded to go\nsome place close. For example where the Germans keep their trucks, and to open the tanks,\nthe gas tank and to put say some sand inside. And we discuss at one point to start to bring\nsome small pieces of wood planks with nails and to put 1t some place where you know that\nthe Germans uh vehicle will go through in some places. But was interesting because uh,\nmany people at that time was divided I can say, how to act. Some, now, maybe appear very\neasy you know when you talk as far as the part but at that time to go in the street was a big\ndeal to do. Uh to meet some people over there was very difficult because of curfew after six\no'clock no Jewish on the street. And the Jewish has to wear some special sign, the star of the\nJuda as they call it. But uh at one point, maybe, this is interesting as I...(PHRASES\nMISSING)...but uh at one point uh many people thought its maybe better nothing to do\nbecause no matter what you are doing we exposed to something. And was a good feeling\nthat later, uh sooner or later, the German would be defeated and all American Army will\ncome to liberate our part or maybe Russian will be come first over there. So anyways they\nwill come, so why to uh sacrifice our lives. But was a strong feeling among many people\nthat have to do something. You know how many people died towards the front, how many\npeople died in the camps, so many people feel to do to fight against the Germans and oh, the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\npeople, the young people, I talking about young people, maybe not only young people. They\ndon't care at that point about their life because they want to sacrifice to do something.",
        "Q: OK. So you were part of this group. You were doing these things. Uh, what about your\nfamily during this time? How were you living?",
        "A: That's a good question because uh this question applied to, let's put it this way, to the Jewish\npopulation. What happens to the Jewish population? And I have to make a short or long\nparanthesis about this. The Jewish situation in Romania during the war was different than in\nPoland, in Hungary, in Czechoslovakia, in eastern uh western Europe even because of\npolitical situation, because the General Antonescu could become an ally to Hitler and he\ngave everything including a big army to fight along the German army. They kept, the fascist\ngovernment in Romania, they kept some uh power in uh day by day administration of the\nterritory, of the territory. And they was in charge to solve the Jewish problem over there. So\nthey decided for many many reasons, don't to send the Jewish people to Auschwitz. To use\nthem, to put them to work as a factory. Was more useful. They can because they took a lot\nof young people and not young people to put in the army to fight against the uh, along the\nGermans against the Russians. So a lot of factories, they don't have manpower, labor. So\nthey want to use the Jewish people like a labor this work factory as they put a lot of people\nover there. Other Jewish people, let's say young people not only, was sent to build trenches,\nto build uh defense uh lines, at the front. So just speaking, most of the Jewish people were\nnot sent to death camps. Was used to work. Some were sent in different camps 1n the\nterritory which the German took from Russia, in the Ukraine, and maybe come back, maybe\nnot. They start to arrest a lot of Jewish leaders and non-Jewish leaders and to put on uh, in\nprison. But was a small way to make some small, small amount of money. Because when\nthey keep the people, the Jewish people, working in the factories, they give something. They\npay like a very minimum, very minimum salary. I don't want to express how much was, but\nsay enough to buy some piece of bread, was a bread twist or to buy some uh cornmeal or to\nbuy other product which was if there was a market. And other interesting thing I guess, now\ntalking with you it's in my mind, a lot of product came from the farmer who work with the\nland, and before the war the tradition was the farmer who has some land or farm, two, three,\nfour, five miles from the cities, they come everyday in the city to market. Special market. Or\nthey have their customers like to bring the milk, to bring the eggs, to bring whatever, the\nchicken. And I remember, say in our family, was a special farmer which come every day,\nbefore the war, every day they bring the milk in front of our door, some meat sometimes,\nfruits, vegetables, so was some relationship. When the war started this farmer, or some\nfarmers, continued to come to the city to sell their products and many times they help the\nJewish people. They say start to give some products. They don't have too much because\nsome members of their families was taken in the army to go to the war, but uh they continue\nto, to work the land and they come with the less product to the market. But was some way\nto, to get something. And the Jewish people started to sell what ever they had to the people\naround. This only because big deal. They start to sell maybe their furniture, they some goods\nwhatever. Maybe they have some gold. Maybe they have, whatever the Jewish people start\nto sell, to sell, to sell for nothing to, to buy the main product to uh, to survive. So was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsome, some kind of connection to get some food over there. But the problem what\nimportant first to keep alive and good health because, if I recall, the public hospital closed to\nthe Jewish patients say so the Jewish community start to organize some clinic and to use\nsome Jewish doctors to give uh consultation over there. They start to, to get a way to get\nsome medicine, but was more and more, become more uh uh seldom to get medicine. We\ncan't get medicine, we can't get medical assistance to get an operation we need. So many\npeople start even to die, to, to loose their health because of the conditions uh, medical\nconditions over there. And because they cannot feed the family, suppose the young people\ndidn't have food. So the most important thing was to keep alive. Everybody everyday was\nthe fight to keep, to keep alive. So was not, not very easy but was not enough to eat. But\npeople survived. Was most important to, to have to drink, like water or you know, some,\nsome food to, to, to eat over there. And maybe other thing I remember maybe could be a\npart of this survival, I don't know how right or wrong I am. The fascist government start to\ntake the houses from the Jewish people. And this is, a Jewish family has a house is ten\nrooms whatever. Most of the time they took all the house, or nine rooms, and they let the\nJewish owner to stay in one room over there. Five, six people in one room. And they give\nthe rest of the non-Jewish people who occupy the room. Sometimes, being a small town,\nmost of the houses, they have some garden around. So they start the Jewish people to, to uh\nto garden a little. To put some potatoes, to have I remember for some time, sometimes\nmaybe some tomatoes to put over there. Some stuff to use, every possible to survive, to get\nsome food over there. But the health is a problem and everybody was afraid every day\nsomebody was, family would be taken to sent far away in special detachment, uh special uh\nformation to dig uh fortification and many people didn't come back. Was taken to say\ndifferent part of the country to work in the uh forced labor in the factory. And many didn't\ncome back. We don't know why. So uh the most important was to, to keep, to be alive and\nto be like your family to go through, through the war. And something else which probably\ncould happened that I try to explain now is maybe some people are involved in and uh\nhistory research will go further. But we know in '42 starting, Germans start to, to be\ndefeated on the Russian front and was a discussion about to open the second front by United\nStates uh Army with uh Allies. So uh when uh the situation become worse and worse on the\neastern front, Russian front, Zionists start to come back, and many wounded soldiers come\nback. They brought very bad feeling to their family. So non-Jewish family start to\nunderstand, and not before maybe they understood too that the war would be lost. So they\nsuffered, the non-Jewish people suffered a lot, even if they are non-Jewish, they give their\nuh children to go to the war. They lost their children. Was tough for them even to, to get\nfood over there. So many non-Jewish people start to, to, to help the Jewish people. Some\nneighbor would give sometimes say uh a bottle of milk to help, a loaf of bread, start to be\nsome connection again because the people understood that on one hand the Jewish suffered,\nbut they suffered too. It's not like to help the Jewish people, and maybe was, maybe, maybe\nwas some opportunistic situation because they say this good, good relationship with the\nJewish after the war. Who knows, you know. So uh the situation was tough, and many non-\nJewish people took out many special fascist organization, took advantage, took all the\nJewish business, all the Jewish factory, all the big Jewish house, or small Jewish houses, so\nthe only hope of the Jewish people was to, to get out of the war and we know that there be\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nor due to the uh American Army or western army will come to liberate our territory or to the\nRussian army, start the offensive about the Germans over there. So every day, every minute\nstart to follow the news, where 1s the front 1s moving. And I recall like now when was\ndowntown, our town, was a big map of the Russian front showing how deep the German\ntroops and others to penetrate in Russia. How they move from say uh eastern, uh western\npart of the Russia through Kiev to Caucasus to Moscow to Leningrad. And everyday in '41,\nthe line of the front moving further and further. And we look at the map sometimes and we\nwere very afraid. The further the German went, uh further our our hope was diminished,\nright. But after a while we knew the situation was changed. The Germans start to uh to be\ndefeated. But the arrow was a sign on this map remains the same place. They didn't move to\nshow how far they come back. So we start to, to find every way to get information, were we\nstand. Each day the front came closer, closer to our uh land, to this small city. So uh, the\nmore we knew about the news, the uh Russian Army come closer to our border, the more\nwe think that maybe we will escape. But we hope at the same time and everybody was, a lot\nof discussion, about the opening of the second front in Europe. And was a lot of discussion\nabout American troops would come through the Greece at one point, to the, to open the\nsecond front. And to come to Greece, by the Romania to cut the German and probably the\nRussian to go toward west. But as you know, doesn't happen and the Russian came first.",
        "Q: What happened to you? This is 1942, the tide is turning, the Germans are being pushed\nback. What are you doing?",
        "A: Uh, well, at one point say in the '40's, '41, I was in the uh high school, Jewish high school,\nin '42. I start to be involved with a lot, with this organization who start to fight against the\nfascist regime. And in the '40, end of '42, '43 probably, I was sent to work in a factory.\nTextile factory. So I was a worker over there. And being over there I was involved together\nwith other young people over there in kind of organization to sabotage the production and\nwe try together to connect other people in other factories and other schools to start to act\nagainst the German occupation. But at one point, say I was over there and basically the\nnight I came home. Some people were sent to work outside of the city. They have to stay to\nsleep in special barracks. But some people work in the town, had the permission to come\nhome, which was a better situation. So basically I come home every night. I left the home in\nthe morning, I came - but in eight, in uh '43, in the '43, in the fall of '43, part of our\norganization was discovered by police, by security forces. And we start to be followed. So\nwe stop for a while our activities.",
        "Q: What were you doing? You, you refer to our activities, you said sabotage. What were they?",
        "A: Basically, we start at one point like I told you before to spread the news. One of the big\nactivities, to spread the news, to try to find out, to write what is going on at the front. And to\nput in all kinds, to work on a way to transmit this news, small papers. We started in the\nfactory to sabotage say the equipment, the heavy equipment. We started to dismantle some,\nsome uh part of the equipment. Uh we start to cut some textiles over there. Uh we start to\nput to prepare outside the factory some planks, some wood with nails and we start to from\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ntime to time to go close to some vehicle, German vehicle. Not German vehicle who went to\nthe front, to put the sand or even to sabotage the tires, was over there. So this kind of uh\nactivity was basically, and uh in '40, uh, was end of '43, the police discovered. They have an\nagent which introduced in our organization, and to the agent that we work with him,\nprobably was wired to some people. He knew a lot so the spring of '44 they arrest uh five,\nsix people in our organization and I was sent to the prison, to the jail. And I was\ninterrogated. I was tortured. I was there beaten to, to give information about other people.\nFinally, we, was in the spring of '44...",
        "Q: Back up. What happened to you in the prison? I want, describe what happened.",
        "A: OK. So basically I was arrested in the spring of '44. And I was in our local police\ninterrogated. And after a while in the same time after two or three weeks, they decided to\nevacuate the police headquarters because the front start to move in '40, in the spring of '44\nvery close. And Moldavia was the first part to come under the Russian army. So they start to\nevacuate. The government tell uh offices, authorities. So decided to send us another place to\nfinish interrogation and to prepare the paper to be uh, to court. So we was sent to a city call\nGala_1, on the Danube River. And over there starts some interrogations and start to prepare\nbased on declarations made by uh the agent, the informant agent against us in the court.\nBecause we fight against the Nazi, you can't fight against a dictatorship, Romanian\ndictatorship. But meantime, the war start to be closer and closer. And they, try to remember,\nwith some a lot of planes, war planes from Russia start to fly over the city and maybe some\nAmerican flights. So every day, every night was some Allied movement, what you call it,\nair (air raid), air raids was over there. So one day they decide it's not safe. So they decided to\nsend us, this group of young, was not only young people because we met other people over\nthere, to move from this prison to other prison more safe and prepare to go to the court. Was\na city called Ploe ti. Ploe ti, was a very famous because of oil fields over there. And one\nnight they took irons, they put chains on our legs, and chain our uh arms, and sent to other\nprison. But in fact was not kind of regular prison, was a monastery as was transformed in a\nprison like this. And we stay over there waiting for the trial. Was in uh uh '44. And in the\nspring of '44, toward May '44, start the Russian, recall the Russian front was uh broken, the\nRussian victories against the Germans. They come very close. They, they took uh Kiev.\nThey took Ukraine. They come close to the Romanian border, to Bessarabia, on one hand.\nOn the other hand, the American aircraft start to bomb the Ploe_ ti air fields over there. And\nfrom our place we saw many times the American planes coming bombing Ploe_ti. We were\nvery happy any time we saw the planes bombing Ploe_ti. We knew that the war had come to\nthe end. We don't know how close we are to the end of the war. So uh one day, in the\nspring, wait first of all, in Gala_1 even, we was kept in every, everybody in different cell\nalone. Was cement on the floor, nothing, was a piece of wood or something we slept over\nthere. Was a, how you call it, is a piece of uh, an opening which you can't make our need,\nput it this way, and once or twice a day they come to give some bread or some water, that's\nall. And was very, very bad. Most of the people become sick over there. Was, was the\nspring of '44 if I recall and we cannot talk to anybody over there. Any connections. The first\ntime we talked to our people, our uh colleagues which we were together, was the transport\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfrom uh Gala i to Ploe ti, was the train. We stand, we cannot sit because of our chains. We\nsit together, or stand together, will start to talk. Anyway, we become very sick when we\ncome to Ploe ti and Ploe_ ti in comparison with Gala _1 was a nice place because being a\nmonastery we have the right like everybody there, to walk out in the garden over there.\nThere was some place under surveillance but one hour per day or one hour every day. So\nwas a big change for us. And, and this uh place, we could talk a little more free with other\nprisoners. Was not only political prisoners, how you call it, maybe they were criminals,\nmaybe whatever they were, but they had some information about the war. And one day we\nfind out that the Ploe_ti was bombed. We saw them very heavily that uh, uh front was again\nbroken Moldavia as the Germans started to retreat. Uh through Carpathian mountains\ntowards Translyvania in Germany. And then unexpected for us, one day, I saw the, we saw\nthat the people over there who uh ran the prison start themselves to pack and to go. And\nthey told us they would take us to our city back. So one day we were put together in a car\nand went to station, from station went to, by the train to our city, Bac_u. They could free us\nbasically. Because the front is broken. Everybody takes care about themselves. We had\nsome good luck. In other place, in other place, before the Russian came, I heard they killed\nthe prisoners over there. On uh other places, they keep the prisoner to the last moment and\nthe Russian troops liberated them. OK. So basically, basically, uh as the international\nsituation, there is a war help us to be liberated from the prison.",
        "Q: OK. Thanks. We're going to break. We change tapes now.\nEnd of Tape #1\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: Let's go back, Paul. We want to go back. You've taken us to liberation. We want to go back\nnow. And I want to get a clearer picture of you in the middle of this group. Uh, tell me\nabout the group. Uh, first of all, even before that, by 1944, starting between '42 and '44,\nthings were becoming very difficult. (Yes) Were you, at what point did uh transports out of\nthe town begin? Were there any transports? Tell me about that.",
        "A: At beginning of the war, if I recall, that's '41, and before the war even, when they start to\nissue a lot, many law against the Jews, one of the law, besides many, was that the Jewish we\ncannot move from one city to another. They are confined where they were. More important,\nin order to uh have the possibility, to monitor the Jewish movement and to, to, uh to get a\nbetter from their point of view, the fascist government, a better possibly to, to uh to keep\ncontrol of the Jewish population, they order that all the Jewish people from small town\naround our town, for example, to go and to go, to come in the big city, like our city. So a lot\nof Jewish people, and there were thousands and thousands, left their small towns, which\nwere 20, 40, 100 miles, and they were evacuated in our cities. They left everything. They\ncome alone, with some carriage or they walk sometimes. And they have some relatives\nwhere they stayed, like us. We had some relatives came in our house and we, we gave a\nroom and was uh two adult and two children. Another Jewish family gives their house and\ntheir rooms as a Jewish community center organized. So uh at beginning of the war, the\nJewish people were around and concentrate in some big cities or small cities, but, in order to\nbe easy to be controlled. And was interdicted to move from one place to other place. The\nJewish people could not move.",
        "Q: When were the Jews, were Jews every deported from Bac_u to concentration camps?",
        "A: At beginning of the war, some Jewish were deported and some special camps, not in\nGermany, in the Romanian territory and later on, in uh the Russian territory. The fascist\ngovernment build some camps in the Russian territory, in Bessarabia and other part of the\nDniester, the river Dniester over there. But when they start to deport, they started uh some\nJewish people was more uh known for their opinion against a, before the war, against the\nGermans. So they start to deport in non-Jewish uh people who belong to some uh political\nparty like was say some social democratic party. Communist party. They brought all\nCommunists which they know and start to deport and put in uh, in prison. Over there. Some\nwas put, they took like, this is interesting now, they took as the beginning of the war, some\nhostages in our city including I remember my father. They took by random or some reason\nthe police to be sure that at beginning of operations uh Jewish don't do something wrong to\nthe whole territory authorities over there. They put in special uh special places. They took a\nschool, if I remember, and put some, they call hostages, to take Jewish hostages and non-\nJewish hostages. And they start to uh tease (ph) them. See I remember because my father\nwas for two or three months, and we were not sure what at the beginning was their intention\nbecause after two, three months, they liberated some, liberated some people from the\nhostage places. And they took other hostages. And some hostages were even not liberated.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThey were sent in un some camps again in the Romanian territory, in Bessarabia if I recall,\nand uh later on in uh Russian territory. And they organized some, some special prisons.\nThey sent people over there, from these hostages. But after a while I, probably after six,\nseven months, I don't remember exactly, the system of hostages was stopped over there. So\nwas not way to go from one city to the other. Some Jewish people were taken and sent to\nthe factory, the local factory, and some were sent outside the city.",
        "Q: What did you do? I want to know what you were doing at this point?",
        "A: OK. Like I told at the beginning of the war, I was in the school, the Jewish school. The\nJewish community organized a school, very or best thing could for young Jewish people\nover there to continue their education. And after a while in '40, '43 probably, beginning of\n'43, I was taken to work in the uh the factory. Like uh a mandatory labor work, they call. So\nI went over there and I start to work like a laborer, like a textile laborer. At the beginning\nthey give a kind of training, how to use the textile equipment over there, very simple.",
        "Q: How were you recruited into this underground group of yours?",
        "A: This is interesting question. We have some uh, some friends even in the school. And one\nday one my friends, and there was a general system which worked probably, he start to talk\nto me more and more and talked about what represent the German occupation, what\nrepresent the German war, against become the Russian, how's our situation and start to uh\nconvince me, I guess, we have to do something. And as the beginning, I can't say my friend\ndidn't tell me about any organization. He want to convince me that he has to do something.\nThe first stage of you know, uh, his work with me. I have to convince me to do something.\nAnd he talk, and he start to give me some books to read. Was other things at one point,\norganization, some, some German book, if I recall, , American book, Upton\nSinclar, it'sa book _. OK. Uh we have some books by Russian, also Maxim Gorki they\nstart to give us, uh some French also if I recall, Jaures, if I recall. So give some books, start\nto discuss, and after a couple of months, like very casual discussion right, uh he told, hey, if\nyou agree that let's do something, let's do something, already there's organization you know,\nin school here. We are doing something. We can get together. A lot of people think I got it,\nwe have to do something or the German. So uh in this way he introduce me to one other\nmember of organization, but I want to tell you something here, because now I talking with\nyou start to recall something. Because of dictatorship, because of the terror, was not an\norganization like today we say hey, hundred people. Let's make organization. Let's have a\nmeeting, call a meeting. No. Was some rules, and one of the rules of the organization and\non work on the fight against Germany is that one member has to know only other member\nthey contact. So uh, if you were my contact, say to whom I talk, I know only you. And I got\nworking directions, instructions from you only. And on uh my side, after a while, if I can\nbring other young men into organization, to convince other, he will be into step by step, and\nI will be his contact. So he will know only me. So this organization, we don't know exactly\nto a point exactly how many people there were or what exactly is doing. But at one point,\nhe introduced me to the other, say one or two uh colleagues, who happened to be\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncolleagues, and to get together and to see what we can do. More specially against the\nGermans and happened two of these uh colleagues in the school, in the school, later on\nworked on the same in the same factory. So when we went in this factory, textile\nfactory, we start to discuss during break what, how to sabotage the work over there because\nthey produce for the war. And how to maybe to talk to other friends in other factory. So first\nof all we start to slow down the work, and we start to talk to other people around. There are\na lot of young people. We was out to tell them about organization, about anything. By\ntalking about the tough situation of the people, the fact that the war have some big impact\non our lives, to do something. And to convince them to slow down, don't work, don't get\n. So I remember two or three people in a couple of weeks start to become sick, start\nto, to, to go around a lot, start to walk, claims their equipment doesn't work. So all kinds of\nuh action in order to, to, uh reduce the production. And many of us start to at one point to\ncut some electrical wiring over there, which to make mortars. Some parts we start\nto, to, to break some part of the equipment, so after a while there has to be a lot of uh\nmaintenance, repairs, and there is not enough repair parts. So one of our objectives inside\nwas to, to slow the production ...to our possibilities. The second was like uh political action\nI guess. You talk to the people to convince them that the uh fascist government is not good.\nThat we have to do something, that we have to fight for liberation from German occupation.\nWas like uh political activity, to have more and more people to think like what we were\nthinking about.",
        "Q: What composed this group? You said it was not just Jews only, and not just Communists\nonly. Who was in the group? What kinds of people?",
        "A: That's interesting, a matter of fact, like I told you, during the war exactly, we don't know\nexactly the components of this group because say I know one or two people, maybe four\npeople, and other know other people. But basically what we find out that most of the groups\nwas a conglomerate of people from different political uh what you call, uh beliefs. Was\nmany people, Zionist young people, think to fight. Was Communist we sort have to fight.\nWas social democrat. Was other democratic members of all this party before the war\nstarted. So was like a united front to fight against the Germans. And the Communist uh\nrepresentative, a big deal probably, after the war we find out and organize this group. They\nhave an active part. But the most important at this point was to fight the Germans. In\ndifferent ways. And uh many people thought that it 1s not necessary to fight. These others\nbecause there was a big danger. You expose your life. And was the feeling specially in end\nof '42 when we know, people know that the war will be lost by Germany, there's anyway,\nthe Russian or American will come and liberate and Germany will leave. But the problem,\nas you know, when the German troop retreat, they kill not only Jewish people, other people.\nSo if I don't be killed from nothing, the last day it could happen something over there. So\nmany people think doesn't worth to fight. When to fight, because the liberation come\nanyhow. The most important to keep, to keep us alive. But other, many people thought is to\ndo something, to give our contribution to the fight against the Germans.",
        "Q: You were conducting all of this work slow down and destroying equipment and doing all of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthese other things. Uh did you do any other kinds of sabotage-type of activities?",
        "A: Oh, I remember other kind was I was involved was to hide them. They give me something\nto hide in my house. Some books, some materials, sometimes even I didn't know what's\ninside. But they told me they trust me to find a better way to hide than some materials. And\nI remember we work not only to hide to say to dig in the uh soil something, but to use some\nhouses' walls or to, to take out some bricks and put back, and we have in our yard a very old\ncar, uh and I don't know, the engine, took some apart and they put inside. And interesting\nthing was that we tried to uh have for this organization some people who have some\nconnection with the government, some connection. So that we can use for information. And\nfor example, I knew a former colleague, non-Jews, who was, his father was in the Army,\nand at one point we start to talk with him about, to meet him and to talk about the war,\nabout the, what's going on, and he had some good feelings about our fight. He went, was\nready to do something. So we use him, at one time to get him to hide in his house some\nmaterials. And he start to get some information from his father which was an Army officer\nof some type. He knew more what's going on at the front, what's going on in the town, and\nmany times he came to me because when I start my high school he was my uh, my\ncolleague on the bench, sitting next to me, so we were some friends. So we start to meet\nafter the war a couple of times, and start to use his information, his situation to give\ninformation regarding the situation at the front, regarding the situation in town. And other\nthing interesting say at that time that I have to tell you was a girl in our town from a very\nhigh-class family, put it this way, was Jew. But during the war, like I told you, most of the\nhouses was taken by the authorities and given to non-Jewish people or they put some Army\ncommander or officer, give some room in the houses. So uh the family of this girl which\nwas famous in the town, they have their own factory was taken but had the position, had in\ntheir house an officer of the Army, a high, high-level officer. So we start to talk to this uh\ngirl. She was very nice girl. And she had a bad situation. She died many years ago in France.\nBut she start to go from time to time inside the officer's room through some doors they have\nover there. He has two, three rooms in their house. And she start in one hand to use the\nradio to listen what's going on and she start to, to look through, through his papers and find\nwhat's going on in uh local political and army situation and basically, she didn't have very,\nvery deep political conviction but she feels that she wants to help somehow the fight against\nthe Germans to, to give her contribution here. So was a way to, to find more and more\ninformation what you want and to help and she, we gave to her to keep books and to give\nsome other written material which were uh some leaflets for example I remember was at\none point against the Germans, against the war. We distributed sometimes to some people\nthis, and we hide it through her even in the officer's room. So this was a very, very\ninteresting uh story you know. And uh, during the the end of the war, through her we find a\nlot of information.",
        "Q: You hid your material in the officer's room?",
        "A: Yes, yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: How did you do that and where did you do that?",
        "A: Through this girl. I told you, they have a big, before the war, they have a big mansion. So\nthe authorities took almost all the room and part of the apartment they give to this officer,\nhigh-rank officer, colonel say he was over there. And they would cut off communication\nfirst off between the rooms on one hand. On other hand happened, and happened many\nsituation like this, you know many people don't recognize, some officer who were or had the\nrooms in Jewish houses, they know there was a front. They don't like to die on the war. So\nthey started some sympathy for Jewish people and they start to talk to the people who, from\nwhere they took the house. They not treated like enemy. So with some of them,they have\nsome, some kind of relation. They say good night. They (say) good morning probably. They\nhave together the coffee from time to time. So for her, she, was easy to some extent to go in\nhis quarters, in his rooms. So we give her some small books and small uh paper, some\nliterature and she succeeded to go in his room. Not for long, to keep, to keep sometimes\nbathroom, sometimes even under his bed, something some places. So un we're very happy\nthat she wanted to work and we know she was not a zionist, she was not a communist even.\nShe was not, she was a rich girl before you know. She help the movement against the\nGerman.",
        "Q: In your manuscript, you describe an incident when you were trapped in his rooms. Tell me\nwhat happened.",
        "A: That's true, that story. Uh what happened. I have the connection with the girl. So I talk to\nher and she invited to her house to come to discuss, to bring some materials. She went to the\nsame school like I went. So one uh day she told me that she wants to take me to officer's\nroom to show me the room. Maybe I can find some more interesting over there because she\nwas very quick. And I did good or bad, I say, let's go together. So one day she told\nme come around five o'clock, afternoon was maybe, I don't recall, maybe Saturday or\nSunday some. Her folks are out of town. So we, we went over there. But we discussed if\nsomething happened, we start, this was before we discuss her, if even her parents would\ncome or somebody from house or we make believe that we are in love, we embrace one\nanother, something, you know, friend. So she took me in officer's room one day. We started\nto look in his, on his desk, and after a while, maybe five, maybe ten minutes, I don't\nremember, somebody knocked at the door, and enter was an officer uh assistant or\nsomething to him with access. So was scared like death. So immediately start to embrace\none another, start to kiss one another. So the officer start to yell, what you doing. You make\nlove here, you are doing, here in the room. Making noise. And then he start to, to went out\nand to was a and other rooms and her parents lived. What your daughter's doing\nhere. There's a guy over there. So her daughter come or her parents came over in the room\nand started, what's going on. So they upset about their daughter and later about me because I\nam somebody which was . And we make believe that it's true, so finally went out\nand she had a rough time with her parents, and I stopped to see her in her house only this\ntime, but was very funny situation over there. And she was a very, very uh courageous\nyoung uh lady, and nice lady, wasn't. Later on, after uh German was defeated and uh, uh\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nRomania become a free country again, for a while, she went to, to study and become a very\ngood and very famous architect and later on she immigrated to France and in France she had\na bad luck. She died of cancer. But was very sad, very sad. But always I was impressed, I'm\nimpressed, when I think about a lot of people and about the young people from different\nsituation, from different political point of view, has to fight the German. And they\ndon't care about themselves. They are ready to sacrifice. So uh was not selfish people. So\nmany times maybe uh the young people, I was, this time, in our time, has to know what's\ngoing on and to think about what happened and to think that sometimes in life, maybe many\ntimes, it's not good to be selfish.",
        "Q: In doing your underground work, what was the worst moment you ever had? The worst\nexperience?",
        "A: My worst moment, put it this way, was, (PAUSE) I cannot say the worst moment, was\nmaybe was many moments. One was when being in police when was in our town, and the\nsame time was other two, three people which were taken, and I was in a cell with a small\nwindow. During the night I couldn't sleep. But all of a sudden I, I heard some steps. And I\nsaw two policemen bringing somebody, some corridors, and after a while I realized that the\nprisoner was one of my colleagues over there. And they brought him as kind of basement\nnot far away from where I were, and start to beat him, talk to him over there. And I heard\nhis screams and I heard his cries and I watched you know what happened over there and I\nrealized, for me was the worst moment because probably was almost dead over there. But\nhere, specially I knew like a comrade and like a nice person which I talked to many times\nand such a situation was horrifying. And was horrifying to understand what happened to his\nmind and his feeling. Was something which one is the worst moment. And the second worst\nmoment I guess was for me when we were transferred from one prison, from Gala_1, to\nPloe_ ti. I told you before. We was put in a kind of prison, in a monastery. By this monastery\nwas probably, I don't recall, six, seven kilometers, probably five miles, from Ploe_ ti. We\nwere in chains, and the hands cuffed, so from Ploe_ti station to the monastery was not any\ncommunication. We have to walk. So during the walk, during the night, was night, to start\nto walk and the monastery was on a kind of hill. We have to uh, road winding and climbing.\nAfter ten minutes, fifteen minutes, almost nobody could no more walk because the chain on\nthe legs makes them uh, wounds, wounds you because. And they at one point start to bleed.\nAnd they couldn't walk. And almost I fall down. And other people fall down. At that\nmoment, we stop for maybe a couple of seconds, and once the policemen start to come to us\nand say, go, don't, we have to, to get to the monastery. You have to give you a way to catch\nback our train, so don't care about you. So it was like the end of the world for us. Finally,\none of uh our colleague have an idea to take some handkerchiefs or our shirt, I don't\nremember, to make a knot to our uh chains and to tie it to our belts so the chain doesn't fall\ndown on our ankles here. So we try to do this for a while, but again start to fall down. So the\nworst moment probably, we walked two hours say, close to two hours, but I thought was\neternity. And then a funny moment happened when we went to this uh monastery. They\nhave a big barrack. Was not inside the monastery, was outside. The kind of place where\nthey kept probably some uh equipment to take uh care about the land. And they push inside.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nInside was other prisoners. One near other one I guess. And in the middle of this big barrack\nwas big barrel (ph). People make their needs from this barrel. And dirty\naround. And we were in there. Don't excited right now. I cannot believe this maybe. Was\nthat people, we couldn't breathe, couldn't do anything. But only very small space, space to\nlay down was this barrel. So everybody jump to lay down and to put their head on the wall\nof the barrel. I cannot tell you what feeling, when you feel happy, if you can say that,\nbecause we, we don't walk. Was end of the . On other end, where you were over\nthere, maybe wasn't like you were coming over there because they us. Was how you\ncall, bad, bad bad situation, but was I can see you meet him. He give you instruction. They\nsay yes. I say no. They say start to beat me in front of him. And finally, we, he indicate (ph)\nfor me that I know him, they try to bring this third one. Say they brought the third one to\nwitness against me, which I know. And I, I was surprised because the third was not an\nagent, was other colleague, was , was my connection. He made the declaration before\nthat he knew me. So he brought him to recognize me in front of the policeman. He come in\nfront of me, was two people, police, in empty room. You recall him. We look one\nanother eyes. And say no, I don't know who this 1s. I was, to you made a declaration against\nhim. You beated me to the death. They start to beat him again, in front of, know him. No, I\ndon't know him. This was most, most emotional part of which I remember like now, you\nknow, whatever.",
        "Q: Did they beat you?",
        "A: Yes. They use all kinds of system to, to put you down, to , to beat on uh on legs\nand other parts of the body. And other was times they manage you to kill or to, to uh arrest\nyour parents. This was other system to put pressure on you. And you know what happened.\nWas very, very afraid. But I can't say, maybe good luck or bad luck that we were caught at\nthe end of the war. So when the situation of war was clear for many people, local people,\nauthorities, they start to evacuate and they know that the German cannot win the war. They\ncouldn't win the war. There was already change and retreat toward Carpathians , to\nTranslyvania, to Berlin.",
        "Q: Did you parents move away?",
        "A: My parents were in the same town and they stayed in the same town.",
        "Q: They were not arrested with you?",
        "A: No. No. No. No. They suffered a lot you know. And uh they tried the best they can to help\nme, but there's nothing to do. To keep hope.",
        "Q: How did you meet this Traian that you describe in your manuscript? Who was he and how\ndid you meet him?",
        "A: Uh, I mentioned manuscript about this Traian or Trane. I don't know how to pronounce\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbecause was a very interesting person, very strange. Was a mixture of good and bad. But\nwas uh like an interesting story, OK. So being this guy, young man in 40's, I remember. He\nwas young guy in the same town I know. I remember like now that his father was an invalid\nfrom the first war and saved some license invalids from the war, first war, to sell cigarettes,\nyou know. Tobacco shops to have, to give a way to make a living for the, who are veterans.\nSo I know about him. I know him on the streets, maybe on the school. So one day in '40\nwhen the Iron Guard become very powerful, '40, I guess '40, maybe beginning of '41, I saw\nthis guy Triane, his Iron Guard uniform on the street. Green uniform, military uniform. And\nhe starts to yell and to beat some people who think they were Jewish. And for a while, at the\nend of the '40, maybe beginning of '41, the Iron Guard was part of the government of the\ndictatorship of General Antonescu, was most extremist right say wing, fascist wing. And\nsome places they put their people in charge of the security forces. The police we call them.\nSo this young man become the chief of security, of police in our town. Iron Guard security.\nOK. After a while, when uh Iron Guard was defeated by General Antonescu. It's a long\nstory. Many run out of the country and many disappear, there's a fight on the streets. It's a\nlong story, don't want it in details, but I didn't hear anything about same person called\nTraian. When I was arrested, and moved from our town to Gala_1 to prison, was by, moved\nby a uh truck, I saw the truck with other people was this guy Traian. After say three years\nmaybe. And I was surprised what he's doing with the people who fought against the\nGerman, because a part of Iron Guard. I didn't know, I couldn't ask him. Was dark, we went\nto the prison. After Gala_1, we was transferred to this monastery where was more free, so\nwe Start to talk between them. Talk to him, to talk to other people. And I asked one other uh\ncolleague who was with me in organization, what's doing this guy here because he was an\nIron Guard, and we fought against the Germans. And let's tell you his story shortly. And\nlooks first of all, he was condemned to death by uh fascist organization being an Iron Guard\nleader, and probably he killed somebody or something happened, I don't know. So he have a\nbad sentence, and in order to avoid, he ran out of the town and later on come back and he\nwas hiding with a neighbor who happened to be Jewish guy. He's former roommate or\ncolleague or something like that. So this Traian who was Iron Guard security chief and has a\ndeath penalty on his head was hiding, by in a Jewish family. After a while, one of the sons\nof the Jewish family was involved to some extent in this organization, anti-fascist\nmovement and they told to one of connections that they know they hiding this guy over\nthere to him. So one day they decided let's use him somehow because he's not Jews uh, and\nlet him try to go to send him to some camps in Russia with Jewish people, non-Jewish\npeople, communists, not communists, to help them, to send some money, some, some uh\npackages, some products or some grocery or some clothes. So he agreed to go again like a\nwhat you call underground to help the anti-fascist forces, put it this way. So he went a\ncouple of times to what those days was occupied by Germans to help, not to help, to uh\ntransmit some money, to transmit some food, some clothes, something to the people that\nwas in camp. One night before uh probably we was arrested, he decided to go out from\nhiding, probably to go in uh special house to have some lady relationship, with some\nprostitutes or some bordello or something. And he went over there and some policemen\naround recognize him, so they put him under surveillance and they follow him, and they\nfollow where he went. So the police, the fascist police start to survey the house and finally\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthey decided to arrest some people of the house, including him. So he went together with\nthis group and our group when all was the same time to the police. And he, he was again put\nunder trial and put uh inquire and put on the investigation, not like Iron Guard, but like\nhelping the anti-fascist movement. But he was all the time afraid that he was put there\nbecause he was an Iron Guard, so after a while we start to talk and I start to talk to him, and\nhe told very vague, not in detail, that he knows his past, he regret it, make a big mistake, and\nhe want to pay somehow and want to help the movement. And probably my feeling he was\na little opportunistic. He knew, he was smart guy. He knew that the situation would change\nanyhow, so it's better to have good relationship with uh anti-fascist groups. So after uh the\nGerman left and uh become independent uh country again if I can say, he was in charge for\na while like security chief, security force in the same town Bac_u but now like presence of\ncommunists. And happened he married a Jewish girl. But finally after a while, put it this\nway, was a lot of uh discussion, a lot of uh problem, the relation with others, not only with\nhim, Iron Guard people and uh fascist people who converted during the night to be\ndemocratic, to be communist and to help the communists. So he was, we found this true,\nexpelled from communist party and take out of his job and sent some place in our small\ntown to work like in accounting. But uh was pretty interesting story about him and uh how\nsome people are liberate during the war and before the war, how some people change the\ncolor of their shirt. Because I met in my life many, many kinds of people. Some people have\nsome convictions, something. And the keep their conviction, right or wrong, to the end of\ntheir life. Didn't want to change. Other, according to the circumstances, feel more safe for\nthem to, to change their convictions. To say I'm sorry for yesterday, but now I'm changed.\nI'm with you. So this happened many times and even now days you see many places over\nthe world the same, the same story. But was interesting you know how they were alright, the\npeople were alright.",
        "Q: You were in prison. Take it back to when you were in prison. Were you ever afraid that\nyour comrades under torture would tell what they knew about you?",
        "A: Yes, I was afraid, and specially was afraid about two guys which we worked together. But\nuh one, like I told you, he recognized but when he was brought in front of me, he\ndenied. And he continued to be a symbol of the human being because at this point he saved\nnot only his life, or may be my life, and I cannot, cannot tell what was my, my strong\nfeeling, how my, I cannot you what means this to me, absolutely know what many people\nunder the force, they give everything. They talk. They, you know. Other people, they keep\ntheir belief and their ideas you know. That's not easy way. So not many people probably. So.",
        "Q: Let's take it to the end of the war now. You have been taken out of prison. You are marched\nto where? The bombs are falling and you are being marched to where?",
        "A: At the end of the war, a couple of months, you know, the end of the war happened different\nplaces at different stages, you know.",
        "Q: For you.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: What happened from this place 1n prison in Ploe_ti, we were put in train and bring to our\ntown Bac _u again, and probably, I don't recall--maybe was July, or July or close to August,\nmaybe; it was '44. And was to station, the police station. The police station looked to us,\nand said you are free now but you don't have the right to move from city to the city. Every\nweek we have to report to us here, that you are here. So we went home. But the situation in\n'44 say in July in Moldavia was changed. Most of the authorities start to leave the town\nwhich leave and the front was very close, and every, basically we stayed home. We\ndidn't go out of the home, no where to go. People are afraid. And we start to hear the sounds\nof the artillery from Moldavia--from, say, city of Ia_1[Ger: Jassy], or closer--because the\nRussian army start to come closer and closer. So I remember like today, in the beginning of\nAugust, maybe middle of the August, all of a sudden in the morning, a big noise on the\nstreet again, like the same strange noise like in '39 we heard when the Polish troops came\nfrom Poland and we saw the war started. It's interesting. And we went out, again, in our\npajamas or whatever it was over there, and saw a lot of German troops running toward the\nedge of the city which goes towards Translyvania ,Carpathian mountins and local troop, and\nI saw a local authorities which I know start to ran. And everybody starts the Russians out on\nthe bridge, the Russians out on the bridge. Was a big river ,a bridge a couple of miles. So\nafter a couple of hours everything was uh silent. Some, only sounds of uh artilleries. A fight\nwas over there and nobody dared to go in the street. Nobody was able. So was a couple of\nhours from the morning, early morning till afternoon was a ghost city. Everybody was\nafraid, and all of a sudden around four o'clock, probably five o'clock, was some noise and\nsomebody start to tell some Russian troops are uh close to our city. People went out to the\nbridge, only bridge which come from Ia _ 1 to our city. So we saw the Russian uh troops over\nthere coming. And everybody start on the street to go, and everybody, this is the true, start to\ncry and start to kiss one another. The German is gone. The fascist is gone. So this is a kind\nof liberation that you have.",
        "Q: What did you do? What happened to you after liberation?",
        "A: After liberation happened many things in our town. Understand this. Number one, we come\ntogether, a group of people like was together, fought together in Germany, in group, only\ngathered together and we went to Jewish community center. And then we find people are\nalready over there which were some representative I guess of some political party, some\ncommunist party, and they start to organize the life. Was the first thing they told us to do, to\ngo immediately and to clean, because it's more difficult to say, because the same time we\nsaw the Russian uh troop, Russian army goes to the city day and night. And a lot of uh\nwounded soldiers coming back and tanks and horses. The horses that was taken for the\nRussian soldiers, but was like uh a big mess over there. A lot of uh garbage everywhere.\nAnd everybody was afraid there could be some epidemic immediately. So they told us, they\ntold me, you be in charge now for next two days to clean the streets. I don't know what to\ndo, you don't have anything. I don't know. Take, you have here ten people, or twenty\npeople. Go and take whoever you can and find some carriage and start to, to grab the\ngarbage. So we did for a couple of days all kinds of tricky things to get some garbage, to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthrow away in the river. There's a river across over there. And then other things what\nhappened which I remember, start some fires in the city. Somebody put some fire, some\nbuildings in downtown. Up to now I don't know who or how, it was very curious. But was\nsome fires and was not uh firefighters over there because they were evacuated because the\nRussians came. So we start to, to fight this uh fires over there, days and nights over there.\nTo bring water and to try uh hoses. One of the first activities we did over there. And uh then\nwe Start with some kind of administration they start to put together. And this happened in all\nthe part of the Moldavia when the Russian came. Immediately the communist was in control\nas they start to organize the administration. And other thing interesting is, again, now is\nhistory, uh during the war was a lot of prisoners from Germany, from Romania, from other\ncountry who fight against the Russian, so Russian organize this prisoner, some special\narmy, most of them. I don't know. And they make like a Polish army who was trained in\nRussia and probably German army who was, and the Romanian army. And when they come\nto Romania, they put some people from this uh Romanian army which trained in Russia in\nadministration of the territory. And they asked to help the administration, all kinds of small\nthings related from clean the street to transportation to guide the transportation, all kinds of,\npostal service to start was cut something over there.",
        "Q: You brought some pictures with you. Let's take a look at a couple of them. We have about\nfour minutes. Um. The one on top is a particularly interesting one. Let's take a look at the\none on top.",
        "A: OK. Can I look here. (Technical conversation). Now here 1s a picture, 1f you don't know.\nWe like to go to our neighbors, a lady, our neighbors. Always she has nice dogs and horses\nover there. And here, that's my sister Rose, my brother Mike and myself here. That's before\nthe war, many years.

And one day we get here for a birthday over there. And most of the\npeople who are here, I show later in a big picture, went to this Jewish school organized by\nJewish community center and many are now in the United States, some are in Israel. A few\nprobably are still in my town, and I don't know the fate of other ones.",

        "A: Uh, my name is Paul Matasovski. And uh I was born in a small town in Moldavia--\nRomania--called Bac_u, in December 1933.",
        "A: Uh, well, uh it's an interesting story is my family. My father--Leonid, his name was--he was\nborn in Russia, near Kiev. And he came to Romania in 1917, probably with the Russian\nArmy. Nineteen...maybe early 1915, 1916; and after the Russian revolution in 1917, he\ndecided to stay in Moldavia. It's a small town, Bac_u. So he was a young man, and uh he\nwas interested in uh automobiles and cars. At that time was very new things, cars. So in,\neven in the Army, if I recall my father's stories, he was in a unit who handled car repairs. So\nhe was a kind of specialist in cars. So he starts some, some kind of work in car repair in my\nsmall town. My mother, Maria, was born in another small town, my guess, called Falticeni,\nin northern Moldavia. And with her parents come this small town Bac_u.",
        "A: Uh, yes, uh, the town of Falticeni is F-A-L-T-I-C-E-N-I, approximately. So we are close to\nsay Falticeni. And uh her father, if I recall, my grandfather, he died before the Second War,\nand she had a sister who uh died during the war. Was a lot of diseases at that time. And she\nwas with her mother in the small town Bac_u. So my father once walked downtown\napproximately where my mother lived and saw nice girl outside in front of the house and\nstarted to talk to her. And he came a couple of times, the same way, because he has the\nfeeling that he likes her. So shortly after probably a couple of months, if I recall, my father\ntold to my mother that he wants to talk to her mother. And why to talk to her mother?\nBecause I want to ask your hand. I want to marry you. So it's a kind of excitement, and uh,\nin principle they agreed to marry and start to see more often. And probably after one years,\nthey married. So uh, my family life started I guess in the 20's after the war. I don't know if I\nwas clear enough, but this is our start, the whole family.",
        "A: It was interesting. Uh, now after so many years, when I recall how it was to be a child, it's,\nmaybe it's different and my last years I went, and I grow and I leave and I work in very big\ncities, but at that time, even I know that it was a small city. For me, for all the children,\nBac_u was a very, very big city. And if I can recall, maybe I was when I recall first time, I\nmay be five years old or four years old. I went to kindergarten. We start to play on the\nstreets. We always, my friends, we tried to play on our backyards and front yards. And again\nthe streets, we, we played, we used to spend lots of time on the streets running and playing\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand all kinds of things. As I recall our street was a dirty street and we liked at that time\nwhen it was raining, to go under the rain, and after the big rain on the street was a lot of uh\ncreeks, water creeks. Running water. And we liked to, to run uh barefoot and to\nmake all kinds of paper boats to throw away. And was a lot of fun. What can I tell you. At\nthat age. And to know for sure no matter what happened, we have to go home very early in\nthe evening. To be ready for dinner. Was a tradition, probably in our family, other families,\nfor families to be together for lunch, for dinner, for whatever. Whenever we eat. And I\nremember my mother told me once, you can go where ever want, approximately, but be\nhome at five o'clock or six o'clock, what time was for the dinner. So was, I have very nice\nfeelings and we didn't have any very big problems at that time. We didn't know about\nproblems. We tried to plan you know. Like every kids every where, you know, have the\nsame, probably saw the kind of beeing. We were no different from other people, other\nyoung people, other kids.",
        "A: Bac_u even was a small town, had a big Jewish community over there. And uh, the Jewish\ncommunity, even some section of the city, like uh I cannot say ghetto, but uh some two,\nthree, four streets, famous because the Jews live over there. And most of the middle class\nand maybe poor Jewish people live in the same section of the town. And other streets in\nother part were lot of Jewish families over there. So uh first time I uh, I start to, to think\nabout to be Jews, when we go for the holy days to the synagogue. My parents, especially my\ngrandmother, uh, start to take, to take us, me and later on my brother, for the holy days in\nthe fall and the spring to the synagogue. So we start to, to, to know about the Jewish life and\nto know about uh other Jewish children over there, and what I remember, which was a lot of\nfun for us, for uh Passover, Passover, there are two things which I recall today. We use\nsome special uh dishes, special plates for Passover, and we kept in attic, so and packing all\nkinds of paper. I notice my mother, before the Passover, told us to go in attic and to bring\nthe dishes. And so was very big event to go, you know, to climb, in the attic and to come\nback. Another thing which I recall, besides other things, to get uh matzos, what you call\nthis, matzos? Was, you couldn't buy in the stores like we go today in all the stores and buy,\nyou know, we want for uh Passover. It was only one manufacturer where the Jewish\ncommunity center. We have a big Jewish community center, as I recall, and you have to go\nand they start to manufacture during the, before the Passover. So was a big line. You don't\nhave to uh to make a reservation. Everybody comes and stay on the line and take the matzos\nhome. So it was a big, big event to go and to go as a cart, as a carriage, people to take the\nmatzos to bring home. And other interesting uh story that I remember, may be like a\ntradition, I don't know what. Before the Passover, always, my parents bought new clothes\nfor us, you know. So they bought all the time you know, clothes. But for Passover, it was,\nwe were kids with this and new clothes, and go in the street and everybody wanted to show.\nLook to me how good clothes I'm wearing. Kids, but everybody wanted to show what kind\nof new clothes as we have over there, so it was kind of fun, you know, for Passover. And\nuh, later on, I start to go to the school, to elementary school and uh, to junior high school.\nThe system of schools is different than here and now. But first time, we uh found 1n our\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nclasses some Jewish and non-Jewish kids, and we knew some families in neighborhood. So\nuh many, we start to make friends, it's true non-Jewish and Jewish friends. But the time\nwent by, and the more after the year start to appear some sign of anti-Semitism. The more\nthe Jewish kids, Jewish students come together, because they sometimes was the object of\nsome bad words, maybe bad action. After a, after a while some uh Jewish students\nsometimes start to congregate, to gatherings during breaks and uh after work and before\nwork, so uh was a big connection between uh I can say Jewish students of all ages.",
        "A: I guess happened many things, like in the all world and uh I was very young, uh young boy\nat the time. But already I remember very well in my family, my father and I guess in that\nperiod was '33, '34, was the first trme a radio in our house and we (were) not wery rich, I\nguess, like middle class, we didn't have a radio, so he bought a second-hand radio. And we\nstart to listen to the radio. And we started at that time to hear more and more about\nGermany, about Hitler, about what's going on. So the people start to, to talk and I heard in\nour family, talking with some friends, talking about what happened in Germany. And\npeople already become to be anxious about what the future will bring because we had some\nfeelings, not to I say we, we kids, but Jewish people said something's starting to, to, to\nchange. It's a quietness and it's a quiet life which was before over there. And if I remember\nagain was a lot of articles in the press at the time about the events. And uh, was some kind\nof discussion now and people start to talk more, but was only talk at this time about\nGermany, about Hitler, about the situation in our town.",
        "A: Now we come to the period of time when I guess I remember most about what happened\nand to my recollection I have more lively now, you know. And matter of fact, even before,\nbefore the war started, the war started in '41, if Iremember June, I say 21, '41, the war\nstarted, the German started to cross the Soviet Union's border. But before '41 already the\nsituation was very tense. Number one, in '39, '38, when Hitler start to act aggressively and to\nenter Austria in '38 and Czechoslovakia if I remember, we were more anxious and many\npeople, many Jewish people, start to think to emigrate from Romania. And our lot of town\nis the young organization over there, and uh, always uh Zionist uh movement try to\nconvince people to immigrate to Palestine even before the war. By the events that\nhappening before the war, 1n '38, '39, the international events start to show to the people,\nspecially to the Jewish people, to find a way to escape in case Hitler would come close to\nour borders. But between or besides the international conditions, uh domestic conditions\nchange. Some fascist organizations like Iron Guard and other organizations start to become\nmore, more aggressive. And they start to take action against the Jewish people. They start\non the street to, to beat some Jewish people in '39 with some, some, some uh big uh, uh\ngrow of this organization encouraged by Germans, by other groups. So in '30, '39 the\nsituation start to be very tense for all the people. And I have to, to tell you no probably and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nI'm sure that when the German went to Poland and occupied in September, I don't know,\nSeptember Ist if I recall, beginning of September, we heard by the radio, but after two, three\ndays already the Polish troop start to run from Poland and to come toward Moldavia to\nRomania. And one day, one morning, I remember like now, it was four in the morning, we\nheard a large noise, big noise on the, my street, and like a big column of tanks or heavy\nvehicles start to moving. Unusual noise for a small city. So everybody went out. It was four,\nfive in the morning. And we saw some columns of trucks, loaded with uh Polish soldiers.\nDirty, uh thirsty, very very uh tired, like escaped from, from the war. And the first thing they\nalways asked for water, some food and was a very very depressed situation. It would\ndepress anybody. And to know for yourself as the first time what the war means. We saw\non our streets, and was in '39, and uh the Polish troops start to, to get out of the vehicle, ask\nfor more food. They start to trade something, want it to be free, and there's long story what\nhappens uh Polish troop. But began the first sign when we saw the war in our uh, in the\nmiddle of our house. So we understand that the situation aggravate and aggravate more and\nmore. So even before the war started in '40 other international events and domestic events\nstarting to, to, to uh, to occur over there and the Iron Guard and other fascist organizations\nbecome more powerful. And the political situation start to uh, to be very tense and as we\nknow, in '40 and beginning on '41 was a big change. The king was take over from the\nthrone, was uh expelled out, and uh General Antonescu the power and installed a\nvery fasciest dictatorship together with Iron Guard, which was very extremist, but after the\nwar start a fight for many reasons, not now the place to go to tell between Iron Guard and\nGeneral Antonescu. And General Antonescu become very powerful and in charge of the\nsituation. And he start uh, '40, end of the '40, beginning of '41, to take some uh very drastic\nmeasures against the Jewish people over there. So before the war start, I can say that we felt\nstrong already the impact of fascist dictatorship government in our country. I can elaborate\nmore if you want what happened.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. This is other interesting story. Like I told you when uh in our city and in other\nprobably city, there was a lot of uh Zionist organizations. Young organizations, not young,\nand other political organizations, non-Jewish, with democratic tendency for more kinds of\nuh political uh beliefs. And they understand, uh many people understand that the time\ncomes to do something. It's not only to wait to see what happen will happen. So there\nstarted a lot of discussion between uh young people, maybe old people too, to find a way to\norganize something to do. And uh, specially I can say, in uh '40, the government, the fascist\ngovernment, uh issue a lot of laws against the Jewish people. And one of them between\nmany was a uh forbidding children, students, Jewish students was expelled from the public\nschool. And here comes a very, very interesting situation position of the Jewish community,\nbecause when all the students, Jewish students, were expelled from the school, immediately\nwas the Jewish local, Jewish leaders and the rabbis have big meetings what to do. So they\ndecided again maybe my recollection time-wise not exactly month or year, but and '40,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbeginning or end or the fall of '40 or beginning of '41, the Jewish community sent or\ndecided to organize own school for Jewish students. They promised to find the space, to\nfind the teachers, and was a big problem. And I recall something about they decide to give\nthe space and other space available was the Jewish community center and start to organize\nthe first high school in the, in our town. And there a lot of professional people who never in\ntheir lives they were teachers. They offer their service to be teachers. They got engineers, we\nhave architects, and maybe other professional people, lawyer I remember, who become\nteachers. So we start to have our, our schools. So we start an hour of school to discuss a lot\nabout what has to be done and besides uh learning and teaching and the teachers, the\nstudents start to talk about to do something. So we start to organize some group, as a\nmixture of Zionist young people, non-Zionist people, and to have some friends who are\nnon-Jewish in other school. And we start to talk to them as much as possible. It was very\ndifficult to start to make connections. And was other political parties, democrat parties start\nto, to, to uh enter, to think about organize some. At that point we decide to organize some\ngroup over there to do something because we have some signal from abroad what start to\nhappen to the Jewish people in uh Czechoslovakia and Poland. So we start to organize some\ngroup and to find a way to fight the German. Because now in the '41 the war started, the\nJewish people more restricted in movements. They were confined to their home, specially to\nthe Jewish young people, specially, and uh sent in uh the labor camp and mandatory factory\nto dig trenches for the war. Uh, they close the hospital, public hospital, to the Jewish uh\npatients, etc. etc. So was started to, to, talk and to think to do something, and we start to\norganize some groups. At one point between Jewish young people and non-Jewish young\npeople over there.",
        "A: Now this is very, very interesting uh question because basic is the beginning. The most\nimportant thing I guess, thinking now, we didn't, we didn't have any information about what\nwas going on in the war because all the press was already the first of all, was uh interdict\nradio sets was taken from the Jewish people. All the Jewish people has to give_ beginning\n'40, '41, the radio sets. So was not a way to, to listen to the radio. The press was under the\ncontrol, and they publish only what was interest, in the German interest was this way. And\nbefore the war and after the war starting to publish only war, German what you call\ncommuniques about the war. So one of the first things we sought was to find what was\ngoing on. So some, our friends have some connections, have some friends who are non-\nJewish and start to, to have uh networks to find information what is going on through the\npeople who had radios, have information based on their position, parents' position. And I\nremember even was two, three Jewish people who interested in the electronic like today and\ntwo of them decided to build from, from scratch, from nothing some small radio uh\nequipment in order to listen what is going on. So this one was the first action, and we start\nfrom time to time to have some uh, some news. They succeeded to uh get some information\nthrough some if I recall BBC from London and from probably from Russia they catch some,\nsome news over there. But the interesting part with that uh the young people who, who put\ntogether this radio, during the day they dismantled the radio because if some police came in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhouse, they don't find the radio even and hiding the pieces and during the evening they put\ntogether. Was a very difficult operation. Basically, this is a fact, that was not uh parts put\nthis way, and together parts was a big problem. So the first action was to get information\nand the, the second part was to uh disseminate this information. So we start to write the\nnews in some small piece of paper and to give to other young people to, to read. So was a\nshade of transmission of the news. And I recall at one point, we start to find many ways to\nhide this small paper on which we, we wrote some, some news. So we start to take for\nexample, some soaps and cut in half the soaps and make some, some holes, and put together\nand keep the uh hard papers, small papers, and using the paper and to give the soaps. Or\nother way to hide them and to transmit them as material some all kind of doors at one point\nI remember. Some, some toys we used. So this is the first part of the action, was related to\nknowing what was going on and where we stand. Later on we decided to, to start to do\nmore, more action, more uh specially action against if we could the German, and if not the\nGerman uh troops, against the German uh place where they manufacture war products. So\nin our town was a couple of factory. If I recall one was textile factory manufacturing textile\nto prepare to uh, for uh military uniforms say. Was a big factory prepare leather, paper and\nother kinds of industry. And all this industry at one point works like forced labour, a lot of\nJewish young people. And sure non-Jewish people were there. But many, many workmen\nwere sent to fight against the Russians, the front. So a lot of young Jewish and young, non-\nJewish people, young people fifteen years old was brought to this factory to work. So in this\nplace is start to have some connection and to start to do all kind of sabotage. Say, if I recall,\nto slow down the production for example. To start to uh, to break some machines over\nthere. And was very, very, uh, at that time very audacious actions. Was not maybe very big,\nwe don't blow bridges, but we start a movement to organize the young people to fight\nagainst the Germany and this movement start to extend to non-Jewish. Some non-Jewish\nyoung people refused to go in the Army to fight the war along the Germans. So uh all kind\nof action. At one point was a discussion to start to do something about the German, and\nmany nights, uh many Jewish young people and non-Jewish young people succeeded to go\nsome place close. For example where the Germans keep their trucks, and to open the tanks,\nthe gas tank and to put say some sand inside. And we discuss at one point to start to bring\nsome small pieces of wood planks with nails and to put 1t some place where you know that\nthe Germans uh vehicle will go through in some places. But was interesting because uh,\nmany people at that time was divided I can say, how to act. Some, now, maybe appear very\neasy you know when you talk as far as the part but at that time to go in the street was a big\ndeal to do. Uh to meet some people over there was very difficult because of curfew after six\no'clock no Jewish on the street. And the Jewish has to wear some special sign, the star of the\nJuda as they call it. But uh at one point, maybe, this is interesting as I...(PHRASES\nMISSING)...but uh at one point uh many people thought its maybe better nothing to do\nbecause no matter what you are doing we exposed to something. And was a good feeling\nthat later, uh sooner or later, the German would be defeated and all American Army will\ncome to liberate our part or maybe Russian will be come first over there. So anyways they\nwill come, so why to uh sacrifice our lives. But was a strong feeling among many people\nthat have to do something. You know how many people died towards the front, how many\npeople died in the camps, so many people feel to do to fight against the Germans and oh, the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\npeople, the young people, I talking about young people, maybe not only young people. They\ndon't care at that point about their life because they want to sacrifice to do something.",
        "A: That's a good question because uh this question applied to, let's put it this way, to the Jewish\npopulation. What happens to the Jewish population? And I have to make a short or long\nparanthesis about this. The Jewish situation in Romania during the war was different than in\nPoland, in Hungary, in Czechoslovakia, in eastern uh western Europe even because of\npolitical situation, because the General Antonescu could become an ally to Hitler and he\ngave everything including a big army to fight along the German army. They kept, the fascist\ngovernment in Romania, they kept some uh power in uh day by day administration of the\nterritory, of the territory. And they was in charge to solve the Jewish problem over there. So\nthey decided for many many reasons, don't to send the Jewish people to Auschwitz. To use\nthem, to put them to work as a factory. Was more useful. They can because they took a lot\nof young people and not young people to put in the army to fight against the uh, along the\nGermans against the Russians. So a lot of factories, they don't have manpower, labor. So\nthey want to use the Jewish people like a labor this work factory as they put a lot of people\nover there. Other Jewish people, let's say young people not only, was sent to build trenches,\nto build uh defense uh lines, at the front. So just speaking, most of the Jewish people were\nnot sent to death camps. Was used to work. Some were sent in different camps 1n the\nterritory which the German took from Russia, in the Ukraine, and maybe come back, maybe\nnot. They start to arrest a lot of Jewish leaders and non-Jewish leaders and to put on uh, in\nprison. But was a small way to make some small, small amount of money. Because when\nthey keep the people, the Jewish people, working in the factories, they give something. They\npay like a very minimum, very minimum salary. I don't want to express how much was, but\nsay enough to buy some piece of bread, was a bread twist or to buy some uh cornmeal or to\nbuy other product which was if there was a market. And other interesting thing I guess, now\ntalking with you it's in my mind, a lot of product came from the farmer who work with the\nland, and before the war the tradition was the farmer who has some land or farm, two, three,\nfour, five miles from the cities, they come everyday in the city to market. Special market. Or\nthey have their customers like to bring the milk, to bring the eggs, to bring whatever, the\nchicken. And I remember, say in our family, was a special farmer which come every day,\nbefore the war, every day they bring the milk in front of our door, some meat sometimes,\nfruits, vegetables, so was some relationship. When the war started this farmer, or some\nfarmers, continued to come to the city to sell their products and many times they help the\nJewish people. They say start to give some products. They don't have too much because\nsome members of their families was taken in the army to go to the war, but uh they continue\nto, to work the land and they come with the less product to the market. But was some way\nto, to get something. And the Jewish people started to sell what ever they had to the people\naround. This only because big deal. They start to sell maybe their furniture, they some goods\nwhatever. Maybe they have some gold. Maybe they have, whatever the Jewish people start\nto sell, to sell, to sell for nothing to, to buy the main product to uh, to survive. So was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsome, some kind of connection to get some food over there. But the problem what\nimportant first to keep alive and good health because, if I recall, the public hospital closed to\nthe Jewish patients say so the Jewish community start to organize some clinic and to use\nsome Jewish doctors to give uh consultation over there. They start to, to get a way to get\nsome medicine, but was more and more, become more uh uh seldom to get medicine. We\ncan't get medicine, we can't get medical assistance to get an operation we need. So many\npeople start even to die, to, to loose their health because of the conditions uh, medical\nconditions over there. And because they cannot feed the family, suppose the young people\ndidn't have food. So the most important thing was to keep alive. Everybody everyday was\nthe fight to keep, to keep alive. So was not, not very easy but was not enough to eat. But\npeople survived. Was most important to, to have to drink, like water or you know, some,\nsome food to, to, to eat over there. And maybe other thing I remember maybe could be a\npart of this survival, I don't know how right or wrong I am. The fascist government start to\ntake the houses from the Jewish people. And this is, a Jewish family has a house is ten\nrooms whatever. Most of the time they took all the house, or nine rooms, and they let the\nJewish owner to stay in one room over there. Five, six people in one room. And they give\nthe rest of the non-Jewish people who occupy the room. Sometimes, being a small town,\nmost of the houses, they have some garden around. So they start the Jewish people to, to uh\nto garden a little. To put some potatoes, to have I remember for some time, sometimes\nmaybe some tomatoes to put over there. Some stuff to use, every possible to survive, to get\nsome food over there. But the health is a problem and everybody was afraid every day\nsomebody was, family would be taken to sent far away in special detachment, uh special uh\nformation to dig uh fortification and many people didn't come back. Was taken to say\ndifferent part of the country to work in the uh forced labor in the factory. And many didn't\ncome back. We don't know why. So uh the most important was to, to keep, to be alive and\nto be like your family to go through, through the war. And something else which probably\ncould happened that I try to explain now is maybe some people are involved in and uh\nhistory research will go further. But we know in '42 starting, Germans start to, to be\ndefeated on the Russian front and was a discussion about to open the second front by United\nStates uh Army with uh Allies. So uh when uh the situation become worse and worse on the\neastern front, Russian front, Zionists start to come back, and many wounded soldiers come\nback. They brought very bad feeling to their family. So non-Jewish family start to\nunderstand, and not before maybe they understood too that the war would be lost. So they\nsuffered, the non-Jewish people suffered a lot, even if they are non-Jewish, they give their\nuh children to go to the war. They lost their children. Was tough for them even to, to get\nfood over there. So many non-Jewish people start to, to, to help the Jewish people. Some\nneighbor would give sometimes say uh a bottle of milk to help, a loaf of bread, start to be\nsome connection again because the people understood that on one hand the Jewish suffered,\nbut they suffered too. It's not like to help the Jewish people, and maybe was, maybe, maybe\nwas some opportunistic situation because they say this good, good relationship with the\nJewish after the war. Who knows, you know. So uh the situation was tough, and many non-\nJewish people took out many special fascist organization, took advantage, took all the\nJewish business, all the Jewish factory, all the big Jewish house, or small Jewish houses, so\nthe only hope of the Jewish people was to, to get out of the war and we know that there be\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nor due to the uh American Army or western army will come to liberate our territory or to the\nRussian army, start the offensive about the Germans over there. So every day, every minute\nstart to follow the news, where 1s the front 1s moving. And I recall like now when was\ndowntown, our town, was a big map of the Russian front showing how deep the German\ntroops and others to penetrate in Russia. How they move from say uh eastern, uh western\npart of the Russia through Kiev to Caucasus to Moscow to Leningrad. And everyday in '41,\nthe line of the front moving further and further. And we look at the map sometimes and we\nwere very afraid. The further the German went, uh further our our hope was diminished,\nright. But after a while we knew the situation was changed. The Germans start to uh to be\ndefeated. But the arrow was a sign on this map remains the same place. They didn't move to\nshow how far they come back. So we start to, to find every way to get information, were we\nstand. Each day the front came closer, closer to our uh land, to this small city. So uh, the\nmore we knew about the news, the uh Russian Army come closer to our border, the more\nwe think that maybe we will escape. But we hope at the same time and everybody was, a lot\nof discussion, about the opening of the second front in Europe. And was a lot of discussion\nabout American troops would come through the Greece at one point, to the, to open the\nsecond front. And to come to Greece, by the Romania to cut the German and probably the\nRussian to go toward west. But as you know, doesn't happen and the Russian came first.",
        "A: Uh, well, at one point say in the '40's, '41, I was in the uh high school, Jewish high school,\nin '42. I start to be involved with a lot, with this organization who start to fight against the\nfascist regime. And in the '40, end of '42, '43 probably, I was sent to work in a factory.\nTextile factory. So I was a worker over there. And being over there I was involved together\nwith other young people over there in kind of organization to sabotage the production and\nwe try together to connect other people in other factories and other schools to start to act\nagainst the German occupation. But at one point, say I was over there and basically the\nnight I came home. Some people were sent to work outside of the city. They have to stay to\nsleep in special barracks. But some people work in the town, had the permission to come\nhome, which was a better situation. So basically I come home every night. I left the home in\nthe morning, I came - but in eight, in uh '43, in the '43, in the fall of '43, part of our\norganization was discovered by police, by security forces. And we start to be followed. So\nwe stop for a while our activities.",
        "A: Basically, we start at one point like I told you before to spread the news. One of the big\nactivities, to spread the news, to try to find out, to write what is going on at the front. And to\nput in all kinds, to work on a way to transmit this news, small papers. We started in the\nfactory to sabotage say the equipment, the heavy equipment. We started to dismantle some,\nsome uh part of the equipment. Uh we start to cut some textiles over there. Uh we start to\nput to prepare outside the factory some planks, some wood with nails and we start to from\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ntime to time to go close to some vehicle, German vehicle. Not German vehicle who went to\nthe front, to put the sand or even to sabotage the tires, was over there. So this kind of uh\nactivity was basically, and uh in '40, uh, was end of '43, the police discovered. They have an\nagent which introduced in our organization, and to the agent that we work with him,\nprobably was wired to some people. He knew a lot so the spring of '44 they arrest uh five,\nsix people in our organization and I was sent to the prison, to the jail. And I was\ninterrogated. I was tortured. I was there beaten to, to give information about other people.\nFinally, we, was in the spring of '44...",
        "A: OK. So basically I was arrested in the spring of '44. And I was in our local police\ninterrogated. And after a while in the same time after two or three weeks, they decided to\nevacuate the police headquarters because the front start to move in '40, in the spring of '44\nvery close. And Moldavia was the first part to come under the Russian army. So they start to\nevacuate. The government tell uh offices, authorities. So decided to send us another place to\nfinish interrogation and to prepare the paper to be uh, to court. So we was sent to a city call\nGala_1, on the Danube River. And over there starts some interrogations and start to prepare\nbased on declarations made by uh the agent, the informant agent against us in the court.\nBecause we fight against the Nazi, you can't fight against a dictatorship, Romanian\ndictatorship. But meantime, the war start to be closer and closer. And they, try to remember,\nwith some a lot of planes, war planes from Russia start to fly over the city and maybe some\nAmerican flights. So every day, every night was some Allied movement, what you call it,\nair (air raid), air raids was over there. So one day they decide it's not safe. So they decided to\nsend us, this group of young, was not only young people because we met other people over\nthere, to move from this prison to other prison more safe and prepare to go to the court. Was\na city called Ploe ti. Ploe ti, was a very famous because of oil fields over there. And one\nnight they took irons, they put chains on our legs, and chain our uh arms, and sent to other\nprison. But in fact was not kind of regular prison, was a monastery as was transformed in a\nprison like this. And we stay over there waiting for the trial. Was in uh uh '44. And in the\nspring of '44, toward May '44, start the Russian, recall the Russian front was uh broken, the\nRussian victories against the Germans. They come very close. They, they took uh Kiev.\nThey took Ukraine. They come close to the Romanian border, to Bessarabia, on one hand.\nOn the other hand, the American aircraft start to bomb the Ploe_ ti air fields over there. And\nfrom our place we saw many times the American planes coming bombing Ploe_ti. We were\nvery happy any time we saw the planes bombing Ploe_ti. We knew that the war had come to\nthe end. We don't know how close we are to the end of the war. So uh one day, in the\nspring, wait first of all, in Gala_1 even, we was kept in every, everybody in different cell\nalone. Was cement on the floor, nothing, was a piece of wood or something we slept over\nthere. Was a, how you call it, is a piece of uh, an opening which you can't make our need,\nput it this way, and once or twice a day they come to give some bread or some water, that's\nall. And was very, very bad. Most of the people become sick over there. Was, was the\nspring of '44 if I recall and we cannot talk to anybody over there. Any connections. The first\ntime we talked to our people, our uh colleagues which we were together, was the transport\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfrom uh Gala i to Ploe ti, was the train. We stand, we cannot sit because of our chains. We\nsit together, or stand together, will start to talk. Anyway, we become very sick when we\ncome to Ploe ti and Ploe_ ti in comparison with Gala _1 was a nice place because being a\nmonastery we have the right like everybody there, to walk out in the garden over there.\nThere was some place under surveillance but one hour per day or one hour every day. So\nwas a big change for us. And, and this uh place, we could talk a little more free with other\nprisoners. Was not only political prisoners, how you call it, maybe they were criminals,\nmaybe whatever they were, but they had some information about the war. And one day we\nfind out that the Ploe_ti was bombed. We saw them very heavily that uh, uh front was again\nbroken Moldavia as the Germans started to retreat. Uh through Carpathian mountains\ntowards Translyvania in Germany. And then unexpected for us, one day, I saw the, we saw\nthat the people over there who uh ran the prison start themselves to pack and to go. And\nthey told us they would take us to our city back. So one day we were put together in a car\nand went to station, from station went to, by the train to our city, Bac_u. They could free us\nbasically. Because the front is broken. Everybody takes care about themselves. We had\nsome good luck. In other place, in other place, before the Russian came, I heard they killed\nthe prisoners over there. On uh other places, they keep the prisoner to the last moment and\nthe Russian troops liberated them. OK. So basically, basically, uh as the international\nsituation, there is a war help us to be liberated from the prison.\nEnd of Tape #1\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nTAPE #2",
        "A: At beginning of the war, if I recall, that's '41, and before the war even, when they start to\nissue a lot, many law against the Jews, one of the law, besides many, was that the Jewish we\ncannot move from one city to another. They are confined where they were. More important,\nin order to uh have the possibility, to monitor the Jewish movement and to, to, uh to get a\nbetter from their point of view, the fascist government, a better possibly to, to uh to keep\ncontrol of the Jewish population, they order that all the Jewish people from small town\naround our town, for example, to go and to go, to come in the big city, like our city. So a lot\nof Jewish people, and there were thousands and thousands, left their small towns, which\nwere 20, 40, 100 miles, and they were evacuated in our cities. They left everything. They\ncome alone, with some carriage or they walk sometimes. And they have some relatives\nwhere they stayed, like us. We had some relatives came in our house and we, we gave a\nroom and was uh two adult and two children. Another Jewish family gives their house and\ntheir rooms as a Jewish community center organized. So uh at beginning of the war, the\nJewish people were around and concentrate in some big cities or small cities, but, in order to\nbe easy to be controlled. And was interdicted to move from one place to other place. The\nJewish people could not move.",
        "A: At beginning of the war, some Jewish were deported and some special camps, not in\nGermany, in the Romanian territory and later on, in uh the Russian territory. The fascist\ngovernment build some camps in the Russian territory, in Bessarabia and other part of the\nDniester, the river Dniester over there. But when they start to deport, they started uh some\nJewish people was more uh known for their opinion against a, before the war, against the\nGermans. So they start to deport in non-Jewish uh people who belong to some uh political\nparty like was say some social democratic party. Communist party. They brought all\nCommunists which they know and start to deport and put in uh, in prison. Over there. Some\nwas put, they took like, this is interesting now, they took as the beginning of the war, some\nhostages in our city including I remember my father. They took by random or some reason\nthe police to be sure that at beginning of operations uh Jewish don't do something wrong to\nthe whole territory authorities over there. They put in special uh special places. They took a\nschool, if I remember, and put some, they call hostages, to take Jewish hostages and non-\nJewish hostages. And they start to uh tease (ph) them. See I remember because my father\nwas for two or three months, and we were not sure what at the beginning was their intention\nbecause after two, three months, they liberated some, liberated some people from the\nhostage places. And they took other hostages. And some hostages were even not liberated.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThey were sent in un some camps again in the Romanian territory, in Bessarabia if I recall,\nand uh later on in uh Russian territory. And they organized some, some special prisons.\nThey sent people over there, from these hostages. But after a while I, probably after six,\nseven months, I don't remember exactly, the system of hostages was stopped over there. So\nwas not way to go from one city to the other. Some Jewish people were taken and sent to\nthe factory, the local factory, and some were sent outside the city.",
        "A: OK. Like I told at the beginning of the war, I was in the school, the Jewish school. The\nJewish community organized a school, very or best thing could for young Jewish people\nover there to continue their education. And after a while in '40, '43 probably, beginning of\n'43, I was taken to work in the uh the factory. Like uh a mandatory labor work, they call. So\nI went over there and I start to work like a laborer, like a textile laborer. At the beginning\nthey give a kind of training, how to use the textile equipment over there, very simple.",
        "A: This is interesting question. We have some uh, some friends even in the school. And one\nday one my friends, and there was a general system which worked probably, he start to talk\nto me more and more and talked about what represent the German occupation, what\nrepresent the German war, against become the Russian, how's our situation and start to uh\nconvince me, I guess, we have to do something. And as the beginning, I can't say my friend\ndidn't tell me about any organization. He want to convince me that he has to do something.\nThe first stage of you know, uh, his work with me. I have to convince me to do something.\nAnd he talk, and he start to give me some books to read. Was other things at one point,\norganization, some, some German book, if I recall, , American book, Upton\nSinclar, it'sa book _. OK. Uh we have some books by Russian, also Maxim Gorki they\nstart to give us, uh some French also if I recall, Jaures, if I recall. So give some books, start\nto discuss, and after a couple of months, like very casual discussion right, uh he told, hey, if\nyou agree that let's do something, let's do something, already there's organization you know,\nin school here. We are doing something. We can get together. A lot of people think I got it,\nwe have to do something or the German. So uh in this way he introduce me to one other\nmember of organization, but I want to tell you something here, because now I talking with\nyou start to recall something. Because of dictatorship, because of the terror, was not an\norganization like today we say hey, hundred people. Let's make organization. Let's have a\nmeeting, call a meeting. No. Was some rules, and one of the rules of the organization and\non work on the fight against Germany is that one member has to know only other member\nthey contact. So uh, if you were my contact, say to whom I talk, I know only you. And I got\nworking directions, instructions from you only. And on uh my side, after a while, if I can\nbring other young men into organization, to convince other, he will be into step by step, and\nI will be his contact. So he will know only me. So this organization, we don't know exactly\nto a point exactly how many people there were or what exactly is doing. But at one point,\nhe introduced me to the other, say one or two uh colleagues, who happened to be\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncolleagues, and to get together and to see what we can do. More specially against the\nGermans and happened two of these uh colleagues in the school, in the school, later on\nworked on the same in the same factory. So when we went in this factory, textile\nfactory, we start to discuss during break what, how to sabotage the work over there because\nthey produce for the war. And how to maybe to talk to other friends in other factory. So first\nof all we start to slow down the work, and we start to talk to other people around. There are\na lot of young people. We was out to tell them about organization, about anything. By\ntalking about the tough situation of the people, the fact that the war have some big impact\non our lives, to do something. And to convince them to slow down, don't work, don't get\n. So I remember two or three people in a couple of weeks start to become sick, start\nto, to, to go around a lot, start to walk, claims their equipment doesn't work. So all kinds of\nuh action in order to, to, uh reduce the production. And many of us start to at one point to\ncut some electrical wiring over there, which to make mortars. Some parts we start\nto, to, to break some part of the equipment, so after a while there has to be a lot of uh\nmaintenance, repairs, and there is not enough repair parts. So one of our objectives inside\nwas to, to slow the production ...to our possibilities. The second was like uh political action\nI guess. You talk to the people to convince them that the uh fascist government is not good.\nThat we have to do something, that we have to fight for liberation from German occupation.\nWas like uh political activity, to have more and more people to think like what we were\nthinking about.",
        "A: That's interesting, a matter of fact, like I told you, during the war exactly, we don't know\nexactly the components of this group because say I know one or two people, maybe four\npeople, and other know other people. But basically what we find out that most of the groups\nwas a conglomerate of people from different political uh what you call, uh beliefs. Was\nmany people, Zionist young people, think to fight. Was Communist we sort have to fight.\nWas social democrat. Was other democratic members of all this party before the war\nstarted. So was like a united front to fight against the Germans. And the Communist uh\nrepresentative, a big deal probably, after the war we find out and organize this group. They\nhave an active part. But the most important at this point was to fight the Germans. In\ndifferent ways. And uh many people thought that it 1s not necessary to fight. These others\nbecause there was a big danger. You expose your life. And was the feeling specially in end\nof '42 when we know, people know that the war will be lost by Germany, there's anyway,\nthe Russian or American will come and liberate and Germany will leave. But the problem,\nas you know, when the German troop retreat, they kill not only Jewish people, other people.\nSo if I don't be killed from nothing, the last day it could happen something over there. So\nmany people think doesn't worth to fight. When to fight, because the liberation come\nanyhow. The most important to keep, to keep us alive. But other, many people thought is to\ndo something, to give our contribution to the fight against the Germans.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthese other things. Uh did you do any other kinds of sabotage-type of activities?",
        "A: Oh, I remember other kind was I was involved was to hide them. They give me something\nto hide in my house. Some books, some materials, sometimes even I didn't know what's\ninside. But they told me they trust me to find a better way to hide than some materials. And\nI remember we work not only to hide to say to dig in the uh soil something, but to use some\nhouses' walls or to, to take out some bricks and put back, and we have in our yard a very old\ncar, uh and I don't know, the engine, took some apart and they put inside. And interesting\nthing was that we tried to uh have for this organization some people who have some\nconnection with the government, some connection. So that we can use for information. And\nfor example, I knew a former colleague, non-Jews, who was, his father was in the Army,\nand at one point we start to talk with him about, to meet him and to talk about the war,\nabout the, what's going on, and he had some good feelings about our fight. He went, was\nready to do something. So we use him, at one time to get him to hide in his house some\nmaterials. And he start to get some information from his father which was an Army officer\nof some type. He knew more what's going on at the front, what's going on in the town, and\nmany times he came to me because when I start my high school he was my uh, my\ncolleague on the bench, sitting next to me, so we were some friends. So we start to meet\nafter the war a couple of times, and start to use his information, his situation to give\ninformation regarding the situation at the front, regarding the situation in town. And other\nthing interesting say at that time that I have to tell you was a girl in our town from a very\nhigh-class family, put it this way, was Jew. But during the war, like I told you, most of the\nhouses was taken by the authorities and given to non-Jewish people or they put some Army\ncommander or officer, give some room in the houses. So uh the family of this girl which\nwas famous in the town, they have their own factory was taken but had the position, had in\ntheir house an officer of the Army, a high, high-level officer. So we start to talk to this uh\ngirl. She was very nice girl. And she had a bad situation. She died many years ago in France.\nBut she start to go from time to time inside the officer's room through some doors they have\nover there. He has two, three rooms in their house. And she start in one hand to use the\nradio to listen what's going on and she start to, to look through, through his papers and find\nwhat's going on in uh local political and army situation and basically, she didn't have very,\nvery deep political conviction but she feels that she wants to help somehow the fight against\nthe Germans to, to give her contribution here. So was a way to, to find more and more\ninformation what you want and to help and she, we gave to her to keep books and to give\nsome other written material which were uh some leaflets for example I remember was at\none point against the Germans, against the war. We distributed sometimes to some people\nthis, and we hide it through her even in the officer's room. So this was a very, very\ninteresting uh story you know. And uh, during the the end of the war, through her we find a\nlot of information.",
        "A: Yes, yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: Through this girl. I told you, they have a big, before the war, they have a big mansion. So\nthe authorities took almost all the room and part of the apartment they give to this officer,\nhigh-rank officer, colonel say he was over there. And they would cut off communication\nfirst off between the rooms on one hand. On other hand happened, and happened many\nsituation like this, you know many people don't recognize, some officer who were or had the\nrooms in Jewish houses, they know there was a front. They don't like to die on the war. So\nthey started some sympathy for Jewish people and they start to talk to the people who, from\nwhere they took the house. They not treated like enemy. So with some of them,they have\nsome, some kind of relation. They say good night. They (say) good morning probably. They\nhave together the coffee from time to time. So for her, she, was easy to some extent to go in\nhis quarters, in his rooms. So we give her some small books and small uh paper, some\nliterature and she succeeded to go in his room. Not for long, to keep, to keep sometimes\nbathroom, sometimes even under his bed, something some places. So un we're very happy\nthat she wanted to work and we know she was not a zionist, she was not a communist even.\nShe was not, she was a rich girl before you know. She help the movement against the\nGerman.",
        "A: That's true, that story. Uh what happened. I have the connection with the girl. So I talk to\nher and she invited to her house to come to discuss, to bring some materials. She went to the\nsame school like I went. So one uh day she told me that she wants to take me to officer's\nroom to show me the room. Maybe I can find some more interesting over there because she\nwas very quick. And I did good or bad, I say, let's go together. So one day she told\nme come around five o'clock, afternoon was maybe, I don't recall, maybe Saturday or\nSunday some. Her folks are out of town. So we, we went over there. But we discussed if\nsomething happened, we start, this was before we discuss her, if even her parents would\ncome or somebody from house or we make believe that we are in love, we embrace one\nanother, something, you know, friend. So she took me in officer's room one day. We started\nto look in his, on his desk, and after a while, maybe five, maybe ten minutes, I don't\nremember, somebody knocked at the door, and enter was an officer uh assistant or\nsomething to him with access. So was scared like death. So immediately start to embrace\none another, start to kiss one another. So the officer start to yell, what you doing. You make\nlove here, you are doing, here in the room. Making noise. And then he start to, to went out\nand to was a and other rooms and her parents lived. What your daughter's doing\nhere. There's a guy over there. So her daughter come or her parents came over in the room\nand started, what's going on. So they upset about their daughter and later about me because I\nam somebody which was . And we make believe that it's true, so finally went out\nand she had a rough time with her parents, and I stopped to see her in her house only this\ntime, but was very funny situation over there. And she was a very, very uh courageous\nyoung uh lady, and nice lady, wasn't. Later on, after uh German was defeated and uh, uh\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nRomania become a free country again, for a while, she went to, to study and become a very\ngood and very famous architect and later on she immigrated to France and in France she had\na bad luck. She died of cancer. But was very sad, very sad. But always I was impressed, I'm\nimpressed, when I think about a lot of people and about the young people from different\nsituation, from different political point of view, has to fight the German. And they\ndon't care about themselves. They are ready to sacrifice. So uh was not selfish people. So\nmany times maybe uh the young people, I was, this time, in our time, has to know what's\ngoing on and to think about what happened and to think that sometimes in life, maybe many\ntimes, it's not good to be selfish.",
        "A: My worst moment, put it this way, was, (PAUSE) I cannot say the worst moment, was\nmaybe was many moments. One was when being in police when was in our town, and the\nsame time was other two, three people which were taken, and I was in a cell with a small\nwindow. During the night I couldn't sleep. But all of a sudden I, I heard some steps. And I\nsaw two policemen bringing somebody, some corridors, and after a while I realized that the\nprisoner was one of my colleagues over there. And they brought him as kind of basement\nnot far away from where I were, and start to beat him, talk to him over there. And I heard\nhis screams and I heard his cries and I watched you know what happened over there and I\nrealized, for me was the worst moment because probably was almost dead over there. But\nhere, specially I knew like a comrade and like a nice person which I talked to many times\nand such a situation was horrifying. And was horrifying to understand what happened to his\nmind and his feeling. Was something which one is the worst moment. And the second worst\nmoment I guess was for me when we were transferred from one prison, from Gala_1, to\nPloe_ ti. I told you before. We was put in a kind of prison, in a monastery. By this monastery\nwas probably, I don't recall, six, seven kilometers, probably five miles, from Ploe_ ti. We\nwere in chains, and the hands cuffed, so from Ploe_ti station to the monastery was not any\ncommunication. We have to walk. So during the walk, during the night, was night, to start\nto walk and the monastery was on a kind of hill. We have to uh, road winding and climbing.\nAfter ten minutes, fifteen minutes, almost nobody could no more walk because the chain on\nthe legs makes them uh, wounds, wounds you because. And they at one point start to bleed.\nAnd they couldn't walk. And almost I fall down. And other people fall down. At that\nmoment, we stop for maybe a couple of seconds, and once the policemen start to come to us\nand say, go, don't, we have to, to get to the monastery. You have to give you a way to catch\nback our train, so don't care about you. So it was like the end of the world for us. Finally,\none of uh our colleague have an idea to take some handkerchiefs or our shirt, I don't\nremember, to make a knot to our uh chains and to tie it to our belts so the chain doesn't fall\ndown on our ankles here. So we try to do this for a while, but again start to fall down. So the\nworst moment probably, we walked two hours say, close to two hours, but I thought was\neternity. And then a funny moment happened when we went to this uh monastery. They\nhave a big barrack. Was not inside the monastery, was outside. The kind of place where\nthey kept probably some uh equipment to take uh care about the land. And they push inside.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nInside was other prisoners. One near other one I guess. And in the middle of this big barrack\nwas big barrel (ph). People make their needs from this barrel. And dirty\naround. And we were in there. Don't excited right now. I cannot believe this maybe. Was\nthat people, we couldn't breathe, couldn't do anything. But only very small space, space to\nlay down was this barrel. So everybody jump to lay down and to put their head on the wall\nof the barrel. I cannot tell you what feeling, when you feel happy, if you can say that,\nbecause we, we don't walk. Was end of the . On other end, where you were over\nthere, maybe wasn't like you were coming over there because they us. Was how you\ncall, bad, bad bad situation, but was I can see you meet him. He give you instruction. They\nsay yes. I say no. They say start to beat me in front of him. And finally, we, he indicate (ph)\nfor me that I know him, they try to bring this third one. Say they brought the third one to\nwitness against me, which I know. And I, I was surprised because the third was not an\nagent, was other colleague, was , was my connection. He made the declaration before\nthat he knew me. So he brought him to recognize me in front of the policeman. He come in\nfront of me, was two people, police, in empty room. You recall him. We look one\nanother eyes. And say no, I don't know who this 1s. I was, to you made a declaration against\nhim. You beated me to the death. They start to beat him again, in front of, know him. No, I\ndon't know him. This was most, most emotional part of which I remember like now, you\nknow, whatever.",
        "A: Yes. They use all kinds of system to, to put you down, to , to beat on uh on legs\nand other parts of the body. And other was times they manage you to kill or to, to uh arrest\nyour parents. This was other system to put pressure on you. And you know what happened.\nWas very, very afraid. But I can't say, maybe good luck or bad luck that we were caught at\nthe end of the war. So when the situation of war was clear for many people, local people,\nauthorities, they start to evacuate and they know that the German cannot win the war. They\ncouldn't win the war. There was already change and retreat toward Carpathians , to\nTranslyvania, to Berlin.",
        "A: My parents were in the same town and they stayed in the same town.",
        "A: No. No. No. No. They suffered a lot you know. And uh they tried the best they can to help\nme, but there's nothing to do. To keep hope.",
        "A: Uh, I mentioned manuscript about this Traian or Trane. I don't know how to pronounce\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbecause was a very interesting person, very strange. Was a mixture of good and bad. But\nwas uh like an interesting story, OK. So being this guy, young man in 40's, I remember. He\nwas young guy in the same town I know. I remember like now that his father was an invalid\nfrom the first war and saved some license invalids from the war, first war, to sell cigarettes,\nyou know. Tobacco shops to have, to give a way to make a living for the, who are veterans.\nSo I know about him. I know him on the streets, maybe on the school. So one day in '40\nwhen the Iron Guard become very powerful, '40, I guess '40, maybe beginning of '41, I saw\nthis guy Triane, his Iron Guard uniform on the street. Green uniform, military uniform. And\nhe starts to yell and to beat some people who think they were Jewish. And for a while, at the\nend of the '40, maybe beginning of '41, the Iron Guard was part of the government of the\ndictatorship of General Antonescu, was most extremist right say wing, fascist wing. And\nsome places they put their people in charge of the security forces. The police we call them.\nSo this young man become the chief of security, of police in our town. Iron Guard security.\nOK. After a while, when uh Iron Guard was defeated by General Antonescu. It's a long\nstory. Many run out of the country and many disappear, there's a fight on the streets. It's a\nlong story, don't want it in details, but I didn't hear anything about same person called\nTraian. When I was arrested, and moved from our town to Gala_1 to prison, was by, moved\nby a uh truck, I saw the truck with other people was this guy Traian. After say three years\nmaybe. And I was surprised what he's doing with the people who fought against the\nGerman, because a part of Iron Guard. I didn't know, I couldn't ask him. Was dark, we went\nto the prison. After Gala_1, we was transferred to this monastery where was more free, so\nwe Start to talk between them. Talk to him, to talk to other people. And I asked one other uh\ncolleague who was with me in organization, what's doing this guy here because he was an\nIron Guard, and we fought against the Germans. And let's tell you his story shortly. And\nlooks first of all, he was condemned to death by uh fascist organization being an Iron Guard\nleader, and probably he killed somebody or something happened, I don't know. So he have a\nbad sentence, and in order to avoid, he ran out of the town and later on come back and he\nwas hiding with a neighbor who happened to be Jewish guy. He's former roommate or\ncolleague or something like that. So this Traian who was Iron Guard security chief and has a\ndeath penalty on his head was hiding, by in a Jewish family. After a while, one of the sons\nof the Jewish family was involved to some extent in this organization, anti-fascist\nmovement and they told to one of connections that they know they hiding this guy over\nthere to him. So one day they decided let's use him somehow because he's not Jews uh, and\nlet him try to go to send him to some camps in Russia with Jewish people, non-Jewish\npeople, communists, not communists, to help them, to send some money, some, some uh\npackages, some products or some grocery or some clothes. So he agreed to go again like a\nwhat you call underground to help the anti-fascist forces, put it this way. So he went a\ncouple of times to what those days was occupied by Germans to help, not to help, to uh\ntransmit some money, to transmit some food, some clothes, something to the people that\nwas in camp. One night before uh probably we was arrested, he decided to go out from\nhiding, probably to go in uh special house to have some lady relationship, with some\nprostitutes or some bordello or something. And he went over there and some policemen\naround recognize him, so they put him under surveillance and they follow him, and they\nfollow where he went. So the police, the fascist police start to survey the house and finally\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthey decided to arrest some people of the house, including him. So he went together with\nthis group and our group when all was the same time to the police. And he, he was again put\nunder trial and put uh inquire and put on the investigation, not like Iron Guard, but like\nhelping the anti-fascist movement. But he was all the time afraid that he was put there\nbecause he was an Iron Guard, so after a while we start to talk and I start to talk to him, and\nhe told very vague, not in detail, that he knows his past, he regret it, make a big mistake, and\nhe want to pay somehow and want to help the movement. And probably my feeling he was\na little opportunistic. He knew, he was smart guy. He knew that the situation would change\nanyhow, so it's better to have good relationship with uh anti-fascist groups. So after uh the\nGerman left and uh become independent uh country again if I can say, he was in charge for\na while like security chief, security force in the same town Bac_u but now like presence of\ncommunists. And happened he married a Jewish girl. But finally after a while, put it this\nway, was a lot of uh discussion, a lot of uh problem, the relation with others, not only with\nhim, Iron Guard people and uh fascist people who converted during the night to be\ndemocratic, to be communist and to help the communists. So he was, we found this true,\nexpelled from communist party and take out of his job and sent some place in our small\ntown to work like in accounting. But uh was pretty interesting story about him and uh how\nsome people are liberate during the war and before the war, how some people change the\ncolor of their shirt. Because I met in my life many, many kinds of people. Some people have\nsome convictions, something. And the keep their conviction, right or wrong, to the end of\ntheir life. Didn't want to change. Other, according to the circumstances, feel more safe for\nthem to, to change their convictions. To say I'm sorry for yesterday, but now I'm changed.\nI'm with you. So this happened many times and even now days you see many places over\nthe world the same, the same story. But was interesting you know how they were alright, the\npeople were alright.",
        "A: Yes, I was afraid, and specially was afraid about two guys which we worked together. But\nuh one, like I told you, he recognized but when he was brought in front of me, he\ndenied. And he continued to be a symbol of the human being because at this point he saved\nnot only his life, or may be my life, and I cannot, cannot tell what was my, my strong\nfeeling, how my, I cannot you what means this to me, absolutely know what many people\nunder the force, they give everything. They talk. They, you know. Other people, they keep\ntheir belief and their ideas you know. That's not easy way. So not many people probably. So.",

And was to station, the police station. The police station looked to us,\nand said you are free now but you don't have the right to move from city to the city. Every\nweek we have to report to us here, that you are here. So we went home. But the situation in\n'44 say in July in Moldavia was changed. Most of the authorities start to leave the town\nwhich leave and the front was very close, and every, basically we stayed home. We\ndidn't go out of the home, no where to go. People are afraid. And we start to hear the sounds\nof the artillery from Moldavia--from, say, city of Ia_1[Ger: Jassy], or closer--because the\nRussian army start to come closer and closer. So I remember like today, in the beginning of\nAugust, maybe middle of the August, all of a sudden in the morning, a big noise on the\nstreet again, like the same strange noise like in '39 we heard when the Polish troops came\nfrom Poland and we saw the war started. It's interesting. And we went out, again, in our\npajamas or whatever it was over there, and saw a lot of German troops running toward the\nedge of the city which goes towards Translyvania ,Carpathian mountins and local troop, and\nI saw a local authorities which I know start to ran. And everybody starts the Russians out on\nthe bridge, the Russians out on the bridge. Was a big river ,a bridge a couple of miles. So\nafter a couple of hours everything was uh silent. Some, only sounds of uh artilleries. A fight\nwas over there and nobody dared to go in the street. Nobody was able. So was a couple of\nhours from the morning, early morning till afternoon was a ghost city. Everybody was\nafraid, and all of a sudden around four o'clock, probably five o'clock, was some noise and\nsomebody start to tell some Russian troops are uh close to our city. People went out to the\nbridge, only bridge which come from Ia _ 1 to our city. So we saw the Russian uh troops over\nthere coming. And everybody start on the street to go, and everybody, this is the true, start to\ncry and start to kiss one another. The German is gone. The fascist is gone. So this is a kind\nof liberation that you have.",
        "A: After liberation happened many things in our town. Understand this. Number one, we come\ntogether, a group of people like was together, fought together in Germany, in group, only\ngathered together and we went to Jewish community center. And then we find people are\nalready over there which were some representative I guess of some political party, some\ncommunist party, and they start to organize the life. Was the first thing they told us to do, to\ngo immediately and to clean, because it's more difficult to say, because the same time we\nsaw the Russian uh troop, Russian army goes to the city day and night. And a lot of uh\nwounded soldiers coming back and tanks and horses. The horses that was taken for the\nRussian soldiers, but was like uh a big mess over there. A lot of uh garbage everywhere.\nAnd everybody was afraid there could be some epidemic immediately. So they told us, they\ntold me, you be in charge now for next two days to clean the streets. I don't know what to\ndo, you don't have anything. I don't know. Take, you have here ten people, or twenty\npeople. Go and take whoever you can and find some carriage and start to, to grab the\ngarbage. So we did for a couple of days all kinds of tricky things to get some garbage, to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthrow away in the river. There's a river across over there. And then other things what\nhappened which I remember, start some fires in the city. Somebody put some fire, some\nbuildings in downtown. Up to now I don't know who or how, it was very curious. But was\nsome fires and was not uh firefighters over there because they were evacuated because the\nRussians came. So we start to, to fight this uh fires over there, days and nights over there.\nTo bring water and to try uh hoses. One of the first activities we did over there. And uh then\nwe Start with some kind of administration they start to put together. And this happened in all\nthe part of the Moldavia when the Russian came. Immediately the communist was in control\nas they start to organize the administration. And other thing interesting is, again, now is\nhistory, uh during the war was a lot of prisoners from Germany, from Romania, from other\ncountry who fight against the Russian, so Russian organize this prisoner, some special\narmy, most of them. I don't know. And they make like a Polish army who was trained in\nRussia and probably German army who was, and the Romanian army. And when they come\nto Romania, they put some people from this uh Romanian army which trained in Russia in\nadministration of the territory. And they asked to help the administration, all kinds of small\nthings related from clean the street to transportation to guide the transportation, all kinds of,\npostal service to start was cut something over there.",
        "A: OK. Can I look here. (Technical conversation). Now here 1s a picture, 1f you don't know.\nWe like to go to our neighbors, a lady, our neighbors. Always she has nice dogs and horses\nover there. And here, that's my sister Rose, my brother Mike and myself here. That's before\nthe war, many years. But what, looking through this picture I remember how happy we were\nto go to our neighbors because they have nice dogs and horses and sometimes a carriage and\nthey took us around the corner you know to give us a ride over there.",
        "A: Yes, now here is a group of students, colleagues, probably in '37, '36 (technical\nconversation), '36, '37 and we liked to go to some uh colleagues homes, to stay, to have tea,\nto play over there. And one day we get here for a birthday over there. And most of the\npeople who are here, I show later in a big picture, went to this Jewish school organized by\nJewish community center and many are now in the United States, some are in Israel. A few\nprobably are still in my town, and I don't know the fate of other ones.",
        "A: Yes, I guess this right. This are my parents, here. My mother Maria and my father Leonid. I\nguess this photo picture was taken immediately after the war. And they look nice as my\nparents. They are happy, and they tried to give us a very honest and good education and I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nlearned a lot about life from my parents, especially from my father.",
        "A: Well, it's not here. Where's the big one? With all the students. Could you take this?",
        "A: Oh no. Here. OK. Now here is an interesting uh picture I guess. When we finish, probably\nthis one is in '43, the high school. The high school was a tremendous experience.\nSometimes we didn't have any electricity, didn't have any heat. We didn't have to eat you\nknow, the lunch. But we went to the school. Because . ..",
        "A: At the end of the war, we have a big party here to celebrate our liberation and like a large\nparty, we have drink, we dance and some friends of ours are here. And...",
        "A: It was my pleasure to be with you. It's very tough to talk about the past so far away. But I\ntried.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nPHOTOGRAPHS\n(1) Some of my colleagues in our class when uh we finish the high school, the Jewish school\norganized by Jewish community center. And each one went uh his or her way in his life and\neverybody is different places all over the world right now.\n(2) This picture represents our class when we finish the high school at the Jewish community\ncenter. Was a very tremendous experience to go through this school when you don't have\nelectricity sometimes. You don't have heat. The teacher change very often as they were\ntaken to concentration work or they were taken to labor camps, they change. But always we\nhave some teacher to teach us. And.\n(3) These are my parents. The picture was taken after the war.\n(TECHNICAL CONVERSATION)\n"
