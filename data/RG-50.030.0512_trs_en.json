So I didn\u2019t have\nnothing, I put my hands over my head, you know, you just protect -- I had already hit my -- over\nthe head, so I put -- protect my head and I s -- kept running and they been hitting both sides.\nFinally we got out. He let us go out, we came in into the no man\u2019s land, the no man\u2019s land\nbetween the Soviets and the German. There were so many people, masses of people, women and\nchildren. And the Russian guard wouldn\u2019t let through.",
        "Q: Wouldn\u2019t let anybody through?",
        "A: No. One [indecipherable] us through and then people with kids come and beg, and n-nothing\nhelps, nobody went through, nobody can do, oh, wa -- they say we have to ask -- we have to\nformally ask for permission and we have to return then, if you get the permission, then you -- if\nyou get a permit, we\u2019ll let you through. So days -- there were 14 days on that cold winter\nNovember days, and snow and rain. So the only thing we had, some peddlers have bread to sell,\nso there was some bread and [indecipherable]. That\u2019s all we could get. And day by day we talked\nto [indecipherable]. On the 14\" day we saw some, you know, [indecipherable] in the morning. It\nwas a nice morning and the -- wasn\u2019t snowing and raining. We saw in the distance that some\npeople s -- go through, and they sort of disappear, they go into the woods. On the other side were\nwooded areas where the Russian guards were there. So I said, maybe that is the good way. So we\nthought this is probably smugglers, which they know and -- where to -- where there is a better\npassage.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we did follow them, we went through the border, and nothing, nobody check. I mean, no\nguards or nothing, you know, cause they knew whether it -- it was bribe somebody or something,\nI don\u2019t know, the smugglers maybe they have a way of bribing guards or whatever. We didn\u2019t\nsee any guards and we went toward the [indecipherable] and --",
        "Q: Did you know where you were going? Did you -- I mean, did you have a destination? You\nweren't sure?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You just wanted to get to the Russian side.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, the next town we know is Bialystok.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The big town. But this was a small town we came over to, Bora, and in a few kilmatersa -- ki\n-- kilometers like that, there was a s-station, the train station, we took tr -- we took the train and\nwe came to Bialystok, which wasn\u2019t far.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Bialystok was a town wall -- wall to wall refugees, people from the other side, every\n[indecipherable] full of people.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Full. You couldn\u2019t go into a house if you -- if you wanted to go ask for a cu -- for a drink of --\ncup of water, or a glass of water, they wouldn\u2019t let you in the house. They put -- they put -- they\ngot water out to you, a glass of water, they gave you a glass of water and that\u2019s it. Or a cup of\nwater. This -- you know, they were afraid to let somebody in the house. They didn\u2019t know who it\nis, and we looked poor, something like that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They looked -- we looked, you know, bloody and -- and I-I mean there\u2019s muddy, and --\nmuddy and bloody and so everything [indecipherable]. So we walked around and we met some\npeople on the street, you know [indecipherable] some people we knew from Lodz, or -- nobody\nhad these -- a solution of what to do. They were registering -- the government registered people\nto go to coal mines to work. If you wor -- they say, if you register, we can, in a week or so, or\ntwo weeks, you might get the -- you go to work. Well, I really didn't want to go to the coal mines\n[indecipherable] then we didn\u2019t go too far, and now soon we gonna go back home, so we had --\ndon\u2019t want to go so far up in the [indecipherable] in the coal mines. And so there was no place,\nso we got -- the evening -- towards the evening, there was no place where to go to sleep. So I\nwent a shul.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And we slept in the shul, on a bench. And the next day we go again out in the street,\n[indecipherable] again the people, they come in the evening -- we come in the evening to\n[indecipherable] where we slept, some like that, some other people came and they s -- they took\nour place. [indecipherable] it\u2019s not mine, you know, I couldn\u2019t, you know, how -- how could you\n-- so I had to walk out, we walked out in the streets, we start walking the street. We didn\u2019t have -\n- we have no place where to go. So we figured, well maybe we should take a tra -- the trains\nwere running, should take a train to the next small town, somewheres, whatever it is, another --\nanother 50 - 70 miles, maybe it\u2019s better there, there aren\u2019t that many people over there. Here,\neverybody sticks to one place. So we got to the station, to the train station, we get -- they wait --\nwaiting in line for tickets, and the man, a Jewish man [indecipherable] is behind us and he looks\nat us, says where you going? I said, we\u2019re going next town. What\u2019s the matter, he says, you got\nrelatives there? So why you -- what kind of che -- what you do? I said, we\u2019re tailors. We all of u\n-- we all of us were tailors, three of us. [indecipherable] me and Tanchim, we met a guy, one\nguy, another friend of ours on the border, we took him along, so we\u2019re three of us. Oh, tailors, he\nsays, I\u2019m going to a town where my daughter lives and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a better town than here, it\u2019s a\nlittle further, and you\u2019ll be better off. Y-You\u2019re tailors, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get work over there,\nyou'll get settled down, things like that. Well, it\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll go with -- we go with you. No, he\nsays, we'll go with you. Why yi -- how co -- we don\u2019t have where to sleep, so -- where to go,\nwhere to stay, with whom. So he says, for two guys, my daughter has a little sofa -- a sofa in the\nli -- P\u2019Il give you the sofa, and you\u2019ll [indecipherable] the third one, we\u2019ll find another place, so\nthe two of you -- well, it\u2019s a big -- a good deal, two of us [indecipherable]. So we all agreed. We\nwent with him and we landed in the town of Baranovich, and as he promised, we got to his\ndaughter at night, and -- and he told her that he brought two -- two guests, you gotta give them\nwhere to sleep. So he give us the soft and two of us slept the sofa and then my third one,\nTanchim had -- he went to a -- to the shul, the next -- was around the corner a shul, and he says,\nwell, plenty room in the shul says, if you want to [indecipherable] til we\u2019ll get -- til you find a\nplace. So we had the -- where to stay. In the morning we start out looking for work. You know,\nyou stay, we want to work, and do -- make it to -- live on something, you [indecipherable] you\nneed some money. You know, looked around, we walked around the city, and my one fire -- one\nfriend of mine found work, from the three of us, found a job, he was a ladies\u2019 tailor, he found a\ngood job -- a good job, a job [indecipherable]. We -- I think I walked out another wa -- we\nwalked in the street there together, a guy walked over to -- behind us, he was a -- and then he\ncame over, he says, I\u2019m a rabbi, what are you? You look -- you refugees? Yes. You -- what 1s it\nyou -- what are you doing for a living? Well, we\u2019re tailors. Oh, I need a coat, he says, I\u2019m going\naway, and -- he\u2019s going -- he\u2019s a Russian [indecipherable] from a little town. So [indecipherable]\nsays, I don\u2019t have a machine, I don\u2019t have -- oh, he says, my mother has a house. You stay in the\nhouse, and then you could do -- make it and she [indecipherable] a house, has a machine and\neverything. First of all, 1t was a good idea, the house. She got a house [indecipherable] got in the\nhouse because it was bitter cold, and we just turned around the streets and we were frozen ca --\nand now, even though we didn\u2019t -- 1t was very cold, and na -- just the feet are wet because of\nsnow. So we got and warm upped ourself a little bit. She sort of was really still [indecipherable |\nhis house was a little -- a little, small house, and it was warm, you know, little cats on the -- on\nthe chair, little cat was warming on the oven. It was such a peaceful house, and the -- this lady,\nold lady is putting in firewood and taking [indecipherable]. So I says, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s such a\ngood place, you know, you could stretch out the legs and things like that. And I start working on\nthe coat, without no knowledge what to do with it, but I start working, and I stretched the work it\nshould take a little longer. I\u2019d never made a coat, but I made it. My friend helped, and working\n[indecipherable] we made his coat.",
        "Q: Your second coat?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Your second coat?",
        "A: No, for he -- for this ra --",
        "Q: For him.",
        "A: For him.",
        "Q: It\u2019s the second time you made a coat.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s the first time I made a coat. I never, never made the coat, you know, from scratch,\nyou know, with a pattern with the -- with this cutting, you know. I made my own, so I had ac --\nmy brother was, you know, he knew how to make the pattern, so he cut.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t know until I sort of remember little bit just what they been talking. So I went out\nthe street and we just finished the coat just out in the street, you know, out in the street. We -- so\nwe always met in the -- there was a cafeteria, a big cafeteria, and all those refugees came in the\nca -- to the cafeteria. With a glass of tea, they could stay all day long. This is cold days, you can\u2019t\n-- you have no place where to go. So --",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to have to stop you, cause we need to stop the tape. So you\u2019re --\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: We left -- before the last tape you were saying you went into a cafeteria and people could sit\nall day --",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We met people, talked, sit and talk. And we had just like sharing information. I heard about\nthe sending packages to -- to po -- to ghetto, wi -- and my friend Tanchim, we went out on the\nmarket and we -- and we -- and we co -- buy -- buy food. We made a package, we send back to\nghetto. We figured we just -- you know, we really weren\u2019t sure th -- if they will get it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

Th -- in other words, it\u2019s a\nJewish area, and we lived there in that house before, so I figure I\u2019d send it to the same address.\nSure enough, after the war when my brother survived, he says they got this package --",
        "Q: They did.",

        "A: -- they -- they don\u2019t -- they don\u2019t know who 1s here, who is there, so they declared the citiz --\nif they wa -- if they -- to next -- to the summer -- well, after six months or something -- three\nmonths, they ask all the people, the refugees to come and get a s -- a pass -- a citizenship. Well,\nwe got to the office, everyone was called in individually to this offi -- to the office, and declared\nwhat you goin -- what you expect to be, you know, you gonna get a citizen, you gonna become\ncitizen, and you can go to work, you can work or we will get you work, we\u2019ll -- you wanted the\ngovernment\u2019s protection. And so a lot of people came with -- by themselves, without wife, they\nleft the wife and kids over in -- back home. Mothers [indecipherable] mother, you see. So when\nthey came out from the sa -- ask them what they ask you questions, you said th -- the guy is, I ask\nhim, I said -- they ask me to -- to become citizen, so if you -- and gave me the -- the rules, if\nyou're citizens -- if you\u2019re a citizen -- in other words, you can\u2019t go back to Poland, you cannot\nbring your family, a lot of restrictions. Now, there was one thing, you can\u2019t go back and you\ncan\u2019t bring your family.

So a-\nat the end, if you don\u2019t accept the citizenship, you got to give them in -- a place where you want\nto go, sort of like a nice [indecipherable] want to go to America, you want to go to -- to -- well,\nmaybe we want to see -- they put it on, but it doesn\u2019t matter --",

It was hard to get through. So\nI came back and I -- I mean t -- I went to the border [indecipherable] and I couldn\u2019t get through.\nSo I came back and -- and when I asked for citizenship, I didn\u2019t take the ci -- I didn\u2019t take the\ncitizenship.

So, it was really when we\nstart to, in towards the evening, you saw a little bit change in the people were sort of running\naround too much like -- like undecided what to do, like in running to the station, to the railroad\nstation. And my tal -- friend Tanchim is running to the railroad station, he says, I\u2019m going. And I\nwas going out in the streets to find out some other people, what to do. Are they going really to\nthe evacuate? Are they going to the railroad station to get a train to go back east? So we met\nsome people, refugees coming from the border. They say what do you -- what are you sitting\nhere? We are being chased by the Germans here. German forces are chasing us. And you\u2019re\nsitting here just calmly like that? Then we start running to the -- it was too late already, because\nwe run to the railroad station, this -- there wa -- the -- the trains were bombed already, the\nrailroads were bombed, the rails were bombed. And we couldn\u2019t go. We start going on foot.\nAgain, they attacked us with the flying planes, he didn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t go any further, we\ncouldn\u2019t evacuate, couldn\u2019t leave.

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- the factory we worked was closed, we went on vacation. And on the vacation we just saw\nthe planes and things like that. We didn\u2019t know until about two o\u2019clock -- 12 o\u2019clock when we\ncame home, we heard the speech officially, when they announced that Germany attacked, and\nthen we rushed home. We rushed home, back to Baranovich. Trains were loaded already, people\nwere running from all over, from the countryside to the ci -- to the town. Baranovich was the\nnearest town, which we lived, so we went back. Coming back was really -- the town -- the\nsituation of early war time. [indecipherable] were bombing, and ai-air attacks and things like\nthat. You have the dir -- we dug a shelter in the backyard. We went to the shelters when the fliers\ncame. And we listened to the radio -- to the radio, official radio. They had it placed all over in\nthe places, in the public places where we could hear the news. So they really sa -- misinformed\nus, you know, the agency, the Soviet agency, they had said that they are be -- beating back the\nenemy, and that will -- it\u2019s -- wasn\u2019t true, 1t was -- they were right here, next door, and then\nprobably we wouldn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t rush to evacuate, to go -- to run away. It does -- til it was too late.\nThe bomb -- the trains were bombed, and we -- they -- they couldn\u2019t go, and walking, we walked\nuntil these planes, they shoot us -- shoot on us and -- and so we had to go back. And going back\nis -- you have to settle -- we stayed in a place, in a -- a home, because the war -- at a friend\u2019s\nuncle\u2019s house, which he lived there, in -- at his house. So he had a room, a lot of room, so one\nroom he gave us, because he figured they wouldn\u2019t let him have the whole house anyhow. So\none room we -- our -- our guys, the [indecipherable] there, stayed there in that room, and til we\u2019ll\nsettle, we know what\u2019s going on for the -- they had the -- meanwhile, the SS and the Judenrat,\nthere was already Judenrat ap-appointed, and the Juden Altesten, the Juden ep -- president, it -- it\nwas called the Juden Altesten.",
        "Q: So that was pretty fast.",

        "A: Fa -- right away.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It -- 1t was -- was right away ap-appointed and that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t know wa -- and he -- the --\nthey were talking about a ghetto, and what -- while they talk [indecipherable] were talking.\nMeanwhile they asked for -- they put the -- the say -- co-collecting valuables from the Jews. So\nthey gave us -- gave orders to deliver, let\u2019s say, five pounds of gold -- I mean, I don\u2019t know five\npounds or two pounds, silver, everyth -- or metal, money, you know, currency. They want\ndollars, they want pounds, all foreign currencies. And -- and this had to be delivered in --\nmeanwhile, they start already asking for workers -- workers. So the Judenrat was appointed\n[indecipherable] they needed workers for some project, we didn\u2019t know what. So we were not\nthe ci-citizen, you know, I mean, it\u2019s not a citizen from Baranovich, you know, we -- we were\nrefugees, so we were the first ones to go. So we went to this work, and then we start working, our\nthree guys, and -- the three friends of ours went to work, and this was at the Air Force, German\nAir Force had a base, and they did rebuild -- not rebuild, but extend the airport. And it was the\nPolish -- old Polish airport, but the -- since the Air Force is -- is big, that they need more s --\nmore runways and more things like that. So they took 300 people from us, from -- from Jewish --\nfrom the ghetto, which was not the ghetto yet, but [indecipherable] Jewish people already had to\nsupply workers before the ghetto started. And they had 300 non-Jewish people working. So there\nwas about 600 people working at this airfield to rebuild -- to extend the airfor -- rebuild the airfor\n-- the air force -- the airfield. And I worked a terrible job, I had a terrible job in the -- to re --\nunload the cement, loose cement in a barn when they -- they put the trains in a -- they lo -- they tr\n-- the trains went into a -- gathered into a barn, a big barn and they had loose cement on the -- on\nthe platforms, and it has to be removed from the -- from the train because that train has to go\nagain.

        "A: With a shovel, but the -- the dust went -- that -- that cement was full in the air --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well, we worked, we had no -- this was -- this is the work. So --",
        "Q: And who chose you? Was it the Judenrat who chose you, or the Germans who cho -- how\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Actually, Judenrat wants workers. They -- and since we s-sort of were refugees, we the first\nones to go because the others had families and thanks to that we have no families, so I -- I didn\u2019t\nmind. I mean, we went to work. So what is there -- we can\u2019t be -- we can\u2019t avoid that, we going\nto have to -- sooner or later we figured we\u2019ll have to go -- we\u2019ll do something. Anyhow, we\ncouldn\u2019t say no. As we worked -- as I worked ever d -- at this job [indecipherable] time, I really\ngot sick from that. So at -- one morning the foreman, you know, we had this guy, Jewish guy was\nthe foreman from 300 people. In the morning he divided people different -- different play -- jobs.\nThere were electricians, there were carpenters, you know. So one day he ask for a tailor, who 1s a\ntailor. So I raise my hands, where are tailors, better to work than that. So I said -- then I start\nworking as a tailor and as soon they open -- they gave me a room and a machine, and\n[indecipherable] set up a tailor room where I could work. Was a different cha -- a big change. I\nfelt, you know, now I could rec -- could -- could hold on til -- I don\u2019t know. We worked there\nand it was in the beginning not bad.

I had all the guy -- all these officers came in\nfor work -- kind of work, pants, sometimes they had uniforms, and sometimes civilian clothes, I\ndon\u2019t know. There were so many changes. They wore in the beginning civilian clothes and then\nthey had a uniform. So anyway, there was always work to do. And I also do so -- did some work\nfor the Air Force people itself, you know, the military, because when they came they saw sh --\nthey [indecipherable] a ta -- a tailor, they want him -- e-everybody had an -- they needed.

I did some side work. So I made -- you know, to go through\n[indecipherable] to -- to make something to go -- you know, people s -- usually everybody gave\nsomething. You know, no matter -- the officers, they -- to -- the guy around me -- had one guy\nwho was a ta -- a tall guy, a big strong guy, he was -- he was so mean, and when he came in to\nhave work done and he always brought something. Bread, butter, and things like that, and he was\nin charge [indecipherable]. So -- so rem -- he [indecipherable] in a way that you could -- he\ncould have a -- you know, stay in [indecipherable]. He didn\u2019t bother us. I worked, nobody came\nin to check me, what I wad -- what I work, but I wa -- they were -- just want the acceptance if\nthey came -- outside people, if they came in, they want to have them h-have the um -- our -- pi --\npi -- our officers should give them permission. They got it.",
        "Q: Are they killing Jews at this point, do you know?",
        "A: At the what? At the --",
        "Q: In the area.",
        "A: In the area?",
        "Q: Yeah. Do you know anything?",
        "A: When you first -- you saw the ghetto, well, people went out to work, and this was one guy\nwho -- a tailor who had his own shop, and it ha -- got in a -- when he -- they want him to give up\nthe shop. He had a tailor -- his store, with the business. They want him to give up the business\nbecause he 1s a -- so he formally gave up the business to a worker of his. I-In other words, it\nshould have a -- a -- put a -- it\u2019s under his name is the facto -- what is the business, but he took\nthe -- he di -- he took the profit, the money or whatever it is they made. And that was finally wa -\n- who -- whose told the -- I mean, the authorities, they s -- they says what he does, he was\narrested and he was hanged, publicly on the pla -- on the -- before the ghetto was closed, he --\nthey asked everybody -- the people to go and see it. You know, that\u2019s to scare the people up, you\nknow, like the -- not to do anything on their own -- on the -- on the -- what they wanted is\n[indecipherable]. Well, anyhow, these things occurred and they also here and there, when they\nneed workers or they need people, they\u2019ve been taken away, they never -- we never saw them\nback. So that was until the ghetto was in a -- a -- still a set up and they had a one meter -- they\ngave us one meter per person. One meter space in a -- in a -- you have a room like that, and you\ncan put eight, 10 people. So eight every -- one meter per person.",
        "Q: One meter\u201d?",
        "A: One meter. So they -- they measured -- you know, that was, you know, it -- handled it\nperfectly, I mean, they adore us. And we set up the ghetto pretty good, the doctors -- the doctors\nset up a sort of hospital inside to handle the sick people, and everything was working, organized.\nSo I don\u2019t know if they liked that, probably didn\u2019t like that organized kind of a -- a ghetto, pretty\nsure. Anyhow, one day they came to ask for -- for 12 doctors. The SS gave always orders what\nthey want. You know, one time they want gold, wanted silver, and -- and one day I was out of\nwork and I was grabbed as a hostage -- as a hostage for a -- because they demand some amount\nof -- of money or something like that, it took a long time to get together, to get the -- collect the\nmoney from people. So they took a --",
        "Q: So you were a hot -- the Germans took you as a hostage?",
        "A: Yeah. Even though I been w -- I had the -- a -- even though I had a -- a I.D. to -- I worked ina",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- a German place, it -- 1t di-didn\u2019t ag -- they didn\u2019t care about that, who -- everybody\u2019s on\ntheir own, they have a different law, the SS has different laws. So they again took us into a place\nwhere -- enc-enclosed place, about -- I don\u2019t know, couple of hundred people, hostages, and they\nthreatened they will kill us if they are not delivered. And the whole day long we been with our\nhands up and the machi -- the machine guns all around, and watching these -- the few hu -- the\npeople who were not the hostages. And towards the evening, ar -- they took out nine people and\nthey s -- and they did, they said they gonna shot them, execute them to show them that they mean\nbusiness, the Judenrat, they should give -- they didn\u2019t deliver enou -- along -- soon enough the --\nthe ransom. So they killed 10 people -- nine people. So -- so then the Judenrat tried to give -- de-\ndeliver the -- deliver the ransom and we were freed in -- towards the evening. That\u2019s one thing.\nSo every day it was some other kind of -- sort of action again.",
        "Q: What -- what -- what was happening to you? Were you getting depressed, were you getting\nangry?",
        "A: Depressed.",
        "Q: Do you -- do you -- do you remember what it was feeling like?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, we just followed the others, and --",
        "Q: So you were just going to keep going.",
        "A: Keep going. Keep going as long as -- as we could physically. Mentally, just kind of -- it was\n[indecipherable] thing, you know. So you [indecipherable] of -- the ambiti -- you know, ambition\nof doing -- of getting out or something like that, and there\u2019s no way out. No way out. And every\nday something else, they took people. And I worked over there, I worked as a -- in the shop, so\nthe best thing was at work, so they didn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t -- you know, at -- at work we weren\u2019t\nbothered with the -- the SS didn\u2019t bothered with SS, we, as workers we had a lot of people,\neverybody worked at his job was -- was a kind of relief --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- because when we got back to the city, you locked up in the ghetto, you just like a -- oh, a\nclosed -- closed world, you know, you -- you -- th-then it depressed when you come home, when\nyou come to the ghetto. But s -- it -- it -- th-the [indecipherable] we were thinking of escape, but\nwe had no arms, we had nowhere, nothing to escape. You sort of need some arms. Well --",
        "Q: So who -- who are you talking with? Or is -- is there a -- is there a --",
        "A: The ghetto people -- people in ghetto, maybe our -- my -- my friends and myself, we were\ntalking about -- about escaping. But there was tho -- we ha -- we really didn\u2019t know the area, we\ndidn\u2019t know enough. So we waited, we had prepared ourself to escape and something, but we did\nnot move until we\u2019ll get either some bigger group or something like that. Meanwhile, pe -- we\nheard a lot of people being killed. Besides that, every time there\u2019s another incident, another\nreason. We had this -- where we worked we had a one officer who was a supply officer, was this\nSmith and he was -- he\u2019s lo -- a nice -- you know, nice guy, nice guy. He was doing -- so the\nforeman was from Warsaw and he had -- he says he had made trip to -- to Poland. So we ask\nhim, just a joke, you know, can I go with you? He says yes. He took him to Warsaw to his\nfamily, he saw his family in -- in -- in Warsaw and he\u2019s -- when he came back he says, oh,\nWarsaw is -- is [indecipherable] there\u2019s no threat of being killed, you know, like here, we have\nevery day. So he was working hard to go back to Warsaw. He was always dreaming --",
        "Q: To get to Warsaw.",
        "A: -- to go to -- back to Warsaw because it\u2019s so bad here, every day people being killed. And\nanyhow, he -- he didn't succeeded, you know, cause it was -- waited too long, this Smith wa --\nthe Smith was gone and another -- he -- he contacted even -- made a deal with another guy, a\nGerman chauffeur who drove and he collected some friends from Warsaw, those who want to go\nto Warsaw. He -- he brought such a beautiful picture of Warsaw, the black market is so busy,\nwhat -- he saw the good things, I don\u2019t know. I-It was a bad -- but the Warsaw ghetto wasn\u2019t bet\n-- much better, but he saw the good. Maybe his family was involved in business or something\nlike that. And so when he collected the all people, those who want to go in Warsaw, he collect\ntoo the money, and the -- the chauffeur, which is the guy I don\u2019t know how ba -- how goo -- how\nwell he knew him, when he took him in the morning -- in the morning he picked him up, he\npicked up all the passengers and he drove right to the SS. So --",
        "Q: They killed him.",
        "A: They killed him, sure, right away. So, about the doctors, he took it -- they ask for 12 doctors,\nand if a doctor which I have been seeing, he told me he was a cu -- throat and -- and ear\nspecialist. And so I knew him because I\u2019ve seen him a few times, and I met him some other time.\nHe came home running -- he came home with a satchel from a patient and his wife told him to --\nth -- they were here looking for you because they need 12 doctors, and they need for some camp\nwhich -- I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just the -- you know, excuse, I would ge -- to make them feel good,\nthat they\u2019re going to help sick people. And he 1s -- was running to help sick people. There\u2019s some\n[indecipherable] sick people in the camp, which he -- they need 12 doctors. And he missed the --\nthe -- this group, I mean, other words, they were looking for him and they went without. But he\ncame home and his wife told him, he didn\u2019t leave his satchel, he went right away to the Judenrat\nto repe -- report that the -- they were [indecipherable] and there was an SS man or something\nwho still -- he still got -- include him in a group, and they led him away and they killed him right\nat -- right in the s -- not -- you know, into the SS quarter -- headquarters. So this was the daily --\ndaily things what happened, and we thought of escaping. We -- some people tried to escape, I\ndon\u2019t know if they made it. They also didn\u2019t have any arms. The time went by, we worked all\nwinter, and then -- then they were really -- they were coming to us that sort of we heard about the\nmassacres in other towns. Was the people we worked with, sometimes some par -- some people -\n- some peasants came to work and they told us certain towns there were some massacres\n[indecipherable] out, you know, like next town [indecipherable] neighboring towns. So we really\nthought of escapings, you know, but we waiting for -- for y -- we had no organized groups to\nescape. So the -- they -- they was -- they came when the -- in the spring. It was the -- I don\u2019t\nremember the dates. What I remember it was kind of Purim and people -- people are -- people\nwere really celebrating, you know, as quietly, a Purim holiday [indecipherable]. The -- the ghetto\nwas sort of the we -- the people went out to work and I start to go to work with -- they took us to\none like, place where they collected all the people, the working people, all the columns. And a\nlot of people worked outside the ghetto, and they put all these people [indecipherable] waiting\nfor this -- for what, I don\u2019t know. We waited til the ha -- our president, our Judenrat president\nappeared and he says that the German authorities want some 200 people for different -- for\ndifferent work in railroad something. It was really lies, but to make it -- it -- it\u2019s prepa -- a\npreparation for something else, but -- so they took 200 people, other words, let us go to work.\nWe were --those who had to go to work, had to go to work and took some people out of work,\nand at -- at work we found out that -- I don\u2019t know, they took [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know\nwhere to, no -- nobody knew where to, but they took them away. They -- they -- yeah, they took\nout the s -- they went into the ghetto the same time and they took some children and elderly\npeople the same day, in the morning before they went out, we assembled, we got -- we were out\nthere -- out again, the SS called upon the -- our president, the Jewish president, the -- to his of --\nto the office, and they demand three thou -- 4,000 people. Our ghetto had 12,000. Our ghetto --",
        "Q: Had 12,000 Jews.",
        "A: -- had 12,000 Jewish people.",
        "Q: And they wanted 4,000.",
        "A: And there -- they want f -- 4,000.",
        "Q: We have to stop the tape, I\u2019m sorry.\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "Q: You were talking about there were 10,000 Jews in the ghetto, or --",
        "A: 12.",
        "Q: Or 12,000, and --",
        "A: 12,000.",
        "Q: -- they were looking for 4,000. So they were going to kill 4,000?",
        "A: When they were ready -- the SS, I\u2019m talking --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- was demanding, they called up Mr. Isikson, he was the ch -- the head of -- the president of\nthe Judenrat, while we in the -- in that area together out of the ghetto.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And they want the amount of people -- some amount of people, they called Isikson and\ndemand he should deliver the kids, the elderly, and to make up 4,000 -- they wanted 4,000\npeople. They want 4,000 people. And Isikson was [indecipherable] and he -- he says, you ask me\nfor gold, money, I give you. But ma -- people and their kids, you have to come and get yourself.",
        "Q: Because he knew what they were gonna do.",
        "A: Yeah. So at that time they figured they have to do it, you know, and they gonna do it by\nthemselves. So the ghetto was already [indecipherable] the SS, and things like that. They took\nout people -- we were at the -- assembled outside in the place on the -- outside the ghetto, the\nworking people.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So our -- our -- our chef -- the head, took out his pe -- a lot of people, German and officers\nwho had the people working for them came and took their people out of work. So those who\nworked for the German [indecipherable] organizations, German [indecipherable] could go to\nwork.",
        "Q: So they were protected in some way.",
        "A: They were.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So we go to work, we didn\u2019t know if -- what is going to happen now. They -- they were\nprotected, so there\u2019s -- they wanted to keep the workers still working, while they take -- and they\nwant to take the kids and the elderly, a-and to get 4,000 in the first place, for them. So is --\nIsikson refused, s-so they let them go home, and we, sort of after we heard what\u2019s going on, we\nstayed in the place, we didn't go ho -- go to work -- go to -- home after work --",
        "Q: You stayed there.",
        "A: -- the same day. We didn\u2019t go home. And we did hide in our -- and rarely you find a place to\nhide, until we\u2019ll -- the things what we heard what\u2019s going on [indecipherable] in the ghetto. So --\nand towards the evening, we sort of were told to go to get ready to go home, to go to the ghetto.\nSo we were about 73 people, those who remained hiding inside, they didn\u2019t want -- want to go\n[indecipherable] and we didn\u2019t go before, but now they want to wait, they said they -- they have\nto go to the ghetto, you had to go home. And here we still heard the news from -- and we heard\nthe guns -- machine guns, that they\u2019re still killing people. So there was question, you know, was\nlike going to a ghetto, you going right into -- to the open -- to this slaughter. So the people were\nafraid to go, but they had to -- they had to sort of make sure to -- to stay. If they could stay, they\nwould say if they could stay here in the -- in the place of work another night, would be good. So\none lady came into my tailoring room with a gold watch and she put the watch down and said --\nshe told me, go in and talk to the -- our head. Rudel is the head of the -- our officers, if -- to bribe\nhim, he should let us stay one night more. If they a -- the slaughter will go by. So I said -- looked\nat her, I said, you -- you know, you crazy, because I -- this man never came into me, I\n[indecipherable] he doesn\u2019t know me, cause the others -- officers work -- came in for work, he\nnever came in to work -- for work. And so is -- but til -- she left the watch, she walked out, you\ndo it. I says, that\u2019s the only way out -- she said, whether I could -- could do it, and think to do it.\nAnd I was sitting 1n [indecipherable] says, she is crazy. I mean, he never -- he never came -- he\nnever know me -- he never came to me, and I can-cannot go bribing somebody like that, you\nknow, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s ridiculous. Well, waiting, waiting, waiting, and there\u2019s no other solution, so the\npe -- so people says, well, what can you -- what would you do? What can you do? Well, I said,\n[ll -- have no choice and I have to go, whatever is -- if -- if I wouldn\u2019t do that, you say, oh, if\nyou would have gone, you have -- do -- did something, it -- it would have -- 1t would have been\nsomething. Now, we are really without any he -- without any help. So I took this watch and I\nwalked over, this is one barrack where the officers lived, and I have that [indecipherable]\neverything over there in one bag. I walked over and I -- I la -- never was in this office, never\nwent -- I knew more or less where the doors -- it\u2019s right the first door. So I knocked the door, and\nhe says, enter [indecipherable]. So I walked in and Is -- was -- had to stand on the rear door, I\ndidn\u2019t move. I just walked in, I didn\u2019t move, because his -- this room, the decorations around\ngive you a Sc -- give you such a scare, all this Hackenkreuz 1s -- banners hanging and the\n[indecipherable], the Hitler and Goerings and everything all around. Is -- is just like Goering or\nsomething, or some other officer in his office in -- in a -- in the back of the room, and in a -- ina\nde -- on the desk. And I says -- so -- so he says, well, well, was -- what do I want -- what do you\nwant? Say, I want to talk to you. So he -- he sits in a [indecipherable] so come here. I walk over\nand I didn\u2019t ask anything, I took out the watch and put on the table. He says -- I says, look, this is\nwhat we have, what one of the ladies have and she doesn\u2019t need it, because if we go home the\nghetto we gonna be killed anyhow, you might use it, s -- give it -- send it to you. One of your\nfamily, I don\u2019t know whether he was married or not, never knew. He says to me in a quiet way,\nhe says take it back, I don\u2019t want it, I don\u2019t need it. [indecipherable] and I le -- I look at him and I\nwas -- I don\u2019t see the same person. He -- he asks me to sit down, and you know what -- what\nhappen. And I sit down, I says, take the watch. Forget it, he says, take it back, and nothing going\nto happen to you. It\u2019s over. In other words, this load is over. And nothing is going to happen to\nyou, nothing is going to happen. I said, well I still hear the guns. He says, I -- I have or -- I have\ninformation, he says. So I walk out and -- with this news, and I told the guys waiting for me, and\nI told them that we could go home and nothing is going to happen, it\u2019s over. Meanwhile, we still\nheard the guns, we still heard the machine guns go. And time goes shorter and we -- we have to\ngo soon, at six o\u2019clock we going home. So they said to me, look, we going to go a column with\npeople, with 70 people. They don\u2019t know who we are or what ev -- what kind of [indecipherable]\nwe have. See -- do something, tal-talk to him, see if maybe he\u2019Il send somebody to explain to the\nguards, you know. Well, I said, maybe they\u2019re right, but since I saw that he is -- didn\u2019t -- he -- he\nnot, you know, the same guy is over there. So I went over and I -- again, I says that the people\nare afraid to go because they don\u2019t know where they will -- if they know what we are, who we\nare or something like that. And I said, if you would have [indecipherable] I mean, I thought -- as\nI thought -- if you would go with us to lu -- I mean, to the gate and te -- explain who we are. So\nhe was thinking a few minutes. Okay, I'll go. So he got into his car and he drove ahead and we\nmarched with 12 guards, of Air Force guards to the ghetto. And it was not complete over, but it\nwas over. At that moment, when we came to the gates, we saw Mr. Isikson was led out by SS.\nTwo guys took him and his assistant to their car and put them away -- took him away, for good.\nSo that\u2019s why, he did -- he didn\u2019t obey the orders. He didn\u2019t give them the 4,000 people. He\nmade [indecipherable] -- so that\u2019s what it is. I mean, they -- they ne -- appointed another guy for\nJudenrat, for -- they appointed another guy.",
        "Q: You -- you said that --",

        "A: But they weren't that finished, they didn\u2019t clean up -- they didn\u2019t -- til they put a -- bore out\nthe juden -- the -- Mr. Isikson, and then they opened the gates and -- to get -- to let in us, our\npeople. My pe -- my group of people.",
        "Q: Right. How did you know what Isikson had said, that he refused? Is that --",
        "A: When I came in the ghetto --",
        "Q: People told you?",
        "A: -- the guy who was the Judenrat man, told us.",
        "Q: That that\u2019s why he was taken.",
        "A: [indecipherable] a part of the Judenrat, not the -- nobody was a -- but he pol -- told us -- he\ntold us he was -- around the ghetto he was a member of the Judenrat and he was supposed to be -\n- to accompany the SS when they lo -- loaded the people on trucks, out to the -- to the shooting\nplace. But before, when I left him since -- first time, when I went out his door, another officer\nwhich used to come into me with a lot of work [indecipherable] well, no f -- more kind of -- he\nobviously used to talk, have a d -- you know, he -- he used to come in more often, and he\n[indecipherable] with me. And he says -- he told me where I work -- where I been working, you\nknow, like a front yard [indecipherable] 150 yards, and he start -- he\u2019s talking to me in working,\nthat this morning, he says, they took us, all the officers, not only us, but officers in the whole\ntown who have workers -- officer who work here, and the -- for the germ -- German officers,\nthey took him -- they took them to show the slaughter [indecipherable]. They -- they -- the way\nthey -- what they -- what they do, they want to show off how they kill the people, and he says --\nMr. Lindow, Mr. Lindow says unthinkable, unbelievable, he says. What they did, it\u2019s\nunbelievable, unthinkable. How\u2019d they do it? He probably didn\u2019t want to go too long with --\nwalk along outside with me, but this few steps he did it, he told me what happened. In other\nwords they all -- and he -- and he [indecipherable] was along with them. And that probably gave\nhim a shock, and he changed. He changed to a degree that was such the completely different. He\nwas really -- he was really -- he didn\u2019t know what to do. He was -- you know, I couldn\u2019t\nrecognize him. You know, he walked around, he didn\u2019t say a word, he didn\u2019t say to u -- to u -- to\nthe others. S-So that was -- his story was -- didn\u2019t end yet because soon after, we -- groups -- we\nhad a resistance group in the ghetto, and we escaped. And with some arms left, we had a nice\nbunker. I build a bunker which is we had some arms, the resistance had some arms, and we sort\nof prepared for resistance. And since they took us out from the ghetto [indecipherable] resistance\nwasn\u2019t working.",
        "Q: Couldn't happen.",
        "A: It couldn\u2019t happen. But when we came back, some of my arms, my bunker wasn\u2019t dis --\nwasn\u2019t discovered. I mean, they found a lot of bunkers and they dis -- confiscated a lot of arms,\nwhich we prepared for the resistance.",
        "Q: Where did you get arms? Where did you get weapons from?",
        "A: Well, we had y -- you know, y -- our people worked to collect the arms from the Russian\nmilitary. When they gave up, they left in the woods and the fields, so they had to collect these, so\nthe people from the ghetto worked this -- with this comp -- with this group to bring the arms, so\nthey smuggled in these arms, from rifles to grenades, you know, as much as they could. So I had\nthe -- my -- my -- my friend Tanchim was -- was the head from my group, we had five in a group\nprepared. And our -- we -- since we had a rifle and grenades in our -- in our bunker, and our\nbunker was not found. So, in other words, we planned an escape and it\u2019s the only arms we had,\nthe others were confiscated. And we prepared an escape. We didn\u2019t know which way, whether\nthrough the ghetto, cut the g -- cut the barbed wires, or from the place we work, from the airfield\n-- airfield. It took us time to get this -- smuggle the arm -- we decided to escape from the airport,\nand so our people were the electricians. Our people who were from our resistance group, they\nworked -- they were electricians and they worked out in the airfield, further out, and over there at\nthe airfield we walked around free. We didn\u2019t -- even though we had patches and things like that,\nnobody bothered us.",
        "Q: But they were -- the electricians were farther away than you were.",

        "Q: The -- the electricians were farther away than you were?",
        "A: No, no, they were --",

        "A: The same airfield, but they were in -- into the airfield that they are almost like further out in\nthe [indecipherable] they worked th -- the electrician --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] installations, so they worked out further, so we -- they explained that\nthere\u2019s some bushes we could stay there all day long, go to work and from work, the little -- this\n-- you know, single people could go there to the point where we ha -- go together and in the\nevening, we\u2019ll escape with the whole group.",
        "Q: Now can -- can I ask you something?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Were -- were there -- a number of resistance groups in the ghetto?",
        "A: There were what?",
        "Q: Were there a number of resistance groups in the ghetto, not just yours, there were other ones?",
        "A: There were the other two, yeah.",
        "Q: There were two more?",
        "A: Two",
        "Q: Two more?",
        "A: There were, in general, two resistance groups, separate, you know, but they -- different plans,\nwe had different plans. But at this point the ghetto was already divided again, smaller and\n[indecipherable] and there -- and there was a lot of people --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know [indecipherable] cause the resistance lost a lot of people, even those -- our own\npeople. So the other escape was planned for my group, plans with our arms [indecipherable] in\nour basement [indecipherable] but still it was on the other side, the ghetto was cut off shorter.\nYou know, they -- there were less people, they cut -- they cut the ghetto shorter.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So even though there were -- our arms were in the other side, behind barbed wire, but we\nmanaged to go through [indecipherable] guys -- the guys went over at night [indecipherable] get\ninto -- brought into the new ghetto, our arms --",
        "Q: So they went over the fence?",
        "A: Cut the wires.",
        "Q: They cut the wires?",
        "A: Cut the wires, and we watched the guards. The guards were going back and forth.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we want to get these arm back to the place where worked at the airport -- at the airfield.\nFrom there we planned to escape. As we --",
        "Q: Can I ask you something?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: This sounds different from --",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: This -- this kind of behavior, for you --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- being in the resistance, seems different than what you did before.",
        "A: Different?",
        "Q: So what -- what made you join the resistance?",
        "A: What made join the resistance is simply because you cannot go to the slaughter like sheeps.",
        "Q: So you wanted to do something.",
        "A: Wanted [inaudible], and of course there was no, assurance, you know. Sure, it\u2019s a lost battle,\nbut you want to have a resistance, as much as we could do.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: As much as we could do. And we [indecipherable] arms, their arms are better, but we knew\nit\u2019s not the same -- it\u2019s not the same as -- it\u2019s not a even struggle. But we got to do something.\nBut later on, when it turned out that we were left with a few arms only, and the -- and most of the\nresistant people were killed in -- in the ghetto, so [indecipherable] there were left, we were 24\npeople together, we made the escape.",
        "Q: And when was the escape, do you know?",
        "A: When the escape?",
        "Q: About.",
        "A: About, it was October, something like that.",
        "Q: Was it cold, snowy, or --",
        "A: Oh, cold, really [indecipherable] was sep -- August, it is the end of September, octo --\nsomething like that. Preparation, you know, it was kind of -- til we moved back the arms to the --\nyou know, we got -- you have to esca -- the escape has to be -- if you\u2019re not armed you cannot\nescape. I mean, you can escape --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- but to make sure, it\u2019s better -- 1t\u2019s assurance, if you have something, it feels -- you feel\nstronger. I know it --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- I know when [indecipherable] and we had the hand grenades for the rest of the people, so\nwe hand out just the one hand grenade, makes you so strong that you feel -- you walk differently,\nyou have, you know, a little more courage, you -- so you -- at least you have some ar -- some --\nsome resistance. And we [indecipherable] we made it, we made the escape. Later on we sh -- we\ngot out the arms outside to the airfield over there and we -- the arms were hidden in the bushes\nand then we made the escape. We made the group together, little by little --",
        "Q: This is 24 pe --",
        "A: -- single -- single people.",
        "Q: -- uh-huh.",
        "A: Single few people just [indecipherable] not going one group, but just we knew that we\u2019re in\nthe group together, little by little and we -- we grouped together at [indecipherable] you know,\nit\u2019s [indecipherable] now. You know it\u2019s a little -- in September -- is it -- was it October, or that\u2019s\n-- or something like that, something like -- 1t was -- the summer was over. And -- and days are --\nand people -- what the guys who worked there, and they came later, told us what -- when we\nwere escaped and then the foreman is counting us, that -- and he reported to -- to the Rudel that\n24 people missing. He says they escaped. So -- so he -- s -- that\u2019s what they told us, that Rudel\nsaid, in -- in German, yeah, when they\u2019Il -- Wenn sie rieten Kennen losen die Laufen. That\u2019s the\n-- when -- when they can save themselves, let them -- let them run. So he was the -- he became a\ndifferent man and he chose later, if you want to finish his story, his story didn\u2019t end yet, cause\nwhen we entered -- when we came to the parti -- partisan -- we met partisans, Russian partisans,\nthey sort of were very anti-Semitic, but they [indecipherable] you -- you have to -- you have no\narms, you know, you\u2019re not armed. We had our -- the rifles were -- he said, is not -- not enough.\nYou cannot fight, he says, with this, you gotta get arms. So you gotta send out here -- do\nsomething, you know, he was really pushing us to -- to some point that you couldn't say no, was\n-- so he says, you gotta send out people to get arms, or to do some sabotage work. You couldn\u2019t\ndo it if the fe -- you\u2019re not armed you can\u2019t anything, but anyhow, we -- the -- our leaders did\nsend out --",
        "Q: Can -- can you hold that thought, because we have to make a change of the tape.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: So the arms, we\u2019ll start there.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "Q: Henry, let me ask you something. This group that you are talking about, where they\u2019re saying\nto you you have to go and get arms in order to be able to be in this group, cause you -- you didn't\ncome out with enough -- is that the first group you were with?",
        "A: That was the first group. There was another --",
        "Q: Wi -- how did you know where to go? You leave the ghetto --",
        "A: That\u2019s -- that -- it\u2019s interesting, you know, and it\u2019s true, you know, you\u2019re a -- good question,\nbecause we didn\u2019t know, we weren't -- we never -- we didn\u2019t grow up over there, we were mostly\nmore from -- most of the group probably people from -- from Poland --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- on the other side, but some people promise they know the law, they know the area, but it\ndidn\u2019t work -- it didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know if they told the truth. They just probably want to go to ca -\n- take part in the escape and they promised they know. Is -- you know, that happened a lot of\nthings which are not expected, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But we have inside pe -- we had now a group people, intelligent and people that -- we had sa -\n- little map -- they had some o -- little map, they -- they could [indecipherable]. Well, this guy\nMuszinski, he was a Polish -- from Poland, also, from Czestochowa, and he -- he was electrician,\ngood elect -- and he was also very intelligent. He sort of | -- looked at the map, little map and he\ncould -- could see how to get out, and he was y -- a little work here, he could see the -- there was\na railroad, small rail tracks like they been carrying woods from the woods -- from the woods, all\nwood from the woods [indecipherable] get to this tracks, will be on the right track, in other, will\ngo through -- the track goes through the woods. He figured out this here. So that was the -- that\nwas the real intelligent judgment in the -- in this case.",
        "Q: But how do you then find a resistance group, the partisans outside?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: Was it an accident that you came upon it?",
        "A: Accidentally.",
        "Q: Accid --",
        "A: Knew -- we knew where -- we knew as we -- we -- we grew closer, we -- as we came closer to\nthe, you know, wooded areas, peasants gi -- you know, the peasants yi -- more or less gave us\ndirections wi -- where the -- which other side -- see, the other side the river. See, if you go the\nother side the river, you find them.",
        "Q: You'll find them.",
        "A: And it\u2019s true. It was -- it was the river Sharra, and if you go the other side the river, we found\nthem.",
        "Q: Now what are you wearing?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: What are you wearing? It\u2019s cold by then, right? It\u2019s almost winter.",
        "A: [indecipherable] got -- I remember what -- what I have. We didn't have very warm clothes.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember sh -- well, I don\u2019t remember extremely what -- if we have a\n[indecipherable] it was a problem, you know, at the moment you didn\u2019t think about it. You know",
        "Q: Was it cold?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Was it cold?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t cold yet, no, it wasn\u2019t cold yet. It was very chi-chilly sometimes at night, but it\nwasn\u2019t cold yet. It wasn\u2019t --",
        "Q: And everybody who leaves are men, young boys --",
        "A: Is what?",

        "A: No, no children.",
        "Q: But about 24 people?",
        "A: 24 people in this group. And we had only with two rifles. You know, one ri -- was in my\nbunker, and the other one was someone else\u2019s.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: A Russian girls. And, you know, some hand grenades, because the girls brought hand\ngrenades. Where they worked, they smuggled hand grenades easier than --",
        "Q: I see, right.",
        "A: -- yeah, for the girls to smuggle ah -- into the ghetto. And --",
        "Q: So you find it --",
        "A: -- it was something like we have something to do, you know, we had some resistance with a --\nwhatever we could.

        "Q: That was what was important.",
        "A: That was important.",
        "Q: So you folks, the 24 of you --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- get to this first group. So who is this group, do you even know who they are? These are\nRussians?",
        "A: People --",
        "Q: These are ru -- yeah.",
        "A: -- oh, to the ma -- oh that\u2019s another thing, we don\u2019t know the other -- we don\u2019t know the\npeople.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know them.",
        "A: No --",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- with a -- well, that -- when we found them, they were not good to us, they\u2019re not friendly,\nthey were anti-Semitic.",
        "Q: They were anti-Semitic?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And they knew you were Jewish, of course?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: They knew you were Jewish?",
        "A: Oh sure, they knew we came together. There was one Ukraine guy who was -- he was sort of\nthe head of -- not the head, but he was the s -- spoke to us in a manner like, in other words, why\ndid you come here? You gave the gold to -- to the Germans. In other -- you gave the -- you gave\nth -- you gave the gold to the Germans, and you came here, in other words, empty handed. You\ncame here --",
        "Q: Empty ha --",
        "A: -- you came here what, to save your life, he said. Well -- and -- but, he says, well you have to\nshow that you really want to fight the -- back. Fight the [indecipherable]. You have no arms, so\nyou have to go and get arms, and you get whatever you can sabotage, whatever you can do. So\nma -- well, our guys went to start to do something, to think about something. So we send out four\ndifferent -- four different groups to show -- to go, as they say -- as they have demanded, they\nhave demanded to go out to get arms, or to do sabotage. So one guy from our group -- from --\nwho worked at the electricians, he said he\u2019ll go back to the transformers, he\u2019Il destroy the\ntransformers in the airport. It\u2019s a big sabotage [indecipherable] and all the -- to -- young kids,\nthey said they worked with -- for a ye -- they worked for police, they worked, you know, from\nthe ghetto they went out to work to the police, railroad police, those who carried the prisoners\nand thing, or my people are [indecipherable] to the camps, or those prison -- those have a police\nforce, they have a police force and they worked for them. So they -- so they go and see if they\ncould get some arms over there. And the third one -- the third group 1s just to get int -- the\ninformation to go near the railroad, to see the -- bring the information, the movement, what kind\nof -- what kind of movement it is, what cargo, military or some that. So there were fo -- and then\nthere\u2019s another group which just simply -- I don\u2019t know whether you figure to go get some arms.\nAnd those four -- four guys, you know, they went out, they didn\u2019t have arms with them. They\nweren't armed, but they went to look for arms, which was really --",
        "Q: So these are guys going alone?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: These are guys going alone or in their small groups?",
        "A: In their s -- no, alone, they --",
        "Q: They\u2019re alone?",
        "A: -- some of them are alone, some of them with small group.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]. And are you going at all?",
        "A: No, I --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- not go --",
        "Q: You're staying.",
        "A: -- they were going. I [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t go there. But I was [indecipherable] you know,\nto the other one.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So the others has way -- they have -- they have some sort of place where they could find it,\nmaybe they had in the mind somewheres to go where they could find some arms. And those fo-\nfour guys, those four guys were killed right away, out -- when they stepped -- you know, the first\n-- the first -- they -- the German patrol right away killed them as soon they went out on the other\nside, the outside of the camps, you know, they -- you know, an hour later, something like that.\nThese four gu -- and the other guy, they went wi -- to -- went to blow up the transformers, they\nwent -- came -- went back to the pu -- in other words, the place where we were and he was\nspotted -- he was mix -- miggling -- mixing with jig -- the guy still which working there, he was\nplay like one of them, and then stay overnight and do his job. While he was hanging around\nthere, a Polish guy knew his -- that he escaped in the partisans [indecipherable] worked with the\nJewish guys and they were talking about he -- that Moishe Polak 1s -- is in the partisans. And\nthen he sees him here. He sur -- he informed the SS. And they -- they came and picked him up\nand brought him for interrogation and one SS officer was sitting next [indecipherable] his table,\nand nic -- is sort of asking questions. And he had a hand grenade with for -- from our group, the\nguy, he pulled out the hand grenade. So the officer saw the hand grenade, he went out the room.\nAnd he wants to blow himself up --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- with the hand grenade, but the hand grenade didn\u2019t go off. So he opened the window, and\njust -- he jumped out and killed himself jumping out the window.",
        "Q: Mm. So right away it\u2019s a tragedy, right?",
        "A: Yeah. Boys cry [indecipherable] cry. All the others have also su -- they all succeeded, but the\nfour guys who were killed the first were people who worked in our place.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And they, when they were killed, they had their documents on them, the -- the -- their I.D.\u2019s.\nSo they knew where they worked. So went back and they had this, the SS went back to the work\n-- to the place where they worked, and tried to find -- to find out how come they don\u2019t know --\nthey didn\u2019t know that they escaped. Said, when did they escape? So the -- they -- they went to\nthe far [indecipherable] it\u2019s an office where they keep their registers and the files from all the\nworkers. And they were looking for the files for these guys, and they couldn\u2019t find them. So they\nask these clerks, is there missing files? Well, he -- he said that Rudel, man was here, he took out\nthe files, say you don\u2019t know, you know, for what reason they too -- took out. He took out and\ndestroyed them, like we never existed.",
        "Q: Existed.",
        "A: So that was -- he didn\u2019t call -- when we escaped he didn\u2019t alarm the SS, that\u2019s one thing. He\ndidn\u2019t go to chase us [indecipherable] us -- he was it -- and so, in other words, and then he\nfigured that he\u2019Il take out the -- the files, nobody will look in -- will -- nobody will know that we\nescaped. So meanwhile the SS arrested Rudel and as they -- later on the guys came, they came\nafter us, some of them managed to escape, the last -- the last -- the last -- from our -- from\n[indecipherable] we were -- told us about that, how he was arrested and court-martialed. So I felt\nI -- I felt that he [indecipherable] was talking to him that he -- he went through a tremendous\nchange, being that he was a devoted Nazi and could not -- he would not expect that kind of scene\nwhich is -- you know, it could break down a lot of people, but he broke down even though he\u2019s a\n-- he was a devoted Nazi.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It broke him down. And you know ho mak -- how much -- how strong they are what it is and\nyou know, but you never know is a [indecipherable] a man 1s just a human being\n[indecipherable] could break down anybody. So that\u2019s what the ir -- we heard of these guys who\ncame later, what he -- what happened to him, and he -- and he was court-martialed and\npresumably -- I don\u2019t know what -- which way, or -- it\u2019s hard to find them. I then -- go to find --",
        "Q: How do you spell his name, do you know?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: How do you spell his name?",
        "A: I don\u2019t exactly know, but I 1 --",
        "Q: Is it R-u-d-e-1? Or --",
        "A: R-u -- R-u-d -- R-u-d-e-l",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And the -- this -- we had still a struggle and -- and the others over the -- cause this group was\nvery anti-Semitic, with -- the ones that were -- gave us orders to go. We had such a -- really, we\nlost so many people right away, the first fr -- right in the first step, lost two -- two of the good\npeople. Two of this and the three [indecipherable]. And -- and the main thing 1s what -- is where\nthey were not instructed how t-to do it, how to go. They were strange, you know, and they -- out\nfrom the woods, they know -- they didn\u2019t know if you can go by a daytime or at night. You\nknow, some of them go dangerous places, you don\u2019t go in broad daylight, you -- you wait until --\ntil it\u2019s getting dark, or complete night. They were not giving instructions at all, they just send\nthem out to be killed or something like that.",
        "Q: So what happened in that group? Did you stay there, or did you folks leave?",
        "A: Fa -- we didn\u2019t stay long with them, because they were really very -- like whole group were\nreally -- like how could I say, they -- they told us -- they ma -- called them ex-convicts. I mean,\nyou know, like --",
        "Q: Ex-convicts? Did they seem like criminal --",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] Russian -- them Russian -- the Russians, they open the jails you know,\nthe [indecipherable] they were vicious guys, killers. They could kill [indecipherable] even, very\neasy, and --",
        "Q: How did they treat the women who were in the group?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: How did they treat the women?",
        "A: How they treat the women?",
        "Q: The women -- you are -- the women who came with your group.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t bother our women, but they had their own.",
        "Q: They had their own women.",
        "A: Yeah, they had their own women. Every [indecipherable] is a different -- different way of --\nbut, they were horrible. They were horrible and their behavior wasn\u2019t good, and their treatment.\nThey really let [indecipherable] we could not stay there longer, but was -- they were robbing us,\nand they robbed our arms, and the shoes, some good shoes they took off. People came from the\nghetto still when the ghetto was there and they had something, some valuables, s-something, they\nrobbed them.",
        "Q: They took it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, they weren\u2019t afraid. They always took shoes off, they [indecipherable] watches\n[indecipherable] the handgun and som -- so they took away. You see, the handgun is only for\nofficers. You don\u2019t have to --",
        "Q: Handguns are only for officers?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, only for officers. That\u2019s the excuse.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: [indecipherable] explain, why did you -- why did you take -- you know. Oh that -- that -- this\n-- a handgun is only for officers here.",
        "Q: So tell me, did your group have a leader of some kind?",
        "A: Yeah, the -- we have a leader what -- he couldn\u2019t do much. [indecipherable] have a leaders,\nyou have two leaders, you have a co -- a few guys which are sort of in the leadership sure. Well,\nthey were still in the -- in the ghetto, there were leaders, so they -- some of them were still\nleaders in the group.",
        "Q: So who made the decision to leave? All of you together, or --",
        "A: To leave to go out?",
        "Q: To go -- no, to go to another group, you [indecipherable] this first --",

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So you had to find a -- we found out that there -- another group is coming to this area, and --\nand it\u2019s -- it is an entire different area. They came from -- from a Slonim are -- area that\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nanother region where the pe -- the German had big, big raids there. A division with mi -- the\narmy diverted to clean -- to -- to clean out their -- their trads -- their groups. They were a big\nunit, you know, a big movement --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- of different groups, lot of groups. So they moved towards us, they were going to go further\ne -- further east. So some of the groups also split up. There was a -- a Jewish group, what with a\nRussian com -- commander, so we figured well maybe it\u2019s a good -- so we got the idea to go. We\nhave to leave anyhow, this area is -- couldn\u2019t stay longer.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so we -- we managed to merge with them. And --",

This is a group, a -- a group which splinter also, they -- they were a big\nbrigades and they broke up in the smaller groups because they been running from -- they been\ngoing east, so they couldn\u2019t go in one big brigade, there were a few hundred people. So they\nbroke up these small groups, and in this one was a Jewish group and we -- we -- some of them\ngot together, and we merged with them.",
        "Q: And who was the leader of that group? Was there a leader?",
        "A: They had a leader, they have a -- they had a Russian leader.",
        "Q: A Russian leader?",
        "A: Yeah. They had a Russian leader, and they figured that was better. And we told the Russian\nleader, you know, where we were there, that the -- these guys before, they -- they killing the --\nmany people come from ghetto, they been killed there -- a lot of people have been killed.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And he says why don\u2019t you meet with this [indecipherable] we told him that you -- you\ncommanding us, why don\u2019t you meet with these guys, the Gorkinsens and tell them why the --\nand ask them why did they kill people when they come from the ghetto? So he met with this\ncommander there, Tsygankov and he says, why do you kill th -- all Jewish people, they come\nfrom the ghetto. So he says, don\u2019t worry, 1f Pll kill a hundred -- a hundred Jews, and one of --\nand one would have been a spy, I would be f -- I would be justified. That\u2019s a -- that\u2019s the answer",

        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Yeah, they give you such answers, so much reason now [indecipherable] he brings you a -- a -\n-a good reason, kill a spy. But it\u2019s not a spy and not the -- not the spy, they just wants to kill the\nJews --",
        "Q: Jews",

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Couple months later there was a -- a -- you see, the -- the marshes freeze in the winter and so\nthey had the -- the lake froze, so the German gro -- the militia what they had -- they had also\nBelarussian militia in there, they teamed up with the German SS, and they raided our camp,\nwhich it was easy to -- to come over because the -- the lake was frozen in the winter, and\nattacked us. We didn\u2019t have any casualties, but we just escaped, just -- just -- and the trouble\nstarted then with this -- you couldn't -- and things changed, this -- this Russian commander sort\nof was good, so long, til is -- he took in some Russian escapees from camp, or whom -- who\nwere [indecipherable] Russian guys, and they didn\u2019t like the way they -- they said the Jews are\nlazy bum -- you know, the Jews are really -- so the [indecipherable] so he -- he sort of agitated,\nyou know, to be -- you know, h-he wasn\u2019t anti-Semitic before, but he -- what they -- what they\ngave him lessons or something, I don\u2019t know. And he changed, he changed, he wasn\u2019t the -- he\nlistened to them, the -- get rid of the Jews, get rid of the Jews, get a -- since then he decided -- he\nsort of took a group of Jews, small group and try to get [indecipherable] he don\u2019t want to. So\n[indecipherable] them, he took a -- went east. So he | -- he left us -- he left the group from -- this\nBaranovichi group, probably [indecipherable] th-they separated -- they separate us again, cause,\nyou know, it\u2019s over. The raids broke the whole thing --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the -- the -- th-the -- he was changed, was became also anti-Semitic, yeah, because they -\n- they told him, they te -- they gave him a lesson.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And he learned it.",
        "A: They gave him a lesson, and again --",
        "Q: We have to stop the tape.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Seven\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "Q: Okay, we left off and you said you were left alone, that this -- this guy just left you by\nyourselves again, right? Or you decided to leave? The second group. The second -- the second\nresistance group you were in.",
        "A: The second, when we merged with the other group?",
        "Q: Yes, but then -- then you split from them, right? Cause this guy, th-the guy who seemed not to\nbe anti-Semitic became anti-Semitic.",
        "A: Oh, the -- Pugachov. That -- it was something that -- we went back -- we still had a Jewish\ngroup in existence, I mean, since they went back -- they went, they left people and they left the\ner -- us, and were -- now, who does that? They have -- the g -- the group originally, which was a\ns -- was sort of dismantled because you had a raid and people were running in different\ndirections, til they grouped together it took a long time, couple weeks because you spread out\nwho knows where, because it was a big raid. Took a couple days until they burned the village,\nand took a few days and they were -- we were spreading out in the depths from the woods\nsomewheres. We didn\u2019t know how fa -- long they stay, but they were -- tried to go back, but they\nwere still stay -- the German forces were thi -- still in the village for a few days, you know, that\u2019s\nunheard of -- it was unheard of til then, how long they stayed, they want to clean up -- clean out\nthis area. So -- but this commander of this group Pugachov is a Russian guy, and he start ta --\ntaking -- getting in more people like from the Russian prisoners -- Russian guys, prisoners,\nescaped prisoners. And -- and there were s -- they were anti-Semitic, and they sort of talked them\nin.",
        "Q: Right, you had said that.",
        "A: Yeah, I said --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: So to [indecipherable] against -- well, it turned out they eliminate Jewish people because they\nwere the majority, and -- and they [indecipherable] the things to be there, they had the\ncommander, he gave them everything. He was like a big -- big commander, do -- do nothing. So\nthen there was a -- a call to go east, partisans should group east wa -- 1-1n deep -- deeper\n[indecipherable] because they could group together bigger units -- bigger partisan brigades, so\nthey, because the German -- four German battalions were really active in -- in raids, and they\nfigure if they th -- if they were grouped together, they still be stronger resistance and they would\nnot be able to eliminate these group. So he delayed that call til -- delayed until finally after the\nraid, and these two fr -- fre -- couple friends, the Russian escapees talked them in and say, he got\n-- he gotta do something, in other words, so he left. Half of the group behind it -- he\n[indecipherable] from the old -- his old Jewish friends, the others, and the Russians, guys, and he\ntook off east, he left us alone. We had eight -- four rifles -- four rifles, very little arms. In other\nwords, we were a lot of pe -- we were 36 people, something. And we tried to stay and maintain\nwhatever we could do, try to get some contact, we couldn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t find any contact with\nany other groups. So we\u2019re by ourselves. But the Gorkinsens, these were after us. They want to\nget rid of us in that area. They don\u2019t want us in this area because it\u2019s their -- their area, they say\nit\u2019s their territory.",
        "Q: So the -- the partisans want to get rid of you.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s the Russian -- the Gorkinsens, yeah.",

        "A: They want to get rid of us and they don\u2019t -- they no -- they don\u2019t want us at all in that area.\nThey says, the -- the Jew, they -- they sort of a-afraid for their securities, not sec -- we are n -- we\nare ruining their hiding place -- their places [indecipherable] it\u2019s ust ma -- excuses.

        "Q: Henry, what was your role in the resistance? Now that you\u2019ve been in for almost a year, I\nthink, what were you doing?",

        "A: Before, y -- there was no -- you know, just pa -- comepra -- pa-patrol and that\u2019s all, nothing\nmuch. Patrolling the area was it. Patrol --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, and you\u2019re patrolling what? You\u2019re patrolling to make sure the Germans are not\nthere, or what?",
        "A: Patrolling is so s -- you know, we been -- as we were s -- before, a separate group, we been\nraided.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And we -- we had s -- we lost stuff -- we lost the camp. They raided camp and we had to leave\nto the other side. So now we have to do it more secure they -- around the camp. So we had to\npatrol around the areas with excess roads, watch the ol -- the oncoming [indecipherable] or raids\nor something. So sort of -- sort of tried to be more careful now, cause we | -- we | -- almost lost\ntwo people, cause they were wounded in that raid, in the first raid. So that was my doing now\nwith --",

        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Coming closer to our camp, we had to evacuate, go somewhere else. In the first place, it a fo -\n- before that happened, we -- there were four others, they -- they -- we got from -- left for -- for\nus, for this group, the Gorkinsens want -- came to that [indecipherable] and they says lets -- you\nhave to go for a certain operation. The arm -- you have to s -- give me -- send all armed men with\nus, all the -- so we send four guys, we have four -- four arms, four guys. And they -- when they\ncame to the point where the -- they were introduced [indecipherable], this 1s the man in -- in\ncommand of this operation, he says he wants to look through the arms, everybody should check\ntheir arms. So he -- they let them check their arms, but they never gave back. They rob their arms\nin a nice way, in a nice way, in a tricky way. In a tricky way they robbed the arms, and the --\nwhen they came home without arms, we say that -- that\u2019s the end of us. We have no choice now,\nwe -- I don\u2019t know, we have to do something. Well, it was t -- it was tough without arms, we\ncouldn\u2019t -- without arms you can\u2019t -- can\u2019t even get food, you know. So we waited. In\nmeanwhile, the -- the -- the river was flowing and the camps a way -- and our camp was sort of\ngetting more water and water, you see? Soon enough, we\u2019ll probably -- we\u2019ll have to be stuck or\ncan\u2019t go further, or we\u2019ll go s-sinking here, because the water 1s coming in fast. So this\ncommander, he send out two guys, two in different direction -- two in the one direction, and me\nand -- I went out with my friend Jonathan in one direction to look a way out. If you don\u2019t -- we\nalways had the river for the road, but we have to find a way to go beside the river to get out of\nthis area -- of this swamp -- of this swampy area or something. So I have -- I have been good at\nthat, I always have -- went out scouting, and I went out with my friend Jonathan and well\n[indecipherable] a couple hours looking around the area, how to get to -- out -- to make a way\nout in a dry way, not -- not into the water, and to -- so when the two other guys went a little bit\non the different direction, they should look in that direction. And I came back to reported this, we\nhave a good way out and that\u2019s all, we could simp -- not difficult to get out from here. Found still\na dry way -- dry land to go out. The other two guys took a little longer time to come back.\nCouldn\u2019t ra -- didn\u2019t [indecipherable] whether they got lost or something [indecipherable]. They\ngot lost, they got a little wandering around a little bit. They couldn\u2019t find it. They came back --\nthey couldn\u2019t find anything out. They couldn\u2019t find a way out. [indecipherable]. As we sitting\nand goo -- discussing the reports of these ex -- the evacuation of ours -- camp, two Gorkinsens\nappeared.",
        "Q: Who?",
        "A: Gorkin -- the two guys from gor --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- and says -- and they said, who the two guys who -- who -- yeah, they reported they met\nonce of the -- one guy that met one of the Gorkinsens. Okay, it wasn\u2019t so clear, but anyhow they\nsaid they met one guy. Okay, so these guys came and they said who are they. Who are they, they\nsay. So these two guys raise their hands. So they says come along to our commander, he wants to\nco -- ke -- ask you some questions because he wa -- you -- you came over and he wants to know\nwhy [indecipherable]. Oh, we says, you know why, because I -- we wanted have a way out and\nwe\u2019re looking a way out. Yeah, but to him -- you gotta explain to him, he wouldn\u2019t take -- come\nalong. As they walked out, two minutes later, two shots. So we -- this [indecipherable] our\ncommander said well, tomorrow morning we have to go. It\u2019s no -- it\u2019s no use to stay here, it\u2019s no\ngood. So we figure, we lost two guys again, and no reason. Well, we di -- we sort of made up\nthat -- that was the -- towards the evening, in the evening. That next morning we don\u2019t wait too\nlong, early in the morning we get out [indecipherable]. And as we packed our stuff in the\nmorning to get out, two guys are here [indecipherable] again from them, two other guys and they\nmake sure that we -- that we are moving out. They watched us going, so they went back to\n[indecipherable]. Going on, we had no place where to go, cause everything -- everywhere 1s\ndangerous. You know, sort of being pushed out to the edge, to the -- and we could not -- we find\na place we stayed at -- we stayed a couple days in a place, we says it isn\u2019t temporary -- it isn\u2019t\nsteady, but temporary, wait until we find the pet -- permanent place. But again they showed up,\nmore than one, more than two, the whole group. And -- and we sort of -- so we had -- we left\ntogether, we had -- each one had two hand grenades. We had the hand grenades, Russian hand\ngrenades. So you had them in the belts here, two hand grenades. So they figured we don\u2019t have\narms, they finish -- they finish off us. They -- they want to finish -- there was -- they took arms\nand they are alone, without arms. Well, they came in, they looked around, see we still have hand\ngrenades, I think they changed their mind. They just, oh, I want to see where you -- where you\nsettle -- where you settled. You know, made themself in good friends. Good friends. And they\nleft. They saw the -- saw the hand grenades, they didn\u2019t want to start a war. Anyhow, we went\nfurther, what you say, again [indecipherable] decide it\u2019s not the place to stay, because they will --\nthey'll be coming in here and there. If not today, they will come tomorrow again. So we moved\nfurther out.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We moved out to a -- almost to the end of the partisan zone, you know, it\u2019s almost -- very\nclose to the German patrols, okay? And over there we stayed a few -- couple days, and it ha --\nstill -- still I saw one or two of them coming -- coming nearby.",
        "Q: What, of the -- of this -- from this other group?",

I -- I went to my place where I worked, but a couple -- once okay,\ntwice I couldn\u2019t go farther. You know, at that time I said, I\u2019m not going. Every time I went to\nwork, the nat -- [indecipherable] Nazis came to Lodz. First of all they had their own.

Whenever I walked to the\nstreet, and tried to go to work, I was beaten [indecipherable] direct to work, they\u2019re being --\ntaking over offices and things [indecipherable] they want to clean up, so they grab people,\nJewish people to work, and they kept us for the whole day. We worked, we worked. So I got -- I\ncan\u2019t -- it does no use to go to work, cause you -- you don\u2019t go anything, you know, you just get\nyourself in trouble.

        "A: I couldn\u2019t do any -- I couldn\u2019t go to work because I was beaten up few times in go to work, so\nIs -- gave up to go to work, because -- my friend -- I have a -- I had a friend in the\nneighborhood, Tanchim, my friend.",
        "A: Tanchim, yes. And he wa -- he made it to Warsaw when -- where -- with -- with the crowd\nthat time.",
        "A: I-In the first time, but when Warsaw was holding on for two weeks and then they had to give\nup, so he came back to Lodz. He lived in our neighborhood and we talking -- we met -- you\nknow, we been going on and talk. The meanwhile we listen to the sort of kind of rumors, the\nnews. Not the rumors, but the news was that German -- that England and France, they are\nhelping Poland -- gonna help Poland.",
        "A: They gon -- they declared war [indecipherable] Germany there, because they were involved\nwith the previous agreement of friends -- friendship or something --",
        "A: -- and they had to come to help Poland. And then we became in a little bit hopeful, became\nthat this war isn\u2019t going to last long. But I -- I myself, you know, remember that Great Britain\nwas a big power.",
        "A: The -- the -- they -- the world big power, world power, and France 1s a big power, they too\nwill -- will attack them from the other side, from the -- the German will have to pull back or\nsomething, or otherwise they\u2019ll be in -- in trouble.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I thought.",
        "A: That\u2019s -- that\u2019s what I thought. Little we knew how -- how weak they were and how little they\ncould do.",
        "A: But we didn\u2019t know that they really not capable, I thought they were really strong. And we\nthought this cannot last long the war, cause with the help of England and o -- and France, they\nwill not go further. Where we were occupation took place, they occupied all Poland, and\n[indecipherable] is sort of coming with the idea we should go east because the war, she says a lot\nof people went to the east [indecipherable] Russia, took half of part of Poland, and so you\nfigured for the time being, til they -- til they have to pull out -- back, we will stay in -- and my\nmother there agreed with me, she says, go. Of course, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- there\u2019s no other\nway, there\u2019s no -- there\u2019s no solution here now. Pretty soon the [indecipherable] be such a help\nthat pretty soon the -- the situation will change, since France and England got the -- stepped into\nthe war.

        "A: What?",
        "A: Is what?",
        "A: Was it difficult? It was a little -- it -- I think it was a sort of general kind of -- a lot of people\nwere doing the same, so you -- you don\u2019t question it too much, and you figured this -- it\u2019s a\ntemporary thing, or something like that. Because I couldn\u2019t go to work --",
        "A: -- you couldn\u2019t help them, and they didn\u2019t work, because of the -- so, whatever it is, my sister\nand my mother stayed home. And I took off with Tanchim. I made the trip to go to the -- to the --\nto Malkinia. Malkinia was the last stop to the Russian border.",

        "A: Took them off, because Jews were not allowed to ride on the train and we couldn\u2019t get tickets,\nso could recognize us Jewish, so Tanchim\u2019s girlfriend, a girl was so different, she put on the\nscarf, and the thing what -- ah. She went over in the -- bought -- bought two tickets for us, and\nwe got a train to Warsaw. So the train was at night, th-the right -- you know, it was good because\nit was dark. Whenever the cont -- the German control came up on -- in the car, there were a lot of\npeople, we sort of pushed ourselves into the -- in the toilets while they were checking passports,\npa -- checking the I.D.\u2019s or something, the German patrols, we were in the -- in the toilets, a-and\nthen we came out.

So everybody has\nto leave and you couldn\u2019t leave because there was rows of S.S., both sides, and you cou -- they\nwouldn\u2019t let you go no place til the train pulls out, and they li-lined up everybody, all these\npeople in -- in -- in a line -- in lines, and marched away. And took us into a -- half a mile maybe,\nto this in -- their place -- their place, I don\u2019t know, a place, some place. It was a courtyard, big\nyard -- big courtyard and they put us in -- into this courtyard and S.S. guy -- S -- S.S. guys\naround us, you know, marching back and forth round the people and they all gave us orders. First\nthey said -- put up our hands in the air. We started in the morning, we stay there all day long. We\ndidn't know ma -- S.S. what\u2019s going on, what this -- kind of game this is. Towards the evening,\nabout -- I guess what [indecipherable] about four o\u2019clock 1n the evening, in -- towards the\nevening, I didn't even know when they start taking in people into the -- they\u2019re all around w-were\nbarracks, small barracks in the courtyard. And when I di -- all people who mar -- 1s -- were taken,\nsO now our time is to go into this separate room that -- that lead us -- they let us come to the end -\n- toward the end of this place, there\u2019s a bar -- a barrack, a wooden barrack and we going into this\n-- to go into this place. I don\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t know what -- what\u2019s for, everybody in. As we got\ninto this barrack, the hall -- the first hall is s -- low tables like that, a lot of tables, low like this,\nabout 10 people at each table, hours we have to stand around, and here cames the S.S. man with\nthe worker here, the man, he says, give up everything what you have, all the valuables and\nmoney. Put this on the table. He says, those who wouldn\u2019t, and you have hidden someplace,\nwe'll find it. You'll get shot. You\u2019ll be shot. And that\u2019s all. Well, there were some people there,\nthere were some people not [indecipherable] but most people, they put out everything, watches,\nwhat -- everything, jewelry, yeah, whatever. I didn\u2019t have mut -- money, I had one 50 zlotys my\nmother gave me, says, you need it, have something, it\u2019s not much of money. So I had sewed it in\n-- in a -- ina place in the coat --",

        "A: And I had a good shirt on, and another pair of pants, and another -- I been dressed up okay\n[indecipherable]. So he tried to -- he says to me, where did you hide the money? I says, I have no\nmoney. A watch? No, I don\u2019t wear watches. So he didn\u2019t think long, he looked at me, and he\ntook that cane and he gave me over -- hit me over twice, over my head, and blood started, came\ndown my face, and I was [indecipherable] and I stand s-stiff, and I don\u2019t move. I -- he says, now\nyou gonna give me the money, or gonna gi -- you gonna get the other -- you gonna get again the\nsame thing. I said, I don\u2019t have money.

At the way out on this -- there was a sole of -\n- sort of a walk, and the both sides were S.S. people with sticks, or pipes, or whatever --\nwhatever you had in the hand, and you have to go through and they hit you. So I didn\u2019t have\nnothing, I put my hands over my head, you know, you just protect -- I had already hit my -- over\nthe head, so I put -- protect my head and I s -- kept running and they been hitting both sides.\nFinally we got out. He let us go out, we came in into the no man\u2019s land, the no man\u2019s land\nbetween the Soviets and the German. There were so many people, masses of people, women and\nchildren. And the Russian guard wouldn\u2019t let through.",
        "A: No. One [indecipherable] us through and then people with kids come and beg, and n-nothing\nhelps, nobody went through, nobody can do, oh, wa -- they say we have to ask -- we have to\nformally ask for permission and we have to return then, if you get the permission, then you -- if\nyou get a permit, we\u2019ll let you through. So days -- there were 14 days on that cold winter\nNovember days, and snow and rain. So the only thing we had, some peddlers have bread to sell,\nso there was some bread and [indecipherable]. That\u2019s all we could get. And day by day we talked\nto [indecipherable]. On the 14\" day we saw some, you know, [indecipherable] in the morning. It\nwas a nice morning and the -- wasn\u2019t snowing and raining. We saw in the distance that some\npeople s -- go through, and they sort of disappear, they go into the woods. On the other side were\nwooded areas where the Russian guards were there. So I said, maybe that is the good way. So we\nthought this is probably smugglers, which they know and -- where to -- where there is a better\npassage.",
        "A: So we did follow them, we went through the border, and nothing, nobody check. I mean, no\nguards or nothing, you know, cause they knew whether it -- it was bribe somebody or something,\nI don\u2019t know, the smugglers maybe they have a way of bribing guards or whatever. We didn\u2019t\nsee any guards and we went toward the [indecipherable] and --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, the next town we know is Bialystok.",
        "A: The big town. But this was a small town we came over to, Bora, and in a few kilmatersa -- ki\n-- kilometers like that, there was a s-station, the train station, we took tr -- we took the train and\nwe came to Bialystok, which wasn\u2019t far.",
        "A: Bialystok was a town wall -- wall to wall refugees, people from the other side, every\n[indecipherable] full of people.",
        "A: Full. You couldn\u2019t go into a house if you -- if you wanted to go ask for a cu -- for a drink of --\ncup of water, or a glass of water, they wouldn\u2019t let you in the house. They put -- they put -- they\ngot water out to you, a glass of water, they gave you a glass of water and that\u2019s it. Or a cup of\nwater. This -- you know, they were afraid to let somebody in the house. They didn\u2019t know who it\nis, and we looked poor, something like that.",
        "A: They looked -- we looked, you know, bloody and -- and I-I mean there\u2019s muddy, and --\nmuddy and bloody and so everything [indecipherable]. So we walked around and we met some\npeople on the street, you know [indecipherable] some people we knew from Lodz, or -- nobody\nhad these -- a solution of what to do. They were registering -- the government registered people\nto go to coal mines to work. If you wor -- they say, if you register, we can, in a week or so, or\ntwo weeks, you might get the -- you go to work. Well, I really didn't want to go to the coal mines\n[indecipherable] then we didn\u2019t go too far, and now soon we gonna go back home, so we had --\ndon\u2019t want to go so far up in the [indecipherable] in the coal mines. And so there was no place,\nso we got -- the evening -- towards the evening, there was no place where to go to sleep. So I\nwent a shul.",
        "A: And we slept in the shul, on a bench. And the next day we go again out in the street,\n[indecipherable] again the people, they come in the evening -- we come in the evening to\n[indecipherable] where we slept, some like that, some other people came and they s -- they took\nour place. [indecipherable] it\u2019s not mine, you know, I couldn\u2019t, you know, how -- how could you\n-- so I had to walk out, we walked out in the streets, we start walking the street. We didn\u2019t have -\n- we have no place where to go. So we figured, well maybe we should take a tra -- the trains\nwere running, should take a train to the next small town, somewheres, whatever it is, another --\nanother 50 - 70 miles, maybe it\u2019s better there, there aren\u2019t that many people over there. Here,\neverybody sticks to one place. So we got to the station, to the train station, we get -- they wait --\nwaiting in line for tickets, and the man, a Jewish man [indecipherable] is behind us and he looks\nat us, says where you going? I said, we\u2019re going next town. What\u2019s the matter, he says, you got\nrelatives there? So why you -- what kind of che -- what you do? I said, we\u2019re tailors. We all of u\n-- we all of us were tailors, three of us. [indecipherable] me and Tanchim, we met a guy, one\nguy, another friend of ours on the border, we took him along, so we\u2019re three of us. Oh, tailors, he\nsays, I\u2019m going to a town where my daughter lives and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a better town than here, it\u2019s a\nlittle further, and you\u2019ll be better off. Y-You\u2019re tailors, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get work over there,\nyou'll get settled down, things like that. Well, it\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll go with -- we go with you. No, he\nsays, we'll go with you. Why yi -- how co -- we don\u2019t have where to sleep, so -- where to go,\nwhere to stay, with whom. So he says, for two guys, my daughter has a little sofa -- a sofa in the\nli -- P\u2019Il give you the sofa, and you\u2019ll [indecipherable] the third one, we\u2019ll find another place, so\nthe two of you -- well, it\u2019s a big -- a good deal, two of us [indecipherable]. So we all agreed. We\nwent with him and we landed in the town of Baranovich, and as he promised, we got to his\ndaughter at night, and -- and he told her that he brought two -- two guests, you gotta give them\nwhere to sleep. So he give us the soft and two of us slept the sofa and then my third one,\nTanchim had -- he went to a -- to the shul, the next -- was around the corner a shul, and he says,\nwell, plenty room in the shul says, if you want to [indecipherable] til we\u2019ll get -- til you find a\nplace. So we had the -- where to stay. In the morning we start out looking for work. You know,\nyou stay, we want to work, and do -- make it to -- live on something, you [indecipherable] you\nneed some money. You know, looked around, we walked around the city, and my one fire -- one\nfriend of mine found work, from the three of us, found a job, he was a ladies\u2019 tailor, he found a\ngood job -- a good job, a job [indecipherable]. We -- I think I walked out another wa -- we\nwalked in the street there together, a guy walked over to -- behind us, he was a -- and then he\ncame over, he says, I\u2019m a rabbi, what are you? You look -- you refugees? Yes. You -- what 1s it\nyou -- what are you doing for a living? Well, we\u2019re tailors. Oh, I need a coat, he says, I\u2019m going\naway, and -- he\u2019s going -- he\u2019s a Russian [indecipherable] from a little town. So [indecipherable]\nsays, I don\u2019t have a machine, I don\u2019t have -- oh, he says, my mother has a house. You stay in the\nhouse, and then you could do -- make it and she [indecipherable] a house, has a machine and\neverything. First of all, 1t was a good idea, the house. She got a house [indecipherable] got in the\nhouse because it was bitter cold, and we just turned around the streets and we were frozen ca --\nand now, even though we didn\u2019t -- 1t was very cold, and na -- just the feet are wet because of\nsnow. So we got and warm upped ourself a little bit. She sort of was really still [indecipherable |\nhis house was a little -- a little, small house, and it was warm, you know, little cats on the -- on\nthe chair, little cat was warming on the oven. It was such a peaceful house, and the -- this lady,\nold lady is putting in firewood and taking [indecipherable]. So I says, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s such a\ngood place, you know, you could stretch out the legs and things like that. And I start working on\nthe coat, without no knowledge what to do with it, but I start working, and I stretched the work it\nshould take a little longer. I\u2019d never made a coat, but I made it. My friend helped, and working\n[indecipherable] we made his coat.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: No, for he -- for this ra --",
        "A: For him.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s the first time I made a coat. I never, never made the coat, you know, from scratch,\nyou know, with a pattern with the -- with this cutting, you know. I made my own, so I had ac --\nmy brother was, you know, he knew how to make the pattern, so he cut.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t know until I sort of remember little bit just what they been talking. So I went out\nthe street and we just finished the coat just out in the street, you know, out in the street. We -- so\nwe always met in the -- there was a cafeteria, a big cafeteria, and all those refugees came in the\nca -- to the cafeteria. With a glass of tea, they could stay all day long. This is cold days, you can\u2019t\n-- you have no place where to go. So --\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Y-Y-Yeah, a glass of tea.",
        "A: Yeah. I been sitting there with tea. It\u2019s the only place we could go, we had no other friends.\nWe met a lot of people which we -- I mean not because I knew them before.",
        "A: We met people, talked, sit and talk. And we had just like sharing information. I heard about\nthe sending packages to -- to po -- to ghetto, wi -- and my friend Tanchim, we went out on the\nmarket and we -- and we -- and we co -- buy -- buy food. We made a package, we send back to\nghetto. We figured we just -- you know, we really weren\u2019t sure th -- if they will get it.",
        "A: But let\u2019s do it. S-Suppose maybe they get it, because people said the -- the -- the mail is being\ndelivered, or something. And we [indecipherable]",
        "A: What?",
        "A: In the ghetto?",
        "A: To my house I -- I used to live.",
        "A: Same place.",
        "A: The ghetto was in the area, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. The ghetto was -- now, we were in the ghetto befo -- before. Th -- in other words, it\u2019s a\nJewish area, and we lived there in that house before, so I figure I\u2019d send it to the same address.\nSure enough, after the war when my brother survived, he says they got this package --",
        "A: -- and it was food, which they said they -- was as -- that time I wasn\u2019t sure if they will receive\nthe package.",
        "A: But my brother told me that the package was received [indecipherable] I send the other one,\nbut it -- the other one 1 -- they didn\u2019t.",
        "A: So, but it wa-was later on, I guess they changed -- that must have changed the rules or\nwhatever. So in the beginning, the packages were delivered, or mail were delivered to the -- to\nthe ghetto.",
        "A: They never wrote back?",
        "A: No.",

        "A: -- in the ghetto?",
        "A: Not -- not the real news, just the ghetto, you know, this I could understand -- I could figure\nout that it\u2019s terrible, it\u2019s no good, this ghetto is -- they put so many people to ghetto.",
        "A: It\u2019s not a not -- it was over -- it\u2019s about over 200,000 people --",

        "A: And I wasn\u2019t sure if they got it, but something told me that maybe they -- they\u2019 ll get it, that --",
        "A: The Russians there -- well, it was sort of peaceful. The people who lived there before, they\nwere -- they le -- lived comfortably, and they might have to change, they maybe take --\nconfiscated big property, but --",
        "A: -- most of the people -- most of people have prepared. They had money put away, and they\nhad merchandise --",
        "A: -- food. So they lived comfortably. And the --",
        "A: No, no, you were -- you were treated okay.

        "A: -- [indecipherable] they did already clearing people, you know, a lot of people which they\nthought they\u2019re enemies, you know, like if they were involved -- if you work for the police, gov -\n- Polish government, those people, they t -- tried to arrest to send them away.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: -- they send the people to Siberia.",
        "A: Well, okay, I was okay, but I didn\u2019t have -- I had -- I just thinking about my mother and sister\nhome. I wasn\u2019t easy --",
        "A: -- it wasn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t be peaceful. Had my -- my -- my thoughts, my -- were of -- from --\nfrom my -- from home.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what I thought, to go back, because soon they were came -- there were so\nmany people, and the government could not help themself, you know, how to control these mass\nof people.",
        "A: Refugees. So they start to have -- make him citizenship. Alre -- a passport. If you get a\npassport -- you know, every citizen over there got a passport.",
        "A: If you get a passport, you\u2019re citizen, and therefore you -- you -- you can go to work, or you\ncan -- you can be treated -- I mean, treated as a citizen, you don\u2019t have to -- people live without -\n- oh, they have to co -- have -- they had to have control of everybody, but there was loose people,\nthey\u2019re not registered no place, they don\u2019t have --",
        "A: -- they -- they don\u2019t -- they don\u2019t know who 1s here, who is there, so they declared the citiz --\nif they wa -- if they -- to next -- to the summer -- well, after six months or something -- three\nmonths, they ask all the people, the refugees to come and get a s -- a pass -- a citizenship. Well,\nwe got to the office, everyone was called in individually to this offi -- to the office, and declared\nwhat you goin -- what you expect to be, you know, you gonna get a citizen, you gonna become\ncitizen, and you can go to work, you can work or we will get you work, we\u2019ll -- you wanted the\ngovernment\u2019s protection. And so a lot of people came with -- by themselves, without wife, they\nleft the wife and kids over in -- back home. Mothers [indecipherable] mother, you see. So when\nthey came out from the sa -- ask them what they ask you questions, you said th -- the guy is, I ask\nhim, I said -- they ask me to -- to become citizen, so if you -- and gave me the -- the rules, if\nyou're citizens -- if you\u2019re a citizen -- in other words, you can\u2019t go back to Poland, you cannot\nbring your family, a lot of restrictions. Now, there was one thing, you can\u2019t go back and you\ncan\u2019t bring your family. So a lot of the people didn\u2019t accept that and they came out and they says,\nwell I wouldn\u2019t leave my wife and kids home, and I will say hey, I don\u2019t want to stay here. So a-\nat the end, if you don\u2019t accept the citizenship, you got to give them in -- a place where you want\nto go, sort of like a nice [indecipherable] want to go to America, you want to go to -- to -- well,\nmaybe we want to see -- they put it on, but it doesn\u2019t matter --",
        "A: They put it on on the paper.",
        "A: But they -- but these people wh-who didn\u2019t want to take citizenship, I -- my friends, the two\nfriends, took the citizenship.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: And first of all I didn\u2019t because I had been thinking home and I want to go back home. And I\nwas trying to go back home and the borders, they were really tight. It was hard to get through. So\nI came back and I -- I mean t -- I went to the border [indecipherable] and I couldn\u2019t get through.\nSo I came back and -- and when I asked for citizenship, I didn\u2019t take the ci -- I didn\u2019t take the\ncitizenship. And after some times -- after a few weeks, a week or so, they too -- they round up all\nthe people that didn\u2019t take citizenship, they put them in the trains -- in the freight trains is -- to go\nto send them away.",
        "A: Out into Siberia or something --",

        "A: So -- and they took everybody and they put them on a train, I figured, so if they didn\u2019t take\nme now, and I have no passport, we were again -- again a -- again ena -- illegal or something.",
        "A: So Lavoid to go out, as I don\u2019t wanted to be arrested. If you have -- if you check -- if you --\nthey check you and they -- you have no passport, and -- so after the transports went away -- went\neast, they -- all the trains and in two days later, they s -- gave a chance, a second chance, those\nwho didn\u2019t get the passport who missed the train, in other words, you can get now the\ncitizenship, the passports. Well, then I had no choice and I took the pas -- took a passport, and\nbecame a citizen. So, whatever.",
        "A: Whatever it is.",
        "A: A Russian citizen. And well, we\u2019ll see what\u2019s going on and everybody\u2019s not -- I\u2019m not the\nonly one, there\u2019s a lot of people, there are a lot of people were -- were -- I had no choice.",

And my tal -- friend Tanchim is running to the railroad station, he says, I\u2019m going. And I\nwas going out in the streets to find out some other people, what to do. Are they going really to\nthe evacuate? Are they going to the railroad station to get a train to go back east? So we met\nsome people, refugees coming from the border.

We rushed home, back to Baranovich. Trains were loaded already, people\nwere running from all over, from the countryside to the ci -- to the town. Baranovich was the\nnearest town, which we lived, so we went back. Coming back was really -- the town -- the\nsituation of early war time. [indecipherable] were bombing, and ai-air attacks and things like\nthat. You have the dir -- we dug a shelter in the backyard. We went to the shelters when the fliers\ncame. And we listened to the radio -- to the radio, official radio. They had it placed all over in\nthe places, in the public places where we could hear the news. So they really sa -- misinformed\nus, you know, the agency, the Soviet agency, they had said that they are be -- beating back the\nenemy, and that will -- it\u2019s -- wasn\u2019t true, 1t was -- they were right here, next door, and then\nprobably we wouldn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t rush to evacuate, to go -- to run away.

They want\ndollars, they want pounds, all foreign currencies. And -- and this had to be delivered in --\nmeanwhile, they start already asking for workers -- workers. So the Judenrat was appointed\n[indecipherable] they needed workers for some project, we didn\u2019t know what. So we were not\nthe ci-citizen, you know, I mean, it\u2019s not a citizen from Baranovich, you know, we -- we were\nrefugees, so we were the first ones to go.

And it was the\nPolish -- old Polish airport, but the -- since the Air Force is -- is big, that they need more s --\nmore runways and more things like that. So they took 300 people from us, from -- from Jewish --\nfrom the ghetto, which was not the ghetto yet, but [indecipherable] Jewish people already had to\nsupply workers before the ghetto started. And they had 300 non-Jewish people working. So there\nwas about 600 people working at this airfield to rebuild -- to extend the airfor -- rebuild the airfor\n-- the air force -- the airfield.

So what is there -- we can\u2019t be -- we can\u2019t avoid that, we going\nto have to -- sooner or later we figured we\u2019ll have to go -- we\u2019ll do something. Anyhow, we\ncouldn\u2019t say no. As we worked -- as I worked ever d -- at this job [indecipherable] time, I really\ngot sick from that. So at -- one morning the foreman, you know, we had this guy, Jewish guy was\nthe foreman from 300 people. In the morning he divided people different -- different play -- jobs.\nThere were electricians, there were carpenters, you know. So one day he ask for a tailor, who 1s a\ntailor.

So I said -- then I start\nworking as a tailor and as soon they open -- they gave me a room and a machine, and\n[indecipherable] set up a tailor room where I could work.

So this was the daily --\ndaily things what happened, and we thought of escaping. We -- some people tried to escape, I\ndon\u2019t know if they made it. They also didn\u2019t have any arms.

They want 4,000 people. And Isikson was [indecipherable] and he -- he says, you ask me\nfor gold, money, I give you. But ma -- people and their kids, you have to come and get yourself.",
        "A: Yeah. So at that time they figured they have to do it, you know, and they gonna do it by\nthemselves. So the ghetto was already [indecipherable] the SS, and things like that. They took\nout people -- we were at the -- assembled outside in the place on the -- outside the ghetto, the\nworking people.",
        "A: So our -- our -- our chef -- the head, took out his pe -- a lot of people, German and officers\nwho had the people working for them came and took their people out of work. So those who\nworked for the German [indecipherable] organizations, German [indecipherable] could go to\nwork.",
        "A: They were.",
        "A: So we go to work, we didn\u2019t know if -- what is going to happen now. They -- they were\nprotected, so there\u2019s -- they wanted to keep the workers still working, while they take -- and they\nwant to take the kids and the elderly, a-and to get 4,000 in the first place, for them. So is --\nIsikson refused, s-so they let them go home, and we, sort of after we heard what\u2019s going on, we\nstayed in the place, we didn't go ho -- go to work -- go to -- home after work --",
        "A: -- the same day. We didn\u2019t go home. And we did hide in our -- and rarely you find a place to\nhide, until we\u2019ll -- the things what we heard what\u2019s going on [indecipherable] in the ghetto. So --\nand towards the evening, we sort of were told to go to get ready to go home, to go to the ghetto.\nSo we were about 73 people, those who remained hiding inside, they didn\u2019t want -- want to go\n[indecipherable] and we didn\u2019t go before, but now they want to wait, they said they -- they have\nto go to the ghetto, you had to go home. And here we still heard the news from -- and we heard\nthe guns -- machine guns, that they\u2019re still killing people. So there was question, you know, was\nlike going to a ghetto, you going right into -- to the open -- to this slaughter. So the people were\nafraid to go, but they had to -- they had to sort of make sure to -- to stay. If they could stay, they\nwould say if they could stay here in the -- in the place of work another night, would be good. So\none lady came into my tailoring room with a gold watch and she put the watch down and said --\nshe told me, go in and talk to the -- our head. Rudel is the head of the -- our officers, if -- to bribe\nhim, he should let us stay one night more. If they a -- the slaughter will go by. So I said -- looked\nat her, I said, you -- you know, you crazy, because I -- this man never came into me, I\n[indecipherable] he doesn\u2019t know me, cause the others -- officers work -- came in for work, he\nnever came in to work -- for work. And so is -- but til -- she left the watch, she walked out, you\ndo it. I says, that\u2019s the only way out -- she said, whether I could -- could do it, and think to do it.\nAnd I was sitting 1n [indecipherable] says, she is crazy. I mean, he never -- he never came -- he\nnever know me -- he never came to me, and I can-cannot go bribing somebody like that, you\nknow, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s ridiculous. Well, waiting, waiting, waiting, and there\u2019s no other solution, so the\npe -- so people says, well, what can you -- what would you do? What can you do? Well, I said,\n[ll -- have no choice and I have to go, whatever is -- if -- if I wouldn\u2019t do that, you say, oh, if\nyou would have gone, you have -- do -- did something, it -- it would have -- 1t would have been\nsomething. Now, we are really without any he -- without any help. So I took this watch and I\nwalked over, this is one barrack where the officers lived, and I have that [indecipherable]\neverything over there in one bag. I walked over and I -- I la -- never was in this office, never\nwent -- I knew more or less where the doors -- it\u2019s right the first door. So I knocked the door, and\nhe says, enter [indecipherable]. So I walked in and Is -- was -- had to stand on the rear door, I\ndidn\u2019t move. I just walked in, I didn\u2019t move, because his -- this room, the decorations around\ngive you a Sc -- give you such a scare, all this Hackenkreuz 1s -- banners hanging and the\n[indecipherable], the Hitler and Goerings and everything all around. Is -- is just like Goering or\nsomething, or some other officer in his office in -- in a -- in the back of the room, and in a -- ina\nde -- on the desk. And I says -- so -- so he says, well, well, was -- what do I want -- what do you\nwant? Say, I want to talk to you. So he -- he sits in a [indecipherable] so come here. I walk over\nand I didn\u2019t ask anything, I took out the watch and put on the table. He says -- I says, look, this is\nwhat we have, what one of the ladies have and she doesn\u2019t need it, because if we go home the\nghetto we gonna be killed anyhow, you might use it, s -- give it -- send it to you. One of your\nfamily, I don\u2019t know whether he was married or not, never knew. He says to me in a quiet way,\nhe says take it back, I don\u2019t want it, I don\u2019t need it. [indecipherable] and I le -- I look at him and I\nwas -- I don\u2019t see the same person. He -- he asks me to sit down, and you know what -- what\nhappen. And I sit down, I says, take the watch. Forget it, he says, take it back, and nothing going\nto happen to you. It\u2019s over. In other words, this load is over. And nothing is going to happen to\nyou, nothing is going to happen. I said, well I still hear the guns. He says, I -- I have or -- I have\ninformation, he says. So I walk out and -- with this news, and I told the guys waiting for me, and\nI told them that we could go home and nothing is going to happen, it\u2019s over. Meanwhile, we still\nheard the guns, we still heard the machine guns go. And time goes shorter and we -- we have to\ngo soon, at six o\u2019clock we going home. So they said to me, look, we going to go a column with\npeople, with 70 people. They don\u2019t know who we are or what ev -- what kind of [indecipherable]\nwe have. See -- do something, tal-talk to him, see if maybe he\u2019Il send somebody to explain to the\nguards, you know. Well, I said, maybe they\u2019re right, but since I saw that he is -- didn\u2019t -- he -- he\nnot, you know, the same guy is over there. So I went over and I -- again, I says that the people\nare afraid to go because they don\u2019t know where they will -- if they know what we are, who we\nare or something like that. And I said, if you would have [indecipherable] I mean, I thought -- as\nI thought -- if you would go with us to lu -- I mean, to the gate and te -- explain who we are. So\nhe was thinking a few minutes. Okay, I'll go. So he got into his car and he drove ahead and we\nmarched with 12 guards, of Air Force guards to the ghetto. And it was not complete over, but it\nwas over. At that moment, when we came to the gates, we saw Mr. Isikson was led out by SS.\nTwo guys took him and his assistant to their car and put them away -- took him away, for good.\nSo that\u2019s why, he did -- he didn\u2019t obey the orders. He didn\u2019t give them the 4,000 people. He\nmade [indecipherable] -- so that\u2019s what it is. I mean, they -- they ne -- appointed another guy for\nJudenrat, for -- they appointed another guy.",
        "A: I been -- we been waiting in -- in front of the ghet -- gate, to be -- to --",
        "A: -- to go back in.",
        "A: But they weren't that finished, they didn\u2019t clean up -- they didn\u2019t -- til they put a -- bore out\nthe juden -- the -- Mr. Isikson, and then they opened the gates and -- to get -- to let in us, our\npeople. My pe -- my group of people.",
        "A: When I came in the ghetto --",
        "A: -- the guy who was the Judenrat man, told us.",
        "A: [indecipherable] a part of the Judenrat, not the -- nobody was a -- but he pol -- told us -- he\ntold us he was -- around the ghetto he was a member of the Judenrat and he was supposed to be -\n- to accompany the SS when they lo -- loaded the people on trucks, out to the -- to the shooting\nplace. But before, when I left him since -- first time, when I went out his door, another officer\nwhich used to come into me with a lot of work [indecipherable] well, no f -- more kind of -- he\nobviously used to talk, have a d -- you know, he -- he used to come in more often, and he\n[indecipherable] with me. And he says -- he told me where I work -- where I been working, you\nknow, like a front yard [indecipherable] 150 yards, and he start -- he\u2019s talking to me in working,\nthat this morning, he says, they took us, all the officers, not only us, but officers in the whole\ntown who have workers -- officer who work here, and the -- for the germ -- German officers,\nthey took him -- they took them to show the slaughter [indecipherable]. They -- they -- the way\nthey -- what they -- what they do, they want to show off how they kill the people, and he says --\nMr. Lindow, Mr. Lindow says unthinkable, unbelievable, he says. What they did, it\u2019s\nunbelievable, unthinkable. How\u2019d they do it? He probably didn\u2019t want to go too long with --\nwalk along outside with me, but this few steps he did it, he told me what happened. In other\nwords they all -- and he -- and he [indecipherable] was along with them. And that probably gave\nhim a shock, and he changed. He changed to a degree that was such the completely different. He\nwas really -- he was really -- he didn\u2019t know what to do. He was -- you know, I couldn\u2019t\nrecognize him. You know, he walked around, he didn\u2019t say a word, he didn\u2019t say to u -- to u -- to\nthe others. S-So that was -- his story was -- didn\u2019t end yet because soon after, we -- groups -- we\nhad a resistance group in the ghetto, and we escaped. And with some arms left, we had a nice\nbunker. I build a bunker which is we had some arms, the resistance had some arms, and we sort\nof prepared for resistance. And since they took us out from the ghetto [indecipherable] resistance\nwasn\u2019t working.",
        "A: It couldn\u2019t happen. But when we came back, some of my arms, my bunker wasn\u2019t dis --\nwasn\u2019t discovered. I mean, they found a lot of bunkers and they dis -- confiscated a lot of arms,\nwhich we prepared for the resistance.",
        "A: Well, we had y -- you know, y -- our people worked to collect the arms from the Russian\nmilitary. When they gave up, they left in the woods and the fields, so they had to collect these, so\nthe people from the ghetto worked this -- with this comp -- with this group to bring the arms, so\nthey smuggled in these arms, from rifles to grenades, you know, as much as they could. So I had\nthe -- my -- my -- my friend Tanchim was -- was the head from my group, we had five in a group\nprepared. And our -- we -- since we had a rifle and grenades in our -- in our bunker, and our\nbunker was not found. So, in other words, we planned an escape and it\u2019s the only arms we had,\nthe others were confiscated. And we prepared an escape. We didn\u2019t know which way, whether\nthrough the ghetto, cut the g -- cut the barbed wires, or from the place we work, from the airfield\n-- airfield. It took us time to get this -- smuggle the arm -- we decided to escape from the airport,\nand so our people were the electricians. Our people who were from our resistance group, they\nworked -- they were electricians and they worked out in the airfield, further out, and over there at\nthe airfield we walked around free. We didn\u2019t -- even though we had patches and things like that,\nnobody bothered us.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: No, no, they were --",
        "A: The same airfield, but they were in -- into the airfield that they are almost like further out in\nthe [indecipherable] they worked th -- the electrician --",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] installations, so they worked out further, so we -- they explained that\nthere\u2019s some bushes we could stay there all day long, go to work and from work, the little -- this\n-- you know, single people could go there to the point where we ha -- go together and in the\nevening, we\u2019ll escape with the whole group.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: There were what?",
        "A: There were the other two, yeah.",
        "A: Two",
        "A: There were, in general, two resistance groups, separate, you know, but they -- different plans,\nwe had different plans. But at this point the ghetto was already divided again, smaller and\n[indecipherable] and there -- and there was a lot of people --",
        "A: You know [indecipherable] cause the resistance lost a lot of people, even those -- our own\npeople. So the other escape was planned for my group, plans with our arms [indecipherable] in\nour basement [indecipherable] but still it was on the other side, the ghetto was cut off shorter.\nYou know, they -- there were less people, they cut -- they cut the ghetto shorter.",
        "A: So even though there were -- our arms were in the other side, behind barbed wire, but we\nmanaged to go through [indecipherable] guys -- the guys went over at night [indecipherable] get\ninto -- brought into the new ghetto, our arms --",
        "A: Cut the wires.",
        "A: Cut the wires, and we watched the guards. The guards were going back and forth.",
        "A: And we want to get these arm back to the place where worked at the airport -- at the airfield.\nFrom there we planned to escape. As we --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Different?",
        "A: What made join the resistance is simply because you cannot go to the slaughter like sheeps.",
        "A: Wanted [inaudible], and of course there was no, assurance, you know. Sure, it\u2019s a lost battle,\nbut you want to have a resistance, as much as we could do.",
        "A: As much as we could do. And we [indecipherable] arms, their arms are better, but we knew\nit\u2019s not the same -- it\u2019s not the same as -- it\u2019s not a even struggle. But we got to do something.\nBut later on, when it turned out that we were left with a few arms only, and the -- and most of the\nresistant people were killed in -- in the ghetto, so [indecipherable] there were left, we were 24\npeople together, we made the escape.",
        "A: When the escape?",
        "A: About, it was October, something like that.",
        "A: Oh, cold, really [indecipherable] was sep -- August, it is the end of September, octo --\nsomething like that. Preparation, you know, it was kind of -- til we moved back the arms to the --\nyou know, we got -- you have to esca -- the escape has to be -- if you\u2019re not armed you cannot\nescape. I mean, you can escape --",
        "A: -- but to make sure, it\u2019s better -- 1t\u2019s assurance, if you have something, it feels -- you feel\nstronger. I know it --",
        "A: -- I know when [indecipherable] and we had the hand grenades for the rest of the people, so\nwe hand out just the one hand grenade, makes you so strong that you feel -- you walk differently,\nyou have, you know, a little more courage, you -- so you -- at least you have some ar -- some --\nsome resistance. And we [indecipherable] we made it, we made the escape. Later on we sh -- we\ngot out the arms outside to the airfield over there and we -- the arms were hidden in the bushes\nand then we made the escape. We made the group together, little by little --",
        "A: -- single -- single people.",
        "A: Single few people just [indecipherable] not going one group, but just we knew that we\u2019re in\nthe group together, little by little and we -- we grouped together at [indecipherable] you know,\nit\u2019s [indecipherable] now. You know it\u2019s a little -- in September -- is it -- was it October, or that\u2019s\n-- or something like that, something like -- 1t was -- the summer was over. And -- and days are --\nand people -- what the guys who worked there, and they came later, told us what -- when we\nwere escaped and then the foreman is counting us, that -- and he reported to -- to the Rudel that\n24 people missing. He says they escaped. So -- so he -- s -- that\u2019s what they told us, that Rudel\nsaid, in -- in German, yeah, when they\u2019Il -- Wenn sie rieten Kennen losen die Laufen. That\u2019s the\n-- when -- when they can save themselves, let them -- let them run. So he was the -- he became a\ndifferent man and he chose later, if you want to finish his story, his story didn\u2019t end yet, cause\nwhen we entered -- when we came to the parti -- partisan -- we met partisans, Russian partisans,\nthey sort of were very anti-Semitic, but they [indecipherable] you -- you have to -- you have no\narms, you know, you\u2019re not armed. We had our -- the rifles were -- he said, is not -- not enough.\nYou cannot fight, he says, with this, you gotta get arms. So you gotta send out here -- do\nsomething, you know, he was really pushing us to -- to some point that you couldn't say no, was\n-- so he says, you gotta send out people to get arms, or to do some sabotage work. You couldn\u2019t\ndo it if the fe -- you\u2019re not armed you can\u2019t anything, but anyhow, we -- the -- our leaders did\nsend out --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: That was the first group. There was another --",
        "A: That\u2019s -- that -- it\u2019s interesting, you know, and it\u2019s true, you know, you\u2019re a -- good question,\nbecause we didn\u2019t know, we weren't -- we never -- we didn\u2019t grow up over there, we were mostly\nmore from -- most of the group probably people from -- from Poland --",
        "A: -- on the other side, but some people promise they know the law, they know the area, but it\ndidn\u2019t work -- it didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know if they told the truth. They just probably want to go to ca -\n- take part in the escape and they promised they know. Is -- you know, that happened a lot of\nthings which are not expected, you know.",
        "A: But we have inside pe -- we had now a group people, intelligent and people that -- we had sa -\n- little map -- they had some o -- little map, they -- they could [indecipherable]. Well, this guy\nMuszinski, he was a Polish -- from Poland, also, from Czestochowa, and he -- he was electrician,\ngood elect -- and he was also very intelligent. He sort of | -- looked at the map, little map and he\ncould -- could see how to get out, and he was y -- a little work here, he could see the -- there was\na railroad, small rail tracks like they been carrying woods from the woods -- from the woods, all\nwood from the woods [indecipherable] get to this tracks, will be on the right track, in other, will\ngo through -- the track goes through the woods. He figured out this here. So that was the -- that\nwas the real intelligent judgment in the -- in this case.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: Accidentally.",
        "A: Knew -- we knew where -- we knew as we -- we -- we grew closer, we -- as we came closer to\nthe, you know, wooded areas, peasants gi -- you know, the peasants yi -- more or less gave us\ndirections wi -- where the -- which other side -- see, the other side the river. See, if you go the\nother side the river, you find them.",
        "A: And it\u2019s true. It was -- it was the river Sharra, and if you go the other side the river, we found\nthem.",

        "A: What?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t cold yet, no, it wasn\u2019t cold yet. It was very chi-chilly sometimes at night, but it\nwasn\u2019t cold yet. It wasn\u2019t --",

        "A: -- yeah, for the girls to smuggle ah -- into the ghetto. And --",
        "A: -- it was something like we have something to do, you know, we had some resistance with a --\nwhatever we could.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Oh sure, they knew we came together. There was one Ukraine guy who was -- he was sort of\nthe head of -- not the head, but he was the s -- spoke to us in a manner like, in other words, why\ndid you come here? You gave the gold to -- to the Germans. In other -- you gave the -- you gave\nth -- you gave the gold to the Germans, and you came here, in other words, empty handed. You\ncame here --",
        "A: -- you came here what, to save your life, he said. Well -- and -- but, he says, well you have to\nshow that you really want to fight the -- back. Fight the [indecipherable]. You have no arms, so\nyou have to go and get arms, and you get whatever you can sabotage, whatever you can do. So\nma -- well, our guys went to start to do something, to think about something. So we send out four\ndifferent -- four different groups to show -- to go, as they say -- as they have demanded, they\nhave demanded to go out to get arms, or to do sabotage. So one guy from our group -- from --\nwho worked at the electricians, he said he\u2019ll go back to the transformers, he\u2019Il destroy the\ntransformers in the airport. It\u2019s a big sabotage [indecipherable] and all the -- to -- young kids,\nthey said they worked with -- for a ye -- they worked for police, they worked, you know, from\nthe ghetto they went out to work to the police, railroad police, those who carried the prisoners\nand thing, or my people are [indecipherable] to the camps, or those prison -- those have a police\nforce, they have a police force and they worked for them. So they -- so they go and see if they\ncould get some arms over there. And the third one -- the third group 1s just to get int -- the\ninformation to go near the railroad, to see the -- bring the information, the movement, what kind\nof -- what kind of movement it is, what cargo, military or some that. So there were fo -- and then\nthere\u2019s another group which just simply -- I don\u2019t know whether you figure to go get some arms.\nAnd those four -- four guys, you know, they went out, they didn\u2019t have arms with them. They\nweren't armed, but they went to look for arms, which was really --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: In their s -- no, alone, they --",
        "A: -- some of them are alone, some of them with small group.",

        "A: -- they were going. I [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t go there. But I was [indecipherable] you know,\nto the other one.",
        "A: So the others has way -- they have -- they have some sort of place where they could find it,\nmaybe they had in the mind somewheres to go where they could find some arms. And those fo-\nfour guys, those four guys were killed right away, out -- when they stepped -- you know, the first\n-- the first -- they -- the German patrol right away killed them as soon they went out on the other\nside, the outside of the camps, you know, they -- you know, an hour later, something like that.\nThese four gu -- and the other guy, they went wi -- to -- went to blow up the transformers, they\nwent -- came -- went back to the pu -- in other words, the place where we were and he was\nspotted -- he was mix -- miggling -- mixing with jig -- the guy still which working there, he was\nplay like one of them, and then stay overnight and do his job. While he was hanging around\nthere, a Polish guy knew his -- that he escaped in the partisans [indecipherable] worked with the\nJewish guys and they were talking about he -- that Moishe Polak 1s -- is in the partisans. And\nthen he sees him here. He sur -- he informed the SS. And they -- they came and picked him up\nand brought him for interrogation and one SS officer was sitting next [indecipherable] his table,\nand nic -- is sort of asking questions. And he had a hand grenade with for -- from our group, the\nguy, he pulled out the hand grenade. So the officer saw the hand grenade, he went out the room.\nAnd he wants to blow himself up --",
        "A: -- with the hand grenade, but the hand grenade didn\u2019t go off. So he opened the window, and\njust -- he jumped out and killed himself jumping out the window.",
        "A: Yeah. Boys cry [indecipherable] cry. All the others have also su -- they all succeeded, but the\nfour guys who were killed the first were people who worked in our place.",
        "A: And they, when they were killed, they had their documents on them, the -- the -- their I.D.\u2019s.\nSo they knew where they worked. So went back and they had this, the SS went back to the work\n-- to the place where they worked, and tried to find -- to find out how come they don\u2019t know --\nthey didn\u2019t know that they escaped. Said, when did they escape? So the -- they -- they went to\nthe far [indecipherable] it\u2019s an office where they keep their registers and the files from all the\nworkers. And they were looking for the files for these guys, and they couldn\u2019t find them. So they\nask these clerks, is there missing files? Well, he -- he said that Rudel, man was here, he took out\nthe files, say you don\u2019t know, you know, for what reason they too -- took out. He took out and\ndestroyed them, like we never existed.",
        "A: So that was -- he didn\u2019t call -- when we escaped he didn\u2019t alarm the SS, that\u2019s one thing. He\ndidn\u2019t go to chase us [indecipherable] us -- he was it -- and so, in other words, and then he\nfigured that he\u2019Il take out the -- the files, nobody will look in -- will -- nobody will know that we\nescaped. So meanwhile the SS arrested Rudel and as they -- later on the guys came, they came\nafter us, some of them managed to escape, the last -- the last -- the last -- from our -- from\n[indecipherable] we were -- told us about that, how he was arrested and court-martialed. So I felt\nI -- I felt that he [indecipherable] was talking to him that he -- he went through a tremendous\nchange, being that he was a devoted Nazi and could not -- he would not expect that kind of scene\nwhich is -- you know, it could break down a lot of people, but he broke down even though he\u2019s a\n-- he was a devoted Nazi.",
        "A: It broke him down. And you know ho mak -- how much -- how strong they are what it is and\nyou know, but you never know is a [indecipherable] a man 1s just a human being\n[indecipherable] could break down anybody. So that\u2019s what the ir -- we heard of these guys who\ncame later, what he -- what happened to him, and he -- and he was court-martialed and\npresumably -- I don\u2019t know what -- which way, or -- it\u2019s hard to find them. I then -- go to find --",
        "A: What?",
        "A: I don\u2019t exactly know, but I 1 --",
        "A: R-u -- R-u-d -- R-u-d-e-l",
        "A: And the -- this -- we had still a struggle and -- and the others over the -- cause this group was\nvery anti-Semitic, with -- the ones that were -- gave us orders to go. We had such a -- really, we\nlost so many people right away, the first fr -- right in the first step, lost two -- two of the good\npeople. Two of this and the three [indecipherable]. And -- and the main thing 1s what -- is where\nthey were not instructed how t-to do it, how to go. They were strange, you know, and they -- out\nfrom the woods, they know -- they didn\u2019t know if you can go by a daytime or at night. You\nknow, some of them go dangerous places, you don\u2019t go in broad daylight, you -- you wait until --\ntil it\u2019s getting dark, or complete night. They were not giving instructions at all, they just send\nthem out to be killed or something like that.",
        "A: Fa -- we didn\u2019t stay long with them, because they were really very -- like whole group were\nreally -- like how could I say, they -- they told us -- they ma -- called them ex-convicts. I mean,\nyou know, like --",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] Russian -- them Russian -- the Russians, they open the jails you know,\nthe [indecipherable] they were vicious guys, killers. They could kill [indecipherable] even, very\neasy, and --",
        "A: What?",
        "A: How they treat the women?",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t bother our women, but they had their own.",
        "A: Yeah, they had their own women. Every [indecipherable] is a different -- different way of --\nbut, they were horrible. They were horrible and their behavior wasn\u2019t good, and their treatment.\nThey really let [indecipherable] we could not stay there longer, but was -- they were robbing us,\nand they robbed our arms, and the shoes, some good shoes they took off. People came from the\nghetto still when the ghetto was there and they had something, some valuables, s-something, they\nrobbed them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, they weren\u2019t afraid. They always took shoes off, they [indecipherable] watches\n[indecipherable] the handgun and som -- so they took away. You see, the handgun is only for\nofficers. You don\u2019t have to --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, only for officers. That\u2019s the excuse.",
        "A: [indecipherable] explain, why did you -- why did you take -- you know. Oh that -- that -- this\n-- a handgun is only for officers here.",
        "A: Yeah, the -- we have a leader what -- he couldn\u2019t do much. [indecipherable] have a leaders,\nyou have two leaders, you have a co -- a few guys which are sort of in the leadership sure. Well,\nthey were still in the -- in the ghetto, there were leaders, so they -- some of them were still\nleaders in the group.",
        "A: To leave to go out?",
        "A: Oh, to go another group later on?",
        "A: Well, course it was impossible to stay there.",
        "A: So you had to find a -- we found out that there -- another group is coming to this area, and --\nand it\u2019s -- it is an entire different area. They came from -- from a Slonim are -- area that\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nanother region where the pe -- the German had big, big raids there. A division with mi -- the\narmy diverted to clean -- to -- to clean out their -- their trads -- their groups. They were a big\nunit, you know, a big movement --",
        "A: -- of different groups, lot of groups. So they moved towards us, they were going to go further\ne -- further east. So some of the groups also split up. There was a -- a Jewish group, what with a\nRussian com -- commander, so we figured well maybe it\u2019s a good -- so we got the idea to go. We\nhave to leave anyhow, this area is -- couldn\u2019t stay longer.",
        "A: And so we -- we managed to merge with them. And --",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: Is what?",
        "A: Through Slonim, yeah the guys -- the guys from Slonim, and they came to our area, and of\ncourse they were in --",

        "A: -- not yet.",
        "A: It is not Orlovsky yet. This is a group, a -- a group which splinter also, they -- they were a big\nbrigades and they broke up in the smaller groups because they been running from -- they been\ngoing east, so they couldn\u2019t go in one big brigade, there were a few hundred people. So they\nbroke up these small groups, and in this one was a Jewish group and we -- we -- some of them\ngot together, and we merged with them.",
        "A: They had a leader, they have a -- they had a Russian leader.",
        "A: Yeah. They had a Russian leader, and they figured that was better. And we told the Russian\nleader, you know, where we were there, that the -- these guys before, they -- they killing the --\nmany people come from ghetto, they been killed there -- a lot of people have been killed.",
        "A: And he says why don\u2019t you meet with this [indecipherable] we told him that you -- you\ncommanding us, why don\u2019t you meet with these guys, the Gorkinsens and tell them why the --\nand ask them why did they kill people when they come from the ghetto? So he met with this\ncommander there, Tsygankov and he says, why do you kill th -- all Jewish people, they come\nfrom the ghetto. So he says, don\u2019t worry, 1f Pll kill a hundred -- a hundred Jews, and one of --\nand one would have been a spy, I would be f -- I would be justified. That\u2019s a -- that\u2019s the answer",
        "A: -- Pll be justified, you know, that --",
        "A: -- that -- that is really a -- you know, a situation [indecipherable] complain if you have no --\nnobody to complain.",
        "A: Yeah, they give you such answers, so much reason now [indecipherable] he brings you a -- a -\n-a good reason, kill a spy. But it\u2019s not a spy and not the -- not the spy, they just wants to kill the\nJews --",
        "A: -- the Jewish -- yeah.",
        "A: The one we merged?",
        "A: Well, inside was better, but y -- we stayed there until [indecipherable] almost til the end of the\nyear, end of --",
        "A: \u00b043.",
        "A: Yeah. We stay with them, and -- but there was a big raid, a raid, the raid was -- they attacked\nus in the winter. I don\u2019t know which was [indecipherable] the year or that was the end of the year\n-- end of the \u00b043.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: It was a -- we merged with them for a couple months later.",
        "A: Couple months later there was a -- a -- you see, the -- the marshes freeze in the winter and so\nthey had the -- the lake froze, so the German gro -- the militia what they had -- they had also\nBelarussian militia in there, they teamed up with the German SS, and they raided our camp,\nwhich it was easy to -- to come over because the -- the lake was frozen in the winter, and\nattacked us. We didn\u2019t have any casualties, but we just escaped, just -- just -- and the trouble\nstarted then with this -- you couldn't -- and things changed, this -- this Russian commander sort\nof was good, so long, til is -- he took in some Russian escapees from camp, or whom -- who\nwere [indecipherable] Russian guys, and they didn\u2019t like the way they -- they said the Jews are\nlazy bum -- you know, the Jews are really -- so the [indecipherable] so he -- he sort of agitated,\nyou know, to be -- you know, h-he wasn\u2019t anti-Semitic before, but he -- what they -- what they\ngave him lessons or something, I don\u2019t know. And he changed, he changed, he wasn\u2019t the -- he\nlistened to them, the -- get rid of the Jews, get rid of the Jews, get a -- since then he decided -- he\nsort of took a group of Jews, small group and try to get [indecipherable] he don\u2019t want to. So\n[indecipherable] them, he took a -- went east. So he | -- he left us -- he left the group from -- this\nBaranovichi group, probably [indecipherable] th-they separated -- they separate us again, cause,\nyou know, it\u2019s over. The raids broke the whole thing --",
        "A: And the -- the -- th-the -- he was changed, was became also anti-Semitic, yeah, because they -\n- they told him, they te -- they gave him a lesson.",
        "A: They gave him a lesson, and again --",
        "A: Yeah?\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "A: The second, when we merged with the other group?",
        "A: Oh, the -- Pugachov. That -- it was something that -- we went back -- we still had a Jewish\ngroup in existence, I mean, since they went back -- they went, they left people and they left the\ner -- us, and were -- now, who does that? They have -- the g -- the group originally, which was a\ns -- was sort of dismantled because you had a raid and people were running in different\ndirections, til they grouped together it took a long time, couple weeks because you spread out\nwho knows where, because it was a big raid. Took a couple days until they burned the village,\nand took a few days and they were -- we were spreading out in the depths from the woods\nsomewheres. We didn\u2019t know how fa -- long they stay, but they were -- tried to go back, but they\nwere still stay -- the German forces were thi -- still in the village for a few days, you know, that\u2019s\nunheard of -- it was unheard of til then, how long they stayed, they want to clean up -- clean out\nthis area. So -- but this commander of this group Pugachov is a Russian guy, and he start ta --\ntaking -- getting in more people like from the Russian prisoners -- Russian guys, prisoners,\nescaped prisoners. And -- and there were s -- they were anti-Semitic, and they sort of talked them\nin.",
        "A: Yeah, I said --",
        "A: So to [indecipherable] against -- well, it turned out they eliminate Jewish people because they\nwere the majority, and -- and they [indecipherable] the things to be there, they had the\ncommander, he gave them everything. He was like a big -- big commander, do -- do nothing. So\nthen there was a -- a call to go east, partisans should group east wa -- 1-1n deep -- deeper\n[indecipherable] because they could group together bigger units -- bigger partisan brigades, so\nthey, because the German -- four German battalions were really active in -- in raids, and they\nfigure if they th -- if they were grouped together, they still be stronger resistance and they would\nnot be able to eliminate these group. So he delayed that call til -- delayed until finally after the\nraid, and these two fr -- fre -- couple friends, the Russian escapees talked them in and say, he got\n-- he gotta do something, in other words, so he left. Half of the group behind it -- he\n[indecipherable] from the old -- his old Jewish friends, the others, and the Russians, guys, and he\ntook off east, he left us alone. We had eight -- four rifles -- four rifles, very little arms. In other\nwords, we were a lot of pe -- we were 36 people, something. And we tried to stay and maintain\nwhatever we could do, try to get some contact, we couldn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t find any contact with\nany other groups. So we\u2019re by ourselves. But the Gorkinsens, these were after us. They want to\nget rid of us in that area. They don\u2019t want us in this area because it\u2019s their -- their area, they say\nit\u2019s their territory.",

They don\u2019t\nwant us in their area.",
        "A: What we were doing?",
        "A: Me?",

        "A: And we -- we had s -- we lost stuff -- we lost the camp. They raided camp and we had to leave\nto the other side. So now we have to do it more secure they -- around the camp. So we had to\npatrol around the areas with excess roads, watch the ol -- the oncoming [indecipherable] or raids\nor something. So sort of -- sort of tried to be more careful now, cause we | -- we | -- almost lost\ntwo people, cause they were wounded in that raid, in the first raid. So that was my doing now\nwith --",

        "A: What?",
        "A: Is coming closer to our camp.",
        "A: Coming closer to our camp, we had to evacuate, go somewhere else. In the first place, it a fo -\n- before that happened, we -- there were four others, they -- they -- we got from -- left for -- for\nus, for this group, the Gorkinsens want -- came to that [indecipherable] and they says lets -- you\nhave to go for a certain operation. The arm -- you have to s -- give me -- send all armed men with\nus, all the -- so we send four guys, we have four -- four arms, four guys. And they -- when they\ncame to the point where the -- they were introduced [indecipherable], this 1s the man in -- in\ncommand of this operation, he says he wants to look through the arms, everybody should check\ntheir arms. So he -- they let them check their arms, but they never gave back. They rob their arms\nin a nice way, in a nice way, in a tricky way. In a tricky way they robbed the arms, and the --\nwhen they came home without arms, we say that -- that\u2019s the end of us. We have no choice now,\nwe -- I don\u2019t know, we have to do something. Well, it was t -- it was tough without arms, we\ncouldn\u2019t -- without arms you can\u2019t -- can\u2019t even get food, you know. So we waited. In\nmeanwhile, the -- the -- the river was flowing and the camps a way -- and our camp was sort of\ngetting more water and water, you see? Soon enough, we\u2019ll probably -- we\u2019ll have to be stuck or\ncan\u2019t go further, or we\u2019ll go s-sinking here, because the water 1s coming in fast. So this\ncommander, he send out two guys, two in different direction -- two in the one direction, and me\nand -- I went out with my friend Jonathan in one direction to look a way out. If you don\u2019t -- we\nalways had the river for the road, but we have to find a way to go beside the river to get out of\nthis area -- of this swamp -- of this swampy area or something. So I have -- I have been good at\nthat, I always have -- went out scouting, and I went out with my friend Jonathan and well\n[indecipherable] a couple hours looking around the area, how to get to -- out -- to make a way\nout in a dry way, not -- not into the water, and to -- so when the two other guys went a little bit\non the different direction, they should look in that direction. And I came back to reported this, we\nhave a good way out and that\u2019s all, we could simp -- not difficult to get out from here. Found still\na dry way -- dry land to go out. The other two guys took a little longer time to come back.\nCouldn\u2019t ra -- didn\u2019t [indecipherable] whether they got lost or something [indecipherable]. They\ngot lost, they got a little wandering around a little bit. They couldn\u2019t find it. They came back --\nthey couldn\u2019t find anything out. They couldn\u2019t find a way out. [indecipherable]. As we sitting\nand goo -- discussing the reports of these ex -- the evacuation of ours -- camp, two Gorkinsens\nappeared.",
        "A: Gorkin -- the two guys from gor --",
        "A: -- and says -- and they said, who the two guys who -- who -- yeah, they reported they met\nonce of the -- one guy that met one of the Gorkinsens. Okay, it wasn\u2019t so clear, but anyhow they\nsaid they met one guy. Okay, so these guys came and they said who are they. Who are they, they\nsay. So these two guys raise their hands. So they says come along to our commander, he wants to\nco -- ke -- ask you some questions because he wa -- you -- you came over and he wants to know\nwhy [indecipherable]. Oh, we says, you know why, because I -- we wanted have a way out and\nwe\u2019re looking a way out. Yeah, but to him -- you gotta explain to him, he wouldn\u2019t take -- come\nalong. As they walked out, two minutes later, two shots. So we -- this [indecipherable] our\ncommander said well, tomorrow morning we have to go. It\u2019s no -- it\u2019s no use to stay here, it\u2019s no\ngood. So we figure, we lost two guys again, and no reason. Well, we di -- we sort of made up\nthat -- that was the -- towards the evening, in the evening. That next morning we don\u2019t wait too\nlong, early in the morning we get out [indecipherable]. And as we packed our stuff in the\nmorning to get out, two guys are here [indecipherable] again from them, two other guys and they\nmake sure that we -- that we are moving out. They watched us going, so they went back to\n[indecipherable]. Going on, we had no place where to go, cause everything -- everywhere 1s\ndangerous. You know, sort of being pushed out to the edge, to the -- and we could not -- we find\na place we stayed at -- we stayed a couple days in a place, we says it isn\u2019t temporary -- it isn\u2019t\nsteady, but temporary, wait until we find the pet -- permanent place. But again they showed up,\nmore than one, more than two, the whole group. And -- and we sort of -- so we had -- we left\ntogether, we had -- each one had two hand grenades. We had the hand grenades, Russian hand\ngrenades. So you had them in the belts here, two hand grenades. So they figured we don\u2019t have\narms, they finish -- they finish off us. They -- they want to finish -- there was -- they took arms\nand they are alone, without arms. Well, they came in, they looked around, see we still have hand\ngrenades, I think they changed their mind. They just, oh, I want to see where you -- where you\nsettle -- where you settled. You know, made themself in good friends. Good friends. And they\nleft. They saw the -- saw the hand grenades, they didn\u2019t want to start a war. Anyhow, we went\nfurther, what you say, again [indecipherable] decide it\u2019s not the place to stay, because they will --\nthey'll be coming in here and there. If not today, they will come tomorrow again. So we moved\nfurther out.",
        "A: We moved out to a -- almost to the end of the partisan zone, you know, it\u2019s almost -- very\nclose to the German patrols, okay? And over there we stayed a few -- couple days, and it ha --\nstill -- still I saw one or two of them coming -- coming nearby.",
        "A: To look a -- to look -- to se -- to find out where we -- where we s -- where we -- we camping.\nThere was a real tra -- strange thing. At the same time, two our friends, those who were -- went\nout with j -- with the Pugachov, they broke up with them and they came back cause had t -- they\nhave girlfriends here, in us. So they had two rifles, each one had two guns -- they have two guns.\n[indecipherable] we were happy to see them, cause with -- with two guns, at least we can defend\nourselves, you know. It\u2019s -- and then we could get some food, also.",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s th -- it wasn\u2019t very well organized where they left, but -- with Pugachov, so he\nwas not commander any more, and they were sort of dispersed in different groups.",
        "A: I think they were not -- they didn\u2019t control where we is. They left and they came to us -- their\ngirls. So we gonna have sitting this [indecipherable] situation if we get -- we has to be --\nsomething has to be done, you know, we cannot just keep running --",
        "A: -- there\u2019s no place where to go.
