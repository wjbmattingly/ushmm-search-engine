        "A: Yal. Sure. Sure. I was very fortunate. Uh...My wife tells me. She's from Belgium. I was born\nwith a silver spoon. At that time I did not know, but...uh...uh...my parents were quite off.\nThey had their own beauty shop and barber shop. They have...we had couple apartment\nhouses. I was going to private school. We had a maid in the house and we also a...uh...a\nmaid for me, a German lady. When came in school, she took me and my brother...she took\nus around and we spoke German with her, and I spoke Russian at home so I...I learned to\nspeak around six, seven languages.

I\nmade all kind of sports until...uh...naturally, the Russians came...before the Russians came.\nWhen the Russians came in 1940, they took away everything over night, all our belongings,\nour...they nationalized the barber shops, the homes, everything. They gave us only one\napartment and they gave us a...uh...my father a job. But when the Germans came they did\naway our lives. And...uh...there were...[ remember I came from a concert. It was at night\ntime, and at 2 o'clock the first bomb was dropped in Kovno airport, and my...uh...whole life\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas shattered. I mean we took 180 degrees turn. And fortunately enough my parents never\npampered me. And...uh...always said, although I maid, I always had to do thing myself in\nthe house, and this was a good thing because ...because when the war came, I...uh...I wasn't\nlost. I wasn't a pampered child. I adapt myself to the problems, even when the war started\nright away and we ran and...uh...we tried to escape, went...went with the Russian army. And\nit was... remember that...that night we went through a town and the whole trees are burning\nwhere the Germans throw incinerator bombs over there and we ran right through the fire\nand right through the misery.

I did\nnot...uh...for some reason or another L...L...[ roll...even...even being a child of 14 or so, I can\nroll with the punches and accept...uh...much reluctantly our...our problems for the future.\nAnd we knew that the future 1s going to be nothing but hell. But we were cut off. The\noffensive, German offensive was...was pretty fast and they cut us off and we had to return\nback home. We returned back home. Luckily in our...in our homes we met our aunts and\nuncles over there in our apartments and...uh...the Lithuanians didn't do nothing. All because\nthey...we...we treat them...my parents treat them prior to or we lucky they did not attack our\nhouses, but they killed during the week. During absence, absence. They killed at least about\n10,000...uh...Jewish people before the Germans came in. See, they...they were proud what\nthey have done, and they didn't kill just with machine guns or guns. They beheaded, they\nraped, they murdered, they robbed in the...I remember I went in a...after we came to the\nghetto, I came in a house where a friend of my...a friend of a schoolmate lived and they\nkilled...they raped her and her mother and they killed her father and with this blood the put a\nsign of the wall nemne kome (ph) take revenge. That was written down on the wall.\nNow...uh...when we came back and we were...uh...put together we had no right to go out\nnowhere. We were sitting 1n the...1n the house and waiting for further orders. The...the\nGermans came in and they started giving orders. The Lithuanians were very happy to fulfill\ntheir orders. They were actually the front man. You can...they called themselves the\npartisans. And they were taking people to the Seven Fort and Nine Fort. Any body they can\ngrab, they're killing. That's the LIthuanian. Beside the German before...before the Germans\nstarted giving out orders what to do, how to organize. Then after a month or two they\ndecided to have a ghetto, and the ghetto was made in...they call a little place called Slabotki.\nIt's right before Kovno. And...uh...in Slabotki was known to have...there was a\nterrific...uh...blood bath because the...there was a religious group of Rabbis and Hassidian\nand they....uh...they killed a lot of them. They tore their beards and they kill a lot of them.\nAnd this is a...a chapter which I...uh...I hated to speak about it.",
        "Q: Tell us...tell us what happened exactly.",
        "A: Uh...They...they pulled out the Rabbis from the apartment, from the learning house...the\n(ph) and they cut their beards off and they hung em and they cut their head off and the hair\nand they made em take a Sefer Torahs in the shul and the holy books and put em in piles in\nburn it. And then...then the Lithuanian partisans killed them right...right there and then.\nThey...uh...killed them and they throw them in in shallow graves next to the river all the\nNiemen or the Velier. There are two rivers over there. And...and after when they closed...in\nthe ghetto. And when the ghetto was established and the water...the water took away the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsand and they were exposed, so we had to take out all...take them all out from inside the\ngraves and rebury them. It was a...a terrible experience. And...uh...then they establish a\nghetto and I was...they grabbed people to make the fences. I was also one to make a fence.\nAnd we had to encircle ourselves in our own fence, and...uh...the (ph) and we were\ngathered together around 30,000. It was a small ghetto...was two ghettos in fact, a small\nghetto where they had a little hospital and they put the old people in the hospital, and then\nthere was a larger ghetto. It's one they decided to liquidate the hospital and liquidate the\ndoctors and just burn the whole thing up...the whole flame, and didn't let anybody to go and\nhelp them. We were standing outside watching how the sick people and the people are\nburn...are burning up...the whole ghetto. And we asked them questions. How come you\ndo...that you do that? There wasn't answers. We want to eliminate...we wanta liquidate as\nmany as we can they said. They give us all kind of excuses that from now on, we aren't\ngoing to do anymore. We ain't\u2019 gonna burn. We ain't gonna do... We put you all to work\nand...uh...you're gonna work. And then it was the 28th of October in 1942, they\nhad...uh...sent out some...uh...fliers that next day all the people should...should get together\nand they should assemble themselves in a place called the Democracy place. So I...and at\nthat time around 20, 29 people in the morning...they got together and\nthey...anybody...they're gonna find a house, they said they're gonna kill. They're gonna shoot\nthem to death. So we got up in the morning...6 in the morning and families, with all...with\nchildren and babies, everybody assembled themselves. 7 o'clock exactly. We didn't know\nwhat...what is gonna happen. We didn't know what's...because they told we just gonna count\nthem...count you out how many you are, and 1n the evening you're going back home. But 7\no'clock in the morning the...we were surrounded by the Lithuanian police, Lithuanian\npartisans and...uh...1n columns. We all stayed in columns. And German officers they were\nthere _ (ph) a people and they start sorting us. Right and left. We didn't have at that time an\nidea what's all about it. But we felt that something 1s wrong because all the older people and\nthe sick ones were going on side and the one who could...could still work was going on the\nother side. When it came to us, we were standing in line together, my father, my mother and\nmyself and my grandmother and my aunt, they were elderly. And because of them, he put us\nall in the bad side. We...my mother got very scared and she told my father, \"Maybe you can\nrun away. Get out.\u201d Because he work...worked in the fire department. He had a arm...arm\nband. And...uh...the police department, and also a arm band and at that time the Germans\ndidn't recognize if you're police or not police, so he...she pushed him out from the line as\nthey were taking us to the side for the sick people and she said, Maybe you can help us.\nMaybe you can...uh...you save our lives.\u201d And ...uh...the Lithuanians just pulled us away\nand with a...with the guns, they beat us up and they throw us in the other ghetto. You could\ncall a small ghetto which was all fenced up. In the evening there were accumulated about\n10,000 people in that...uh...small compound...small ghetto. What our destination we still\ndidn't know. We...we thought that maybe they're gonna give us other work. We never\nthought they're gonna kill us. After all 10,000 people. But the Germans had their own plans\nalready. They had all prepared. They had taken out the Jewish and Russian prisoners to\nNinth Fort and they dig...dug trenches. And then...uh...they...uh...put machine guns and then\nthey're going...there they they're gonna kill us and...and bury us. As we were\naccumulated...as we got assembled in that small ghetto (sigh) we didn't know...we were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nconfused. We didn't know what happening. The people were crying. They were separating\nchildren from old people. We didn't know. My father wasn't here. I was just my mother. For\nsome reason, a instinct we should keep on moving further away and not to stay in the\nbeginning. All through the night...we shouldn't run away there...the LIthuanians were\nshooting in the sky with...with guns. It was like a battle zone in order for us...to keep us\nscared. Now in the middle of the night without our knowledge....we didn't know that, they\nstart pulling out people already, and putting them in..in trucks and taking them away. In\nour...our place was the going in the morning. We were in line to go in the morning. For\nsome reason or another I was...uh....told my mother, \"Let's ...let's stay back. Let's don't be in\na hurry. Maybe some day...maybe my father's going to help us. Something 1s going to\nhappen.\u201d And...uh...as we...was already 12 o'clock, and we were less than 100 people and\neverybody was taken away to the ninth fort to be short. We were staying and there was a\nlady standing in front of us and the German officer recognized her. She worked for him.\nAnd she was with a baby, and he pulled her out from the line and dragged her out. As he\ndragged her out on the good side, so called, so-called, the ___ (ph) it was...my father\nhappened to be there. My father...because he all night long, he tried to come...begged\npeople, begged the Germans to help...to...to save...you know, he said, that's my wife and my\nchild is there. He didn't talk anymore about my grandmother or my aunt or his sisters were\nthere because they're older you see. Because of them we also got lined up on..the bad side.\nSo as she was pulled out he...he fell on his knees and he...uh...and that woman happened to\nrecognize my father. She said, \"Your wife and son is still there.\u201d And he start begging the\nGerman and there was next to him sitting...standing the chief of police, a Jewish chief of\npolice, and he also start begging the German. \"He's a good man. I know him,\" he said,\n\"Help him.\u201d He said, \"Come.\u201d And here, all of a sudden, as I stay in line with my...my\ngrandmother and my aunt and myself, my mother and myself, I hear a scream, \"You're\nhusband's __ (ph). Your husband's running.\u201d I...like a wild man, I...I...1 jumped out. I was\nonly a child, 14 or so. I saw my father. It like a Messiah is coming. I had a feeling that...I\ndon't know what...what is going to happen to us, but the feeling was there that something 1s\ngoing to happen to us. And the German looked at me, at my father and we looked\nalike...facial expression. He said...and my father was running like a wild man...he's eyes and\nhis hair. I still remember the...the way he looked. And I jumped on him. I said, \"Papa.\u201d The\nGerman said, \"Is this your son?\" He said, \"Yes. \"Whom else do you have here?\" He said,\n\"My wife.\u201d \"Take your wife and come on.\u201d And as we walked out people were screaming,\n\"Take my child.\u201d They take the last hundred and took them away to be killed. And it took\nus...he saved our life and that... this was a scene I'll never forget. And they...they took the\npeople on the ninth fort...they were...they put in bunkers and heard at that time told...they\nstripped until the underwear and they walked out a hundred at a time they were machine\ngunned for 3 days and then they covered them up with dirt. For 3 days the graves were\nmoving up and down. They took tractors and run over the graves in order to squeeze out the\nlast breath. And when the front came closer and the Germans did not want to leave no\nevidence, they undug the graves and they found mother with children hugged together by\ndying and with parents, grandmothers. They saw people together. And they burned them all\noff. We could see from the ghetto. Wasn't far from the ghetto. We could see the flames all\nthe way to the sky. We still didn't know what it was until people escaped from there. There\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwere Jewish people and the...and the Jewish prisoners and the Germans and the Lithuanians\ntold them to undig them all. And while they were undigging them they told them to take out\nall the gold from their teeth and...and put it for the Germans...to save them. They also they\nthemselves stole the gold and before New Year's Eve...It was in 40..43, before they go finish\nthe burning, they have bought for...for...for the guards the gold...it was a whiskey.\nAnd...uh...New Year's eve or Christmas eve, they made them all drunk. And being winter\nand being white...they took white sheets and they escaped that way. They all 200 escaped\nfrom nineth fort. It was a...1t was a tremendous thing what they have done. And they..they\ndelivered the witnesses. They were there by the killing and they were there by them digging\nand burning the Jews...the people up. And they saw what the Lithuanians had done. There\nwere very few Germans. Actually the whole thing was done by Lithuanians. They were\nGermans were just guiding the whole operation. And they were the witnesses which\nescaped from them. It was a tremendous..uh...the German hierarchy was tremendous upset.\nThey looked all over for them, but some...naturally, some didn't get...they hide in ghetto.\nThey caught couple of them, but most of them escaped. After that tragedy, we still did not\nknow what happened to 10,000. From 10,000 just myself, my mother was survived, and my\nfather. And the rest went in...that lady, which we still didn't know who she was. She\nrecognized...she knew my father. The ghetto was chaotic. It was...uh...unbelievable. People\ndidn't care to work. They didn't care to...to do anything. After all, the ghetto cut almost in\nhalf and every family had somebody taken away.",
        "Q: What did you do? You went back to the ghetto?",
        "A: I went back to the ghetto. Yal. Back to the ghetto and back to the room where we were in\nbarracks over there. And the life quote unquote become normal.",
        "Q: Tell us about that life. What...how did you feel?",
        "A: Okay. As...uh...as we were in the ghetto...you know, the ghetto had own police department,\nfire department, had a Jewish community committee and...uh...they had an order for...the\nGermans also wanted the ghetto...ghetto to...to exist because the hierarchy for the Germans\ndidn't want to go to the Russian front. So things are...starting getting better on the Russian\nfront. They thought they going with the Blitzkrieg. They going in...in 2 weeks, they go and\nkill the Russians. The war was over. I remember one...one thing a...a...a German told my\nfather as we running there. We were caught between the Germans and the Russians on the\nfront and the Russian dug in all the...bunch of young kids. I remember then. They told us\nkeep on going because the front is going to be...after the 24 hours they shouldn't know each\nother. And they held out actually the whole German army. Young boy...German officer told\nmy father. Hitler said 2 weeks going to be Blitz. The war be over. In 2 years if the Russian\nfight that way, 2 more years the war won't be over. He said this the first day or the second\nwar started. They didn't realize because the whole Europe, they took very easy. You see,\nFrance and Belgium and Holland, but here they...they were getting very resistance, you see.\nSo the German himself had an interest in the Kovno ghetto operation because it killed the\npeople from the small towns, a kill with nothing left over there. In the ghetto, they...they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nestablished that as their...their place. They...they had a Jewish people working for them like\nthe Judenrat and...uh...they tried to establish something good for us and good for them.\nMostly for them. But they had...they need us too in order to control their destiny for awhile\nthey need us too. The front was still away. There is still a successful. So I...uh...I had a job\nyouth organization for small children got a job to teach us a trade. And I worked a little bit\nover there. Then they made a brigade to go to air...air...airport for small children or for small\nchildren to go to work in fields. Now the older people they...they promised they ain't going\nto do more less things you had to assemble all 10,000 someplace else and they...uh...still\nwas trying to fool us. They were very smart and they knew how to psychologically. They set\nup a special office to fool us psychologically. They were very, very (ph). And we...we\nhad to believe them. In order to survive we had to believe them. Help we didn't get from\nnobody. Escape from the ghetto we couldn't...we couldn't do. If we escape, a Lithuanian saw\nus and you were a Jew, he told the Germans on us. Help was not coming. We couldn't create\nand get a partisan groups because we did not have enough woods like in Poland, like in\nRussia to escape. And..uh...the Lithuanian population had no interest in helping us. They\nwere happy. In fact, we were a burden to them. We took away their place and their homes.\nThey took away everything we had was okay. But we're living in their homes in small\nshacks over in the ghetto in...uh...Slobotka, it was no good. Pressure on...they put pressure\non the German government to...uh...to get us out. They didn't care how they get us out or\nkill us or whatever, you see. Now...uh...after they start creating the brigades and they told\neverybody that...uh...things will be better. They gave us enough food...and they gave us for\nawhile enough food in ghetto in order to calm our nerves we should start believing them. It\nwas all done psychologically. And it worked.",
        "Q: What...what was your father doing at this time. You told me he had to go someplace.",
        "Q: He... Yal. My father was...uh...1n the...in the fire department and there was a lot of...we didn't\nhave many fires because we didn't have even in case we had a fire, small fire somes, you\nhad to...uh...run with like bucket...bucket brigade or we had an old fire engine, like a pump\nfire engine. And the roads were full of stand. There were no roads. So you had to push them\nby hand to the fire. By they time...they came to extinguish the fire, there was no house, no\nfire. But...uh...there were a lot of suicides going on. And my father...uh...used to...people\nused to jump in the wells to commit suicide and any time they called...they___\u2014_\u2014. They\ncalled my father because he was...he knew how to go down in a deep well and with a rope,\nhold himself and bring the people up. He saved a lot. Also a lot drowned because by the\ntime they call him...they had no telephones...uh...the problem was, so lots of them died. But\nbecause of him...people knew him...what a good many was...how he saved people in ghetto.\nThis way...other incident I told you before, this way the police department...police chief as a\nGerman told him, \"He is a good man. Save his family.\u201d He was...he was known. And ...and\nalso because of him I got also a easier job in ghetto rather than going to work on air\nforce...airport being I was still young. He gave me also job called elbote that I was...I\nworked in the ghetto. There were no telephones, just taking messages for him to\nthe...from...from their office to other place. I was like a runner. It was my...my job.\nUh...They gave me a little...uh...hat and they gave me a band here, a uniform. This was my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\njob. And this kept me...kept me alive...kept me out from doing hard work. Uh...Being still\nyoung, he wanta kept me around him. Then they organized, as the war progressed and as the\nwar got worse, the German...we got involved in...uh...1n the cold weather.... the\nwashing...we got bogged down there. They needed fur coats. They needed shoes. They\nneeded gold. So they had one time a...uh...flier out on the wall...All the fliers came on\nthe...on the walls by the Jewish community committee that next week in 3 days, all the Jews\ngot to bring in their gold and their furs and their leather boots, everything. They start\nbringing 1n their leather coats, leather coats, the boots, but gold was not coming in.\nSo...uh...the Germans had a remedy for that. For a week, they walked around the ghetto and\nthey was killing people on sight. The SS brigade came in. Every morning 8 o'clock, 9\no'clock and everyone 1n sight they killed, like dogs. And after a week, they said, \"If you\ndon't bring back...We'll do...we'll stop it only if you bring back all the gold.\u201d\nAnd...uh...this...uh...they shook everybody up and...uh... naturally, everybody brought...in\norder to stay alive, in order to continue with their life, they brought all the gold they've taken\nout the most fur and gold from the Kovno ghetto than other all the ghettos together. And\nthey said, again after...after you bring us the gold, again everything will be nice and fine.\nDon't worry about it. It's fine. How can...but meanwhile they organized...they took out five\nintellectuals they needed intelectuals to drive them from ghetto, scholars, teachers they\nneeded them for a special job to go in Latvia. And sure enough people ... they trust .. so\nhow can they trust? We were so...we became so minimized our life...like they\nde...degenerated you see. They made for us...uh...a resistance of culture, a resistance of\nbeing a humanbeing became so nil...became like...like animals. And this was their intention\nto minimize. They took five hundred of our people, registered the best, the most\nintellectuals and we never saw from them anymore. We still goal...this were the aktion\n..aktion from the 500. Then they created a brigade...a workshop...in ghetto workshop where\nthey...we produced like toys for the Germans, wooden toys and...uh..dolls. Uh...Also, we\nwashed all the clothes came from the front, the bloody clothes and everything. We washed\nover there, and we sewed them up. We made a shoe factory to...uh...repair the old shoes\nfrom the front. Many times became frozen. We pulled off ...we pulled off the...uh...many\ntimes you find skin and blood in the shoes and the boots. We washed them out over there.\nThey had...there were 500 people working over. I was also fortunate to work there too and I\nwas also working there in ...uh...as a runner. And I was working as a runner and also I was\nworking as...uh...learning a trade as a...uh...smith, making different things from iron. And\nthis kept me...kept me going in order not to go out from ghetto, not to get out and...uh...be\nworked day and night over there and use up my strength something else. You see, again, I\nhave to thank my father for...for help me doing that. And then at one...uh... one day, it\npreviously...as....uh...I got a call to come in...in the office from the big boss from\nthe...uh...from the ghetto workshop over there...in the office over there. And there was\nsitting Gecke. Gecke was Oberstrumbannfuhrer Gecke. I mean I looked at him...he...his\nhead was like a...he was like the SS Obersturbanfuhrer sure. He was...the top man from the\nSS. He was taking care of the whole eastern coast...shore...eastern coast, all the east ghettos,\nand the lager and the concentration camps and all that. In fact, I found out later, he was one\nof the 15 people involved with Hitler when they...when they decided to...uh...to make unify,\nto make eliminate the Jews. He was one the few people. His eyes just penetrate me. I was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nstanding there looking at him, and his head was like a dead head....like...like a skeleton. He\nwas...uh...he asked me to take some papers to the Jewish committee. And if they give me\npapers, the boss from the Jewish ___ (ph) over there in charge, told me to take off tomorrow\ncause it's late already and don't come 1n to work tomorrow. This was...uh... that...this was\nnot the best thing for me, but because next day as I got up in the morning I heard speakers,\nloud speakers, going around the ghetto with...uh...the bull horns, and they tell everybody\nwhose not going to work, whose not at the work to accumulate to go and assemble\nthemselves on that place where...from where they have sorted people out. The memory still\nlingers with me at that time. I did not know what to do. I was sure...I sure wasn't going\nto...to go again over there. I didn't know what's gonna happen. The ghetto was already\nsurrounded with Lithuanians, the partisans they called. Uh...The people have went to work.\nAll the brigades were gone already because they go 7 o'clock...6, 7 o'clock over there the\nwhole ghetto's out. Whoever is left in the ghetto I didn't know what's gonna happen. I\ngot...uh...1 went and hide in the room right away and start try to find a place to hide. It's like\na...uh...a rat looking for some place to hide. I didn't...I didn't know where to go, and I didn't\nknow where they find us. I saw a little shed. You see the ghetto was made in a...where\nfarmers used to live...farmer country. There was a shed like a...not a out house, a shed with\na cellar inside where they keep hay. It's a little barn, a small barn. So I opened the barn and I\nsaw through a...a trap door in the bottom. So I pushed away the hay in the side and as I was\ntrying to go inside two mothers with little babies came to me and said, \"Please help me.\nPlease help us.\u201d I said, \"What are you doing. I know...I know what I'm doing.\u201d They said,\n\"Please let me go in with you in that...in that basement...in that hole. It was not basement,\nwas a hole with a cellar they dug out.\u201d I said, \"Come down.\u201d I didn't care. And I put hay on\nthe trap...on the trap and...uh...I just went down. And it was dark, but I could see through\nthat crack in the door, in that little...uh...trap door. (cough) Exactly 8, 9 o'clock, I don't\nknow exactly when, the Germans came, the police and...uh...they start banging houses, raus,\nraus, raus, Juden raus. I didn't know what was going on. And he opened...the German\nopened the door, flinged the door wide open and he comes in and he starts feet...starts\nshaking around all that...that...uh...hay, straw and he's standing on top of that door. And\n[...I'm...the door is almost collapse, and I'm trying to hold up the door shouldn't collapse\nover there. And I say, \"God, help me.\u201d I mean why...what can I do? And...uh...he looked\naround and looked around and took...took his bayonet...I could see all that...and shoveled\naround in all that hay and he walked out. But he didn't walk...he was like a post. He was\nwalking back and forth. As soon he walked out, one baby start to cry. So I said, \"Please.\nPlease. Help us. Help us.\u201d So, she stopped. The baby stopped crying. And...uh...I know if he\ndidn't grey and he didn't have a heart attack. I was only 15 years old, 15 and a half years old,\nand I could see the German all day long going back and forth. And the other baby start\ncrying. So the mother urinate in her hand and the baby to drink, you know, to keep quiet.\nExactly again they came in and look but didn't...didn't step no more on that... was ready to\nhold up again. He didn't...just looked outside in. Other guard came and they joked and\nthey...they...they had a good time going back and forth. And...uh...exactly 4, 5 o'clock the\nwhistle blew. Every...everything was done exactly perfect. And...uh...A...uh...a German\ntruck picked them all up, all the post over there. And I made sure and seen them off and\nwalked to the first and looked around. I told the mothers came out. And one baby was died.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nShe...the mother... the mother choked her own baby. And this left a tremendous impression\non me because now (ph) I saw her and my grandfather. And one baby 1s still alive\nbecause the mother she urine and she get a drink but the other baby from...from fear, the\nmother choked her own baby, choked her own child...choked her own child. I didn't see\nthem anymore because the Germans did not finish the job that day. The next day they came\nagain. This is called the kinder aktion. They had picked up all the...as the parents when they\nwent to work, the children are left. Some parents was left their children. Some grandparents\nwas left their children because that...everybody went to work on the air port or\nwhatever...the brigades. So they...they were going around with dogs and finding little babies\nand children and 5 year old. I didn't know what happened that time. The whole thing\nhappened in front of my father where he had the fire department over there by the Jewish\ncommittee. They came in buses, and they line the buses in Germans. And as they assembled\nthe children they thrown the in...in the buses. So if a mother would not part the child....she\nwanted to be with her child...they sicced...a German dog was trained so, to jump on the\nmother's face and bite his face so the mother dropped the child. They grabbed and brought\nher child in...in the bus. They didn't care for the...for thee parents. They want only the\nchildren. And...uh...next day, naturally I went to work and...uh...next day by the same thing,\nthey...whatever left children one day, they picked it up next day. When the parents came\nfrom...from work at night, (Pause) it was...it was hard to describe what...what\nhappened...what happened there. (Pause) They came from work. (Pause) And you\nfind...you find children. So they...they picked up the pillows and blankets (Pause) (Sigh) and\nthey ran around in ghettos screaming (Pause) (Sigh) (crying) and pulled their hair. I saw\na...a woman came up to one of the Germans and the guard somebody by the fence and start\nscreaming at him and and calling him swine. He took out a gun and killed her. A...a Jewish\nlife didn't mean nothing. They had no...they had no...uh...I don't know what kind of people\nthey are. I mean I saw a German...a young man came in ghetto, played with a little poodle,\nlittle tiny dog, puppy. He played with him. He gave him chocolate. He finished playing,\ntook out a gun and killed him. I mean it's unbelievable. And as you live all this through,\nsmall incidents, which are not written up in the books...just right here, it's...uh...you just\ncan't believe. You can't believe it how people can be that cruel. (Sigh) After that,\nthank...thank God, I was still with my parents, my mother and father at that time.\nBut...uh...for the rest of the people life became really nothing. No...No...1t wasn't worth\nliving, but people have children. People have families. People have the grandparents and\ngrandparents...grandmother...grandparents and uncles and aunts...they were all annihilate\ntaken away. We were...you became...we became nothing. We became like zombies. But\nhow little did we know that the future is still going to be worse. Uh...My all...only luck they\nsay...1 was that time maybe 15 or so, and I could still be...come every night with my parents.\nMy father protected us, my mother and me as much he could, but this also\nlimitation...limitations. Because the...uh...Russian front came closer and closer. They lost\nthe Stalingrad. And...uh...that I'm also...became heyday for 24 hours or 48 hours. You can\ngo go around and get and kill all the Jews. You want them and just get out and take out\nanger on Jews. So they lost the Stalingrad and we suffer. They want we suffer. So we were\nlike a pawn...you know, like a...like a nothing. And it became closer and we heard news\nthat...uh...they're losing everywhere because we got more and more wounded soldiers\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncoming back from the front and people...people worked in the unclothing means where\nthey were...1n Kovno was that a point where they stop and they clean them up before send to\nGermany. And the people, the Jewish peopled them undressed, helped them to clean up\nbodies, and helped them in the shoes and in the uniforms came in ghettos to be washed.\nAnd...uh...and the mood from the soldiers where they were cursing and, you know, the\nGerman government. They were cusring Hitler, but still there was not a big spark to...to get\nhim to make a new government or to kill him or something. But nothing that even get\nreunited, but they're too afraid of doing something like that. So we knew that if they having\nproblems on the front...we knew the front is getting closer. And...uh...Gecke came, the\nOberstrumbammfuhrer...Gecke came and he told the...uh...the Judenrat...Jew...the Jewish\nleaders, \"Don't worry. We...uh...we won't annihilate you. You'll still...they figure back in\nGermany, you work for us. They have factories over there. But...uh...we still did not know\nthe concentration camp. We still doesn't...didn't know. We didn't have the connection.\nUh...Some people did, but...but we did not know...the ghetto itself didn't know that there\nwas concentration camp. We thought we the only ones survived. We...we didn't have the\ncommunication. We didn't know the Warsaw ghetto. We didn't know the uprising. We were\ncompletely isolated. We were...we thought we only ones survives. Until they start\nliquidating the liquidating the ghetto. And they start...they say in the ghetto, \"We're going to\nliquidate on that and that day because the...uh...we knew...we knew the reason why they\nwant to...and evidence when the Russians are coming closer, want burn everything up. But\nnaturally we want to save ourselves. We start hiding. So the...the first transport, they got\ntogether as many they could and...uh...and they couldn't find them all. The brought in a\nspecial...uh... trained people, killers....special killers to find the find the people who were\nhiding. We were...my father and me, my mother, we're trying to find a place to hide. But\nwhere can you hide? I mean the...1n basement you can't go and hide in the attic you can't go.\nYou might...we knew they're going to destroy all the houses so we saw outside a outhouse\nand we saw people like going in there. Somebody built a bunker. So we said, \"Please, let us\nalso in.\u201d They were nice enough to let us come in there too. So it was a big...uh...big room\nand on top was a camouflage outhouse. People didn't know there was a room downstairs.\nAnd people used the outhouse. And we were downstairs. So...uh...now it was....but to save\nyour life, you do everything. There are no end. (Sigh) And the Germans found us. Next day\nthey're looking with dogs and they...they came. I see a German SS man and he ripped apart\nthe bunker with a luger in his hands and \"Come out, Juden fechstunke (ph) Juden.\u201d You\nsmell of Jews. If you don't come out, we'll...we'll kill you. Sure enough, we came out. We\nall came out and...uh...they assembled, you know, from the other bunkers, they assembled\npeople and....uh...we looked and we smelled all of us....maybe they had over there, maybe\n500 or so. We're last transport they sent to Dachau. After us, they burned the whole ghetto\ndown. We were the last ones. And...uh...we sit together and it was a terrible day. It was\nrainy, and we were sitting in front of the Jewish Committee. The people discussed the...the\nfuture and...uh...was a parallel thing happened which I still remember. There was a small cat\nran through. And the German SS sicced his dog on the cat, and the poor cat was all pulled\nout...going, trying to get away from him, going move toward the fence. And she was...when\nshe was close to the fence, he say...he told him, \"Give a command to kill her, and he jumped\nand killed her.\u201d And this was so parallel to our lives. We are in their hand. They're the dog,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand we're the cat, and we're at their mercy. Whenever...whenever they want to kill us, they\nkill like that. And that small, little incident, is so engraved in my brain that...and it was\nall...it was like a play. The weather was bad, was windy, was cold, and the whole\natmosphere was right there. Next morning they assembled us all, and we walked all the way\nto the railroad. They put us in as much as they could...as many as they could in the freight\ncars, without much air, locked us up and we're on our way Germany. Where we...we\nwent...we were going, we didn't know.",
        "Q: Tell me about that ride? Tell me about that ride?",
        "A: As we were riding and...uh...and we're cramped together and packed together without place\nto urinate or toilet. Nothing. Was not...and no water, no bread, no nothing. Some young\nguys...myself and few others decide...decide...decide to escape. So...uh...the German\nwas...was in front, sitting with the driver...driving over. During the day he was sitting in\nfront...the front door. In the back, I took a...I took out a knife and I tried with the back door\ncut a hole. And there was a...uh...a seal there on...on the lock. I cut my arm. It went right\nthrough my arm. I got a mark here still here. And it was bleeding all over. But this...and\nonce we opened the door, and I put my small hand...I put my hand 1n there, I cut a seal,\nbroke a seal, unlocked the latch, and there was no way to...to jump because they specially\npicked out a double line all the way to Germany. They were a line...we were on one track\nand the other track was going and the Germans were going right behind us...in case the\nGerman get killed. So we closed back up and this was a adventure of trying to jump out\nfrom the train. But my cousin, I found out later did jump and his wife...a train...the first\ntransport. And...uh...they did make it. But the Lithuanians gave them...uh...told on them.\nThey were killed later. These our friends...these are people we lived all our life\ntogether...were in school together and the business together and when...uh...when the war\ncame, they kill us, as many as they could. (Sigh) Our first stop I remember was some place\nin Germany. We saw...the reason I knew it was in Germany over the border because I could\nread sign. The wheels are...are turning for the future on the trains. for\nthe...uh...Zieg means...uh...When they win a war...when they win a way, the wheels are\nturning for to win the war. So I knew we were in Germany then. The train stopped the next\nday. A German soldier came up to me...I'll never forget it...with a paper in black letters\nwritten down. And if this is said would be true, would happen, we be free right now. They\nmissed...Hitler was being...they....uh...they tried to kill Hitler, and Hitler survived. In big\nletters. This is our luck. So...uh...they gave us some water. I remember that time. And again\nthey shipped us off. They shipped us off to Stutthof. At that point I was still with my\nparents, mother and father. In Stutthof...",
        "Q: Excuse me. What I need to do now is to stop. If we may, we'll change tapes, give you a\nchance to breath and then you'll tell us the story of Stutthof.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Here...we arrived...the train. We still didn't know where where it was. And all of a sudden\nthe trains opened up...the cattle cars...wasn't a train....the cattle cars 1t was. And...uh...some\ndead people...some fainted people, and a few survivors who made it...the younger ones\ncame out. We assembled ourselves and the screaming from the Germans\n__.I...1 can still hear in my...my head...also.... the _raus, raus, Jude_. And they put us all in\nthe...in the trucks and they brought us 1n...and they took us in a gorgeous, beautiful runway\nwith trees, with a lake with...with swans on the lake. I said, \"Where are we here?\" Are they\ngoing to give you...gonna give us the work here or what...what's happening. Little did I\nknow, that's the worst hell hole. And as we assembled ourselves in a big room, in a bigger\nhall with...uh...and people had to go to the bathroom. They were special place...altogether\nwoman and men, they didn't care for the toilets. People went on too them, and they were\nstanding up and there were filled up with human waste. Two...two Germans tried to amuse\nthemselves. They start laughing. They took the end of their...uh...guns, rifles butts, and they\nhit two men in the head and they fell in...1n the human waste. And they were laid there\ndrowning. They drowned over there. And they were laughing. They had a good time. I...all\nthese things I wasn't used to that at that point. This 1s...completely different thing. And at\nthat time in that place, I lost my mother. I...I was separated from my mother. I saw her the\nlast time. They...she kissed me. I kissed her. And she asked my father to take care of me.\nAnd we hugged. The last time I ever saw her. They took at night to the...all the men...they\ntook us to the...unclothing...they took us to the...uh...the place where they kept us all night\nlong, all naked. Take all the clothes off, and we had to go in a...in a unclothing place which\nthey shaved us, the hair, whatever, and...uh...we washed. They gave us some clothes and\nclothes...1t was whatever...whatever we grabbed. Anything. Different shoes and\ndifferent....uh...jackets and different ...not a different...uh...different hat, but anyway, luckily\nwe were not sent in the crematorium. We all assembled...and I was standing with my\nfather...and next morning they sort us out...the Stutthof. They kept us a few days over there,\nprobably a week or two weeks I would say. And they...uh...they beat us up good. I start to\nfeeling what it means already being 1n a concentration camp cause the atmosphere change\neverything and they...uh...they separate the young...young kids from their parents or from\nthe other ones. They send them away. Luckily I was still at that point with my\nfather...uh...because I was...and when the German came in and followed me, I got up and\nextended my...I was tall and skinny and they let me go with my father. And they shipped us\nall to Dachau from there. And there was special...uh...camp because Dachau in camp 2.\nIn...uh...1n camp 2 they are a brand new camp. Brand new barracks and brand ....brand\nnew....the Germans and the whole thing and there was only one Lithuanian from Kovno.\nEveryone knows him which...uh...he was wearing German uniform. And he was officer\nthere, and he was the worst one. He was beating on us. He was the worst one. Again, my\nfather, being a barber, got a job working inside the camp, not to go outside. In the beginning\nI was working outside. It was a night shift, and day shift. And it was very miserable.\nThey....they are building there...it was a place build...factory for Messerschmitt...for the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nGerman...uh...more in the inland, underground factory. They had slave labors and we were\nbuilding that. That's our job. And...uh...at that place I didn't have it too bad because after\nawhile working outside, I was working inside the camp itself. My job was....as they\nprogressed...as the camp continued, people start dying off from diarrhea, malnutrition. It\nreally was very bad. It was...people were working in mud...have...up to their knees because\nthe rain was very...very...red mud over there. It was terrible place to be. But...uh...my job\nwas every morning when the lice came in...people had to be full of lice and they died. Every\nmorning I had a little cart. It was a good job. Go from barrack to barrack and pick up the\ndead people. And me and the other young boy...we used to go on from barrack to barrack\nand pick all the dead people. And me and the other young boy, we used to go on from\nbarrack to barrack and every morning take em like a rickshaw and...uh...in... both...dump em\non top of the...on top of that little wagon until they accumulate. Go out with this. Dump\nthem outside again. Do the same thing again. It's a job for the day. I was very lucky by doing\nthat because I was in camp. I didn't have to go...and I had some little more soup or more\ncoffee or more hot tea or hot water rather. And one day I come to that pile of people and\n[...uh...I saw a person laying there which...it was still breathing. He opened his eyes and he\nsaid, \"Don't you recognize me?\" He was one of my father's friends. He worked also in\nghetto as a fire...in fire department, which I knew him like I knew my father. I look at him.\nHe was still of flies. His whole body was full white...I did not...I put him on aside. I\ncouldn't do nothing about it. We didn't put him on the truck...on this truck...on this little\nhand cart. But the thing was that the lice took over the camp so dramatically and diarrhea\nand diphtheria that people are dying in masses and nothing you can do about it. They\nde...decide then to liquidate after about 4 months to liquidate the camp altogether. And they\nwere going to send my father...you see, they...they weren't interested to have families\ntogether. They want to send separate...father and son separate, brothers separate. Though\nthey liked my father. They wanted to send him in a better place and send me out to\nCzechoslovakia in a different camp. They accumulate about 500 people to send to\nCzechoslovakia to Therentenstadt...no to...uh...Flossenburg and...uh...my father said, \"No. I\nwon't go without my son. I helped him so far. I want to help him further.\u201d And it\nwas...uh...it was my luck really that we went with me. It was almost his undoing, because he\ncould have had a better place going in other camp in Germany. We were shipped away\nin..in...uh...Flossenburg. From there to Leitmeritz (Litomerice). Leitmeritz (Litomerice) was\na...Leitmeritz (Litomerice)yelling was a place from Flossenburg, other part. And there was a\nhell hole. There was a worst we ever...ever saw. From the 500 or so people, maybe 10\nsurvived. First of all, it was old camp already. And the Pollacks were in charge of the camp\nand...uh...we worked over there in mines in...uh...cement mines. And naturally the better\njobs is taken already, being an old camp. So they...uh...they all got new\n. [mean we got some new people. And they came...they grabbed us next day and they put us\nin all kind of jobs...work. We are working 1n the...1n the coal...it's like coal mine. It's the\nsame thing. It's miserable inside. It's wet. It's...uh...muggy. It's...uh...fog all the time...little\nsmall lamps and you gotta drill, with a big drill you gotta drill the...the cement mines. It's all\ncement in Czechoslovakia. I...uh...l was working luckily with my father and the bread\nwas...the ration was terrible. You get less and less....one slice of bread and...uh...we had to\nget up...get up early in the morning. It was cold...was...uh...maybe 20, 30 below zero. We\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhad no shoes. We had wooden...uh...wooden shoes. And the wooden shoes, when you go in\nthe snow, they became like...uh...like ice skates so you could hardly walk. You had...uh...the\nuniform...one a pajama. You had to stand in a appell in the morning for 2 hours. Woke you\nup 6 in the morning, 5 in the morning 1n order to count you...they count you. They count\nyou out. If someone is missing, they had to count again. And...uh...1t was miserable. Was\njust...and people start dying off dying off. One day I standing with my father over\nthere...comes to me...there was over there...also over there besides Pollacks, besides Jews,\nall the Germans...criminals, homosexuals, whatever. I didn't know about that. I...I wasn't\nthat...that...that known what's going on in the concentration camps. I was still new about\nthat. As I stand by my father and worked, a German comes up to me and he orders me to go\nwith him. He was a...uh...a colonel from the...uh...from the air force. I didn't want to go, but\nhe says, I have to go with you. I was still...we just came up from new\ncamp....from...from Dachau. I still did not look so dilapidated and so worn out. I still looked\npretty good because I had a clean uniform. He tells me...as we go deeper...he takes me\ndeeper and deeper and he see nobody one here...just fog with little lamps burning and the\nrailroad trellis because the little railroads where they bring out the...all the cement over\nthere. He started hugging me. I started moving away. He said, \"Hug me.\u201d And he...uh...he\nwanted to kiss me. I started pushing him away. I didn't know...I was all...I was all confused.\nI didn't know what happening. And he un...he unzipped his ...uh...pants. I start screaming.\nAs I start screaming, people...uh...kapos from other brigades over there, the Polish kapos,\nstart running. And I...uh...start telling you...what happening. As I telling him the story, they\ncalled right away a SS guard and...uh...bayonets, they guy took us down in the headquarters.\nHere my father...he works over there by the cement...that big machine. He cutting cement.\nHe sees they're taking me with the guard away over there and I can't tell him nothing. He\nlooks at me. We look each other. I had...they took us in a general staff over there. I had to\ntell the story what happened over and over gain. They took a petition from me about 20\ntimes. They came over, \"How did a...a German officer try to kiss a Jew?\" That was the\nmost...uh...[...[ told them the whole story. I told them A to Z. He pulls his pants off and I\nstart screaming. So then was tremendous thing for the Germans over there. The Germans\nSS. They telegraphed to Berlin. They came to Berlin, people coming down there....coming\ndown. I had to tell the story. And they kept me completely isolated. Him and me,\ncompletely isolated. I thought that's my end. I'm finished. In the middle of the night...they\ncalled me down one night. They called me down....12 o'clock, 1 o'clock in the morning.\nAnd they took me down in unclothing. There where the...uh...showers are. He stand\nundressed...the German officer, colonel, and Germans and Pollacks beating him with cold\nwater and I had to watch how they were beating him. By the time he got through his head\nwas twice the size it was. And I...they...the more officers standing around me. I had to tell\nthem the whole story. And he was yelling mutter, help . Mother, help me. You\nsee. His head got so big his head used to . Fit right on top here. I find out\n2 days later he died from the beating. But the tragedy was they made me watch him being\ndestroyed. And I...I'm a young kid. I mean how...how can I cope with that? But I did.\nMy...my...the lucky thing was they did nothing to be me. They tell me to go back to my\nfather after that. Actually, this was a miracle. It was a miracle from God. Because see, they\ndidn't prove that I participate in anything, you see. And here...he said not...and I totally (ph).\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nHe hugged me and he kissed me in the face, and I start screaming afterwards. I went back to\nwork. (Sigh) And the one...and we got weaker and weaker and weaker because the food\nwasn't there. They tried to cut the portions less and less because...the Pollacks got bigger\nportions. And the Jews got almost nothing, and a kapo was a Pollack. So one day, we are\ncarrying cement. I mean bag cement, I could hardly walk myself. I fall down. I can't carry.\nThe German said...he was...was not German...a Polish German. He lived in Poland. He said,\n\"I'm going to kill you today.\u201d I said, \"Why\" He says, \"I'm gonna kill you.\u201d And as I picked\nup a bag...a barrel...a bag cement and walked, he knocked me down and jumped on he and\nwith his heel, hit my face and my nose and my teeth. And he let me lay there like...like I was\ndead...like blood...a piece of meat...raw meat. My father standing next to me. He could do\nnothing. And the end of the day I was laying there. End of the day, my father picked me up\nwith the other kapo, Jewish haftling, there or prisoner, whatever you call them...they\nwere...were called. And I started getting fever. I didn't know what it was. I started getting\nfever and it took me down to the...to the so-called hospital. When they call it hospital, and\nmy father left me there. He didn't see me...see anymore. And in a time he came in and\nasked, \"What happened to my son?\" They told him, \"Your son is long dead.\u201d But he never\ngave up hope. I knew while...they told me it type of fever. They threw me in a small little\narmy cot with...uh...three more...four or five Russian prisoners. They were actually\nRussians.... Russians...everything was there in the concentration camp. (Clearing throat) As\nthey start dying off. You imagine the cart is so small, and we were all laying there. As they\nwere starting...and they wouldn't give me no water and they wouldn't give me nothing. They\ndid give me a bunch of aspirins in my hand, and they told me swallow them. But I chewed\nup...how you...you can't hardly chew one aspirin. So I almost choked myself, but\n[...I...maybe it helped me. Maybe it survived me. I don't know. But a hand...handful of\naspirin I swallowed or I chewed it up. And I was laying with the guys on the cot. And four\nguys...four big guys, and they started dying off. And the less died I kept them on the blanket\nfor 3 or 4 days in order to eat his bread...his ration, and survive. I mean this is...this, you see,\nlike a tiger. You have to survive some how. I laid in the hospital without food, without\neating...so after they start swelling already, I told them he's dead. They move him away. I...I\nwas complete delirious. But I remember so vivid I want to get...get a drink of water. They\nwouldn't give no water. But they had the hose...uh...the hose that cleaned the floor, the\nconcrete floor in that hospital. They put cold water on top of me. They wouldn't let me drink\nme the water. And I was delirious thinking that I explore their minds where I worked, and I\nwanted to kill myself. Cause the Germans after me...they run after me. I gotta kill myself. So\nI some how find a wire, like a hanger...a wire, and in Europe, the toilets have a...a single...a\ncontainer on top of the water you pull down. I went in the toilet and I...[ made a loop my\nhead and I hooked up in front and I jumped off the toilet. But the...but not being rope did\nnot pull. I start gargling and I gaged myself. So somebody...prisoner or one...one next to me,\nthey got me off and I pull this off and I ran away. But I heard they were right on the blanket\nand I heard they were looking for me. Somebody was tell in Polish...at that time I spoke\nPolish well because being there you learn to speak Polish and Russian. And...uh...as I was\nlaying there in the blanket and it one day they came and I...I felt I'm getting better. How I\ndon't know. Without food. They did...the polish prisoners, they give a little soup, more\nbread. For me, nothing. I was laying there...was laying there. One day they liquidate the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwhole hospital. They took them all to be burned or gassed, whatever. They forgot me. They\ncomplete forgot me. And people ask how I survived. I don't know how I survived. This way\nI survived. They forgot me here. I was saved in the big aktion. I was...it's a miracle really.\n[...As I lay in bed, I see my father's eyes in front of me. I was laying next to the...I'll never\nforget it. I was laying next to the window. He...he never gave up looking for me. He looked\nat me. I looked at him. He start crying. I...I know the way he looked, it's like a muslim and\nhe was half dead. I'm sure I looked worse than him. He made with me the hand and he\nwalked away. So I knew that he's alive and we're still alive. Now I had to get out. I had to\nget out of here. Next to...as I was laying there a whole day by myself, but the next day they\nbrought the other group of sick people. (Cough) So I decided...again, who told me how to\nsurvive? I decided to get out from the hospital. They called shonung (ph). This is a place\nwhere you...after let's say you, you are cured quote unquote, you stay there until it get better\nand then they put you to work. But you died there anyway. They don't feed you and you die\nthere. So I say, I want to go to the shonung (ph). The only thing I had in my pajamas from\nthe hospital, the uniform over there, and...uh...a pair of wooden shoes. Nothing! And a hat.\nA hat...a...uh...a prisoner's cap. So I went in the and I laid their a couple of days and\nI said, \"If I don't get out of here, I'll die.\u201d\u201d Because a bunch of zombies walking around there,\nold people and they're dying. They're walking around with their blankets. No food. And\nthey...uh...they wait to die. You don't get better there. You die. I decided to go to work. I\ncould...I could hardly walk. Now...but the brigades were already formed, you see. And they\nI was just extra one. They grabbed me in the place. And my father saw me...that I'm going in\na brigade, but he couldn't help it because he was...his brigade passed by already, and it filled\nup....his brigade already. So here I'm going with all new people, all new kapo. Nobody\nknow me. And we're going to a big mountain, and on top the mountain, snow. Just to walk\nto the place, working place, was a effort. At least a good hour to walk. Cold. Miserable.\nHungry. I mean it's a miracle. As I came there I saw way on top the mountain they're\nbuilding a tower...a watch tower. And we're supposed to bring up strands of wire. We have\nwire carry over there...on the mountains, on the snow and everything else. So they told me I\nshould grab one. And it's heavy and I put over...you can't...you have to put over your neck in\norder to carry that. I had to walk with that up the mountain...the kapo next to me. And I\nwalk and I fall...and he beats me. So I'm thinking to myself:..the funny part was I never said\nI'm going...I never thought I'm going to die. All 3 years, I never thought I'm gonna die.\nThere is a Jewish writer Shalom Alehem, and he writes whenever I study him and he writes,\n\" .\u2019 It means you should never lose your hope. Be always...think always\nforward, you'll survive. I never thought I'm gonna die. So as I was going...crawling up that\nmountain with this big strand of wire on my neck which I am sure it weighed at least 25, 30\npounds, maybe 40 pounds... don't know...I was falling down. He beat me. I got up. He beat\nme. So I flashed back like I saw a movie years ago like the Russian the boats over\nthere. They used to fall down...the slaves. They used to beat them. They used to get up.\nThey beat them. I said, \"I'm the same...I'm the same...I'm the same...uh...I'm the same boat\nright now, and I'm gonna survive. How I made that day I'll never...I'll never...and then we go\nup and we go down and carry some more and up. Every time I fall he beat me. Fortunate\nagain, the next day my father took me in...in [his brigade. He talked to the kapo, his kapo,\nmaybe to take me and my son just came out from the hospital. He's sick. Please take him in.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd he begged him working there and also, being a barber, he also...if they're working there\n12 hours, 14 hours working in the mines without food without anything he...uh...he used to\ncome and shave people's faces for extra bowl of soup. And my...uh...he comes to me. He\nwould not eat his soup. He comes to me and he say, \"My son, I ate already. I had already\nenough. That's for you.\u201d I say, \"Papa, have you eaten already?\" \"Yal. Yal. That's for you.\u201d\nSo you cannot go yet.\u201d (Crying) (Long Pause) (Obviously crying) I can't forget his voice.\nBelieve me, not...not many fathers done that. And when he...he used to lay on the\nbunk...uh...and I used to reminisce the food we used to eat at home on the holidays. He used\nto tell me, \"Don't talk,\" he said, \"Don't waste...don't waste energy. Be quiet.\u201d And one day\nwhen we are laying on the...on the bunk...there were 3 or 4 bunks...laying second bunk, and\npeople had to urinate, make in their pants. It was...couldn't control theirselves. Somebody\nabove us urinated on top of us so the...the Polish kapo thought my father done it. So he\njumped on the bunk and started beating him unmercifully. So I jumped on my father to\nprotect him. So they broke a stick on me. At least being younger, I survived that you see.\nOtherwise, he would kill my father. So indirectly we kinda compliment each other.\nWe..we...our spirit. We talk with each, give each other __. (Crying) (Sigh) And...and as\nthe front again...the front came closer. The...uh...Germans are losing more and more ground.\nThey decide to move us...to move us to...uh...to Therenienstadt. In Therenienstadt they put\nus...Jjust put us in...uh...barracks or 1n...uh...officers quarters or soldiers quarters four...four\nfloors high, without food without anything. Nothing really. Nothing! They didn't feed us.\n(Sigh) I remember...I remember they came...also some different scenes seem to stick in my\nmind. When they came 1n there...we...we walked from...uh... Litomerice to Therenienstadt.\nWe walked and we came there...been hungry, thirsty. They assembled so many people\naltogether...most Jews...they throw...they throw bread in the air. Like a dog, you see. And\npeople grabbed and teared it apart. He said, \"Don't do that because you...you squeeze,\nthey're gonna kill you there. See? But..but as I was standing for far away and seeing how the\npeople like a...you take a bunch of hungry dogs and you throw a piece and they were\nclinging to each other, tearing each other apart. And the Germans laughing and having a\ngood time, enjoying themselves. May the 8th, we were liberated. Another day or two, my\nfather wouldn't have made. Never would have made it. He was...he was laying in bed.\nCouldn't move. A skeleton! I can see pictures. His skin was like a dead person. I...I still\nhave some walking power. And I couldn't believe it. I looked... was on fourth floor that\ntime. I looked through the window. I see a tank with a star...a Russian tank. And was all\naround. So I realized that's our liberation. I never knew how I'm going act liberation. But I\ncouldn't walk down the stairs. I slide myself down on my behind, all these stairs, because\nmy feet couldn't carry my body. And I crawled myself up to the tank. There was no\nGermans around it. And I...I kissed the feet of the...the Russian. He...for him it was also\nstrange. I mean...uh...he didn't see...he never saw people looking like we were. Dead people\ncrawling from all the halls out. He gave me oh a piece of bread or a piece of something. I...I\ntook it to my father. And I...we both ate and the crumbs together. And next day I know they\nopened the whole...uh... But they had a quar..quarantine because there was typhus period,\nyou see. Couldn't go any of them. But the Germans are walking in thousand and thousand\ncolumns so we grabbed some food from them and some something, whatever they had over\nthere. They were as weak as don't don't kill me. Don't do nothing. Just....Just here whatever\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nyou got. All...all of a sudden they became nice people. They walk in columns and columns\nand columns. I remember an incident. It's a laughing matter. I started getting my...my energy\nback already. My father was feel a little bit better already. I gave him...I brought him some\nfood, some chocolates from Germans over there. As I walked... walked in to the Germans,\ntake their food away or something, I was very thirsty so one German had a...a bottle\nof...field bottle. I said, \"Give to me. I'm thirsty.\u201d He said, \"No.\u201d I said, \"Give it to me.\u201d I\nmean give it to me. He's a big, 6 foot German. Here's a little...little Jewish prisoners, you\nknow, but I was liberated and he was right now, he would shoot you and run, you know. So\nhe gave it to me and I opened up and I looked, He had Volka, a hundred proof Volka. I\ncould stand that. I couldn't swallow this. But this...this is a...a thing that I...a comic thing\nthat happened you know. And...uh...we were...we were there quite about 2, 3 weeks. My\nfather got more to his energy, and...uh...they opened the _.. A lot of...the Russians...they\nactually didn't took care us much. They themselves didn't have it. But everything....they\nopened up all the...the places, all the warehouses with fruit and with white fruit, and prunes\nand all that. We had to have it. Also my father starts cutting the Russians hair too. They\ngave better meals. Because being a barber, you see, he had his trade right there. So we start\nboth coming to our energy. And we had accumulated two...two suitcases and some clothes\nfor ourselves, and...uh...one day we decided to go find our mother. How do you go back\nwhen the transportation...that for 2 weeks we were traveling on top of the trains. We\ncouldn't go inside because all...all filled up with Russian...with Russians going back home\nand with other ones. So many times...many times I wind up sleeping on the...kerosene\ntrains, the gasoline trains. They run once over there. Just keep on going towards...towards\nLithuania. And we...uh...we stopped on the way and we were tired, so one day we fell asleep\nand we woke up and the Russians stole our... whatever we had...the suitcases. Again we\nwere...we Start from ground zero until we came to...uh...to Lodz. In Lodz we got off and we\nsaid we'll try...rather than go back Lithuania, try to find here because they so few Jews on\nthe...maybe some Jewish people will know where Mother is. And sure enough we find\npeople who have...told us...uh...that she has died with the prayer on her lips we...on her lips\nwe should survive. She only...only begged we should survive. And...uh...they were with her\nall the way in the concentration camp, and she worked very hard and had typhus fever, and\nshe died. How she died and when she died and exactly the grave, we didn't know. And the\ndate we didn't know. And...uh...when I met after 40 years...I met...the lady's going to come\ntoday...Marsha. She...my mother died in her hand. She told me that. And...uh...after 40\nyears, we haven't seen each other in 40 years, and she told me that they're going...not a week\nbefore the liberation. They're going out on the appell to count, and she couldn't make it, and\nshe put her down. When she came back, she was dead already. At least, I know she died in\nMarch. At least I know that her soul is not floating empty and and every...every March I say\nkaddish in a for her soul. She was a good woman. And...uh...the only thing\nmy...my parents really left me was a good name, which I. There was no monuments. There\nwas no...no wealth, which I can give it to my children when I'm... I tried to raise my children\nthe same way to...to be (Sigh) good with people. After we find out my mother passed away\nin...in...uh...1n Lodz, wasn't any use to go to Lithuania. Wasn't nothing there any more. Just\n(sigh) dead family, so we decide to go back, join a kibbutz in...uh...1n Lodz. Uh... They...they\ntaught me that...how to handle ammunition whatever. One more thing I want to insert.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nWhen...when the Russians liberated Therenienstadt, they...uh...asked the people who was\nin...in Leitmeritz (Litomerice) early camp...they gave us all guns. They say, \"Go out and kill\nthe...the Germans. Kill anybody you want.\u201d I couldn't do that. I couldn't take revenge. I just\ncouldn't. Let God punish them. I don't....Why do I have to have blood on my hands?",

        "Q: Tell us about those trips, will you?",
        "A: Well, it was very dangerous trips. Was...there were a lot of old people and children. It was\ncold. Uh... You had to...uh ...walk through...by all the guards. It was not much food. We had\nsome rationed food from the UNRA gave us, the American ration food. And it was a\ndangerous...uh... dangerous mission to go across the mountains. And was cold. Sickness.\nWe had to cope with all that. And I done it...done it a number of times until the English\nhave found out...they saw my document over and over again and they...uh...they captured\nme. They beat me up, took away my papers, and they made me work over there close by, by\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe railroad. And one day I...uh...I said, \"That's...that's the end of it.\u201d I saw the train coming\nand the train leave and I jumped in there on the last train and I wind up in the American\nzone. And...uh...because it's actually was an English zone....the American zone\nwas...uh...not much to go by. And once I...uh...I went over I decided to settle down. Because\nthe funny part was even...it's very ironic. Even being in concentration camp, not having my\nschooling...after all I was 13 and a half years old, I was thinking when I...not if I survive,\nwhen I survive, \"What am I gonna do?\" I mean I didn't have no schooling. I didn't have no\nmoney. I need a trade. So the little trading I had in ghetto from __, I advanced it in\nLandsberg. Came...they had a trading school from the...from the __, and I learned auto\nmechanics, which gave me a...a nice start here in America. So...uh...at one point I was...also\nwhen I was in Landsberg, or to go to Israel...Palestine at that time, and I registered to go to\nAmerica. So the HIAS called me first with America. So when I came in the country, they\ngave me seven dollars on the ship. They dropped me off in New York, without a language,\nwithout nothing, without any relatives, without any...any body. And I felt pretty lonely.\nBecause at that point I still didn't know where my aunts lived. I didn't know where to turn.\nSo...uh...I bought me...I remember at that time, a candy bar, a Fifth Avenue candy bar, and a\nbig one. At that time they had big ones. I said, \"Well, seven dollars might go a long time.\u201d\nAnd...uh...I didn't like...care for New York because the by the __ trains and subways was\ntoo much for me....was everything happened to fast for me and...and...to...to be. So\nsomebody asked me to go to Washington...Washington, D.C. I didn't know Washington,\nCalifornia, I would go any place out of New York. So I wind up in Washington where\n[...uh...I...uh.... went to school here, night school, and I worked and I established my life. I\nmet my wife a year later. She's also a survivor from Belgium. Also went through Auschwitz\nand Birkenau. And we...uh...yesterday was actually 42 years married... anniversary. We\nhave a very successful marriage. We had the same common...common denominator. You\nsee we're both survivors, and we know each other. Though I'm from Lithuania, she's from\nBelgium but..uh...the common denominator is there you see. And we have three nice sons\nwith three grand...grandchildren, one the way, and I'm a happy guy. Really. (Sigh) And the\nfinal thing, I'd like to read something for you which I have outlined.

        "Q: Before you read, would you tell me...you had left your father in the DP camp. Bring him\nup...tell about him.",
        "A: Yai. I...I left my father in the DP camp and he married a...uh...a lady he knew when he was a\nchild. And she also lost her husband and two grown children. They also hid in a\nbunker..bunker and two weeks before liberation, the Lithuanians told on them and they were\nshot by Germans. So they also broke up...they also broke up people. All of us were broken\nup people. Just skeletons really. Tried to grow skin. Meat and skin on us. And...uh...it took\nme two years. After all, he wanted to be with me and I wanted to be with him. It took me\ntwo years to make paper for him. Secure him a job which had...the only one job he worked\nnext to the Pentagon. In fact when he...when he met so many important people there...when\nhe was going for the first citizen papers, Eisenhower private...private detectives were...were\nhis witnesses. Was well liked. And...uh...he worked all his life until he passed away here.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd he enjoyed life, and he gave me that...that instinct of life. He gave...I inherited it, the\njoy of life. And...uh...it's important to me, to my wife to make her happy. And\neverything...everybody...everything else around us are happy. And...uh...he died a happy\nman. It was a New Year's eve about 18 years ago. He was dancing in Beverly Hilton Hotel.\nIt thousand people around him. He had a massive heart attack. And...uh...being New Year's\neve and the ambulance couldn't come so fast and so they survived...they revived him, but he\nwas too late already. He lived other month or so and he passed away. And his...uh...his wife,\nmy stepmother, passed away a few years later. But he'll always have a big part in my heart. I\ngo often...very often to his grave, so my children go. At least I have a grave here for him\nwhere I can go. For good or for bad and...and pray and shed a tear, and talk to somebody. I\nthink that much God gave me. And I want to come to the few words I want to finish with\nthat.I don't know if they're appropriate or not, but...uh...I wrote down something on paper\nhere. Excuse me. The expression I ask myself many times. How can a whole nation\ncollectively turn away their faces from the wholesale murder of the Jewish people? It takes\neffort to look the other way. Perhaps if you learned the answer to that question, we can\nprevent such a tragedy from ever happening again, but I doubt it that we have learned. I\ndoubt it that we ever will learn. Because I came one day driving...flying from Israel back to\nAmerica and we stopped in Germany to refuel. Was in Munich. And the plane stopped and\nwe had to take a little shuttle bus to go to the station where...where to...inside the airport,\nand they came to us and start even that yelling, austeg, austeig, austeig_. My wife and I we\nturned and looked at each other and reminded us of the cattle cars. And this 1s\nvery, very hard emotion to take. And that's the reason I was present for the Holocaust\nsurvives here in Washington for a long time and the reason was we got to leave...we got to\nleave witnesses, which I am doing right now. The people should know that it did happen.\nMaybe if we couldn't prevent, maybe they can prevent. Maybe somebody can prevent.\nMaybe I can...I can leave a token of my experience to humanity.\nThank you.",

It was at night\ntime, and at 2 o'clock the first bomb was dropped in Kovno airport, and my...uh...whole life\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwas shattered. I mean we took 180 degrees turn. And fortunately enough my parents never\npampered me. And...uh...always said, although I maid, I always had to do thing myself in\nthe house, and this was a good thing because ...because when the war came, I...uh...I wasn't\nlost.

And\nit was... remember that...that night we went through a town and the whole trees are burning\nwhere the Germans throw incinerator bombs over there and we ran right through the fire\nand right through the misery.

But we were cut off. The\noffensive, German offensive was...was pretty fast and they cut us off and we had to return\nback home. We returned back home. Luckily in our...in our homes we met our aunts and\nuncles over there in our apartments and...uh...the Lithuanians didn't do nothing. All because\nthey...we...we treat them...my parents treat them prior to or we lucky they did not attack our\nhouses, but they killed during the week. During absence, absence. They killed at least about\n10,000...uh...Jewish people before the Germans came in. See, they...they were proud what\nthey have done, and they didn't kill just with machine guns or guns. They beheaded, they\nraped, they murdered, they robbed in the...I remember I went in a...after we came to the\nghetto, I came in a house where a friend of my...a friend of a schoolmate lived and they\nkilled...they raped her and her mother and they killed her father and with this blood the put a\nsign of the wall nemne kome (ph) take revenge. That was written down on the wall.\nNow...uh...when we came back and we were...uh...put together we had no right to go out\nnowhere. We were sitting 1n the...1n the house and waiting for further orders. The...the\nGermans came in and they started giving orders. The Lithuanians were very happy to fulfill\ntheir orders. They were actually the front man. You can...they called themselves the\npartisans. And they were taking people to the Seven Fort and Nine Fort. Any body they can\ngrab, they're killing. That's the LIthuanian. Beside the German before...before the Germans\nstarted giving out orders what to do, how to organize. Then after a month or two they\ndecided to have a ghetto, and the ghetto was made in...they call a little place called Slabotki.\nIt's right before Kovno. And...uh...in Slabotki was known to have...there was a\nterrific...uh...blood bath because the...there was a religious group of Rabbis and Hassidian\nand they....uh...they killed a lot of them. They tore their beards and they kill a lot of them.\nAnd this is a...a chapter which I...uh...I hated to speak about it.",
        "A: Uh...They...they pulled out the Rabbis from the apartment, from the learning house...the\n(ph) and they cut their beards off and they hung em and they cut their head off and the hair\nand they made em take a Sefer Torahs in the shul and the holy books and put em in piles in\nburn it. And then...then the Lithuanian partisans killed them right...right there and then.\nThey...uh...killed them and they throw them in in shallow graves next to the river all the\nNiemen or the Velier. There are two rivers over there. And...and after when they closed...in\nthe ghetto. And when the ghetto was established and the water...the water took away the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsand and they were exposed, so we had to take out all...take them all out from inside the\ngraves and rebury them. It was a...a terrible experience. And...uh...then they establish a\nghetto and I was...they grabbed people to make the fences. I was also one to make a fence.\nAnd we had to encircle ourselves in our own fence, and...uh...the (ph) and we were\ngathered together around 30,000. It was a small ghetto...was two ghettos in fact, a small\nghetto where they had a little hospital and they put the old people in the hospital, and then\nthere was a larger ghetto. It's one they decided to liquidate the hospital and liquidate the\ndoctors and just burn the whole thing up...the whole flame, and didn't let anybody to go and\nhelp them. We were standing outside watching how the sick people and the people are\nburn...are burning up...the whole ghetto. And we asked them questions. How come you\ndo...that you do that? There wasn't answers. We want to eliminate...we wanta liquidate as\nmany as we can they said. They give us all kind of excuses that from now on, we aren't\ngoing to do anymore. We ain't\u2019 gonna burn. We ain't gonna do... We put you all to work\nand...uh...you're gonna work. And then it was the 28th of October in 1942, they\nhad...uh...sent out some...uh...fliers that next day all the people should...should get together\nand they should assemble themselves in a place called the Democracy place. So I...and at\nthat time around 20, 29 people in the morning...they got together and\nthey...anybody...they're gonna find a house, they said they're gonna kill. They're gonna shoot\nthem to death. So we got up in the morning...6 in the morning and families, with all...with\nchildren and babies, everybody assembled themselves. 7 o'clock exactly. We didn't know\nwhat...what is gonna happen. We didn't know what's...because they told we just gonna count\nthem...count you out how many you are, and 1n the evening you're going back home. But 7\no'clock in the morning the...we were surrounded by the Lithuanian police, Lithuanian\npartisans and...uh...1n columns. We all stayed in columns. And German officers they were\nthere _ (ph) a people and they start sorting us. Right and left. We didn't have at that time an\nidea what's all about it. But we felt that something 1s wrong because all the older people and\nthe sick ones were going on side and the one who could...could still work was going on the\nother side. When it came to us, we were standing in line together, my father, my mother and\nmyself and my grandmother and my aunt, they were elderly. And because of them, he put us\nall in the bad side. We...my mother got very scared and she told my father, \"Maybe you can\nrun away. Get out.\u201d Because he work...worked in the fire department. He had a arm...arm\nband. And...uh...the police department, and also a arm band and at that time the Germans\ndidn't recognize if you're police or not police, so he...she pushed him out from the line as\nthey were taking us to the side for the sick people and she said, Maybe you can help us.\nMaybe you can...uh...you save our lives.\u201d And ...uh...the Lithuanians just pulled us away\nand with a...with the guns, they beat us up and they throw us in the other ghetto. You could\ncall a small ghetto which was all fenced up. In the evening there were accumulated about\n10,000 people in that...uh...small compound...small ghetto. What our destination we still\ndidn't know. We...we thought that maybe they're gonna give us other work. We never\nthought they're gonna kill us. After all 10,000 people. But the Germans had their own plans\nalready. They had all prepared. They had taken out the Jewish and Russian prisoners to\nNinth Fort and they dig...dug trenches. And then...uh...they...uh...put machine guns and then\nthey're going...there they they're gonna kill us and...and bury us. As we were\naccumulated...as we got assembled in that small ghetto (sigh) we didn't know...we were\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nconfused. We didn't know what happening. The people were crying. They were separating\nchildren from old people. We didn't know. My father wasn't here. I was just my mother. For\nsome reason, a instinct we should keep on moving further away and not to stay in the\nbeginning. All through the night...we shouldn't run away there...the LIthuanians were\nshooting in the sky with...with guns. It was like a battle zone in order for us...to keep us\nscared. Now in the middle of the night without our knowledge....we didn't know that, they\nstart pulling out people already, and putting them in..in trucks and taking them away. In\nour...our place was the going in the morning. We were in line to go in the morning. For\nsome reason or another I was...uh....told my mother, \"Let's ...let's stay back. Let's don't be in\na hurry. Maybe some day...maybe my father's going to help us. Something 1s going to\nhappen.\u201d And...uh...as we...was already 12 o'clock, and we were less than 100 people and\neverybody was taken away to the ninth fort to be short. We were staying and there was a\nlady standing in front of us and the German officer recognized her. She worked for him.\nAnd she was with a baby, and he pulled her out from the line and dragged her out. As he\ndragged her out on the good side, so called, so-called, the ___ (ph) it was...my father\nhappened to be there. My father...because he all night long, he tried to come...begged\npeople, begged the Germans to help...to...to save...you know, he said, that's my wife and my\nchild is there. He didn't talk anymore about my grandmother or my aunt or his sisters were\nthere because they're older you see. Because of them we also got lined up on..the bad side.\nSo as she was pulled out he...he fell on his knees and he...uh...and that woman happened to\nrecognize my father. She said, \"Your wife and son is still there.\u201d And he start begging the\nGerman and there was next to him sitting...standing the chief of police, a Jewish chief of\npolice, and he also start begging the German. \"He's a good man. I know him,\" he said,\n\"Help him.\u201d He said, \"Come.\u201d And here, all of a sudden, as I stay in line with my...my\ngrandmother and my aunt and myself, my mother and myself, I hear a scream, \"You're\nhusband's __ (ph). Your husband's running.\u201d I...like a wild man, I...I...1 jumped out. I was\nonly a child, 14 or so. I saw my father. It like a Messiah is coming. I had a feeling that...I\ndon't know what...what is going to happen to us, but the feeling was there that something 1s\ngoing to happen to us. And the German looked at me, at my father and we looked\nalike...facial expression. He said...and my father was running like a wild man...he's eyes and\nhis hair. I still remember the...the way he looked. And I jumped on him. I said, \"Papa.\u201d The\nGerman said, \"Is this your son?\" He said, \"Yes. \"Whom else do you have here?\" He said,\n\"My wife.\u201d \"Take your wife and come on.\u201d And as we walked out people were screaming,\n\"Take my child.\u201d They take the last hundred and took them away to be killed. And it took\nus...he saved our life and that... this was a scene I'll never forget. And they...they took the\npeople on the ninth fort...they were...they put in bunkers and heard at that time told...they\nstripped until the underwear and they walked out a hundred at a time they were machine\ngunned for 3 days and then they covered them up with dirt. For 3 days the graves were\nmoving up and down. They took tractors and run over the graves in order to squeeze out the\nlast breath. And when the front came closer and the Germans did not want to leave no\nevidence, they undug the graves and they found mother with children hugged together by\ndying and with parents, grandmothers. They saw people together. And they burned them all\noff. We could see from the ghetto. Wasn't far from the ghetto. We could see the flames all\nthe way to the sky. We still didn't know what it was until people escaped from there. There\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwere Jewish people and the...and the Jewish prisoners and the Germans and the Lithuanians\ntold them to undig them all. And while they were undigging them they told them to take out\nall the gold from their teeth and...and put it for the Germans...to save them. They also they\nthemselves stole the gold and before New Year's Eve...It was in 40..43, before they go finish\nthe burning, they have bought for...for...for the guards the gold...it was a whiskey.\nAnd...uh...New Year's eve or Christmas eve, they made them all drunk. And being winter\nand being white...they took white sheets and they escaped that way. They all 200 escaped\nfrom nineth fort. It was a...1t was a tremendous thing what they have done. And they..they\ndelivered the witnesses. They were there by the killing and they were there by them digging\nand burning the Jews...the people up. And they saw what the Lithuanians had done. There\nwere very few Germans. Actually the whole thing was done by Lithuanians. They were\nGermans were just guiding the whole operation. And they were the witnesses which\nescaped from them. It was a tremendous..uh...the German hierarchy was tremendous upset.\nThey looked all over for them, but some...naturally, some didn't get...they hide in ghetto.\nThey caught couple of them, but most of them escaped. After that tragedy, we still did not\nknow what happened to 10,000. From 10,000 just myself, my mother was survived, and my\nfather. And the rest went in...that lady, which we still didn't know who she was. She\nrecognized...she knew my father. The ghetto was chaotic. It was...uh...unbelievable. People\ndidn't care to work. They didn't care to...to do anything. After all, the ghetto cut almost in\nhalf and every family had somebody taken away.",
        "A: I went back to the ghetto. Yal. Back to the ghetto and back to the room where we were in\nbarracks over there. And the life quote unquote become normal.",
        "A: Okay. As...uh...as we were in the ghetto...you know, the ghetto had own police department,\nfire department, had a Jewish community committee and...uh...they had an order for...the\nGermans also wanted the ghetto...ghetto to...to exist because the hierarchy for the Germans\ndidn't want to go to the Russian front. So things are...starting getting better on the Russian\nfront. They thought they going with the Blitzkrieg. They going in...in 2 weeks, they go and\nkill the Russians. The war was over. I remember one...one thing a...a...a German told my\nfather as we running there. We were caught between the Germans and the Russians on the\nfront and the Russian dug in all the...bunch of young kids. I remember then. They told us\nkeep on going because the front is going to be...after the 24 hours they shouldn't know each\nother. And they held out actually the whole German army. Young boy...German officer told\nmy father. Hitler said 2 weeks going to be Blitz. The war be over. In 2 years if the Russian\nfight that way, 2 more years the war won't be over. He said this the first day or the second\nwar started. They didn't realize because the whole Europe, they took very easy. You see,\nFrance and Belgium and Holland, but here they...they were getting very resistance, you see.\nSo the German himself had an interest in the Kovno ghetto operation because it killed the\npeople from the small towns, a kill with nothing left over there. In the ghetto, they...they\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nestablished that as their...their place. They...they had a Jewish people working for them like\nthe Judenrat and...uh...they tried to establish something good for us and good for them.\nMostly for them. But they had...they need us too in order to control their destiny for awhile\nthey need us too. The front was still away. There is still a successful. So I...uh...I had a job\nyouth organization for small children got a job to teach us a trade. And I worked a little bit\nover there. Then they made a brigade to go to air...air...airport for small children or for small\nchildren to go to work in fields. Now the older people they...they promised they ain't going\nto do more less things you had to assemble all 10,000 someplace else and they...uh...still\nwas trying to fool us. They were very smart and they knew how to psychologically. They set\nup a special office to fool us psychologically. They were very, very (ph). And we...we\nhad to believe them. In order to survive we had to believe them. Help we didn't get from\nnobody. Escape from the ghetto we couldn't...we couldn't do. If we escape, a Lithuanian saw\nus and you were a Jew, he told the Germans on us. Help was not coming. We couldn't create\nand get a partisan groups because we did not have enough woods like in Poland, like in\nRussia to escape. And..uh...the Lithuanian population had no interest in helping us. They\nwere happy. In fact, we were a burden to them. We took away their place and their homes.\nThey took away everything we had was okay. But we're living in their homes in small\nshacks over in the ghetto in...uh...Slobotka, it was no good. Pressure on...they put pressure\non the German government to...uh...to get us out. They didn't care how they get us out or\nkill us or whatever, you see. Now...uh...after they start creating the brigades and they told\neverybody that...uh...things will be better. They gave us enough food...and they gave us for\nawhile enough food in ghetto in order to calm our nerves we should start believing them. It\nwas all done psychologically. And it worked.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\njob. And this kept me...kept me alive...kept me out from doing hard work. Uh...Being still\nyoung, he wanta kept me around him. Then they organized, as the war progressed and as the\nwar got worse, the German...we got involved in...uh...1n the cold weather.... the\nwashing...we got bogged down there. They needed fur coats. They needed shoes. They\nneeded gold. So they had one time a...uh...flier out on the wall...All the fliers came on\nthe...on the walls by the Jewish community committee that next week in 3 days, all the Jews\ngot to bring in their gold and their furs and their leather boots, everything. They start\nbringing 1n their leather coats, leather coats, the boots, but gold was not coming in.\nSo...uh...the Germans had a remedy for that. For a week, they walked around the ghetto and\nthey was killing people on sight. The SS brigade came in. Every morning 8 o'clock, 9\no'clock and everyone 1n sight they killed, like dogs. And after a week, they said, \"If you\ndon't bring back...We'll do...we'll stop it only if you bring back all the gold.\u201d\nAnd...uh...this...uh...they shook everybody up and...uh... naturally, everybody brought...in\norder to stay alive, in order to continue with their life, they brought all the gold they've taken\nout the most fur and gold from the Kovno ghetto than other all the ghettos together. And\nthey said, again after...after you bring us the gold, again everything will be nice and fine.\nDon't worry about it. It's fine. How can...but meanwhile they organized...they took out five\nintellectuals they needed intelectuals to drive them from ghetto, scholars, teachers they\nneeded them for a special job to go in Latvia. And sure enough people ... they trust .. so\nhow can they trust? We were so...we became so minimized our life...like they\nde...degenerated you see. They made for us...uh...a resistance of culture, a resistance of\nbeing a humanbeing became so nil...became like...like animals. And this was their intention\nto minimize. They took five hundred of our people, registered the best, the most\nintellectuals and we never saw from them anymore. We still goal...this were the aktion\n..aktion from the 500. Then they created a brigade...a workshop...in ghetto workshop where\nthey...we produced like toys for the Germans, wooden toys and...uh..dolls. Uh...Also, we\nwashed all the clothes came from the front, the bloody clothes and everything. We washed\nover there, and we sewed them up. We made a shoe factory to...uh...repair the old shoes\nfrom the front. Many times became frozen. We pulled off ...we pulled off the...uh...many\ntimes you find skin and blood in the shoes and the boots. We washed them out over there.\nThey had...there were 500 people working over. I was also fortunate to work there too and I\nwas also working there in ...uh...as a runner. And I was working as a runner and also I was\nworking as...uh...learning a trade as a...uh...smith, making different things from iron. And\nthis kept me...kept me going in order not to go out from ghetto, not to get out and...uh...be\nworked day and night over there and use up my strength something else. You see, again, I\nhave to thank my father for...for help me doing that. And then at one...uh... one day, it\npreviously...as....uh...I got a call to come in...in the office from the big boss from\nthe...uh...from the ghetto workshop over there...in the office over there. And there was\nsitting Gecke. Gecke was Oberstrumbannfuhrer Gecke. I mean I looked at him...he...his\nhead was like a...he was like the SS Obersturbanfuhrer sure. He was...the top man from the\nSS. He was taking care of the whole eastern coast...shore...eastern coast, all the east ghettos,\nand the lager and the concentration camps and all that. In fact, I found out later, he was one\nof the 15 people involved with Hitler when they...when they decided to...uh...to make unify,\nto make eliminate the Jews. He was one the few people. His eyes just penetrate me. I was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nstanding there looking at him, and his head was like a dead head....like...like a skeleton. He\nwas...uh...he asked me to take some papers to the Jewish committee. And if they give me\npapers, the boss from the Jewish ___ (ph) over there in charge, told me to take off tomorrow\ncause it's late already and don't come 1n to work tomorrow. This was...uh... that...this was\nnot the best thing for me, but because next day as I got up in the morning I heard speakers,\nloud speakers, going around the ghetto with...uh...the bull horns, and they tell everybody\nwhose not going to work, whose not at the work to accumulate to go and assemble\nthemselves on that place where...from where they have sorted people out. The memory still\nlingers with me at that time. I did not know what to do. I was sure...I sure wasn't going\nto...to go again over there. I didn't know what's gonna happen. The ghetto was already\nsurrounded with Lithuanians, the partisans they called. Uh...The people have went to work.\nAll the brigades were gone already because they go 7 o'clock...6, 7 o'clock over there the\nwhole ghetto's out. Whoever is left in the ghetto I didn't know what's gonna happen. I\ngot...uh...1 went and hide in the room right away and start try to find a place to hide. It's like\na...uh...a rat looking for some place to hide. I didn't...I didn't know where to go, and I didn't\nknow where they find us. I saw a little shed. You see the ghetto was made in a...where\nfarmers used to live...farmer country. There was a shed like a...not a out house, a shed with\na cellar inside where they keep hay. It's a little barn, a small barn. So I opened the barn and I\nsaw through a...a trap door in the bottom. So I pushed away the hay in the side and as I was\ntrying to go inside two mothers with little babies came to me and said, \"Please help me.\nPlease help us.\u201d I said, \"What are you doing. I know...I know what I'm doing.\u201d They said,\n\"Please let me go in with you in that...in that basement...in that hole. It was not basement,\nwas a hole with a cellar they dug out.\u201d I said, \"Come down.\u201d I didn't care. And I put hay on\nthe trap...on the trap and...uh...I just went down. And it was dark, but I could see through\nthat crack in the door, in that little...uh...trap door. (cough) Exactly 8, 9 o'clock, I don't\nknow exactly when, the Germans came, the police and...uh...they start banging houses, raus,\nraus, raus, Juden raus. I didn't know what was going on. And he opened...the German\nopened the door, flinged the door wide open and he comes in and he starts feet...starts\nshaking around all that...that...uh...hay, straw and he's standing on top of that door. And\n[...I'm...the door is almost collapse, and I'm trying to hold up the door shouldn't collapse\nover there. And I say, \"God, help me.\u201d I mean why...what can I do? And...uh...he looked\naround and looked around and took...took his bayonet...I could see all that...and shoveled\naround in all that hay and he walked out. But he didn't walk...he was like a post. He was\nwalking back and forth. As soon he walked out, one baby start to cry. So I said, \"Please.\nPlease. Help us. Help us.\u201d So, she stopped. The baby stopped crying. And...uh...I know if he\ndidn't grey and he didn't have a heart attack. I was only 15 years old, 15 and a half years old,\nand I could see the German all day long going back and forth. And the other baby start\ncrying. So the mother urinate in her hand and the baby to drink, you know, to keep quiet.\nExactly again they came in and look but didn't...didn't step no more on that... was ready to\nhold up again. He didn't...just looked outside in. Other guard came and they joked and\nthey...they...they had a good time going back and forth. And...uh...exactly 4, 5 o'clock the\nwhistle blew. Every...everything was done exactly perfect. And...uh...A...uh...a German\ntruck picked them all up, all the post over there. And I made sure and seen them off and\nwalked to the first and looked around. I told the mothers came out. And one baby was died.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nShe...the mother... the mother choked her own baby. And this left a tremendous impression\non me because now (ph) I saw her and my grandfather. And one baby 1s still alive\nbecause the mother she urine and she get a drink but the other baby from...from fear, the\nmother choked her own baby, choked her own child...choked her own child. I didn't see\nthem anymore because the Germans did not finish the job that day. The next day they came\nagain. This is called the kinder aktion. They had picked up all the...as the parents when they\nwent to work, the children are left. Some parents was left their children. Some grandparents\nwas left their children because that...everybody went to work on the air port or\nwhatever...the brigades. So they...they were going around with dogs and finding little babies\nand children and 5 year old. I didn't know what happened that time. The whole thing\nhappened in front of my father where he had the fire department over there by the Jewish\ncommittee. They came in buses, and they line the buses in Germans. And as they assembled\nthe children they thrown the in...in the buses. So if a mother would not part the child....she\nwanted to be with her child...they sicced...a German dog was trained so, to jump on the\nmother's face and bite his face so the mother dropped the child. They grabbed and brought\nher child in...in the bus. They didn't care for the...for thee parents. They want only the\nchildren. And...uh...next day, naturally I went to work and...uh...next day by the same thing,\nthey...whatever left children one day, they picked it up next day. When the parents came\nfrom...from work at night, (Pause) it was...it was hard to describe what...what\nhappened...what happened there. (Pause) They came from work. (Pause) And you\nfind...you find children. So they...they picked up the pillows and blankets (Pause) (Sigh) and\nthey ran around in ghettos screaming (Pause) (Sigh) (crying) and pulled their hair. I saw\na...a woman came up to one of the Germans and the guard somebody by the fence and start\nscreaming at him and and calling him swine. He took out a gun and killed her. A...a Jewish\nlife didn't mean nothing. They had no...they had no...uh...I don't know what kind of people\nthey are. I mean I saw a German...a young man came in ghetto, played with a little poodle,\nlittle tiny dog, puppy. He played with him. He gave him chocolate. He finished playing,\ntook out a gun and killed him. I mean it's unbelievable. And as you live all this through,\nsmall incidents, which are not written up in the books...just right here, it's...uh...you just\ncan't believe. You can't believe it how people can be that cruel. (Sigh) After that,\nthank...thank God, I was still with my parents, my mother and father at that time.\nBut...uh...for the rest of the people life became really nothing. No...No...1t wasn't worth\nliving, but people have children. People have families. People have the grandparents and\ngrandparents...grandmother...grandparents and uncles and aunts...they were all annihilate\ntaken away. We were...you became...we became nothing. We became like zombies. But\nhow little did we know that the future is still going to be worse. Uh...My all...only luck they\nsay...1 was that time maybe 15 or so, and I could still be...come every night with my parents.\nMy father protected us, my mother and me as much he could, but this also\nlimitation...limitations. Because the...uh...Russian front came closer and closer. They lost\nthe Stalingrad. And...uh...that I'm also...became heyday for 24 hours or 48 hours. You can\ngo go around and get and kill all the Jews. You want them and just get out and take out\nanger on Jews. So they lost the Stalingrad and we suffer. They want we suffer. So we were\nlike a pawn...you know, like a...like a nothing. And it became closer and we heard news\nthat...uh...they're losing everywhere because we got more and more wounded soldiers\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncoming back from the front and people...people worked in the unclothing means where\nthey were...1n Kovno was that a point where they stop and they clean them up before send to\nGermany. And the people, the Jewish peopled them undressed, helped them to clean up\nbodies, and helped them in the shoes and in the uniforms came in ghettos to be washed.\nAnd...uh...and the mood from the soldiers where they were cursing and, you know, the\nGerman government. They were cusring Hitler, but still there was not a big spark to...to get\nhim to make a new government or to kill him or something. But nothing that even get\nreunited, but they're too afraid of doing something like that. So we knew that if they having\nproblems on the front...we knew the front is getting closer. And...uh...Gecke came, the\nOberstrumbammfuhrer...Gecke came and he told the...uh...the Judenrat...Jew...the Jewish\nleaders, \"Don't worry. We...uh...we won't annihilate you. You'll still...they figure back in\nGermany, you work for us. They have factories over there. But...uh...we still did not know\nthe concentration camp. We still doesn't...didn't know. We didn't have the connection.\nUh...Some people did, but...but we did not know...the ghetto itself didn't know that there\nwas concentration camp. We thought we the only ones survived. We...we didn't have the\ncommunication. We didn't know the Warsaw ghetto. We didn't know the uprising. We were\ncompletely isolated. We were...we thought we only ones survives. Until they start\nliquidating the liquidating the ghetto. And they start...they say in the ghetto, \"We're going to\nliquidate on that and that day because the...uh...we knew...we knew the reason why they\nwant to...and evidence when the Russians are coming closer, want burn everything up. But\nnaturally we want to save ourselves. We start hiding. So the...the first transport, they got\ntogether as many they could and...uh...and they couldn't find them all. The brought in a\nspecial...uh... trained people, killers....special killers to find the find the people who were\nhiding. We were...my father and me, my mother, we're trying to find a place to hide. But\nwhere can you hide? I mean the...1n basement you can't go and hide in the attic you can't go.\nYou might...we knew they're going to destroy all the houses so we saw outside a outhouse\nand we saw people like going in there. Somebody built a bunker. So we said, \"Please, let us\nalso in.\u201d They were nice enough to let us come in there too. So it was a big...uh...big room\nand on top was a camouflage outhouse. People didn't know there was a room downstairs.\nAnd people used the outhouse. And we were downstairs. So...uh...now it was....but to save\nyour life, you do everything. There are no end. (Sigh) And the Germans found us. Next day\nthey're looking with dogs and they...they came. I see a German SS man and he ripped apart\nthe bunker with a luger in his hands and \"Come out, Juden fechstunke (ph) Juden.\u201d You\nsmell of Jews. If you don't come out, we'll...we'll kill you. Sure enough, we came out. We\nall came out and...uh...they assembled, you know, from the other bunkers, they assembled\npeople and....uh...we looked and we smelled all of us....maybe they had over there, maybe\n500 or so. We're last transport they sent to Dachau. After us, they burned the whole ghetto\ndown. We were the last ones. And...uh...we sit together and it was a terrible day. It was\nrainy, and we were sitting in front of the Jewish Committee. The people discussed the...the\nfuture and...uh...was a parallel thing happened which I still remember. There was a small cat\nran through. And the German SS sicced his dog on the cat, and the poor cat was all pulled\nout...going, trying to get away from him, going move toward the fence. And she was...when\nshe was close to the fence, he say...he told him, \"Give a command to kill her, and he jumped\nand killed her.\u201d And this was so parallel to our lives. We are in their hand. They're the dog,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand we're the cat, and we're at their mercy. Whenever...whenever they want to kill us, they\nkill like that. And that small, little incident, is so engraved in my brain that...and it was\nall...it was like a play. The weather was bad, was windy, was cold, and the whole\natmosphere was right there. Next morning they assembled us all, and we walked all the way\nto the railroad. They put us in as much as they could...as many as they could in the freight\ncars, without much air, locked us up and we're on our way Germany. Where we...we\nwent...we were going, we didn't know.",
        "A: As we were riding and...uh...and we're cramped together and packed together without place\nto urinate or toilet. Nothing. Was not...and no water, no bread, no nothing. Some young\nguys...myself and few others decide...decide...decide to escape. So...uh...the German\nwas...was in front, sitting with the driver...driving over. During the day he was sitting in\nfront...the front door. In the back, I took a...I took out a knife and I tried with the back door\ncut a hole. And there was a...uh...a seal there on...on the lock. I cut my arm. It went right\nthrough my arm. I got a mark here still here. And it was bleeding all over. But this...and\nonce we opened the door, and I put my small hand...I put my hand 1n there, I cut a seal,\nbroke a seal, unlocked the latch, and there was no way to...to jump because they specially\npicked out a double line all the way to Germany. They were a line...we were on one track\nand the other track was going and the Germans were going right behind us...in case the\nGerman get killed. So we closed back up and this was a adventure of trying to jump out\nfrom the train. But my cousin, I found out later did jump and his wife...a train...the first\ntransport. And...uh...they did make it. But the Lithuanians gave them...uh...told on them.\nThey were killed later. These our friends...these are people we lived all our life\ntogether...were in school together and the business together and when...uh...when the war\ncame, they kill us, as many as they could. (Sigh) Our first stop I remember was some place\nin Germany. We saw...the reason I knew it was in Germany over the border because I could\nread sign. The wheels are...are turning for the future on the trains. for\nthe...uh...Zieg means...uh...When they win a war...when they win a way, the wheels are\nturning for to win the war. So I knew we were in Germany then. The train stopped the next\nday. A German soldier came up to me...I'll never forget it...with a paper in black letters\nwritten down. And if this is said would be true, would happen, we be free right now. They\nmissed...Hitler was being...they....uh...they tried to kill Hitler, and Hitler survived. In big\nletters. This is our luck. So...uh...they gave us some water. I remember that time. And again\nthey shipped us off. They shipped us off to Stutthof. At that point I was still with my\nparents, mother and father. In Stutthof...",
        "A: Thank you very much.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nTAPE #2",
        "A: Here...we arrived...the train. We still didn't know where where it was. And all of a sudden\nthe trains opened up...the cattle cars...wasn't a train....the cattle cars 1t was. And...uh...some\ndead people...some fainted people, and a few survivors who made it...the younger ones\ncame out. We assembled ourselves and the screaming from the Germans\n__.I...1 can still hear in my...my head...also.... the _raus, raus, Jude_. And they put us all in\nthe...in the trucks and they brought us 1n...and they took us in a gorgeous, beautiful runway\nwith trees, with a lake with...with swans on the lake. I said, \"Where are we here?\" Are they\ngoing to give you...gonna give us the work here or what...what's happening. Little did I\nknow, that's the worst hell hole. And as we assembled ourselves in a big room, in a bigger\nhall with...uh...and people had to go to the bathroom. They were special place...altogether\nwoman and men, they didn't care for the toilets. People went on too them, and they were\nstanding up and there were filled up with human waste. Two...two Germans tried to amuse\nthemselves. They start laughing. They took the end of their...uh...guns, rifles butts, and they\nhit two men in the head and they fell in...1n the human waste. And they were laid there\ndrowning. They drowned over there. And they were laughing. They had a good time. I...all\nthese things I wasn't used to that at that point. This 1s...completely different thing. And at\nthat time in that place, I lost my mother. I...I was separated from my mother. I saw her the\nlast time. They...she kissed me. I kissed her. And she asked my father to take care of me.\nAnd we hugged. The last time I ever saw her. They took at night to the...all the men...they\ntook us to the...unclothing...they took us to the...uh...the place where they kept us all night\nlong, all naked. Take all the clothes off, and we had to go in a...in a unclothing place which\nthey shaved us, the hair, whatever, and...uh...we washed. They gave us some clothes and\nclothes...1t was whatever...whatever we grabbed. Anything. Different shoes and\ndifferent....uh...jackets and different ...not a different...uh...different hat, but anyway, luckily\nwe were not sent in the crematorium. We all assembled...and I was standing with my\nfather...and next morning they sort us out...the Stutthof. They kept us a few days over there,\nprobably a week or two weeks I would say. And they...uh...they beat us up good. I start to\nfeeling what it means already being 1n a concentration camp cause the atmosphere change\neverything and they...uh...they separate the young...young kids from their parents or from\nthe other ones. They send them away. Luckily I was still at that point with my\nfather...uh...because I was...and when the German came in and followed me, I got up and\nextended my...I was tall and skinny and they let me go with my father. And they shipped us\nall to Dachau from there. And there was special...uh...camp because Dachau in camp 2.\nIn...uh...1n camp 2 they are a brand new camp. Brand new barracks and brand ....brand\nnew....the Germans and the whole thing and there was only one Lithuanian from Kovno.\nEveryone knows him which...uh...he was wearing German uniform. And he was officer\nthere, and he was the worst one. He was beating on us. He was the worst one. Again, my\nfather, being a barber, got a job working inside the camp, not to go outside. In the beginning\nI was working outside. It was a night shift, and day shift. And it was very miserable.\nThey....they are building there...it was a place build...factory for Messerschmitt...for the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nGerman...uh...more in the inland, underground factory. They had slave labors and we were\nbuilding that. That's our job. And...uh...at that place I didn't have it too bad because after\nawhile working outside, I was working inside the camp itself. My job was....as they\nprogressed...as the camp continued, people start dying off from diarrhea, malnutrition. It\nreally was very bad. It was...people were working in mud...have...up to their knees because\nthe rain was very...very...red mud over there. It was terrible place to be. But...uh...my job\nwas every morning when the lice came in...people had to be full of lice and they died. Every\nmorning I had a little cart. It was a good job. Go from barrack to barrack and pick up the\ndead people. And me and the other young boy...we used to go on from barrack to barrack\nand pick all the dead people. And me and the other young boy, we used to go on from\nbarrack to barrack and every morning take em like a rickshaw and...uh...in... both...dump em\non top of the...on top of that little wagon until they accumulate. Go out with this. Dump\nthem outside again. Do the same thing again. It's a job for the day. I was very lucky by doing\nthat because I was in camp. I didn't have to go...and I had some little more soup or more\ncoffee or more hot tea or hot water rather. And one day I come to that pile of people and\n[...uh...I saw a person laying there which...it was still breathing. He opened his eyes and he\nsaid, \"Don't you recognize me?\" He was one of my father's friends. He worked also in\nghetto as a fire...in fire department, which I knew him like I knew my father. I look at him.\nHe was still of flies. His whole body was full white...I did not...I put him on aside. I\ncouldn't do nothing about it. We didn't put him on the truck...on this truck...on this little\nhand cart. But the thing was that the lice took over the camp so dramatically and diarrhea\nand diphtheria that people are dying in masses and nothing you can do about it. They\nde...decide then to liquidate after about 4 months to liquidate the camp altogether. And they\nwere going to send my father...you see, they...they weren't interested to have families\ntogether. They want to send separate...father and son separate, brothers separate. Though\nthey liked my father. They wanted to send him in a better place and send me out to\nCzechoslovakia in a different camp. They accumulate about 500 people to send to\nCzechoslovakia to Therentenstadt...no to...uh...Flossenburg and...uh...my father said, \"No. I\nwon't go without my son. I helped him so far. I want to help him further.\u201d And it\nwas...uh...it was my luck really that we went with me. It was almost his undoing, because he\ncould have had a better place going in other camp in Germany. We were shipped away\nin..in...uh...Flossenburg. From there to Leitmeritz (Litomerice). Leitmeritz (Litomerice) was\na...Leitmeritz (Litomerice)yelling was a place from Flossenburg, other part. And there was a\nhell hole. There was a worst we ever...ever saw. From the 500 or so people, maybe 10\nsurvived. First of all, it was old camp already. And the Pollacks were in charge of the camp\nand...uh...we worked over there in mines in...uh...cement mines. And naturally the better\njobs is taken already, being an old camp. So they...uh...they all got new\n. [mean we got some new people. And they came...they grabbed us next day and they put us\nin all kind of jobs...work. We are working 1n the...1n the coal...it's like coal mine. It's the\nsame thing. It's miserable inside. It's wet. It's...uh...muggy. It's...uh...fog all the time...little\nsmall lamps and you gotta drill, with a big drill you gotta drill the...the cement mines. It's all\ncement in Czechoslovakia. I...uh...l was working luckily with my father and the bread\nwas...the ration was terrible. You get less and less....one slice of bread and...uh...we had to\nget up...get up early in the morning. It was cold...was...uh...maybe 20, 30 below zero. We\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhad no shoes. We had wooden...uh...wooden shoes. And the wooden shoes, when you go in\nthe snow, they became like...uh...like ice skates so you could hardly walk. You had...uh...the\nuniform...one a pajama. You had to stand in a appell in the morning for 2 hours. Woke you\nup 6 in the morning, 5 in the morning 1n order to count you...they count you. They count\nyou out. If someone is missing, they had to count again. And...uh...1t was miserable. Was\njust...and people start dying off dying off. One day I standing with my father over\nthere...comes to me...there was over there...also over there besides Pollacks, besides Jews,\nall the Germans...criminals, homosexuals, whatever. I didn't know about that. I...I wasn't\nthat...that...that known what's going on in the concentration camps. I was still new about\nthat. As I stand by my father and worked, a German comes up to me and he orders me to go\nwith him. He was a...uh...a colonel from the...uh...from the air force. I didn't want to go, but\nhe says, I have to go with you. I was still...we just came up from new\ncamp....from...from Dachau. I still did not look so dilapidated and so worn out. I still looked\npretty good because I had a clean uniform. He tells me...as we go deeper...he takes me\ndeeper and deeper and he see nobody one here...just fog with little lamps burning and the\nrailroad trellis because the little railroads where they bring out the...all the cement over\nthere. He started hugging me. I started moving away. He said, \"Hug me.\u201d And he...uh...he\nwanted to kiss me. I started pushing him away. I didn't know...I was all...I was all confused.\nI didn't know what happening. And he un...he unzipped his ...uh...pants. I start screaming.\nAs I start screaming, people...uh...kapos from other brigades over there, the Polish kapos,\nstart running. And I...uh...start telling you...what happening. As I telling him the story, they\ncalled right away a SS guard and...uh...bayonets, they guy took us down in the headquarters.\nHere my father...he works over there by the cement...that big machine. He cutting cement.\nHe sees they're taking me with the guard away over there and I can't tell him nothing. He\nlooks at me. We look each other. I had...they took us in a general staff over there. I had to\ntell the story what happened over and over gain. They took a petition from me about 20\ntimes. They came over, \"How did a...a German officer try to kiss a Jew?\" That was the\nmost...uh...[...[ told them the whole story. I told them A to Z. He pulls his pants off and I\nstart screaming. So then was tremendous thing for the Germans over there. The Germans\nSS. They telegraphed to Berlin. They came to Berlin, people coming down there....coming\ndown. I had to tell the story. And they kept me completely isolated. Him and me,\ncompletely isolated. I thought that's my end. I'm finished. In the middle of the night...they\ncalled me down one night. They called me down....12 o'clock, 1 o'clock in the morning.\nAnd they took me down in unclothing. There where the...uh...showers are. He stand\nundressed...the German officer, colonel, and Germans and Pollacks beating him with cold\nwater and I had to watch how they were beating him. By the time he got through his head\nwas twice the size it was. And I...they...the more officers standing around me. I had to tell\nthem the whole story. And he was yelling mutter, help . Mother, help me. You\nsee. His head got so big his head used to . Fit right on top here. I find out\n2 days later he died from the beating. But the tragedy was they made me watch him being\ndestroyed. And I...I'm a young kid. I mean how...how can I cope with that? But I did.\nMy...my...the lucky thing was they did nothing to be me. They tell me to go back to my\nfather after that. Actually, this was a miracle. It was a miracle from God. Because see, they\ndidn't prove that I participate in anything, you see. And here...he said not...and I totally (ph).\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nHe hugged me and he kissed me in the face, and I start screaming afterwards. I went back to\nwork. (Sigh) And the one...and we got weaker and weaker and weaker because the food\nwasn't there. They tried to cut the portions less and less because...the Pollacks got bigger\nportions. And the Jews got almost nothing, and a kapo was a Pollack. So one day, we are\ncarrying cement. I mean bag cement, I could hardly walk myself. I fall down. I can't carry.\nThe German said...he was...was not German...a Polish German. He lived in Poland. He said,\n\"I'm going to kill you today.\u201d I said, \"Why\" He says, \"I'm gonna kill you.\u201d And as I picked\nup a bag...a barrel...a bag cement and walked, he knocked me down and jumped on he and\nwith his heel, hit my face and my nose and my teeth. And he let me lay there like...like I was\ndead...like blood...a piece of meat...raw meat. My father standing next to me. He could do\nnothing. And the end of the day I was laying there. End of the day, my father picked me up\nwith the other kapo, Jewish haftling, there or prisoner, whatever you call them...they\nwere...were called. And I started getting fever. I didn't know what it was. I started getting\nfever and it took me down to the...to the so-called hospital. When they call it hospital, and\nmy father left me there. He didn't see me...see anymore. And in a time he came in and\nasked, \"What happened to my son?\" They told him, \"Your son is long dead.\u201d But he never\ngave up hope. I knew while...they told me it type of fever. They threw me in a small little\narmy cot with...uh...three more...four or five Russian prisoners. They were actually\nRussians.... Russians...everything was there in the concentration camp. (Clearing throat) As\nthey start dying off. You imagine the cart is so small, and we were all laying there. As they\nwere starting...and they wouldn't give me no water and they wouldn't give me nothing. They\ndid give me a bunch of aspirins in my hand, and they told me swallow them. But I chewed\nup...how you...you can't hardly chew one aspirin. So I almost choked myself, but\n[...I...maybe it helped me. Maybe it survived me. I don't know. But a hand...handful of\naspirin I swallowed or I chewed it up. And I was laying with the guys on the cot. And four\nguys...four big guys, and they started dying off. And the less died I kept them on the blanket\nfor 3 or 4 days in order to eat his bread...his ration, and survive. I mean this is...this, you see,\nlike a tiger. You have to survive some how. I laid in the hospital without food, without\neating...so after they start swelling already, I told them he's dead. They move him away. I...I\nwas complete delirious. But I remember so vivid I want to get...get a drink of water. They\nwouldn't give no water. But they had the hose...uh...the hose that cleaned the floor, the\nconcrete floor in that hospital. They put cold water on top of me. They wouldn't let me drink\nme the water. And I was delirious thinking that I explore their minds where I worked, and I\nwanted to kill myself. Cause the Germans after me...they run after me. I gotta kill myself. So\nI some how find a wire, like a hanger...a wire, and in Europe, the toilets have a...a single...a\ncontainer on top of the water you pull down. I went in the toilet and I...[ made a loop my\nhead and I hooked up in front and I jumped off the toilet. But the...but not being rope did\nnot pull. I start gargling and I gaged myself. So somebody...prisoner or one...one next to me,\nthey got me off and I pull this off and I ran away. But I heard they were right on the blanket\nand I heard they were looking for me. Somebody was tell in Polish...at that time I spoke\nPolish well because being there you learn to speak Polish and Russian. And...uh...as I was\nlaying there in the blanket and it one day they came and I...I felt I'm getting better. How I\ndon't know. Without food. They did...the polish prisoners, they give a little soup, more\nbread. For me, nothing. I was laying there...was laying there. One day they liquidate the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwhole hospital. They took them all to be burned or gassed, whatever. They forgot me. They\ncomplete forgot me. And people ask how I survived. I don't know how I survived. This way\nI survived. They forgot me here. I was saved in the big aktion. I was...it's a miracle really.\n[...As I lay in bed, I see my father's eyes in front of me. I was laying next to the...I'll never\nforget it. I was laying next to the window. He...he never gave up looking for me. He looked\nat me. I looked at him. He start crying. I...I know the way he looked, it's like a muslim and\nhe was half dead. I'm sure I looked worse than him. He made with me the hand and he\nwalked away. So I knew that he's alive and we're still alive. Now I had to get out. I had to\nget out of here. Next to...as I was laying there a whole day by myself, but the next day they\nbrought the other group of sick people. (Cough) So I decided...again, who told me how to\nsurvive? I decided to get out from the hospital. They called shonung (ph). This is a place\nwhere you...after let's say you, you are cured quote unquote, you stay there until it get better\nand then they put you to work. But you died there anyway. They don't feed you and you die\nthere. So I say, I want to go to the shonung (ph). The only thing I had in my pajamas from\nthe hospital, the uniform over there, and...uh...a pair of wooden shoes. Nothing! And a hat.\nA hat...a...uh...a prisoner's cap. So I went in the and I laid their a couple of days and\nI said, \"If I don't get out of here, I'll die.\u201d\u201d Because a bunch of zombies walking around there,\nold people and they're dying. They're walking around with their blankets. No food. And\nthey...uh...they wait to die. You don't get better there. You die. I decided to go to work. I\ncould...I could hardly walk. Now...but the brigades were already formed, you see. And they\nI was just extra one. They grabbed me in the place. And my father saw me...that I'm going in\na brigade, but he couldn't help it because he was...his brigade passed by already, and it filled\nup....his brigade already. So here I'm going with all new people, all new kapo. Nobody\nknow me. And we're going to a big mountain, and on top the mountain, snow. Just to walk\nto the place, working place, was a effort. At least a good hour to walk. Cold. Miserable.\nHungry. I mean it's a miracle. As I came there I saw way on top the mountain they're\nbuilding a tower...a watch tower. And we're supposed to bring up strands of wire. We have\nwire carry over there...on the mountains, on the snow and everything else. So they told me I\nshould grab one. And it's heavy and I put over...you can't...you have to put over your neck in\norder to carry that. I had to walk with that up the mountain...the kapo next to me. And I\nwalk and I fall...and he beats me. So I'm thinking to myself:..the funny part was I never said\nI'm going...I never thought I'm going to die. All 3 years, I never thought I'm gonna die.\nThere is a Jewish writer Shalom Alehem, and he writes whenever I study him and he writes,\n\" .\u2019 It means you should never lose your hope. Be always...think always\nforward, you'll survive. I never thought I'm gonna die. So as I was going...crawling up that\nmountain with this big strand of wire on my neck which I am sure it weighed at least 25, 30\npounds, maybe 40 pounds... don't know...I was falling down. He beat me. I got up. He beat\nme. So I flashed back like I saw a movie years ago like the Russian the boats over\nthere. They used to fall down...the slaves. They used to beat them. They used to get up.\nThey beat them. I said, \"I'm the same...I'm the same...I'm the same...uh...I'm the same boat\nright now, and I'm gonna survive. How I made that day I'll never...I'll never...and then we go\nup and we go down and carry some more and up. Every time I fall he beat me. Fortunate\nagain, the next day my father took me in...in [his brigade. He talked to the kapo, his kapo,\nmaybe to take me and my son just came out from the hospital. He's sick. Please take him in.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd he begged him working there and also, being a barber, he also...if they're working there\n12 hours, 14 hours working in the mines without food without anything he...uh...he used to\ncome and shave people's faces for extra bowl of soup. And my...uh...he comes to me. He\nwould not eat his soup. He comes to me and he say, \"My son, I ate already. I had already\nenough. That's for you.\u201d I say, \"Papa, have you eaten already?\" \"Yal. Yal. That's for you.\u201d\nSo you cannot go yet.\u201d (Crying) (Long Pause) (Obviously crying) I can't forget his voice.\nBelieve me, not...not many fathers done that. And when he...he used to lay on the\nbunk...uh...and I used to reminisce the food we used to eat at home on the holidays. He used\nto tell me, \"Don't talk,\" he said, \"Don't waste...don't waste energy. Be quiet.\u201d And one day\nwhen we are laying on the...on the bunk...there were 3 or 4 bunks...laying second bunk, and\npeople had to urinate, make in their pants. It was...couldn't control theirselves. Somebody\nabove us urinated on top of us so the...the Polish kapo thought my father done it. So he\njumped on the bunk and started beating him unmercifully. So I jumped on my father to\nprotect him. So they broke a stick on me. At least being younger, I survived that you see.\nOtherwise, he would kill my father. So indirectly we kinda compliment each other.\nWe..we...our spirit. We talk with each, give each other __. (Crying) (Sigh) And...and as\nthe front again...the front came closer. The...uh...Germans are losing more and more ground.\nThey decide to move us...to move us to...uh...to Therenienstadt. In Therenienstadt they put\nus...Jjust put us in...uh...barracks or 1n...uh...officers quarters or soldiers quarters four...four\nfloors high, without food without anything. Nothing really. Nothing! They didn't feed us.\n(Sigh) I remember...I remember they came...also some different scenes seem to stick in my\nmind. When they came 1n there...we...we walked from...uh... Litomerice to Therenienstadt.\nWe walked and we came there...been hungry, thirsty. They assembled so many people\naltogether...most Jews...they throw...they throw bread in the air. Like a dog, you see. And\npeople grabbed and teared it apart. He said, \"Don't do that because you...you squeeze,\nthey're gonna kill you there. See? But..but as I was standing for far away and seeing how the\npeople like a...you take a bunch of hungry dogs and you throw a piece and they were\nclinging to each other, tearing each other apart. And the Germans laughing and having a\ngood time, enjoying themselves. May the 8th, we were liberated. Another day or two, my\nfather wouldn't have made. Never would have made it. He was...he was laying in bed.\nCouldn't move. A skeleton! I can see pictures. His skin was like a dead person. I...I still\nhave some walking power. And I couldn't believe it. I looked... was on fourth floor that\ntime. I looked through the window. I see a tank with a star...a Russian tank. And was all\naround. So I realized that's our liberation. I never knew how I'm going act liberation. But I\ncouldn't walk down the stairs. I slide myself down on my behind, all these stairs, because\nmy feet couldn't carry my body. And I crawled myself up to the tank. There was no\nGermans around it. And I...I kissed the feet of the...the Russian. He...for him it was also\nstrange. I mean...uh...he didn't see...he never saw people looking like we were. Dead people\ncrawling from all the halls out. He gave me oh a piece of bread or a piece of something. I...I\ntook it to my father. And I...we both ate and the crumbs together. And next day I know they\nopened the whole...uh... But they had a quar..quarantine because there was typhus period,\nyou see. Couldn't go any of them. But the Germans are walking in thousand and thousand\ncolumns so we grabbed some food from them and some something, whatever they had over\nthere. They were as weak as don't don't kill me. Don't do nothing. Just....Just here whatever\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nyou got. All...all of a sudden they became nice people. They walk in columns and columns\nand columns. I remember an incident. It's a laughing matter. I started getting my...my energy\nback already. My father was feel a little bit better already. I gave him...I brought him some\nfood, some chocolates from Germans over there. As I walked... walked in to the Germans,\ntake their food away or something, I was very thirsty so one German had a...a bottle\nof...field bottle. I said, \"Give to me. I'm thirsty.\u201d He said, \"No.\u201d I said, \"Give it to me.\u201d I\nmean give it to me. He's a big, 6 foot German. Here's a little...little Jewish prisoners, you\nknow, but I was liberated and he was right now, he would shoot you and run, you know. So\nhe gave it to me and I opened up and I looked, He had Volka, a hundred proof Volka. I\ncould stand that. I couldn't swallow this. But this...this is a...a thing that I...a comic thing\nthat happened you know. And...uh...we were...we were there quite about 2, 3 weeks. My\nfather got more to his energy, and...uh...they opened the _.. A lot of...the Russians...they\nactually didn't took care us much. They themselves didn't have it. But everything....they\nopened up all the...the places, all the warehouses with fruit and with white fruit, and prunes\nand all that. We had to have it. Also my father starts cutting the Russians hair too. They\ngave better meals. Because being a barber, you see, he had his trade right there. So we start\nboth coming to our energy. And we had accumulated two...two suitcases and some clothes\nfor ourselves, and...uh...one day we decided to go find our mother. How do you go back\nwhen the transportation...that for 2 weeks we were traveling on top of the trains. We\ncouldn't go inside because all...all filled up with Russian...with Russians going back home\nand with other ones. So many times...many times I wind up sleeping on the...kerosene\ntrains, the gasoline trains. They run once over there. Just keep on going towards...towards\nLithuania. And we...uh...we stopped on the way and we were tired, so one day we fell asleep\nand we woke up and the Russians stole our... whatever we had...the suitcases. Again we\nwere...we Start from ground zero until we came to...uh...to Lodz. In Lodz we got off and we\nsaid we'll try...rather than go back Lithuania, try to find here because they so few Jews on\nthe...maybe some Jewish people will know where Mother is. And sure enough we find\npeople who have...told us...uh...that she has died with the prayer on her lips we...on her lips\nwe should survive. She only...only begged we should survive. And...uh...they were with her\nall the way in the concentration camp, and she worked very hard and had typhus fever, and\nshe died. How she died and when she died and exactly the grave, we didn't know. And the\ndate we didn't know. And...uh...when I met after 40 years...I met...the lady's going to come\ntoday...Marsha. She...my mother died in her hand. She told me that. And...uh...after 40\nyears, we haven't seen each other in 40 years, and she told me that they're going...not a week\nbefore the liberation. They're going out on the appell to count, and she couldn't make it, and\nshe put her down. When she came back, she was dead already. At least, I know she died in\nMarch. At least I know that her soul is not floating empty and and every...every March I say\nkaddish in a for her soul. She was a good woman. And...uh...the only thing\nmy...my parents really left me was a good name, which I. There was no monuments. There\nwas no...no wealth, which I can give it to my children when I'm... I tried to raise my children\nthe same way to...to be (Sigh) good with people. After we find out my mother passed away\nin...in...uh...1n Lodz, wasn't any use to go to Lithuania. Wasn't nothing there any more. Just\n(sigh) dead family, so we decide to go back, join a kibbutz in...uh...1n Lodz. Uh... They...they\ntaught me that...how to handle ammunition whatever. One more thing I want to insert.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nWhen...when the Russians liberated Therenienstadt, they...uh...asked the people who was\nin...in Leitmeritz (Litomerice) early camp...they gave us all guns. They say, \"Go out and kill\nthe...the Germans. Kill anybody you want.\u201d I couldn't do that. I couldn't take revenge. I just\ncouldn't. Let God punish them. I don't....Why do I have to have blood on my hands?",
        "A: Uh...From...From Flossenberg, they take to Leitmeritz (Litomerice).",
        "A: Well, it was very dangerous trips. Was...there were a lot of old people and children. It was\ncold. Uh... You had to...uh ...walk through...by all the guards. It was not much food. We had\nsome rationed food from the UNRA gave us, the American ration food. And it was a\ndangerous...uh... dangerous mission to go across the mountains. And was cold. Sickness.\nWe had to cope with all that. And I done it...done it a number of times until the English\nhave found out...they saw my document over and over again and they...uh...they captured\nme. They beat me up, took away my papers, and they made me work over there close by, by\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe railroad. And one day I...uh...I said, \"That's...that's the end of it.\u201d I saw the train coming\nand the train leave and I jumped in there on the last train and I wind up in the American\nzone. And...uh...because it's actually was an English zone....the American zone\nwas...uh...not much to go by. And once I...uh...I went over I decided to settle down. Because\nthe funny part was even...it's very ironic. Even being in concentration camp, not having my\nschooling...after all I was 13 and a half years old, I was thinking when I...not if I survive,\nwhen I survive, \"What am I gonna do?\" I mean I didn't have no schooling. I didn't have no\nmoney. I need a trade. So the little trading I had in ghetto from __, I advanced it in\nLandsberg. Came...they had a trading school from the...from the __, and I learned auto\nmechanics, which gave me a...a nice start here in America. So...uh...at one point I was...also\nwhen I was in Landsberg, or to go to Israel...Palestine at that time, and I registered to go to\nAmerica. So the HIAS called me first with America. So when I came in the country, they\ngave me seven dollars on the ship. They dropped me off in New York, without a language,\nwithout nothing, without any relatives, without any...any body. And I felt pretty lonely.\nBecause at that point I still didn't know where my aunts lived. I didn't know where to turn.\nSo...uh...I bought me...I remember at that time, a candy bar, a Fifth Avenue candy bar, and a\nbig one. At that time they had big ones. I said, \"Well, seven dollars might go a long time.\u201d\nAnd...uh...I didn't like...care for New York because the by the __ trains and subways was\ntoo much for me....was everything happened to fast for me and...and...to...to be. So\nsomebody asked me to go to Washington...Washington, D.C. I didn't know Washington,\nCalifornia, I would go any place out of New York. So I wind up in Washington where\n[...uh...I...uh.... went to school here, night school, and I worked and I established my life. I\nmet my wife a year later. She's also a survivor from Belgium. Also went through Auschwitz\nand Birkenau. And we...uh...yesterday was actually 42 years married... anniversary. We\nhave a very successful marriage. We had the same common...common denominator. You\nsee we're both survivors, and we know each other. Though I'm from Lithuania, she's from\nBelgium but..uh...the common denominator is there you see. And we have three nice sons\nwith three grand...grandchildren, one the way, and I'm a happy guy. Really. (Sigh) And the\nfinal thing, I'd like to read something for you which I have outlined. I want to conclude it in\nif you don't mind. I put on my glasses.",
        "A: Yai. I...I left my father in the DP camp and he married a...uh...a lady he knew when he was a\nchild. And she also lost her husband and two grown children. They also hid in a\nbunker..bunker and two weeks before liberation, the Lithuanians told on them and they were\nshot by Germans. So they also broke up...they also broke up people. All of us were broken\nup people. Just skeletons really. Tried to grow skin. Meat and skin on us. And...uh...it took\nme two years. After all, he wanted to be with me and I wanted to be with him. It took me\ntwo years to make paper for him. Secure him a job which had...the only one job he worked\nnext to the Pentagon. In fact when he...when he met so many important people there...when\nhe was going for the first citizen papers, Eisenhower private...private detectives were...were\nhis witnesses. Was well liked. And...uh...he worked all his life until he passed away here.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd he enjoyed life, and he gave me that...that instinct of life. He gave...I inherited it, the\njoy of life. And...uh...it's important to me, to my wife to make her happy. And\neverything...everybody...everything else around us are happy. And...uh...he died a happy\nman. It was a New Year's eve about 18 years ago. He was dancing in Beverly Hilton Hotel.\nIt thousand people around him. He had a massive heart attack. And...uh...being New Year's\neve and the ambulance couldn't come so fast and so they survived...they revived him, but he\nwas too late already. He lived other month or so and he passed away. And his...uh...his wife,\nmy stepmother, passed away a few years later. But he'll always have a big part in my heart. I\ngo often...very often to his grave, so my children go. At least I have a grave here for him\nwhere I can go. For good or for bad and...and pray and shed a tear, and talk to somebody. I\nthink that much God gave me. And I want to come to the few words I want to finish with\nthat.I don't know if they're appropriate or not, but...uh...I wrote down something on paper\nhere. Excuse me. The expression I ask myself many times. How can a whole nation\ncollectively turn away their faces from the wholesale murder of the Jewish people? It takes\neffort to look the other way. Perhaps if you learned the answer to that question, we can\nprevent such a tragedy from ever happening again, but I doubt it that we have learned. I\ndoubt it that we ever will learn. Because I came one day driving...flying from Israel back to\nAmerica and we stopped in Germany to refuel. Was in Munich. And the plane stopped and\nwe had to take a little shuttle bus to go to the station where...where to...inside the airport,\nand they came to us and start even that yelling, austeg, austeig, austeig_. My wife and I we\nturned and looked at each other and reminded us of the cattle cars. And this 1s\nvery, very hard emotion to take. And that's the reason I was present for the Holocaust\nsurvives here in Washington for a long time and the reason was we got to leave...we got to\nleave witnesses, which I am doing right now. The people should know that it did happen.\nMaybe if we couldn't prevent, maybe they can prevent. Maybe somebody can prevent.\nMaybe I can...I can leave a token of my experience to humanity.\nThank you.\n"
