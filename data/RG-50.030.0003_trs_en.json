        "Q: Okay, we are on. Would you tell me your full name, including your maiden name please?",
        "A: Yeah. My full name now is Agnes Adachi, and my maiden name was Agnes Mandl, M-\nA-N-D-L.",
        "Q: Where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1918, October 26.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me \u2014 would you tell me about your parents and your family when you were a\nchild before the war?",
        "A: I can do that. Well, I was very lucky. I was born into a very rich family right then and up\n\u2018til my six years, we were quite well to do and I went to private school started out. And\nthen my father lost every penny he ever had through the crash in America. And instead of\ncoming to America anyhow, he took us to Turkey where I lived for six months. And that\nwas great experience for a little girl. That's where I saw my very first Mickey Mouse film\nwhat was still black and white and no words, but it was lovely. And it was a great\nexperience for a little girl and we had a friend there who was once a captain on a boat and\nhe always played with me because I wanted to be a little boy and I wanted to be on that\nboat and be his mate. So in the bathtub, we played \u2014 a mate. But, I turned out to be a little\ngirl altogether. And then we came back to Hungary and we had quite a lot of difficult\ntimes.",
        "Q: Tell us about \u2014 I'd like to know about your family life during that period. What \u2014 did you\ngo to school. Did you have friends?",
        "A: I went to school and, and according to my mother, everybody was my friend. I was a\nlonely child. I was all alone and I loved to be alone, but as soon as some other kids\narrived and Mommy said I used to become a leader. I don't remember that at all. I just\nknow I always had great time when kids came and while \u2014 as I told you before, I was six.\nMy father was sort of a crazy man. He wanted to give anything to his child. That time\nback in Hungary to get some clowns to come to the house cost a fortune, but that's how I\ngot the friends because the whole neighborhood \u2014 every child would come \u2014 50, 60 of\nthem you know. But then all that stopped and I was alone, but I never felt lonely. I was\nalways a great dreamer. I was always full of dreams. And since I was a little girl I like to\nput everything down on paper. Of course, eventually I lost them all naturally. But I was\nalways writing. Then when it came up to junior high school.... Well, I, I remember one\nthing that my father was an absolutely unreligious. He said he was agnostic. He was in\nthe Jewish faith, but he ran away from his bar mitzvah. That much what he didn't believe\nin anything. And so he never taught me anything either, but my mother was a little bit\nmore religious and she used to put on the Friday night candles. That was about as much\nreligion as I got because my father would take me, say, \"Come. Let Mommy give us a\nblessing.\" And I went without a word. Then as I grew I went to the synagogue because I\nwas a very pretty girl and all the boys were there on Saturday. So it was fun more than\nreligion because I didn't know that I really should be. And then when it came to junior\nhigh school, then my father decided to put me in a Reformed Church Protestant school.\nAnd my mother first asked him, \"Why you want her to go there?\" And my father said,\n\"Because that is the best school in Hungary, and she will get the best education.\" And I\nremembered he hold my hand when he took me there and there was a wonderful lady\nprincipal and she would turn to my father and said, \"Mr. Mandl, why do you want your\nlittle girl to come to our school? We have no Jewish children.\" And my father said, \"I\ndon't like bigots. I want my child to think for herself, and yours is the best school in the\ncountry.\" So she smiled and she looked at me, says, \"Would you like to come to this\nschool?\" And I looked her and I fall in love with her at once, I said, \"Yes, I do.\" So then\nshe explained to my father that a couple of children are there, but they are not allowed to\ncome to morning services. Every morning they had a ten minute service, one prayer and\ntwo songs. And right away I picked up, \"I can sing?\" That was it. But the Protestant\nteacher, the religious teacher was a wonderful lady, another wonderful woman. She was\nabout six foot tall with very black hair and a huge heart and I was like a half pension! in\nthe school until seven because both of my parents worked and she used to take me and\nshe was the one who taught me about Judaism. And she said, \"You have to learn because\nthat was the first religion in the world. And you have to learn some Hebrew.\" So\nwhatever I know, I know from her. But I was the first and then we got more children so I\nwas there through junior high and senior high. And I graduated except that I wasn't there\non graduation because I got scarlet fever. And I missed the graduation where I was\nsupposed to be a hostess and that hurt me. The only little Jewish kid that could have been\nthe hostess, she couldn't be there. But that's how life is.",
        "Q: What about, what about just being a Jewish child, a Jewish teenager in Budapest at that\ntime?",
        "A: Well, as a child I really didn't feel much because by that time my father was again quite\nwealthy and our house was always open and they \u2014 more Christians and Aristocrats came\nto the house, and I never felt that I was different from anyone else. And also we traveled\nquite a little bit as I grew up too because we had a very big family in Switzerland. My\nmother's sister went out there in 1915 I believe, and she stayed there and married there\n' Boarding-school student (French)\nand so we, we went a lot to Switzerland and to Austria and to France. And I wasn't home\nthat much, and when I was a teenager, I started to travel on my own sort of. So in \u201836 I\nwas at the \u2014 in Germany at the Olympic games because my very best friend \u2014 and if you\never read my book you will read about it, how I came away from there, but I was their\nguest through the Olympics. And I was the lucky girl to see Jesse Owens running. Flying,\nnot running. And I was so proud and I screamed for him. And it was a very interesting\ntime in Berlin because it was 1936, and yet during that time they didn't dare to show the\nNazism as much as they really were. They didn't like the Jewish people. They didn't like\nJesse Owens because he was black. They didn't like some other people because they were\nanother color, like Japanese, but still 1t was not bad. And we had a wonderful time and I\nmet a lot of young people there and we exchanged cards and I never asked them, \u201cWhat\nreligion you are?\u201d and they didn't ask me, so I had a lovely time.\nComing back from there I wanted to learn children psychology, and that send us through\npart of university. It was hard to get in because then they already started with religion.\n\u201cYou are a Jew. We don't want you.\u201d But I managed, and I went to Montessori school. So\nbecause of that I happened to go to Italy, and I really had Madam Montessori\u2019 teaching\nme just before she died.",
        "Q: What was she like?",
        "A: She was wonderful. She was a very simple woman with a great mind and I am very sorry\nfor today's Montessori schools because her idea was sick children, most of them mentally\nretarded, to learn to do things by themselves \u2014 to dress by themselves. And today they\nturned this all out. Today they have Montessori schools where the kids have to be quiet.\nThat is not for our children. The children have to let out. But hers was a natural thing.\nShe didn't want the noise because it disturbed these children. And it was a most\nwonderful thing to see how little children help each other to close their coats or do their\nshoes, and I think this is not good to put over to our very healthy children the same thing.\nAnd also it's not good I found out because children learn too much and when they get to\nelementary school they are bored. Because in Montessori school most of them already\nlearn how to write, how to count, how to do things. And it makes children very difficult\nto grow up. But it was a great experience to be in Rome. I love Rome. And she lived out\nin, in a not such a good neighborhood either, but her whole life was the children and the\nteaching the sick children and the poor how to go on in this world. So I do have my\nMontessori diploma. And then from there I went to England because I wanted to learn the\nKing's English in a real good way and I did. Now, of course, I lost it all. Waited all the\n* Maria Montessori\nyears where I lived in different countries, it came off. And after England, I came home\nand that was already \u201839. And then I decided I wanted to go to Switzerland again.",
        "Q: Let's, let's stop one moment. This is 1939 I believe. Things are changing. What was home\nlike then? What was Budapest like?",
        "A: I was not home, so I really didn't know what's going on and my parents wanted me to go\nout. In so far it was bad, you felt it coming. So, therefore my father used to send us out\nwith Mommy every year because when you left Hungary \u2014 not just Jewish people, but\nanyone \u2014 you had to get so and so much money from the bank, not more. And then you\nwould go somewhere and you would leave that money and you came home earlier and\nyou said you spent all the money, you had to come home. So that's how we got our \u2014\nMommy had the diamonds and the fur coats and what not since all gone out and we came\nright back. By that time I was a big girl so I could do it with her you know, 16, 17. And\nstill it was quiet. You did not feel \u2014 because there was always antisemitism in Hungary.\nBut yet like our Regent Horthy\u2019 who always said, \"Yes, I am a antisemite, but I cannot\nget along without my Jews.\u201d And he didn't. Because they were helping and they \u2014 the\ncountry was pretty well-to-do and it was the \u201cLittle Paris\u201d as everybody called it, you\nknow. The King who abdicated, his rendezvous were all in Budapest. He always came\nthere. And I worked for awhile in the Ritz Hotel, which was our best, and he came there\nbut we had hotels where you could not make love, so she had to have an apartment and\nhe lived in the Ritz. Okay? But they came to Budapest because that was a \u201cLittle Paris\u201d\nwhere it was a great place.",
        "Q: Did you ever see Edward the Seventh?",
        "A: I saw him once but that was all \u2014 not a big deal. But I went to Switzerland and I went to\nGeneva because I wanted to perfect my French. I had a French mademoiselle for 14 years\nin the house but you forget when you are not constantly talking. She was also from\nLausanne. And while I was in Geneva in that \u2014 \u201839 almost in September with other three\nstudents, we made an auto-stop* tour. Now today you wouldn't dare to do it. We stood on\nthe street and hold cars. We went all the way to the Rivera and back. Was a gorgeous trip.\nSo we were not ready for what we found when we arrived back because \u201839 was already\nfallen, but young kids don't care and we were happy and we were in Switzerland when\nwe came back. But there were a Zionist Congress and while these people had to have a\nrest, I went out to the Lake Geneva to take a rest and have a swim. And one day we were\nout there and that was September 9, \u201840 \u2014 1939 when suddenly all the radios started to\n> Mikl\u00e9s Horthy\n* Hitch-hiking (French)\nblare that the Nazis overrun Poland. And most of these people were from Poland. And it\nwas a heartbreak to see how they runned half-naked to the phones and the families were\nall home.\nAnd then and there, somehow I promised myself that, as I am in a neutral country, I'm\ngoing to try to help and see if we can make peace. And I stayed on in Geneva, and my\nparents wanted me to stay. But the friend \u2014 and that's a very tragic thing whom we left all\nour stuff, and they were Jewish \u2014 as a matter of fact the husband was, I think, Orthodox \u2014\nhe kept on saying I should go home. After all, I'm the only child and it's crazy to stay\nthere. \u201cThe Germans will not come to Hungary.\u201d And I went home in January, 1940,\nmiddle of the war. Okay? But I found Budapest still very exciting. American and British\nfilm were still shown. They didn't like people talking English. They didn't like English.\nBut we, we did speak it. And that was the time when I taught Congressman Lantos\u2019 not\nwife yet.? She was nine years old, and she was beautiful. She looked like Shirley Temple.\nAnd the two of us would walk on the street talking English, good and loud so everybody\ncan hear us. But they thought we were foreigners you know, who knows from where.\nAnd then my best friend arrived from Germany and for a couple of weeks, 1t wasn't bad.\nFrom \u201840 to \u201843, you really didn't feel different like you did before. Antisemitism was\nthere. We lived with it as best as we could. But then in March 1944 \u2014 1940 \u2014 yeah, March\n1944. That's right. I will never forget that day as long as I live.\nEarly morning one of our neighbors running and said to my Father, \"The BBC\u00ae just\nannounced that our Admiral Horthy is going to quit the Germans and going together with\nthe Allied Forces and he's coming on the radio.\" And my father ran out and brought in the\nchampagne and I looked at him. I said, \"Poppy. Please don't drink. I don't believe it.\" My\nfather said, \"You are too young. You don't understand.\" And sure enough, Horthy came\non and he went as far as to say, \"And we are now the friends of the Allies,\" and at that\nmoment the Germans \u2014 the Hitler's hymn came on and they cut off his voice and I just\ndropped my glass. And I left to go to the Ritz Hotel where I was working there and I also\n\u2014 because I couldn't have no Montessori, nothing worked that time, so I worked in the\nhotel. I wanted to become a Manageress or something. And we had a wonderful,\nwonderful director of that place. He was Yugoslavian, but he spoke 16 languages\nperfectly. So between him and me we always talked French or English. And as soon as I\narrived, the porter said, \"Mr. Marentchic wants you.\" When I got out in the street, first of\nall, it was full with beautiful airplanes. It was a very sunny day. And I was sure that they\nwere the Americans and the British and I was so happy I said, \"Ah, they listed to Horthy,\nso they all here now. We are finished.\" And then Mr. Marentchic took me in his arm and\n> Annette Tilleman Lantos\n\u00b0 British Broadcasting Corporation\nhe said, \"Go home and God bless you. Horthy was arrested, and these are not the\nAmericans and British. These are the Russians \u2014 these are the Germans \u2014 excuse me, the\nRussians came after. So I ran home and my father's only words were, \"You were right.\"\nAnd funnily enough, we were not collected from our houses. We heard that we have to\nput on a star, so we did that. We didn't go out much on the street, but we still were not\nrestricted. Nothing! But they came in and immediately we heard that many, many, many\npeople were taken and we still were not even touched. Nothing! Whether we were lucky,\nI don't know but we were in the house until \u2014 and it was bad because my very best friends\nlived very far from us and I missed them. We still had our telephones. The radios still\nworked. So we were watching because I had a big, big radio so you can hear the whole\nworld and that's how we knew the news, what's coming in from all over.",
        "Q: What were the streets like? What about school?",
        "A: There were plenty food in Hungary. Don't forget, it's an agricultural country. Even\nthrough the whole Germany, nobody was every hungry. Food there was plenty, and the\nshops \u2014 it was still lit up because the bombing didn't start so we had plenty of lights. But\nwe didn't go out much. We were afraid. And you also never know what moment they ring\nthe bell and they take you. So we sort of were prisoner of our own apartment, but we\nwere still safe \u2014 amazingly safe. But every day there was a new announcement in tele\u2014 in\nthe radio. For instance, suddenly the Hungarian Nazis were \u2014 who were worse than the\nGermans \u2014 that was the Arrow Cross \u2014 so they \u2014 when the Germans came in, they said,\n\"The Arrow Cross can take over.\" Now what we heard \u2014 we didn't see \u2014 you see what\nwas the problem was that the Jewish people in Hungary didn't believe. We didn't believe\nlike here they didn't believe that people are taken away to gas chambers. We just didn't\nbelieve it, that anybody can put out from the apartment, that anybody can be taken away.\nWe couldn't understand it. So today when the people tell me, \"Why the Americans didn't\nknow?\" But they couldn't understand it either. They were much further than we were. We\nwere right there, and it was something \u2014 it's impossible. But then suddenly some\nCzechoslovakian friends arrived. Rumanian friends came down. They took everything.\nBut somehow they managed to come away. Then we started to realize \u2014 started to be\nafraid that any moment anyone....\nLetters still arrived from Europe, and I had a correspondence with a Swedish gentlemen\nfor a long time because in a long time in Hungary when you were a girl, who spoke lot of\nlanguages and you were a girl scout, then they asked you to be a guide for tourists. And\nas I spoke lot of languages, once I was a guide for a whole Swedish group. And the one\nSwedish man started to write. He has written for years and years. We were\ncorresponding. I didn't think of anything. I was young and I had a lot of young men\naround me and all that so I just thought, \"How nice. This nice Swedish man never forget\na young kid. And actually he saved my life before Raoul, but I didn't know that then. So\nin any case one day \u2014 that was very frightening experience \u2014 finally, the bell rang. And I\nlook out and there is a German soldier standing outside. And I look back at my parents.\nWell, we couldn't not open the door, but then I looked again. I said, \u201cOh, my God, I know\nhim.\u201d When I was in Berlin in 1936, we exchanged cards and he happened to be one of\nthe soldiers coming to Budapest. And my name evidently didn't mean a thing \u2014 that a\nMandl could be German. He didn't think I was Jewish. And I said to my parents, \u201c\u201cWhat\nshall I do?\" He said, \"Well, you have to open the door.\" He didn't want to come in, thank\nGod. He just said would I show him Budapest? And I was afraid if I say, \"No,\" or, \u201cWhy\nhe was sent here?\u201d It was a very bad feeling so I turned around to my parents. I said, \"I'm\ngoing to show him Budapest.\" And I went out. All I heard is my father said, \"Be careful.\"\nI said, \"Yes.\" What else could I say? So I went and everything went alright for about an\nhour and then we came to a synagogue and he stopped me there and he said, \"You see.\nThat's where I'm going to kill everybody.\" So now I didn't know whether I should open a\nbig mouth and tell him who I am or shall I ask a question. So I quickly thought, \u201cMaybe\nI'll ask a question.\u201d I said, \"Did ever a Jew hurt you? Did you know any?\" He said, \"I\nnever knew any.\" I said, \"Well, then, why do you want to kill people whom you never\neven met.\" He said, \"Hitler told me to do it, and Iam a German.\" So I quickly looked at\nmy watch and I said, \"Oh, you'll have to forgive me, but I have to teach English and I\nforgot that the time has come. Goodbye.\" And he let me go and I run. I never saw him\nagain. I have no idea what happened to him.\nBut it was a close call. Yeah, because I really didn't know how to behave. So then we\nwere all always frightened and then suddenly these two French gentlemen arrived with a\nnote who send them from Paris. The two French men arrived and they're not supposed to\nsay it, but they said they were French Underground and could we put them up in our\nhouse. Dad said we'd be delighted, but they were in and out and sometimes we didn't see\nthem for weeks. And they were wonderful. One was a peasant and one was a very learned\nyoung man. One was a Jew, one was a Christian. And they came to Hungary and one of\nthem fall in love with my wonderful girlfriend. He was unmarried. But they went in and\nout and they did wonderful things. I guess they were couriers between Rumania and\nHungary for the Allies and for France and it's a very exciting time you know.\nFrightening, but when you're young, all you can think, \"I have to survive. I have to\nsurvive.\" So now in the midst of all this, then came this announcement. The first day was\nthat any couples mixed marriages have to separate at once or the Christian party is\nbecoming a Jew and being killed. Well, within a half an hour, there were thousands of\nsuicides. It's a very easy way to kill people. And then they reversed it and they said we\nchanged our minds, but by that time thousands of people died. Thank God, my aunt and\nuncle called. My uncle was a grandson of a Unitarian bishop and he was a newspaper\nman and it was a wonderful marriage. And they called and they said they're going to\ncommit suicide. I said, \"No, you're not Uncle. Why don't you get some false papers and\njust disappear.\" Said, \"I never thought of this.\" I said, \"Well, then think.\" And they\nsurvived. He died after the war, natural death, both of them. But many of them didn't\nmake it. Then came the announcement that anyone who not having the Jewish religion\ncan be saved. They just talked you know. It was \u2014 nothing was now, but we loved to\nbelieve everything because we wanted to live. So in my house\u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me. Excuse me. Not having the Jewish religion. You mean if you convert?",
        "A: If you change, if you converting to another religion, then you're not counted. But was a\nlie, of course, you see. But we wanted to believe. So who arrived to my house? By that\ntime we had a wonderful new principal in my former school who became later on the\nProtestant Bishop of Hungary and he had six daughters and I was more in his house. I\nwas the seventh child, and he came to our house and he looked at my father, who was the\nsame age, but he called him \u201cUncle.\u201d He says, \"Let me baptize that child. She's my\nseventh daughter, and she knows as much about our religion as we do, and I want her to\nlive.\" And my father said, \"Yes.\" So we went to his tiny little church, and my father\nstarted to drive. And Pastor Berecky\u2019 said, \"Uncle Arnold, stop crying. I have full of\nJews down in that basement. If the Germans find out, we all be killed.\" And he baptized\nme more with his tears than with water. He cried so bitterly, and he hold me in his arms.\nAnd it was wonderful. And then he looked at me, says, \"Child, you do what you want\nafter the war. If you want to be a Jew again, go back to Judaism. But you are my child,\nmy seventh daughter. So it was a very emotional and very great thing and we went home\nand all his Jews were saved, I guess, who were down in the basement. And they made me\nout original papers and they signed for it. You know my birth and all that, that I was born\nas a Protestant. And I took all these papers with grace. What else can you do? And then\nthe next miracle happened.\nBy that time I used to write a lot of poems. I did that as a little child too. And we had one\nwonderful newspaper and I send him one what I wrote during the war. And suddenly I\ngot two little letters in the mail that morning. One was handwritten from the editor of this\nnewspaper and he very clearly just said \u201cDear Madam....\u201d Oh, that time I wrote under an\nassumed name and it was \u201cRolopa\u201d \u2014 what meant \u201cRome, London, Paris,\u201d and I took the\nfirst three names and that what it was. So he addressed it to \u201cMadam Rolopa,\u201d and he\nsaid that, \"I loved your poem but unfortunately the censor would not allow me to publish\nit. But I keep it with all my souvenirs.\u201d And I screamed and my mother was just in the\nbathroom, \"Why you screaming?\" I said, \"Mommy, Mommy. Can you imagine.\nHandwritten and he kept my poem! That's better than if they publish it.\" And I was \u2014 I\nhave his letter still. I was very proud. The second letter was a very \u2014 with little white\nletters, but within the back it said Swedish Embassy, Budapest. And I said, \"What does\n\u2019 Albert Berecky\nthe Swedish Embassy want from me?\" And I opened it up and they said, \"Could you\nplease come to the Embassy?\" And I was dumfounded. \u201cWhy, why \u2014 what do they want\nfrom me? And how do I get there?\u201d Because by that time you couldn't really get to any\nforeign embassies without probably being arrested on the street with my yellow star. So\nmy cousin that time dated a very wonderful Christian boy and he said, \"Well, what's the\nproblem? I'll take you.\" I said, \"How?\" He said, \"Leave it to me?\" And he arrived in a\nhuge big black Mercedes Benz, and he had the German flag on the front and he pushed\nme in there. And he said, \"Now, you're in. We can go.\" And he took me up. Nobody\nstopped us. How would they dare\u2014\n[Technical conversation]",
        "Q: Okay. Now we're on tape. Now let's start with the story about the car.",
        "A: Okay. So my cousin had a boyfriend who was a Christian and he said, \"It's no problem.\nI'll take you up to the Embassy.\" And he arrived with a huge black Mercedes Benz. He\nhad the Nazi flag on it, and he had a Nazi uniform, and he was very rough with me. He\npushed me into the car and when I was in he said, \"So now, we can relax and I'll take\nyou.\" So nobody stopped us and I went. And then we arrived up there, it was \u2014 first, you\nknow it was very funny. I, I walked in and there was the Minister Danielsson.* He was\nthe Ambassador then and he looked up and said, \"Who is that Nazi?\" I said, \"He is not a\nNazi. He just brought me up here.\" He says, \"Clever,\" you know, \u201cbut you never know.\u201d\nAnyhow, he and the Hungarian First Secretary, whose name was Mr. Mezey\u2019 \u2014 he was\nthen the Secretary there \u2014 they needed somebody who speaks Hungarian. And they took\nme in and they told me first that they want to tell me the story about the wonderful\nDanish king who stood up for the Germans. He said that, \u201cI don't know any Jews. I only\nknow Danes.\u201d And he put on a yellow arm band and I was so stunned because we didn't\nknow all this, you know. And after he told me that story then he told me about King\nGustav the Fifth,'\u00ae the Swedish King, who had told all the people in Sweden \u2014 and he\nblew that up as big as this, you know, on the walls all over Sweden \u2014 \u201cAnyone who has\nfamily, friends, business associates in Hungary, would they come to the Foreign\nDepartment and we will help.\" And I said, \"Yeah, but why do you call me?\" And he says,\n\"That's my point now. You have a fianc\u00e9.\" And I looked at him. I says, \"I have a what?\"\nHe said, \"You didn't know?\" I says, \"No Sir.\" I told the truth. I didn't know I have a\nfianc\u00e9. He said, \"Well, your fianc\u00e9 immediately went to the foreign department and he\nsaid, \"If the war wouldn't be on, she already would be my wife. So she is Swedish and\nplease take care of her.\" And I stood there, you know, and I, I was frozen. I had no words\nand I said, \u201cI, 1 am a Swede? And he said, \"Yes.\" And we go make your papers. And I\n* Ivan Danielsson\n\u201d D\u00e9nes von Mezey\n' Oscar Gustav Adolf\nsaid, \"Oh, my God.\" \"And that's not all. You're going to stay with us on the Embassy.\"\nAnd I said, \"Oh no, no. I can't do that. I have my parents.\" He said, \"Well, we will try to\nsave your parents, but first comes you. We are now responsible for you, and I need some\nchange of clothes and so on. You're going to stay here.\" I was stunned. So\u2014",
        "Q: This had all come from this young man?",
        "A: That young man whom we wrote the letter, letters for years. And I still don't know\nwhether \u2014 well, I will tell you, on the end. Anyways, my friend Steven, said, \"Well\nshould she come home with me?\" And I said, \"No, I think it's better if we send down to\nher parents. You, you can go home along and we send down one of our employees here\nand he will talk to the parents and we write the letter. So that's what we did. I felt first\nvery bad and, you know, conscious that I am just leaving my parents. But we are young,\nand I wanted so badly to live. And it was really a terrible thing maybe, but I just \u2014 I\nwanted to stay. And so this man went down and told my parents that what happened and\nmy parents said, \"Ah, that's wonderful.\" And they gave them the toothbrush and change\nof clothes and I for three weeks a guest of the Embassy. I had a wonderful little room\noverlooking the rose garden and I found out I wasn't the only guest in the place. First,\nthere was that famous Nobel prize winning professor, Szent-Gyorgyi,'!! who has found\nthe vitamin. He wasn't Jewish, but he was a stout anti-Nazi and they had to put him there.\nBut eventually the Germans were after him and so they gave him a new name like\nSwenson and a new lookout and they put him somewhere else and he left. But there was\nanother wonderful young woman with two little boys and she was German, married to a\nSwede, and she got stuck with the children in Hungary. And she went away after on the\nvery last train that could get back to Sweden. She left with the children. Later on we met\nin Sweden. So I wasn't alone there, you know, and found out there were other people. But\nthree weeks I was there, and in the three weeks the big bombing started. And they really\nstarted and they were day and night, and the German artillery was right above us and we\ncould see whole Budapest. We were in the Buda side. Have you ever been in Budapest?\nNo. A beautiful city and it was a pity to see how everything was bombed out, but it had to\nbe done and we were all hoping that the Americans come and then we be liberated.\nBut after three weeks we knew nothing. My dear friend arrived back with his Mercedes\nand demanded my return immediately. And the Minister said, \"Why?\" He said, \"Well,\nmaybe you don't know, but the Hungarian Nazi Party made every second house in\nBudapest now a Jewish house. Every second house has a big yellow star out because they\nthink that the Americans will not bomb because they don't want to bomb the Jews.\" Of\ncourse, that wasn't true. They bombed the Jews. They bombed the headquarters, but the\n'l Albert Szent-Gyorgyi\nChristian \u2014 from the Christian houses like where we were on with my parents, that\nbecame a Christian house, so my parents had to get out. And thank God, my grandmother\nhad a big apartment where my \u2014 my grandmother wasn't alive, but my aunt was there and\nher best friend who was also married to a Christian but he wanted to be with them, so he\nmoved in. And Steven came every day, so we had two Christians helping us. And that\nhouse became a Jewish house and he said, \"I have to come back because the Arrow Cross\ncomes every day and reading the list of people in that house and if I am not there, and my\nname is still on, then they would kill my parents.\" So they had a little argument and the\nMinister said, \"No, because we are responsible.\" And he said, \"Well, she's responsible for\nher parents.\" I just spoke I said, \"I'm going home.\" So then they said, \"Not with him.\u201d I\nshould go down in the streetcar and I should have one of the employees will go and sit on\nthe other side because they want to know exactly where I'm going. So I went down with\nthe promise that everyday when they allow us out \u2014 we were allowed one hour a day to\ngo out shopping or whatever \u2014 that I call and, thank God, the phones were still working.\nBombing or no bombing, we were lucky. The phones were working. And I did call up\nevery day. So I went down with this young man and when I got to the house I looked at\nhim and he did like this and he wrote a little note and he left. And of course, my welcome\nhome was not so good. I felt very guilty and the family didn't really like that I had three\nweeks of heaven, but I can't blame them. I mean, maybe I shouldn't have done it, but as I\nsaid I wanted to live. I mean you have only one life. But I was back home. And I called\nup every day and I think I wasn't down longer than a weeks and a half and I called and a\nHungarian secretary came Mezey and said, \"Agnes, you have to get up here at once.\nSomething new happened.\" And I said, \"I'll try, but I don't know how.\" He said, \"Well,\nmaybe you're friend will bring you up. Tell him we will not keeping you here.\" So when\nhe came I said, \"Could you just take me up once more?\" He said, But you're not going to\nstay there and jeopardize the family?\" I says, \"No, I'll come back.\" And I went up and\nthere was Raoul Wallenberg.",
        "Q: At this point I want to stop. I want to change tapes. I don't want to stop at this point.\nBonnie, can we stop the tapes please? Do we really have that much? Alright. Okay, let's\nkeep on going. We have 20 minutes. Tell us about Raoul.",
        "A: Alright. So Danielsson and Mezey introduced him to me, and he spoke English and\nGerman, and I think he spoke German that time because I couldn't speak Swedish yet,\nand his first question was, \"Agnes, would you work with me?\" And I said, \"I'd be\ndelighted Sir, but I still have a Star.\" And they all started laughing. And I said, \"Why you\nlaughing? I can't run around in the streets.\" He said, \"You won't. We already have\nprepared papers for you.\" And the same day they send me all alone with the Star, but\nsomebody followed me from the Swedish Embassy to the police station where the police\nchief cut off my Star. I don't know what \u2014 how they bribed him. I have no idea. He never\ntold me, but they must have bribed the Hungarian especially because the war was\nprobably almost over in \u201844, and they wanted to be in good foot with the Americans.\nRight? They didn't know that the Russians are coming. So we all didn't know that that we\nare sold out, the whole Balkan, right? To the Soviets. Well, anyways he cried and I\nthought I was in Heaven already. I must be dead if this police chief is crying while he\ncuts off my star and I walked right back to the Embassy and I said, \"Here I am.\" He said,\n\"Okay. Second, go get your parents' apartment back.\" And I said, \"I beg your pardon,\nSir.\" And they laughed again. I said, \"You're laughing, but I have to do it.\" He said, \"I'm\nsorry. That we can't do it, but there is a new housing commission.\" You should have seen\nBudapest. I mean there were maids who used to work in houses. They walked in and they\ntook the former employers fur coats and everything and they walked for breakfast with\nbig furs and all that. They had no idea, you know. And they took all the apartments from\neverybody. Yeah? So he said, \"Get to that place and get your apartment back.\"\nWhat I didn't even remember, the apartment was written on my father's name, but I\nlooked at him by that time and I got \u2014 you saw right away my, my identification from\nthem. Actually, everybody in that time in Hungary needed an identification, even a shoe\ncleaner on the street, because otherwise you couldn't walk around. This was wartime.\nAnd so I got mine. You have them I think or you will have them. And I walked in with\nmy head absolutely high because now I was a Wallenberg girl. Okay? And I walked in\nand I sort of threw my paper to, to the head. I said, \"What can happen? Either he shoots\nme or not.\" And he looked at me awfully ugly and without a word he signed and gave it\nback to me. I said, \"Oh, oh. Raoul, whom did you bribe again?\" Something must have\nhappened. But I got out. Somebody I heard yelling, \"There is a bloody Jew going,\" but I\njust went with my head up right to my house. And I walk in and there is a \u2014 that was an\napartment building and the superintendent is there and I walk in and he was so stunned\nthat I am alive. You know they had no idea what happened to us. And I said, \"Hello,\" and\nhis wife started to cry because I loved her very much, but he was a leech. He lived on us\nfor years and he looks at me and he said, \"What do you want?\" I said, \"Here. My\napartment back!\" He said, \"My daughter already has that apartment.\" Whereby the wife\nsays, \"No, our daughter has already another apartment.\" So I don't know what he did to\nhis wife after, but I said, \"I like to have the receipt official.\" So he said, \"Well, you have\nto go to our lawyer and he should give it back to you.\" I said, \"Look, where is the lawyer\nliving?\" I went to the lawyer and as soon as I walked in, the lawyer looked at the paper\nand he saw it was official so not much he could do and he said, \"Yes, but that has a\nprice.\" And I thought, \"Oh, my God. If I have to give him money, I don't have.\" And I\nsaid, \"Well, what's the price?\" And he said, \"You will have to testify that I was so good\nto the Jewish people.\" They all wanted that by that time, of course, because whoever\ncomes in, they would have hanged them because they killed thousands of them on the\nstreets. I saw it myself one day this green shirt. There was a little boy of two years old\nwith a star, and he just \u2014 \u201cbang\u201d and killed him. No reason to kill a child of two years.\nBut he had a yellow star on, why not kill? So in any case, I promised him anything and in\nthe meantime my finger was like this [interviewee gestures] in the back. I, \u201cThe hell with\nyou all, just give it to me.\u201d So I walked back to the house. Now he couldn't say anything,\nbecause the lawyer signed. So we go upstairs and I had a very horrible feeling, \u201cWhat\nwill I find?\u201d\nI found an empty apartment except we had a maid's room and the maid's room was\nlocked, and all that and we opened. All our stuff was in there, the paintings, the books,\nthe furniture, and for a moment I thought to myself, \"Gee, He isn't as bad as I thought,\"\nuntil he opened his mouth and he said, \"I'll get even with you yet.\" But I figured the \u2014 in\nthis ball game, the ball 1s now in my park. And I got my telephone back within a day and\nI had our apartment back and I had a telephone, so I was in constant contact with Raoul\nand everybody else. Now I wanted my parents badly to get out of that house. And I went\nto the house \u2014 to the Jewish house, and I screamed up. I shouldn't have done it, but I was\nso excited. I said, \"We got the apartment back again, the apartment back.\" In the\nmeantime, Raoul, as he promised, he got my parents some papers. They're not supposed\nto come out of that house, but I said, \"Out! Out! Home!\" And I took them out. I missed\nthem and also my cousins. Her mother couldn't come then. I don't know where she was.\nAnd I took them all out. My cousin had papers from Salvadorian papers and the Swiss\nfamily helped her so we all went home. And then we started the big work with Raoul\nWallenberg. That time I was\u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me, won't you? Would you pause a minute? Tell me you, when you said when\nyou met Raoul Wallenberg, you seemed to know all about him. Did you know about\nhim?",
        "A: Nothing! All I knew is that there is a young man and I said to myself, \"What is he\ndoing?\" And first I think and that was the feeling that he thought it was an adventure. But\nhe found out in one day, half a day, that this wasn't an adventure. This 1s something that\nyou need. And he was a most fantastic organizer. A quick thinker! His first question was\nfrom \u2014 he had one friend and that was Per Anger, whom I don't know if you interviewed\nyet, but Per Anger was then the First Secretary of the Embassy. And he was an old friend\nof Raoul and he asked him the first moment, \u201cWhat have you done for the people here?\u201d\nBecause it was not only Jews, but it was also anti-Nazi, aristocrats, and Christians, whom\nhe had to help. It was not just the Jews, but mostly. And they said, \"We have given out\n800 real passports.\" Now that was what I had, too. And Raoul was beside himself. \u201cTwo\nhundred \u2014 two \u2014 2,8000 \u2014 no, 280,000 people, you give 800 pass-passports? Well, that's\nnothing.\u201d And from the first day on, he actually took over the whole embassy. The\nMinister didn't like it very much because after all, he was a diplomat and he was nothing.\nAnd when he asked him \u2014 he came as a third secretary \u2014 he had to have a diplomatic\npassport because otherwise, he couldn't travel. And he said, \"Mr. Danielsson, you'll have\nto understand that when you go and argue with the people, you speak as a diplomat. I\ndon't.\" And that's how he wanted. He was like a devil.\nYou know to us, he spoke like the greatest brother, like a little child, and he was full of\njokes all the time. And when we were a little bit down, then he would come up with jokes\nor he would imitate Mussolini!\u201d or he would imitate Hitler or Eichmann.!? Whatever he\ncould make us laugh, he made us hysterically laugh because that was his whole nature.\nWhat he felt inside, we don't know because he never showed. The only thing I knew that\nhe was deathly afraid and that was the bombs because that he couldn't hide. But we all\nwere afraid from that and he said now, \"Whatever happens,\" because when the\nAmericans come, when they bombed, it went all the way through to the basements. When\nthe Russians came the two floors upstairs disappeared. One was our apartment. It's not all\nbombed out you know, but with the Americans it went, and it didn't matter whether it was\nthe Jewish house or the Christians houses. Bombed! And that was it, and the British too.\nBut Raoul took over immediately. And Budapest is a small town and it was like a\nwildfire that there is some \u201cangel\u201d who is here to help. So the Jewish Community and\nthose of anti-Nazi Christians, they all came and Raoul \u2014 in two days we had 350 people\nhelping. And we didn't get paid as you always hear, \"He's a paid employee.\" Nobody was\npaid. We were paid because we had our wonderful identification, but quite a lot from our\n350 people died and were taken and were killed, so those who were \u2014 we were lucky.\nSome of them didn't kill. Not because that they all say that that was saved their lives. It\ndid not save our lives. It was a part of our work with him. We belonged to the embassy.\nAnd it was funny because the embassy only had 12 employees and Raoul had 350 in\ndays, but he needed it. And in no time, he opened a hospital and he was looking. There\nwas lots of doctors who were hiding. He found them, and they worked for him and the\nRed Cross nurses and the other nurses, and many of them died and many of them lived\nand helped him \u2018til the last moment. But he was, he was never for a moment without\nthinking, \u201cwhat can I do next?\u201d\nAnd he was like a machine, you know \u201cGo! Go! Go!\u201d And so all of us became like this. I\nalso slept sometimes one or two hours a night because there was no time. We always had\nto do something because there were always something new what Eichmann was thinking\nof and especially the Arrow Cross. So not only that we had these helpers but we had quite\na few very rich people and they offered Raoul their houses. So we did in two weeks \u2014 we\nhad about 60 houses on the two sides of the Danube, Buda and Pest, where the Swedish\nflag went on and we had Nazi-clad, Nazi-clad Hungarian, Jewish boys standing outside\ntaking care of the houses and nobody could step in because it was a Swedish territory.\nAnd Per Anger writes it in his book and he says that at that time \u2014 because in Hungary,\nthey always made jokes whether there was a war or not \u2014 that the Swedish government\nwas the greatest landlord in Hungary at that time. And we had those houses and it was\ngood because our offices had to move every day because they were after us. Eichmann\n'2 Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini\n'S Adolf Eichmann\nwas after Raoul all the time, but he was not afraid from Eichmann. He invited him for\ndinner, and then he forgot about it, and he had to call the Swiss Embassy \u2014 a Swedish\nguy, and he said, \"Do you have any wine and food? I forgot I invited Eichmann for\ndinner.\" But he not only invited Eichmann for dinner. He asked one of the Jewish helpers\nto serve him so it would be fun to see how he reacts to somebody with the yellow star.\nAnd we did it because it was fun. Raoul wanted it. But at that time we were already\nbombed heavily, and Raoul had shirt open, and this guy here arrived with all the guns\naround him, but he couldn't kill Raoul on the Swedish territory you know.",
        "Q: Let's stop here. Let's back up. What do you mean? Which guy arrived.",
        "A: Eichmann.",
        "Q: Oh. Okay.",
        "A: With, with a soldier and all that. And Raoul \u2014 it was already no light, we had only\ncandlelights \u2014 and Raoul opened the windows and it was the whole Budapest was\nburning. And he said, \"Eichmann, look out. Look what you're doing?\" And Eichmann\nsaid, \"They deserve it.\" He said, \"Stop talking and stop killing the people. You didn't\nwin. The Germans lost, so give up.\" And Eichmann said, \"No, I will not give up and my\nonly thing is that you are in my way.\" And Raoul very quietly said, \"But I am not enough\nin your way.\" He just didn't take it seriously. And then Eichmann left. But he had to have\nhis say and he had to show it to him, you know. I wish he would be there when Eichmann\nhad to be hanged or whatever they did to him. Unfortunately, he probably doesn't even\nknow about it. So any case, it was wild because I was for awhile \u2014 I was just hostessing,\nyou know, because thousands of people came up to us for the Schutz-pass'* what was\nalso his design. He designed \u2014 first, he went to the Hungarian and said, \"Are there still\ntrains going between here and Sweden. I'd like to take the Jews off your hand,\" he said.\nAnd they said, \"Yes, Mr. Wallenberg. You can take 5,000 people.\" So he came back to\nthe Embassy. He says, \"5,000 and they will never allow me another one.\" So that's no\ngood. So then he designed this Schutz-pass. And, of course, with 350 people we had\nmillions of families and friends who collected the pictures, signed, and Danielsson, the\nMinister sat and signed each of them. Now I am afraid you will hear many times they\nsaid they were fake papers. Not one of them were ever fake. If they say it was too many,\nyes, because then eventually we were allowed to make 10,000 of it, but we probably\nmade 50,000 of it. Alright? But they were not fake because everyone of them 1s signed by\nthe Swedish Minister. What was fake was the Polish gentlemen who already did his three\nyears Underground in Poland and he had a little printing machine and he figured he will\ncome to Hungary and see what he can help there. And there he had Raoul Wallenberg.\nAnd he found one of his passes and he duplicated it and he signed \u201cDanielsson\u201d and\n'4 Protective pass (German)\nsome people found it. And they called Raoul, and Raoul met him and first very angry. He\nsaid, \"You can't do that.\" But then as typical Raoul, he looked at him, he said, \"But if you\ncan save one single life, go ahead and do it.\"\nSo very many people got away with the fake papers because they looked so much like\nRaoul's, and some of them died with the real one and died with the fake one. But it was\nnot Raoul's papers. They were not fake, you see. And these people just don't understand.\nHe did. Also, they say he gave us passports. He never gave passports. It was a pass, and\nthe pass and if you will read my book, you will see it. I have it translated. The picture of\nthe person is on there, with the signature, and it says, \"The above, the bearer of this paper\nis protected by the Swedish Government and all his belongings.\u201d And if and when we\ncollectively can go to Sweden, then they will be going and then in Sweden in 14 days this\npaper will be invalid. It doesn't say anywhere it's a passport. It doesn't say anywhere that\nhe can take his star off. It just says he's protected by the Swedish government. And then\nwhen these people had to be shifted out of their houses, then Raoul just picked them up\nand in these 60 houses we put them in. These were our safe houses and it was not\ncomfortable, but they had food and they had medicine and they had Raoul Wallenberg.\nRaoul came there every day and visited everybody when he had time because he had to\ngo in the meantime on the road. Now, on the road he didn't take us girls. He took the Red\nCross and he took some of the diplomats. And by that time he called up the Swiss\ndiplomat and said, \"Help me. We need some help. We need you people doing this.\" So\nthen we got the Swiss involved. We got the Portuguese involved. We got the Papal\nNuncio involved very nicely. And so he had enough men to go with him including\nThomas Veres, who was always with him. He was a young boy with a camera hidden and\nhe made all these pictures. And he also saved the life of Raoul a couple of times because\nthey were sitting and he's photographing and suddenly he sees a German aiming at Raoul\nand he would shout, \"Raoul, jump. They're killing you.\" And Raoul jumped into the car\nand they left. But he went out after the people all the way to the Austrian border to get\nthe people back. With lies, with complete lies, because they heard about it. As I said, it\nwas the coldest winter and they marched the people and I don't know \u2014 and you said,\nyou've never been in Budapest. Between Vienna \u2014 the border and Budapest, that was then\na five hour car ride, and they were walking these people in the snow without shoes.\nChildren, sick people, old people, and they died, and people trampled over them. And\nRaoul was beside himself. So he went on the road and one day Per Anger had met him\nand Raoul had \u2014 have we finished?",
        "Q: Yeah. I want to stop. We'll change tapes and then I want to pick up with this march. It's\nimportant.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay Bonnie.\nTape #2",
        "Q: Okay. We're back on camera. You were\u2014",
        "A: Yes. I was telling that Raoul went after these people all the way to the Austrian border.\nBut one of these occasions he had Per Anger with him too, and he had a big black book\nand on the way to the railway station, he stopped and screamed at the Nazis in German.\nHe spoke perfect German. \"How dare you are taking our people. They're all our protected\npeople. And all of those people, who have my papers turn around.\u201d And one of my very\ngood girlfriends from here now, she said, \"Well, what can happen? They'll kill her\nanyhow.\" She turned around. She didn't have any paper \u2014 and her sister and her mother.\nAnd \"Get on the truck.\" Okay? And then he started to open his black book and started to\nread names like a machine gun. And people caught on, those who could still walk and\nthey walked up whether that was their name or not, and he brought about thousand\npeople back to Budapest to these safe houses. And on the way home, Per Anger said to\nhim, \"Raoul, I didn't know we have a black book and you have names? When did you do\nthat?\" And Raoul started hysterically laughing and he said, \"I'll show it to you when I\ndone it.\u201d And he opens it up and not one single name. Nothing! But that was his idea. He\nhad to do something. He had to save people. And the same thing, he had drivers licenses\nand insurance papers, whatever he could find in Hungarian, what the Germans couldn't\nread. And he took it all the way to the train and he demanded to open the doors and he\nyelled to the people, \"I have your papers here. Get out, Mr. So and So.\" And there to\nsome people, you know, \"Aw, maybe we can get away.\" And he handed them \u2014 some of\nthem got the Schutz-pass, not with their name, but who cares, you know. And insurance\npapers and tax papers. You name it. He brought them back. But I don't know if you saw\nthe film. There was one and that was the truth that he took home thousands and in the\nmeantime they killed another thousand and you could hear it, but you can't save\neverybody. He always played with his own life because he can be killed any moment, but\nhe didn't care. He just wanted the people. Once he was about 250 young men was taken\nand they were told that they will clean up Budapest from the bombing and he knew\nexactly that's not true. So he went after them, again just with two of his colleagues, and\nagain a lot of paper and this Nazi looks at him and he knew who he was and he said,\n\"Wallenberg, if there is one man who doesn't have a paper, I kill him on the spot.\" And\nRaoul looks at him and said, \"That's fine. You can kill him.\" And from the 250, 249\nalready down, everybody had the paper and one give him eye contact with Raoul. Was a\ndoctor, and he is in this country today. And Raoul understand immediately. He had no\nidea what the man's name is and he says, \"Johnny, you left your paper at my desk again.\"\nAnd he handed him a paper and off they went.\nYeah? But he always \u2014 he came up with stories that, that you wouldn't believe that\nanyone can do. Now we had this hospital already. And also it was full of patients and\nalso full of doctors and nurses, and it was cold. It was already a very, very snowy day in\nthe beginning of December, or end of November, and Raoul had one wonderful thing\nwhat I could never learn. He remembered names, and once he had your name he would\nnever forget. I forget it in five minutes. He never made a mistake, to call me Ava and\nsomebody else Aggie. He knew who was Aggie and he knew who was Ava. No mistakes.\nSo what he wanted to do \u2014 the Hungarian Nazi party, this horrible Arrow Cross, they had\noffices in every section of the city. And he send out some little spy to learn every officer's\nname to be sure that he gets the right people. And he never forgot those names, and he\nknew which one in which section. One day he comes to the hospital in this horrible snow\nand he was unshaven and probably hungry. Who knows where he was, saving people.\nAnd he comes in and he finds three little Hungarian punks. I mean punks because they\nwere 12 and 13 year old analphabets, but they gave them the gun and they said, \"Kill.\" If\nyou tell that to a 12 year old, \u201cKill, then you won't get punished for it.\u201d Why not? So here\nthey stand with the gun and the doctor's hand is up and the patients are shaking and Raoul\n\u2014 I was there, it so happened on that day \u2014 and Raoul had to think very fast, and he hit\nthese three kids. I've never seen anybody hitting so strong. Then he doesn't speak\nHungarian. Only a few words, and somehow he managed to tell them in half German and\nhalf Hungarian, \"Get out of here. You are in a Swedish territory.\" And, of course, the\nguns fell to the floor. So we had three guns in no time. And he said, \"Get your officers in\nhere.\" These three boys ran out. I mean, they were little kids and they were frightened\nbecause he was just powerful. In three minutes, an officer walks in, a Hungarian, and\nthey all spoke some German. And our Raoul as quiet as nothing happened, looked at his\nwatch and says, \"Simon, what took you three minutes to get here?\" And the guy looks up\nand says, \"How'd you know my name, Mr. Wallenberg?\" He knew. And Raoul pushed up\nhis shoulders and he said, \"I know everybody's name and besides you are in big trouble.\"\nHe says, \"I am not in trouble. You are.\" He says, \"No, you are because by mistake you\nkilled a Gestapo officer, and they're looking for you.\" \"No, I never killed anyone.\" \"Yes,\nyou did. He died here in our hospital. And before he died, he asked us to call the\nheadquarters and your name is up at the headquarters. They're killing you. So get out and\nbring me what I ask you. Medication! And maybe I will help you.\" Without a word the\nguy ran out. And all of us looked at Raoul, you know, and the doctor start laughing. He\nsays, \"Raoul, what the hell did you just do?\" And Raoul says, \"Nothing. Nothing.\" He\nsaid, \"How did you know it was Simon.\" He said, \"I didn't know he was Simon, but that's\nthe name of the officer there and we were lucky. It was Simon.\" And then the doctor\nlooked at him again and he says, \"Raoul, I never had a Gestapo officer here dying.\" He\nsaid, \"Naturally not, but he killed so many people one of them could have been.\" You\nsee, now that was the way he saved. It could have been a trouble for him at all times. He\ndid the same thing when he saved 70,000 people.\nWe had a ghetto. A real ghetto. And that was just about on the end when the Russians\nwere already outside the outskirts of Budapest and Eichmann laughed many times, \"Kill\neverybody,\" and they put up the guns. Now by that time, we had quite a few Nazis who\nwanted to save their life and the Hungarian Arrow Cross and they helped Raoul and one\nof them came to him one day and he said, \"Go immediately. Eichmann put up the bombs,\nand they're going to kill the 70,000 people.\" And Raoul says very quietly, \"Oh, gosh and\njust our two Red Cross girls are in there delivering medicine and food.\" He says, \"Get\nback to your headquarters and tell them that the Germans called off the killing.\" And now\nit's not like in the film. In the film, he went himself to them. But it's not so. We were all\nin the office and like a little child he says, \"Now, listen to what I'm going to do.\" He\npicks up the phone and with his gorgeous German, he calls the headquarters, and he said,\n\"This is Lieutenant Krauss(ph).\" Okay? \"I want to talk to\u201d \u2014I think Veesenmayer!? was\nthe General's name. I can't remember it. And in the meantime, he constantly looks at us,\nyou know, and we all started laughing because he just made a joke. And when the\nGeneral came to the phone, he said, \"This is Wallenberg.\" Of course, he couldn't hang up\non him. And he said, \"I really astonished what you are doing. I understand you are a very\nhighly decorated First World Officer. How can you take it on your conscious to kill\n70,000 innocent people, plus my two Swedish girls who are in there now?\" Whereby he\nmust have answered, \"Eichmann ordered,\" because our Raoul said, \"Eichmann? Didn't\nyou know he left town? I had lunch with him yesterday.\" That was a complete lie. Now\nyou can imagine. Eichmann could have stood right beside that general, but he has to risk\nit because there were 70,000 people\u2019s lives on the line. Whereby he answered, \"I didn't\nknow.\" He said, \"Alright. Then, I order you to call off the killing, because if not then I as\na diplomat promise you that you will be hanged before your officers.\" He hung up. In two\nminutes, he called off the killing. And we have quite a few old people today like that who\ncame to this country. They didn't know until today who saved them.\nSo you see, his life was all \u2014 what he was there. He was lying. He was cheating. He was\nbribing. But that was the only way. He did millions of things. I mean by that time we had\nour guns too and he dressed his boys up. They took \u2014 the Arrow Cross came in and took\npeople out of our safe houses through the basement and they went. So Raoul turned to\nour young boys and he said, \"You have the Nazi uniforms.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Get dressed. Get\ndressed.\" \"Where we going?\" He said, \"You're going after them and bring them back.\"\nThree or four boys went screaming at the German. They all spoke German, and they said,\n\"We have to take them to the Headquarters.\" \"No, we have to take them. You have phony\npapers.\" And the Germans said, \"No, I don't have.\" \"Yes, that's a phony papers.\" Took it\nfrom him. \"Turn around. We go.\" So these poor people, they didn't know where they\ngoing and then finally, one of these littlhe Hungarian came up to somebody and says,\n\"Don't worry. We are the Wallenberg people.\" And they took them all back. Now we had\nphony papers. We had real papers, too. But you see this \u2014 you have to do everything so\n'S Edmund Veesenmayer\nfast. Now, it was not always easy. His big, big heartbreak was when he had an orphanage.\nHe had two orphanages but in the one, we had 79 children. And, of course, Raoul visits\nthere bombing time and he picked up those crying kids and he would start making animal\nnoises and telling them stories just to calm them down. And the kids were talking,\nlaughing and forgot that the bombs were falling like crazy because that was Raoul. And\nhe visited them as much as he could. Not every day because he had to go out to the\nAustrian border and who knows where. But he came to the children as much as he could,\nalways with candies in his pockets and with just to make the kids happy. He was a clown\nwithout the nose and everything, you know. And one day he arrived and found the\nchildren all dead. We found out from the guard \u2014 was a young boy, who was also shot,\nbut thank God it went in his shoulder, so he could tell the story. They came in. Young,\nyoung, young, 13, 14 year old kids and started to just shoot the kids. One little boy went\nunder a chair because his mother taught him before they parted and he thought his mother\nwas dead and Raoul found the little boy walking on the street and said to him, \"Whenever\nyou get in trouble, get under a chair.\" And these damn Hungarians were so busy shooting,\nthey didn't even look under the chair. Just kill the kids. And one more was saved, because\nshe had scarlet fever and Raoul got her some Christian papers and she was in a hospital.\nSo those two kids were saved. The rest of it were all dead. They just killed them for fun!\nAnd this was the only time I ever seen Raoul Wallenberg down on his knees crying,\nbitterly crying. For about 10 minutes, he couldn't get to himself because killing children,\nthat was more than he could take. And then suddenly he got up, and he was again like\nseven foot tall, and said, \"We're not going to stop fighting. I want to save this nation. I\nwant the children to make peace in this world.\" And he went on fighting.\nAnd it must have hurt him so badly. And I do hope you will have a chance once to invite\nthat wonderful young lady who has been saved because of scarlet fever. Twice she was\nsaved by Raoul, and she is now teaching in Mercer College. She's teaching humanities\nand languages. And you should have her. I will give you the address after. She's a\nmarvelous person. So in any case this was the two people. And then Raoul was out again,\nwhen we heard that they shooting people into the Danube River. And it was December,\njust before Christmas. And what the Hungarians did \u2014 1t was no snow \u2014 it was a no stars,\nonly heavy snowing and the Danube, the first time in 40 years was really frozen with\nhuge icicles. And they thought this is the best time to kill people because nobody will\nlook for them and in the dark and they were cowards these, these Hungarian Nazi men.\nBut Eichmann said, \"Do it.\" So what they did, they roped three people together and then\nthey shot the middle one and, of course, all three of them fell in and died. Some of them,\nI understand, swam out somehow and survived. But Raoul arrived home the third day to\nhear about that from wherever he was, and he was beside himself. \"What will Eichmann\ndo next? How can they do that to human beings?\" And this was the first time he turned to\nus and asked, \u201cHow many of you can swim?\u201d I was the only one with three other\ndiplomats, men, who put up my hand. I said, \"I was taught swimming in school. Let's\ngo.\" IT had no idea where we're going. So we went with our trucks on the other side. We\nknew where they were shooting on the right, and on the left. We turned off the motors.\nWe had hot soup and change of clothes and we were standing at the cave, and every time\nwe had to synchronize. When they shot we had to fall in too, so that the splash goes at the\nsame time. Not that the Hungarians had time to listen because they were so busy. They\nwere afraid they would be caught. So we \u2014 when they fell we jumped and thanks to the\nicicles the rope hang on to the ice, and we knew where there is a rope, there is a body.\nAnd we started to pull them out and then the nurses and the doctors were there, put them\nin, changed them. Fifty people we saved \u2014 what is nothing. But it's more than if we had\nno Raoul Wallenberg. We couldn't do more because we were all frozen so stiff that we\ncouldn't move anymore.\nAnd then that was over and then we had one more big thing. When they advertised \u2014 the\n\u201clovely\u201d Germans \u2014 that all the women between the age of 15 and 25 should go to such\nand such a palace next morning to clean up Budapest, we knew again that they will take\nthem right out of the country. So Raoul again turned to his 350 people and he said, \"You\nall have young friends and sisters and so on, so we got the pictures and we were working\nin the Buda side in a beautiful villa because as I told you we always had to move our\noffices and Danielsson was sitting there, the Minister, signed each one of these passes.\nAnd there was a curfew. No one, no Jews, no Christians, nobody was allowed out on the\nstreet. But what was so amazing that 1t was a most beautiful, moonlit night, cold like ice,\nbut moonlit. Why they didn't bomb us, nobody knows. Why they didn't come on that\nnight. Maybe they knew about this stuff, and they didn't. We don't know. The CIA\u2019\u00ae must\nhave been very good and the Scotland Yard. They didn't come. And suddenly Raoul\narrived around midnight. Again, he looked hungry and tired and unshaven, but he said,\n\"Are you all finished because by two o'clock we have to deliver all these passes?\" And so\nwe said, \"Yeah.\" And then he told us quickly a joke. He said, \"I don't want you to look\nup, but I want you to know that we have new neighbors in the next villa.\" And naturally\nwe all looked up. He says, \"Don't look up. Just work. It's only the German Headquarters.\"\nAnd he did like he didn't care. If Raoul doesn't care if the German has headquarters, why\nshould we, you know? I mean it was crazy. We were taken over by his strength. And it\nwas really a feeling, \u201cIf he can do it, then we should help him with everything.\u201d\nSo I was the lucky one who was first ready with about 500 of his papers and I \u2014 he\nembarrass \u2014 embraced me and he said, \"Be careful.\" And I said, \"Yes Sir, I will.\" And I\nleft. And I remember there was no one around. I went with the curfew. And I walked\nacross the bridge to Pest because all my people were on the Pest side. And it was a very\nemotional going because I had to ring some door bells and some friends of mine came to\nthe door and they said, \"Aggie, what you doing out?\" I said, \"Please don't ask. Don't ask.\n'\u00a9 Central Intelligence Agency\nJust take this. An angel sent it to you.\" And we kissed and cried and I went on delivering\nall 500. All I heard is my footstep on the snow. But no bombing. Nobody. So I went\nhome and finally I sit down on my bed and then it dawned to me what I just done. And I\nsaid to myself, \"Are you crazy? You could have been killed.\" Then like Raoul\nWallenberg would say, \"Get killed? No way. Because the Hungarians and the Germans,\nthey're cowards. They wouldn't be daring to be outside in a curfew.\" And I went to sleep\nwith nothing. I woke up at six o'clock in the morning that my two girlfriends were thrown\nout of the camp because of the pass. And they ran all the way to our house because they \u2014\nactually they spoke more German than Hungarian because they were from Berlin. But the\nGerman officer picked up their German and said something very ugly to them in German\nwhat they can do with the paper. But the kids made one look at him and they turned\naround and started to run and he never shot after them. He let them run. So the paper had\na big \u201csomething.\u201d We don't know what Raoul did really. If you read a few books now,\nyou can put it together what really happened and what he did. But it was amazing. So my\ntwo girls friend are actually in this country. They are grandmothers, both of them. But\nthey lived. Okay? So it is incredible the things he has done. And then that was already\nChristmastime.\nI have never seen him again, because I got sick. Maybe it was partly the Danube, a little\nbit cold, but it was worthwhile. And we only found out after that evidently I had a\nnervous breakdown. But it didn't come out only in the afternoon when I got a bit excited.\nI ran a big fever and there were no doctors to get. They were either hiding or being out on\nthe front or they were Nazis. But my super said he will find me one. And he came to the\nhouse and he said, \"Ach, just a little cold.\" And that is not funny. It was a needle what\nyou give for animals, but neither my mother or me knew to, and he said, \"I give her\nsulfa.\" And very smilingly, he gave me the sulfa, and five minutes after he left, I was in a\ndeep coma. And my mother was in a panic and the phones still worked, so she called\nthere. The super promised me that one of these days he'd get rid of me, but it didn't work\nyet. He tried it once more. Anyway, Mother called a friend and the friend found a doctor.\nAnd the doctor came and he asked my mother what happened and Mommy said, \"He left\n\u2014I don't know what happened. He left a needle there.\" And he says, \"Oh, my God. He\npoisoned that child. This is for an animal. You don't give that to people.\" Somehow they\nfound an anti-whatever. So it took a\u2014I got back. My mind stayed alright except I had\njaundice. So I was incapacitated. I couldn't get out. I never saw Raoul again,\nunfortunately. That was my end. And then the bombing really became so big and the\nbridges disappeared so we could not go. And that was \u201cpart one\u201d of this little life there \u2014\nvery exciting life. And then the Soviet arrived.\nAnd it wasn't better at all than the Nazis. If it's possible, 1t was even worse. Because they\njust picked people up from the streets \u2014 never mind who it was \u2014 and shipped them right\noff to Siberia. The officers arrived in American tanks and American boots. The soldiers\ncame all the way from Siberia barefoot. They were hungry. They attacked old women,\nyoung women. They only ones they saved were children. They loved children. They\nwashed their face in the toilet, and they made their business in the bathtub. We couldn't\nbelieve it that they were that primitive. Some of them stole the watches. They had\nwatches from here to here, and they came up to you and say, \u201ctick tock, tick tock.\u201d It was\nincredible. So it was not much better as what it was. And I had no idea what happened on\nthe other side, what happened to the legation until one day on a boat over came one of\nour lawyers who was a Czechoslovakian who worked with Raoul and he didn't tell me\nthat Raoul disappeared by himself. He didn't say anything. He just said that the whole\nlegation has been taken. And I assumed that Raoul was with them. I knew nothing. And I\nsaid, \"Where did they take them.\" And he said, \"Debrecen.\" Debrecen was the\nheadquarters of the Russians. And he said, \"Do you want to help them?\" And I looked at\nhim and I said, \"Yeah. How could I help?\" You know I was all excited. And he said,\n\"Well, you have to go to Rumania.\"\nAnd my parents right away, \u201cNo, she's not going anywhere.\" I said, \"Wait, Mommy. Let\nPaul!\u2019 tell me what he wants.\" I said, \"Why Rumania?\" He said, \"Because Rumania is\nalready occupied by French, British, Russian, and Hungarian, and that is the only\navailable embassy, Swedish embassy in the whole Balkan, and somebody has to go there\nand ask that Ambassador to help this one.\" And I said, \"Can I go? How?\" He said, \"Well,\nit's very easy because the Rumanians are now allowed to repatriate. So if you became a\nSwede legally, now you can become an illegal Rumanian. Just don't open your mouth\nbecause you don't speak Rumanian.\" I said, \"Well, that's great.\" So my parents were very\nmuch, \"No. No. No.\" I said, \"Mommy and Poppy, the Swedish government saved us. At\nleast what I can do, save them and Raoul. I mean what they have done for all of us.\" So\nthey knew that I have a hard neck and anything they will tell me, I will say, \u201cNo.\u201d So\nthey \u2014 Paul said, \"I'll come back in a couple of days, bring you the papers.\" Now how you\nget there? We had the same wagons as we had to deport the Jews. And we were \u2014 I was\ntold by a few people that some people are disappearing middle of the trip by the\nRussians. They take them to Siberia or they're ship back to Budapest. \"Do you still want\nto do it?\" I said, \"Yes.\" What else can you say? You have to try. So I had a knapsack, and\nI had a fur coat, what was my only warm stuff I had. And I had slacks and we had ski\nshoes what was on me for four months because it was so cold and we always went down\nto the basement. And it took us 12 hours before we even left the station. And you didn't\nknow who the other people were. You knew nothing. But in a little while everybody\nwarmed up. Everybody was hungry, so everybody came out with a little food so at least\nwe had eaten. But after six hours of trip they suddenly stopped. They said, \"Something\nwrong with the train. Get out.\" We didn't know where we were and again this feeling,\n\"Oops, we can be picked up by the Soviets now. What happened?\" But we were taken to\n'7 Paul Hegediis\na school and we slept in that school. There was room on the floor. It was cold, but\nsomehow when 30, 40 people sleep in one room, you don't even feel the cold anymore.\nYou were all dressed. And we were waken up in the morning that we're going on to\nRumania. And there were very lovely Rumanian soldiers up there and they spoke a little\nHungarian and German. And they explained to us that when we come to the front \u2014\nfrontier that Russian soldiers will come. And we were in a wagon with a lot of hay. He\nsays, \u201cI would like you to all go under the hay somehow and not a word. Please try not to\ncough. Try not to sneeze. Usually the Russians are drunk, but they will come in with the\nspotlight. And Good luck. We have to leave you on your own. And let's hope that you all\nmake it in to Rumania.\" So we did that and sure enough, we could hear them coming.\nsinging along. And they opened this heavy door and they skimmed through and nobody\ncoughed. Thank God! And they closed the door and we started to move and we couldn't\nbelieve we were in Rumania.\nNow, we arrived in a very small town where I had two wonderful girlfriends. One of\nthem was a baroness who was a great philanthropist, and I was hoping that she lived\nthrough all this and she did. And the other one was a girl who went to our famous Liszt!\u00ae\nAcademy of Music and she lived in our house and then she went back. \u201cMaybe in\nRumania there won't be any war,\u201d so she goes home. She lived too. And that's a long\nstory I don't want to get in. Anyhow, I met each of them, and then I told my friend,\nMarika,\u2019\u2019 that I have to go to Bucharest. And she said, \"Why?\" I said, \"I can't tell you.\"\nShe said, \"Well, I know you well enough. If you can't tell me, there must be a good\nreason.\" But nobody's allowed to go on, only in official capacity on these trains. I said,\n\"Could you find some official reason?\" She said, \"I will.\" The next day I got my police\nwhatever it was, to get to Bucharest. First class. Two Russian officers. And my stomach\nwent down. Both of them looking at me. One of them picks up the vodka, says in Russian\nto me, \"Drink.\" And I said, \"No.\" And he looks at me again, \"Drink!\" He took it to my\nmouth and I let it run. I was scared. I said, \"Now, for that I came out. Now I'm going to\nbe raped or who knows?\" I was frightened. So the one suddenly started to \u2014 \"You speak\nGerman.\" And I said, \"Yes.\" I said, \u201cUh-oh, now inquisition. Maybe he's thinking I'm a\nNazi or something.\u201d So they asked questions here and there in German. And he said,\n\"Are you Romanian?\" I said, \"Yeah. But I lived in Hungary.\" He said, \"What you going\nto do.\" \"I'm going to teach.\" Come out of my mind you know. In the meantime, the other\none is still looking at me. Finally, we come to Sinaia. That was a stop. And I said, \"I have\nto get off for fresh air.\" They let me go. And I come back, they were not there. The two\ncoats were there. No officers. So we were already moving and they still were not there.\nSuddenly, I see them coming, looking around and jumping in, closed the door. So inside,\nsomething told me that these are not just bad Russian officers. There must be something,\nbut I didn't ask. I didn't talk. Suddenly, the one in German started to talk to me again.\n'S Franz Liszt\n'? Baroness Marika von Neumann\nSaid, \"Are you Jewish?\" I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"So am I.\" And, you know, I look at him\nagain. I said, \"What you doing?\" He said, \"We are dissidents.\" So but I still didn't tell\nthem who I really was. And he said, \"We are trying to go to Israel. My friend doesn't\nspeak a word other. He's Christian. He's from, from Stalingrad\u201d \u2014 or I don't know where \u2014\nno, from Kiev and he was from Odessa, and they are friends. And he's a writer, the other\none and this is a doctor. And he said, \"We are trying to go to Israel. And we are going to\nRumania now. We don't know now, how, \u2014 what. Can we help you something there?\" I\nsaid, \"Yes, I will need a job. He said, \"We know everybody at the Joint.\" So I\u2014 you\nknow, I mean, it was incredible.\nSo we arrived there and they helped my parents a lot. They went back to Hungary and\nhelped my parents and then when my parents finally came out, they helped them through\nCzechoslovakia and my two girlfriends\u2019 mother. So they were very helpful. I don't know\nwhat happened to them. I have no idea if they ever found them or if they ever made it to\nIsrael. I have no idea. But it was a very interesting meeting and a couple of times we met\nin Bucharest. And they knew by that time that \u2014 but they didn't know who Raoul\nWallenberg was. I told them the whole story why I'm there. And the one of them \u2014 they\nsaid that \"We have written a book and I wish you could take it with you.\" And I was very\nexcited and I thought that was a fantastic thing because finally the outside world will\nknow because they have written exactly how bad the life is during Communism and that\nonly the top Communists had everything. They can go on travels and they have food and\nthe people just dying around them from hunger. So it would have been a terrific book to\ntake with me. But we hadn't left Bucharest. That's why. Finally, I was in Bucharest and\nthey helped me to get a very small job that I am enjoying, but they got me a room. And\nnext day I hailed a cab to go to the embassy. And the taxi driver also spoke German and\nHungarian and he asked me why I am there. \"Are you Jewish? And I said, \"Yes.\" \"So am\nI.\" And so we were talking for a little while and he said, \"It's a very dangerous place\nwhere we're going.\" I said, \"Why?\" He said, \"Because the Russian Embassy is just beside\nthe Swedish one.\" It's a gorgeous, gorgeous avenue. Beautiful, with all very rich people\nwho used to live there. And I said, \"Thank you.\" He said, \"I'll pick you up again.\" I said,\n\"No, that's not necessary. I'll get home.\" \"No. No. I will come.\"\nAlright. So anyway, I walk in and there's a secretary and she says, \"Why \u2014 what do you\nwant from the Ambassador.\" And I said, \"I'm sorry. I can't tell you.\" And she wouldn't let\nme in and I sat there \u2018til four o\u2019clock and so in the end she got so tired of me. She says,\n\"Look, I think you can go in now.\" So when I went in and he looks at me and he says,\n\"Why did you sit there all day and you didn't come in?\" And I said, \"Could I have told\nher why I came?\" And he said, \"No.\" I said, \"Well, now I'm here.\" So it was so exciting\nbecause he had his teletype machine and they were looking for all the people that Paul\ngave me. There was eight Swedes and all their families were looking for them and I could\ntell them, \"Yes, they are alive.\" And my fianc\u00e9 also was looking for me and I could tell\nhim, \"Here I am sitting with you.\" \"How did you get here?\" So I told him my wonderful\ntrip. He says, \"Oh, boy. You really made it. Now, promise me one thing. Don't carry\nHungarian papers. Don't carry Rumanian papers. Carry nothing but your Swedish paper\nwith you.\" And he gave me a new this is what you have now ts a new one, because the\nother one I don't even know what happened. So that's all I carried with me. And he said\nthey want me to go with them when they out and I told him exactly where it is. And in\neight days the whole embassy, minus Raoul Wallenberg was in Bucharest. He helped.",
        "Q: Explain. I lost something in there. You \u2014 how did you get the Embassy people into\nBucharest.",
        "A: I didn't. That was the Ambassador. But I told him where they are. So that's why Paul, that\nlawyer said, \"Go, and you're the only one who could help. You have to talk to the\nAmbassador.\" And what the Ambassador did I don't know. But as soon as they arrived, of\ncourse, it was a big crying and laughing. What else can you do you know. We all asked,\n\"Where is Raoul,\" and Per Anger said, \"Don't worry about him. You know he will come\nback.\" He never did. And then in about \u2014 yeah, and they were very nice. They said they're\ngoing to give me money every week. Something to help me out. But when I marry my\nfianc\u00e9, then he will have to repay the whole thing to the government. And I understood\nthat. I mean after all, they will take me with them. So there were seven Swedes and I \u2014 so\neight of us, and they were the 12 Embassy people. Finally, we got a call. We can leave\nand it was great excitement. And we all went out. The railway station is in Ploesti, the\nfamous place where they bombed it. And we were all there, and we were about to get on.\nThe Embassy people were already on and suddenly the Russian said, \u201cNyet,\u201d\u00b0\u201d for the\nother eight and we couldn't go. So we were let down you know. Thank God, my room\nwas not yet rented. So I went back and we stayed together as much as we could and also I\nwas told to be very careful because with the British and the French and the Russian and\nthe Hungarians, I can be any day taken to a prison and asked questions. And sure enough,\none day up comes a Rumanian. And he says, \"Papers.\" And I smiled like I don't know\nwhat he's talking about. He tried every language and I keep on smiling. You know I didn't\nknow what to do. You know I said, \u201cNow, should I get in trouble?\u201d So finally, he\nmotioned me to get into the police station and in the police station, they also talk\nRumanian only. I gave the Swedish paper. He didn't know what that was. And then\nsuddenly I asked for a pencil. You know, I showed him and he gives me and I put down\nthe Embassy's phone number. In about half an hour, the Ambassador arrived. He was\ngray in his face. He was so frightened, you know? And I was as quick thinking as Raoul.\nI knew a few words of Swedish. One was milk, that\u2019s \u201cmj\u00e9lk.?!\u201d \u201cTack sa mycket?\u201d\n\u00b0\u00b0 No (Russian)\n*! Milk (Swedish)\n*2 Thank you (Swedish)\nmeans \u201cthank-you,\u201d and \u201cbr\u00e9d?*\u201d is \u201cbread.\u201d And as he walked in, I started to throw these\nout at him, \u201cMyjo\u00e9lk, tack sa mycket. Brod, brod.\u201d And I went over and over and I could\nsee how his face started to relax, and he almost started to laugh. And, of course, these\nRumanians \u2014 and he talked something in Swedish to me and I talked back again. \u201cTack sa\nmycket,\u201d this and that. So they just let me go. And then we going out to the car and he\nsays, \"How did you come to that idea?\" I said, \"I'm a Wallenberg girl. Remember?\" I had\nto think fast. You would have never been....\u201d\u201d He was laughing all the way back you\nknow. He said, \"This is most incredible.\" I said, \u201cWhat else could I have done? They\nwould have pushed me either to Siberia or back to Budapest.\u201d So that was my whole\nknowledge of Swedish at that time. \u201cThank you, milk, and bread.\u201d But I got out from the\njail.\nAnd then we were called again that now we can leave and that we be careful, because we\nwill have a very, very great security and everything will be taken from us. So my two\nRussian friends came, \"Take the book,\" and I cowardly said, \u201cI don't dare because I\nunderstand they're going to do it.\" Said, \"Well, we understand.\" Not one thing was looked\nthrough. We just went by. But how do you know that before hand? You don't. And we\nwent on a \u2014 that was very interesting. We went on a South American \u2014 not South\nAmerican \u2014 South African military plane. And the side \u2014 we could only sit side \u2014 this was\nthe first time in my life I sat in an airplane, you know. And we sat on the sides where the\nbombs used to be there. And we had to fly to Bari, what was the headquarters of the\nBritish and the French and the Americans and the Indians and everybody. And we were\nthe eight Swedes, there was two Frenchmen, not my friends, but other two and there was\ntwo British. One was a big fat man with a [inaudible] case and he was holding on to them\nand he looked at us so ugly because one of the ladies \u2014 she was German, but she was the\nwife of a Swedish consul who died, she was a widow \u2014 and she and me, we spoke\nGerman. And what we didn't know that this man was from the Scotland Yard. No idea.\nBut he didn't like the German talking you know. He thought this was Germans who were\nrunning away. But we didn't know all this. And we were in \u2014 there was one young man\nwho also, only after\u2014",
        "Q: We need to, we need to condense this a little bit. Could you, could you just tell us when\nthe plane arrived.",
        "A: The plane arrived. Okay. The plane arrived. You're right. I'm sorry. I open my big mouth.\nWe arrived to Bari. That was the military base for the Americans and the British. And we\nwent first to the British headquarters and they invited us to tea and they said that we are\ngoing into a hotel because the Swedes are paid for it. And we did not go in a hotel. We\n*3 Bread (Swedish)\nwent to a transit camp. \u201cNumber One,\u201d what was before for the Jews. From there they\ntook them to the gas chamber. Now it was for German prisoners, and for people whom\nthey didn't know what to do with. And it turns out that this man was from Scotland Yard\nand when he heard us talking German, he made up his mind that we were Nazis running\naway. We were four weeks in that place until they found us. But, as you said, we have to\ncondense. I can't tell you. We were there four weeks and it was most interesting,\nfascinating, all the things what happened. Then we got word that we can go up to Rome,\nand we got an American, wonderful American, young sergeant, who had a truck and he\ndrove us through Monte Cassino, and this I don't want to go in either. And he was singing\nall the way, like Paul Robeson, you know, in a gorgeous voice. He didn't sing in Monte\nCassino. None of us could. It was tragic there. But anyhow, he took us to Rome. In\nRome, we were another month, and from Rome we went, finally, to Switzerland. And\nfrom Switzerland, the old ladies were taken on an airplane and the Ambassador's\ngirlfriend who was a Hungarian Countess, she was flying there. And almost everybody\nexcept the lady who spoke German and this one Hungarian I think it would be the inner-\nminister\u2019s son, whom we only found out after that he worked for the Scotland Yard.\nDidn't even know that. Just he left to \u2014 so only one man, another man whose wife was\nSwedish, and this lady and I we stayed.",
        "Q: What happened to you at this point again very briefly. What \u2014 where did you go?",
        "A: Well, at this point, it was very exciting because I have a huge family there. And all I\nwanted to tell them this marvelous story about Wallenberg. First of all, they didn't want\nto hear anything \u2014 not about Holocaust. They weren't interested. And I kept on saying,\n\"But this is such a wonderful story.\" \"I told you we are not interested. And don't think so\nmuch about it. We don't have it.\u201d Switzerland had everything, but they didn't want it. So\nit was a very unpleasant four weeks when we got our marching orders that we can go\nwith the Norwegian Red Cross through Germany into Denmark and then from Denmark\nto Sweden. Well, the Swiss knew exactly that we had no food in Germany at all, and they\ntook everybody's food and everybody's money away. And I was very lucky. Again, I was\nall the way in the back. I went into the toilet and I took all my money and I put it in my\nshoe and I went back. So at least I had money. Food, they took away. So we went three\ndays and we didn't eat because there was no food in Germany no where. We went\nthrough Nuremberg. We went through whole lot of things, and then we arrived in this\nsmall town of Denmark and it's incredible. There was a whole village made up with\nmaybe millions of showers with hot water and food. You have never seen so much food\nin your life. We all got sick because we didn't \u2014 we couldn't eat that much, but the Danes\njust didn't know what to do because there were Norwegians who were stuck. And there\nwere Danes and there were Swedes and there were us, you know. They were incredible.\nOur drivers on the car \u2014 on the trucks by the way were Nazi prisoners, and I will never\nforget that, that nobody \u2014 all the Norwegians, the Danes, they spoke German. None of\nthem wanted \u2014 but they decided it is dangerous because all the signs through Germany\nnow in English and there are places where there are no bridge. Somebody has to do it, so\nI used to be the youngest. So they said, \"Will you speak to them in German?\" So I said,\n\"Do I have to?\" \"Yeah.\" So I sat with the driver and he still had the Swastika hanging\nthere. Today, I'm laughing about it. If he would have known that a Jew is giving him the\ndirections and the orders what to do, I think he would have killed us all. But it was fun.\nAnd we made tt.",
        "Q: We need to \u2014 excuse me, we need to condense. Could you now tell us when you got into\nSweden? Just very briefly. How long you were there.",
        "A: Sweden, I got in, in October. October four or five. And I first went to my fiance's mother.\nFirst, they wouldn't let me in and that's a long story. I'll tell you another day. And then we\nwent up for a weekend to Stockholm already together with his mother. And there was\ntwo gentlemen. He and another gentleman who met me, and they were greeting me with a\nfist like this and I said, \"What's that?\" And he said, \"Oh, don't you know? That's the\nCommunist's greetings.\" And my stomach went down again and I said, \"Huh?\" Tells me\nhis greetings, but I thought it was just stupid joke. Anyhow, next day, that was Sunday.\nMonday, I got in contact with everybody from the Swedish Embassy. My first question\nwas, \"Where is Raoul?\" \"We don't know,\" was the answer. And then I told them about\nmy fianc\u00e9 whom I have to marry, and I told them that I am very disturbed because he\ngreet me like that and you will have to understand that I cannot marry a Communist. And\nthey say, \"Well, we understand that, but after all, he....\" I said, \"Yes, I know.\" They\nfound out he was one of the top Communists. And what happened is that in Switzerland,\nI was interviewed by a friend who's a newspaper man. And, as usual, with newspaper\npeople, they go after their own head. I said, \"I'm going to Sweden.\" What he put down\nthat I'm going in Hungarian government business to Oslo. And even when the Embassy\nsaw it, \"Is she crazy? Well, what is this?\" So that wasn't true and so this fianc\u00e9 of mine\nthought that I am going from Communist business so he brought the chief of\nCommunist's party. Anyways, everything turned out. I didn't have to marry him. And that\nwas wonderful, you know. But in the meantime, it also turned out that he really wanted to\nsave me and he was in love with someone else. So it turned out alright that far. But I was\nthere and I very fast got a wonderful job with Count Bernadotte** who brought in from all\nthe camps the people they needed \u2014 people who go out and can speak France and German\nand Hungarian and tell them stories about Swedish literature and culture. And that was a\nvery wonderful thing to do because I had a key to the Royal Library because they had the\nbooks were translated from Swedish to German so I could read Selma Lagerlof and all\nthat. And I went and spoke for six months in all the camps. I was very well paid, and it\nwas also very wonderful. The people I met in these camps who came out so sick, and the\nSwedes took care so beautifully of them. So that was the \u2014 I was three years in Sweden.\n** Count Folke Bernadotte\nAfter this job, I worked for a Scandinavian bank and then I got frightened from the\nSoviets because everybody thought the Soviet going to overrun Sweden. Everybody was\nlearning Russian in Sweden. Children were \u2014 when they were naughty, they said, \u201cWe\ngive you to the Russians.\u201d And I got frightened. I just wanted freedom, and it was\nwonderful and I loved Sweden. And Raoul wasn't home yet, and we didn't know what\nhappened. Nothing we knew about it. And in the meantime, I brought my parents out.\nAnd I wanted to come to America and they wouldn't let me. They said American was\nclosed 12 years for Hungarians. So Australia let me, and I went all alone all the way to\nAustralia and left my parents behind in Sweden. And Raoul was still not back. And we\ncouldn't find him. We still didn't hear too much and still nobody was looking for him.\nActually, nobody cared. You never heard that word, \u201cRaoul Wallenberg.\u201d Then I came to\nthe States, and when I arrived to the States my parents went to Argentina. They lived\nthere for three years, and when I became a citizen, then they finally came here. And in\n1960, I got married and the first person ever listened and believed the Wallenberg story\nwas my husband. Three weeks on our honeymoon, I told him the story and he was crying\nfor three weeks. We want that man back, but we still didn't do anything.\nAnd then as you know, in the late 70s, Congressman Lantos\u201d and his wife started to look\nfor him. And that's how it all started. And now my job 1s strictly to let the whole world\nknow, especially children, that there is a hero outside. Because we don't have any heroes.\nAnd we don't teach our children. And the Holocaust is important. Not just because the\n6,000,000 Jews, because you know that Hitler killed 3,000,000 people who were priests,\nnuns, gypsies, blacks, and children in wheelchairs. Three million, that's Holocaust.\nTwenty three million young Russians. That's Holocaust. What's going on in South Africa\nis Holocaust. We don't teach it to our children. We can't live like that. Children have to\nknow what to fight for as Raoul Wallenberg did, because only the children without\nprejudice holding their hands, can make peace in the world. And this 1s the only way, and\nthat's what I am teaching. I cannot bring Raoul out. I have no authority for that. I let that\nlet the diplomats handle it. But he's teaching us to go on, \u2018cause he taught me too.\nAlright, I was in a family where nobody was ever prejudiced, but I learned that, like\nRaoul, always that there are no colors. There are no religions. There are two kind of\npeople, the good and the bad. And if you're good, try to make the bad better. And that's\nwhat children \u2014 and children listen. You'd be surprised how wonderful they are in the\nschools. And if I only reach three or four children in every school, in every college, then\nwe will have some wonderful people.\n*\u00b0 Thomas P. Lantos",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: You're welcome.",
        "Q: You had told me before the interview about Raoul and being with people. Could we go\nback to the war? And go back to your early working with Raoul. I know he went to the\nYellow Star houses. Can you tell us about, about \u2014 alright, can you tell us about your\ngoing with Raoul to help people? You had told me several stories.",
        "A: Yeah. Not to Yellow houses. He never went to the Yellow Star houses. He went to the\nhouses what he set up with the Swedish flag.",
        "Q: I'm sorry. You're right.",
        "A: Alright? I actually didn't go with him in this. I was in the hospital many times with him\nbecause that he needed help there, the nurses and the sick people. And I was a hostess at\nthe Embassy when these people came up to the door to ask, \"Please help.\" And then I\ntook their picture and I went to the Ambassador and he would sign. And the Danube, as\nyou know, and mostly I helped up in the Embassy. Whatever I could do. I was not a\nsecretary, I was a gofer \u2014 \u201cgo for this\u201d and \u201cgo for that.\u201d And it was wonderful. But we\nalways knew what Raoul did, and then on my own, I also collected some people and said,\n\"Do you want to be saved? Give me a picture.\" And then I took it back. And sometime it\ncome out very embarrassing because you don't remember the people you help, but they\nremember you. And this happened to me when I arrived. If you are interested, I arrived to\nthis country, and I had something wrong with my tonsils, and I found a Hungarian doctor\nof all places up and near West End Avenue in New York. And one day, I'm sitting in his\nliving room. His living room was his waiting room, and people come up from his\nbedroom, his family. And I'm sitting there reading a book, and suddenly a fat gentlemen\nwalked by and start screaming, \"You saved my life. You saved my life.\" And I looked\naround. I forgot the war you know. Who thinks of the war? But he comes suddenly, and\nhe sits down and starts kissing my hand, and talks Hungarian, and I said, \"Uncle, what\nare you doing? Who are you?\" You know, and looking frightened. And then he told me\nthe story you see. The Embassies are \u2014 whether there's a war or not, they close at three\no'clock. Okay? Three o'clock, a knock at the door, and there stands this gentleman with\nfour pictures and he said, \"Please. Please. Would you give us the paper.\" And I said, \"I'm\nsorry. We are closed.\" And he started to cry. I said, \"Okay. Okay. Uncle. Just a minute.\"\nAnd I went over to the Ambassador and I said, \"Ambassador, just these four more.\" And\nhe said, \"No. No. No. I have a date.\" I said, \"Please. Just sign your name.\" He did. And I\nhanded it back to the man. It happened to be the son the, the brother-in-law of the doctor.\nOkay? And I was so embarrassed. And it was him. They all survived.\nPer Anger had the same thing happening to him years after in Vienna 1n 1956 when the\nuprising in Hungary happened during the Russians. Well, in this uprising the only people\nwho run away, was some Nazis who were left over and some Jews. And he was then\nalready Vice Consul in Vienna, and the people came on the boats. So he thought, \"Well,\nif Raoul could do it then, maybe I should go down to the riverside and help these people\nout.\" And he goes in with this little light, and suddenly a lady comes off a boat and starts\nrunning. \"Mr. Anger, you saved me from the Nazis. Now you're saving me from the\nRussians.\" And he still \u2014 he was \u2014 you know, it was, it was a terrible \u2014 it's a beautiful\nfeeling. To Raoul it happened once. When the Russians took him, and it's also you not\nlike to hear that, he right away went. He came back once with two Russian officers\nbehind him and the only person who saw him was our electoral in Budapest. And he\ncame back and he said, \"I don't know whether I'm ordered back to the Russian\nheadquarters, but I don't know if I am going as a guest or as a prisoner.\" This was his last\nwords. But he said, \"I have to tell you a story. On the way here now, we saw a little old\nlady with still the yellow star that she was carrying bread in her bag. And I got out and I\nsaid to her, \"Do you speak German?\" And she said, \"Yes.\" And I said, \"I am Raoul\nWallenberg.\" And she said, \"I know,\" and she pulled out the pass. And he said, \"I started\nto cry.\" He said, \"At least one person I know is alive.\" So I'm glad that it happened to him\nat least once that he found someone who lived because of him. And you know, and it\nhappened a few \u2014 a year ago, I think, I spoke to a big group grownups in a synagogue, I\nbelieve, in Pennsylvania. And I was telling them the Danube business, and suddenly an\nold gentleman got up and he says, \"Stop.\" And he looked around to the people. He said,\n\"Everybody can see this little scratch here?\" And the people said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Well,\nI was lucky. The bullet hit me there, and that's the girl who pulled me out and I froze. I\nsaid, \"No, I didn't.\" He said, \"Yes, you did.\" Because you know, after awhile you don't\nbelieve it yourself because years going by and I was sick and it was frozen. But I was the\nonly woman. So and that is a life. And I thought it was a wonderful life and I am glad I\nlived through it.",

        "A: Well, you see, we worked for Raoul, 350 of us, and we all got working papers, and this is\nmine. And the working paper is written in two languages, in Hungarian and German, and\nthanks God, everything 1s signed by Raoul, himself. In Hungarian up there he signed and\nin the German, too. It says exactly that we are working under Department B or some of\nthem work for Department A, plus the Swedish Red Cross.

        "A: Well, this 1s before Raoul arrived to Hungary. The Swedish Government, itself, gave out\n800 of these passports. They are real Swedish passports. When the house doesn\u2019t have\nthe hard cover, they give you this. And I was one of the lucky girls to get one, because I\nwas evidently engaged to a Swedish gentleman and he said if the war wouldn\u2019t have\ncome, I would be his wife. So I am Swedish and that\u2019s my paper. And I traveled along.\nAll the visas on the back, you can see.

        "A: Yeah. My full name now is Agnes Adachi, and my maiden name was Agnes Mandl, M-\nA-N-D-L.",
        "A: I was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1918, October 26.",
        "A: I can do that. Well, I was very lucky. I was born into a very rich family right then and up\n\u2018til my six years, we were quite well to do and I went to private school started out. And\nthen my father lost every penny he ever had through the crash in America. And instead of\ncoming to America anyhow, he took us to Turkey where I lived for six months. And that\nwas great experience for a little girl. That's where I saw my very first Mickey Mouse film\nwhat was still black and white and no words, but it was lovely. And it was a great\nexperience for a little girl and we had a friend there who was once a captain on a boat and\nhe always played with me because I wanted to be a little boy and I wanted to be on that\nboat and be his mate. So in the bathtub, we played \u2014 a mate. But, I turned out to be a little\ngirl altogether. And then we came back to Hungary and we had quite a lot of difficult\ntimes.",
        "A: I went to school and, and according to my mother, everybody was my friend. I was a\nlonely child. I was all alone and I loved to be alone, but as soon as some other kids\narrived and Mommy said I used to become a leader. I don't remember that at all. I just\nknow I always had great time when kids came and while \u2014 as I told you before, I was six.\nMy father was sort of a crazy man. He wanted to give anything to his child. That time\nback in Hungary to get some clowns to come to the house cost a fortune, but that's how I\ngot the friends because the whole neighborhood \u2014 every child would come \u2014 50, 60 of\nthem you know. But then all that stopped and I was alone, but I never felt lonely. I was\nalways a great dreamer. I was always full of dreams. And since I was a little girl I like to\nput everything down on paper. Of course, eventually I lost them all naturally. But I was\nalways writing. Then when it came up to junior high school.... Well, I, I remember one\nthing that my father was an absolutely unreligious. He said he was agnostic. He was in\nthe Jewish faith, but he ran away from his bar mitzvah. That much what he didn't believe\nin anything. And so he never taught me anything either, but my mother was a little bit\nmore religious and she used to put on the Friday night candles. That was about as much\nreligion as I got because my father would take me, say, \"Come. Let Mommy give us a\nblessing.\" And I went without a word. Then as I grew I went to the synagogue because I\nwas a very pretty girl and all the boys were there on Saturday. So it was fun more than\nreligion because I didn't know that I really should be. And then when it came to junior\nhigh school, then my father decided to put me in a Reformed Church Protestant school.\nAnd my mother first asked him, \"Why you want her to go there?\" And my father said,\n\"Because that is the best school in Hungary, and she will get the best education.\" And I\nremembered he hold my hand when he took me there and there was a wonderful lady\nprincipal and she would turn to my father and said, \"Mr. Mandl, why do you want your\nlittle girl to come to our school? We have no Jewish children.\" And my father said, \"I\ndon't like bigots. I want my child to think for herself, and yours is the best school in the\ncountry.\" So she smiled and she looked at me, says, \"Would you like to come to this\nschool?\" And I looked her and I fall in love with her at once, I said, \"Yes, I do.\" So then\nshe explained to my father that a couple of children are there, but they are not allowed to\ncome to morning services. Every morning they had a ten minute service, one prayer and\ntwo songs. And right away I picked up, \"I can sing?\" That was it. But the Protestant\nteacher, the religious teacher was a wonderful lady, another wonderful woman. She was\nabout six foot tall with very black hair and a huge heart and I was like a half pension! in\nthe school until seven because both of my parents worked and she used to take me and\nshe was the one who taught me about Judaism. And she said, \"You have to learn because\nthat was the first religion in the world. And you have to learn some Hebrew.\" So\nwhatever I know, I know from her. But I was the first and then we got more children so I\nwas there through junior high and senior high. And I graduated except that I wasn't there\non graduation because I got scarlet fever. And I missed the graduation where I was\nsupposed to be a hostess and that hurt me. The only little Jewish kid that could have been\nthe hostess, she couldn't be there. But that's how life is.",
        "A: Well, as a child I really didn't feel much because by that time my father was again quite\nwealthy and our house was always open and they \u2014 more Christians and Aristocrats came\nto the house, and I never felt that I was different from anyone else. And also we traveled\nquite a little bit as I grew up too because we had a very big family in Switzerland. My\nmother's sister went out there in 1915 I believe, and she stayed there and married there\n' Boarding-school student (French)\nand so we, we went a lot to Switzerland and to Austria and to France. And I wasn't home\nthat much, and when I was a teenager, I started to travel on my own sort of. So in \u201836 I\nwas at the \u2014 in Germany at the Olympic games because my very best friend \u2014 and if you\never read my book you will read about it, how I came away from there, but I was their\nguest through the Olympics. And I was the lucky girl to see Jesse Owens running. Flying,\nnot running. And I was so proud and I screamed for him. And it was a very interesting\ntime in Berlin because it was 1936, and yet during that time they didn't dare to show the\nNazism as much as they really were. They didn't like the Jewish people. They didn't like\nJesse Owens because he was black. They didn't like some other people because they were\nanother color, like Japanese, but still 1t was not bad. And we had a wonderful time and I\nmet a lot of young people there and we exchanged cards and I never asked them, \u201cWhat\nreligion you are?\u201d and they didn't ask me, so I had a lovely time.\nComing back from there I wanted to learn children psychology, and that send us through\npart of university. It was hard to get in because then they already started with religion.\n\u201cYou are a Jew. We don't want you.\u201d But I managed, and I went to Montessori school. So\nbecause of that I happened to go to Italy, and I really had Madam Montessori\u2019 teaching\nme just before she died.",
        "A: She was wonderful. She was a very simple woman with a great mind and I am very sorry\nfor today's Montessori schools because her idea was sick children, most of them mentally\nretarded, to learn to do things by themselves \u2014 to dress by themselves. And today they\nturned this all out. Today they have Montessori schools where the kids have to be quiet.\nThat is not for our children. The children have to let out. But hers was a natural thing.\nShe didn't want the noise because it disturbed these children. And it was a most\nwonderful thing to see how little children help each other to close their coats or do their\nshoes, and I think this is not good to put over to our very healthy children the same thing.\nAnd also it's not good I found out because children learn too much and when they get to\nelementary school they are bored. Because in Montessori school most of them already\nlearn how to write, how to count, how to do things. And it makes children very difficult\nto grow up. But it was a great experience to be in Rome. I love Rome. And she lived out\nin, in a not such a good neighborhood either, but her whole life was the children and the\nteaching the sick children and the poor how to go on in this world. So I do have my\nMontessori diploma. And then from there I went to England because I wanted to learn the\nKing's English in a real good way and I did. Now, of course, I lost it all. Waited all the\n* Maria Montessori\nyears where I lived in different countries, it came off. And after England, I came home\nand that was already \u201839. And then I decided I wanted to go to Switzerland again.",
        "A: I was not home, so I really didn't know what's going on and my parents wanted me to go\nout. In so far it was bad, you felt it coming. So, therefore my father used to send us out\nwith Mommy every year because when you left Hungary \u2014 not just Jewish people, but\nanyone \u2014 you had to get so and so much money from the bank, not more. And then you\nwould go somewhere and you would leave that money and you came home earlier and\nyou said you spent all the money, you had to come home. So that's how we got our \u2014\nMommy had the diamonds and the fur coats and what not since all gone out and we came\nright back. By that time I was a big girl so I could do it with her you know, 16, 17. And\nstill it was quiet. You did not feel \u2014 because there was always antisemitism in Hungary.\nBut yet like our Regent Horthy\u2019 who always said, \"Yes, I am a antisemite, but I cannot\nget along without my Jews.\u201d And he didn't. Because they were helping and they \u2014 the\ncountry was pretty well-to-do and it was the \u201cLittle Paris\u201d as everybody called it, you\nknow. The King who abdicated, his rendezvous were all in Budapest. He always came\nthere. And I worked for awhile in the Ritz Hotel, which was our best, and he came there\nbut we had hotels where you could not make love, so she had to have an apartment and\nhe lived in the Ritz. Okay? But they came to Budapest because that was a \u201cLittle Paris\u201d\nwhere it was a great place.",
        "A: I saw him once but that was all \u2014 not a big deal. But I went to Switzerland and I went to\nGeneva because I wanted to perfect my French. I had a French mademoiselle for 14 years\nin the house but you forget when you are not constantly talking. She was also from\nLausanne. And while I was in Geneva in that \u2014 \u201839 almost in September with other three\nstudents, we made an auto-stop* tour. Now today you wouldn't dare to do it. We stood on\nthe street and hold cars. We went all the way to the Rivera and back. Was a gorgeous trip.\nSo we were not ready for what we found when we arrived back because \u201839 was already\nfallen, but young kids don't care and we were happy and we were in Switzerland when\nwe came back. But there were a Zionist Congress and while these people had to have a\nrest, I went out to the Lake Geneva to take a rest and have a swim. And one day we were\nout there and that was September 9, \u201840 \u2014 1939 when suddenly all the radios started to\n> Mikl\u00e9s Horthy\n* Hitch-hiking (French)\nblare that the Nazis overrun Poland. And most of these people were from Poland. And it\nwas a heartbreak to see how they runned half-naked to the phones and the families were\nall home.\nAnd then and there, somehow I promised myself that, as I am in a neutral country, I'm\ngoing to try to help and see if we can make peace. And I stayed on in Geneva, and my\nparents wanted me to stay. But the friend \u2014 and that's a very tragic thing whom we left all\nour stuff, and they were Jewish \u2014 as a matter of fact the husband was, I think, Orthodox \u2014\nhe kept on saying I should go home. After all, I'm the only child and it's crazy to stay\nthere. \u201cThe Germans will not come to Hungary.\u201d And I went home in January, 1940,\nmiddle of the war. Okay? But I found Budapest still very exciting. American and British\nfilm were still shown. They didn't like people talking English. They didn't like English.\nBut we, we did speak it. And that was the time when I taught Congressman Lantos\u2019 not\nwife yet.? She was nine years old, and she was beautiful. She looked like Shirley Temple.\nAnd the two of us would walk on the street talking English, good and loud so everybody\ncan hear us. But they thought we were foreigners you know, who knows from where.\nAnd then my best friend arrived from Germany and for a couple of weeks, 1t wasn't bad.\nFrom \u201840 to \u201843, you really didn't feel different like you did before. Antisemitism was\nthere. We lived with it as best as we could. But then in March 1944 \u2014 1940 \u2014 yeah, March\n1944. That's right. I will never forget that day as long as I live.\nEarly morning one of our neighbors running and said to my Father, \"The BBC\u00ae just\nannounced that our Admiral Horthy is going to quit the Germans and going together with\nthe Allied Forces and he's coming on the radio.\" And my father ran out and brought in the\nchampagne and I looked at him. I said, \"Poppy. Please don't drink. I don't believe it.\" My\nfather said, \"You are too young. You don't understand.\" And sure enough, Horthy came\non and he went as far as to say, \"And we are now the friends of the Allies,\" and at that\nmoment the Germans \u2014 the Hitler's hymn came on and they cut off his voice and I just\ndropped my glass. And I left to go to the Ritz Hotel where I was working there and I also\n\u2014 because I couldn't have no Montessori, nothing worked that time, so I worked in the\nhotel. I wanted to become a Manageress or something. And we had a wonderful,\nwonderful director of that place. He was Yugoslavian, but he spoke 16 languages\nperfectly. So between him and me we always talked French or English. And as soon as I\narrived, the porter said, \"Mr. Marentchic wants you.\" When I got out in the street, first of\nall, it was full with beautiful airplanes. It was a very sunny day. And I was sure that they\nwere the Americans and the British and I was so happy I said, \"Ah, they listed to Horthy,\nso they all here now. We are finished.\" And then Mr. Marentchic took me in his arm and\n> Annette Tilleman Lantos\n\u00b0 British Broadcasting Corporation\nhe said, \"Go home and God bless you. Horthy was arrested, and these are not the\nAmericans and British. These are the Russians \u2014 these are the Germans \u2014 excuse me, the\nRussians came after. So I ran home and my father's only words were, \"You were right.\"\nAnd funnily enough, we were not collected from our houses. We heard that we have to\nput on a star, so we did that. We didn't go out much on the street, but we still were not\nrestricted. Nothing! But they came in and immediately we heard that many, many, many\npeople were taken and we still were not even touched. Nothing! Whether we were lucky,\nI don't know but we were in the house until \u2014 and it was bad because my very best friends\nlived very far from us and I missed them. We still had our telephones. The radios still\nworked. So we were watching because I had a big, big radio so you can hear the whole\nworld and that's how we knew the news, what's coming in from all over.",
        "A: There were plenty food in Hungary. Don't forget, it's an agricultural country. Even\nthrough the whole Germany, nobody was every hungry. Food there was plenty, and the\nshops \u2014 it was still lit up because the bombing didn't start so we had plenty of lights. But\nwe didn't go out much. We were afraid. And you also never know what moment they ring\nthe bell and they take you. So we sort of were prisoner of our own apartment, but we\nwere still safe \u2014 amazingly safe. But every day there was a new announcement in tele\u2014 in\nthe radio. For instance, suddenly the Hungarian Nazis were \u2014 who were worse than the\nGermans \u2014 that was the Arrow Cross \u2014 so they \u2014 when the Germans came in, they said,\n\"The Arrow Cross can take over.\" Now what we heard \u2014 we didn't see \u2014 you see what\nwas the problem was that the Jewish people in Hungary didn't believe. We didn't believe\nlike here they didn't believe that people are taken away to gas chambers. We just didn't\nbelieve it, that anybody can put out from the apartment, that anybody can be taken away.\nWe couldn't understand it. So today when the people tell me, \"Why the Americans didn't\nknow?\" But they couldn't understand it either. They were much further than we were. We\nwere right there, and it was something \u2014 it's impossible. But then suddenly some\nCzechoslovakian friends arrived. Rumanian friends came down. They took everything.\nBut somehow they managed to come away. Then we started to realize \u2014 started to be\nafraid that any moment anyone....\nLetters still arrived from Europe, and I had a correspondence with a Swedish gentlemen\nfor a long time because in a long time in Hungary when you were a girl, who spoke lot of\nlanguages and you were a girl scout, then they asked you to be a guide for tourists. And\nas I spoke lot of languages, once I was a guide for a whole Swedish group. And the one\nSwedish man started to write. He has written for years and years. We were\ncorresponding. I didn't think of anything. I was young and I had a lot of young men\naround me and all that so I just thought, \"How nice. This nice Swedish man never forget\na young kid. And actually he saved my life before Raoul, but I didn't know that then. So\nin any case one day \u2014 that was very frightening experience \u2014 finally, the bell rang. And I\nlook out and there is a German soldier standing outside. And I look back at my parents.\nWell, we couldn't not open the door, but then I looked again. I said, \u201cOh, my God, I know\nhim.\u201d When I was in Berlin in 1936, we exchanged cards and he happened to be one of\nthe soldiers coming to Budapest. And my name evidently didn't mean a thing \u2014 that a\nMandl could be German. He didn't think I was Jewish. And I said to my parents, \u201c\u201cWhat\nshall I do?\" He said, \"Well, you have to open the door.\" He didn't want to come in, thank\nGod. He just said would I show him Budapest? And I was afraid if I say, \"No,\" or, \u201cWhy\nhe was sent here?\u201d It was a very bad feeling so I turned around to my parents. I said, \"I'm\ngoing to show him Budapest.\" And I went out. All I heard is my father said, \"Be careful.\"\nI said, \"Yes.\" What else could I say? So I went and everything went alright for about an\nhour and then we came to a synagogue and he stopped me there and he said, \"You see.\nThat's where I'm going to kill everybody.\" So now I didn't know whether I should open a\nbig mouth and tell him who I am or shall I ask a question. So I quickly thought, \u201cMaybe\nI'll ask a question.\u201d I said, \"Did ever a Jew hurt you? Did you know any?\" He said, \"I\nnever knew any.\" I said, \"Well, then, why do you want to kill people whom you never\neven met.\" He said, \"Hitler told me to do it, and Iam a German.\" So I quickly looked at\nmy watch and I said, \"Oh, you'll have to forgive me, but I have to teach English and I\nforgot that the time has come. Goodbye.\" And he let me go and I run. I never saw him\nagain. I have no idea what happened to him.\nBut it was a close call. Yeah, because I really didn't know how to behave. So then we\nwere all always frightened and then suddenly these two French gentlemen arrived with a\nnote who send them from Paris. The two French men arrived and they're not supposed to\nsay it, but they said they were French Underground and could we put them up in our\nhouse. Dad said we'd be delighted, but they were in and out and sometimes we didn't see\nthem for weeks. And they were wonderful. One was a peasant and one was a very learned\nyoung man. One was a Jew, one was a Christian. And they came to Hungary and one of\nthem fall in love with my wonderful girlfriend. He was unmarried. But they went in and\nout and they did wonderful things. I guess they were couriers between Rumania and\nHungary for the Allies and for France and it's a very exciting time you know.\nFrightening, but when you're young, all you can think, \"I have to survive. I have to\nsurvive.\" So now in the midst of all this, then came this announcement. The first day was\nthat any couples mixed marriages have to separate at once or the Christian party is\nbecoming a Jew and being killed. Well, within a half an hour, there were thousands of\nsuicides. It's a very easy way to kill people. And then they reversed it and they said we\nchanged our minds, but by that time thousands of people died. Thank God, my aunt and\nuncle called. My uncle was a grandson of a Unitarian bishop and he was a newspaper\nman and it was a wonderful marriage. And they called and they said they're going to\ncommit suicide. I said, \"No, you're not Uncle. Why don't you get some false papers and\njust disappear.\" Said, \"I never thought of this.\" I said, \"Well, then think.\" And they\nsurvived. He died after the war, natural death, both of them. But many of them didn't\nmake it. Then came the announcement that anyone who not having the Jewish religion\ncan be saved. They just talked you know. It was \u2014 nothing was now, but we loved to\nbelieve everything because we wanted to live. So in my house\u2014",
        "A: If you change, if you converting to another religion, then you're not counted. But was a\nlie, of course, you see. But we wanted to believe. So who arrived to my house? By that\ntime we had a wonderful new principal in my former school who became later on the\nProtestant Bishop of Hungary and he had six daughters and I was more in his house. I\nwas the seventh child, and he came to our house and he looked at my father, who was the\nsame age, but he called him \u201cUncle.\u201d He says, \"Let me baptize that child. She's my\nseventh daughter, and she knows as much about our religion as we do, and I want her to\nlive.\" And my father said, \"Yes.\" So we went to his tiny little church, and my father\nstarted to drive. And Pastor Berecky\u2019 said, \"Uncle Arnold, stop crying. I have full of\nJews down in that basement. If the Germans find out, we all be killed.\" And he baptized\nme more with his tears than with water. He cried so bitterly, and he hold me in his arms.\nAnd it was wonderful. And then he looked at me, says, \"Child, you do what you want\nafter the war. If you want to be a Jew again, go back to Judaism. But you are my child,\nmy seventh daughter. So it was a very emotional and very great thing and we went home\nand all his Jews were saved, I guess, who were down in the basement. And they made me\nout original papers and they signed for it. You know my birth and all that, that I was born\nas a Protestant. And I took all these papers with grace. What else can you do? And then\nthe next miracle happened.\nBy that time I used to write a lot of poems. I did that as a little child too. And we had one\nwonderful newspaper and I send him one what I wrote during the war. And suddenly I\ngot two little letters in the mail that morning. One was handwritten from the editor of this\nnewspaper and he very clearly just said \u201cDear Madam....\u201d Oh, that time I wrote under an\nassumed name and it was \u201cRolopa\u201d \u2014 what meant \u201cRome, London, Paris,\u201d and I took the\nfirst three names and that what it was. So he addressed it to \u201cMadam Rolopa,\u201d and he\nsaid that, \"I loved your poem but unfortunately the censor would not allow me to publish\nit. But I keep it with all my souvenirs.\u201d And I screamed and my mother was just in the\nbathroom, \"Why you screaming?\" I said, \"Mommy, Mommy. Can you imagine.\nHandwritten and he kept my poem! That's better than if they publish it.\" And I was \u2014 I\nhave his letter still. I was very proud. The second letter was a very \u2014 with little white\nletters, but within the back it said Swedish Embassy, Budapest. And I said, \"What does\n\u2019 Albert Berecky\nthe Swedish Embassy want from me?\" And I opened it up and they said, \"Could you\nplease come to the Embassy?\" And I was dumfounded. \u201cWhy, why \u2014 what do they want\nfrom me? And how do I get there?\u201d Because by that time you couldn't really get to any\nforeign embassies without probably being arrested on the street with my yellow star. So\nmy cousin that time dated a very wonderful Christian boy and he said, \"Well, what's the\nproblem? I'll take you.\" I said, \"How?\" He said, \"Leave it to me?\" And he arrived in a\nhuge big black Mercedes Benz, and he had the German flag on the front and he pushed\nme in there. And he said, \"Now, you're in. We can go.\" And he took me up. Nobody\nstopped us. How would they dare\u2014\n[Technical conversation]",
        "A: Okay. So my cousin had a boyfriend who was a Christian and he said, \"It's no problem.\nI'll take you up to the Embassy.\" And he arrived with a huge black Mercedes Benz. He\nhad the Nazi flag on it, and he had a Nazi uniform, and he was very rough with me. He\npushed me into the car and when I was in he said, \"So now, we can relax and I'll take\nyou.\" So nobody stopped us and I went. And then we arrived up there, it was \u2014 first, you\nknow it was very funny. I, I walked in and there was the Minister Danielsson.* He was\nthe Ambassador then and he looked up and said, \"Who is that Nazi?\" I said, \"He is not a\nNazi. He just brought me up here.\" He says, \"Clever,\" you know, \u201cbut you never know.\u201d\nAnyhow, he and the Hungarian First Secretary, whose name was Mr. Mezey\u2019 \u2014 he was\nthen the Secretary there \u2014 they needed somebody who speaks Hungarian. And they took\nme in and they told me first that they want to tell me the story about the wonderful\nDanish king who stood up for the Germans. He said that, \u201cI don't know any Jews. I only\nknow Danes.\u201d And he put on a yellow arm band and I was so stunned because we didn't\nknow all this, you know. And after he told me that story then he told me about King\nGustav the Fifth,'\u00ae the Swedish King, who had told all the people in Sweden \u2014 and he\nblew that up as big as this, you know, on the walls all over Sweden \u2014 \u201cAnyone who has\nfamily, friends, business associates in Hungary, would they come to the Foreign\nDepartment and we will help.\" And I said, \"Yeah, but why do you call me?\" And he says,\n\"That's my point now. You have a fianc\u00e9.\" And I looked at him. I says, \"I have a what?\"\nHe said, \"You didn't know?\" I says, \"No Sir.\" I told the truth. I didn't know I have a\nfianc\u00e9. He said, \"Well, your fianc\u00e9 immediately went to the foreign department and he\nsaid, \"If the war wouldn't be on, she already would be my wife. So she is Swedish and\nplease take care of her.\" And I stood there, you know, and I, I was frozen. I had no words\nand I said, \u201cI, 1 am a Swede? And he said, \"Yes.\" And we go make your papers. And I\n* Ivan Danielsson\n\u201d D\u00e9nes von Mezey\n' Oscar Gustav Adolf\nsaid, \"Oh, my God.\" \"And that's not all. You're going to stay with us on the Embassy.\"\nAnd I said, \"Oh no, no. I can't do that. I have my parents.\" He said, \"Well, we will try to\nsave your parents, but first comes you. We are now responsible for you, and I need some\nchange of clothes and so on. You're going to stay here.\" I was stunned. So\u2014",
        "A: That young man whom we wrote the letter, letters for years. And I still don't know\nwhether \u2014 well, I will tell you, on the end. Anyways, my friend Steven, said, \"Well\nshould she come home with me?\" And I said, \"No, I think it's better if we send down to\nher parents. You, you can go home along and we send down one of our employees here\nand he will talk to the parents and we write the letter. So that's what we did. I felt first\nvery bad and, you know, conscious that I am just leaving my parents. But we are young,\nand I wanted so badly to live. And it was really a terrible thing maybe, but I just \u2014 I\nwanted to stay. And so this man went down and told my parents that what happened and\nmy parents said, \"Ah, that's wonderful.\" And they gave them the toothbrush and change\nof clothes and I for three weeks a guest of the Embassy. I had a wonderful little room\noverlooking the rose garden and I found out I wasn't the only guest in the place. First,\nthere was that famous Nobel prize winning professor, Szent-Gyorgyi,'!! who has found\nthe vitamin. He wasn't Jewish, but he was a stout anti-Nazi and they had to put him there.\nBut eventually the Germans were after him and so they gave him a new name like\nSwenson and a new lookout and they put him somewhere else and he left. But there was\nanother wonderful young woman with two little boys and she was German, married to a\nSwede, and she got stuck with the children in Hungary. And she went away after on the\nvery last train that could get back to Sweden. She left with the children. Later on we met\nin Sweden. So I wasn't alone there, you know, and found out there were other people. But\nthree weeks I was there, and in the three weeks the big bombing started. And they really\nstarted and they were day and night, and the German artillery was right above us and we\ncould see whole Budapest. We were in the Buda side. Have you ever been in Budapest?\nNo. A beautiful city and it was a pity to see how everything was bombed out, but it had to\nbe done and we were all hoping that the Americans come and then we be liberated.\nBut after three weeks we knew nothing. My dear friend arrived back with his Mercedes\nand demanded my return immediately. And the Minister said, \"Why?\" He said, \"Well,\nmaybe you don't know, but the Hungarian Nazi Party made every second house in\nBudapest now a Jewish house. Every second house has a big yellow star out because they\nthink that the Americans will not bomb because they don't want to bomb the Jews.\" Of\ncourse, that wasn't true. They bombed the Jews. They bombed the headquarters, but the\n'l Albert Szent-Gyorgyi\nChristian \u2014 from the Christian houses like where we were on with my parents, that\nbecame a Christian house, so my parents had to get out. And thank God, my grandmother\nhad a big apartment where my \u2014 my grandmother wasn't alive, but my aunt was there and\nher best friend who was also married to a Christian but he wanted to be with them, so he\nmoved in. And Steven came every day, so we had two Christians helping us. And that\nhouse became a Jewish house and he said, \"I have to come back because the Arrow Cross\ncomes every day and reading the list of people in that house and if I am not there, and my\nname is still on, then they would kill my parents.\" So they had a little argument and the\nMinister said, \"No, because we are responsible.\" And he said, \"Well, she's responsible for\nher parents.\" I just spoke I said, \"I'm going home.\" So then they said, \"Not with him.\u201d I\nshould go down in the streetcar and I should have one of the employees will go and sit on\nthe other side because they want to know exactly where I'm going. So I went down with\nthe promise that everyday when they allow us out \u2014 we were allowed one hour a day to\ngo out shopping or whatever \u2014 that I call and, thank God, the phones were still working.\nBombing or no bombing, we were lucky. The phones were working. And I did call up\nevery day. So I went down with this young man and when I got to the house I looked at\nhim and he did like this and he wrote a little note and he left. And of course, my welcome\nhome was not so good. I felt very guilty and the family didn't really like that I had three\nweeks of heaven, but I can't blame them. I mean, maybe I shouldn't have done it, but as I\nsaid I wanted to live. I mean you have only one life. But I was back home. And I called\nup every day and I think I wasn't down longer than a weeks and a half and I called and a\nHungarian secretary came Mezey and said, \"Agnes, you have to get up here at once.\nSomething new happened.\" And I said, \"I'll try, but I don't know how.\" He said, \"Well,\nmaybe you're friend will bring you up. Tell him we will not keeping you here.\" So when\nhe came I said, \"Could you just take me up once more?\" He said, But you're not going to\nstay there and jeopardize the family?\" I says, \"No, I'll come back.\" And I went up and\nthere was Raoul Wallenberg.",
        "A: Alright. So Danielsson and Mezey introduced him to me, and he spoke English and\nGerman, and I think he spoke German that time because I couldn't speak Swedish yet,\nand his first question was, \"Agnes, would you work with me?\" And I said, \"I'd be\ndelighted Sir, but I still have a Star.\" And they all started laughing. And I said, \"Why you\nlaughing? I can't run around in the streets.\" He said, \"You won't. We already have\nprepared papers for you.\" And the same day they send me all alone with the Star, but\nsomebody followed me from the Swedish Embassy to the police station where the police\nchief cut off my Star. I don't know what \u2014 how they bribed him. I have no idea. He never\ntold me, but they must have bribed the Hungarian especially because the war was\nprobably almost over in \u201844, and they wanted to be in good foot with the Americans.\nRight? They didn't know that the Russians are coming. So we all didn't know that that we\nare sold out, the whole Balkan, right? To the Soviets. Well, anyways he cried and I\nthought I was in Heaven already. I must be dead if this police chief is crying while he\ncuts off my star and I walked right back to the Embassy and I said, \"Here I am.\" He said,\n\"Okay. Second, go get your parents' apartment back.\" And I said, \"I beg your pardon,\nSir.\" And they laughed again. I said, \"You're laughing, but I have to do it.\" He said, \"I'm\nsorry. That we can't do it, but there is a new housing commission.\" You should have seen\nBudapest. I mean there were maids who used to work in houses. They walked in and they\ntook the former employers fur coats and everything and they walked for breakfast with\nbig furs and all that. They had no idea, you know. And they took all the apartments from\neverybody. Yeah? So he said, \"Get to that place and get your apartment back.\"\nWhat I didn't even remember, the apartment was written on my father's name, but I\nlooked at him by that time and I got \u2014 you saw right away my, my identification from\nthem. Actually, everybody in that time in Hungary needed an identification, even a shoe\ncleaner on the street, because otherwise you couldn't walk around. This was wartime.\nAnd so I got mine. You have them I think or you will have them. And I walked in with\nmy head absolutely high because now I was a Wallenberg girl. Okay? And I walked in\nand I sort of threw my paper to, to the head. I said, \"What can happen? Either he shoots\nme or not.\" And he looked at me awfully ugly and without a word he signed and gave it\nback to me. I said, \"Oh, oh. Raoul, whom did you bribe again?\" Something must have\nhappened. But I got out. Somebody I heard yelling, \"There is a bloody Jew going,\" but I\njust went with my head up right to my house. And I walk in and there is a \u2014 that was an\napartment building and the superintendent is there and I walk in and he was so stunned\nthat I am alive. You know they had no idea what happened to us. And I said, \"Hello,\" and\nhis wife started to cry because I loved her very much, but he was a leech. He lived on us\nfor years and he looks at me and he said, \"What do you want?\" I said, \"Here. My\napartment back!\" He said, \"My daughter already has that apartment.\" Whereby the wife\nsays, \"No, our daughter has already another apartment.\" So I don't know what he did to\nhis wife after, but I said, \"I like to have the receipt official.\" So he said, \"Well, you have\nto go to our lawyer and he should give it back to you.\" I said, \"Look, where is the lawyer\nliving?\" I went to the lawyer and as soon as I walked in, the lawyer looked at the paper\nand he saw it was official so not much he could do and he said, \"Yes, but that has a\nprice.\" And I thought, \"Oh, my God. If I have to give him money, I don't have.\" And I\nsaid, \"Well, what's the price?\" And he said, \"You will have to testify that I was so good\nto the Jewish people.\" They all wanted that by that time, of course, because whoever\ncomes in, they would have hanged them because they killed thousands of them on the\nstreets. I saw it myself one day this green shirt. There was a little boy of two years old\nwith a star, and he just \u2014 \u201cbang\u201d and killed him. No reason to kill a child of two years.\nBut he had a yellow star on, why not kill? So in any case, I promised him anything and in\nthe meantime my finger was like this [interviewee gestures] in the back. I, \u201cThe hell with\nyou all, just give it to me.\u201d So I walked back to the house. Now he couldn't say anything,\nbecause the lawyer signed. So we go upstairs and I had a very horrible feeling, \u201cWhat\nwill I find?\u201d\nI found an empty apartment except we had a maid's room and the maid's room was\nlocked, and all that and we opened. All our stuff was in there, the paintings, the books,\nthe furniture, and for a moment I thought to myself, \"Gee, He isn't as bad as I thought,\"\nuntil he opened his mouth and he said, \"I'll get even with you yet.\" But I figured the \u2014 in\nthis ball game, the ball 1s now in my park. And I got my telephone back within a day and\nI had our apartment back and I had a telephone, so I was in constant contact with Raoul\nand everybody else. Now I wanted my parents badly to get out of that house. And I went\nto the house \u2014 to the Jewish house, and I screamed up. I shouldn't have done it, but I was\nso excited. I said, \"We got the apartment back again, the apartment back.\" In the\nmeantime, Raoul, as he promised, he got my parents some papers. They're not supposed\nto come out of that house, but I said, \"Out! Out! Home!\" And I took them out. I missed\nthem and also my cousins. Her mother couldn't come then. I don't know where she was.\nAnd I took them all out. My cousin had papers from Salvadorian papers and the Swiss\nfamily helped her so we all went home. And then we started the big work with Raoul\nWallenberg. That time I was\u2014",
        "A: Nothing! All I knew is that there is a young man and I said to myself, \"What is he\ndoing?\" And first I think and that was the feeling that he thought it was an adventure. But\nhe found out in one day, half a day, that this wasn't an adventure. This 1s something that\nyou need. And he was a most fantastic organizer. A quick thinker! His first question was\nfrom \u2014 he had one friend and that was Per Anger, whom I don't know if you interviewed\nyet, but Per Anger was then the First Secretary of the Embassy. And he was an old friend\nof Raoul and he asked him the first moment, \u201cWhat have you done for the people here?\u201d\nBecause it was not only Jews, but it was also anti-Nazi, aristocrats, and Christians, whom\nhe had to help. It was not just the Jews, but mostly. And they said, \"We have given out\n800 real passports.\" Now that was what I had, too. And Raoul was beside himself. \u201cTwo\nhundred \u2014 two \u2014 2,8000 \u2014 no, 280,000 people, you give 800 pass-passports? Well, that's\nnothing.\u201d And from the first day on, he actually took over the whole embassy. The\nMinister didn't like it very much because after all, he was a diplomat and he was nothing.\nAnd when he asked him \u2014 he came as a third secretary \u2014 he had to have a diplomatic\npassport because otherwise, he couldn't travel. And he said, \"Mr. Danielsson, you'll have\nto understand that when you go and argue with the people, you speak as a diplomat. I\ndon't.\" And that's how he wanted. He was like a devil.\nYou know to us, he spoke like the greatest brother, like a little child, and he was full of\njokes all the time. And when we were a little bit down, then he would come up with jokes\nor he would imitate Mussolini!\u201d or he would imitate Hitler or Eichmann.!? Whatever he\ncould make us laugh, he made us hysterically laugh because that was his whole nature.\nWhat he felt inside, we don't know because he never showed. The only thing I knew that\nhe was deathly afraid and that was the bombs because that he couldn't hide. But we all\nwere afraid from that and he said now, \"Whatever happens,\" because when the\nAmericans come, when they bombed, it went all the way through to the basements. When\nthe Russians came the two floors upstairs disappeared. One was our apartment. It's not all\nbombed out you know, but with the Americans it went, and it didn't matter whether it was\nthe Jewish house or the Christians houses. Bombed! And that was it, and the British too.\nBut Raoul took over immediately. And Budapest is a small town and it was like a\nwildfire that there is some \u201cangel\u201d who is here to help. So the Jewish Community and\nthose of anti-Nazi Christians, they all came and Raoul \u2014 in two days we had 350 people\nhelping. And we didn't get paid as you always hear, \"He's a paid employee.\" Nobody was\npaid. We were paid because we had our wonderful identification, but quite a lot from our\n350 people died and were taken and were killed, so those who were \u2014 we were lucky.\nSome of them didn't kill. Not because that they all say that that was saved their lives. It\ndid not save our lives. It was a part of our work with him. We belonged to the embassy.\nAnd it was funny because the embassy only had 12 employees and Raoul had 350 in\ndays, but he needed it. And in no time, he opened a hospital and he was looking. There\nwas lots of doctors who were hiding. He found them, and they worked for him and the\nRed Cross nurses and the other nurses, and many of them died and many of them lived\nand helped him \u2018til the last moment. But he was, he was never for a moment without\nthinking, \u201cwhat can I do next?\u201d\nAnd he was like a machine, you know \u201cGo! Go! Go!\u201d And so all of us became like this. I\nalso slept sometimes one or two hours a night because there was no time. We always had\nto do something because there were always something new what Eichmann was thinking\nof and especially the Arrow Cross. So not only that we had these helpers but we had quite\na few very rich people and they offered Raoul their houses. So we did in two weeks \u2014 we\nhad about 60 houses on the two sides of the Danube, Buda and Pest, where the Swedish\nflag went on and we had Nazi-clad, Nazi-clad Hungarian, Jewish boys standing outside\ntaking care of the houses and nobody could step in because it was a Swedish territory.\nAnd Per Anger writes it in his book and he says that at that time \u2014 because in Hungary,\nthey always made jokes whether there was a war or not \u2014 that the Swedish government\nwas the greatest landlord in Hungary at that time. And we had those houses and it was\ngood because our offices had to move every day because they were after us. Eichmann\n'2 Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini\n'S Adolf Eichmann\nwas after Raoul all the time, but he was not afraid from Eichmann. He invited him for\ndinner, and then he forgot about it, and he had to call the Swiss Embassy \u2014 a Swedish\nguy, and he said, \"Do you have any wine and food? I forgot I invited Eichmann for\ndinner.\" But he not only invited Eichmann for dinner. He asked one of the Jewish helpers\nto serve him so it would be fun to see how he reacts to somebody with the yellow star.\nAnd we did it because it was fun. Raoul wanted it. But at that time we were already\nbombed heavily, and Raoul had shirt open, and this guy here arrived with all the guns\naround him, but he couldn't kill Raoul on the Swedish territory you know.",
        "A: Eichmann.",
        "A: With, with a soldier and all that. And Raoul \u2014 it was already no light, we had only\ncandlelights \u2014 and Raoul opened the windows and it was the whole Budapest was\nburning. And he said, \"Eichmann, look out. Look what you're doing?\" And Eichmann\nsaid, \"They deserve it.\" He said, \"Stop talking and stop killing the people. You didn't\nwin. The Germans lost, so give up.\" And Eichmann said, \"No, I will not give up and my\nonly thing is that you are in my way.\" And Raoul very quietly said, \"But I am not enough\nin your way.\" He just didn't take it seriously. And then Eichmann left. But he had to have\nhis say and he had to show it to him, you know. I wish he would be there when Eichmann\nhad to be hanged or whatever they did to him. Unfortunately, he probably doesn't even\nknow about it. So any case, it was wild because I was for awhile \u2014 I was just hostessing,\nyou know, because thousands of people came up to us for the Schutz-pass'* what was\nalso his design. He designed \u2014 first, he went to the Hungarian and said, \"Are there still\ntrains going between here and Sweden. I'd like to take the Jews off your hand,\" he said.\nAnd they said, \"Yes, Mr. Wallenberg. You can take 5,000 people.\" So he came back to\nthe Embassy. He says, \"5,000 and they will never allow me another one.\" So that's no\ngood. So then he designed this Schutz-pass. And, of course, with 350 people we had\nmillions of families and friends who collected the pictures, signed, and Danielsson, the\nMinister sat and signed each of them. Now I am afraid you will hear many times they\nsaid they were fake papers. Not one of them were ever fake. If they say it was too many,\nyes, because then eventually we were allowed to make 10,000 of it, but we probably\nmade 50,000 of it. Alright? But they were not fake because everyone of them 1s signed by\nthe Swedish Minister. What was fake was the Polish gentlemen who already did his three\nyears Underground in Poland and he had a little printing machine and he figured he will\ncome to Hungary and see what he can help there. And there he had Raoul Wallenberg.\nAnd he found one of his passes and he duplicated it and he signed \u201cDanielsson\u201d and\n'4 Protective pass (German)\nsome people found it. And they called Raoul, and Raoul met him and first very angry. He\nsaid, \"You can't do that.\" But then as typical Raoul, he looked at him, he said, \"But if you\ncan save one single life, go ahead and do it.\"\nSo very many people got away with the fake papers because they looked so much like\nRaoul's, and some of them died with the real one and died with the fake one. But it was\nnot Raoul's papers. They were not fake, you see. And these people just don't understand.\nHe did. Also, they say he gave us passports. He never gave passports. It was a pass, and\nthe pass and if you will read my book, you will see it. I have it translated. The picture of\nthe person is on there, with the signature, and it says, \"The above, the bearer of this paper\nis protected by the Swedish Government and all his belongings.\u201d And if and when we\ncollectively can go to Sweden, then they will be going and then in Sweden in 14 days this\npaper will be invalid. It doesn't say anywhere it's a passport. It doesn't say anywhere that\nhe can take his star off. It just says he's protected by the Swedish government. And then\nwhen these people had to be shifted out of their houses, then Raoul just picked them up\nand in these 60 houses we put them in. These were our safe houses and it was not\ncomfortable, but they had food and they had medicine and they had Raoul Wallenberg.\nRaoul came there every day and visited everybody when he had time because he had to\ngo in the meantime on the road. Now, on the road he didn't take us girls. He took the Red\nCross and he took some of the diplomats. And by that time he called up the Swiss\ndiplomat and said, \"Help me. We need some help. We need you people doing this.\" So\nthen we got the Swiss involved. We got the Portuguese involved. We got the Papal\nNuncio involved very nicely. And so he had enough men to go with him including\nThomas Veres, who was always with him. He was a young boy with a camera hidden and\nhe made all these pictures. And he also saved the life of Raoul a couple of times because\nthey were sitting and he's photographing and suddenly he sees a German aiming at Raoul\nand he would shout, \"Raoul, jump. They're killing you.\" And Raoul jumped into the car\nand they left. But he went out after the people all the way to the Austrian border to get\nthe people back. With lies, with complete lies, because they heard about it. As I said, it\nwas the coldest winter and they marched the people and I don't know \u2014 and you said,\nyou've never been in Budapest. Between Vienna \u2014 the border and Budapest, that was then\na five hour car ride, and they were walking these people in the snow without shoes.\nChildren, sick people, old people, and they died, and people trampled over them. And\nRaoul was beside himself. So he went on the road and one day Per Anger had met him\nand Raoul had \u2014 have we finished?",
        "A: Okay.\nTape #2",
        "A: Yes. I was telling that Raoul went after these people all the way to the Austrian border.\nBut one of these occasions he had Per Anger with him too, and he had a big black book\nand on the way to the railway station, he stopped and screamed at the Nazis in German.\nHe spoke perfect German. \"How dare you are taking our people. They're all our protected\npeople. And all of those people, who have my papers turn around.\u201d And one of my very\ngood girlfriends from here now, she said, \"Well, what can happen? They'll kill her\nanyhow.\" She turned around. She didn't have any paper \u2014 and her sister and her mother.\nAnd \"Get on the truck.\" Okay? And then he started to open his black book and started to\nread names like a machine gun. And people caught on, those who could still walk and\nthey walked up whether that was their name or not, and he brought about thousand\npeople back to Budapest to these safe houses. And on the way home, Per Anger said to\nhim, \"Raoul, I didn't know we have a black book and you have names? When did you do\nthat?\" And Raoul started hysterically laughing and he said, \"I'll show it to you when I\ndone it.\u201d And he opens it up and not one single name. Nothing! But that was his idea. He\nhad to do something. He had to save people. And the same thing, he had drivers licenses\nand insurance papers, whatever he could find in Hungarian, what the Germans couldn't\nread. And he took it all the way to the train and he demanded to open the doors and he\nyelled to the people, \"I have your papers here. Get out, Mr. So and So.\" And there to\nsome people, you know, \"Aw, maybe we can get away.\" And he handed them \u2014 some of\nthem got the Schutz-pass, not with their name, but who cares, you know. And insurance\npapers and tax papers. You name it. He brought them back. But I don't know if you saw\nthe film. There was one and that was the truth that he took home thousands and in the\nmeantime they killed another thousand and you could hear it, but you can't save\neverybody. He always played with his own life because he can be killed any moment, but\nhe didn't care. He just wanted the people. Once he was about 250 young men was taken\nand they were told that they will clean up Budapest from the bombing and he knew\nexactly that's not true. So he went after them, again just with two of his colleagues, and\nagain a lot of paper and this Nazi looks at him and he knew who he was and he said,\n\"Wallenberg, if there is one man who doesn't have a paper, I kill him on the spot.\" And\nRaoul looks at him and said, \"That's fine. You can kill him.\" And from the 250, 249\nalready down, everybody had the paper and one give him eye contact with Raoul. Was a\ndoctor, and he is in this country today. And Raoul understand immediately. He had no\nidea what the man's name is and he says, \"Johnny, you left your paper at my desk again.\"\nAnd he handed him a paper and off they went.\nYeah? But he always \u2014 he came up with stories that, that you wouldn't believe that\nanyone can do. Now we had this hospital already. And also it was full of patients and\nalso full of doctors and nurses, and it was cold. It was already a very, very snowy day in\nthe beginning of December, or end of November, and Raoul had one wonderful thing\nwhat I could never learn. He remembered names, and once he had your name he would\nnever forget. I forget it in five minutes. He never made a mistake, to call me Ava and\nsomebody else Aggie. He knew who was Aggie and he knew who was Ava. No mistakes.\nSo what he wanted to do \u2014 the Hungarian Nazi party, this horrible Arrow Cross, they had\noffices in every section of the city. And he send out some little spy to learn every officer's\nname to be sure that he gets the right people. And he never forgot those names, and he\nknew which one in which section. One day he comes to the hospital in this horrible snow\nand he was unshaven and probably hungry. Who knows where he was, saving people.\nAnd he comes in and he finds three little Hungarian punks. I mean punks because they\nwere 12 and 13 year old analphabets, but they gave them the gun and they said, \"Kill.\" If\nyou tell that to a 12 year old, \u201cKill, then you won't get punished for it.\u201d Why not? So here\nthey stand with the gun and the doctor's hand is up and the patients are shaking and Raoul\n\u2014 I was there, it so happened on that day \u2014 and Raoul had to think very fast, and he hit\nthese three kids. I've never seen anybody hitting so strong. Then he doesn't speak\nHungarian. Only a few words, and somehow he managed to tell them in half German and\nhalf Hungarian, \"Get out of here. You are in a Swedish territory.\" And, of course, the\nguns fell to the floor. So we had three guns in no time. And he said, \"Get your officers in\nhere.\" These three boys ran out. I mean, they were little kids and they were frightened\nbecause he was just powerful. In three minutes, an officer walks in, a Hungarian, and\nthey all spoke some German. And our Raoul as quiet as nothing happened, looked at his\nwatch and says, \"Simon, what took you three minutes to get here?\" And the guy looks up\nand says, \"How'd you know my name, Mr. Wallenberg?\" He knew. And Raoul pushed up\nhis shoulders and he said, \"I know everybody's name and besides you are in big trouble.\"\nHe says, \"I am not in trouble. You are.\" He says, \"No, you are because by mistake you\nkilled a Gestapo officer, and they're looking for you.\" \"No, I never killed anyone.\" \"Yes,\nyou did. He died here in our hospital. And before he died, he asked us to call the\nheadquarters and your name is up at the headquarters. They're killing you. So get out and\nbring me what I ask you. Medication! And maybe I will help you.\" Without a word the\nguy ran out. And all of us looked at Raoul, you know, and the doctor start laughing. He\nsays, \"Raoul, what the hell did you just do?\" And Raoul says, \"Nothing. Nothing.\" He\nsaid, \"How did you know it was Simon.\" He said, \"I didn't know he was Simon, but that's\nthe name of the officer there and we were lucky. It was Simon.\" And then the doctor\nlooked at him again and he says, \"Raoul, I never had a Gestapo officer here dying.\" He\nsaid, \"Naturally not, but he killed so many people one of them could have been.\" You\nsee, now that was the way he saved. It could have been a trouble for him at all times. He\ndid the same thing when he saved 70,000 people.\nWe had a ghetto. A real ghetto. And that was just about on the end when the Russians\nwere already outside the outskirts of Budapest and Eichmann laughed many times, \"Kill\neverybody,\" and they put up the guns. Now by that time, we had quite a few Nazis who\nwanted to save their life and the Hungarian Arrow Cross and they helped Raoul and one\nof them came to him one day and he said, \"Go immediately. Eichmann put up the bombs,\nand they're going to kill the 70,000 people.\" And Raoul says very quietly, \"Oh, gosh and\njust our two Red Cross girls are in there delivering medicine and food.\" He says, \"Get\nback to your headquarters and tell them that the Germans called off the killing.\" And now\nit's not like in the film. In the film, he went himself to them. But it's not so. We were all\nin the office and like a little child he says, \"Now, listen to what I'm going to do.\" He\npicks up the phone and with his gorgeous German, he calls the headquarters, and he said,\n\"This is Lieutenant Krauss(ph).\" Okay? \"I want to talk to\u201d \u2014I think Veesenmayer!? was\nthe General's name. I can't remember it. And in the meantime, he constantly looks at us,\nyou know, and we all started laughing because he just made a joke. And when the\nGeneral came to the phone, he said, \"This is Wallenberg.\" Of course, he couldn't hang up\non him. And he said, \"I really astonished what you are doing. I understand you are a very\nhighly decorated First World Officer. How can you take it on your conscious to kill\n70,000 innocent people, plus my two Swedish girls who are in there now?\" Whereby he\nmust have answered, \"Eichmann ordered,\" because our Raoul said, \"Eichmann? Didn't\nyou know he left town? I had lunch with him yesterday.\" That was a complete lie. Now\nyou can imagine. Eichmann could have stood right beside that general, but he has to risk\nit because there were 70,000 people\u2019s lives on the line. Whereby he answered, \"I didn't\nknow.\" He said, \"Alright. Then, I order you to call off the killing, because if not then I as\na diplomat promise you that you will be hanged before your officers.\" He hung up. In two\nminutes, he called off the killing. And we have quite a few old people today like that who\ncame to this country. They didn't know until today who saved them.\nSo you see, his life was all \u2014 what he was there. He was lying. He was cheating. He was\nbribing. But that was the only way. He did millions of things. I mean by that time we had\nour guns too and he dressed his boys up. They took \u2014 the Arrow Cross came in and took\npeople out of our safe houses through the basement and they went. So Raoul turned to\nour young boys and he said, \"You have the Nazi uniforms.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Get dressed. Get\ndressed.\" \"Where we going?\" He said, \"You're going after them and bring them back.\"\nThree or four boys went screaming at the German. They all spoke German, and they said,\n\"We have to take them to the Headquarters.\" \"No, we have to take them. You have phony\npapers.\" And the Germans said, \"No, I don't have.\" \"Yes, that's a phony papers.\" Took it\nfrom him. \"Turn around. We go.\" So these poor people, they didn't know where they\ngoing and then finally, one of these littlhe Hungarian came up to somebody and says,\n\"Don't worry. We are the Wallenberg people.\" And they took them all back. Now we had\nphony papers. We had real papers, too. But you see this \u2014 you have to do everything so\n'S Edmund Veesenmayer\nfast. Now, it was not always easy. His big, big heartbreak was when he had an orphanage.\nHe had two orphanages but in the one, we had 79 children. And, of course, Raoul visits\nthere bombing time and he picked up those crying kids and he would start making animal\nnoises and telling them stories just to calm them down. And the kids were talking,\nlaughing and forgot that the bombs were falling like crazy because that was Raoul. And\nhe visited them as much as he could. Not every day because he had to go out to the\nAustrian border and who knows where. But he came to the children as much as he could,\nalways with candies in his pockets and with just to make the kids happy. He was a clown\nwithout the nose and everything, you know. And one day he arrived and found the\nchildren all dead. We found out from the guard \u2014 was a young boy, who was also shot,\nbut thank God it went in his shoulder, so he could tell the story. They came in. Young,\nyoung, young, 13, 14 year old kids and started to just shoot the kids. One little boy went\nunder a chair because his mother taught him before they parted and he thought his mother\nwas dead and Raoul found the little boy walking on the street and said to him, \"Whenever\nyou get in trouble, get under a chair.\" And these damn Hungarians were so busy shooting,\nthey didn't even look under the chair. Just kill the kids. And one more was saved, because\nshe had scarlet fever and Raoul got her some Christian papers and she was in a hospital.\nSo those two kids were saved. The rest of it were all dead. They just killed them for fun!\nAnd this was the only time I ever seen Raoul Wallenberg down on his knees crying,\nbitterly crying. For about 10 minutes, he couldn't get to himself because killing children,\nthat was more than he could take. And then suddenly he got up, and he was again like\nseven foot tall, and said, \"We're not going to stop fighting. I want to save this nation. I\nwant the children to make peace in this world.\" And he went on fighting.\nAnd it must have hurt him so badly. And I do hope you will have a chance once to invite\nthat wonderful young lady who has been saved because of scarlet fever. Twice she was\nsaved by Raoul, and she is now teaching in Mercer College. She's teaching humanities\nand languages. And you should have her. I will give you the address after. She's a\nmarvelous person. So in any case this was the two people. And then Raoul was out again,\nwhen we heard that they shooting people into the Danube River. And it was December,\njust before Christmas. And what the Hungarians did \u2014 1t was no snow \u2014 it was a no stars,\nonly heavy snowing and the Danube, the first time in 40 years was really frozen with\nhuge icicles. And they thought this is the best time to kill people because nobody will\nlook for them and in the dark and they were cowards these, these Hungarian Nazi men.\nBut Eichmann said, \"Do it.\" So what they did, they roped three people together and then\nthey shot the middle one and, of course, all three of them fell in and died. Some of them,\nI understand, swam out somehow and survived. But Raoul arrived home the third day to\nhear about that from wherever he was, and he was beside himself. \"What will Eichmann\ndo next? How can they do that to human beings?\" And this was the first time he turned to\nus and asked, \u201cHow many of you can swim?\u201d I was the only one with three other\ndiplomats, men, who put up my hand. I said, \"I was taught swimming in school. Let's\ngo.\" IT had no idea where we're going. So we went with our trucks on the other side. We\nknew where they were shooting on the right, and on the left. We turned off the motors.\nWe had hot soup and change of clothes and we were standing at the cave, and every time\nwe had to synchronize. When they shot we had to fall in too, so that the splash goes at the\nsame time. Not that the Hungarians had time to listen because they were so busy. They\nwere afraid they would be caught. So we \u2014 when they fell we jumped and thanks to the\nicicles the rope hang on to the ice, and we knew where there is a rope, there is a body.\nAnd we started to pull them out and then the nurses and the doctors were there, put them\nin, changed them. Fifty people we saved \u2014 what is nothing. But it's more than if we had\nno Raoul Wallenberg. We couldn't do more because we were all frozen so stiff that we\ncouldn't move anymore.\nAnd then that was over and then we had one more big thing. When they advertised \u2014 the\n\u201clovely\u201d Germans \u2014 that all the women between the age of 15 and 25 should go to such\nand such a palace next morning to clean up Budapest, we knew again that they will take\nthem right out of the country. So Raoul again turned to his 350 people and he said, \"You\nall have young friends and sisters and so on, so we got the pictures and we were working\nin the Buda side in a beautiful villa because as I told you we always had to move our\noffices and Danielsson was sitting there, the Minister, signed each one of these passes.\nAnd there was a curfew. No one, no Jews, no Christians, nobody was allowed out on the\nstreet. But what was so amazing that 1t was a most beautiful, moonlit night, cold like ice,\nbut moonlit. Why they didn't bomb us, nobody knows. Why they didn't come on that\nnight. Maybe they knew about this stuff, and they didn't. We don't know. The CIA\u2019\u00ae must\nhave been very good and the Scotland Yard. They didn't come. And suddenly Raoul\narrived around midnight. Again, he looked hungry and tired and unshaven, but he said,\n\"Are you all finished because by two o'clock we have to deliver all these passes?\" And so\nwe said, \"Yeah.\" And then he told us quickly a joke. He said, \"I don't want you to look\nup, but I want you to know that we have new neighbors in the next villa.\" And naturally\nwe all looked up. He says, \"Don't look up. Just work. It's only the German Headquarters.\"\nAnd he did like he didn't care. If Raoul doesn't care if the German has headquarters, why\nshould we, you know? I mean it was crazy. We were taken over by his strength. And it\nwas really a feeling, \u201cIf he can do it, then we should help him with everything.\u201d\nSo I was the lucky one who was first ready with about 500 of his papers and I \u2014 he\nembarrass \u2014 embraced me and he said, \"Be careful.\" And I said, \"Yes Sir, I will.\" And I\nleft. And I remember there was no one around. I went with the curfew. And I walked\nacross the bridge to Pest because all my people were on the Pest side. And it was a very\nemotional going because I had to ring some door bells and some friends of mine came to\nthe door and they said, \"Aggie, what you doing out?\" I said, \"Please don't ask. Don't ask.\n'\u00a9 Central Intelligence Agency\nJust take this. An angel sent it to you.\" And we kissed and cried and I went on delivering\nall 500. All I heard is my footstep on the snow. But no bombing. Nobody. So I went\nhome and finally I sit down on my bed and then it dawned to me what I just done. And I\nsaid to myself, \"Are you crazy? You could have been killed.\" Then like Raoul\nWallenberg would say, \"Get killed? No way. Because the Hungarians and the Germans,\nthey're cowards. They wouldn't be daring to be outside in a curfew.\" And I went to sleep\nwith nothing. I woke up at six o'clock in the morning that my two girlfriends were thrown\nout of the camp because of the pass. And they ran all the way to our house because they \u2014\nactually they spoke more German than Hungarian because they were from Berlin. But the\nGerman officer picked up their German and said something very ugly to them in German\nwhat they can do with the paper. But the kids made one look at him and they turned\naround and started to run and he never shot after them. He let them run. So the paper had\na big \u201csomething.\u201d We don't know what Raoul did really. If you read a few books now,\nyou can put it together what really happened and what he did. But it was amazing. So my\ntwo girls friend are actually in this country. They are grandmothers, both of them. But\nthey lived. Okay? So it is incredible the things he has done. And then that was already\nChristmastime.\nI have never seen him again, because I got sick. Maybe it was partly the Danube, a little\nbit cold, but it was worthwhile. And we only found out after that evidently I had a\nnervous breakdown. But it didn't come out only in the afternoon when I got a bit excited.\nI ran a big fever and there were no doctors to get. They were either hiding or being out on\nthe front or they were Nazis. But my super said he will find me one. And he came to the\nhouse and he said, \"Ach, just a little cold.\" And that is not funny. It was a needle what\nyou give for animals, but neither my mother or me knew to, and he said, \"I give her\nsulfa.\" And very smilingly, he gave me the sulfa, and five minutes after he left, I was in a\ndeep coma. And my mother was in a panic and the phones still worked, so she called\nthere. The super promised me that one of these days he'd get rid of me, but it didn't work\nyet. He tried it once more. Anyway, Mother called a friend and the friend found a doctor.\nAnd the doctor came and he asked my mother what happened and Mommy said, \"He left\n\u2014I don't know what happened. He left a needle there.\" And he says, \"Oh, my God. He\npoisoned that child. This is for an animal. You don't give that to people.\" Somehow they\nfound an anti-whatever. So it took a\u2014I got back. My mind stayed alright except I had\njaundice. So I was incapacitated. I couldn't get out. I never saw Raoul again,\nunfortunately. That was my end. And then the bombing really became so big and the\nbridges disappeared so we could not go. And that was \u201cpart one\u201d of this little life there \u2014\nvery exciting life. And then the Soviet arrived.\nAnd it wasn't better at all than the Nazis. If it's possible, 1t was even worse. Because they\njust picked people up from the streets \u2014 never mind who it was \u2014 and shipped them right\noff to Siberia. The officers arrived in American tanks and American boots. The soldiers\ncame all the way from Siberia barefoot. They were hungry. They attacked old women,\nyoung women. They only ones they saved were children. They loved children. They\nwashed their face in the toilet, and they made their business in the bathtub. We couldn't\nbelieve it that they were that primitive. Some of them stole the watches. They had\nwatches from here to here, and they came up to you and say, \u201ctick tock, tick tock.\u201d It was\nincredible. So it was not much better as what it was. And I had no idea what happened on\nthe other side, what happened to the legation until one day on a boat over came one of\nour lawyers who was a Czechoslovakian who worked with Raoul and he didn't tell me\nthat Raoul disappeared by himself. He didn't say anything. He just said that the whole\nlegation has been taken. And I assumed that Raoul was with them. I knew nothing. And I\nsaid, \"Where did they take them.\" And he said, \"Debrecen.\" Debrecen was the\nheadquarters of the Russians. And he said, \"Do you want to help them?\" And I looked at\nhim and I said, \"Yeah. How could I help?\" You know I was all excited. And he said,\n\"Well, you have to go to Rumania.\"\nAnd my parents right away, \u201cNo, she's not going anywhere.\" I said, \"Wait, Mommy. Let\nPaul!\u2019 tell me what he wants.\" I said, \"Why Rumania?\" He said, \"Because Rumania is\nalready occupied by French, British, Russian, and Hungarian, and that is the only\navailable embassy, Swedish embassy in the whole Balkan, and somebody has to go there\nand ask that Ambassador to help this one.\" And I said, \"Can I go? How?\" He said, \"Well,\nit's very easy because the Rumanians are now allowed to repatriate. So if you became a\nSwede legally, now you can become an illegal Rumanian. Just don't open your mouth\nbecause you don't speak Rumanian.\" I said, \"Well, that's great.\" So my parents were very\nmuch, \"No. No. No.\" I said, \"Mommy and Poppy, the Swedish government saved us. At\nleast what I can do, save them and Raoul. I mean what they have done for all of us.\" So\nthey knew that I have a hard neck and anything they will tell me, I will say, \u201cNo.\u201d So\nthey \u2014 Paul said, \"I'll come back in a couple of days, bring you the papers.\" Now how you\nget there? We had the same wagons as we had to deport the Jews. And we were \u2014 I was\ntold by a few people that some people are disappearing middle of the trip by the\nRussians. They take them to Siberia or they're ship back to Budapest. \"Do you still want\nto do it?\" I said, \"Yes.\" What else can you say? You have to try. So I had a knapsack, and\nI had a fur coat, what was my only warm stuff I had. And I had slacks and we had ski\nshoes what was on me for four months because it was so cold and we always went down\nto the basement. And it took us 12 hours before we even left the station. And you didn't\nknow who the other people were. You knew nothing. But in a little while everybody\nwarmed up. Everybody was hungry, so everybody came out with a little food so at least\nwe had eaten. But after six hours of trip they suddenly stopped. They said, \"Something\nwrong with the train. Get out.\" We didn't know where we were and again this feeling,\n\"Oops, we can be picked up by the Soviets now. What happened?\" But we were taken to\n'7 Paul Hegediis\na school and we slept in that school. There was room on the floor. It was cold, but\nsomehow when 30, 40 people sleep in one room, you don't even feel the cold anymore.\nYou were all dressed. And we were waken up in the morning that we're going on to\nRumania. And there were very lovely Rumanian soldiers up there and they spoke a little\nHungarian and German. And they explained to us that when we come to the front \u2014\nfrontier that Russian soldiers will come. And we were in a wagon with a lot of hay. He\nsays, \u201cI would like you to all go under the hay somehow and not a word. Please try not to\ncough. Try not to sneeze. Usually the Russians are drunk, but they will come in with the\nspotlight. And Good luck. We have to leave you on your own. And let's hope that you all\nmake it in to Rumania.\" So we did that and sure enough, we could hear them coming.\nsinging along. And they opened this heavy door and they skimmed through and nobody\ncoughed. Thank God! And they closed the door and we started to move and we couldn't\nbelieve we were in Rumania.\nNow, we arrived in a very small town where I had two wonderful girlfriends. One of\nthem was a baroness who was a great philanthropist, and I was hoping that she lived\nthrough all this and she did. And the other one was a girl who went to our famous Liszt!\u00ae\nAcademy of Music and she lived in our house and then she went back. \u201cMaybe in\nRumania there won't be any war,\u201d so she goes home. She lived too. And that's a long\nstory I don't want to get in. Anyhow, I met each of them, and then I told my friend,\nMarika,\u2019\u2019 that I have to go to Bucharest. And she said, \"Why?\" I said, \"I can't tell you.\"\nShe said, \"Well, I know you well enough. If you can't tell me, there must be a good\nreason.\" But nobody's allowed to go on, only in official capacity on these trains. I said,\n\"Could you find some official reason?\" She said, \"I will.\" The next day I got my police\nwhatever it was, to get to Bucharest. First class. Two Russian officers. And my stomach\nwent down. Both of them looking at me. One of them picks up the vodka, says in Russian\nto me, \"Drink.\" And I said, \"No.\" And he looks at me again, \"Drink!\" He took it to my\nmouth and I let it run. I was scared. I said, \"Now, for that I came out. Now I'm going to\nbe raped or who knows?\" I was frightened. So the one suddenly started to \u2014 \"You speak\nGerman.\" And I said, \"Yes.\" I said, \u201cUh-oh, now inquisition. Maybe he's thinking I'm a\nNazi or something.\u201d So they asked questions here and there in German. And he said,\n\"Are you Romanian?\" I said, \"Yeah. But I lived in Hungary.\" He said, \"What you going\nto do.\" \"I'm going to teach.\" Come out of my mind you know. In the meantime, the other\none is still looking at me. Finally, we come to Sinaia. That was a stop. And I said, \"I have\nto get off for fresh air.\" They let me go. And I come back, they were not there. The two\ncoats were there. No officers. So we were already moving and they still were not there.\nSuddenly, I see them coming, looking around and jumping in, closed the door. So inside,\nsomething told me that these are not just bad Russian officers. There must be something,\nbut I didn't ask. I didn't talk. Suddenly, the one in German started to talk to me again.\n'S Franz Liszt\n'? Baroness Marika von Neumann\nSaid, \"Are you Jewish?\" I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"So am I.\" And, you know, I look at him\nagain. I said, \"What you doing?\" He said, \"We are dissidents.\" So but I still didn't tell\nthem who I really was. And he said, \"We are trying to go to Israel. My friend doesn't\nspeak a word other. He's Christian. He's from, from Stalingrad\u201d \u2014 or I don't know where \u2014\nno, from Kiev and he was from Odessa, and they are friends. And he's a writer, the other\none and this is a doctor. And he said, \"We are trying to go to Israel. And we are going to\nRumania now. We don't know now, how, \u2014 what. Can we help you something there?\" I\nsaid, \"Yes, I will need a job. He said, \"We know everybody at the Joint.\" So I\u2014 you\nknow, I mean, it was incredible.\nSo we arrived there and they helped my parents a lot. They went back to Hungary and\nhelped my parents and then when my parents finally came out, they helped them through\nCzechoslovakia and my two girlfriends\u2019 mother. So they were very helpful. I don't know\nwhat happened to them. I have no idea if they ever found them or if they ever made it to\nIsrael. I have no idea. But it was a very interesting meeting and a couple of times we met\nin Bucharest. And they knew by that time that \u2014 but they didn't know who Raoul\nWallenberg was. I told them the whole story why I'm there. And the one of them \u2014 they\nsaid that \"We have written a book and I wish you could take it with you.\" And I was very\nexcited and I thought that was a fantastic thing because finally the outside world will\nknow because they have written exactly how bad the life is during Communism and that\nonly the top Communists had everything. They can go on travels and they have food and\nthe people just dying around them from hunger. So it would have been a terrific book to\ntake with me. But we hadn't left Bucharest. That's why. Finally, I was in Bucharest and\nthey helped me to get a very small job that I am enjoying, but they got me a room. And\nnext day I hailed a cab to go to the embassy. And the taxi driver also spoke German and\nHungarian and he asked me why I am there. \"Are you Jewish? And I said, \"Yes.\" \"So am\nI.\" And so we were talking for a little while and he said, \"It's a very dangerous place\nwhere we're going.\" I said, \"Why?\" He said, \"Because the Russian Embassy is just beside\nthe Swedish one.\" It's a gorgeous, gorgeous avenue. Beautiful, with all very rich people\nwho used to live there. And I said, \"Thank you.\" He said, \"I'll pick you up again.\" I said,\n\"No, that's not necessary. I'll get home.\" \"No. No. I will come.\"\nAlright. So anyway, I walk in and there's a secretary and she says, \"Why \u2014 what do you\nwant from the Ambassador.\" And I said, \"I'm sorry. I can't tell you.\" And she wouldn't let\nme in and I sat there \u2018til four o\u2019clock and so in the end she got so tired of me. She says,\n\"Look, I think you can go in now.\" So when I went in and he looks at me and he says,\n\"Why did you sit there all day and you didn't come in?\" And I said, \"Could I have told\nher why I came?\" And he said, \"No.\" I said, \"Well, now I'm here.\" So it was so exciting\nbecause he had his teletype machine and they were looking for all the people that Paul\ngave me. There was eight Swedes and all their families were looking for them and I could\ntell them, \"Yes, they are alive.\" And my fianc\u00e9 also was looking for me and I could tell\nhim, \"Here I am sitting with you.\" \"How did you get here?\" So I told him my wonderful\ntrip. He says, \"Oh, boy. You really made it. Now, promise me one thing. Don't carry\nHungarian papers. Don't carry Rumanian papers. Carry nothing but your Swedish paper\nwith you.\" And he gave me a new this is what you have now ts a new one, because the\nother one I don't even know what happened. So that's all I carried with me. And he said\nthey want me to go with them when they out and I told him exactly where it is. And in\neight days the whole embassy, minus Raoul Wallenberg was in Bucharest. He helped.",
        "A: I didn't. That was the Ambassador. But I told him where they are. So that's why Paul, that\nlawyer said, \"Go, and you're the only one who could help. You have to talk to the\nAmbassador.\" And what the Ambassador did I don't know. But as soon as they arrived, of\ncourse, it was a big crying and laughing. What else can you do you know. We all asked,\n\"Where is Raoul,\" and Per Anger said, \"Don't worry about him. You know he will come\nback.\" He never did. And then in about \u2014 yeah, and they were very nice. They said they're\ngoing to give me money every week. Something to help me out. But when I marry my\nfianc\u00e9, then he will have to repay the whole thing to the government. And I understood\nthat. I mean after all, they will take me with them. So there were seven Swedes and I \u2014 so\neight of us, and they were the 12 Embassy people. Finally, we got a call. We can leave\nand it was great excitement. And we all went out. The railway station is in Ploesti, the\nfamous place where they bombed it. And we were all there, and we were about to get on.\nThe Embassy people were already on and suddenly the Russian said, \u201cNyet,\u201d\u00b0\u201d for the\nother eight and we couldn't go. So we were let down you know. Thank God, my room\nwas not yet rented. So I went back and we stayed together as much as we could and also I\nwas told to be very careful because with the British and the French and the Russian and\nthe Hungarians, I can be any day taken to a prison and asked questions. And sure enough,\none day up comes a Rumanian. And he says, \"Papers.\" And I smiled like I don't know\nwhat he's talking about. He tried every language and I keep on smiling. You know I didn't\nknow what to do. You know I said, \u201cNow, should I get in trouble?\u201d So finally, he\nmotioned me to get into the police station and in the police station, they also talk\nRumanian only. I gave the Swedish paper. He didn't know what that was. And then\nsuddenly I asked for a pencil. You know, I showed him and he gives me and I put down\nthe Embassy's phone number. In about half an hour, the Ambassador arrived. He was\ngray in his face. He was so frightened, you know? And I was as quick thinking as Raoul.\nI knew a few words of Swedish. One was milk, that\u2019s \u201cmj\u00e9lk.?!\u201d \u201cTack sa mycket?\u201d\n\u00b0\u00b0 No (Russian)\n*! Milk (Swedish)\n*2 Thank you (Swedish)\nmeans \u201cthank-you,\u201d and \u201cbr\u00e9d?*\u201d is \u201cbread.\u201d And as he walked in, I started to throw these\nout at him, \u201cMyjo\u00e9lk, tack sa mycket. Brod, brod.\u201d And I went over and over and I could\nsee how his face started to relax, and he almost started to laugh. And, of course, these\nRumanians \u2014 and he talked something in Swedish to me and I talked back again. \u201cTack sa\nmycket,\u201d this and that. So they just let me go. And then we going out to the car and he\nsays, \"How did you come to that idea?\" I said, \"I'm a Wallenberg girl. Remember?\" I had\nto think fast. You would have never been....\u201d\u201d He was laughing all the way back you\nknow. He said, \"This is most incredible.\" I said, \u201cWhat else could I have done? They\nwould have pushed me either to Siberia or back to Budapest.\u201d So that was my whole\nknowledge of Swedish at that time. \u201cThank you, milk, and bread.\u201d But I got out from the\njail.\nAnd then we were called again that now we can leave and that we be careful, because we\nwill have a very, very great security and everything will be taken from us. So my two\nRussian friends came, \"Take the book,\" and I cowardly said, \u201cI don't dare because I\nunderstand they're going to do it.\" Said, \"Well, we understand.\" Not one thing was looked\nthrough. We just went by. But how do you know that before hand? You don't. And we\nwent on a \u2014 that was very interesting. We went on a South American \u2014 not South\nAmerican \u2014 South African military plane. And the side \u2014 we could only sit side \u2014 this was\nthe first time in my life I sat in an airplane, you know. And we sat on the sides where the\nbombs used to be there. And we had to fly to Bari, what was the headquarters of the\nBritish and the French and the Americans and the Indians and everybody. And we were\nthe eight Swedes, there was two Frenchmen, not my friends, but other two and there was\ntwo British. One was a big fat man with a [inaudible] case and he was holding on to them\nand he looked at us so ugly because one of the ladies \u2014 she was German, but she was the\nwife of a Swedish consul who died, she was a widow \u2014 and she and me, we spoke\nGerman. And what we didn't know that this man was from the Scotland Yard. No idea.\nBut he didn't like the German talking you know. He thought this was Germans who were\nrunning away. But we didn't know all this. And we were in \u2014 there was one young man\nwho also, only after\u2014",
        "A: The plane arrived. Okay. The plane arrived. You're right. I'm sorry. I open my big mouth.\nWe arrived to Bari. That was the military base for the Americans and the British. And we\nwent first to the British headquarters and they invited us to tea and they said that we are\ngoing into a hotel because the Swedes are paid for it. And we did not go in a hotel. We\n*3 Bread (Swedish)\nwent to a transit camp. \u201cNumber One,\u201d what was before for the Jews. From there they\ntook them to the gas chamber. Now it was for German prisoners, and for people whom\nthey didn't know what to do with. And it turns out that this man was from Scotland Yard\nand when he heard us talking German, he made up his mind that we were Nazis running\naway. We were four weeks in that place until they found us. But, as you said, we have to\ncondense. I can't tell you. We were there four weeks and it was most interesting,\nfascinating, all the things what happened. Then we got word that we can go up to Rome,\nand we got an American, wonderful American, young sergeant, who had a truck and he\ndrove us through Monte Cassino, and this I don't want to go in either. And he was singing\nall the way, like Paul Robeson, you know, in a gorgeous voice. He didn't sing in Monte\nCassino. None of us could. It was tragic there. But anyhow, he took us to Rome. In\nRome, we were another month, and from Rome we went, finally, to Switzerland. And\nfrom Switzerland, the old ladies were taken on an airplane and the Ambassador's\ngirlfriend who was a Hungarian Countess, she was flying there. And almost everybody\nexcept the lady who spoke German and this one Hungarian I think it would be the inner-\nminister\u2019s son, whom we only found out after that he worked for the Scotland Yard.\nDidn't even know that. Just he left to \u2014 so only one man, another man whose wife was\nSwedish, and this lady and I we stayed.",
        "A: Well, at this point, it was very exciting because I have a huge family there. And all I\nwanted to tell them this marvelous story about Wallenberg. First of all, they didn't want\nto hear anything \u2014 not about Holocaust. They weren't interested. And I kept on saying,\n\"But this is such a wonderful story.\" \"I told you we are not interested. And don't think so\nmuch about it. We don't have it.\u201d Switzerland had everything, but they didn't want it. So\nit was a very unpleasant four weeks when we got our marching orders that we can go\nwith the Norwegian Red Cross through Germany into Denmark and then from Denmark\nto Sweden. Well, the Swiss knew exactly that we had no food in Germany at all, and they\ntook everybody's food and everybody's money away. And I was very lucky. Again, I was\nall the way in the back. I went into the toilet and I took all my money and I put it in my\nshoe and I went back. So at least I had money. Food, they took away. So we went three\ndays and we didn't eat because there was no food in Germany no where. We went\nthrough Nuremberg. We went through whole lot of things, and then we arrived in this\nsmall town of Denmark and it's incredible. There was a whole village made up with\nmaybe millions of showers with hot water and food. You have never seen so much food\nin your life. We all got sick because we didn't \u2014 we couldn't eat that much, but the Danes\njust didn't know what to do because there were Norwegians who were stuck. And there\nwere Danes and there were Swedes and there were us, you know. They were incredible.\nOur drivers on the car \u2014 on the trucks by the way were Nazi prisoners, and I will never\nforget that, that nobody \u2014 all the Norwegians, the Danes, they spoke German. None of\nthem wanted \u2014 but they decided it is dangerous because all the signs through Germany\nnow in English and there are places where there are no bridge. Somebody has to do it, so\nI used to be the youngest. So they said, \"Will you speak to them in German?\" So I said,\n\"Do I have to?\" \"Yeah.\" So I sat with the driver and he still had the Swastika hanging\nthere. Today, I'm laughing about it. If he would have known that a Jew is giving him the\ndirections and the orders what to do, I think he would have killed us all. But it was fun.\nAnd we made tt.",
        "A: Sweden, I got in, in October. October four or five. And I first went to my fiance's mother.\nFirst, they wouldn't let me in and that's a long story. I'll tell you another day. And then we\nwent up for a weekend to Stockholm already together with his mother. And there was\ntwo gentlemen. He and another gentleman who met me, and they were greeting me with a\nfist like this and I said, \"What's that?\" And he said, \"Oh, don't you know? That's the\nCommunist's greetings.\" And my stomach went down again and I said, \"Huh?\" Tells me\nhis greetings, but I thought it was just stupid joke. Anyhow, next day, that was Sunday.\nMonday, I got in contact with everybody from the Swedish Embassy. My first question\nwas, \"Where is Raoul?\" \"We don't know,\" was the answer. And then I told them about\nmy fianc\u00e9 whom I have to marry, and I told them that I am very disturbed because he\ngreet me like that and you will have to understand that I cannot marry a Communist. And\nthey say, \"Well, we understand that, but after all, he....\" I said, \"Yes, I know.\" They\nfound out he was one of the top Communists. And what happened is that in Switzerland,\nI was interviewed by a friend who's a newspaper man. And, as usual, with newspaper\npeople, they go after their own head. I said, \"I'm going to Sweden.\" What he put down\nthat I'm going in Hungarian government business to Oslo. And even when the Embassy\nsaw it, \"Is she crazy? Well, what is this?\" So that wasn't true and so this fianc\u00e9 of mine\nthought that I am going from Communist business so he brought the chief of\nCommunist's party. Anyways, everything turned out. I didn't have to marry him. And that\nwas wonderful, you know. But in the meantime, it also turned out that he really wanted to\nsave me and he was in love with someone else. So it turned out alright that far. But I was\nthere and I very fast got a wonderful job with Count Bernadotte** who brought in from all\nthe camps the people they needed \u2014 people who go out and can speak France and German\nand Hungarian and tell them stories about Swedish literature and culture. And that was a\nvery wonderful thing to do because I had a key to the Royal Library because they had the\nbooks were translated from Swedish to German so I could read Selma Lagerlof and all\nthat. And I went and spoke for six months in all the camps. I was very well paid, and it\nwas also very wonderful. The people I met in these camps who came out so sick, and the\nSwedes took care so beautifully of them. So that was the \u2014 I was three years in Sweden.\n** Count Folke Bernadotte\nAfter this job, I worked for a Scandinavian bank and then I got frightened from the\nSoviets because everybody thought the Soviet going to overrun Sweden. Everybody was\nlearning Russian in Sweden. Children were \u2014 when they were naughty, they said, \u201cWe\ngive you to the Russians.\u201d And I got frightened. I just wanted freedom, and it was\nwonderful and I loved Sweden. And Raoul wasn't home yet, and we didn't know what\nhappened. Nothing we knew about it. And in the meantime, I brought my parents out.\nAnd I wanted to come to America and they wouldn't let me. They said American was\nclosed 12 years for Hungarians. So Australia let me, and I went all alone all the way to\nAustralia and left my parents behind in Sweden. And Raoul was still not back. And we\ncouldn't find him. We still didn't hear too much and still nobody was looking for him.\nActually, nobody cared. You never heard that word, \u201cRaoul Wallenberg.\u201d Then I came to\nthe States, and when I arrived to the States my parents went to Argentina. They lived\nthere for three years, and when I became a citizen, then they finally came here. And in\n1960, I got married and the first person ever listened and believed the Wallenberg story\nwas my husband. Three weeks on our honeymoon, I told him the story and he was crying\nfor three weeks. We want that man back, but we still didn't do anything.\nAnd then as you know, in the late 70s, Congressman Lantos\u201d and his wife started to look\nfor him. And that's how it all started. And now my job 1s strictly to let the whole world\nknow, especially children, that there is a hero outside. Because we don't have any heroes.\nAnd we don't teach our children. And the Holocaust is important. Not just because the\n6,000,000 Jews, because you know that Hitler killed 3,000,000 people who were priests,\nnuns, gypsies, blacks, and children in wheelchairs. Three million, that's Holocaust.\nTwenty three million young Russians. That's Holocaust. What's going on in South Africa\nis Holocaust. We don't teach it to our children. We can't live like that. Children have to\nknow what to fight for as Raoul Wallenberg did, because only the children without\nprejudice holding their hands, can make peace in the world. And this 1s the only way, and\nthat's what I am teaching. I cannot bring Raoul out. I have no authority for that. I let that\nlet the diplomats handle it. But he's teaching us to go on, \u2018cause he taught me too.\nAlright, I was in a family where nobody was ever prejudiced, but I learned that, like\nRaoul, always that there are no colors. There are no religions. There are two kind of\npeople, the good and the bad. And if you're good, try to make the bad better. And that's\nwhat children \u2014 and children listen. You'd be surprised how wonderful they are in the\nschools. And if I only reach three or four children in every school, in every college, then\nwe will have some wonderful people.\n*\u00b0 Thomas P. Lantos",
        "A: You're welcome.",
        "A: Yeah. Not to Yellow houses. He never went to the Yellow Star houses. He went to the\nhouses what he set up with the Swedish flag.",
        "A: Alright? I actually didn't go with him in this. I was in the hospital many times with him\nbecause that he needed help there, the nurses and the sick people. And I was a hostess at\nthe Embassy when these people came up to the door to ask, \"Please help.\" And then I\ntook their picture and I went to the Ambassador and he would sign. And the Danube, as\nyou know, and mostly I helped up in the Embassy. Whatever I could do. I was not a\nsecretary, I was a gofer \u2014 \u201cgo for this\u201d and \u201cgo for that.\u201d And it was wonderful. But we\nalways knew what Raoul did, and then on my own, I also collected some people and said,\n\"Do you want to be saved? Give me a picture.\" And then I took it back. And sometime it\ncome out very embarrassing because you don't remember the people you help, but they\nremember you. And this happened to me when I arrived. If you are interested, I arrived to\nthis country, and I had something wrong with my tonsils, and I found a Hungarian doctor\nof all places up and near West End Avenue in New York. And one day, I'm sitting in his\nliving room. His living room was his waiting room, and people come up from his\nbedroom, his family. And I'm sitting there reading a book, and suddenly a fat gentlemen\nwalked by and start screaming, \"You saved my life. You saved my life.\" And I looked\naround. I forgot the war you know. Who thinks of the war? But he comes suddenly, and\nhe sits down and starts kissing my hand, and talks Hungarian, and I said, \"Uncle, what\nare you doing? Who are you?\" You know, and looking frightened. And then he told me\nthe story you see. The Embassies are \u2014 whether there's a war or not, they close at three\no'clock. Okay? Three o'clock, a knock at the door, and there stands this gentleman with\nfour pictures and he said, \"Please. Please. Would you give us the paper.\" And I said, \"I'm\nsorry. We are closed.\" And he started to cry. I said, \"Okay. Okay. Uncle. Just a minute.\"\nAnd I went over to the Ambassador and I said, \"Ambassador, just these four more.\" And\nhe said, \"No. No. No. I have a date.\" I said, \"Please. Just sign your name.\" He did. And I\nhanded it back to the man. It happened to be the son the, the brother-in-law of the doctor.\nOkay? And I was so embarrassed. And it was him. They all survived.\nPer Anger had the same thing happening to him years after in Vienna 1n 1956 when the\nuprising in Hungary happened during the Russians. Well, in this uprising the only people\nwho run away, was some Nazis who were left over and some Jews. And he was then\nalready Vice Consul in Vienna, and the people came on the boats. So he thought, \"Well,\nif Raoul could do it then, maybe I should go down to the riverside and help these people\nout.\" And he goes in with this little light, and suddenly a lady comes off a boat and starts\nrunning. \"Mr. Anger, you saved me from the Nazis. Now you're saving me from the\nRussians.\" And he still \u2014 he was \u2014 you know, it was, it was a terrible \u2014 it's a beautiful\nfeeling. To Raoul it happened once. When the Russians took him, and it's also you not\nlike to hear that, he right away went. He came back once with two Russian officers\nbehind him and the only person who saw him was our electoral in Budapest. And he\ncame back and he said, \"I don't know whether I'm ordered back to the Russian\nheadquarters, but I don't know if I am going as a guest or as a prisoner.\" This was his last\nwords. But he said, \"I have to tell you a story. On the way here now, we saw a little old\nlady with still the yellow star that she was carrying bread in her bag. And I got out and I\nsaid to her, \"Do you speak German?\" And she said, \"Yes.\" And I said, \"I am Raoul\nWallenberg.\" And she said, \"I know,\" and she pulled out the pass. And he said, \"I started\nto cry.\" He said, \"At least one person I know is alive.\" So I'm glad that it happened to him\nat least once that he found someone who lived because of him. And you know, and it\nhappened a few \u2014 a year ago, I think, I spoke to a big group grownups in a synagogue, I\nbelieve, in Pennsylvania. And I was telling them the Danube business, and suddenly an\nold gentleman got up and he says, \"Stop.\" And he looked around to the people. He said,\n\"Everybody can see this little scratch here?\" And the people said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Well,\nI was lucky. The bullet hit me there, and that's the girl who pulled me out and I froze. I\nsaid, \"No, I didn't.\" He said, \"Yes, you did.\" Because you know, after awhile you don't\nbelieve it yourself because years going by and I was sick and it was frozen. But I was the\nonly woman. So and that is a life. And I thought it was a wonderful life and I am glad I\nlived through it.",
        "A: You're very welcome.\n[Technical conversation]\n[Displaying photographs |",
        "A: Well, you see, we worked for Raoul, 350 of us, and we all got working papers, and this is\nmine. And the working paper is written in two languages, in Hungarian and German, and\nthanks God, everything 1s signed by Raoul, himself. In Hungarian up there he signed and\nin the German, too. It says exactly that we are working under Department B or some of\nthem work for Department A, plus the Swedish Red Cross. And this we always carried\nwith us the all time.\n[Technical conversation]",
        "A: Well, this 1s before Raoul arrived to Hungary. The Swedish Government, itself, gave out\n800 of these passports. They are real Swedish passports. When the house doesn\u2019t have\nthe hard cover, they give you this. And I was one of the lucky girls to get one, because I\nwas evidently engaged to a Swedish gentleman and he said if the war wouldn\u2019t have\ncome, I would be his wife. So I am Swedish and that\u2019s my paper. And I traveled along.\nAll the visas on the back, you can see. I traveled with this passport until I arrived to\nSweden and then \u2014 \u201cmakuleras\u201d\u00ae\u201d\u201d means \u201cvoid.\u201d But I didn\u2019t need it anymore.\n[Schutz-pass for Arnold Mandl is displayed]\n[Conclusion of interview]\n\u00a9 Cancelled (Swedish)\n"
