And we used to deal with farmers. Got along very fine with farmers, they didn't\nbother us. But after a while, started to get rougher. The younger generation grew up and\nbecame like here -- some of them, against the Jewry. They didn't want the Jews to come to\ntheir town to sell something.

Used to go almost everyday. Except Saturday. Saturday,\nnobody go. Struggle. Was very poor living. Most of them -- nobody had money in the bank.\nWas not even a bank in the city.

Like too many tailors, too many shoemakers, too many carpenters,\neverything. We used to go and -- go on -- market, there used to be a market some days. Once\na week, it was a market by us. Just bring it all -- the farmers, they come to bring potatoes.\nOther things, chickens, butters, cheeses. People used to go out to buy it.

        "Q: Now you said you -- were you -- were there any Zionists or political organizations in your\ntown?",
        "A: There were Zionists, yes. Very few. As a matter of fact, I was belonged to the Kibbutz\n[inaudible], to go to kibbutz and go to, after while go to Israel to work. Or else in by us, we\nhad to respect for our parents, and my father said \"No, No.\" He had made [inaudible]. After a\nwhile, I find out he made a lot of money. Because he was butcher, he want I should be a\nbutcher. I could be something else. I'm going to be something else. I could make a better\nliving. There's too many -- too many this. Another brother wanted to be a butcher, and have\ntwo younger brothers, they want -- they will wind up to own carpenters. I didn't --",
        "Q: Then you were interested in the politics of the Zionist movement?",
        "A: Yeah. I always talked about it with the \u201crun away with,\u201d that term, because it was not\npleasure there. Was nothing. I had four boys. What do you think was to grow up? Like same\nthing \u2014 working. It was not -- even in schools, were afraid to go to school, because they used\nto get beaten up by Polish boys because they were more in -- they started to go to school.\nAnd if you didn't want to go to school, you weren't punished. You didn't have to go to\nschool, because nobody was interested. The government wasn't interested in you didn't go to\nschool.",
        "Q: But they went -- did they go to the same school with the Polish boys?",
        "A: Yes. They go to the same school. Of course, a couple classes -- it was about two or three\nclasses in our town was for Jewish kids only. After a while, the higher classmate have to go\ntogether. What's troubling, you are afraid to go because no-- nobody was, nobody -- it was\nnobody was stopping them to do anything. There was no punishment.",
        "Q: Let's -- now, at this point, had you \u2014 [technical conversation]. Before 1939, had you heard a\nlot about Hitler and the Nazism? Did you know --",
        "A: No, no. In 1939, 1940 -- '35 -- a lot of Germans on the way from their town came, it's\nPoland. When they used to tell us stories, nobody could believe them. Nobody wanted to\nbelieve them. Even, even in '38, even in '38, they came back and they came into our town\nand they told us a story. We didn't believe it. We didn't believe them when they said, even in\n1939, they took over in Poland. The gentile people used to go, they used to deal with them,\nwith us. They used to buy from the kosher butcher. The Jewish people eat only the front part\nof the meat and the back part used to sell it to them. They used to take it to different big cities\nand sell it there and make a living. They came back from Warsaw and they told us -- they\nsaid that they were going to kill Polish Jews. We didn't pay too much attention.\nWe were, at that time, tied in already, because when the Germans came into house they used\nto beat us up and then let us go. They caught somebody -- as a matter of fact a Jew that was\non the market buy wood. They came in to buy the wood, he bought the wood, that wood was\nstolen. The police, the Germans, they didn't punish the guy who bought -- who stole -- the\nwood. They punished the Jew who bought the wood. He didn't know. He needed the wood,\nhe bought it. So they took him and they send him away to Treblinka. It was Treblinka, not --\nthere was two of them. One of them was just for punishing gentile people. Jewish people, but\nthey did something wrong from the beginning. They didn't take them to kill yet. So that was\nthe start of it.",
        "Q: Now you said you were in the Polish army?",
        "A: I was the Polish Army, yeah.",
        "Q: A lot of Jews in the Polish Army?",
        "A: Was, there was, because a lot of -- they didn't take everybody to the army because some of\nthe numbers like here, you know? So they didn't go. I went. A lot of people went, went to the\narmy. I was in the army then, in the reserve. The war started, they took me into the reserve. I\nwas in Warsaw, the capital. I was supposed to be -- whenever I had a gun in my hands, I\nnever put a bullet in it. It was, it was taken over by them like, like nothing. They used to\nbomb that city and people were killed, the horses were killed. They used to go out, the\npeople used to go out, take knives, cut off pieces of meat from the horses, from the dead\nhorses outside. They used to take 1t home and cook it and eat these things.",
        "Q: Now tell me a little bit about when the war started. Where were you, what was happening?",
        "A: Well, after the war, after the war finished, the Germans took over. I came home. I came with\nthe [inaudible]. We went to buy a piece -- steal by a farmer. We used to sell it to a make a\nliving. I started to make a living. Worse and worse. We couldn't go out, they locked us in.\nThey put us in a lot of punishments. And sometimes at night Germans came in. They didn't\nwant to do it -- they would find something they wanted. They didn't want the stock. They\nwant we should pay money. And have us put to jail. We have to pay them off not to touch us.\nAnd money wasn't around. Couldn't -- couldn't produce, we couldn't make it. We couldn't\ncall into farmers, bring in some stuff. We couldn't go out. So it got tougher and tougher.",
        "Q: What -- do you remember the date your town was occupied?",
        "A: The Germans occupied this 1939 in -- I think it was before the Jewish holidays. In October,\nsomething like that.",
        "Q: August, maybe?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: August of 1939? No.",
        "A: It was in summertime, I know this.",

        "A: It was at that time it was occupied.",
        "Q: Did they come to your town afterwards?",
        "A: They came right away. All over. They came all over. I can remember because I know it was\nin the summer.",
        "Q: But after you left Warsaw it was right away?",
        "A: After I left Warsaw, as a matter of fact, I was a -- they had keep us about two weeks. The\nGermans kept us. And then they gave us the leaves and I started to want to go home. I had to\nwalk about 70 miles home.",
        "Q: So by the time you got home, were the Germans in your town also?",
        "A: They were there. They were all over Poland right away. Because they came in, they came in\nthere, and as a matter of fact, in our side of the town, the Germans -- it was Russia and\nGermany did business, in the beginning. They did business. They used to bring this -- they\nused to trade wood for coal, a lot of things, they did business in the beginning, yeah. So the\nGermans were there. And it used to make me almost -- took people to work everyday almost\nin our town.",
        "Q: Ok. So after the Germans came in, they made life very difficult for you. Were you put into a\nghetto?",
        "A: It was a ghetto, yeah. The ghetto was -- we couldn't -- we weren't allowed to go out to do\nbusiness anywhere else. Only sneaked in through the different roads because we were living\nthere, but you know -- sneak in, sneak in. That's why we survived.",
        "Q: Was there any semblance? Your town is now a ghetto. It's difficult to get in and out. Was\nthere any normal life? Did people go to school? Did you still pray?",
        "A: No schools for anybody. Not even -- not only for Jews, but for the non-Jews, too. No school\nat all. The occupation, the occupation of the Germans, there was no school, no.",
        "Q: Were you able to go to synagogue?",
        "A: There was no synagogue. It got burnt. The synagogue got burnt, half of the town got burnt.",
        "Q: So the Poles were in bad shape, too?",
        "A: Not the Poles. The Poles, most of them were lots of farmers. The others managed to do\nsomething. They could go around and they could maneuver around from one town to the\nother. But there was no punishment for them. They said that they didn't, they didn't suffer\nthat much a loss.",
        "Q: So there really was nothing you could do. Were people working?",
        "A: Only worker, yeah. The people that were farmers, they used to bring in some stuff, a pair of\nshoes. Tailors, because they didn't have -- very few Gentile people were tailors. Most of the\nJews were the tailors and they brought their stuff to them. They didn't go nowhere. They\ncould -- they were allowed to come into church. They were allowed to come into the city.\nBut they weren't allowed. The Nazis, they gave them money, they brought them in some\nfood. Flour, potatoes, other things, too. Only for Jews, for a lot of Jews this was too many for\nus, especially for our profession, was very risky. You couldn't -- you weren't allowed to go to\nfarmer to buy these cattle. It was very risky. If we killed the cattle, it was also very risky.\nYou were not supposed to do it.",
        "Q: So were you out of work then?",
        "A: I was out of work, yeah. We lived whatever we could get. I used to buy the flour, we used to\nmake our own bread. We used to do -- we had water. Salt. And that was good. We didn't ask\nany more. So long we had a piece of bread on the -- most of the -- feed the children. Milk\nwas very hard to get, because they didn't have the money to buy the milk from the farmer.",
        "Q: Did -- was there a lot of brutality towards you by the Germans? Did they beat people?",
        "A: Oh, they beat people with when they find them. They didn't came into the houses looking\nfor-- at that time it was not the order yet. They didn't start at that time the order to kill the\npeople yet. The people -- about a year -- about two years -- a year and a half they were --\nthey didn't bother with everybody. They didn't bother them because they made ghettos. And\nthey tried to depress the people. They should give up faster, they shouldn't fight back. They\nwant to depress them. They have more strength than to lose because they didn't have enough\nfood to eat -- the other couple kids was -- your family had seven kids, too. And you have to\nfeed them, each one of them -- 10 pounds potatoes was not enough to feed 10 people, nine\npeople.",
        "Q: Were there work brigades?",
        "A: Hmm?",
        "Q: Were there work brigades? Did they send any of the Jews out to do work?",
        "A: Yeah. They used to catch us. Do work, spent a lot of time to make water digs, to make for\nfarmers, not for ours. And they used to take us, and a lot of people didn't know how to work.\nThey got beaten up. Were not physically fit.",
        "Q: Were there shootings?",
        "A: Hmm?",
        "Q: Anybody get shot?",
        "A: No shooting. They beat them up. A bullet 1s too much. Save a bullet. Kill them with the\nsticks and anything.",
        "Q: Did the local Polish people -- were they nice to you or were they beating you up, too?",
        "A: Well, they were nice. They didn't bother us. They didn't help either. Many of the local\nfarmers -- we have a lot -- in our profession, we have a lot -- we deal with a lot of farmers. If\nthey come, they try to do--. Really, they was staying away from the Jews. Most of the time,\nthey didn't want -- they wouldn't get in trouble. So I didn't blame them because everybody\nworks for themselves. So it wasn't good for anybody. It wasn't good for the Polish people,\neither. You gave them, told them to bring in stuff but they need it for themself. And like\nmeat, and everything, they confiscated and everything you want, they did with that.",
        "Q: Now, I know that . I know how you happened to leave your town. But were there, up until\nthe time you left, round-ups of people?",
        "A: Oh, you mean concentration camp. To Treblinka, you mean?",
        "Q: To anywhere. Did they come to the town and gather people together and send them to work,\nto camps?",
        "A: Yeah. They used to go. There was a Judenrat.\u201d You know what a Judenrat is? They took the\nJudenrat and they were responsible -- they came in and they want a supply, some of them\nmade the Jewish. They came in, the Judenrat, the police; got some -- like a list -- and used to\ncome in and take me or take somebody else. They had to supply as many people they\nwanted.",
        "Q: What did you think of the Judenrat?",
        "A: Oh, yes. I don't know. I'm going to tell you this. The only way they did that, they had no\nchoice. They had to do something because otherwise -- a lot of them did it, overdid it. Most\nof them had no choice. They had to supply the people.",
        "Q: So the council was -- would gather people for work or for something.",
        "A: Oh, the most important thing is that they came home that night. If they don't, they get weaker\nevery day. They couldn't work, they couldn't do anything when -- because if you don't eat,\nyou can't produce.",
        "Q: How did you happen to leave?",
        "A: I have had to eat. One bed for the other, that's all. Nothing -- a dollar left over for next week.",
        "Q: I'm sorry. I was asking you how you happened to leave the city. For Treblinka. How -- what\nwas happening?\n* Jewish Council (German).",
        "A: Well, it was panic. Everybody else is panicking, everybody is afraid because we saw what's\ngoing on and started to -- they were taking up people from Warsaw already. They were\ntaking up, bringing from the big cities. Scared. We heard about the Russians. From the\nbeginning Russia lost the war. We hoped, but the hope never came. It came too late. So I\ncame in that date when they, after do this.\nThey started to bring in the Jews from [indecipherable]. They needed some helpers. So they\nwent into Warsaw and they told people in Warsaw -- they were starving there in the streets,\nand a lot of people had nothing to eat -- in the ghettos because the poor people didn't have no\nmoney to pay for anything. Everything was so expensive. The rich people didn't want to\nshare with anybody. They thought maybe they want to live for themself. Even they had\nenough, but they didn't -- even they went in to talk to them -- to the big people, the\nmanufacturers there. \"Give us money, we going to buy some ammunition with.\" \u201cDon't\nbother me.\u201d They didn't want nothing to do with them. Because they -- maybe they will fight\nfor themself. Everybody was selfish. They always worried about for themself. After a while,\nthey came into Warsaw, they told the people if you to have a job, working, I'll give you room\nand board. So a lot of -- came out and said they want to go. They took them, they put them in\n-- was about 300 people there. At Treblinka, before I came there. And they started to\nbuilding the dam. Only they were so poorly, the help was so poorly because it was starving\nbefore, they had nothing to eat. What are they going to do? Came there, in the start of they\ngave me shovels to dig. To make the grave for the -- prepare for the people -- for the gas\nchamber. To make -- they started to do that. They couldn't do the job. They took a couple\ndays. They took them. They used to line them up in three, take them into a grave and shoot\nthem. Then they came into our town. And they took us and they came in. It was a Thursday\nmorning. I remember that day, that morning, and heard something was going on.",
        "Q: What year? When was this? What year?",
        "A: It was in '42.",
        "Q: And do you remember the month?",
        "A: It was summertime. I know it was about May or June. Because I know down the field,\nbecause I was hiding there in the field. And I jumped up to the window. Back, back in our\nroom there was a field there. And people and I hided myself there. And one Ukrainian came\nthere and find me there. And came with a gun, I thought they were going to kill them there.\nHe took me -- he had surrounded the barn, that and 10 boys, young people. He put us in jail\n'til they finish up the whole thing. They took us out; they came in with trucks. They put us on\ntruck; they started to travel to Treblinka. And we were traveling, and there they picked up,\npicked up a couple bicycles there from somebody and put us on our heads. And then we\nwere traveling in a yellow truck. There were three [inaudible]. They used to take -- traveling\nthere they took cigarettes. Some, they were boldy. They lighted up the cigarettes and put\nthem in there and burn them. Finally we came in, took us to that concentration camp,\nTreblinka. And we came up in the truck. And they told -- finally, we finally came into that\npens} onat.\u201d You know what pensjonat means? Like a hotel. Finally we came into Hotel\nTreblinka.",
        "Q: I'm going to stop you for one minute. I sust wanted -- how long did it take you to get there,\nand how many people were in with this group on the trucks?",
        "A: About 150 people. 150 people.",
        "Q: 150?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And it took how long?",
        "A: Hmm?",
        "Q: How long, how long was the distance to get there?",
        "A: Oh, it was -- took a couple of hours. Couple of hours.\nEnd of Tape #1\n* Hotel (Polish).\nTape #2",
        "Q: Did you, did you know about Treblinka before?",
        "A: I know the town was a railroad place. They had a small stop there. They used to -- trains\nstopped there. So in the way to that station they made an extension, they made an extension\nto that Treblinka, they called it Treblinka. That was a desert. A piece of land unworkable for\nfarmers, just a piece of desert. But they came, when I came in there, when they took us from\nthe truck -- in the truck everybody... Anybody wouldn't have no shovel is going to get killed.\nBut everybody was grabbing -- the shovels, and was maybe 20 left over. And we started to\nwork. Same day we work. And physically, I was built good, strong. People, other people in\nthe town they never did a hard work 1n their life. The skin of their -- it was soft. If you started\nto use a shovel for a long time, you get blisters on the fingers. You can't work. They couldn't\nproduce. So, they were working; they couldn't produce. And it was one German sitting on\nthe top, watching. All were crying. Some people that wouldn't produce used to call him up --\ncome up -- and they took him, they tied in their legs to the -- like a bench. Tie the legs to a\nbench. He told him to bend down, and took off -- put down -- your pants down. He took two\ncanes -- not -- canes and they beat him, one on this side and one on the other side. They beat\nhim up so much, then they took him to the edge from the grave and they pushed him down.\nHe fell over. He refused to stand up. Right away they get him to work. They took him off\nagain and it was finished. He was finished, couldn't do nothing. I was trying not to get up\nthere. They didn't hurt me.",
        "Q: Now what -- where was the rest of your family at this time?",
        "A: Weren't in my town yet. I was there about seven months before them. They took me away\nbefore. And they were -- 1t was hoped -- they used to come -- they allowed --they made a\ndeal with the Germans, they let one girl come in every week and bring a -- some bread.\nBring in and some notes that they gave. \u201cWe are working on it, you're going to be free.\nYou're going free, you're going free.\u201d I had opportunity to run away that time, also. Because\n-- but I didn't want to run away because I was afraid for my family. Because if they know I\nrun away, they know where I came. They going to punish my family. They were waiting and\nwaiting. And when we got hope, 'til the time came, and they took, they took us out, all of\nthem, about a couple hundred -- about a hundred people -- 120 people -- and they stood us in\nline and said, \"Who wants to go home, and who wants to stay here?\" Everyone wants to go\nhome. So I went in the line -- \u201cI want to go home.\u201d Right after, they didn't let us go. They let\nus go and I went in the -- back to sleep. And I was laying in the bed and something came into\nmy mind. If they going to be free, I'm going to be free -- a week later, two weeks later. I went\nback to the line, I want to stay. So those people, they separated. They took them a different\nplace. I never saw them again. They took them a different place and started to bring in the\ncars with Jews to kill them off. Those people were with the dead ones. And I was working\nwith the working people. They have to build beds for the -- and build barracks for them, I\nwas working for them. That's why I was working. And they used to bring -- every day they\nstarted to bring in a hundred cars, and each car was that -- a hundred people in each car. In\nthe beginning they didn't -- when they came off the car, I wasn't there. Only the workers, if\nthey needed something to fix, I was -- I used to go up there. There was some soon as they got\noff the car, the people were glad they were coming off, because a hundred people in the car\nand the trip used to take four or five hours. They'd keep them for 24 hours. It made them so\nweak, they were -- they couldn't -- they didn't care anymore.\nSo they told them, the first thing, take off the jacket. After -- and the overcoat, then the\njacket. And 'til they came to the end, they were naked. And they were in line to go, they were\nput in the concentration camp, in the chamber, the gas chamber. I saw the gas chamber\nbefore they started to build because I was there and was doing some work there. And I\ncouldn't, because my destination, I couldn't even think about it. There was going to be\nsomething to kill people. I thought it was looked like a shower. Looked -- openings on the\nceilings like water will come, you know. That's what I figured. I didn't figure they would do\nthis thing, you know.",
        "Q: Were you involved in building it or not?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Did you help build it?",
        "A: I helped them build it, yeah. But all the work there was -- I used to go to the forest, I cut --\nchopped young trees and bring it in. I used to go and a German used to take me and a few\npeople together and we used to go bring in the -- those things to build there.",
        "Q: So you built barracks?",
        "A: Barracks, yeah.",
        "Q: And the gas chamber?",
        "A: The gas chamber I wasn't building because it was professional people was making bricks,\nyou see. This was people, I don't know, I think was Germans allowed to build it -- build this\nthing. They built one, one small in -- on the first grave. They put in the people and they\ncovered them with dirt and cloths there. And after a while, they stopped for a couple weeks\nand they came in, a lot of mechanics came in. They built another one. A big gas chamber.\nBigger one. And they took in, they took in steam shovels to build, to dig. After a while, they\ndidn't put them in the graves anymore. They made -- from the tracks from the railroad, they\nmade like a -- like a screen -- laid like this -- and they put them at the -- in the fire in the\nbottom that went in. And they used to, they used to dig up the people that were buried\nbefore: a year ago, six months ago, they used to dig them up and they with the steam shovels\nand I used to see from my inside where I was working -- I used to see a hand, a foot, there\nwas bodies. It was such a smell that people got -- a lot of people got sick there. Died off in\nthat thing. Well, I had mine -- what's the name -- typhus -- before I went in. I was lucky that\ntime I didn't catch it because I was -- before I went in the concentration camp I was sick and\nnothing had survived.",
        "Q: So you were working in a separate part. You were not working in the same place where they",
        "A: Was separated, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: You were in the lower camp.",
        "A: Lower camp, yeah. Anything that had to be fixed, I had to go in. Was the -- call it -- the other\nplace -- lazaret.* They call it lazaret. It means -- the German is a hospital, something like this.\nThey took the people -- sick people. They came in, a lot of young people came in with\ncarriages and babies. They took the carriages away with them and the sick people, they came\nup in the train -- they put them in that carriages and they brought them over. Was a fire,\nburning on inside there. And they told them, we come in, we going to take them to the\ndoctor. We going to fix you. And at that time I was there fixing that thing, somebody got\nburned there. The -- a place where they were standing there with rails and hiding.\nSo caught on fire, got burnt. I had to fix it there. And I saw, they came in with a lot of these\npeople. And they tell them, wait a minute, the doctor's coming. They took them off in a\ncarriage where they let them stay. The doctors that came right away, they took the crying\npeople, they took guns and they shoot them and they fell in, right on the fire.",
        "Q: You saw this?",
        "A: I saw this. Yeah. Only once over there.",
        "Q: When you saw something like this what were you thinking in terms of your own security?",
        "A: Own security was like a -- put you in with tigers. In a tiger cage. You stay, you couldn't do\nnothing. You couldn't do -- because the only hope was maybe, maybe even the people that\ngo into the hospital you see is dying right away, you still hope something. \u201cMaybe, maybe.\u201d\nThat was our -- some people lost their will. Some people had, \u201cMaybe, maybe, maybe.\u201d So\n* Field hospital (Polish, archaic).\nlong as we -- I could walk around, physically, good strength, I hoped maybe something\nwould happen. The war -- some days they took, they took people. They started to get scared,\nthought maybe, everybody was disgusted. Maybe we will started to make an uprise. They\nstarted to -- they took the people, they took -- they put all of them on one lot in a circle, and\nthey were in the middle and they told us. They took two people out of there and they said,\n\"These two people want to run away.\" So they need somebody to make a hanging noose --\nwhat do you call it? To hang them up. To make a pole like this and one stick like this and\ntwo like this, and picked people to make that thing. And they hung them by the legs. Not by\nthe head. And they were hollering. There was -- \"What are you waiting for? You think they\ngoing to do -- you going to go out?\" And we were standing in line, standing there and\nhelpless. Maybe we were -- all together, maybe, we could have done something. Maybe we\ncould kill them all, because they -- my jobs are there. But everybody was so scared. So\nscared.",
        "Q: Now I want to go back a little bit. When you arrived, you started working right away.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you said that the area was really a desert.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were there many buildings there already?",
        "A: No buildings. Was only building was the building for the Germans to live in. Living quarter.\nFor them.",
        "Q: And what about the other camp? The other prison camp that was already there?",
        "A: The prison camp was started to build, it was there some like a barns. Nothing there. Just four\nwalls and a roof. That's all that was there. Nothing made for us to sleep. I used to -- I build\nthe beds for them to make sleep. We took lumber and made it like this. Because -- long\nbunks. You made it like this. At top, higher. And below, lower. And that's where we slept.\nOut there on this thing. At night we were locked in. We couldn't go nowhere.\nWe were barred this side and barred that side. And on the back -- in the front was guards.\nAnd that's who was standing there.",
        "Q: Did you get enough to eat? Were you able to take showers?",
        "A: No, no showers, no. Well, no showers. You could never have to change our shirt. We\ncouldn't change our shoes, couldn't change anything. Was nothing there to -- was not the\nsupplies for us. No supplies. Only food. Because they needed us to help them doing --\noperate a factory.",
        "Q: So what kind of food did they give you?",
        "A: They gave anything nobody wanted to eat. They gave it to us. Horses. Dead horses.",
        "Q: Meat?",
        "A: Meat, yeah. Glad to get it. I was -- a lot of times I was -- I don't know if I was lucky to --\nsomething -- I don't know. But we used to go up with the Germans in the woods to chop, to\nbring in the young trees because they needed the separation for the clothings. So farmers\nused to bring up some food there. So I had some money. I was lucky the Germans ate\noranges. So he took the oranges from me and I got food. One day they took another fellow\nwith us. And he brought the same thing. Him, he came back -- reported that him they killed.\nBecause he did -- because I was sharing with him the oranges.",
        "Q: The people outside of the camp must have had some idea of what was going on inside the\ncamp.",
        "A: Only farmers. Polish people. They did know what was going on there. They knew it.\nThey knew -- they couldn't miss it because the trains go through the city. Trains coming 1n.\nThey know it but I don't think anything could be done. Anything that maybe they would all\nget together and do something. The outsiders and insiders. But it was never -- see, nobody,\nthey didn't care for us. Because somebody took me out. They took my family out after I find\nout. They went through the windows that night and they took up all our furniture. And\neverything that they find there in the house. They took it away. Everything. They didn't\nreally -- they waited for those things, some of them. Neighbors. Right, neighbors next to the\nhouse.",
        "Q: Who were, were the guards at Treblinka? Were they German, were they Polish?",
        "A: Not Polish. Ukrainian. The guards, most of them, most of the guards were Ukrainian. Not\nGermans. Germans were the leaders. They give the orders. They would do nothing.",
        "Q: How were the Ukrainian guards? Did you have, did you --",
        "A: Oh, they were -- some was very tough, very rough. They were drinking all the time. They\nhelped, they helped all the production there. Everything there was going on. They gave them\nsome liquor to drink before and they just were -- no.",
        "Q: Were they -- did they beat people?",
        "A: Some that got beaten up, yeah.",
        "Q: Who were most of -- most of the prison population? There wasn't that large of a number\nthere at one time, was there?",
        "A: It was all the -- was started -- then they took up some people from the people that came in.\nTook in -- the people that died off, they took in stronger people to work because -- matter of\nfact, we had a doctor there. Also came in there. And a lot of educated people. There were\ncouples, you know. They did the dirty work. The Germans just gave the orders. The rest of\nthem did the dirty work for them.",
        "Q: I'm trying to get a sense of how many people were generally in the camp at one time. And\nthe--",
        "A: Well, most of them, at that time that I was, was about a thousand people.",
        "Q: And you were all working?",
        "A: All working, yeah.",
        "Q: And the other people who came in on these trains everyday?",
        "A: The other people that came on the trains right away, they was executed. Right away they\nwere killed.",
        "Q: How many people do you think came in every day? Could you tell?",
        "A: I could tell. I was watching. I was working on some -- on a roof and I was standing there and\nI counted the trains that came in. At that time was, even at the time was a Jewish holiday.\nBigger the transport was. Put in thousand people. Sometime six hundred people. All depends\non the day, whatever they get.",
        "Q: I thought I read somewhere that there were transports of sometimes up to six thousand\npeople but they had to bring them in some at a time.",
        "A: Yeah. The trains, was not room all the cars could come in. Because was not big enough to fit\nin all the cars. The rest of the -- they separated the cars. They left others outside, some to\nfinish up this thing. And a lot of cars came in again.",
        "Q: Was this pretty continual, all the time these cars came in?",
        "A: The most of them were every day. Most were every day.",
        "Q: So you said you were working in a place where you could actually see what was happening?",
        "A: I saw what was happening. I wasn't, wasn't involved with taking care of those people. But I\nwas involved at sometimes seeing them, going into work there. And I used to see them. I saw\nwhen I was on the roof, I saw where the trains coming in. Because it was not a big place.\nWas not a --",
        "Q: So what else could you see? Could you see their arrival when they came into the courtyard?",
        "A: Arrival that came into the courtyard, how they get undressed. And walk to the bath. And the\nwoman they used to bring her in, take her in to cut her hair off. And a matter of fact, once I\nwas working there outside, and one child, young boy, was running away with his -- got\nseparated from his mother. He was running away and I saw him come in and said -- he was\ntalking to me, I should help him. So I look at him, and, what can I do? I was afraid to even to\ngo near him. And a German came over, he took him away, \u201cCome on, I'll take you to your\nmother.\"",
        "Q: What else did you see?",
        "A: I saw people -- they would put them up on trees and shoot them like they would shoot a bird.\nSaw people beaten up a for potato. I saw people beaten up for have -- for doing nothing.\nThat's what they wanted. They had a dog. One German had a dog. A matter of fact, I was a\nwitness -- consulate in Poland -- in New York. I was a witness for one German, they call him\n-- they ask me -- I ask them \"What happen -- what took so long to catch him?\" They said he\ncame home, he change his name, he then move to a different small town and we couldn't find\nhim. And finally we find him.",
        "Q: Where were most of the prisoners coming from?",
        "A: They came from Czechoslovakia. They came from Bulgaria. They came in -- Bulgarian\npeople came in with passenger trains. Windows, everything. Matter of fact, they gave them\nbarrels of water. They have food, the lamb, dried lamb. They didn't know where they were\ngoing. They absolutely didn't know. They came off the, the -- and they looked like, where\nare they? They must have -- didn't know, but, or something, not in some countries they didn't\ntook up all of them. They left some people, they couldn't catch them, some of them.",
        "Q: Why were they in passenger trains?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Why were they in passenger trains?",
        "A: Because they probably didn't want the people -- the people in their country should know\nwhere they take them.\nThat was the reason. That's what I figure out. That that's supposed to be the reason. Because\nthey \u2014 Poland, they didn't care because Polish people they didn't, they agreed with them,\nbecause most -- a lot of concentration camps were all in Poland. Most concentration not in\nanother country. They wouldn't allowed them to have this.",
        "Q: Now these people who went for immediate execution. How many hours were they usually in\nthe camp?",
        "A: About two hours. That's all. They just -- it was organized. It was working sort of like a, like\na, like a factory. Like -- take off the clothes: One here, one here. They took everything\nseparately. Before they had everything together. Then they got smart and they got\neverything, and they took all the clothes. And they told some people that work there, \u201cLook\nin the pockets, look all over.\u201d If they find some money, some diamonds and gold, glasses,\nanything you find -- they made up places where they separated everything. They put\neverything separate. The jackets separate. The clothes, the pants separate. The underwear\nseparate. Everything separate. They put it separate. So that's, that's when I went to the woods\nto chop this young trees for the separation.",
        "Q: When you say separation, are you talking about a building or a fence --",
        "A: No. There was only building, only was separated with poles. Was not board up in boards,\nseparately, but you could see through there, but there was no thing.",
        "Q: But it was all within one building. Just --",
        "A: All in building. Big building, yeah. They had people working. People work with the glasses,\npeople working with the diamonds. Gold pieces. That's why I got some gold pieces from the\npeople working there. Because I gave them some food and they gave me some gold pieces.\nAnd that was the only way when I work in the concentration I had something to buy my food\nwith.",
        "Q: So you really just worked in construction but you had reason to see all of these places.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. I was going around all over. I was going around just because the work wasn't --\nnot in one place. I was -- the carpenters was in one place. Where they make the beds, they\nmake the tables. They were in one place all the time. I was working outside. It was by the\nbuilding line, you understand, and I said I had to, I had to be in a lot of places.",
        "Q: So you really had an -- a chance to see what was going on all over the camp. You saw them\ntaking the clothes. And pulling the teeth? You saw this?",
        "A: No, I didn't see this. This was inside. They took them inside already, cutting the hair, pulling\nthe teeth. This I can't tell you, because I didn't see that thing. Only thing I saw this: I saw at\nthat time, one night they took us to work there, and they had bundles of clothes to put in the\nsame trains that took the people; they put in all the clothes there. And they shipped them to\nGermany. And a lot of people went in hiding between the clothes and they jumped off the\ntrain on the way out. But they, a few of them, came twice, three times they were there\nbecause nowhere where to go. Most important thing a human being over any other life thing:\nit needs to eat. And the worst part was eating. Hiding itself was bad 1n the wintertime. The\nwinters were heavy. Not like here. The winter's light -- it was very heavy winters. A lot of\nsnow. This was the problem, it lasted too long. See, after they took out the Jews left over\ntook about two years. Two years is a long time. Some people -- those kids were -- their feet\ngot frozen. They couldn't walk; they had to shovel on their behind because they couldn't\nwalk on their feet any more. And nobody wanted -- would get involved. I didn't blame the\npeople, the Polish people because they find out somebody helped a Jew, they came in, they\ntook them out, they killed them, they burned the barns, they burned the house, they burned\neverything. So they were afraid. I don't blame them, those people. I blame the people went\naround to show where a, where a Jew lives. Where you could find a Jew, for a pound of\nsugar. Those people were -- those people didn't want to help. Everybody was looking for his\nown life.",
        "Q: We need to change tapes. Want your water? How are you doing?\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Now a little earlier I was asking you about who was coming in on these trains, and you said\nfrom Bulgaria. Were whole families coming in? Did children --",
        "A: Everything. They took the whole families, yeah, the whole families. As a matter of fact, my\nown children came in there with parents, with my wife, first wife.",
        "Q: Did you know they came in?",
        "A: I didn't know. I had a feeling because they took us off from work and locked us in the\nbarracks. And they put machine guns on the roofs. So I had some feelings they were going in\nthere.",
        "Q: That those people were from your town?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Why the machine guns?",
        "A: Because they were afraid for us that maybe we know something about it. Maybe we make\nsome riots or something. So they did it to protect themself.",
        "Q: Because that transport was from your town?",
        "A: From my town, yeah. The whole town, my wife's town. All small towns put together. And\ntook them out of the houses. I heard when I came back out. They took farmers, horse and\nwagons, they put kids with a woman on the horse and wagon. The people were lined up. And\nthey walked to the railroad. Was nine miles from my town to the railroad. And they walked\nto the railroad. And the kids was --they had to be undressed, mother used to take them, took\nthem into the gas chamber with them together.",
        "Q: So the children died right away.",
        "A: Right away.",

        "A: No. Only a few boys. Only about three of them, no kids, no kids.",
        "Q: Teenage boys?",
        "A: Not even teenagers. Just twelve, thirteen, fourteen, something like this.",
        "Q: What were they doing?",
        "A: They did what told them to do. They did take care -- clean up after the Germans. After they\ndo, they take out the garbage. Just hang around and do a lot of things for them. Whatever\nthey wanted. They had laundress. They had laundress, people work in the laundry, too. They\nhad a couple woman, about three woman working the laundry and a couple men. Only for\nthe Germans and Ukrainians, not for us. No laundry for us.",
        "Q: Were there other women in the camp working?",
        "A: There were about three or four woman, that's all.",
        "Q: In the whole camp?",
        "A: Whole camp.",
        "Q: Who worked in the kitchen?",
        "A: They worked in the laundries, the kitchen, the kitchens. The woman, some Ukrainians\ncooked for them, the Germans cooked for them. They didn't trust anybody.",
        "Q: Who cooked for the prisoners?",
        "A: We -- our people. Some people --",
        "Q: Men or women\u2019?",
        "A: No woman, no.",
        "Q: Now one thing I read about Treblinka is that for a while the organization was very bad. And\nthen there was a change in the German leadership there. Were you there then?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about that?",
        "A: What it was -- the change was that they stopped a lot -- a few things. They send in different\npeople -- different, more, more rougher characters. And they built another one, another gas\nchamber. There was Gestapo was there. Because they couldn't put it -- they couldn't operate.\nSo many people they came in and kill them all. And if there no room to find to keep them\nalive, maybe they going to operate. Understand? So they stopped bringing 1n the Jews for a\nfew weeks and they build another -- this -- and the operation started again.",
        "Q: What was the situation before the change in leadership? Were there extra bodies\neverywhere? What did --",
        "A: No, there was no bodies there. There was -- we were restless. They say they finished\neverything, they were going to kill us. That's what our mind was into. Because there was\nnothing if you haven't got the strength and not work. So we got restless.",
        "Q: Ok, so, I'm just trying to get a sense of what the camp was like before this new person,\nStang!\u201d -- 1s that his name -- came in.",
        "A: The camp was there was a desert. It was built around a gate, all around with barbed wire.\nThey had iron things standing up like this, and they put up barbed wire in case you went -- if\nyou jump over, you get strangled up with the wire. You couldn't be able to get out. That's\nwhat they had done. In barracks we couldn't get -- move anywheres at night. At night we\nwere locked in. It was, was like that chair. See, back and the side. The front was open. They\nhad a gate. That gate was closed after we went in there. And the security was outside. So\ngoing out, outside at night was impossible. We couldn't done it. We couldn't -- anywheres.",
        "Q: I want to ask you one other thing before we get to the uprising. I understand that when\npeople came off the trains, they were very hysterical.",
        "A: Very disturbed. Very, very weak. They couldn't stand up on their own feet. You see, they\nhad families. Whole families, kids. And the kids were crying. \u201cWater, water.\u2019 They used to\n-- the mother used to urinate and give the water to, to drink for the kids. Such a bad situation.\nNobody, nobody orders something like this. What did they -- things they didn't deserve. Just\nmake a form and somebody put them on a tree and shoot them. Take the dog, grab a woman.",
        "Q: Were they met by the Ukrainian guards or were there Germans also in--",
        "A: They both together. They both together, working together.\nThey were always there with guns. Always there with guns. Matter of fact, one, one came off\nand he killed a German, some Jew stabbed him and killed him. And they, they said they even\nhave a name on the -- Max Belicazan (ph.) That put it out that thing. Because he got killed\non that, on the transport coming in. One Jew -- nothing to lose, see. I wish everybody would\n> Oberscharfiihrer Franz Stangl\nhave did the same thing. Would be -- I don't know.",
        "Q: Was there -- what happened after this German was killed?",
        "A: Nothing. They couldn't -- it was done over there. They were more careful that time and after\na while they started to -- they stood away to let the Ukrainian take over. They stood far\naway.",
        "Q: Were a lot of Jews punished?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Were there--",
        "A: No. These people were punished, anything, killed them. These people -- were not such a\nthing -- they didn't -- came into work there, they came into be killed. That's why --",
        "Q: Now I, I was told that they had a little orchestra playing for the --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Tell me about that.",
        "A: They used at night. Was a couple -- one actor from Warsaw, a singer and some musicians.\nAnd they make a circle, for the Germans, not for us. And we were standing outside and\nwatching through the gate and see them singing for them.",
        "Q: For their entertainment?",
        "A: A matter of fact, even the doctor allowed to make -- married a woman there. Made a\nwedding. Was married.",
        "Q: Jewish?",
        "A: A Jewish doctor married a Jewish woman, was also -- he was a doctor and she was a nice\nlooking woman and blonde.",
        "Q: She was one of the few women there?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But they didn't live together?",
        "A: Hmm?",
        "Q: They didn't live in the same place there?",
        "A: I don't know that. I think they gave him one -- I'm not sure, but I think they gave him one\nplace \u2014 something, I don't know. Just I can't tell you exactly because I didn't know because I\nknow that the, the woman was going on there.",
        "Q: But didn't this little orchestra also play to drown out the screams of people arriving?",
        "A: No, no. No, was at nighttime. No screams nighttime any more. After work, not in the day\ntime.",
        "Q: Oh, so there was no music in the daytime?",
        "A: Oh, no. Oh, no. Was only in the nighttime. They'd put them on outside and they played for\nthem.",
        "Q: Ok, now before the uprising, were there efforts by Jews to fight back, to resist the Germans\nand Ukrainians?",
        "A: Very little resist. No such thing. A matter of fact, when we started to organize ourself, the\nuprise, not everybody was allowed to know about it. We didn't want everybody to know.\nUntil the last day, nobody know anything about it because we were frightened, because we\nhad couples there. It was German couples, was other couples, German-Jews couples. And we\ndidn't trust them.",
        "Q: Were there -- so there were really no resistance efforts people, except for, you told me, some\npeople would hide in the trains and try to go back.",
        "A: No resistance. No resistance at all, no. One fellow, they -- was standing -- every morning\nthey used to put us in lines and counted, see everybody's there, nobody went away. So the\none fellow had something. They took him and they put him down, they told him to take off\nhis -- put down his pants and started to beat him up. And beat him up. So then they killed\nhim. Always they did something to scare us off. They do something like this.",
        "Q: So tell me about the planning for this uprising. How did this come about? Who knew\u2019?",
        "A: Maybe about 10, 12 people knew about it, that's all. We, we were in that place where the\ncarpenters were \u2014 worked. We were sitting there, they came in the house, We were talking.\nWe had some -- we had somebody watching outside that nobody comes in. And we were\ntalking about, we're talking about it. How should do it, when to do it. Because at night was\nno problem, no such a thing that we could do at night. Has to be done at daytime. Because\nwe didn't know -- they chasing people and we going to survive. After they finish up, they\ndidn't want that everybody should know something. So we didn't want everybody should\nspoil it for us. They couldn't -- talk and talk -- and then made up the time for the day.",
        "Q: Now why did it have to be in the daytime?",
        "A: Because we couldn't move at nighttime. At nightttme we were locked in.",
        "Q: And you were not in the daytime?",
        "A: Hmm? The daytime we were moving around, we worked there.\nBut not at night. At night we couldn't do nothing. To make this -- we got the, the ammunition\nand the guns. Got it and they came in there. They built a place where they keep their -- the\nguns, the Germans. And they bought -- they took a door. They had no key to that door. And\nwe had, what's the name -- locksmiths. Locksmith, and they told him to make a key.",
        "Q: A Jewish locksmith?",
        "A: A Jewish locksmith. They gave him to make a key. And when he was making the key, we\ntold him make an extra key. So he make the extra key and we had that key.",
        "Q: Do you remember the locksmith's name?",
        "A: No, I don't know. There was so many, so many strange people there and everybody was\noccupied with his own tsores,\u2019 see. He was a goldsmith, a guy who was making rings, also.\nWe told him, make a key. Extra key. And we took the key, and we were hiding that key. And\nwe started to talk about the uprise. We gave the key to these kids, the same kids we were\nworking by the Germans, the goyim,\u201d to go into the [inaudible]. We told them, we warned,\nbecause when the Germans finished eating, everything was empty there. Nobody was there.\nSo they had opportunity to get into the magazine. The same baby carriages for the garbage,\nthey put in the guns on the bottom. It was the carpenter\u2019s place, them hiding there. It was --\ndig the hole and put it in there.",
        "Q: I just need to -- I need to ask you this because I want to make sure for the record this 1s very\nclear. So the baby carriages were from the trains, but they had to take them to the garbage\nand they hid the guns in them.",
        "A: Yeah.\n\u00b0 Hardship, misery (Yiddish).\n\u2019 Gentiles (Yiddish).",
        "Q: Ok.",
        "A: And that's -- had watches. Had a watch, everybody put up the time. The time this should\nhappen was supposed to be about five o'clock, before everybody comes in. So we get a few\npeople -- not all the boys know about it, but a few went out to work with -- we could trust\nthem. So after this somebody find out and everybody have a little money hidden away from\nthe dead people. They put it in this -- the one boy came home and started to dig up the\nmoney. And a couple, a Jewish couple, saw him and called out a German. And the German\nstarted to run to grab that boy. He grab him, he going to beat him up and he was going to tell\nwhat's going on. Then we decided -- we made it before. We made it a half an hour before.\nSo a lot of people started to run. Everybody was running. Only they didn't know where to\nrun. They didn't -- they were running front and back at the same place because the direction\n-- they were running, they didn't -- a lot of them strange people, not from even Poland, from\ndifferent countries. When I was, my town was from the concentration camp was 15 miles\nonly. I don't know the directions, I know where I walking. And I started to run. I didn't hear\nthe gun that time. I had -- I took some big -- a handle from a chopper -- a big heavy -- and I\ncame -- I was running back and I came to the people inside that was standing there and I say\n\"Come, what are you staying here for? Come on, let's run.\" They weren't running. They\nweren't running. They staying there. They didn't want to run. I was running. I wanted there to\nfind another person. And I came in -- came to the front of my town, it was daytime. I couldn't\ngo into the town, because I was afraid to. I laid down there until 1t got dark. And I went back\nway, not in the front, through the whole town. To the side. And I went into farmer and I\nwanted some water. So he didn't want to give me no water. The farmer had no -- he's afraid,\nhe expects somebody to come to him, he don't want to give him no water. I went away from\nhim. I went to the different farmer. That farmer would give me water because he knows a lot\nof Jews, a couple Jews was hiding somewhere else, and he supplied them with food. So he\nwould give me water. He would probably push me, put me back with the other ones. But I\nwas running and then I laid down because I was tired, nighttime, in the field.\nLaid for a while and after a while I got up and I look around and I didn't know where I am.\nMy mind disappeared. Are they running?",
        "Q: Were you alone?",
        "A: No, another man. That one who lives, lives in Brooklyn -- in Miami, yeah. That's the guy. I\nwas -- got up and I find out he didn't know where he was going because he's not from -- he's\nfrom different town. He was following me. He didn't -- yeah, he watched me like a hawk. He\ncouldn't let me go because if I go, he is lost. I went into the woods, finally got into the\nwoods. And started to get daylight. And I see farmers coming into work, and I know them\nthe farmers. And I was afraid to go up. I wouldn't go up. But it comes 12 o'clock and the\nfarmers would go home. Lunch time. And I go out and can take a look around. I find another\ncouple. A boy, a young boy with a sister-in-law. A sister, the husband got killed and he --\nand they was scared for me and I was scared for them. Finally, we got together. Got together\nand they were -- the farmers didn't want to sell them anything, because they didn't have no\nmoney. They didn't want to give them anything. They didn't have no money. That boy used\nto go in at night, to the farmers, and what they put up for the dogs to eat, he used to take it\naway. The food, with a stick, for the dogs, and they lived on it. Then we came there and I\nhad some gold pieces and I gave them this gold piece and they went to the farmer and they\ngot everything. At night, not in daytime. We got everything. Finally, we came, we got food\nto eat. How we going to live? And after the -- we started steal a shovel from the farmer,\ncame into the woods and I dig a hole. I dig the hole, made a place for four people. In the\nplace -- and I covered it up. I chopped up some pieces wood to cover the top. And straw.\nAnd I put the dirt. The same dirt what was the other side, they shouldn't recognize that\nsomething new build there. The dirt was thrown away somewhere far away. There should be\nno dirt and we laid there. At night, I used to go for food. And sometimes I used to take -- was\na lake there -- used to go into the lake and wash us off. Couldn't -- not to wipe us off, to\nwashing off. And that's where we lived for a couple months. For 11 months we were living\nlike this. After 11 months, they started to burn around there. They almost started -- the\nRussians coming to chase the Germans. And the Germans started to burn around all of there\nand I went away to different place. And I was laying in different place before -- the guns\nfrom both sides. And I see the Germans digging in. And I was separated from the group. I\nwas by myself. And I was going to look for them. Finally, the German caught me. The\nGerman did. And this Germans didn't know I was Jewish because, I think they didn't know\ntoo much what's going on, either. The army people. So they caught me. And they said I was\na spy. He was talking German but I'm Jewish, I understand a little bit.\nHe took me in on the wagon and, \u201cCome with us.\u201d I went with him. And on the way going,\nwas a telephone. The field telephones, you know. He takes up a shovel, told me to dig. And\nso he told me to dig a grave for me. He told me -- he showed me what he wants. To cover up\nthe cables. And he took me into the -- with the leaders, standing in a room there in the farm.\nAnd he told -- just got somebody there. Told me to go lay down. I came there in there -- a lot\nof farmers laying in there. People were known. And I was afraid for them, too. It was\nnighttime. They told us to lay down. They were laying down. And I couldn't sleep. They was\n-- they fall asleep. And I was trying to go out. I went into the side and made believe I have to\nmake -- and the Germans comes up, I went away. And I tried to go through the barns. Some\nof farmers had two doors. One that used to come in horse and wagon. They should be one\nway out and one way out. So I was trying to get in through the -- some of them had ceilings\nand I couldn't go through the ceilings. So finally I went into that barn, was two doors. I\nopened the back door. In that barn was horses. They started to run and they made noise. Was\nthat time when they take off the grain from the fields. They have straw. They have to put\nthem up on the field to dry. I was hiding there. And I was hiding there 'til it got quiet. And I\nstarted to run. I was running, running, running. Finally, I came to -- it got daytime. And I was\nlaying, all around, surrounded me Germans.\nWhat could I do? I can't lay here. I picked myself up. I started to walk. And I walked and the\none German comes over to me, told me, showed me to cut grass. I can't cut. I told him I am\nnot a farmer. They let me go. I went -- I met one farmer, he said \"Come with me.\" He was\nrunning away also from his home because of the shooting, and fire, burning. He took me\nwith him. He said \"Come with me. I got food and we're going to eat.\" He took me into the\nwoods and I was laying in the woods and was organization -- they call it Akowcy.* They\nused to kill -- they didn't like Germans. They didn't like Jews. They didn't like the Russians,\neither. And I was laying there. They came around and looked at me. Somebody let them\nknow -- they looked at me. Soon they walked away from me, I walked away to a different\nplace. I was hiding somewhere else. I didn't trust them, either. I was laying for a day there,\nand finally the Russians came in. The Russians came in but -- the Russians came in and I\nwent to my town. I came to the town --",
        "Q: When was this?",

        "Q: In '44.",
        "A: '44. And I came into the town. I was the only one. The only Jew. Everybody's looking at me\nlike I was a ghost -- came in. And there were a lot of them scared, because they were living\nin my house, my parent's house, and everything. And they were afraid I was going to start on\nthem. So it was a foolish thing for me to do anything like this, because what I going to do all\nby myself? Start up with them now? So I disappeared, I went away. I didn't want to stay in\nthere too long.\nI went away to a farm. The farmer came into him he came in to eat. He gave me this, and he\nsaid, \"At night, I want to sleep, go to sleep and don't tell me where you going to sleep.\" And\nhe was afraid somebody come in \u2014 \u201cDon't tell me where you go.\u201d He was a real honest, good\nman, he saved about ten Jews. Not by him hiding, by him. They build themself bunkers in\nthese underground places. Two kids, two young kids was there for two years hiding\nthemself. Two young kids and they came up alive from there.\n* The members of the AK, or Armia Krajowa; Home [underground] Army (Polish).",

        "Q: So you were hiding with this farmer who had saved some Jewish people; this is when we\nstopped.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: When you stopped talking, you were telling me about this farmer who saved some Jewish\npeople and you hid there, and he said, \"Don't tell me where you're going.\" What happened\nnext?",
        "A: Well, after a while I slept over there. I went up to -- well, I took chances. There was nobody\nthere, nobody. No punishment. Everybody did something without firing up a lot of people.\nThe Germans surrounded the Jews, and they were interested nobody should know about it.\nBut a lot of people, a lot of Polacks told me who was there, and I was afraid for them, too,\nbecause there was a lot of people they -- one is to be a owned a lot of property there in all the\ngood. He took me in, he gave me to eat. The other although I couldn't; I did not. One fellow,\nhe did a lot of harm to Jews, found a lot of Jews. Once he came over to me, and he took me\nin and he took me in a corner and he said, \"See, I got a gun. If I could kill you, nobody\nwould do anything to me.\" So why did he want to do those things? \"I'm not doing anything\nto anybody, and I'm not doing anything.\" He said, \"Let me go in,\" and we were living, then,\nafter a while, the other people came out, the Jews who survived the also from my town. And\nhe took away their house, took away all two rooms on the farms, the Polacks that were living\nthere.",
        "Q: But you're back in your town now?",
        "A: We're back in the town. We were living there for a couple weeks with a border guard, a\nRussian soldier. You know, we had put shutters on the windows and closed the shutters at\nnight. And I had a gun at the time, under the pillow. After a while we went in other states\nand other cities.

        "Q: So even after the Russians had liberated this area, the Poles were still killing Jews?",
        "A: They couldn't live in our town. They have to move away from my town. I went to a town\nwas about 80 miles away. You know, we stayed there in that town, and after another day or\nSO, we went away to a big town, L\u00e9dz. I was there for a while. There was no future for the\nJews. I didn't want to stay in that country anymore. From there, I went to Czechoslovakia.\nWhen I came to Czechoslovakia, there were standing, there, over there, so many people\nthere, there was no room, no food or nothing. From there, I went through the border at night\nto Germans. The American people, American soldier didn't let us go through.\nAt night, we went through the gates because I was watching the spotlights.

        "Q: So what was the name of the DP camp you were in?",
        "A: Fohrenwald. And the first couple of months I was Kirshenreid (ph), was probably, they took\naway a couple of houses from the Germans and they gave us their quarters there to sleep in\nfor a while. After a while, they had nobody there, and I found out the same friend we were\nwith in one concentration camp, he lives in Fohrenwald, so I went there. There was a DP\ncamp there, so I lived in there for a year or a little more.",
        "Q: It was difficult there?",
        "A: It was a lot of monkey business going on. It was plenty of food supply from -- the UNRRA\u2019\nsupplied a lot of food. A lot of food, a lot of people that took the food that sold it on black\nmarket. And they didn't -- they gave us anything that cooked that made out of -- like soup so\nthey put in more water. Instead of putting in some more nourishment, they put in more water.\nThey sold the stuff. Sold the stuff to somebody else. They made a lot of money. A lot of it\ngoing on, Jews alone. And I was surprised to hear about it, to see about it because the same\npeople were almost dead already, they could take advantage on us. Yet, this -- you have to\nstay in line for everything, to come on in. They didn't let you do anything. You couldn't sell\nanything. You couldn't do it, because they, the UNRRA, even wouldn't allow a citizen to sell\nto any business. What was going on, business there, they were bringing bowls or steal them\nthere and they were selling them. They got the money. We didn't have the money. I didn't\nwork after they had the money, so I had to live from food that they gave me.",
        "Q: So you were there about a year?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: You were there about one year?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: In the camp in Fohrenwald.",
        "A: More there -- I came in 1947, it was 1946, '47, we came in April of 1947 to the United\nStates. I was there until that time.",
        "Q: Was it difficult to get a visa to the United States?",
        "A: Well, the visa, I didn't get the visa because she had a sister, my wife, and I found out -- we\nfound out, the address. We had a soldier, an American soldier came in and we were talking\nto him. So he put it in the paper, and they were looking. She gave the name. My wife gave\nthe name of the sister, the name, the family name. And they were looking up, and she looked\n-- the other sister had a friend. Francis' (ph) son was in the army in Germany. He was in the\narmy in Germany, so she located him. She told him, so he came to us.\n\u201d United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\nHe looked us up, and he came to us. We started talks with him and finally he located us and\nthe sister, sent us a letter and even sent us some money. So it was a little better at that time\nwe had to buy some food, the money. And then we began to get registered to go to the\nUnited States. And her sister, she send me the papers, her sister she sent me the papers, and\nwe came to the Unites States in 1947.",
        "Q: Now, when you were in the DP camp, were you allowed to come and go as much as you\nwanted?",
        "A: Yeah, well, a lot to go far back. We wasn't allowed to do any business.",
        "Q: Why wouldn't they let you do business?",
        "A: Because this was a law from UNRRA. We were not supposed to do it, because they give you\nto eat. It was, they used to take in, they used to send in a lot of cigarettes. They gave to the\npeople. The cigarettes never they gave it to the people. They made a flyer, they said this, the\ncigarettes was sold already. They made a flyer, and they said it was burnt, it got burnt. They\ndidn't have cartons left over. It was a lot of things going on. There's was a lot -- then the very\nrich came here; they bought property and hotels out of somebody else's tragedies.",
        "Q: I want to just for a minute, ask you a few more questions about the Treblinka uprising,\nbecause this is very important to know about. Well, you told me that when you were\norganizing there, were maybe only a dozen people or so. But at the time of the uprising, were\nmore people involved?",
        "A: Well, everybody was involved at that time, really, because we started to shooting -- most of\nthe war. They couldn't, they didn't know where, how to handle themselves, how to take\nadvantage. Of course, the things that went out from there was not so hot, that went out of\nthere. But to stay alive, that was the hardest thing to do, because that time was -- if they\nneeded, they were afraid to trust anybody. They were afraid to knock on farmers\u2019 door, but\nyou didn\u2019t know their priorities. Sometimes they could take, they took in a lot of people.\nThey took then their money; they killed them. You see, that's what they did, a lot of them.\nThey said, \"Come in, come in, come in.\" And that night, they took them, they killed them.\nThey took away their money, and they buried you somewhere, wherever they wanted to do,\nyou see. There was a lot of people disappeared. We didn't know where they had disappeared,\nbut there were several at that time.",
        "Q: So there people from all the different parts of Treblinka who got involved at the end, during\nthe uprising?",
        "A: Not too many, as I tell you.",
        "Q: A couple hundred people?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. But at that time there was almost a thousand people in that camp yet.",
        "Q: And they all got involved in the uprising?",
        "A: I don't know, this I cannot tell if they were involved. I know where -- I saw a lot of people\nrunning. A lot of people -- but they, they weren't successful. They weren't successful.",
        "Q: How were you able to communicate to prisoners in other parts of the camp, in the upper\ncamp, for example?",
        "A: The other camp didn't communicate, no communication at all with others except separately.\nThey worked by the dead people. With that people there were no communications at all.\nThey didn't have any communication.",
        "Q: Did they know about the uprising?",
        "A: I cannot say about it at all.",
        "Q: You told me you set this time, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock, whenever, and you had to let everybody\nknow that this was the time. Were you able to get word to different parts of the camp?",
        "A: Well, we had to get word, the words was given before we went out to work. They give them\nthe words. And before they went out to work, they gave them the -- told them at that time\nthey wanted this. \u201cDo it.\u201d That's the only communication they got. After they went out to\nwork, each group went a different direction, you know. Then we couldn't communicate with\nthem anymore. We couldn't even know -- like myself, when I was running, a lot of people\nwere running in different directions over there. Some of them, most of them were going\ndifferent directions.",
        "Q: Right, but when people go out to work, they went to different places in the camp so they\ncould then tell people in other places, yes?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Even the people who worked in the upper camp, did they sleep in the same place as you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you all slept in the same place.",
        "A: We all slept in the same place, yeah.",
        "Q: So you could communicate then?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, okay. I think I understand it.",
        "A: Well, see, everybody -- somebody met somebody from each group for them to work, one\nperson to two people, they know it. You see, they are supposed to let know the rest of the\ngroup, you see. They couldn't give everybody the time. They gave it to only a few people\neach whenever they -- the leader or something, them, this or that is the time. The rest of the\npeople couldn't know because there's too much, too much of a risk.",
        "Q: I guess this 1s what I didn't understand before. Even though you had no communication\nduring the workday with people --",
        "A: At night we all came to the same place. The same kitchen, and we ate together. They were at\nthe table or underneath or something like this.",
        "Q: Then that was also a way that you could learn what was happening in other parts of the\ncamp, too?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you were one of the leaders?",
        "A: I was trusted from them.",
        "Q: And why at this point -- because at other times you said, \"You know, there's no hope. They'll\nkill us.\" Why at this point did you decide to take the risk?",
        "A: Well, there's no risk. Was no risk; I was dead anyway. What have I got to risk? I didn't risk\nnothing. There was no risk involved, see. I was running away, and I wouldn't want to\nsurvive, was a risk. But running away, at that time was no risk at all because I was a dead\nperson anyway. This, dead sentence because I was a Jew. That's all that it 1s. I did at that\ntime have no choice. There was no risk at all.",
        "Q: Do you think that you got any implicit help from non-Jews at the camp, I mean, that maybe\nthey looked the other way, or --",
        "A: That's what we were waiting for. When we were waiting, sometimes maybe somebody,\nmaybe somebody will come do some bomb, do something. Of course, they had opportunity.\nThey were strong, they had the tools, they had ratchets, and they had everything. They could\nhave done, they didn't do. The Germans were so scared themselves, and one started to run\nand one was standing with a gun in his hand and he couldn't shoot. He was shaking like this\n[indicating no]. They were so scared like that. They couldn't, they couldn't --",
        "Q: Well, the day -- I read that on the day of the uprising, it was a hot day, that it was a Sunday\nor Monday\u2019?",
        "A: I can't remember the date when it come at that time.",
        "Q: And that everybody, all the Ukrainian guards, were down at the river swimming and getting\ndrunk?",
        "A: No, there was no place there to swim. They're not near the water to swim there. They are\nnowhere near, this is nothing there. It 1s just unbelievable that -- I cannot say, because it was\na desert. There was no water. Even the ditches are so deep there to get water. They gave us\nto eat potatoes not washed even, with the dirt. When I used to eat my potato when I came in\nthe beginning and the lots of people were there, I still got the peels from the potato. And they\npicked it up in the dirt on the ground, and they ate it. That's a step that I didn't -- I couldn't\nbelieve it. I couldn't say it then, because I wasn't hungry at that time yet. Or what they did\nlike this.",
        "Q: Do you remember a Mr. Bloch? Do you remember an SS officer by the name of Kuttner?",
        "A: SS officer?",
        "Q: Kuttner?",
        "A: What's the name? Keloa, Keloa (ph)? Another one was, what's the name, Lakla (ph)? We\ncall him Lakla, a nice young fellow, big fellow. That was the court that I was a witness for at\nthat time frame. This Keloa-- of course, nobody has the same name, real name. Didn't call\nthem by the real name because we make the different name because they shouldn't know\nwhat we're talking about. You see, that's what I mean, change the name to another name. I\nknow it and that second fellow know it over there, but the German didn't know then we call\nit when we mention his name.",
        "Q: Did you know -- I can't pronounce this right, but was there a Dr. Chorazyck1? You don't\nknow that name? You don't know people's names, different. I understand. I understand.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: When you were running out of the camp, did you see it burning yet, or was it not yet?",
        "A: It was not burning yet. It was started to burn because when they started that thing was\npeople, some people work there, disinfect us they used to call it. They disinfected the\nclothing, the places there, the clothes; the Germans did this. That day we found out that they\nhave some gasoline. Instead of putting in disinfection, we told them to put in the gasoline\ninside in the tanks. They set it go around, spraying with that thing with the disinfection, they\nspray it with this. It wasn't so easy to catch on fire because we didn't have too many matches\nto spare. So we had it burning there. After -- I was running, I see it burning, in fact, one\nGerman got killed. I didn't look back, didn't want to look back because I was running.",
        "Q: So they were going to use the gasoline or the kerosene to maybe be a distraction, or to start\nburning the camp?",
        "A: Burning the camp. Started slowly, yeah. We were burning the camp.",
        "Q: So the plan was just that at five o'clock everybody was going to run? That was the whole\nplan?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That no one was going to shoot. They were just going to run out?",
        "A: Well, say, in this cases, see, none of them took any risk of anything because you or your\npeople were caged like a tiger or some sort of other animals. You don't -- any chance you\nhave, you want to jump at another day because there's not another chance. You didn't, no risk\ninvolved.",
        "Q: But what I'm trying to understand is the whole plan was that at a certain time everybody was\njust going to storm the gates, basically. You weren't going to meet; you were just all going to\nrun out?",
        "A: No, but we didn't storm the gates. Everybody was outside the gates. They were working\noutside the gates, not inside. Most of the people like me, I was inside the gate because our\nshops were inside the gate. The shoemaker was inside his gate. The locksmith was inside the\ngate. The rest of the people worked at different places outside the gates, under the\nsupervision of Ukrainians or Germans. We were inside the gates, working.",
        "Q: So the plan then only was that at a certain time wherever you were, you left?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was there anything else that you had planned on doing in order to make this successful?",
        "A: Nothing, no other plan could we do. The best plan we had was to just run away from -- they\nwere outside the gate and everyone could run. But the only way of this would be we were all\ntogether, and we couldn't stay all together. We couldn't -- even we could keep ourselves\ntogether, 1t was a very big risk to stay ourselves together, because we could be caught. As a\nmatter of fact, a day after I was running away, I was afraid to stay somewhere, I was in the\nfields. Not even the farms, because I was afraid they going to come and look all over for us.\nSo I was not able to live with this risk. So this was no -- any risk was nothing. Only we\ncouldn't help each other. Everybody was solo there. Everybody was saying they couldn't. I\ncouldn't have helped anybody if I had no way, I can't help myself. I can't help it, though.",
        "Q: I'm just trying to visualize what the guards were doing, as everybody started running.",
        "A: They was shaking. I saw -- like I told you before. One general was standing with a gun; he\ncouldn't shoot. He was shaking. He was afraid. They only were not afraid when they had the\ngun above us. When they started to -- we could have -- didn't have to run nowhere and burn,\nthey all think and kill them all of the Germans, but we had the courage, see. The resistance\nwas so low, but this was a desperate people, they were afraid to do anything. And another\nthing, as a matter of fact, the Germans used go around, \"When you going run? You going to\nrun now? Where you going to run? Where will you go? You have nowhere left to go.\" This\nis a Safe place, you stay there...that's what they tell me.",
        "Q: When you think about this now, many years later, what comes to mind? What images are\nyou stuck with?",
        "A: The image I'm stuck with, the people around the whole world how did they let it happen like\nthis? The United States knowing about it. The Arab countries know. England knowing about\nbecause they had spies all over. They told them everything. Why did they wait until they\nkilled off six million? Why they didn't do this before? Why they didn't do -- they could have\ndone something to spoil the whole thing. But then nobody did anything, nobody wanted to\ndo anything. Because it was only Jews involved, not -- but they didn't know how many other\nnations got killed, also. The Czechoslovakian, Polish, all the country. Anybody said anything\nto them, they killed them. Even Gypsies, what did the Gypsies do, didn't set a, you know, set\na trap for the German people. They didn't do that. They put them in a concentration camp. I\nsaw them coming in. They came in with -- they were looking around. They didn't know\nwhat's happened to them, Gypsies.",
        "Q: How do you think that you were able to get through all of this?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: How do you think that you were personally were able to get through this?",
        "A: Personally, I wanted to see what -- either it's going to happen, after everything is over, I want\nto see. Everything I was fighting for, I want to see what they were going to do to the German\npeople, what they were doing to the other people. All the other people, like the -- what's the\nname, the Arabs. They helped the Germans. The other thing I wanted to see somebody that's\na friend of theirs, everything was -- I was so much disappointed after everything was over. I\nlooked and then what did it do to Germany? They got a few people, they gave them a trial,\nfew people. The most of them, they knew all of this came in. Well, clothing came into\nGermany that didn't know, didn't ask no questions from where it comes? A lot of everything\nwas getting, the gold, the Germans take a vacation. Sent satchels full of gold and diamonds\nto Germany every couple of months to get 1t away. The Germans didn't get nothing from\nanybody, from the Jews. Half a million Jews got killed in Treblinka. So everybody had\nsomething, a chain or earrings or anything. They know, but they didn't -- everybody kept\nquiet at the size clothes.\nEnd of Tape #4\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "Q: You told me you set this time, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock, whenever, and you had to let everybody\nknow that this was the time. Were you able to get word to different parts of the camp?",

        "Q: Even the people who worked in the upper camp, did they sleep in the same place as you?",

        "Q: Then that was also a way that you could learn what was happening in other parts of the\ncamp, too?",
        "Q: So you were one of the leaders?",
        "Q: And why at this point -- because at other times you said, \"You know, there's no hope. They'll\nkill us.\" Why at this point did you decide to take the risk?",
        "Q: Do you think that you got any implicit help from non-Jews at the camp, I mean, that maybe\nthey looked the other way, or --",
        "Q: Well, the day -- I read that on the day of the uprising, it was a hot day, that it was a Sunday\nor Monday\u2019?",

        "Q: When you were running out of the camp, did you see it burning yet, or was it not yet?",
        "Q: So they were going to use the gasoline or the kerosene to maybe be a distraction, or to start\nburning the camp?",
        "Q: So the plan was just that at five o'clock everybody was going to run? That was the whole\nplan?",

Used to go almost everyday. Except Saturday. Saturday,\nnobody go. Struggle. Was very poor living. Most of them -- nobody had money in the bank.\nWas not even a bank in the city. It was a government, you know; we were -- was satisfied.\nThey say, worm goes into horseradish, tends not to do so good. That is what happened to us.\nWe wanted more but couldn't ask for more. Because that's what 1t was. A small town and too\n' The town of Stoczek is also referred to as Stok.\nmany of everything.\nToo many of everything. Like too many tailors, too many shoemakers, too many carpenters,\neverything. We used to go and -- go on -- market, there used to be a market some days. Once\na week, it was a market by us. Just bring it all -- the farmers, they come to bring potatoes.\nOther things, chickens, butters, cheeses. People used to go out to buy it. It was -- somebody\nused to have stands outside, like pushcarts, to sell something to them. That was the living.\n'Til, \u2018til 1939.",
        "A: That was started after the war -- before '39, they used to call them [inaudible]. People used to\ncall them, some dishes to sell outside the market. Then the youngsters, the youngsters -- the\nPolish boys came up and used to throw them around and kick on them. And suddenly it was\nvery hard to stay in business. It started -- this started -- it started this way and we survived.\nWe survived \u2018til, 'til 1939.",
        "A: There were Zionists, yes. Very few. As a matter of fact, I was belonged to the Kibbutz\n[inaudible], to go to kibbutz and go to, after while go to Israel to work. Or else in by us, we\nhad to respect for our parents, and my father said \"No, No.\" He had made [inaudible]. After a\nwhile, I find out he made a lot of money. Because he was butcher, he want I should be a\nbutcher. I could be something else. I'm going to be something else. I could make a better\nliving. There's too many -- too many this. Another brother wanted to be a butcher, and have\ntwo younger brothers, they want -- they will wind up to own carpenters. I didn't --",
        "A: Yeah. I always talked about it with the \u201crun away with,\u201d that term, because it was not\npleasure there. Was nothing. I had four boys. What do you think was to grow up? Like same\nthing \u2014 working. It was not -- even in schools, were afraid to go to school, because they used\nto get beaten up by Polish boys because they were more in -- they started to go to school.\nAnd if you didn't want to go to school, you weren't punished. You didn't have to go to\nschool, because nobody was interested. The government wasn't interested in you didn't go to\nschool.",
        "A: Yes. They go to the same school. Of course, a couple classes -- it was about two or three\nclasses in our town was for Jewish kids only. After a while, the higher classmate have to go\ntogether. What's troubling, you are afraid to go because no-- nobody was, nobody -- it was\nnobody was stopping them to do anything. There was no punishment.",
        "A: No, no. In 1939, 1940 -- '35 -- a lot of Germans on the way from their town came, it's\nPoland. When they used to tell us stories, nobody could believe them. Nobody wanted to\nbelieve them. Even, even in '38, even in '38, they came back and they came into our town\nand they told us a story. We didn't believe it. We didn't believe them when they said, even in\n1939, they took over in Poland. The gentile people used to go, they used to deal with them,\nwith us. They used to buy from the kosher butcher. The Jewish people eat only the front part\nof the meat and the back part used to sell it to them. They used to take it to different big cities\nand sell it there and make a living. They came back from Warsaw and they told us -- they\nsaid that they were going to kill Polish Jews. We didn't pay too much attention.\nWe were, at that time, tied in already, because when the Germans came into house they used\nto beat us up and then let us go. They caught somebody -- as a matter of fact a Jew that was\non the market buy wood. They came in to buy the wood, he bought the wood, that wood was\nstolen. The police, the Germans, they didn't punish the guy who bought -- who stole -- the\nwood. They punished the Jew who bought the wood. He didn't know. He needed the wood,\nhe bought it. So they took him and they send him away to Treblinka. It was Treblinka, not --\nthere was two of them. One of them was just for punishing gentile people. Jewish people, but\nthey did something wrong from the beginning. They didn't take them to kill yet. So that was\nthe start of it.",
        "A: I was the Polish Army, yeah.",
        "A: Was, there was, because a lot of -- they didn't take everybody to the army because some of\nthe numbers like here, you know? So they didn't go. I went. A lot of people went, went to the\narmy. I was in the army then, in the reserve. The war started, they took me into the reserve. I\nwas in Warsaw, the capital. I was supposed to be -- whenever I had a gun in my hands, I\nnever put a bullet in it. It was, it was taken over by them like, like nothing. They used to\nbomb that city and people were killed, the horses were killed. They used to go out, the\npeople used to go out, take knives, cut off pieces of meat from the horses, from the dead\nhorses outside. They used to take 1t home and cook it and eat these things.",
        "A: Well, after the war, after the war finished, the Germans took over. I came home. I came with\nthe [inaudible]. We went to buy a piece -- steal by a farmer. We used to sell it to a make a\nliving. I started to make a living. Worse and worse. We couldn't go out, they locked us in.\nThey put us in a lot of punishments. And sometimes at night Germans came in. They didn't\nwant to do it -- they would find something they wanted. They didn't want the stock. They\nwant we should pay money. And have us put to jail. We have to pay them off not to touch us.\nAnd money wasn't around. Couldn't -- couldn't produce, we couldn't make it. We couldn't\ncall into farmers, bring in some stuff. We couldn't go out. So it got tougher and tougher.",
        "A: The Germans occupied this 1939 in -- I think it was before the Jewish holidays. In October,\nsomething like that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It was in summertime, I know this.",
        "A: It was at that time it was occupied.",

        "A: After I left Warsaw, as a matter of fact, I was a -- they had keep us about two weeks. The\nGermans kept us. And then they gave us the leaves and I started to want to go home. I had to\nwalk about 70 miles home.",
        "A: They were there. They were all over Poland right away. Because they came in, they came in\nthere, and as a matter of fact, in our side of the town, the Germans -- it was Russia and\nGermany did business, in the beginning. They did business. They used to bring this -- they\nused to trade wood for coal, a lot of things, they did business in the beginning, yeah. So the\nGermans were there. And it used to make me almost -- took people to work everyday almost\nin our town.",
        "A: It was a ghetto, yeah. The ghetto was -- we couldn't -- we weren't allowed to go out to do\nbusiness anywhere else. Only sneaked in through the different roads because we were living\nthere, but you know -- sneak in, sneak in. That's why we survived.",
        "A: No schools for anybody. Not even -- not only for Jews, but for the non-Jews, too. No school\nat all. The occupation, the occupation of the Germans, there was no school, no.",
        "A: There was no synagogue. It got burnt. The synagogue got burnt, half of the town got burnt.",
        "A: Not the Poles. The Poles, most of them were lots of farmers. The others managed to do\nsomething. They could go around and they could maneuver around from one town to the\nother. But there was no punishment for them. They said that they didn't, they didn't suffer\nthat much a loss.",
        "A: Only worker, yeah. The people that were farmers, they used to bring in some stuff, a pair of\nshoes. Tailors, because they didn't have -- very few Gentile people were tailors. Most of the\nJews were the tailors and they brought their stuff to them. They didn't go nowhere. They\ncould -- they were allowed to come into church. They were allowed to come into the city.\nBut they weren't allowed. The Nazis, they gave them money, they brought them in some\nfood. Flour, potatoes, other things, too. Only for Jews, for a lot of Jews this was too many for\nus, especially for our profession, was very risky. You couldn't -- you weren't allowed to go to\nfarmer to buy these cattle. It was very risky. If we killed the cattle, it was also very risky.\nYou were not supposed to do it.",
        "A: I was out of work, yeah. We lived whatever we could get. I used to buy the flour, we used to\nmake our own bread. We used to do -- we had water. Salt. And that was good. We didn't ask\nany more. So long we had a piece of bread on the -- most of the -- feed the children. Milk\nwas very hard to get, because they didn't have the money to buy the milk from the farmer.",
        "A: Oh, they beat people with when they find them. They didn't came into the houses looking\nfor-- at that time it was not the order yet. They didn't start at that time the order to kill the\npeople yet. The people -- about a year -- about two years -- a year and a half they were --\nthey didn't bother with everybody. They didn't bother them because they made ghettos. And\nthey tried to depress the people. They should give up faster, they shouldn't fight back. They\nwant to depress them. They have more strength than to lose because they didn't have enough\nfood to eat -- the other couple kids was -- your family had seven kids, too. And you have to\nfeed them, each one of them -- 10 pounds potatoes was not enough to feed 10 people, nine\npeople.",
        "A: Hmm?",
        "A: Yeah. They used to catch us. Do work, spent a lot of time to make water digs, to make for\nfarmers, not for ours. And they used to take us, and a lot of people didn't know how to work.\nThey got beaten up. Were not physically fit.",
        "A: Hmm?",
        "A: No shooting. They beat them up. A bullet 1s too much. Save a bullet. Kill them with the\nsticks and anything.",
        "A: Well, they were nice. They didn't bother us. They didn't help either. Many of the local\nfarmers -- we have a lot -- in our profession, we have a lot -- we deal with a lot of farmers. If\nthey come, they try to do--. Really, they was staying away from the Jews. Most of the time,\nthey didn't want -- they wouldn't get in trouble. So I didn't blame them because everybody\nworks for themselves. So it wasn't good for anybody. It wasn't good for the Polish people,\neither. You gave them, told them to bring in stuff but they need it for themself. And like\nmeat, and everything, they confiscated and everything you want, they did with that.",
        "A: Oh, you mean concentration camp. To Treblinka, you mean?",
        "A: Yeah. They used to go. There was a Judenrat.\u201d You know what a Judenrat is? They took the\nJudenrat and they were responsible -- they came in and they want a supply, some of them\nmade the Jewish. They came in, the Judenrat, the police; got some -- like a list -- and used to\ncome in and take me or take somebody else. They had to supply as many people they\nwanted.",
        "A: Oh, yes. I don't know. I'm going to tell you this. The only way they did that, they had no\nchoice. They had to do something because otherwise -- a lot of them did it, overdid it. Most\nof them had no choice. They had to supply the people.",
        "A: Oh, the most important thing is that they came home that night. If they don't, they get weaker\nevery day. They couldn't work, they couldn't do anything when -- because if you don't eat,\nyou can't produce.",

        "A: Well, it was panic. Everybody else is panicking, everybody is afraid because we saw what's\ngoing on and started to -- they were taking up people from Warsaw already. They were\ntaking up, bringing from the big cities. Scared. We heard about the Russians. From the\nbeginning Russia lost the war. We hoped, but the hope never came. It came too late. So I\ncame in that date when they, after do this.\nThey started to bring in the Jews from [indecipherable]. They needed some helpers. So they\nwent into Warsaw and they told people in Warsaw -- they were starving there in the streets,\nand a lot of people had nothing to eat -- in the ghettos because the poor people didn't have no\nmoney to pay for anything. Everything was so expensive. The rich people didn't want to\nshare with anybody. They thought maybe they want to live for themself. Even they had\nenough, but they didn't -- even they went in to talk to them -- to the big people, the\nmanufacturers there. \"Give us money, we going to buy some ammunition with.\" \u201cDon't\nbother me.\u201d They didn't want nothing to do with them. Because they -- maybe they will fight\nfor themself. Everybody was selfish. They always worried about for themself. After a while,\nthey came into Warsaw, they told the people if you to have a job, working, I'll give you room\nand board. So a lot of -- came out and said they want to go. They took them, they put them in\n-- was about 300 people there. At Treblinka, before I came there. And they started to\nbuilding the dam. Only they were so poorly, the help was so poorly because it was starving\nbefore, they had nothing to eat. What are they going to do? Came there, in the start of they\ngave me shovels to dig. To make the grave for the -- prepare for the people -- for the gas\nchamber. To make -- they started to do that. They couldn't do the job. They took a couple\ndays. They took them. They used to line them up in three, take them into a grave and shoot\nthem. Then they came into our town. And they took us and they came in. It was a Thursday\nmorning. I remember that day, that morning, and heard something was going on.",
        "A: It was in '42.",
        "A: It was summertime. I know it was about May or June. Because I know down the field,\nbecause I was hiding there in the field. And I jumped up to the window. Back, back in our\nroom there was a field there. And people and I hided myself there. And one Ukrainian came\nthere and find me there. And came with a gun, I thought they were going to kill them there.\nHe took me -- he had surrounded the barn, that and 10 boys, young people. He put us in jail\n'til they finish up the whole thing. They took us out; they came in with trucks. They put us on\ntruck; they started to travel to Treblinka. And we were traveling, and there they picked up,\npicked up a couple bicycles there from somebody and put us on our heads. And then we\nwere traveling in a yellow truck. There were three [inaudible]. They used to take -- traveling\nthere they took cigarettes. Some, they were boldy. They lighted up the cigarettes and put\nthem in there and burn them. Finally we came in, took us to that concentration camp,\nTreblinka. And we came up in the truck. And they told -- finally, we finally came into that\npens} onat.\u201d You know what pensjonat means? Like a hotel. Finally we came into Hotel\nTreblinka.",

        "A: I know the town was a railroad place. They had a small stop there. They used to -- trains\nstopped there. So in the way to that station they made an extension, they made an extension\nto that Treblinka, they called it Treblinka. That was a desert. A piece of land unworkable for\nfarmers, just a piece of desert. But they came, when I came in there, when they took us from\nthe truck -- in the truck everybody... Anybody wouldn't have no shovel is going to get killed.\nBut everybody was grabbing -- the shovels, and was maybe 20 left over. And we started to\nwork. Same day we work. And physically, I was built good, strong. People, other people in\nthe town they never did a hard work 1n their life. The skin of their -- it was soft. If you started\nto use a shovel for a long time, you get blisters on the fingers. You can't work. They couldn't\nproduce. So, they were working; they couldn't produce. And it was one German sitting on\nthe top, watching. All were crying. Some people that wouldn't produce used to call him up --\ncome up -- and they took him, they tied in their legs to the -- like a bench. Tie the legs to a\nbench. He told him to bend down, and took off -- put down -- your pants down. He took two\ncanes -- not -- canes and they beat him, one on this side and one on the other side. They beat\nhim up so much, then they took him to the edge from the grave and they pushed him down.\nHe fell over. He refused to stand up. Right away they get him to work. They took him off\nagain and it was finished. He was finished, couldn't do nothing. I was trying not to get up\nthere. They didn't hurt me.",
        "A: Weren't in my town yet. I was there about seven months before them. They took me away\nbefore. And they were -- 1t was hoped -- they used to come -- they allowed --they made a\ndeal with the Germans, they let one girl come in every week and bring a -- some bread.\nBring in and some notes that they gave. \u201cWe are working on it, you're going to be free.\nYou're going free, you're going free.\u201d I had opportunity to run away that time, also. Because\n-- but I didn't want to run away because I was afraid for my family. Because if they know I\nrun away, they know where I came. They going to punish my family. They were waiting and\nwaiting. And when we got hope, 'til the time came, and they took, they took us out, all of\nthem, about a couple hundred -- about a hundred people -- 120 people -- and they stood us in\nline and said, \"Who wants to go home, and who wants to stay here?\" Everyone wants to go\nhome. So I went in the line -- \u201cI want to go home.\u201d Right after, they didn't let us go. They let\nus go and I went in the -- back to sleep. And I was laying in the bed and something came into\nmy mind. If they going to be free, I'm going to be free -- a week later, two weeks later. I went\nback to the line, I want to stay. So those people, they separated. They took them a different\nplace. I never saw them again. They took them a different place and started to bring in the\ncars with Jews to kill them off. Those people were with the dead ones. And I was working\nwith the working people. They have to build beds for the -- and build barracks for them, I\nwas working for them. That's why I was working. And they used to bring -- every day they\nstarted to bring in a hundred cars, and each car was that -- a hundred people in each car. In\nthe beginning they didn't -- when they came off the car, I wasn't there. Only the workers, if\nthey needed something to fix, I was -- I used to go up there. There was some soon as they got\noff the car, the people were glad they were coming off, because a hundred people in the car\nand the trip used to take four or five hours. They'd keep them for 24 hours. It made them so\nweak, they were -- they couldn't -- they didn't care anymore.\nSo they told them, the first thing, take off the jacket. After -- and the overcoat, then the\njacket. And 'til they came to the end, they were naked. And they were in line to go, they were\nput in the concentration camp, in the chamber, the gas chamber. I saw the gas chamber\nbefore they started to build because I was there and was doing some work there. And I\ncouldn't, because my destination, I couldn't even think about it. There was going to be\nsomething to kill people. I thought it was looked like a shower. Looked -- openings on the\nceilings like water will come, you know. That's what I figured. I didn't figure they would do\nthis thing, you know.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: I helped them build it, yeah. But all the work there was -- I used to go to the forest, I cut --\nchopped young trees and bring it in. I used to go and a German used to take me and a few\npeople together and we used to go bring in the -- those things to build there.",

        "A: The gas chamber I wasn't building because it was professional people was making bricks,\nyou see. This was people, I don't know, I think was Germans allowed to build it -- build this\nthing. They built one, one small in -- on the first grave. They put in the people and they\ncovered them with dirt and cloths there. And after a while, they stopped for a couple weeks\nand they came in, a lot of mechanics came in. They built another one. A big gas chamber.\nBigger one. And they took in, they took in steam shovels to build, to dig. After a while, they\ndidn't put them in the graves anymore. They made -- from the tracks from the railroad, they\nmade like a -- like a screen -- laid like this -- and they put them at the -- in the fire in the\nbottom that went in. And they used to, they used to dig up the people that were buried\nbefore: a year ago, six months ago, they used to dig them up and they with the steam shovels\nand I used to see from my inside where I was working -- I used to see a hand, a foot, there\nwas bodies. It was such a smell that people got -- a lot of people got sick there. Died off in\nthat thing. Well, I had mine -- what's the name -- typhus -- before I went in. I was lucky that\ntime I didn't catch it because I was -- before I went in the concentration camp I was sick and\nnothing had survived.",

The war -- some days they took, they took people. They started to get scared,\nthought maybe, everybody was disgusted. Maybe we will started to make an uprise. They\nstarted to -- they took the people, they took -- they put all of them on one lot in a circle, and\nthey were in the middle and they told us. They took two people out of there and they said,\n\"These two people want to run away.\" So they need somebody to make a hanging noose --\nwhat do you call it? To hang them up. To make a pole like this and one stick like this and\ntwo like this, and picked people to make that thing. And they hung them by the legs. Not by\nthe head. And they were hollering. There was -- \"What are you waiting for? You think they\ngoing to do -- you going to go out?\" And we were standing in line, standing there and\nhelpless.

At that time was, even at the time was a Jewish holiday.\nBigger the transport was. Put in thousand people. Sometime six hundred people. All depends\non the day, whatever they get.",
        "A: Yeah. The trains, was not room all the cars could come in. Because was not big enough to fit\nin all the cars. The rest of the -- they separated the cars. They left others outside, some to\nfinish up this thing. And a lot of cars came in again.",

        "A: I saw what was happening. I wasn't, wasn't involved with taking care of those people. But I\nwas involved at sometimes seeing them, going into work there. And I used to see them.

And a matter of fact, once I\nwas working there outside, and one child, young boy, was running away with his -- got\nseparated from his mother. He was running away and I saw him come in and said -- he was\ntalking to me, I should help him. So I look at him, and, what can I do? I was afraid to even to\ngo near him.

They came off the, the -- and they looked like, where\nare they? They must have -- didn't know, but, or something, not in some countries they didn't\ntook up all of them. They left some people, they couldn't catch them, some of them.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Because they probably didn't want the people -- the people in their country should know\nwhere they take them.\nThat was the reason. That's what I figure out. That that's supposed to be the reason. Because\nthey \u2014 Poland, they didn't care because Polish people they didn't, they agreed with them,\nbecause most -- a lot of concentration camps were all in Poland. Most concentration not in\nanother country. They wouldn't allowed them to have this.",

It was by the\nbuilding line, you understand, and I said I had to, I had to be in a lot of places.",
        "A: No, I didn't see this. This was inside. They took them inside already, cutting the hair, pulling\nthe teeth. This I can't tell you, because I didn't see that thing. Only thing I saw this: I saw at\nthat time, one night they took us to work there, and they had bundles of clothes to put in the\nsame trains that took the people; they put in all the clothes there. And they shipped them to\nGermany. And a lot of people went in hiding between the clothes and they jumped off the\ntrain on the way out. But they, a few of them, came twice, three times they were there\nbecause nowhere where to go. Most important thing a human being over any other life thing:\nit needs to eat. And the worst part was eating. Hiding itself was bad 1n the wintertime. The\nwinters were heavy. Not like here. The winter's light -- it was very heavy winters. A lot of\nsnow. This was the problem, it lasted too long. See, after they took out the Jews left over\ntook about two years. Two years is a long time. Some people -- those kids were -- their feet\ngot frozen. They couldn't walk; they had to shovel on their behind because they couldn't\nwalk on their feet any more. And nobody wanted -- would get involved. I didn't blame the\npeople, the Polish people because they find out somebody helped a Jew, they came in, they\ntook them out, they killed them, they burned the barns, they burned the house, they burned\neverything. So they were afraid. I don't blame them, those people. I blame the people went\naround to show where a, where a Jew lives. Where you could find a Jew, for a pound of\nsugar.

And a couple, a Jewish couple, saw him and called out a German. And the German\nstarted to run to grab that boy. He grab him, he going to beat him up and he was going to tell\nwhat's going on. Then we decided -- we made it before. We made it a half an hour before.\nSo a lot of people started to run. Everybody was running. Only they didn't know where to\nrun. They didn't -- they were running front and back at the same place because the direction\n-- they were running, they didn't -- a lot of them strange people, not from even Poland, from\ndifferent countries. When I was, my town was from the concentration camp was 15 miles\nonly. I don't know the directions, I know where I walking. And I started to run. I didn't hear\nthe gun that time. I had -- I took some big -- a handle from a chopper -- a big heavy -- and I\ncame -- I was running back and I came to the people inside that was standing there and I say\n\"Come, what are you staying here for? Come on, let's run.\" They weren't running. They\nweren't running. They staying there. They didn't want to run. I was running. I wanted there to\nfind another person. And I came in -- came to the front of my town, it was daytime. I couldn't\ngo into the town, because I was afraid to. I laid down there until 1t got dark. And I went back\nway, not in the front, through the whole town. To the side. And I went into farmer and I\nwanted some water. So he didn't want to give me no water. The farmer had no -- he's afraid,\nhe expects somebody to come to him, he don't want to give him no water. I went away from\nhim. I went to the different farmer. That farmer would give me water because he knows a lot\nof Jews, a couple Jews was hiding somewhere else, and he supplied them with food. So he\nwould give me water. He would probably push me, put me back with the other ones. But I\nwas running and then I laid down because I was tired, nighttime, in the field.\nLaid for a while and after a while I got up and I look around and I didn't know where I am.\nMy mind disappeared. Are they running?",
        "A: No, another man. That one who lives, lives in Brooklyn -- in Miami, yeah. That's the guy. I\nwas -- got up and I find out he didn't know where he was going because he's not from -- he's\nfrom different town. He was following me. He didn't -- yeah, he watched me like a hawk. He\ncouldn't let me go because if I go, he is lost. I went into the woods, finally got into the\nwoods. And started to get daylight. And I see farmers coming into work, and I know them\nthe farmers. And I was afraid to go up. I wouldn't go up. But it comes 12 o'clock and the\nfarmers would go home. Lunch time. And I go out and can take a look around. I find another\ncouple. A boy, a young boy with a sister-in-law. A sister, the husband got killed and he --\nand they was scared for me and I was scared for them. Finally, we got together. Got together\nand they were -- the farmers didn't want to sell them anything, because they didn't have no\nmoney. They didn't want to give them anything. They didn't have no money. That boy used\nto go in at night, to the farmers, and what they put up for the dogs to eat, he used to take it\naway. The food, with a stick, for the dogs, and they lived on it. Then we came there and I\nhad some gold pieces and I gave them this gold piece and they went to the farmer and they\ngot everything. At night, not in daytime. We got everything. Finally, we came, we got food\nto eat. How we going to live? And after the -- we started steal a shovel from the farmer,\ncame into the woods and I dig a hole. I dig the hole, made a place for four people. In the\nplace -- and I covered it up. I chopped up some pieces wood to cover the top. And straw.\nAnd I put the dirt. The same dirt what was the other side, they shouldn't recognize that\nsomething new build there. The dirt was thrown away somewhere far away. There should be\nno dirt and we laid there. At night, I used to go for food. And sometimes I used to take -- was\na lake there -- used to go into the lake and wash us off. Couldn't -- not to wipe us off, to\nwashing off. And that's where we lived for a couple months. For 11 months we were living\nlike this. After 11 months, they started to burn around there. They almost started -- the\nRussians coming to chase the Germans. And the Germans started to burn around all of there\nand I went away to different place. And I was laying in different place before -- the guns\nfrom both sides. And I see the Germans digging in. And I was separated from the group. I\nwas by myself. And I was going to look for them. Finally, the German caught me. The\nGerman did. And this Germans didn't know I was Jewish because, I think they didn't know\ntoo much what's going on, either. The army people. So they caught me. And they said I was\na spy. He was talking German but I'm Jewish, I understand a little bit.\nHe took me in on the wagon and, \u201cCome with us.\u201d I went with him. And on the way going,\nwas a telephone. The field telephones, you know. He takes up a shovel, told me to dig. And\nso he told me to dig a grave for me. He told me -- he showed me what he wants. To cover up\nthe cables. And he took me into the -- with the leaders, standing in a room there in the farm.\nAnd he told -- just got somebody there. Told me to go lay down. I came there in there -- a lot\nof farmers laying in there. People were known. And I was afraid for them, too. It was\nnighttime. They told us to lay down. They were laying down. And I couldn't sleep. They was\n-- they fall asleep. And I was trying to go out. I went into the side and made believe I have to\nmake -- and the Germans comes up, I went away. And I tried to go through the barns. Some\nof farmers had two doors. One that used to come in horse and wagon. They should be one\nway out and one way out. So I was trying to get in through the -- some of them had ceilings\nand I couldn't go through the ceilings. So finally I went into that barn, was two doors. I\nopened the back door. In that barn was horses. They started to run and they made noise. Was\nthat time when they take off the grain from the fields. They have straw. They have to put\nthem up on the field to dry. I was hiding there. And I was hiding there 'til it got quiet. And I\nstarted to run. I was running, running, running. Finally, I came to -- it got daytime. And I was\nlaying, all around, surrounded me Germans.\nWhat could I do? I can't lay here. I picked myself up. I started to walk. And I walked and the\none German comes over to me, told me, showed me to cut grass. I can't cut. I told him I am\nnot a farmer. They let me go. I went -- I met one farmer, he said \"Come with me.\" He was\nrunning away also from his home because of the shooting, and fire, burning. He took me\nwith him. He said \"Come with me. I got food and we're going to eat.\" He took me into the\nwoods and I was laying in the woods and was organization -- they call it Akowcy.* They\nused to kill -- they didn't like Germans. They didn't like Jews. They didn't like the Russians,\neither. And I was laying there. They came around and looked at me. Somebody let them\nknow -- they looked at me. Soon they walked away from me, I walked away to a different\nplace. I was hiding somewhere else. I didn't trust them, either. I was laying for a day there,\nand finally the Russians came in. The Russians came in but -- the Russians came in and I\nwent to my town. I came to the town --",

So it was a foolish thing for me to do anything like this, because what I going to do all\nby myself? Start up with them now? So I disappeared, I went away. I didn't want to stay in\nthere too long.\nI went away to a farm. The farmer came into him he came in to eat.

From there, I went through the border at night\nto Germans. The American people, American soldier didn't let us go through.\nAt night, we went through the gates because I was watching the spotlights. They weren't on\nat the border. We came to Germany to the first city that connected to Poland. And we were\nthere--",
        "A: Terezpol (ph)",
        "A: I don't know, I can't tell -- 1t was summertime, I know for sure, because there was no way\ncold weather. Yeah, it was cold! It was winter, 1t was wintertime, because everything was\nfrozen there. Even the bathrooms there, we couldn't use it.",
        "A: '44.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: End of '44, yeah. End of '44, because we got -- '44 it was, because when we got alone, I\nmean, '45, '44, because '45 was in Germany. We came to Germany and for a while we were\nthere.",
        "A: The war was over 1n '44.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: We were there, then when Germany came, we went to the DP camp. We were living there,\nalso, three families in one room. Four, at that time 1t was, yeah.",
        "A: Four families in our room.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: I got married to Norma after the war.",
        "A: I met my wife in '44.",
        "A: Vengrov. When I went away from my town, I was there.",
        "A: Yeah, in Germany, she got sick on the way. We came to Germany, she went to the hospital.",
        "A: Fohrenwald. And the first couple of months I was Kirshenreid (ph), was probably, they took\naway a couple of houses from the Germans and they gave us their quarters there to sleep in\nfor a while. After a while, they had nobody there, and I found out the same friend we were\nwith in one concentration camp, he lives in Fohrenwald, so I went there. There was a DP\ncamp there, so I lived in there for a year or a little more.",
        "A: It was a lot of monkey business going on. It was plenty of food supply from -- the UNRRA\u2019\nsupplied a lot of food. A lot of food, a lot of people that took the food that sold it on black\nmarket. And they didn't -- they gave us anything that cooked that made out of -- like soup so\nthey put in more water. Instead of putting in some more nourishment, they put in more water.\nThey sold the stuff. Sold the stuff to somebody else. They made a lot of money. A lot of it\ngoing on, Jews alone. And I was surprised to hear about it, to see about it because the same\npeople were almost dead already, they could take advantage on us. Yet, this -- you have to\nstay in line for everything, to come on in. They didn't let you do anything. You couldn't sell\nanything. You couldn't do it, because they, the UNRRA, even wouldn't allow a citizen to sell\nto any business. What was going on, business there, they were bringing bowls or steal them\nthere and they were selling them. They got the money. We didn't have the money. I didn't\nwork after they had the money, so I had to live from food that they gave me.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: More there -- I came in 1947, it was 1946, '47, we came in April of 1947 to the United\nStates. I was there until that time.",
        "A: Well, the visa, I didn't get the visa because she had a sister, my wife, and I found out -- we\nfound out, the address. We had a soldier, an American soldier came in and we were talking\nto him. So he put it in the paper, and they were looking. She gave the name. My wife gave\nthe name of the sister, the name, the family name. And they were looking up, and she looked\n-- the other sister had a friend. Francis' (ph) son was in the army in Germany. He was in the\narmy in Germany, so she located him. She told him, so he came to us.\n\u201d United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\nHe looked us up, and he came to us. We started talks with him and finally he located us and\nthe sister, sent us a letter and even sent us some money. So it was a little better at that time\nwe had to buy some food, the money. And then we began to get registered to go to the\nUnited States. And her sister, she send me the papers, her sister she sent me the papers, and\nwe came to the Unites States in 1947.",
        "A: Yeah, well, a lot to go far back. We wasn't allowed to do any business.",
        "A: Because this was a law from UNRRA. We were not supposed to do it, because they give you\nto eat. It was, they used to take in, they used to send in a lot of cigarettes. They gave to the\npeople. The cigarettes never they gave it to the people. They made a flyer, they said this, the\ncigarettes was sold already. They made a flyer, and they said it was burnt, it got burnt. They\ndidn't have cartons left over. It was a lot of things going on. There's was a lot -- then the very\nrich came here; they bought property and hotels out of somebody else's tragedies.",
        "A: Well, everybody was involved at that time, really, because we started to shooting -- most of\nthe war. They couldn't, they didn't know where, how to handle themselves, how to take\nadvantage. Of course, the things that went out from there was not so hot, that went out of\nthere. But to stay alive, that was the hardest thing to do, because that time was -- if they\nneeded, they were afraid to trust anybody. They were afraid to knock on farmers\u2019 door, but\nyou didn\u2019t know their priorities. Sometimes they could take, they took in a lot of people.\nThey took then their money; they killed them. You see, that's what they did, a lot of them.\nThey said, \"Come in, come in, come in.\" And that night, they took them, they killed them.\nThey took away their money, and they buried you somewhere, wherever they wanted to do,\nyou see. There was a lot of people disappeared. We didn't know where they had disappeared,\nbut there were several at that time.",
        "A: Not too many, as I tell you.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. But at that time there was almost a thousand people in that camp yet.",
        "A: I don't know, this I cannot tell if they were involved. I know where -- I saw a lot of people\nrunning. A lot of people -- but they, they weren't successful. They weren't successful.",
        "A: The other camp didn't communicate, no communication at all with others except separately.\nThey worked by the dead people. With that people there were no communications at all.\nThey didn't have any communication.",
        "A: I cannot say about it at all.",
        "A: Well, we had to get word, the words was given before we went out to work. They give them\nthe words. And before they went out to work, they gave them the -- told them at that time\nthey wanted this. \u201cDo it.\u201d That's the only communication they got. After they went out to\nwork, each group went a different direction, you know. Then we couldn't communicate with\nthem anymore. We couldn't even know -- like myself, when I was running, a lot of people\nwere running in different directions over there. Some of them, most of them were going\ndifferent directions.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: We all slept in the same place, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, see, everybody -- somebody met somebody from each group for them to work, one\nperson to two people, they know it. You see, they are supposed to let know the rest of the\ngroup, you see. They couldn't give everybody the time. They gave it to only a few people\neach whenever they -- the leader or something, them, this or that is the time. The rest of the\npeople couldn't know because there's too much, too much of a risk.",
        "A: At night we all came to the same place. The same kitchen, and we ate together. They were at\nthe table or underneath or something like this.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I was trusted from them.",
        "A: Well, there's no risk. Was no risk; I was dead anyway. What have I got to risk? I didn't risk\nnothing. There was no risk involved, see. I was running away, and I wouldn't want to\nsurvive, was a risk. But running away, at that time was no risk at all because I was a dead\nperson anyway. This, dead sentence because I was a Jew. That's all that it 1s. I did at that\ntime have no choice. There was no risk at all.",
        "A: That's what we were waiting for. When we were waiting, sometimes maybe somebody,\nmaybe somebody will come do some bomb, do something. Of course, they had opportunity.\nThey were strong, they had the tools, they had ratchets, and they had everything. They could\nhave done, they didn't do. The Germans were so scared themselves, and one started to run\nand one was standing with a gun in his hand and he couldn't shoot. He was shaking like this\n[indicating no]. They were so scared like that. They couldn't, they couldn't --",
        "A: I can't remember the date when it come at that time.",
        "A: No, there was no place there to swim. They're not near the water to swim there. They are\nnowhere near, this is nothing there. It 1s just unbelievable that -- I cannot say, because it was\na desert. There was no water. Even the ditches are so deep there to get water. They gave us\nto eat potatoes not washed even, with the dirt. When I used to eat my potato when I came in\nthe beginning and the lots of people were there, I still got the peels from the potato. And they\npicked it up in the dirt on the ground, and they ate it. That's a step that I didn't -- I couldn't\nbelieve it. I couldn't say it then, because I wasn't hungry at that time yet. Or what they did\nlike this.",
        "A: SS officer?",
        "A: What's the name? Keloa, Keloa (ph)? Another one was, what's the name, Lakla (ph)? We\ncall him Lakla, a nice young fellow, big fellow. That was the court that I was a witness for at\nthat time frame. This Keloa-- of course, nobody has the same name, real name. Didn't call\nthem by the real name because we make the different name because they shouldn't know\nwhat we're talking about. You see, that's what I mean, change the name to another name. I\nknow it and that second fellow know it over there, but the German didn't know then we call\nit when we mention his name.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It was not burning yet. It was started to burn because when they started that thing was\npeople, some people work there, disinfect us they used to call it. They disinfected the\nclothing, the places there, the clothes; the Germans did this. That day we found out that they\nhave some gasoline. Instead of putting in disinfection, we told them to put in the gasoline\ninside in the tanks. They set it go around, spraying with that thing with the disinfection, they\nspray it with this. It wasn't so easy to catch on fire because we didn't have too many matches\nto spare. So we had it burning there. After -- I was running, I see it burning, in fact, one\nGerman got killed. I didn't look back, didn't want to look back because I was running.",
        "A: Burning the camp. Started slowly, yeah. We were burning the camp.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, say, in this cases, see, none of them took any risk of anything because you or your\npeople were caged like a tiger or some sort of other animals. You don't -- any chance you\nhave, you want to jump at another day because there's not another chance. You didn't, no risk\ninvolved.",
        "A: No, but we didn't storm the gates. Everybody was outside the gates. They were working\noutside the gates, not inside. Most of the people like me, I was inside the gate because our\nshops were inside the gate. The shoemaker was inside his gate. The locksmith was inside the\ngate. The rest of the people worked at different places outside the gates, under the\nsupervision of Ukrainians or Germans. We were inside the gates, working.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Nothing, no other plan could we do. The best plan we had was to just run away from -- they\nwere outside the gate and everyone could run. But the only way of this would be we were all\ntogether, and we couldn't stay all together. We couldn't -- even we could keep ourselves\ntogether, 1t was a very big risk to stay ourselves together, because we could be caught. As a\nmatter of fact, a day after I was running away, I was afraid to stay somewhere, I was in the\nfields. Not even the farms, because I was afraid they going to come and look all over for us.\nSo I was not able to live with this risk. So this was no -- any risk was nothing. Only we\ncouldn't help each other. Everybody was solo there. Everybody was saying they couldn't. I\ncouldn't have helped anybody if I had no way, I can't help myself. I can't help it, though.",
        "A: They was shaking. I saw -- like I told you before. One general was standing with a gun; he\ncouldn't shoot. He was shaking. He was afraid. They only were not afraid when they had the\ngun above us. When they started to -- we could have -- didn't have to run nowhere and burn,\nthey all think and kill them all of the Germans, but we had the courage, see. The resistance\nwas so low, but this was a desperate people, they were afraid to do anything. And another\nthing, as a matter of fact, the Germans used go around, \"When you going run? You going to\nrun now? Where you going to run? Where will you go? You have nowhere left to go.\" This\nis a Safe place, you stay there...that's what they tell me.",
        "A: The image I'm stuck with, the people around the whole world how did they let it happen like\nthis? The United States knowing about it. The Arab countries know. England knowing about\nbecause they had spies all over. They told them everything. Why did they wait until they\nkilled off six million? Why they didn't do this before? Why they didn't do -- they could have\ndone something to spoil the whole thing. But then nobody did anything, nobody wanted to\ndo anything. Because it was only Jews involved, not -- but they didn't know how many other\nnations got killed, also. The Czechoslovakian, Polish, all the country. Anybody said anything\nto them, they killed them. Even Gypsies, what did the Gypsies do, didn't set a, you know, set\na trap for the German people. They didn't do that. They put them in a concentration camp. I\nsaw them coming in. They came in with -- they were looking around. They didn't know\nwhat's happened to them, Gypsies.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Personally, I wanted to see what -- either it's going to happen, after everything is over, I want\nto see. Everything I was fighting for, I want to see what they were going to do to the German\npeople, what they were doing to the other people. All the other people, like the -- what's the\nname, the Arabs. They helped the Germans. The other thing I wanted to see somebody that's\na friend of theirs, everything was -- I was so much disappointed after everything was over. I\nlooked and then what did it do to Germany? They got a few people, they gave them a trial,\nfew people. The most of them, they knew all of this came in. Well, clothing came into\nGermany that didn't know, didn't ask no questions from where it comes? A lot of everything\nwas getting, the gold, the Germans take a vacation. Sent satchels full of gold and diamonds\nto Germany every couple of months to get 1t away. The Germans didn't get nothing from\nanybody, from the Jews. Half a million Jews got killed in Treblinka. So everybody had\nsomething, a chain or earrings or anything. They know, but they didn't -- everybody kept\nquiet at the size clothes.\nEnd of Tape #4\nConclusion of Interview\n"
